        "text": "Description\n\nLaurence Stephen Lowry\n\nDavid Lloyd-George's Birthplace, Manchester\n\noil on canvas\n\n91.5cm. by 71.5cm.; 36in. by 28Â¼in.\n\nProvenance\n\nAlex. Reid & Lefevre Gallery, London, where acquired by Sir John Smith, 19th December 1958\n\nCondition\n\nThe following condition report was compiled by Hamish Dewar Ltd. on 28th May 2019. Structural Condition The canvas is unlined on what is evidently the original keyed wooden stretcher. There are traces of paint on the reverse of the canvas and the overall structural condition is sound and secure. There are some faint lines of drying craquelure which are stable and almost inevitable for an unlined canvas by Lowry and it is obviously most encouraging to find the canvas in it's original unlined state. Paint surface The paint surface has the artist's characteristically unvarnished appearance. Inspection under ultraviolet light shows no evidence of any retouching. Summary The painting would therefore appear to be in very good and stable condition. Please telephone the department on +44 (0) 207 293 6424 if you have any questions regarding the present work.\n\n\"In response to your inquiry, we are pleased to provide you with a general report of the condition of the property described above.
