We are sorry that we cannot accept any new submissions.\n\nUnfortunately, from July 2024, when our only Art Detective staff member retires, we will not have sufficient funding to run the Art Detective service as we would like.\n\nArt Detective will, therefore, be paused until further notice from 28th June 2024. All 887 discussions and more than 22,000 individual submissions will remain accessible on the Art UK website. But no new comments will be accepted after this date.\n\nBefore Art Detective is paused at the end of June 2024, we will be seeking to close as many open discussions and submissions as possible."
