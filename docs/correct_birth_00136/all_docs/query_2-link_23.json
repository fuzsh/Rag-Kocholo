        "text": "The birthday of David Lloyd George has been marked at special ceremony in his home village.\n\nRelatives and schoolchildren gathered near the grave of the former Prime Minister in Llanystumdwy, Gwynedd, who was born on January 17, 1863.\n\nThe ceremony, which was arranged by the Friends of the Lloyd George Museum in Llanystumdwy, has become an annual tradition, with pupils from the village school singing hymns and placing a wreath on his grave.\n\nEmrys Williams from the friends of the museum, said: “It’s important we continue to remember the birth of one of the area’s most famous sons.\n\n\"A boy who was brought up in Llanystumdwy and who had received little formal education and went on to not only represent his own community as an MP for the then Caernarfon boroughs constituency, but who would later go on to secure the highest public office in the land.”\n\nLast year marked the centenary of his arrival in 10 Downing Street and to this day he remains the only Welsh man or woman to be appointed PM.\n\nLed by Rev Sue Williams the short service was held at the memorial to Lloyd George on the banks of Afon Dwyryd. The wreath was laid by Celyn Jackson and Daisy Good.\n\nLloyd George’s family were represented by his grand niece Elizabeth.\n\nBorn in Manchester David Lloyd George was brought up by his uncle’s family in Llanystumdwy after his father died when he was 18 months old. His uncle, Richard Lloyd, a shoemaker, helped support the family.\n\nThe young Dafydd grew up in a Welsh-speaking home that had strong religious influence, without a silver spoon and in a rural Caernarfonshire working community.\n\nHe didn’t attend university but qualified as a lawyer anf soon became interested in politics.\n\nIn 1890, aged 27, he won the Caernarvon (sic) Boroughs constituency by just 18 votes, standing as a Liberal and Welsh Nationalist.\n\nHe went on to hold the seat for 54 years.\n\nLord Dafydd Wigley, who later held the same seat in Parliament, said: “He helped safeguard the primacy of Welsh in the National Eisteddfod. Yet, for all his power, he failed to deliver a Welsh legislature.”\n\nThe Lloyd George Museum opened at Llanystumdwy in 1963."
