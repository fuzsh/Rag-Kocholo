This painting reveals Lowry to be a master poet of isolation. In his hands, a seemingly ‘straight-forward’ rendering of a humble ‘two up, two down’ in a non-descript backstreet becomes something profound and symbolic.\n_\nA man of lower middle-class origins who rose to the highest office in the land as Liberal Prime Minister, Lloyd George had first-hand experience of the life of the urban poor. His house was exactly the kind of dwelling that Lowry would have visited on his rounds as a rent collector, a job that he held despite his increasing renown as an artist. Painted in 1958 when Lowry’s reputation was approaching its height and more than a decade after the great statesman’s death, this haunting work caught the eye of Sir John Smith as he walked past the window of Lefevre Gallery in Mayfair, shortly after the painting’s completion.\n_\n‘David Lloyd-George’s Birthplace, Manchester’ will headline ‘Recollections of Place Past’, a sale of Property from the Estate of Sir John and Lady Smith in #London on 9 July – a distinctly personal collection that was shaped by their combined passions for the past and the poetic. #SothebysModBrit #LSLowry #ModernBritishArt\".",
