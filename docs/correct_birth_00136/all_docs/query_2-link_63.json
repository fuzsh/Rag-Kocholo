        "text": "“Lloyd George Knew My Father” goes the old music hall ditty but frankly he’d have been more interested in getting acquainted with the female members of your family.\n\nIt’s 100 years since David Lloyd George became Prime Minister but, for many, the fame of the only Welshman to occupy Number 10 rests on his scandalous private life rather than his considerable public achievements.\n\nSo should he be remembered as the Welsh Wizard? Or the Welsh Goat? I’ve been grappling with this conundrum for several months, making a BBC radio documentary on his complicated personal life entitled Lloyd George and His Women.\n\nI’ve spoken to his great great grandson Dan Snow and Ruth Longford, the grand-daughter of his mistress Frances Stevenson. I’ve delved into Lloyd George’s love letters and read studies of his relationships, including Ffion Hague’s masterly The Pain and the Privilege.\n\nI’ve listened to historians and heard the voices of his contemporaries and family members echoing on crackly archive recordings.\n\nAnd through it all Lloyd George stares up at me from his photographs – twinkly eyed, smiling behind that raffish ‘tache and still capable of charming even though he’s in two dimensions and been dead since 1945.\n\nHe makes today’s errant politicians look like choirboys\n\nIt’s as if he’s amused at the paradox he left behind him. There is so much to admire. A man raised by a single mother in a humble Welsh cottage who soared past aristocrats and the establishment elite to secure the top job in British politics. A radical whose social reforms laid the foundations of the welfare state. And a statesman who won the war and negotiated the peace that followed.\n\nBut there is much to deride too. This most promiscuous of premiers makes today’s errant politicians look like choirboys. No modern leader would have got away with a private life peppered with illicit liaisons, illegitimate offspring and an almost bigamous balancing of wife and mistress.\n\nYet perhaps his philandering path through life was inevitable. Because from the moment David Lloyd George entered this world in 1863 he was adored by women.\n\nHis daughter Olwen recalled in an interview recorded in 1986 how his hold over females began in childhood. “He was very spoiled. My grandmother spoiled him. It was he who domineered the home. He had that way about him. You couldn’t help it. You’d run a mile, you’d do anything for him. And he had that when he was small.\n\nThe doted-on little boy grew into a charismatic teenager who drew local girls into his orbit. Lloyd George’s youthful diaries record tellings-off for flirting. He also writes of his resolution to “give up these dealings” because “the realisation of my prospects, my dreams, my longings for success are very scant indeed unless I am determined to give up what without mistake are the germs of a fast life.”\n\nThere was a rumour he had also fathered a child by his wife’s cousin\n\nBut then a woman came into Lloyd George’s life who was so refined and respectable perhaps he hoped she could apply the brakes. Against opposition from her family, he set out to woo her.\n\n“He married Margaret Owen when he was very young man in 1888,” historian Dr Elin Jones explains. “She came from a local, well-off farming family – they were much better off than Lloyd George’s family. And she had been raised to be something of a lady.\n\nNicely mannered, well-brought up and a big catch for a boy like Lloyd George who had no fortune but his brains. They loved each other and I’m sure as a young husband and wife it was a blissfully happy time. But he was involved in local politics, he was trained as a solicitor, he knew he was going to have a life in the public eye and could see Margaret fitting well into that life. He saw her as someone appropriate for that kind of life.”\n\nAn ideal political consort indeed, a role Margaret performed with admirable dignity throughout a marriage tainted by Lloyd George’s infidelities within mere months of them meeting at the altar.\n\nThere was the widowed Mrs J, a Liberal activist in Caernarvon who Lloyd George got pregnant. Her silence was secured with a lifetime’s annuity on condition no photographs or documentary evidence of the child’s existence came to light.\n\nThere was a rumour he had also fathered a child by his wife’s cousin Kitty Edwards. And there were further affairs with Elizabeth Davies and Julie Henry, both wives of fellow Liberal MPs.\n\nHis behaviour wasn’t that unusual in his own time\n\nBut as outrageous as this might seem to modern eyes Lloyd George’s behaviour wasn’t that unusual in his own time. He certainly wasn’t the only politician who was unfaithful while keeping adultery within one’s own social circle – even to the point of sleeping with your friends’ wives - was considered a necessary tactic to prevent scandal. Divorce, however, was seen as far worse than constant infidelity in the late 19 th and early 20th century.\n\nBy the time Lloyd George was living largely in London as a newly-elected MP, the opportunities for extra-marital adventure were endless. But typically self-absorbed he had the cheek to blame his womanising on his wife. If she would swap North Wales for the metropolis, he argued, he wouldn’t succumb to temptation.\n\nHe didn’t seem to appreciate that a single-roomed lodging in Gray’s Inn was no place for a wife with three children under three, who relied heavily on her Welsh family support network.\n\nMargaret finally made the move when she felt her marriage was seriously threatened by Lloyd George’s affair with the wife of a mutual friend. Their children, meanwhile, grew up with a sanguine approach to their father’s philandering. Olwen described how he possessed “this extraordinary charm” and women simply “wouldn’t leave him alone.”\n\nThey apparently threw themselves in Lloyd George’s direction and he was naturally powerless to resist. Her mother, she said, “wasn’t a doormat. She held her own, she was dignified and she was so loyal.”\n\nYet that loyalty would be put under the severest strain by the arrival of a young woman who would remain in Lloyd George’s life for 30 years. Outwardly serious and demure, 22-year-old Frances Stevenson was originally engaged as a governess to Lloyd George’s youngest daughter Megan. There was already a family link. Frances had been at school with Olwen and Mair – the daughter whose death at 17 from peritonitis devastated her parents.\n\nMistress was 'enthralled by the way he had control of the Welsh audience'\n\nAt the time Frances entered Lloyd George’s life he was at the peak of his powers, more than 25 years her senior and Chancellor of the Exchequer. I listened to archive of her gentle voice recalling years later her first impressions of him. She was dazzled by his oratory at the Welsh chapel in London and recalls how she was “thrilled and enthralled by the way he had complete control of the Welsh audience there.”\n\nAnd he was soon exerting a considerable influence over this studious young woman, inviting her to leave teaching and work for him full time with certain conditions. As her grand-daughter Ruth Longford told me: “I think she had a huge crush on him. She might have been able to resist if he hadn’t told her he needed her – he was in the midst of the Marconi shares scandal – and she came running. She’d already been doing bits of work for him and watching him at the Commons and having dinners. He was hitting on her and she wasn’t holding him off. And he told her if you work for me I won’t be able to avoid making you my mistress. So she did know those were the terms and at that time it was very hard to get interesting jobs as a woman. She’d been totally bored being a teacher in a small girls’ school and suddenly she was going to be private secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.”\n\nIt was a role that no woman had taken before and one that put Frances at the heart of history. A sounding-board and political soul-mate, she was at Lloyd George’s side through his premiership during the Great War and accompanied him to the Versailles Peace Treaty talks.\n\nBut there was a heavy emotional price to pay for being a pioneer. As Lloyd George’s mistress, Frances was giving up the chance of a respectable marriage and children and risked scandal and disgrace. It is believed she endured at least two abortions. Her diaries record her sorrow and pain at the lovechildren that “cannot be.”\n\nAs a contingency to hide another pregnancy Lloyd George concocted a plan to provide Frances with a sham husband – a civil servant called Captain Billy Owen. But at the last minute, Frances couldn’t go through with it. And with supreme irony, Lloyd George was rabidly jealous at the thought of his mistress with another man. As Frances wrote in her diary: “He cried and sobbed as a child, begging me all the time to take no notice of him.”\n\n'My Nain says it must have hurt Margaret deeply'\n\nAnd what about the pain of Margaret, the betrayed wife? “My Nain says it must have hurt her deeply,” says Lloyd George descendant Dan Snow. “But she built a happy place for herself in North Wales. She built a beautiful house. She had her children and a community up there she could take refuge in. All my Nain would say was Margaret hated going to London, staying with the Queen at Windsor and all that kind of thing. And it must have been a personal humiliation for her to be wheeled out on state occasions when many people knew it was a sham.”\n\nWhatever Margaret felt in private, in public she maintained a dignified and indeed a dynamic profile. She was made a Dame in 1920 after raising huge sums for charity in World War I and became Wales’s first woman JP in 1928.\n\nMeanwhile, her husband was maintaining an almost bigamous arrangement. From 1923 onwards, Lloyd George lived in Surrey with Frances and would only visit Criccieth for three weeks during the summer. In 1929, at the age of 41, Frances finally gave birth to the child she had longed for – a girl she named Jennifer.\n\nAfter a lifetime of secrets, the birth of the baby was one more act of subterfuge. Frances placed her in a nursing home for the first few months of her life and then pretended to adopt her. The space for father on her birth certificate was left blank. And in a final twist, Lloyd George may not have been the father anyway. At the time of conception, Frances was having her one and only affair – perhaps in retaliation, as even with a mistress and a wife, Lloyd George continued to have dalliances.\n\nYet though Lloyd George never publicly acknowledged Jennifer as his daughter, he treated her with paternal affection. I actually met Jennifer 20 years ago – she died in 2012. An elegant and fiercely intelligent woman she had fond memories of the man she called Taid. Her daughter Ruth concurred that Lloyd George was an important presence in Jennifer’s early life: “Mum loved him to pieces, and said how twinkly and entertaining he was.”\n\nTwo years after the death of Dame Margaret, Lloyd George finally married Frances at the age of 80 in October 1943 – nudged to the register office and against the wishes of his daughter Megan. Within 15 months he was dead.\n\nThere were countless women in Lloyd George’s life but perhaps only two – Margaret and Frances - were truly loved rather than simply lusted after. In combination they made the perfect wife. Each provided what the other lacked and were prepared to give these complementary qualities to a man who ultimately put his own ambition before both of them."
