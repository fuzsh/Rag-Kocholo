        "text": "Who is St. David of Wales?\n\nSt. David, the patron saint of Wales, is said to have been born around the year 520, a time when Welsh kings ruled small kingdoms and people made their living by farming. Most people in Wales were Christians, and monasteries were important centers of prayer and learning. Legend says his birth took place in a wild thunderstorm on the cliffs, near the city that is now named after him. Some believe that David was the son of Sanctus, king of Ceredigion and a nun named Nonnita (Non).\n\nThere are many stories of St. David’s miracles. They include bringing a dead boy back to life by splashing the child’s face with tears, and restoring a blind man’s sight. David’s best-known miracle allegedly took place in the village of Llanddewi Brefi. He was preaching to a large crowd, but some people had difficulty hearing him. Suddenly a white dove landed on David’s shoulder, and as it did, the ground on which he stood rose up to form a hill, making it possible for everyone to see and hear him.\n\nIn Arthur E. Hughes' essay, ‘The Welsh national emblem: leek or daffodil?’ which appeared in the journal Y Cymmrodor 26 (1916), the author explains that the origins of the leek as national symbol are uncertain. Shakespeare popularized the idea that wearing the leek originated as recognition of Welsh soldiers’ bravery at the battle of Crécy 1346 in his play Henry V (1598/9). Sources from the 17th century claim that wearing leeks recalls David’s custom of fasting on water and leeks, as written in Michael Drayton's work Polyolbion (1612).\n\nWearing daffodils was promoted in particular by former Prime Minister David Lloyd George. Daffodil is cennin Pedr (i.e. Peter’s leek) in Welsh, easy to conflate ‘cennin’ (Leek) and ‘cennin Pedr’. The investiture of Edward as Prince of Wales in Caernarfon 1911 saw Welsh dragons and daffodils used as symbols on thrones and regalia rather than leeks.\n\nThe feast day St. David is March 1st. In South Yarmouth we celebrate St. David’s Day on the first Sunday of March with special prayers, daffodils and leek soup at our coffee hour!"
