        "text": "David Lloyd George was born in Manchester on 17 January 1863. His father died when he was young and his mother took him to Wales to be raised.\n\nHe became a lifelong Welsh nationalist. He qualified as a solicitor and in 1890 was elected Liberal member of parliament for Caernarvon, a seat he held until 1945.\n\nIn 1908, he was named chancellor of the exchequer in Herbert Henry Asquith's government.\n\nPerhaps best known for his role as the cantankerous Detective Inspector Russell Bing in 55 Degrees North, Mark has had a career full of variety. From growing up in Wales and studying drama at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama he would later find himself moving from such British television staples such as This Life and Holby City to the Hollywood blockbusters of Master and Commander and Tron. As well as his turns on television and silver screen he has also performed many times on stage and notably in various plays with the Royal Shakespeare Company."
