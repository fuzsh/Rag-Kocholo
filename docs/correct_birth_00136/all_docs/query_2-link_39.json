        "text": "Back in 2007, an unholy row broke out between the outraged left and David Lloyd George's loyal corps of Welsh defenders, headed by Wales's own Prince Charles. The cause of the row was the unveiling, in Parliament Square, of an eight-foot bronze statue of the former PM. The attack was led by John Pilger and Harold Pinter, outraged by the notion of honouring a man who had actively encouraged the bombing of Middle Eastern countries during the first world war.\n\nPilger and Pinter had a point. And there's much else to deplore in the conduct of a charismatic politician who – according to his second wife's diary for 1934 – had also defended England's right \"to bomb niggers\"; who was ruthlessly selfish in the way he treated his brother (and loyal financial supporter), his many mistresses and both of his long-suffering wives. Lloyd George's sale of honours in order to cram the House of Lords with his well-heeled supporters is hard to defend; his shrill endorsements of Hitler only ended in 1941 when Churchill icily compared his Right Honourable Friend's attitude to that of Marshal Pétain, the 85-year-old premier of Vichy France. (Lloyd George, publicly mortified, never spoke in the House of Commons again.)\n\nNevertheless, statues shouldn't be raised only to saints and Lloyd George, for all his considerable defects, was no Lucifer. There is much to be said in favour of the man who led England to victory in the first world war (after forcing through the idea of unity among the squabbling allies), who modernised liberalism, who laid the foundations for an enlightened welfare state, whose powers of oratory were, during his heyday, unrivalled – and whose brilliant negotiating skills in Tory-Liberal coalitions could give our current leaders food for thought.\n\nLloyd George has not, as yet, been fortunate in his biographers. John Grigg died while only two-thirds of the way through his magisterial account of the man he passionately admired. (Volume Four, taking readers only up to the end of 1918, was published two years after Grigg's death in 2001.) More recently, one brisk overview has been published in a series about British prime ministers, while another short life examines Lloyd George in a specifically Welsh context. Neither book claims to be comprehensive.\n\nA good one-volume life had yet to be written; Roy Hattersley seemed suited to the task. Hattersley, like Lloyd George, takes pride in presenting himself as a political maverick, while his experience as deputy leader of the Labour party has given him an insider's view of the shark tank. A confident raconteur, Hattersley shares Lloyd George's flexibility, playing (with equal ease) the roles of social charmer and bluff provincial. It's easy to see why Hattersley's namesake, Roy Jenkins – mentioned in this book's introduction – thought that his colleague might write with understanding about a politician for whom he himself professed (a bit surprisingly) a strong dislike.\n\nJenkins thought wrong. Hatttersley's book, while lucid, fluent and historically correct, falls short of perfection on several counts. Over-reliant on familiar material, it shows scant concern for possible angles from which new light might illuminate a complex individual. To take one glaring absence: no mention is made of the remarkable documentary film – it is almost in the class of DW Griffith's Birth of a Nation — about Lloyd George's life, which was suppressed in 1918 (the German-born producers were compensated with £20,000 in £1 notes, from an undisclosed source) and rediscovered, in a single uncompleted copy, among Lloyd George's private archives. Wasn't this remarkable work, easily available today on DVD, with an authorative introduction by Kevin Brownlow, worth even a glance? To take another example: did Hattersley think that the papers and published articles of Gareth Jones, private secretary and speech-writer to Lloyd George during two significant years (1930-1932), were utterly insignificant? Jones (murdered in Mongolia in 1935) doesn't even rate a mention.\n\nHattersley's heavy dependence on published sources suggests a lack either of time or, perhaps, commitment. One explanation may be that – having taken up Lord Jenkins's suggestion – he fell out of love with his subject. Grigg, while acknowledging Lloyd George's considerable flaws, judged him gently; Hattersley, by contrast, misses no opportunity to voice disapproval of a ruthless opportunist who fantasised about his Welsh origins and his impoverished childhood, who ridiculed his benefactors, neglected his family, and whose pose as the people's champion conflicted with the blunt declaration made to his wife, Margaret Owen, shortly before their marriage in 1888: \"My supreme idea is to get on.\"\n\nIf the horse is that dead, why flog us through a 700-page biography of the animal?\n\nHattersley is not, however, completely dismissive. Credit is given to Lloyd George's uncommon skills as a negotiator (his first great achievement, as president of the Board of Trade in Campbell-Bannerman's 1906 Liberal cabinet, was to broker a deal between angry rail unions and 17 irate company chairmen). Praise is offered for his role in modernising the Liberal party, and for the pensions and national insurance schemes with which Lloyd George paved the way for Britain's modern welfare state. It is acknowledged that he was one of the 20th century's two great British war leaders, although more emphasis might have been laid upon the fact that Lloyd George had no broadcasting service by which to spread the bewitchment of his oratory.\n\nAs an introduction to Lloyd George, Hattersley's book is clear and energetic. As a key to the personality of an exceptional politician, it does little justice to the man evoked in Harold Nicolson's amused account (Hattersley quotes it) of the septuagenarian Lloyd George addressing a Midlands audience on the need to oppose Mussolini's venture into Abyssinia. The old Welshman was, so Nicolson noted, \"absolutely bursting with vitality, roguishness, wit and reminiscences\".\n\nGladstone, Lloyd George blithely declared, went on until he was 85: \" – and so shall I\".\n\nA few more such cameo-portraits could have done wonders for this book, not just for Lloyd George's fallen reputation, but for a sour-voiced biography that, sadly, promises more than it delivers.\n\nMiranda Seymour's Chaplin's Girl: The Life and Loves of Virginia Cherrill is published by Pocket Books."
