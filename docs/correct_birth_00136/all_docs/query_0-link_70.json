        "text": "\"Lloyd George\" redirects here. For other uses, see Lloyd George (disambiguation).\n\nThis British surname is barrelled, being made up of multiple names. It should be written as Lloyd George, not George.\n\nDavid Lloyd George, 1st Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor,[lower-alpha 1] (17 January 1863 â€“ 26 March 1945) was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1916 to 1922. A Liberal Party politician from Wales, he was known for leading the United Kingdom during the First World War, for social-reform policies (including the National Insurance Act 1911), for his role in the Paris Peace Conference, and for negotiating the establishment of the Irish Free State. He was the last Liberal prime minister; the party fell into third-party status during the last years of his premiership.\n\nYoung Lloyd George gained a reputation as an orator and a proponent of a Welsh blend of radical Liberal ideas, which included support for Welsh devolution, for the disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales, for equality for labourers and tenant farmers, and for reform of land ownership. In 1890 he narrowly won a by-election to become the Member of Parliament for Caernarvon Boroughs, in which seat he remained for 55 years. He served in Henry Campbell-Bannerman's cabinet from 1905. After H. H. Asquith succeeded to the premiership in 1908, Lloyd George replaced him as Chancellor of the Exchequer. To fund extensive welfare reforms he proposed taxes on land ownership and high incomes in the \"People's Budget\" (1909), which the Conservative-dominated House of Lords rejected. The resulting constitutional crisis was only resolved after two elections in 1910 and the passage of the Parliament Act 1911. His budget was enacted in 1910, and the National Insurance Act 1911 and other measures helped to establish the modern welfare state. In 1913, he was embroiled in the Marconi scandal, but he remained in office and secured the disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales.\n\nIn 1915, Lloyd George became Minister of Munitions and rapidly expanded artillery shell production for the war against Germany. In 1916, he was appointed Secretary of State for War but was frustrated by his limited power and by clashes with the top Army commanders over strategy. Asquith on the other hand proved ineffective as prime minister and was replaced by Lloyd George in December 1916. He centralised authority by creating a smaller war cabinet. To combat food shortages caused by German u-boats, he implemented the convoy system, established rationing, and stimulated farming. After supporting the disastrous French Nivelle Offensive in 1917, he had to reluctantly approve Field Marshal Haig's plans for the Battle of Passchendaele, which again resulted in huge casualties with little strategic benefit. Against the views of British military commanders, he was finally able to see the Allies brought under one command in March 1918. The war effort turned in Allied favour in August and was won in November. In the aftermath, and following the December 1918 \"Coupon\" election, he and the Conservatives maintained their coalition with popular support."
