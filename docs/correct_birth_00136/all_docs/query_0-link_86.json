        "meta_description": "David Lloyd George was a British politician and statesmen who is best remembered for being the United Kingdom's prime minister during World War I (1916-1922). As a leader of the victorious Allies, George played a major role during the Versailles Treaty negotiations, taking a more moderate view toward Germany, favoring reconciliation over reparations as the French preferred. He was a member of the Liberal Party and was that party's last member to be prime minister. George was born David Lloyd George on January 17, 1863 in Manchester, England to William and Elizabeth George. David's family was ethnic Welsh and he was brought up with Welsh as his first language. After his father died when he was a toddler, David was raised by his mother's brother, Richard Lloyd, who took a keen interest in his nephew's upbringing, acting as an adoptive father. He spent his childhood and young adulthood in Wales. George studied the law and worked as a solicitor in the late 1800s and then became involved in local politics. He married his wife, Margaret Owen, who was also Welsh, in January 1888. The couple would have five children.",
