Who was David Lloyd George?

He was born in Manchester, but raised in Llanystwmdwy, Caernarfonshire where he studied to be a solicitor before being elected to Parliament for the Caernarvon Boroughs constituency in 1890. In his early career he was a prominent figure campaigning on radical issues such as the disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales and Home Rule for Wales before being appointed to the Cabinet in several positions including President of the Board of Trade and Chancellor of the Exchequer. In that post he was responsible for legislation establishing the state pension and National Insurance to provide for the sick and unemployed.

During the Great War he was appointed first as Minister of Munitions and then in December 1916 as Prime Minister. Following the war he won the ‘Coupon Election’ of 1918, heading a coalition government. During the post-war years he faced numerous challenges such as negotiating the Versailles Peace Treaty and the Irish War of Independence.
