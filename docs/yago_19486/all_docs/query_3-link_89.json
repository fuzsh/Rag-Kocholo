        "text": "2001\n\n0 hr 55 mins\n\nDocumentary, Science, Tech & Gaming\n\nNR\n\nWatchlist\n\nAlbert Einstein's first wife Mileva Marie Einstein is the focus of this PBS production that explores her history, her marriage to the physicist, and the controversial theory that she was responsible for aiding him in some of his biggest discoveries. Despite their 15-year marriage, Mileva is rarely mentioned in Einstein's writings and their relationship devolved into one of constant feuding and chronic illness, as she found herself in and out of hospitals. But recently uncovered letters and documents suggest that Mileva had a hand in developing some of her husband's theories, and that he subsequently downplayed her role in his work, and even his life."
