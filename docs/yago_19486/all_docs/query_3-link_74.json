        "text": "THE genius behind Albert Einstein's theories of light, space and time may have been a little-known collaborator, his first wife, according to recent re-examinations of his life.\n\nThis radical interpretation is based primarily on a collection of recently published letters between Einstein and his first wife, Mileva Einstein-Maric, a well-educated mathematician and physicist. The theory asserts that she was not only familiar with his work, but contributed to it as well.\n\nThe theory has been fiercely denounced by traditional Einstein scholars as ''pure fantasy'' built on flimsy evidence and concocted stories. ''She may have been a sounding board for his ideas, but she was not a collaborator,'' said John Stachel, director of the Center for Einstein Studies at Boston University.\n\nThe leading campaigner on Miss Maric's behalf is Evan Harris Walker, a research physicist at the United States Army Ballistic Research Laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland. He cites as primary evidence key phrases culled from correspondence between Einstein and Miss Maric in the years before he published three ground-breaking papers in 1905, including the one for which he won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics. It concerned light and energy, an area in which Miss Maric had some background.\n\nFor example, in a letter to Miss Maric in 1901, Einstein wrote, ''How happy and proud I will be when the two of us together will have brought our work on the relative motion to a victorious conclusion!''\n\nThere are more than 10 other instances in the approximately 40 letters from Einstein to Miss Maric before 1903, referring to ''our work'' or to their collaboration, said Dr. Walker, who presented his ideas at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science this month in New Orleans.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
