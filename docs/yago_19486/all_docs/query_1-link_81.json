        "meta_description": "Einstein's Wife- Atlas Performing Arts Center- Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized modern science and his name became synonymous with genius. Lesser known is the story of Mileva Marić, the physicist, mathematician, and fellow student at Zurich Polytechnic who was Einstein's first wife. As recently discovered personal correspondence suggests, Mileva contributed substantially to his scientific success yet received no professional credit. In this gripping production, Serbian playwright Snezena Gnjidic and English translator Milena Trobozic Garfield present a thoughtful portrait of the couple's tumultuous relationship and her role in developing his ground-breaking ideas. What started as a scientific team eventually was derailed by motherhood and a world not prepared for women's professional achievements. Einstein's Wife explores the life of a gifted woman living in the shadow of a brilliant man.",

        "text": "DC Theater Arts - Recommended\n\n\"...For all the playful humor and lighthearted warmth in the way Einstein's Wife liberates Mileva MariÄ Einstein from sexism in science history, the play pulls no punches about the sexism she got stuck with at home with Albert.\"\n\nRead Full Review\n\n- John Stoltenberg\n\nWashington City Paper - Recommended\n\n\"...Now Rosnizeck returns to D.C. with her original American cast, starring Sasha Olinick as Albert Einstein and Cecelia Auerswald as Mileva Marić, Einsteins first wife and intellectual companion for nearly two decades, in a story that invites us to ask what role she played in developing the theories that led to a Nobel Prize and renown as one of historys great scientists.\"\n\nRead Full Review\n\n- Ian Thal\n\nMD Theatre Guide - Highly Recommended\n\n\"...Karin Rosnizeck has directed an unusually constructed show that contains elements not normally taken up on stage (think Proof with less heady formulas). It turns out that it is eminently watchable, almost a dont take your eyes off it experience.\"\n\nRead Full Review\n\n- Brian Bochicchio\n\nDCTheatreScene - Recommended\n\n\"...ExPats Theatre is \"devoted to connecting people across cultures through theater and the performing arts.\" With this production of Einstein's Wife, the company tells an engaging story of importance to Serbian expatriates living and working in Washington, D.C.: a story that lets Serbians see a positive picture of themselves and helps non-Serbians in Washington understand more about the culture, passion and concerns of their often invisible neighbors.\"\n\nRead Full Review\n\n- Gregory J. Ford\n\nBroadwayWorld - Highly Recommended\n\n\"...One of the most successful parts of this production is its ability to make you question. I loved that I walked out of the theatre questioning what other famous men had taken credit from hard working, innovative women. It made me want to reexamine the history of seemingly well known discoveries or advancements where credit that should have been given to women was stolen, and acknowledgment swept under the rug. This production is an important and timely correction in this \"me too\" era to an egregious rewriting of history. Through Einstein's Wife, Mileva Malic's important work and dedication to physics but to her family was finally recognized.\"\n\nRead Full Review\n\n- Elizabeth Seablom"
