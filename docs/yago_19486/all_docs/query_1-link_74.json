        "text": "EINSTEIN’S WIFE ran March 5-12, 2020 at the ATLAS Performing Arts Center, before being truncated by the COVID pandemic. Einstein’s theory of relativity revolutionized modern science and his name became synonymous with genius. Lesser known is the story of Mileva Maric, the physicist, mathematician, and fellow student at Zurich Polytechnic who was Einstein’s first wife. As recently discovered personal correspondence suggests, Mileva contributed substantially to his scientific success yet received no professional credit. In this gripping production, Serbian playwright Snezena Gnjidic and English translator Milena Trobozic Garfield present a thoughtful portrait of the couple’s tumultuous relationship and her role in developing his ground-breaking ideas. What started as a scientific team eventually was derailed by motherhood and a world not prepared for women’s professional achievements. EINSTEIN’S WIFE explores the life of a gifted woman living in the shadow of a brilliant man.\n\nExPats Theatre is a 501 (c) (3) tax-exempt, non-profit organization under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.
