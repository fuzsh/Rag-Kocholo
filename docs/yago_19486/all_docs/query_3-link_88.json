        "text": "Elsa Einstein typed letter signed, composed upon her husband Albert Einstein's personal stationery. Writing from the ''White House'', their vacation home in Old Lyme, Connecticut on 10 June 1935, Elsa invites her cousin Erich for a visit. Letter translated from German reads in part, ''Even without having received your letter, I would have written you today in any case to invite you for next Sunday. We keep moving closer to you in the summer; it started with Watch Hill, Old Lyme is the continuation, and next year we will rent a place near Springfield, so it will be more convenient for you... We rented a beautiful country house, very large and very stately. We were tired of searching and took something that was too grandiose for us, really. The location is beautiful, and the solitude even more so. Just ask somebody in Old Lyme for the location of the White House, it is [crossed out] three two to three miles outside the village proper...'' Elsa then writes about her daughter Margot, a sculptor, before mentioning the ''deep hole in my heart'', no doubt referring to the loss of her other daughter Ilse from cancer a year earlier. Letter continues, ''...Margot stayed in Bermuda; it is difficult for her to leave that place, since she loves being there so much. She has a black live model and she is working with great success. All of us came from Bermuda directly to Old Lyme, having spent a week in Bermuda and having enjoyed it greatly...[handwritten] from Albert as well, / Your Elsa / Being here could be so nice, if I did not have such a deep hole in my heart!'' Single page letter measures 7.25'' x 10.5''. Folds, overall in near fine condition. With full translation."
