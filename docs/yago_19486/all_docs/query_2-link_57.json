        "text": "In the early summer of 1918, Albert Einstein began divorce negotiations with his first wife, Mileva1. He had been separated2 from her for some period and begun a relationship with Elsa3. Einstein sent a letter through a friend4 with details of how he would be prepared to support her and the children. During these negotiations the question of the Nobel Prize5 was raised. It is not quite certain who first suggested that the interest from the Prize, then some 30,000 Swedish Kroner,6 would be sufficient to keep Einstein’s family in at least modest circumstances, but it appears to have been Mileva. By July, Einstein had received his first papers of divorce and then had to give evidence before a tribunal in Berlin. Between the Armistice of November, 1918, and the end of the following year he was to become the most famous scientist in the world.\n\nHis divorce was settled while he was in town giving a series of lectures on February 14, 1919. Simultaneously, he awarded to Mileva any money that should come from a Nobel Prize-several years before he was awarded it. When the prize came, three years later, the cash was passed on from Sweden, via Berlin, to Zurich. Some was lost in movement through the foreign exchanges and more by bad management. With what was left Mileva bought a pleasant house on the Zurichberg. The following year she formally obtained permission to retain the name of Einstein; and, as Mileva Einstein, she lived for another quarter of a century, overshadowed by illness and the worry of a schizophrenic younger son. As soon as his lecture series in Zurich was completed in the spring of 1919, Einstein returned to Berlin. And here, on June 2, he married Elsa7 in a civil ceremony at Berlin-Wilmersdorf.\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\n1Mileva Marie and Einstein met as students and were married January, 1903. They separated in the summer of 1914. They were described as a couple who ‘respected one another as long as they did not have to live together.’\n\n2He was living in Berlin, and Mileva was living in Zurich, Switzerland.\n\n3Elsa Lowenthal, was a widow with two daughters, aged 20 and 18. She and Albert shared an uncle, Casar Koch, and were also related back along the Einstein family tree, they were distant cousins.\n\n4Michaelangelo Besso was a friend of over 40 years. They worked together at the Swiss Patent Office. It is believed Besso was the first person whom Einstein told about his paper on the photoelectric effect, also known as Special Theory of Relativity. A paper submitted without citation or authority.\n\n5Awarded autumn 1922 for his earlier work on the theory of Special Relativity.\n\n6$7.95M U.S. as of 8/26/97.\n\n7Source, Einstein, The Life and Times, Ronald W. Clark (1971)\n\n8Visited native Missourian Edwin Hubble at Mt. Wilson, CA, in February, 1930"
