        "text": "Who are her parents?\n\nElsa Einstein is the daughter of Rudolf Einstein and Fanny Koch Einstein. Elsa’s father Rudolf Einstein was a textile manufacturer and son of Raphael Einstein, a brother of Albert’s paternal grandfather, while Elsa’s mother was Albert’s mother’s sister. Elsa is the maternal first cousin and paternal second cousin of Albert Einstein. Elsa had two sisters, the older one was called Hermine and was born in 1872 but died in 1942. The second was called Paula and was born in 1878 and died in 1955.\n\nElsa Einstein’s children\n\nElsa Einstein’s first shot in marriage was in 1896, she tied the knot with a Berlin textile merchant named Max Löwenthal. Elsa was only twenty years old when she first said “I do”. Her first marriage to Max Löwenthal gave birth to three children – two daughters and a son. The first daughter named IIse was born in 1897 while the second daughter Margot was born in 1899. Their only son was born in 1903. Unfortunately, he died shortly after his birth, leaving Elsa and her husband Max Löwenthal two daughters. Elsa Einstein’s union with Max lasted about twelve years until they officially divorced on May 11, 1908. She quickly moved on with her daughters and began dating her parents.\n\nMore facts about Albert Einstein’s wife\n\nMarried Albert Einstein\n\nAfter her divorce from Löwenthal in 1908, Elsa Einstein began a relationship with her cousin Albert Einstein in 1912. At that time, Albert was married to his first wife, Mileva Matrić, who had borne him three children (one of whom had died). When Mileva Matrić found out about her husband’s affair with Elsa, they separated in 1914. They officially divorced on February 14, 1919, after living apart for five years. Their official separation paved the way for Albert to take Elsa as his second wife and officially legalize his union with her on June 2, 1919.\n\nHer prominent scientist husband – Albert Einstein took on the fatherly roles for their two children. Although there were reports of Albert making strides towards IIse, Elsa was the first daughter to be Albert’s secretary at some point. This did not prevent Elsa from giving lectures and lectures in different places together with Albert.\n\nWith the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany in the 1930s, Elsa and Albert Einstein’s family members moved to the United States in 1933, where Albert became a citizen until his death.\n\nElsa Einstein’s death\n\nUnfortunately, the once happy family of Elsa Einstein gradually lost their joy when Elsa’s daughter IIse died of complications from cancer in 1934. This was a devastating blow to them, but while they were still grieving their loss, Elsa Einstein herself was diagnosed with an illness, being diagnosed with kidney and heart disease on December 20, 1938 in Princeton, New Jersey, which she eventually died biting the dust painfully. Her death at the age of 62 left Albert heartbroken and retired to his books and studies until his own death on April 18, 1955 at the age of 76."
