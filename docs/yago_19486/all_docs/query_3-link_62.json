        "text": "Albert Einstein became known as one of the greatest physicists of all time after publishing the theory of special relativity in 1905 and the theory of gravity in 1916. Despite being one of the twentieth century’s greatest scientists and a genius, deep insights into Einstein’s private life portray him as a cruel husband, a cheat and an adulterer.\n\nSadly, Einstein’s genius nature did not extend to his love life, which was a bumpy ride filled with messy affairs and bitter endings. The truth be told, his personal life was quite chaotic.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Albert Einstein got married twice. His first marriage was to Mileva Maric and later he married his cousin, Elsa. Although Einstein was married, he had extramarital affairs with other women.\n\nReasons why Einstein’s first marriage failed"
