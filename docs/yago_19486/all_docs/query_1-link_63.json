        "text": "By Patrick J.Kiger\n\nFor The Physicist, Monogamy Was A \"Bitter Fruit\"\n\nAs he detailed in his letters, Einstein over the years developed a complicated view of male-female relationships.\n\nIn a June 1953 letter, Albert Einstein tried to console a female friend who had discovered that her husband was having an affair, by advising her that she should resist taking it personally. Cheating, he explained, was the norm among humans.\n\n“I AM SURE YOU KNOW THAT MOST MEN (AS WELL AS QUITE A NUMBER OF WOMEN) ARE NOT MONOGAMOUSLY ENDOWED BY NATURE.\"\n\n“I am sure you know that most men (as well as quite a number of women) are not monogamously endowed by nature,” he wrote, according to a translation from the original German published decades later. “Nature will come through even stronger if convention and circumstances are putting resistances in the way of the individual.”\n\nIt was a subject that the great physicist knew something about from personal experience. Einstein himself had been unfaithful to his first wife, Mileva Maric, and eventually left her to marry his mistress, Elsa Einstein, who was also his cousin. After divorcing Mileva and marrying Elsa, he soon resumed having dalliances with numerous other women as well.\n\n\"You have to keep in mind that in Europe at the time, for a pursued, charismatic man, his behavior wasn't so unusual,\" Harvard physicist and science historian Gerald Holton told Discover magazine in 2006.\n\nWhat was a bit more extraordinary, though, was Einstein’s frankness about his wandering attentions, and his deft construction of a nuanced moral code into which infidelity could fit comfortably. As he detailed in his letters, Einstein over the years had developed a complicated view of male-female relationships."
