        "text": "Our story so far: A quiet mathematical prodigy grows up in a family of high technology schemers into a cocky, charismatic youth. He drops out of school and leaves his country to dodge military service. In college he alienates his teachers by cutting class. He breaks his mother's heart by falling in love with an older foreign woman and fathering an illegitimate child, and eventually marrying her.\n\nMoonlighting at science, while working as a minor civil servant, he publishes a series of papers challenging conventional notions of space, time and the nature of light, and works his way up the academic ladder, becoming estranged from his wife, who is depressed and jealous of other women. He begins an affair in another city.\n\nSo has life episodically unfolded, over 12 years, seven volumes and thousands of pages of the Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, a massive effort to publish all the 43,000 or so documents Einstein left behind at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study when he died in 1955.\n\nThis spring, the eighth and thickest installment of this saga, Volume Eight, was published by the Princeton University Press in two parts totaling 1,118 pages, carrying Einstein through four of the most heroic and stormy years of his life, from 1914 to 1918, when, among other things, he finished work on his crowning achievement, the general theory of relativity.\n\nIts most startling revelation is that in the spring of 1918, Einstein considered breaking off his engagement to his cousin Elsa Einstein and marrying her 20-year-old daughter, Ilse, instead. And the new volume calls into question the degree of Einstein's commitment to antiwar politics in wartime Berlin.\n\nMost importantly, though, the papers here illuminate the tortured and confused path by which Einstein finally completed his long quest to extend the principle of relativity to explain gravity and the universe. Even Einstein, it seems, found it hard to be Einstein.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
