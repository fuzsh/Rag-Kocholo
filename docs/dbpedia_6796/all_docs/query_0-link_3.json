Warmth or fears? It was the highest jump and the lowest risk Wrapped around your fingertips As I embrace you now, will you understand That ignorance ain't bliss, what bliss? It's not hard to explain Ah-ah-oh It's not hard to explain Ah-ah-oh It's not hard to explain Ah-ah-oh We are the youngest we will ever be We are the oldest we have ever been right now Right here, right now We are the youngest we will ever be We are the oldest we have ever been right now Right here, right now We are the youngest we will ever be We are the oldest we have ever been right now Right here, right now Right here, right now Right here, right now Right here, right now Right here, right now Right here, right now\n\nStruggling with Rh Rn? Become a better singer in 30 days with these videos!"
