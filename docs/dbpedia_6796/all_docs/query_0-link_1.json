Truly I don't. There are so many things to get done. Meetings, conferences, reports, and all of them so urgent.\n\nClemson Reade:\n\nSo is our wedding.\n\nEffie:\n\nBut I mean *really* urgent.\n\nEffie:\n\n[Pointing at a globe] Here is Bukistan.\n\nClemson Reade:\n\n[mumbling] Oh, I know, I have been there.\n\nEffie:\n\nHere is the United States.\n\nClemson Reade:\n\n[mumbling] Yes, yes, I have been there too.\n\nEffie:\n\nWe have just *one* thing in common. Oil! Every plan we make for peace or war depends on that oil.\n\nClemson Reade:\n\n'That so?\n\nEffie:\n\nI don't have to tell you what happened in Iran. Half the free world had to learn how to pronounce the name Mosadegh.\n\nClemson Reade:\n\nI still can't.\n\nEffie:\n\nThe same thing is happening again, only this time there will a lot of new names to learn. And the only way to get that oil is to get those names on the dotted line.\n\nClemson Reade:\n\nWe haven't been able to make a definite plan since we met.\n\nEffie:\n\nWell, we went to Vermont for two weeks.\n\nClemson Reade:\n\nYes. Yes, that's right. To her grandfather's farm. For two wonderful relaxing weeks in glorious Vermont.\n\nWalter McBride:\n\nTim'll be there in September.\n\nClemson Reade:\n\nWe spent *one* day there. She had to leave to take care of the crisis in Sahara; some of the sand was missing.\n\nEffie:\n\nWell, you stayed on.\n\nClemson Reade:\n\nWith grandfather. It wasn't the same thing.\n\nClemson Reade:\n\nOh, I didn't mean that. What you are doing *is* important.\n\nEffie:\n\nBut not as important as cooking your breakfast. You don't need me for that. You can buy it for a dollar an hour. We've been emancipated, Mr. Reade. Have you heard of Susan B. Anthony?\n\nClemson Reade:\n\nCan she cook?"
