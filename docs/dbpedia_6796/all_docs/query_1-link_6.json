The film stars Chris Evans and Michelle Monaghan. The film was released on video on demand on March 31, 2015 before a limited release on May 8, 2015 by Vertical Entertainment.[1] It received generally negative reviews from critics.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nMe is a screenwriter in LA who wants to write action flicks, but his agent, Bryan, needs him to write a rom-com first. Due to mother abandonment issues from his childhood, he doesn't let love in or believe in it, so finds writing about romance difficult.\n\nHis buddy Scott is obsessed with romantic books and movies. He’s had a crush for ages on a guy who works at a bookshop. He is tortured, hoping the feelings could be reciprocated.\n\nMe wants to show love as it is in his perspective, not funny nor romantic. Every time anyone has told him they love him, he says he doesn’t think he’d be able to reciprocate. So, he constantly hooks up and then says he doesn’t see a future with them\n\nThen Me meets Her at a charity event, bantering together with ease. Me finds himself really drawn to Her, but suddenly they meet her boyfriend ‘Stuffy’, and she gets whisked away. When he tries to get her out of his head by hooking up quickly with anyone else, for the first time it doesn’t work. He goes back to the venue to see if he can get her name, but there is no one left to ask. Desperate, he steals the guest book.\n\nHis misfit group of friends are all writers: Lyle is prolific yet still unpublished, Samson is a married graphic novelist, Mallory writes and performs one woman shows she makes them attend and of course Scott. Me tells them he is trying to find Her. Most are cynical about marriage and love, while Scott is supportive.\n\nMe goes to see his granddad, who tells him he must search like Columbo. Me and Scott makes the rounds of charity events, hoping to run into Her. After a plethora of events, he is embarrassed at one when the host puts Me on the spot to talk about works that he has previously bragged (lied) about. Her is actually at the event, so they reconnect, and he gets her to agree to a ‘friend date’. Afterwards, when he gives her a lift home, she mentions an upcoming charity event.\n\nThe next day, Scott is again his only friend supportive of love; his other friends try to dissuade him, with Mallory openly hostile.\n\nMe shows up for the event, to find it is actually her yoga class. Their connection continues to strengthen. Chatting in a café, he asks her about ‘Stuffy.’ She describes him as stable, safe and liked by her family and friends. Her dream wedding is at one of the heart sculptures in San Francisco. Me finally confesses that he ‘likes’ her, which she says won’t change her plan.\n\nAt home, Me takes out his shoebox, looking at the goodbye post-it note his mother had left him. At handball the next day his granddad and Scott convince him not to give up on Her. That evening, when he convinces her to go out, she talks about her dad’s suicide when she was young, and they kiss.\n\nHer calls Me up because she can’t get him out of her head, and before long, they end up in bed together. For the first time, he doesn’t feel guilty. Her, on the other hand, leaves feeling badly. She calls again, everything is going well, until his dishonesty about the charities surfaces and she stomps away. Mallory finally confesses she loves Me when he asks her for help. The next morning, Her wakes him with a call, only to confess she is already engaged.\n\nA night of binging, followed by making a fool of himself at her apartment and his granddad dying, gets Me back on track. His writer's block melts away and the rom-com gets done. Scott finally gets a date with that guy, Mallory gives a ‘friend’ a chance. Me realizes he has to try to stop the wedding. After a flight, cliché run through an airport and a taxi ride, and checking all of the heart sculptures, Me finds Her\n\nThe end message: Love isn’t a thinking thing, it’s a feeling thing. Live your own story.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition, Ashley Tisdale and Matthew Morrison make cameo appearances as themselves.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nPre-production\n\n[edit]\n\nThe script for the film was originally titled A Many Splintered Thing and was first on The Black List and was a 2011 finalist for the Nicholl Fellowship.[2]\n\nFilming\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film began filming in late 2012 in Los Angeles and completed in early 2013.
