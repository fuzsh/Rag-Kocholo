        "text": "A Midsummer Night’s Dream, incidental music by German composer Felix Mendelssohn written to accompany performances of Shakespeare’s play A Midsummer Night’s Dream at the Prussian royal court.\n\nMendelssohn became familiar with Shakespeare by reading German translations as a boy, and in 1827, at age 17, he was inspired to write a piece capturing the atmosphere of Shakespeare’s comedy. The piece, a concert overture, quickly became a popular favourite throughout Europe.\n\nMendelssohn returned to Shakespeare in 1843 at the request of Prussian King Frederick William IV, an admirer of the overture, who wanted a set of incidental music for an upcoming production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Mendelssohn crafted 14 short pieces based on themes and moods from the earlier piece. The complete work was first performed with the play on October 14, 1843."
