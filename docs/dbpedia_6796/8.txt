If you save a soul with rock and roll You are love You are love If you turn around and walk away You're playing dumb You're playing dumb What a ridiculous price that has been paid By those who paved our way And not believing the voice that leads to remorse Well, you got me here feeling numb It's not hard to explain Ah-ah-oh It's not hard to explain Ah-ah-oh It's not hard to explain Ah-ah-oh We are the youngest we will ever be We are the oldest we have ever been right now Right here, right now We are the youngest we will ever be We are the oldest we have ever been right now Right here, right now If you save a soul with kindness alone It's worth a shot in the dark When you place your head flat on your bed What appears? Warmth or fears? It was the highest jump and the lowest risk Wrapped around your fingertips As I embrace you now, will you understand That ignorance ain't bliss, what bliss? It's not hard to explain Ah-ah-oh It's not hard to explain Ah-ah-oh It's not hard to explain Ah-ah-oh We are the youngest we will ever be We are the oldest we have ever been right now Right here, right now We are the youngest we will ever be We are the oldest we have ever been right now Right here, right now We are the youngest we will ever be We are the oldest we have ever been right now Right here, right now Right here, right now Right here, right now Right here, right now Right here, right now Right here, right now
