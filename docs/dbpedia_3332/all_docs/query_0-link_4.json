Experience an insider’s quest to unravel his own existential crisis by deconstructing the culture he grew up in, with both satire and love.\n\nPart confession, part history lesson, part multimedia extravaganza, discover this surprisingly poignant coming of age story from a subculture that's so little understood even as it impacts global politics and the perspectives of millions.\n\nComing to a Living Room Near You\n\n2024 Western Canada Tour Dates & Locations:\n\nFebruary 23-25 - Saskatoon (opening sold out)\n\nMarch 1 - Strathmore, AB\n\nMarch 2 - Kelowna (sold out)\n\nMarch 3 - Kamloops\n\nMarch 5 - Mission\n\nMarch 6 - Vancouver\n\nMarch 7-8 - Victoria\n\nMarch 9 - West Vancouver (sold out)\n\nMarch 10 - Burnaby, BC (sold out)\n\nMarch 12 - Vancouver, BC (sold out)\n\nMarch 13 - North Vancouver, BC\n\nMarch 14 - Vancouver, BC\n\nMarch 15 - Surrey, BC\n\nMarch 16 - Calgary, AB\n\nMarch 17 - Edmonton, AB\n\nPlease note: Some dates & locations subject to change.\n\nA Burnt Thicket Theatre production\n\nCreated and performed by Tim Bratton*\n\nDirected by Stephen Waldschmidt\n\nWith dramaturgy by Johnna Wright, and production design by Tim Bratton.\n\nRedefining Home Theatre.\n\nTour presented in partnership with New Leaf Network.\n\nAudience Advisory: Content not suitable for young children.\n\nThank you to our generous donors and these sponsors:\n\nShercom Industries, SK Arts, Canada Council for the Arts, Creative\n\nSaskatchewan, Stobbe Photo (including cover image), Riversdale Neighbours Church, Executive Arrangements, College Park Covenant Church, The Fullerton Fund, and to our co-presenter New Leaf Network (especially Amy Bratton & Jared Siebert).\n\nWould you like to have My Little Plastic Jesus perform in your living room?\n\nOur 2019 & 2020 tours sold out living rooms across SK & AB.

Tim is a local actor and aspiring theatrical dilettante with diverse artistic talents and interests. You may have seen Tim on a Saskatoon stage in lead roles of recent productions such as Miss Bennet: Christmas At the Pemberley (Persephone), The Curst (Dancing Sky), Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (Persephone), Boeing Boeing (Persephone), Pride & Prejudice (Persephone), Art (Persephone), Burnt Thicket's We Are the Body, or Godspell (Vancouver's Pacific Theatre). Tim lives in the King George neighbourhood with his lovely wife, Amy, and their two very active little boys.\n\nPraise for Tim's acting:\n\nSATAward nomination for Outstanding Original Script and Outstanding Leading Performance for My Little Plastic Jesus, 2020.\n\nSATAward nomination for Outstanding Leading Performance for his role as Robert in Persephone Theatre's BOEING, BOEING, 2019.\n\n“The showstopper [in Persephone Theatre's production of ‘Art’] is a speech by Yvan recounting a tense conversation about wedding invitations between his wife and mother. It’s torturously complex, wonderfully absurd and insanely long, but you understand all of it thanks to Tim Bratton’s stellar enactment.”–Saskatoon StarPhoenix\n\n*The participation of this Artist is arranged by permission of Canadian Actors’ Equity Association under the provisions of the Dance Opera Theatre Policy (DOT).\n\nAudience Reviews:\n\n“Thank you for an outstanding experience. We are still debriefing it and the talk back afterward was so enriching. My sisters & I were truly challenged & touched.” –Kathie Greene\n\n“Funny, insightful, thought-provoking & heartbreaking. Tim Bratton delivers a tour de force performance. A great evening!” –Bruce McKay, Artistic Director of La Troupe du Jour\n\n\"Brilliant… looks deeply and critically at evangelical pop culture, finds hope in people, in love, and even in faith… Not just for a Christian audience, it’s funny and speaks to the weirdness of any kind of cultural tribalism or counter-culture experience. I highly, highly recommend the show.\" –Ky Hingston\n\nRead more audience responses here…\n\nWorld Premier in Saskatoon October 17-27, 2019\n\nToured across SK & AB, March 5-15, 2020, Presented by New Leaf Network\n\nToured across Ontario, October 13-21, 2023, Presented by New Leaf Network\n\nMy Little Plastic Jesus in the News\n\nInterview on CTV News:\n\nSee the CBC News interview.\n\nThank you to our Sponsors\n\nProduction Sponsor: Creative Saskatchewan\n\nProduction Sponsor: SK Arts\n\nSeason Sponsor: Shercom Industries, Saskatoon\n\nPhotography Sponsor: Stobbe Photo, Saskatoon\n\nPrinting Sponsor: Globe Printers, Saskatoon"
