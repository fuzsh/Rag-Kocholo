        "text": "William Atherton's career has spanned motion pictures, Broadway and television. He first achieved international recognition as the leading man in Steven Spielberg's debut feature Sugarland Express (1974), and next starred in John Schlesinger's Der Tag der Heuschrecke (1975), Robert Wise's Die Hindenburg (1975) and Richard Brooks' Auf der Suche nach Mr. Goodbar (1977). He is known worldwide for what have become his signature film characters: the television reporter, Dick Thornburg in the action blockbusters Stirb langsam (1988) and Stirb Langsam 2 (1990), the EPA official, Walter Peck in Ghostbusters - Die Geisterjäger (1984), Professor Jerry Hathaway, the conniving professor in Was für ein Genie (1985) and Dr. Noah Faulkner, the mad scientist in Bud & Doyle: Total bio. Garantiert schädlich. (1996). Among his more than 30 feature films are co-starring roles in John Landis' Oscar - Vom Regen in die Traufe (1991), Bill Duke's Hoodlum (1997), Richard Pearce's Gnadenlos (1986), Alan J. Pakula's Die Akte (1993), Costa-Gavras' Mad City (1997) and Edward Zwick's Last Samurai (2003).\n\nOn television, he has starred in numerous miniseries including the classic Western Colorado Saga (1978) and headed the all-star cast in Malibu (1983). His many made-for-TV movies include leading roles in TNT's production of Joan Didion's Ein Richter rechnet ab (1995) and his portrayal of Darryl F. Zanuck in HBO's Golden Globe winner Die Geschichte der Dorothy Dandridge (1999). Atherton was a recurring series lead opposite Damien Lewis on NBC-TV's Life (2007) and portrayed Principal Reynolds in the final season of Lost (2004). He has reprised his role as Walter Peck in the video game Ghostbusters (2009), released on June 16, 2009.\n\nConsistently honored for his work on the stage, Atherton has created roles on and off Broadway for many of America's leading playwrights. These include the title role in Joseph Papp's original production of David Rabe's \"The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel\", the role of Ronnie in John Guare's \"The House of Blue Leaves\" and Bing Ring Ling in his \"Rich and Famous\". He also starred in the Broadway premiere of Arthur Miller's \"The American Clock\" and the Tony-winning revival of Herman Wouk's \"The Caine Mutiny Court Martial\". Among his more than 20 well-known productions are the acclaimed New York premieres of Franz Kafka's \"The Castle\" and Kressman Taylor's \"Address Unknown\". For his work on the stage, he has received the Drama Desk Award, the Outer Circle Critics Award, the Theatre World Award and nominations for an Obie and Chicago's Joseph Jefferson Award.\n\nRené Murat Auberjonois was born on June 1, 1940 in New York City, to Princess Laure Louise Napoléone Eugénie Caroline (Murat), who was born in Paris, and Fernand Auberjonois, who was Swiss-born. René was born into an already artistic family, which included his grandfather, a well-known Swiss painter, and his father, a Pulitzer-nominated writer and Cold War-era foreign correspondent. The Auberjonois family moved to Paris shortly after World War II, and it was there that René made an important career decision at the age of six. When his school put on a musical performance for the parents, little René was given the honor of conducting his classmates in a rendition of \"Do You Know the Muffin Man?\". When the performance was over, René took a bow, and, knowing that he was not the real conductor, imagined that he had been acting. He decided then and there that he wanted to be an actor. After leaving Paris, the Auberjonois family moved into an Artist's Colony in upstate New York.\n\nAt an early age, René was surrounded by musicians, composers and actors. Among his neighbors were Helen Hayes, Burgess Meredith and John Houseman, who would later become an important mentor. Houseman gave René his first theater job at the age of 16, as an apprentice at a theater in Stratford, Connecticut. René would later teach at Juilliard under Houseman. René attended Carnegie-Mellon University and studied theater completely, not only learning about acting but about the entire process of producing a play. After graduating from CMU, René acted with various theater companies, including San Francisco's American Conservatory Theater and Los Angeles' Mark Taper Forum. In 1969, he won a role in his first Broadway musical, \"Coco\" (with Katharine Hepburn), for which he won a Tony Award.\n\nThroughout his life, René acted in a variety of theater productions, films and television presentations, including a rather famous stint as Clayton Endicott III on the comedy series Benson (1979), not to mention seven years on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993) as Odo. René also performed dramatic readings of a variety of books on tape, and appeared in projects like Der Patriot (2000), starring Mel Gibson, Sally Hemings: An American Scandal (2000), and NBC's Frasier (1993) and ABC's Practice: Die Anwälte (1997).\n\nBlessed with a magnetic voice, the talented Barrett developed an early interest in performing when he use to frequent his aunt's local movie house. Born in Quinter, Kansas in 1957, he won the lead in his high school's production of \"Calamity Jane\" and was sold after that. He studied at Carnegie-Mellon and then eventually made his move to the New York scene.\n\nHe made his Broadway bow in 1980 when he was selected by Jerome Robbins to play Tony in the revival of \"West Side Story.\" He ventured on in both hits (\"March of the Falsettos\") and misses (\"Dance a Little Closer\") until 1983 when he earned the role of the handsome but dangerously off-centered Tony Barclay in daytime's New York-based soap All My Children (1970). As the third party in a romantic triangle, his character managed to drive a wedge between one of daytime's best loved couples at the time -- Jenny (Kim Delaney) and Greg (Laurence Lau). Brent himself received much flak from soap viewers after his character accidentally killed their favorite sweetheart while he was trying to kill off the boyfriend. Other lesser soap roles followed and he turned in a small but eye-catching cameo in the popular gay art-house film classic Freundschaft fürs Leben (1989) as a soap actor who performs a hot and heavy kissing scene on the tube.\n\nBrent's focus throughout his career, however, has been singing and a live theater audience. A sturdy performer who admittedly is a step behind when it comes to dancing, he has maintained his longstanding leading man status on sheer vocal power alone. He has a penchant for playing colorfully artificial characters and plays them with a grand theatricality reminiscent of the former matinée idols Howard Keel and Alfred Drake. Aided by his rich tenor and classic vibrato, his slick con men, shallow lovers, vainglorious thespians and eager jet-setters have boosted such 90s musicals as \"Grand Hotel,\" \"Chicago\" and \"Kiss Me Kate.\"\n\nOther sporadic film and TV credits include a guest role in an episode of the TV series \"Hustlin\" and the small, featured part as Brian the set designer in the filming of Mel Brooks' smash Broadway musical hit The Producers (2005). He also continues to present himself in concert form and with CD efforts.\n\nPaul Ben-Victor is an internationally recognized actor whose career spans four decades on stage, film, and television which includes his iconic performance as the Greek mobster Spiros Vondas on the acclaimed HBO series THE WIRE which has been called the greatest series of all-time.\n\nOne of the film world's most beloved performer, he has worked with groundbreaking directors including Martin Scorsese, Tony Scott, Antoine Fuqua, Steven Zaillian, and Clint Eastwood. Paul's recent work includes THE IRISHMAN opposite Al Pacino, PLANE with Gerard Butler, and EMANCIPATION opposite Will Smith. His other feature credits include starring alongside Samuel L. Jackson in THE BANKER, with Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell in GET HARD, Robert DeNiro and Sylvester Stallone in GRUDGE MATCH, along with classics like TOMBSTONE and TRUE ROMANCE further showcase his timeless appeal.\n\nIn television, Paul Ben-Victor has played a number of roles that have left a lasting cultural impact in many highly acclaimed series, including his portrayal of studio head Alan Gray in HBO's ENTOURAGE and appearing opposite Matthew McConaughey in the award winning TRUE DETECTIVE. Most recently, he was in PAM AND TOMMY with Lily James and Sebastian Stan and can next be seen in significant roles in the new KRISTEN BELL SHOW for Netflix, the LINCOLN LAWYER for Netflix, RAISING KANAN for Starz, BOOKIE for HBO Max and the international hit THE CHOSEN for Lionsgate. His other television credits include VINYL, IN PLAIN SIGHT, JOHN FROM CINCINNATI, NYPD BLUE, WILL & GRACE, THE MICK, EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS, PREACHER, and GOLIATH among many others.\n\nAdditionally, Ben-Victor received critical acclaim for his portrayal of iconic comedian 'Moe Howard' in the ABC biopic THE THREE STOOGES.\n\nPaul has worked on stage at the prestigious Longwharf Theater, the Seattle Repertory Theater, and on Broadway at The American Place Theater in New York. He is also a proud lifetime member of the renowned Actors Studio.\n\nLiam Bonner draws on a successful ten-year career in performance, having earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts in Vocal Performance from Carnegie Mellon University and his Master of Music in Voice from the Manhattan School of Music. In his career as an artist, Bonner was praised by Opera News for his \"rich, versatile voice\" and \"beautiful instrument\", highlights of his performing career include his Metropolitan Opera debut as Morales in Carmen and the role of Horatio in Hamlet, which was one of the Metropolitan Opera's HD broadcasts that season. He created the role of Lieutenant Audebert in the Pulitzer Prize winning opera, Silent Night, with Minnesota Opera and reprised the role with Opera Philadelphia and the Lyric Opera of Kansas City. Bonner's repertoire includes a majority of Britten baritone roles including the title role in Billy Budd with LA Opera, directed by Francesca Zambello and conducted by James Conlon, and Ned Keene in a concert version of Peter Grimes with the St Louis Symphony, performed at Carnegie Hall. He is very much at home in the French repertoire, performing such roles as Pelléas in Debussy's Pelléas and Mélisande with the Opera Theatre of St Louis, Zurga in Les pêcheurs de perles with New Orleans Opera, and the title role of Hamlet with Washington National Opera and conducted by Plácido Domingo. Liam enjoys a mostly stateside career, though notable international performances include Guglielmo in Così fan tutte with English National Opera in London, Henri de Valois in Chabrier's Le roi malgré lui with the Wexford Festival Opera in Wexford, Ireland, and The Elder Son in Britten's The Prodigal Son with Teatro dell'Opera Roma in Rome, Italy.\n\nBonner is a former member of the Houston Grand Opera Studio, as well as San Francisco Opera's Merola Program and a Studio and Apprentice Artist at Central City Opera. He is the recipient of a Richard F. Gold Career Grant from the Shoshanna Foundation, a first-prize winner of the Gerda Lissner Foundation Competition, a national semi-finalist in the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, and an award winner from the George London Foundation, the Lotte Lenya Competition, the First International Pavel Lisitsian Baritone Competition in Moscow, Russia, and the Houston Grand Opera's Eleanor McCollum Competition.\n\nBorn in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US as Christian Dominique Borle, he is an American actor and singer, best known for his many theatre performances and for his role in Smash (2012). His father Andre Bernard Borle was a professor of physiology at the University of Pittsburgh. He went to Shady Side Academy, where he auditioned for a school play, which got him interested in acting. In 1995 he graduated the School of Drama at Carnegie Mellon University, after which he moved to New York City, where his first job was acting as an elf at Macy's Santaland. His early jobs included the German production of \"The Who's Tommy\", the 1996 national tour of \"West Side Story\", and the first national tour of \"Footloose\". In 2000 he debuted on Broadway as an ensemble member in \"Jesus Christ Superstar\". In 2004, he was a member of the original Broadway Cast of \"Monty Python's Spamalot\", for which he earned a Drama Desk Award nomination as Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical and a Broadway Audience Award for Favorite Featured Actor in a Musical. Three years later he starred as Emmett Forrest in Legally Blonde: The Musical (2007), a role for which he received his first Tony Awards nomination, and a year after that he won his first Tony for his role as Black Stache in \"Peter and the Starcatcher\". From 2012 to 2013 he played one of the main characters in the TV series Smash (2012). In 2015 he won another Tony Award for his role as Shakespeare in \"Something Rotten!\". He continues to appear in musical theatre productions, such as \" Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", \"Little Shop of Horrors\", and \"Into the Woods\". He was married to Sutton Foster from 2006 to 2009.\n\nBarbara Bosson, who earned an Emmy Award nomination for her performance on Murder One (1995), was raised in Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania, a small coal-mining town about 30 miles south of Pittsburgh. When she was a teenager, she and her family moved to Florida, where she attended Boca Ciega High School in Gulfport. After graduation, she was accepted into the Drama Department of Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh (now Carnegie Mellon). When Bosson learned the tuition would be too great a burden on her parents, she instead moved to New York. She supported herself in a variety of jobs -- secretary, television production assistant, Playboy Bunny, etc. -- while studying acting with Milton Katselas and Herbert Berghof, and musical comedy with Word Baker. Six years later, Bosson reevaluated her prospects while working as a secretary for ACT (the American Conservatory Theater). She spoke frequently with various drama department heads, including Earl Gister, head of Carnegie Tech's Drama Department. Deciding it wasn't too late to pursue her dream, she asked Gister for an audition. He agreed. Bosson can't remember her audition, but it convinced Gister to place her in the school and to assist her in finding scholarship money. So, at 26, she became Carnegie Tech's oldest freshman. While attending Carnegie Tech, Bosson met her future husband, Steven Bochco (whom she would not marry until years later), and fellow Polizeirevier Hill Street (1981) stars Bruce Weitz and Charles Haid. On a summer break from Carnegie Tech, she landed a job in San Francisco with the improvisational group, \"The Committee\". With Gister's blessing, she stayed with the group and performed with them for three years. Bosson is a five-time Emmy Award nominee for Best Supporting Actress in a Dramatic Series for her portrayal of \"Fay Furillo\" in the Emmy Award-winning series, Polizeirevier Hill Street (1981). An innovative cook, Bosson raises her own herbs and vegetables. She enjoys skiing, doing crossword puzzles and dancing. Bosson also hates dieting, which she has done unsuccessfully for 25 years. Bosson and Steven Bochco have two children and reside in Los Angeles.\n\nAll this shapely character \"broad\" had to do was open her mouth to induce laughter--and so she did, primarily on TV during the '50s and '60s. And although she milked that unmistakable rasp for all its worth, she also showed great comedy sense. Born Jean Leete on February 23, 1923, in Charleston, West Virginia, actress Jean Carson (not to be confused with pert British actress Jeannie Carson of Hey, Jeannie! (1956) TV fame) was trained in music and dance and started performing by age 12. With high aspirations of becoming an actress, she subsequently studied at Carnegie-Mellon University.\n\nShe was first discovered appearing on Broadway in 1948 in George S. Kaufman's \"Bravo!\" with a cast including Kevin McCarthy and Oscar Homolka. Set in New York, the show was a bust (running only 44 performances), but Jean made a wonderful comic impression and earned a Theatre World award in the process. She followed this with another Kaufman-staged play, \"Metropole,\" in 1949 as well as \"The Bird Cage\" (1950) with Melvyn Douglas and Maureen Stapleton and \"Men of Distinction\" (1953) with Robert Preston, but these shows fared just as badly. A hit Broadway comedy finally came her way with \"Anniversary Waltz\" in 1954, which ran 544 performances. Jean stood out among the cast just for those inimitable deep tones alone.\n\nShe was typically on display throughout the '50s and '60s, gracing many of the popular shows of the day, including \"The Red Buttons Show,\" \"The Tom Ewell Show,\" \"Wagon Train,\" \"Sugarfoot,\" \"Perry Mason,\" \"The Untouchables\" and \"Gomer Pyle.\" Surprisingly, she never had her own TV sitcom, although she did appear as a regular on the short-lived The Betty Hutton Show (1959) playing a girlfriend to the star. A single standout episode of \"The Twilight Zone\" had Jean and Fred Clark as a pair of thieves who discover that a camera they've stolen takes pictures of the future. Jean essayed a number of bleached blonde floozies, jailbirds, party girls and gold diggers over the course of her career but was never better than as both convict Jalene Naomi and good time girl Daphne on The Andy Griffith Show (1960). In one classic episode, her character Jalene was partnered up with cohorts Jane Dulo and Reta Shaw as three dames hiding out from the law who hold both Deputy Barney and Floyd hostage while putting designs on them at the same time.\n\nAn unfortunate alcohol problem dogged Jean's career for many years. Active with Alcoholics Anonymous, she eventually retired from Hollywood in the early 1980s and moved to the Palm Springs area to be closer to family. There she appeared occasionally in such local theater productions as \"The Elephant Man\" and \"Steel Magnolias.\" Jean had been in spiraling health since suffering a paralytic stroke in September of 2005. She died in a Palm Desert convalescent home on November 2, 2005, at age 82. Two sons survive.\n\nA brawny, firm-jawed, sandy-haired player of 60s and 70s primetime TV, Frank Converse seemed to be one of those handsome tough-guy action figures that could go by the wayside after the demise of their famous series. Instead, this stage-trained actor persevered as a well-respected, all-purpose character actor in a career that has now passed its fourth decade.\n\nBorn on May 2, 1938 in St. Louis, Missouri, Frank received his early education at the Phillips Andover Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and earned his BFA degree in drama in 1962 at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh. In the 1960s he built up his Shakespearean resume with roles in \"King Lear\", \"Caesar and Cleopatra\", \"Hamlet\", \"The Comedy of Errors\", \"Richard III\", \"Henry V\" and \"Much Ado About Nothing\" before making his 1966 Broadway debut in \"First One Asleep, Whistle\", which closed that same day. By this time he had set his sights on film but it was strong-armed TV drama that made him a name.\n\n1967 was a banner year for Frank. Not only did he appear to good advantage in the films Die fünf Geächteten (1967) as Virgil Earp, and the Southern-baked melodrama Morgen ist ein neuer Tag (1967), he earned surprise stardom in his first TV vehicle Das Geheimnis der blauen Krone (1967). Probably best remembered for this short-lived series (filmed in 1965, but televised as a summer replacement series from May to September 1967), Converse played the very mysterious Michael Alden, who was roughed up and dumped unceremoniously into the New York harbor by would-be assassins. Left for dead and having lost his memory, the only key to his past are the code words \"Coronet Blue\". Although audiences never found out just what those words meant (the show ended abruptly and without a proper conclusion), they at least now knew the name Frank Converse.\n\nFrom there the actor ventured on (still in a New York City setting) with the police drama Heiße Spuren (1967). He fared better this time around alongside co-stars Jack Warden and Robert Hooks as three plainclothes detectives tracking down the city's most virulent. This show lasted until 1969. His third and last major series co-starred burly trucker Claude Akins in the big-rig action-adventure Abenteuer der Landstraße (1974). In all three series, Converse owned a quiet, reserved, somewhat detached quality that invited \"mystery man\" appeal. During this stage of his popularity he starred or co-starred in a number of mini-movies including Dr. Cook's Garden (1971) with Bing Crosby and Blythe Danner, A Tattered Web (1971), The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd (1974), Tod an Bord (1977), Cruise Into Terror (1978) and, most notably, Sergeant Matlovich vs. the U.S. Air Force (1978). He also guested on such popular 70s shows as \"The Mod Squad\", \"Medical Center\", \"Police Story\", \"Rhoda\" \"The Love Boat\", \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\" and \"The Bionic Woman\". Despite his hectic TV schedule, he continued to return to his theater roots appearing in the original cast of John Guares bizarre black comedy \"The House of Blue Leaves\" (1971) and earning challenging parts in \"The Seagull\" in 1973 and \"Hobson's Choice\" in 1977.\n\nHaving achieved semi-hunk status as a result of his trio of series work, Frank could have easily drifted away by decade's end. Instead he continued to impressed on the stage. In the 1980s he made a strong return to Broadway opposite Blythe Danner in \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1980) and later appeared as Mitch opposite Danner's Blanche DuBois in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1988). Other 80s Broadway shows included \"Brothers (1983) and \"Design for Living\" (1984), the latter in which he replaced actor Frank Langella. Other productions around the country included that of \"The Crucible\", \"Death of a Salesman\", \"A Man for All Seasons\", \"Misalliance\", \"The Shadow Box\", \"Two for the Seesaw\" and even the musical \"South Pacific\".\n\nOn the TV/film front, Frank showed up in stalwart character form on a number of daytime soaps during the 1980s (\"One Life to Live\") and the 1990s (\"As the World Turns\", \"All My Children\"). A return to series TV with The Family Tree (1983) and Dolphin Cove (1989) were again very short-lived. More recently he showed up on stage as Doc Gibb in \"Our Town\", which starred Paul Newman and was later televised, and has been a guest star on such shows as \"Law & Order\". He has been married to his third wife, Tony-nominated stage actress Maureen Anderman, since 1982. They have two children along with his two children from a previous marriage."
