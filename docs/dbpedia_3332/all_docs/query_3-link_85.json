        "text": "SONGWRITING LESSONS WRAP-UP\n\nI had such a great time with my students during my first songwriting class, it was a total blast and honour to walk through some of the basics of songwriting with them! All three completed a song from scratch with excellent results, here is a little video of Wayne Corner singing The Watchmen.\n\nIf you would like to sign up for the next High River lesson track starting May 6 then just email me!! karla@karlaadolphe.ca\n\nIf you would like to book Skype lessons or bring me in to teach a 4 hour class in your town email me!! karla@karlaadolphe.ca\n\nMANY thanks!\n\nFriends! I am so excited to announce a new season of music engagement with me; vocal and songwriting workshops!!!\n\nI have loved facilitating workshops throughout the years in both vocal performance and songwriting and thought it might be time to offer more opportunities to be creative together!

Private Lessons - Local or via Skype\n\nFor those of you who might be interested in songwriting or vocal coaching 1-on-1 with me I would love to talk with you about teaching you either here in High River, Calgary (and area) or via Skype!\n\nLessons for vocal coaching are 30 min and songwriting are 60 min.\n\nEmail me to learn more about pricing and scheduling!\n\n* * * Youth and Adult Vocal Performance Workshops coming in May! * * *\n\nAs always, workshops are offered for any locations, email me to chat more about arranging a workshop in conjunction with my next tour in your area!\n\nOH MY GOSH! I had a total blast playing at TOP Festival in Medicine Hat on Jan 31, I only wish i had more time to enjoy all it had to offer!\n\nTongue On The Post Festival runs the last week of January every year, with Cafe Concerts throughout the city during the week, a Singer / Songwriter Night and all day festivities at the historic Medalta Potteries.\n\nI enjoyed playing both the Yuill Gallery Stage with Jordan Bissonnette from Winnipeg, the crowd was energetic and welcoming; I even reverse heckled (heckling from stage) a handsome lumberjack named Cory :)\n\nHere is a photo taken by High Riverite Cathy Bennington of me and fellow musician Annie De Groot playing inside a HUGE kiln! Yes people, it was amazing, I was both excited and overwhelmed by playing inside one of the large kilns used to make world famous Medalta pottery! Once I got my bearings inside the space, I loved how the cavernous room afforded us some very interesting natural reverb, wow was it moody!\n\nOverall, this festival is one of my top 5 festival experiences to date, the volunteers were so knowledgable and friendly and obvious music lovers, the Directors, Rob and Shannon were welcoming and so kind and the music was stellar! I WILL return, you should join me next year!\n\nlearn more at www.topfest.ca\n\nJan 28……..you are a special date, the calendar stops for you, time takes a longer breath for you, the morning mercies are even a little kinder for you.\n\nFour years ago I witnessed profound beauty, heard the ripping sounds of fierce parent hearts forced to let go after only 12 years together, the day Hadley gracefully slipped past the thin veil and into another realm. Four years ago today, around this very moment, I expected fear but saw beauty, tasted anguish and felt the breath of God.\n\nTwo years later, this very same day, the day my second child was expected to be born. The day I felt so much jealousy for kindred babies arriving in late January, the bitterness of winter without new life. That too has eased but I still remember and still wonder about many babies whose faces have not felt the warmth of the sun.\n\nAnd what of this pain that tempts me to bury myself beside the bones and the skin? I resist you.\n\nBeauty is a jealous as the grave, it wants to live in bold colours and sounds, it wants to promote the remembering, it wants life!\n\nSo today I honour those of you who let me into the grief, pain, shame, hopelessness and heartache. Especially for the McHughs, who invited me to sing to Hadley as she entered heaven, I am forever grateful and humbled, your courage and generosity has birthed life and fearlessness!\n\nTo the brokenhearted/depressed/lonely/grieving/shattered\n\nI see what you lost so that we could gain\n\nToday I am reminded and re-dedicate Honeycomb Tombs to all of you who shared your grief stories, entrusted to me in hope, so that together we could create the album and share those songs with fellow kin on the brokenhearted pathway. Thank you.\n\nK\n\nCan we just take a moment to enjoy the immensely gorgeous poetry of Christina Rossetti, written in 1872.\n\nIn the bleak mid-winter\n\nFrosty wind made moan,\n\nEarth stood hard as iron,\n\nWater like a stone;\n\nSnow had fallen, snow on snow,\n\nSnow on snow,\n\nIn the bleak mid-winter\n\nLong ago.\n\nOur God, Heaven cannot hold Him\n\nNor earth sustain;\n\nHeaven and earth shall flee away\n\nWhen He comes to reign:\n\nIn the bleak mid-winter\n\nA stable-place sufficed\n\nThe Lord God Almighty,\n\nJesus Christ.\n\nEnough for Him, whom cherubim\n\nWorship night and day,\n\nA breastful of milk,\n\nAnd a mangerful of hay;\n\nEnough for Him, whom angels\n\nFall down before,\n\nThe ox and ass and camel\n\nWhich adore.\n\nAngels and archangels\n\nMay have gathered there,\n\nCherubim and seraphim\n\nThronged the air -\n\nBut only His mother\n\nIn her maiden bliss\n\nWorshipped the Beloved\n\nWith a kiss.\n\nWhat can I give Him,\n\nPoor as I am?\n\nIf I were a shepherd\n\nI would bring a lamb;\n\nIf I were a wise man\n\nI would do my part;\n\nYet what I can, I give Him -\n\nGive my heart.\n\nI discovered this hymn as I was researching some recent Christmas recordings, both Sufjan Stevens and Sarah McLachlan have recorded it, among other artists. I was struck by the intense beauty of the poetry and how this song perfectly described the visual images I wanted to create both with the cover art and the themes covered in the album. It was truly perfect, basically a mission statement for this album.\n\nAs you may notice the song sounds very different than the other tracks because we recorded it “live” with a few mics and no overdubs. Again the old piano makes an appearance and the elements of the room are deftly captured by Heath. I hope you like the old timey sound we aimed for with this song, imagine yourself fireside at the old farmhouse on the longest night of the year.\n\nK\n\nDownload Lingering"
