        "text": "Book Review - Actor's Alchemy: Finding the Gold in the Script\n\nReview by Rob Hartmann\n\nACTOR’S ALCHEMY: Finding the Gold in the Script. By Bruce Miller. 188 pp. Limelight Editions, an imprint of Hal Leonard, 2011. $16.99 (paperback); ISBN 978-0-87910-383-5\n\nIn his book Actor’s Alchemy: Finding the Gold in the Script, Bruce Miller lays out a very detailed, yet easy to understand process of script analysis for actors. Speaking as a writer, I hope all young actors read Mr. Miller’s book and absorb his advice on ways to understand and communicate a playwright’s work.\n\nI have seen many student actors make common missteps: they generalize, approach scenes passively, exhibit “fuzzy thinking”, and fail to really make use of the words of the script. The ability to be specific versus general in one’s acting choices is, in my opinion, the chief skill which defines the professional, trained actor. Mr. Miller points out that it is impossible to be specific if you have only a general comprehension of the story you are trying to tell. Some beginning actors, when advised to “be specific”, don’t know what to do – only because they have never had the nuts-and-bolts of what specificity means explained to them in a useful manner. Mr. Miller, who is the Director of Acting Programs at the University of Miami, has seized on this pervasive problem, and focused his book almost completely on enabling actors to fully understand the scripts they are trying to bring to life.\n\nMr. Miller takes the reader step by step through the process of breaking down a script into its smallest components; he then explores all the options available to the actor once they understand the script thoroughly – everything an actor might do to take specific, effective action. Unlike many books on script analysis, Actor’s Alchemy makes the connection between understanding and doing very clear.\n\nAlthough this book is probably most useful for young actors (Mr. Miller mentions his work with students a number of times in the book), I think any actor who would like a concise refresher on analyzing a script and finding strong acting choices would find this book worth reading. I believe Mr. Miller’s advice would be especially helpful in giving nuanced readings of sides at an audition, when actors are often forced by necessity to deliver a scene with little or no knowledge of the larger context of the play.\n\nMr. Miller’s tone is engaging – clear, authoritative, never dull. The book explores its subject comprehensively, yet is a fairly quick read. Mr. Miller has a true knack for storytelling, which not all textbook authors do; I was halfway through the book before I realized it. Perhaps it’s unusual to describe an educational book such as this as a “page turner”, but I believe this book qualifies.\n\nLike all books which aim to teach a specific skill, Mr. Miller’s work is at its strongest when he is dealing with concrete examples. The book contains the full text of the short one-act Eye to Eye, by Chris Graybill; Mr. Miller dissects the play in a number of ways, showing the reader exactly what steps one needs to take to be fully prepared to begin rehearsals.\n\nMany books on script analysis for the actor don’t think to go further than talking about what the actor can do with his or her dialogue; Mr. Miller includes a section about the importance of being fully present when another character is speaking. The chapter begins:\n\nEven when watching classroom scenework, it’s pretty easy to tell which actors have equipped themselves to enter the marketplace and sustain a career. They’re the ones who can bring their strong analysis skills to the scene and know how to make choices based on what they have learned from the script, yes; but these are the ones who can also listen as well as give and take onstage. ... [A]nalysis and synthesis are essential for making choices about character and story action, but listening and reacting in the moment is every bit as important, and ultimately you must make all of these aspects work together.\n\nThe chapter goes on to describe some interesting exercises which can help improve and sharpen one’s ability to be an active listener onstage.\n\nThere are certain books intended for actors and directors which I recommend to writers as well; I have now added Actor’s Alchemy to that list. Mr. Miller’s thoughts about how to “find the gold” in a script (he mines the alchemy analogy thoroughly) I believe will be inspiring and instructive for playwrights: in order for actors to find any gold, we have to make sure we’re creating work which contains gold for them to discover.\n\nAny actor, student or professional, who wants to improve his or her skill at unearthing every possible layer of meaning and action in a dramatic text, would do well to read Mr. Miller’s concise yet thorough book. In an audition or a rehearsal, the techniques Mr. Miller describes will give dedicated actors effective tools to focus and sharpen their performances. To borrow the author’s alchemy analogy – this book just may be the key to transform base metal into gold.\n\nRob Hartmann is a composer, lyricist and bookwriter on the faculty of New York University’s Graduate Musical Theater Writing Program; his works have been produced in a number of theaters across the country.\n\nAlbum Review - The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\n\nBy Sherry Shaffer\n\nThe musical theatre adaptation of James Thurber’s The Secret Life of Walter Mitty with music by Leon Carr, lyrics by Earl Shuman, and book by Joe Manchester, opened at the Player’s Theater in October, 1964. The show ran for 96 performances but nevertheless got good reviews for its short run. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is set on the 40th birthday of the title character, a constant daydreamer who is unhappy with his lot in life. Those who are familiar with the original short story and the 1947 film with Danny Kaye will see similarities with the theme and the wild fantasies he cooks up, but the storyline differs considerably. In fact, I’d consider it “inspired by” as opposed to adapted. In this version, Mitty decides to give up his boring, harried life and pursue excitement with a faded lounge singer. Like most of his ideas, it never gets past the fantasy stage and in the end he chooses to stay with his family – mainly for love of his daughter, Penninah.\n\nNot having seen this musical, I needed a full synopsis to follow the songs on the album – and I highly recommend any first-time listener do the same. I do not consider this a flaw, however, as Mitty’s fantasies are just that, fantasies. It stands to reason that they would not follow a linear storyline. They disrupt Mitty’s life, and that comes through on the album. Songs like “Drip, Drop, Tapoketa” – tapoketa being a sound effect from the original story – and “Fan the Flame” would throw you for a complete loop if you didn’t know they were daydreams about performing life-saving surgery and watching the lounge singer, Willa de Wisp, perform in the “Folies de Mitty” as a comic French chanteuse.\n\nThe music is light and fun, as fits the general theme of the show. All the featured singers handle the material well – it’s not demanding, but they do need to be both funny and feeling in turns. Most of the songs are enjoyable but fairly standard for the time; I can’t quite put my finger on it, but you can tell it was written in 1964. It has that early mod era feeling that straddles the square fifties and the loose sixties. I won’t call it dated, as I think one can still relate to wanting to escape a hum-drum life, but it isn’t evergreen material either.\n\nHowever, two songs – “Don’t Forget” and “Two Little Pussycats” – were real standouts that I went back and listed to a couple of times. “Don’t Forget” is a great comic number that showcases the constant nagging and boredom Mitty endures. Marc London as Mitty, Lorraine Serabian, as Agnes, his wife, and Susan Lehman as Mitty’s mother-in-law do a great job of weaving the nagging of the ladies through Mitty’s distraction and sorrow at growing older. Rue McClanahan and Lette Rehnolds are the “little pussycats” – women seduced by a scoundrel friend of Mitty then dropped – whose song is a jazzy lament of broken promises.\n\nThe Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a fun album that is great for a retro evening with martinis and hors d’oeuvres. Top it off with a skinny tie or chandelier earrings and enjoy the rich fantasy life of a very average man.\n\nThe Secret Life of Walter Mitty\n\nOriginal Release Date: February 15, 2011\n\nLabel: Masterworks Broadway\n\nCopyright: Originally Released 1964 Sony Music Entertainment\n\nWalter Mitty: Marc London\n\nMother-in-law: Susan Lehman\n\nAgnes: Lorraine Serabian\n\nPeninnah: Christopher Norris\n\nWilla de Wisp: Cathryn Damon\n\nIrving Kornfeld: Charles Rydell\n\nFred Gorman: Eugene Roche\n\nHarry: Rudy Tronto\n\nHazel: Rue McClanahan\n\nRuthie: Lette Rehnolds\n\nMusic by Leon Carr\n\nLyrics by Earl Shuman\n\nBook by Joe Manchester\n\nMusical Direction: Joe Stecko\n\nThe Family Shakespeare\n\nBy Byrne Harrison\n\nIf you've ever tried to watch \"The Sopranos,\" \"Sex and the City\" or a similar made-for-cable show on a \"family\" network, then you will fully appreciate what Thomas Bowdler was trying to do when he rewrote Shakespeare's plays to make them more \"acceptable.\" No off-color jokes, no blasphemy (or even questioning of God and man's place in creation), no suicide for Ophelia - all of this was unacceptable to Thomas (and his father who first rewrote these plays for his children).\n\nHis idea of the perfect world was one that was pretty, inoffensive, and heavily censored.\n\nIt is no real surprise that the Bowdler family, as portrayed in David Stallings' The Family Shakespeare, is not nearly as pretty and neat as Bowdler himself might have portrayed them. Stallings' version of the Bowdler family shows them as damaged individuals. Henrietta (Cotton Wright) is a fragile, child-like woman trapped in a world of fantasy. Jane (Corey Tazmania) is bitter about her lot in life and her physical disabilities. John (Eric C. Bailey) is promiscuous leaving a string of bastard children behind him. And Thomas himself (Jason Emanuel) is conflicted about his desire to live away from his family and the close, and somewhat inappropriate bond he has with Henrietta.\n\nThe play centers around Henrietta and her discovery that the Shakespeare that she grew up with and that her brother will eventually publish, is not the Shakespeare that the rest of the world knows. She becomes consumed by the \"new\" plays that she has discovered, and retreats further into her world of make-believe. When her passion for storytelling leads an impressionable boy (Frankie Seratch) to leap from a window (thinking he, like The Tempest's Ariel, could fly), it forces a confrontation with Thomas and the rest of her family and makes her question all the things that she had simply accepted as given up until that point.\n\nWhile not as fully explored, Stallings creates a nice counter-point to the Bowdler family with his inclusion of the servant class, especially new maid Dorcas (Alexandra Cohen-Spiegler) and her mother Mrs. Tinsley (Diánna Martin). Though not blessed with the upbringing that the Bowdler's have, they are completely realistic about the way the world works. While Thomas and his kin might want to hide what is unseemly, their servants acknowledge and profit by it.\n\nThe cast features some excellent performances, notably Cotton Wright's amazing work as the naive Henrietta and Corey Tazmania's powerful performance as Jane. Eric C. Bailey does an extraordinary job as the genial, but predatory John.\n\nProduction values are strong, especially Rachel Dozier-Ezell's marvelous 18th Century costumes and Blair Mielnik's set.\n\nThere is quite a bit going for this production, however, it could use some tightening up. Although director Antonio Miniño does a good job overall (I especially like how he handles fantasy scenes - those times when Henrietta's very active imagination brings her stories to life), there are times when the momentum of the performance flags, most notably in some of the weaker scenes in Stallings' script.\n\nThe Family Shakespeare is an interesting play, and the topics it raises, especially the insidious nature of censorship, are extremely timely. Featuring strong performances and a thought-provoking script, MTWorks has created another production to be proud of.\n\nAnd one final thought, if you are not in the habit of reading the program, make an exception this time. David Stallings has written a marvelous note about the play which touches on his inspiration, the power of imagination and censorship, and \"that moment where you put your art into the world and no longer have any control over it.\" It's a nice piece of writing and a great complement to his play.\n\nThe Family Shakespeare\n\nBy David Stallings\n\nDirector: Antonio Miniño\n\nProducer: Martha Goode\n\nSet Designer: Blair Mielnik\n\nCostume Designer: Rachel Dozier-Ezell\n\nLighting Designer: Dan Gallagher\n\nComposer: Jessie Montgomery\n\nProduction Stage Manager: Carolynn Richer\n\nAssistant Stage Manager: Jean Marie Hufford\n\nDialect Coach: David Malcolm Wells\n\nMarketing Directors: Louise Flory, Russell Jordan, Robin Madel\n\nGraphic Designer: Lindsay Moore\n\nPress Representative: Katie Rosin, Kampfire PR\n\nProducing Consultant: Michael Roderick, Small Pond Entertainment\n\nFeaturing: Eric C.

We seemed to get a slow start, but now with only a few days left, people have really begun to chip in and right now we're less than $450 from our goal of $4,000.\n\nTell me a little bit about Sweeter Dreams.\n\nIt's a story about love and art; it's about an independent filmmaker who is torn between the two men she loves: her husband and the handsome actor who inspires her and appears in her movies. And meanwhile a television critic seems to have a grudge against her films. There are four people onstage and a large cast onscreen in multimedia filmed segments.\n\nIs this your first time incorporating film?\n\nYes, it is. I wrote the first draft of this play almost 10 years ago, and the script has been languishing in a virtual drawer since I didn't have the know-how. But last year I worked as a technician on Before Icarus Fell, a multimedia puppetry piece by my friend Tony Chiroldes, and realized that with modern technology it's relatively easy to do, though still more complicated than the sort of play I'm used to.\n\nWho is your team for the show?\n\nMy friend Christopher Cariker of Hanging Hammer Productions will be doing the filming. I've worked with him as an actor in a several of my shows, and he used me as an actor in his \"Ass Masters\" parody video. I've written the scripts for the film clips and fake movie trailers, and he'll be in charge of the HD filming and editing.\n\nKickstarter allows you to reward your investors. What sort of incentives are you offering?\n\nFor $25 or more I will write a poem on the subject and in the style of your choice.\n\nFor $150 or more you get two tickets to the show.\n\nFor $200 or more you get two tickets to the show and an invite to an exclusive after-party with the cast.\n\nFor $400 or more you can get a non-speaking cameo in one of the multimedia portions of the show.\n\nWhen do you find out if your project has funded?\n\nWell, Kickstarter keeps a running tally of how much money has been pledged - I believe we'll know right away as soon as someone pushes us over the limit. But we'll know after our deadline (Friday Apr 29th, 6:09am), if it hasn't been funded. So we have about 3 days left, and (at this moment) only $430 to go to reach our goal.\n\nTo find out more about Duncan's show or to become a sponsor, visit the Sweeter Dreams Kickstarter page.\n\nGoodbye, Dear Elizabeth\n\nBy Elizabeth Claire Taylor\n\nThis is how I dealt with the death of my namesake: I didn't watch \"Cleopatra.\" I didn't watch \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.\" I didn't watch \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" Nope. Not even \"Butterfield 8.\"\n\nI did a photo shoot. Why?\n\nSeeing her in live action would be too intimate – too real. For anyone, watching Elizabeth Taylor on screen is a powerful experience. But for me, as she is whom I was named after, it transcends “watching” a film. Unlike other actors whom we see on screen and feel pangs of longing for their grace, their beauty, etc – Elizabeth Taylor and I shared that direct link: our name.\n\nSince childhood, it has always been impossible for me to sit through one of her films and not feel intense desires: adoration, yearning, jealously, love, fear, sadness. I'd like to confess that I have out grown all of that – that I can simply take her name and nothing else, but that would be a lie. I think her mega-watt bulb was too strong for me to ignore, even as a confused 8 year old, staring at the People magazine covers of her 8th marriage. Recognizing my name in bold purple print but not my face on the cover.\n\nI'm emotional now, even as I write this, realizing that yes, she is gone and yet, you live on. You live on with a name that belonged to as USA Today claimed the “Biggest Star Ever” And yet, you – Elizabeth Claire Taylor – are not an accountant, nor a librarian like my savvy mother. No, you are an actor. A thespian. A drama queen. A diva. And maybe one day, a star.\n\nGoing to drama school at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts tore down what I had conventionally thought a 'star' was – they yelled at us Freshman year, “You were ALL the leads in your high school musicals – get over it!” Egos ripped apart, some students made it to graduation, some did not. Greek tragedy was studied – Kabuki theatre – Noh – but more importantly, we were imbued with a sense of duty to our art. The possibility of social change. “Think about it like this: you could be playing Nora in A Doll's House and in the audience that night, an abused housewife could see your performance and say, okay – that's it – I'm going to leave.”\n\nI got chills down my spine the day I heard that, and everything changed. I realized that, yes, you could have the beauty and glamour of a star but it had to be rooted in the right concepts, concepts greater than you. Coming out of the haze of an eating disorder that had crippled my creativity and my spirit while at NYU I started telling my story – I started plus-size modeling – my world and the world around me was changing.\n\nI had always heard of Elizabeth Taylor's commitment to AIDS research and diligent activism, but this was in the present looking back – it was only when I read a ton of biographies did I grasp how bold it was for her to speak out in the 1980's – when celebrity activism was unheard of, particularly in regards to something so taboo and shrouded in stigma as AIDS.\n\nWhen I realized the through-line of my solo show Finding Elizabeth Taylor was a call to arms for young women to refute the corporate blitz on their bodies and minds, I saw the link. I recently saw solo performer Sarah Jones's work and she mentioned performing for the UN and White House councils on girls and women. Ah! The honor! “One day” I silently said to myself, “One day...”\n\nI want to look back on my life and believe I did the best I could with the gifts I was given.\n\nMy show's growing success over the past 4 years has been encouraging - Elizabeth Taylor's name creates quite a buzz, regardless, but people love that it actually IS my real name (why would someone do this to themselves otherwise??) and I have a story to go with it. “So tell me, did you parents really name you after her?” “Did your parents do that on purpose?” “What were they thinking?!” Sorry, you have to see my show to find out!\n\nAnd I knew Elizabeth was sick. I knew she had just turned 79 on February 27th – a Pisces, born in London to American ex-pat parents. I knew so much about her that her death felt like that of a family member. It was always a comfort, knowing she was alive. Like a guardian angel watching over me. Knowing that I really didn't have to live with that name all by myself. That it still belonged to someone else.\n\nMarch 23rd I woke up to 5 text messages, half a dozen emails and my Facebook had exploded.\n\nI called my mother and father first – with much tears, my mother saying back to me, “We are so glad we named you after her”. And finally, I called my friend and mentor Camryn Manheim. Sobbing to her I said, “My show – my show! What am I going to do about my show?”\n\n“You have to address it – you have to work it in. And look at it this way – now you're free.”\n\nFree? Free. Free from this name. Free from my life in her shadow. A diamond encrusted, brunette vixen of a shadow, but a shadow none the less. But do I ever really want to be free of it? I can't imagine my life without it. It IS my life. If you take her away, then who actually am I? We're getting existential here, I know – but this is why her death hits me so hard.\n\nI took myself to Spa Castle that cold and rainy day, as ET would have appreciated – (she was known to be quite the frequent bather) and I sat in the lavender jacuzzi thinking, “Well, there will be all the covers of the newspapers tomorrow, then People magazine and Time next week, then the weekend long movie marathons on AMC and the 60 Minutes retrospectives – culminating with an over the top Oscar tribute next year – but then...it's over.” It's over. Then I'm the only one. Just me.\n\nHer legacy will always be there in my life but not as sharp, not as in focus as she has been while alive.\n\nAnd make no mistake, the timing is amazing – I'll be performing Finding Elizabeth Taylor as part of the Planet Connections Theatre Festivity the last two weeks of this coming June. April was the month my director, Morgan Gould and I were going to rewrite and tweak the script. May was rehearsal and publicity. Think about it: Elizabeth could have passed the week of my show. The morning of my opening night! This was a blessing. I am blessed.\n\nSo how I said goodbye to my namesake was a photo shoot.\n\nOver the years I have re-created famous photos of Elizabeth Taylor as publicity for my show. Instead of sitting in bed with my Netflix streaming Cleo or Cat (as I have done numerous times in my life), I sat in front of a mirror and applied false eyelashes and fake nails.\n\nHere's \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\":\n\n\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\":\n\nand the ever popular \"Cleopatra\":\n\nThe Daily News, The Post, and USA Today all had gorgeous, typical photos of Elizabeth for their obit story. Full color, alluring, cleavage, eyes – the seductress. I got two copies of each – one for my mother – and held them close to my chest as precious bounty. “Only 50 cents?” I said at the newsstand while buying The Post. The man smiled to me and said in a thick accent, “50 cents and Cleopatra” while handing me my change. I cried on the train heading downtown.\n\nBut when I spread them all out on my kitchen floor, the one that stood out to me was the New York Times cover. A simple black and white photo, Elizabeth with her head turned to the side – looking far away – a stunning broach on her off the shoulder dress – with the headline “A Lustrous Pinnacle of Hollywood Glamour” underneath.\n\nI stared at that photo long and hard, wondering to myself: will I ever be as beautiful? Will I ever be as talented? Will I ever be as loved? As adored? As idolized? As demonized? If I put myself out there, will I be compared? Villainized? Insulted? Laughed at?\n\nThen I calmed myself down and realized it was just my ego talking. I have my own path – my own story – and yes, they do converge at times – and yes, we do share the same name, much like a line of Queens – but only destiny will decide where the similarities truly begin.\n\nSo here is my interpretation of this iconic photo of Elizabeth Taylor – one that may not be as familiar as some of the others – but one that has significant meaning to me as a reminder of the sun setting on one life and rising on another.\n\nFINDING ELIZABETH TAYLOR\n\nGene Frankel Theatre\n\n24 Bond Street\n\nNY, NY\n\n6/15@ 6pm, 6/16@ 5pm, 6/19@ 4pm,\n\n6/20@ 8:30pm, 6/22@ 5:30pm, 6/25@ 5pm\n\nTickets and info:\n\n\"The Tallest Building in the World\" About the Building of the World Trade Center Previews Tonight\n\nIt was the 1960’s – a time to reach for the sky! Luna Stage proudly presents the world premiere of The Tallest Building in the World by Matt Schatz, an entertaining and inspiring new play about the construction of the World Trade Center Towers---one of the grandest achievements in the history of engineering. The production runs for five weeks, Thursdays through Sundays, beginning on Thursday, April 14th, with the first of five preview performances. Opening night is Friday, April 22nd, and the show closes on Sunday, May 15th. All Thursday performances begin at 7:30pm, Fridays and Saturdays are at 8pm, and Sunday matinees are at 2pm through May 15th, 2011. Tickets are on sale now, $20-$30, on the Luna Stage website, www.lunastage.org, or by calling 973-395-5551. The theatre is located at 555 Valley Road, West Orange, NJ, in the heart of the Valley Arts District of Orange and West Orange.\n\nWith equal measures of ego and genius, a low level bureaucrat at The Port Authority sets out to build the world’s tallest building — an easy task, as long as he can get his architect, his engineer, the owner of the Empire State Building, and the Laws of Physics to cooperate. Based on actual events, The Tallest Building in the World examines the 1960s birth of the World Trade Center towers and the partnerships and friendships that were tested along the way.\n\nDavid Bonanno leads the outstanding cast of five as “Gino”, the engineer turned bureaucrat who must manage all the temperaments and egos to get his project off the ground. Mr. Bonanno has appeared on Broadway in Light in the Piazza, directed by Bartlett Sher at Lincoln Center Theater, and recently completed a tour with Christopher Lloyd as Howard in Death of a Salesman.\n\nPun Bandhu portrays “Yama”, the temperamental and reluctant architect who must reinvent his craft to rise to this challenge. Mr. Bandhu received his MFA from the Yale School of Drama and was in the world premieres of AR Gurney's Far East (Williamstown Theatre Festival, directed by Daniel Sullivan) and Theresa Rebeck's The Bells (McCarter Theatre Center, directed by Emily Mann), among others. He can be seen in the upcoming film \"Two Days in New York\" opposite Chris Rock.\n\nKane Prestenback plays “Lee”, the brash young engineer whose revolutionary ideas hold the key to the project’s success or failure. Kane recently made his London Theatrical debut at The Old Vic with the TS Eliot US/UK Exchange, hosted by Kevin Spacey, in Anna Moench's Halo/Titanic.\n\nRounding out the cast are two ensemble players who give life to all of the opposing forces: The Port Authority, displaced Radio Row merchants, and even an iconic building or two.\n\nDrew Dix founded a theater company in the West Village (Theater In Action) and directed the company’s operations from 1981-1991. He has performed at the North Carolina Shakespeare Festival, the 78th St. Theater Lab and various theatres on Theatre Row and does voice over work with Motion Capture Studios in Manhattan.\n\nNehassaiu deGannes performed with Alec Baldwin in EQUUS at Guild Hall. Additionally, she has performed in numerous productions at LaMAMA in NYC and regionally at Trinity Rep.\n\nPlaywright Matt Schatz is also a lyricist, composer, and bookwriter whose other full-length plays and musicals include Love Trapezoid, a finalist at the O’Neill National Music Theater Conference and Yale Institute for Music Theatre; Exchanges, with music by Michael Kooman; and The Baby is Blue. He is a three-time recipient of an EST/Sloan Commission and has been a finalist for the Fred Ebb Award and the Page 73 Playwriting Fellowship.\n\nTroy Miller, who is directing the production, holds an MFA in Directing from Trinity Rep in Providence, RI, and is making his Luna Stage debut with The Tallest Building in the World. He has been a finalist for the Sir John Gielgud and Mark Okrent Fellowships. His past directing credits include Craig Lucas’ Bathroom Humor at Playwrights Horizons and – as both director and choreographer - The Bully with Vital Theatre and Together This Time:A Rock Musical for the NY International Fringe Festival.\n\nThe Tallest Building in the World is the final production of Luna Stage’s inaugural season in The Valley Arts District. The play was originally commissioned by The Ensemble Studio Theatre/Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Science and Technology Project and was read in Luna’s New Moon Play Reading Series in the fall of 2009.\n\nCheryl Katz, Director of Play Development at Luna Stage, says about the play: “Of course, it is not possible to even mention the words World Trade Center without evoking memories and emotions associated with the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001. In a unique way, this play addresses the tragedy that occurred ten years ago, because from the perspective of the present, audiences cannot help but see in these past events, the future.\"\n\nBook Review - Stagecraft: Stanislavsky and External Acting Techniques\n\nReview by Rob Hartmann\n\nSTAGECRAFT: Stanislavsky and External Acting Techniques. By Robert Blumenfeld. 384 pp. Limelight Editions, an imprint of Hal Leonard, 2011. $19.99 (paperback); ISBN 978-0-87910-384-2\n\nRobert Blumenfeld’s book, Stagecraft: Stanislavsky and External Acting Techniques, is an interesting but at times confusing book which aims to cover a wide range of theatrical topics; the author clearly has a great store of theatrical knowledge, but does not always connect his thoughts as clearly as he might.\n\nIn the preface, Mr. Blumenfeld explains that this volume is a companion to his earlier work, Using the Stanislavsky System: A Practical Guide to Character Creation and Period Styles. It may be that his newest book will be clearer in purpose to those who have read the previous volume (which I have not.)\n\nThe book is divided into three sections: in the first, the author discusses subjects such as vocal technique, delivering Shakespearean prose and verse, and performing in comedy and musical theater; in the second, he touches on period acting styles from the Greek and Roman period through the mid-20th century; and in the final, shortest section, he delves briefly into discussions of post-Stanislavskian approaches to theater such as the work of Sanford Meisner and Anne Bogart, among others.\n\nEven that brief description of the book’s contents gives a sense of the vast territory Mr. Blumenfeld is attempting to cover. He admirably tries to survey almost every element of an actor’s training: from specific exercises to train one’s voice to what to wear to rehearsal. Unfortunately, this attempt to touch on so many subjects means that some are dealt with so briefly that the reader may wonder why they are included at all. For instance, a short chapter on stage makeup, although it includes interesting references to Stanislavsky’s skill with makeup and Sarah Bernhardt’s advice on accenting one’s features, ultimately feels a bit like the author is skipping a stone across the surface of a much deeper subject. The reader might question other inclusions, such as a three-page review of basic parts of speech (definitions of nouns, verbs, adjectives and so on), when the space might have been given to other topics.\n\nThe author’s desire to compress a large amount of information into a small number of pages is keenly felt throughout the book. Mr. Blumenfeld, no doubt, has many more books in him; it’s unfortunate that he must here rush from one topic to the next. The chapter on the late 19th century and Victorian England rockets, within the space of a few paragraphs, from discussing Oscar Wilde’s accent, to the accents of U.S. Presidents Taft and Wilson, to Ibsen’s A Doll’s House, to Helen Potter, a 19th century performer who presented impressions of notable people (such as Wilde and Susan B. Anthony, among others) delivering their well-known speeches. The reader is intrigued and entertained, but also occasionally lost in the dizzying rush.\n\nThere’s no doubt that Mr. Blumenfeld has aimed high; in the book’s second section, in which he touches on the acting style of various historical periods, he sets himself an almost impossible task: what can one realistically say about the topic of acting Shakespeare in a chapter eight pages long? (Granted, the topic of dealing with Shakespeare’s work does turn up in many different sections of the book; somewhat oddly, Shakespeare’s play Julius Caesar is covered in the chapter covering Greek and Roman drama.) Occasionally he presents a bullet-pointed timeline of major historical events during a given period; however, it’s not always clear what the student actor should do with the information.\n\nFurther, the student actor may be frustrated at the somewhat lopsided focus in parts such as the chapter entitled “Acting In Musical Theater and Opera.” Here, Mr. Blumenfeld really only discusses opera and operetta, with just the briefest reference to modern musical theater; one wonders what the author has to say about the challenges of acting in musicals in the Sondheim and post-Sondheim era.\n\nAt its best, however, the book is like having a long, fluid, engrossing conversation with a very well-read friend. In the midst of his discussions, Mr. Blumenfeld quotes liberally from others who have written about the theater, and directs the reader to further books for more detailed study; all of his suggestions sound intriguing. He has a very conversational tone to his prose, which is never dry. In fact, one can imagine that parts of the book capture what it must be like to talk with him; he emphasizes his passion for the art of theater throughout (with a fondness for exclamation points.)\n\nFor the average acting student, some of the more arcane – yet fascinating – bits of historical trivia may seem to be shoehorned into the book. The author discusses the 19th century manner of playing Shakespeare, criticizing the grand, melodramatic style as counter to Stanislavsky’s approach. One could question why he includes such a detailed analysis of the style when it seems to be in opposition to the overall thesis of the book. However, the reader can sense Mr. Blumenfeld’s respect and enthusiasm for theatrical history and tradition; even though it appears to be a digression from the book’s primary purpose, it’s apparent he couldn’t bear to leave it out.\n\nBesides being the author of a number of books on theater, Mr. Blumenfeld has had a long career as an actor and dialect specialist. In this book, he draws on his own acting experience with various roles when discussing various theatrical techniques; I’m not sure if Mr. Blumenfeld has written a memoir of his career in the theater, but I would certainly be interested to read it.\n\nOverall, Stagecraft: Stanislavsky & External Acting Techniques has the admirable intention of being a comprehensive guide for actors, but suffers from occasional lack of organization in the structure and flow of the information presented. The book, with its engaging and lively tone, could prove useful for a theater student needing a quick overview of a wide range of topics, even though the whole is not as coherent as it might be.\n\nRob Hartmann is on the faculty of New York University’s Graduate Musical Theater Writing Program, and has written a number of articles on theater history for the Encyclopedia Americana.\n\nInterview - Laura Frankos, Author of \"The Broadway Musical Quiz Book\"\n\nBy Byrne Harrison\n\nLaura Frankos writes the “Great White Way Wayback Machine” column on TalkinBroadway.com and is the author of several books in the fields of mystery, science fiction, and fantasy. Frankos also works as a librarian and lives in Chatsworth, CA, with her husband, author Harry Turtledove.\n\nI had a chance to talk with Laura about her amazing new book, \"The Broadway Musical Quiz Book,\" the hardest test I've taken since my grad school comprehensive.\n\nI love trivia, but this made me feel like a rank amateur. Please tell me that this was the result of painstaking effort on your part, and not just a bunch of facts that you already had in your head.\n\nWell, both parts are true. There was a lot of work involved, but my brain is stuffed with lots of seemingly useless knowledge that I often managed to squeeze into a quiz question. Or an answer. I admit that the answer section was backbreaking effort, but I hate those quiz books in which the answer section simply lists Question 9: B. So I not only listed the name, but I tried to explain some of the reasoning that went into my choices for the wrong answers. For example, if a question dealt with casting for a certain role, I made the \"distractor\" answers include other actors working at that time--sometimes even people who had been considered, but not hired, for that role.\n\nI know the questions are hard. But I didn't simply want to ask \"What's the longest running musical in Broadway history?\" or \"Who was the original El Gallo in The Fantasticks?\" Instead, I'd list five famous actors and ask which one DIDN'T appear during The Fantasticks' long Off-Broadway run. I'm aware that very, very, very few people have any sort of detailed knowledge of what the Follies girls were wearing in 1907-1909, but I hope that merely by reading the possible answers--which include such costumes as taxicabs with working headlights, mosquitoes in the New Jersey marshes, and jurors at the trial of Enrico Caruso, who had pinched a girl at the zoo -- readers will be interested enough to guess, and learn something new.\n\nI'm a historian by training, and I like to think of the Quiz Book as a kind of anecdotal history of the American musical.\n\nHow did you go about doing the research for the Quiz Book?\n\nTo quote Johnny Mercer, \"I'm old-fashioned.\" I used libretti, cast albums, and a gigantic library of theatre books, foremost among them being the works of Gerald Bordman, Ken Mandelbaum, Richard Norton, Ethan Mordden, John Stewart, and Steven Suskin. The Internet isn't bad for fast-and-dirty research, but it's not completely trustworthy. I wish I could have included my full bibliography, but it would have run on for pages.\n\nSometimes a quiz would come together very easily; other times, I'd have to wade through pages, waiting for inspiration to strike. This book would not exist without the invention of Post-It notes. I had sticky notes everywhere and on everything. As I'd read, I'd jot notes. Eventually, I'd cobble them all together. And yes, I'd get distracted. For example, while writing the quiz for spring, I was looking for song titles or character names with flowers in them. But then I'd notice a bunch of song titles mentioning coffee. Nothing to do with spring, but I started making a \"coffee song\" list, and managed to turn that into a question for a different quiz.\n\nJust listening to songs could often generate quiz material. That's why I describe the book as one woman's excuse for listening to show tunes and calling it work!\n\nHow did you come up with the categories?\n\nI knew I wanted quizzes covering nearly all major songwriters, as well as some notable actors, producers and directors, and ones covering each decade from 1900 to the present. Many of the thematic quizzes -- sports, shows set in France, food -- sort of grew, like Topsy. I'd scribble notes until I had enough for a quiz. Others I developed more deliberately. For example, I knew I had to have a quiz on jukebox musicals, even though I personally don't like them. But I think it turned out to be one of the better quizzes, maybe because I sweated so much over it.\n\nFor the long quizzes on major figures, I tried to include a little biographical information, then centered each quiz on ten significant shows for each person, listed chronologically. (Yeah, Sondheim got 35 questions, including the Sweeney Todd mini-quiz, plus I stuck the shows for which he was just the lyricist in other areas... what can I say? I'm a rabid Sondhead.) I tried to balance the source material for each quiz: some questions were based on song lyrics or plot, some on production details (tryouts, design, cuts), some on the actors involved, and some on weird anecdotes. I didn't always succeed. I'm not happy with the Ahrens and Flaherty quiz since it's almost entirely based on lyrics and plot detail. On the other hand, I'm proud of the Hal Prince quiz, since nearly every question was based on a directorial decision of Prince.\n\nThe decade quizzes were tough. For the early years, I knew most readers would never have heard of some of these shows, yet I wanted to give a flavor of what early Broadway was like. So I picked some operettas, some revues, some shows with famous comic stars. For the later decades, I included significant shows by songwriters with small output (i.e., not enough to generate a full quiz; thus, The Music Man is in the 1950s quiz, but there is no Meredith Willson quiz). For some of the decades, it was easy to find enough one-hit-wonders to make a full quiz, but not for the forties! Since all the forties shows of Berlin, R&H, Weill, and Porter were covered in those songwriters' quizzes, what was left of the decade was a bit on the thin side.\n\nThere's more stuff I could have added, but the end result was 82 quizzes and over 1200 questions, with over 700 shows referenced. Things did get cut -- I had a quiz on state songs, but since a few states have not had the honor of a show tune (Washington State, Vermont -- unless you include the cut song from Lolita --, and a couple of others), I dropped it. So now there's no question derived from Whoop-Up. (What did Bruce Kimmel ask me last year, when I told him I'd just sold the book: \"Is there a question on Whoop-Up?\") And I keep running into more Shakespeare musicals I left out of the literature quiz, too.\n\nWhat kind of feedback have you gotten from the musical theatre fans?\n\nIt's been generally favorable. I learned Seth Rudetsky featured the book on his show, which had me totally chuffed for days. Some fans have said they intend to use the book at their Tony Awards party -- a truly fun idea. The biggest complaint is the level of difficulty. On the other hand, I've got a teenage cousin, eager to star in a musical one day, who has said, \"I'm not getting any of these right, but I'm learning a lot!\"\n\nThat's exactly how I felt! If you had to choose, what would you say is your favorite Broadway musical and why?\n\nThat's easy: Sweeney Todd. I love Sweeney because I think it's the best constructed musical of all time. I've seen enough musicals in my life that even when I'm enjoying a production, I find myself wondering about characterizations or plot points or clunky lyrics or whatever. There's always some little thing that I might ponder, \"Maybe they should have...\" But Sweeney is put together so damn well, without any extra fat on it, it just works. I love the story arc, the musical clues to the mystery, those lyrics that evoke the era without wallowing in Victorian sentiment, and those vivid characters. But then, I've already admitted to being especially partial to Sondheim. If stuck on a desert island with only a dozen cast albums, I think half of them would be Sondheim. And the first would be Sweeney.\n\nWhat's next for you?\n\nI'm ready to submit the next column for \"The Great White Wayback Machine\" on talkinbroadway.com, which (I hope) will start running on a more regular basis. I'm using leftovers from the Quiz Book, as well as material that wouldn't have fit in quiz format, and examining different aspects of musical theatre history. Current plans include a multi-part series on immigrants in musicals, and a study of cows on stage. Yes, cows. If you thought Milky White and Caroline were the only bovines on Broadway, you've got another think coming.\n\nAnd I do have some ideas for short stories that I'd like to get working on--science fiction and fantasy, but with some theatrical elements in them.\n\nThe Broadway Musical Theatre Quiz Book\n\nBy Laura Frankos\n\nPublished by Applause Theatre & Cinema Books, an imprint of Hal Leonard\n\nISBN 978-1-4234-9275-7\n\n\"The Other Place\" - Wrenchingly Powerful\n\nReview by Judd Hollander\n\nPhotos by Joan Marcus\n\nActress Laurie Metcalf turns in a stellar performance of a woman struggling with something neither she nor those closest to her completely understand in Sharr White's emotionally devastating and gently ironic The Other Place, winningly directed by Joe Mantello and presented by MCC at the Lucille Lortel Theatre.\n\n52 year-old Juliana (Metcalf) is a scientist who for the past several years has been working for a drug company on its latest offering, a drug specifically tailored to target the effects of dementia, said drug having just gotten approval from the FDA. During a lecture about the potential benefits of the drug she spots, to her great annoyance, a young woman in a yellow string bikini who has just come into the lecture hall. As Juliana continues her talk, she begins making this woman the butt of several pointed jokes, only to notice that the woman is not only actively listening to the lecture, but is quickly becoming emotionally engaged in what she is saying. But before Juliana can reason out just who this person is, she loses her train of thought and needs to be escorted from the stage.\n\nJuliana believes she is having what she calls \"an episode,\" one related to brain cancer, as she tells her long-estranged daughter Laurel (Aya Cash) in a phone call. Juliana hasn't seen Laurel in person for over a decade. Not since Laurel ran off with Richard (John Schiappa), Juliana's doctoral student, and a man 15 years Laurel's senior. Laurel and Richard are now married and have two little girls. Juliana is also in the middle of divorcing her oncologist husband Ian (Dennis Boutsikaris) due to his having an affair with one of his colleagues. Yet she still trusts her soon-to-be-ex enough to want him to be her doctor. It seems brain cancer runs in Juliana's family and she has long been dreading the day when she learns she been stricken.\n\nYet is what Juliana saying, and believes with every fiber of her being, actually the truth? Did Laurel run off with Richard, or did Richard kidnap her? Is Ian actually having an affair, and why can't he ever get the chance to speak to Laurel when she calls? Plus, why does Juliana keep referring to the family beach house on Cape Cod in the present tense when she and Ian sold it years ago - or did they? For that matter, does she actually have brain cancer?\n\nWith The Other Place (a terms with several meanings) the playwright has crafted both an analytical and poignant story about the terrible fragility, vulnerability, and immense desire of the human mind. For as Juliana's condition worsens, she becomes more and more determined to fix the most important things that went wrong in her life in the time she has left, such as repairing her relationship with Laurel and Richard. However, that may not be possible, as Juliana is revealed to be a powerful, controlling, and often condescending woman who can't seem to resist getting in one verbal dig after another. Yet it is this same need for control that drives her to continue to try to put things right, even though it may be way too late, as people eventually try to tell her.\n\nRunning through the entire play is the fear of what dementia can do and how it can eventually destroy one's very sense of self. As Juliana notes in her lecture, the condition has \"a 100% mortality rate,\" so the fear of the disease is something everyone can certainly relate to. What is not that well known and which the play powerfully points out, is that such conditions may exist for years before full-blown episodes of the disease actually occur. As demonstrated in flashback when it is shown just what happened to drive Laurel from her home years earlier. Unfortunately all too often people are too close to the truth to really understand it. A point made clear when Juliana angrily tells her doctor (Cash) \"if I had dementia I would know it!\"\n\nMetcalf is brilliant as Juliana, a powerful, self-assured woman whose very identify is being stolen away. It's a testament to the actress's ability that she is able to take a not very likable character and make her an object of understanding and sympathy, rather than abject pity. Used to using acid humor and anger first as a defense, then as crutch, the few quiet moments Juliana has are both shattering and frightening to behold. Especially when she finally realizes just what is happening to her. She is also able to deliver the scientific explanations and jargon quite well.\n\nBoutsikaris works very well in the role of Ian. Long since used to his wife's frequent outbursts of rage, he puts up with it because he loves her dearly. Through Ian, the play is able to show how those closest to someone suffering from such an illness are affected just as powerfully. Especially when all they can often do is offer support while being a verbal punching bag for the afflicted person's rage and anger, while being unable to really talk to the one person they love the most.\n\nCash and Schiappa both work well in multiple roles. Cash is believable both as Laurel and as Dr. Cindy Teller, a neurobiologist whom Juliana is certain is having an affair with Ian; the Teller character nicely being able to maintain a professional demeanor in the face of Juliana's accusations. Cash's best role however is a young woman going through a painful period of her own and who encounters Juliana in the final scenes. Schiappa is good as Richard and in several other roles; through he has less to do than the rest of the cast. Yet is able to give his various characters a nice air of both authority and realism.\n\nMantello's direction is very good, allowing the mystery and power of the play to continue to grow with each succeeding scene and making sure the various actors keep their roles totally real in connection to what is going on, with never a false note. Eugene Lee's set, a sort of backdrop perhaps indicting the human brain or the jumble the mind can become, works well.\n\nIn the end the show comes full circle in a sense, allowing the characters to move forward by understanding what has come before, while being uncertain as to what is coming next. Devastatingly powerful, with a final realization that is heartbreaking, The Other Place illustrates a desperate attempt to fix what can't be fixed and an ultimate ending about moving on, broken in some sense, but whole in others. This one is a must-see. It's also nice that the theatre has a rule that no latecomers being seated once the performance begins. Too bad about the people's cell phones that kept going off or the woman who was texting throughout the play.\n\nThe Other Place\n\nWritten by Sharr White\n\nDirected by Joe Mantello\n\nScenic Design: Eugene Lee\n\nCostume Design: Dane Laffrey\n\nLighting Design: Justin Townsend\n\nSound Design: Fitz Patton\n\nVideo & Production Design: William Cusick\n\nProduction Manager: B.D.
