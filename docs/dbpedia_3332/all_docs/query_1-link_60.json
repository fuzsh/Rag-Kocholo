Her songs have sold in excess of 50 million records. She is best known for penning culturally resonant, female-empowerment anthems such as Christina Aguilera’s Billboard number-one single, “What a Girl Wants” and Meredith Brooks’ Grammy-nominated hit, “Bitch.” Peiken’s experiences give her a unique perspective on the music business. She is a professional woman who fought her way into a highly competitive and changing industry and found a way to succeed, balancing a thriving career and a family. Peiken’s book, “Confessions of a Serial Songwriter,” is a humorous pop culture memoir about her journey from young girl falling under the spell of magical songs to working professional, writing hits of her own. Peiken discusses the creative process, the conflicts that arise between motherhood and career success, the challenges of staying relevant, celebrity egos and schemers but, most of all, the remarkable people she’s found along the way. The audio version of “Confessions of a Serial Songwriter” has been nominated for a 2018 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album. Based in Los Angeles, Peiken blogs for Huffington Post about songwriting culture and is a fierce advocate of creators’ rights on Capitol Hill.\n\nAbout Johnny Mercer Foundation\n\nThe mission of the Johnny Mercer Foundation (JMF) is to support the discipline of songwriting in the tradition of the Great American Songbook as exemplified by the life and work of the legendary Johnny Mercer: lyricist, composer, performer, collaborator and producer. The Foundation continues Johnny’s legacy by partnering with individuals and organizations dedicated to celebrating and nourishing the disciplines he mastered and the causes he and his wife Ginger Mercer championed.\n\nJMF has created a number of dynamic creative joint ventures with several prestigious institutions to facilitate its goals including: the Johnny Mercer Writers Colony at Goodspeed Musicals, Accentuate The Positive Programs (New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Miami), The Musical Theater Program at NJPAC, Georgia State University Fellowship Program, Florida International University Fellowship Program, the Johnny Mercer Songwriters Project with Northwestern University and the Johnny Mercer Archives at Georgia State University.\n\nIn addition, JMF also supports various charitable causes including UCLA’s Art of The Brain, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (Mark Taper and Johnny Mercer Artists Program), and the Braille Institute (Johnny Mercer Children and Adult Choirs).\n\nThe legendary Johnny Mercer (1900-1976) composed more than 1,400 songs, including “Accentuate the Positive,” “Fools Rush In (Where Angels Fear to Tread”), “Any Place to Hang My Hat Is Home,” “Too Marvelous for Words” and “Come Rain or Come Shine.” He also wrote songs for 100 motion pictures and won four “Best Song” Academy Awards. A top radio personality and recording artist, he also was the co-founder and president of Capitol Records and established the Songwriters Hall of Fame with Abe Olman and Howie Richmond.\n\nFor more information please visit www.johnnymercer.org.\n\nAbout American Music Theatre Project"
