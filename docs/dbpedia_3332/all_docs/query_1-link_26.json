I gleaned a few gems along the way, but was mostly too young to know what questions to ask of my Oma and Opa about their experience. “I’m saddened that they took their accounts with them to the grave. I fear that a whole generation of stories are lost. From them we could have learned so much more about what it meant to survive, to resist, to be in lockdown, to be courageous and brave. Even the glint of knowledge I have of their lives strengthens me, reminds me I come from resilient stock. “Delft Blue is my attempt to salvage some of the sense of feeling, some of the meaning of living in that time. At its heart, it is a play that explores the impossible decisions people must make in impossible times, which seems especially relevant today. And underneath it all is a question about what it really means to resist and to live a good life when the world and everything around us has changed.\n\n–Andrew Kooman\n\nAudience Reactions to Delft Blue:\n\n“Captivating, suspenseful, thrilling!” –Peter K.\n\n“What a great production to present on Remembrance Day.
