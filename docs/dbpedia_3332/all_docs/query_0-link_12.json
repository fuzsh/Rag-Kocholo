        "text": "By John Lyle Belden\n\nIt’s an often-told story: A stranger comes into a sleepy town and everything changes. However, in this case, that’s the stranger’s plan the whole time.\n\nSummer Stock Stage presents a full production of Meredith Willson’s “The Music Man,” directed by founding artistic director Emily Ristine Holloway. And I do mean “full” – the whole musical on the full-size Ayers Auditorium stage (at Park Tudor School) with orchestra in the back, led by Mike Berg Raunick, and a cast that Holloway tongue-in-cheek calls “seventy-six actors” (a rough count in the program is close to that number). They represent 30 different Indiana schools, she said, mainly teenagers with younger children in age-appropriate roles.\n\nThis company gives an exceptional performance throughout, from the overture to the curtain call.\n\nIn 1912, “Professor” Harold Hill (Justus Palumbo) arrives in River City, Iowa, a practiced con man posing as a traveling salesman of band instruments and uniforms. The grift involves convincing a town it needs a youth band, selling them everything they need with the promise he’ll organize and teach, but skipping town with the money before giving a single actual lesson.\n\nIowans aren’t that easy to fool, especially town librarian Marian Paroo (Jilayne Kistner), but Hill accepts the challenge, demonizing the new pool tables downtown and getting everyone singing and dancing as they await the arrival of their instruments. Both Marian and Mayor Shinn (Andrew King) suspect something dishonest is happening, but are swept up in the events of that magical summer. Marion’s shy, lisping little brother Winthrop Paroo (Tad Klovsky) is coming out of his shell; meanwhile, local delinquent Tommy Djilas (Justice Harris) is doing honest work, albeit as Hill’s unwitting accomplice.\n\nBut even master manipulator Hill isn’t immune to changing attitudes – or love.\n\nThe cast also features Gracie Reckamp as Amaryllis, the girl with a crush on Winthrop; Taylor Smith as Marcellus Washburn, an old friend of Hill’s now in on the scam; Paige Murray as the Mayor’s wife Eulalie, who wishes to be seen as cultured so is easily talked into leading a women’s dance committee; Gabi Bradley as Zaneeta Shin, the Mayor’s daughter who is seeing Tommy; Elizabeth Hutson as Marion and Winthrop’s mother, who takes a shine to Hill from the beginning; Caleb Trinoskey as Charlie Cowell, a crude traveling salesman out to expose Hill; and Martini Otaletan, Jackson Bullock, Thomas Bowling, and Colin Alber as city School Board members who find themselves formed into a pitch-perfect barbershop quartet.\n\nPalumbo and Kistner, both college-bound high school graduates, give professional-level performances as Harold and Marion. He gives Hill suave charisma and endless charm; while she presents as nobody’s fool, while understanding that this “band” may be the best thing to ever happen to this town.\n\nKing amuses with his bossy bluster as Mayor Shinn. Murray easily steals scenes as his wife. Hutson’s Mrs. Paroo is a steady presence, an old Irish soul whose only desire is for love to prevail. Klovsky, naturally, charms as Winthrop.\n\nWhile the songs and story are what makes this musical famous, this production features some incredible dancing, choreographed by Phillip Crawshaw. The big numbers fill the stage with precision and dazzling moves; moments when Tommy and Zaneeta pair up really pop; and the movement and clever use of the books during “Marian the Librarian” are simply stunning.\n\nFor anyone who likes “The Music Man,” or is open to it, this brilliant production is a must. Performances are 7 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, June 28-30. The Saturday Matinee is a “sensory-friendly” performance for patrons who would be more comfortable with that. Park Tudor is at 7200 N. College Ave., Indianapolis, follow the signs to Ayers Auditorium. Go to summerstockstage.com for tickets.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nAt a time when the French capital is on our minds with the upcoming Olympics, Footlite Musicals presents “An American in Paris.”\n\nBased on the 1951 Gene Kelly film – a showcase for both his dancing and the celebrated music of George and Ira Gershwin – the musical, with book by Craig Lucas, had its world premiere in Paris (naturally) in 2014 before its acclaimed Broadway run in 2015. The local production, Footlite’s summer show featuring college-age performers, is directed and choreographed by Kevin Bell.\n\nWith World War II just ended and the City of Lights finally recovering, we meet Adam (Seth Jacobsen), an American still limping from his war wounds. He makes his living playing piano and writing music while helping local friend Henri (Louis Soria) become a nightclub singer, unbeknownst to his industrialist parents. Meanwhile fellow American soldier Jerry (Alexander Holloway) purposely misses his train out of Paris so he can stay and work on his art.\n\nFrom the beginning there is a mysterious girl (Jaelynn Keating) who we find out is Lise, a second-generation ballerina who, at the request of American heiress Milo Davenport (Remi Shirayanagi), is to star in a new ballet written by Adam, who feels a deeper connection. For Jerry it was love at first sight, as he insists on having more time with Lise to finish his sketch of her. But what neither man knows is that she is a long-time friend of Henri, who is working up the courage to propose to her.\n\nThe cast also includes Audrey Beaverson, Ella Bassler, Tajeyon Bohannon, K. Dottery, Emma Gedig, Josh Hoover, Tatum Meadors, Danny Roberds, Katie Van Den Heuvel, and Thomas Zotz as The Maestro of the ballet company.\n\nThis production is unusual in being a sort of hybrid of a traditional stage musical and ballet, with graceful dancing in most scenes. This works in part because of the triple-threat talents of Holloway and Keating. Their singing is exceptional in numbers like “I’ve Got Beginner’s Luck” and “The Man I Love” and their dancing is exquisite, especially together in the climactic title ballet. Jacobsen is also strong in stage presence and singing voice, as well as showing he’s quite a dancer in a fantasy scene.\n\nA celebration of love and Gershwin, “An American in Paris” has performances Thursday through Sunday, June 27-30, at Footlite’s Hedback Theater, 1847 N. Alabama St., Indianapolis.

The original, by legendary German film pioneer Fritz Lang in 1931, was a predecessor to the genre of film noir. Being Lang’s first picture with sound, he innovated with it in ways that still inspire today’s filmmakers.\n\nRoss captures the feeling of entrapment in a black-and-white world with the audience on three sides of the black-box Everwise Stage (formerly Indy Eleven) surrounded by heavy dark curtains. Entering and exiting this space feels like a labyrinth. Actors’ costumes are in blacks, greys and browns, with among a spare few props bright red balloons for effective contrast.\n\nVoices literally surround us with some lines delivered by obscured actors behind the curtains or prerecorded. Little girls are puppets (provided by Beverly Roche) with vague innocent faces, ethereally voiced offstage by Kristin Watson Heintz. Technical director Arden Tiede and lighting designer Tim Dick assist with the noir effects, including fog and image projections, with graphic assistance by Catalyst founder Casey Ross.\n\nAs in the original story, by Lang with Thea von Harbou, there is a serial killer, known as “the Midnight Man,” attacking young girls. Ten have been brutally murdered when Mrs. Beckmann (Maria Meschi) discovers her Elsie is missing. Among the last to encounter the child alive was a friendly blind man (Craig Kemp) who we discover is a homeless former lawyer who manages through barter to get balloons to sell to neighborhood children. Police Chief Lohman (James Mannan) and Detective Grodin (Kirk Fields) find an unseeing “witness” only the beginning of their frustrations, as practically no clues are found and suspect leads go nowhere.\n\nMeanwhile, the criminal community has grown frustrated with massively increased police activity and a fearful population cutting deeply into their “business.” Plus, even hardened criminals have no patience with child murder. Thus, one of their leaders, Breaker (Tristan Ross) leads an underworld search for the Midnight Man, with the help of thief Frank (Jeff Stratfer) and club/brothel owner Sharp (Austin Hookfin), with the Balloon Vendor working the “invisible” street people.\n\nAnother genre-inspiring aspect of this story is that the audience sees the perpetrator early on, one of the early plots about a killer’s descending madness and the other characters’ struggle to find and stop him. Normal-looking John Beckert (J. Charles Weimer) is locked in a cycle of obsession and predation. He acts quickly once a random potential victim is sighted, this being both a sign of dangerous impulsivity and part of what makes him impossible to predict.\n\nHowever, eventually good detective work, and a vital clue realized by the balloon man, lead cops and crooks each to close in on Beckert. Which will get to him first, and what will “justice” be when they do?\n\nThe story is appropriately taut, tense and not as predictable as you would think, even as events feel inevitable. The acting is outstanding. Meschi, a mother herself, compellingly communicates the horror and desperation of Beckmann’s grief and need for answers and resolution. Kemp easily portrays his blindness without any broad gestures, his eyes looking nowhere as he “sees” with his hearing and speaks with clear voice to ensure understanding. Fields seems to toy with stereotype, at first an ineffective cop but proving his worth as Grodin realizes the right details to give his attention. Mannan gives us the Chief who is both police and bureaucrat, under frustrating pressure on both sides. Our underworld trio effectively play close to type – Stratfer’s Frank jittery nervous, Hookfin’s Sharp ever suave, and Ross’s Breaker deeply intimidating. (In the movie, the latter’s character is a safecracker, here he seems to be an enforcer; either way, his leather gloves are apropos.)\n\nFor his part, Weimer gives us an emotionally driven performance that gives insight into Beckert’s disordered mind and personal horror. This “monster” is given neither justification nor supernatural menace; as is noted during the search, he is “a man, like one of us.”\n\nConsider the title to stand for Midnight Man, or “Murderer” as Lang did, or even the Roman numeral as the killer states “there will be a thousand more” if he is not caught. Regardless, find Catalyst’s “M,” with performances through July 7 at the IndyFringe Theatre, 719 E. St. Clair St., Indianapolis.

In varying states of decay, yet fully active, the turned zombies, recognizable by sickly colored skin, were designated Stage One, like Jimmy, physically and mentally intact; Stage Two, like comic Sy Greenblaum (Jerry Robbins), losing body parts that can be simply reattached to regain function; Stage Three, largely mute and slow of mind but physically strong; and Stage Four, the kind you really don’t want to meet.\n\nCarl Cooper (Robert Fimreite), another Stage One, is president of the Zombie Actors Union, which looks out for performers like Jimmy, as well as the Stage Three stagehands (Lauren Lotzow and Natalie George). June and Jimmy’s human costar Madeline Blonstein (Veronique Duprey) has grown weary of working with the undead; she commiserates with production assistant Michael Eastman (Brynn Lee), who is influenced by the letters published in the paper attributed to the mysterious “Mr. Kaplan,” who calls all zombies a dangerous menace that should be removed from regular human society.\n\nMeanwhile, Gary (David Muller), the Director of “I Love My Wife,” apparently lives in his production booth and we only hear his voice.\n\nThis story is narrated to us by LAPD Detective Sam Cutty (Staggs), who tells it during a 1972 police seminar, with the help of his groovy young niece Tammy (Sydney Adams). Cutty was there in 1952 when he was called in to investigate a murder involving the aforementioned characters, leading to a bigger and more sinister plot.\n\nI won’t spoil this, because hopefully this play will return at a later date. Staggs crafted an interesting mystery with lots of fun comic elements, featuring creatures who are not necessarily the bad guys, and not nearly as “mindless” as the attitudes of certain humans. The moral codes of the 1950s add to the atmosphere of discrimination as America deals with another easily misunderstood minority. June takes a stand as a voice for decency, rallying our sympathies as well as her castmates.\n\nSydney Jackson was assistant director. Beth Fike designed the sets. Ash Dykstra did the un-lifelike makeup.\n\nFrom our perspective, we say “mission accomplished” for Staggs – a good zombie play with good zombies. This also shows Hyperion further establishing itself as another quality local theatre company. It starts its next season in September with “An Inspector Calls” by J.B. Priestley, directed by Nicole Amsler. See HyperionPlayers.com for details.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nThe show “Into the Woods” could be considered the quintessential Stephen Sondheim musical (with book by James Lapine). Even in a world of fantasy and magic there is a sense of realism, real stakes and real consequences. It is also one of his works you are likely familiar with, thanks to numerous community and professional theatre stagings, as well as a popular movie (and, of course, its runs on Broadway).\n\nTherefore, when Buck Creek Players took it on this year, under the direction of Ben Jones and music director Jill Stewart, they decided to make the production stand out while still true to its story and audience expectations. The result is an “Into the Woods” that is outstanding by practically every measure.\n\nThe experience starts the moment you enter the theater and see the stage. Aside from a large lone tree at the back of the stage –­ its hollow necessary to a number of scenes – setpieces are adorned with raised branches to suggest the ever-looming Woods where our stories are set. Those rotating pieces themselves look like giant open books, the covers walls of old bookshelves. Other props look like stacks of books (classic and popular titles on the spines) and scattered like random leaves on the floor are pages with burnt edges – we were told Jones had them be copies of pages from commonly banned books. Set design and construction are credited to Matt Gray.\n\nRoles are well-cast. Ellen Vander Missen, notable for leading ladies at Footlite Musicals, makes her BCP debut as Cinderella. Central characters the Baker and his Wife are wonderfully played by Ball State graduate Mason Mast and local favorite Miranda Nehrig. The quirky wit of Thom Turner fits perfectly as the Narrator and Mysterious Man. Cordale Hankins embodies the youthful impulsiveness of Jack (of “Beanstalk” fame) while Georgeanna Teipen returns to BCP as his Mother. Shelia Raghavendran appears to be having fun as brave, energetic Little Red Riding Hood. Emily Gaddy commands her scenes as the Witch.\n\nOthers include Claire Slaven as Cinderella’s Stepmother and Jeremy Teipen as her father, with Claire Gray and Jenna MacNulty as the stepsisters; Addison Koehler as Rapunzel; Josh Rooks a striking presence as the Wolf and the Prince’s Steward; Charming Princes played by Liam Boyle (for Cinderella) and Zach Bucher (for Rapunzel); Amelia Tryon as the spirit of Cinderella’s mother as well as the once-eaten Red Riding Hood’s Granny; and Anna Spack as diverse characters including some very expressive flocks of birds.\n\nIn a notable addition to the cast, Dominc Kattau brings the cow Milky-White to life, saying a lot with just a “Moo” and making scenes with his double-takes and antics.\n\nThe show also features a 16-member backstage orchestra, conducted by Jill Stewart.\n\nFor the unfamiliar, Act I has a number of popular fairy tales occurring simultaneously in and around the titular forest; Act II is what happens after the story says “happily ever after.” The songs serve the plot and work in Sondheim’s often complex style. The refrain of “Into the Woods” from the “Opening” sticks with you, and the Princes’ lament “Agony” is a favorite. The show’s “hit” songs come near the end – “You Are Not Alone” and “Children Will Listen.” No matter what your experience is with this musical, though, you are sure to be delighted.\n\nMore likely, however, you could be disappointed at missing out. As I finish this, Friday and Sunday’s performances are sold out, leaving two shows this Saturday (June 22), 2:30 and 7:30 p.m., at the Buck Creek Playhouse, 11150 Southeastern Ave., Indianapolis (Acton Road exit off I-74). Call 317-862-2270 or visit buckcreekplayers.com for tickets.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nAmerican Lives Theatre concludes its 2023-24 season as bold as ever with the drama “Spay” by Madison Fiedler, directed by Jen Johansen.\n\nThe setting is a recent September in Williamson, West Virginia (an actual town, hidden away on the Kentucky border). Noah (Jaddy Ciucci) has returned from the hospital, where she had been recovering from a very public heroin overdose, to the home of her half-sister Harper (Shawntè Gaston), who has custody of her pre-kindergarten son Benny (offstage).\n\nThe pains of withdrawal and pangs of addiction still rage in Noah, but she insists this time she can stay clean – as she had been for nine months prior to the recent incident. Harper, a no-nonsense kindergarten teacher, insists on assurances that this time will be different. Noah will live there, and in turn she pledges to break up with her boyfriend (and dealer) Jackson (Matt Kraft). We soon see how thin her resolve is on that point.\n\nAs the days start to cautiously pass without a relapse, a stranger comes to Harper’s door while Noah is at work. Aubrey (Julie Dixon) has come from a city hours away to offer help in the name of an organization that specializes in aiding young women with addiction. Harper is naturally slow to trust, but Aubrey confides that she had lost her own daughter to addiction and brings up a lot of valid points and advice, forcing Harper to seriously consider more aspects of her situation.\n\nHowever, this voice of reason also comes with a choice that seems unreasonable – at least, at first.\n\nIt has become widely known the alarming degree to which opioid addiction has ravaged the coal country of Kentucky and West Virginia (part of a nationwide epidemic). This fact, plus an excellent stage set (designed by Zac Hunter) with running water and comfy furniture, aid excellent performances to help the audience, seated on three sides around the Phoenix Basile stage, feel right there with these characters.\n\nCiucci employs her whole body in a convincing portrayal of near-constant physical and mental pain. Her manner of speech and expression, a variety of moods as damaged and disordered synapses keep her on a perilous edge of self-control, are convincing, while generating a surprising amount of situational dark humor. In her deceptively calm moments, there is the sense they will not last.\n\n“This is a survival town.” That line by Harper sums up the feeling of a desperate need for stability and control that Gaston ably portrays. She has deep affection for her sister but finds herself forced into constantly employing it as tough love. And she is readily a fierce defender of Benny.\n\nKraft plays Jackson as a charming, means-well, naïve redneck. He seems to care for Noah, but a close listen to his words shows signs of narcissistic control, wanting her as both the girl addicted to him and the loving woman he wants to marry, seemingly blind to the contradiction. His often-infuriating presence adds to the humor.\n\nDixon plays Aubrey as a gently-revealed enigma, leaving it to us to resolve if she is more savior or bargaining devil. According to ALT artistic director Chris Saunders, organizations such as the one she represents do exist.\n\nGiven her long-time presence on numerous stages, it is surprising that this is Johansen’s directorial debut. She has brought her experience with the actors’ perspective to bear to bring out the best in this talented ensemble.\n\nAlso notable is the musical soundscape by Todd Mack, with its haunting Appalachian tones.\n\nThe play ends on a fraught note, with a decision made but the consequences yet to be seen. This would be infuriating in a movie (begging a sequel) but on the stage a common device to open dialogue about what was just seen and our feelings about it. Still, it was a bit of a stun, the cautious applause when the lights came up snapping us out of a trance, delivering us swiftly back from two states away. Still, those issues, we realize, are here in Indiana as well.\n\nA stunning, engrossing look at a widespread problem brought home to the individuals mired in its depths, “Spay” runs through June 30 at the Phoenix Theatre Cultural Center, 705 N. Illinois St., Indianapolis. Get tickets at phoenixtheatre.org, information (including ALT’s coming 2024-25 season) at americanlivestheatre.org.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nGregory Hancock Dance Theatre features modern style with international influences and accessible visual storytelling. This was on full display in “Sagas and Superstitions,” the show that concluded the company’s 26th season, earlier this month at The Tarkington in the Center for the Performing Arts in Carmel.\n\nThe program featured a couple of premiere pieces. “Don’t Sit at the Corner of the Table,” with choreography and costumes by founder and artistic director Gregory Glade Hancock, is a new work inspired by old superstitions of Eastern Europe (set in Ukraine). The title refers to where a young girl must not sit, or she might never get married. The dance features bold movements and a fair amount of humor and whimsy as three sisters – Abigail Lessaris, Olivia Payton, and Josie Moody – entertain two suitors, portrayed by Thomas Mason and guest performer Isaac Jones.\n\nThe other new piece is the choreography debut by GHDT instructor and retiring company member Chloe Holzman. “Pelo Caminho” tells a traditional Brazilian story of a young man (Mason) on a quest to see the King and Queen (Jones and Payton). On the way he befriends the Spirits of the River (Hannah Brown), the Fox (Camden Lancaster), and Thorns (Moody) who aid and teach him. Holzman makes good use of Hancock’s style of flow and form, and the dancers’ long-time camaraderie with her no doubt aided in their flawless performance.\n\nHancock revived his contemporary telling of “Greek Mythology,” which included all the dancers listed above, including Holzman as well as Audrey Springer, portraying various characters and stories. He concluded with “The Wedding,” set in Poland and inspired by Roma traditions, performed by the company with Lessaris and Jones as bride and groom.\n\nBrown and Lancaster, as well as Holzman, are retiring from the company, and each got to perform a featured dance from one of their past GHDT performances.\n\nWe have always found these shows fascinating and entertaining, and look forward to the coming season, which opens with “Autumn Nights” on Oct. 25-26. For more information, visit gregoryhancockdancetheatre.org.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nThe opening song for “The Break,” a new rock musical presented by Constellation Stage and Screen of Bloomington, declares “this is not a love story.” But while it’s not a typical rom-com plot, this is a humorous story about love, tested in rather extreme fashion.\n\nSamantha (Alex Keiper) and Charlie (Louis Pardo) have known each other since they started college. They have only dated – and had sex with – each other, and for years have lived together. They were perfectly fine with this.\n\nOne day, they realize that perhaps they should take the natural next step: marriage. It also dawns on them that neither has personal experience to truly know that each is the best partner for the other – no basis of comparison. They decide to take a “break” of 30 days for a “sexual walkabout,” separately sampling one-night stands with strangers to get the lay of the land (so to speak) before reuniting to finally commit to each other. There are a few ground rules, including shared custody of Rodrigo the iguana, but otherwise they are free to explore.\n\nThis musical, by Michael Kooman and Christopher Dimond, indulges in mature topics and language, but keeps things light with no graphic simulated intercourse. The scenes more reflect their experiences and feelings before and after the sex. There are plenty of questionable potential hookups, but some go quite well – one song declares “That felt f***ing good!”\n\nUnder the direction of Scott Weinstein, Keiper and Pardo turn in excellent performances. As Sam and Charlie, they convincingly show ease with each other, a depth of feeling that includes mutual empathy and genuine hurt when the rules are bent. Being the only actors on stage, each smoothly morphs into the various men and women our explorers encounter. Keiper is even the voice of Rodrigo, who also gets a song.\n\nOverall, the show is a funny, entertaining reflection of our swipe-right/left dating landscape and the apprehension we all experience when the ring and ceremony make “til death do us part” feel too real.\n\nSpeaking of which, the last scene does involve a wedding (which is even hinted at in the beginning). How these two come to know that next step is the right one, though, is a heartfelt journey worth joining them on. Performances run through June 23 at Waldron Auditorium, 122 S. Walnut St. in downtown Bloomington. Get info and tickets at seeconstellation.org.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nHow does one describe the ongoing process by which a stage production comes to be? It’s a bit crude to say “how the sausage is made,” as that is just too messy an image to place on creating art. On the other hand, saying its “how the magic is made” – aside from likely being trademarked by Disney – glosses over just how productively messy the journey can be. Writers like myself (and Wendy) use these terms to impress on the reader and likely patron that this work is not finished, but still worth a look which lends an insight into the labor of love (emphasis on both) plays, musicals, et al, truly are.\n\nSo, I’ll just say that IndyFringe’s annual Div(X)Fest (formerly Diva Fest) is our witness to the base materials our creators spin into theatre gold. (I think that works.) This year’s edition, again celebrating the talents of women (as well as trans and non-binary folx), features readings of three new works. One day remains, Sunday, June 9, starting at 2:30 p.m. in the IndyFringe theatre, 719 E. St. Clair St., downtown Indianapolis. Tickets are pay-what-you-can. Info at indyfringe.org.\n\nReviewing in reverse order of presentation, these plays are:\n\n“The Sleepover,” I mention first because it is the closest to completion, planning its world premiere at the 2024 IndyFringe Festival in August. It is a unique collaboration begun earlier this year among five women who also perform in this “coming of age dramedy.”\n\nChristine Gordon (as Alexis), Emily Worrel (Rowan), Natalie Fischer (Jessica), Samantha Hines (Chloe), and Wilhelmena Dreyer (Sydney) are 14-ish girls gathering for their annual (for all but Rowan, who is new to town) end of school year sleepover at Alexis’ house. There is a sense of transition, mainly signaled by moving on to high school in the fall, which has the hostess especially meticulous in her planning.\n\nThere is tension among them practically from the start, especially after Sydney finally arrives and they engage in their traditional game of Truth of Dare, “Kessler Road Rules.” Along the way we find hidden secrets, insights into true feelings, and hints of the presence of a monster they thought they had only made up – all magnified through the everything’s-extreme perspective of adolescence.\n\nAs others noted at one performance, although all five women contributed to the creation and writing of this play – from exploratory conversations and exchanging basic ideas to fleshing out characters. their relationships, and what they say and do – the pieces have melded together in what feels like a single narrative voice. They admit it did feel a bit like they were school friends who shared a deep bond in this process.\n\nThis should generate a lot of buzz going into this year’s Fringe, and we can’t wait to see how their creepy cryptid actually comes to life.\n\n“The Silent Supper” by Kaitlynn McShea is a work of subtle horror in which an older woman sits by a ruined table, struggling to remember what happened before “the fire came.” In this reading, directed by Christine Gordon, Wendy Brown portrays the woman, exhausted by nightmares as every sweet memory “never goes right,” as well as the growing buzz of insects. Each remembrance is enacted by a foursome of local actors (I don’t have names at the moment; may fill in if I get them later) who give us some insight into their lives – presuming the one remembering is a reliable narrator. This short work does well in building suspense, reminiscent of Stephen King at his best. It gives Brown a good role to work with, portraying a troubled soul who pulls on our empathy.\n\n“On the Rag Dolls” by Allison Fradkin starts the day’s entertainment, directed by Mira Cassidy, as a trio of young women (again, names unavailable) play three edge-of-puberty besties on their own “Casual Friday” sleepover. However, this scene is a satirical comedy with entendres and puns coming at you with the pace of a hit sitcom, expressed by girls who barely, if at all, get the subtexts (still, you know tweens talk like that). The trio are apparently all in the same hardcore Evangelical Protestant community, though only one goes to the Christian Academy rather than public school, so talk of the future is of boys they will marry and the children they will have (though sex is gross), as well as if their just-started periods are “the curse” or a blessing. – “Men-ses the day!” one girl resolves. – This work in progress is hilarious and shows lots of potential; after-show talkbacks allow us to give Fradkin ideas on where to take this story (as with McShea above).\n\nWe extend a big thanks to IndyFringe for hosting this event and their continued engagement in the development of local talent and new works.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nBeing a Generation X’er, I get mixed feelings about 1980s nostalgia, but some things catch the kitschy spirit of the decade just right, like the Tony-nominated musical, “The Wedding Singer,” based on the 1998 Adam Sandler film.\n\nPresented by the 21st-century actors of Eclipse, the professional-level program of Summer Stock Stage, “Wedding Singer” is on the main stage of the Phoenix Theatre Cultural Centre through June 16, directed by Kate Galvin.\n\nIn 1985 New Jersey, singer-songwriter Robbie Hart (Alex Pharo) is having modest success leading an in-demand wedding band, Simply Wed, with best friends Sammy (Micah Phillips) on bass and George (Matthew David Conwell) on keytar. Robbie is also looking forward to his own wedding, to Linda (Kha’Lea Wainwright), but things don’t go to plan. Meanwhile, Julia Sullivan (Leela Rothenberg), who with her cousin Holly (Dori Salumurovic) are waitresses at the wedding venue, is getting engaged to rich Wall Street boyfriend Glen Guglia (Jack Ducat). Julia has Robbie promise to sing at her wedding – which he eventually will, but not in the way anyone expected.\n\nThe plot hits all the expected beats of a typical rom-com, from the meet-cute all the way through to the “go out and get her!” What’s important is how the story goes from here to there, and all the charming, mildly dramatic, and laugh-out-loud moments along the way.\n\nPharo takes on this journey well, making Robbie a hero to root for, funny and charming without any of Sandler’s mannerisms so the character stands on its own. Rothenberg makes Julia both noble and sweet, the kind of woman worth going great lengths for. She and Salumurovic have a natural chemistry as well, like they grew up as almost-sisters. Phillips, looking like a mad scientist combined Hall and Oates, and Conwell, a sort of Boy George homage, also make memorable likable characters. Wainwright and Ducat give their roles each a flavor of vanity that befits the era – Glen’s especially, as a “greed is good” trader overflowing with hubris.\n\nLocal stage veteran Devan Mathias steals scenes in roles including Robbie’s grandmother Rosie and Julia’s mother Angie. The supporting ensemble get a lot of time on stage – weddings, a bar mitzvah, at the mall, etc. – so get a lot of moments as well, featuring Isabella Agresta, Kayla Mariah Fifer, Fletcher Hooten, Byron Ledford, Hillary McGuire, and Maddux Morrison (who rocks Fake Billy Idol).\n\nThe musical, with book by Chad Beguelin and Tim Herlihy (from Herlihy’s screenplay), music by Matthew Sklar and lyrics by Beguelin, avoids the endless headaches of song rights by providing originals with the familiar feel of ‘80s hits, from the catchy “It’s Your Wedding Day” to the charm of “Come Out of the Dumpster.”\n\nGalvin is aided by music director Jerico Hughes, choreographer Phillip Crawshaw and stage manager Rebecca Roeber. Embarrassingly accurate fashion and look by Wendy Meaden (costumes) and Andrew Elliot (wigs, hair, and makeup).\n\nHighly entertaining with a story of love lost and found “Right in Front of Your Eyes,” find “The Wedding Singer” tickets at phoenixtheatre.org."
