I didnât know what dreams were about to be borne. I didnât even know I was in the seedling stage of mine, and others, transformation.\n\nWe were completing a film called Africa Sing Me Your Song, filming stories of AIDS-impacted children in central Tanzania. We had filmed some amazing footage with Masai warriors, in local schools, and even in hospitals and mud-hut villages. But, as a storyteller I knew we had not yet found a story for our film that really resonated at a deep, heart (or spirit) level.\n\nSo we prayed.\n\nThere were four members on that team, and on the final night in a small town called Tabora, two of us hit our knees. We prayed for about half an hour, asking Yahweh to reveal His plans, even if our time clock was winding down to zero. It was a Hail Mary, a last-ditch-effort-kind-of-prayer. We were all in.\n\nâGod, you made the Earth and made us to inhabit it. If You want, You can even change our circumstances and timeline.â\n\nWe were supposed to fly at 6am. And then catch an international flight the day after that. But something happened, that we did not expect.\n\nA flash flood washed out the runway at the local airport, a red-dirt runway. The only airport within 300 miles. We were grounded indefinitely.\n\nIâll never forget the feeling at breakfast that morning. Two of our team members were discombobulated, grumbling as any of us likely would to have our plans so suddenly changed. But the two members of our team that were praying the night before were grinning ear to ear. We knew that of all the washed-out runways, this flood was from the Lord.\n\nFast forward to 3 hours later. As the cinematographer and director of the film, I suggested that we go downtown to see what we might find. And the split second I hit record on the camera, two young boys, street orphans named Juma and Haruna, walked into the frame. They were 10 and 8 years old.\n\nI didnât speak a word of Swahili back then. I hardly knew how to say, âJambo.â But when I looked into those boysâ eyes, I knew that we had found our story.\n\nFast forward to 3 years later. Our film had touched the lives of quite a few people when we shared it in Canada. In particular, there were a pair of 10 year old boys from a private school who saw the same look in Juma and Harunaâs eyes, that I had seen through my tiny field monitor on the streets of East Africa.\n\nWe presented a new vision when screening our short documentary from Tanzania: build a home for Jumaâs family, 12 kids under 12, and their grandmother. With the passion of two grade schoolers, $16,000 was raised in an international dinner at the school I had attended as a young boy and teenager, Red Deer (Gateway) Christian. And with those seed funds, we built this precious family a new home, lovingly named the Gateway House.\n\nFast forward another 15 years. Juma is not only healthy, well, wise and of good reputation with his family and peers. He is a bright, whipsmart, talented, baptized, Spirit-filled follower of Jesus, and he changed his name to Moses, a reflection of his pursuit of the promised land he now longs for.\n\nThis week I land in Tanzania once again.\n\nMark it, trip 15 (or is it 16?!) in the last 18 years! And Juma Moses, as we now call him, is the co-leader of our mission. I will land in his nation, and he will meet our team and provide support and translation as we walk through villages and sit with local Tanzanians, Swahili Bibles in hand.\n\nItâs incredible as a witness to the transformation over the last 18 years, to see how far Juma Moses and his siblings have come. Some are (or will soon be) teachers, nurses, doctors and business owners. But it would have never come to pass, had it not been for that washed out runway in 2006.\n\nA disastrous interruption was a miraculous answer to prayer. What prayers are you praying? I pray they are answered, planting seedlings that one day grow into stories of divine transformation. For Godâs glory.\n\nAs a filmmaker, Iâm excited to share some of the work we produce at Unveil Studios. Writing and uncovering Biblical truth is a passion of mine which I share weekly about on this newsletter, and filmmaking is my other passion as well as my day job!\n\nWe started our studio (and named it Unveil) in 2006, inspired by 2 Corinthians 3:18,\n\nAnd we all, with UNVEIL-ed face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.\n\nOur work has taken us (The Kooman Brothers Matthew, Andrew and Daniel) to pipe villages in India, impoverished villages in East and West Africa, and on pilgrimage for inspiring stories in over 35 other countries. And sometimes, inspiring stories are found in our own backyard.\n\nRobb Nash is a Canadian musician who has overcome personal tragedy, and in my opinion, is clearly being transformed into Godâs image, while helping others to discover their identity for the first time.\n\nWhen he was in high school he was in a major car accident that changed the course of his life. He now uses music to tell a story of hope to people who feel like theyâre hopeless, worthless, alone or unloved. The results will surprise you.\n\nI sincerely hope youâll take 15 minutes (put on the coffee!) to gather inspiration from Robbâs story. This, and dozens of other inspiring short and feature films can be found on our UnveilTV iOS app, android app and streaming site.\n\nLast of all, weâve had an increase in requests recently about how to support the award-winning film work that we are producing week after week on UnveilTV. Itâs a passion, a burden and a gift to be able to work on such inspiring, and often heart wrenching, material. And we canât do it without you! Thanks for chipping in.\n\nI can tell you the truth, any amount is an encouragement.\n\nAbout Dream series\n\nEveryone has dreams.\n\nIn Dream, the award-winning Kooman Brothers from Unveil Studios explore nine stories of individuals who are living their dreams, as well as those whose dreams turned into nightmares.\n\nThe series challenges the viewer with the life question:\n\nIf anything were possible, what dream would you build your life upon?\n\nGet full access to Breath of Life at danielkooman.substack.com/subscribe\n\nIn the last post about Daniel we concluded that one of the great themes of the book (and the entire Bible by extension) is that we must face our many fears, like the fear of man, fear of death, and more, and exchange them all for the one fear that we are called to have: The Fear of Yahweh. This âFear of the Lordâ is the beginning of wisdom, and is the only fear that overcomes all others.\n\nIf your fear is in God, then you are on the path. But if you are afraid of anything or anyone else, you have not been made perfect yet in Godâs supernatural love!\n\n1 John 4:18\n\nÂ There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.\n\nNot yet perfect. God is testing, judging, trying our hearts as we breathe our way through life. And the many precious stories in Godâs Word test our hearts as well. Saints like Daniel and his three friends who survived the fiery furnace are examples of Fear of the Lord, and how it overcomes the Fear of man.\n\nDaniel had every right to fear man. At least we might think so, humanly speaking. But the truth is we have no right whatsoever to fear men more than we fear God.\n\nDaniel was in exile.\n\nBut spiritually, he was more free than almost anyone in the world has ever been!\n\nAnd I want you to hear this today as a true spiritual encouragement, if you can receive it, because itâs actually very good news: we are in exile too.\n\nThe world is not our home.\n\nHebrews 13:14-16\n\nFor here we have no lasting city, but we seek the city that is to come. Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name. Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.\n\nIn other translations it literally says: the world is not our home. Daniel and his three friends believed it.\n\nThat is what empowered them to say so boldly, that even if Yahweh did not deliver in the fleshâ¦it would ultimately make no difference. In fact, in some ways, all the better (for them, not us) if He did not deliver. Because their eternal home, their actual place of residence, was the eternal Kingdom, a Heavenly home that Jesus himself revealed was already being prepared for whosoever believes.\n\nDaniel was threatened with death for seven decades, just for adhering to his unshakeable faith. Praying three times a day, turning away from idols and not worshiping the images of men or false gods even when death was the judgment.\n\nBut Godâs better judgment delivered him time and time again. Likewise, when we enter the fire, God is able to save and deliver us if we are fixed with our eyes on Christ alone.\n\nAnd the great news is that even if the fires of hell on this earth do burn us, there is a final judgment coming, and if you remain true to Christ, you will get a better judgment in the end that is incomparable to the short term trial or tribulation that you face.\n\nIsaiah 43:2\n\nWhen you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through fire you shall not be burned.Â\n\nDo you think the scroll of Isaiah might have encouraged Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego when they entered the fiery furnace of hell in Babylon? The fiery flames did not even singe a hair on their holy heads. They were well aware of Isaiahâs prophecy.\n\nIsaiah 54:17\n\nNo weapon that is fashioned against you shall succeed, and you shall refute every tongue that rises against you in judgment. This is the heritage of the servants of YAHWEH and their vindication from me, declares YAHWEH.â\n\nIf you are feeling judged or like you are in exile right now, take courage. The Father Godâs judgment is the one that matters.\n\nBut in the fiery furnace of worldly judgment, Yahweh in His mercy and compassion showed them His Fathersâ heart and love. He revealed that He is the Great Deliverer. Our Savior. The Great I Am.\n\nWe all deserved the furnace.\n\nRight now Iâm working on some exciting new content for Breath of Life, including the new release video included on this email. And I implore you to take a five minute break right now, or sometime today, to breathe some refreshing new life into your spirit!\n\nThis content hits home for me every time I take it in. That is because itâs a literal breath of life for the body, mind and spirit!\n\nIn Hebrew the word for breath is âRuach,â and it literally means Spirit as well as Breath.\n\nSo long as you breathe, your spirit remains alive INSIDE your physical body.\n\nBut the kicker is thisâ¦when you breathe your last breath one day, your spirit will NOT DIE! It will merely leave your physical body, your present jar of clay, enduring in a spiritual place forever. As Dr. Hugh Ross puts it in this clip,\n\nâThere is something about us that is brand new, that never existed before, and that is the spirit within us. Itâs the spirit part of us that is eternal. When God creates a spirit being, whether an angel or a human being, that being will live eternally afterwards. Our spirits are eternal.â\n\nI know youâve heard about this before if youâve followed my newsletter for any amount of time, but the benefits of reading/watching and believing what is presented in BREATH OF LIFE actually WILL change your life.\n\nIâve heard it dozens, maybe hundreds of times now from viewers of the series, and readers of the book. Breath of Life is transformative, because it reveals YAHWEH, our Heavenly Father, like many have never seen Him before.\n\nInstead of a Being far off, Yahweh becomes closer than the breath you are breathing right now. And His presence changes everything.\n\nSo take a breath, and let me know with an email or through the comments, how you feel when you are consciously aware of Yahweh, your Heavenly Father, as your daily Breath, your Life Source, and your Father. And enjoy the 5 minute clip.\n\nKeep Breathing,\n\nDaniel Kooman\n\nP.S. $11 for a limited time.
