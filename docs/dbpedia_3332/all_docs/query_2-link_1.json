        "text": "September 10, 2009\n\n\"Lord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted; to understand rather than to be understood; to love rather than to be loved; for it is by forgetting self that one finds; it is by dying that one awakens to eternal life. Amen.\"\n\nDecember 31, 2015\n\nThis biography is interesting in the approach/format: some interviews and some observations from a man who spent time with Mother Theresa. Muggeridge explains at one point in the book how his admiration for her almost becomes a religion in itself, which I can fully understand. That is the overall tone of the book. Her devotion to the poorest of the poor is shown to be so extraordinary, and her denial of her own needs so beyond comprehension, how could she have been human? This will affect me every time I'd like to feel sorry for myself or whenever I think about what is true injustice in the world. This is a life-changing book.\n\nOctober 4, 2011\n\nWhen asked by Muggeridge about giving the poor \"things they needed,\" Mother Theresa answers, \"It is not very often things they need. What they need much more is what we offer them. In these twenty years of work amongst people, I have come more and more to realize that it is being unwanted that is the worst disease that any human can experience. Nowadays we have found medicine for leprosy and lepers can be cured. There's medicine for TB and consumptives can be cured. For all kinds of diseases there are medicines and cures. But for being unwanted, except there are [those] willing to serve and there's a loving heart, I don't think this terrible disease can be cured.\"\n\nMay 3, 2020\n\nA really interesting book about the encounter of the author with Mother Teres. Inspiring. This kind of books help me to see how selfish I am and how much I need conversion. Mother Teresa pray for us\n\nMarch 28, 2021\n\nThis is one of those books that sort of fell off the shelf and landed in my hands. I found it at the Pilgrim in Calgary and have read it a few times now.\n\nIt introduced me to the life and work of the BBC TV personality and writer Malcolm Muggeridge.\n\nIn part a biography of Mother Teresa's life, Muggeridge's account of his interactions with her and her life are humbling, inspiring, disillusioning, and unsettling.\n\nHis skeptical intellect and struggle to believe is perfectly counter-balanced and finally outweighed by Mother Teresa's confident belief in her Lord and total surrender to His will in her love for the poor.\n\nIt's interesting to witness through the pages how a writer and journalist can be used to both relay experience and also document how those eye witness accounts changed him in the process.\n\nAs an example, here's one of my favourite lines belonging to Muggeridge that is written in the book: \"There is a prayer of St Augustine, a fellow communicator who once called himself, as I must, a vendor of words, that I often say over, and did on this occasion, kneeling beside Mother Teresa: 'Let me offer you in sacrifice the service of my thoughts and my tongue, but first give me what I may offer you'\".\n\nA truly lovely read.\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\nBoring. Also Muggeridge seems to view Mother Tersea as about as holy as you can get\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\nHonestly, I'm surprised how much I enjoyed this one!\n\nMay 11, 2024\n\nMother Theresa was amazing…but this ‘biography’ just was too all over the place for me to even begin to process.\n\nApril 8, 2013\n\nThe book is divided into four parts:\n\nThe first is Malcolm Muggeridge recounting his experience with meeting Mother Teresa for the first time. It was definitely my favorite part of the book. It certainly reads biographical of Mother Teresa, but there is also an overarching sense of an autobiographical faith journey for Mr. Muggeridge. It certainly makes for fascinating reading due to both the topic and Muggeridge's mastery of the language.\n\nThe second portion is titled \"Mother Teresa's Way of Love\", which essentially amounts to a catechism of Mother Teresa. If anyone doubts the holiness of this woman, or is curious about her view of life, you need only read this portion of the book to be satisfied.\n\nThe third part reads as the Q&A with Malcom and Mother Teresa. The fascination of Malcom with Mother Teresa is apparent and no doubt due to the way she answers the questions put to her.\n\nThe fourth part of the book is Malcom's reflection of his encounter with the saint. It picks up where the first part leaves off.\n\nThis book would serve well as both an introduction to the life of Mother Teresa and the writings of Malcom Muggeridge, as well as a guide on how to live a saintly life and grow in holiness.\n\nDecember 13, 2009\n\nThe most interesting parts were Mother Teresa's interviews and letters. I can't see anyone saying anything controversial about this woman, so it was nice to get information from the source. The book is mostly about when the author went to make a documentary of their work with the poor in Calcutta, though, with sections about his personal journey towards or not towards joining the Catholic Church, which was of least interest to me. Published in 1971 or thereabouts, there is no mention of rumors of the Mother's later doubts about her work and beliefs. Although her amazing sacrifices kinda make me feel petty, it would have been neat to meet this lady.\n\nAugust 20, 2013\n\nGreat book. Malcolm Muggeridge is a great writer. He writes very well, and his insights gained through his relationship with Mother Teresa are exceptional. What was most interesting about this book was that I felt as though I had both gotten to Mother Teresa better and also Malcolm Muggeridge better.\n\nAt one point, I even imagined my daughter going to Calcutta!\n\nJanuary 26, 2017\n\nI will be honest and tell you that I picked up this book* more for my admiration of Malcolm Muggeridge than of Mother Teresa. Which is to say that Mother Teresa has often been reduced to basic quotes and online memes; these small doses of inspiration shared and reshared - paired with my ignorance of her story - has had little power to inspire.\n\nThe book reads much like Literary Travel Journal, which is my favourite genre. It is not a typical biography in that it is not an accounting of the life and works of Mother Teresa, but it is about Muggeridge's encounter with Mother Teresa when filming a documentary of her work in Calcutta (to which she reluctantly allowed... so long as it would help others love God more).\n\nThe title Something Beautiful for God caught my eye as I have been studying a \"theology of beauty\" for a couple years now. \"Let's do something beautiful for God,\" was an expression Mother Teresa used when venturing out to serve the poor. It is a most pure expression of love and devotion.\n\nI can say from the outset that this little piece of literature defines, through story-telling, true beauty and its power more than any other I have read. Not just to identify the quality in Mother Teresa, but its effect on Muggeridge. A skeptic was swayed, an agnostic shed his doubts, because of beauty. And nothing is more beautiful than someone who has freshly discovered beauty itself. I can sense Malcolm's soul \"lit up\" with awe and wonder, even while he retains some (healthy) hesitation about joining the church.\n\nThe book is divided into four parts. The first \"Something Beautiful for God\" is a biography of sorts, in that it offers a small history of Mother Teresa, but more it is about Malcolm's encounter with Mother Teresa and her work in Calcutta. There are rewarding insights extracted from their conversations, which have a rousing effect for the believer.\n\nThe second part \"Mother Teresa's Way of Love\" lays out Mother Teresa's values and their basic definitions, which is all about showing love and kindness to the poor. This is wonderful working theology which would refresh any who are called to work with the poor. I personally love Mother Teresa's take \"On Joy:\"\n\n\"Joy is prayer - Joy is strength - Joy is love - Joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls. God loves a cheerful giver. She gives most who gives with joy. The best way to show our gratitude to God and the people is to accept everything with joy. A joyful heart is the normal result of a heart burning with love. Never let anything so fill you with sorrow as to make you forget the joy of Christ Risen.\n\n\"We all long for heaven where God is, but we have it in our power to be in heaven with him right now - to be happy with him at this very moment. But being happy with him now means:\n\nloving as he loves,\n\nhealing as he helps,\n\ngiving as he gives,\n\nserving as he serves,\n\nrescuing as he rescues,\n\nbeing with him twenty-four hours,\n\ntouching him in his distressing disguise.\n\nThe third part, \"Mother Teresa Speaks\" is a transcript of Muggeridge's interview with Mother Teresa, where she humbly puts forth the reason why she serves the poor. Here's a sampling:\n\nMother Teresa explaining why she begins each day with Mass[Catholic worship]\n\n\"Yes. Without him [Christ] we could do nothing. And it is there at the altar that we meet our suffering poor. And in him that we see that suffering can become a means to greater love, and greater generosity.\"\n\nIn the fourth part \"A Door of Utterance\" Muggeridge speaks about the continuing effects of Mother Teresa both through the documentary film and his own encounter. Here it is clear the beauty of her humility has spread to Muggeridge. He notes his own inability to fully express his impressions of Mother Teresa and her co-workers. \"Often in the course of it I have echoed the prayer St. Paul asked the Christians of Colossae to offer on his behalf - that God would open a door of utterance. It will be for posterity to decide whether she is a saint. I only say of her that in a dark time she is a burning and shining light; in a cruel time, a living embodiment of Christ's gospel of love; in a godless time, the Word dwelling among us, full of grace and truth.\"\n\nMother Teresa, is so often (incorrectly) used as the pinnacle of a measuring stick of goodness. We often think of her level of service is unattainable for ourselves. But it is clear after reading this book that her goodness flows out of love for God. Her worship and work are one in the same. Instead of distancing myself from Mother Teresa - as I have done in the past - I found myself inspired to walk with God more closely, to see morning worship and devotion as the delight which feeds my day. I will not be living with the poor in Calcutta, but I have been challenged to consider what are the ways that God is speaking to me about how I show love to others in the circumstances he has placed me and how I must pay attention when he asks me to \"move out\" into the city motivated by my love for him.\n\nMuggeridge accomplished the job of documenting \"Something Beautiful for God.\" He most certainly provided a service born out of his growing love for God, the Door of Utterance he aspired to. Mother Teresa and Malcolm Muggeridge both shared something beautiful for God and we are roused (the effects of beauty) to do the same.\n\n*Note: My review is of the original 1971 edition. I haven't read the 2003 update.\n\nSeptember 21, 2013\n\nIf Malcom Muggeridge never wrote anything else in his life with the exception of Something Beautiful for God, his literary and journalistic reputation would have been assured. An eloquent yet succinct account of Mother Teresa's life among the utterly destitute and ravaged of India, the narrative is compellingly told without any fanfare or hardened journalistic cynicism. Muggeridge is a witness to the actions of Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity, and he writes as such.\n\nMalcom Muggeridge was a British hard-lined, no frills broadcast and newspaper reporter who aligned himself with the agnostic branch of thinking, dubious at best and doubtful at worst; his assignment in covering Mother Teresa's life in Calcutta was just another job, an acquirement for space filler for his show, a human drama that would make good television, nothing more or less. But he was curious, too. With that attitude, he interviewed Mother Teresa, who herself was cautious, for she did not want the program to be about her, but rather, the leprous and dying down and outs who filled the cities of India but whom God loved beyond all human understanding.\n\nThe first chapter of the account is titled Something Beautiful for God, and herein is where Malcom Muggeridge introduces how he came about being involved with the story; it also showcases the compassion of Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity. Their offerings are little and are not so much of a monetary or materialistic nature, for these people are so utterly bereft, both physically and mentally, all they want is love, to be held, to be touched, to be told that they have a value that far exceeds what is earthly. At the onset, Muggeridge is very much of this world. Money makes life better, but that is not what people need when they are ferociously shunned or dying. And bit by bit, a gradual understanding begins to seep into his logic and intellect.\n\nThe second chapter is titled Mother Teresa's Way of Love, and it is a kind of principle that she adheres to as a nun, a religious philosophy that guides and navigates her through the trenches of the fowl and the unpleasant. They are snippets titled: On Love of God, On Prayer, On Holiness, et cetera, et cetera. They are brief points that can be applicable to anyone, like St. Josemaria Escriva's books: The Way, The Furrow and The Forge. Bullets of religious insights.\n\nThe third chapter is titled Mother Teresa Speaks, and it is set up as a Q & A section whereby Malcom Muggeridge and Mother Teresa simply converse. Here Mother Teresa talks about her religious vocation and her call within a call. She talks about the austerity of her life, but how it's all given to Jesus Christ in the Mass and the Holy Eucharist. She sees Jesus at the Mass and sees Him again in the dead and dying, forgotten by society and shunned, just as Jesus Christ was. It is not difficult for her to see and make the connection. She has joy that she is there, lifting Him up and holding Him.\n\nThe last chapter is called A Door of Utterance, and herein contains the musings of Malcom Muggeridge himself, one of my favorite chapters, primarily because the writing is so beautiful and eloquent. It's almost transcendental and lyrically mystical; the woven language flows as if Muggeridge himself is possessed by the Holy Spirit but is trying to keep it somewhat at bay so he can focus on the job at hand, and that is to tell the story of Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity. The experience of love that he witnessed obviously had a transformative effect, and it made for uplifting and moving reading.\n\nIn conclusion, what I liked most about this book was that it took the veil of celebrity off Mother Teresa. So many people recognize her as a Nobel laureate and humanitarian but not really as a religious nun who had profound faith yet who quietly suffered the dark night of the soul. She lived for Christ, worked for Christ and loved for Christ; this short work captures her roots and her religious essence and conveys a beautiful potency of Something Beautiful for God.\n\nAugust 22, 2013\n\nThe wise reader of this book (and of other books featuring individuals who operate in extreme ranges) will shrug off the inclination to despair of their own mediocrity in the light of overwhelming excellence and take what they read as encouragement to strive towards higher levels themselves. Mother Teresa's total commitment to dwell with and bless the lives of those who are among the most unwanted people of the world represents a total commitment to her religion. She channels her love for God into her service to those whom the Lord so often championed in his mortal ministry.\n\nHer unwavering focus, though daunting to someone like me who tries to balance, work, family, recreation, and church (not necessarilyl in that order) prompts me to consider what kind of fluff I can cast out to make my life of more significance.\n\nBeyond looking at her philosophy and her work, the reader will find the voice of the writer, Matthew Muggeridge, open to the good work that is being accomplished, accepting of miracles, yet standoffish about making a religious commitment, thus posing the question to the reader, where do we draw the lines of our commitment to our beliefs.\n\nApril 13, 2011\n\nThis book is utterly beautiful, true to its title. It amazed me the effect Mother Teresa can have on you just through a book--the writing is lovely, but it is she who makes it such a touching experience to read. I completely believe what the author says about how it changed people to just be in her presence. After years of having mainly academic discussions about the faith and trying to keep up with theological arguments, it was humbling to be reminded that theology is important only as much as it helps us understand the value and beauty of holding a dying stranger in your arms and just loving them. It seems to me it is the only way we can understand that.\n\n\"The biggest disease today is not leprosy or tuberculosis, but rather the feeling of being unwanted, uncared for and deserted by everybody. The greatest evil is the lack of love and charity, the terrible indifference towards one's neighbor who lives at the roadside assaulted by exploitation, corruption, poverty, and disease.\"\n\nAugust 24, 2016\n\nSecond reading August 2016\n\nFirst reading May 2014:\n\nWhat a beautiful book. This was the first authorized book about Blessed Teresa of Calcutta ever written. Mother did not want a biography written about her. Instead, this book is a peek into the work of The Missionaries of Charity. The first half of the book is narrative. The second half of the book is taken from the transcripts of the movie interviews. While much more is known about Mother now, this book has the advantage of being the first book and one that so beautifully captures the spirit and energy of this saint of Calcutta. I have read many books about Blessed Teresa of Calcutta, this one is indispensable to any admirer of this holy woman's work.\n\nApril 20, 2020\n\nThis is a very thought provoking book inspired by the service of Mother Teresa. It seemed less of a biography than a testimony of Mother Teresa’s impact on the life of Malcolm Muggeridge. I went and read Teresa of Calcutta: Serving the Poorest of the Poor by D. Jeanene Watson to get more of the chronological story of Mother Teresa’s ministry.\n\nAlthough it wasn’t a traditional biography, it was fascinating to see how an agnostic Englishman who was deeply invested in the intellectual influence of his day was captured by an ordinary Albanian woman who had dedicated her life to the poor.\n\nThis book brought knowledge of Mother Teresa to a world audience. It’s definitely worth reading.\n\nJanuary 27, 2014\n\nThis is Muggeridge's memoir about interviewing Mother Teresa and filming a documentary about her work. It is purposefully not a biography or a detailed explanation of her projects but a reflection on the impact that her luminous witness had on him personally. As such it is a unique and moving perspective.\n\nJuly 6, 2016\n\nThis is the first book I've read about Mother Teresa, and as some other reviewers have pointed out, it's not so much about her as it is about the author's impressions of her and the Catholic Church. So if you are looking for a biography this book won't really fit the bill, but that being said it portrayed the spirit of Mother Teresa and her heart for serving others and serving Christ well.\n\nMarch 9, 2009\n\nI've always wanted to read this and found it for 87 cents. So this pauper is content crawling under the covers at this moment. :) (MARCH 8, 2009)\n\nMarch 9, 2009 Just finished reading this. It's is a gem of a little book. :)\n\nFebruary 10, 2017\n\nThough I did not agree on all points of Mother Theresa's theology or priorities, I found this to be an inspiring and convicting account of her story and purpose.\n\nP.S. It's not a biography, so don't expect a beginning-to-end presentation of her life.\n\nSeptember 29, 2011\n\nImpressive story, and he tells it with great honesty.\n\nNovember 28, 2017\n\nNote: Not technically a biography.\n\nI am utterly at a loss for words. I will have to think about how I want to describe her effect on me.\n\nMay 31, 2023\n\nOops I thought I finished this in April guess I never marked it as read\n\nApril 24, 2023\n\nThis book was a very nice touching read! Mother Teresa's work is amazing and reading about was truly special! This book is a nice reminder and wake-up call that the purpose of life is to love God and to love others!
