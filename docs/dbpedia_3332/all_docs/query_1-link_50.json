        "text": "Well, that didn't work\n\nAn autobiography\n\nBurr’s Story\n\nI intend to write an outline of my 86 year (so far) life. I know that few will be interested but I believe I will enjoy doing it. This autobiography will not be in chronological sequence since I tend to jump around and write what Is on my mind at the time. Also I will not be accurate on dates of events. I probably could do some research and get them right but I am too lazy to do it so I shall use approximations as best I can.\n\nI can’t remember much of my earliest life experiences. My mother used to read books to her children each evening and by the way there were 9 of us. Hearing my mother reading is about the earliest I can remember. I remember that I learned to understand the meaning of many words long before I could speak them. I remember trying to form the words but at first it didn’t come out and was not understood. The older ones just assumed that it was gibberish but I knew what I wanted to say. I don’t know exactly how old I was during that period. I have since read that it is natural to understand before you can speak but others don’t often know that you know. I didn’t remember that period of my life until I was an old man.\n\nI started school at age 5 going directly into grade 1. For grade 1 through 6 I attended a one room school in the hamlet of Orleans, NY for more than 6 years.\n\nI remember being surprised that you were required to wear shoes in school. On my first day I wore no shoes. My grandfather bought my shoes since I didn't have any. I never wore shoes in the summer and in the fall I had always outgrown last years shoes.\n\nI am reminded of a poem that I wrote at the Orleans School, preserved by Mrs. Estey, found in her papers after her death and passed to me through her daughter, a friend of my sister Peg. At that time I went under the name of Burr Arthur <Buster> Cook which is signed on the original document along with my age which was 7 years. Under the signature is the inscription: \"Beast powet in U.S.A.\". This is the sum and substance of any evidence, in existence, that I did anything in school. It disputes the claim of the Board of Education, that I did nothing at all in school.\n\nThe title of my poem is \"My Itchen\" and is included here in the original spelling, a skill that did not improve until I started using a computer and Word Processor and spelling checker.\n\nMy itchen\n\nI whas itchen in the kitchen\n\nwhile you was pitchen\n\nthe ball\n\nin the hall\n\nwhile you was pitchen\n\nthe ball\n\nin the hall\n\nit started to cry\n\ncy yippiey\n\nand that is the story\n\nof my itch itch itchen\n\nin the citch citch citchen\n\nriten by Burr Arthur Cook\n\nBeast powet in the U.S.A.\n\nBefore I was old enough to go to school I could not wait. I envied the older children of the family who went off each day to school. I remember thinking that school must be fun, only the more mature get to go. I used to look at pictures in the Book of Knowledge. We had a very old set of those books. I was fascinated by the pictures and drawings of the solar system in these books and looked forward to learning of these things in school.\n\nThis was the way I approached my first day at school. I was\n\ndisappointed to find that the assignments had to do with things that I had already learned from my older siblings, such as, the alphabet, the colors and other pretty boring stuff. I performed just enough of this work to ward off punishments such as sitting in the coat closet for hours on end with the boots and overcoats, or sitting in the corner of\n\nthe room where I first contemplated the properties of triangular shapes.\n\nI hated school. After my first year I knew that I had to resist whatever it was they were trying to make of me. I passed the first and second grades without incident, but rarely had any papers or reports to bring home that would be worthy of praise. Since my brothers and sisters got the report cards on the same day as I, it would be difficult to ignore them, which would have been my preference. My parents\n\nwere blessed with adequate IQ levels, and saw no reason why their offspring wouldn't be the same. My reports were perused and not much was said to me about it. However, conversations took place between my parents and teachers, principal of the parent school in Clifton Springs as well as the Superintendent of Schools.\n\nIn the third grade I severed my relationship with schools and\n\nwithdrew. I refused to do anything at all. I remember thinking, at that time, that I had it made. I was punished at school by being made to stay after the rest went home. It didn't matter, however, since I had found a way to direct my thoughts and escape from their prison. I thought a lot of the war, which was in full swing, and imagined myself finding ways to assassinate Adolph Hitler or his Japanese equivalent.\n\nI was well educated when it came to identifying all types of aircraft, ours and theirs, as well as ships at sea and artillery in the field. I knew the careers of Eisenhower, Patton, McArthur, Rommel, Gene Autry and Charlie McCarthy. I was able to think about these things rather than the long division, which I detested. To my amazement, not much punishment was dealt out at home on this matter. Instead, I was taken to medicine men, mostly on pressure from the school system. I remember one Doctor, a friend of my Grandfather, in Utica, who remarked that I looked healthy and that he himself had never been fond of school. In the public schools of today I would have been treated as learning disabled and sent to special classes. I don't know how I would have reacted to that.\n\nOn days that I could not make it to school, because of one of the numerous physical complaints I concocted, I was sometimes given the choice of attending school or accompanying my father and assisting him in his work as an independent electrical contractor. These field trips were easier to handle, than school. They usually took us to various cow barns around the county and chicken coops and sometimes a warm house. During these times I learned a lot about\n\nelectricity without which I never would have entered the computer field and my life would have been much different. Years later, my son Jim worked for my father for a period long enough to learn several building trades which has kept bread on the table for both of my sons and still does.\n\nI don't have a lot of memories of school. I was pretty successful at shutting it out. My younger brother, David passed me by and wound up ahead of me and Jim was not far behind. Somehow, I managed to be promoted from grade school with the comment that I didn't earn it but, perhaps a different teacher might help. It didn't. I became more\n\nimaginative at finding ways to avoid going to school at all. I recall that I found myself in an Algebra class taught by Bob Kloepfel. Whenever I attended school, which I did sometimes just to maintain relationships with friends that I formed there, Bob Kloepfel would call on me to solve equations on the black board. He seemed to enjoy watching me solve the problem correctly, while others in the class could not, even\n\nthough I never did a single assignment for the class. Doc Robbins, the agriculture teacher, liked to have discussions with me, and I generally enjoyed his company. An English teacher, Mrs. Spangle once praised my journalistic capabilities when I decided one day to write an essay in class. Mr. Foster, a shop teacher, enjoyed working with me\n\nwhen I did a valve job on a Briggs and Stratton engine in his class. It was too late for any of these people to reach me. I was too far behind and involved myself in school only when they discussed something that interested me. I recall, one time, showing the science teacher the relationship between the earth, moon, sun and planets and drawing diagrams on the board in illustration. I know that he was impressed. His name was Richard Kishler. He became furious with me when I called him by his first name one time.\n\nI was not good at sports and still do not know the rules of\n\nthe games of baseball, football and basketball. I was able to\n\nrun and jump and thus took part in track and field events\n\nuntil someone decided that attending school was a requirement\n\nfor participation.\n\nOne day, in the early sixties, I dropped in at the BOCES\n\ncomputer center, then on main street in Clifton Springs,\n\nwhere Bob Kloepfel, my ex Math teacher, was in charge. He was\n\nhappy to see me but, informed me that he was having\n\ndifficulty getting the bugs out of a computer program he had\n\njust written. I wound up spending the afternoon with him and\n\nto his surprise I fixed all his program problems for him\n\nand showed him some useful tricks on the IBM 1401 computer.\n\nI am not sure if it was before or after starting school that I became rather sickly. Most of my problems were not severe enough to keep me out of school which I did on my own quite well. I remember that I began to stutter and cough a lot and my nose stuffed up. I found myself not able to breathe through my nose and developed an asthmatic condition. I had what was called swollen glands in my neck and I became severely hard of hearing and I can’t remember what else except that I had many minor ills with many ear aches and general fatigue. I did not engage in any physical activities with my siblings and had few friends.\n\nIt was, at some point around that time that the doctor decided that I needed to have my tonsils and adenoids removed and I was admitted into the hospital in Canandaigua N.Y. where I spent a few days. I remember quite vividly the smell of ether which was used to put me to sleep. I awoke with a very sore throat but by evening I was able to eat some ice cream. This may very well have been my first taste of ice cream and by the next morning I was eating oatmeal and eggs and toast and many other things. Coming from such a large family I was not used to eating so well and when the time came to go home I wished I could stay there a little longer.\n\nPrior to my first day at school my name was Buster. That is\n\nthe only named I had. I was very disappointed to find that\n\nthe teacher would have no part of calling me by my real name\n\nand insisted on calling me Burr Arthur Cook. I had trouble\n\nsaying this name and often people thought that it was\n\nBrarther Cook.\n\nOne of my earliest memories is of an incident that took place\n\nwhile I was busy watching a crew of men working on the road\n\nthat passed our house. One of the workman looked my way and\n\nsaid \"hey Buster, how about getting me a glass of water\". It\n\nwas a hot day and the request seemed reasonable, so I went\n\ninto the house to pump a glass of water for him. While I\n\nworked the pump handle filling the glass I casually asked my\n\nmother if she knew the man in the road waiting for the water.\n\nShe looked out and said that she did not know him and asked\n\nwhy I thought that she should know this man. I replied that\n\nhe, somehow, had known my name, Buster.\n\nMy favorite books, at that time, were \"Buster Bear\" and\n\n\"Bobby Coon\" both of which my mother would read to me.\n\nSometimes she would read books to the entire family in the\n\nevenings. She would read a chapter each night and then we\n\nkids would beg her to read another before bedtime. The Uncle\n\nWriggly books were favorites at those times as well as Peter\n\nRabbit.\n\nI started going to movies at an early age. My older brother\n\ntook me a lot and we would usually walk 3 or four miles to\n\nsee Tarzan or Gene Autry or Hop along Cassidy (not sure of\n\nthat spelling). These were my heroes. Later, the movies were\n\nmostly about the war which provided adequate heroes.\n\nThere were two stores in Orleans at that time. Both were\n\nheated by wood stoves in winter. On winter days and summer\n\nnights Avery Hollenbeck's store was a gathering place for\n\nlocal farmers and retired men. They discussed crop prices,\n\npolitics and local gossip. I began stopping there, at first,\n\nwhile running errands for my parents, but soon started\n\ndropping in there on my own when I knew that the men were\n\ngathered there. I was well accepted by this group and, in\n\nfact, they would dig into their pockets and buy candy and\n\ncakes for me. I did not fully understand at the time why\n\nthese men enjoyed my company so much. Whenever I arrived at\n\nthe store they seemed to be happy; laughing and grinning and\n\nwinking as one after the other would reach in their pockets\n\nfor change and saying \"wouldn't you like one of these candy\n\nbars here?\". I always said yes and while I would be eating\n\nthat, another would say \"how about one of these pies over\n\nhere?\" and I would shake my head in a yes. They always bought\n\nme a Hires Root Beer to wash it all down and the laughter\n\nbecame louder and louder as I ate cookies, cake, pies,\n\nbananas and candy as long as they wished to carry on. The\n\nmen always gave up first, thinking that I might explode.\n\nThey were amazed at my capacity and their eyes opened wider\n\nwith each item that I ate, but I was always willing to eat\n\none more. When asked, I would say yes I have had my supper\n\nbefore coming to the store. This worked so well in Hollenbeck's\n\nstore that I started dropping in at Fabrizi's store and found the\n\nsame kind of reception. I never got a stomach ache although some of the men seemed to become concerned sometimes.\n\nOne time I wanted to visit the store, but the snow was very deep. I had no boots that were adequate so I put on my older brothers boots\n\nand trucked on over there, by way of the foot bridge. The\n\nboots were farmer’s type knee boots, but on me they came all\n\nthe way up to the groin, which made it difficult to maneuver\n\nthrough the snow. When I arrived at Hollenbeck's store all\n\nthe men were there. John Runyun, Halsey Smith, Avery\n\nHollenbeck and several others. They looked at my oversized\n\nboots and laughed even more than usual. One asked if they\n\npinched my feet. Avery replied that I was pinching something\n\nelse, and all laughed loudly. It was a long time before I\n\nrealized what they meant and worse yet that they were right.\n\nAnyway I waddled home in these boots with a full stomach.\n\nOne time I was bringing a loaf of bread home from the store\n\nwhen some of our chickens jumped on me and started eating the\n\nbread. I made it home with only half a loaf. I guess it was\n\nonly fair since we later ate the chickens. We had one large\n\nrooster in the flock that always chased me after that\n\nwhenever I got too close. I would run to the footbridge as\n\nthe rooster was too chicken to enter the bridge which had\n\ncracks between the floor boards. I have never been fond of\n\nchickens from then on. We raised turkeys for several years,\n\nbut I was never attacked by a turkey.\n\nWhen I was around 55 years old I was suddenly stricken with a very heavy illness. The most debilitating manifestation was a severe fatigue. After several months of getting no place with the medicals I read a book about little understood diseases and I came across the name of Dr. Charles Lapp in Charlotte N. C. and I promptly made an appointment with him. His specialty was Chronic Fatigue and Immune System problems.\n\nI had relatives living near Charlotte and made many trips to see Dr. Lapp and enjoy the hospitality of relatives. On one of those visits the good Dr. had a novel idea. He had discovered that my childhood illness aligned with a polio epidemic in my area and he had concluded that what I experienced was very likely a very mild case of polio and further what I was experiencing currently was most likely what is called post polio syndrome. I was quite happy to except that as what I was currently experiencing.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nTwo things in my life caused a turning point. One was working\n\nin a very boring place, sort of a continuation of my school\n\nexperience. I was working, in the 50s, for Chevron Oil\n\nCompany, as a general maintenance man, and getting by. The\n\njob was not difficult. It required knowledge of general\n\nconstruction skills including electrical and plumbing skills.\n\nI had no formal education.\n\nThe second thing, precipitated by the first, was getting\n\ninvolved in amateur radio, and taking a correspondence course\n\nin general electronics. An FCC license opened doors for me\n\nand got me into companies like Univac, IBM and Honeywell\n\nBull where computers became my area of expertise.\n\nWork History\n\nThe following several pages describe my work history in the\n\nComputer field. My three page Resume follows.\n\nBACKGROUND SUMMARY:\n\n* Over 25 years experience in data processing including four\n\nyears of recent experience with ORACLE.\n\n* Experience in multiple roles such as programmer/analyst,\n\ntrainer, technical consultant, DBA, and database designer.\n\n* Familiar with structured methodologies and automated tools\n\nfor modeling, normalizing and documenting databases.\n\nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE Newest to oldest.\n\no Independent Consultant - September 1987 to Present\n\nDeveloped and presented training seminars on ORACLE release 6.0.\n\nPresented courses on ORACLE for Xerox Corporation,\n\nEastman Kodak Company, Datamation, Buffalo Board of Education\n\nas well as for the Bull users groups NAHU and HLSUA.\n\nDeveloped and implemented an ORACLE transportation (busing)\n\napplication for the Buffalo Public School System.

He had an office on\n\nWilshire Blvd. in L.A. which housed several data entry\n\nclerks and he had a crew of four programmers working on a\n\nproject at A. L. Lewis Corporation Offices in Riverside.\n\nLewis was a parent company to Lucky's Grocery Chain. The work\n\nwas routine and not too demanding.\n\nI would fly home every other weekend on a Pan Am 747\n\nfrom LAX to JFK airport and fly from there to\n\nRochester on a small plane that seemed to take\n\nlonger than the coast to coast flights.\n\nOn other weekends I would take a drive around the area, where the\n\nscenery is breath taking. On weekends that I did not fly home, I would\n\nsometimes send a ticket (when BT Software could afford it) to\n\nVivian and she would fly out to spend a couple of days. When\n\nVivian was there for a weekend we always went for side trips\n\naround the west coast area as she did not want to sleep in\n\nthe apartment provided for me in Riverside which was a fine\n\napartment but it had no furniture in it and I slept on the\n\nfloor on a sleeping bag.\n\nI like to go to zoos, but Vivian is not that interested.\n\nAnyway, we visited the San Diego Zoo which is one of the best\n\nalong with Lincoln Park in Chicago, the Bronx zoo and the\n\nToronto Zoo, which I recently visited with my grandson Ben.\n\nVivian likes the ocean side and I prefer the desert. We often\n\ndrove down the Santa Monica Freeway to the end and up the\n\nVentura coastal highway to Santa Barbara. This is part of the\n\nfamous route 1, all of which I highly recommend for it's\n\nunparalleled beauty. All the way from the Mexican border to\n\nthe Redwoods in Northern California. The Oregon coast is much\n\nthe same all the way to the mouth of the Columbia River where\n\nyou meet the rain forest of Western Washington. Big Sur is on\n\nthis route as is Carmel where Clint Eastwood was Mayor.\n\nOn Occasions when I found myself in Riverside on a weekend by\n\nmyself I generally drove about 75 miles east on Interstate 10\n\nand turn north to Joshua Tree National Monument where the San\n\nBernadino Mountains give way to the southern boundary of the\n\nMohave Desert. This is a wild area about 50 miles North and\n\nsouth by 75 miles east and west. In this area desert foliage\n\nabounds. I used this place as my Sunday School and spent many\n\nhours meditating and chanting out there. My chanting seemed\n\nto please some of the wild life and one time I found myself\n\nsitting next to a Desert Iguana which was about sixteen\n\ninches long. They sit very still on a rock, in the sun,\n\nlifting one leg at a time. They do it so slowly that you\n\ndon't notice until you realize that a different leg is now in\n\nthe air. They do that to cool there underside. Also, I have\n\nseen Big Horn Sheep, Rattle Snakes, Mountain Lions, Gilla\n\nMonsters, along with many critters I couldn't identify. The\n\nmost impressive thing about Joshua Tree, however, is the\n\nplant life. One time I stopped there just in time to see the\n\nBarrel Cactus bloom. I ran across a guy with a camera set up\n\nto film the opening of this very impressive flower. The drive\n\nthrough the park is either an uphill climb or going south it\n\nis downhill ride and you could coast for the entire 50 miles.\n\nAs you proceed through, the type of foliage, always abundant,\n\nchanges at various levels. At the bottom Ocotillo is often in\n\nblossom. Further up you are treated to Tree Cholla groves\n\nwith various colored desert wild flowers. At one time of year\n\nit looks like a sea of yellow flowers. Near the northern edge\n\nof the park you suddenly find yourself in a forest of Joshua\n\nTrees with branches that reminded early settlers of Joshua's\n\narms raised toward the heavens. It is not possible to\n\ndescribe these amazing freaks of nature. The rock band, U2,\n\nwrote a song about, and named an album after, the Joshua\n\nTree. To me Joshua Tree is a sacred spot. I have shown it to\n\nVivian, my wife, Butch, my son, Chuck Lyons, a friend, and\n\nDon Love who lived nearby and never took the time to look it\n\nover..\n\nJoshua Trees are plentiful to the north east from here all\n\nthe way to Las Vegas and to the north west to Edwards\n\nAirforce Base where the Space Shuttle often lands. Vivian and\n\nI made the trip past Edwards on one weekend that we went to\n\nSequoia National Park. The trip took us through Boron, made\n\nfamous by Ronald Reagan when he appeared in the Twenty Mule\n\nTeam commercials. I didn't know it at the time, but, I am descended from one Joshua Benson.\n\nAnother favorite spot of mine is at Big Bear, in the San\n\nBernadino Mountains. This is the closest ski area from L. A.\n\nand can get congested. There are points up there where, on a\n\nclear day, you can look out on the Mohave Desert towards\n\nNeedles, the hottest place in United States, while standing\n\nknee deep in snow.\n\nI still communicate with some of the people I worked with in\n\nRiverside, especially Don Love who is now in Chicago and Paul\n\nTaylor who lives in his van in San Diego where his ex wife\n\nlets him park his van in the driveway and lets him inside in\n\nthe morning to use the bathroom. I last saw Paul about two\n\nyears ago when Butch and I used the last of my frequent flyer\n\ntickets to fly to San Diego. We rented a car and after\n\nvisiting with Paul we visited The Grand Canyon, Joshua Tree\n\nand Los Angeles. I eventually had a falling out with BT over\n\nour different ideas about business practices.\n\n==========================================\n\nThis article is reprinted with permission from the Finger Lake Business Almanac\n\nwritten by Chris Sharman\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nE-Company gets message out, promotes local firms & FL Geneva\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nThe owner of an Internet company here created a website that promotes local businesses and tourism in the Finger Lakes. The company also helps individuals and businesses make use of the Web's resources by offering on-line computer training and website design.\n\nBurr Cook, a retired computer trainer, and his daughter Christine Cook own and operate CyBurrSource at 38 Linden Street in Geneva.\n\nAn admitted history buff, Mr. Cook created a website [www.thefingerlakes.com] to promote tourism in the region and promote local industry. Businesses are invited to list their contact information for free with links to their website available for a nominal fee. A simple one to two page web site can be made for approximately $225 with a $99 yearly renewal.\n\nVisitors to the site get lists of Finger Lakes attractions including parks, museums and historic sites. Some, like the Glenn H. Curtiss Museum of Early Aviation in Hammondsport have links to their own websites. Lodging, dining and winery guides with contact information are also listed.\n\nThe site receives up to 15,000 daily hits. * Traffic is high early in the week and picks up again toward the weekend as web suffers from around the country explore products, attractions and accommodations in the Finger Lakes.\n\nThe site's guest book allows virtual visitors from across the globe to submit questions and comments about the Finger Lakes region in a message board format. E-mail links are provided for ease in sharing information. A bookstore section on the site lists Finger Lakes-related literature and a classifieds section is currently in development.\n\nThe son of an electrical contractor, Mr. Cook first became involved with computer related technology while working for Univac of Illion, Herkimer County, in 1959. Working for public and private institutions he began as a programmer/systems analyst and later a trainer and technology consultant. His career includes stints at IBM as a custom field engineer and at HoneyWell where he traveled throughout Europe and Asia as a senior education specialist. Mr. Cook retired from HoneyWell in 1991. He formed Cook House Computers in Palmyra in 1985. Cookhouse, even though it was a one-man show, became an international computer seminar and training company.\n\nChristine Cook, an attorney, established Cybersource Geneva during the summer of 1998 with the purchase of Snow Computers' Internet service provider equipment. Snow Computers continues to operate in Newark selling computer hardware. The current spelling of the CyBurrSource is a reference to Mr. Cook's first name, but also a deliberate avoidance of Cybersource, a name used by a West Coast Web developer. The company reformed as CyBurrSource and Christine Cook re-dedicated herself to her law practice. This created a need for Burr Cook's expertise and experience in technical training.\n\n\"The dial up Internet provider business did not grow as expected due to the arrival of several alternatives such as free dial-up services,\" Mr. Cook says. \"Our business took a natural turn toward the World Wide Web and the creation of sites.\"\n\nMs. Cook, who specializes in criminal law, developed the website Ezlawlocator.com. It provides links to legal resources in an organized and easily understandable manner, free of charge.\n\n\"Without a site like this, an attorney could easily spend thousands of dollars in legal research each year,\" Ms. Cook says. She has also established a comprehensive website for multiple sclerosis patients and their families.\n\nStephanie Nudd also works with the site building side of CyBurrSource. Ms. Nudd builds retail sites. Her work includes sites for Pasta Only's Cobblestone Restaurant, Eunhui's Buckwheat Pillows and a communications company named MarketHOLD Productions.\n\nCyBurrSource's pricing for site creation varies according to the needs of the customer. Less complex sites created for the primary purpose of promoting a business can be created on a budget of just a few hundred dollars not including minor maintenance and upkeep charges. Sites involving complex graphics, numerous links and e-commerce applications can run in the $3,000 range.\n\nAfter creating a finished web site, CyBurrSource refers its clients to TéAta Technologies of Geneva for hosting. Mary Bartolotta-Knipple owns the one-year old full-service company. She has over twenty years experience in the IT industry. TéAta also designs websites and is equipped to provide secure credit card processing, shopping cart software and Internet marketing services.\n\nAround the globe, Internet use is expanding at exponential rates. The number of web savvy citizens is expected to shoot up from 300 million currently to over 1 billion by 2005. Over 150 million people will get connected this year alone, says a study by the Angus Reid Group of Toronto.\n\nIndustry statistics report that Internet use is growing so fast that traffic is actually doubling every 100 days. Approximately 62 million Americans now make use of he Internet on a regular basis.\n\nCyBurrSource offers CompTIA certifications, an abbreviation for the Computing Technology Industry Association. The organization works to develop vendor-neutral standards in e-commerce, customer service, workforce development and training certification. Ideally, these standards will help to ensure consistency in network, internet and e-commerce solutions internationally.\n\nCyBurrSource's first CompTIA training module is A Plus, a program enabling students to pursue positions as a PC technician trained in hardware installation. The Second, NET plus certification, is \"ten times more important than A Plus,\" Mr. Cook says. It prepares students for a career in network administration. The third certification is I-Net Plus, an increasingly popular module in place to educate would-be web developers and future e-commerce consultants.\n\nIndustry figures largely explain the increasing interest in this career. From the first quarter of 1998 to the first quarter of 1999, it is recorded that 427,000 small businesses in America went online. If this trend continues, web developers will be in high demand.\n\nAt CyBurrSource, students perform lesson modules and tutorials from a range of on-line training sites. Textbooks are optional. \"My philosophy is to make full use of the technology already available on the web,\" Mr. Cook says. \"There are numerous on-line tutorials and many of them are free.\"\n\nIf students choose to purchase a textbook, Mr. Cook will gladly obtain one, but there are no set rules. His aim is to get each student up to industry standards and ready to pass the exam. Exactly how they get there is open to interpretation. Mr. Cook currently has three students in a Net Plus class using three different books. He is often surprised that anyone would purchase a computer training textbook, he says. The traditional model of a teacher lecturing at a blackboard will be replaced by interactive and collaborative online educational systems, he predicts.\n\nEach CompTIA exam takes approximately forty hours of preparation. \"My rates are based on $10 per hour per student or $400. If the students takes more or less time the cost is still $400,\" Mr. Cook says.\n\nAt the completion of their on-line training, students take the CompTIA exams at New Horizons Computer Learning Center in Rochester. The tests cost approximately $128 each. There are two tests for A Plus and one for Net Plus and I-Net Plus.\n\nWith a newly attained certification, students are ready to enter the job market. Veterans of the computer-oriented workplace use the industry-recognized standard for advancement.\n\nMr. Cook keeps in contact with his former students via the web. \"I maintain an Internet discussion group called CyBurrList for certification students and graduates which number about thirty at this time,\" Mr. Cook says.\n\nThough CyBurrSource offers no formal job placement functions, CyBurrList allows for the sharing of ideas and job openings. Former students can converse with new and potential students.\n\nEnd of article=======================================================\n\nBack to the Future Again\n\nI met my wife at Roseland Park. Vivian lived in Lyons and\n\nsince I could not afford a car I moved into the Iroquois\n\nHotel, by the tracks, in Lyons and obtained work in a\n\nfactory. In April of 1953 Vivian and I were married and have\n\nbeen together since with the exception of a couple of periods\n\nof separation. Before we realized what was happening we had\n\nfour children and not much money.\n\nIn 1954 I decided to make use of my electrical knowledge and\n\nwent to Chicago to Coyne Electrical School and took a course\n\nin Radio/Television repair and tried to make a living at\n\nthat. Having been a general screw up all my life had not\n\nprepared me for running my own business. The fact that I\n\ndrank a little more than socially at that time didn't help.\n\nI soon gave it up and found a fairly well paying job at\n\nChevron Oil Company.\n\nThe oil business kept me going for a few years but soon got\n\nto be boring and shift work was not to my taste. My growing\n\nhatred for that job prompted me to sign up for a\n\ncorrespondence course. I completed the lessons rather rapidly\n\nalways keeping ahead of the mail man and waiting for another\n\ngood grade to come through, and they did. My choice of\n\nschools was The Cleveland Institute of Electronics and the\n\npurpose was to prepare for an FCC license. In 1959 I went to\n\nBuffalo to take a test for a First Class FCC Radio Telephone\n\nLicense which I passed.\n\nIn late 1959 or early 1960 I found an advertisement, in the\n\njobs column, for Univac Computer Repairmen, featuring on the\n\njob training. I sent a Resume and was called to Buffalo for\n\nan interview. When I arrived for the interview I found about\n\n50 others had come at the same time. We were all given\n\ngeneral intelligence and aptitude testing after which there\n\nwere only three of us left of the original 50. The interview\n\nwent well and I was offered a job. I was hired, along with\n\nabout 400 others from all around the country, to fill a\n\ngovernment contract. We spent 20 weeks in a class room\n\nlearning the inner workings of the Univac Computer System. We\n\nlearned about the computer from the inside out. I had no idea\n\nwhat a computer was used for when I started. Attending\n\nclasses, eight hours a day, and getting paid salary plus\n\nexpenses at the same time seemed like a good deal and it was.\n\nI received a diploma, which certified me as a Field Engineer\n\non the UNIVAC NU90 Computer System. Shortly thereafter, the\n\ncompany lost the government contract and left the entire 400\n\nof us out of work. I was called back to work there at a later\n\ndate, but by that time I had found a better deal. I am\n\ngrateful to Univac Corporation for launching my career in\n\nComputers, but, I made no lasting friends there and I was\n\nvery fortunate to have found a job with IBM. Back to the\n\nclass room. I worked for IBM for several years; my resume\n\nabove somewhere relates my work history. I made some good\n\nfriends at IBM, but, life gets hectic sometimes and we have,\n\nfor the most part, lost touch. We lived in Webster during\n\nthat period and my house became a gathering place for IBM\n\n\"Customer Engineers\", as we were called. We had many card\n\nparties at my house. Vivian would usually leave town for the\n\nnight while all the rowdies from IBM came by to play Poker,\n\nEuchre and other such games. These parties would last all\n\nnight and I always had a head ache the next day.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen I was working at the U of R, around 1971, one of the key\n\npunchers offered me a pet raccoon. She lived on a farm and\n\nhad shot a mother raccoon for stealing eggs from the chicken\n\nhouse. They then realized that the mother had babies. Five of\n\nthem. I agreed to take a male. I thought it would make a\n\nwonderful pet for Stephanie. I kept him in a box beside my\n\ndesk for a whole day and took him home after work.\n\nThe next day I found some boards and chicken wire and erected\n\na pen. It was about three feet wide and tall and about eight\n\nfeet long. On top of that I installed an old dog house, like\n\na cupola on top of the pen. Rocky could hide in the\n\ncupola as it was entirely enclosed except for a hole in the\n\nfloor, also the roof of the pen, to gain entry. I picked his\n\nname, Rocky, after the Beatles song, popular at the time.\n\nOn the front of the pen I put a sliding door with a latch.\n\nIt took him five years to figure out how to open the latch\n\nand at that time, during the early spring when a raccoons\n\nthoughts turn to love, Rocky left and never returned.\n\nRocky turned out to be more than Stephanie could deal with\n\nand the responsibility fell on me. At first we tried bottle\n\nfeeding, as he had trouble drinking from a dish, but as small\n\nas he was he chewed the nipple off the bottle. His mother\n\nmust have been very tough. We then tried a dish of bread and\n\nmilk. This he did quite well with and soon grew big enough to\n\neat just about anything.\n\nHis favorite foods were marshmallows and graham crackers. He\n\nhad a large bucket of water and dunked everything in it. I\n\ntried giving him a rawhide bone to chew on thinking he would\n\nsharpen his teeth. He softened it up in the water before he\n\nate it. His teeth got very sharp anyway and later I regretted\n\ntrying to help them along.\n\nI lost several friends during that time because Rocky bit\n\nthem. I always warned them, but they had to find out for\n\nthemselves. They would see me walking around with Rocky on a\n\nleash and him climbing up on my shoulder and sometimes on top\n\nof my head. He seldom attempted to bite me, but I never\n\nforgot that he was a wild animal. I could never feed him from\n\nmy hands as he was very protective of food and would bite any\n\none that went near it. I usually would put his food in the\n\ncage while he was sleeping. He slept during the day and\n\nwanted to play at night. He would allow me to snap a leash on\n\nhis collar as he knew that meant I would take him out to\n\nplay. He got along famously with my dog, Missy.\n\nI took Rocky to the Vet once a year for shots. He needed both\n\ncat and dog shots as raccoons can get both types of diseases.\n\nThe Vet was a little afraid of him. I don't blame him as\n\nRocky had powerful jaws and his bite could be severe. I was\n\nnever severely bitten by him as I learned what kind of\n\nsituations made him angry enough to bite and avoided them.\n\nRocky was a friend of mine.\n\nHoneywell and Later\n\nIn the spring of 1978 I was getting tired of boring\n\nprogramming jobs, and I looked into the help wanted section\n\nof Computer world. I was working for Ragu Foods at the time\n\nand was comfortable there and treated with respect. Sometime\n\nduring the winter of 1977/78, along with Bob Christ, a fellow\n\nprogrammer at the spaghetti sauce factory, I attended a\n\ntraining class on CICS programming. The instructor for the\n\nclass seemed to live an interesting life, traveling from city\n\nto city, teaching a five day course in each place. I found an\n\nad for just such a job and set up an interview in Wellesley\n\nHills, near Boston, with Honeywell Information Systems.\n\nMy first interview at HIS (Honeywell Information Systems)\n\nwas fairly standard. I talked to several people and had to\n\ndemonstrate that I could talk to a group by giving a ten\n\nminute lecture on a subject of my own choosing. I presented a\n\nlecture entitled \"Zen and the art of Writing Bubble up\n\nSorting Routines in COBOL\". This presentation earned me the\n\nalias \"The Guru from Ragu\" which stuck for quite a while.\n\nFortunately, I had some experience, teaching, with RBI, ECPI,\n\nIBM, BOCES and at U of R Computing Center.\n\nMy second interview was with Al Manson who was to become my\n\nboss for ten years and also a lifelong friend. (I talked to\n\nhim on the phone just before Christmas, this past year, and\n\nexchanged cards). For some reason this interview was to take\n\nplace at five in the afternoon, I suspect that it was because\n\nof last minute flight arrangements. When I met Al, it was in\n\nthe parking lot, as he was on his way to a party, which is\n\nnot unusual for Al as he was invited to everybody's parties.\n\nHe asked me only one question and that had to do with the\n\naccuracy of my resume. He said that if at least half of it\n\nwas true, he wanted to hire me. I assured him that it was. He\n\nthen handed me an expense voucher and told me to find a nice\n\nhotel in Boston and have lobster for dinner. A flight home\n\nwas not available until morning. I did as he suggested and a\n\nfew days later I received a very nice offer including a very\n\nadequate expanse account and salary about $5500.00 more than\n\nwhat I was accustomed to.\n\nMy title at HIS was \"Education Specialist\" and a few years\n\ninto the job it was \"Senior Education Specialist\". My job was\n\nto develop training courses on HIS software, database\n\ntechnology, transaction processing technology and\n\nmanufacturing software. It was also my responsibility to\n\nteach the course a few times while training an instructor to\n\nuse the material, usually consisting of a student handbook,\n\nan instructor guide, and slides. Most of the seminars were 3,\n\n5, or 10 day presentations.\n\nOnce I established myself as a productive member of the\n\nHoneywell team, I was allowed to do my course development at\n\nhome and fly to Boston when I needed to use computers or\n\nequipment that I did not have at home. The software that I\n\nbecame involved with became more and more esoteric. At first\n\nmy territory included Boston, New York City, Toronto,\n\nBaltimore, Washington D. C., Buffalo, Pittsburg and\n\nPhiladelphia but soon I started stopping regularly at\n\nAtlanta, Chicago, Dallas, L. A., Phoenix, San Diego,\n\nSacramento, Minneapolis, Detroit, Seattle and Boise and most\n\nother US cities, spending more than half of my time away from\n\nhome. I also made many trips to London, Paris, Frankfurt,\n\nDusseldorf and Helsinki, traveling well over a million miles.\n\nVivian accompanied me to Paris one spring and on another\n\noccasion she joined me in Angers, France, near Lemans.\n\nRecently, Vivian had occasion to visit London, Salisbury and\n\nStonehenge. I made the same trip, alone, several years\n\nearlier.\n\nAfter spending over 20,000 per year on my American Express, I\n\nwas granted a platinum card. One of the best benefits were\n\nthe Frequent Flyer Programs, where by free tickets could be\n\nobtained after flying a certain distance on a given airline,\n\nusually 20,000 miles. Getting these free tickets allowed me\n\nto take a traveling companion along now and then. I\n\nespecially enjoyed being the tour guide and showing someone\n\nelse some of the places that I hold sacred. I have made at\n\nleast 100 flights into Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix and on\n\nevery visit I would make it a point to drive to the Grand\n\nCanyon, each time being a spiritual experience. Vivian has\n\naccompanied me, many times, to places like Atlanta, Phoenix,\n\nSacramento, Seattle/Tacoma, San Diego and many other\n\ninteresting places. My expense account allowed us to rent a\n\ncar, except in New York City and Chicago where Taxis were\n\nused instead.\n\nTravel\n\nI am in the mood for reliving some of my travels. In August\n\nof, what I think was 1973 I took a 15 day trip to the west\n\ncoast. Prior to that time I had never been further west than\n\nChicago, where I attended an electronics trade school in\n\n1954.\n\nThe trip was supposed to be a family vacation taking\n\nadvantage of some time off between jobs. I had been working\n\nfor the University of Rochester in a very interesting job,\n\nhelping Doctoral Candidates and those involved in Medical\n\nresearch projects, to use the computer to analyze their data.\n\nAnyway I was between that job and my new job as a consultant\n\nwith Information Associates, Inc. in Rochester and had some\n\ntime to kill. For some reason that I no longer remember,\n\nVivian had to back out from the trip at the last moment. That\n\nleft just Stephanie, then barely 11 years old, and myself, so I asked my good friend Ike to travel with us in my 1962 Plymouth with push button shifting. We started out on a Saturday morning, although I don't\n\nremember the exact date, but, Spiro Agnew resigned as Vice\n\nPresident while we were on this trip.\n\nThe first night of our journey was spent in Indiana, in a\n\ncampsite with two large ponds with swimming. We set up two\n\ntents, the same way we did more than a dozen times on the\n\ntrip. Ike had a one man pup tent and Steph and I shared\n\na roomy umbrella tent which was easy to set up. After this\n\nfirst night, Stephanie could set up the tent by herself,\n\nwhich she did, and often she would help others set up their\n\ntents as they arrived at the campsite. While Steph was\n\nworking on the tents, I would start a charcoal fire and cook\n\nour evening meal. Breakfast, being the cheapest meal of the\n\nday we ate in restaurants and diners, almost always having\n\npancakes, and for lunch we snacked either in the car or at a\n\nroadside table. We took no interstate highways and stopped\n\nfrequently to take in the sights. I remember having a nice\n\ncampfire to space out on before going to bed. Stephanie was\n\nvery fond of toasted marshmallows. Stephanie has photos from\n\nthe trip and one of them was taken of this campfire.\n\nWe started out in the morning of the second day on US Highway\n\n36 which took us through two state capitals, Indianapolis and\n\nSpringfield and spent the second night on the Mississippi\n\nRiver at Hannibal Mo. The town is\n\nfull of Mark Twain memorabilia including the picket fence and\n\nthe cave. We swam at the campsite but the water was muddy.\n\nOn the third day we drove, on US 36, through St. Joe, Mo.\n\nwhere Bonnie and Clyde once robbed the bank. We continued,\n\ndriving over half way through Kansas before stopping for the\n\nnight at Prairie Dog State Park where we were the only\n\ncampers to stay the night. We swam in a man made lake in the\n\npark. We saw a jackrabbit and I convinced Stephanie that it\n\nwas a Jackalope, a fictitious animal of the area, a rabbit\n\nwith horns like an antelope. I later found a post card with a\n\npicture of a lope, as we called them for short. I don't know\n\nhow long she was fooled, but, now she is middle aged and I'm\n\nsure she no longer believes in lopes.\n\nThe next day, our fourth of the trip, was a very exciting\n\nday. Like all the days and nights of the trip, the sky\n\nremained clear. Just when we thought we couldn't take another\n\nday of flat countryside, their came the mountains as if they\n\nrose abruptly out of the plains. For some reason I wanted to\n\nchange my cloths before getting into Denver so I stopped and\n\nwent under the highway in a dry river bed where I saw a very\n\nlarge king snake watching me from a nearby rock. I wasn't\n\nsure just what kind it was at first and went hopping back to\n\nthe highway while putting my trousers on.\n\nWe encountered a severe gas shortage in the Denver area.\n\nFortunately we had enough gas to get well out of the area and\n\nup in the mountains we found a gas station with no attendant,\n\nyou had to put one dollar bills in the pump like a vending\n\nmachine. We had a couple of ones and got enough to get us to\n\na town that had gas, I believe it was Durango Co. We came\n\nupon a hail storm in the mountains and I thought it would\n\nbrake the windshield. We found pock marks on the roof of the\n\ncar. Before stopping for the night, near Durango, we went\n\nthrough a long tunnel under a mountain, and also we found a\n\nplace where we could make snowballs in August, high up in the\n\nRockies. It got very cold in our tent that night, but, we\n\nwere prepared and slept comfortably in our sleeping bags\n\ninstead of on top of them as we had done previously. We took\n\na picture of the tunnel and some high country scenery. I\n\nenjoyed experiencing the freezing temperature in the middle\n\nof summer. It made me realize once again that the Tao is\n\nall powerful and that I am influenced profoundly by the Tao,\n\nwhile the Tao itself remains unshakable.\n\nThe fifth day of our excursion took us over some very\n\nimpressive mountains but by mid-day we\n\nwere out of the mountains and into a semi-desert area. Here we\n\nfound some dinosaur tracks and stopped also, at the four corners\n\nwhere Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah meet. The only place\n\nin the US where four states come together and a national\n\nsite. We continued traveling southwest through the Painted\n\nDesert which seemed very western and very colorful. Like I\n\nremembered from the cowboy movies I enjoyed as a youth. We\n\npitched our tents for the night in the middle of this desert\n\narea in the village square in a small community. There was an all night gas station near bye and we were welcomed to use the rest rooms. All night long I had to be careful not to move\n\naround too much as cactus spears would poke through the\n\nbottom of the tent, sleeping bag and blankets and everything\n\nelse I could find to protect myself. Still every now and then\n\nduring the night I got the point, when rolling over. This\n\ncampsite was on the Hopi reservation. Coal had been\n\ndiscovered on the reservation and, since the government\n\ndidn't know about the coal when they promised the land would\n\nalways belong to the Hopis, they were in the process of\n\nslowly driving this very colorful people off the land. When\n\nthe miners came in, they would show no respect for the Hopi's\n\ncorn fields with their bulldozers etc. I had further contact\n\nwith Hopis later in life, but that is another story.\n\nLater; Day number six of this trek took us to a town called North\n\nRim on the north rim of the Grand Canyon.\n\nMost of the morning took us along the Vermilion Cliffs and\n\nthe side trip to the canyon rim took us through a beautiful\n\nPonderosa Pine forest.\n\nWe saw the canyon around noon time when it is free of shadows\n\nand took many photos of this amazing place. This was the first\n\nof many trips to the canyon for me. It is a sacred spot for\n\nme just like Joshua Tree and Organ Pipe Cactus National\n\nMonuments. This was, however, the only time I visited the\n\nnorth rim and the only time I drove all the way. Phoenix\n\nbecame a regular stop for me in the 80s. I would fly into Sky\n\nHarbor Airport and rent a car and stay in one of my favorite\n\nhotels. When my work was done and the week end rolled around,\n\nI would start out alone, when I couldn't interest anyone in\n\ngoing along, and head for the canyon and sometimes to the\n\nHopi Reservation to visit my favorite people. OK back to the\n\nnorth rim. After taking several pictures and having a near\n\nnervous collapse when both Ike and Steph got too close to the\n\nedge of the canyon for my taste. There were no railings or\n\nsafety features at that time.\n\nAfter we left the Grand Canyon we went north into Utah and\n\npassed thru Zion National Park. It is a very special place.\n\nOne feature was a four mile tunnel. The mountains in Zion are\n\nof yellow rock. No other place is anything like it. Each time\n\nwe entered a National Park or Monument there was normally a\n\nsubstantial fee involved, which we never paid. We found out\n\nright away that if the car contained someone over 65 years\n\nold the admission was free. I think Ike was actually about 62\n\nat the time, but easily passed for 65. A couple of times the\n\ntoll booth attendant asked for ID and I would shout at Ike as\n\nif he were deaf and he would pretend not to hear. I would\n\nshout \"he wants to see your ID\" and Ike had a pocket full of\n\nvarious ID cards, none of which indicated his date of birth\n\nor age. They always gave up and let us in for free. Stephanie\n\nfound all this horse play by grown men to be hilarious.\n\nThat night we camped at Cedar City Utah. We got the last\n\navailable site as the camp was full. It was a possemans\n\nconvention and everyone in camp was some kind of deputy. We\n\nbehaved ourselves. Just as I was getting dinner ready to\n\nserve Steph wanted to go to the camp headquarters where home\n\nmovies would be shown. She insisted so I gave in. Five\n\nminutes later she was back. When I asked about the movies she\n\nsaid they were all about God and stuff. It seems that the\n\nplace was run by Mormons. For the second night in a row there\n\nwas no place to swim.\n\nOn the seventh day we drove across the Mohave Desert in\n\nsouthern Nevada. Here we saw our first Joshua Trees. We did\n\nnot know what they were. The scene was most unusual but got\n\nboring after a while; Just sand and dry lakes. After a while\n\nwe saw the Sierra Nevada Mountain range rising out of the\n\ndesert. The road we took over the mountains was only open\n\nfrom May through September and it took us up to the snow\n\nline, about 12000 feet. When we finally descended we were in\n\nthe Yosemite Valley and took a little side trip to the falls\n\nwhich afforded a rest while Stephanie made a nervous wreck\n\nout me by climbing around on the huge rocks at the foot of\n\nthe falls.\n\nIt got dark shortly after we left Yosemite. I called my\n\nfriend Bart in San Francisco and decided to drive on to the\n\ncity on the bay and sleep in a bed and shower. Around\n\nmidnight I woke Steph to see the Oakland San Francisco Bridge\n\nTunnel which was recently damaged by an earthquake during the\n\nWorld Series Games.\n\nWe arrived at Bart's and put Steph to bed and partied into\n\nthe night with Bart and Dave. In the morning Rita took\n\nStephanie to the Zoo at Golden Gate Park and had a chance to\n\nride the cable cars and see China Town and take many photos.\n\nOn this, the eighth day of the adventure, we left San\n\nFrancisco heading north across the Golden Gate and followed\n\nHighway 101 toward the Redwoods. We camped about two hours to\n\nthe north of SF in a remote campsite occupied only by a family of\n\nback packers from Kingston, New York. All of the redwood\n\ntrees in this area had been cut down. You could walk into\n\nthe woods and find giant stumps. We climbed onto one of these\n\nstumps and found it to be about 15 feet across and flat as a\n\ndance floor. We did an imitation of Fred Astaire and Ginger\n\nRogers which made us hungry. After dinner, sitting by the\n\nfire, I was moved to tears over the demise of these giant\n\ntrees, older than Christianity.\n\nEarly in the morning of the ninth day we stopped at a nice\n\nmunicipal beach, on the Pacific, around Eureka, California\n\nand took some nice photos. We followed highway 101 north\n\nthrough the Redwood National Park. Here, a very small\n\npercentage of the original redwoods remains untouched, thanks\n\nto Teddy Roosevelt. The highway winds through the woods like\n\na snake, as no trees could be cut down in it's path. Ike\n\nreminded Stephanie that the squirrels must be as big as dogs\n\njudging by the size of the trees. I think that of all the\n\nplaces we saw on the entire trip, this was the most\n\nimpressive. It has never been convenient for me to return to\n\nthe Redwoods, but I remember it as a very sacred spot. Vivian\n\nand I later visited the Sequoia National Park which is\n\nsimilar. The sequoia trees are high up in the Sierras while\n\nthe Redwoods is a rain forest. The undergrowth is just as\n\nspectacular as the trees. It is mostly covered with high\n\nferns 5 to 8 feet tall. The Redwoods took many centuries to\n\nget that big and foresters theorize that conditions may no\n\nlonger exist for them to grow that big again. There are tests\n\nunder way to find out but we won't know during our life time.\n\nAfter climbing around on redwood logs, with steps cut into\n\nthem so we could hike into the woods, we drove on into Oregon\n\nand spent the night near Grants Pass. We made camp in a site\n\ncalled Natural Bridge. The ponderosa pine woods was growing\n\nout of old lava beds, which is how the natural bridge was\n\nformed. The ground was covered with gray volcanic ash making\n\nit difficult to keep clean. In the morning I washed in the\n\nriver even though it was the coldest water I ever felt; a\n\nglacial stream. I washed Stephanie's hair in the river and\n\nshe complained a little about the polar bear dunking I gave\n\nher. I was ashamed of how dirty we had gotten, but we did a\n\nfair job, even though the ash almost covered us again before\n\nwe broke camp and moved on. That morning of day 10 we found a\n\nrustic log cabin type restaurant and had pancakes with real\n\nmaple syrup, making the freezing morning ablutions all worth\n\nwhile.\n\nAfter breakfast of day 10, we came upon Crater Lake,\n\nOregon, a very calm lake\n\nin an extinct volcano. The banks of the lake were too steep\n\nand to dangerous for us to get down to the lake, so we followed\n\nsome of the hiking trails along the rim. The water was the\n\nbluest blue I've ever seen.\n\nThe next stop was at a laundry where we washed and dried all\n\nof our very dirty clothes and bedding. We continued northward\n\nto Bend Or. and then headed due east and stopped at a campsite on\n\nthe Boise River either in Oregon or Idaho near the border.\n\nThat night the campsite had showers which was nice. We saw\n\nraccoons getting into the garbage cans.\n\nOn the morning of day 11, before stopping for breakfast, we\n\nstopped at a scenic site, on the way up the side of a\n\nmountain range. This was a breath taking scene, overlooking a\n\ndesert as colorful as any we had seen thus far. The area is\n\npart of what is called \"The Great Basin\", a high desert area.\n\nA lone man in a van pulled into the parking area while we\n\nwere there. We talked with him about the scenery and found\n\nthat he was a retired widower enjoying a vacation. He was\n\ntraveling in the opposite direction from us.\n\nWe took some back roads through Idaho, taking us to the Craters of\n\nThe Moon National Monument. This spot is used sometimes for\n\nmaking movies about the moon. The landscape in similar.\n\nAround noontime we stopped at a general store, to pick up\n\nlunch, in a town called Corral, Idaho, with a population of\n\n7 people. It was warm and a dog was sleeping outside and when\n\nwe went inside we found the store keeper sound asleep in a\n\nchair. After we pick up our groceries the man was still\n\nsleeping. We had put gas in the car and could not, in good\n\nconscience, leave without paying for it. We tried several\n\ndifferent ways of making noise with no success. Finally the\n\ndog woke up enough to bark a couple of times and the man woke\n\nup and all was well.\n\nThat afternoon we followed the Snake River for a ways and by\n\nevening we found ourselves in Jackson, Wyoming. We checked\n\nout a campsite in Jackson where the owners made derogatory\n\nremarks about the length of our hair, so Ike and I decided\n\nnot to spend the night. Steph did not understand, but we\n\nexplained that we could camp in the Grand Teton National Park\n\nfor free and all was well. We found a good spot and set up\n\ncamp in the middle of an elk reserve.\n\nWe awoke on the morning of day twelve to find our water had\n\nfrozen over night. We were very high in the mountains. We had\n\nbreakfast at Jackson Hole in a large teepee with a roaring\n\nfire in the middle and picnic tables like spokes of a wheel\n\nsurrounding it. We had all we could eat of ham, eggs and\n\npancakes. They had buffalo steaks on the lunch menu, but we\n\nwere in Yellowstone by lunch time. Our favorite spot in the\n\nGrand Tetons was at Jenny Lake. The Tetons are some\n\nof the most Rugged in the US and they remind me of the Saw Tooth\n\nRange in Idaho.\n\nAt Yellowstone Park we visited Old Faithful and rested for a\n\nwhile waiting for the geyser to do what it does. We drove\n\nnorthward from the Tetons through Yellowstone and drove\n\naround the circle in Yellowstone\n\nand left the park by the eastern gate. We stopped at one point\n\nto watch a moose grazing in a bog. That afternoon we drove\n\nthrough Cody, and Greybull, Wyoming toward the Devil's Tower\n\nNational Monument.\n\nI am not sure if we took in the Tower on this afternoon or\n\nthe next morning, but it was a very interesting place. On the\n\nway into the Monument Grounds you go through a large colony\n\nof prairie dogs. The park ranger told Stephanie that it was\n\nuseless to try to get them to eat out of your hand. \"They are\n\njust too timid\" he said. None the less, we got a photo of a\n\nprairie dog taking a piece of bread from Stephanie's hand.\n\nOn this, the 12th night, we made camp on the banks of a very\n\nclear river in which we could see brook trout, doing what\n\ntrout do. During the night we could hear mules or donkeys\n\nbaying, they kept us awake for a while.\n\nThe 13th day was very eventful as we stopped at the Mount\n\nRushmore Monument. It is interesting that, during the\n\ndepression, someone convinced the Congress to appropriate\n\nmoney for this mammoth carving. To me, it seems like a\n\nterrible thing to do to a perfectly attractive mountain in\n\nthe beautiful Black Hills of South Dakota.\n\nWe stopped again in Rapid City, SD, at a road side zoo which\n\nfeatured a raccoon playing basketball, a skill that is\n\npractically useless for raccoons. We spent a good\n\nportion of the afternoon on Interstate 90 through The\n\nBadlands and camped near Mitchell, SD.\n\nOn the morning of the 14th day we drove south on Interstate 29 to\n\nCouncil Bluffs, Iowa and picked up I 80 east, driving into\n\nIllinois by nightfall.\n\nThe next day, number 15 of the trip,\n\nwe drove the rest of the way home by nightfall. We had the\n\npictures developed and Stephanie still has copies. Ike had\n\nslides made from the pictures that he took. They were very\n\ncolorful.\n\nHoneywell\n\nDuring my 10+ years working at Honeywell Bull, I acquired a\n\nreputation for being a person who could communicate well with\n\ntechnical students from Oriental countries. Because of this\n\nreputation I spent most of my time, with people from China,\n\nIndonesia, Korea and Thailand. This experience required two\n\nskills other than the technical. One was to communicate with\n\nthose with minimal English vocabulary other than technical\n\nterms, and the second was to teach through an interpreter.\n\nSince I spoke only English, and the interpreters generally\n\nhad little technical expertise, sometimes it would be\n\ndifficult to get the points across and knowing if they were\n\nunderstood.\n\nThese groups were generally taught at sites like Boston,\n\nPhoenix, Los Angeles, Seattle, Paris or Angers, France,\n\nLondon, Helsinki and others. Since I was always away from\n\nhome during these encounters, I spent much more time with\n\nthese people than I would have otherwise. I took groups on\n\nweek end excursions to New York, Niagara Falls, Disney Land\n\nand Universal Studios in Los Angeles and many other\n\ninteresting places.\n\nI became interested in Buddhism when I met Ross, in\n\nthe 1960s, who introduced me to the writings of Herman Hesse,\n\nand I became a Buddhist before I ever met any Orientals, but\n\nthe encounters with the Easterners allowed me to see the\n\ninfluence that these ancient philosophies have had on at\n\nleast two thirds of today's world population.\n\nWhen Buddhism came to China, from India, Confucian\n\nthought, influenced by the Taoists, followers of Lao-Tzu, was\n\nthe most prevalent philosophy of the sages. When Buddhism\n\ncame along, with its rituals borrowed from ancient Hindusm,\n\nand merged with the Confucian-Toaists it became something\n\nmore appealing to the masses. Without thinking about it as\n\nreligion, the Chinese people live these traditions in their\n\ndaily lives.\n\nI consider myself a Taoist (pronounced dowist). Since Taoism,\n\nalthough it has a text or liturgy, does not itself provide a\n\nreligious practice, I choose to practice Nichiren Shoshu\n\nBuddhism. It is a beautiful practice providing a way to get\n\nin touch with the Buddha's enlightenment through chanting\n\ncertain parts of the Lotus Sutra, written for that very\n\npurpose. This practice in no way conflicts with my Taoist\n\nphilosophy. It seems to be possible to practice a religion without\n\nadopting its philosophy.\n\nDuring my tenure at Honeywell and later in my own business I\n\njoined frequent flyer programs and I earned many free tickets\n\nfrom American Airlines, United Airlines, USAir, Northwest,\n\nPan Am, TWA, Delta, South West, Eastern, Continental and\n\nRepublic Airlines. I generally used the free tickets to take\n\nsomeone along on a trip.\n\nShad\n\nIn 1983 I had two free tickets from American Airlines, that\n\nhad to used before January first of 1984, which I used them\n\nto take my grandson [Shad] on a tour of the West, leaving on\n\nthe day after Christmas, 1983, when Shad was about 11.\n\nWe flew from Rochester to Chicago and had a couple of hours\n\nto kill at O'hare Airport, the busiest airport in the world.\n\nSo, I took Shad to the roof of the parking garage where you\n\ncan see the several runways, in all four directions. The\n\nhighway that enters the airport passes under a couple of\n\nthese runways and sometimes I have passed under planes that\n\nwere landing or taking off. Anyway, this is where Shad\n\nlearned to Identify the 707, 727, 737, 747, 757, 767, DC8,\n\nDC9, DC10, L1011, BAC111 and other smaller piston driven\n\naircraft. We left Chicago on my first ride on a 767, which\n\nwas Boeing's latest jumbo jet and landed in early afternoon\n\nat Sky Harbor in Phoenix.\n\nFrom Phoenix we drove southwest, through a cloudburst, to\n\nGilla Bend where we stayed overnight. In the morning we drove\n\nour rented Suburu south to Organ Pipe Cactus National\n\nMonument, one of my favorite places. This was the rainy\n\nseason in Arizona. We encountered an occasional downpour, but\n\nmost of the time it was sunny and 60 to 70 degrees, which\n\nseemed quite warm since leaving behind, in New York, some\n\nbrutally cold weather. We crossed into Mexico, on foot, at\n\nGringo Pass where we looked around at the poverty there and\n\nwere glad to get back to the USA with a few pesos we got in\n\nchange from buying a post card. We gave them a US dollar and\n\ngot back a pocket full of Mexican change.\n\nOrgan Pipe was especially beautiful on this trip. More\n\nrecently, I dropped into Organ Pipe with Butch and found\n\nthat, for some strange reason, the Organ Pipe Cacti are\n\ndying. I was deeply moved, since this is the only place\n\nwhere this beautiful plant can be found.\n\nOn each occasion that I visit this holy spot, I drive around\n\na 20 mile loop through the park. On this drive you get to see\n\nthe Sonoran Desert at it's best. Also, you can see a mountain\n\nthat has a natural hole in it through which you can see the\n\nsun, if you go at the right time of day which is just before\n\nsundown. In this sacred spot I thought about my belief in\n\nthe Tao and how it differs from traditional beliefs in a God.\n\nThe Tao, in my belief, doesn't care at all whether or not I\n\nbelieve in it. The Tao watches over everything and every one\n\nwith the same amount of compassion. The Tao is the mystic\n\nforce within the universe that controls every movement within\n\nthe most minute of particles as well as galaxies. The Tao is\n\nwhat we return to when we die. It matters not what happens in\n\nthis life time, in the Taoist's mind, as we will return to\n\nlive another life and another and another until we obtain\n\nnirvana and become content to join the Tao forever. During\n\nall of these life times we will become every kind of plant\n\nand animal life many times over. When it seems like there is no\n\nfairness in this life I remember that all is fair when spread\n\nover many lifetimes. We will sometime become that\n\nperson that we hate the most, that person that we want to put\n\nto death. The next fly that you swat could be me or yourself.\n\nThis is why I try to show reverence for all living things and\n\ntry to use no more than needed. I have always searched out\n\nthese spots where I can feel completely at peace and one with\n\nthe Tao who can't be swayed into giving me preferential\n\ntreatment by talking to it in my closet or reciting certain\n\npassages from the holy books. However, (The English books say\n\nnot to begin a sentence with the word however. However, there\n\nare always exceptions.) when I meditate or chant the Lotus\n\nSutra, I can feel the warmth of the Tao. I enjoy feeling It's\n\ninfluence on an extremely hot or cold day, reminding me of my\n\nfrailty in the face of the Tao.\n\nI remember talking to Shad about Taoism on this trip. I\n\nwonder if he remembers. He must have been 10 or eleven years\n\nold. about the same age that Steph was on our earlier tour\n\nof the nation by car.\n\nAfter leaving Organ Pipe we drove north through Why, Ajo, the\n\nlower Sonoran Desert, and crossed over some lava ranges\n\ncalled The Sauceda Mts., Sand Tank Mts., Maracopa Range,\n\nSierra Estrella Mts. and the Big Horn Mts. and stopped for\n\nthe night at the Best Western Motel in Wickenburg, Arizona. I have\n\nstayed at this motel, also, with Chuck Lyons, with Vivian and\n\nseveral times all by myself. The restaurant connected serves\n\nthe best breakfast anyone could ask for.\n\nIn the morning we drove north on US 89, over a mountain\n\nrange, climbing from the warm Sonora Desert through a snow\n\ncovered mountain pass in the Prescott National Forest and\n\nthen down again to Prescott, Arizona. Leaving Prescott behind\n\nwe took US 89 Alt. through Jerome, a ghost town that was once\n\na thriving silver mining town. After looking around Jerome,\n\non the side of Mingus Mountain overlooking the high desert\n\narea between there and Sedona. In Sedona, we stopped for\n\nlunch at one of my favorite restaurants, the Oaxaca.\n\nwhich is on the second floor and through a large picture\n\nwindow you can view the red rocks surrounding the town. We\n\nclimbed out of Sedona winding up through Oak Creek Canyon\n\nwith many Hairpin turns continuing on 89A to Flagstaff which\n\nis about 7000 feet above sea level and gets a fair amount of\n\nsnow in winter. After visiting Walnut Creek Canyon with it's\n\nIndian cliff dwellings, some well preserved and we could go\n\ninside, we drove through a snow covered forest to the\n\nGrand Canyon. This was a unique experience as the\n\nupper walls of the canyon were spotted with snow, yet you could look\n\ndown at the canyon floor which looked hot in the afternoon sun.\n\nWe lingered until late afternoon and then cut through a corner\n\nof the painted desert then over the San Francisco Mountains\n\nand back to Flagstaff after dark. We checked into the Pony\n\nSoldier Motel, went to a Mexican restaurant for enchiladas, then\n\nslept soundly for the rest of the night.\n\nThe next morning we drove East on I-40 to Winslow where we\n\nhad a cowboy breakfast at a desert lunch counter. Shad was at\n\nsuch an age that he required huge portions of food and we had\n\nlittle trouble around those parts. We then headed south on 87\n\nthrough the Coconino National Forest and Payson Arizona and\n\nshortly thereafter turned southeast on a back road in the\n\nTonto National Forest. This route took us to Tonto Basin and\n\nthe Roosevelt Dam. From there we took a dirt road for over 30\n\nmiles on the Apache Trail to Apache Jct. near Phoenix and\n\nstayed overnight in Carefree. Carefree was surrounded by huge\n\nrocks and looked like you might run into the Flintstones\n\nanyplace in town where all of the business establishments\n\nwere built around that theme.\n\nThe next morning we took a breakfast flight from Phoenix to\n\nChicago and on to Rochester and home by afternoon as we\n\nlost three hours that day. We still have photos of the trip\n\nincluding the Pear Cactus which was in bloom throughout the upper Sonoran Desert.\n\n==========================\n\nAs Lord Buckley Always Said\n\n\"What a great thing it is to be alive. My Lords, my Ladies, Beloveds, would it embarrass you very much if I were to tell you that I love you?\" Clinking glasses, murmurs and nervous laughter would be heard as Buckley paused, then whispered, \"It embarrasses you, doesn't it?\"\n\n====================================\n\nMy (Burr Cook) Relationship\n\nto John Alden And Priscilla Mullins\n\nof Mayflower Fame\n\nMy Branch of the Mayflower family\n\nFirst Generation\n\n1.

I failed that grade and several others until the School Board insisted that I be seen\n\nby a doctor. The doctor found no reason for my lack of good study habits, but, I think, both of my\n\nparents felt that something was wrong and as a result I was treated differently from my siblings\n\nin regard to discipline. I'm sure that my clashes with the academic world caused embarrassment\n\nfor the entire family. Adelaide had 9 children an admirable job raising them all and all turned out\n\nto be fine citizens. -The above was written by Burr (Buster) Cook.\n\nCelestia Cynthia Burr (Elisha, Aaron, Ebenezer, John, Samuel, Benjamin, Mr.) was born\n\non 17 Apr 1815 in Norfolk, Conn.. She died on 11 Oct 1896 in Clarendon, Orleans Co. New York. She was buried in Hillside Cemetary in Holly, Orleans Co. NY.\n\nI believe that Celestia was born in Norfolk Conn. , but her name is not on record at the Norfolk\n\nTown Hall. It may be that she was born somewhere else, since I have no proof. I was able to\n\nfind the birth record for Her father Elisha, on file in Norfolk. Dewitt and Celestia were both Methodists.\n\nShe lived first 18 years in Conn. accompanied parents to Sprinwater, NY, later to Clarendon, Orleans Co.\n\nResources: (1) Cook Family Bible; (2): Grave stone at Hillside Cemetery in Holly, Orleans County, NY.\n\nCelestia married Dewitt Clinton Cook son of Miles Cook and Matilda Coleman about Sep 1839 in North Bergen, New York. Dewitt was born on 16 Aug 1813 in Pompey, Onondaga County, NY. He died on 8 Mar 1884 in Clarendon, NY. He was buried in Hillside Cemetary in Holly, NY.\n\nDewitt came to Western NY. with his father before his marriage and settled at North Bergen,\n\nGenesee County, in 1840 he was residing in Clarendon with his wife where they lived the rest\n\nof their lives. Dewitt was a carpenter or house joiner by trade, he built many of the frame\n\nBuildings of the town, homes, farm buildings and schools that are still standing. His residence\n\nwas on Upper Holly Road at lot 152 which consisted of 48 acres, a short distance north of\n\nwhat is now the Brown Schoolhouse Road. He was a member of the Orleans Pioneer.\n\nHis wives were born at Norfolk, Conn. Their church affiliation was Methodist. The children\n\nwere all born at Clarendon.\n\nSarah C. Burr was the first wife of Dewitt. Sarah died on march 2, 1839 at age 20 due to\n\ncomplications of giving birth to George Newton, Dewitts first son. During the next several\n\nmonths, while Dewitt was at work, Sarah's older sister Celestia cared for and became attached\n\nto the child, who was sickly and required constant care. on Sept. 9, 1839 George\n\nNewton died at age 7 months and 13 days. Dewitt and Celestia, both grieving deeply over\n\nthe loss of the child, took refuge in each other and married shortly thereafter. Together they\n\nhad three more children and there are literally hundreds of living ancestors like myself.\n\nDewitt is buried at Hillside cemetery in Holly, Orleans Co. NY. Also buried there are his\n\nwives and three children. This Cook family plot is in a beautiful place on a hillside in a grove\n\nof large trees. The cemetery is terraced and is a nice place to walk and enjoy the out of doors.\n\nResources: (1) Cook Family Bible; (2): Grave stone at Hillside Cemetery in Holly, Orleans County, NY\n\nDewitt and Celestia had the following children:\n\n+ 1315 M i.

The year I was\n\nborn, 1934, saw the closing of both the Post Office and the\n\nRailroad Station. The hamlet, once a thriving village had been in\n\ndecline since the fire of 1910.\n\nEarly settlers in Orleans were Wheats, Fergusons, Shekels,\n\nand the Baggerlys, many of whom brought and kept slaves\n\nuntil they were outlawed in New York in 1826.\n\nThe Current Baptist Church is the third on the site. It\n\nburned in 1845 and in 1910.\n\nIn 1845 the records show Orleans with two churches, two\n\nhotels, three shoe shops, three blacksmith shops, a potash\n\nfactory, a distillery, a tin shop, a tailor shop, a wood\n\nturning shop, a harness shop, boot factory, tannery,\n\nslaughter house, a saw mill and grist mill at the falls in\n\nflint creek, a carding mill specializing in monks cloth and\n\nthere were three doctors and a post office.\n\nThe village was originally called Hardscrabble because there\n\nwere, of course, no bridges originally and it was a hard\n\nscrabble getting from one side of town to the other, up and\n\ndown the creek banks. The inhabitants were particularly fond\n\nof Andrew Jackson's valor in the battle of New Orleans and\n\nshortly after the 1812 war Hardscrabble became Orleans, which\n\nnow possessed a bridge (built in 1816). One Elijah Goodale\n\nwas killed in the bridges construction.\n\nIn the late 1800s Orleans had a coronet band which travelled\n\naround in a colorful wagon drawn by 4 horses. In the band\n\nwere John Runyan, Eben Potter, the Blythe boys, the Lambs and\n\nRulisons and others.\n\nOn April 10, 1910, a fire destroyed 23 homes and businesses\n\nin Orleans, including 120 tons of coal. The town never\n\nrecovered from that loss and evolved into the sleepy town\n\nthat I grew up in.\n\nOne of the high points of life in Orleans was in the 1940s,\n\nduring the war we had a severe snow storm and the trains\n\ncould not get through the drifts. One day while watching the\n\ntrainmen work, Ed Preston and I were invited into the steam\n\nlocomotive and actually allowed to pull the lever which\n\nstarted and stopped the train as it shuttled back and forth\n\ndoing it's work. That was exciting.\n\n=======================\n\nThe Depot at Orleans\n\nI am not sure what the source or date of this article is. If anyone knows please let me know as I would like to include credits.\n\nThe Station closed the year that I was born, 1934.\n\nMy father, in partnership with my uncle, Doug Wager, bought the building. Portions of it were used to put a three room addition on the Cook family home\n\non the other side of Flint Creek. One outstanding feature that still exists is the slate roof.\n\nThe Depot was located just south of the water tower.\n\nThis house belonged to the Green family. It was across the tracks from the Depot.\n\nYou can see the old lower bridge in the background. I watched the house burn\n\nfrom our house across the creek when I was very young.\n\nLemuel Cook\n\nLast survivor of the revolution as was claimed he most likely was not. He was, however, the\n\nlast surviving pensioner of the Revolutionary War.\n\nMany of the news paper articles written about him are incorrect in several\n\nrespects especially concerning his age at death. It is quoted as 105, 106 and 107.\n\nMilitary records show however that he joined the army in 1780 at age 16 and\n\ndied in 1866 making him 102. I recommend the book\n\n\"The Revolution's Last Men\" by Don N. Hagist.\n\nRecently a marker\n\nwas erected in Clarendon giving his age as 107.\n\n========================================================\n\nPhelpstown Footprints\n\nby Mabel E. Oaks\n\nIn early times Orleans was a prosperous, thriving community with Clifton Springs--then Brimstone Springs--left far behind it in activity. Mrs. Sidney L Wheat Sr., whose late husband was a great great grandson of the 1795 Orleans pioneer Benjamin Wheat Sr., has compiled many scrapbooks which reveal in picture and in print both the old and new Orleans (before and after the fire). Practically all the following facts on Orleans were given me by Mrs. Wheat and are printed here with her permission.\n\nHer November 15, 1961 Geneva Times article told of the Baggerly family's 1805 arrival from Maryland. The well-to-do Baggerlys, Fergusons and Shekells all brought\n\nslaves as did other settlers from the south. These must have been freed at least by 1826 when New York State outlawed slavery. It was Benjamin Shekell who founded Clifton Springs and built a mansion there in 1800. Conover's History says that the Shekell slaves were well provided with homes when freed--equally true of other Phelpstown slaves, we assume.\n\nHenry Baggerly, a strong Methodist, soon had built a meeting house on the northwest corner of Case and Wheat Roads; its burying ground across the road is now hidden in a little grove of trees. The gravestones of Henry and his wife have been moved close to the road and carefully embedded in cement inside a railed enclosure. After Mr. Baggerly's death a new Methodist church was erected in the village itself about 1835. This fine large steepled building was later sold for use as a Presbyterian Church. In the 1890s services were discontinued, and the ufortunIate edifice was sold to become a fruit evaporator; it burned to the ground in 1902. The settlement's other church, the third Baptist Society of Phelpstown, was established 1819; the very next year a $2000 building arose on the site of the present church. Burned in 1845, it was rebuilt but burned again in the disastrous 1910 fire. So today's Church is the third on the same spot.\n\nOne of Mrs. Wheat's scrapbooks contains this authentic and remarkable record of Orleans public buildings and businesses in the year 1845; the list was gathered by an old time resident from those still older.\n\nTwo Churches--one school--five general stores, two hotels, three shoe shops, three blacksmith shops, potash factory, distillery, tin, tailor and harness shops, wood turning and boot manufactories, a tannery and slaughter house. As for mills--there were one saw and two grist mills. In addition a carding mill near the upper bridge specialized in making monk's cloth.\n\nThey say the stores did many thousands of dollars worth of business. One grist mill and the saw mill stood opposite each other on the creek banks; at its end of the dam each had a wooden flume whose deep stream raced toward a wheel. Often in springtime the dam would go out with the ice and have to be rebuilt. Flint Creek at such times never knew its own strength. Phelps town mill owners frequently lost heavfiy in spring when trees and timbers came floating down to destroy dams and bridges. The old three-and-a-half story, frame grist mill stood until 1930 when fire destroyed it. Around 1900 the village had a wagon, sleigh and harness shop for both manufacture and repair, a corn planter factory, four evaporators and a large vineyard industry.\n\nOrleans had for years its resident doctors--Dr. Lewis, Dr. William Turck and Dr. G. Y. Armington. Its early school had fine teachers--for instance, Richard P. Marvin who became a New York State Supreme Court Justice just as did, many years later, Chief Justice Earle S. Warner, distinguished descendant of Orleans pioneer Jesse Warner of Warner Hill. Richard Marvin, his brothers Erastus and William (afterward a Judge) taught in our town schools in the 1820s and 1830s while they studied law with Thomas Smith Esq., Phelps town’s very first attorney. Dolphin Stephenson, son of Harvey S., an 1800 Orleans settler, practiced law for years at Phelps village in the Eacker block, east corner of Main and Church Streets. Phelps has had many outstanding lawyers, and this tradition continues.\n\nOrleans had a post office for 100 years, most of that time with daily mail. This closed in 1934. Its newspaper, \"The Asteroid,\" was being printed by the Geneva Courier office in 1879. Just after the Civil War large slate quarries were opened along the Creek. Some of the slate was ground to make a plastic roofing material.\n\nThe prizewinning Orleans Cornet Band, once famous, drove to all sorts of area events as far away as Rochester and Sodus Point. The painted bandwagon smartly drawn by four horses, its uniformed occupants and their paraphernalia must have been a colorful sight. The wagon had seats on each side for about ten men (twenty in all) with room for their instruments in the middle. John Runyan, Eben Potter the whistler, the Rulisons and Blythe boys, the four Lambs (one a drum major), Sumner and Ed Ferguson. Drummers, were a few of the band members, Mr. Briglin tells me. Sumner's big bass drum is now in Oaks Corners Museum, the gift of Glenn Sheldon. After the railroad went through, the station waiting room was often used by the band for practice sessions; they played home town concerts on the hotel balcony. Orleans men--musicians or not--used to pile into the big wagon to ride down to Phelps village on town meeting days.\n\n\"Henpeck,\" northeast of Orleans, was really School District 22, established 1829. The old brick schoolhouse stands empty where Schroo Rd joins Route 88. Folk living near the school were said to be from Henpeck. Thereby may hang a long forgotten tale of some unhappy husband. There is another version of the nickname's origin; some say one Hen (ry) Peck was trustee so long that the district took his name.\n\nThe fearful fire of April 10, 1910 was discovered by Mr. Jesse Briglin whose family were barely able to escape their house in night clothing. Twenty one buildings were destroyed, including seven homes, the Baptist Church, town hall, warehouses, barns and school. This school was a two-story brick building erected 1882; its upper floor was a hall for both school and public purposes. Joseph Blythe's coal shed with 120 tons of coal caught fire; over half the coal burned and continued burning for days. The hamlet never recovered from this blow.\n\nOne of Rev. Anson Titus' historical articles tells the origin of the community's name. First nicknamed Hardscrabble, it received its permanent title at the close of the War of 1812-15 after Gen. Andrew Jackson had won the Battle of New Orleans and so saved a large area from the British. Local admirers of the soldier hero suggested his victory be commemorated by naming their hamlet Orleans. Jackson was then the idol of a large part of the American people. In 1818 he led the Seminole War to its successful end, became Governor of Florida in 1821 and seven years later was in the White House as seventh President of the United States.\n\nAn old obituary I recently read was on the death of a daughter of Elijah Goodale and relates to Orleans. I quote: \"Her father, Elijah Goodale, a Phelps pioneer, was killed Sept.21, 1816, at the setting of the sun just as he was completing the bridge across Flint Creek at Orleans.\" Elijah's bridge may have been the first one there. If the creek had to be forded and the steep banks climbed until 1816, little wonder the place was called \"Hardscrabble.\" Elijah was undoubtedly of the same family as Solomon Goodale, Orleans Baptist preacher and 1796 first town clerk of Phelps. The Elijah Goodale listed in the 1867 Directory as owner of an Orleans hotel and carriage shop was probably a son.\n\n==============================================\n\nWilliam Kunstler\n\nWilliam Moses Kunstler is a lawyer that most have heard of.\n\nI remember many an afternoon or evening spent in his Greenwich Village home. I was flattered that he accepted me as a friend and\n\nshared some of his idle time with me.\n\nBen\n\nSometime, maybe around the year 2000 give or take 5 years or so, I started feeling my age. I loved the far western states where I had visited on my many trips for Honeywell Information Systems which later became Bull Computer Systems. I longed to see the west one more time and I knew that if I waited much longer I would be too old to make it. I wasn’t feeling well. I had been sickly for quite some time and saw little chance of improvement. So I decided that if I was going to do it now was the time. I had it in mind to see the redwoods again but didn’t make it that far. I had an out dated station wagon that was seeing its last days and coughed and sputtered a little and didn’t want to climb above seven or eight thousand feet. I didn’t want to go alone so I checked around for a companion found that Ben wanted to go.\n\nI had purchased 4 spare tires on rims cheap and since the tires on the wagon weren’t good I strapped the spares on the roof. We loaded up with a tent, food and many blankets and sleeping bags and were off. We got off to a late start so we camped in western Pa. The site had a large swimming area and showers and a store for snacks.\n\nOn our drive through Ohio we passed the ball park of the Cleveland Indians and the followed the shore of Lake Erie. We stopped to wash up in the lake and I cautioned Ben about the slippery rocks the I promptly fell into the lake myself.\n\nWe followed Rt. 6 through Indiana to Chicago and passed the White Socks Stadium and the Sears Bldg. the tallest in the US. Illinois was rather boring as was Iowa except for the flooding which caused a rather lengthy detour. In Nebraska things started to become more interesting to us and it remained such for the rest of the trip. I tried to make it interesting as possible for Ben but was somewhat hampered by the fact that I wasn’t feeling well as my health was in decline. Even with the way I felt I did enjoy most of the trip. We followed the North Platte River and stopped for a good swim. At one point we realized that we were only a few miles from Kansas so we took a little side trip to see what it felt like to be in Kansas.\n\nThe terrain started become less flat and in Colorado we finally saw mountains rising out of the plains. We could soon make out the glaciers in the mts. On the way up the mountain side we came upon a glacial stream or maybe it was a river. We stopped for a couple of hours and Ben spent a couple hours panning for gold. We didn’t get rich. I don’t know how he could stand the ice cold water coming from melting snow further up the Mt.\n\nWhen we started up the mountain again the car started to stutter and soon quit altogether. We were on a steep climb and were able to back up into a parking area and stopped at such an angle with the back of the car heading slightly up hill and we were able to start coasting downhill and soon the car started.\n\nOn the way down we saw a large group of long horn sheep. We were on the way to Rocky Mountain National Park but never got that high up. I thought about getting the carburetor adjusted for higher altitude but didn’t because I thought my might screw things up worse. Instead we turned north to a highway that missed the high mountains.\n\nStill in Col. Headed for Cheyenne we came upon an interesting formation of boulders and played on them for a while. On the way back to the car Ben found a huge pile of fire crackers. I cautioned him not to take any with us as they are not legal in all states but I knew that he had hidden a substantial supply in his sack in the car. Mostly I was afraid he might get hurt with them. Occasionally he would set one off behind me and scare the shit out of me.\n\nBack on the road we continue into Wyoming and Cheyenne then Laramie where we had a Mexican lunch and checked into a motel called the Laramie Motel. About 3am the phone rang. It was a prostitute. Many of the motels in the west have hookers especially on truck routes. She started out by asking me if I knew what time it was and I said it’s the middle of the damn night. When she got around to making her proposition I said no thank you and hung up the phone since I didn’t think Ben would be interested either. Besides he was sleeping.\n\nThe next day we came upon a house made entirely of dinosaur bones. It was a tourist attraction so being tourists we went inside and discovered that there was fee. It was worth a small fee as they had many old western memorabilia. There was an old lady giving a talk about the place and warned us we could check around outside but to be very careful because the area was infested by rattle snakes that year. When we left Ben got in the car very carefully. It is a good habit to not mess with rattle snakes.\n\nI remember a very impressive dam that we drove over and stopped halfway in a parking area for viewing. I’m not sure if the damn dam was in Wyoming or Utah. Anyway we if we were not in Utah then we were very soon. We passed by a National Park having to do with dinosaur bones but we had seen enough of those.\n\nI looked it up on Wiki and found the name is Dinosaur National Monument. I remember that we spent a night in Utah on a lake and slept in the car. We slept in the car several times. We had a lot of clothes, blankets, tents and pillows in the station wagon with the back seats folded down and it was quite comfortable.\n\nNext day we skirted through a corner of Idaho and followed a river to Jackson Wyoming watching some white water rafters. We tried sleeping in a TP but Ben seemed to be breathing hard so we drove down hill to a motel. Morning sa"
