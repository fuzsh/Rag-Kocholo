        "text": "August 5, 2011\n\nApostle of the Haphazard\n\nThe only thing one can say after reading a book like this is: I wish I knew Christ like Oswald Chambers seems to have done. What a faith and what a life. He was kind of like an intellectual Keith Green who said, \"I refuse to worry\" because his life was truly hid in Christ. And like Keith Green, he was a part of what is loosely referred to as the Holiness Movement except Chambers was in at the beginning. Oswald Chambers said “I feel I shall be buried for a time, hidden away in obscurity; then suddenly I shall flame out, do my work and be gone.” His statement was prophetic, except that the divine flame is burning brighter than ever thanks to the printed page. A friend once introduced him as “the apostle of the haphazard” and like the wind Jesus mentions in John 3:8, Chamber’s life appears erratic, but there seemed to be an angel in the whirlwind guiding him to where he was needed and he was used mightily by the Lord.\n\nHe is the posthumous author of over fifty books of which My Utmost for His Highest is the best known. His wife earned her living as a stenographer before their marriage. She could take verbatim notes in shorthand at 250 words a minute, faster than anyone can talk I am sure. She took verbatim notes of all of his talks and sermons and turned them out as books after his death in Zeitoun, Egypt of appendicitis in 1917. He reached thousands for Christ during his life and he has reached millions more after his death and continues to do so. My Utmost for His Highest has been in constant publication since it was first published in 1935 and its popularity shows no sign of waning anytime soon. That is because each of the daily devotionals seems to have been written fresh each morning just for the reader. It is like Oswald Chambers is in the room with you. If you want a summary of all that Chambers taught and his wife faithfully transcribed, it is this: “Jesus only, Jesus ever.”\n\nHe was the son of a Baptist Pastor and was converted under the preaching of Charles Spurgeon and heard D.L. Moody preach. He was born to Victorian era parents who worried about him as parents will because he refused to care about money. He never seemed to actually have a set salary on any of his preaching and teaching. He never owned a home but considered himself and his wife \"spoiled bairns of the Kingdom\" because the Lord always supplied above and beyond what they needed. He was a practically impractical man who always gave hilariously to anyone who asked anytime and any place. When chided for being foolish and warned that he would become an easy mark, he said, \"I believe beggars are sent to test our faith. My duty is plain-to obey the command of God and give to everyone who asks,\" but, he added with a twinkle \"Besides the Lord always gives double for all I give away.\" And He did.\n\nHe went through his own dark night of the soul and came out the other side radiantly in love with Christ. Shortly after being ordained in Dunoon, Scotland(?) and being a sought after speaker in Christian circles his popularity and seeming success only accentuated his growing sense of despair, emptiness and longing. A young local woman accused him of sexual misconduct with her. It was almost more than he could bear although there was no truth to her story and a thorough investigation exonerated him, but the damage had been done. He was misunderstood, shunned, avoided and became the object of whispered gossip in and around Dunoon. Not only was his reputation tarnished, but the charge only served to heighten his awareness of what he was capable of. He knew he had not sinned sexually with her, but he also knew that he could have. \"Within him lurked a frightening pride that was beyond his power to conquer.\"\n\nIt was beyond his power, but not God's. Thing's came to a head in November 1901 and \"then and there I claimed the gift of the Holy Spirit in dogged committal on Luke 11:13.\" He called it a baptism of the Holy Spirit, but I am not sure if he subscribed to the Pentecostal doctrine of a second blessing or not. He was not a Pentecostal in the modern sense and did not believe in speaking in tongues as a sign gift. I prefer to use the term “Baptism of the Holy Spirit” in reference to a believer’s experience at conversion as set forth in 1st Corinthians 12:13. But this special filling of the Spirit resulted in new insights into the Christian life and effectively banished his doubts. \"Glory be to God, the last aching abyss of the human heart is filled to overflowing with the love of God. Love is the beginning, love is the middle and love is the end. After He comes in, all you see is 'Jesus only, Jesus ever'. When you know what God has done for you, the power and tyranny of sin is gone, and the radiant, unspeakable emancipation of the indwelling Christ has come.\" He was filled with the Holy Spirit and unlike most of us, he didn't seem to leak much.\n\nHe left school in 1905 and began a ministry as an itinerate preacher of the gospel in Britain, the United States and Japan. He was a missionary and taught at the Oriental Missionary Society Bible School in Tokyo. He became a “missioner” for the Pentecostal League of Prayer founded by Reader Harris which had to change its name because of confusion with the nascent Pentecostal tongues movement. He married Gertrude Hobbs on May 25th 1910 who was an expert stenographer as noted above. His affectionate nickname for her was Biddy, which was a play on the words Beloved Disciple or B.D., which transmogrified into Biddy. Chambers felt that there was a need for a Bible college in Britain that emphasized personal Christian living as well as academics. With a little help from his friends he founded the Bible Training College at Clapham. The school operated on faith and prayer and when someone offered to endow the school, Chambers refused explaining that, “No, if you do that it will probably go on longer than God means it to.”\n\nThe school lasted until the outbreak of World War One and Chambers sailed with the troops to Zeitoun, Egypt as a Y.M.C.A. Secretary. Where he ministered mightily until his untimely death on November 15th, 1917. He had undiagnosed appendicitis, peritonitis set in and they could not save his life. He reached thousands of soldiers on the very brink of the Valley of the Shadow of Death with the good news of Jesus Christ. Many of them never made it out of that valley and were there to welcome their comrade into the Celestial City. Millions are now grateful for the providential partnership of a faithful wife who was also a genius stenographer and the Apostle of the Haphazard.\n\nMay 29, 2009\n\nI find audio-books difficult, I lose focus and forget to pay attention. This book was a great audio-book, and it kept my attention. My argument this time is that I heard things I wanted to write down and meditate on but couldn't given where I was and that the recording just kept going.\n\nThe book covers his birth, early years in Scotland, his time in London where he accepted Christ as his savior. Then the years when he struggled to understand what God would have him do. Oswald was 27 before he had a real purpose, but he was used by God even before that. I find this reassuring in a world where we should know what we want when we enter college at 18 and then do it well starting in our early 20's. Oswald studied and worked but he spent much of his time and energy growing in his walk with God, seeking His will, and patiently waiting for guidance.\n\nHere are some of the main points I did capture. One of Oswald's sayings was that he wanted to spend and be spent only for God. His work wasn't just a job, it was his life and God was present in everything he did. Related to this was his belief that he should give to whoever asks. He knew that people would take advantage of him, but that was God's to handle. If Oswald gave when he was asked, then God would provide for Oswald. And this is how it worked every single time.''After he married (into his 30's) he and his wife often had no definite plan for the future, but they trusted that God would provide if they only followed His will. He preached around England and Scotland, then they opened a Bible College in London, and God always provided.\n\nI learned quite a bit about his life, including his trips to the US and his time spent in Japan. Then when WWI broke out, he went to Egypt working with the YMCA providing places for the soldiers to eat, socialize, and (at Oswald's camp at least) to pray and hear the Word spoken and preached.\n\nOne way he comforted coworkers and friends, especially while in Egypt during the war, was to not worry so about understanding God's ways. To know that God is love, get deep in that love, and trust God. He felt is was important to know the character of God and work from there.\n\nAfter Oswald's death, the book continues with a very good description of the work his wife undertook to publish his talks and sermons from the Bible College, his traveling preaching time, and the time in Egypt. They were quite a couple and she continued his legacy even after he was gone.\n\nI like a biography that covers the facts, the thoughts, the development of the person's worldview, and how they lived out that worldview. This was a very satisfying biography about an inspiring man.\n\nFebruary 21, 2021\n\nWhat a fascinating life story. I've always found his daily devotional (My Utmost for His Highest) to be challenging, intense, and full of insight. But it was illuminating to learn about his early influences, his varied interests, his travels, relationships, and ministry opportunities from Scotland to Cincinnati, to Japan to London to Egypt and the soldiers of WWI.\n\nWhat stood out to me was his general interest in learning and reading about a variety of subjects, his willingness to go wherever God led (called the \"apostle of the haphazard\"), his disregard for financial income, and his devotion to serving God (rather than trying to be useful in other's eyes).\n\nNovember 12, 2021\n\nI had read \"My Utmost For His Highest\" for years but had never looked into Chamber's life of trust in Jesus which overflowed into his teachings. Getting to soak in Oswald's sayings and writings alone is worth the reading experience.\n\nJune 27, 2024\n\nThis was an interesting biography of Oswald Chambers. I learned a lot and it was sprinkled with diary and letter excerpts in addition to his work. I’m hoping to read my upmost for his highest next.\n\nMarch 30, 2018\n\nI was able to get this book as an audio book and it was nice to be able to listen to it being read to me as I got some work done. I walked away from this book having been encouraged in my own faith.\n\nWhat I Liked: This book practically covered every inch of Oswald Chambers' life, even the history of his parents. By the end, I felt like I new Mr. Chambers, but as he is already with the Lord, I will look forward to being able to meet him someday in eternity.\n\nThis book felt very well researched, yet the book wasn't boring or dry. As the book progressed, I found myself even more enthralled with Mr. Chambers' life work. His focus on loving Jesus more and more every single day and making sure people knew of Jesus' sacrifice for us was inspiring to me. His love for his family and friends was also inspiring. As a prestigious person in the eyes of his students, he wasn't afraid to get down and dirty with the menial jobs and his wife, Biddie, worked well with him and seemed to share the same passion and desire as he--to live well for Christ, not themselves.\n\nI would love to read more on Mrs. Chambers' life. Her selflessness in serving others and helping her husband, not looking for gratitude of any kind, greatly encouraged me to continue being faithful--even in the seemingly 'little' things. I also admired Mr. and Mrs. Chambers' marriage. They had mutual respect and love for each other as they served each other and it was most certainly encouraging.\n\nWhat I Didn't Like: I don't think there was anything I didn't like about this book. It was an excellent look into Oswald Chambers' life.\n\nI give this book 5 stars for an interesting read that I greatly enjoyed.\n\nSeptember 2, 2019\n\nOswald Chambers is best known for his book \"My Utmost for His Highest\", but that book might never had existed were it not for the labors of his faithful wife Biddy. This book tells about Chambers' life, relationship with God, and service to Him in places all over the world. Though his earthly life was short—he died at 43—he touched many while alive and so many more through his writings published after his death.\n\nThis book was a tonic to me, encouraging me to seek a deeper relationship with God and to be more mindful of opportunities to share His love with others. I am convicted of my selfishness in so many areas of my life, and seeing the exuberant joy that Chambers had in giving himself completely to God, I am challenged to do the same.\n\nDecember 7, 2012\n\nThis is a deeply moving story, chronicling the brief life of the author of My Utmost for His Highest and the work of his widow which endeared him to the world. It is easy to see from McCasland's excellent portrayal why Chambers was adored by his students and soldiers. Passionate, intelligent, and playful, Chambers' ardent love for his Savior sparked passion for Christ in many whom he encountered. \"Brighter, clearer and more exquisite is the spiritual within becoming, and my whole being is ablaze and passionately on fire to preach Christ.\" Bonus material at the back of the book-Chambers' poetry, also definitely worth reading.\n\nSeptember 25, 2021\n\nIncredible biography. A well-spent vessel. A faithful instrument of righteous. One who prayed like Mueller while he worked hard in all things. A faithful husband, father, minister, and evangelistic missionary. Grateful for the timely discovery—the story my soul needed. It is a wonder I had never heard of this before. You will never see his devotional the same, after reading this life story.\n\nJanuary 6, 2019\n\nReading the biography of Oswald Chambers brought such depth of meaning to his devotional, “My Utmost For his Highest.” This is an inspirational read and I recommend it to anyone that reads his devotions.\n\nJune 12, 2022\n\nThis is certainly an inspirational life--no comparing, it will make you feel awful:-). The writing is a little hard to stay with at times due to some repetition, I think. I recommend listening.\n\nJuly 11, 2024\n\nI enjoyed reading about Oswald Chambers life story and came away with quotes that I can use.\n\nJanuary 13, 2024\n\n“I will never go into ministry unless God takes me by the scruff of the neck”. Well it appears God did and God used him mightily. A great story of a husband and wife who trusted God a lot and made their lives all about hospitality that others may know the love of Christ. My qualm with this biography is felt more like a hero story than a legitimate take on Chambers, but then again I don’t know if the author’s intention was to write an impartial biography.\n\nAugust 4, 2013\n\nThe author has written a definitive life of Chambers complete with correspondence, poetry, art and photographs. While the very comprehensive nature of the book attracts by its thoroughness, it makes for somewhat choppy reading.\n\nThe story of Chambers shortened life is one of breadth in interest—reading novels of Balzac, plays of Ibsen, stories of George MacDonald, theologies, interest in art, love of children. His life also resonates with a passion for Christ, a simple faith, and a pervasive desire to glorify God and preach the gospel.\n\nWhat gave me pause, was his passionate embrace of the \"holiness movement,\" as taught by John Wesley, his belief in a second blessing and entire sanctification. I find this contrary to the biblical challenge to press on, to grow in grace. However, Chambers views on this subject did not deviate into Pentecostalism or extreme holiness. Instead, he preached mightily against the view held by some who said 'Thank God, I'm sanctified, now it's all right'. (p. 180) He was always very practical in urging passion in prayer, thought, reasoning, biblical study, and practical living. He warned against hysterical phenomena that seize people and arise from spiritual laziness and intellectual sloth. (p. 106). He warned against getting people distracted from a vision of Christ by phenomena such as tongues. (p. 137).\n\nOne thing that struck me forceably was his simple faith. Because of his faith his view of the future was simple; \"Trust God and do the next thing.\" Such a faith would even lead him at times to warp a blanket around himself and go to sleep. (p. 177)\n\nIf one is at all open to the influences of the Holy Spirit, one cannot help but be blessed by this godly man and his thorough and passionate ministry. We would all do well to frequently turn to the biographies of godly servants.\n\nJune 10, 2012\n\nRead this book to see how God really works, as he did in Oswald Chambers' life.\n\nHere are examples of what I mean:\n\n\"Unless the life of a missionary is hid with Christ in God before he begins his work, that life will become exclusive and narrow. It will never become the servant of all men, it will never wash the feet of others.\"\n\nWhat any humand being has done,\" he had heard a preacher say, \"any other human being is capable of.\" Though I have never been able to confirm a source, this sentence made me think of once hearing about Mother Teresa, when asked why she ministered to the poor, responded that when she looked at herself, she saw Hitler there. This made me stop in my tracks. The human heart is capable of untold evils.\n\nA motto to live life by from Chambers' diary:\n\n\"The reading in 1 Samuel 8 struck me impressively, viz. that in any dilemma produced by providential circumstances, the temptation is to yield to ordinary common sense rather than wait for God to fulfill His purpose. God's order comes to us through the haphazard.\"\n\n\"I refuse to worry.\"\n\nWithout anxiety, he welcomed each day and its developments under the sovereign hand of God.\n\nAugust 3, 2009\n\nI knew next to nothing about Oswald Chambers before listening to this reading of his biography. All I knew was that a) he was the author of the excellent book, My Utmost for His Highest, and b) he was a Scottish theologian with a similar approach to other Scottish theologians that I am coming to admire: John MacLeod Campbell, the Torrances, and George MacDonald. So I had no idea about his academic brilliance in theology and philosophy, or about his personal zeal for life and God that infected everyone around him, or about the fact that he volunteered to be an army chaplain of sorts, working with UK troops through the YMCA in Egypt during WWI. This book was a well-written window into the life of a brilliant communicator who loved God. As for the audio recording, Simon Vance again does an excellent job, even switching from a British accent into a Scottish one when reading direct quotes from Chambers. I don't recommend this book for everyone, but if you like Christian biographies and know something of Chambers's work, you might enjoy reading this as I did.\n\nRead\n\nSeptember 21, 2012\n\nI had read My Utmost for His Highest for years as a devotional and often wondered how the man that wrote it came to have such deep spiritual insight. Now I know. This is an amazing book about an amazing man that accomplished amazing things for God in only 47 years. It contains many excerpts from his personal journals that describe his own spiritual journey and ulitmately his conversion. But more than that it describes how he came to be abandoned to God and how that shaped every aspect of his life. One of the most inspiring things about this book is to see his joy even in the\n\nmost desperate circumstances and his love for life despite being virtually penniless and often not even having a home of his own. This is a man that took God at his word and lived out \"whoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it.\"\n\nJuly 8, 2013\n\nGood to read the biography of a man whose words have so long spoken into my life.\n\nOne of the most remarkable parts was learning how his wife had labored so carefully to learn record-speed shorthand as an early teenager. This in turn allowed her to write down Oswald's sermons word for word! After his early death, she spent the rest of her life transcribing his words... which have now catapulted millions of people around the world into closer walks with the Lord. So awesome!\n\nI liked the biography but found it just a bit dry at times. Would recommend to anyone who is a fan of Oswald Chambers, though I still would prefer reading his works over reading about him.\n\nMay 3, 2019\n\nThis biography is wonderful. It forced me not to second guess God like I usually do. You know..\"Why did God allow this?\" type of thing. Everytime my mind began to question, an Oswald Chambers quote would pop up to remind me it's all about God who I owe my obedience to and so much more.\n\n\"All I have to do is come as a spiritual pauper, not ashamed to beg, to let go of my right to myself and act on Romans 12:1-2. It is never Do, do, and you'll be with the Lord, but Be, be and I will do through you. It is a case of hands up and letting go, and then entire reliance on Him.\" Oswald Chambers\n\nI can't wait to read more about this amazing servant and the LORD he loved.\n\nJanuary 29, 2021\n\nThis volume has probably sat on my bookshelf since it was first published (almost 30 years ago now), long before “My Utmost for His Highest” was more to me that just the title of a classic devotional. I can no longer remember how I originally acquired it, though I have a hunch it may have been a gift.\n\nAlmost 10 years ago now, in what to this point is still one of the greatest personal trials I have ever faced, I picked up an updated version of “My Utmost for His Highest” almost on a whim and found in it insights of such uncommon power that it has become a part of my devotional exercises ever since. And, a decade on, its power has yet to fade.\n\nOf course, this is not a review of Chambers’ classic devotional but of McCasland’s biography of its writer which I decided to (finally) read out of a mixture of what can only be described as interest, shame (at having left languishing unread for so long), and resolve (if I found “My Utmost” to be so impactful, it was only sensible to learn a bit more about its author).\n\nFor the purposes of full disclosure, over the years, I have picked up the general outline of Chambers’ life…his time studying art at the University of Edinburgh, the transition to studying for ministry at the Bible Training College, his work with the YMCA attachment to the British Army in Egypt…and, from that perspective, I learned little that surprised me, though McCasland did add a good bit of “color” to the outline I already possessed.\n\nMcCasland does the work of charting Chambers’ life admirably well. He quotes liberally from his letters, journals, sermons, and articles and includes comments and insights from those who knew him. It is quite clear that he sees Oswald Chambers as more than a just a “man of the times,” defined by his era (which seems to be the trend of contemporary biography). He paints Chambers as one who stands out from his context, going against the grain of an increasingly intellectualized and straitened British Christianity with his passionate view of complete surrender and sanctification. McCasland describes well an intensity and authenticity to Oswald Chambers that few I’ve met could match.\n\nI think what McCasland’s work helped me do, more than anything, was to consider again the impact of some things that I already knew. As an example, McCasland rightly picks up on the significance of Chambers’ early aspirations to be a Christian artist (he’s very clear that Chambers considered this a divine calling); it is clear to me now that much of the imagistic power preserved in his writings reflects those same gifts and interests in a different register. Also, his work as a Bible college professor (“tutor” is, I believe, the more correct British academic designation) probably goes a long way toward explaining why his words resonate so with me.\n\nHaving said that, there were (obviously) SOME surprises along the way. For example, Chambers was remarkably well read, not just in literature, but in contemporary theology and psychology (!). In a 1907 article for “God’s Revivalist,” Chambers’ excoriated the lack of proper missionary preparation in incredibly blunt terms: “To ignore the vast and competent literature relative to every country under Heaven today and to go to work for God, living more or less a hand-to-mouth spiritual life is to be utterly unfitted and unable to rightly divide the word of truth. Missionary ignorance…has at its heart laziness or a mistaken notion that the Holy Ghost puts a premium on ignorance.”\n\nChambers’ view of holiness issued in the promotion of a robust Christianity that was unafraid of making real demands of its adherents. The biblical doctrine of holiness he described as “uncompromising and manly.” (Note: I picked up on this phrase because it echoes the “recovery of manhood” language that Jackson Lears’ traces in significant detail in his “Rebirth of a Nation: The Making of Modern America, 1877-1920.”)\n\nFinally, and perhaps most significantly, McCasland demonstrates the crucial role that Chambers’ wife, Gertrude (or “Biddy” as he called her) played in making him the household name he is today. He is unstinting in his praise of her remarkable talents (able to take dictation at the alarming rate of 250 words per minute!), her tireless efforts to collect, organize, and publish his work, and her role as every bit Oswald’s equal in passionate desire for the Kingdom of God. In case you didn’t know it, “My Utmost for His Highest” is, in every meaningful sense of the term, CO-authored by Oswald and Gertrude Chambers, though, in an act of striking humility, her name appears nowhere in that text.\n\nFor those of a more theological turn of mind (like me), McCasland’s work will probably seem a bit light. For all his quotations from Chambers’ writings, there is not much explanation of them. He chooses not to wrestle with Chambers’ understanding of holiness (a hotly contested issue in his day) nor his rejection of the Pentecostal doctrine of Spirit baptism. To be completely honest, it does “flatten” his portrait of Chambers and ends up not giving due credit to Chambers’ writings as works of serious theology, which they undoubtedly were. Chambers clearly had a definite and unique perspective on several fundamental Christian doctrines that deserve more consideration than McCasland chooses to give them.\n\nOne nice touch: McCasland includes Chambers’ poetry as a sort-of appendix to the book. Though most of it is of middling quality, it does provide a unique way to “get at” the essence of the man, Oswald Chambers, who was equal parts sensitive artist, impassioned believer, and resolute soldier. It is a fitting coda to a symphonic life.\n\nOctober 15, 2018\n\nInspiring, and educational about the conditions of the times. I only knew Oswald Chambers as the author of My Utmost for His Highest. It was interesting to see the path of his life that led to his great impact and to learn about his tirelessly supportive wife and ministry partner, Biddy, who compiled so many of his writings after his death.\n\nMarch 12, 2017\n\nThis book was inspiring to me. It is about a man who strove to know God and teach Him to others. He dedicated his life to learning and teaching the word of God our relationship to God should be.\n\nHe\n\nDecember 23, 2018\n\nWhat a great biography of one of my favorite Christian ministers/writers. Best summery of Chambers life: \"He was absolutely free from worry, living what he liked to call a 'recklessly restful life.'\"\n\n\"Trust God and do the next thing.\"\n\nSeptember 22, 2019\n\nRecommended by a friend, this book tells the life story of Oswald Chambers. Much different than I expected. So inspiring! To have a genuine love of God like this man and his wife is a goal we all should have.\n\nFebruary 17, 2020\n\nInspiring life story of the author of the devotional: \"My Utmost for His Highest.\" After reading this book I almost want to travel to Scotland and hike up Ben Nevis, like Mr. Chambers did. But then again, you can talk to the Lord anywhere, mountains and valleys alike.\n\nMay 25, 2015\n\nI don't often read biographies, but this one was well worth the time.\n\nFebruary 1, 2018\n\nWhat a book!!!! I absolutely highly recommend it! It will be inspiration for years to come in my Christian walk.\n\nJune 28, 2018\n\nBiography is a dangerous word to some. How are we to read and write them? I think it best for the writer to have if not admiration, a complete and invested fascination and commitment to deal fairly with the man.\n\nMacCasland puts together an incredible picture of the Oswald Chambers, the beloved preacher and teacher, known to many in the present for his famous devotional book My Utmost for His Highest.(which, like the some 50 books bearing his name, were compiled by his wife Biddy after his death untimely, too-young death in Egypt in 1917).\n\nBy examining the letters and journals Chambers wrote throughout his life, we get an engrossing perspective of a man who lives up to the book's title.\n\nMcCasland notes, in his well researched and engaging prose, that the power of Chambers to communicate came in part from his “insatiable hunger for knowledge.” He illustrates the point through an excerpt he includes from a letter Chambers wrote while on a trip in the United States in 1907: \"My books! I cannot tell you what they are to me–silent, wealthy, loyal lovers. To look at them, to handle them, and to re-read them! I do thank God for my books with every fibre of my being. Friends that are ever true and ever your own. Why, I could have almost cried for excess of joy when I got hold of them again. I see them all just at my elbow now– Plato, Wordsworth, Myers, Bradley, Halyburton, St. Augustine, Browning, Tennyson, Amiel, etc. I know them, I wish you could see how they look at me, a quiet calm look of certain acquaintance.\"\n\nIt’s a glowing view of Chambers, that leaves a room to wonder about his deep struggles (which are alluded to, but ultimately little accessible due to Chambers’ near silence on the subject).\n\nIt's truly an inspiring vision of the beauty of a life surrendered to God.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nOctober 5, 2017\n\nI enjoyed this book because I found it very comforting to read a true life story of Christians who experienced some of the same things we experience in our culture today. Things such as the uncertainty of living through tumultuous world events, and the grief everyone felt at the untimely death of a dear Christian leader. Those were the things that pulled me into this book.\n\nThe book ultimately made me think quite a bit about Oswald Chambers' devotion to living his life for God, and showed me the contrast between my shallow faith and a life a great faith. It was inspiring to see his example.\n\nThe reason I gave three stars was that I felt at times that the plot dragged along with too many facts and details about places they lived and people they met. If the book had included more anecdotes, I think I would have enjoyed it more."
