        "text": "43rd Annual Film Conference Featured Keynote Speaker Andrew Erwin, Director of Hit 'I Can Only Imagine'\n\nContact: Michael Conrad, 214-616-0320, Michael@Lovell-Fairchild.com\n\nFRANKLIN, Tenn., Aug. 2, 2018 /Standard Newswire/ -- International Christian Visual Media, the association for Christian film and television, announces winners of its Gold Crown Awards for excellence in faith films with THE CASE FOR CHRIST taking Best Picture--Gold honors.\n\n\"The growing Christian film genre has topped $2 billion in total ticket sales,\" said ICVM President Jared Geesey. \"It's a privilege for our association to play a part in encouraging, equipping, motivating and recognizing the talented men and women who bring stories of faith to the screen.\"\n\nFocusing on the theme of \"Difference,\" the July 11-14 conference brought top Christian media professionals in communications and the arts to Nashville for four days of networking, training, mutual encouragement and fellowship. The annual conference attracts producers, writers, actors, marketers, social media experts and distributors of Christian and family content for film and television.\n\nThe event is capped each year with the Gold Awards presentation. The awards drew nearly 70 entries in a wide variety of film, video and television formats.\n\nAndy Erwin, the director of I CAN ONLY IMAGINE, which has grossed over $83 million to date, gave the event's keynote address. He encouraged creators by sharing what he and his brother and co-director, Jon, learned in facing truly daunting circumstances while filming.\n\n\"Embrace every closed door,\" Erwin said, \"so God can direct you to the right open one.\"\n\nTHE CASE FOR CHRIST, won Best Picture. A PureFlix release that grossed almost $15 million, the film tells the story of famed Chicago journalist Lee Strobel, who put his investigative skills to work to disprove Christianity only to become convinced of its truth. It is based on his best-selling book of the same name that has sold over 5 million copies.\n\nSTORM & LUTHER'S FORBIDDEN LETTERS from Vision Video earned the Best Picture--Silver Award, and TORTURED FOR CHRIST was named Best Picture--Bronze.\n\nFor a complete list of Gold Crown Award winners: https://www.icvm.com/2018-crown-winners.\n\nThe Best New Filmmaker Award went to an up-and-coming brother trio the Kooman brothers with Unveil Studios and includes a $1,000 cash award from the Christian Film Foundation, founded by the Kendrick Brothers.\n\nIn addition to Erwin, speakers at the event included award-winning actress Karen Abercrombie, star of the Kendrick Brothers film WAR ROOM; noted casting director Beverly Holloway; Fathom Events Director of Programming Katie Sawyer-Stachler, writer Catherine Clinch, and many others.\n\nFor interviews, contact: Michael Conrad, Michael@Lovell-Fairchild.com, 214-616-0320\n\nABOUT ICVM\n\nICVM is a 501(c)6 professional association for Christians involved in the production, distribution, and marketing of movies, documentaries, television programs and short films.
