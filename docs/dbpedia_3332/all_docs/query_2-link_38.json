Personal Statement.\n\nMy lab is dedicated to understanding molecular mechanisms of human epithelial cancer invasion and metastasis. Specifically, we study the regulation of cell surface molecules (called integrins) and their biosensing role in cancer cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Among our many contributions, my research team discovered that laminin adhesion structures are dramatically altered early in human cancer progression resulting in invasion, metastasis, and drug or radiation resistance. We have contributed peer-reviewed publications in this area and developed three approaches to interrupt cell adhesion to laminin: (1) using cyclized peptides, (2) deploying small molecules, and/or (3) using a function-blocking antibody. Currently we are using gene editing technology and 3D video microscopy to design cell based therapeutics to block tumor specific invasion and metastasis.\n\nB.

Contribution to Science\n\n1. Discovery of cell adhesion mediated drug resistance. Our group discovered Cell Adhesion Mediated Drug Resistance (CAM-DR), which we have shown to be a significant impediment to tumor eradication. Normal and tumor cells respond to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapeutic agents. Epithelial cells are resistant to lethal effects of DNA damaging agents dependent upon cytokeratin. Adhesion to laminin 5, the ligand for ITGA6, promotes a G2 progression block in normal cells in response to IR. Without laminin 5 adhesion, the DNA damage-induced block was significantly reduced. The working hypothesis is that laminin 5 adhesion, and the structural integrin-cytokeratin connections to the nucleus, promote a robust DNA damage response. We speculate that defective laminin adhesion in early cancer progression has an unintended consequence of promoting genomic instability via attenuation of the DNA damage response.\n\na.

Switching adhesion complexes is an early event in epithelial cancer progression. The regulator of normal skin and glandular tissue homeostasis is the A6B4 integrin. It is a laminin receptor that acts as a seed site for the formation of hemidesomsome (HD) structures. In the skin and corneal epithelium, human blistering diseases result from germline mutations in either the receptor or the ligand. We discovered that HDs and focal adhesions (FAs) are present in normal prostate glands. Further, we found that the HD structure is attenuated in intraepithelial neoplasia and, in invasive and metastatic human prostate cancer, is switched to A6B1 integrin. Loss of the HD structure is correlated with later stage and higher grade of the disease. Preventing the switching of the adhesion structure is an actionable step in preventing the metastatic spread of this slow growing type cancer.\n\na.

We discovered structural variant forms of ITGA6 and ITGB4 that occur specific to cancer progression. A novel post-translational modification (PTM) of ITGA6 generated a novel form of ITGA6, called ITGA6p, produced on the cancer cell surface by the protease urokinase. Infiltrating macrophages into the tumor promote the production of ITGA6p. The urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR, PLAUR) is required for the cleavage of ITGA6 by uPA. The working hypothesis is that ITGA6p dominates in cohesive migration and establishes cancer residency in metastatic sites such as the bone.\n\na.

Our goal is to understand human prostate tumor cell adhesion and migration, and use this information to block subsequent aggressive spreadto late stage secondary skeletal sites. Early (and often clinically non-apparent) bone metastasis can provide a sanctuary site for tumor cells and result in widespread skeletal recurrence and pain resulting from aggressive metastatic disease 5 to 10 years after primary therapy. We discovered a new therapeutic strategy and concept of cancer control directed at blocking the success of early adhesion dependent tumors and in particular, painful bone-resident cancer.\n\na.

Training and mentoring approximately 49 students at all levels for professional careers in the medical and biological sciences and biotechnology. Curiosity coupled with quantitative skills is a rare combination in students that I have had the honor to nurture. I am proud that the majority of past students are now either current or past Cancer Center Directors, Professors at major U.S. Universities, leaders in biotechnology, or full partners in prestigious patent law firms. All of these students were very intelligent, highly motivated, and perhaps most important, persistent in their pursuit of excellence. I view my contribution to their career path as a valuable addition to science that could not have been accomplished without my own scientific curiosity and pursuit of peer-reviewed biomedical research.\n\nPatents\n\n1. #6,812,003: Compounds and Methods for Modulating Cell-Adhesion Mediated Drug Resistance.\n\nPeptides and methods of their use for inhibiting drug and radiation therapy resistance in cancerous cells in which the efficacy of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy is enhanced by administration of an effective about of a peptide that inhibits cell adhesion mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR).

Recent genetic studies now show that specific microRNAs are aberrant in families with a congenital abnormality in this same adhesion structure. The hypothesis to be tested is that these specific microRNAs are responsible for the dysregulation found in prostate cancer.\n\nRole: PI\n\n2R01CA159406 (PI: Cress) 07/01/2016 - 06/30/2021 1.2 CM\n\nNIH $250,000/yr DC\n\nHuman Prostate Cancer Metastasis and Laminin Binding Integrins\n\nThe goal of this renewal is to understand human prostate tumor cell adhesion, migration and use this information to block subsequent bone pain and spread to late stage secondary skeletal sites. The unique and innovative feature is pursuing the discovery of cohesive cell migration of micro metastases mediated by laminin binding integrins (LBI) and intercellular adhesion. Confocal live 3D imaging, translational pathology and state of the art mass spectrometry approaches will be used. The results will uncover new targetable elements of the LBI axis in prostate cancer progression.\n\nRole: PI\n\nOVERLAP\n\nNONE"
