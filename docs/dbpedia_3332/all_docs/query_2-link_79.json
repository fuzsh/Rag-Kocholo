        "text": "By John Lyle Belden\n\n(Note: Out of respect for the art form and its performers, they are identified by their Drag names as given in the show program.)\n\nSurviving high school is such a drag, right?!\n\nSo, it stands to reason that Indy Drag Theatre would take on the hottest Prom ever shown on stage or screen in “Carrie: A Drag Parody Musical.” The drag-world embrace of outsiders and making what could be considered trashy fabulous while leaning into its campiness help make this show the perfect medium for genderfluid expression.\n\nAs director Ciara Myst pointed out on opening night, the original Stephen King novel boldly took on topics such as abuse and bullying. In addition, the musical itself had a rocky path from being one of Broadway’s biggest flops in 1988 to a cult classic with a notable revival (after some necessary rewrites by creators Lawrence D. Cohen, Dean Pitchford and Michael Gore) in 2012. The Indy Drag Theatre performs flawless lip-synch to audio from both a stage musical performance and the hit 1976 Brian de Palma film. Dottie B. Minerva is assistant director; costumes are by Kalinda, with makeup by Ms. Myst, and wigs from Hair By Blair. Choreography is by April Rosè.\n\nOur fabulous cast ironically plays it straight in reproducing the stage experience, imbuing the scenes with appropriate drama and suspense. St. Pussifer shines as misunderstood, mistreated Carrie White, with Vera Vanderwoude St. Clair chillingly playing her strict and insanely devout mother Margaret. AJ Thoma is solid as good-natured Sue Snell, while Eli Rose is the noble Tommy Ross. Brentlee Bich is furiously bitchy as vengeance-minded Chris (the girl behind the infamous blood-bucket prank). Skarlett Rose also does well as tragic gym teacher Miss Gardner.\n\nOther performers include Cadence, Axel Rosie, Ce Ce Santos, Abigail Brown, Desiree Bouvier, Jose Dos Santos, William Moser, Jack Offerman, and Elle Rulon.\n\nIf you are a fan of drag, the original book or film, or high-heeled spectacles like “Rocky Horror,” you simply must see this edition of “Carrie” – when it finally makes its way back to Indy’s District Theater. Due to its proximity to the Fringe festival, there was only one scheduled weekend of performances. When an unspecified emergency forced a cancellation on Sunday, it was announced that Indy Drag Theatre would try to bring the show back at a later date.\n\nIn the meantime, make plans for their next scheduled show, “Shrek,” Nov. 15-24. Get details at indydragtheatre.com.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nFootlite Musicals provides a taste of the tropics with its young artists production of “Once on This Island,” the Broadway hit by Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty, based on Rosa Guy’s “My Love, My Love,” a Caribbean retelling of Hans Christian Anderson’s “The Little Mermaid.” It copies the original mostly in theme and a few plot elements, standing as its own as a story of love, sacrifice and the forces that work around – and often against – us.\n\nSometimes it takes a village to tell a story. Aside from the named characters, we meet a chorus of 21 Storytellers who introduce the tale and carry it along. They relate that on this island, a small French possession in the Antilles, they honor the local Afro-Caribbean gods including Asaka (Imani Ruffin), Mother of the Earth; Agwe (Kori Smith), lord of Water; Erzulie (Caileigh Jones), goddess of Love; and Papa Ge (Noah Lee), spirit of Death.\n\nThe story centers on Ti Moune (Lauren Blackwood), an orphan found in a tree after a storm. Sensing the gods saved her for a reason, an old couple – Mama Euralie (Plezzance Lawrence) and Tonton Julian (Jalen Breiley) – take her in and raise her. Events transpire that Ti Moune encounters and saves Daniel (Colton Woods), son of the nobleman Armand (Edward Rayhill) whose family has governed the island for generations. She even makes her way to Daniel’s side of the island, where he lives in a luxury hotel. But she is not the only woman in his life; enter his lifelong friend Andrea (Rebecca Pinero). Ti Moune finds herself tested by both the trickery of Papa Ge and the discrimination of high society. What is her destiny?\n\nDirected by Dennis Jones and Edward Trout, and excellently choreographed by Kevin Bell, with the island beat of an ensemble led by Gisele Dollinger, this Caribbean fairy tale flows beautifully as all the cast contribute, with Blackwood’s voice sailing through sun and storm. The gods get their due, with Ruffin shining in the song “Mama Will Provide,” and Lee embracing his role as trickster as well as Reaper.\n\nThis story with its ring of familiarity set in an exotic locale reminds us that love is noble and real in all cultures. The energy of its telling sweeps us along and makes us root for the girl in the tree.\n\nPerformances of “Once on This Island” run through Sunday, Aug. 18, at Hedback Theater, 1847 N. Alabama, Indianapolis. Get info and tickets at footlite.org.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nThe Summer Stock Stage Eclipse program (professional, with collegiate performers) presents “Lizzie,” the new musical by Alan Stevens Hewitt and Steven Cheslik-deMeyer, book by Tim Maner, based on the Lizzie Borden legend, presented internationally since its introduction in 2010.\n\nTo clarify “musical,” this show is a Riot Grrl-style Punk Rock Opera – modify expectations accordingly and hold on for the ride.* To ask why it’s in this mode is to miss the cultural mystique of Miss Borden. She was already an outsider – unmarried at 30, still living with her controlling father and detested stepmother – when the gruesome events of August 1892 occurred in Fall River, Mass.\n\n“Lizzie Borden took an ax, gave her mother forty whacks; when she saw what she had done, gave her father forty-one!”\n\nBeing rich from their penny-pinching parents, Lizzie and sister Emma hired the best possible representation, and with an all-male jury actually working in their favor, got her acquitted at trial. However, historians and even her fandom are fairly certain she did the deed. Still, this is not just a play about getting away with murder.\n\nThe story is presented nearly all in song by four women: Lizzie (Erin Lambertson), older sister Emma Borden (Cora Kendall), neighbor and close friend Alice Russell (Mai Caslowitz), and the Bordens’ maid Bridget “Maggie” Sullivan (Samantha Ringor). Backing them – literally, seen through the slats of the set by Abigail Wagner that suggests both a simple home and cozy barn – are the band of Ginger Stoltz (keyboard and conductor), Ainsley Paton Stoltz (bass), Kirstin Cutler (drums), Joy Caroline Mills (guitar), Sally McSpadden (guitar and keyboard), and Taylor White (cello and percussion). Direction is by local actor and teaching artist Devan Mathias with musical direction by Ben Rose (who coincidentally has worked at the actual Lizzie Borden House, now a B&B).\n\nAct 1 brings into focus the conditions the Borden sisters were likely living in, and potential motives for what is to come. The tensions weigh on Lizzie and Emma, while a longing grows in Alice; meanwhile, with a dollar from the girls in hand, Maggie is quick to go downtown for the afternoon so she can say she didn’t see a thing someone might be doing.\n\nIn Act 2, there is quite a mess – one song is titled, “What the F*** Now, Lizzie?!” – and loosely period costumes give way for something more turn of the Millenium (all designed by Allison Jones) as events take a more modern procedural, crime-of-the-century feel. The number in which Lizzie and Emma make their Kardashian-esque public plea is priceless.\n\nThroughout it all, these ladies rock their hearts out. There are also touching, tender moments, including a song between Lizzie and Alice that recurs in each act, giving two meanings to “Will you lie?” Overall, a bravura performance.\n\nThis show brings more of a different perspective to the Borden case and legend than giving any new facts. Events portrayed in any medium are always conjecture and subject to artistic license. Perhaps a good friend “coming to call” could mean more in 1890s New England. Still, the major points follow the story as told elsewhere. This version is very feminist-focused, so one can forgive the downplaying of other problematic aspects such as suspicions cast on local immigrants. On this stage, it’s the grrls’ turn to tell the story – the closest you get to a male presence is Daddy’s body under a sheet.\n\nFour performances remain for “Lizzie,” Thursday through Sunday, Aug. 8-11, at the Phoenix Theatre Cultural Centre, 705 N. Illinois St., Indianapolis. See phoenixtheatre.org for tickets or get info at summerstockstage.com.\n\n_ _ _\n\n(*“Lizzie” could be compared stylistically to the musical “Six,” but the latter was developed in the U.K. more recently.)\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nOne hundred thirty-one years ago, Chicago hosted the World’s Fair. Practically everyone who was anyone at the time was there. Also, a notorious and prolific serial killer, who had his victims coming to him, which he dispatched not only for the thrill but also for cold hard cash.\n\nYou might already know about this, especially if you have read Erik Larson’s “The Devil in the White City.” Before that non-fiction bestseller was in print, Ben Asaykwee, then living and performing in Chicago, started work on a musical inspired by the brazen exploits of swindler and murderer H.H. Holmes.\n\nEight years ago, Asaykwee and collaborator Claire Wilcher premiered “White City Murder” in Indy’s Irvington neighborhood (just blocks where Holmes had briefly resided, killing one of his last victims). Last weekend, the duo opened the latest edition of this fascinating historical extravaganza in the black-box Basile stage at the Phoenix Theatre Cultural Centre.\n\nFor such an audacious event as the shining white Fair, with the unbelievably dark deeds occurring just miles away, Asaykwee and Wilcher go big with carnival barker energy befitting a Buffalo Bill show (Bill also makes an appearance – in fact our actors portray dozens of people from simple to celebrity). Once they have grabbed our attention, they keep us fascinated and entertained by the story of tragic fates and horrible deeds, aided by a hidden keyboard and a vocal looper to reflect the inventive atmosphere of the late nineteenth century.\n\nA large paper notepad registers the body count, climbing ever higher. It is unknown how many Holmes killed – he was convicted of just one murder and had been pursued only for insurance fraud – but this is not to celebrate that. Asaykwee gives us a snapshot of a wild time in a dynamic era, presenting those whose lives were touched and ruined as much as the man who doomed them. And for us – twenty-first century consumers of true-crime entertainment in its various forms – he gives us a show that truly kills, complete with catchy tunes and wry gallows humor.\n\nBack when I first saw this, I noted its rough edges (now nicely polished) and wondered if this performance was only suited to Asaykwee and Wilcher’s unique style and talents. I now sense others willing to engage the gusto this show demands could do it just fine, but still, make a date to see the originators.\n\n“White City Murder” runs through Aug. 4 at 705 N. Illinois St. in downtown Indianapolis. Info and tickets at phoenixtheatre.org.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nLest there be any confusion, the current production of “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” is in Greenfield.\n\nIn an odd coincidence, there is a Putnam County in Indiana (west of Indy) but the title was intended as an all-American sounding location while the musical was developed by William Finn and Rachel Sheinkin in New York and Massachusetts prior to its 2005 Off-Broadway, then Tony-winning Broadway, run. So, please head just east of Indianapolis, into Hancock County, to see this CrazyLake Acting Company production, directed by Amy Studabaker and Christine Schaefer.\n\nStudabaker is also music director, choreographer with Kaydence Forsyth, and stars as Marcy, one of the middle-school contestants at the Bee, a qualifier for the national contest in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe cast is famously an interesting assembly of adolescent eccentrics: Marcy is a high-achiever who speaks not five, but six languages; defending champ Chip (Luke Agee) is a noble Boy Scout; Leaf Coneybear (Corey Yeaman) is an imaginative but unsteady lad who spells words in trance-like outbursts; shy Olive (Taylor Shelton), who reads the dictionary like a favorite novel, speaks the word into her hand; politically-active Logainne (Alex Gawrys-Strand) traces the word on her arm; while William Barfeè (Matt Little) famously uses his “magic” foot. There are also adults of varying maturity: Mitch (Ethan Stearns), performing as “comfort counselor” as part of his court-ordered community service; Vice Principal Panch (Trever Brown), who promises he will behave much better this time; and our host Rona Lisa Peretti (Noelle Russell), the county’s leading realtor and past winner at the 3rd Annual Bee.\n\nZane Roberts, Alex Ross, Petra Russell, Ross McMichael, Jeff Pipkin, and Ashley Pipkin play various parents and siblings, as well as a vision of Jesus. Stage Manager Blair Connelly can be seen occasionally as the gym’s custodian.\n\nIn addition, as has been customary with this improv-inspired show from its beginning, there are three contestants drawn from the audience.\n\nIt’s interesting to see the adult actors embrace their inner children to capture the whimsy and apprehension of the “tween” transition from child to teenager. Yeaman keeps Leaf’s silliness grounded in his discovery of true potential. Studabaker and Gawrys-Strand each portray their girls feeling the pressure of high expectations, sensing they are growing up too soon. Agee plays the alpha discovering to his dismay that some things just can’t be controlled. Shelton fits the most endearing part, Olive (which she notes, anagrams to “I love”), nicely. Little’s “Bar-fay” manages to balance his know-it-all nature with enough odd charm and shielded humility to keep him likable, even one to root for.\n\nLoaded with L-A-U-G-H-S, this Bee is buzz-worthy. The musical opens Friday, July 12, running through July 21, at H.J. Ricks Centre for the Arts, 122 W. Main St. (U.S. 40) in downtown Greenfield. Discount tickets are available at Hometown Comics and Games. For information and tickets online go to crazylakeacting.com.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nIt’s an often-told story: A stranger comes into a sleepy town and everything changes. However, in this case, that’s the stranger’s plan the whole time.\n\nSummer Stock Stage presents a full production of Meredith Willson’s “The Music Man,” directed by founding artistic director Emily Ristine Holloway. And I do mean “full” – the whole musical on the full-size Ayers Auditorium stage (at Park Tudor School) with orchestra in the back, led by Mike Berg Raunick, and a cast that Holloway tongue-in-cheek calls “seventy-six actors” (a rough count in the program is close to that number). They represent 30 different Indiana schools, she said, mainly teenagers with younger children in age-appropriate roles.\n\nThis company gives an exceptional performance throughout, from the overture to the curtain call.\n\nIn 1912, “Professor” Harold Hill (Justus Palumbo) arrives in River City, Iowa, a practiced con man posing as a traveling salesman of band instruments and uniforms. The grift involves convincing a town it needs a youth band, selling them everything they need with the promise he’ll organize and teach, but skipping town with the money before giving a single actual lesson.\n\nIowans aren’t that easy to fool, especially town librarian Marian Paroo (Jilayne Kistner), but Hill accepts the challenge, demonizing the new pool tables downtown and getting everyone singing and dancing as they await the arrival of their instruments. Both Marian and Mayor Shinn (Andrew King) suspect something dishonest is happening, but are swept up in the events of that magical summer. Marion’s shy, lisping little brother Winthrop Paroo (Tad Klovsky) is coming out of his shell; meanwhile, local delinquent Tommy Djilas (Justice Harris) is doing honest work, albeit as Hill’s unwitting accomplice.\n\nBut even master manipulator Hill isn’t immune to changing attitudes – or love.\n\nThe cast also features Gracie Reckamp as Amaryllis, the girl with a crush on Winthrop; Taylor Smith as Marcellus Washburn, an old friend of Hill’s now in on the scam; Paige Murray as the Mayor’s wife Eulalie, who wishes to be seen as cultured so is easily talked into leading a women’s dance committee; Gabi Bradley as Zaneeta Shin, the Mayor’s daughter who is seeing Tommy; Elizabeth Hutson as Marion and Winthrop’s mother, who takes a shine to Hill from the beginning; Caleb Trinoskey as Charlie Cowell, a crude traveling salesman out to expose Hill; and Martini Otaletan, Jackson Bullock, Thomas Bowling, and Colin Alber as city School Board members who find themselves formed into a pitch-perfect barbershop quartet.\n\nPalumbo and Kistner, both college-bound high school graduates, give professional-level performances as Harold and Marion. He gives Hill suave charisma and endless charm; while she presents as nobody’s fool, while understanding that this “band” may be the best thing to ever happen to this town.\n\nKing amuses with his bossy bluster as Mayor Shinn. Murray easily steals scenes as his wife. Hutson’s Mrs. Paroo is a steady presence, an old Irish soul whose only desire is for love to prevail. Klovsky, naturally, charms as Winthrop.\n\nWhile the songs and story are what makes this musical famous, this production features some incredible dancing, choreographed by Phillip Crawshaw. The big numbers fill the stage with precision and dazzling moves; moments when Tommy and Zaneeta pair up really pop; and the movement and clever use of the books during “Marian the Librarian” are simply stunning.\n\nFor anyone who likes “The Music Man,” or is open to it, this brilliant production is a must. Performances are 7 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 2 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, June 28-30. The Saturday Matinee is a “sensory-friendly” performance for patrons who would be more comfortable with that. Park Tudor is at 7200 N. College Ave., Indianapolis, follow the signs to Ayers Auditorium.

The local production, Footlite’s summer show featuring college-age performers, is directed and choreographed by Kevin Bell.\n\nWith World War II just ended and the City of Lights finally recovering, we meet Adam (Seth Jacobsen), an American still limping from his war wounds. He makes his living playing piano and writing music while helping local friend Henri (Louis Soria) become a nightclub singer, unbeknownst to his industrialist parents. Meanwhile fellow American soldier Jerry (Alexander Holloway) purposely misses his train out of Paris so he can stay and work on his art.\n\nFrom the beginning there is a mysterious girl (Jaelynn Keating) who we find out is Lise, a second-generation ballerina who, at the request of American heiress Milo Davenport (Remi Shirayanagi), is to star in a new ballet written by Adam, who feels a deeper connection. For Jerry it was love at first sight, as he insists on having more time with Lise to finish his sketch of her. But what neither man knows is that she is a long-time friend of Henri, who is working up the courage to propose to her.\n\nThe cast also includes Audrey Beaverson, Ella Bassler, Tajeyon Bohannon, K. Dottery, Emma Gedig, Josh Hoover, Tatum Meadors, Danny Roberds, Katie Van Den Heuvel, and Thomas Zotz as The Maestro of the ballet company.\n\nThis production is unusual in being a sort of hybrid of a traditional stage musical and ballet, with graceful dancing in most scenes. This works in part because of the triple-threat talents of Holloway and Keating. Their singing is exceptional in numbers like “I’ve Got Beginner’s Luck” and “The Man I Love” and their dancing is exquisite, especially together in the climactic title ballet. Jacobsen is also strong in stage presence and singing voice, as well as showing he’s quite a dancer in a fantasy scene.\n\nA celebration of love and Gershwin, “An American in Paris” has performances Thursday through Sunday, June 27-30, at Footlite’s Hedback Theater, 1847 N. Alabama St., Indianapolis. Get tickets at footlite.org.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nThe show “Into the Woods” could be considered the quintessential Stephen Sondheim musical (with book by James Lapine). Even in a world of fantasy and magic there is a sense of realism, real stakes and real consequences. It is also one of his works you are likely familiar with, thanks to numerous community and professional theatre stagings, as well as a popular movie (and, of course, its runs on Broadway).\n\nTherefore, when Buck Creek Players took it on this year, under the direction of Ben Jones and music director Jill Stewart, they decided to make the production stand out while still true to its story and audience expectations. The result is an “Into the Woods” that is outstanding by practically every measure.\n\nThe experience starts the moment you enter the theater and see the stage. Aside from a large lone tree at the back of the stage –­ its hollow necessary to a number of scenes – setpieces are adorned with raised branches to suggest the ever-looming Woods where our stories are set. Those rotating pieces themselves look like giant open books, the covers walls of old bookshelves. Other props look like stacks of books (classic and popular titles on the spines) and scattered like random leaves on the floor are pages with burnt edges – we were told Jones had them be copies of pages from commonly banned books. Set design and construction are credited to Matt Gray.\n\nRoles are well-cast. Ellen Vander Missen, notable for leading ladies at Footlite Musicals, makes her BCP debut as Cinderella. Central characters the Baker and his Wife are wonderfully played by Ball State graduate Mason Mast and local favorite Miranda Nehrig. The quirky wit of Thom Turner fits perfectly as the Narrator and Mysterious Man. Cordale Hankins embodies the youthful impulsiveness of Jack (of “Beanstalk” fame) while Georgeanna Teipen returns to BCP as his Mother. Shelia Raghavendran appears to be having fun as brave, energetic Little Red Riding Hood. Emily Gaddy commands her scenes as the Witch.\n\nOthers include Claire Slaven as Cinderella’s Stepmother and Jeremy Teipen as her father, with Claire Gray and Jenna MacNulty as the stepsisters; Addison Koehler as Rapunzel; Josh Rooks a striking presence as the Wolf and the Prince’s Steward; Charming Princes played by Liam Boyle (for Cinderella) and Zach Bucher (for Rapunzel); Amelia Tryon as the spirit of Cinderella’s mother as well as the once-eaten Red Riding Hood’s Granny; and Anna Spack as diverse characters including some very expressive flocks of birds.\n\nIn a notable addition to the cast, Dominc Kattau brings the cow Milky-White to life, saying a lot with just a “Moo” and making scenes with his double-takes and antics.\n\nThe show also features a 16-member backstage orchestra, conducted by Jill Stewart.\n\nFor the unfamiliar, Act I has a number of popular fairy tales occurring simultaneously in and around the titular forest; Act II is what happens after the story says “happily ever after.” The songs serve the plot and work in Sondheim’s often complex style. The refrain of “Into the Woods” from the “Opening” sticks with you, and the Princes’ lament “Agony” is a favorite. The show’s “hit” songs come near the end – “You Are Not Alone” and “Children Will Listen.” No matter what your experience is with this musical, though, you are sure to be delighted.\n\nMore likely, however, you could be disappointed at missing out. As I finish this, Friday and Sunday’s performances are sold out, leaving two shows this Saturday (June 22), 2:30 and 7:30 p.m., at the Buck Creek Playhouse, 11150 Southeastern Ave., Indianapolis (Acton Road exit off I-74). Call 317-862-2270 or visit buckcreekplayers.com for tickets.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nThe opening song for “The Break,” a new rock musical presented by Constellation Stage and Screen of Bloomington, declares “this is not a love story.” But while it’s not a typical rom-com plot, this is a humorous story about love, tested in rather extreme fashion.\n\nSamantha (Alex Keiper) and Charlie (Louis Pardo) have known each other since they started college. They have only dated – and had sex with – each other, and for years have lived together. They were perfectly fine with this.\n\nOne day, they realize that perhaps they should take the natural next step: marriage. It also dawns on them that neither has personal experience to truly know that each is the best partner for the other – no basis of comparison. They decide to take a “break” of 30 days for a “sexual walkabout,” separately sampling one-night stands with strangers to get the lay of the land (so to speak) before reuniting to finally commit to each other. There are a few ground rules, including shared custody of Rodrigo the iguana, but otherwise they are free to explore.\n\nThis musical, by Michael Kooman and Christopher Dimond, indulges in mature topics and language, but keeps things light with no graphic simulated intercourse. The scenes more reflect their experiences and feelings before and after the sex. There are plenty of questionable potential hookups, but some go quite well – one song declares “That felt f***ing good!”\n\nUnder the direction of Scott Weinstein, Keiper and Pardo turn in excellent performances. As Sam and Charlie, they convincingly show ease with each other, a depth of feeling that includes mutual empathy and genuine hurt when the rules are bent. Being the only actors on stage, each smoothly morphs into the various men and women our explorers encounter. Keiper is even the voice of Rodrigo, who also gets a song.\n\nOverall, the show is a funny, entertaining reflection of our swipe-right/left dating landscape and the apprehension we all experience when the ring and ceremony make “til death do us part” feel too real.\n\nSpeaking of which, the last scene does involve a wedding (which is even hinted at in the beginning). How these two come to know that next step is the right one, though, is a heartfelt journey worth joining them on. Performances run through June 23 at Waldron Auditorium, 122 S. Walnut St. in downtown Bloomington. Get info and tickets at seeconstellation.org.\n\nBy John Lyle Belden\n\nBeing a Generation X’er, I get mixed feelings about 1980s nostalgia, but some things catch the kitschy spirit of the decade just right, like the Tony-nominated musical, “The Wedding Singer,” based on the 1998 Adam Sandler film.\n\nPresented by the 21st-century actors of Eclipse, the professional-level program of Summer Stock Stage, “Wedding Singer” is on the main stage of the Phoenix Theatre Cultural Centre through June 16, directed by Kate Galvin.\n\nIn 1985 New Jersey, singer-songwriter Robbie Hart (Alex Pharo) is having modest success leading an in-demand wedding band, Simply Wed, with best friends Sammy (Micah Phillips) on bass and George (Matthew David Conwell) on keytar. Robbie is also looking forward to his own wedding, to Linda (Kha’Lea Wainwright), but things don’t go to plan. Meanwhile, Julia Sullivan (Leela Rothenberg), who with her cousin Holly (Dori Salumurovic) are waitresses at the wedding venue, is getting engaged to rich Wall Street boyfriend Glen Guglia (Jack Ducat). Julia has Robbie promise to sing at her wedding – which he eventually will, but not in the way anyone expected.\n\nThe plot hits all the expected beats of a typical rom-com, from the meet-cute all the way through to the “go out and get her!” What’s important is how the story goes from here to there, and all the charming, mildly dramatic, and laugh-out-loud moments along the way.\n\nPharo takes on this journey well, making Robbie a hero to root for, funny and charming without any of Sandler’s mannerisms so the character stands on its own. Rothenberg makes Julia both noble and sweet, the kind of woman worth going great lengths for. She and Salumurovic have a natural chemistry as well, like they grew up as almost-sisters. Phillips, looking like a mad scientist combined Hall and Oates, and Conwell, a sort of Boy George homage, also make memorable likable characters. Wainwright and Ducat give their roles each a flavor of vanity that befits the era – Glen’s especially, as a “greed is good” trader overflowing with hubris.\n\nLocal stage veteran Devan Mathias steals scenes in roles including Robbie’s grandmother Rosie and Julia’s mother Angie. The supporting ensemble get a lot of time on stage – weddings, a bar mitzvah, at the mall, etc. – so get a lot of moments as well, featuring Isabella Agresta, Kayla Mariah Fifer, Fletcher Hooten, Byron Ledford, Hillary McGuire, and Maddux Morrison (who rocks Fake Billy Idol).\n\nThe musical, with book by Chad Beguelin and Tim Herlihy (from Herlihy’s screenplay), music by Matthew Sklar and lyrics by Beguelin, avoids the endless headaches of song rights by providing originals with the familiar feel of ‘80s hits, from the catchy “It’s Your Wedding Day” to the charm of “Come Out of the Dumpster.”\n\nGalvin is aided by music director Jerico Hughes, choreographer Phillip Crawshaw and stage manager Rebecca Roeber. Embarrassingly accurate fashion and look by Wendy Meaden (costumes) and Andrew Elliot (wigs, hair, and makeup).\n\nHighly entertaining with a story of love lost and found “Right in Front of Your Eyes,” find “The Wedding Singer” tickets at phoenixtheatre.org."
