        "text": "George Joins the Neighborhood Wha-tcha and Raises the Vigilante\n\nWhen a sexual predator moves nearby, George and Angie use their membership in the neighborhood watch to take action in different ways. Angie advocates sending a certified letter to the offender and hanging posters around town, but George leads a vigilante crew to the address to threaten the perpetrator. What they find there surprises everyone. Meanwhile, George and Angie realize that it's time to talk to Max about sex.\n\nThe One Where They Get High\n\nMaw Maw has found a new love, Hubert, who encourages her to engage in some reckless activity. When Virginia finds herself scolding Maw Maw, she fears sheâs become a lame adult and wants Burt to do more risk-taking activities with her. Jimmy and Sabrina follow suit when they find themselves spying on their own babysitter.\n\nLopez vs. Let It Go\n\nGeorge joins a meditation group led by Carlos the Curandero, a spiritual healer whose mantra is \"let it go.\" However, Mayan worries her dad is letting go of too much, including their living room furniture. A burnout threatens to move next door."
