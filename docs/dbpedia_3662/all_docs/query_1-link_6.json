        "text": "Fields Of GoldSting\n\nSting wrote \"Fields of Gold\" after buying a house near a barley field and enjoying the majestic sunsets.\n\nIn-A-Gadda-Da-VidaIron Butterfly\n\n\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" was supposed to be titled \"In The Garden Of Eden,\" but someone in the studio wrote down the title phonetically, and it stuck.\n\nPsycho KillerTalking Heads\n\nThe French part in Talking Heads' \"Psycho Killer\" explains that the killer is going after a girl, like Norman Bates in the movie Psycho.\n\nYellow LedbetterPearl Jam\n\nEddie Vedder often changes the words when he sings \"Yellow Ledbetter.\" The basic story is about a guy whose brother dies in the first Gulf War. Apparently, bad news in the army is delivered in yellow envelopes.\n\nThe Kids Aren't AlrightFall Out Boy\n\nFall Out Boy's \"The Kids Aren't Alright\" song title is not a reference to The Offspring's 1998 single of the same name. It actually alludes to The Who's 1979 rockumentary film called The Kids Are Alright.\n\nA Bar Song (Tipsy)Shaboozey\n\nShaboozey's \"A Bar Song (Tipsy)\" is a country reworking of J-Kwon's hip-hop hit \"Tipsy,\" with the setting changed from a club to a dive bar.\n\nPaul WilliamsSongwriter Interviews\n\nHe's a singer and an actor, but as a songwriter Paul helped make Kermit a cultured frog, turned a bank commercial into a huge hit and made love both \"exciting and new\" and \"soft as an easy chair.\"\n\nSongs in Famous Movie Scenes: '80s EditionMusic Quiz\n\nYou know the scenes - Tom Cruise in his own pants-off dance off, Molly Ringwald celebrating her birthday - but do you remember what song is playing?\n\nSoul Train Stories with Stephen McMillianSong Writing\n\nA Soul Train dancer takes us through a day on the show, and explains what you had to do to get camera time."
