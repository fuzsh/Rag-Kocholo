        "text": "Legends have their moments. For the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards, Cheech & Chong were on hand to honor the Red Hot Chili Peppers as MTV Global Icons.\n\nWhy Cheech & Chong? The band are fans of the stoner comedy duo, as is Lenny Kravitiz. The connection is also geographic: The Chili Peppers are from Los Angeles as is Cheech Marin. Tommy Chong, who's from Calgary, has lived in the L.A. area since the early '70s.\n\nChong tells CelebStoner: \"We're very close friends. They requested us over Johnny Depp! They attended Fairfax High School with my daughters Robbi and Rae Dawn.\"\n\nIn his acceptance speech after the band performed \"Bad Summer,\" lead singer Anthony Kiedis called Cheech & Chong \"some bad motherfuckers.\" That was bleeped out.\n\nSo were two curses in Chong's introduction. First he botched the script and said, \"I fucked up, I'm sorry.\" Then he adlibbed, \"Whenever I think of the band, you know, I think I think of somebody putting a sock on (bleeped).\"\n\nChong actually saved his best line for first. Just prior to Cheech & Chong standing in the audience explaining why the Chili Peppers were being honored, Snoop Dogg and Eminem collaborated on their smokin' hot high tune, \"From The D to The LBC,\" which opened with Snoop hitting a huge fake joint.\n\n\"We just wandered over here because we smelled that last performance,\" Chong said. \"It smelled like Snoop Dogg.\"\n\n\"That's because it was Snoop Dogg, dude,\" Marin pointed out\n\n\"Oh, even better, man,\" Chong replied.\n\nThe big VMA winners were Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, Nicki Minaj, Harry Styles, Billie Eilish and Jack Harlow."
