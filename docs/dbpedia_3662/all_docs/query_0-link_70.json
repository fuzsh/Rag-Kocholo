        "text": "Cheech and Chong\n\nComedy duo Cheech Marin, left, and Tommy Chong, are seen in 2008. The duo performed July 28 at the Sands Bethlehem Event Center.\n\n(AP File Photo )\n\nThe ticket said Cheech and Chong.\n\nBut the iconic comedy duo was hardly on stage Sunday night during their headlining performance at the\n\n.\n\nSeventies funk band War -- serving as both occasional back-up band and supporting act -- had more stage time. Even comedian Shelby Chong, who served as the show's emcee, seemed to be on stage more than her husband.\n\nBut the times they did appear, Cheech and Chong proved they still know how to work a room and command an audience's attention. They were dirty, they were raunchy, they were funny -- and they told a lot of pot jokes.\n\nThe evening -- which clocked in at three hours, with two intermissions -- felt slightly disjointed at times. It started out with with Cheech and Chong answering questions -- which were gathered by Shelby Chong earlier in the night -- from the audience. They talked candidly about meeting each other in Canada and then moving to Los Angeles where they honed their act at a topless bar Chong owned at the time, Cheech's acting career following their breakup in 1987 and Chong's arrest in 2003 and subsequent stint in prison.\n\nIt was a revealing moment in humility steeped in humor.\n\nThe two comedians then brought War on stage, with Chong on rhythm guitar, and led the band through a handful of dirty Cheech and Chong ditties -- including \"Me and My Old Lady\" and the James Brown-inspired \"Save the Whales.\"\n\nWar then took over for a brief set that included \"Gypsy Man,\" \"The World is a Ghetto\" and \"Summer.\" Their musicianship was solid -- bassist Francisco Tomaselli was especially impressive -- and their performance entertaining.\n\nBut the loudest applause was saved for Cheech and Chong. The pair's background in improv served them well as they treated their fans to a medley of their best bits. \"Harry Palms,\" their tribute to Christmas and \"Low Riders\" still have bite and had the crowd rolling (judging by the lingering smell of marijuana in the air, some more literally than figuratively).\n\nJust as they started gaining traction, they left the stage, again.\n\nWar then returned for more music, though the two slower numbers lacked the funky punch of their more up-tempo tunes. \"The Cisco Kid\" and their signature hit, \"Low Rider,\" unsurprisingly, had several front-row audience members out of their seats and dancing in the aisles.\n\nChong showed that he, too, is no slouch on the guitar (even if it is for comedic value); coming back out dressed up as his character Blind Melon Chitlin. He led War through \"Down Home Blues,\" which even had percussionist Marcos Reyes cracking up from behind his conga drums.\n\nBut it was Cheech who really had fans howling when he came charging on stage holding a guitar and wearing a pink tutu and mouse ears as his Alice Bowie character (Cheech and Chong's satire of glam rock and metal). He lip-synched, strutted and hammed it up to \"Earache My Eye\" as the crowd roared with cheers and applause.\n\nFollowing a wicked rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" by War harmonica player Stanley Behrens, Cheech came back out to sing \"the MexiCan national anthem.\" Chong joined him and the rest of War on the novelty song \"Born in East L.A.\" (sung to the tune of Bruce Springsteen's \"Born in the USA\"). All of the night's performers -- Shelby Chong included -- then closed out the night with a massive group sing-a-long to War's \"Why Can't We Be Friends.\"\n\nDespite the three decades that have passed since they lit up pop culture in the late '70s, Cheech and Chong showed that they still know how to find, and share, that coveted comedic high."
