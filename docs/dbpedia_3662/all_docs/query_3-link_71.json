        "text": "One of my earliest memories is sitting in the living room listening to my dad's comedy vinyl collection. Yes, I knew how to work a turn table at the age of 3. I just put on a funny sounding album called \"Cheech & Chong's Greatest Hit\" and the opening track, was like a toke to my funny bone!\n\n(Soft Knocking)\n\nChong: \"Who is it?\"\n\nCheech: \"It's me, Dave. Open up, man, I got the stuff\"\n\n(More knocks)\n\nChong: \"Who is it?\"\n\nCheech: \"It's, Dave, man. Open up, I think the cops saw me come in here.\"\n\nChong: \"Dave?\"\n\nCheech: \"Yeah, Dave. C'mon, man, open up, I think the cops saw me!\"\n\nChong: \"Dave's not here!\"\n\nThat is a truncated version of the classic that got me to love the iconic comedic duo, even though I've never smoked pot. (You don't have to do it to laugh at it, although I'm sure it can help). I'll have the official audio below, in case you've never heard this classic.\n\nIf you've read my other articles, then you know I'm a fan of comic books and graphic novels, so when word came down the pipe (pun intended) that Cheech & Chong had released \"Cheech & Chong's Chronicles\", I was far out there in nerd joy!\n\nCheck Out: The Offspring's Comic Is Letting The Bad Times Roll!\n\nFinding out there's a deluxe version and even limited edition autographed package... oh yeah, that got me high as a kite with excitement!\n\n\"An original graphic novel from the world's most iconic stoners - Pedro de Pacas (Cheech Marin) and Anthony \"Man\" Stoner (Tommy Chong). Follow along as they take you on a roadtrip to score cannabis all while giving you A Brief History of Weed.\" - Z2 Comics\n\nThe book written by Cheech & Chong with Eliot Rahal, was originally released last year, but went under many people's radar (mine included). But now we know, and have some choices, especially if you're an autograph seeker. Check it out now, before your chance goes Up In Smoke!\n\n23 Must-Own Rock + Metal Comics, Graphic Novels + Coffee Table Books\n\nAs Amazon affiliates, we earn on qualifying purchases.\n\nThe Weirdest Marvel Comics Ever Published\n\nOf all the thousands of comics published by Marvel, these are far and away the strangest.\n\nComedy Movies That Are Surprisingly Deep\n\nThese movies are good for a laugh â€” and a whole lot more.\n\nGallery Credit: Claire Epting\n\nReport a typo or correction\n\nGot a news tip?
