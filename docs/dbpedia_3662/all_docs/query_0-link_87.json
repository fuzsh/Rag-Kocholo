        "text": "where did you think I had it, On my D_ _ _?! fill in the blanks...that line is killer...even my Mom laughed! She like the duo.\n\nMy absolute favorite part of Up in Smoke is when the guys are playing the song \"Mexican American's\". Never has a song captured the similarities between different people more than that song. Then for Chong to start singing the next song, by himself in the presence of his Mexican American friend, showing the ignorance we can all show and inadvertent and dumb racism that is easy to see is A: really funny and B: extremely clever. All from a couple of stoners is very clever.\n\nBig fan of Born in East La too, \"Man I was BOOOOOORRRNNN in EAST LA\". Great song."
