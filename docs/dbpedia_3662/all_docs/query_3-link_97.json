        "text": "The golden age of the comedy duo has long since passed. Abbot & Costello, Laurel & Hardy, Stiller & Mira, Bob & Ray, those days are gone. Perhaps it is symptomatic of society's seemingly inexorable hurtle into narcissism and self-obsession, a dynamic that would logically diminish the attractiveness of collaboration, or perhaps it is coincidentally so, but the fact is that comedy duos are absent from the A list professional comedy landscape right now, with one exception. Cheech and Chong.\n\nAfter a more than 20 year hiatus of working closely together, Cheech and Chong have launched their historic Light Up, America reunion tour, and we are locally blessed to have this unrepeatable cultural juggernaut chug through the Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom. Shows are Thursday and Friday, probably sold out, but maybe if you have some incredible weed, you could talk somebody into letting go of an extra ticket.\n\nOnce in a while, something really cool happens at your job, right? Well, my editor asked me if I'd like to conduct a phone interview with Cheech and Chong. You have to understand, I'm 50. I was 15 when Big Bambu came out. I was a bright kid, and I didn't go in for most of the stoner art of the time but I really liked these guys. I get a chance to talk to two of my early comedy heroes. Cool!\n\nThe remainder of this article will be interview excerpts. If you want to hear the whole thing, I have a weekly radio show on the Portsmouth Community Radio Station (www.portsmouthcommunityradio.org) WSCA 106.1 FM called Culture Waves, and I will be airing the entire interview Thursday, Oct. 2 at 6 p.m. I interviewed Tommy Chong first, then Cheech Marin.\n\nChris Elliott: Why was Cheech and Chong so iconic?\n\nTommy Chong: We were the first reality show. What you saw is what we were. We were musicians, and we liked to get high. Cheech is a singer, I'm a guitar player, and even though we did the improvisational group, our initial idea was to put a band together. We started doing comedy together and just never stopped. We captured a timeless element. We're a tune that sticks in your head.\n\nCE: I listened to Big Bambu at prep school in 1973.\n\nTC: It was the forbidden record. You had to hide it, or your friend had it, the guy with the hip Mom. We took a whole culture and we capsulized it into movies, records and live performance. I can't stress enough though that we started with music. I was from the Motown school (Chong's band was signed to Motown in 1965) and Cheech was a music reviewer and a talented vocalist. When he did soul music like Basketball Jones, it was for real.\n\nCE: That was the golden age of the comedy record. Bill Cosby, George Carlin...;\n\nTC: We never got mainstream recognition either, which is also part of our longevity. Television can kill you. We dodged that bullet. We had an offer from NBC from Tartakoff, but we turned it down. It was what ended up being \"Chico and the Man,\" based on \"Pedro and Man\" (a celebrated C&C routine).They wanted us to do a TV show and they offered us a s***load of money and everything. We turned it down.\n\nCE: And that's going to stink up your brand.\n\nTC: Well what it did to Freddie is that he ultimately killed himself.\n\nCE: I know. And that's a real sad story. And just as the studios are figuring out that the Chicano experience makes for good television. You have always been known to be forthcoming with your views on politics and law enforcement.\n\nTC: My theory is, what I learned in prison, was that the universe is perfect. Our job is to learn, and you only learn from your mistakes. America is in a big learning curve right now.\n\nCE: So why now for the reunion tour?\n\nTC: The timing couldn't be better. It doesn't seem forced. That people seem to want it is the main thing. We've done nine shows so far. It feels great.\n\nCE: What about the pot that's around now relative to when you were making those records. It's a lot stronger now, don't you think?\n\nTC: Yeah, but do you remember hash? Hash and the weed today are about equal. What you did with hash is you just did a little bit. You didn't need to smoke a whole joint of hash, you couldn't. You just took a little block of it, put it on a pin and lit it up, toked it up, and you were as high as you wanted to be.\n\nCE: Marijuana has had a long time to prove itself. Is it a social pariah?\n\nTC: Marijuana is a medicine, and like all medicines, it can be abused. And if you abuse it, you pay the price. Marijuana is a medicine that should be treated with respect. As hemp it can clothe us, it can make paper and rope, and it's a medicine for countless ailments. It could provide employment, fuel for the country. The marijuana oil itself is a source for biofuel.\n\nChong served nine months in prison for selling bongs to Mormons posing as stoners. He sold glass, not dope, but was busted on federal charges, while the Philadelphia Cigar Company sells its blunts with impunity to any state in the nation. Tommy Chong got whacked by a cowardly state office too afraid to look for real drug dealers cooking up bad dope in the bathtub with shotguns all around, preferring instead to leverage Chong's name recognition over justice.\n\nChong's umbilical associate Cheech Marin has had a spectacular career in movies and television since Cheech and Chong, and he too was gracious in agreeing to talk with me over the phone. I have to tell you, this was so fun. Cheech's call started behind schedule so I had to hurry it short, but here is some of it.\n\nCE: Why was Cheech and Chong so iconic?\n\nCM: I think we touched a nerve, and represented the footsoldiers of a cultural revolution. We were two grunts in the trenches. It's funny how we were so of the time, but now that we bring it out again and people are so excited about it that it's timeless too.\n\nCE: I must compliment you on your voice work with Cheech and Chong. A lot of people I have talked to don't know that you were the Sister Mary Elephant and numerous other non Hispanic, non male characters.\n\nSo I gotta ask you the weed question.\n\nCM: You mean do I have any? I think the value of marijuana outweighs any negative effects. It's the current beer. Everybody smokes it.\n\nCE: It is the great equalizer, isn't it?\n\nCM: From coast to coast and from age to age. Any drug can be abused. You shouldn't make policy because of a few irresponsible people.\n\nCE: How do you see your role in Chicano activism?\n\nCM: At this point I'm one of the elder statesmen, and maybe an example of what can happen. I'm trusted by the community, and I appreciate that and always work to continue to earn it. I try to be prideful of my heritage. I participate in the art scene...;\n\nCE: I understand that you are a collector of Chicano art.\n\nCM: That's kind of my passion right now. We just finished a six year tour across the United States. We were at the Smithsonian for six months, we were at the DeYoung in San Francisco. It was a raising experience.\n\nCE: Is there anything else you want to say to local listeners?\n\nCM: Come out and have fun with us. We're having a ball doing this tour. Come out and laugh with us, and kick back and have a good time.\n\nCheck it out. It's the show of the season, get a ticket even if you have to fork something over you'd been saving for a special occasion. This is in fact a special occasion.\n\nWHEN Thursday, Oct. 2 and Friday, Oct. 3, 7:30 p.m. (Friday show sold out as of press time) WHERE Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom, 169 Ocean Blvd., Hampton COST $33-$65 CONTACT 929-4100, www.casinoballroom.com\n\nWHAT Light Up America ...
