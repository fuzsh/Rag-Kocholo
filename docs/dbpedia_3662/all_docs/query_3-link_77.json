        "text": "So, anyhow, Santa Claus. Right, yeah. Before Christmas Day gets away from us, sit down, kids, and let Cheech and Chong tell the story.\n\nThe premise, in the unlikely event you’ve not heard this: One stoner tries to explain Santa Claus to another stoner. Santa used to live in the projects, then started a commune, then got busted at the border, but is not a musician. Sorry. You really had to be there. Being under the influence helps.\n\nA gem of truth tucked inside this bit: “We could sure use a dude like that right now.”\n\n“Santa Claus and his Old Lady,” Cheech & Chong, Ode 7-inch single 66021, released December 1971. (The flip side to the single was “Dave,” another stoner classic.)\n\nhttps://amthenfm.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/cheech-and-chong-santa-claus-and-his-old-lady.mp3\n\nThis bit never appeared on any of their albums. It’s available on CD on “Where There’s Smoke, There’s Cheech and Chong,” a 2-CD best-of compilation released in 2002.\n\nPlease visit our companion blog, The Midnight Tracker, for more vintage vinyl, one side at a time.\n\nA furlough week over, we’re back at work.\n\nMore importantly, we’re being paid for it.\n\nThat said, our mantra remains: If we couldn’t laugh, we would all go insane.\n\nLife in the newsroom is no less absurd this week than it was when I last worked two weeks ago. It often goes a bit like this.\n\n“Dave,” Cheech and Chong, from “Cheech and Chong,” 1971.\n\nhttps://amthenfm.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/06-dave.mp3\n\nBarely a minute long, this is about as good as a comedy bit gets. It’s fairly simple, yet it fires up your imagination as you envision Dave one one side of the door and the stoner on the other side.\n\nThere are plenty of days when your boss is as clueless as the stoner, aren’t there? You feel a little like Dave, don’t you?\n\nSome days, you get no respect, I tell ya.\n\nHead over to The Midnight Tracker for our take on that.\n\nThere, the other day, in the July 4 issue of Sports Illustrated, was “The Ultimate Play List,” what its writers considered the best sports songs of all time.\n\nSI’s Top 40 includes the Beach Boys’ “Surfin USA” at No. 2, John Fogerty’s “Centerfield” at No. 7, Warren Zevon’s “Boom Boom Mancini” at No. 12, Steve Goodman’s “A Dying Cub Fan’s Last Request” at No. 28 and Kurtis Blow’s “Basketball” at No. 31. That’s about it for songs I recognize.\n\n(I only grudgingly include the Fogerty tune. Even though I enthusiastically bought the “Centerfield” LP in 1985, the title song quickly wore out its welcome and has been unlistenable for years.)\n\nWhether SI’s Top 40 is good or bad, as always, you be the judge. I can’t say it blew me away. As I read the piece, I kept wondering whether certain tunes would show up in the Top 40. They didn’t. So here they are.\n\n“Bill Lee,” Warren Zevon, from “Bad Luck Streak In Dancing School,” 1980. It’s out of print but is available digitally.\n\nhttps://amthenfm.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/09-bill-lee.mp3\n\nLee — nicknamed “Spaceman” — was an irreverent left-hander, a California hippie who was good enough to pitch in the major leagues for 14 years, from 1969 to 1982. Lee liked Zevon, and Zevon liked Lee. Boston Red Sox manager Don Zimmer, who was from baseball’s old school, did not like Lee. Zevon wrote this song after the Red Sox got rid of Lee in 1978. That’ll happen when you spar with your manager all year long and call him “a gerbil.”\n\n“You’re supposed to sit on your ass/And nod at stupid things\n\nMan, that’s hard to do\n\nAnd if you don’t, they’ll screw you/And if you do they’ll screw you, too.”\n\n“Vida Blue,” Albert Jones, from the Tri-City 45 (TC327A), 1971. It’s out of print.\n\nhttps://amthenfm.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/vida-blue.mp3\n\nAlmost everything I know about this “stomping funk tribute to the early ’70s Oakland A’s hurler of the same name” is from Larry Grogan’s most excellent Funky 16 Corners post from last year. As Larry also said then: “Where else are you going to hear a funk 45 that namechecks Harmon Killebrew and Carl Yastrzemski?” (The flip side is a country version of the song, according to Scott Soriano’s long-ago Crud Crud post.)\n\n“Basketball Jones Featuring Tyrone Shoelaces,” Cheech and Chong, from “Los Cochinos,” 1973.\n\nhttps://amthenfm.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/11-basketball-jones-featuring-tyrone-shoelaces.mp3\n\nThis is a song remembered mostly because I so often heard it sung in the shower by the players on my high school basketball team. Sorry, you had to be there.\n\nTo get a sense for that vibe all these years later, watch the animated short they made for the song. It was released to theaters in 1974. They showed it before “The Last Detail,” which of course starred basketball fan Jack Nicholson.\n\nThere’s an all-star group behind Cheech Marin’s falsetto vocals. That’s George Harrison on lead guitar, backed by many of his Beatles session friends, including Billy Preston on the organ. Carole King plays electric piano. Darlene Love and Michelle Phillips are among those voicing the cheerleaders.\n\nWe were talking the other night about Christmas presents for our son, who’s 15, a sophomore in high school. At issue was whether we have that one big gift, the one with the wow factor.\n\nI was thinking back to when I was 15, what that one big gift was. It was Christmas 1972. That one big gift was this:\n\nThat is a suede leather Converse All-Star basketball shoe, gold with black trim. I, too, was a sophomore the year I got a pair. It was a big deal. I’m not sure my parents fully understood the attraction, but they popped for the $15 — almost $75 in today’s dollars — to get them. I wore them until they wore out, then kept them around for years as something close to sandals.\n\nThere are other good memories of that one big gift. The Tickle Bee game, G.I. Joe, the Packers helmet and jersey, and, of course, that Panasonic AM-FM radio.\n\nNow we have one big gift for you. More of our favorite Christmas tunes, the ones without which it wouldn’t be Christmas.\n\n“Happy Xmas (War Is Over),” John Lennon and Yoko Ono, the Plastic Ono Band and the Harlem Community Choir, released as a single, 1971. A remastered version is available on “Gimme Some Truth,” a 4-CD compilation released earlier this year.\n\n“And so this is Christmas, and what have you done?“\n\n“Snoopy’s Christmas,” the Royal Guardsmen, from “Snoopy and His Friends,” 1967. (The link is to a double CD also featuring “Snoopy vs. the Red Baron,” their debut album from 1966.)\n\n“Merry Christmas, mein friend!“\n\n“Winter Wonderland,” Steve Goodman, from “Artistic Hair,” 1983. I bought this record at his show in Madison, Wisconsin, in April of that year. He signed it “Joe — Hello.”\n\n“It’s kind of absurd/when you don’t know the words/to sing/\n\nwalkin’ in a winter wonderland!”\n\n“All I Want for Christmas,” Timbuk3, 1987, from “A Different Kind of Christmas,” 1994. It’s out of print. Pat MacDonald grew up here in Green Bay and has returned. These days, he performs as pat mAcdonald — he insists on that spelling. His gig notices also say “Timbuk3 (no space!) is to be mentioned in a biographical context only.” So there!\n\n“All I want for Christmas is world peace.”\n\n“Merry Christmas Baby (alternate edit),” Elvis Presley, 1971, from “Reconsider Baby,” 1985. It’s out of print, and pricey if you can find it. It’s my favorite Elvis record, full of his blues tunes. That it’s on blue vinyl is just icing on the cake.\n\n“Wake up, Putt!”\n\n“Twelve Days of Christmas,” Bob and Doug McKenzie, from “Great White North,” 1981.\n\n“OK, so g’day, this is the Christmas part.”\n\n“Santa Claus and his Old Lady,” Cheech and Chong, from Ode single 66021, released December 1971. Also available on “Where There’s Smoke, There’s Cheech and Chong,” a 2-CD best-of compilation released in 2002.\n\n“We could sure use a dude like that right now.”\n\nNo great lines, just great tunes\n\n“White Christmas,” the Edwin Hawkins Singers, from “Peace Is ‘Blowin’ in the Wind’.” 1972. It’s out of print with that title, but is available as “Edwin Hawkins Singers Christmas,” with essentially the same cover. This has a great solo by Tramaine Davis.\n\n“Christmas Medley,” the Salsoul Orchestra, from “Christmas Jollies,” 1976. This is 12 minutes of soul, salsa and dance bliss. An instant party starter.\n\n“Halleujah! It’s Christmas,” .38 Special, from “A Wild-Eyed Christmas Night,” 2001. Re-released in 2008 as “The Best of .38 Special: The Christmas Collection,” one of those 20th Century Masters reissues. This joyous, upbeat tune — written by guitarists Don Barnes and Danny Chauncey and lead singer Donnie Van Zant — ought to be a classic.\n\n“Feliz Navidad,” Robert Greenidge, from “It’s Christmas, Mon!”, 1995. It’s out of print. Though Greenidge gets no cover billing on this CD, he’s playing the steel pan. He’s been with Jimmy Buffett’s Coral Reefer Band since 1983. Earlier this year, Greenidge and his bandmates released “A Coral Reefer Christmas” on Buffett’s Mailboat Records label. This tune is not on that record.\n\n“Christmas in the City of the Angels,” Johnny Mathis, from Columbia 1-11158, a 7-inch single, 1979. Though Mathis has recorded several Christmas albums, this cut never made it onto one. People ask for it every year. (This cut has gone from radio to tape to CD, and then ripped, so that may explain the sound quality if you find it lacking.)\n\nBonus gifts!\n\nSome of our friends have sent along some tunes they thought you’d like.\n\n“Must Have Been A Mighty Day,” Emily Hurd, from “Tins and Pins and Peppermints,” 2010. She’s a singer-songwriter from Chicago by way of Rockford, Ill., where we have a mutual friend. It’s been interesting to listen to her style evolve, moving from loose and gritty to far more poised and polished. This tune has a bit of both styles. She previewed this record for fans last year, then released it this year.\n\n“Cashing In On Christmastime,” Charles Ramsey, 2010. He’s a singer-songwriter from Philadelphia who has some other nice, non-holiday stuff on his MySpace page. This genial, laid-back cut reminds me of Bob Dylan or Tom Petty with the Traveling Wilburys.\n\n“Christmas Medley,” the Midwesterners, 2009. A pleasant little instrumental featuring Richard Wiegel, the guitarist in this band out of Madison, Wisconsin. He was one of the guitarists in Clicker, the much-loved ’70s Wisconsin rock/pop/glam/show band we write about from time to time.\n\nCheech and Chong are getting back together, planning their first standup tour in more than 25 years.\n\nWhy now, after having split up in the mid-’80s?\n\nThey offered a fairly sensible reason: “We’ve gotten to the age where we don’t feel like fighting anymore because the end is a lot closer than the beginning,” Cheech Marin said.\n\nTheirs is a comedy of its time — the ’70s. I wonder how it’ll play to today’s younger audiences. Will they get what makes the following bit such great satire on several levels? You really had to be there, man.\n\n“Let’s Make a Dope Deal,” Cheech and Chong, from “Big Bambu,” 1972.\n\nEver heard of Monty Hall, man? No? Where you been living, man?\n\nOh, you got the CD? Don’t worry about that “parental advisory” and “explicit lyrics” sticker, man. That’s just The Man trying to keep us down, man.\n\nThe tour starts Sept. 12, man. More details here."
