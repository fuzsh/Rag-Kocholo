        "text": "Cheech and Chong’s “Basketball Jones featuring Tyrone Shoelaces” first appeared on the 1973 album Los Cochinos. The songs opening lyric, “basketball jones, I got a basketball jones”, references “jones” as slang for craving or addiction. A “basketball jones” thus refers to loving basketball so much that it overtakes all other thoughts.\n\nSung in falsetto by Cheech Marin, playing the title character Tyrone (as in “tie-your-own”) Shoelaces, musicians who appeared on the record included George Harrison, Billy Preston, Tom Scott, and Carole King (so the record became the highest peaking single on which she appeared during 1973). The Blossoms and Michelle Phillips (from The Mamas & the Papas) performed vocals as cheerleaders on the track.\n\nOther members of the ad-hoc all-stars included Nicky Hopkins (piano), Tom Scott (sax), Billy Preston (organ), Jimmy Karstein (drums) and Jim Keltner (percussion)."
