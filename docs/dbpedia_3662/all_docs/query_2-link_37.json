        "text": "aTomiK\n\n.... has green eyes as well....\n\nMember # 6575\n\n7 Updates!\n\nMember Rated:\n\nposted\n\n\"Cheech & Chong are a Grammy award winning comedy duo consisting of Richard \"Cheech\" Marin and Tommy Chong,\n\nwho found a wide audience in the 1970s and 1980s for their films and stand-up routines, which were based on the hippie and free love era,\n\nand especially drug culture movements, most notably their love for cannabis.\" (Wikipedia)\n\nWhat do you guys think about the duo and the movies?\n\nI´ve seen some of them but don´t remember much. I own Nice Dreams and The Corsican Brothers.\n\nFuture Film is going to release Next Movie and Get Out of My Room here next month, so i´m gonna watch some C&C films later this spring.\n\nCheech & Chong's Next Movie was banned here back in the day.\n\nNow i can laugh to those decisions but it was tough to be a movie fan in Finland back then.\n\nPosts: 7053 | From: Finland | Registered: Feb 2008 | Site Updates: 7 | IP: Logged | Johnny Roarke is reckless\n\nRewind Icon\n\nMember # 9826\n\nMember Rated:\n\nposted I've never seen Get Out of My Room and Things are Tough All Over, but i think Crash is right\n\nthat most of them aren't particularly good, especially The Corsican Brothers.\n\nI thought Nice Dreams was pretty decent though.\n\nUp in Smoke on the other hand, is very funny.\n\nCheck out this clip : www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX_Wuvya0iU\n\nIt's funny from the get go, but it gets hilarious around the 5 minute spot.

Stalked by keystone-style cops,\n\nLos Guys have a series of encounters with L.A. area characters even weirder than themselves.\" (IMDb)\n\nDamn this was a fantastic film, i loved every second.\n\nAgain directed by Tommy Chong and co-starring Paul Reubens and hottie Evelyn Guerrero as Donna.\n\nEven Stacy Keach is back as Sarge Stedanko.\n\nHe´s an addict himself now and slowly turns into a lizard!\n\nThings get even more weird when we get to the Casa Del Whacko sequence.\n\nGreat locations, nice tunes, hot Donna and cool, easygoing atmosphere.\n\nYou have to see it to believe it!\n\nNice Dreams trailer\n\nC&C performing the classic \"Save the Whales\"\n\nPosts: 7053 | From: Finland | Registered: Feb 2008 | Site Updates: 7 | IP: Logged | aTomiK\n\n.... has green eyes as well....\n\nMember # 6575\n\n7 Updates!\n\nMember Rated:\n\nposted Things are Tough All Over (1982)\n\nAnother pretty good C&C movie directed by Thomas K. Avildsen.\n\n(I wonder is he a real person or Tommy Chong in disguise)\n\n\"Cheech and Chong work briefly as car wash attendants and musicians before being hired to drive a car\n\nfrom Chicago to Las Vegas. Unbeknownst to them, their employers (themselves in double roles)\n\nhave concealed five million dollars of dirty money in the upholstery. A series of adventures ensues,\n\nincluding the making of a \"porn film\" featuring 'The Guys' and their real-life squeezes. (IMDb)\n\nWhile not as good as the previous films, this was still fun stuff.\n\nSome jokes are just too long and lack a real punch line.\n\nGreat new characters Mr. Slyman and Prince Habib, the classic \"hairpiece\" joke plus\n\nsexy Donna and \"the laughing man\" Old Timer (John Steadman) are back once again.\n\nThings are Tough All Over trailer Posts: 7053 | From: Finland | Registered: Feb 2008 | Site Updates: 7 | IP: Logged | aTomiK\n\n.... has green eyes as well....\n\nMember # 6575\n\n7 Updates!\n\nMember Rated:\n\nposted Still Smokin (1983)\n\n\"Cheech & Chong are invited to a celebrity party/festival in Amsterdam.\n\nWhen they get there, however, it turns out that the guy who invited them has taken off with all the money,\n\nand the rest of the hosts have a VERY limited budget.\n\nThey are actually expecting Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton, so our heroes gets to be Mr. Burt and Mr. Dolly.\n\nWe follow them around Amsterdam, at their hotel, (still) smokin' joints and doing shows.\" (IMDb)\n\nWatched also this one yesterday, the film was directed by Tommy Chong (surprise!)\n\nIn this movie we can see C&C performing their skits, old and new.\n\nSome during the Amsterdam plot and some on stage.\n\nThis is basically like a Cheech & Chong tv-special, with extra foul language of course.\n\nI laughed few times but i recommend it only for die-hard C&C fans.\n\nStill Smokin trailer Posts: 7053 | From: Finland | Registered: Feb 2008 | Site Updates: 7 | IP: Logged | Booger\n\nMaster Rewinder\n\nMember # 4569\n\nRate Member posted I'm a fan of Up in Smoke and Next Movie. I liked Next Movie better. After that one, in my opinion, it was all downhill from there.\n\nI used to have several of their comedy albums as a teen in the 80s. I wore out my cassettes of Greatest Hits and Get out of My Room.\n\nI think the best jokes are in Next Movie. Most of them are worth viewing but are really dated.\n\nI saw Tommy Chong do live stand-up a few years ago and his act was totally unlike anything he used to do. But to be fair, this was without Cheech.\n\nThere have been some funny stoner comedies in the past 10-15 years. With that being said, I don't think I could recommend the Cheech and Chong flicks to anyone not from that era. I don't think they would understand or appreciate them for what they are.

Clinton and i usually love his stuff!\n\nWell, it was one of his first musical scores so i´ll forgive him\n\nThe Corsican Brothers movie trailer\n\nC&C as The Corsican Brothers\n\nPosts: 7053 | From: Finland | Registered: Feb 2008 | Site Updates: 7 | IP: Logged | aTomiK\n\n.... has green eyes as well....\n\nMember # 6575\n\n7 Updates!\n\nMember Rated:\n\nposted Get Out of My Room (1985)\n\nThis was a fun 50 minute C&C mockumentary based on their 1985 album of the same name.\n\nWe can see C&C and their fans fooling around plus four music videos.\n\nLots of familiar people can be seen during the film\n\nincluding Jan-Michael Vincent, Cassandra \"Elvira\" Peterson, Beverly D´Angelo, Darcy DeMoss,\n\nMary Woronov and Playboy sisters Alana and Leilani Soares.\n\nSuperfun stuff!\n\nCheech and Chong - Born in East L.A.\n\nC&C - I´m Not Home Right Now\n\nFinnish dvd cover art:\n\nPosts: 7053 | From: Finland | Registered: Feb 2008 | Site Updates: 7 | IP: Logged |"
