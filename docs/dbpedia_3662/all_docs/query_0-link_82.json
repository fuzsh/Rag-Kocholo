        "text": "\"Basketball Jones featuring Tyrone Shoelaces\" is a song by Cheech and Chong that first appeared on the 1973 album Los Cochinos. Sung in falsetto by Cheech Marin, playing the title character Tyrone (as in \"tie-your-own\") Shoelaces, it told the story of Shoelaces' love of basketball. It was a parody of the song \"Love Jones\" by Brighter Side of Darkness. In the album version, the song was preceded by a mock interview with Jones' basketball coach named \"Umgwana Kickbooti\" (or something like that), in a parody of a Wide World of Sports interview conducted by a character named \"Red Blazer\". \"Jones\", both in the original song and this parody, is slang for \"craving\" or \"addiction\".\n\nCheech and Chong is the 1971 self-titled debut album of Cheech & Chong, produced by Lou Adler.. It features \"Dave\", one of their most famous routines. The album peaked at #28 on the Billboard 200 the week of March 4, 1972.\n\nCheech & Chong's Greatest Hit is a comedy album by Cheech & Chong. The album is a \"greatest hits\" compilation, featuring some of their best known comedy bits. Much to some fans disliking, some tracks were edited for this release. Oddly, the 1:34 track \"Dave\" is broken into two separate tracks, and is edited down for time. Also, \"Earache My Eye\" fades out just before the argument between father and son."
