        "text": "Tradition and innovation, quality and ability to connect with the professional world are the cornerstones that have made POLI.design since 1999 one of the reference companies at an international level for post-graduate training.\n\nTogether with the School of Design of the Politecnico di Milano and the Department of Design, POLI.design forms the Design System of the Politecnico, an aggregate of resources, skills, structures and laboratories, among the most important in the world.\n\nPOLI.design is the post-graduate school in Design of the Politecnico di Milano that supports and completes the curricular paths of the School of Design, aiming at professional training and an effective insertion in the many areas of work in which the designer operates today.\n\nIt plays a hinge role between universities, businesses, organizations and institutions and professional worlds, operating in the perspective of internationalization and establishing partnerships with universities, schools, organizations, institutions, companies and companies from time to time.\n\nIn complex and closely interrelated worlds such as those we live in today, Design represents a resource that can guide societies and production systems towards new development models; it is also a resource that is nowadays crucial for standing up to global competition in terms of identity and diversity.\n\nDesign is a driving force behind growth that can guide individual and collective choices through cultural trends, guiding tastes, behaviours, lifestyles, and consumption styles. It has numerous and highly varied applications: from research and applications connected with the introduction of new technologies, to designing new products and services, from the study of communication interfaces to managing ergonomic and environmental qualities, from defining urban spaces and one’s own body, to governing processes connected with environmental and social sustainability policies.\n\nIn this context, POLI.design proposes to:\n\nUnite the academic and business cultures and the world of knowledge professionals;\n\npromote and develop design as a discipline and system of professions;\n\nFoster virtuous relationships between universities, institutions, manufacturers, and professionals;\n\nSupport the development of creative enterprises.\n\nPOLI.design is based in Milan, a universally known and recognised international centre of excellence for design. The permanent structures, cultural institutions, fairs and showrooms, publishing industry, schools, displays, exhibitions, and events that the city has to offer are numerous and contribute to creating a culturally lively and dynamic climate that can enrich professional and training courses, providing a broader experience of design in all its most up-to-date forms, from the perspective of constant innovation.\n\nRelations with the professional sphere are endorsed by the presence of four of the most important associations of design professionals on the board of POLI.design:\n\nPOLI.design operates within an international network, that is continuously growing thanks to the wide-ranging experiences and collaborations in an increasingly interconnected and global dimension. Our objective is to promote and spread the design culture, through enhancing and intensifying our international relations.\n\nPOLI.design has built strong relationships with companies and institutions worldwide by offering training programs for international students, professionals and companies, and by organizing tailored training courses and site-specific projects.\n\nThe goal of POLI.design is to promote the exchange, access and mobility in the world of design, strengthening and intensifying relations, in a perspective of spreading the culture of design.\n\nPOLI.design involves each year international students coming from 88 countries all over the world, such as Colombia, Brasil, Peru, Mexico, Chile, Ecuador, China, Costa Rica, Turkey, Russia, India, Uruguay, Greece, Lebanon, Switzerland, Denmark, Korea, Thailand, Morocco, Mauritius, Qatar, Uganda, etc.\n\nThe POLIMI Design System made by the Design Department, the School of Design and POLI.design, is located in the Bovisa district, north of the city of Milan, a short distance from the city center, in a symbolic place of the industrial Milan of the past.\n\nThe neighborhood is now experiencing a broad process of urban transformation, destined to become a pole of higher education, research and innovation.\n\nThe Politecnico di Milano began its history in Bovisa by settling almost twenty years ago in what is now the headquarters in via Durando, in the re-adapted factory of the former Ceretti & Tanfani, where in the past cables for cable cars were manufactured."
