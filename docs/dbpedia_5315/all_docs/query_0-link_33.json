        "text": "This special issue gathers together articles which explicitly engage with the journal’s action in local, national, and international cultural networks, from Solaria’s inception in 1926 to the demise of Botteghe Oscure in 1960. The chronological spectrum of this guest-edited issue ensures that, for instance, we can identify the main phases of the development of a disinterested, and seemingly apolitical, approach to the role of the arts, cutting across Solaria, Letteratura, and Botteghe Oscure, linking together Florence, Rome and the various foreign republics of letters with which these journals dialogued over the years\n\nThis study focuses on the controversy about the concept of 'tradition' which developed within 1950's Italian architectural culture as a result of discussions between Italian architect Giancarlo De Carlo and a new generation, in particular a student group whom he called 'the column kids.' This controversy at first seems to be merely a dualistic opposition between the 'modern' De Carlo, who promoted the modern movement, and the 'classical' column kids, who chose to explore neoclassical architecture. However, by looking more closely at the differences in terms of historical perspective between both positions, this study shows that this apparent opposition indicates a profound shift in the architectural paradigm, and that the ideas and vocabulary of Marxist literary theory contributed towards this new paradigm, as proposed by the column kids."
