He competed in the 2024 Paris Olympics and will complete his master’s in 2025.\n\n“With a laptop and Wi-Fi connection, you can work from anywhere”\n\nEPFL community\n\nEmilie Dorer will soon complete her computer science training at EPFL, under the supervision of Luc Venries. Thanks to his support, she was able to venture out of her comfort zone and overcome her learning difficulties.\n\n“Teaching made me discover a whole new aspect of my personality”\n\nEPFL\n\nJosé Luis Zuleta, a mathematics lecturer at EPFL, uses cooking examples to whet his students’ appetite for learning – and corny jokes to keep their attention. His strategy seems to be working, as he was named the best teacher in the mathematics section for 2023."
