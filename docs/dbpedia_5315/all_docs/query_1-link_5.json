        "text": "After the liberation from Fascism and the end of Second World War, Italy put many efforts in the reconstruction of the country based on industrial development, despite the initial skepticism of the American administration. Cultural projects supporting or at least addressing such a strategy often took the shape of journals that discussed technology and scientific knowledge besides literature and the arts. Overcoming traditional boundaries between art, the humanities, and science, this surprising blend seemed to manifest a holistic will of renewal; an intellectual and artistic claim to interpret and even influence economic developments; an effort to aestheticize profane aspects of life.\n\nThe state-owned holding IRI (Institute for the Industrial Reconstruction) and the private publishing house Giulio Einaudi Editore offer excellent opportunities for studying this topic. The journals Il Politecnico (1945-1947) and Il menabò (1959-1967), published by Einaudi and edited by Elio Vittorini, made the readers aware of technology’s economic and political settings, of its benefits and risks. They engaged with technology from a political and poetic perspective, promoting a unique kind of popularization based on innovative graphic design and literary language."
