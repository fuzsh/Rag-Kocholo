Most notably, both journals paid significant attention to politically committed literary and essay translations. By combining an analysis of the journals' articles and translations with the editors' published and unpublished correspondence, the article reassesses the journals' relationship and illuminates the engagement of the two editorial boards through translations. The analysis of the two intellectual networks and projects will re-establish the relevance of Sud in stimulating a transnational dialogue and will reconsider the role of translation in shaping the editors' political identities. Finally, the article offers a geo-cultural perspective on post-war Italian impegno by charting its multiple, both national and transnational, identities.\n\nRequest changes or add full text files to a record\n\nRepository staff actions (login required)"
