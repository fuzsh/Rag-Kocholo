        "text": "The university pre-enrolment application is the first step to be taken by a candidate for a university course in Italy in order to apply for a visa for study purposes at an Italian diplomatic representation.\n\nThis “pre-enrolment application” is made exclusively through the Universitaly portal. The “university pre-enrolment” procedure is different and distinct from that of “enrolment”, which will take place subsequently and on the basis of procedures within each individual university, without the involvement of diplomatic representations.\n\nUniversity pre-enrolment is a compulsory procedure, which is the responsibility of the Embassy and precedes the phase of issuing the study visa and the university enrolment phases; it concerns foreign students abroad and must be concluded before the student’s enrolment procedure at the chosen university. Enrolment is the procedure for registering the student and is the responsibility of the University and is concluded after the pre-enrolment and visa issuing phases.\n\nYou can pre-register for several courses at the same time, there is no maximum number to be respected. However, some groups of courses are accessed through the same selection process and you can therefore only apply for a certain number of courses (preferences).\n\nIf you choose a three-year degree course, magistral degree course or single-cycle magistral degree course in italian, a B2 level Italian language proficiency is required (see more: https://www.studiare-in-italia.it/studentistranieri/moduli/2022/Circolare_2022_2023_EN.pdf).\n\nIf you have chosen a course of study in English, you are not required to have level B2 Italian language skills."
