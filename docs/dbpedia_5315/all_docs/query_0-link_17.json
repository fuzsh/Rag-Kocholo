        "text": "In the early 1940s, Felice Balbo and Giaime Pintor judged and re-envisioned Europe from a shared observation point in Turin with two institutional settings: the publishing house Giulio Einaudi Editore and the Italian Committee for the Armistice with France. Their privileged perspective—so far little known outside Italy—offers interesting clues about forms of opposition to Fascism and National Socialism by a generation that grew up under dictatorship. Drawing on unpublished sources and memoirs, this essay retraces a dialogue among friends, showing how young members of the Italian intelligentsia designed eccentric scenarios to overcome a nazified Europe. An overly enthusiastic reception of American culture, illusions about impending insurrections in Germany, and a general attraction to German culture helped Balbo and Pintor in becoming active antifascists.\n\n2 Luigi Einaudi, a regular contributor to the influential daily newspaper Corriere della Sera, was “Senatore del Regno d’Italia” from 1919 on, opposing the new Fascist rulers after the murder of the socialist politician Giacomo Matteotti in 1924. After his exile in Switzerland (Oct. 1943–Dec. 1944) he became governor of the Bank of Italy in 1945 and president of the Italian Republic in 1948.\n\n15 Pintor, Giaime, Doppio diario, 1936–1943, ed. Serri, Mirella (Turin, 1978), 84 Google Scholar. A second, complete, and amended edition of Pintor's notebook is definitely required, as Maria Cecilia Calabri claims. See Calabri, Maria Cecilia, “Della dissimulazione onesta. Giaime Pintor tra amici e censori,” in Falaschi, Giovanni, ed., Giaime Pintor e la sua generazione (Rome, 2005), 141–209, at 188–9Google Scholar. Note that General Pietro Pintor had been the first president of the Italian Committee for the Armistice with France. See Rainero, Romain H., La commission italienne d’armistice avec la France: Les rapports entre la France de Vichy et l’Italie de Mussolini. 10 juin 1940–8 septembre 1943 (Saint-Maixent-l’Ecole, 1995), 53 Google Scholar.\n\n19 “Lettre de Giaime Pintor à son frère,” Les temps modernes, 3, 23–4 (Aug.–Sept. 1947), special issue on Italy, 327–30, at 327. Pintor, Giaime, “L’ultima lettera,” in Pintor, Il sangue d’Europa, 1939–1943, ed. Gerratana, Valentino, 2nd edn (Turin, 1966), 185–8Google Scholar. In 1979 the leftist intellectual Franco Fortini highlighted Pintor's membership in the upper middle class, an identity that had become evident through the publication of Pintor's diary a few months before, discrediting his supposed antifascist reputation. Fortini's opinions launched a controversy persisting until quite recently. Fortini, Franco, Insistenze: Cinquanta scritti 1976–1984 (Milan, 1985), 162–71Google Scholar.\n\n24 Letter by Felice Balbo, signed with his nickname “Cicino,” to Giaime Pintor, 10 July [1943], Archivio Centrale dello Stato (ACS), Archivio Giaime Pintor (AGP), Busta 2, Fasc. 63, original emphasis. This letter has been partially published in a footnote in Calabri, Maria Cecilia, Il costante piacere di vivere: Vita di Giaime Pintor (Turin, 2007), 587 Google Scholar. Despite a remark on his own modest German-language skills, Balbo could probably speak German. See Pintor's letter of 29 August 1942 to General Gelich, in Pintor, Doppio diario, 172.\n\n27 See Ricci, Nicola, Cattolici e marxismo: Filosofia e politica in Augusto del Noce, Felice Balbo e Franco Rodano (Milan, 2008)Google Scholar; Casula, Carlo Felice, Cattolici-comunisti e sinistra cristiana (1938–1945) (Bologna, 1976)Google Scholar; Invitto, Giovanni, Le idee di Felice Balbo: Una filosofia pragmatica dello sviluppo (Bologna, 1979)Google Scholar. See also Saresella, Daniela, “The Dialogue between Catholics and Communists in Italy during the 1960s,” Journal of the history of Ideas, 75/3 (July 2014), 493–512 CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n32 About the rhetoric of “patriots” Philip E. Cooke writes, “The concept of the nation was at the core of the partisan press, with frequent reference to past glories, above all the Risorgimento.” Cooke, Philip E., The Legacy of the Italian Resistance (New York, 2011), 29 CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n35 According to the map attached to the armistice document of 24 June 1940, Gap lies in the region under Italian responsibility for the control of military equipment of the non-occupied French territory. Rainero, La commission italienne d’armistice avec la France, Tables 2, 5, 7, at 400–1.\n\n38 Felice Balbo, “Il laboratorio dell’uomo,” in Balbo, Opere 1945–1964, 105–200, at 171. Vittorini, Diario in pubblico, 98–9. For a detailed treatment of the subject see Morsi, Gamal, “America ist immer woanders”: Die Rezeption des American Dream in Italien (Marburg, 2001)Google Scholar. On Balbo's transition from Americanism to anti-Americanism in the late 1940s see Invitto, Le idee di Felice Balbo, 30–34. In the 1930s, Vittorini had the translator Lucia Morpurgo Rodocanachi produce several literal translations of texts by American writers that he then elaborated and published under his own name without any mention of the collaboration—often even without paying the contracted fee. See Aveto, Andrea, “Traduzioni d’autore e no: Elio Vittorini e la ‘segreta’ collaborazione con Lucia Rodocanachi,” in Contorbia, Franco, ed., Lucia Rodocanachi: Le carte, la vita (Florence, 2006), 153–92Google Scholar.\n\n50 Ibid. Balbo will come back to these images in L’uomo senza miti and Il laboratorio dell’uomo (Turin, 1946). The opposition of many Italian Catholics to the alliance with National Socialist Germany, concentrated in the image of the beast, appears in an informer's report of 29 August 1939 about the opinion expressed inside the Azione Cattolica Italiana, a major lay Catholic movement, quoted in Moro, Renato, “Die italienischen Katholiken und der Krieg der ‘Achse’,” in Klinkhammer, Lutz, Guerrazzi, Amedeo Osti, and Schlemmer, Thomas, eds., Die “Achse” im Krieg: Politik, Ideologie und Kriegführung, 1939–1945 (Paderborn, 2010), 273–90, at 283Google Scholar. The evocative image of the beasts, recurrent in Balbo's unpublished notebooks, is also reminiscent of Hitler's epithet in the Anglo-Saxon world, for example in the 1939 movie “Hitler: Beast of Berlin.” This movie was produced in the USA in 1939 by Producers Distributing Corporation, telling the story of anti-Nazi activists, based on the novel Goose Step by Shepard Traube. The movie soon had to change its title to Beasts of Berlin and eventually to Hell's Devils.\n\n54 Spengler, Oswald, Man and Technics: A Contribution to a Philosophy of Life, trans. C. F. Atkinson (New York, 1932), 5–6 Google Scholar, original emphasis. See Herf, Jeffrey, Reactionary Modernism: Technology, Culture, and Politics in Weimar and the Third Reich (Cambridge and New York, 1984)Google Scholar.

Spengler's Der Mensch und die Technik was published in Germany in 1931 and translated into Italian the same year (by Corbaccio in Milan). His Jahre der Entscheidung (The Hour of Decision) was published in Germany in 1933 and in Italy in 1934 (by Bompiani in Milan). On Spengler's reception in Italy see Thöndl, Michael, Oswald Spengler in Italien (Leipzig, 2010)Google Scholar.\n\n56 Historian of science George Sarton did not know of the Einaudi translation in the making when he wrote, “It is a great pity, by the way, that this book will hardly be available in the countries where national hallucinations are cultivated with the greatest intensity, and where its reading would be most profitable.” Sarton, George, “Review of Jan Huizinga, In the Shadow of To-morrow ,” Isis, 26 (1937), 487–9, at 489CrossRefGoogle Scholar. See also Bonsaver, Guido, Censorship and Literature in Fascist Italy (Toronto, 2007), 246–7CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n58 Giovanni Invitto identifies in Balbo's philosophy a connection between his “juvenile crocianesimo and the American philosophical culture represented by J. Dewey's pragmatism.” Invitto, Le idee di Felice Balbo, 22. See also De Bartolomeis, Francesco, “L’uomo senza miti” (review), Il Ponte, 1/9 (1945), 848–50Google Scholar; Ginzburg, The Things We Used to Say, 122–4.

It is noteworthy that this passage, introduced by an asterisk, is lacking in the typewritten version of the notebook kept in the same archival box, perhaps as a sign of later disillusion.\n\n67 Ibid. Being unsuccessful in his endeavours, Bottai turned to the Italian German philosopher Ernesto Grassi, who presented Mussolini a paper in September 1941 and founded an Italian cultural institute in Berlin in December 1942.
