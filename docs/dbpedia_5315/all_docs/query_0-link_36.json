        "text": "Find high-intensity people. Give them a seat on your personal board. Choose a wonderful location. Run board meetings. Being a long-time meditator, I know the wisdom that arises from isolation and silence. Yet, there is also another type of wisdom. Equally profound. Equally unique. That is the wisdom that spills over human conversations. Unfortunately, you will not find it in random and casual conversations, exactly as you don't find the meditative wisdom in random and casual silence. You have to be intentional about it. Put energy and attention in the search of it. You have to find the right people. Create the right setting. Ask the right questions. Members of the just ended board retreat (and visiting advisors): Nicola Pivaro Virginia Gambardella Pietro Tansini Alberta Trombetta Francesco Manicardi Liliam De Luca Aurora Maggio Daniele Francescon\n\nBack in Berlin, from today to next Monday (18/03). If you want to join me for a coffee or suggest someone I should definitely meet in town, let me know."
