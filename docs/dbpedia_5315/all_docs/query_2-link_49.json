The Evaluation Committee selects the students on the basis of their curriculum of studies, a motivation letter and their proficiency in the English language.\n\nNurturing multidisciplinary and ability to learn from different fields of knowledge and cultures.\n\nAccepting complexity and combining “competing” viewpoints, “wicked” problems. Multiple partnerships favour constant creation of new viewpoints.\n\nA long term investments on a new model of teaching closer to students’ talent and inclination with a strong focus on the development of personal attitudes within four “problem-based learning” tracks:\n\nCourses on issues, models and methods of innovation, tackled with a strong interdisciplinary perspective.\n\nThe ASP educational programme consists of 30 additional credits (CFU) to be achieved in parallel to the regular 120 credits of the Laurea Magistrale programme. An ASP student achieves, at the end of her/his two years, a total amount of 150 CFU."
