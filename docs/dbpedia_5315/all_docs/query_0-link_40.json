        "text": "A Visual Sound. A journey through sound libraries LP cover design\n\nCurated by Luca Barcellona\n\nLibrary music albums are mainly unknown to the big public, but they have existed since the end of the 1930s, and in between their grooves, they hosted excellent composers and musicians; we are talking about theme music produced for TV and radio to provide all kinds of background music for various scopes - the score for a documentary, a radio drama or a commercial - without having to compose a soundtrack on purpose. Since these vinyl records were not on the market, their unavailability made them some of the most memorable collectibles. However, another feature is more obscure and exciting, and it concerns the graphics on the covers: there is no specific set of images for this kind of music, and one has to create it from scratch. In these records, the freedom of composition is unlimited, both from a musical and a graphic point of view. From the musical standpoint, only the general theme is often established from the beginning. From a graphic perspective, some series present basic graphics, where the only element changing is the title or the color; others present extremely whimsical and creative graphics to the limit of imagination. Luca Barcellona, a calligrapher and inveterate collector, selects and shows 100 of his collection's best and most representative library music covers to reveal the solid graphic and visual impact of these masterpieces.\n\nOn Thursday 23rd the exhibitions in Milano Certosa District will be open from 13.30 to 18.00\n\nIl mare artigiano\n\nCurated by Franco Achilli\n\nThe sea as a craftsman\n\nFrom the sea to Helmut Newton and back through sixteen illustrated carpets.\n\nBruno Munari wrote in The sea as a craftsman: «You throw something in the sea, and the sea (after an unknown and indeterminable time) will give it back to you carved, finished, smooth, polished or opaque, depending on the material, and also wet because the colors are more intense (...). It makes only unparalleled and unique pieces, just like artworks». Luca Barcellona, Francesca Bazzurro e Luciana Meazza, Beppe Giacobbe, Valentina Grilli, Guido Scarabottolo, Carlo Stanga, Michele Tranquillini, and Francesca Zoboli created large artworks on scraps taken from the fitted carpet used for the Helmut Newton Legacy exhibition (Palazzo Reale, Milano, 2023). The carpet was originally produced by recycling plastic pollution from the Mediterranean. From the original 1.300 square meters, 1.000 were recycled on the market, 100 were recycled and 200 were given to the artists who turned them into works of art.\n\nOn Thursday 23rd the exhibitions in Milano Certosa District will be open from 13.30 to 18.00\n\nFight for Kindness\n\nCurated by TypeCampus, Zetafonts\n\nFight for Kindness is a global initiative TypeCampus that invites designers to promote kindness-related values through typographic messages. After winning significant awards in its debut year, the project is now in its third edition, attracting the attention of the international design community. A collection of over 300 posters has been designed by well-known names in the design community, emerging talents, educators, and creators worldwide, to celebrate typography as a transformative tool for a better world. A selection of the posters has been included in the publication \"Posters for Human Kind,\" the annual edition of 2023, which features over 180 visual artists along with an introduction on the role of typographic message in contemporary society by Debora Manetti and Shrishti Vajpai, authors and curators of the project. Among the artworks authors: Tina Touli, Leonardoworx, David John Walker, Rachel Denti, Nathan Bell, Momentum Worldwide Canada, Ibrahim Zaiki, Nikolaas Kotzé, Wedzicka, and others. The works selected from the editions of Fight for Kindness are subject to a global, simultaneous, and multi-location exhibition to celebrate World Kindness Day on November 13th. The non-profit project is sponsored by the Italian type foundry Zetafonts along with prominent partners such as Type Directors Club, D&AD, ADCI, Art Directors Club of Europe (now part of The One Club), OFFF Festival, Print Mag, Slanted, Art &Found, Aiap AWDA, Typeroom, C2A, Indigo Awards, Communication Arts, DNA Paris, People of Print, and others. The new call is open. Deadline: May 31, 2024.\n\nOn Thursday 23rd the exhibitions in Milano Certosa District will be open from 13.30 to 18.00\n\nMostra Scuola del Non Sapere\n\nCurated by NABA, Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti, Ruedi Baur\n\nSchool of Non-Knowledge Exhibition Bringing together projects from thirty different universities, design schools and design groups from all over the world, the Scuola del Non Sapere exhibition at BIG, Biennale Internazionale Grafica, is a small extract from this enormous confrontation with all the things we don't know, what we don't want to know, and what we have voluntarily or involuntarily forgotten. At a time when the world's leaders continue to assert that they don't know, it's up to designers to make these uncertainties intelligible, as well as to reveal these pretenses, to represent them, to make them explicit, and to consider them as a necessary basis for any truly democratic debate, as well as for any creation. The exposition presents several of this pedagogical panels done by the students of Communication and Graphic Design Area of NABA, Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti.\n\nhttps://civic-city.org/nonsapere/\n\nCurated by the Communication and Graphic Design Area of NABA, Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti and by Ruedi & Vera Baur and Susanna Cerri, Civic-City.\n\nMiscela\n\nCurated by AWDA\n\nMiscela is the AWDA lounge in the Certosa Design District where you can freely participate in short meetings with activists, feminists, designers and planners to talk together and exchange ideas in an informal and stimulating atmosphere. Just as a blend of fine coffees creates an intense and multifaceted aroma, our Miscela meetings will mix experiences and points of view on issues of our time. The official sponsor of Miscela is MOAK, BIG's partner and renowned Italian coffee producer, which will provide AWDA with the opportunity to offer a moment of pause and recharge by tasting a premium coffee during the chats. Follow the daily programme on AWDA social media, join the Miscela and we'll buy you a coffee!\n\nFriday, May 24 at 11:00 a.m. - Meeting with AWDA 5th Participants\n\nFriday, May 24 3:00 p.m. - Meeting with Sambu Buffa - Inclusive and Plural Marketing\n\nSaturday, May 25 at 11:00 a.m. - Meeting with Giulia Bardelli - Studio ButMaybe\n\nSaturday, May 25 3:00 p.m. - Meeting with Gianluca Seta - Lanifico Leo\n\nSunday, May 26 at 11:00 a.m. - Meeting with Cláudia Alexandrino - Illustrations Ladies Milano\n\nSunday, May 26, 3:00 p.m. - Meeting with Paolo Iabichino - Iabicus\n\nLibrary Music: viaggio nella musica oscura e sconosciuta\n\nLuca Barcellona, Andrea Fabrizii\n\nLibrary Music: a journey into dark and unknown music\n\n\"Library Music\" refers to all the albums specially created for TV and the radio to synchronize and comment on documentaries, advertising, and other programs. Library Music includes all kinds of genres, from jazz to the most extreme funk, often composed by high-scale musicians under pseudonyms, an ideal terrain for unleashing the most incredible and free experimentations. Since they were not on the market, the original vinyl records from the 1970s and 1980s are now rare objects valued by collectors, reprinted and listened to by new generations. Luca Barcellona and Andrea Fabrizii, fond connoisseurs of the genre, take us to the discovery of the beautiful world of library music, which is also the main topic of the exhibition dedicated to the album covers. They will disclose the secrets and backstage of this hidden and fascinating world, following a DJ set of the best recordings from their collections. An unmissable event!\n\nPresentazione del libro Incontri di Armando Milani per Lazy Dog Press\n\nFrancesco Ceccarelli, Armando Milani\n\nPresentation of the book \"Incontri\" by Armando Milani for Lazy Dog Press.\n\nThe biography of Armando Milani, the world-famous designer, is outlined through anecdotes and images of a hundred fortuitous and unexpected yet wanted and desired encounters that most influenced his work and inspired his creative choices. On the side of each encounter’s story, we find a picture or an artwork related to the character that is in perfect harmony with the expressive style of Milani: to communicate an immediate message, enchanting the eye to reach the heart. Vico Magistretti’s clothespin, Jack Nicholson’s cherries, Paul McCartney’s Happy New Year on the beach, Pelè’s goals, Muhammad Ali’s handshake, Alberto Sordi’s markets, Umberto Eco’s drunken sailors. Milani dancing with Mariangela Melato, and his wife waltzing with Saul Steinberg. There emerges a mosaic scattered with stories that allow us to reach the deep end of Armando Milani’s biography and his message to us, identified by the founding features of his expressive research: at the base of these encounters, one can find ethics, friendship, the desire and necessity to communicate. It is one of the reasons why his graphic sign is so special. It reaches the essence of things, becoming everlasting and timeless.\n\nFontstand - Tin Building\n\nMatteo Bologna\n\nBranding a food hall with 14 food venues, 400+ products, and a Market and Grocery by using just one font and not making it boring. A single font can have incredible brand-building potential, especially when pushed to its limit. There’s no more perfect example of this than within the Tin Building, Michelin-award-winning chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s new marketplace at the former site of NYC’s historic Fulton Fish Market, featuring 14 food venues with restaurants and two grocery stores and locally sourced meats, cheeses, seafood, and grocery items. The varied branding and designs deceptively feature one font throughout the sprawling facility, representing a wide range of voices, cultures, tones, and uses – exemplifying how each font has limitless applications that can help create entire worlds. Hosted by Mucca’s founder Matteo Bologna, this talk will focus on the creation of Tin Building’s No Exit Octagonal (a custom typeface inspired by past Fulton Fish Market vendors) and its broad and varied use across the brand and sub-brands (from signage to digital to packaging and more), showing the power and flexibility of building a brand on a foundation of a single typeface.\n\nLibri dentro come fuori\n\nSilvana Amato\n\nBooks inside as outside\n\nBooks inside as outside is an exhibition itinerary that highlights how book design begins and develops, which in the specific case of Silvana Amato, centers on a creative process that combines ideas and materiality on the same level, thus recovering a principle of refined craftsmanship alongside constant cultural research. A design that is attentive to the specific situation and creates little, great, fantastic works of remarkable poetry and sensitivity. In the exhibition, about fifty prints of covers of the book series she edited for various publishing houses or cultural institutions (Laterza, 66thand2nd, Nuova consonanza, and so on) are accompanied by the corresponding visual captions describing them from the graphic design viewpoint. Also on display are other publishing projects in which the potential of experimentation around the form of writing is expressed, objects that offer an all-around look at the designer's always curious and careful graphic research.\n\nThe exhibition will be open until May 30.\n\nIl Cava - Antropologia di un personaggio\n\nCurated by Anna Dusi\n\nIl Cava - Anthropology of a character\n\nStarting from the importance of valorizing a reality comparable to that of an archive or a museum collection, I have reflected on how I would like to create a conversation carried forward by a unique character who embodies multiple creative forms: \"Osvaldo Cavandoli\". Deliberately setting aside the inevitable temptations of 'nostalgic suggestion', the purpose of this event is to explore Osvaldo's work, an inexhaustible resource and a stimulus for the new generations of image creators, a source of inspiration especially for his masterful invention of the character La Linea, a naive and irascible creature that has effectively become a figure of the collective imagination. The exhibition aims not only to recognize the life and history of one of the great \"Artisans\" of the Italian artistic and cultural tradition but also, and above all, to witness Osvaldo's transition from the careful and patient technical and stylistic arrangements of the Pupilandia experience to that perfect combination of picto-phonetic-kinetic energy that will embody one of the most iconic, universal, and popular characters in the global graphic universe: La Linea. The exhibition aims to be a journey of knowledge and reflection. Eminent historians and scholars of animation unanimously attribute to Osvaldo Cavandoli's work a crucial importance for the evolution of this particular language: among them, Professor Giannalberto Bendazzi, who was also a dear friend of the artist and a witness to some phases of his creative process, and who was among the first to highlight how the character of La Linea, in its modernity, subliminally referred to the very origins of Animation, including the love/hate relationship with the demiurgic Hand that gives it life. In addition to giving continuity to the knowledge of Osvaldo's work, I have had the opportunity to undertake a transformational research process on an interpretive process that will induce the viewer to observe another aspect of this story, namely La Linea che takes on a human form through a performative act. «I don't know what eternity is, if one can leave a lasting impression forever, but I know that works endure far beyond the abandonment of their creators. Honoring such works that have been 'orphaned' of their fathers is a way to prolong their lives through present and future generations. Osvaldo Cavandoli had an idea, which we can certainly define as brilliant in its apparent simplicity and in the universal ability to synthesize within itself something that we all feel intangibly, but struggle to see outside of ourselves in the concrete everyday». He managed to tell a story that we experience intimately within ourselves, in that place where there are no words - or perhaps, only the equally brilliant Grammelot of Carlo Bonomi, the only possible voice of La Linea - but intertwined emotions.\n\nThe exhibition will be open until June 13.\n\nPresentazione di Segni Migranti di Mario Cresci\n\nMario Cresci, Aldo Colonetti\n\nPresentation of the book \"Segni Migranti\" by Mario Cresci\n\n«The book in front of you and that I have browsed through several times, I believe, should be read as a system of associations proposed by the author and to be discovered slowly; just like in the book, instead of proposing a historical survey and analyzing Cresci's research in chronological order, a branched, articulated path is proposed, dense with parentheses and internal connections, associations of images and patterns for reading the real». (A.C. Quintavalle) Segni migranti is the graphic trace of the sign/drawing, which coexists with the historical reality of the human condition and that of the contemporary migrant. Leaving the Sign indicates the power of a compelling and robust action and idea. Mario Cresci's book contains stories in the form of signifying signs and presents itself as an archive of personal and collective images - these images are a litmus test, intended as a mirror reflecting the searches for meaning that follow the times and lived experiences in individual social contexts, within the community, and within things.\n\nPresentazione di Il Filo Nascosto. Gli abiti come parole del nostro discorso col mondo di Emanuela Mancino\n\nEmanuela Mancino\n\nPresentation of the book \"Il Filo Nascosto. Gli abiti come parole del nostro discorso col mondo\" by Emanuela Mancino\n\nThere is a profound relationship between dress, body, and memory. This connection is intertwined with the gesture of inhabiting the space, leaving marks, writing and communicating, saying and disappearing, and keeping silent. Dress is a transversal, tellable trace to which to leave the word and to which offer poetic words. The text, running along the hidden thread of everyday poetics, reconnects the deep linguistic signs of things to a sensitive and shareable phenomenology of dress as a practice of inhabiting and dressing with the intimate value of being in the world. The hidden thread that binds us to the earth, to our ties, allows us to explain and confirm a practice of reflection aimed at taking place within the concept and the forms of the weft, which becomes an experience of learning, aesthetic expression, but above all a possibility of vision and re-signification. The hidden thread among the clothes leads us through plots of thought and experience of a pedagogical territory possessing a vocation to the hem, the possibility of giving a voice, a home, and a body to an invisible yet sensitive (and educable) \"sense of making sense\". Seemingly mute, the fabrics of our dressing and undressing, the clothes and habits of our thoughts and emotions reveal, to a poetic and narrative listening, the boundless memorial, design, and relational value of materiality and pedagogical immateriality. The book speaks to those interested in giving sensitive words to the visible and the invisible pedagogical. It allows those who want to listen to the voice of things to experience, through threads, wefts, and knots, all the material consistency of making, the craftsmanship of a pedagogical-reflexive operativity that gives substance to a philosophy of education as a thoughtful life practice.\n\nManifesti Poetici\n\nMoreno Gentili\n\nThursday 23 | 15.00 — 20.00\n\nFriday 24 | 10.00 — 20.00\n\nSaturday 25 | 14.00 — 20.00\n\nSunday 26 | 10.00 — 18.00\n\nManifesti Poetici (Poetic posters) are a model of shared communication that the author, Moreno Gentili, invented more than two decades ago and that, over time, developed into an organic series of germinative works in continuous becoming, starting from that first unique gesture/action of making the word a form; a concatenation of words and short phrases, ringed in a single hyperbolic anaphora starting from a generating code, such as: «Ti amo», «Bevo vivere», or from an imperative: «Piantala», «Semina», «Servila», but also from adverbs of affirmation, such as: «sì», «no», repeated 365 times. If artwork is a synthesis, this project is a path of research and maturation that houses and provokes change in creative modes and their implementation. Poetic posters are a work/project that lives on the encounters with people who discover the project itself, buy the poster, and continue the dialogue with the artist and his words. The Manifesti Poetici have been exhibited over the years in various places in the city, from Café Cucchi to Teatro Franco Parenti. These are public spaces of sharing and exchange that align with the author's beloved formula of art as civil emotion, outside of any institutional path and close to people's lives.\"\n\nType Design for Non-Type Designers\n\nMatteo Bologna, Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer\n\nIn this two-day class, you will learn the basics of designing and generating a variable font with the font-design software Glyphs (Mac only). Go beyond choosing the same typefaces from the type menu to creating your own! On the first day, we will learn the basics of drawing a font, generate the font, and use it in an Adobe app or a web browser. In the afternoon, we will add additional letters to the font, learning how to space them, add diacritics and punctuation. (You can purchase a one-day ticket for this day only). On the second day, we will add more letters, design a bold version of the same typeface, create a variable font—and make it animate in a web browser. At the end of the class, you will probably not have a finished font, but a respectable start and a deep understanding about how fonts are made. And maybe you’ll become a type design addict. You have been warned.\n\nMay 23 | Room C0.4 from 9.00 to 12.30 / room A0.3 from 14.00 to 17.00\n\nMay 24 | Room T.1.1 from 9.00 to 17.00\n\nL'uomo scatola\n\nMaura Cantamessa, Cristian Boffelli\n\nThe Box Man\n\nThursday 23 | 15.00 — 20.00\n\nFriday 24 | 10.00 — 20.00\n\nSaturday 25 | 14.00 — 20.00\n\nSunday 26 | 10.00 — 18.00\n\nThe artist's book is loosely based on Kōbō Abe's The Box Man, in Antonietta Pastore's translation (Einaudi, 1992); it contains ten engravings by Cristian Boffelli and Maura Cantamessa and opens with a short text by the translator (Bergamo and Tokyo, 2019-2023). Boffelli and Cantamessa are Italian artists, friends who have been engravers for many years, who bring to life their passion for Japanese culture and art printing by confronting the words of Kōbō Abe and his novel The Box Man. The mysterious simplicity of the text's progression brings to life, inside a box, the shyness of a man hidden from the world and curious about the world. The chosen language is that of art prints: xylography, chalcography, and silkscreen prints paired with or superimposed on the author's words in Italian and Japanese in search of a new, different image able to express the poetry of the three authors in dialogue with each other. Leafing through the artist's book, which is collected in a box, unbound, one creates a reading rhythm made up of solids, voids, words, dark spots, and colored traces in an attempt to bring back the poetry of being human, its profound beauty. The exhibition presents matrices and prints in dialogue with each other and the written text. The printed sheets hanging on the wall refer to the lightness of the pages while also adapting to the context in which they are displayed.\n\nIl Filo Rosso\n\nElvis Crotti, Giuseppe Schirone and PxC\n\nThe Red String\n\nTalk/workshop and presentation of the Orme Timide series for PxC. Those who design in PxC have a passion for manual skills and if they think of a book, in addition to designing its typography as a \"crystal goblet\", they ask themselves what paper I will choose, how I will cut it, how I will fold it, how I will sew it. This workshop will go through the times and ways of creating a book; from the design to the composition to the final binding. The Orme Timide series aims to create and promote a series of artists' books where the written word, the prose story or the poetic composition are the narrative focus that will be renewed with each new publication. Words and images (photographs, collages, silkscreen illustrations) will merge into the flow of the story. Each individual book project will develop and enhance this bond by using different formats, materials and types of binding, making the analogue and digital worlds coexist without constraints. Orme Timide has published three limited/numbered edition artist's books in batches of 50 copies each.\n\nVIAPADOVAMONDO\n\nT12-Lab\n\nThe Tunnel Boulevard Project promotes the VIAPADOVAMONDO call for ideas together with the Ufficio Arte negli Spazi Pubblici of Comune di Milano and in collaboration with Municipio 2. It invites artists and graphic designers working in public art to create a poster art project in Via Padova in Milan. The VIAPADOVAMONDO call for ideas will bring the winners of the contest to work with a group, an ethnic group, or a community that is part of the neighborhood and involve it in the process of creating the work. It will emphasize the aspects of inclusion, cultural identity, and multiculturalism of Via Padova through the creation of a participatory work open to the citizens and made with the technique of poster art. The work’s background will be the walls of the pedestrian passages of the Via Padova railway tunnel; it will run along the two thirty-five-meter-long sides of the tunnel - in both directions of travel. The Via Padova tunnel is part of the project for the recovery of public spaces called Tunnel Boulevard, led by the Associazione T12 Lab. Tunnel Boulevard aims to give the five railway tunnels of Via Pontano back to the citizens by recovering them from degradation and renewing their use through projects that enhance the spaces of the railway artifacts with cultural, artistic, and sports activities, strictly public and free of charge."
