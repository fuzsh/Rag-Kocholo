        "text": "2020 undoubtedly has become the year that many of us would rather not have to live through again and while next year isn't going to get off to a great start, at least we can say that we watched a lot more television than usual, right?\n\nUK soaps really did have to combat the restrictions of COVID like no other genre and were some of the first shows to resume filming after the first lockdown. The likes of Hollyoaks, Coronation Street and EastEnders all celebrated anniversaries specials while Emmerdale managed several lockdown themed episodes amongst some of the more divisive stories they've had this year. None of the soaps outmatched each other and all seemed to be on the same wavelength of some good stories and some rather poorly thought out ones to boot.\n\nReality TV - well, we did endure one more series of Love Island before first lockdown but were spared the summer series but it didn't stop the likes of I'm A Celebrity, Strictly Come Dancing, Great British Bake Off and The Masked Singer all from happening nonetheless.\n\nI didn't watch a lot of UK TV dramas this year. In fact, if I'm being perfectly honest, the only few shows actually bothered to watch were of course the twelfth series of Doctor Who, which definitely had it's moments, but the less about the Timeless Children arc, the better. Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss's take on Dracula, which despite a disappointing third episode, at least saw some excellent performances from both Claes Bang and Dolly Wells, so that was something.\n\nThe only UK TV drama that actually gripped me was I Hate Suzie with Billie Piper seemingly playing a character that heavily drew from some of her own personal life. It was a sublime performance and a further reminder how extremely talented an actor Piper is. Similarly David Tennant managed to impress with both Staged (featuring Michael Sheen and their real life wives) and the chilling Des, one of the few bright spots from ITV this year.\n\nUS television was once again dominated by cable and streaming shows coming hard and fast and with far too many to catch up on. HBO probably scored with the likes of The Undoing and the Christmas special of Euphoria, the latter likely to bag Zendeya another Emmy nomination/win while some of Netflix's most talked about shows included the likes of The Queen's Gambit, The Crown and quite recently as last week, Bridgerton. HBO Max has not quite hit anywhere close to the levels of other streaming platforms and it might be a while before it does but The Flight Attendant was a highlight and some of their upcoming content for the next two years certainly looks promising.\n\nI'm not much of a sitcom person but this year saw the end of Schitt's Creek and in my case, the discovery of it, if I'm being candid. I've blitzed through the first two seasons over the last few weeks and will be watching the remaining seasons as well as needing to catch up with the remainder of The Good Place - another show that's fallen victim of E4's terrible scheduling. Still though, both are shows I will likely finish up in the first quarter of next year and seeing as they've both ended this year, at least I know how much I need to catch up on.\n\nThis was also the year of some shows coming to an end as well. How To Get Away With Murder might have lost a large portion of it's initial audience as it went on, but it actually had a rather strong last season and it's series finale was a good way to bring Annalise Keating's story to a natural conclusion. Empire also seemed to end with little fanfare while both Arrow and Supernatural's endings certainly seemed to mix viewers.\n\nWith the likes of American Horror Story, American Crime Story and Pose all having to sit out 2020, you'd be mistaken in thinking that the only Ryan Murphy content you got this year was both 911 shows on FOX but Netflix had you covered. Out of the shows on the streaming site - The Politician and Ratched were entertaining but lacking in parts while Hollywood indulged in fantasy retelling of 1940's Tinseltown and was probably the strongest of the bunch. Of course I'm glad Murphy's FX shows will return in 2021, hopefully refreshed and I'm intrigued by at least two of his other upcoming Netflix offerings as well.\n\n2020 wasn't much for Marvel content as none of the promised Disney+ shows were completed in time, so it was the last season of Agents Of SHIELD and the rather short lived Helstrom to barely fill that void. DC on the other hand came out swinging with Stargirl and hopefully the show's permanent move to the CW won't affect it's quality. Meanwhile Batwoman lost it's title character, both The Flash and Supergirl lost the plot at times, Legends Of Tomorrow embraced the Thong Song, Black Lightning prepped for a final season for next year and Arrow ended this year on a strong note. Doom Patrol kicked off an impressive second season, Lucifer continued to expand it's lifeline on Netflix and Harley Quinn did the very thing the comics cannot commit to by actually making Harley and Ivy a bonafide couple. With a slew of upcoming shows for HBO Max and Superman And Lois for the CW, TV and streaming will continue to be the most successful area for DC content.\n\n2020 was also the year where The Boys seemed to properly blow up, It felt like from September onwards, the show was unavoidable so I bit the bullet, watched the first two seasons and yeah, I can see the fuss behind this one. The second season was certainly the strongest with Stormfront being one of the more abhorrent villains seen on TV/streaming this year. The Umbrella Academy also had a particular strong second outing, making great use of the main characters 1960's setting and the game changing cliffhanger should be interesting to see explored next season.\n\nGenre TV wise, the second season of The Mandalorian seemed to be fan pleasing event from start to finish with many Star Wars shows guaranteed by Disney+. HBO and HBO Max also delivered with the likes of Westworld, Lovecraft Country and Raised By Wolves. Netflix might be ending Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina but it's last season certainly is a good way to conclude the year for the station while His Dark Materials continued to perform well for BBC.\n\nIn terms of LGBT TV, there was a lot of it this year. More than I could possibly highlight but if I had to pick a few underrated gems, I'd go with Spanish Netflix miniseries, Someone Has To Die, starring Alejandro Speitzer as well as Hulu series, Love Victor, the spin-off a certain 2018 movie. A lovely feelgood series with a great central performance from Michael Cimino, it was a highlight in a year that personally didn't have that many.\n\n2020 was certainly a year for television and streaming content. There's probably some things I've forgotten or simply did not watch but those were some of the highlights for me. What were yours? Is there any upcoming show you're looking forward to in 2021?\n\nMy last TV jumble blog for this year (though not my last blog, lol) and while I didn't watch a lot over the Christmas period, here's a few things I did finish up on.\n\nA Recipe For Seduction: Without a doubt the strangest thing I have ever watched in my life and if there wasn't proof enough that 2020 really was that off a year, this 15 minute telemovie in which Mario Lopez played a silver fox version of the infamous KFC creator really drove that point home. With some hammy as hell acting, a gay supporting character and a soap opera romance along with a scheming love rival and even more scheming mother, this was pure daft but surprisingly entertaining. Sequel for next Christmas, yeah?\n\nSchitt's Creek: Okay, so I watched all of Season 2 in the space of a few days (took a break for Christmas though) and yes, I get the buzz for this show now. The second season only built on the premise of the first season with Moira running for Mayor and not being shy in being underhanded, Johnny standing up for Roland and the town in a lovely scene during the finale, Alexis dumping Ted, getting with Mutt, losing Mutt and then working for Ted while David's adventures working for Wendy, making an old family recipe with Moira and the fun rivalry with Stevie and the addition of Jake. I'm totally sold on this show and will get through the remaining four seasons.\n\nThe Boys: Season 2 continued on a very strong streak of episodes. While Billy has been one of the worst characters for me, I did like learning more about his family and by the finale, he probably did the right in relation to Ryan. The downfalls for both Stormfront and Homelander were glorious to watch, though I suspect both will come back with a vengeance next season. I loved the 'girls get it done' montage, the use of Lamplighter and even the arrival of Victoria hints at some interesting stuff for the next season.\n\nThe Flight Attendant: HBO Max has undeniably gotten off to something of a shaky start but over the last few weeks, things have been looking up for the new streaming app. One of those things was this particular show and while it originally seemed like it was meant to be a miniseries, it's breakaway success has gotten it a second season. As for the episodes itself, the second half of the season upped the ante with Kaley Cuoco giving a sublime performance as Cassie while Alex's death was solved, Buckley turned out to be more dangerous than expected while Miranda proved to be a handy ally to have and even Shane surprised in the finale. Annie and Max proved to be great supporting character, Megan not so much but I'm hoping we see more of Davey next season.\n\nMatt Smith has bagged a leading role in the upcoming House Of The Dragon series. The show will begin filming next year but will not debut on HBO Max until 2022.\n\nCobra Kai will debut it's third season on Netflix a week earlier. It'll now be released on New Year's Day.\n\nExpect to see two certain characters from Sabrina The Teenage Witch in the final season of Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina, which streams New Year's Eve on Netflix.\n\nHBO and BBC have renewed His Dark Materials for a third and final season.\n\nThe Mandalorian has been renewed for a third season but will possibly debut in 2022. Expect several more Star Wars properties on Disney+ over the next several years.\n\nBBC will be airing A Teacher next month over the course of five nights and in double bills.\n\nHBO Max are going to revive Sex And The City for a limited series, but it will likely not feature Kim Cattrall.\n\nThe upcoming Clarice series, set to debut in February on CBS All Access will not be able to mention Hannibal Lector nor feature the character.\n\nA drama inspired by Nyle DiMarco's life called Look At Me is in development for NBC.\n\nUK viewers can see the Stephen King miniseries The Stand on StarzPlayer from next month.\n\nI think what I'm gonna post here will be less of a shocker and more of an inevitability. Also don't be surprised if this blog is edited in the next week or so when more information surfaces.\n\nIt's safe to say that in the space of four years and several appearances in the MCU that Tom Holland has made the role of Spider Man his own and with his first two solo outings being overall crowd pleasers, it's probably the right time for his third outing, currently filming in Atlanta to really up the ante. Basically, it's time for the multiverse.\n\nRumours have been spilling for a while that Holland's upcoming third movie would delve into it's own Spider Verse and this week, that was probably confirmed. It seems that both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield will be joining Tom Holland for the upcoming movie but they won't be alone. Nope, along with two other Spidermen, it's also been confirmed that Kirsten Dunst and Emma Stone will be reprising their roles as Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacey respectively.\n\nThe returns of Maguire, Garfield, Dunst and Stone come after it was also revealed that Jamie Foxx and Alfred Molina would also be reprising their roles as Electro and Doc Octopus respectively. It seems that this current movie might not only be exploring the multiverse (along with WandaVision and the upcoming Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness) but rumours are rife that this movie may also be giving Spidey fans the Sinister Six as several other villains (yet to be confirmed) will factor into the film.\n\nOther confirmed returns (as well as Holland's own cast, including Zendeya as MJ) are Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange along with Charlie Cox's Daredevil. The latter's return has especially generated excitement as many were disappointed when Netflix cancelled his show back in 2018. In the film though it seems like Cox's Matt Murdock will be representing Peter Parker in court but I don't doubt we'll get to see him briefly as Daredevil in the movie. There's also been rumours of Deadpool showing up but that hasn't been confirmed yet. Either way, this is exciting stuff.\n\nPress release: https://news.sky.com/story/spider-man-3-tobey-maguire-and-andrew-garfield-to-reprise-web-slinging-roles-alongside-tom-holland-reports-12156004\n\nThe yet to be titled third Spider Man film is currently in production in Atlanta with a scheduled release for December 17th 2021.\n\nI was going to wait a little bit longer to do this one but with so much news coming out over the last few weeks in relation to DC TV and streaming content, I thought I might as well do a blog right now. Warning this may be edited tomorrow when other stuff emerges later today.\n\nWith DCFanDome disappointingly didn't give us a first look as to what Javicia Leslie's Ryan Wilder would look like as Batwoman, last month a nice series of photos emerged to unveil the new look that Ryan would have and if you spotted some set pics, it also looks like Ryan will have a Batmobile of her own as well. I like the bigger emphasis on red with the gauntlets and the cape compared to Kate Kane's look in the first season and the choice of wig works pretty well to boot. Viewers won't have much longer to wait as the show returns to the CW from January 17th with a brief trailer giving us a tiny glimpse of Ryan in action.\n\nFirst Season 2 Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5__G4rXil8\n\nWith the third season in production (and rumours of a fourth season also in the works), HBO Max didn't waste too much time in unveiling Curran Walters new look for Jason Tood as the Red Hood will be coming to Titans in quite a big way. The character will not only serve as the main antagonist for the first half of the season but Red Hood is also poised to get his own spin-off while Blackfire (Damaris Lewis) will serve as a main villain for the second half of the forthcoming season. Castings for new characters such as Barbara Gordon, Tim Drake and Scarecrow have yet to be confirmed but you can expect some new looks for Beast Boy (Ryan Potter) and Starfire (Anna Diop) as well as a more focused team when the show does return in 2021.\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, the pace for Peacemaker has seriously picked up, almost out of nowhere. Filming for the eight part spin-off of The Suicide Squad is set to start in January 2021 and the main cast will not only see John Cena reprise the role of the titular character but he'll be joined by his movie co-stars Jennifer Holland and Steve Agee, also reprising their roles as Dr Emilia Harcourt and John Economos respectively. Also joining the cast will be Chris Conrad as Adrian Chase/Vigilante, Danielle Brooks as Leota Adebayo and Robert Patrick as Auggie Smith. James Gunn has written all eight episodes for the upcoming HBO Max series and will direct some of them as well.\n\nMeanwhile for those of you wondering if the CW were going to pick any more DC content, well you're in luck (depending on your standpoint with CW DC content) as there seems to be plans afoot for a Black Lightning spin-off, focusing on the character Painkiller ( Jordan Calloway) with a backdoor pilot being filmed as part of the main series upcoming fourth season. I stopped watching this show after it's first season, so this news slightly threw me off. I'm not against the character getting a spin off and I might watch the pilot episode out of curiosity, but don't expect much or any coverage on here. Black Lightning's fourth season will premiere on the CW from February 8th 2021. It also has been confirmed that this will be the show's final season as well.\n\nIf Painkiller getting his own series wasn't surprising, how about the CW giving a series to a character who has yet to make her debut in the comics? For a while there's been a lot of hype for Brazilian Wonder Woman, Yara Flor (created by Joelle Jones) in the upcoming Future State event series (January/February 2021) and the CW have decided to quickly get in there by commissioning Wonder Girl, which will focus on Yara Flor and will be done from Queen of the South executive producer/co-showrunner Dailyn Rodriguez and Berlanti Productions.\n\nThe synopsis for the upcoming series ....\n\nWritten by Rodriguez, Wonder Girl centers on Yara Flor, a Latina Dreamer who was born of an Amazonian Warrior and a Brazilian River God, learns that she is Wonder Girl. With her newfound power must fight the evil forces that would seek to destroy the world.\n\nThis is showing a lot of confidence for a character who DC readers have yet to meet and while it's potentially risky, I have to commend the CW for taking the risk though. It'll be interesting to see the casting for this upcoming series but with both this and Painkiller getting potential shows, I have a feeling that Supergirl might not be the only CW DC show we lose in 2021.\n\nWonder Girl Press Release: https://deadline.com/2020/11/wonder-girl-tv-series-latina-lead-yara-flor-dailyn-rodriguez-greg-berlanti-productions-the-cw-1234616503/\n\nMeanwhile November 17th came and went and Zack Snyder held a breakdown of the trailer for fans on his Vero account for Zack Snyder's Justice League. The trailer was uploaded again with a few new scenes in black and white but we're still no closer to a confirmed date for the upcoming miniseries. It was confirmed a few weeks ago that Jared Leto will reprise his role as the Joker for the new cut. I'll provide a link for the new cut of the trailer below.\n\nZSJL Trailer (B&W): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3OyBdkrDTk\n\nThat's a rundown of some of the upcoming DC shows that both the CW and HBO Max will be producing over the next year. There's more info to come, especially regarding a certain Cut and a bunch of Green Lanterns."
