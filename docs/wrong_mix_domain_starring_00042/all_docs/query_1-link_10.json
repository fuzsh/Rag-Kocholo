        "text": "Fun fact: Griffith was 30 when she was cast in the role — the same age as her character (Tess celebrates her 30th birthday at the start of the movie). We find out later that Sigourney Weaver's character is meant to be the same age as Tess — when, in reality, Weaver was one year off celebrating her 40th birthday when the movie came out.\n\nExtra fun fact: The role of Tess was played by an unknown named Sandra Bullock in a short-lived 1990 TV spin-off of Working Girl.\n\nFun fact: Ford famously has a scar on his chin from a car accident back in his early twenties. In Working Girl, the scar is worked into the plot: His character, Jack, tells Tess a story about how an ex-girlfriend once tried to pierce his ear, causing him to faint and cut his chin on a toilet bowl.\n\nFun fact: Weaver won a Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actress for this role, and was nominated for an Oscar in the same category (alongside Working Girl castmate Joan Cusack). That same year, she also landed a Best Actress nod for Gorillas In The Mist. But Geena Davis and Jodie Foster won those respective categories on the night in 1989 — meaning Weaver became the first actor to be nominated for two Oscars on the one night, only to lose them both.\n\nFun fact: Working Girl director Mike Nichols had cast Spacey as Christopher Walken's understudy in a Broadway play in the mid-'80s, which led to Spacey landing his brief role as the sleazy \"Bob from Arbitrage\". Years later, at an American Film Institute tribute to Nichols, Spacey impersonated Walken as he gave thanks to the director. Spacey is still wheeling out that impersonation to this day."
