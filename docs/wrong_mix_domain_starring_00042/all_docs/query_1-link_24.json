        "text": "The first Top 13 list I did for this blog was actually about my favorite animated Disney Canon films. It was one of my most popular posts, if not my most popular post on this blog! However, that was 11 years ago and with all the films added to the Canon since then, I feel it’s time for a new list!\n\nSo sit back and relax for my updated Top 13 Favorite Animated Disney (Canon) Films list!\n\nContinue reading “My Top 13 Favorite Animated Disney (Canon) Films (May 2024 Edition)!”\n\nWell, the 95th Academy Awards have ended and this time I didn’t get to watch it. That was probably for the best because surprisingly, I did the absolute worst in my predictions this year than I’ve ever done in my life: 8/23!!!\n\nThe Academy made a lot of surprising choices which I loved (such as Naatu Naatu winning Best Original Song and Brendan Fraser winning Best Actor), but I didn’t expect them to make those choices. Oh well, nowhere to go but up, I guess?\n\nIn terms of animation, Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio won Best Animated Feature and The Boy, the Mole, the Fox, and the Horse won Best Animated Short.\n\nFor a list of the other winners, click here.\n\nIt’s that time of year again: Oscars time! Jimmy Kimmel will be hosting the ceremony for the third time. Not to mention that this will be the first ceremony post-Will Smith slap!\n\nAnyway, it’s time for my predictions for the 95th Academy Awards! The ones that I think SHOULD win will be in RED, the ones that I think WILL win will be in BLUE, and if they’re both the same, they will be both RED AND BLUE. I have left my picks for Best Animated Feature, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Picture for the end.\n\nLet me know your thoughts!\n\nContinue reading “My 95th Academy Awards Predictions!”\n\nAs everyone knows, Disney has recently been involved in a policy where they are making live-action remakes of their animated films. They’ve released Alice in Wonderland, Maleficent, and Cinderella. Each of them have been HUGE financial successes!\n\nNow, there are 8 more live-action remakes in the production: Alice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass, The Jungle Book, Beauty and the Beast, Dumbo, Winnie the Pooh, Mulan, Cruella, and Pinocchio.\n\nI, for one, am so sick and tired of this trend! I really disliked Alice in Wonderland and Maleficent! (I haven’t seen Cinderella yet.) And I think Dumbo and Winnie the Pooh are just stupid and/or bizarre ideas to make into live-action remakes!\n\nI personally just want Disney to leave their animated classics alone and work on more original ideas. But, I’d like to know what you all think. So please tell me in the comments how you feel about this recent Disney trend.\n\nWell, 2013 is about to come to an end, so you know what that means!\n\nNo, it means that I’m going on vacation!\n\nYep, I’m gonna be gone for about a week, so I thought that I should leave you all with something before I go. And what better thing to leave you with than a preview of what next year has to offer in animated films!\n\nSo sit back and relax while we take a look at the animated full-length theatrical films that shall be released next year complete with synopses (if available), trailers/posters (if available), and American release dates (if available). I hope you all enjoy! Continue reading “Upcoming Animated Films in 2014”\n\nWell folks, it’s about time that I open up my latest section of this blog: my “Top 13” Lists! Face it, we all love lists and love reading other people’s opinions, and I’m no exception. So I thought to myself that I should start making a few lists and hopefully some people would be interested in reading them!\n\nSo I went ahead and decided my first list to be, “My Top 13 Favorite Animated Disney (Canon) Films”! It seemed an appropriate list to start with seeing as I’m already doing a project involving the Disney Canon. Maybe some of you were curious as to which films are my personal favorite?\n\nAfter looking through the list of the Disney Canon films and after much painstaking editing and re-arranging (I never realized how hard ranking things can be! To those of you who make lists often, I tip my hat to you!),\n\nI’m ready to share the results with you all!\n\nNote: I personally find one’s favorites and preferences can vary over time, minutely, if not majorly! So keep in mind that as of January 2013, this is my list! Maybe when I look back at this list in the future, I’ll wonder why my #6 film was not #12? Or why my #10 film was not my #3? Or why my #7 film was even on the list to begin with?\n\nAlso, I have not seen “Wreck-It Ralph” yet, but I have seen all the other films in the Disney Canon! Hopefully, I don’t love “Wreck-It Ralph” so much that it affects my top 13! Oh, you’re probably wondering to yourself, “Why top 13?” Well, it’s because I’m not superstitious!\n\nWith that said, sit back and enjoy my top 13 favorite animated Disney (Canon) films!
