He also wrote the miniseries: The Andromeda Strain, Crazy Horse, and Spartacus. He is a member of the Dramatists Guild, Ensemble Studio Theater and an alumnus of New Dramatists.\n\nBill Rauch is the Artistic Director of Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Having spent eleven seasons as director, he has directed three world premieres: Mr. Schenkkan’s All the Way and By the Waters of Babylon, and Bill Cain’s Equivocation; and thirteen other plays including Medea/Macbeth/Cinderella, Measure for Measure, The Pirates of Penzance, Hamlet, The Merchant of Venice, The Music Man, Romeo and Juliet, The Two Gentlemen of Verona, The Comedy of Errors, Hedda Gabler, and Handler. Among his initiatives at OSF, Mr. Rauch committed to commissioning up to 37 new plays to dramatize moments of change in American history. American Revolutions: the U.S. History Cycle is now in its fourth year of productions. Mr. Rauch is also cofounder of Cornerstone Theater Company, where he directed more than 40 productions and served as its artistic director from 1986 to 2006. He has directed a number of world premieres, including The Clean House at Yale Repertory Theatre; Living Out and For Here or To Go? at the Mark Taper Forum; and My Wandering Boy and The Further Adventures of Hedda Gabler at South Coast Repertory. He also directed the New York premiere of The Clean House at the Lincoln Center. Work elsewhere includes productions at South Coast Repertory, Guthrie Theater, Arena Stage, Long Wharf Theatre, Pasadena Playhouse, Great Lakes Theater Festival and En Garde Arts. He is the recipient of numerous awards, and is a graduate of Harvard College.\n\nThe American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) at Harvard University is dedicated to expanding the boundaries of theater. Winner of the 2012 and 2013 Tony Awards for Best Musical Revival for its productions of The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess and Pippin, the A.R.T. is a leading force in the American theater, producing groundbreaking work in Cambridge and beyond. The A.R.T. was founded in 1980 by Robert Brustein, who served as Artistic Director until 2002, when he was succeeded by Robert Woodruff. In 2008, Diane Paulus became the A.R.T.’s Artistic Director. The A.R.T. is the recipient of numerous other awards including the Tony Award for Outstanding Regional Theater, the Pulitzer Prize, and many Elliot Norton and I.R.N.E. Awards. Its recent premiere production of Death and The Powers: The Robots’ Opera was a 2012 Pulitzer Prize finalist. During its 33-year history, the A.R.T. has welcomed many major American and international theater artists, presenting a diverse repertoire that includes premieres of American plays, bold reinterpretations of classical texts and provocative new music theater productions. The A.R.T. has performed throughout the U.S. and worldwide in 21 cities in 16 countries on four continents. In association with the renowned Moscow Art Theatre School, the A.R.T. is also a training ground for young artists. The Theater’s artistic staff teaches undergraduate classes in acting, directing, dramatic literature, dramaturgy, voice, and design at Harvard University, providing world-class professional training. Since becoming Artistic Director, Tony Award-winning director Diane Paulus has enhanced the A.R.T.’s core mission to expand the boundaries of theater by continuing to transform the ways in which work is developed, programmed, produced and contextualized, always including the audience as a partner. Productions such as Pippin, The Glass Menagerie, The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess, Sleep No More, The Donkey Show, Gatz, The Blue Flower, and Prometheus Bound have engaged audiences in unique theatrical experiences. The A.R.T.’s club theater, OBERON, which Paulus calls a second stage for the 21st century, has become an incubator for local and emerging artists, and has also attracted national attention for its innovative programming model.\n\nEstablished in 1935, the Tony Award-winning Oregon Shakespeare Festival is among the oldest and largest professional regional theatres in the country. Located in Ashland, Oregon, OSF is a cultural and recreational destination for more than 120,000 visitors per year, has a company that numbers more than 550 (including over 100 actors) and an attendance of more than 400,000.

Plays originating at OSF have gone on to be produced by theatres across the country, including Arena Stage, Berkeley Repertory Theatre, Brooklyn Academy of Music, Center Theatre Group, Denver Center Theatre Company, Guthrie Theater, La Jolla Playhouse, Seattle Repertory Theatre and Yale Repertory Theatre. ALL THE WAY was commissioned through OSF’s American Revolutions: the United States History Cycle, initiated in 2008 to look at moments of change in America’s past.

Opening night is Friday, March 14 at 8:00 p.m. The Fortress of Solitude is based on the nationally best-selling novel of the same name by 2005 MacArthur Fellow Jonathan Lethem. The musical is conceived and directed by Daniel Aukin, with a book by Itamar Moses, and music and lyrics by Michael Friedman. Tickets to The Fortress of Solitude, are on sale at www.DallasTheaterCenter.org and by phone at (214) 880-0202.\n\nAukin has previously directed critically acclaimed productions at New York’s Roundabout Theatre Company, Lincoln Center and Manhattan Theatre Club.\n\n“The notion of adapting this gorgeous novel into a musical was terrifying and thrilling and, finally, inescapable,” says Aukin. “I met with Jonathan Lethem and, in a shockingly wonderful show of faith and generosity, he granted permission to give this idea a go.”\n\nFriedman, the composer and lyricist of Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson, was also drawn to the story. “It’s always tricky to find material that really wants to be musicalized,” he says. “Jonathan’s novel is full of music, both imagined and remembered.”\n\nFriedman and Moses adapted the novel together. “It has always been a kind of recursive process of responding to each other, supporting each other, following each other in whatever direction feels most useful and effective,” says Moses.\n\nThe result is a heartbreakingly beautiful tale of the childhood friendship between Dylan Ebdus and Mingus Rude, set against the backdrop of the musical landscape of the end of the twentieth century. It is a story of 1970s Brooklyn and beyond – of black and white, soul and rap, block parties and blackouts, friendship and betrayal, comic books and 45s.\n\nAdam Chanler-Berat, who originated the role of Henry in Broadway’s Next to Normal and of Peter in Broadway’s Peter and the Starcatcher, plays the role of Dylan Ebdus. Kyle Beltran, who recently starred in Tarell McCraney’s Choirboy at Manhattan Theatre Club, and who also appeared in the Broadway production of In the Heights, is Mingus Rude. The boys, both abandoned by their mothers and left in the care of difficult fathers, bond over comic books, LPs, and graffiti. Emmy Award®-winning and Tony Award®-nominated actor Andre De Shields comes to Dallas Theater Center for the first time ever as Barrett Rude Senior, Mingus’ grandfather. De Shields has appeared in countless Broadway productions including The Wiz, Ain’t Misbehavin’ and The Full Monty. Kevin Mambo, who appeared as the title character in the Broadway production of Fela! and in the national tour of The Book of Mormon as Mafala, plays Barrett Rude, Jr., Mingus’ father and the lead singer of the soul group the Subtle Distinctions.\n\nDTC Brierley Resident Acting Company member Alex Organ, recently in Fly By Night and A Christmas Carol, plays Dylan’s father Abraham. Local musical theater star Patty Breckenridge plays the roles of Rachel, Dylan’s mom, and Mrs. Lomb. Etai Benshlomo from the Broadway production of Wicked appears as Arthur; Nick Christopher from the Broadway production Motown as the neighborhood bully Robert; Jeremy Dumont from DTC’s Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor® Dreamcoat and A Christmas Carol as Gabe; Carla Duren from the Broadway production of 110 in the Shade, and Dallas Theater Center’s Give it Up!, is Lala and Abby; local actress Alison Hodgson, who has appeared on stage at Circle Theatre and Jubilee Theatre, plays Liza; Helen Hayes Award nominee Jahi Kearse appears as Henry and Raf; and local actress Traci Lee, who appeared in DTC’s production of Cabaret, plays Marilla. Britton Smith, who has appeared at Lincoln Center; Akron Watson, who has appeared locally at Dallas Theater Center, Theatre Three and WaterTower Theatre; and Juson Williams, from Encore’s The Wiz round out the cast as the members of the Subtle Distinctions.\n\nThe Fortress of Solitude marks the return to Dallas of legendary set designer, Eugene Lee, for the first time in more than two decades. The three-time Tony Award®-winning designer was DTC’s resident designer from 1984-1991. His work at DTC included legendary productions of All the King’s Men, Galileo and The Tempest, as well as his design for the Arts District Theater, where DTC produced productions from 1984-2005, when it was torn down for the construction of the AT&T Performing Arts Center. Lee’s many national credits include serving as the resident scenic designer for NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” since its inception, and his groundbreaking designs for Broadway musicals, including Wicked, Sweeney Todd, and Candide.\n\nTyler Micoleau returns to DTC as lighting designer for The Fortress of Solitude. His previous DTC productions include A Midsummer Night’s Dream and The Who’s Tommy, among others. Making her DTC debut is Jessica Pabst (The Whale and Moses’ Nobody Loves You) as costume designer. Also returning to DTC is Tony Award®-winning sound designer Robb Kaplowitz (Fela!), who previously designed DTC’s It’s a Bird…It’s a Plane…It’s Superman.\n\nSouthern Methodist University alumnus Kimberly Grigsby, who was the music supervisor for DTC’s It’s a Bird…It’s a Plane…It’s Superman, returns to Dallas to be the show’s musical director. Grigsby’s recent Broadway credits include Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark and Spring Awakening. Rounding out the creative team is Camille A. Brown as choreographer. Brown is the artistic director and choreographer of the award winning Dance Company, Camille A. Brown & Dancers.\n\n“The Fortress of Solitude is an emotionally moving musical filled with breathtaking songs and beautifully crafted characters,” says DTC Artistic Director Kevin Moriarty. “It is an honor to welcome back to Dallas so many long-time friends and collaborators for this production, including Eugene Lee, a man who helped create this organization’s artistic identity and whose work has served as a constant source of inspiration for Dallas theatergoers for several decades.”\n\nTickets for The Fortress of Solitude are on sale now. Ticket prices start at $15 and are available online at www.DallasTheaterCenter.org or by phone at (214) 880-0202. The Fortress of Solitude opens with previews on Friday, March 7 at 8:00 p.m. with a Pay-What-You-Can performance. Tickets to this performance will be available for purchase online at www.DallasTheaterCenter.org beginning Monday, March 3. Any unsold tickets to the PWYC performance will be available for purchase at the Wyly Theatre box office the night of the show beginning at 6:30 p.m. DTC’s Come Early sponsored by Wells Fargo will take place one hour before every performance and will be led by Alex Organ. Patrons will have the opportunity to learn about the play prior to viewing the production. DTC’s Dr. Pepper Snapple Stay Late will take place after each performance. Patrons will have the opportunity to engage with artists, learn about the production and share insights about the play in a lively discussion, which will be moderated by Alex Organ. Details for Come Early and Stay Late are available online.\n\nABOUT DALLAS THEATER CENTER:\n\nOne of the leading regional theaters in the country, Dallas Theater Center (DTC) performs to an audience of more than 120,000 North Texas residents\n\nannually.

Throughout its history, DTC has produced many new works, including The Texas Trilogy by Preston Jones in 1978, Robert Penn Warren’s All the King’s Men, adapted by Adrian Hall, in 1986, and recent premieres of FLY by Rajiv Joseph, Bill Sherman and Kirstin Childs; Fly by Night by Kim Rosenstock, Michael Mitnick and Will Connolly; Giant by Michael John LaChiusa and Sybille Pearson; The Trinity River Plays by Regina Taylor; the revised It’s a Bird… It’s a Plane… It’s Superman by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, Charles Strouse and Lee Adams; Give It Up!

The Public continues the work of its visionary founder, Joe Papp, by acting as an advocate for the theater as an essential cultural force, and leading and framing dialogue on some of the most important issues of our day. Creating theater for one of the largest and most diverse audience bases in New York City for nearly 60 years, today the Company engages audiences in a variety of venues—including its landmark downtown home at Astor Place, which houses five theaters and Joe’s Pub; the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, home to its beloved, free Shakespeare in the Park; and the Mobile Unit, which tours Shakespearean productions for underserved audiences throughout New York City’s five boroughs. The Public’s wide range of programming includes free Shakespeare in the Park, the bedrock of the Company’s dedication to making theater accessible to all; Public Works, a new initiative that is designed to cultivate new connections and new models of engagement with artists, audiences and the community each year; new and experimental stagings at The Public at Astor Place, including Public Lab; and a range of artist and audience development initiatives including its Public Forum series, which brings together theater artists and professionals from a variety of disciplines for discussions that shed light on social issues explored in Public productions. The Public Theater is located on property owned by the City of New York and receives annual support from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs; and in October 2012 the landmark building downtown at Astor Place was revitalized to physically manifest the Company’s core mission of sparking new dialogues and increasing accessibility for artists and audiences, by dramatically opening up the building to the street and community, and transforming the lobby into a public piazza for artists, students, and audiences. Key elements of the revitalization included infrastructure updates to the 158-year old building, as well a construction of new exterior entry stair and glass canopy; installation of ramps for improved accessibility; an expanded and refurbished lobby; the addition of a mezzanine level with a new restaurant lounge, The Library at The Public, designed by the Rockwell Group. The LuEsther T. Mertz Charitable Trust provides leadership support for The Public Theater’s year-round activities. www.publictheater.org\n\nOther articles by Lia Chang:\n\nRome Neal’s Banana Puddin’ Jazz Presents “LADY” Featuring Lia Chang, Monica Garrido, Carolyn Holmes, Noel Simon’ Wippler, Linda Hudson, Adi Meyerson and Kathleen Doran\n\nPhotos: Harriet Harris, John Tartaglia, Christine Toy Johnson, Alan Muraoka, James Saito and More celebrate Ann Harada’s Debut at Lincoln Center in the American Songbook Series\n\nPhotos: Steve Rosen, David Rossmer, Hannah Elless, Vadim Feichtner, Cathryn Salamone, Ken Triwush and Kate Wetherhead Celebrate The Other Josh Cohen Opening Night\n\nBryan Cranston Makes Broadway Debut in Robert Schenkkan’s All the Way at The Neil Simon Theatre, Opens March 6, 2014\n\nCelebrating the Year of the Horse with David Henry Hwang’s Kung Fu at Signature Theatre; Previews begin February 4, 2014\n\nPhotos: Backstage Q & A with Thom Sesma and the cast of Signature’s Miss Saigon\n\nJan. 22-31: Photos: Tracey Conyer Lee, Lelund Durond Thompson, Matthew Murumba, and Carmen LoBue set for Camille Darby’s Lords Resistance Featured in The Fire This Time Festival at The Kraine Theater\n\n2014 is the Year of the Horse, Dragons and Lions in The Chinese New Year Parade\n\nQ & A with Meet Me in St. Louis: A Live Radio Play’s Garth Kravits\n\nPhotos: David Henry Hwang, Annie Baker and Rajiv Joseph honored at Sixth Annual Steinberg Playwright “Mimi” Awards\n\nPhotos: Christine Toy Johnson, Baayork Lee, Jose Llana, Ann Harada, Dodie Pettit and More at Charles Randolph-Wright’s “Three Voices” concert series at Stage 72\n\nClick here for the Lia Chang Articles Archive and here for the Lia Chang Photography Website.\n\nOther articles on Andre De Shields:\n\nAndré De Shields to receive 2014 Making Waves Award; will perform “Frederick Douglass: Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory” at Florida Atlantic University\n\nNov. 16: Conversations with the Divine with Owais Ahmed, Baize Buzan, Kathryn Cesarz, Kamal Hans, Brian Grey, Donica Lynn, Patrese McClain and Miranda Zola at Chicago’s Victory Gardens Theater\n\nPhotos: André De Shields, Michael Shannon, Rajiv Joseph, Christine Sherrill, Doug Peck, Alexis J.

Danny Glover and Debbi Morgan will co-host this special event saluting NFT, which kicks off at 4pm, and features performances from Daniel Beaty, Impact Repertory Theater (Academy Award Nominee, “Raise It Up” from the film August Rush), Chuck Jackson, and Valerie Simpson. Honorary Chairmen are Harry Belafonte and Hon. Mayor David N. Dinkins.\n\nVoza Rivers is an accomplished theatre, music, film and events producer and is recognized as one of the country’s leading African American theatre producers. Rivers’ involvement in the theatre dates back to 1964 when he met Roger Furman, a playwright/ director, and a member of the American Negro Theatre (1940-1949), which included Harry Belafonte, Ruby Dee, Sidney Poitier, Gertrude Jeannette, and Fred O’Neil among many others. Furman launched New Heritage 50 years ago on the philosophy and mission of his beloved American Negro Theatre. Rivers joined New Heritage with Furman’s encouragement and guidance which left an indelible impression on the importance of black theater and the role it played then and now in mirroring the lives of people of color around the world. Rivers became Executive Director of New Heritage upon Furman’s death in 1983. In 1973 Furman directed a staged revival of the American Negro’s Theatre’s 1940′s production of Striver’s Row, starring Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis. Under River’s leadership New Heritage produced, in tribute to Furman, a 1984 production of Strivers Row, which earned New Heritage lavish praise and many awards. The successful impact of Striver’s Row inspired Rivers to look beyond the African American experience and reach across the world to introduce Harlem to the works of Black South African playwrights and actors. In 1984, as Executive Producer of New Heritage, Rivers and his team convinced the producers of a two character South African play, Woza Albert!, featuring Mbongeni Ngema and Percy Mtwa, and directed by Barney Simon, at the Lucille Lortel Theater in New York City to allow New Heritage to transfer and produce Woza Albert!, this extraordinary and powerful play about apartheid, at New Heritage’s theater in Harlem. The success of Woza Albert!, an example of agitprop theater, initiated a historic relationship between New Heritage,Mbongeni Ngema and Black South African artists that has fostered such major productions such as Ngema’s Asinamali! and Sarafina! the Musical – both shows went to Broadway. The relationship between New Heritage’s team (Phyllis Yvonne Stickney, Andre Robinson, and Duma Ndlovu) continues to this day. In 1988, New Heritage presented the stage production of Sarafina! in Harlem at Aaron Davis Hall for two presentations; one for 750 Harlem students and the second for the community. Also in 1988, Rivers received the FEDAT (Foundation for the Extension and Development of the American Professional Theatre, supported by the League of American Theatres and Producers) award for his work on Sarafina! That same year Rivers received the United Nations Medal for Peace, also for Sarafina! and in 1989, a banner year, he received a Grammy nomination, as one of the producers of the Sarafina! cast album and co-produced with Lincoln Center Theater a musical concert featuring Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masakela and the Sarafina! cast at Radio City Music Hall.\n\nActor, producer and humanitarian Danny Glover has been a commanding presence on screen, stage and television for more than 25 years. As an actor, his film credits range from the blockbuster Lethal Weapon franchise to smaller independent features, some of which Glover also produced. He co-starred in the critically acclaimed feature Dreamgirls directed by Bill Condon and in Po’ Boy’s Game for director Clement Virgo. He appeared in the hit feature Shooter for director Antoine Fuqua and can be seen in Honeydripper for director John Sayles and Be Kind, Rewind for director Michel Gondry. Glover has also gained respect for his wide-reaching community activism and philanthropic efforts, with a particular emphasis on advocacy for economic justice, and access to health care and education programs in the United States and Africa. For these efforts, Glover received a 2006 DGA Honor. Internationally, Glover has served as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Program from 1998-2004, focusing on issues of poverty, disease, and economic development in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and currently serves as UNICEF Ambassador. In 2005, Glover co-founded Louverture Films dedicated to the development and production of films of historical relevance, social purpose, commercial value and artistic integrity. A native of San Francisco, Glover trained at the Black Actors’ Workshop of the American Conservatory Theater. It was his Broadway debut in Fugard’s Master Harold…and the boys, which brought him to national recognition and led director Robert Benton to cast Glover in his first leading role in 1984′s Oscar®-nominated Best Picture Places in the Heart. The following year, Glover starred in two more Best Picture nominees: Peter Weir’s Witness and Steven Spielberg’s The Color Purple. In 1987, Glover partnered with Mel Gibson in the first Lethal Weapon film and went on to star in three hugely successful Lethal Weapon sequels. Glover has also invested his talents in more personal projects, including the award-winning To Sleep With Anger, which he executive produced and for which he won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Actor; Bopha!; Manderlay; Missing in America; and the film version of Athol Fugard’s play Boesman and Lena. On the small screen, Glover won an Image Award and a Cable ACE Award and earned an Emmy nomination for his performance in the title role of the HBO movie Mandela. He has also received Emmy nominations for his work in the acclaimed miniseries “Lonesome Dove” and the telefilm “Freedom Song.” As a director, he earned a Daytime Emmy nomination for Showtime’s “Just a Dream.”\n\nDebbi Morgan was born in Dunn, North Carolina and raised in the South Bronx. Morgan appeared in several commercials before joining the New Federal Theatre Company. Her theatrical career includes roles in the Broadway hit What the Wine Sellers Buy, Off-Broadway production of Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie? and Los Angeles productions of My Sister, My Sister and Once in a Wifetime. Ms. Morgan’s career over the past thirty years has been filled with colorful and deeply captivating roles such as the controversial film, Color of The Cross where Morgan portrayed Mary, the Mother of Jesus. She co-starred in the provoking film, Woman Thou Art Loosed along with Loretta Divine and the Reverend TD Jakes. She appeared opposite Samuel L. Jackson in the feature film Coach Carter, and co-starred along with Alfre Woodard, Omar Epps, and Dennis Haysbert in the popular Love and Basketball. Morgan also co-starred opposite Denzel Washington in Norman Jewison’s The Hurricane, which won her a Best Actress nomination for an NAACP Image Award. However, it was in Kasi Lemmons’ critically acclaimed feature Eve’s Bayou that Debbi made her unforgettable big screen debut. Her performance garnered her an Independent Film Project Spirit Award and a Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress, as well as Best Supporting Actress nominations from the NAACP Image Awards and the Golden Satellite Awards. Morgan has guest starred on numerous primetime series, and starred in her own series opposite Lea Thompson on the Lifetime series “For the People”. She also starred in the short lived FX televsion series, “Touching Evil”. Other notable primetime appearances include re-curring guest-star roles as Darrin DeWitt Henson’s ne’er- do-well mother on Showtime’s popular family drama “Soulfood”, for which she won an NAACP Image Award, and as the mystical Seer on the WB supernatural drama “Charmed.” But it was in the role of Angie Hubbard on the popular daytime drama “All My Children,” which catapulted Morgan into public consciousness in 1989, where she became the first, and only thus far, African American actress to win an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress. But one of her biggest award highlights was in 2009 when Debbi received the prestigious Gracie Award honoring women who’ve made enormous strides in television. Currently, in addition to her other commitments, Debbi has mounted a one-woman show “The Monkey on My Back!” based on her memoir of the same title. It has been playing to standing room only audiences and is the first of a series of such performances. And the actress’s production company, Dam Entertainment is working in conjunction with Goldline Productions to bring to reality TV “All About The Benjamin’s”, a family’s journey in dealing with two young adult sons, one with Autism, and the other with Asperger’s syndrome. Debbi also just joined the cast of the new series “Power” for the Starz network, playing the recurring role of Estelle, executive produced by 50 Cent and slated to begin airing in 2014. And capping off the end of the 2013 Debbi was offered a book deal with Simon & Schuster for penning her personal memoir The Monkey on My Back, scheduled for release next year.\n\nFounded by Woodie King, Jr. in 1970, New Federal Theatre has gone on to international acclaim for its bold mission to integrate minorities and women into the mainstream of American theater by training artists for the profession and by presenting plays by minorities and women to integrated, multicultural audiences – plays which evoke the truth through beautiful, artistic recreations of ourselves. Specializing in minority drama, New Federal Theatre has brought the joy of the living stage to not only the minority community living on the Lower East Side near NFT’s home at Henry Street Settlement’s Abrons Arts Center, but to audiences from all over the metropolitan area. NFT has provided emerging playwrights with the opportunity to have their works produced; it has brought minority actors, directors and designers to national attention and sponsored numerous ethnic theater groups and events. NFT’s vocational training workshops continue to prepare minority people for employment in theater and related fields. Most importantly, NFT provides the multi-ethnic Lower East Side, as well as the New York Metro area, with theater of the highest caliber that relates to the interest of different cultural groups. The impact of NFT is nothing less than extraordinary. Writers first presented at NFT are now part of the literary fabric of the American mainstream.

Woodie King Jr. directs a cast that also features Toccarra Cash, Michael Chenevert, Ugo Chukwu, Aaliyah Habeeb, Beethovan Oden, G. Alverez Reid, Ashley C. Turner, and Brittany N. Williams.\n\nSet during a three-day holiday party at the home of Marie Horton in the Wilshire section of Los Angles in the early 1960s, it takes place against the backdrop of the Civil Right Movement and on the eve of the Watts Rebellion. Most of the play’s middle class characters, however, are distant from those upheavals; instead they drink, flirt, quarrel and reminisce as they hope their lives in the emerging Black middle class can shield them against the painful legacy of slavery and racism in America.\n\nThe Fabulous Miss Marie is structured like a jazz improvisation, with each of the ensemble members taking a solo/monologue, that reveals the pain simmering under the party’s cheerful, suburban façade. As New York Times theatre critic Clive Barnes said at the time, “Bullins writes the way Charlie Parker played: It is all so easy and effortless. It sounds improvised, and yet it doesn’t sound improvised, simply because it is the improvisation of formalitThe Fabulous Miss Marie, is set in Los Angeles during the Civil Rights’ student sit-ins. This is arguably Bullins’ greatest work, one that bears comparison to Anton Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard. Like Chekhov, Bullins is interested in how love can be expressed in a “cemetery of human failure and class arrogance.” With this play, part of his Twentieth Century Cycle, Bullins perfected a dramatic structure also found in In the Wine Time, which kicked off this season.\n\nEd Bullins is considered one of the most prolific and influential playwrights of the Black Arts Movement. Winner of the prestigious NY Drama Critics’ Circle Award and OBIE Award for The Taking of Miss Janie, he has greatly influenced American theatre, especially Black theatre. He is the author of more than 100 plays that have been produced throughout the United States and Europe. His acclaimed canon of plays include Clara’s Ole Man, Dialect Determinism (or The Rally), How Do You Do (1965), A Minor Scene, It Has No Choice, The Theme Is Blackness (1966); In New England Winter, Black Commercial #2 (1967); Goin’ a Buffalo, A Son Come Home, The Electronic Nigger, The Corner, In The Wine Time, The Gentleman Caller (1968); The Box Office, One-Minute Commercial, State Office Bldg. Cruse, The American Flag Ritual, We Righteous Bombers (1969); The Helper, Death List, A Short Play for A Small Theater, Street Sounds, The Man Who Dug Fish, The Duplex, It Bess Dat Way, A Street Play, A Black Time for Black Folk (1970); The Fabulous Miss Marie, Night of the Beast (1971); The Play of the Play (1973); Malcolm: 71 or Publishing Blackness (1975); The Taking of Miss Janie, The Mystery of Phyllis Wheatley: An Historical Play for Young Americans, I Am Lucy Terry: An Historical Fantasy for Young Americans (1976); City Preacher (1984); High John Da Conqueror: the Musical (1985); and Salaam, Huey Newton, Salaam (1990), among others. He received the New York Drama Critics Circle Award, the Drama Desk Vernon Rice Award, the Drama Prize at the Venice Biennale Arts Festival, an Honorary Doctor of Letters from Columbia College, three OBIE Awards, two Guggenheim fellowships, three Rockefeller Foundation Playwriting grants and three NEA playwriting grants. A Professor of Theatre at Northeastern University, Mr. Bullins has also won AUDELCO Awards and The Black Theatre Festival Living Legend Award. Bullins has published four collections of plays: Five Plays by Ed Bullins (1968), The Fabulous Miss Marie (1970), The Duplex: A Black Love Fable in Four Movements (1971), Four Dynamite Plays (1972) and The Theme is Blackness (1972), as well as short prose The Hungered One: Early Writings (1971) and a novel The Reluctant Rapist (1973). Bullins was recently represented Off-Broadway by the York Theater’s revival of Storyville. His work, characterized by disdain for ineffective political rhetoric as a substitute for action, most often examines the lives of Black people in the inner city. In 1968, Clive Barnes, writing in the New York Times called Bullins “a welcome addition to the ranks of New York playwrights.” Four years later, Barnes added “Bullins writes the way Charlie Parker played: It is all so easy and effortless. It sounds improvised, and yet it doesn’t sound improvised, simply because it is the improvisation of formality.” Today, Bullins is regarded as a seminal force in the American theater.\n\nPerformances will be Thursday and Friday evenings at 7:30 PM, Saturday at 2 PM and 7:30 PM, and Sunday at 2 PM.

Last month, in honor of Women’s Herstory Month, I made my jazz vocalist debut in Rome Neal’s Banana Puddin’ Jazz Series “LADY” at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe in New York, attended Barry Harris’ Jazz Vocals Workshop and sang at Cobi Narita’s Friday Night Open Mic at Pearl Studios in New York. Below are excerpts from our chat after Cobi’s Open Mic.\n\nRome Neal’s Banana Puddin’ Jazz Presents “LADY” Featuring Lia Chang, Monica Garrido, Carolyn Holmes, Noel Simon’ Wippler, Linda Hudson, Adi Meyerson and Kathleen Doran\n\nLia: How did you start Banana Puddin’ Jazz?\n\nRome: It started with me doing the research for the character of Thelonious Monk in the play MONK, penned exclusively for me by my good friend Laurence Holder. I would go to jazz clubs to find out the essence of my character. It was important to me to listen to music live, being with the musicians and getting a true sense of the environments that I was talking about in the play. Then it clicked. I wanted to sing the music; I wanted to promote the music. I wanted to be a part of the music. And I have my home, the Nuyorican Poets Café, my artistic home. So I said, “Hey, let me bring this energy that I was feeling from uptown in Harlem clubs like the legendary Saint Nick’s Pub and The Lenox Lounge, downtown to the Lower East Side, and do a jazz series.”\n\nLia: How do you choose who you are going to shine the spotlight on each month?\n\nRome: I like themes – Like the Women in Jazz for Women’s Herstory Month which you were in, LGBT greats in Jazz-which I explored people in the gay and lesbian community who were jazz musicians; vocalists who created this music, like Billy Strayhorn, Billie Holiday, Carmen MacCrae; The Young and the Jazzy; Gentle Gentlemen in Jazz; Marvtastic Ladies in Jazz, the Japanese Jazz Connection. One idea surfaced for a couple of Jazzy Thespians events which was in celebration of the National Black Theatre Festival in Winston-Salem, NC and was followed by another one which paid tribute to the New York based AUDELCO Black Theatre Awards. I want to do the Russian Jazz Connection, because there are a lot of Russians in town that are doing jazz. Then there are times I just like to showcase up and coming talent.\n\nLia: Tell me about your TV show.\n\nRome: The Banana Puddin’ Jazz TV Show is in it’s 4th year on Brooklyn Public Network Channel 3. It can also be found on these cable stations: Cablevision 69, Time Warner 56, Verizon FIOS 44, RCN 84. It plays every Tuesday at 11:30 a.m. and 7:30 pm. It is a 28 minute edited version of what I do at the Nuyorican Poets Café, the essence of my Banana Puddin’ Jazz evening. It is also streamed world wide.\n\nLia: This past winter, you starred in and directed Ishmael Reed’s The Final Version, which explores the complex intersections between racial identity and liberal ideology, and examines how New York City’s leftist culture has changed since the 1930′s. You portrayed Lee Ransom, an African-American writer sponsored by the American Communist Party, who struggles with tensions between Communist ideology and commercial success from the 1930s through the 1960s.\n\nRome: Ishmael is a genius and you can sense this in the many plays he has written over the years of which I have been blessed to direct. He has an investigative skill of having the audience discover societal and political truths that not only make you more knowledgeable about what’s going on around you, but makes you laugh out loud!!!\n\nLia: Who are the jazz musicians that inspire you?\n\nRome: At the top of the list is pianist/composer/educator, Dr. Barry Harris, another genius and man with a heart of gold. Barry is not only one of the most acclaimed jazz musicians on the scene he is an educator of the music who holds court every Tuesday at 250 w 65th Street, a community center on the Westside. Then there’s bassist/composer Bill Lee (Spike’s dad). We live in the same neighborhood and one day we met and a whole new world opened up for me. Bill is like a father/brother and good friend who scored the music not only for his son, Spike’s movies like Do The Right Thing, Mo Betta Blues and others, but he he created the score and performed on the soundtrack of MONK in which I get to hear his great music everytime I perform the play. I have been a vocalist in his band and had the opportunity to hire him to play at Banana Puddin’ Jazz with his big band and small band… I’m truly inspired by his love for the music and support of other musicians. This list can go on but to name a few more: – there’s saxophonists, James Carter and Patience Higgins, pianists, Johnnie O’Neal, Lafayette Harris Jr., Frank Owens, and of course Thelonious Sphere Monk….\n\nLia: Your daughter Lia Neal is an Olympian Swimmer. When did she start training?\n\nRome: She started going to lessons at 6 and then she started going to competitions around 8, and then excelling around 10 years old showing signs of someone who was really going to be great in the water. I recall seeing her around 10, she would be swimming and be one body length behind the lead person in the pool, and all of sudden, she comes out of nowhere and wins the race. Those were great moments and recently it happened at the 2014 NCAA Championships in Minnesota where she swam the anchor leg of the 400 yard relay for her Stanford team. While the team, being a body length behind swimming against some of the fastest swimmers in the country, she was able win the race for them. It was an amazing moment!\n\nLia: What does it feel like to have an Olympian in the family? Is anybody else athletic?\n\nRome: My sons are good basketball players. To have an Olympian in the family feels good, real good. A sense of pride, a sense of relaxation. It is a good relaxed feeling to know that this young lady is taking it to another level where she is respected, rewarded for what she does in the pool. And she just happens to be my daughter. Above all that I’m glad she is happy.\n\nLia: After making my jazz vocalist debut at Banana Puddin’ Jazz, you suggested we hit some open mics around town, including Cobi Narita’s Friday Night Open Mic with Frank Owens on the keys. How do you choose to hone your craft?\n\nRome: For me, back in the days, first I was studying this Monk character, then I was going out to these clubs. While you are sitting there, you can not not get the bug. One night I was sitting there and I saw one lady go up to sing and she didn’t sound so good. This was with these top musicians. I said, “wow, if she can do that, then I can do that.” So the next week, I had a song and I came to the club. The song was In My Solitude orBody and Soul. I sang this song, and low and behold, I didn’t sound too good. It made me realize that you just don’t get up there and sing a song. You have to do your homework. These great jazz musicians that are up there playing behind you singing, these guys have studied this music, religiously and spiritually, some scientifically, it is a part of their being. I had to grasp those elements up under me. I still went out to the clubs, and I would take a song. I would hit 3 clubs, including St. Nicks Pub and Lenox Lounge, and I would sing the same song, that’s 3 times in the same evening. Then I would go back the next week and sing that same song again, until I landed that song. Once I get a song down, I would go on to the next song and continue at these different clubs.\n\nThen I realized I had to go a little bit deeper. In my research for Monk, I had to touch base with Barry Harris. Barry Harris knew Monk very well. He lived in the same household as Monk for 10 years before Monk had passed. They lived in the Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter’s mansion in Weehawken. Barry still lives there now. I went to Barry Harris’ Workshop and I took classes with him and have been there ever since.\n\nLia: How did Dr. Barry Harris come to your attention?\n\nRome: I was walking by this workshop and I saw these people and they were doing music, but I was too intimidated to go in there. This is 20 years ago. I forgot all about that workshop. I remember walking by there but I do not recall who was in there. But I do remember that workshop, because I found out about it later on. Something about it drew me in. I still was intimidated, I didn’t want to go inside. These musicians, singers… I wasn’t into the music that much anyway.\n\nLearning this Monk character, I ran into Barry Harris at a reading for another playwright. Monk has been so much in my life. There’s another guy who had written a three character play about Monk, which included the Baroness and Bud Powell. We did a reading of it. The playwright had invited Barry Harris to the reading because he wanted Barry to do the music for the play. So I was sitting up there under Barry Harris, reading the play. At that time I really didn’t have a clue as to who Monk was. People said I looked like him. So I was just ‘acting’. After the reading, I asked Barry what he thought. He said, “That was good, but Monk didn’t talk that much.” So I still had to search more for this character. But that was my first introduction to Barry Harris.\n\nYears later, when I got to do the play with Laurence Holder, I knew I had to connect with Barry Harris, and get some insight from him, because he was one of the ones that was really close to him. That worked out very well. Once I started going to the workshop and turning him on to the play, he became interested in what I was doing with the play and he invested some money into the play, and got others to invest when it went Off-Broadway. Then he invited me over to the house on the last day of tech, before we opened. He said, “You can come over now.” I picked him and drove him over to Weehawken and went into this house that Monk lived in 10 years be"
