        "text": "For liners and the shipping companies movies and films had been a top marketing tool\n\nMovies or Films and liners at sea, had been intriguing me since I have read about in my youth in LUXUSLINER - BILDER EINER GROSSEN ZEIT by Lee Server (THE GOLDEN AGE OF OCEAN LINERS). But earlier, mot only since my first crossing, I was keen watching movies with liners in it, and disapointed, which was an understatement, when I realized the films have been made in a set ashore in some movie \"factory\". That was after my first crossing.\n\nby Earl of Cruise\n\nan essay in progress\n\n`Sabrina´, Humphrey Bogart in the office, while LIBERTÉ is sailing out of New York harbor - screenshot\n\nOcean liners, especially those of the luxury category, had been the location of dramas, love stories, thrillers, suspense and catastrophies sinde film was born, or nearly.\n\nIn this list, the most descriptions are taken from Wikipedia, as I guess no one can expect having seen all these films ... otherwise I would have squared eyes. The list I tried to do as chronological as possible. But avoiding the cruise ship films, the catastrophy and horror genre, so no Poseidon, Titanic Raising, Monster/Freak Waves and such.\n\nTV shows such as `Love Boat´, the German adaption `Das Traumschiff´ (German Wiki) and the far less well-known, even in Germany, `Das Ferienschiff´ aired 1968/69 at ZDF and staged onboard HANSEATIC 2, ex SHALOM. This TV show was, I dare say, the mother of the younger TV shows, I will present in a special article later.\n\nThis article/post will be updated with new movies and films, as it is quite a task getting them all at once.\n\nFor some time I am thinking of a list of films staging aboard liners, and don´t think about their short appearance as in `How to Marry a Millionaire´, 1953, with LIBERTÉ (German wiki) sailing into New York harbor in the opening scene, or leaving the Big Apple as in `Sabrina´. I am thinking of a list where the film location is the ship, or in major parts. I got my idea refueled by a post in the FB group The Ocean Liner Enthusiasts, where a number of films had been mentioned.\n\nLiners and ships in general are ideal sets for romantic affairs ... in films but too in real life ...\n\n`How to Marry a Millionaire´, LIBERTÉ sailing into New York - screenshot from the YouTube video\n\nThe heyday for shipboard films have been the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. But some early films have been made 1912, about the TITANIC desaster.\n\nThe first Film about a ship and partly filmed on was about the TITANIC desaster in April 1912.\n\nSaved From The TITANIC (1912)\n\nDirector: Étienne Arnaud\n\nSaved from the TITANIC is a 1912 American silent motion picture short starring Dorothy Gibson, an American film actress who survived the sinkingof TITANIC on April 15, 1912. Premiering in the United States just 29 days after the event, it is the earliest dramatization about the tragedy.\n\n`Saved From The TITANIC´ - Source: Wikipedia\n\nGibson had been one of 28 people aboard the first lifeboat to be launched from TITANIC and was rescued about five and a half hours after leaving the ship. On returning to New York City, she co-wrote the script and played a fictionalized version of herself. The plot involves her recounting the story of the disaster to her fictional parents and fiancé, with the footage interspersed with stock footage of icebergs, Titanic's sister ship OLYMPIC and the ship's captain, Edward Smith. To add to the film's authenticity, Gibson wore the same clothes as on the night of the disaster. The filming took place in a New Jersey studio and aboard a derelict ship in New York Harbor.\n\nThe film was released internationally and attracted large audiences and positive reviews, though some criticized it for commercializing the tragedy so soon after the event. It is now regarded as a lost film, as the last known prints were destroyed in an Éclair studio fire in March 1914. Only a few printed stills and promotional photos are known to survive. It is Gibson's penultimate film, as she reportedly suffered a mental breakdown after completing it.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nLa hantise (1912)\n\nDirector: Louis Feuillade\n\n(English: The Obsession) is a 1912 short silent film directed by Louis Feuillade. The film stars Renée Carl and René Navarre. The film focuses on a woman who is told by a palm reader that one of her loved ones will die. The woman then tries to convince her husband not to board TITANIC, as she fears for his safety. The film is said to confront the fraud of palm reading, highlighting the suffering that obsessive belief in the supernatural can create.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nIn Nacht und Eis (1912)\n\nDirector: Mime Misu\n\nCast:Waldemar Hecker, Otto Rippert, Ernst Rückert\n\n(English: \"In Night and Ice\"), also called Der Untergang der TITANIC (\"The Sinking of the TITANIC\") is a 1912 German adventure-disaster drama film about the sinking of TITANIC. The filming began during the summer of 1912, and the film premiered that winter.\n\nFilm poster of `In Nacht und Eis´ - Source: Wikipedia\n\nThe film starts out with the passengers boarding at Southampton. The lives of the passengers on board the ill-fated ocean liner are depicted. On 14 April, the Titanic strikes an iceberg, throwing the diners in the Café Parisien to the side. Panic strikes the passengers. The crew ready the lifeboats, despite the fact that there are not enough of them. Women and children are loaded, while the men are held back. The radio operators (who take up most of the sinking part of the film) send out an urgent SOS. Fire blows out of the funnels during the sinking and then the boilers explode. The radio room floods, and finally the operators and captain jump ship and the Titanic sinks. Some survivors make it to a lifeboat, where they are pulled in. The captain swims to the lifeboat but when he is offered a spot, he instead swims away and goes underwater to drown.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThe Immigrant (1917)\n\nalso called Broke\n\nDirector: Charlie Chaplin\n\nChaplin’s Tramp character stars as an immigrant coming to the United States. The film begins aboard a steamer crossing the Atlantic Ocean and showcases the life onboard and the misadventures of the Tramp while trying to avoid seasick passengers. During the voyage he befriends a young woman traveling with her ailing mother, yet ends up being accused of theft.\n\nA scene in which Chaplin’s character kicks an immigration officer was later cited as evidence of his anti-Americanism when he was exiled from the United States in 1952 during McCarthy´s witchhunt. I see too a harsh social criticism in this film such as in Modern Times.\n\n`The Immigrant´, film poster, depicting the famed restaurant scene - Source: Wikipedia\n\nThe Immigrant (YouTube video) is a 1917 American silent romantic comedy short. The film stars Charlie Chaplin's Tramp character as an immigrant coming to the United States who is accused of theft on the voyage across the Atlantic Ocean, and falls in love with a beautiful young woman along the way. It also stars Edna Purviance and Eric Campbell.\n\nThe movie was written and directed by Chaplin.\n\nAccording to Kevin Brownlow and David Gill's documentary series Unknown Chaplin, the first scenes to be written and filmed take place in what became the movie's second half, in which the penniless Tramp finds a coin and goes for a meal in a restaurant, not realising that the coin has fallen out of his pocket. It was not until later that Chaplin decided the reason the Tramp was penniless was that he had just arrived on a boat from Europe, and used this notion as the basis for the first half. Purviance reportedly was required to eat so many plates of beans during the many takes to complete the restaurant sequence (in character as another immigrant who falls in love with Charlie) that she became physically ill.\n\nThe scene in which Chaplin's character kicks an immigration officer was cited later as evidence of his anti-Americanism when he was forced to leave the United States in 1952. In 1998, The Immigrant was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nThe film begins aboard a steamer crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and initially showcases the misadventures of an unnamed immigrant, the Tramp (Chaplin) who finds himself in assorted mischief while, among other things, playing cards, eating in a mess hall, and avoiding seasick passengers. Along the way, he befriends another unnamed immigrant (Purviance) who is traveling to America with her ailing mother. The two are robbed by a pickpocket who is losing in gambling. The Tramp, feeling sorry for the two penniless women, attempts to secretly place his winnings from his card game in the woman's pocket, but ends up being mistakenly accused of being a pickpocket. The woman manages to clear the Tramp's name. Upon arrival in America, the Tramp and the woman part company.\n\n`The Immigrant´, film secene used for different promotions regarding immigration - family members collection\n\nLater, hungry and broke, the tramp finds a coin on the street outside a restaurant and pockets it. He doesn't realize there is a hole in his pocket and the coin has fallen straight through and is back on the ground. He enters the restaurant, where he orders a plate of beans. There, he is reunited with the woman and discovers her mother is dead. The Tramp orders a meal for her.\n\nAs they eat, they watch the restaurant's burly head waiter (Campbell) and other waiters attack and forcibly eject a patron who is short 10 cents in paying his bill. The Tramp, intimidated by the waiter, checks and now realizes he has lost his coin. Terrified of facing the same treatment as the man he saw thrown out, the Tramp begins planning how he will fight the huge man. Soon, however, he finds the same coin fallen from the head waiter's pocket onto the floor and makes many failed attempts to retrieve it without notice. He finally retrieves the coin and nonchalantly pays the waiter only to be thunderstruck when the waiter reveals the coin to be fake. Once again, the Tramp prepares for the fight of his life. Just then, a visiting artist spots the Tramp and the woman and offers them a job to pose for a painting. The two agree. The artist offers to pay for the Tramp and the woman's meal, but the Tramp declines the offer several times for reasons of etiquette, intending to eventually accept the artist's offer; however, he's dismayed when the artist does not renew his offer to pay at the last moment. The artist pays for his own meal and leaves a tip for the waiter. The Tramp notices that the tip is enough to cover the couple's meal and, without the artist noticing, palms the tip and presents it to the waiter as his own payment for his and the woman's meal. As a final riposte, he lets the waiter keep the remaining change - one small coin - after paying his bill.

Originally, two versions were made, the English and German-language version Atlantik were shot simultaneously. Subsequently, AS the voice-over technology in those did not exist, the production of a French version (Atlantis) began in spring 1930 using different footage and partially an altered storyline. The fourth version was released as a silent film.\n\n`Atlantic´ - Source: Wikipedia\n\n`Atlantic´ is a drama film based on the rms TITANIC and set aboard a fictional ship, called the Atlantic. The main plotline revolves around a man who has a shipboard affair with a fellow passenger, which is eventually discovered by his wife. The ship also has aboard an elderly couple, the Rools, who are on their anniversary cruise. Midway across the Atlantic Ocean, the Atlantic strikes an iceberg and is damaged to the point where it is sinking into the Atlantic. A shortage of lifeboats causes the crew to only allow women and children in (though the captain allows a few men to take to the last remaining boats as the disaster reaches its zenith) and many couples are separated. Mrs. Rool refuses to leave her husband and after the boats are gone all the passengers gather on the deck and sing \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\" as the Atlantic sinks into the ocean. The final scenes depict a group of passengers saying the Lord's Prayer in a flooding lounge.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThe film industry of those days, 1930s, produced scenes on board of passenger ships, that have been quite luxurious and made the audience known to and admiring the luxury.\n\nIt was the time when the New York Stock Exchange crash had been fully hitting the most of world economic.\n\nThe writers, screen play writers, impressarios, studio owners, actors, etc. had been regulars on the transatlantic liners and those vessels sailing other routes across the oceans and could do life studies on fellow passengers, which lead to accurate descriptions of onboard scenes, passengers behaviors and crew ...\n\nNoël Coward f.e. wrote his \"Intimacy\" onboard a liner while crossing the Pacific.

Originally released at 91 minutes; surviving versions are usually cut to 62 minutes. A 74-minute version aired in 1998 on USA cable channel AMC. The DVD version runs just under 72 minutes. The film's working title was Lucky Break and is known as Para alcanzar la Luna in Spain. It is not to be confused with the Fairbanks silent film, Reaching for the Moon (1917)!\n\nThe film was originally intended to be a musical with songs written by Irving Berlin but problems soon developed. From the start, Berlin found Edmund Goulding, the director, difficult to work with. Also by mid-1930 the studio realized that the public’s demand for musicals had disappeared. So Goulding jettisoned many of Berlin’s songs from the score. Although just five Berlin songs had been recorded, the film, even in its scaled-down form, proved very expensive to make. By the time the filming was complete, the costs had come to about a million dollars, a huge budget for the times, and one that virtually ruled out the possibility of the film returning a profit.\n\nThe one song that was retained was `When the Folks High Up Do the Mean Low Down´ introduced by Bing Crosby who had filmed it late at night after completing his work a Variety commented on this song specifically, saying: \"None of the Berlin songs is left other than a chorus of hot numbers apparently named `Lower Than Lowdown´. Tune.\" It suddenly breaks into the running in the ship’s bar when Bing Crosby, of the Whiteman Rhythm Boys, gives it a strong start for just a chorus which, in turn, is ably picked up by Miss Daniels, also for merely a chorus, and then in an exterior shot to the deck where June MacCloy sends the lyric and melody for a gallop of half a chorus.\n\nWall Street wizard, Larry Day, new to the ways of love, is coached by his valet.

Howard\n\nI once had the luck watching Transatlantic ... but please don´t ask where ... when? in my late teens, so long long time ago.\n\nWhile researching for this article I found this film listed in IMBD, and remembered. Suddenly all the film came up from my stored memory. It was a fast paced movie, that may make you a bit breathless, fantastic cut and the plot intiguing.\n\nMade in the early-morning of talking pictures, this belies any notion you might have of early talkies, with fast editing, a deleriously moving camera, and sharp script. Sets are magnificent, with the luxury liner where the action takes place assuming the atmosphere of some Byzantine palace. Best of all, it's capped off with a tour-de-force cat-and-mouse shoot-out through the vast engine room, which James Wong Howe's photography turns into a visual wonderland-maze of catwalks, huge machines and glossy steam. Script, story and playing are all top-notch.\n\ncritic from IMBD\n\nopening of `Transatlantic´- screenshot\n\nTransatlantic is a 1931 American Pre-Code drama film directed by William K. Howard. It won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction by Gordon Wiles.\n\nEssaying Transatlantic here, but the film’s final few moments, a gun-in-hand, cat-and-mouse chase over the catwalks and up and down the ladders of the steamy bowels of an ocean liner, is as vividly expressionistic as anything you’ve seen in the noir movies of the forties and fifties.\n\nPractically unknown to a wider audience, Transatlantic, but it is not a forgotten film. Plenty of folks want or may want to see it, but just have not had the opportunity. It hasn’t been released on tape or disc, and, as far I know, it hasn’t aired on any of the classic movie channels, and it is conspicuously absent from those movie download sites on the Internet. But lucky me, I have seen the movie somewhere. You can purchased a copy. Transatlantic is an American film from William Fox. All of the spoken dialogue is in English, but I remember where the audience is shown a French newspaper page that helps develop the story, that was astonishing me back then. And perhaps I must have seen the movie in France, when visiting my aunt.\n\n`Transatlantic´ movie poster - Source: IMBD\n\nIt’s a singularly a remarkable film. The movie hasn´t got for no reason an Oscar: Gordon Wiles took home the statuette for art direction, though if there had been a prize for film editing awarded at the 1931-1932 ceremony, this film and editor Jack Murray would have won it. (There were just a dozen competitive awards that year; the editing category was still two years away.) Easily as noteworthy as the art direction - and to contemporary sensibilities probably moreso - is the trendsetting deep-focus photography of James Wong Howe, by 1931 already a virtuoso of the movie camera. Transatlantic has some astonishing visuals effects.\n\n`Transatlantic´ movie poster - Source: IMBD\n\nThere is very little dialogue in the opening sequence, though there is a cacophony of noise, as you might expect in a port of those days. The titular ocean liner is preparing to leave New York for England, and we are treated to the dizzying chaos surrounding departure, all characterized by a dazzlingly showy filmmaking. Five and a half minutes of crane shots, dolly shots, tracking shots, and zooms, high angles, low angles, long shots and close-ups, the rich and the poor, the young and the old, drunken, sober, elated, and in tears, steerage and first-class, passengers and crew, taxis and barking dogs. It’s a delightfully frenetic opening, compressing the entire hubbub of departure into a few superbly edited moments. And while such a pace can’t be maintained for long, the opening sets the expectation for a fast paced and exciting film, one book-ended with an expressionistic sequence that nearly matches it for sheer visual enjoyment.\n\n`Transatlantic´ Greta Niessen, norwegian-born actress, movie still - Source: IMBD\n\nNo one can claim that Transatlantic drags, though it necessarily has to slow down through its center. In the wake of the ship’s departure we get to know and travel with the passengers central to the story. I will not summarize the plot, as it is too long ago, when watching. But the narrative concerns a group of unrelated travelers from assorted circumstances whose shipboard lives intertwine in unexpected ways. Yet unlike many other films of the period, this is not a particularly plot-heavy film. And although it barely surpasses an hour, its cast of characters are all surprising well drawn and free of cliché and meet and interact. But one does not have the impression initially that the film is moving inexorably towards some resolution of story, that out ultimate goal is to find out “what happened”. Following this, it is possible to think of this as a sort of Grand Hotel at sea, though Transatlantic is more consciously visual, less star-driven, and churns on mystery rather than melodrama.\n\n`Transatalntic´, Edmund Lowe and Greta Niessen, movie still - Source: IMBD\n\nThe star is Edmund Lowe, who plays the mysterious, yet refined and tuxedoed Monty Greer. We assume he is a high stakes casino gambler or a gentleman thief, seemingly on the run. Also traveling are the Grahams (John Halliday and Myrna Loy). He is a wealthy financier and philanderer, she is the devoted, even if not so naïve wife. What she does not know, however, is that her husband’s bank just went belly-up, and he is absconding with the funds. The movie is set during the high tide of Grand Depression! The news of their misfortune catches up to them mid-voyage via the ship’s newspaper, sending into hysterics many of the ship’s other passengers, particularly the pedantic Mr. Kramer (Jean Hersholt), who heads for Graham’s cabin and a date with destiny…\n\n`Transatlantic´ movie promotion postcard - Source: IMBD\n\nThere’s more to learn about the characters, but I cannot get into that. The movie builds up to the gem of a climax I mentioned earlier, where Lowe uses a handgun to tie up all of the story’s loose ends. It would be a crime to give the thing away, but this scene in particular is what I fealt let me get away with writing Transatlantic up here, as well the entrence sequence. Anyone who sees the sequence cannot deny that it must have been highly influential to the generation of filmmakers who would immerse themselves in the noir style. Taking place entirely within the mechanical confines of the ship’s darkest and most inaccessible spaces, the machine room, Lowe chases his quarry through a warren of pipes and pistons, up ladders and across narrow grates, around corners over ledges. And through the steam - what steam! - I thought of the heat, despite it is in Black-and-White, billowing from countless valves seen and unseen, lit magnificently by countless well-hidden sources. It is tense, expressionistic, and highly stylized. The actors must have sweated off tremendously in the filming, and had a glorious time doing it.\n\nTransatlantic is an ultra-chic ART DECO character mystery. It reminds us that film can be a frustratingly and wonderfully nebulous art form, and that we aren’t quite as certain as we think we are.\n\nThis is a movie that deserves a good remake!\n\nOne Way Passage (1932)\n\nss Maloa\n\nDirector: Tay Garnett\n\nThere's much to like in this 24-day voyage across the Pacific from Hong Kong via Honolulu to San Francisco with William Powell and Kay Francis.

In Hong Kong, he meets Joan Ames (Kay Francis), a terminally-ill woman, in a bar. They share a drink, then Dan breaks his glass, followed by Joan. Police Sergeant Steve Burke (Warren Hymer) captures Dan when he leaves (though out of sight of Joan) and escorts his prisoner aboard an ocean liner crossing the Pacific to San Francisco. On board, Dan jumps into the water in a bid to escape, dragging a handcuffed (and non-swimmer) Steve with him, but spots Joan among the passengers and changes his mind. Once the ship is underway, he persuades Steve to remove his handcuffs. Dan and Joan fall in love on the month-long cruise, neither knowing that the other is under the shadow of death.\n\nBy chance, two of Dan's friends are also aboard, thief Skippy (Frank McHugh) and con artist \"Barrel House Betty\" (Aline MacMahon), masquerading as \"Countess Barilhaus\". The countess distracts Steve as much as she can to help Dan. Just before the only stop, at Honolulu, Steve has Dan put in the brig, but he escapes with their help and goes ashore. Joan intercepts him and they spend an idyllic day together. When they drive back to the dock, Dan starts to tell her why he cannot return to the ship, only to have her faint. Dan carries her aboard for medical help, forfeiting his chance. Later, Joan's doctor tells Dan about her condition and that the slightest excitement or shock could be fatal.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"countess\" has spent so much time with the policeman that a romance blooms between them. When they near the end of the voyage, he awkwardly proposes to her. She tells him her true identity, but he still wants to marry her. As Steve and Dan get ready to disembark, a steward overhears the grim truth and, when Joan comes looking for Dan, tells her. The two lovers part for the last time without letting on they know each other's secret, and Joan collapses after Dan is out of sight.\n\nThey had agreed to meet again on New Year's Eve, a month later.

Veith says Morgan seems to have no friends and never leaves the ship when it is in port.\n\nDr. Veith meets his old friend Dr. Bernhard (George Brent), who is desperate to sail on the sold-out ship because his wife Sybil (Vivienne Osborne) is on board, running away with her lover, the financier Alex Stevanson (Frank Morgan). Veith arranges for Bernhard to take his place. To Bernhard's surprise, his wife's cabin is empty; a maid suggests that she might board at Cherbourg.\n\nMilli Lensch (Alice White), a winsome young blonde who is traveling in third class, but eager to make her way up in the world, flirts with old Edward Thorndyke (C.

Schultz, one of Thorndyke’s former employees and now a company owner, comes down from 2nd class to invite Thorndyke (and Milli) to take tea with him tomorrow. Thorndyke turns him down, but Milli is delighted to accept.\n\nAfter the ship docks at Cherbourg, Bernhard goes to his wife's cabin, but she locks the door and refuses to see him. Bernhard is called away by a medical emergency before he can break the door down. Meanwhile, Stevanson is very pleased to encounter opera singer Luise Marheim (Verree Teasdale).\n\nStevanson sends a telegram ordering the purchase of German-American Steamship shares, causing other passengers to also rush to buy the stock. When the third-class passengers want to pool their meager funds to do the same, Thorndyke reluctantly offers to handle the transaction.\n\nMilli enjoys dancing in second class, although she fails to persuade Schultz to buy her a present. When Schultz's business acquaintance, jewelry dealer Exl (Theodore von Eltz), comes along, she gets him to invite her up to first class. This disappoints an elevator operator (Barry Norton) who has fallen for her and promised to show her New York. After a fine dinner and champagne, Exl takes Milli to his cabin and tries to force himself on her in return for a diamond bracelet. She flees to the arms of her elevator operator and realizes that she prefers to be poor but honorable.\n\nAfter Bernhard delivers a baby, he confronts his wayward wife. She tells him she never loved him. When Stevanson tries to intervene, Bernard punches him and leaves. Stevanson then has his things moved to another suite, much to Sybil's distress.\n\nSybil finds Stevanson dining with Luise. He tells Sybil their relationship is over and he will \"write her a check\" to be rid of her. In his stateroom, Sybil kills Stevanson with the pistol she stole from Bernhard's desk. Bernhard arrives moments afterwards and takes the blame. When Morgan cannot make him defend himself, she becomes greatly agitated and reveals that, five years ago, she had a husband and two children. After he left her for another woman, she tried to kill herself and her children. She was saved, but her babies died. Bernhard regrets that he did not meet her sooner. Sybil then jumps overboard, but not before leaving a note in which she admits killing Stevanson. Bernhard and Morgan decide to start a new life together as the ship pulls into New York.\n\nWith Stevanson dead, the value of German-American Steamship shares plummets.

He still loves her and agrees to patch up their marriage.\n\nHowever, it is soon evident that they have grown far apart. In Vienna, news of the birth of their first grandchild arrives; although initially excited, Fran is displeased with the idea of being a grandmother.

He asks Edith to marry him and fly with him to Samarkand and other exotic locales on his new venture. She gladly accepts.\n\nMeanwhile, Fran's idyllic plans are shattered when Kurt's mother (Maria Ouspenskaya) rejects his request to marry Fran. In addition to divorce being against their religion, she tells Fran that Kurt must have children to carry on the family line, and Fran would be an \"old wife of a young husband\". Kurt asks Fran to postpone their wedding until he can get his mother's approval; but Fran sees that it is hopeless, and calls off the divorce.\n\nFeeling a duty to Fran, Sam reluctantly decides to sail home with her, leaving Edith. However, after only a short time in Fran's now critical and demanding company, Sam realizes their marriage is irrevocably over. \"Love has to stop somewhere short of suicide\", he tells her.

He believes that she knows the real Mr. Corner alias Miller and can persuade the young woman to make contact with the alleged \"company president Miller\", for whom he thinks Viktor Müller is responsible. Susanne is, however, upset that Viktor Müller lied to her, as he is actually that Mr. Corner she has just heard from de la Tours.\n\nSpiel an Bord, Sun Deck Restaurant - screenshot\n\nMüller himself cannot quite interpret the confusion and Susanne's behaviour at first and tells his new friend Corner/Miller about it. A drink at the Schiffsbar now reveals Corners true identity. Slightly drunk, Viktor promises him to continue playing his own role as' President Müller/Miller' for the time being. After old Henning has handed over his stamp collection to him, the two crooks try to take it back from him, because they found out that Viktor Müller is not Mr. Miller alias Mr. Corner. To get rid of the stowaway, de la Tours and his accomplice try to throw him overboard. But Viktor, who now believes that Susanne must be the accomplice of the two men, can escape from the two at the last moment.\n\nThe following day, the Bremen arrives at the port of New York. De la Tour and Baron of Western are now in a hurry to get off the boat. But the supreme in-flight police officer, Miss Thistelmann, who travelled with her, incognito herself, has not fallen on her head and can arrest the two villains with the ship's own security personnel. And since it is currently in motion, she also wants to have the \"stowaway\" Viktor Müller, who has just returned his stamp collection to Mr. Henning, taken away. She is all the more surprised when he presents his first-class ticket to her. Then everything clears up: Müller is in reality a reporter on a business trip; he was supposed to write a report titled \"As a stowaway across the ocean\".

Lombard, playing an actress from Brooklyn pretending to be a Swedish princess, does a \"film-length takeoff\" on MGM's Swedish star Greta Garbo.

The musical featured an American dancer getting involved with a touring Russian ballet company.

He contrives to meet her, but she is less than impressed. They meet again on an ocean liner traveling back to New York, and Linda warms to Petrov. Unknown to them, a plot is launched as a publicity stunt \"proving\" that they are actually married. Outraged, Linda becomes engaged to the bumbling Jim Montgomery (William Brisbane), much to the chagrin of both Peters and Arthur Miller (Jerome Cowan), her manager, who secretly launches more fake publicity.\n\nPeters and Keene, unable to squelch the rumor, decide to actually marry and then immediately get divorced. Linda begins to fall in love with her husband, but then discovers him with another woman, Lady Denise Tarrington (Ketti Gallian), and leaves before he can explain.

They are both already engaged, he to heiress Lois Clarke (Astrid Allwyn), she to Kenneth Bradley (Lee Bowman). They begin to flirt and to dine together on the ship, but his notoriety and popularity on the ship make them conscious that others are watching. Eventually, they decide that they should dine separately and not associate with each other. At a stop at Madeira, they visit Michel's grandmother Janou (Maria Ouspenskaya), who approves of Terry and wants Michel to settle down.\n\nAs the ship is ready to disembark at New York City, the two make an appointment to meet six months later on top of the Empire State Building. Michel chooses six months because that is the amount of time he needs to decide whether he can start making enough money to support a relationship with Terry. When the rendezvous date arrives, they both head to the Empire State Building. However, Terry is struck by a car right as she arrives, and is told that she may not be able to walk, though that will not be known for certain for six months. Not wanting to be a burden to Michel, she does not contact him, preferring to let him think the worst. Meanwhile, Terry recovers at an orphanage teaching the children how to sing.\n\nSix months go by, and during Terry's first outing since the accident, the two couples meet by accident at the theater, though Terry manages to conceal her condition. Michel then visits her at her apartment and finally learns the truth. He assures her that they will be together no matter what the diagnosis will be.\n\nLove Affair film was remade by McCarey in 1957 as An Affair to Remember with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in the lead roles, using a very similar screenplay, and by Glenn Gordon Caron in 1994 as Love Affair, starring Warren Beatty, Annette Bening and, in her last feature film appearance, Katharine Hepburn.

Along with her equally larcenous father, \"Colonel\" Harrington (Charles Coburn) and his partner Gerald (Melville Cooper), she is out to fleece rich, naive Charles Pike (Henry Fonda), the heir to the Pike Ale fortune (\"The Ale That Won for Yale\"). Pike is a woman-shy snake expert Ophidiologist, just returning from a year-long expedition up the Amazon. Though surrounded by ladies desperate for his attention, Charles is putty in Jean's hands.\n\nBut even the best laid plans can go astray. First, Jean falls hard for Pike and shields him from her card sharp father. Then, when Pike's suspicious minder/valet Muggsy (William Demarest) discovers the truth about her and her father, Pike dumps her. Furious at being scorned, she re-enters his life masquerading as the posh \"Lady Eve Sidwich\", niece of Sir Alfred McGlennan Keith (Eric Blore), another con man who's been swindling the rich folk of Connecticut. Jean is determined to torment Pike mercilessly, as she explains, \"I've got some unfinished business with him - I need him like the axe needs the turkey.\"\n\nWhen Pike meets \"Eve\", he is so bewildered he constantly trips and falls over himself. Although Muggsy tries to convince him \"she's the same dame\", Pike reasons that Jean would never come close to his home without at least disguising herself, so he concludes the resemblance is only a coincidence. After a brief courtship, they marry, and on the train to their honeymoon, \"Eve\" begins to confess her past, dropping name after name after name of old boyfriends and lovers. Pike finally gets fed up and jumps off the train.\n\nNow separated, Jean's con team urges her to close the deal, saying she's got him over a barrel and can make a killing in a settlement. While Charles' father and lawyers are on the phone with her pleading to settle quickly, Jean says she doesn't want any money at all, just for Pike to tell her it's over to her face. Pike refuses, and through his father Jean learns that he's departing on another ocean voyage. She arranges her own passage, and \"bumps into\" Pike, just as they met before. \"Hopsie\" is overjoyed to see Jean again, and they instantly dash to her cabin where they mutually affirm their love for each other.

The film had a cameo appearance during the theatre scene in the movie Summer of '42.\n\nDrab Charlotte Vale (Bette Davis) is an unattractive, overweight, repressed spinster whose life is brutally dominated by her tyrannical mother (Gladys Cooper), an aristocratic Boston dowager whose verbal and emotional abuse of her daughter has contributed to the woman's complete lack of self-confidence. It is revealed that Mrs. Vale had already brought up three sons, and Charlotte was an unwanted child born to her late in life. Fearing that Charlotte is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, her sister-in-law Lisa (Ilka Chase) introduces her to psychiatrist Dr. Jaquith (Claude Rains), who recommends that she spend time in his sanitarium.\n\nAway from her mother's control Charlotte blossoms, and at Lisa's urging the transformed woman opts to take a lengthy cruise instead of going home immediately.

During the argument, Charlotte says she didn't ask to be born, that her mother never wanted her, that it's \"been a calamity on both sides.\" Mrs. Vale is so shocked that her once-weak daughter has found the courage to actually talk back to her, she has a heart attack and dies. Guilty and distraught, Charlotte returns to the sanitarium.\n\nWhen she arrives at the sanitarium, she is immediately diverted from her own problems when she meets Jerry's lonely, unhappy 12-year-old daughter Tina (Janis Wilson) who has been sent to Dr. Jaquith. Tina greatly reminds Charlotte of herself; both were unwanted and unloved by their mothers. Shaken from her depression, Charlotte becomes overly interested in Tina's welfare and, with Dr. Jaquith's permission, she takes her under her wing. When the girl improves, Charlotte takes her home to Boston.\n\nJerry and Dr. Jaquith visit the Vale home, where Jerry is delighted to see the changes in his daughter. While he initially pities Charlotte, believing her to be settling in her life, he's taken aback by her contempt for his initial condescension. Dr. Jaquith has allowed Charlotte to keep Tina there with the understanding that her relationship with Jerry will remain platonic. She tells Jerry that she sees Tina as his gift to her and her way of being close to him.

Despite the title, the action of the film never progresses across the Pacific, concluding in Panama.\n\nMary Astor and Humphrey Bogart on board the Japanese Genoa Maru - Source: Wikipedia\n\nThe title had been used before by Warner Brothers for a 1926 silent adventure film by the same name starring Monte Blue, who also has a small role in this film. However, the plots of the two films bear no resemblance to each other.\n\nInitially, it was planned that the film would portray an attempt to avert a Japanese plan to bomb Pearl Harbor. When the real-life Pearl Harbor bombing occurred, the script was quickly rewritten to change the location of the planned attack to Panama.\n\nDirector John Huston was called up to military service during filming; he claimed he left at the point near the end of the film in which Bogart is trapped in a house at gun-point. Vincent Sherman finished directing the film, minus the script which Huston took with him, explaining \"Bogie will know how to get out\". An implausible escape and plot wrap-up was shot, which Huston declared \"lacked credibility\".\n\nHumphrey Bogart and Mary Astor on board the GENOA MARU\n\nIn late 1941, Captain Rick Leland (Humphrey Bogart) is court-martialed and discharged from the U.S. Coast Artillery after he is caught stealing. He tries to join the Canadian Army, but is coldly rebuffed. He subsequently boards a Japanese ship, the Genoa Maru, in Halifax, apparently to make his way to China via the Panama Canal to fight for Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nOn board, he meets Canadian Alberta Marlow (Mary Astor) and Dr. Lorenz (Sydney Greenstreet), a professor of sociology who makes no secret of his admiration of the Japanese and is thus not popular in the Philippines, where he resides. Leland, in his turn, makes it clear to Lorenz that he has no loyalty toward his country and would fight for anyone willing to pay him.\n\nDuring a stop in New York, Leland, revealed as a secret agent trailing Lorenz, reports to Colonel Hart (Paul Stanton), an undercover Army Intelligence officer. Lorenz is a known enemy spy, but Hart and Leland are uncertain about Marlow. Upon returning to the ship, Leland surprises a Filipino man (Rudy Robles) who is about to shoot Lorenz, thus gaining Lorenz's confidence. Second-generation Japanese-American Joe Totsuiko (Victor Sen Yung) embarks as a passenger. Lorenz attempts to gather details from Leland concerning the military installations guarding the Panama Canal. Meanwhile, Marlow and Leland engage in a light-hearted romance.\n\nAs they arrive in Panama, the captain announces that the ship has been denied passage through the strategically vital canal and will be forced to take a long detour around Cape Horn. Leland, Marlow and Lorenz disembark to wait for another ship. Several crates are unloaded addressed to a Dan Morton at the Bountiful Plantation. Lorenz asks Leland, who was once stationed in the area, to procure up-to-date schedules for the American planes that patrol the canal. Leland meets with his local contact, A. V. Smith (Charles Halton), and convinces him to provide the real schedules, as Lorenz could easily find out if he were given fake ones. The date is December 6, 1941 – the eve of the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nHaving delivered the schedules after haggling with Lorenz over their price, Leland is knocked out. He wakes up several hours later and finds out that both Lorenz and Marlow have left the hotel. He immediately calls Smith and warns him to change the patrol schedule, then, on a tip from an informer (Philip Ahn) inside a movie theatre, heads out to the Bountiful Plantation, where he sees a torpedo bomber being prepared. He is captured, however, and brought inside to Lorenz, Marlow, and Totsuiko. Marlow turns out to be the daughter of the plantation's owner, Dan Morton (Monte Blue), a drunk whose weakness was exploited to provide a base for espionage activities. To Leland's relief, Marlow's only stake in the affair is concern for her father.\n\nLorenz reveals that they killed Smith before he could have the schedule changed, and that they are planning to torpedo the Panama Canal Locks. After Lorenz leaves for the landing field, Leland overpowers Totsuiko after the latter shoots Morton. Leland makes his way to the field where he takes over a machine gun and shoots down the bomber aircraft, piloted by no less than an Imperial Japanese prince, as it is about to take off. Leland dispatches Lorenz's men in the ensuing firefight. Returning to the house, he finds a defeated Lorenz attempting to commit seppuku, but his nerve fails him and he begs Leland to shoot him in the head. Leland refuses, saying his prisoner has \"a date with Army intelligence\".\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nSong of the Thin Man (1947)\n\nss Fortune, a gambling cruise, not a real liner ...\n\nDirector: Edward Buzzell\n\nHave you seen the Thin Man series with William Powell and Myrna Loy?

Nick then runs into Drake's band, allowed back on board to collect their instruments. When he questions them, he learns that the bandleader had many enemies, among them Buddy Hollis. Musician Clarence \"Clinker\" Krause agrees to help Nick track Buddy down, but they have no luck.\n\nNick and Nora visit a hostile Janet. The bullet that killed Drake likely came from an antique gun, and Nick knows Janet's father is an avid collector. Sure enough, he finds one gun missing from Mr. Thayer's collection. Janet leaves after getting a telephone call. Nick and Nora follow her to Fran's apartment. There they find Fran's body; she was stabbed in the back very recently. Janet claims Fran called to sell her some information, but that she got there after Fran was killed.\n\nNick finds a matchbook from a hotel in Poughkeepsie. That eventually leads him to a rest home where Buddy is undergoing treatment. The musician is too badly shaken up to answer Nick's questions, though Nora's presence seems to calm him down. When Nora sneaks back later by herself, Buddy becomes agitated, confesses to the murder, pulls out the antique gun, and tries to shoot Nora. Fortunately, he misses. Nick does not believe the deranged man's confession; Drake was slain by a well-aimed shot.\n\nNick decides to gather all the suspects together by arranging a party on the reopened Fortune and announcing that Buddy has fully recovered and will reveal the real murderer's identity that night. It is Nora who notices the vital clue. Amboy's wife shows up wearing a valuable necklace that matches the earrings of Mitchell Talbin's wife Phyllis. Sometime later, the necklace mysteriously reappears on Phyllis's neck. When Nick confronts Mitchell, Phyllis reveals that it was she who paid off her lover Drake's debt using the necklace. As Nick prompts Buddy to finger the killer, Mitchell finally confesses to both killings and pulls out a gun. An enraged Phyllis shoots him first, but her husband is only wounded. Then, despite Nick's pleas, she fires again and again, finishing the job.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nRomance on the High Seas (1948)\n\nss Southern Queen, this name must have been somehow intriguing in Hollywood those days ...\n\nDirectors: Michael Curtiz, Busby Berkeley\n\nIn Doris Day's very first film, she travels via Havana to Rio, two cities that are still on my bucket list. Before docking at the first port of her months-long voyage to South America, she falls in love with the detective who has been hired to follow her, as she is acting as the woman that is xxx in the mind of her jealous husband. Romance, the high seas, some high jinks, and Doris Day - what more could you want?\n\nss Santa Paula (later ss Akropolis) of Grace Line, second of four sister ships (the others being Santa Elena, Santa Lucia and Santa Rosa) are the fictional stage of `Romance on the High Seas´\n\nRomance on the High Seas, known in the United Kingdom as It's Magic, is a 1948 American Technicolor musical romantic comedy film directed by Michael Curtiz, and starred Jack Carson, Janis Paige, Don DeFore and Doris Day in her film debut. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, for Original Song for \"It's Magic\" (music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Sammy Cahn), and Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture (Ray Heindorf).\n\nElvira Kent (Janis Paige) and her husband Michael (Don DeFore) suspect each other of cheating. For their wedding anniversary, Elvira books an ocean cruise to Rio de Janeiro but her husband claims that unexpected business will prevent him from going. Seeing an opportunity, Elvira pretends to take the trip alone, but in fact sends singer Georgia Garrett (Doris Day), a woman she'd met at the travel agency, in her place and under her name. By secretly staying behind, Elvira hopes to find out if Michael is indeed sneaking around behind her back. Michael, however, is suspicious over Elvira's supposed willingness to go on the trip alone, and so hires private detective Peter Virgil (Jack Carson) to see if she is sneaking around behind his back.\n\nDoris Day, Mrs \"Saubermann\" with film partner Jack Carson - screenshot\n\nPeter joins the cruise and, as part of his job, becomes acquainted with Georgia. Georgia, following the instructions of the real Elvira, keeps up the ruse by pretending to be Elvira to everyone, including Peter. Georgia and Peter are attracted to each other and gradually fall in love, which causes conflict for both of them.\n\nDuring one of the cruise stops, Georgia's friend, Oscar Farrar (Oscar Levant), comes on board. Oscar is in love with Georgia despite Georgia's lack of interest in him, and when Peter spots them together, he thinks he has discovered the identity of Elvira's lover.\n\nThe film's third act is set in a Rio hotel, where all the principal characters converge and ride a merry-go-round of mistaken identities. Sorting out their true identities, resolving the crossed love plots, concludes the picture.\n\nOriginally conceived as a star vehicle for Betty Hutton, the film had to be recast when Hutton became pregnant, and thus unavailable. Other established stars like Judy Garland and Jane Powell were briefly considered, before Michael Curtiz was talked into auditioning Doris Day, a well-known band vocalist, but hitherto not considered an actress, despite some early appearances in 1940–1941 in a number of soundies. Her personal life was in some turmoil at the time, as her second marriage, to musician George Weidler, was ending, and this, combined with her evident nervousness, led her to deliver a notably teary, emotive version of Embraceable You at the audition. Impressed by her singing ability and fresh-faced good looks, Curtiz signed her to a film contract and cast her in the leading role of Georgia Garrett. Despite the change in star and the late casting of Janis Paige, the film was financially successful.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nLuxury Liner (1948)\n\na cross over from REX and CONTE DI SAVOIA with a hint of QUEEN MARY\n\nDirector: Richard Whorf\n\nThe trailer to MGM´s `Luxury Liner´ looks like a promotion for a cruise ...

Compounding her confusion, Ruth finds that she is registered solo under her maiden name in a different cabin and that none of the crew members who could have seen her husband on the ship remember him. These include the ship's purser, (Gayne Whitman), stewardess Anna Quinn (Mary Anderson), and second officer Jim Logan (Max Showalter).

Lorelei has a passion for diamonds, believing that attracting a rich husband is one of the few ways a woman can succeed economically. She is engaged to Gus Esmond (Tommy Noonan), a naïve nerd willing to do or buy anything for her. However, Gus is under the control of his wealthy, upper-class father. Dorothy, on the other hand, is looking for a different kind of love, attracted only to men who are good-looking and fit.\n\nLorelei plans to wed Gus in France, but Esmond, Sr. stops his son from sailing, believing that Lorelei is bad for him. Although Lorelei's job requires that she travel to France with or without Gus, before she leaves, Gus gives her a letter of credit to cover expenses upon her arrival, and promises to later meet her in France. However, he also warns her to behave, noting that his father will prohibit their marriage if rumors of misdeeds make their way to Esmond, Sr. Unbeknownst to both of them, Esmond, Sr. has hired a private detective, Ernie Malone (Elliott Reid), to spy on Lorelei.\n\nDuring the Atlantic crossing, Malone immediately falls in love with Dorothy, but Dorothy has already been drawn to the members of the (male-only) Olympic athletics team. Lorelei meets the rich and foolish Sir Francis \"Piggy\" Beekman (Charles Coburn), the owner of a diamond mine, and is attracted by his wealth; although Piggy is married, Lorelei naively returns his geriatric flirtations, which annoys his wife, Lady Beekman (Norma Varden).\n\nLorelei invites Piggy to the cabin she shares with Dorothy, whereupon he recounts his travels to Africa. While Piggy demonstrates how a python squeezes a goat by hugging Lorelei, Malone spies on them through the window and takes pictures of the two, but is caught by Dorothy as he walks away nonchalantly. She tells Lorelei, who fears for her reputation. They come up with a scheme to intoxicate Malone and then search him to recover the incriminating film while he is unconscious. They find the film in his pants, and Lorelei promptly prints and hides the negatives. Revealing her success to Piggy, she persuades him to give her Lady Beekman's tiara as a thank you gift. However, Malone reveals he had planted a recording device in Lorelei's cabin, and has heard her discussion with Piggy about the pictures and the tiara. Malone implies that Lorelei is a golddigger and, when Dorothy scolds him for his actions, admits that he himself is a liar. However, Dorothy reveals to Lorelei she is falling for Malone, after which Lorelei chastises her for choosing a poor man when she could easily have a rich man.\n\nThe ship arrives in France, and Lorelei and Dorothy spend time shopping. However, the pair are then kicked out of their hotel and discover Lorelei's letter of credit has been cancelled due to the information Malone shared with Esmond, Sr. When Gus shows up at their show, Lorelei rebuffs him, after which she performs Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend, the musical number whose lyrics explain why and how women need to pursue men with money. Meanwhile, Lady Beekman has filed charges regarding her missing tiara, and Lorelei is charged with theft. Dorothy persuades Lorelei to return the tiara, but the pair discover it is missing from her jewelry box. Piggy tries to weasel out of his part in the affair when Malone catches him at the airport.\n\nDorothy stalls for time in court by pretending to be Lorelei, disguised in a blonde wig and mimicking her friend's breathy voice and mannerisms. When Malone appears in court and is about to unmask \"Lorelei\" as Dorothy, she reveals to Malone in covert language that she, Dorothy, loves him but would never forgive him if he were to do anything to hurt her best friend, Lorelei. Malone withdraws his comments, but then reveals Piggy has the tiara, exonerating Lorelei.\n\nBack at the nightclub, Lorelei impresses Esmond, Sr. with a speech on the subject of paternal money, and also makes an argument that if Esmond, Sr. had a daughter instead of a son, he would want the best for her, to which he agrees and consents to his son's marriage to Lorelei. The film closes with a double wedding for Lorelei and Dorothy, who marry Esmond and Malone, respectively.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nThe fifths film - ? somehow I lost track - about TITANIC´s inaugural crossing ... a theme that will haunt us for some time ...\n\nTITANIC (1953)\n\nrms TITANIC\n\nDirector: Jean Negulesco\n\nThis is for me the final and la"
