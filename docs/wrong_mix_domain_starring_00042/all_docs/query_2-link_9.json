        "text": "Below is a list of animated movies from Walt Disney Pictures/The Walt Disney Company. For a list of live-action movies from the company, see List of Disney movies.\n\nThe following is a list of movies which are said to be the Walt Disney Feature Animation (WDFA) canon. They are also known as the Walt Disney Animated Classics. The canon includes animated movies that were or are being produced entirely by WDFA. Movies which are not part of the canon are movies which include both animation and live-action, spin-offs from Disney television programs, the direct-to-video movies produced by the DisneyToons studio in Australia (some of which received theatrical releases), or the Pixar movies (which Disney \"presents\" but does not produce). WDFA once announced that Home on the Range (released April 2, 2004) would be its final traditionally animated movie. They also said that from Chicken Little (released November 4, 2005) onwards, all future WDFA movies will be computer animated. However, this changed in July 2006 when a new traditionally animated movie, The Princess and the Frog, was revealed to be in development.\n\nColor legend Walt Disney Productions (1937–85)\n\nWalt Disney Feature Animation (1986–2006)\n\nWalt Disney Animation Studios (2007–present) Pixar Animation Studios (1995–present) Disney MovieToons (1990–2002)\n\nDisneytoon Studios (2003–14) Walt Disney Television Animation (1999–2004) Other Disney studio Third-party studio Live-action/animation hybrid sold as animation SA Live-action/animation hybrid sold as live-action SL Live-action/animation hybrid sold as Documentary SD Distribution only D\n\nTitle Original U.S. theatrical release date[rls 1] Site[st 1] Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs December 21, 1937[1][2] Walt Disney Productions and RKO Radio Pictures[3] Pinocchio February 7, 1940[4] Fantasia[SA] November 13, 1940[rls 2][5][6] The Reluctant Dragon[SA] June 20, 1941[7] Dumbo October 23, 1941[8] Bambi August 13, 1942[9] Saludos Amigos[SA] August 24, 1942[10] Victory Through Air Power[SD] July 17, 1943[11] Walt Disney Productions and United Artists[3] The Three Caballeros[SA] December 21, 1944[12] Walt Disney Productions and RKO Radio Pictures[3] Make Mine Music April 20, 1946[13] Song of the South[SL] November 20, 1946[14] Fun and Fancy Free[SA] September 27, 1947[15] Melody Time[SA] May 27, 1948[16] So Dear to My Heart[SL] November 29, 1948[17][18][19] The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad October 5, 1949[20] Cinderella February 15, 1950[21] Alice in Wonderland July 28, 1951[22] Peter Pan February 5, 1953[23] Lady and the Tramp June 22, 1955[24] Walt Disney Productions and Buena Vista Film Distribution[25] Sleeping Beauty January 29, 1959[26] One Hundred and One Dalmatians January 25, 1961[27] The Sword in the Stone December 25, 1963[28] Mary Poppins[SL] August 27, 1964[29][30][31][32] The Jungle Book October 18, 1967[33] The Aristocats December 24, 1970[34] Bedknobs and Broomsticks[SL] October 7, 1971[35] Robin Hood November 8, 1973[36] The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh[SA] March 11, 1977[37] The Rescuers June 22, 1977[38] Pete's Dragon[SL] November 3, 1977[39] The Fox and the Hound July 10, 1981[40][41] The Black Cauldron July 24, 1985[42] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Productions and Silver Screen Partners II The Great Mouse Detective July 2, 1986[43] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Feature Animation and Silver Screen Partners II Who Framed Roger Rabbit[SA] June 22, 1988[44] Touchstone Pictures[45] Amblin Entertainment and Silver Screen Partners III[46] Oliver & Company November 18, 1988[47] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Feature Animation and Silver Screen Partners III The Little Mermaid November 17, 1989[48][49] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Feature Animation and Silver Screen Partners IV DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp August 3, 1990[50] Walt Disney Pictures, Disney MovieToons The Rescuers Down Under November 16, 1990[51] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Feature Animation and Silver Screen Partners IV Beauty and the Beast November 22, 1991[52] Aladdin November 25, 1992[53] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Feature Animation The Nightmare Before Christmas October 29, 1993[54] Touchstone Pictures,[45] Skellington Productions The Lion King June 24, 1994[55] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Feature Animation A Goofy Movie April 7, 1995[56] Walt Disney Pictures, Disney MovieToons Pocahontas June 23, 1995[57] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Feature Animation Toy Story November 22, 1995[58] Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios James and the Giant Peach[SA] April 12, 1996[59][60] Walt Disney Pictures, Allied Filmmakers and Skellington Productions[st 2] The Hunchback of Notre Dame June 21, 1996[61] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Feature Animation Hercules June 27, 1997 [62] Mulan June 19, 1998[63] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida A Bug's Life November 25, 1998[64] Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios Doug's 1st Movie March 26, 1999[65] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Television Animation and Jumbo Pictures[66] Tarzan June 18, 1999[67] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Feature Animation Toy Story 2 November 24, 1999[68] Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios Fantasia 2000[SA] December 17, 1999[69] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Feature Animation The Tigger Movie February 11, 2000[70][71][72] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Television Animation and Walt Disney Animation Japan Dinosaur May 19, 2000[73] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Feature Animation and The Secret Lab The Emperor's New Groove December 15, 2000 [74][75][76] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Feature Animation Recess: School's Out February 16, 2001 [77] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Television Animation and Paul & Joe Productions Atlantis: The Lost Empire June 15, 2001[78][79][80] Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Feature Animation Monsters, Inc.
