        "text": "The collection was compiled by David Morgan, who acquired the images primarily through his professional career as a film journalist in the 1980s and as photo editor of a magazine for cable television subscribers. Most slides, transparencies, and photographic prints were furnished by movie studios as part of their films' press kits. A substantial number of items bear markings indicating that they were published at some point.\n\nThe collection dates from 1920 to 2000, with especially strong representation of film titles from the late 1970s through the 1980s, both new productions and older titles re-released on video. The stills are taken from popular Hollywood releases, more obscure independent films, and a few made-for-cable-television movies. Titles represented include: the Star Wars trilogy; the Star Trek series; Reds; The World According to Garp; Platoon; The Last Emperor; Silverado; Risky Business; and Road Warrior. Besides movie stills, a few poster art images, lobby card images, candid photographs of directors on set, and publicity portraits of actors are also included. The collection is chiefly comprised of color 35mm slides and black-and-white 8x10 inch prints. A smaller number of color 8x10 inch prints and larger transparencies are included.\n\nThe David Morgan collection of film stills are arranged in two series:\n\nImages are primarily slides, with some 8x10\" prints and larger transparencies.\n\nImages are 8x10\" prints."
