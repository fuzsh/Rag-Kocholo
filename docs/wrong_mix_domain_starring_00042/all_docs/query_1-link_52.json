        "text": "2012 - 2013 Eighth Annual National Youth Arts Awards!\n\nNational Youth Arts is excited to announce the winners of our Eighth Annual National Youth Arts Awards to honor outstanding work by youth in the arts. This year more than 300 productions were considered for the awards, including shows from more than 100 different theatres in more than 50 cities spanning 10 states. Formerly the National Youth Theatre Awards, we are now beginning to celebrate the other arts including Music, Dance, Film, and various other art forms. For information on how to get involved, please click here.\n\nThis year's award winners were selected from nominations by a panel of more than twenty judges and reviewers. In addition to the youth who performed in schools and youth theatre companies, anyone age 18 and under who performed at a show reviewed by a National Youth Arts judge was also considered for the awards, as well as the adults who participated in the youth productions backstage (directors, set designers, costume designers, etc.) and a limited number of guest adult performers in productions designed for youth. Thank you all for your incredible work and all the unforgettable entertainment over the past year!\n\nThe award winners will be formally presented with their awards on stage and nomination certificates will be available at the registration table for the nominees. The ceremonies honoring all of their accomplishments are held in different regions of the country including multiple ceremonies in California, Arizona, and one in New York City for the Eastern half of the country.\n\nAward winners are listed below by the area of the country in which they performed. If you can't make it to your ceremony, you might be able to attend one of the other ceremonies if you wish. Please RSVP using the link below.
