        "text": "Overview of the events of 1988 in film\n\nList of years in film\n\n+...\n\nThe following is an overview of events in 1988 in film, including the highest-grossing films, award ceremonies and festivals, a list of films released and notable deaths.\n\nThe top 10 films released in 1988 by worldwide gross are as follows:[1]\n\nHighest-grossing films of 1988 Rank Title Distributor Worldwide gross 1 Rain Man MGM $354,825,435 2 Who Framed Roger Rabbit Buena Vista $329,803,958 3 Coming to America Paramount $288,752,301 4 Crocodile Dundee II $239,606,210 5 Twins Universal $216,614,388 6 Rambo III TriStar / Carolco $189,015,611 7 A Fish Called Wanda MGM $188,597,000[2][3][4] 8 Cocktail Buena Vista $171,504,781 9 Big 20th Century Fox $151,668,774 10 Die Hard $141,500,000\n\nMay 25 – Rambo III is released as the most expensive film ever made with a production budget between $58 and $63 million. The film fails to match the box office earnings from Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985).\n\nJuly 15 – Die Hard defies low commercial expectations to gross $141.5 million worldwide. Hailed as an influential landmark in the action film genre, it influences a common formula for many action films in the 1990s, featuring a lone everyman against a colorful terrorist character who is usually holding hostages in an isolated setting.\n\nSeptember 19 – English character actor Roy Kinnear suffers a fall from a horse which will prove fatal while filming The Return of the Musketeers in Toledo, Spain.[5]\n\nOctober 10 – Batman officially commences filming at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England.\n\nOctober 27 – E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is released on VHS and laserdisc; to combat piracy, the tapeguards and tape hubs on the videocassettes are colored green, and the tape itself is affixed with a small, holographic sticker of the 1963 Universal logo (much like the holograms on a credit card), and encoded with Macrovision. In North America alone, VHS sales come to $75 million.[6]\n\nDecember 16 – Rain Man is released to critical and commercial success and becomes the highest grossing film of 1988 worldwide with a gross of $355 million. Winning four Academy Awards including Best Picture, it is the last MGM title to be nominated for Best Picture until Licorice Pizza (2021) 33 years later.\n\nCategory/Organization 46th Golden Globe Awards\n\nJanuary 28, 1989 42nd BAFTA Awards\n\nMarch 19, 1989 61st Academy Awards\n\nMarch 29, 1989 Drama Musical or Comedy Best Film Rain Man Working Girl The Last Emperor Rain Man Best Director Clint Eastwood\n\nBird Louis Malle\n\nAu revoir les enfants Barry Levinson\n\nRain Man Best Actor Dustin Hoffman\n\nRain Man Tom Hanks\n\nBig John Cleese\n\nA Fish Called Wanda Dustin Hoffman\n\nRain Man Best Actress Jodie Foster\n\nThe Accused\n\nShirley MacLaine\n\nMadame Sousatzka\n\nSigourney Weaver\n\nGorillas in the Mist Melanie Griffith\n\nWorking Girl Maggie Smith\n\nThe Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne Jodie Foster\n\nThe Accused Best Supporting Actor Martin Landau\n\nTucker: The Man and His Dream Michael Palin\n\nA Fish Called Wanda Kevin Kline\n\nA Fish Called Wanda Best Supporting Actress Sigourney Weaver\n\nWorking Girl Judi Dench\n\nA Handful of Dust Geena Davis\n\nThe Accidental Tourist Best Screenplay, Adapted Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal\n\nRunning on Empty Jean-Claude Carriere and Philip Kaufman\n\nThe Unbearable Lightness of Being Christopher Hampton\n\nDangerous Liaisons Best Screenplay, Original A World Apart\n\nShawn Slovo Ronald Bass and Barry Morrow\n\nRain Man Best Original Score Maurice Jarre\n\nGorillas in the Mist John Williams\n\nEmpire of the Sun Dave Grusin\n\nThe Milagro Beanfield War Best Original Song \"Two Hearts\"\n\nBuster\n\n\"Let the River Run\"\n\nWorking Girl N/A \"Let the River Run\"\n\nWorking Girl Best Foreign Language Film Pelle the Conqueror Babette's Feast Pelle the Conqueror\n\nPalme d'Or (Cannes Film Festival)\n\nPelle the Conqueror (Pelle erobreren), directed by Bille August, Denmark\n\nGolden Lion (Venice Film Festival)\n\nLa leggenda del santo bevitore (The Legend of the Holy Drinker), directed by Ermanno Olmi, Italy / France\n\nGolden Bear (Berlin International Film Festival)\n\nRed Sorghum (Hong gao liang), directed by Zhang Yimou, China\n\nList of American films of 1988\n\nList of Argentine films of 1988\n\nList of Australian films of 1988\n\nList of Bangladeshi films of 1988\n\nList of British films of 1988\n\nList of Canadian films of 1988\n\nList of French films of 1988\n\nList of Hong Kong films of 1988\n\nList of Indian films of 1988\n\nList of Hindi films of 1988\n\nList of Kannada films of 1988\n\nList of Malayalam films of 1988\n\nList of Marathi films of 1988\n\nList of Tamil films of 1988\n\nList of Telugu films of 1988\n\nList of Japanese films of 1988\n\nList of Mexican films of 1988\n\nList of Pakistani films of 1988\n\nList of South Korean films of 1988\n\nList of Soviet films of 1988\n\nList of Spanish films of 1988\n\nList of action films of 1988\n\nList of animated feature films of 1988\n\nList of avant-garde films of 1988\n\nList of comedy films of 1988\n\nList of drama films of 1988\n\nList of horror films of 1988\n\nList of science fiction films of 1988\n\nList of thriller films of 1988\n\nList of western films of 1988\n\nJanuary 3 -
