The project was in early development at the Walt Disney Studios with no director, producer, or screenwriter attached yet. Since then, there has been no new news about the project.[83]\n\nIn January 2022, Jennifer Lee revealed that Stella Meghie, writer and director of Tiana, wanted to develop a live-action adaptation of The Princess and the Frog.[84]\n\nScrapped projects[]\n\nA live-action film based on Prince Charming (of Cinderella and other fairy tales), titled Charming, entered development in 2017 with Stephen Chbosky writing and directing.[85] A prequel to Aladdin titled Genies, written by Mark Swift and Damian Shannon and produced by Tripp Vinson, was announced in 2015.[86] In March 2016, the studio announced a new film in development titled Rose Red, a live-action spin-off of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which was to be told from the perspective of Snow White's sister, Rose Red.[86][87] The film was to be produced by Vinson and pitched by Justin Merz, based on a script by Evan Daugherty.[87]\n\nAlan Menken confirmed that one Disney Classic film, Pocahontas, will not be remade as a live-action adaptation in the near future. According to Menken, it is deemed impossible due to modern sensibilities.[88]\n\nReception[]\n\nBox office performance[]\n\nMany Disney remakes rank along the highest grossing films upon their release; currently, The Lion King (8th), Beauty and the Beast (19th), Aladdin (39th), and Alice in Wonderland (45th) are on the list. The Lion King is also the highest grossing animated film of all time[lower-alpha 18] and the highest-grossing musical film of all time. It also set the record for the biggest opening for an animated film and a musical before Frozen II surpassed both records in November that year.\n\nFilm U.S. release date Box office gross All-time ranking Budget Template:Ref heading U.S. and Canada Other territories Worldwide U.S. and Canada Worldwide The Jungle Book December 25, 1994 $43,229,904 N/A N/A 1,950 3,098 $30 million [91] 101 Dalmatians November 27, 1996 $136,189,294 $184,500,000 $320,689,294 428 422 $75 million [92] 102 Dalmatians November 22, 2000 $66,957,026 $116,654,745 $183,611,771 1,186 898 $85 million [93] Alice in Wonderland March 5, 2010 $334,191,110 $691,276,000 $1,025,467,110 65 44 $200 million [94] The Sorcerer's Apprentice July 16, 2010 $920,209,293 $293,203,201 $283,928,929 284 28 $291 million Maleficent May 30, 2014 $241,410,378 $517,129,407 $758,539,785 138 93 $180 million [95] Cinderella March 13, 2015 $201,151,353 $342,363,000 $543,514,353 201 179 $95 million [96] The Jungle Book April 15, 2016 $364,001,123 $602,549,477 $966,550,600 48 43 $175 million [97] Alice Through the Looking Glass May 27, 2016 $77,041,381 $222,415,643 $299,457,024 1,011 470 $170 million [98] Beauty and the Beast March 17, 2017 $504,014,165 $759,506,961 $1,263,521,126 14 16 $160 million [99] Christopher Robin August 3, 2018 $99,215,042 $98,529,335 $197,744,377 746 834 $75 million [100] Dumbo March 29, 2019 $114,766,307 $238,518,314 $353,284,621 592 371 $170 million [101] Aladdin May 24, 2019 $355,559,216 $695,134,737 $1,050,693,953 51 34 $183 million [102] The Lion King July 19, 2019 $543,638,043 $1,113,305,351 $1,656,943,394 11 7 $260 million [103] Maleficent: Mistress of Evil October 18, 2019 $113,929,605 $377,800,484 $491,730,089 608 220 $185 million [104] Mulan September 4, 2020 —[lower-alpha 19] $69,965,374 $69,965,374 —[lower-alpha 19] 2,429 $200 million [105] Cruella May 28, 2021 $86,103,234 $142,914,031 $229,017,265 897 702[106] $100 million [107] Total $Template:Val $Template:Val $Template:Val N/A N/A $Template:Val N/A\n\nCritical and public response[]\n\nFilm Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic CinemaScore The Jungle Book (1994) 80%[108] 63[109] A−[110] 101 Dalmatians 41%[111] 49[112] A[110] 102 Dalmatians 31%[113] 35[114] B+[110] Alice in Wonderland 51%[115] 53[116] A−[110] The Sorcerer's Apprentice 40%[117] 84 B−[110] Maleficent 54%[118] 56[119] A[110] Cinderella 83%[120] 67[121] A[110] The Jungle Book (2016) 94%[122] 77[123] A[110] Alice Through the Looking Glass 29%[124] 34[125] A−[110] Beauty and the Beast 71%[126] 65[127] A[110] Christopher Robin 72%[128] 60[129] A[110] Dumbo 45%[130] 51[131] A−[110] Aladdin 57%[132] 53[133] A[110] The Lion King 52%[134] 55[135] A[110] Maleficent: Mistress of Evil 39%[136] 43[137] A[110] Lady and the Tramp 65%[138] 48[139] N/A Mulan 73%[140] 66[141] N/A[lower-alpha 19] Cruella 75%[142] 59[143] A[110] Pinocchio 27%[144] 38[145] N/A\n\nAcademy Award wins and nominations[]\n\nFilm Category Recipient Result Template:Ref heading 102 Dalmatians Costume Design Anthony Powell Nominated [146] Alice in Wonderland Art Direction Robert Stromberg and Karen O'Hara Won [147] Costume Design Colleen Atwood Visual Effects Ken Ralston, David Schaub, Carey Villegas, and Sean Phillips Nominated Maleficent Costume Design Anna B.
