Zeenat Aman is a renowned Bollywood actress who broke all stereotypes and created the image of a contemporary Indian woman with\n\ngrace and elegance.\n\nFLO President, Jayanti Dalmia said, “We at FLO believe that everyone has a story. But stories that touch our hearts, expand our minds, and inspire our spirits are powerful and must be told. These are STORIES THAT MATTER!! Zeenat Aman’s story embodies in its own special way, what we need today to foster women empowerment – great courage, inspirational optimism, and true zest for life!”\n\nVeteran actor Zeenat Aman believes her journey in Indian cinema was defined by characters with grey shades that ultimately led filmmakers to write interesting roles especially for her.\n\nLooking back at her journey in the film industry, the Bollywood star, who ruled the 70s and 80s with hits such as “Satyam Shivam Sundaram”, “Hare Rama Hare Krishna”, “Qurbaani”, “Dhund”, “Don”, “Manoranjan” and “Yaadon Ki Baarat”, said people accepted her in unconventional characters.\n\nShe added about her career, “My journey in Indian cinema started when I was a teenager and I stopped working when I became a mother. Along the way, there were many milestones. I had the good fortune of working with a lot of actor-directors like Dev Anand, Raj Kapoor, Shammi Kapoor, Manoj Kumar, Amjad Khan, Feroz Khan and Sanjay Khan. All these filmmakers were actors themselves. So they brought that extra bit of creativity to the table.”\n\nZeenat Aman was last seen in Ashutosh Gowarikar’s period drama Panipat in 2019. She will soon be making her OTT debut and has completed two web series.\n\nThe event was well attended by FLO Presidium, Past Presidents, Governing Body Members from pan India and FLO & YFLO members.\n\nVinita Bimbhet, Past President FLO moderated the session. Tehmina Khandwala, Chapter Chair FLO Mumbai was the Day Chair for the event."
