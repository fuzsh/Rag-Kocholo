        "text": "Veteran actress Zeenat Aman walked down memory lane as Norwegian Govt. issued stamps honoring her contribution to Indian cinema. Sharing an interesting story of using these stamps, the senior actress penned a long note alongside the post which reads, “I was thrilled by this novel gesture of appreciation, but wasn’t sure whether the stamps would actually work. So the very next morning, I bought a ream of postcards, wrote out messages to my friends, slapped a ‘Zeenat Aman’ stamp onto each, crossed my fingers, and dropped the cards into a postbox.”\n\nShe continues, “some weeks later, when I was back in Bombay, I began to receive texts and calls from my friends. All of whom were exclaiming with delight, having received my postcards in the mail!”\n\nThe senior actress wrote as a concluding note, “I suppose a limited number of these stamps were released and that they are out of print now. I’ve kept my few remaining sheets carefully though, since I really did feel honoured by this gesture.”\n\nTake a look at Zeenat Aman’s Instagram post"
