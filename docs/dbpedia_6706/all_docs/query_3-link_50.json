        "text": "Aamir Khan (born March 14, 1965, Bombay [now Mumbai], India) is an Indian film actor who was known for his consistent performances and intelligent choice of scripts. His insistence on a complete script before shooting and working on only one film at a time heralded a new professionalism in Bollywood.\n\nKhan was born into a family of filmmakers: his father, Tahir Hussain, was a producer; uncle Nasir Hussain was a leading producer-director in the 1970s; and cousin Mansoor Khan was also a director. In 1973 Aamir began his film career with a role in the hit drama Yaadon ki baaraat (Procession of Memories). However, after appearing in Madhosh (1974; “Drunk”), he did not return to the big screen again until Holi (1985).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nKhan debuted as a lead actor in Qayamat se qayamat tak (1988; “From Doom to Doom”), directed by Mansoor Khan. The film, a tragic love story backed by memorable music, was a hit and established Khan’s image as the boy next door. After a series of mediocre movies, he again found box-office success with Dil (1990; “Heart”) and Dil hai ke manta nahin (1991; “The Heart Doesn’t Understand”). In 1992 Khan solidified his reputation as an audience favourite with the teen musical Jo jeeta wohi sikandar (“He Who Wins Is King”).\n\nAfter appearing in a number of youthful romantic roles, Khan in the mid-1990s began to show his versatility by playing characters in a variety of genres. His flair for comedy earned particular praise in such films as Andaz apna apna (1994; “Everyone Has Their Own Style”); Rangeela (1995; Bollywood Dreams), in which he was cast as a street-smart orphan coping with his childhood sweetheart’s sudden rise as an actress; and Ishq (1997; “Love”). He also appeared in a number of acclaimed dramas, including Raja Hindustani (1996), for which he won a Filmfare Award for best actor, and Deepa Mehta’s Earth (1998), in which he portrayed an ordinary man made ruthless by circumstances. For his performance in Lagaan (2001; also released as Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India), Khan won another Filmfare Award; the internationally acclaimed historical drama also received an Academy Award nomination for best foreign-language film.\n\nKhan’s later movies included Mangal Pandey: The Rising (2005), in which he starred as Mangal Pandey, a leading revolutionary in the Indian Mutiny (1857–58); the comedies 3 Idiots (2009) and PK (2014), both of which were among the highest-grossing movies in Bollywood history; and the musical Secret Superstar (2017). In 2007 Khan made his directorial debut with Taare zameen par (Like Stars on Earth); he also starred in that critically acclaimed drama.\n\nKhan was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 2010, one of the Indian government’s highest civilian awards."
