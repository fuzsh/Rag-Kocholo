        "meta_description": "Veteran actress Zeenat Aman has been ruling social media since her debut in February this year. The actress reigned the 70s with her acting, free-spirited attitude and killer looks. She recently opened up on the importance of financial independence for women saying it will help them in taking 'control of their own future'. During an interaction with Kusha Kapila on her show Swipe Ride, Zeenat said, 'Every woman should be confident and capable of financially supporting themselves. This allows them to make choices for themselves and control their own future. When women have financial resources and opportunities at their disposal, they can overcome obstacles, pursue their passions, and make decisions that align with their goals and dreams.' She then clarified that 'Being financially independent isn't just about having money' and added, 'it signifies the freedom to live life on one's own terms, without relying on others. It's a way to achieve fairness, make their own choices, and evolve into the best version of oneself.' The actress is known for her work in several hit movies like, 'Hare Rama Hare Krishna', 'Yaadon Ki Baarat', 'Don', 'Roti Kapda Aur Makaan', and 'Laawaris'.
