        "text": "Ever since she made her Instagram debut, veteran actress Zeenat Aman has been spilling the beans about her personal and professional life. On Sunday, the ‘Satyam Shivam Sundaram’ actress opened up about whether she is making a comeback on the silver screen or not. Taking to Instagram, Zeenat penned a long note, which read, “There’s been some speculation that my presence here is the precursor to my return to the silver screen. I am a notoriously private person, and I suppose this sudden sharing has set tongues wagging. The truth is that I have been in the public eye since I was 16-years-old, and have experienced the perils of being misquoted, taken out of context, censored, and gossiped about. Now as a septuagenarian I am enjoying the opportunity to reflect on my life and career in my own words. That too without any pressures from managers or studios or brands.”\n\nRaveena Tandon\n\nStar dedicates her Shiv Ratri celebration to late father\n\nRaveena Tandon’s Shiv Ratri celebration was a personal one this year as the actor spent the day in Kashi reliving her father’s memories. Taking to Instagram on Saturday, the ‘Mohra’ actor posted a string of pictures from Kashi. She dedicated a diya on the Ganges in the name of her father, whose birth anniversary was observed on Friday. Raveena wrote in the caption, “Day 1. #kashi. I finally let a piece of you go .. that I will hold on in my heart forevers.. a send off papa, on your birthday and Mahashivratri, couldn’t get better .. from Dusk to Dawn .. did the entire Kashi Vishwanath with you and then bade you a happy goodbye. Love you always! Jai Shiv Shankar Bholenath! Har Har Mahadev! Har Har Gange Maiya !”\n\nFreida Pinto\n\nActor to be seen in ‘Boy At the Back of the Class’ adaptation\n\nFreida Pinto has joined the cast of the family film “The Boy at the Back of the Class,” based on the beloved children’s book. According to Variety, a US-based media house, not just Freida, Vanessa Redgrave will also be seen in the project. The enigmatic new youngster, Ahmet, who enrols in nine-year-old Alexa’s school, is the focus of Stephen Herek’s (“101 Dalmations”) film. Last year, Freida Pinto and her husband Cory Tran welcomed their first child together. In an October 2021 Instagram post, Pinto revealed that she and Tran eloped a year prior. “Yes, yes, it’s true. One year ago, I married this gorgeous man of my dreams. No, we were not keeping it a secret or anything. We were simply just enjoying life and happily shared the news with anyone who asked,” she wrote."
