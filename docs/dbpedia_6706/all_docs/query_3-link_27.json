        "text": "Consultant / Employee Dilemma When we sign up to work for a business, do we pledge our services to the business or the entrepreneur? An entrepreneur’s ego about their own personal ability to swing things around sometimes is the single biggest risk to a business. At such critical times, do we counsel the entrepreneur about realities and humility or do we meekly submit to the entrepreneur fully aware that it could get dirty? It is human for any entrepreneur to fall into a God complex, but a strong team can still keep him/her grounded, sane and aware. But, the people around get dazzled themselves, forgetting their roles and become cheerleaders. Is that the silent job requirement I wonder. If things go south, the entrepreneur faces the music, but this band of leaders that turned cheerleaders are seldom penalised from straying the path of prudence. Sometimes, disagreeing and defiance is the best form of service I have offered, because it is the most valuable thing to do.\n\nBook 23, 2024 Breath from Salt - Bijal P Trivedi Possibly my first book in this genre. I have always refrained from reading about diseases and patient stories. Losing both my grandparents to cancer, psychologically I feel scarred and tend to shut out diseases and the pain thereof. This book is about a disease I heard for the very first time, Cystic Fibrosis, a kind of a lung ailment that is caused at birth due to genetic mutations between genes of parents and results in child mortality and stunted growth and development of children. O’Donnell family is the central fulcrum of this story, who in the memory of their son Joey played the most significant role in finding a medicinal solution to the disease. It is a story of resilience and hope. When a single person or a group of people come together keeping their self interest aside, they can well and truly bring a Change, a good solid change. The group of families losing their loved ones come together to raise funds, awareness, push for research and eventually convert into a successful medical process to cure cystic fibrosis.\n\nBook 22, 2024 Working Backwards - Colin Bryar & Bill Carr Amazon is an inspiring story of our times, using technology as a resource it addressed a challenge quite effectively. This book explains how Amazon functions in detail. Decentralised structure with the balance between autonomy, ownership and accountability is a striking feature of tying up diverse businesses on the same platform. The vision and execution comes through a lot of challenges as different people and perspectives jostle ultimately to make the overall product and process better. Leadership is tough, messy work. I took away some good ideas and learnings from this book and the Amazon way of doing things!\n\nJust some weekend reading about Q2 results update of Berkshire Hathaway, the Apple stock trimming is mostly a big one, but this quarter was the biggest ever stock sale by Buffet. Almost to the tune of $70b. It is almost 10 times more than the sell off in Covid scare. The company now sits on a record $277b cash, and it continues to accumalate more cash by selling. If this is a tell, the liquidity ride in USA looks like it is over and a long winter awaits. There have been murmurs of recession late last week and a red friday. It is amazing how Buffet continues to stay relevant and ahead of curve doing things like a seasonsed pro. With elections due, US is heading into a high inflationary recessionary cycle that is unprecedented ever in last 100 years."
