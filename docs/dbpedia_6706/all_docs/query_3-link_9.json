        "text": "I want Priyanka Chopra Jonas to do my biopic. I think she is very good and lovely. Priyanka would be the ideal actress to play my part.\n\nI just think that I was very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with some very fine filmmakers in the industry. I worked with some wonderful people on some really interesting projects. So I consider myself very fortunate.\n\nYou know why stardom screws up people ? Because it gives you too many choices. As a 20-year-old I was making as much money as, well, as much money as it was possible for a 20-year-old to make in India. That sort of thing could drive people nuts. But I put my in money in the bank.\n\nTo make a breakthrough in Hollywood, you have to be committed to doing it, which is true of anything in life. I was already a big star in India and I stayed with that.\n\nNobody ever thought of me as dumb. They always knew me as cerebral, a thinking person. Educated and so on. But I was always given glamorous roles.\n\nFilms are financed by men, written by men and mostly about men. Leading men were always paid a lot more than the leading ladies. There were very few films that were women-oriented or where we had skillful female technicians at the time. But there has been a change and I am really happy for that.\n\nIn cinema, I would not really rate my costar and I would not pick a project because of the costar. I would pick a project because of the director. And the script.\n\nIt is inherent in every girl, to want that extra sparkle in her eyes, extra shine in her hair and bounce in her walk.\n\nI had worked with many actors who were angry at times and often found them to be tense.\n\nLike every other girl or woman I had imagined and visualized a totally different picture of a married life in my head. But in reality it was nothing like it. Mazhar was never there whenever I needed him. Even when I was pregnant, he was not there to support me or be happy with me."
