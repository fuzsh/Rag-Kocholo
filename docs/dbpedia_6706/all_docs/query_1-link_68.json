        "text": "Zeenat Aman, the timeless beauty of Bollywood, isn’t just known for her iconic roles but also for her impactful presence on social media. As an iconic actress, she maintains an active presence on social media, as she uses the platform to inspire young girls and address essential issues. From discussions on animal welfare to interesting facts from her past, she knows how to use social media in a meaningful way. In a recent post, the Don actress shared a sweet picture from a wedding and exposed a side of her that many may not expect. Zeenat disclosed that the fancy designer outfits and accessories she wears at events are actually not hers, but they’re borrowed. With the post, the veteran wants to encourage young individuals not to overspend on new outfits.\n\nThe actress posted a picture of herself as she posed with her son Zahaan Khan and his partner, Cara Tejpal. Dressed in blue ethnic wear, Zeenat wrote, “This picture of Zahaan, Cara and I was taken at a beautiful family celebration in Delhi last week. I’ll take this opportunity to let you in on a secret too. Most of the fancy designer outfits that I wear to such occasions are borrowed. The jewellery I have was loaned to me by Vimal from Argentum and this powder blue sharara was sent to me by my dear friend Mohini Chabria. It will be dry cleaned and returned.”\n\n“I’m sharing this because I don’t want young people to feel pressured to buy new outfits or spend beyond their means just because they see celebrities in designer clothes. Whether you borrow, thrift or buy, what matters is that you don’t break your bank and actually enjoy what you wear. And of course, in my books, comfort is key. In fact, I’ve thrown out all my high heels,” she added.\n\nFurther, Zeenat Aman also shared a personal anecdote from her own wedding and revealed that it was a private and simple affair. She explained that she eloped with her husband and got married in Singapore with only two witnesses present. Despite her reserved nature, she admits that she can’t resist the charm and excitement of a typical, big Indian wedding.\n\nSince Zeenat Aman shared the post, it has become a source of inspiration for many. Her fans, particularly her female followers and well-known personalities from the industry have been admiring the veteran star.\n\nFilmmaker Farah Khan wrote, “Love you Zeenat. You’ve always been the classiest woman I know.”\n\nArchana Puran Singh added, “We’ve known each other for oh so many years Zee, shared a moment or two and then some and then you present this even more utterly charming and disarming side of you that is totally so so endearing and heartwarmingly honest and gracefully penned. Loads of love and respect added to the admiration and affection I have always had for you. Much love and salute.”\n\nChitrangda Singh stated, “You’re setting such a beautiful example.” Zeenat Aman tied the knot with actor Mazhar Khan in 1985 and the couple had two sons named Azaan Khan and Zahaan Khan."
