        "text": "Indian actor, film producer, politician (1942–2012)\n\nRajesh Khanna (pronounced [rɑːˈdʒeːʃ kʰənˈnə]) (pronunciationⓘ; born Jatin Khanna; 29 December 1942 – 18 July 2012) was an Indian actor, film producer and politician who worked in Hindi films. Considered as one of the greatest and most successful actors in the history of Indian cinema, he is known as the first Superstar of Indian cinema.[3][4] His accolades include five Filmfare Awards, and in 2013, he was posthumously awarded the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour.\n\nKhanna made his debut in 1966 Aakhri Khat which was India's first official Academy Awards entry in 1967.[5] In 2005, he was honoured with the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award on the 50th anniversary of the Filmfare Awards.[6][7] He was a Member of Parliament in the 10th Lok Sabha from New Delhi Lok Sabha constituency between 1992 and 1996, elected in the 1992 New Delhi by-election as an Indian National Congress candidate.[8] He was married to Dimple Kapadia in March 1973, eight months before her debut film Bobby was released and had two daughters from the marriage. Their elder daughter Twinkle Khanna is an actress who is married to actor Akshay Kumar, while they also have a younger daughter Rinke Khanna.[9]\n\nKhanna died on 18 July 2012, after a period of illness.[10] He has been honoured with a stamp and statue in his likeness, and a road renamed after him by the Prime Minister of India.\n\nEarly life and background\n\n[edit]\n\nRajesh Khanna was born on 29 December 1942, in Amritsar in the Punjab Province of British India,[1] as 'Jatin Khanna' into a Punjabi Hindu Khatri family.[11][12][13][14] He was adopted and raised by Chunnilal Khanna and Leelawati Khanna,[15] who were relatives of his biological parents. His father had migrated from West Punjab to Gali Tiwarian in Amritsar. His biological parents were Lala Hiranand Khanna and Chandrani Khanna. Lala worked as headmaster of the MC High School in Burewala (in present-day Vehari District, Punjab, Pakistan).[16][17] His adoptive parents belonged to a family of railway contractors who had moved from Lahore to Bombay in 1935.[18] Khanna lived in Saraswati Niwas,[19] in Thakur-dwar near Girgaon, Mumbai.\n\nHe attended St. Sebastian's Goan High School with his friend Ravi Kapoor, who later took the stage name Jeetendra.[20] Khanna gradually started taking an interest in theatre, did many stage and theatre plays in his school and college days, and won many prizes in inter-college drama competitions.[21]\n\nIn 1962 Khanna played a wounded mute soldier in the play Andha Yug and impressed with his performance; the chief guest suggested that he get into films soon.[22] Khanna became a rare newcomer who had his own MG sports car, who once struggled to get work in theatre and films in the early 1960s.[23]\n\nKhanna did his first two years of Bachelor of Arts at Nowrosjee Wadia College in Pune from 1959 to 1961.[24] He later studied at Kishinchand Chellaram College, Mumbai and Jeetendra studied at Siddharth Jain College. Khanna tutored Jeetendra for his first film audition. Khanna's uncle KK Talwar changed Khanna's first name to Rajesh when he decided to enter films.[25] His friends and his wife called him Kaka (meaning a baby faced boy in Punjabi).[26]\n\nActing career\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly works (1966–1968)\n\n[edit]\n\nRajesh Khanna was one of eight finalists from more than 10,000 contestants in the 1965 All India Talent Contest, organised by United Producers and Filmfare, along with other FTII students Subhash Ghai and Dheeraj Kumar.[27] [28] Khanna won the contest along with Farida Jalal.[29] BR Chopra, Bimal Roy, GP Sippy, HS Rawail, Nasir Husain, J.Om Prakash, Mohan Saigal, Shakti Samanta and Subodh Mukherji and others had created the United Producers organisation and were then judges of the contest.[18]\n\nHe made his film debut in the 1966 film Aakhri Khat, directed by Chetan Anand, followed by Raaz (1967), directed by Ravindra Dave, both of which were a part of his predetermined prize for winning the All-India United Producers' Talent Competition.[30] G.P. Sippy and Nasir Hussain were the first to sign Khanna after he won the contest.[31]\n\nBeing under contract with United Producers, he got projects, such as Aurat (1967) and Baharon Ke Sapne (1967), both of which were commercially unsuccessful.[33][34]\n\nSuperstardom (1969–1974)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe year 1969 proved to be a game changer for Khanna and saw his rise to superstardom.[35] It began with Shakti Samanta's romantic musical Aradhana co-starring Sharmila Tagore.[36] The film went to become a massive blockbuster at the box office and made him and overnight sensation.[37] Its soundtrack composed by S. D. Burman and lyrics written by Anand Bakshi was the third best-selling Hindi film album of the 1960s and made Kishore Kumar the leading playback singer of Hindi cinema.[38][39] That same year, he starred in Raj Khosla's romantic family drama Do Raaste opposite Mumtaz.[40] Backed up with chartbuster songs, including \"Yeh Reshmi Zulfen\", \"Bindiya Chamkegi\", \"Chup Gaye Saare Nazaare\", it went a step ahead and emerged an All Time Blockbuster, in turn making Khanna and Mumtaz a hit pair.[41][42] In the United Kingdom, the film was released in 1970. It became the first Indian film to gross £100,000 in the UK, equivalent to ₹900,000 (US$118,940.64). Its UK box office record was broken a year later by Purab Aur Paschim, which released in the UK in 1971.[43] The mega success of Aradhana and Do Raaste was followed by a superhit in Narendra Bedi's romantic drama Bandhan again with Mumtaz and hits in Adurthi Subba Rao's drama film Doli alongside Babita and Yash Chopra's songless mystery thriller Ittefaq co-starring Nanda.[44] These films turned Khanna into a Superstar and marked the beginning of Rajesh Khanna Mania of the early 70s.[45][25] He continued his domination at the box office in 1970 and 1971 with films, such as – The Train, Sachaa Jhutha, Safar, Aan Milo Sajna, Kati Patang, Mehboob Ki Mehndi, Anand, Andaz, Maryada and Haathi Mere Saathi, eventually giving 15 consecutive hits in a span of three years, a record which remains unbroken till date.[46][47] Khanna won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor for playing a double role in Sachaa Jhutha.[48] He won his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor and first BFJA Award for Best Actor (Hindi) for portraying a cancer-patient in Anand which is also considered his career-best performance by many of his fans as well as critics.[49]\n\nKhanna began 1972 with Dulal Guha's drama film Dushmun and Shakti Samanta's romantic drama Amar Prem.[50][51] While Amar Prem was a hit, the former emerged a blockbuster and was later remade in Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada.[52][53][54] For portraying a man stuck in any unhappy marriage in Amar Prem and a rash truck driver in Dushmun, Khanna received nominations in the Filmfare Award for Best Actor category.[55] His next release, the action drama Apna Desh also performed extremely well at the box office and added one more blockbuster in his kitty.[56] It also had some highly popular songs like \"Duniya Mein Logon Ko\", \"Kajra Lagake Gajra Sajake\", \"Ro Na Kabhi Nahin Rona\".[57] In the late 72, Khanna's amazing run came to an abrupt halt as six of his films flopped. These were – Badnam Farishte, Bawarchi, Joroo Ka Ghulam, Mere Jeevan Saathi, Maalik and Dil Daulat Duniya.[58] Out of these releases, Hrishikesh Mukherjee's musical comedy drama Bawarchi is regarded as a cult classic today and was remade in many Indian languages, including Hindi itself.[59] It also won Khanna his second BFJA Award for Best Actor (Hindi).[60] In spite of the minor setback, Khanna concluded the year on a satisfactory note with a semi-hit in Shehzada and another blockbuster with Anuraag in which he had an extended cameo appearance.[61] Khanna's first release of 1973 was Sachin Bhowmick's romantic drama Raja Rani in which he starred alongside his Aradhana co-star Sharmila Tagore.[62] Despite huge expectations, it ended up as a commercially unsuccessful venture.[63] After this, he reunited with Tagore for Yash Chopra's maiden production and sixth directional venture Daag: A Poem of Love which also had Rakhee in the lead.[64] Inspired from Thomas Hardy's novel The Mayor of Casterbridge, it was a major critical and commercial success, eventually emerging a blockbuster and laying the foundation of Yash Raj Films (which is the biggest production house in India till today).[65][61] Its soundtrack composed by Laxmikant–Pyarelal dominated the musical charts and was one of the best selling Hindi film albums of the 1970s.[66] His final release that year was the social drama film Namak Haraam which also opened to positive response from critics and proved to be a superhit at the box office.[67][68] Khanna received his fifth nomination in the best actor category at the Filmfare Awards for Daag and won his third BFJA Award for Best Actor (Hindi) for Namak Haraam. 1974 was a great year for Khanna with both critical and commercial appreciation coming his way. His first film Humshakal performed poorly at the box office, but his second release Aap Ki Kasam which was also J. Om Prakash's debut as a filmmaker proved to be a superhit.[69] All of its songs were major hits too, especially \"Zindagi Ke Safar Mein Guzar Jate Hain Jo Maqaam\" sung by Kishore Kumar.[70] This was followed by Prem Nagar which was a remake of Akkineni Nageswara Rao's all time Telugu hit Prema Nagar (1971).[71] Prem Nagar like the original opened to excellent response from the audience, eventually doing more business than Khanna's last major hit Aap Ki Kasam and emerging a blockbuster.[61] Basu Bhattacharya's art-house film Avishkaar and Shakti Samanta's crime thriller Ajanabee were his next two releases.[72][73] While Ajanabee did reasonable business and proved to be a semi-hit, Avishkaar was a commercial flop, but a huge critical success and won Khanna his third and final Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his subtle portrayal of a disillusioned husband.[74] His last film of the year was Manmohan Desai's action drama Roti which released alongside another biggie Roti Kapada Aur Makaan, but still went on to become a blockbuster at the box office.[61] Due to its huge success, Roti was also remade in Telugu as Neram Nadi Kadu Akalidi (1976).[75]\n\nCareer fluctuations, comeback and further works (1975-1990)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe declaration of emergency in 1975 had angered the masses and this helped films having the lead character revolting against corruption and establishment to become successes. The shift from romantic and social movies to action oriented multi-starrers changed the box office equation and saw the emergence of a new Superstar in the form of Amitabh Bachchan.[76] With Bachchan's rise and his poor choice of films in the mid 1970s, Khanna suffered a major career setback and eventually, lost his superstardom.[77][78]\n\nIn 1975, Khanna starred alongside Shashi Kapoor and Mumtaz in Raj Khosla's Prem Kahani and did a guest appearance in the war film Aakraman.[79][80] The former emerged a box office hit, but his contemporaries, including Bachchan, Dharmendra and Manoj Kumar had bigger hits in their kitty with Sholay, Deewaar, Pratiggya and Sanyasi, which were also among the top 5 highest-grossing films of the year.[81][82] Khanna's career declined and eventually hit rock-bottom between 1976 and 1978 with almost all his films during this period proving to be critical and commercial failures.[83] These films included Mehbooba, Maha Chor, Bundal Baaz, Tyaag, Aashiq Hoon Baharon Ka, Karm, Chalta Purza, Palkon Ki Chhaon Mein, Bhola Bhala, Naukri, Chakravyuha, which were directed by Shakti Samanta, Narendra Bedi, Shammi Kapoor, Din Dayal Sharma, J. Om Prakash, B.R. Chopra, Bhappi Sonie, Meraj, Satpal, Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Basu Chatterjee respectively.[84][85][86][87] Joy Mukherjee's suspense thriller Chhailla Babu (1977) opposite Zeenat Aman was his only major success in these 3 years.[88] Khanna was the first choice of director Raj Kapoor for the lead role in Satyam Shivam Sundaram (1978), but some members from the Raj Kapoor camp opposed his presence. Many other reasons are stated but the role eventually went to Shashi Kapoor.[89] After a string of flops and critically panned films, Khanna delivered a hit in Amar Deep (1979), for which he also received a nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Actor category.[69][90]\n\nHe began the 80s with Bharathiraja's psychological thriller Red Rose.[91] A remake of blockbuster Tamil film Sigappu Rojakkal, the film couldn't repeat the success of original and flopped commercially.[92] His next release was Esmayeel Shroff's family drama Thodisi Bewafaii opposite Shabana Azmi.[93] It performed well at the box office and proved to be a hit with Khanna receiving his 12th nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Actor category and Kishore Kumar winning Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the song \"Hazaar Rahen Mud Ke Dekhin\".[94][95] His other releases of the year were - Danny Denzongpa's horror thriller Phir Wahi Raat, Anil Ganguly's drama film Aanchal and K. Bapaiah's romantic drama Bandish.[96][97][98] While Aanchal was a commercial failure, Phir Wahi Raat and Bandish emerged moderate box office successes.[99] In 1981, he co-starred alongside Raaj Kumar, Vinod Khanna, Hema Malini and Priya Rajvansh in Chetan Anand's reincarnation drama Kudrat.[100] In spite of blockbuster music and presence of some of the biggest stars of the time, Kudrat was rejected at ticket counters and proved to be a commercial debacle.[101][102] Khanna's next release, Dard again with Malini met the same fate, however Dhanwan opposite Reena Roy was an average success.[103] His final release of the year Shomu Mukherjee's Fiffty Fiffty co-starring Tina Munim also did average business.[104] 1982 proved to be a decent year for Khanna as he starred in successful multi-starrers like Rajput, Ashanti and Dharam Kanta.[105] He also played a brief role in the superhit dance film Disco Dancer.[106] It became the first Indian film to gross ₹1 billion worldwide.[107] The Disco Dancer soundtrack was popular worldwide, particularly in India, the Soviet Union, and China.[108] It went Platinum in India,[109] equivalent to 1 million sales,[110] and received a Gold Award in China.[108] One of the song from film, \"Goron Ki Na Kalon Ki\" sung by Suresh Wadkar and filmed on Khanna went on to become a chartbuster.[111]\n\nAfter almost a decade of lukewarm success, Khanna made a notable comeback in 1983.[112] His first release Nishaan didn't do well, but his second release, Mohan Kumar's Avtaar went on to become a blockbuster & was among the highest-grossing films of the year.[113] Khanna received his 14th and final nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Actor category for Avtaar.[114][115] His next release was Saawan Kumar Tak's romantic drama Souten co-starring Tina Munim and Padmini Kolhapure.[116] It was the first Hindi film ever to be shot in Mauritius and had a chartbuster soundtrack composed by Usha Khanna with songs \"Shayad Meri Shaadi Ka Khayal\" and \"Zindagi Pyaar Ka Geet Hai\" topping the musical chart that year.[117] The film emerged a superhit and also one of the best selling Hindi film albums of the 1980s.[118][101] Khanna completed his hat-trick with another hit in Lekh Tandon's Agar Tum Na Hote.[119] With three back-to-back hits in 1983, he proved that audience still adored him.[34] Khanna's successful run continued in 1984 with a superhit in K. Bapaiah's Maqsad, which took 2nd spot at the box office that year, hits in Naya Kadam and Dharm Aur Qanoon, followed by a plus venture in Asha Jyoti; however, the year 1985 proved to be a mixed bag for him. While five of Khanna's films, Hum Dono, Masterji, Bewafai, Durgaa and Babu emerged commercial successes, rest six were box office flops, including biggies, such as Zamana, Aakhir Kyon? and Alag Alag (which he also produced).[120][121][122]\n\nThe following year, he reunited with Mohan Kumar for Amrit opposite Smita Patil.[123] It received positive response from critics as well as the audience with Khanna winning his fourth and final BFJA Award for Best Actor (Hindi) for portraying a distraught old man.[124] His other successful films of the late 1980s, include Adhikar (1986), Nasihat (1986), Nazrana (1987) and Ghar Ka Chiraag (1989).[125][126]\n\nIn 1990, he starred in David Dhawan's drama film Swarg.[127] An adaptation of Ashok Kumar and Sunil Dutt starrer Mehrban (1967), it went on to become a hit and established Dhawan's career as a director.[128] Swarg also proved to be the last major success of Khanna's career.[129]\n\nSabbatical, work in television and later career (1991–2012)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1991, Khanna had three releases – Begunaah, Rupaye Dus Karod and Ghar Parivar.[130] After this, he quit acting for sometime to focus on his political career.[131] From 1992 to 1998, he had only two releases - Khudai (1994) and the much delayed Sautela Bhai (1996), both of which sank without a trace. In 1999, Khanna appeared in Rishi Kapoor's directional debut Aa Ab Laut Chalen.[132] Despite being hugely hyped before its release, the film received negative reviews from critics and ended up as a below average grosser.[133][134]\n\nIn the 2000s, he tried to make a comeback with films, such as Pyaar Zindagi Hai (2001), Kyaa Dil Ne Kahaa (2002), Wafa: A Deadly Love Story (2008), but none of them could re-establish him.[135][136][137] Khanna's final film appearance was in Ashok Tyagi's much delayed action film Riyasat, which released after his death in 2014.[138] It was panned by critics across the board and was a box office flop.[139][140]\n\nKhanna appeared in a rare interview in the show Aap Ki Adalat in 1992, where he quoted to the interviewer Rajat Sharma, \"I would just ask if I am arrogant, how come all these producers made so many films with me. My fans who turned this actor into a superstar would have never accepted me if I was arrogant. If I was arrogant people would not have made me a Lok Sabha member because if someone is arrogant, that arrogance is visible. And this public knows everything and understand everything\".[141]\n\nKhanna was a life member of the International Film And Television Research Centre, the International Film And Television Club and the Asian Academy of Film & Television.[142] He was Faculty Guest of \"Specialised Cinema Courses At Asian School Of Media Studies\". On 10 April 1999 Khanna inaugurated the live concert of S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, held at Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium, Hyderabad as a tribute to R. D. Burman.[143] In 2001 and 2002, Khanna played the lead in two television serials: Aapne Parai (B4U and DD Metro) and Ittefaq (Zee TV).[144] He performed in a video album based on Tagore's songs (Rabindra Sangeet) without payment.[145] He also endorsed Star se Superstar tak – a talent hunt programme in 2007 and donated a Gold Trophy of Rs.1 crore. In its Silver Jubilee Episode on 14–15 March 2008, K for Kishore aired a Rajesh Khanna special. He signed on to star in a TV serial with Creative Eye Banner, (Dhiraj Kumar) in 2007, and in 2008 performed in a TV serial, Bhabhima, with Leena Ganguly as his co-star. His successful TV serial Raghukul Reet Sada Chali Aayi began in November 2008 and ended in September 2009.[146] Khanna cited the lack of good roles for actors like him in films as the reason for him not appearing much in films after 2001. He said in an interview on being queried about his decision to do TV serials: \"The reach of TV is much more than cinema today and one episode of my serial is likely to be watched by more people than a super-hit film\".[147] In May 2012, Havells, the fan making company endorsed Khanna as Brand Ambassador for their new ad campaign featuring him in solo advertisements.[148]\n\nInspirations and influence\n\n[edit]\n\nKhanna considered Guru Dutt, Meena Kumari and Geeta Bali to be his idols. Khanna said in an interview: \"My inspirations include Dilip Kumar's dedication and intensity, Raj Kapoor's spontaneity, Dev Anand's style and Shammi Kapoor's rhythm.\"[32] In an interview given to The Hindu in 2011, Khanna specially mentioned Mahanayak Uttam Kumar, the greatest actor of Bengali cinema, as his idol. In that interview, Khanna also claimed that Uttam Kumar was the greatest living actor of his time.[149]\n\nPolitical and business career\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the insistence of Rajiv Gandhi, Khanna started campaigning for Indian National Congress after 1984.[150] In the election for New Delhi seat in the 1991 Lok Sabha election, Khanna lost to L.K. Advani by a narrow margin of 1589 votes, after which Khanna stood on the grounds at the counting station insisting that he had been cheated of a win.[151] In 1992, a by-election was called after the resignation of the incumbent Member of Parliament L.K. Advani. Khanna contested the seat again, won the by-election by defeating Shatrughan Sinha by 25,000 votes.[152] Khanna was a member of Parliament for the Indian National Congress, from the New Delhi constituency, where he won the 1992 by-election, retaining his seat until 1996 after which he was not interested in active politics. When Khanna was MP, he did not accept new acting assignments, but only acted in the film Khudai (1994).[131] After leaving parliament, he was a political activist for the INC and campaigned for the party till the 2012 Punjab election.[153]\n\nKhanna and a group of foreign investors bought land in Shirdi, on which he built a religious resort for disciples of Sai Baba.[154]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Khanna fell in love with the then fashion designer and actress Anju Mahendru.[155] They were in a relationship for seven years. Khanna's sudden stardom and his insistence that Mahendru quit her acting career eventually ended their relationship.[156] Mahendru states that the couple did not speak to each other for 17 years after the break-up.[157]\n\nLater Khanna – 31 at that time – married the budding actress Dimple Kapadia who was then 15 years old, in March 1973, before Kapadia's debut film Bobby released in September that year.[158] Khanna and Kapadia have two daughters from the marriage; Twinkle and Rinke.[159] Khanna and Kapadia separated in 1982, but never completed the divorce proceedings. According to Yasser Usman's biography of Khanna, the couple separated because Kapadia wished to return to acting. She had quit acting when she married Khanna since the latter wanted his partner to be a housewife. A few years after their marriage Kapadia decided to resume her career. However, Khanna remained adamant that his wife will not work. Kapadia eventually left Khanna and started her career in films.[160][161] Khanna and Kapadia however maintained an amicable relationship where they both were seen together at parties and family functions. Kapadia also campaigned for Khanna's election and worked in his film Jai Shiv Shankar (1990), although the film never got released.[162]\n\nIn the 1980s, Tina Munim was in love with Khanna. She had been a fan of him since her school days.[163] They appeared in ten films together between 1981 and 1986. According to website Bollywood Mantra, Khanna refused to marry her as their marriage would have a bad impact on his daughters.
