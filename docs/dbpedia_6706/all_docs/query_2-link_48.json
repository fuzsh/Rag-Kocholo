        "text": "From a native girl walking past the alleys of the countryside doing her daily chores to a girl in a group of hippies smoking pot and singing, “Dum Maaro Dum”, actress Zeenat Aman never failed to add oomph to all the roles she played. The flair with which she would disguise herself into the characters of a cheerful dancer, a woman of steel-will and a vamp with vicious motive, changed the spectrum of female projection which was rather narrowed with singular aspects of a woman’s personality.\n\nBorn to Hindu- Marathi mother and Amanullah Khan, the famous scriptwriter who went with his nom de plume Aman, worked in the yesteryear films like Pakeezah and Mughal-e-Azam. Zeenat was born and brought up in Bombay and later went ahead by adopting her father’s name as her last name. After the separation of her parents, she was brought up by her mother in Bombay and then proceeded to complete her higher studies at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, but she couldn’t complete her graduation.\n\nShe stepped into the world of modelling at a very young age of 19, and later, in the year 1970, she claimed the crown of Femina Miss India and Miss Asia Pacific International pageants. Her success in modelling career shaped her path in the filmy career as well but with initial flops in films like Hungama, Hulchul and The Evil Within, she made up her mind to leave for Germany with her mother. This is when Bollywood star Dev Anand spotted her and asked her to stay and act in his movie, Hare Rama Hare Krishna. Several actresses like Tanuja and Zaheeda declined the role, for playing Dev Anand’s sister onscreen didn’t suit their pursuit.\n\nDev Anand proposed that if his movie, Hare Rama Hare Krishna doesn’t fare well at the box office, she should leave for Germany. Things rolled up and the movie was released, it fared so well that Zeenat won the Filmfare Best Supporting Actress award for the film, followed by Bengal Film Journalists’ Association award as Best Actress for the same. From here on, Zeenat didn’t look back and embarked on her glamourous journey in Bollywood.\n\nHer personality set a benchmark for a modern young woman on the screen, who wasn’t afraid to express her love and do what she wills for. Bollywood started showcasing the bold and beauty combined in the female protagonist of Hindi cinema, her characters like Roma in Don was the time when her career was at its peak.\n\nThe song, Chura Liya Hai Tumne Jo Dil Ko from Yaadon ki Baaraat, wherein she expresses her love while playing the guitar on a private occasion remains evergreen, for she stole many hearts after the film was released. Her other big project after Hare Rama Hare Krishna was Satyam Shivam Sundaram, which was directed by Raaj Kapoor. Shashi Kapoor was her co-star who falls for Roopa, unaware of the scar on her face. The film explored the concept of beauty, love and devotion to singing, and was a blockbuster. However, it came under the scanner for some of the bold scenes which had to be censored by the film board."
