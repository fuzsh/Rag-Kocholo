He died when Zeenat was a 13-year-little girl. Zeenat has adopted her father’s name as her surname (Aman).\n\nZeenat Aman has also participated in many contests. She was the second runner up in Miss India beauty pageant (1970). She was the first woman from India to win the title of ‘Miss Pacific Asia’ (1970). She also represented India in Manila and won another title ‘Miss Photogenic’.\n\nAlthough most of the people consider ‘Hare Rama Hare Krishna’ as her debut film, she had done two films before it, namely ‘Hulchul’ (1971) and ‘Hungama’ (1971).\n\nZeenat Aman was the third choice for the character of Janice/Jasbir Jaiswal. She got the role because none of the first two (Mumtaz and Zaheeda) agreed to play Dev Anand‘s sister in the movie.\n\nZeenat was disappointed with the failure of her first two movies and became non-serious about her acting career. She was about to leave the country with her mother and step father even before the release of ‘Hare Rama Hare Krishna’, but Dev Anand insisted her to stay until the release. The commercial success of the movie forced her to re-thing about continuing as an actress in Bollywood.\n\nShe broke away from the stereotype, when she refused bouffants and let her silky and shiny tresses fall on to her shoulders freely. She hardly dressed in sarees and suits and rather gracefully flaunted her beautiful body in a ‘bikini’.\n\nAlong with Hema Malini, she was the highest paid female actor.\n\nZeenat Aman went with makeup of a burnt face and with a village girl getup to Raj Kapoor. She told him that it was her interpretation of ‘Rupa’ (the lead character of ‘Satyam Shivam Sundram’, 1978). He was really impressed with her effort and immediately signed Zeenat for the lead role and gave her some gold guineas as signing amount.\n\nShe had real bad experience with her married life. She got divorced in one year of her marriage with Sanjay Khan and was also assaulted by his first wife. Also in her second marriage, nothing went well, she again got disheartened and left her husband after a 12-year-long troubled marriage.\n\nZeenat Aman gained more popularity with the song ‘Chura liya hai’ from the movie ‘Yadon ki Barat’ (1973). Interestingly, Zeenat was supposed to wear a salwar suit in the song, which she is wearing before the song in the movie. But she changed the dress for the song saying, “I am not comfortable. Because it’s not me”.\n\nIn an interview she admitted that she got married not because she wanted a life partner, but she wanted to become a mother.\n\nZeenat Aman was named the Most Beautiful Vegetarian of 2023 along with actor Jackie Shroff by PETA India on 19 December 2023."
