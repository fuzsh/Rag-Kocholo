        "text": "Veteran Bollywood actress Zeenat Aman took to social media to extend her heartfelt wishes for the holiday season and share glimpses of her recent sojourn in Goa. In an Instagram post, the iconic star encouraged her followers to reflect on the past year, count their blessings, and brace themselves for the future.\n\nZeenat Aman shares Goa diaries, reflects on a whirlwind year; see post\n\nZeenat Aman wrote in caption, “Season’s greetings, my dears! Now is the time to reflect on the past 12 months, count your blessings, and fortify yourself for what’s to come.”\n\nAman further added, “You know it’s been a whirlwind year for me, and my cup truly runneth over. I’ll be bringing in the new year from the comfort of my home, but I must share a few photographs and recommendations from my stay in Goa earlier this month. The trip was a mixed bag of work and play. I thoroughly enjoyed the Bhanu Athaiya retrospective at the Aguad Fort, ate some excellent meals at Casa Noni and Second House, glimpsed some of the exhibits at the Serendipity Arts Festival, enjoyed a juice at the charming cafe at Sunaparanta, watched sunset over Anjuna beach, and shopped for trinkets at the beautifully named Whale Song store. I was hosted, as always, @birdsongmoira , a quiet haven to return to at the end of each day. These photographs are all from around the house.”\n\nShe concluded with, “Have a wonderful day. Tell your near and dear ones how much you love them. And please drink responsibly!”\n\nZeenat Aman is an Indian actress and a former model. The Evil Within (1970), starring Dev Anand, marked the former beauty queen's acting debut. She has acted in films like Yaadon Ki Baarat, Qurbani, Dharam Veer, Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Insaaf Ka Tarazu among others. The actress will soon return to the silver screen with Faraz Arif Ansari’s next, Bun Tikki. The film will also feature Shabana Azmi. As per reports, the plan is to take the movie on floors by November of this year in Himachal Pradesh. The director plans to talk about parenting and gender identity throughout the movie. Abhay Deol will play the role of a father in the film.\n\nAlso Read: Zeenat Aman celebrates 500K followers on Instagram: “It has been an invigorating experience”\n\nBOLLYWOOD NEWS - LIVE UPDATES"
