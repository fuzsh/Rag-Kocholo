You can update your choices at any time in your settings.\n\nZeenat Aman was a prominent Bollywood actress in the 70s & 80s, always known for her modern, westernized roles in Indian cinema. She was featured in an ad film for CRED almost a year ago, but just like her, her impact on that ad seems timeless. CRED is known for its creative and somewhat quirky marketing strategies, especially during the IPL seasons when it garners a massive viewership. In fact just last month they launched another ad with Ila Arun too. Illa Arun is known for her distinctive voice and vibrant personality, especially in roles that highlight Indian culture and traditions.\n\nZeenat Aman and Ila Arun were featured primarily because of their iconic image and unique appeal which simply attract a broad audience.\n\nHere's why Zeenat Aman and Ila Arun were particularly effective choices\n\nNostalgia Marketing\n\nBy featuring these legendary stars, CRED triggers the nostalgia feeling of older generations who grew up watching Zeenat Aman's films and listening to Ila Arun's music. Nostalgia in marketing acts as a powerful tool to evoke positive emotions and memories, which leads to a deeper emotional engagement with the brand.\n\nBroad Appeal\n\nBoth celebrities have a timeless appeal, Featuring them can bridge the gap between generations. Older generations admire them and also younger audiences who might be familiar with them through their parents or classical cinema and music. This cross-generational appeal broadens the audience and relatability for a brand like CRED.\n\nBrand Positioning\n\nCREDâ€™s brand positioning is that of a premium, exclusive platform, and associating with high-profile figures in the entertainment industry helps reinforce this position. Zeenat Aman has been perceived as an elegant and graceful persona while Ila Arun is associated with cultural depth, both brand images complement CRED's image as a sophisticated and trustworthy service.\n\nDifferentiation\n\nUsing such iconic yet unexpected brand ambassadors differentiates CRED from other finance-related apps which often rely on more conventional advertising strategies. They have been successful in maintaining a distinctive, satirical tone with their advertising which makes them stand out in a crowded market.\n\nMarketing Voice\n\nCRED was misunderstood to be another complicated fintech application and had a more international brand vibe. By including figures like Zeenat Aman and Ila Arun it manages to showcase an appreciation of Indian culture and arts, transforming its identity as a brand deeply rooted in Indian values yet modern in its approach.\n\nBy choosing Zeenat Aman and Ila Arun, CRED has effectively blended modern financial services with vintage Bollywood and Indian culture, making a memorable impression on its users."
