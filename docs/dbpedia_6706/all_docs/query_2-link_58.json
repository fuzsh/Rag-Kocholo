        "meta_description": "Actress Zeenat Aman recently took a trip down memory lane and revealed how Dev Anand did not like having choreographers and hairdressers on his set. During an event to commemorate Dev Anand’s birth anniversary, the veteran actress shared 'His films had no hairdressers. They would otherwise make bouffants and different hairstyles. But he wanted a plain look with just a parting.' Talking about why the legendary actor didn’t have any choreographers, she said, 'He also didn’t like dance directors as they would come and teach on counts. He didn’t want all of that and would just ask one to move by the natural rhythm of the body and their mood.' Although Zeenat Aman made her debut in 1970, she rose to fame after starring with the late actor in the film 'Hare Rama Hare Krishna'. The two actors also shared a close bond, with the 'Guide' actor even confessing in his book about being in love with the actress. A couple of weeks ago, the 'Don' actress, while celebrating 100 years of Dev Saab, shared old photos with him and penned, 'Stylish, suave and prolific, he was a dynamo beyond compare. And what generosity of talent! He sparked careers (mine included), brought together creative heads, and made films that resonated across generations.' Dev Anand passed away in 2011 after suffering a cardiac arrest. For more news and updates, stay tuned to ETimes.",
