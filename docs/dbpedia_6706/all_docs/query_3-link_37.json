        "text": "Femina's Fab 40\n\nWhat’s better than reading a motivational quote? Reflecting on the journeys of inspiring women and drawing positivity, strength, and resolve from them! These 40 women have demonstrated that they can achieve all they put their minds to and, through sheer will power, break barriers in their way. Their journeys this year are sure to ignite your soul. From our ardent President to unrelenting scientists, from the country’s top actors to trailblazing influencers, from entrepreneurial geniuses to spirited athletes and more, let’s celebrate them all...\n\nZeenat Aman\n\nActor\n\nSeveral years before Zeenat Aman started becoming active on social media, sharing throwback pictures with us and telling us anecdotes from the past, she was the actor who had swayed the nation with her cinematic brilliance. Today, her inimitable attitude towards life comes from her years of experience, of savouring the highs, powering through the lows, and just being herself. Having joined Instagram in February this year, she already has 447k followers, and has floored the internet with her mastery over social media. The elegant septuagenarian has also walked the ramp at Lakmé Fashion Week this year for designer Shahin Mannan, collaborated with a jewellery brand, and starred alongside Janhvi Kapoor in an ad for a mobile phone. In an interview with Femina, she had said, “Whatever you do in life, do it with great passion; everything else will eventually fall into place.”\n\nBorn in 1951, Zeenat was first recognised for her modelling work. She was 19 when she took part in the Femina Miss India pageant and the Miss Asia Pacific International pageant in 1970, winning both. She was discovered by Dev Anand at a party, and the rest is history. Zeenat stepped into Bollywood with early films such as The Evil Within (2017) and Hulchul (1971), but her breakthrough performance was in the 1971 blockbuster Haré Rama Haré Krishna. After this followed another hit – the 1973 movie Yaadon Ki Baaraat, which film scholar Kaushik Baumik has described as ‘the first quintessential Bollywood film’. By then, Zeenat was famously known as the ‘girl in white carrying a guitar’ from her memorable performance in the song Chura Liya Hai Tumne Jo Dil Ko. “When I joined the Indian film industry, I just wanted to be good at whatever I was doing. So, fame was something that just came organically,” she says."
