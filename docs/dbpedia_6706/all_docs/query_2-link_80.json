        "text": "On her 70th birthday, know some interesting facts about Zeenat Aman.\n\nZeenat Aman is one of the most popular actresses of yesteryear. She was considered to be the sexiest actress of 70s and ruled the Bollywood as a sex symbol for several years. The actress started her career in modelling and carved a niche for herself in Bollywood with successful films like Yaadon Ki Baaraat, Satyam Shivam Sundaram, Don, Bhopal Express and many more.\n\nOn the occasion of her 70th birthday, let us look at some of the interesting facts about the diva.\n\nInteresting Facts\n\nZeenat Aman was born in Mumbai and did her schooling in Panchgani. Further, she went to University of Southern California in Los Angeles for higher studies. She was raised partly in the USA and partly in Europe. Before she stepped into the film industry, she was a journalist for Femina magazine.\n\nZeenatâ€™s father, Amantullah was a scriptwriter in Bollywood. He passed away when Zeenat was only 13 years old. It was after his death that she added Aman to her name. Her father also wrote scripts for movies such as Pakeezah and Mughal-e-Azam .\n\nShe was the second runner-up at Miss India pageant. Later, she went on to win the title of Miss Asia Pacific 1970 and she is the first South Asian woman to get the title.\n\nZeenat made her debut in the Bollywood industry with the film Hulchul but it was a big flop at the box office. After that, she was ready to leave the nation but actor-filmmaker Dev Anand offered her a role in Hare Rama Hare Krishna. Since then, there was no looking back .\n\nDum Maaro Dum is quite a self-explanatory song and we need not say much. Through this song, Zeenat Aman along with Dev Anand introduced Hippie culture in Bollywood and the song still continues to be an evergreen hit.\n\nShe went to Raj Kapoor's office dressed up as a village girl with a burnt face while he was finalizing his heroine for Satyam Shivam Sundaram. He was impressed with her level of dedication and signed her right then.\n\nDon't Miss:Bride-To-Be Shraddha Arya Looks Sizzling At Her Pre Wedding Functions\n\nAlong with Hema Malini, Zeenat Aman was the highest paid actress of Bollywood from 1976-80. Also, she worked with some of the biggest directors in the industry including Raj Kapoor.\n\nZeenat fell in love with Sanjay Khan on the sets of their movie Abdullah.\n\nShe was also rumoured to be in a relationship with famous cricketer Imran Khan.\n\nDon't Miss:Kartik Poornima 2021: Date, Shubh Muhurat, Puja Vidhi And Significance\n\nTheir relationship ended after Zeenat married Mazhar and Imran married Jemina Goldsmith.\n\nThe marriage was a bitter one for Zeenat as her husband was abusive.
