        "text": "Zeenat Aman was born on November 19, 1951. Zeenat Aman was born to a Muslim father and a Hindu mother. Amanullah, her father was one of the writers for the movie Mughal-e-Azam and he died when Zeenat was just 13. Aman graduated from St. Xavier's School in Mumbai and went to Los Angeles for her studies. Upon returning to India, she first took a job as a journalist for Femina and then later on moved on to modeling. She was the second runner up in the Miss India Contest and went on to win the Miss Asia Pacific in 1970. She was considered a sex symbol during the 70s.\n\nAfter having studied in Los Angeles, winning the Miss Asia pageant and a successful modeling career, Aman's film career began with a small role in O. P. Ralhan's Hulchul in 1971. A second role in Hungama , starring singer Kishore Kumar, was also not successful.\n\nZeenat Aman had won the Miss India contest and modelled quite a bit when she was signed by Dev Anand who was looking for a westernised girl for his 'Hare Rama Hare Krishna' (1971). Zeenat swayed to the music and became known as the 'Dum Maro Dum' girl, as the producers fell all over themselves to sign the uninhibited girl for their films.\n\n'Yaadon Ki Baraat' and 'Dhund' (1973) and other films of this period, were successful at the box- office but Zeenie baby, as the media dubbed her, was considered only a showpiece. She happily signed Manoj Kumar's 'Roti Kapda Aur Makaan' (1974) but again, she was the glamourous angle.\n\nWhen she heard that Raj Kapoor was making 'Satyam Shivam Sundaram', (1978) Zeenat got herself made-up as a village belle one side of whose face is burnt, and dropped in on the maker! She got the film. Raj Kapoor promised that Zeenat was a 'volcano of talent' which would erupt in this film. Nothing like this happened though viewers and voyeurs got to feast their eyes on her. But she got a lease of life and signed several more films. 'Don' (1978), 'Ram Balram' (1978) 'Shalimar' and 'Daku Hasina' ( with Rakesh Roshan) were some of them.\n\nAfter the briefest turbulent marriage with Sanjay Khan which ended after Sanjay brutally assaulted her in a 5-star hotel, she tried picking up threads of her career and even gave memorable performances in 'Insaaf Ka Tarazu' (1980), 'Qurbaani' (1981), before settling down in marriage with character actor Mazhar Khan. She did a tele-film 'Gawahi', though, she kept away from acting but supported Mazhar Khan in making 'Gang'.\n\nZeenat Aman was the first Indian actress who wasn't a good dancer.\n\nZeenat married Mazhar Khan and was happily settled with her two sons Azhar and Azaan when fate played truant once again. Mazhar was ill with liver dysfunction and Zeenat spent all her savings for his treatment. The disease however was fatal. Mazhar Khan passed away in September 1998 . What followed was five traumatic years when her in-laws defamed her in public, snatched her son and brainwashed him to the extent that he refused to go back to his mother and even abused her.\n\nWithin a span of two years she lost her husband, her mother, and her son got estranged. Zeenat with the help of her former friends like Dimple Kapadia decided to let the world know her side of the story. She called a press conference and clarified all the allegations leveled against her.\n\nToday, Aman lives with her two sons and makes many social appearances. She is seen on screen rarely, in films such as Bhopal Express and the Kaizad Gustad film Boom. In 2006, she acted in the film Jaana - Let's Fall In Love with Rajesh Khanna.\n\nABOUT HER SELF :\n\nNickname: Babushka\n\nDate of Birth: 19 November 1951\n\nHeight: 5'9\" or 1.75 m\n\nCountry: Germany\n\nFather: Amanullah\n\nStep-father: Mr. Heinz\n\nSiblings: she is only child\n\nChildren: two sons\n\nMarital status: widow\n\nEx-spouse: Mazhar Khan\n\nEx-spouse: Sanjay (Abbass) Khan\n\nBoyfriend: Sanjay Khan\n\nEducation: Saint Xavier's school in Bombay than she studied in California\n\nOther facts: winner in Miss Asia contest\n\nOccupation: fashion model / bollywood actress\n\nDebut Film: Hulchul\n\nFILMOGRAPHY :\n\nSirf Romance: Love by Chance\n\nJaana: Lets Fall in Love\n\nBoom\n\nBhopal Express\n\nGawahi\n\nTujhe Nahin Chhodunga\n\nNamumkin\n\nDaku Hasina\n\nAurat\n\nBaat Ban Jaye\n\nHaathon Ki Lakeeren\n\nAmir Aadmi Gareeb Aadmi\n\nBhawani Junction\n\nYaadon Ki Kasam\n\nYaar Kasam\n\nMeri Adalat\n\nJagir\n\nPakhandi\n\nSohni Mahiwal\n\nYeh Desh\n\nBandhan Kuchchey Dhaagon Ka\n\nHumse Hai Zamana\n\nMahaan\n\nPukar\n\nTaqdeer\n\nVakil Babu\n\nGopichand Jasoos\n\nAshanti\n\nDaulat\n\nJaanwar\n\nPyaas\n\nSamraat\n\nTeesri Aankh\n\nKatilon Ke Kaatil\n\nKrodhi\n\nLaawaris\n\nProfessor Pyarelal\n\nInsaf Ka Tarazu\n\nDostana\n\nQurbani\n\nAlibaba Aur 40 Chor\n\nAbdullah\n\nBombay 405 Miles\n\nRam Balram\n\nTakkar\n\nThe Great Gambler\n\nCinema Cinema\n\nDon\n\nSatyam Shivam Sundaram: Love Sublime\n\nChor Ke Ghar Chor\n\nHeeralal Pannalal\n\nShalimar\n\nAashiq Hoon Baharon Ka\n\nChhaila Babu\n\nDarling Darling\n\nDharam Veer\n\nHum Kisi Se Kum Nahin\n\nKalabaaz\n\nPaapi\n\nDeewangee\n\nChori Mera Kaam\n\nWarrant\n\nAjanabee\n\nIshq Ishq Ishq\n\nManoranjan\n\nPrem Shastra\n\nRoti Kapada Aur Makaan\n\nDhund\n\nHeera Panna\n\nYaadon Ki Baaraat\n\nHare Raama Hare Krishna\n\nHulchul\n\nHungama\n\nThe Evil Within"
