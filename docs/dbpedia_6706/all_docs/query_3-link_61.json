        "text": "Flower power. Liberalism. Bohemianism. The world was going through an overhaul in the ’70s. And newborn independent India too found itself in the throes of an identity crisis... trying hard to break free from convention, keen to embrace the counter culture. And Dev Anand’s Dum maaro dum in Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971) became the war cry of that rebellion. RD Burman’s radical rhythm, Asha Bhosle’s ‘breaking free’ vocals and young Zeenat Aman, as Janice, the face of the hippie subculture... became a cinematic signpost. It somewhere helped that Zeenat was a crossover child. Born in India, bred in Germany, studied in Los Angeles... the winner of the Miss Asia-Pacific crown had global sensibilities. Silky straight tresses, glasses that hid a troubled soul, angst and abandon both synchronised in Janice’s persona.\n\nOn a physical level too, through her subsequent films Zeenat changed the way the Hindi film heroine looked. Maxis with thigh-high slights, blouses with deep cleavages, pants, skirts... Gen Y had found its messiah of style and sensuality. At a deeper level, she blurred the boundaries between virtue and vice. Her characters debunked the suffering stereotype. She played a wife drawn into an extramarital relationship in Dhund (1973), an opportunist, who dumps her unemployed lover for a millionaire in Roti Kapda Aur Makaan (1974), the go-getter who considers an abortion to fulfil her ambitions in Ajnabee (1974), the unapologetic hooker in Manoranjan (1975) and even became Hindi cinema’s answer to Bo Derek when she emerged in a bikini, all salt and spice, in Feroz Khan’s Qurbani (1980). “I’m told I brought a change in the depiction of the female protagonist. Earlier, there were just shades of white and black, the heroine and the vamp. Perhaps, I brought in strokes of grey,” she explains self-effacingly. “I worked with directors who were on top of their game. Life passed in the blink of an eye. I’ve many memories to reclaim. Those days you just went home from the studio. You weren’t aware of the ripples you created outside,” says the 60-plus actor who worked with directors like Nasir Hussain, BR Chopra, Manoj Kumar, Prakash Mehra, Raj Khosla, Shakti Samanta and Manmohan Desai.\n\nToday, she leads a life away from the flashbulbs… except for rare occasions. Like recently, she won the Timeless Glamour Award (Female) at the Filmfare Absolut Glamour & Style Awards. She was also the Chief Guest of Honour at the 14th Annual Bollywood Festival Norway. “Norway is a beautiful country. They had invited me earlier as well. But I couldn’t go. They present a slice of life of the Indian film industry,” she says explaining her zeal to be part of the festival. Another reason is that her son Azaan Khan, who’s debuting as a director showcased his film Bankster there. “It’s an action drama, a youthful urban film,” she says with pride. Quiz her on why we see so little of her and she says, “There are few parts for 60 plus ladies.”\n\nThe Shine\n\nWhile she played muse to Dev Anand through the ’70s, and featured in Navketan Films’ Heera Panna, Warrant and Darling Darling among others, it was her walking into arch rival Raj Kapoor’s RK Studio one sultry day that created history. “I was acting with Rajji (Kapoor) in Vakil Babu those days. He was planning to make Satyam Shivam Sundaram (SSS, 1978) then. He’d keep talking passionately about his protagonist Rupa. It inspired me.\n\nI wanted to be directed by him,” she confides. “So one day I wore a ghagra-choli, plaited my hair, adorned it with gajras, stuck tissue paper on my face to give it a scarred effect and stopped by at RK cottage,” she narrates adding, “ I sent across a message to Rajji saying that ‘Rupa’ had come to meet him. He was surprised that an established actor had taken such efforts. He phoned Krishnaji (Kapoor) and asked her to come immediately. She brought a gold guinea and gave it to me as the signing amount for SSS. I was over the moon,” she smiles.\n\nThe distributors were apprehensive as to how a glamour girl would go back to the basics. “Rajji made me wear Bhanu Athaiya’s costumes and shot a test reel with me with Nargisji’s Jaago Mohan pyaare from Jagte Raho (1956) playing in the background. The test reel was an exercise to convince the distributors that I could pull it off,” she says. “When the film started, Bhanuji made a clay idol of me in her studio. She’d try the fittings on that,” says the actor whose Khajurao-like form was the USP of the film. The same year, Krishna Shah roped her in for Shalimar where she was paired opposite Dharmendra and Rex Harrison. The iconic Don with Amitabh Bachchan further redeemed her status as box-office gold. Amidst a host of hit potboilers like Dostana, Pukar and Lawaaris in the ’80s also came BR Chopra’s Insaaf Ka Tarazu, which made her a crusader of sorts. Millions of women rooted for her avenging angel act in this comment against sexual exploitation.\n\nThe Shadow\n\nBut while she was at the pinnacle of her professional glory, her personal life reportedly was going through tremendous upheaval. She reportedly got involved with the much-married Sanjay Khan. The two apparently met on the set of his directorial Abdullah (1980). The volatile relationship reportedly ended with allegations of abuse. In 1985, Zeenat married Mazhar Khan and the couple had two sons Azaan and Zahaan. The marriage, too, reportedly hit rough weather. Mazhar underwent a prolonged illness and passed away in September 1998 due to renal failure. Zeenat has consistently stayed away from commenting on the turbulent phases of her life. But her words do convey the conflicts she may have battled along the way. “We have our vulnerabilities, insecurities; we actors are highly emotional people,” she says adding, “I have made some mistakes in the journey of life. Nobody has a perfect life. Anyone who says so is lying. There’s action and reaction.” So what would be the hard lessons that came her way? “Never trust easily. Look before you leap whether it’s a project or a relationship. Weigh the pros and cons. Let the mind participate. Don’t listen to your heart always,” says she.\n\nSoul talk\n\nThrough the 2000s, Zeenat was seen in films like Bhopal Express, Jaana... Let’s Fall in Love, Dunno Y... Na Jaane Kyon but her primary focus remained her sons. “Being a single parent is never easy,” she admits. Azaan is turning director while Zahaan, she says, is multi-talented. “Zahaan’s a musician. He plays the guitar, the drum. He graduated in culinary art. He also has the potential of being an actor. He’s done a course at the Stella Adler Acting school. But I’m not a pushy parent.”\n\nDoesn’t she feel the need of a companion? “Right now, I don’t feel the need of a partner. Presently no,” she insists. “And love is not something narrow. It cannot be quantified. There are different facets of love. I love my pets.\n\nI was devastated when I lost my pet… he was nine, a Golden Retriever. We called him Rocko Aman Khan,” she shares. “My other pet, Rafael Aman Khan, is a Labrador. He’s 11 and the love of my life. He follows me from room to room. My children call him ‘Mama ka deewana’,” she laughs full-throatedly.\n\nYes, it takes strength to remain in the limelight decade after decade. But it takes perhaps greater strength to choose to remain away from it. “I like trying new things. Like I’m learning graphology (handwriting analysis). I enjoy doing aqua aerobics,” says the star who’s enjoying new horizons. Revealing that self-assuredness is an accessory that works at any age she says, “Life is beautiful there’s so much to be grateful for. At the end of the day you have to believe in yourself. If it happens fine, if it doesn’t it’s also fine. You are meant for something better.”n\n\nWe actors are highly emotional people... I have made some mistakes in the journey of life.
