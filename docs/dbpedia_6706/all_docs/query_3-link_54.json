The fact that both the actresses established independent careers with multiple blockbusters to their names guaranteed the narrative in that era. However, today on Babi’s birth anniversary, the ‘Satyam Shivam Sundaram’ actress shared a heartfelt note about their bond and the former’s struggle with mental health.",

        "text": "Zeenat Aman’s journey from a film icon to a digital queen has been quite wondrous. The yesteryear star, with 150K strong followers on Instagram, happens to be one of the most articulate actresses in the country today. On co-star Parveen Babi’s birth anniversary today, the Satyam Shivam Sundaram actress poured her heart out in a beautifully-worded post that navigates everything: from being pegged as enemies to the seedy underbelly of fame.\n\nRead on for what the actress has to say.\n\nZeenat Aman pays a heartfelt tribute to Parveen Babi on her birth anniversary\n\nImage credit: Instagram/TheZeenatAman\n\n“I’d like to remember and honour Parveen today, on her birthday,” starts the caption. “Parveen was gorgeous, glamorous and talented. Back in the 70s, we wore our hair in a similar manner and enjoyed Western fashion. Though neither of us saw it, we were told we had an uncanny resemblance. It must have been true, because as recently as last year I was approached in Dubai as “Parveen ma’am”, “ continues Zeenatji in a descriptive tone.\n\nNavigating the ‘enemy’ narrative\n\n“Naturally the media at the time spun tales of competition and rivalry between us, but in reality we were always warm towards each other. Not best friends, but contemporaries, colleagues and well wishers. We worked together on Ashanti and Mahaan,” shares Aman.\n\nSpeaking about Parveen Babi’s struggle with mental health\n\nZeenatji continues, “Parveen’s struggle with mental health illness came at a time when the country was still so insensitive and ignorant on these matters. After her death, I often ruminated on how she was remembered. The tabloids focused on her romantic relationships and “episodes”, but Parveen was much more than who she dated or what she said when she was unwell. I feel she never truly got the chance to say her piece.”\n\n“She was intelligent, hardworking and creative. She loved reading, and I remember her curled up with a book in between shots on set. She achieved incredible success as an actor, even featuring on the cover of Time magazine. Later, she took up various creative pursuits, embarked on a spiritual journey, and started designing interiors. We stayed in touch on and off for years, before ultimately drifting apart, “ the post goes on to say. “Parveen was remarkable in many ways, and I hope she will be remembered for the effervescent person she was.” concludes Aman.\n\nIn the years succeeding Parveen Babi’s untimely death, many have voiced their concerns about her legacy. Often labelled as ‘misunderstood’, especially in current years, Parveenji can undoubtedly be categorised as a revolutionary in the Hindi film space with her progressive thinking and characters. It is now, through the testimony of her peers and friends, that we have a more insightful understanding of one of India’s foremost superstars.\n\nWhat do you think of Zeenatji’s note? Tell us your thoughts in the comments below.\n\nLead and social image credit: Umesh Mishra, Instagram/TheZeenatAman\n\nRead iDiva for the latest in Bollywood, fashion looks, beauty and lifestyle news."
