        "text": "“In the 70s the film and fashion industry was absolutely male dominated, and I would often be the only woman on a set. Over the course of my career I have been photographed and filmed by many talented men. A woman’s gaze though, is different.”\n\nShe mentioned the photographer, Tanya A, who snapped her. “This series of pictures was shot by young photographer @tanyyaa.a_ in the comfort of my home. No lights, no makeup artist, no hairdresser, no stylist, no assistants. Just a lovely sunny afternoon together,” the actor added.\n\nThe photographer responded with the comment, “Definitely my most cherished portrait making session. Thank you so much.”\n\nAman (71) said she was impressed with the growing number of young working women today. “It’s such a pleasure to see so many young women working on both sides of the lens today. I look forward to discovering more such talent on Instagram.”\n\nAlso read: Pakistani brides falling for Indian designers and ‘Sharia-compliant’ Sabyasachi lehengas\n\nThe debut and ‘broken heart’\n\nZeenat Aman was born in Mumbai on 19 November, 1951 to a Hindu mother and a Muslim father Amanullah, who was one of the writers for the classic Mughal-e-Azam (1960) .\n\nShe made her acting debut in 1970 with The Evil Within which also starred actor and director Dev Anand. This opened the gate to movies for her, and she worked in superhits like Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971), Yaadon Ki Baarat (1973), Dharam Veer (1977), Satyam Shivam Sundaram (1978), Qurbani (1980), and Insaaf Ka Tarazu (1980), among others.\n\nAfter Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Dev Anand, who was 48 to Zeenat’s 20, said he became fascinated with the actress’ “devile-may-care attitute”. He fell in love with the actress but was left heartbroken at her alleged relationship with mega star Raj Kapoor.\n\nIn his autobiography titled, Romancing With Life, Dev recalled how he and Zeenat were written about in magazines and newspapers. “Whenever and wherever she was talked about glowingly, I loved it; and whenever and wherever I was discussed in the same vein, she was jubilant. In the subconscious, we had become emotionally attached to each other,” he wrote.\n\nThen rumours surfaced of an alleged affair between Zeenat Aman and legendary showman Raj Kapoor during the shooting of Satyam, Shivam, Sundaram. Anad had called Zeenat to a meeting after a party, he wrote in his autobiography. He wrote of the party: “A drunken Raj Kapoor threw his arms around her exuberantly. This suddenly struck me as a little too familiar. And the way she reciprocated his embrace seemed much more than just polite and courteous… My heart broke into pieces… The rendezvous had already lost all meaning in my mind. I sneaked out of the place.”\n\nZeenat and Dev Anand worked together in another one of his films, Ishk Ishk Ishk (1974), and there was Raj Kapoor again. He wrote in his memoir, “After the premiere of Ishk Ishk Ishk at Metro cinema, Raj Kapoor kissed Zeenat in full view of the invited audience, congratulating her for her sparkling performance in the film. That must have made her evening all the more sparkling. Yet, I was jealous of him for making advances on what I considered my sole possession, my discovery, my leading lady, and desiring her with a kiss.”\n\nHe added that the evening delivered a blow to his personality and dominating spirit. “I had decided on the spur of the moment to tell Zeenat for the first time how much I loved her. And that there was an idea in my mind of another story that would put her on a pedestal as never before, the highest so far. But that was never to be,” he wrote, adding that he detached himself, convinced that he had blundered, and taken too many things for granted. “There was no need for me to let any rancour germinate in my mind against Zeenat. I had prepared her for the world, and she was free to go into the arms of anyone who would help her further her ambitious dreams,” he said.\n\nYoung and vibrant\n\nAn only child, Zeenat‘s parents’ divorced when she was very young. Her father passed away when she was 13.\n\nShe graduated from Bombay’s Saint Xavier’s school and later received a scholarship for further studies in California. Upon her return, she began working as a reporter before being introduced to modelling by her friends.\n\nZeenat competed in the Miss India pageant and finished third to advance to the Miss Asia Pacific International in 1970, which she ultimately won, becoming the first Indian to hold the title."
