        "text": "The veteran actress urged the news portal to examine their facts before publishing such things.\n\nZeenat Aman, a veteran actress who made her Instagram debut a few months ago and has since captured everyone’s attention with her moving pictures, has now disputed a claim that included her on a list of Bollywood superstars who are of mixed ethnicity.\n\nOn her Instagram Stories, Zeenat asked that before publishing such material to the public, it be better to “double check the facts”.\n\nOn her Instagram Stories, Zeenat shared a screenshot of the article that listed her alongside several other Bollywood celebrities. “From Zeenat Aman to Nargis Fakhri, Bollywood Stars with Mixed Ethnicities” was the title. Zeenat responded by pointing out how the article’s reported “facts” were false.\n\nThe seasoned actress said after mentioning the portal that she was glad to be with these attractive actors but really urged them to examine their facts before publishing such things. Her mother was an Indian Hindu who married a German man twice since she was not a “German Christian.” My father was a Muslim from India.\n\nShe said that she does not speak German well and that this information is publicly available, including on her Instagram.\n\nThe post regarding her mother was then shared by Zeenat in her following Instagram Story. A few months prior, she had uploaded a black and white photo to Instagram along with a heartfelt note for her mum.\n\nThe senior star had lauded her mother and stated that the reason she had such an exceptional life was due to the extraordinary woman who had reared her. Vardhini Scharwachter, her mother, was what is referred to as a “pataka.”\n\nSpeaking on her parents’ heritage, the renowned actor disclosed that her mother was a devout Hindu who embodied the concepts of acceptance, love, and empowerment. She married Amanullah Khan, the father of Zeenat, despite her religious beliefs. She later fell in love with and wed a great German man she nicknamed Uncle Heinz after they had split up. She taught her to be independent and to run her life according to her own rules.\n\nZeenat also said that her mother was the wind beneath her wings."
