        "text": "Since her Instagram debut earlier this year, Zeenat Aman has charmed cinephiles and netizens alike with her eloquence, wit and honesty, emerging as a sincere voice in a sea of sanitised, monetised celebrity feeds. Naturally, her audience craves more. In a diary-style entry for Vogue India, she pulls back the curtain on her life a little more, penning her own story with the trademark lyricism that everyone has come to know and love.\n\nMy fame is an amorphous beast. It has taken me 50 years to bring it to heel.\n\nSometimes, it has been a purring cat on my lap, and at others, a slavering wolf breathing down my neck. But now, it’s simply an animal that I can look in the eye. An eternally untameable companion that walks by my side.\n\nPeople say I hid from it for three decades, but that is not entirely true. Its gaze wandered when my priorities shifted. After years of living a life dictated by stardom, a life of endless shifts, performances, appearances, rumours and obligations, my days had begun to ring hollow. I was aching for something of my own. A family, really. One with bonds as deep as the one I shared with my own mother. The birth of my sons in 1986 and 1989 gifted me all this and more. As I contended with their diapers and bibs, the prolonged illness and death of their father, then later school scrapes and college romances, work offers dwindled and I was happy for it. The residue of my early fame still allowed me the occasional opportunity that kept my kitchen running, but without the scrutiny or intrusion of outsiders.\n\nI’m not surprised, then, that my appearance on social media is being hailed as a ‘comeback’, some even referring to it as my ‘second innings’. I, for one, do not see it as such. This is not a comeback. I never went away.\n\nGram by Gram\n\nIt took months for my younger son Zahaan and his partner, Cara, to convince me to join Instagram. Seven, to be precise. I had so many trepidations: who would have the patience to help me run my account? Would my privacy be in jeopardy? Isn’t all this a young person’s game? They chipped away at my opposition, until my walls crumbled. “People are going to love hearing from you. You’re Zeenat Aman!” they repeated ad nauseam until I finally agreed out of sheer exasperation. Then they brought in their friend Tanya to click some pictures of me at home, and voila, an Instagram account was born.\n\nI didn’t realise how much being able to publicly speak my own truths would delight me. As a leading actor in the ’70s, I was always a subject of conversation, but almost never on my own terms. The gossip and perceptions could be suffocating, and there was rarely recourse to set the record straight. On Instagram, I have found the freedom to express myself. It’s liberating, and consequently, I haven’t accepted a single interview request that’s come my way since February.\n\nThere is no desire to have millions of followers or present some unattainable, aspirational life to the world. All I do is reminisce, talk about the things that matter to me, and have fun. Which is not to say that I am callous about my posts. There is enough blather in the world and I don’t wish to add to it. The captions take no more than 15 to 20 minutes to write, but each one is preceded by conversations with my family. They give me perspective and help me articulate my views.\n\nNow, every day, I wake up to a slew of messages from across the world: Syria and Ukraine, Fiji and Australia, Thailand and Mexico...the geographical scope of my followers fascinates me because it was intangible in my youth—a time before the internet. This isn’t a comeback, but it is something of a coming around. I am only today acknowledging the impact of my career on the lives of thousands of strangers. That people remember my work and were positively influenced by it makes me happy. They may not know me personally, but I represent something to them—perhaps a beautiful memory or a moment of empowerment—and that is an invaluable privilege.\n\nThe Beauty Shtick\n\nPacked away in a drawer in my bedroom is a card adorned with dried flowers. I made it when I was a schoolgirl, with wild blooms picked from a trail in Panchgani, and posted it to my mother. When she died, it came back into my possession as perfectly preserved as the day I sent it.\n\nI adored my mother and from an early age was driven by a desire to make her happy and proud. She wasn’t a pushy person, but some innate discipline coupled with my Catholic school upbringing fostered in me the need to be the best at whatever I do. As a child, I excelled at school. I was head girl at Saint Joseph’s Convent and later won a scholarship to the University of South California. I hated coming second. So when I ‘only’ won runner-up at Miss India in 1969 and lost my chance to compete at Miss World, I was determined to at least win Miss Asia Pacific. I did, and that title was my gateway to glamour and fashion.\n\nIt may be blasphemous to write this in Vogue India, but I don’t think we should take fashion too seriously. Clothes are meant to be worn and enjoyed as an expression of individuality and comfort. They can certainly be powerful and shape our self-image. I am not denying the creativity of designers nor the skill it takes to create fine clothes, but what I am protesting is the obsession with appearance and couture that I see around me. In a world brimming with wonder and suffering, fashion should bring us joy and utility not turmoil and self-obsession.\n\nMy own wardrobe is proof of my philosophy. There are a few designer outfits—a Sabyasachi blouse here, a pair of Gucci shades there—but mostly, there are clothes that I have bought not for their labels but for their quality and style. Amongst them are pieces from roadside shops, obscure boutiques, affordable retail stores and export surplus warehouses.\n\nOver the years, I’ve worn it all (and nearly bared it all) and had great fun doing it. I realised early on that the world desired youth and beauty from women in the film industry. So I leveraged my looks, but I also chose roles that pushed the envelope. Still, there was far more interest in my face and figure than there ever was in my intellect. This is one reason that I have loved ageing—it has evened the scales.\n\nEquilibrium\n\nI have led a life of breathtaking highs and profound lows. There is nothing I regret, and nobody that I owe. Any shame or fear that has ever dogged me has long evaporated. There are incidents in my life that the public cling to and that are dredged up again and again. I am aware of these, and becoming increasingly immune to them. My life is not defined by a few bad days that transpired many decades ago, and I need neither sympathy nor defence. I am content in myself.\n\nMy days are full. When I’m not working, I’m spending time with my family, pottering around the garden, fussing over my dog Lily, watching Netflix, catching up with friends, and thinking about my next Instagram post. Acting offers consistently pop up, but nothing has yet sparked my fancy and I am happy to wait for something that does. Meanwhile, being on the cover of Vogue India reminds me that life moves in circles. I started my career as a model, and here I am again at 70-plus.\n\nSome nights, I dream of a chase and wake up disoriented with my heart pounding in my chest—not from fear but exhilaration. My eyes always open before the chase concludes, and I imagine this dream is a metaphor for my life. Exhilarating, but not yet ready to conclude.\n\nThe nature of the world is transient. Fame, money, love, good times and bad—these will come and go. I found my inner mettle when I accepted this truth. The only thing that is in my control is my attitude. Life is just what you make of it, and mine has been magnificent.\n\nPhotographed by Avani Rai\n\nStyled by Megha Kapoor\n\nHair: Justine Rae Mellocastro\n\nMakeup: Mitesh Rajani/Feat.
