        "text": "Mumbai: A report on Instagram about the ethnicity of several Bollywood actors prompted veteran actor Zeenat Aman, who recently joined Instagram, to issue a clarification note, where she emphasized that her parents belong to both Hindu and Muslim religions, and therefore, she cannot be categorized as having mixed ethnicity.\n\nSharing the screenshot of the article titled, ‘From Zeenat Aman to Nargis Fakhri, Bollywood Stars with Mixed Ethnicities’, pointed out the need for ‘double checking’ the facts before making such an article on public platforms.\n\nHer post reads \"I'm happy to be in the company of these beautiful actors, but a sincere request to double-check the facts before posting such articles. My mother was not a 'German Christian'. She was an Indian Hindu; whose second marriage was to a German man. My father was an Indian Muslim. This is publicly available information, including on my Instagram. I am also NOT fluent in German; at most, I can understand a smattering. Danke (Thanks in German)!\"\n\nZeenat Aman further addressed the matter by sharing a post about her mother in her subsequent Instagram Story. A few months ago, she had shared a heartfelt note dedicated to her mother along with a black and white picture. The image portrayed Zeenat holding her mother, who was elegantly clad in a saree, during an event. In sharing the photo, the veteran actor expressed her admiration for her mother, stating, \"If I have led an extraordinary life, it is because I was raised by an extraordinary woman. My mother, Vardhini Scharwachter, was nothing short of a dynamo. She exuded elegance, intellect, and resilience, serving as my unwavering pillar of support.\"\n\nIn her earlier post, Zeenat provided detailed insights into her parents' ethnic backgrounds as well. She wrote, \"My mother was a devout Hindu who embodied the values of tolerance, love, and empowerment. Her religious beliefs did not hinder her from marrying my father, Amanullah Khan. After their separation, she found love once again and married a wonderful German man, whom I affectionately called Uncle Heinz. My mother taught me the importance of self-reliance and living life on one's own terms. She truly became the guiding force behind my endeavors.\"\n\nThis rephrased version maintains the essential details and structure of the original text while offering some linguistic variations for better readability."
