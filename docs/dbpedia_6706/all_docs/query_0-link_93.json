        "text": "On September 26, 1923, a legend was born in the world of Indian cinema, a man who would go on to become one of the most iconic and enduring stars of Bollywood. Today, on what would have been his 100th birthday, the film fraternity and fans alike are celebrating the remarkable life and legacy of the evergreen hero, Dev Anand.\n\nDev Anand's cinematic journey spanned over six glorious decades, during which he graced the silver screen in more than 100 films. His charismatic presence, versatile acting, and unforgettable characters left an indelible mark on Hindi cinema, and his legacy continues to bring joy to the hearts of countless admirers.\n\nTo mark this momentous occasion, veteran actress Zeenat Aman took to her Instagram handle to pay a heartfelt tribute to \"Dev Saab,\" as she fondly referred to him. She shared two captivating pictures from their iconic song sequences in the films \"Hare Krishna Hare Ram\" (1971) and \"Heera Panna\" (1973).\n\nALSO READ: Zeenat Aman's postcard surprise: The unbelievable story behind Norway's special stamp\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CxpSR6YrP01/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\n\nIn her touching note, Zeenat Aman wrote, \"Celebrating 100 years of Dev saab. Stylish, suave and prolific, he was a dynamo beyond compare. And what generosity of talent! He sparked careers (mine included), brought together creative heads, and made films that resonated across generations. It gladdens my heart to see his legacy honoured an entire century since his birth. In recent days, I’ve been overwhelmed with requests for comments about him but there is little to add to what I’ve already said.\"\n\nShe added, \"Though, I posted a three-part series about him just a few weeks ago, I can’t resist the nostalgia of these two frames from our earliest films together. They will be instantly recognisable to my older followers, but I’m not so sure about you younger lot!\"\n\nDev Anand's contributions to Indian cinema are beyond measure, and on his 100th birth anniversary, Zeenat Aman's heartfelt tribute beautifully captures the essence of the man who continues to live on through his timeless work and the memories he left behind on the silver screen."
