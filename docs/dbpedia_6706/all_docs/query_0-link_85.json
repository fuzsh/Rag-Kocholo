        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe yesteryear siren revealed she had been late on the set for a day. Although Khan did not shout at her, he cut her payment.\n\nHe may have been charm personified on screen, but off it, the late actor Sanjay Khan was a hard taskmaster. Recently, yesteryear diva Zeenat Aman opened up about her experience of working with the actor in the 1980 blockbuster ‘Qurbani’.\n\nTaking to Instagram on Thursday, the ‘Satyam Shivam Sundaram’ star revealed how she was made to financially compensate for being late on the sets one day.\n\nThe diva revealed that although she was diligent, one day she decided to party all night and consequently, was late to work the next day.\n\n“I often discuss set etiquette in my captions, so I'd be amiss to neglect Feroz's influence on me in this regard. I was quite a diligent worker, but on one occasion, my youth got the better of me. Though we had an early call time the next day, I agreed to go out to a party. It was a fantastic night of dance and drink, and unsurprisingly, I landed up one hour late to set,\" she wrote.\n\nKhan, who was also the director of ‘Qurbani’ glowered at her and later demanded she pay for her unprofessionalism. “No argument, no scolding, but you can be sure that he docked my pay to pay the crew for that one-hour delay!” she reminisced.\n\nAbout ‘Qurbani’\n\nThe romantic drama released in 1980, and became a certified blockbuster. Aside from Khan and Aman, the movie also starred Vinod Khanna.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhat’s India drinking?
