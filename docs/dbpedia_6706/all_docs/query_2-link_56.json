        "text": "Happy Birthday to Zeenat Aman, born on November 19, 1951. Zeenat began a trend in Bollywood of the 70’s of a Westernized heroine; sexy and slightly bohemian. She appeared playing the guitar in a famous scene from “Yaadon Ki Baaraat” (1973) and was the heroine in the original “Don”(1978). Her father was a script writer. After being educated in the University of Southern California, Zeenat won the title of Miss Asia Pacific International and started her movie career thereafter. After several flops, Aeenat’s breakthrough came with director Dev Anand’s ‘Hare Rama Hare Krishna’ in 1971, winning a Filmfare Best Supporting Actress Award. She established herself as a leading actress in the 1970s and 80s with these films: ‘Dharamveer’ (1977), ‘Hum Kisise Kum Naheen’ (1977), ‘Satyam Shivam Sundaram’ (1978), ‘The Great Gambler’ (1979), ‘Insaf Ka Tarazu’ (1980), ‘Dostana’ (1980), ‘Qurbani’ (1980), and ‘Laawaris’ (1981). After her marriage of Mazhar Khan in 1985, she did less films and took a hiatus in 1989. She made a comeback in 1999 in ‘Bhopal Express’. Zeenat occasionally does supporting roles appearing in the web series ‘Love Life & Screw Ups’. and last appeared in ‘Panipat’ in 2019."
