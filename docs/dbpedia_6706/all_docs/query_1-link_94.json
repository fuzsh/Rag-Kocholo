        "text": "Words matter and Zeenat Aman is a wordsmith.\n\nWe tend to forget the power of words in this climate of clickbait, where attention spans have dwindled to a bite-sized 30 seconds and 50-character captions. To say I was thrilled when the legendary Zeenat agreed to be on our July-August cover would be an understatement. And when she agreed to pen the accompanying story herself, I was overjoyed. Then I read her piece. A meandering soliloquy that moves from her relationship with fame to social media, from self-image to style, from her love for her family to her dreams and her life, causing the reader to be overcome by nostalgia, wisdom and hope all at once.\n\nHaving had the pleasure and privilege of styling Zeenat for this story, lensed by Avani Rai, I was graced with a subject in her seventies, chic in monochromatic looks from Sabyasachi, Raw Mango and Amit Aggarwal (all paired with flats because it’s cool to be comfortable). It became apparent very early on the set that Zeenat moved with—and possessed—more style in her pinky than many a seasoned pro I’ve encountered.\n\nShe has always been an icon. Her repertoire of films, from Haré Rama Haré Krishna (1971) and Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973) to Satyam Shivam Sundaram (1978), Don (1978) and Qurbani (1980), and that fresh-faced, sassy, drop-dead gorgeous appeal have seen her referenced on countless mood boards (the image of her in that silver sequin gown that she was literally sewn into is inimitable). However, since her Instagram debut in February this year, she has become the thinking person’s style icon. Her feed is a consummate mix of a peek into her current life, dogs and daily happenings, as well as a treasure trove of old photos and clips from her younger days as a Bollywood legend. Images aside, which in and of themselves are stalk-worthy, it’s her insightful and intelligent captions that have captivated people everywhere.\n\nWhile, as she puts it, “There is enough blather in the world,” we thank you, Zeenat, for your words, which are anything but.\n\nPhotographed by Avani Rai\n\nStyled by Megha Kapoor\n\nHair: Justine Rae Mellocastro\n\nMakeup: Mitesh Rajani/Feat. Artists\n\nAssistant stylist: Rupangi Grover\n\nPhotographer’s assistant: Harman Achint\n\nArt director: Aishwaryashree\n\nJunior Designer: Shagun Jangid\n\nBookings editor: Savio Gerhart\n\nAlso read:\n\nEditor’s letter: India in focus | Vogue India\n\nZeenat Aman’s Instagram debut is a masterclass in perceptive self-reflection"
