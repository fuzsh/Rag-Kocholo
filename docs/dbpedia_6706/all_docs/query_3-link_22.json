        "text": "Madhubala (born February 14, 1933, Delhi, British India—died February 23, 1969, Bombay [now Mumbai], Maharashtra, India) was an Indian actress who was the most celebrated female Bollywood star during the 1950s and ’60s. She was especially famed for her beauty, so much so that her accomplished acting was often overlooked.\n\nDehlavi was still a child when her impoverished Pashtun family moved to a slum in Bombay that was close to the Bombay Talkies film studio. Shortly thereafter she began appearing in movies, and she was billed as Baby Mumtaz for her roles in Basant (1942) and Dhanna Bhagat (1945). The diligent actress attracted the attention of Devika Rani, a cofounder of the studio, who suggested that she call herself Madhubala, and, after Neel Kamal (1947) with Raj Kapoor, she was so billed. She acted in several films each year, becoming her family’s primary source of income. Her role as a ghostly young woman in the supernatural suspense drama Mahal (1949), in which she acted opposite Ashok Kumar, made her a star.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nAfter Madhubala starred with Dilip Kumar in the romance Tarana (1951), the pair were linked romantically. They appeared together again in Sangdil (1952), a loose adaptation of Charlotte Brontë’s novel Jane Eyre, and in the drama Amar (1954). Her other notable roles included that of a spoiled and naïve heiress in the comedy Mr. and Mrs. ’55 (1955), directed by and costarring Guru Dutt; a young woman raised by poor itinerants in the comedy Phagun (1958), popular for its songs; an intrepid reporter in Kala Pani (1958), costarring Dev Anand; and an independent woman whose car has broken down in the comedy Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958). She was also remembered for her songs in the thriller Howrah Bridge (1958)."
