        "text": "Readers:\n\nDo you write with a specific reader in mind or do you write for yourself?\n\nThe motivation is different each time and changes.\n\nIt’s writing as a form of self-therapy.\n\nA novel might be like a long love letter, making a declaration to my wife.\n\nThe Refugees’ Daughter, my first Red Circle Mini, is about trying to increase the total sum of kindness in the world to the greatest extent possible.\n\nThat said, who I actually write for is multi-layered, and intertwined.\n\nWhat is the most interesting question that you have been asked by one of your readers?\n\nMany people seem surprised that despite the fact that I am on the autism spectrum that I write novels, and love-stories to boot!\n\nHow can you write novels?\n\nI have had that question thrown at me many times.\n\nI am not good at dealing with complex human-relationships, but when it comes to minimalist-relationships, and relationships based on simple pure love I probably understand them much better than your average person.\n\nOr maybe it is because from an early age I looked after my mother who often struggled emotionally, learning naturally about love and kindness.\n\nDo you ever look at comments on websites made by your readers? And if so, is there any particular one you recall?\n\nI very rarely cast my eye over reader comments. However, there are some comments that have left an impression.\n\nOne of them was that:\n\n…after reading Takuji Ichikawa’s novel I had no idea how to describe the emotional feeling that had taken root in my heart. These strange feelings lasted for days…\n\nThat is what I want from my readers.\n\nTo what extent can non verbal feelings and emotions that can’t be expressed in words actually be conveyed using words?\n\nThat’s my major theme.\n\nBooks:\n\nWhich book are you best known for and how would you describe it?\n\nBe With You, Ima Aini Yukimasu, as it has been translated into many different languages and is easy to get hold of.\n\nIt is a story of reunion beyond death with a beloved wife.\n\nAnxiety from the loss of a loved one is a massive obsession of mine. It is not limited to this novel.\n\nI still continue to write about people facing loss in many different ways and reunion.\n\nPerhaps I am trying to build a religion just for me within my novels.\n\nWhich of your books would you recommend reading first?\n\nNow Just for a Moment Seeing that Smile, Ima Hitotabi Ano Hyojo Mini.\n\nIt is a short story that brings together all of the elements in me in a simple and concise manner, expressed and written in its best form.\n\nSeparation and reunion is an autism spectrum type of obsession.\n\nNostalgia. Time. Memory. Love and sympathy. Fantasy. Lyrical-expression.\n\nIt is a story about a group of teenage boys and girls, afflicted by a peculiar-illness, living together in a dormitory.\n\nHave any of your books or works been adapted for TV or Film?\n\nMy debut work, Separation, was made into a TV series with the title 14 Months. It’s a story about a rejuvenating wife, who eventually ends becoming a young girl.\n\nBe With You, Ima Aini Yukimasu, has been adapted for film and made into a TV series in Japan. The film was also remade in China and Korea.\n\nLove’s Photographs, Ren’ai Shashin, has been adapted for film in Japan. It is a tale of a girl afflicted with a terrible and strange illness that means falling in love would lead to her death.\n\nSay Hello to Him When the Times Comes, Sono Toki wa Kare ni Yoroshiku, has been adapted for film in Japan. It is a story of a young man who is in love with a woman, who has been asleep for years, and coincidental meetings with dead people in dreams that change their fate.\n\nDo you have any favourite book covers?\n\nI’ll Go on My Broken Bicycle, Kowareta Jidensha de Boku wa Yuku.\n\nThe moment I saw the bound copy I cried visibly. It is the only time this has happened.\n\nThe shape of the joyous dream that the male hero had been pursuing all his life was drawn in a wondrous pattern.\n\nHow do you come up with the titles for your works? Does the title come first or the narrative?\n\nMostly, the stories come first. A title comes to mind, naturally as I write.\n\nIn my case a phrase in the novel, just as it is written, on many occasions ends up as the title\n\nHow long did it take for you to get your debut title published?\n\nAt the age of 29 I wrote my first love story. A decade later, when I was 39, it become a novel and my debut work.\n\nWriting:\n\nHow much of what you write about in your novels is based on personal experience and real situations?\n\nIt diverges and depends on the novel. But a significant proportion is drawn from personal experience.\n\nI write fantastical novels so I just don’t plant facts as they are in my works. Instead I add dramatisation and replace experiences with episodes that float a few centimetres above actual reality.\n\nHowever, I am personally someone who is extremely detached from common sense. Therefore, readers think most of what I write is novelised fantasy.\n\nWhere do you look for inspiration and how do you come up with plot ideas?\n\nOften, many of my ideas come to me when I am running in the forest. When I look at stars, the moon or clouds. Or when I am listening to music I like.\n\nDreams and visions can also end up becoming novels.\n\nI note down the plot ideas that come to me, and once these reach the point of saturation, a type of tipping point, I start writing.\n\nIn many cases the last scene comes first, and then I go back searching out the core of the plot.\n\nWhy do you write?\n\nBecause it’s necessary. Now, of today, I have a stock of several thousand unpublished manuscripts.\n\nEven if no one asks, even if nobody reads them, I will still keep writing novels.\n\nIn that sense, the primary motivation is probably self-therapy, and freedom from inhibition.\n\nEven when I am not typing I am always spinning words in my head.\n\nWhat is your typical approach to writing?\n\nI write and fill up a notebook with plot ideas, and then play around with the ideas turning them over in my head. Then ideas for different locations, like in films, come to mind.\n\nI then decide on the camera angles, the sound track, building each episode one-by-one while actually acting them out.\n\nOnce this has been completed to a certain degree, it is only then that I actually start writing.\n\nFrom 5.00 am until noon is my writing time. I repeat writing with running.\n\nI feel as if I am a boxer-type author and also a peripatetic-type author, who keeps on running.\n\nHow long does it take you to write a novel or a short story?\n\nA full-length novel takes about three months, a short story a couple of days to up to a week.\n\nIt has been said that it is fast for the type of intricate and complex prose I write.\n\nThe faster I write the less dense and more concentrated my sentences become. It feels somewhat like automated transcribing.\n\nWhen you are working on multiple pieces how do you avoid getting confused and stay efficient and creative?\n\nIt’s impossible. I can’t write multiple works in parallel.\n\nMulti-tasking is one of my biggest weaknesses, and it isn’t limited to writing.\n\nI can’t cut and change my mood.\n\nDo you have a favourite Japanese phrase, idiom or expression?\n\nThis isn’t avoiding the question, but Japanese has soft and beautiful spoken words that are unique to women.\n\nThis may only be understood by individuals deeply familiar with Japanese. I love the echoes of those words.\n\nIn contemporary Japan these words have been almost completely lost. Authors who reflect or seek reality no longer use such spoken words.\n\nThis is the language of my mother’s time. Even though I am told I am an anachronism, I continue to stubbornly write those words.\n\nWhere do you write? How do you make yourself comfortable when you write and how long is a typical writing session?\n\nI write in a small study. Since I love plants, my study looks like a botanical garden. It makes me feel as if I am writing at the heart of a rainforest.\n\nWhen I have written for ten minutes, I run around inside my home for five minutes, which probably makes me like a boxer. This is my style of writing.\n\nBecause of my hyper-activity I can’t stay still for long. By repeating this I think I probably write for about 6 or 7 hours a day.\n\nHow would you describe your writing style?\n\nI am an author who writes about love. But I am also called a fantasy writer. I think this is because I write narratives that drift between reality and dreams.\n\nI like stories that undo all boundaries. Dream and reality. Past and present. Me and you. And me and the world. As well as life and death. It is the shape of the world that I perceive.\n\nPerhaps it is close to the group that is sometimes described as new wave fabulist authors. They often deal with the themes of life and loss.\n\nSometimes I think it’s romanticism and I am a romantic writer, who is 200 years old.\n\nMy prose uses many metaphors.\n\nTo convey to readers images and emotions that can’t be expressed with words multiple metaphors and symbols are required. Works like this are sometimes called poetic-novels. I also incorporate humour.\n\nI am conscious of the rhythms of language and at times I try to write as if it was song.\n\nHave you ever studied or taken a course in creative writing?\n\nNo, never. Not at all.\n\nI am a totally new type of writer in Japan. I haven’t learnt from previous examples.\n\nOr perhaps it is related to me being on the autism spectrum.\n\nWhen I had my debut as a writer many commented that a new genre ‘The Takuji Ichikawa Genre’ was born.\n\nThat can be taken as either a good thing or a bad thing!\n\nDo you prefer writing novels or short stories?\n\nI have received many requests. But none have come to realisation.\n\nI feel that my work is highly suitable as I write novels with film like imagery in a script-like manner.\n\nBut the problem is working in collaboration and partnership with others.\n\nThat’s the bottleneck.\n\nWhat stops you from being able to write?\n\nWhen I am ill.\n\nAs someone on the autistic spectrum I have various secondary disorders, which create problems.\n\nFor almost 40 years it has been a constant battle with illness.\n\nReading:\n\nDo you still enjoy reading? And how often do you find time to read?\n\nI still read books. There are times when I am reading continuously finishing off many books, and sometimes I might not read a single book in a month.\n\nWhich author and book has influenced you the most?\n\nKurt Vonnegut (1922-2007), John Irving, Michael Ondaatje, John Fowles (1926-2005), Isaac Bashevis Singer (1902-1991) and others.\n\nWho is your favourite fictional hero? And what do you like about them?\n\nThe venerable that appear in books and stories. Those held in contempt, outsiders who despite often being hurt still believe they are beautiful, and continue pursuing their goals, who live without seeking recognition or reward.\n\nIt is the lonely outsiders.\n\nWhen you were a child did you have a favourite book?\n\n世界SF名作集, World Collection of Famous SF Stories, and books by A. E. van Vogt (1912-2000), Edward Elmer Smith (1890-1965), Ray Bradbury (1920-2012), H.G. Wells (1866-1946).\n\nI read them over and over, wearing out their pages.\n\nIf you ran your own book club or belonged to a reading group what books would it be reading right now?\n\nThe Refugee’s Daughter.\n\nI want as many people as possible to understand what today’s world is like, and what ignorance and indifference is causing.\n\nDo you have a favourite website?\n\nNational Geographic, Wired, Nikkei Science, AFPBB News.\n\nJapan:\n\nWhy do you think short format writing from haiku to novella is common in Japan?\n\nI think that more than mythical legends and majestic stories Japanese people prefer everyday tales about life on the street.\n\nWhy do you think international interest is growing in Japan?\n\nJapan is a nation of people that has had faith in 8 million deities.\n\nA polytheistic nation that develops rapidly economically, and communicates its culture to the world, creates a chemical reaction that ignites heat, enthusiasm, from other cultural groups.\n\nOpposites attract. Difference becomes attraction. It is a similar to the fine line between error and creativity that is said to have a gap comparable to the width of a single sheet of paper.\n\nThinking about it from the opposite perspective, Japanese people are also very interested in the West.\n\nThis is an interplay.\n\nIn many different fields including sports such as baseball, and football (soccer), as well as technology and research, Japanese people are building international reputations. What do you think Japanese authors can learn from this?\n\nThis probably depends on the author.\n\nI am an extremely individualist writer, so I don’t think it has much influence on me.\n\nWho do you think is the most interesting historical Japanese figure and the most interesting contemporary one?\n\nKenji Miyazawa (1896-1933).\n\nI am not sure if he is a historical figure, but regardless of that, I am very attracted to the worlds he envisioned.\n\nSakyo Komatsu (1931-2011).\n\nWhen I first became a writer a journalist asked me if there were any famous authors I would like to meet. And I answered Sakyo Komatsu. When I was a child reading his science fiction novels was an obsession of mine.\n\nIs the Japanese literary scene very close-knit and difficult to become part of?\n\nDepending on your definition of the literary world or scene I think Japan is relatively open.\n\nRemaining party to it is probably what is actually harder.\n\nInterests:\n\nWhat are your favourite films and why?\n\nI like horror films. It does depend on the film, but I feel as a genre these films are close to the dreams I have.\n\nThe boundaries between life and death are vague. Reality is just a fragile cover.\n\nIf you look into them and break them down you see unending expanding strange worlds that can’t be depicted or expressed in words.\n\nFor those same reasons I like Andrei Tarkovsky (1932- 1986) and Lucile Hadzihalilovic.\n\nFor me, a film is a dream I wake up to.\n\nHave you ever been in a film and if not would you be interested in being in one?\n\nNo.\n\nI think acting requires a lot of skill. That’s the sense I get.\n\nWhat is your favourite type of music?\n\nDamien Rice, Isbells Rhye, Lana Del Rey, and Sigur Ros are all on my play list.\n\nDo you like karaoke and, if so, which song do you sing most frequently?\n\nI have never been to karaoke, not once.\n\nI sometimes sing and sometimes I sing old folk songs while playing the guitar.\n\nDo you like anime and manga?\n\nI don’t look at them now. But did like old manga and anime.\n\nAnime by Hayao Miyazaki such as Conan, The Boy in Future.\n\nThe number of times I have wanted to watch that vastly outnumbers the others. I have seen it tens of times on DVD over and over again.\n\nYoshimi Uchida’s Colour of Sky, which falls within the genre known as Shojo Manga.\n\nIf you could chose to be a character in a book or film, who would it be?\n\nConan of Conan, The Boy in Future.\n\nHe is unnaturally healthy and strong. I am weak and long to be robust and healthy like him.\n\nDo you have a favourite or special place you like to visit?\n\nThe botanical garden in my hometown. Many of my novels are set there.\n\nWhat is your favourite thing to do on a day off or on holiday?\n\nI like to do the same as I do at the weekends. A change in environment isn’t generally good for me physically.\n\nIt is important not to break the rhythm of my life.\n\nI like going out to the forests and botanical gardens and connecting with greenery.\n\nWho do you think is the most interesting historical international figure and the most interesting contemporary one?\n\nSiddhartha Gautama.\n\nPeople like me, who live in some corner of Asia, have mostly, without being aware of it, been hugely influenced by this one individual, who lived 2,500 years ago.\n\nHe is an Influencer of extraordinary magnitude.\n\nAs for contemporary figures, it would be Masala Yousafzai and Greta Thunberg.\n\nI think it is young people, especially women that can save the world, which is so full of greed and hatred.\n\nIf you could choose anyone in the world (alive or dead) to discuss writing, creativity and storytelling with, who would you select?\n\nWilliam Shakespeare (1564-1616). I think many authors would probably think the same.\n\nAre you a member of any clubs, organisations or associations?\n\nNo, none.\n\nI am the single and only member of ‘The Committee to Increase the Total Sum of Kindness in the World’ and ‘Writers Without Borders’. That’s what I think and want to say, and what that means all depends on what happens from here.\n\nWhich Olympic sport do you, like best?\n\nI used to be an 800 metres athlete, and I am interesting in all the athletics competitions. I often write novels about long distance runners.\n\nLife:\n\nIs there one person who has had a huge influence on you?\n\nWithout doubt my mother. I am a work, created by my mother.\n\nWhat would be the hardest thing for you to give up in life?\n\nMy wife.\n\nWhat has been your happiest moment in your life so far?\n\nEvery moment I am with my wife. It is the treasure of my life, and one that will carry me to heaven.\n\nHow do you cope and manage stress?\n\nContact with my wife. She is my shelter and life support machine.\n\nAfter that it is running, touching green things, and writing novels.\n\nPlease tell us three good to know facts about you that aren’t widely known?\n\nIf I was ever considered as an internationally renowned writer I would hope and aim that my style would be within the middle of a triangle of Jeffrey Eugenides, John Michael McDonagh and Anthony Doerr.\n\nTruth is Henry Darger, (1892-1973), who was famous for being an Outsider Artist and a recluse, is my literary hero. Sometimes I wonder if I should live as he did.\n\nI lost that opportunity when I committed myself to being a writer of the world. There are, however, many things I have gained from that decision.\n\nCompared to him, I have several thousand unpublished manuscripts, but I am being complacent as he wrote more than 20,000 pages of manuscripts during his life that nobody saw.\n\nI am similar to him when I put my own illustrations in my manuscripts.\n\nIn his huge work The Realms of the Unreal he describes seven warrior women who fight against a military state with forced child labour. I have also written a story, The Refugee’s Daughter about a young woman with special powers who tries to save the world from being destroyed.\n\nI don’t feel as if we are that distinct or two different people.\n\nWhen my second book, Be With You, Ima Aini Yukimasu, was made into a hit film in Japan, Warner Brothers made an offer to remake the film.\n\nAt that time the publisher said that 5 million people were reading the book, not the number of copies sold but the readership. So this time let’s aim for 10 million people. I recall them saying that.\n\nThe opportunity flowed away. However, if it had been realised it really would have increased the total sum of kindness in the world. It feels like a great shame.\n\nI’m aiming to neutralise the world full of punishment with a tales about tolerance and kindness. Just as white lime neutralises oxidised land.\n\nWhat is the one thing you always carry with you or in your bag?\n\nWater. I am prone to a special type of seizure, and I need water to calm myself down if I have an attack.\n\nWhat is the minimum amount of cash you like to have in your wallet when you go out?"
