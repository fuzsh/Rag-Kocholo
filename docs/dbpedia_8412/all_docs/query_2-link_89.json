        "text": "Content THE SPACE OF JAPANESE SCIENCE FICTION: ILLUSTRATION, SUBCULTURE, AND THE BODY IN SF MAGAZINE by Kathryn Page-Lippsmeyer A Dissertation Presented to the FACULTY OF THE USC GRADUATE SCHOOL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY (EAST ASIAN LANGUAGES AND CULTURES) August 2016 ii Abstract The Space of Japanese Science Fiction: Illustration, Subculture, and the Body in SF Magazine Kathryn Page-Lippsmeyer This is a study of the rise of science fiction as a subculture in the 1960s through an analysis of the first and longest-running commercial science fiction magazine in Japan: SF Magazine. Much of the research on science fiction in Japan focuses on the boom in the 1980s or on the very first science fictional texts created in the early years of the twentieth century, glossing over this pivotal decade. From 1959-1969, SF Magazine’s covers created a visual legacy of the relationship of the human body to space that reveals larger concerns about technology, science, and humanity. This legacy centers around the mediation of human existence through technology (called the posthuman), which also transforms our understanding of gender and space in contemporary works. I examine the constellation of Japanese conceptions of the body in science fiction, its manifestations and limits, exploring how the representation of this Japanese, posthuman, and often cyborgian body is figured as an absence in the space of science fiction landscapes. SF Magazine was used by consumers to construct meanings of self, social identity, and social relations. Science fiction illustration complemented and supported the centrality of SF Magazine, making these illustrations integral to the production the of science fiction subculture and to the place of the body within Japanese science fiction. Their representation of space, and then in the later part of the 1960s the return of the body to these covers, mirrors the theoretical and emotional concerns of not just science fiction writers and readers in the 1960s, but the larger social and historical concerns present in the country at large. The horrifying and painful mutability of bodies that came to light after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki manifests, in the latter years of the 1960s in science fiction, as the iii fantastically powerful mutating bodies of super heroes and cyborgs within the science fictional world. The bombed spaces of the postwar (largely ignored in mainstream 1960s media) were reimagined in productive ways on the covers of SF Magazine, mirroring the fiction and nonfictional contents. It is through this publication that a recognizable community emerges, a particular type of identity becomes associated with the science fiction fan that coalesced when the magazine began to offer different points of articulation, both through the covers and through the magazine’s contents. That notion of the science fiction fan as a particular subjectivity, as a particular way to navigate the world, created a space to articulate trauma and to investigate ways out of that trauma not available in mainstream works. My work seeks to build on literary scholarship that considers the role commercial and pulp genres fiction play in negotiating and constructing community. I contribute to recent scholarship in art history that investigates the close relationship of Surrealism to mass culture movements in postwar Japan, although these art historians largely center their work on advertising in the pre-war context. Furthermore, my project reconsiders the importance of the visual to a definition of science fiction: it is only when the visual and textual are blended that a recognizable version of science fiction emerges – in the same way the magazine featuring the work of fans blurred the boundary between professional and fan. Hence, although the context of my study is 1960s Japan, my research is inseparable from larger investigations of the visual and the textual, the global understanding of science fiction, the relationship between high art and commercial culture, and contemporary media studies. This work is therefore of interest not only to literary science fiction scholars, but also to researchers in critical theory, visual studies, fan studies, and contemporary Japanese culture. iv Acknowledgements For five years Professor Akira Lippit has served as not just my dissertation committee chair, but as my mentor, advisor, and my inspiration. I always left our meetings filled with confidence, new insights, and the knowledge that I was fully supported in this endeavor. I am also grateful for the feedback, encouragement, and advice of an incredible committee. Professor Henry Jenkins tirelessly offered transformative comments and his perpetual engagement continually inspired me to work harder. Professor Satoko Shimazaki challenged my thinking about the project’s scope and place, and her encouragement gave me conviction to believe in my own analysis. While at USC I also received a great deal of informal support. I am extraordinarily thankful to Professors Anne McKnight and Kirsten Cather who, despite no longer being my formal advisors, continued to offer mentoring, encouragement, and critical interventions throughout this journey. They gave me foundational tools, and I hope my own work reflects in small part their intellectual rigor and commitment to scholarly excellence. Moreover, I am grateful for the mentorship of Professors Miya Mizuta, David Bialock, Sunyoung Park, Vanessa Schwartz, and Laura Serna. Miya encouraged me to do the preliminary research for this dissertation in her Art History class, and her comments on early drafts were invaluable to a scholar trying to find her voice. Without David I do not think my qualifying exams would have properly prepared me for the work you will read in these pages. Sunyoung’s timely comments on my prospectus made me rethink this project into manageable proportions. Vanessa tirelessly created a community of interdisciplinary scholars that made it possible for me to receive critical feedback. And Laura directed the Visual Studies writing group in that community – it it was her insightful feedback that propelled me forward from one chapter to the next. v The project took on intelligent shape through the feedback of countless scholars and friends in writing groups, associations, and at conferences. In Japan, my dinnertime conversations with Tatsumi Takayuki and Kotani Mari helped me think through the present day implications of my project. The thoughtful commentary of members of the USC Graduates Studying East Asia (GSEA) ensured my work was coherent and engaged with the larger discourses of Asian Studies. Some members of the GSEA have been there from the infancy of this project, and I really appreciate the fact that Melissa Chan, Amanda Kennell, Li-Ping Chen, Yunwen Gao, Chad Walker, and Haiwei Liu were willing to think through my work with me time and time again. I particularly want to thank the Visual Studies writing group: Umayyah Cable, Luci Marzola, Joshua Mitchell, Feng-Mei Herberer, Lara Bradshaw, Alison Kozberg, Kevin Driscoll, and Roxanne Samer. These dedicated and kind scholars were not only generous with their comments, they provided shining examples of the kind of intellectual work I hope this project displays. A chapter of this dissertation was presented at the Visual Studies Research Institute’s “Objects of Knowledge” series, where I am deeply grateful Brian Bernards was my respondent because he gave me further insight in how I would like to speak to multiple audiences. Other chapters were presented at conferences for the Association for Asian Studies, the Science Fiction Research Association, and the American Comparative Literature Association. The project benefited not just from the audience members’ questions and suggestions but from fellow panelists’ unstinting encouragement and feedback. This dissertation was generously funded primarily by the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures, and the support of Endowed Fellowships organized through the Graduate School at the University of Southern California. Preliminary training and research was supported in part through the Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship coordinated by the vi Center for East Asian Studies at USC, and in part through the Nippon Foundation Fellows Scholarship coordinated through the Inter-University Center for Japanese Language Studies in Yokohama, Japan. The research for this dissertation was conducted at the National Diet Library in Tokyo, the Harvard-Yenching Library, the Inter-University Center for Japanese Language Studies, and the East Asian Library (part of the Doheny Memorial Library) at the University of Southern California. Over the course of this journey I gathered a group of people from whom I hope I never stop learning. They offered unstinting support in ways too numerous to adequately acknowledge here. But I will try. Helen Page is more than a mother, she is an inspiration and a shining light, and I worked through so many of my fears and my intellectual tangles with her that this work is almost a joint endeavor. Ingrid Levinthal has been my comrade and my confidant: her insights reassured me when I thought everything was going wrong, and her willingness to spend three days a week on my couch writing meant I actually wrote it. Jon and Judy Lippsmeyer may never have become Japanese literature experts, but they also never wavered in their unstinting parental care and bountiful faith in me that made all of this possible. Sam Timinsky, little brother I never knew I needed, offered thoughts on everything from sentence structure to housemate wrangling. Christine Shaw has been my guide through the labyrinth of academic requirements and my cheerleader, always ready to remind me to celebrate life even while she offered line-by-line edits on funding applications. Lola Shehu watched over me and mother-henned me, and kept me on track. Tyler Wilson reminded me when to be sane and when not to be, and made sure I never forgot the wider world out there. And last, but not the least, Elizabeth Barrows kept the light on for me, listened patiently to all my worries and fears, and gave me hope that I could do this and held my hand when I worried I couldn’t. And look, I really did! vii Table of Contents ABSTRACT .....................................................................................................................................................

The white-hot jet of flame from the spaceship’s take off blast sets the alien vista, and the aliens themselves, on fire. However, fire does not touch the more meticulously drawn spaceship or the figures of the humans within. Compositionally, the lurid, bold, easily printable colors that create distinct segmentation of the image along with the rough brush strokes and the representational (but not realist) style encourage the eye of the viewer both to rest on the more realistically rendered humans and to (uneasily) identify with these oppressors. Aliens with their arms writhing in pain from the fiery destruction raining from the sky, their legs curling in contorted dance, indict the conquering humans even as the image promotes identification with them. It recalls (and inverts the politics of) Frank Paul’s 1926 Amazing Stories cover illustration for H.G. Wells’ The War of the Worlds. In that cover (and Wells’ story) Martians with round 1 Nakajima Seikan. “Cover of Space Opera Special Issue.” SF Magazine (SF Magajin). Fukushima Masami, editor. Tokyo: Hayakawa Shobo. August, 1966. Houghton Library collection, Harvard University. figure 1: August 1966 SF Magazine 2 bodies attack London, destroying both humans and buildings with deadly heat-rays and long, wiry tentacles. In this SF Magazine cover, the aliens have gone from attacker to attacked, their tentacles now writhing in fear rather than causing destruction. Parsing this image requires understanding the distinct set of practices and the complex series of codes that have emerged through the production and consumption of science fiction 2 over time. To catch the homage requires knowing that historical colonial narratives have been displaced onto alien worlds in countless science fictions and films; registering the play of iconography and style from earlier illustrations; even being familiar with the history of science itself from country to country. Yet each illustration also deploys these practices in conversation with its own historical context and the larger world around it, melding high art techniques, propaganda styles, comic book sensibilities, and fantastic subjects together in ways instantly recognizable as sf. There are additional features that demand a discursive reading of this image as science fiction. The para-textual markings all place this image in the space of a printed magazine. From the giant yellow SF, the cool katakana lettering spelling out Magazine (magajin), the kanji in smaller font above the title that reads fantastic science fictional magazine (kusou kagaku kagaku shōsetsu shi), the announcement in white on black signaling this is the “space opera special issue”, to the list of authors from Edgar Rice Burroughs to C.L. Moore. There are rules for reading magazine covers: name recognition, signaling content genre through tag lines, and enunciating specific contents (in this case, fictions by well-known authors) that must already be known to be fully recognizable. The sum of the image, including its subject and its ephemera, along with the size, weight, and cheap pulp paper of the magazine, which tell us how this 2 Throughout this work I will use the phrase “science fiction” or abbreviate it to the more colloquial “sf” in order to visually differentiate it from the capitalized “SF” in SF Magazine, although all three terms could be used interchangeably. My translations and citations will use the capitalized “SF” to reflect original sources. 3 illustration should be read: as science fiction that both introduces content and interrogates tropes of excessive power deployed in exploration and alien-encounter narratives. Each magazine cover illustration signals it is in conversation with a past series of images and production histories because it draws on them to create new images. I call this the discourse of science fiction illustration – it is established not through a single image but through the network of connections, both aesthetic and paratextual, that allow the image to be read. In other words, the image can only be identified as science fiction because we, the viewers, have already encountered other illustrations, other films, other fictions, and other visions of science fiction that help us understand this one – other black ships, other roving aliens, other red-sky planets, other colonial relationships, other space operas – other things that are labeled “SF.” The science fiction magazine reader, as they read the magazine, becomes conversant with the codes that make up some of that discourse. Learning authors’ names, investigating other words, seeing films with similar labels, reading other magazines that also have similar stories: all of these activities provide context, and within that context, allow understanding. It is important to note that this series of actions is not restricted to science fiction consumers but includes the illustrator Nakajima Seikan, who created the image, and the editor of the magazine Fukushima Masami, who collaborated with Nakajima to design each cover. The ability to create a coherent image that is both recognizable and recognizably science fiction comes from the illustrator, author, and editor’s abilities to engage with and deploy recognizable codes in the proper space. Reading sci fi as a relationship between visual and textual discourses The August 1996 cover is just one example of the intertwined relationship between the visual and the textual in science fiction. These two distinct types of production have been 4 conceptualized and studied as separate subjects because they fit into two different categories of media. My project demonstrates the intertwined nature of word and image, and how these together constitute what we mean when we invoke the term “science fiction.” Of course, I am focusing on a particular media, a particular culture, and a particular moment in science fiction because it allows me to unpack some of the nuances of the relationship between word and image which become startlingly clear in the particular iteration. My project centers on the Japanese SF Magazine because it is the first commercial magazine of science fiction in Japan, and as such represents a transitional moment for science fiction as a genre both within and outside of Japan. Prior to its production, science fiction in postwar Japan was largely the province of children. While there were adult fans, an organized fan culture was not clearly established. Because SF Magazine was the first commercially successful magazine of science fiction geared towards adults, it took pains to craft and debate the definition of science fiction in its pages. The magazine established links with, but differentiated itself from, the world of Anglophone science fiction. Moreover, editors, artists, writers, and fans created definitions of science fiction in Japan that persist to the present moment, including a specific engagement with space and the body. In this introduction, I locate the magazine in the history of mass culture in Japan, particularly in its relationship to literature. I articulate the rise of the new consumer subject in postwar Japan and how this relates to the expansion of mass culture. The 1960s in Japan was a period of social change, particularly as rapid economic growth contrasted sharply with social protests, and changes in consumer status were complimented by the uneven transformation of the physical landscape of Japan in rebuilding from the war. Japanese navigated within these tumultuous social spheres. The transformation of consumer culture, particularly the social and 5 political events that are an explicit part of the construction of the magazine’s content, are critical not just to my reconceptualization of science fiction as a visually textual discourse, but also to the broader relationship of fiction to both its visual and historical moment. My discussion of fan studies in this introductory chapter situates my own work and periodizes my intervention. I conclude with an overview of the subsequent chapters. My work reconsiders the importance of the visual to a definition of science fiction: it is only when the visual and textual are blended that a recognizable version of science fiction emerges – in the same way the magazine featuring the work of fans blurred the boundary between professional and fan. On the one hand, this dissertation contributes to scholarship investigating loss, social transformation, and trauma as it relates to postwar Japan. This includes the work of historian Igarashi Yoshikuni, whose critical historical intervention Bodies of Memory: Narratives of War in Postwar Japanese Culture 1945-1970 argues the body is the sight upon which Japanese postwar society played out its struggle to understand national loss and trauma in popular culture. I am inspired by Mark Williams and David Shahl’s Imag(In)ing the War in Japan : Representing and Responding to Trauma in Postwar Literature and Film collection, which takes up a variety of texts in order to resituate literary, film, and artistic practice to “fill in the ‘gaps’ in our historical knowledge and understanding of the traumas of the Asia Pacific War.” 3 On the other, my project contributes to recent scholarship in art history that investigates the close relationship of Surrealism to mass culture movements in postwar Japan. This includes Gennifer Weisenfeld’s work on advertising in the pre-war and trans-war context, as 3 Williams, Mark, and David Shahl, eds. Imag(In)ing the War in Japan: Representing and Responding to Trauma in Postwar Literature and Film. Boston, MA, USA: Brill Academic Publishers, 2010. 5. 6 well as the work of Miryam Sas and Alexandra Munroe on avant-garde art, performance, and highbrow manifestations in the postwar. 4 Moreover, I situate this project along with other emerging work on genre literatures in Japan. My work considers the important role of science fiction in influencing the relationship of fiction and technology in postwar Japan, much like Sari Kawana, in Murder Most Modern: Detective Fiction and Japanese Culture, articulated the close relationship between detective fiction and definitions of the modern. Just as Christine Marran’s Poison Woman: Figuring Female Transgression in Modern Japanese Culture considers the poison woman (or dokufu) as their narratives move through time through time, the shifting meanings of these women, and the dokufu’ s influence on defining women’s sexuality and place in Japan, my own work studies the ways science fiction, and more specifically, SF Magazine, reflected cultural concerns. Concerns about the relationship of humans and technology, the definitions of the self and place within a technologic world order, as well as the relationship between image and text. Hence, although the context of my study is 1960s Japan, my research is inseparable from larger investigations of the visual and the textual, the global understanding of science fiction, the relationship between high art and commercial culture, and contemporary media studies. The rise of the new middle class and a new consumer subject The new consumer subject in the Japanese postwar is related to the rise of a new middle class. However, the evolution of the Japanese middle class has historically been associated with 4 Weisenfeld, Gennifer. MAVO: Japanese Artists and the Avant-Garde, 1905-1931.

Although there was a new construction of middle class in the postwar, the notion of a middle class – and middle class consumers – can be recognized in earlier periods in Japan’s history. This section outlines some of the interconnections of the middle class and consumer culture to ground my discussion of the postwar middle class in a larger historical context. Though literary scholars studying the widespread distribution of texts in Japan point first to the vibrant popular culture that flourished in major metropolises during the Tokugawa period (1603-1868), historian Carol Gluck argues the first rise of the middle class in Japan went hand in hand with the rise of industrial capitalism in the Meiji period (1868-1912). 5 It was in the following Taisho period (1910s and 1920s) that the apparatus for large-scale distribution of texts as part of a commerical and ideological project were firmly established. The rise in mass media included the widespread consumption of magazines by both genders and a prolifieration of print materials ostensibly targeted at consumers along gendered lines. 6 The articulations of these consumer-subjects were produced in various sites: magazine layouts, theater costumes, language, literature, department stores, and cinema spectacles. However, the consumer-subject was not only the middle-class worker who had enough money to purchase the material goods, but also included those who consumed the spectacle of those goods. As Silverberg argues, “the consumption of images of objects rather than the objects themselves was central to Japanese 5 There were multiple waves of rising middle class in Japan. The first in the Meiji period, the second in the interwar years in early the early Showa period, and finally in the postwar beginning in the 1960s. Gluck, Carol.

Although the media apparatus and instutions were increasingly coopted by the Japanese government in the lead-up to the war, they were not eradicated, but rather placedin the service of heavy-handed state ideology during the interwar years, and continued to fuel the wartime state until resources became scarce near the end of the war. Even so, Marily Ivy argues in her article “Formations of Mass Culture” that to suggest there was no discontinuity in what constituted mass culture from pre- to post-war is to do a disservice to our understandings of both periods, as in the postwar there arose “different technologies of dissemination, logics of production, patterns of consumption, and circuits of control” 8 that included the American regulation and censorship of media in the early postwar period, a shift in individual identification, and transformation in the thrust of mass culture publications. Rebuilt from the devastation of war through manufacturing, Japan in the postwar also underwent a transformation in the structure of large corporations that sourced workers from an increasingly educated populace; white-collar work grew hand in hand with the ability to work outside of one’s town because of the new infrastructure (trains and concrete) put in place as part of national rebuilding efforts. Daily lives of Japanese were transforming during this period as well, because, as Simon Partner notes, “Japan during the 1950s and 1960s embarked on what was at that time perhaps the biggest orgy of technology importation in history.” 9 The 1960s 7 Silverberg, Miriam.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000. 107. 9 might also be termed the age of the consumer in Japan, as it was the first time the importance of the consuming power was taken into account by government and industrial production alike, with new laws and guidelines put in place to encourage and regulate this new economic force. Alongside these technological and legal changes, anthropological studies chart the building in the 1950s of a “new middle-class” as popular aspirations, the shape of institutions, and even the psychology of society were increasinly influenced by large companies and their white-collar employees. 10 Changes occurred not only in labor, but also in the social and political institutions, organization of population, and in lifestyle for a number of Japanese, that related to the rise in white-collar employees and the shift away from what Ezra V ogel termed the “old middle class” of shopkeepers, small business people, and government professionals. 11 The move from “old” to “new” middle class was more than a transition of the flow of weath. V ogel argued that it was the ability to draw a regular salary under stable conditions that came to be expressed in specific lifestyle standards and aspirations embedded in communities and social institutions. By the mid 1950s the job of salaryman became not just a position one held but also a lifestyle one lived (or aspired to live). The pervasiveness of this aspirational ideal was also linked to the increasing numbers of those who transitioned from working in the family business to working at a corportation. Gordon notes that “[t]he proportion of family workers in the labor force dropped from two-thirds of all in the late 1950s to under half by the end of the 10 Moreover, due to this widespread dissemination of a flattened identity, according to political scientist Inoguchi Kuniko, more than 90% of Japanese in the 1980s identified themselves as occupying the “middle” when asked about their social circumstances. Inoguchi Kuniko, \"Chūryū to wa shōhi no kategori datta no ka,\" Chōu keron, July 1985, 86. 11 Vogel, Ezra F . Japan’s New Middle Class. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2013. 10 1960s.” 12 Others, including Robert Smith, Theodore Bester, Dorrine Kondo, and Jennifer Robertson have expanded on V ogel’s work to complicate and nuance this notion of a “new middle class,” but few contest the notion that it was during this period that lifestyles were becoming regularized, reflecting affluence, and drawing ever closer to a single idealized mainstream norm. 13 It was through a variety of media, particularly mass market magazines, that these regularizations took place. Magazines were part of a media industry focused on selling models of status. As Marilyn Ivy notes, “[t]hese new mass-market magazines and (later) television, along with the older media of radio and newspapers, showed the consumers what they should be, what they should aspire to, what they should consume in order to confirm their middle-class status.” 14 She argues that in Japan there exists, when the Japanese word “mass” or masu is invoked, a leveling of consciousness concerning class distinctions; thus, by the 1960s, there were “strikingly uniform and standardized taste groupings” 15 differentiated more by gender and generation than by class or regional affiliation. But this flattening also meant the aspirational lifestyle included owning specific technologies like the refrigerator, the television, and the washing machine. .Later in the 12 Gordon, Andrew.

The imbrication of Japanese imperial control and mass production ostensibly ended with American occupation and the transformation of Japan to a free electorate. Censorship and state control, however, explicitly persisted under American rule. Even after the newly elected Japanese government officially proclaimed the post-war period over in 1952, state-controlled censorship continued, though it began to shift from the ideological control of speech in the press to the newly instituted laws on indecency. 16 My invocation of the notion of consumer-subject is intended to articulate a consumer who is simultaneously the subject of production as well as a subject with agency, less bound up or constricted by explicit state involvement or control than those who lived in the Taisho and early Showa periods. Contributing to the history of fan cultures My work contributes to the conversation about the rise of the “fan” in general and the rise of Japanese “fans” in particular. I consider fans and their relationship to science fiction and more broadly to texts through this magazine. This is a history that began in prewar Japan. Most Japanese literary scholars, including Karatani Kojin, associate the Meiji period with the upsurge in attempts to define, create, and produce a modern literature (including a modern vernacular language and realism as a literary technique) in Japan and to separate “pure literature” from “popular literature” (junbungaku and taishūbungaku). The ideological work surrounding these 16 Allison, Anne. Permitted and Prohibited Desires: Mothers, Comics, and Censorship in Japan. University of California Press, 1999. Print. 12 productions and divisions is the beginning of where we see fans who claimed a separate identity for themselves related to their consumption of particular products or texts. This dissertation fits into a broader conversation within literary studies that contributes to this notion of fans being constantly bound up with texts. While many scholars I cite below discuss non-commercial fan culture in the contemporary moment, their notion of a fan as someone who is an active participant in the fictions they consume (and go onto produce) is key to my own analysis of the operations at work in SF Magazine. On one side of the current conversation about Japanese fan culture, fans are imagined as the ultimate consumers whose power comes from their intense desire to purchase all of the many and varied pieces of a transmedia property (book, film, anime series, manga, toys, character goods, etc); 17 mass media companies in this model exert time and money attempting to create texts that will appeal to this collector fascination in order to meet or exploit those needs. On the other is the discussions of fans as simultaneous producers, raising questions of fan respect to the “original” writer-creator or their copyright, vision, intention. Media scholars and fans themselves are critically exploring the production and consumption of fan works as reimagination or at times expansion of the original texts (or in some conservative Japanese views as “perversions”) that destabilize the notion of individual authorship. 18 Like Jenkins in Textual Poachers when he describes fans via de Certeau as “nomads” (in particular nomadic readers), 19 I see the investigation of fans as an investigation of a reader/producer that has a multiplicity of practices – the fan as a nexus of consumption. That includes high and low, and works that do not 17 see work by Anne Allison, Azuma Hiroki, Mimi Ito, and Marc Steinberg 18 see work by Azuma Hiroki, Ian Condry, Karen Hellekson and Kristina Busse, Henry Jenkins, and John Fiske 19 Jenkins, Henry. Textual Poachers: Television Fans and Participatory Culture. New York: Routledge, 2012. 36. 13 exclusively live in one sphere or the other. Fans are knowledgeable about consuming and even creating the products of mass culture, as well as the products of high culture. When I speak about fans, I am defining them in a constellation of theory that is engaged with thinking about reading and writing practices, and which is influenced in many ways by Roland Barthes and his notions of the reader as the producer of the text they are reading (most commonly referenced in his essay Death of the Author but mentioned also in his (post)structuralist reading of Sarrasine, S/Z). 20 Barthes suggests common conception of authorship as a single inviolate subjectivity that creates a work (be it fiction, music, photography, or any other text consumed by another) is a misunderstanding of the operations at work. Rather, at the moment of writing, the author is simultaneously an act of individual destruction and the beginning of the performance of a variety of narrative codes – as Barthes puts it, “it is the language which speaks, not the author; to write is, through a prerequisite impersonality, to reach the point where only language acts, ‘performs’, and not ‘me.’” 21 Put simply, the text that is produced is a blend of everything that has come before it: cultural codes, conventions, conglomerations of everything read and heard before writing, a kind of text he calls the “writerly” text. This in turn results in a different kind of reader, one who does not simply decipher the authorial meaning in a text, but rather produces meanings while reading that are contingent and unauthorized. Hellekenson and Busse, in thinking about American internet fandom, suggest that we define fan as someone who produces new texts in a “writerly” mode of reading. 22 They propose that fans, when they create their own fanworks, are in fact engaging 20 Barthes, Roland.

Fan Fiction and Fan Communities in the Age of the Internet: New Essays. Jefferson, N.C: McFarland, 2006. 14 with the source text over and over again in pleasurable enjoyment of it, and that this engagement is a kind of agency that allows them not simply to uncritically consume (and be manufactured by) mass culture, but also to transform the products of mass culture into popular culture that serves their individual needs. Azuma Hiroki suggests a periodization of a specific type of Japanese fan who is labeled with a Japanese name: otaku in his book Otaku: Database Animals. For Azuma, an otaku is someone who “indulge[s] in forms of subculture strongly linked to anime, video games, computers, science fiction, special-effects films, anime figurines, and so on.” 23 He argues these people are the inhabitants of a distinct subculture, the “otaku subculture.” This subculture’s history begins not at the end of World War II (when other scholars including Slaymaker and Allison place it), but rather with a cultural break at the end of the 1950s. At that time, Japan was no longer under America’s occupation and the country was economically succeeding; this was also when the Japanese government re-ratified the “Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan” (originally signed in 1952) that declared the United States would act to maintain peace in East Asia on the behalf of Japan and maintain military bases in Japanese soil. In 1959, there were massive protests by student groups, labor unions, and everyday Japanese who gathered in the hundreds of thousands in front of the National Diet Building, the seat of postwar Japanese government. 24 This, for Azuma, was the end of one kind of history and the beginning of another: Azuma theorizes otaku are themselves posthistorical, and that in order to understand fannish consumption and production we must restructure our 23 Azuma, Hiroki. Otaku: Japan’s Database Animals. Translated by Jonathan E. Abel and Shion Kono. English ed. edition. Minneapolis: Univ Of Minnesota Press, 2009. 3. 24 This treaty is being weakened by the current Prime Minister Abe. He has proposed modifying the Treaty to allow Japanese military to send soldiers to foreign conflicts, and this has incurred similarly widespread protests, this time against the perceived re-militarization of Japan. 15 understanding of how they consume narratives. 25 I will return to this move from “fan” to “otaku” later in the chapter, but I think it is useful to follow these arguments about postmodernism and mass culture in part because of what they can tell us about the shifts in cultural production, particularly a breakdown of the lines between junbungaku and taishūbungaku. On that order, Benjamin in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction interrogates the notion of art as original, and attempts to work through a methodology that acknowledges mass production where the “aura” of an object (the historical grounding, the tradition, the presence of authenticity) is detached from it by the plurality of copies that are substituted for a unique existence. Benjamin suggests that this transition, from a mode of consumption that was hierarchical and based on a singular work (the person standing in front of the unique work of art, or the people who were allowed into churches to see art but whose relative proximity was determined by their social standing), to a mode where multiple copies can be consumed in personalized circumstances (the reproduction of a work you hang on your living room wall) is also a transition in mode of perception. Benjamin is discussing the industrialization of Europe and America, not Japan. But his work can be read as echoing 25 Before I move onto this, however, I want to address Azuma’s central argument. He is critical of Fiske-inspired notions that that culture (and the process of making culture) is a social process, and argues against the notion that popular culture comes into being as the individual uses the tools of mass culture to make meaning of daily life. Instead, via Kojeve’s notions of the database, he theorizes that in the postmodern moment there is no meaning that is possible to be made by otaku - rather desire is structured around “consumer needs [that] are satisfied immediately and mechanically, without the intervention of the other.”(Azuma, 87) While Fiske argues the rise in the study of culture, and subcultures, and fan studies like this one, have the potential to illuminate the very individuals who are adept at using the tools of mass culture to create their own meanings, Azuma theorizes this new kind of consumption by fans is “depthless” and that “otaku have abandoned the substance of sociality but still maintain its form.” (Azuma, 93) Azuma suggests fans do not create, but instead have a subjectivity “motivated by ‘the need for small narratives’ at the level of simulacra and ‘the desire for a grand nonnarrative’ at the level of database;…a new view of humanity [as] a database animal.” (Azuma, 95) Fans only break up larger narratives into smaller ones, and the only work that they do is to find ways to further consume. This rather grim view of fans and fan practices is predicated on the otaku’s being only partially satisfied by simulacra, and so they are caught up in an endless cycle of consumption that is never sated. Azuma Hiroki. Database Animals. 16 alongside the developments of mass culture in Japanese history. To do so we have to look for a transition in modes of perception in the Edo period, again in Meiji, and finally in postwar Showa. There is evidence that of the simultaneous changes. The rise of print culture in Edo made a variety of different products available to and targeted for new classes of people (including samurai and merchant): popular fiction, woodblock prints of a variety of subjects including famous places (but also advertisements), and new shorter kinds of poetry. It is change of an order of magnitude when we look at the rise of newspapers and magazines in Meiji and Taisho that went hand in hand with the reforms on education that spread literacy further than in the Tokugawa period, and the self-conscious production by the Japanese government of Japan as a modern nation-state and its citizens as a modern public. Another rapid change occurred (again) in Japan’s postwar period - the widespread destruction during the Pacific war changed attitudes towards the technological, including the technologies of mass textual distribution. 26 The status of fans are extremely different depending on the period. The consumption practices of fans who were collecting prints of Kabuki actors in the Edo period distinct from those of the women reading magazines or train fans who were collecting in the Taisho period. These women readers’ practices are different than the otaku who are consuming science fiction today. One of the things that distinguishes the mass culture in the Edo and the Meiji periods is the industrialization occurring at the time – while there was certainly the production of many texts we associate with mass culture, the industrialized subject whose life is impacted by machines, factories, and the organization of labor becomes truly visible only in the Meiji period with the rise of a middle-class. 26 Again see Chapter 3 for a discussion of the mass publishing boom in the late 1950s, 1960s, where publishing went from 400 magazines to 2000 magazines in the space of about 15 years. 17 Historical shift and the shaping of post 50s fan culture Rather than attempting to locate an origin point for fans, I want to bring up a constellation of practices that occurred in the Meiji and Taisho periods during those times that relate to fan practice today. For instance, Christine Marran examines the way popular poison- women narratives in Meiji were consumed as the “other” to the modernizing male subject. These narratives were works of popular fiction, and Marran is careful to note that the sensationalizing aspects of these fictions in the Meiji were part of the pleasure of their consumption. I will further discuss the consumption of the other as part of self-identity formation in my later chapter on mass publishing in the 1960s. Yet Marran also describes women in the Taisho period who adapted these narratives and began creating “confessions” of their own moral depravity in testimonials that both revealed their sexuality and repudiated their actions. Although I would not categorize these women as fans as they were not the primary readership, their adaptive strategy is considered one of the markers of fan activity. Fiske notes that fans often adapt the tools of mass media for their own ends: in this case taking as models women who murdered their husbands and using the style of this revelatory confessional for their own ends. 27 Jennifer Robertson, in her work on the Takarazuka Review, notes the term “fan” (fuan) actually entered into Japanese language in the 1910s. 28 She, along with Maeda Ai, points to evidence of discussion in newspapers and magazines about the proper conduct and legislation of ‘new women’ who were entering the public sphere to consume a variety of mass culture. Robertson points to a 1935 issue of a popular women’s magazine that contained images of the 27 See my discussion of John Fiske in Chapter 4. 28 The Takarazuka Review is a Japanese all-female musical theater troupe based in Takarazuka, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. Women play every role in the lavish theatre productions. These include Western-style musicals, stories adapted from Japanese folktales, and shōjo manga. 18 five different types of Takakarazuka fan (courtesan, early bird, poetic, copy cat, bodyguard), and also references an editorial in a newspaper that rants against Japanese women being unruly at public performances (unlike a mythical Western female counterpart, who is invoked as a model of control). We see here the importance not only of the consumer as someone who reads magazines, but also of the way the magazines themselves construct narratives about these subjects, attempting to simultaneously describe and legislate these definitions while also confirming their existence and their power in a system of consumption. Maeda Ai’s work on the development of popular fiction in the Taisho era reminds us that it was in 1926 that the first magazine on popular fiction (called Taishu Bungei/Literary arts for the masses) was launched. Maeda suggests that the rise of popular literature in the 1920s is due to the establishment of a middle class that emphasized education for women, and the prevalence of women’s magazines and journals aimed at this emerging readership. The magazines do not simply contain popular fiction written for women and about them (although there were certainly stories like these in the pages), but also include works by Tanizaki and other junbungaku writers. Maeda notes that many of the junbungaku writers who published in these pages did so because the magazines allowed them different opportunities than the literary magazines of the day – they published longer works there as the magazines were less conservative than newspapers, so much so that some cultural critics concluded women’s magazines were one of the main outlets for literary publication. We see here that the distinction between high literature and popular literature is not as clearly marked as subsequent literary scholars would make it. Additionally, Maeda quotes Suekichi Aono (who in 1925 was analyzing differences between pure literature and popular fiction readers) as saying the readers of popular literature were mostly women and 19 they were part of the intelligentsia! This problematizes a notion of popular fiction reader as uncritical, as someone who is not male and not familiar with high literature. However, I do not want to be too grand in my proposition – I do believe we have to acknowledge the breaking of many aspects of mass culture during the Pacific War. As Anne Allison notes in Millennial Monsters, not only were many industries (like the film industry) co- opted during the war for the ideological purposes of the state, but widespread shortages during the war lead to the scarcity of many of the materials of mass production, including paper to print. The wartime state ideology imposed a variety of restrictions on mass culture production, including but not limited to censorship. The American occupation, while it also brought the first of the materials needed to rebuild cities and even paper stock to help reestablish the press, reinforced strict controls. Even if the occupation’s ideological aims were different (as film censors wanted to purge the industry of ideological films and have the industry focus on escapist pleasure, while magazines and newspapers were enlisted to tout the miracles of democracy), there was a great deal of control and restriction until the 1950s. I mark the postwar period as different because people had a very different relationship to technology. In the Meiji period, we see the expansion of a variety of technologies into daily life, including trains, electricity, telephonic service and the like – these were seen as having enormous potential to transform life. Even though this industrialization was not always seen as beneficial, as massive transformation brought anxieties about the modern subject reflected in works like Soseki’s Kokoro and Tanizaki’s Chijin no ai, the concentration of fears was about losing a specific cultural identity based on an influx of cultural products (films, education, literature). Unfortunately, the war itself provided a terrible demonstration of the absolute worst uses of the most advanced technologies in the deployment of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 20 and it caused a certain kind of widespread distrust of technology on a scale never seen before. It was in the resulting occupation period that Japan was in some ways forcefully integrated into the cultural logic of late capitalism, illustrated by Frederic Jameson in Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, as the American occupation sought to instill liberal democratic “ideals” in the occupied Japanese populace that included a celebration of technological advancement. This paradoxical and complex relationship to technology is constantly negotiated in exploration of science in science fiction in Japan. The term otaku emerged in this postwar context. Toshio Okada, unlike Azuma, suggests that the word came into play when fans of emerging anime culture began describing themselves in the 1970s, and was then picked up by newspapers and magazines in the early 1980s. Azuma retroactively separates otaku culture in historical or generational periods. He has three foundational sets: the first were those in the 1960s who consumed (science fiction) products, whereas the second set in the 1970s had more choices of product but consumed texts which themselves remained part of the older type of narrative. In the 1980s, he suggests, there is a break: the prosperity of the 80s in Japan frees both the country and anime from the constraints of history in a Jamesonian notion of postmodernism, and the otaku begin to take on the characteristics of the consumers in the latter generations. But Tsuji Izumi, in his chapter on trains in Fandom Unbound, suggests that Train otaku have their foundations in the late Taisho period (1912-1926), while Mizuko Ito, in her introduction to the same volume, proposes that “otaku culture” emerged in the 1980s as a marginalized geek subculture. The term became particularly associated with pejorative meanings in 1989 when a man named Tsutomu Miyazaki, who had abducted, murdered and mutilated four girls, was revealed to be a fan of manga and anime, particularly of the pornographic kind. Otaku as a term 21 was then pathologized, associated with obsessive deviant behavior that could ultimately lead to violence by someone withdrawn from regular social life, who inhabited a fantasy worlds of video games and manga novels. Yet over the next twenty years the term has been rehabilitated in some respects, culminating in the popular Densha Otoko story of an otaku whose attempt to save a girl from being harassed on a train rehabilitates him as a functioning, romantically engaged member of society. In many ways, Azuma’s periodization is the most nuanced because it leaves room for the practices of otaku culture to be located in the postwar production of mass culture industry in the 1950s and 1960s. It is in these decades that we begin to again see the spread of magazines as the arbiters of both mass and literary culture, much the same as they did in late Meiji and early Taisho, but with much broader reach. Here too is when the publisher Hayakawa Press began their domination of the science fiction and fantasy market. Tsuji Izumi suggests this is also the moment when there is a shift from consumers who are focused on militaristic education/imagination to imagining the “society of future.” Azuma’s characterization of the 1960s otaku as being primarily consumers of goods must be modified to take into account the ways in which science fiction fans interacted with SF Magazine during this period and the way they were part of this movement away from militaristic imagination and into the future. Reflecting in some sense the Benjaminian trajectory, Tsuji’s discussion of ‘train otaku’ is helpful because he notes the shift from putting together single trains to elaborate train sets: a transition he describes as a move from individual models to an emphasis on world building. His analysis starts in the mid-1920s, with fans who were engaged in making miniature versions of the trains that began populating the country. These were handcrafted pieces that mimicked the trains ridden everywhere in urban daily life, and the emphasis was placed on individual 22 (re)production of scale models. He notes the Railway Club established in 1954 shifted production (of handcrafted individual trains) to collection (of plastic models that were mass produced as promotional items by train companies in the postwar). The Train-fan was now intent on collecting all of the different models, rather than on creating their own. They began to build train sets instead of individual trains. This is a shift that seems a reversal of the relationship I outlined in my introduction of fans as simultaneous consumers and producers, yet Tsuji argues the shift from free-form models into plastic models also included a shift from single reproductions into kits that allowed the mimicking of an entire landscape of trains. Instead of building the individual car, the Train-fan built the environment (including tracks) to run his pre- fabricated train on. Even the scale shifted so that the focus now hinged not on individual locomotives but on the interlocking of a variety of electric cars together with the rails and the railroad scenery. Fans now could create entire villages and purchase trackside accessories, moving beyond the trains themselves and into the land the trains passed through: the world of the train. Tsuji links this expanding play space to the rise in science fiction being published in the period. The importance of Tsuji’s contribution to my argument is that his case study articulates a history of fans in Japan that is much longer than Azuma’s, and articulates fans as both consumers and producers. I am in no way suggesting that fans began creating communities only in the 1960s. Nor am I arguing that science fiction in Japan started in the 1960s either. Instead, this section is meant to broadly outline the number of histories that precede my own work. People interacting with media as fans also has a long practice, and Tsuji’s case study is a particularly compelling one that reflects this history and the agency of fans within that history. What my work does is consider how these two different strains (science fiction being produced prior to this 23 point, and fans organizing themselves around communal interests prior to this point) coalesced around this particular magazine. In the 1960s adults consuming science fiction created a more structured and recognizable community. They had previous models of fan practice, previous histories of media consumption, and previous texts of science fiction to build on. Tsuji’s identification of the movement from individual trains into an emphasis on world building supports my contention that the operations within fan communities were during this time very interested in creating spaces separate and distinct groups within the larger culture, the very definition of the word subculture. His work also reveals that what constitutes fan practice, even within a singular fandom, is constantly changing. It is not enough to consider the organization of fans into communities, their interactions with media products, and the media products they are reacting to. We must also consider the interactions of fans with the larger cultural and social constructions of their time. From content to concept: chapter overview In my first chapter, I present the magazine and its context. I first describe the anatomy of the first issue in order to delineate the unique space in which fictional, nonfictional, and visual content was presented. SF Magazine joined a history of science fiction in Japan that stretches from the beginning of the modern era to the present moment, and this chapter outlines both this history and discuss the environment in which these subject circulated in the 1960s, particularly underscoring the events cited by the magazine itself. In my next chapter I propose a reading of science fiction not as a genre, but as a form of translation – not translation of one written or spoken language to another, but rather from the visible discourse to the written discourse and back. This theoretical provocation is informed by 24 Akira Lippit’s arguments that it was atomic light that destroyed the boundary between outside and inside that had been troubled by both x-ray and cinema. In this blast of atomic light the difference between text and illustration is also exploded. My theories of science fiction illustration in this second chapter contribute to the relatively small field of American theorizations about science fiction art and aesthetics, but also articulate the differences between American and Japanese illustration. To do so, I first draw on the body of critical work conceiving of science fiction as a distinct entity as proposed by Samuel Delany and Tatsumi Takayuki. I engage with the theorization of science fiction art by George Slusser, who insists science fiction centers on the human amidst technology. Finally through a close reading of Benjamin and Derrida’s work on translation, I explicate the creation of science fiction as a continual act of translation to underscore how sense is made through this process of translating between the written and visual language. By comparing covers from the Japanese magazine that predominately focus on landscape with covers from American and Japanese magazines that feature the body in my third chapter, I establish the discursive field through which I am reading postwar Japanese sci fi. I argue SF Magazine and science fiction in the 1960s were concerned with “space” as distance, as gap, as differentiation, and as landscape in order to work through the trauma of the war. SF Magazine’s illustrations stood at a distance from both American science fiction and other mass magazine styles in the 1950s in Japan. The magazine covers continually articulated landscapes and astral phenomena – making visually concrete their remove from other genres, cultural forms, and ways of considering loss. These landscapes were markedly absent bodies (icons that were the preoccupation of both mass Japanese publishing and American and British science fiction magazines). Moreover, the style of illustration was a new form of popular surrealism, invoked to 25 lend the magazine an air of the adult, the serious, and the highbrow as well as to adapt a style of representing the psychological to the evocation of the visual, elevating science fiction from its place as part of children’s fiction. I chart the development of the magazine, which went hand in hand with the establishment of a more organized science fiction community, from 1960 through 1970, in my fourth chapter. This solidification is reflected in the representation of bodies on the covers of the magazine, beginning with their appearance as insubstantial shadows. These bodily shapes, in their very mutability, are continually reworking the bombed and misshapen Japanese bodies in the postwar. Over the course of ten years, these shadows gained shape and solidity just as the community took shape outside of the pages in newly formed writer’s groups and the first Japanese conference on science fiction. The definition of science fiction writer/fan/reader was explored, defined, and redefined in the pages of SF Magazine, and became a clear kind of identification with modes of thinking and viewing the world. This commercial market was not divided, as other markets like journalism are, into producers and consumers; instead, the magazine itself had distinct ways of blurring the boundaries between science fiction writer, fan, and consumer in both the fictional and nonfictional content. As a result of understanding science fiction as both the visual and the textual, as well as an iconography of the body (even when absent), I conclude by considering the way this melding of the visual and the textual on the body has developed in later works. I address Japanese science fiction subjects and the Japanese science fiction subculture in a study of fictional posthuman characters in two science fiction works – Kurahashi Yumiko’s Extraterrestrial (Uchujin), and Ōhara Mariko’s Girl (Garu). Because Kurahashi was part of the literary establishment, her extraterrestrial stands apart from the science fictional world, and the alien posthuman in her story 26 acts as a metaphor for the alien nature of sf fandom to the literary. Ōhara is a writer produced within the world created by SF Magazine, and her posthuman characters are marked by her entrenchment in this world. Both create fantasies of mutable posthuman bodies in flux, transitioning in a variety of ways. These transitions are precisely why I situate my project in this particular time with a focus on SF Magazine; the magazine is part of a rich and important period in defining what sf means as an adult genre in Japan, whereas the Ōhara story is evidence of the legacy left behind by the magazine and the fandom created by it. What constitutes the boundary of this culture may be in flux, but moments of vast expansion or particularly fervent creation and participation that the practices that inform the contemporary moment become clear. 27 Chapter One: The Anatomy and Context of SF Magazine Just as the structure of an argument both supports and creates the knowledge conveyed, SF Magazine’ s structure was built to support multiple tasks: entertainment, education, and community. SF Magazine expanded the notion of science fiction so that it became its own socially and commercially successful adult genre. Additionally, the magazine legitimated science fiction as serious endeavor, separating it from its roots in juvenile fiction by consistently combining science fact and non-fiction with socially, politically, and ideologically critical fictions. In creating a sense of community, SF Magazine had many small features that prompted reader engagement and investment. This chapter presents the contents of the first magazine in detail to delineate how the structures of each issue complemented the magazine’s project. The scope widens to present a history of science fiction publishing in Japan and how the magazine fits into that history. The last section situates the magazine and science fiction more broadly within the major historical moments of the 1960s, particularly those that reverberated in the pages of the magazine itself. With a first issue totaling 144 pages, the magazine was a standard five-inch by seven-inch size, printed on pulp paper and dominated by black-and-white text and images. However, many issues included glossy two-color inserts for special sections, and the index was always two-color as well. After the first two years, the binding was modified from staple to glue and began to accommodate text on the spine. The magazine expanded page year by year count until, by 1969, the magazine often had more than three-hundred pages per issue. The cover illustrations, unlike those for American science fiction magazines published at the same time, illustrated some facet of science fiction itself, rather than illustrating a particular 28 fiction published in the issue. These graphics were designed by the cover illustrator in consultation with editor-in-chief Fukushima Masami. Occasionally, for special issues (like the robot special issue of SF Magazine May 1960, or the Last World War issue of SF Magazine May 1963), the cover served as an aesthetic take on a monthly theme also reflected in its contents. However, this was not an illustration of a particular story, but rather a way to take up the theme of the issue visually. The index, which contained two-color graphics as well as textual listings of the contents, was always preceded by the editor’s introduction, a single page with a few paragraphs that both offered editorial musing on the contemporary moment and highlighted specific content in the magazine. For the first three issues, this introduction offered a definition of the science fictional contents in the magazine as well as a greeting to the readers. 29 The index lists the fictional stories in large bold fonts, with both author and translator in smaller text. In 1963, SF Magazine featured two fictions by a Japanese author in each issue of the year, while most of the other Japanese commentators contributed non-fiction articles. For the first five years, at least seventy percent of the fiction published by SF Magazine was fiction-in-translation from primarily American, British, and occasionally Soviet authors. It is only in the latter half of the 1960s that the magazine began to feature more Japanese fiction authors. Through the end of the 1970s, the magazine kept a mix of sixty-percent translation to forty-percent Japanese fiction. 29 The first of these notes is cited in its entirety in Chapter 2. 29 figure 2: Index of December 1959 SF Magazine The table of contents of the first issue (figure 2) shows the dynamic interplay of the visual and the textual at work inside the magazine. The mechanical turquoise gears are mimicked by the graphic elements of the textual listings – the color blocks that highlight the titles of certain fictions and nonfiction content. The copyright permission printed in green ink serves as both a round curve leading into the corner graphic and an informational text. The two-color printing of the index allowed colorful graphics to surround the text listings. These images that often took up an element from the magazine’s cover illustration and reproduced or modified it to create the sense that the cover image was linked explicitly with the contents of the magazine. In this first table of contents, there is a clear division between fictional 30 and non-fictional content (fictional on the left, non-fiction articles and notes on the right), though in later issues this division was not maintained. The size of the fiction title text makes it clear that these are the featured pieces. Over the years, the table of contents would adopt a variety of layouts, but the larger text for important articles or fiction was always preserved. In this issue, the use of the turquoise blue to highlight the text separates Arthur C. Clark, Robert Sheckley, and Isaac Asimov’s fictions from the others, and links them with the non-fictional sections on Space Rockets and an article on man-made weather control. The color-coded linking of nonfictional content with fictional content is one other way clear boundaries are continually crossed in the pages of SF Magazine. Readers might pick up a magazine because they wanted to read new fictional stories. However, they might also be drawn to the nonfictional content that was grounded in scientific perspective even when it occasionally veered towards the highly speculative. 30 The fictions included here are not generic space exploration stories, but instead show the range of science fiction from the cerebral to the comedic. The index is a Who’s Who of authors who were not only popular but also considered the standard bearers for writing new and exciting science fiction in the late 1950s: Robert Sheckley, Phillip K. Dick, Ray Bradbury, Issac Asimov, Lester del Rey and Arthur C. Clarke. 31 These works, primarily written in the five years before SF 30 In some ways this is the reverse of American sf magazine history, where the early magazines began as popular science magazines with just a few fictional stories per issue. 31 This first issue contained translations of Robert Sheckley’s “The Prize of Peril” (about a man who goes on a TV show in which he must evade people out to kill him for a cash prize); Phillip K. Dick’s “Explorers We” (about a lost mission to Mars and the resulting alien invasion) published in F&SF Jan 1959; Richard Matheson’s “The Edge” (where a man slips into an alternate dimension that is just like, and yet unlike, his own) published in F&SF August 1958; Ray Bradbury’s “All Summer in a Day” (where a child in school on Venus tries to explain her experience of the sun to other children who have never seen it) published in F&SF March 1954; Robert Bloch’s “That Hell- BoundTrain” (a young man trades his soul in service to a hell-bound train for the ability to stop time when he finds his perfect moment) published in F&SF September 1958; Isaac Asimov’s “The Dying Night” (a murder mystery hinging on the murderer from Mercury expecting the night to last forever) published in F&SF July 1956; A. Bertram 31 Magazine was published, were only newly translated into Japanese. The magazine prided itself on the rapid translation, and readers were excited to encounter these fictions for the first time in Japanese. They were also works that sought to explore both individual and social subjectivity embedded within technological innovation. Through these choices, even in this first issue, there is a continual construction of science fiction as both an abstract and a realist endeavor. Beyond the fiction, it is the non-fictional content that defines science fiction as something that can inform, almost as a kind of newspaper offering science discoveries. Two nationally-respected scientists, Japan’s first rocket scientist Hokawa Higeo and Japan’s first meteorologist Arakawa Hideoshi, contribute articles that speculate on the present and future of technology. Their respective pieces, “Space Rocket” (which considers the technological requirements for extant space programs) and “Man-made Weather Control” (focusing on the possibility of man exerting technological control over the environment) do not seek to tell an explicitly fictional story with unreal characters, and yet they both describe imagined events based on extant scientific evidence. Additionally featured are the translation of Asimov’s nonfiction speculative essay the “Dust of Ages,” and the first part of a three-year series by science critic Kusaka Jitsuo on the history of the earth from our understandings of atoms to the end of the universe called, somewhat prosaically, “Earth’s Story.” Asimov’s article begins with up to date scientific knowledge about the movement of dust from one part of the universe to the other, and somewhat romantically considers how this dust is wiped up by housewives all over America. Kusaka’s work, which summarizes what the atomic Chandler’s “A Critical Angle” F&SF Nov 1958. Copyright uncredited but just as important, the issue also included Arthur C. Clarke’s “Rescue Party” (aliens arrive on Earth to save the people from our sun dying and find humans have already created rescue ships with rocket technology) published in Astounding May 1946 and Lester Del Rey’s “Helen O’Loy” (where Dave and Phil create the perfect female robot, Helen, who both men love), published in Astounding 1938. 32 structure is and how all stars are made out of specific atoms, reads much like a modern day scientific textbook couched in easily readable language and addressed to lay people. Separate from its educational or instructional value, the magazine included a component that is quite common in entertainment magazines, but essential in forming a collective canon for readers: the critical review. This issue featured the first of many discussions of science fiction in other media. Film critic Okashu On contributed an article titled “The turn to science fiction film” in worldwide filmmaking, in which he argued major interest in science fiction film began with the 1950 Destination Moon produced by George Pal. He goes on to discuss sf film as it was being created in the American film industry. Later issues would include summaries of science fiction film screenings, art exhibitions, and summaries of sf conventions both within and outside Japan. Inside the offset box, the index lists other recurring special non-fiction sections that continue the blending of the educational and the entertaining: science topics (short summaries of new scientific discoveries) and science fiction library (discussion of particularly interesting or foundational authors and texts, which later became reviews of new books), as well as listing the short notes embedded within the texts of the fictional stories. These short notes are editorial glosses that informed a reader who is presumed to not be particularly embedded in the history of science fiction of the meaning of certain terms or the significance of a particular word or translation. This first issue included three notes: a note on the use of the term “Space Station” in fiction that explains how its meaning had come to symbolize a particular city in space as well as describe satellites; a note on the “Crab Nebula” accompanied by a small black and white photograph of this particular celestial configuration of stars, and finally, a note on “SF fiction – The name’s origins”. 33 The drawings, designs, and black-and-white photographs that accompany the text portion of the magazine is particularly noticeable compared to other magazines of the time in both Japan and the United States. For example, SF Magazine’ s American counterpart The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (F/SF Magazine) was barren by contrast. While every single segment of SF Magazine is introduced with a title that contains an element of graphic design, and most of the fictions have a half-page or full page illustration as part of their introduction, F/SF Magazine’ s November 1958 issue contains only two images: the stylized F/SF logo at the close of stories and, at the end of the “Science” section that presents Assimov’s “Dust of Ages” essay, a single two-inch drawing of a beaker amidst a starry universe. This holds true for other magazines published by Hayakawa Press, including Ellery Queen’ s Mystery Magazine (Erari ku’inzu misuteri magajin) whose abstract covers were the inspiration (in part) of the cover style of SF Magazine. While EQMM’ s contents have some of the same dynamic insets and column breaks, only sketches of simple square-lined patterns introduce the translated fictions. SF Magazine’ s illustrations continually create visual splashes that supplement the written text. The first editor’s note embedded in the text on the origins of science fiction provides us with one genealogy of science fiction styles to follow, and clearly shows the variety of words used to describe production of this kind of fantastic fiction in Japan. A doodle of a thorny spiraling branch in the corner of the border articulates visually the complexity of this history. However, in these very same magazine pages the term science fiction was standardized (opposed to, as you will see below, any number of names including fantastic science fiction, science romance, and older Japanese literary terms): 34 figure 3: Note on the origins of the term science fiction Already there are hardly any people who don't know the word 'science fiction' [katakana: saiensu fikushon]. Yet it’s possible that there are surprisingly few people who know the beginning of the term's usage isn't very old. The christening of this type of fiction \"science fiction\" [English] was done by that most elder statesman Hugo Gernsback thirty years ago in 1929, printed in Science Wonder Stories. Before this name was in use there were many varieties. First, the founding father of fantastic science fiction [kanji: kusōkagakushōsetsu] Jules Verne who wrote the first work of scientific fantasy adventure [kanji: kagakuteki kusōbōken] \"Five Weeks in a Balloon,\" that appeared in the French world newspapers as a \"V oyages Extraordinares\" [French] -- and it was called in English a \"Scientific Romance\" [English] or scientific romance [kanji: kagaku katakana: romansu]. Subsequently, H.G. Wells' works used the name \"Science Fantasy\". In the 1900s there were many new terms that appeared: “off trail stories” “different stories” “impossible stories” [English] and others were used, roughly translating to “derailed” “different” “absurdity” [kanji: dassenshita, kawatta, kōtōmukei]. But the interesting name suggested by the sellers and receivers of SF [roman letters] in those days that became popularized was “pseudoscientific stories,” [English] even though it wasn’t a comfortable term. But Gernsback wasn’t satisfied with that term, and he was a man who was a scientist himself who had the belief that fantastic science fiction [kanji: kusōkagakushōsetsu] must have the truth as its scientific foundation. Therefore he created “scientification” [English]…. 32 32 Fukushima Masami. “The origins of the term science fiction,” SF Magazine. December 1959, 17. (see Introduction, n. 1) This and all subsequent translations are mine unless otherwise noted. 35 While I mentioned above that most of the editor’s introductions in the first few years of publication also defined science fiction over and over again, the term is slippery enough that Fukushima devoted the first editorial note of the first issue to the term’s history. Naming is part of the process that calls an entity into being, and this terminology was critical to the new magazine and the audience it was attempting to develop. This passage presents but a few of the myriad names being used by writers both international and Japanese, using both English and French words untranslated into Japanese as well as translations into katakana (used for foreign loan words) and kanji. I have tried to indicate through brackets just how many languages are being evoked here, and how even when rendered in Japanese these terms are all variations indicating the slippery nature of the object that being created, sold, and consumed by readers. This first note creates not just a trajectory of the name, but a genealogy of the “great luminaries” of the genre. These are not just writers but also editors, and this narrative links the shift in terminology to their actions within the community. This is a list of individuals who create worlds, beginning with Jules Verne, who was a particularly popular author in the 1920s and 30s in Japan. 33 The mention of H.G. Wells and Hugo Gernsback next shows the importance of a single author and then the emphasis moving from author to editor. There is already a transnational pathway charted here, from France to England to the United States, and then to Japan. I’ve used an image rather than retyping the text because style and context are just as important as the words themselves. In this single entry, there are twenty different names for this genre presented – some in Romanized English, some in Japanese kanji, one in Japanese katakana, and some in mixed Japanese kanji and katakana. The science fiction reader can clearly 33 Nagayama Yasuo. Japanese SF Intellectual History: From End of Edo/Meiji to Postwar (Nihon SF seishinshi: bakumatsu, meiji kara sengo made). Tokyo: Kawade Shobō Shinsha, 2009. 36 read comfortably enough in English and French to understand the name of the genre in each language, and yet is also presented with a timeline and important figures that require knowing and knowingness – the “father” of science fiction of course came first, and the “elder statesman” of science fiction performed the work after. And it was in the pages of this magazine that the term “science fiction” and the shorthand “SF” pronounced “esu fu” in Japanese came to be routinized through constant use, and invocation, and discussion by writers and fans alike. Distinguishing SF Magazine from other sf works Science fictional works that speculated on future events and the integration of technology into daily life were produced in conjunction with the increasing industrialization in Japan during the Meiji and into Taisho periods, 34 and those interests never entirely died out through either war. However, during the rise of these types of writing, the boundaries between science fiction, detective fiction, and horror and macabre stories were unclear – devices like ghosts and dreams were mixed with speculations on the future or revisions of the past. Novels themselves were not necessarily grouped into their own genre – rather, genres like the Meiji period political novel used science fictional devices like visiting other worlds to perform sharp social and political criticism on the present moment. The term “science fiction” (kagaku shōsetsu), along with the romanized “SF,” came into widespread use through the popularization of the terms by SF Magazine, as I noted above. Until that point novels with what we might consider science fictional content, when identified in a genre, were called any number of names including “imaginative science novels,” “science novels,” “science romance,” and the like. Additionally, 34 See Nagayama Yasuo’s Japanese SF Intellectual History, Christopher Bolton, Istvan Csicery-Ronay Jr. and Takayuki Tatsumi, eds. Robot Ghosts and Wired Dreams: Japanese science fiction from origins to anime. 37 throughout the pre-war period shorter format science fiction was often found in the pages of other types of genre magazines, like Ellery Queen’ s Mystery Magazine, Jewel, 35 and children’s magazines like New Youth (Shinseinen). 36 Additionally, the 1930s “consumer-subjects” (a term coined by Mirriam Silverberg in Erotic, Grotesque, Nonsense) survived and transformed through the postwar to emerge as a newly invigorated consumer class who voraciously consumed the products of a rebuilt magazine publishing industry. 37 The 1950s are not only an ideological break discussed by many mass culture scholars, including Frederic Jameson and Marilyn Ivy, who propose a fundamental change in the way mass culture operates that has to do with the rise of reproductive technologies. 38 There was also a material, physical break where the country was decimated by war and mass media were censored, first by the Japanese authorities, then American Occupation. Only in the 1950s were factories rebuilt, changing people’s relationship to technology– and it was only then that presses started up again in part to support the postwar American occupation rhetoric of democratization. It is into this environment in the 1950s that an increasing number of publishers began offering translations of American and English science fiction novels, a tradition that had begun in at the turn of the 20 th century with the incredibly popular translations of Jules Verne novels. During the 1950s, the Hayakawa Press, along with now defunct Gengensha, entered into the science fiction publishing field by putting out translations of American and Soviet works in 35 For instance, the mystery magazine Jewel (Hōseki) featured a “World Science Fiction” special issue in 1958 even though the regular contents of the magazine were a mix of mystery, fantastic, and weird stories. 36 I discuss the way in which editor Fukushima Masami sought to distance SF Magazine from these other publications in Chapter 2. 37 Silverberg, Miriam. Erotic, Grotesque, Nonsense. (see Introduction, n. 7) 38 Ivy, Marilyn. “Formations of Mass Culture” (see Introduction, n. 8) 38 paperback form. In 1956, Gengensha released a First Science Fiction Collection in novel form that contained works by Robert Heinlein, Ray Bradbury, and Robert Sheckley. Prior to the development of SF Magazine, Hayakawa too had organized several different book series including the Juvenile SF Series in 1950 and Hayakwa Fantasy in 1956. Kodansha put out their own SF Series in 1958. 39 All of these publishers were meeting a growing interest from the public and a growing market for science fictional stories, and while the interest in translated foreign works was high, none of these book series created a sense of community and engagement in the way SF Magazine was able to achieve. SF Magazine isn’t the first magazine that exclusively published science fiction in Japan. The American sf magazine Amazing Stories published a Japanese-language version of its own magazine in conjunction with publisher Siebundō Shinkō in 1950, but the magazine stopped publication halfway through the same year. The title of “first Japanese science fiction magazine” has generally been awarded to a publication from 1954 called Seuin (Nebula). It was published through the auspices of the Japanese Science Fiction Association, a short-lived association of writers, editors, and publishers established by Ōta Chidzuo in order to promote the magazine. Ōta served as the editor in conjunction with publisher Mori no Mishisha. The magazine bore the subtitle kagaku shosetsu (lit: science fiction), as well as the same words in English. Unlike SF Magazine, which is still publishing new issues today, Seuin was only a single issue that collected translations of American and Soviet detective and science fiction. Even though Seiun became the title of the yearly award given to the best science fiction, this name is largely its only legacy as Ōta Chidzuo did not contribute further to the field. 39 Fukushima Masami. Time of Origins: A Man’ s Memoirs of Building Japanese SF (Mitou no jidai: Nihon SF wo kizuita otoko no kaisouroku). Tokyo: Hayakawa Paperback JA, 2009. 39 Additionally, in 1957 the dōjinshi (reader-produced non-commercial) magazine Stardust (Uchūjin), edited by translator Shibano Takumi, began as a magazine for alien/UFO-enthusiasts. Early issues included translations of global science fiction, and later published Japanese authors. While this magazine continued to publish these through 2013, it was released irregularly 40 and the scale of distribution could not match the commercial reach of SF Magazine. The two did maintain a fairly close relationship. As Tatsumi Takayuki notes, “promising fan-writers were discovered in Uchujin, then promoted as professionals in Hayakawa’s SF Magazine.” 41 I’ll explore the tight relationship between professional and non-professional further in Chapter Three. SF Magazine, originally published in 1959 and continuing today, has a far greater impact on the field of sf because of its sustained history, its focus on an adult audience, and its creation of a community. Science fiction as a genre worth publishing in an adult magazine was not taken seriously until the entry of SF Magazine in 1959. From the first issue, through cover artwork, editors introductions and notes, essays, and even iconography within the pages, SF Magazine separated itself from both the juvenile and the overly technical. Moreover, the first ten years of SF Magazine are often heralded as the Golden Age of Japanese science fiction because of its intersection with the formation of a community. During this period from 1960 to 1970s, the growth of a whole host of activities beyond the publishing of Japanese language and translated novels shows how science fiction came to be considered a separate genre. The first Japanese science fiction convention was held in 1962, the writers 40 Sometimes only one or two Uchūjin were published a year. 41 Tatsumi, Takayuki. “Generations and Controversies: An Overview of Japanese Science Fiction, 1957-1997.” Science Fiction Studies 27, no. 1 (2000). 105. 40 association Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of Japan (SFWJ) was formed in 1963, and the Seunshō award for science fiction was created in 1970. In the 1970s, a larger public interest in science fiction was sparked by a variety of media works and the World’s Fair “Expo ‘70” held in Osaka; a number of prominent sf writers consulted on the fair. Komatsu’s Japan Sinks became a best seller in 1973, the incredibly popular anime Space Battleship Yamato and Mobile Suit Gundam were aired on television in the late 1970s, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Star Wars, Alien and even Superman were imported film hits that held a large place in the Japanese imagination during this decade. A number of new adult-oriented science fiction magazines sprang up, including the quarterly NW- SF (New Worlds of SF) in 1969, Bizzare in 1974, and SF Jewel in 1978. In 1975 Tsutsui Yasutaka named the theme of the 14 th annual Japanese SF Convention “Diffusion and Penetration of SF”, and Japanese science fiction writer and critic Morishita Katsuhiro suggests this title applies to the 1970s themselves. This proliferation of interest in science fiction, shown by the success of these publications, would not have been possible without the contributions of SF Magazine, which continued to be a force in the industry throughout this time period. The success of this flourishing subculture had its most prolific moment in the 1980s and the early part of the 1990s. Though Morishita points out, in his article on the history of Japanese science fiction, that while more contemporary authors began using science fictional elements in their literary works, the science fiction magazines one by one began to die out. By the beginning of the 1990s SF Magazine again stood alone as the only adult science fiction-specific magazine in Japanese publishing. While the proliferation of science fictional anime, m"
