        "text": "Prolific Sci-Fi Author Passes Away at Age 80 Authors: Andrew Nguyen and Keith Aiken Source: Nippon 2007, Science Fiction Studies, Mainichi Daily News, various\n\nJapan’s science-fiction community lost one of its grand figures recently with the passing of Sakyo Komatsu on July 26, 2011 from pneumonia. Born January 28, 1931 in Osaka, Komatsu graduated from Kyoto University with a degree in Italian Literature in 1954. In 1961 he entered the Hayakawa Science Fiction Competition, a story contest co-sponsored by Hayakawa Library, publisher of SF Magazine (SF Magajin), and the Toho Motion Picture Company. He received an Honorable Mention and 5000 yen for his entry Peace on Earth (Chi-ni Heiwa), a World War II story set in an alternate timeline where Japan did not surrender in the wake of the atomic bombings. The next year, Komatsu won the contest with his story Memoirs of an Eccentric Time Traveler (Ekisentoriki), which was published in SF Magazine. Sakyo Komatsu soon became one of Japan`s most prolific and popular science fiction writers. In 1963, he did his first work in the film industry with some uncredited contributions to the story treatment for Toho’s horror film MATANGO, and his story The Taste of Green Tea Over Rice (Ochazuke no Aji) was nominated for the Naoki Prize (Naoki Sanjugo Sho) by the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Literature (Nihon Bungaku Shinko Kai). His first novel, The Japanese Apache (Nihon Apachi Zoku) sold 50,000 copies in 1964 and was soon followed by Day of Resurrection (Fukkatsu no Hi). The following year, Espy (Esupai) was serialized in Weekly Manga Sunday magazine, and Komatsu worked on the treatment for Tsuburaya Productions` unmade television series WOO. 1966 saw the acclaimed At the End of an Endless Stream (Hateshi Naki Nagare no Hate Ni). Komatsu`s most famous novel was Japan Sinks (Nihon Chinbotsu), in which the shifting of the tectonic plates resulted in earthquakes across the entire nation and causes all of Japan to crumble into the sea. The book was published in March, 1973 and was a massive hit, selling over 4 million copies in Japan alone. The novel won the 27th Annual Japan Mystery Writers’ Association Award and the Japanese National Science Fiction Convention`s Seiun Award, was translated into a dozen different languages, and received positive reviews from foreign press like The New York Times and The Christian Science Monitor. An English language edition of Japan Sinks was released in the US in 1976. A second edition appeared in the US in the aftermath of the 1995 Kobe Earthquake with a new opening statement by the author."
