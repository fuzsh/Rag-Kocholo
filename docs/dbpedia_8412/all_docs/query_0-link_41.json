Have you seen the movie(avalible right now on youtube, but i dont like to sit in front of a comp and pressing new scenes ever 9 minute).\n\nIf you have, what did you think?\n\nIf you havent, then here is the story: One day geologist find out that Japan will sink into the sea and a race against time begins to find countries willing to recive the refugees. In the mean time volcanos(Mount Fuji is one of them) erupt and massive Earthquakes.\n\nJust a few corrections and a bit more info:\n\nJapan Sinks, or Nihno Chinbotsu, is the title, not The Sinking of Japan.\n\nIt was published in 1973, not in the 80s.\n\nThe author is Sakyo Komatsu (a home boy from here in Osaka).\n\nIt's SF, not AH.\n\nConsidering that it's one of the few Japanese text SF works available in English, and s a SF fan living in Japan, of course I've read it. However I've only read the old 1976 translation, which has some problems with it. Mainly the translator was a literary translator, and has no scientific background. This leads to poorly explained science and such howlersas computer \"softwear\". Also, it's a bit dated. And you'll need a map of Tokyo and Osaka. But overall quite enjoyable.\n\nDidn't see the remake\n\nI think that was a 'conventional' SF novel, not AH...\n\nIndeed it is.\n\nI think it would go to ASB... continents (or for that matter, island arcs ) cannot \"sink\"...\n\nAFAIK, the science was well reasearched. The premise is that the plate tectonics around the Japan Trench shift in such a way that all of Japan ends up being subducted.\n\nHahaha...apparently there's also a movie called \"Everything but Japan Sinks\" which is also available on Youtube. lol.\n\nWouldn't mindchecking that one out.\n\nAFAIK, the science was well reasearched. The premise is that the plate tectonics around the Japan Trench shift in such a way that all of Japan ends up being subducted.\n\nSorry, it can't have been well researched because that is simply not possible. Isostatic equalibrium, anyone? First, off tectonic plates cannot switch in their direction from one day to the other, and furthermore, tectonic plates move very slowly (at a rate of a few centimeters per year), so even if Japan was being subducted under oceanic crust, they'd have all time of the world to leave...\n\nFurthermore, even if you dismiss all the science I've mentioned thus far, and assume Japan \"sinks\" at an insanely fast speed (by geological terms), you have to consider this: a subduction wouldn't be a \"sinking into the sea\", it would be a sinking into the crust / upper mantle. And it's more than likely that some new mountain range (of folded up oceanic crust) ontop of a subduced Japan."
