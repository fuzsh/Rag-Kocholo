        "text": "1973 novel written by Sakyo Komatsu\n\nFor other uses, see Japan Sinks (disambiguation).\n\nJapan Sinks (Japanese: 日本沈没, Hepburn: Nippon Chinbotsu) is a disaster novel by Japanese writer Sakyo Komatsu, published in 1973.\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nKomatsu took nine years to complete the work. It was published in two volumes, both released at the same time. The novel received the 27th Mystery Writers of Japan Award and the Seiun Award for a Japanese novel-length work. The English translation was first published in 1975. In 1995, after the Osaka-Kobe earthquake, a second English edition (ISBN 4-7700-2039-2) was published. The English translation is abridged [citation needed]. In 2006, a sequel to the novel, co-authored with Kōshū Tani, was published.\n\nThe novel has led to works in other media as well as a sequel: a film based on the novel made in the same year directed by Shirō Moritani, a manga adaptation written by Takao Saito and published in Weekly Shōnen Champion in 1973–74, a television drama by TBS and Toho broadcast in 1974–75, a film remake in 2006 by Shinji Higuchi, a parody created in 2011 that features reverse disaster, an original net anime series released on Netflix by Science Saru in July 2020, and a reboot drama, Japan Sinks: People of Hope, broadcast in October 2021 on TBS.\n\nGeophysical background\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Plate tectonics\n\nJapan is on a destructive plate boundary, where the Philippine Sea Plate subducts the Eurasian Plate. It is a triple junction and three subduction zones are involved. After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, towns like Ishinomaki subsided.\n\nPolitical background\n\n[edit]\n\nThis novel is now seen as an important look into the cultural context of 1970s Japan, particularly due to its level of popularity.[2]\n\nAnime adaptation\n\n[edit]\n\nJapan Sinks: 2020日本沈没 2020\n\n(Nihon chinbotsu ni-zero-ni-zero)GenreScience fiction, drama[1] Original net animationDirected byMasaaki Yuasa (chief)\n\nHo Pyeon-gang (series)Written byToshio YoshitakaMusic byKensuke UshioStudioScience SARULicensed byNetflixReleasedJuly 9, 2020Runtime25–32 minutesEpisodes10 (List of episodes)\n\nAn original net animation (ONA) series adaptation of the novel was announced on October 9, 2019.

It was released worldwide by Netflix on July 9, 2020.[3] A film compilation version of the series was subsequently released in Japanese theaters on November 13, 2020.[4]\n\nSummary\n\n[edit]\n\nShortly after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, a major earthquake hits Japan. Amidst the chaos, the Mutou siblings Ayumu (a 14-year-old track and field athlete) and her younger brother Gou (a 7-year-old video game enthusiast) attempt to escape the city with their family and friends. However, the sinking Japanese archipelago complicates their escape. Plunged into extreme conditions, the Mutou siblings believe in the future and acquire the strength to survive with utmost effort.\n\nVoice cast\n\n[edit]\n\nCharacter Japanese voice actor English dub actor Ayumu Mutō (武藤 歩) Reina Ueda Faye Mata Gō Mutō (武藤 剛) Tomo Muranaka Ryan Bartley Kaito / Kite Kensho Ono Aleks Le Haruo Koga (古賀 春生) Hiroyuki Yoshino Billy Kametz Mari Mutō (武藤 マリ) Yuko Sasaki Grace Lynn Kung Kōichirō Mutō (武藤 航一郎) Masaki Terasoma Keith Silverstein Osamu Asada (浅田 修) Daiki Hamano Jamieson Price Nanami Miura (三浦 七海) Nanako Mori Abby Trott Kanae Murota (室田 叶恵) Tomoko Shiota Cathy Cavadini Kunio Hikita (疋田 国夫) Umeji Sasaki Doug Stone Saburō Ōtani (大谷 三郎) Taichi Takeda Kim Strauss Daniel Gensho Tasaka George Cockle\n\nEpisode list\n\n[edit]\n\nNo. Title Original release date 1\"The Beginning of the End\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Owari no hajimari\" (Japanese: オワリノハジマリ （終わりの始まり）)July 9, 2020 ( ) 2\"Farewell, Tokyo\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Saraba, Tōkyō\" (Japanese: さらば、東京)July 9, 2020 ( ) 3\"A New Hope\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Aratana Kibō\" (Japanese: 新たな希望)July 9, 2020 ( ) 4\"An Open Door\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Aita Doa\" (Japanese: 開いたドア)July 9, 2020 ( ) 5\"Illusion\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Iryūjon\" (Japanese: イリュージョン)July 9, 2020 ( ) 6\"An Oracle\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Orakuru\" (Japanese: オラクル)July 9, 2020 ( ) 7\"The Dawn\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Yoake\" (Japanese: 夜明け)July 9, 2020 ( ) 8\"Mom's Secret\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Mama no Himitsu\" (Japanese: ママの秘密)July 9, 2020 ( ) 9\"Japan Sinks\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Japanshinku\" (Japanese: ジャパンシンク)July 9, 2020 ( ) 10\"Resurrection\"\n\nTransliteration: \"Fukkatsu\" (Japanese: 復活)July 9, 2020 ( )\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 72% approval rating based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 6.54/10.
