        "text": "Sakyo Komatsu is a Japanese science fiction writer who is regarded as one of the country’s finest science fiction writers. The central topic of Sakyo Komatsu’s “Take Your Choice” is the ability to choose one’s own future. Although the audience may have selected a different result than the main character of the story, some may have expressed sympathy for his motivations. The reader is allowed to believe whatever they like about the theme. There are occasions to make a judgment on the character’s conduct throughout the novel.\n\nThe topic that most strikes out to me is the power of choice. He chooses the option that is filled with sadness and misery over the alternative that leads to a world of transporting drones, artificial cities, gorgeous landscapes, and architecture (Komatsu). He has two excellent options, yet he decides to live in a world in which the Holocaust is almost certain to occur. In his defense, he thought the option made sense. That alternative would allow him to deviate from his usual routines and happenings.\n\nWhen people have the ability to select their own fate, this could lead to disaster, as the main character discovered. The main takeaway I took away from reading this story was that if you do not let fate do its job, you can wind up conscious. If I had the opportunity to pick my own fate, I doubt I would have selected the unavoidable road.\n\nWork Cited\n\nKomatsu, Sakyo. Take your choice. 1967."
