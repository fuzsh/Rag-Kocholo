        "text": "​\n\nHaving gone through a failed marriage with Ronald Cheng (鄭中基), and ending a 5 year relationship with William Chan (陳偉霆), it seemed that love was not in favour of 34 years old Charlene Choi (蔡卓妍) these past recent years.\n\nHowever since meeting through mutual friends Laurinda Ho (何超蓮) and Ma Tian Yo (馬天佑) , Charlene has reportedly been spending a lot of time with Anthony Shi (石恆聰), aka the Mahjong Prince due to the numerous mahjong properties owned. There has been numerous sightings of the couple going out and even spending a few nights over in Anthony's luxury home.\n\nThrough an interview Charlene admits she is currently very happy with this budding romance but was reluctant to share more details. \"We are very happy at the moment, thank you for everyone's concern but let's focus on something else now\"\n\nShiga Lin (連詩雅) also gives her blessing to ex-boyfriend Anthony having known him for many years and hopes for him to be happy. She also declined to comment on details about their previous breakup.\n\n~~~\n\ncred: mingpao"
