        "text": "STRICTLY NO COPYING\n\nNews without the photos\n\n10 September\n\n\"Continue Leslie Cheung concert\" will be held at Hong Kong convention and exhibition centre, which is held by Hong Kong radion station 881930. Other artists to perform include Alan Tam, Sandy Tam,Tony Leung, Jacky Cheung,Karen Mok, Deanie Yip,Anita Mui, Eason Chan, Anthony Wong, Edison Chen and Nic Tse. Leslie knew Edsion and Nic since they were little and so they looked up to him like a teacher and friend, which is why they were invited to perform.\n\n29 August Alan Tam & Hacken Lee\n\nTime: 20:15\n\nPlace : Sydney Entertainment Centre, Australia\n\nCategory 1: $141.00\n\nCategory 2: $101.00\n\nCategory 3: $ 71.00\n\nCategory 4: $ 51.00\n\n16 August\n\nEdison Chen will be part of solar project music concert.\n\n11 August\n\nEmperor yesterday invited 14 of its idol artists Nicholas Tse Ting Fung, Eason Chan Yik Kun, Dave Wang Kit, Joey Yung Cho Yi, Twins, Boy'z, 3T, Ng Ho Hong, Isabella, Koey and others to the EEG Showroon opening ceremony.\n\nNicholas danced with the lion dancers and ate lettuce out of the lion's mouth for good luck, then insisted on sharing with Eason and Wang Kit. Joey and Twins pretended to eat it as well.\n\nKelly will be releasing her Cantonese album together with her earlier Mandarin album and she had specially traveled to Spain to take pictures for the album. Her most memorable experience was to dress up in bull-fighter gear. As Kelly does not know anything about bull-fighting, the director managed to get a bull-fighter to coach her skills and poses. The coach had kept praising Kelly to be pretty and Kelly had initially thought that what he had was only a courteous remark. Unexpectedly, he even expressed his love for her and wanted Kelly to be her girlfriend. Kelly was frightened by his remarks and was at a loss. She had to walk away smiling pretending that she did not hear him. She did not expect men from Spain to be so express their love so openly.\n\nFor the photo shoot, Kelly had donned tailored bull-fighting gear that weigh about 10 pounds. She also had to continuously flag a 20 pound red cloth under the guidance of the director. Although it was tiring for Kelly, she felt that it was worth her efforts as the effect was good. Kelly's only regret was that she was unable to take a picture with a real bull. This was because, once a bull was released for fighting, it had to be slaughtered later to prevent it from endangering people.\n\n10 August\n\nThe Worldwide Chinese New Talent Singing Contest was held for the Hong Kong Region and all three top prizes went to 17-year old Chan Wai Ting, taking the \"Best Performance\", \"Best Individual Talent\" and \"Golden Mic award\". The other award for \"Audience Popularity\" went to Yeung Chun Yin. A group of EEG's stars including Nic Tse, Twins, Boyz and Joey Yeung all made appearances as guest stars.\n\nNicholas Tse sung \"Yuk Wu Deep\" (Jade Butterfly) with all the contestants and says that he did rehearse it with them earlier. When asked if he felt any pressure, he said: \"No, after all it is my song, but their standards are getting better with every year.\" Earlier after watching the match Real Madrid played against the Hong Kong team, he appeared at Stephen Fung's birthday party, he says that he couldn't sleep that evening, so he watched Jet Li's \"Tai Chi Zhang San Feng\" and then started doing Tai Chi and mentioning that he likes the Tai Chi symbol a lot. He said: \"It is because it is black and white, clearly different, but the white entails the black and the black leads to the white, so from darkness comes light.\" However, when it was mentioned about his date with Cecilia Cheung to go and see the football match, he immediately picked up his buddhist beads and started chanting. Nic's girlfriend Faye Wong's birthday was the 8th August, but he has been in Hong Kong for the last few days and not spent the time with his Faye in Shanghai for her birthday, however he refused to comment on these questions. When asked further whether Faye would be angry with him spending all this time with Anita Mui, he explained: \"I have had work, appearing at the comics expo and preparing for my concert then opening a showroom on Monday.\"\n\n8 August\n\nKelly was back from Taiwan to attend the release of the \"Pet Fish\" commemorative stamp held yesterday. She was again questioned by the HK media on the . Kelly replied that her brother has already made an apology to his girlfriend and this incident will serve as a lesson to him. Kelly also laughed that she has made pleas to him not to go to the racecourse area as the place is packed with the paparazzi. On the last occasion, Victor had a meal with his father in the area and were pictured and this time, something worse happened. Young couples having a tiff is common but showing that in public is unsightly.\n\nKelly further supported that Victor's girlfriend is a good girl but both Victor and her are too young to handle relationship problems well. Kelly also gave her experience that when she and Alex had a quarrel, they would not talk to each other for 3 days. However, being together for 10 years, such tiffs are less common now. Kelly had once threw a photo frame with her boyfriend's picture and ended up having to clear the glass pieces herself. Kelly felt that there was no reason for her to reprimand Victor any further as he was already remorseful for his actions. As his elder sister, she can only help him to handle the press.\n\n9 August\n\nDue to the earlier SARS outbreak, Kelly's Mandarin album had to be delayed for 4 months and was finally released recently. To specially thank her fans, Kelly had made greater effort in the recording process and for one of the songs \"Gentle Tears\", she had spent 5 days to complete which is a record for her.\n\nFor the music video of \"All I Want Is Love\", she had invited Korean star, Park Yong Ha, to starr in it and had also recorded the song in 5 different languages. Working with Park, Kelly has found that he is a humorous person. In return, Kelly has obliged to appear in the music video for Park Yong Ha's new song.\n\nKelly had also recently been to Taiwan for the promotion of the album and many of her wears for the events were sponsored. From reliable sources, besides her daily wears, Kelly has even got sponsorship for her car and petrol. No wonder she has earned the title of the \"Thrifty Pop Queen\".\n\n7 August\n\nJackie Chan's THE MEDALLION held a premiere in Hong Kong. Yumiko Cheng Hei Yi ( in red) wished Jackie Chan well. Emperor boss Albert Yeung Sau Sing led its stable of stars to the event. Nicholas Tse, Edison Chen and Joey Yung guest stars in this movie.\n\nCommercial Radio and Beacon College organized First Annual All Hong Kong Form Five OK singing contest took place two nights ago. Nicholas Tse Ting Fung, Yumiko Cheng Hei Yi, Boy'z and Ng Ho Hong tried to light the mood of student testers on the even of the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination result announcements.\n\nKelly's brother, Victor, was pictured shoving and pushing his ex-girlfriend on the streets the previous night. This was very different from his usual gentlemanly and polite self that was seen by people. The tabloids had later given him the title of 'Stubborn Boyfriend'.\n\nKelly, who was in Taiwan promoting her album, immediately phoned him to understand the situation. Kelly mentioned that Victor sounded lowly and had admitted that he was on the wrong. He had later apologised to both his sister and ex-girlfriend. Kelly added that his brother is well-behaved and should not have done such a foolish thing.

All along, the singer's contract with TVB had specified that the singer was not allowed to appear on other programmes other than that by TVB. As there were loopholes in the contract, there were chances that singers had unexpectedly received interviews from other stations. The problem gets acute and TVB has decided to make a stop to this.\n\nKelly was supportive of this and when she found that one of the reporters who tried to conduct an interview with her was from Asia Television, she politely declined. Kelly had later expressed that sometimes it was very confusing as there was little time for her to look carefully at every tag attached to the microphone before an interview. Has she received any interviews from Cable Television? She could not remember because every reporter had always requested for a short interview. Kelly suggested that TVB should give singers more chances for TV appearances by increasing music programmes for playing new songs.\n\nDuring yesterday's PCCW roadshow, the company had donated $150 000 to Kelly's Children Education Fund. Kelly laughed that even if she was not paid for the event she would attend it as long as the sponsor was willing to make donations to the fund.

Her reply was that she will only give birth at the age of 40 and she does not feel that age is too old. As to whether her boyfriend agrees with her, Kelly said that this was her own thinking and has yet to discuss this with him. She would want to enjoy being in their own world after marriage and have children at a later time. What happens if she accidentally gets pregnant? Kelly claimed that she is always certain in her way of doing things and such things will definitely not happen.\n\nEven though Kelly has a liking of children, she fears the pain while delivering the baby. From her friends, she got to know that the process was painful. She even joked that she would rather get the doctor to cut open her stomach and extract the baby rather than to deliver it. Her ideal number of children to have is two; a male and a female. However, she may drop her idea if the process is too terrible.\n\nKelly described that her boyfriend, Alex, is a traditional man and greatly wishes to be a father. Her only reply to him is that she is very busy and would not be able to help him. She added that Alex appears concerned about this but has yet to force her to get married. Alex's mother did asked Kelly on marriage matters but she would always smile and not reply to change the topic.\n\nKelly had earlier done an interview for Metro Radio and she had talked about her views on career and love.

The music video for All I Want Is Love described the female lead longing for true love but unable to get certained love in return. Under the request of the video director, Kelly had to shed tears in three seconds for the opening scene. This was not difficult for Kelly but this brought on amazement by her partner. Park had later asked why she could shed tears so easily and wanted to know if she was troubled by other matters. Kelly explained that the weather was hot and had wanted to finish the work quickly. Park did not have a good time filming the video too. He was required to run under the hot weather and in order to have a better take, the scene was taken more than 10 times.\n\nEdison Chen and Gillian Chung filmed their cameos as a couple in the new film called \"My dad is 007.\"Edison was meant to play a main character who was the son of Anthony Wong but when he decided not to do it anymore Edison decided to do a cameo instead.\n\nEdison was also rumoured to have been frozen by EEG, so his management company boss had to ask Jackie Chan to talk to EEG Mr.Yeung in order for Edison to be able to release cd's and be in the move \"The Twins Effects.\"Edison's Manager Katherine and music plus manager both denied and said \"would Jackie have the time to take care of these little things?\"\n\n23 July\n\nKelly was in Guangzhou to prepare fries at the MacDonalds restaurant for raising funds.

There were rumors that Chan Siu Po will resign from the position of IFPI Association Chairman after the investigations.

(how about just you two filming an ad alone?) she said it all depends on the product but it would be a no for products with the concept of lovers... on the other hand, Ronald said he would film any ads because he wanted to buy a new apartment.

People used to mistake them for sisters when the duo started out after being spotted in a talent competition.'Yesterday, the photographer looked at me and called me Charlene. I told him he made a mistake.'The next minute, he looked at me quizzically again and went Gillian? Charlene?' Chung recounts with a laugh about a photo shoot.\n\nAt the interview with Life! at Conrad Centennial Hotel on Sunday morning, she is wearing an off-the-shoulder red top, looking more mature than Choi in a casual blue tank top.\n\nPopularly known as Ah Gill, the 22-year-old Chung has sharper facial features and a higher-pitched voice compared to 20-year-old Choi, or Ah Sa, who has bigger eyes and sounds more ditzy.\n\nThe latter is effortlessly chirpy and even entertaining, like when she cans the idea of the two of them going shopping together, for fear of proceedings running wild and out of control, like 'a zoo'.In comparison, Chung appears less comfortable in the spotlight.But both go blank when asked how they resemble each other. Their minder cuts in expertly, saying that both work really hard, prompting a burst of girlish laughter. However, the girls have no problems describing how they are different.\n\nChung says of her partner: 'She's very funny and always makes people laugh. She's also sociable and likes to organise group activities.'\n\nChoi's view is that Chung 'is the type who needs time to warm up to people. People always mistake it for arrogance'.\n\nChung lets on that the Hong Kong press are upset with her refusal to smile for their cameras.\n\nThe prettier Twin, who reportedly counts Jackie Chan among her admirers, says with a sense of resignation: 'Whether I smile or not, they will still write bad things about me.'But Choi's smiles and chatty ways have drawn flak too. The sunshine girl has been said to be trying to draw more attention by being more talkative than Chung.The latter is quick to defend her friend though: 'It's to do with our characters. It's not her fault, but is my problem. I tend to speak less so, in comparison, she's just got a lot more to say.'\n\nThey are obviously comfortable with each other. Throughout the interview, they often finish each other's sentences.\n\nThey deny recent reports that the Twins are disbanding.\n\nChung attributes the speculation to their preference for different roles. She likes action pictures, Choi goes for romantic comedies.\n\n'The more they write about how we are not getting along and thinking of splitting, the closer we become,' Choi says defiantly.
