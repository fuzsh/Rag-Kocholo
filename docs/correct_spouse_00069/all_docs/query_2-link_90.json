        "text": "From Dating to Divorced\n\nIn Hong Kong, many tabloids are shocked with the recent split between Charlene Choi and singer Ronald Cheng. Even more shocking, the press revealed that Choi and Cheng were actually married in Los Angeles, United States in 2006. They are now in the process of a divorce.\n\nThe two angels of the girl group Twins, Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung, have both fallen. Gillian shocked us with her 2008 photo scandal, and now Charlene with her divorce. This leads one to question whether future product endorsements will come easy to these girls. Getting married and doing dirty deeds with another pop star while upholding a pretense of innocence has rocked the faith of their fans."
