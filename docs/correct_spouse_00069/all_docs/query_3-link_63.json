        "text": "Many years ago, there were rumors that Chris had a secret crush on Vivian, but her mind was not on Chris. Two days ago, Vivian and Joe attended a movie premiere together. Joe said, \"Chris came back. Of course I have to keep a closer watch.\" Yesterday, Chris stated that Joe was being humorous when he was saying his joke and that people shouldn't be too sensitive about what Joe said. Chris never had dinner alone with Vivian and he said, \"The two of them are just like the leading characters of 'The Return of the Condor Heroes,' who were so easy-going. They are a very matching couple.\"\n\nChris stated that he talked with Vivian and Joe on the phone. Chris said, \"Miss Chow was laughing, while Joe said it was a long time since he's come out to tell a joke. I meet with Vivian sometimes, but it's not what you think. We've been to sing karaoke, walk around on the street, and eat dinner, but each time it's with a group of friends. Sometimes we would go to eat dinner with her family or with my family. We're very good friends.\"\n\nChris admitted it was Vivian who introduced him to Joe. Chris and Joe haven't eaten dinner together and aren't that familiar with each other, but when Chris returned to HK to make a comeback in his singing career, Joe analyzed Chris's situation and had given Chris some suggestions. Chris said, \"We have things to talk about. He is a good instructor and friend.\" Chris and Vivian had sort of left the entertainment circle and wouldn't take such news seriously, so when they see each other, it wouldn't be awkward. Are Vivian and Joe getting married soon? Chris said, \"They've always had a good relationship and it goes without saying, like Vivian's song 'In Unspeakable Terms,' so everyone doesn't need to guess on what's going to happen. It won't affect them.\"\n\nVivian and her boyfriend Joe went together to see a movie premiere last night. It was rare to see the two of them be so noticeable. Joe revealed to reporters that it was because Chris had returned, so that's why he has to keep a slightly closer watch. These words were confusing people. Could it be that Chris wants to be the third party and wants to start pursuing Vivian?\n\nYesterday, Chris came back to Hong Kong from Shing Do, China after doing a show there. Chris tried to explain what Joe had said. Chris first laughed and then said, \"I have to thank Mr. Ngai (Joe). I believe Mr. Ngai didn't mean he was watching Vivian, but watching me instead, because he knows I haven't been to HK for a long time and that there are many matters that I don't know how to handle. Actually, he has been looking after me for a while, such as earlier when I came back to HK and wanted to buy a computer. I asked Miss Chow for help, but in the end, it was Mr. Ngai who helped to buy the computer for me.\"\n\nIt's been said that Joe watches over Vivian very closely and that it wouldn't be easy for Chris to step in between them. Chris seriously said, \"I never thought of entering (to fight about getting Vivian), so I didn't take advantage of this.\" The DJ asked Chris, \"Did you ever go to dinner with Vivian?\" Chris said, \"Of course I did. I went to eat with her and her family and her pets.\" Then the DJ asked, \"Was Joe also there?\" Chris didn't answer this question specifically. He just said it was a private gathering and wouldn't talk more about it.\n\nVivian and Joe were on a date last night at the movie premiere of \"Dragon Loaded 2003.\" The lovers have been in love for 13 years. Last night was the first time they were noticeable on a date to a public event. When both of them arrived at the event, there was immediate confusion. They were surrounded by the reporters, and the spectators who admired this first generation jade girl master came to take a look at her, making the premiere become chaotic.\n\nLast night, 35 year-old Vivian wore a hand-knitted green vest and jeans, while Joe wore a blue T-shirt. Both of them were casually dressed but became the focus of everyone at the event. Vivian has retired from showbiz for almost 7 years, but her fame keeps on growing. She still has the body shape of a young girl. She wore light makeup. She's still able to maintain her best 'jade girl' state. She and Joe didn't hold hands, but both of them were close to each other during the whole event. Joe was protective of his girlfriend by clearing the road for her when they were breaking through the reporters who had surrounded them before they went into the theatre.\n\nKeeping a close watch on his girlfriend to guard against Chris\n\nIt was a short distance from the entrance of the exhibition hall to the entrance of the theatre, but Joe and Vivian couldn't get into the theatre for several minutes because the reporters and spectators had surrounded them. Then Joe stopped walking and agreed to let everyone take their picture. The reporters asked him why he was on a date with his girlfriend to see the movie premiere. He was humorous in saying, \"Wa! Chris came back. Of course I have to keep a closer watch!\" Back then when Vivian and Chris were the DJs at RTHK, they were working together and rumors started spreading. Chris had a secret crush on Vivian. It looks like this thorn is still in Joe's heart. Reporters also asked Joe and Vivian if they were getting married soon. Joe laughed saying, \"I'm just here to watch a movie! That's all!\"\n\nAs for Vivian, she stated that she was at the premiere to show support for Vincent Kuk. When she was asked if she was getting married soon, she said in a surprised manner, \"ha ha.\" After saying one word, she followed Joe into the theatre to watch the movie.\n\n13 year relationship has a road filled with many obstacles\n\nVivian and Joe started dating each other since 1991. For the past 13 years, they have experienced many obstacles in their relationship. Luckily 13 years later, they still standby each other, and their love is as solid as gold.\n\n1991: Joe meets with Vivian. There were rumors that Canti Lau Sek Ming was trying to pursue Vivian. Joe gave Canti a nickname of 'Cancer Ming' in his \"Yes\" magazine.\n\n1994: Joe and Vivian separate. Joe and Monica Chan Fat Yung's relationship is revealed. Vivian admits she has a Japanese boyfriend.\n\n1996: Vivian and Joe get back together. They were discovered on a date while in San Francisco. In the end, Joe admits he separated from Monica.\n\n1997: Vivian holds her farewell concert at Atlantic City and then retires from the entertainment circle. There were rumors the two of them secretly got married.\n\n1998: Joe wrote the prologue for the new book by the 'ball princess' Ruby Yiu Lok Bik. People on the outside thought the relationship of the two was ambiguous, and then there were rumors Vivian and Joe had separated.\n\n1999: Joe would sometimes return to HK to play badminton with Vivian and proved their love for each other hasn't changed.\n\n2000: Ruby Yiu revealed that back many years ago, Joe took the initiative to chase after Ruby. Ruby also said Joe would say his relationship with Vivian is only a brother-sister relationship. Ruby said Vivian was just using Joe to get famous. But in the end, Joe and Ruby separated because of communication problems.\n\n2002: Vivian and Joe were accidentally spotted by the reporters during Chinese New Year. Joe said he could give out lucky money, but he didn't give it out yet. Vivian denied they got married overseas.\n\n2003: The two of them have a stable relationship. They were spotted together in crowded public places and looked very happy. Last night, they made a rare public appearance together on a date, but when they were asked if they were getting married soon, they didn't answer the question.\n\nVivian and Joe caused a big commotion when they arrived as a couple to the movie premiere. In the past, both of them would purposely keep their relationship low-key and would never appear together at a public event. When the dating couple arrived, the reporters quickly surrounded them to take their picture, which made the scene chaotic.\n\nA few people misunderstood and thought it was Miriam Yeung\n\nAt that time, someone thought it was Miriam Yeung who had arrived, but then they discovered it was Vivian, who hasn't been seen in public for a long time. She and Joe were both quite generous and open, standing still to let the reporters take their picture. Joe has always been low-key, but he took the initiative and told his girlfriend, \"How about we stand over there to let them take the pictures?\" Although Vivian had already retired from showbiz, she was still very beautiful. Vivian was asked whether or not she came to the movie premiere because she was a PolyGram singer in the past. She smiled and said, \"No, I'm here to show support for the director, Vincent Kuk.\" The reporter asked her if she was getting married soon. She was very surprised by this question and said, \"ha ha.\" The reporter then asked if she could stop to have an interview. Vivian said she didn't want to affect everyone else and that she was late to go into the movie, so it wasn't convenient for her. After she finished speaking, she immediately walked quickly into the theatre.\n\nAs for Joe, he was also the focus of the reporters. The reporter asked why Joe was being so noticeable this time by arriving together with his girlfriend. Joe laughed and said, \"Chris is back, so of course I have to keep a closer watch!\" The reporter then asked him if he was getting married soon. Joe said he was just there to watch a movie. The reason he was at the premiere was because he had heard the movie was very funny. Afterwards, Joe saw his girlfriend had already entered the theatre, so he immediately went into the theatre to look for her.\n\nJoe and Vivian attended a movie premiere together last night. When Joe was asked what the reason was for him and Vivian making a public appearance, he just laughed and said it was because Chris Wong had retured to Hong Kong. Chris had once had a secret crush on Vivian. Could it be that Joe was afraid Chris would take Vivian away from him and so he has to be a boyfriend who follows her around and watch after her?\n\nLast night, Vivian and Joe arrived late to the premiere. When they appeared, lots of reporters immediately swarmed around them to take their pictures. It was very chaotic, and Joe was trying to protect Vivian. He quickly said to the reporters, \"Please don't be like this. We'll step over there so you can take all the pictures you want.\" It was very rare to see Joe and Vivian together in public. What was the reason for them to make such a rare public appearance at this premiere? Joe laughed saying, \"Because Chris came back. Of course I have to keep a closer watch!\" The reporters asked if they were close to getting married. Joe said, \"I'm just here to watch a movie! Please don't say that. Actually, I heard this movie was good to watch, so that's why I'm here to watch it!\"\n\nThe reporters asked Vivian if she was at the premiere to show support for Jacky Cheung. She said, \"I'm here to show support for 'fat Kuk' (Vincent Kuk Tak Chiu)!\" The reporter then said, \"You've made your relationship public by being on a date to watch this premiere. Do you want to announce that you're getting married?\" Vivian said, \"ha ha..\" When Vivian was talking about marriage, she couldn't stop smiling. It seems her and Joe's love relationship is quite sweet and happy!\n\nJoe became nervous when he didn't see his girlfriend\n\nBecause Vivian was surrounded by all the reporters, she couldn't move anywhere. Before entering the theatre, both of them became separated as the reporters interviewed each of them. When Joe found out his girlfriend wasn't beside him, he became nervous and started looking around everywhere. After he found Vivian, he quickly went to Vivian's side and protected her as they entered the theatre.\n\nVivian and Joe have been in love for more than 10 years. Their relationship has always been dealth with in a low-key manner and would seldom ever been seen together at public events. But last night, the two of them made a rare public appearance and were on a date to watch a movie premiere. They let the reporters take as many pictures as they wanted. The reason for their sudden change in attitude was because of Chris Wong, who once had rumors with Vivian many years ago.\n\nLast night at the \"Dragon Loaded 2003\" movie premiere, Vivian and Joe arrived late to the event. When the two of them showed up, they became the focus of everyone. They were very generous in letting the reporters take lots of pictures and didn't try to avoid the reporters.\n\nFor the past few years, Vivian retired from showbiz to be the woman behind Joe. In her spare time, she would do water color paintings. Her lifestyle is very peaceful. She didn't have any plans to return to showbiz. Last night, the couple became very noticeable by going on a date to watch a movie premiere. Vivian is living a relaxed life, and she's still able to maintain the jade girl bodyshape. Vivian's movements seemed quite relaxed, as she had a smile on her face most of the time. Not only did the reporters try to fight to get Vivian's picture, she also attracted many people in the crowd who were looking at her.\n\nThe event became somewhat chaotic because the media was trying to fight to get the rare photo of this couple together. Joe and Vivian couldn't walk anywhere, and then Joe quickly suggested that he and his girlfriend step out so that the reporters could take pictures. He really knew what to do.\n\nSeparated during the chaos\n\nDuring the chaos when both of them were doing short interviews, Vivian said she especially came to the premiere to show support to the director Vincent Kuk. Reporters asked if they were getting married soon since they were being so noticeable. Vivian just laughed \"ha ha\" as her response. As for Joe, he said, \"Chris came back! Of course I have to keep a closer watch!\" Reporters then asked him if they were getting married soon. Joe said, \"I'm just here to watch a movie! I'm watching the premiere because I heard this movie is very funny.\"\n\nBecause there were many people at the event, with the chaos of the reporters and spectators, Vivian and Joe got separated. Joe was even forced outside of the crowd, while his girlfriend was by herself talking to the media. Joe quickly ran into the middle of the crowd to look for his girlfriend, and then they both went into the theatre.\n\nAfter Vivian retired from showbiz, she rarely appeared at public events. Last night, for the very first time, Vivian and her boyfriend Joe made a rare public appearance together at a movie premiere. This caused the crowd of people to get out of control and stole most of the spotlight from the first-time leading actor, Ronald Cheng Chung Gei. Both of them were kind to the reporters. Were they getting married soon? Joe finally said, \"Chris came back. Of course I have to keep a closer watch!\"\n\nVivian and Joe have been in love for 13 years. This is the first time they have been seen together at a public event. The new movie \"Dragon Loaded 2003\" had its premiere at the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre last night. Even though the film company wanted to get some attention by especially arranging to have 8 Harley-Davidson motorcycles and beatle convertibles to take the actors to the event, this couldn't hold back Vivian and Joe's fame. Vivian hasn't been seen in public for a very long time, but she still looked pretty, and several of the spectators complimented her on her beauty.\n\nSuper agent/manager Paco Wong has always favored Ronald Cheng, and at the premiere, he invited many guests to show their support, such as Jacky Cheung Hok Yau, who has a cameo part in this movie, William So Wing Hong, Edmond Leung Hon Man, Anya Wu, Alex Fong Lik Sun, Emme Wong Yi Man, Shawn Yue Man Lok, Shine, Lam Gin Ngok etc. Just before the movie was about to start, Vivian and Joe arrived, which caused some chaos among the crowd. There was one point when someone screamed Miriam Yeung Chin Wa (Ronald Cheng's rumored girlfriend) had arrived, and it was quite funny. When Joe saw how out of control everyone was, he generously said, \"How about we (him and Vivian) step over there to let you (pointing to the reporters) take our picture?!\"\n\nThe reporters asked Vivian if she was at the premiere because she used to be part of PolyGram Records and was there to show support to Paco Wong. She smiled and said, \"No, I'm here to show support for Vincent Kuk.\" The reporters asked her when she would be getting married. Vivian was a little surprised by this question, and just opened her mouth saying, \"ha ha!\" The reporter asked if she could stop to have an interview. She said, \"I don't want to affect everyone else, sorry, it's time to go into the theatre!\"\n\nOn the other side, Joe was asked about the two of them making a rare public appearance together. He said, \"Ha ha! Chris came back. Of course I have to keep a closer watch!\" The reporter asked him if they were getting married soon. Joe said, \"I'm just here to watch a movie, that's all I have to say!\" The reporter asked who was Joe showing support for at the premiere. Joe said, \"I heard the movie was very funny.\" Then Joe realized he lost his girlfriend. After he found her, they rushed into the theatre.\n\nLast night, the new movie \"Dragon Loaded 2003\" had its premiere at the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre. The film company arranged to have some beatle cars and also some Harley-Davidson motorcycles arrive at the event. Cheung Tat Ming and Sam Lee Chan Sam arrived to the event in a beatle car, while the leading actor and actress of the movie, Ronald Cheng Chung Gei and Stephy Tang Lai Yan, arrived in their assistant's car.\n\nMany stars arrived at the movie premiere. Besides the stars of the movie, everyone was focused on Vivian and Joe the most, as they were on a date to watch the movie. The couple had arrived late, and when they appeared, someone screamed Miriam Yeung's name, but when the people discovered it was Vivian and Joe who were on a date attending the premiere, everyone started to get out of control and the reporters immediately went up to Vivian and Joe to take their pictures. Joe was very cooperative, pulling Vivian to stop walking so the reporters could take their pictures and fulfilled everyone's requests before they entered the theatre.\n\nThe reporter came up to Vivian and asked if she had come to the premiere to show support for Jacky Cheung Hok Yan. Vivian politely said, \"No, I'm here to show support for 'fat Kuk' (director Vincent Kuk Tak Chiu).\" When asked about making their relationship public and if they were getting married soon and when they would be getting married, Vivian immediately laughed, \"ha ha!\" and then quickly walked towards the theatre with a smile on her face. The reporter wanted to ask her a few more questions, but she said, \"Sorry, I'm late for the movie. I don't want to affect others.\"\n\nAt the same time, the reporter laughed asking Joe about why he and his girlfriend made a public appearance since it's so rare to see them together in public. Joe jokingly said, \"Chris came back, so of course I have to keep somewhat of a closer watch! Chris and Vivian once had rumors about them. It seems like those rumors might be real.\n\nThe reporter then asked Joe if they were getting married soon. Joe said, \"I'm just here to watch a movie, that's all!\" Then he realized he got separated from his girlfriend and quickly went to look for her to enter the theatre together.\n\nLast night Vivian Chow and Joe Ngai went on a date to a movie premiere. Both of them were friendly to the reporters. When asked about their wedding plans, Vivian immediately laughed, while Joe said it was because Chris Wong recently came back to Hong Kong and also Vivian and Chris are very good friends, so Joe has to keep a closer watch.\n\nThe premiere of the new movie \"Dragon Loaded 2003\" took place last night at the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai. Many celebrities appeared at the event to show their support, such as Vivian and her boyfriend Joe, Miki from the girl group Cookies, Chui Tin Yan from the boy group Shine, Ngon Nga and William So Wing Hong, as well as Yip Suen and Vincent Kuk Tak Chiu.\n\nLaughing when talking about wedding plans\n\nVivian and Joe have been dating for many years. Vivian even gave up her career for this relationship. It was very rare to see them on a date and going to a public event together. They were kind enough to stand still to let the reporters take their picture. When Vivian was asked about her wedding plans, she immediately laughed loudly. Because there were so many people at the location, Vivian and Joe became separated from each other.\n\nWhen reporters asked Joe about him being very noticeable in attending the premiere together with his girlfriend, Joe jokingly said, \"Chris Wong came back. Of course I have to keep a closer watch.\" Reporters then asked if they were getting married soon. Joe said, \"I'm only here to watch a movie, that's all!\"\n\nVivian's prologue:\n\nLeo's World\n\nLeo knows how to have fun.\n\nOne day we met with friends to play American pool. We started at 11:00 AM and played until 8 in the evening when we had to eat. It was only Leo and I who couldn't stop playing. At that moment, I was feeling a little disappointed (because they had to stop playing), but then Leo made an announcement. He said since we're so happy today, after eating dinner, we would return to fight again. With my loud affirmation, everyone had no choice but to stay, and in the end, we played until the pool hall closed its doors and then we left. Our friends were tired of playing, and it was only Leo and I who were still awake and excited. On that night, of course I was the big winner.\n\nLeo is just like a big boy. He's hard-working and seizes every opportunity that's given to him. But when he has free time, he just plays and has fun without worrying about anything. His work and stress have never harmed his innocence. He always has his own world and uses a child's heart (acts like a child), his imagination, and his talent to create his own world. Because of this world, Leo is never tired. His eyes are always filled with desire, energy, and a child's mind.\n\nThis comic book is Leo's creation of his own world. If there's one day when you're feeling a little tired, then you should try entering Leo's imaginary world, take a rest, and laugh. Together with Leo, let go of your child's side (play like a child), imagination, and talent. Very quickly, you and Leo will have the eyes of a child, and you will naturally see the most beautiful part of this world.\n\nVivian Chow\n\n2003\n\nLeo Ku Kui Kei is the creator and artist of his own comic book \"Kubi,\" which is on sale today. Leo has lots of friends and was able to invite 4 female singers from the entertainment circle to help him write the prologue for the comic book. This includes the jade girl singer Vivian Chow, who has retired and been in hiding for many years, and also today's popular 'young heavenly queen' Charlene Choi Cheuk Yin, as well as the 'heavenly queen' (singing queen) Sammi Cheng Sau Man, and the jade girl successor Gigi Leung Wing Kei.\n\nIt's very fitting that Leo found Vivian to write part of his prologue, because Vivian liked to draw since she was a child and has talent in drawing. Last year she even put some of her paintings on display at a painting exhibition. So when Leo asked her to write his prologue, she agreed to it right away. In her prologue, she praised Leo on being an active person and a person who knows how to have fun. She even revealed a time when she and Leo and some friends went to play American pool; they started to play at 11 in the morning and played all the way until 8 in the evening when they had to stop playing to eat dinner. In Vivian's prologue, she wrote, \"At that moment, Leo and I couldn't stop playing, and I was feeling a little disappointed (because they had to stop playing), but then Leo made an announcement that after eating dinner, they would return to fight again (play pool)... .... our friends were tired of playing, and it was only Leo and I who were still awake... ...\""
