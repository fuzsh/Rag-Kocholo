        "text": "Rave\n\nAguilera goes ROBO-POP\n\nThere are shades of Lady Gaga in her new album but the vocals are pure Christina\n\nBy Seto Nu Wen\n\nApril 08, 2010\n\nWHEN it comes to Christina Aguilera, it’s kind of hard to tell what’s going to happen next.\n\nShe started innocently enough with a bubblegummy pop image on her self-titled debut album in 1998.\n\nThen she suddenly jumped to the other end of the spectrum and morphed into a trash-talking leather chaps-wearing harlot on 2002’s Stripped.\n\nAnd when you thought that must be it, she went retro and paid homage to ’30s-style jazz in her last album, Back To Basic (2006).\n\nBut this 29-year-old former Disney Mouseketeer’s not done expressing her various alter egos.\n\nSo say hello to the latest incarnation of Aguilera – a futuristic half-woman, half-robot bionic being.\n\nHer new album, Bionic, will be out only in June.\n\nBut the first single off the album, Not Myself Tonight, has been available on her official website – http://www.christinaaguilera.com – since Monday.\n\nThe rest of the album promises collaborations with Sia, Tricky Stewart, Polow Da Don, Le Tigre, Hill & Switch and Ladytron – artistes who traverse the whole electro-pop spectrum.\n\nOf course, like any Aguilera album, there will be soaring ballads. There’s at least one, Lift Me Up, penned by ex-4 Non Blondes’ Linda Perry, who also wrote Aguilera’s Grammy-winning hit Beautiful.\n\nOf the album, Aguilera says in her label’s press release: ‘I was able to explore and create a fresh, sexy feel using both electronic and organic elements with subject matter ranging from playful to introspective. I am so excited for my fans to hear the new sound.\n\n‘It is something I don’t think anyone will expect.’\n\nNot really.\n\nNot Myself Tonight is everything a well-produced modern pop track should be – hard-pounding tribal beats and a deliciously captivating techno hook.\n\n‘Do you want to get crazy?’ she coos at the beginning before launching into a full-on dance-floor number.\n\nBut beyond that, the melody is not immediately accessible and the beats aren’t entirely original. There are shades of fellow ex-Mouseketeer Justin Timberlake’s 2006 hit SexyBack here.\n\nIf anything, Aguilera seems to be riding on the dance wave made hip by Lady Gaga.\n\nFurthermore, the futuristic, bionic look is a total rip-off of Gaga’s Poker Face video.\n\nIt’s not the first time Aguilera has butted heads creatively with the Bad Romance singer.\n\nIn 2008, when Lady Gaga first burst onto the scene, critics pointed out that Aguilera’s hair, styling and make-up closely mirrored hers, a claim which Aguilera was quick to deny.\n\nPerhaps Aguilera is simply running out of ideas.\n\nBut say what you want about her originality, the girl is blessed with something few of her peers have: A solid set of pipes with a four-octave vocal range.\n\nAnd once you hit the middle of the track, she reminds you why she’ll still be around when all the Keshas, Rihannas and, yes, Gagas have hung up their mics.\n\nAs expected, Not Myself Tonight is raking in rave reviews.\n\nMTV calls it ‘the kind of track you’d expect to hear rattling the speakers at the massive, multi-level clubs of Europe’.\n\nAnd Access Hollywood says the song is ‘her sexiest record we’ve heard since 2002’s Dirrty’.\n\nNow we’re waiting with bated breath for the music video.\n\nThe NewPaper\n\nTaiwanese heart-throb Ethan Ruan on hotel ‘scandal’ with ‘mystery’ woman:\n\nNO romantic Ruan-dezvous\n\nBy Charlene Chua\n\nApril 08, 2010\n\nTHERE’S something different about Ethan Ruan.\n\nPerhaps it has to do with the new band he’s sporting on his ring finger.\n\nDid the 28-year-old Taiwanese heart-throb get secretly married to his long-term girlfriend Tiffany Hsu?\n\nAfter all it seems to be the fashion these days, considering that Hong Kong stars Andy Lau, Charlene Choi and Ronald Cheng have all done it.\n\nA recent scandal involving Ruan would also be good reason for him to hurry down the aisle.\n\nIn February, he was spotted checking into the Windsor Hotel Taichung in Taipei with a woman. And it was not Hsu, his 26-year-old Eurasian model-actress girlfriend of three years.\n\nBut Ruan wouldn’t give us a clear answer when we asked him. He told The New Paper: ‘I bought this ring myself. I wore it today because it matches my outfit. I wouldn’t say it has any special significance.’\n\nStill, the actor said he wouldn’t rule out getting married on the sly.\n\n‘It’s a private matter between two people. As long as both are happy,’ he said.\n\nRuan was in town on Monday with co-star Mark Chao and director Doze Niu to promote their latest movie, Monga.\n\nRuan, Chao and Niu play gangsters in the film set in the 1980s.\n\nRuan is no stranger to controversy.\n\nTwo years ago, a former girlfriend had told the Taiwanese media that he had a high sex drive.\n\nWhen asked about it two years ago, Ruan had told The New Paper that he was so riled by this, he had wanted to sue her.\n\nAs for the hotel incident, the Taiwanese media reported that the pair did not leave till the following afternoon.\n\nRuan paid the hotel bill with his credit card.\n\nThe actor told the Taiwanese media that the woman was his friend’s girlfriend and his friend had asked him to take her to the hotel.\n\n‘It’s best to leave love to fate’\n\nHe said: ‘I was with a group of friends at a lounge run by a friend. We enjoyed ourselves till five in the morning.\n\n‘Because it was late, my friend could not see his girlfriend home. I also did not have my house key and did not want to wake my mother therefore I decided to stay at a hotel.’\n\nRuan said that he did not sleep on the same bed as the woman. He added that his friend arrived at the hotel some time later and stayed the night.\n\nHe also claimed that he wouldn’t be ‘stupid enough’ to pay with his credit card if he had done the deed.\n\nWhen Hsu found out about the incident, she stood by her man.\n\nShe told the Taiwanese media that she has complete trust in her man.\n\n‘I believe everything my boyfriend says,’ she said.\n\nWhen asked if Ruan had cried over how the incident and the publicity that followed had unnecessarily stressed her, Hsu said that crying wasn’t important and ‘he should know what he needs to do’.\n\n‘Getting married is the goal, but we currently put our work in first place so we don’t have plans to get married soon,’ she said.\n\nStill, Ruan should keep his girl firmly in his sight.\n\nUS-born Taiwanese singer-actor Van Ness Wu has reportedly taken an interest in Hsu.\n\nWu and Hsu were co-stars in highly rated Taiwanese drama Autumn’s Concerto which aired here in January.\n\nWhen asked if she would date him, Hsu has said that if Wu were to pursue her, she would consider.\n\nSaid Ruan: ‘It’s best to leave love to fate; there’s no need to worry too much. If it’s mine, then it’s mine.’\n\nIn Monga, Ruan plays an ambitious gangster (Monk) who has a subtle bromance with a fellow gang member, Dragon (played by British-Taiwanese actor Rhydian Vaughan).\n\nIn one scene, Monk tells Dragon, ‘everything that I do, I do it for you’.\n\nSaid Ruan: ‘I’m always so happy when people pick up on that. Men who watch the movie don’t see it, but women always do.\n\n‘Am I in love with Dragon? The director told me to come to that conclusion myself. To be honest, I still don’t know.’\n\nRuan revealed that when he was a teenager, he was so attached to an older boy that he was puzzled.\n\n‘I love girls’\n\n‘But I love girls. Now I know the difference. I think men can have close friendships. It’s just that when you are young, you get confused,’ he said.\n\nRuan added that he wouldn’t let newbie actor Chao’s success get to him.\n\nChao won the Best Actor award at the last Golden Melody Awards, beating hot favourite and co-star Vic Chou.\n\nBoth were nominated in the same category for Taiwanese drama series Black & White.\n\nIt’s quite a feat considering that Black & White was Chao’s first project.\n\nChou reportedly fell out with Chao after this.\n\nSaid Ruan: ‘If Mark wins again (instead of me), then let him win.\n\n‘Who says I won’t win in the next 20 years?’\n\nMonga’s so hot, even grown men show up\n\nYOU would expect the fans at an idol event such as the Monga meet-the-fans session to consist of girls screaming for Taiwanese heart-throb Ethan Ruan.\n\nYou would be only half right.\n\nWhile there were Ruan’s fans, 26-year-old newbie co-star Mark Chao drew more thunderous screams from the 500-strong crowd – and many of them were men.\n\nThe promotional event at Junction 8 on Monday was delayed by two hours and started only at 9pm.\n\nFans started streaming in as early as 6pm and it was quite a sight watching grown men perch themselves on railings and benches to get a better view of the actors.\n\nThey also fought as hard as the girls to acquire Monga movie posters by thrashing their hands wildly in the air when the compere on stage asked a question.\n\nSaid Mr David Ong, a 42-year-old car salesman: ‘I like Mark’s acting. I watched him in (Taiwanese drama series) Black & White and find him a very good actor.\n\n‘The funny thing is my girlfriend doesn’t know who he is. I was the one who dragged her here today. So paiseh (embarrassing) right?’\n\nWhen Ruan, Chao and director Doze Niu finally emerged on stage pandemonium erupted.\n\nWhile Ruan kept waving to his fans, Chao was shy.\n\nBoth actors made fun of Niu when the compere asked if they had heard about how strict the director was.\n\nSaid Ruan: ‘I was the only one among the cast to have worked with him before. So I told them that if they didn’t memorise their script properly, they would be punished.\n\n‘For example, they would have to stand at the side of the road and recite their lines till they memorise them.’\n\nThe three guys were asked to dance for the crowd.\n\nNiu and Ruan sportingly gyrated to the loud music. Chao tried his best to join but looked like he wanted the ground to swallow him up. All of them then sat at a table onstage to sign posters for their fans.\n\nRuan allowed himself to be grabbed by overzealous fans and even stood up so that the girls could hug him.\n\nChao, who looked overwhelmed by the horde, later made up for his shyness by announcing into the microphone just before he left: ‘I love everyone.’\n\nThe NewPaper\n\nSINGAPORE : Celebrity couple Jaime Teo and Daniel Ong on Thursday announced the birth of their baby daughter Renee via Twitter.\n\n“Born 1319hrs and weighing 2.96kg! Mommy was awesome!! She is beeeaaauuuutiiiffffuuuulll!” wrote Ong.\n\nAnd the proud father couldn’t stop gushing about his little girl, whose Chinese name is Wang Xing Yu, when he spoke to Channelnewsasia.com.\n\n“She is perfect. She has a lot of hair, she has Jaime’s eyes, my nose, my lips, pink perfect baby.”\n\nThe former radio deejay said Teo started getting contractions at around midnight and they decided to go to the hospital for a quick check.\n\n“And the moment we came in to check, they admitted her and then we started [the delivery] at about 8am. We did the epidural at about 10am or so, and the baby was out by 1pm.”\n\nDescribing the moment as the best experience of his life, Ong, 34, said, “I was just so proud to be a dad, proud of Jaime because she was so strong… It was basically three pushes and she delivered the baby girl.”\n\nThough the pair are first-time parents, they did not panic when Teo, an actress and Miss Singapore Universe 2001, started experiencing contractions.\n\n“We started playing a game of Bejeweled on the iPhone, and just tried to get her mind off things. We just timed it very calmly,” he said with a laugh.\n\nTeo, who turns 33 on April 17, must have breathed a sigh of relief that Renee was not born on her birthday.\n\nThe former beauty queen had mentioned that she foresees that she will be a “non entity” if mother and daughter shared the same birthday.\n\nSo has Ong thought of what to get his wife as a push present?\n\n“I promised her anything so that pretty much widens it up. Jaime doesn’t like diamonds, she doesn’t like material things, so I think I will probably just take her on a trip around the world to be fulfilled for the rest of our lives,” he replied.\n\nAfter 15 years in the radio industry, Ong quit his job as deejay with 987FM in January so that can set aside more time for his family.\n\nBut ironically, the new dad who is currently doing freelance hosting and voiceover work is so “swamped with shows” that he can’t grant himself paternity leave.\n\n“Tonight at 11pm, I have to go and do a rehearsal. Tomorrow I have a show, and the next few days are pretty good. And the week after I’m like booked every single day for shows,” he said.\n\nIn fact, Ong has been so busy that he was afraid that he would miss the birth of his daughter.\n\nHe said, “Jaime already started blaming me for when I am not around for the birth. Luckily I was around.”\n\n– CNA\n\nChannel News Asia\n\nanugeraHitz.sg Awards\n\nThe Taufik Batisah AWARDS\n\nSingapore Idol winner scoops six of 14 awards up for grabs at local music awards\n\nBy Juliana June Rasul\n\nApril 06, 2010\n\nIT WAS a glorious night for local music.\n\nBut particularly so for Taufik Batisah.\n\nAt the inaugural anugeraHitz.sg awards shown over Suria on Saturday night, Singapore’s first Idol bagged six of the 14 trophies given out.\n\nThe awards, conceived last year as a local version of the annual Anugerah Planet Muzik (APM), had more than 20 nominees vying for 14 trophies in 10 categories.\n\nAfter Taufik had already received his trophies for Best Artiste and Best Composer, he was ribbed by a fill-in host during a commercial break.\n\n‘The host making fun of me was embarrassing,’ conceded Taufik at the after-party.\n\n‘When the awards kept coming, I just felt like, ‘Are you serious? I’m that lucky?’\n\nBut he was clearly ecstatic about his awards, at one point gleefully holding up his sixth trophy on stage and saying in Malay: ‘Look mak (mother), another one!’\n\nFor Taufik, 29, the wins are all the sweeter as the voting was by industry professionals.\n\nAt APM, he was named Most Popular Singapore Artiste three years running, and has also taken home Most Popular Singapore Song twice. Both awards were based on viewers’ votes.\n\nTaufik, who has collected eight APM awards in the last four years, said he doesn’t feel the anugeraHitz.sg award means any less though the artistes don’t compete with regional talent.\n\n‘Every award means something different, and it’s a great honour to be recognised by my peers here,’ he said.\n\nBesides taking home the plum Best Album award for his fourth studio album, Suria Hatiku (Light Of My Heart), he also took home two trophies in one category – Most Popular Songs.\n\nHe was recognised for his single Nafasku (The Air That I Breathe), and his duet with Hady Mirza, Kepadanya (To Him).\n\nIt was an embarrassment of riches for Taufik, and a bit of a sore point with some of the other nominees.\n\nRap duo Sleeq who took home one award, Best Duo/Group, out of the three categories they were nominated for, were frank about the awards’ focus on Taufik.\n\nOld-timers and fresh talent\n\n‘What’s new?’ said rapper Alif Abdullah, laughing.\n\n‘He is, after all, the Singapore Idol. He is the most active artist. But maybe other artistes should be given a chance, for healthier competition,’ said his partner, Ahmad Syarifullah.\n\nThe awards show was initially planned for last year, but had to make way for the first-ever APM awards held in Jakarta.\n\nThe two-hour show saw performances from both old-timers and fresh talent – everyone from veteran rocker Hanafie Warren to recently-crowned Singapore Idol Sezairi Sezali graced the stage to perform a mix of old and new local songs.\n\nBut parts of the show felt like a repeat of last year’s APM in Jakarta – the main performers, Taufik, Hady, Didicazli and Nana had also performed then.\n\nThough not present on stage on Saturday, other nominees like Imran Ajmain, The Sallys and Zaibaktian had been given a chance to perform on Hitz.sg, a three-episode special that ran on Suria last month to introduce audiences to their music.\n\nLocal band Revalina, who walked away with the award for Best New Duo/Group, said they felt encouraged by the show’s unique format of giving bands airtime before the awards night.\n\n‘With that, and our award, we really hope more people will start to take notice of us,’ said Revalina member Muhd Rosman.\n\nHady Mirza\n\nAsian Idol winner Hady, who took home Best Song in addition to his joint win with Taufik, said he didn’t feel that being a Singapore Idol had much to do with winning awards.\n\n‘We’re definitely thankful to the franchise for getting our name out there, but the awards are up to the judges,’ he said. ‘I’m thankful, because I know how good the other nominees are.’\n\nAsked how he felt about being constantly pitted against his fellow Idol winner and good friend Taufik, Hady grinned.\n\n‘It’s fun, isn’t it?’ he said. ‘No, it’s not a competition. We’re always very supportive of each other.’\n\nLocal rocker Zaibaktian, who lost Best New Artiste award to Anugerah winner Sarah Aqilah, said that while Taufik’s wins are ‘well-deserved’, he did think more could have been done to shine a light on Singapore’s less-known artistes.\n\n‘Maybe next year they can further separate the categories into genres, so musicians like me who do rock music can have a real chance,’ he said, noting that most of the night’s winners were pop musicians.\n\nTaufik laughed off the notion that his sweep of anugeraHitz.sg meant he was the ‘best’ Idol winner so far.\n\n‘What these awards do is remind me of all the things I had to do to get where I am,’ he said.\n\nVeteran singer Rahimah Rahim, who was presented the honorary Anugerah Primera award for her achievements in the local music scene, felt the awards were a ‘great thing’ for local artistes.\n\n‘We’ve gone so long without them, and I think it’s time everyone got their due,’ she said.\n\nThose who went home empty-handed should not give up, she said.\n\n‘There are so many young faces here today, I know they have the drive and the energy to keep going.’\n\nWinners list\n\nBest New Artiste: Sarah Aqilah\n\nBest New Duo/Group: Revalina\n\nBest Artiste: Taufik Batisah\n\nBest Duo/Group: Sleeq\n\nBest Lyricist: Diorama – Anti-Romantis (Anti-Romantic)\n\nBest Composer: Taufik Batisah – Nafasku (The Air That I Breathe)\n\nBest Song: Hady Mirza – Angkasa (Space)\n\nBest Album: Taufik Batisah – Suria Hatiku (Light Of My Heart)\n\nMost Popular Songs:\n\nNafasku – Taufik Batisah\n\nImpianku (My Dream) – Didicazli featuring Sleeq\n\nKepadanya (To Him) – Taufik Batisah and Hady Mirza\n\nMost Popular Artistes: Taufik Batisah, Hady Mirza, Didicazli\n\nAnugerah Primera: Rahimah Rahim\n\nThe NewPaper\n\nSTARS with designs on FASHION\n\nFashion houses turn stars into designers to revive heyday\n\nBy Germaine Lim\n\nApril 06, 2010\n\nTO FASHION’S rescue, here come the celebrities.\n\nFASH IN THE CITY: Sarah Jessica Parker wears a Halston dress on the set of her upcoming movie Sex And The City 2. PICTURE: GOLDEN VILLAGE\n\nWhen languishing but storied fashion houses need reviving, it seems they no longer look to designers to do the job.\n\nThey turn to stars.\n\nIn January, Sex And The City actress Sarah Jessica Parker, 45, was named president and chief creative officer of Halston Heritage, iconic US fashion label Halston’s new secondary collection, according to Women’s Wear Daily (WWD).\n\nAccording to New York Magazine, Parker also has an equity stake in Halston.\n\nLast September, actress Lindsay Lohan, 24, was roped in as artistic adviser for French fashion house Emanuel Ungaro.\n\nBoth brands have been struggling to regain their 1980s glory.\n\nBut can star power undo the damage?\n\nIn the US, fashion experts are sceptical.\n\nFAILED VENTURE: Actress Lindsay Lohan’s first and only collection for Ungaro failed to impress pundits at last October’s Paris Fashion Week. PICTURE: AFP\n\nMs Bridget Foley, executive editor of W magazine, told New York Post: ‘Halston and Sarah Jessica Parker both, in a way, are American icons. But that doesn’t mean it will work. I’m not sure signing a celebrity can make or break a label.\n\n‘Just because you’re a celebrity and have great clothes and great style, it doesn’t make you a great designer.’\n\nUS celebrity stylist Monica Schweiger, whose clients include Lady Gaga and Gwen Stefani, is also not a fan of stars playing designers.\n\nShe told lifestyle website Luxist: ‘In most cases, the celebrity designer more than likely has no actual design training and may not even have a unique style opinion – other than their stylist’s.’\n\nWhen contacted, local designers were split over the issue.\n\nLocal designer Jo Soh of Hansel reckons having celebrities on board is a ‘smart marketing move’.\n\nShe said: ‘Essentially, celebrities embody the brand’s style. Every brand needs an ambassador. It’s better if someone walks and talks her style.’\n\nBut another local designer, Hayden Ng of Hayden Boutique at SOHO2@Central, believes that not having formal training in design may be a disadvantage for celebrities-turned-designers.\n\nHe said: ‘The makings of fashion and wearing it are two different elements. One may have a good sense of style but may not know the technicalities of design and fabric.\n\n‘They must be able to explain themselves to their tailors and designers for their ideas to materialise.’\n\nPerhaps that is why Lohan’s venture failed.\n\nAt last October’s Paris Fashion Week, Lohan’s first and only collection for Ungaro failed to impress pundits who slammed the mini dresses, heart prints and heart-shaped sequin pasties and blazer combo.\n\nUngaro was famous for combining prints like florals, plaids and stripes on the same garment.\n\nNew York Times critic Eric Wilson wrote of Lohan’s efforts: ‘(Her) arrival at a 45-year-old Paris house known for US$1,500 (S$2,100) dresses and a tradition of couture craftsmanship is entirely different, something akin to a McDonald’s fry cook taking the reins of a three-star Michelin restaurant.’\n\nWhile swanky US retail chain Neiman Marcus and online luxury shopping website Net-A-Porter.com dropped Ungaro after Lohan’s debut, upscale US retail chain Bloomingdale’s picked up the collection.\n\nTwo months after the heavily criticised collection, Ungaro president Mounir Moufarrige quit, though he told WWD that ‘(the resignation) has nothing to do with Lindsay Lohan’.\n\nLohan eventually parted ways with Ungaro early last month.\n\nEven before Parker, celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe tried to breath new life into Halston as its creative consultant in 2007.\n\nPerfect fit?\n\nHer woozy, hippie 1970s style was to have been a perfect fit for the brand, which is known for its disco glamour fashion.\n\nShe was unsuccessful, as were eight owners and sixdesigners before her, and relinquished her position a year later, reported Luxist.\n\nDespite her power stylist status, Zoe could have failed to rejuvenate Halston because she lacks mass appeal, local designer Keith Png of Hide & Seek told The New Paper.\n\nHe said: ‘I think only fashion insiders will know of Rachel the dynamic stylist. The rest of us may not have a clue who she is.\n\n‘But we know Sarah, or at least we know she’s the actress in Sex And The City. People will be interested to check out the collection because she’s a celebrity. Plus she’s known for her style.’\n\nBut whether Parker is able to turn Halston’s fortunes around remains to be seen.\n\nThree years ago, she remarked to New York Post how she had been ‘presented – for no right reason – all these design opportunities’ when ‘I can’t sketch (and) I can’t drape’.\n\nHer first Halston Heritage designs will debut only in the Spring 2011 collection, the Toronto Star reported.\n\nShe has been spotted wearing several Halston outfits on the set of her upcoming movie, Sex And The City 2, which is scheduled to open here on May 27.\n\nTime will tell, Ng said.\n\n‘Even though Halston is a known brand, it takes time to inject new life into a brand. That’s why a brand should never be content.\n\n‘Once it is complacent, it will be difficult to catch up on what has transpired over the last two decades.’\n\nThe NewPaper"
