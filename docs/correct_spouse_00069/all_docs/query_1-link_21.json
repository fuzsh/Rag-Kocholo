He even kept his first marriage to Charlene Choi a secret until they divorced in March 2010.\n\nChoi, Cheng's ex-wife and a Hong Kong singer, sent her greetings to him, saying she believes Cheng would be a good father. Choi is currently dating Hong Kong singer William Chan and says she too would like to have many children, but that the time was not right yet."
