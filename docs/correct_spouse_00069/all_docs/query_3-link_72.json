        "text": "Esther Kwan Teases Bobby Au Yeung About Having Bigger Stomach Than Husband\n\nMonday December 24, 2012 Hong Kong\n\nCredits: to hyn5 @ http://hyn5-hyn5.blogspot.com\n\nYesterday, 'Onscreen Couple' Bobby Au Yeung and Esther Kwan were in Yuen Long filming the new series \"Love Reverses Three Lifetimes of Fate\". Although the two had to work on Christmas Even, they were fortunate enough to celebrate with their family in the evening. Collaborating again after separating for a while, the two were still in tune with each other, teasing each other off camera.\n\nBobby laughed at Esther for reaching a new level in acting, and also revealed that Nick Cheung would often visit the set and is getting more and more muscular: \"Mr. Cheung told me to make his wife happier. Once he knew about having to film overnight, he would silently come and visit the set, even bringing along some abs! His arm is double my size\". Esther laughingly said, \"His stomach is not bigger than yours!\" Regarding her husband's devoted care, she feels warm inside. Although her husband frequently gets injured from filming, Esther said that she would not order him to decrease dangerous performances...would just tell him to take care of himself: \"He is actually careful; however, sometimes the storyline requires it. No one wants accidents to happen!\" Ben Wong, who was also on set, had a horse-riding scene. He expressed that he got injured from falling off the back of a horse before...a haunting traumatic experience.\n\nRaymond Lam & Kate Tsui Loaded with Jobs Despite Losing Awards\n\nMonday December 24, 2012 Hong Kong\n\nSource: Oriental Daily\n\nTranslated by: aZnangel @ http://asianuniverse.net\n\nRaymond Lam and Kate Tsui were the hot favorites for TV King and Queen at the TVB Anniversary Awards 2012, but unfortunately lost to Wayne Lai and Tavia Yeung. Today on Christmas, each are busy with their own jobs. Kate just finished shooting the Lunar New Year film (I Love HK 2013) and will be busy from beginning to end of the coming year. A rare opportunity that she gets a day off, Kate tries to have the best of fun with her family and friends as they gather for a Christmas party. Tomorrow, she'll be going back to work in Beijing and will celebrate a White Christmas there while she's at it. Kate smiled and said its a memorable Christmas. Kate reveals her relatives trained since youth to become a \"Big 2 Master\", so she can\n\nAlthough Kate lost the TV Queen award, she is still loaded with jobs and will have a prosperous year. When asked what Christmas gift she's getting herself as a reward? Kate said: \"I've always wished to live with my family, in fact, what I want most is to buy a bigger house, so we can all live together. I am currently saving up for the down payment.\" Kate didn't get the TV Queen title, but compared to Tavia, she won the audience hearts, asked if she feels that's more important than the award? She said: \"The speech I made on stage is from the bottom of my heart. I feel so warm knowing so many colleagues like me. I've gained a lot.\" Raymond and Kate's relationship is like 'aiya' siblings, does Kate feel its a pity that he didn't get the TV King award? She said: \"Of course I feel disappointed, Ah Fung (Raymond) is a three-habitat artist, he handles all three areas of TV, film and music really well.\"\n\nJackie Chan denies cz12 is his retirement film\n\ncourtesy of mingpao.com\n\nJackie Chan earlier accepted a TVB Entertainment News station program STAR TALK interview. He said that the most difficult part of his film CZ12 (SUP YI SUN CHIU) was convincing his wife Joan Lin (Lam Fung Giu) to guest star. \"My wife has been retired from film for many years. 7 years ago she even turned down as HK$15 million per year shampoo ad campaign contract. She took a long time to be persuaded. I even had to move the entire city set from Beijing to Hong Kong and arrange for all the workers she knew to participate to successfully shoot one scene.\"\n\nJackie Chan earlier revealed that CZ12 was his final action film. He said that everyone misunderstood. \"I have no intention to retire, I only want to add more drama into and reduce action elements from my future movies. Sometimes I would be afraid to jump, worrying that one day I would end up in a wheel chair. So now I use doubles and post production more, I want to be better to myself and the production team.\"\n\nJackie Chan and Joan Lin at first objected to their son Jaycee Chan (Fong Cho Ming) getting into the business. His wife felt that she already lost her husband, she did not want to lose her son as well. Jackie Chan said, \"The pressure on Cho Ming is huge. He has to be different from everyone. Once he wrote a song that had no break. I asked him why and he said that he wanted to create some songs that were hard and not easily remade.\"\n\nSource\n\nVeronica Yip returns to US\n\nTwo days after completing her comeback project, \"I Love Hong Kong 2013\", actress Veronica Yip finally returns to United States.\n\nAs reported on Groove Asia, on 15 December, speaking to the reporters at the airport while waiting for her flight home to US, Veronica said that they are currently working on her mother's funeral.\n\n\"It's being worked on. We will try to accommodate it on a good day. We will have to wait until my other siblings return from overseas,\" the actress said.\n\nVeronica also revealed that she will be going to Hawaii for a vacation with her kids upon returning to the US. When asked if she will stayed firm with her decision to retire from the film industry, Veronica stated, \"Actually I shouldn't have over-reacted, I should've just let it go. I saw Mommy, I came back to act and had a lot of fun. With the other stuff time can prove everything.\"\n\nRegarding the rumour that Eric Tsang Chi-wai has invited her to make a television series, she said, \"It's not an invitation, he had an idea. However 20 to 30 episodes take too long, I think I might not be able to do it because I can't leave the children.\"\n\nSource\n\nRaymond Lam Not Even Top 3 Most Voted for TV King, Quits TVB Series in 2013\n\nRaymond Lam Not Even Top 3 Most Voted for TV King, Quits TVB Series in 2013\n\nFriday December 21, 2012 Hong Kong\n\nSource: Oriental Daily, Good News (by ON.CC), Credit: HKChannel\n\nTranslated by: aZnangel @ http://asianuniverse.net\n\nTVB Anniversary Awards 2012 had a new 'one person per vote' system, allowing the audience to vote for their favorite TV King and Queen. At first, everyone thought Raymond Lam would take the title because he had the most fans, but he ended up with nothing! Kate Tsui was only given the 'pork award' (condolence prize) -- \"My Favorite TV Female Character\" award. [Good News] obtained news from a reliable source of the voting results. On the night of the awards show, TVB announced there was a total of 1,542,922 votes. TV King and Queen each had around 110,000 of the votes. According to the reliable source, Kenneth Ma was actually in second place for TV King, just 30,000 votes behind Wayne Lai; On the TV Queen side, Kate Tsui was in second place with around 30,000 votes behind Tavia Yeung. Raymond Lam did not even make it on the top three.\n\nIt was understood, the two TVB executive giants Virgina Lok and Catherine Tsang were in a battle. Catherine insisted on delaying the awards ceremony until the two anniversary series The Confidant and Silver Spoon Sterling Shackles finishes its broadcast, so her favorite artists Wayne Lai and Tavia Yeung could have extra time to boost their momentum and get in more votes, and plus the finales frequently become the hot topics in the city. Results, Wayne and Tavia successfully won the awards. Virgina Lok saw right through Catherine's plot. This directly affected her favorite artists Raymond Lam and Kate Tsui's votes. No wonder the two are attacking back! Apparently Raymond and Kate are fighting back by refusing to accept any TVB series next year. Next year, Raymond is concentrating more on music, Mainland dramas and movies; Kate will be focused more in movies.\n\nEason Chan and Hilary Tsui's marriage on the rocks?\n\nThe celebrity couple reportedly had a big fight over the drug party scandal that Hilary is involved in\n\nSpeculation has it that Hong Kong singer Eason Chan got into a huge argument with his wife Hilary Tsui over the substance abuse case that she is involved in, sparking talk of a red light in their six-year marriage.\n\nSources revealed that Hilary was absent from her good friend Grace Ip's wedding last month with no apparent reason and left Eason to handle the awkward situation alone.\n\nTwo days later, the actress-turned-style icon posted a photo of actress Suki Chui's husband Kenny Wong, owner of the restaurant where the drug party took place, on her microblog. Her act invited abusive comments from her friends and left Kenny with no choice but to report the matter to the police.\n\nEnraged by Hilary's actions, Eason reportedly rushed home to question his wife who was apparently unremorseful about her behaviour. As Eason was especially concerned that his beloved daughter Constance Chan would be embroiled into the situation, Hilary's loud retorts incited profanities-filled replies from the singer, causing the former actress to storm out of the house in the heat of the moment.\n\nWhen asked on her family matters, as both parents have not been fetching her from school recently, Constance snapped at reporters and said, 'Too bad. Stupid!'\n\nHilary later flew to Japan, without Eason's knowledge, to hide from the attention. Though she looks relaxed in the pictures, it is believed that she is aware of the big trouble she has caused.\n\nEason is keeping a no comment stance on the incident, following earlier reports that a total of 23 Hong Kong artistes are being suspected of substance abuse during a dinner gathering which happened last October."
