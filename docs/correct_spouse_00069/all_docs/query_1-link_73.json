        "text": "In the good old days, the Hong Kong film industry had Stephen Chow – an adept comedian who could make terrible material better and bring good jokes to the brink of greatness. With his semi-retirement behind the scenes, Chow has left a huge hole to fill: one that seems to have fallen by default to Chapman To. It’s not out of pure talent, one suspects, but rather by sheer hard work: To has popped up in at least seven movies a year since 2011, increasingly in headlining rather than supporting roles. The Midas Touch, truth be told, is intermittently entertaining and better than his last effort (SDU: Sex Duties Unit), but it’s still hardly what anyone can really call ‘good’.\n\nWhile carrying out his duties as a debt collector, Chiu (To) accepts a modelling agency in lieu of payment. He resolves to turn the eight wannabe starlets still signed to the agency into big stars – a feat he finds surprisingly difficult to accomplish. He hires the recently disgraced but reportedly highly competent Sun Meimei (Charlene Choi) to manage his roster of talents, but soon finds himself in a tight spot when his money and luck start running out.\n\nIn some alternate universe somewhere, there’s probably a good version of The Midas Touch charming audiences – one that makes better use of everything it has at its disposal. The premise is fun, the cast on hand is willing to go as big and silly as the script requires, and the characters actually defy expectations and manage to endear themselves to audiences in a rather surprising way after a while.\n\nSadly, the incarnation of The Midas Touch available to us is simply not that good. Its scattershot, mo lei tau (nonsensical) approach to comedy yields a genuinely funny moment once in a while, most memorably one that plays out in goofy Looney Tunes fashion in a deserted car park. More often than not, however, the film’s string of jokes fall disappointingly flat. A girl thinking she can bark or burp her way to fame is just barely funny in the first instance, and grows increasingly less amusing the more often it’s repeated.\n\nPerhaps it’s unfair to expect To to salvage a script that not even Chow is likely to be able to resuscitate. The Midas Touch quite determinedly sinks when it should float, squandering rather than capitalising on its more amusing or even touching moments. It’s telling – and damning – when, despite the efforts of everyone concerned, a cameo by a movie star is the most unreservedly entertaining moment in the entire film.\n\nBasically: A Midas Touch that yields fool’s gold – shiny and promising, but ultimately of disappointingly little value.\n\nHong Kong comedy movies have a long, rich tradition of going to completely unexpected places to tease laughs out of audiences. The best of these films do so by trading on a unique, perfectly-judged ‘mo lei tau‘ (‘nonsensical’) brand of humour. The worst of these films get lost amidst a tangle of bad jokes and cheap slapstick. Gary Mak’s SDU: Sex Duties Unit – a sex comedy that’s not even remotely sexy or funny – sits firmly in the latter category.\n\nHot-headed Keung (Chapman To) leads the second-string team of Hong Kong’s elite paramilitary Special Duties Unit (SDU). Inexplicably, he decides to motivate his three team-mates – horny Ka Ho (Matt Chow), reserved Josh (Shawn Yue) and earnest Dried Shrimp (Derek Tsang) – by organising a top-secret mission to get everyone laid in Macau. The course of true lust never runs smooth… and so, while cruising for hookers, the quartet invariably get entangled with the local authorities and criminal elements.\n\nIronically, a concept quite so blatantly bawdy and crass needs a fine, light touch to work. It’s entirely possible to cook up a fun, raucous film that’s centred on the nether regions, which goes straight for the heart even while bypassing the brain. But Mak lacks the necessary finesse and restraint. SDU: Sex Duties Unit is a clumsy affair that’s almost entirely without redeeming value, its characters more like wind-up sex-dolls than recognisable people with real sexual urges.\n\nIt’s a wonder that the cast stayed on set long enough to produce sufficient footage for Mak to splice his film together. The poor, hapless Tsang is literally stuck in a hard place (sorry) for most of the movie’s running time, and the others don’t fare much better. Yet, they play along gamely, though Yue’s stony gaze sometimes seems less like a character trait than a silent comment on the film he seems to have accidentally stumbled into.\n\nCast aside, there are a couple of nice moments in SDU: Sex Duties Unit. Amidst all the wanton, testosterone-charged debauchery, the film actually takes a welcome, unexpectedly liberal attitude towards non-traditional sexual inclinations. There’s also an inventive crime scene re-enactment (explaining Dried Shrimp’s nickname) that provokes probably the only genuine laugh in the entire movie.\n\nThat’s not enough to save SDU: Sex Duties Unit from itself, however. More troubling than titillating, the film barrels along with neither the sensitivity nor the smarts to properly mine real laughs from sexually-charged situations. Even the lowest common denominator – the audience this film is clearly going for – deserves better than this.\n\nBasically: It’s every bit as bad as its poster suggests. Save yourself the pain.\n\nDuring the Chinese New Year period, does anyone walk into a cinema actually expecting to watch a good movie? A fun movie, sure – a silly one, of course. But a good one? Hardly. Hotel Deluxe is no different from most of the mega-star ensemble comedies that roll into cineplexes around this time of year. It’s not particularly good or well-written: everyone checking into this film is more caricature than character, the narrative is a gleeful mess, and its comedy is almost shamefully broad. But, once expectations have been dialled down accordingly, it can’t be denied that there’s some harmless, zany fun to be had here.\n\nThe deluxe accommodation of the title is actually the five-star Hundred Stars Hotel in Hangzhou, which is run by a group of vaguely incompetent staff members who also happen to be pretty good friends – assistant manager OK (Ronald Cheng), head of housekeeping Peach (Sandra Ng) and chief bartender Pacino (Chapman To). Unfortunately, the quiet idyll of their lives is disrupted by the arrival of their new manager Cruella (Teresa Mo), an ice-cold task-mistress who resolves to improve the hotel’s reputation by inviting a movie crew to film on the premises. Hijinks, of course, ensue, especially when a heiress (Fiona Sit) and mysterious inspector turn up at the hotel – one looking for a husband, and the other for any reason to downgrade the hotel’s star rating.\n\nThis is emphatically not a film to be watched with one’s brain fully engaged. The humour is low-brow and cartoony (very much not in the classy Pixar sense), and the situations in which the characters find themselves increasingly ridiculous. The misunderstandings and complications pile up on one another to create a ludicrous farce that too often feels forced and almost wilfully dumb.\n\nBut it really makes very little sense to judge Hotel Deluxe by the standards of a normal movie. A Chinese New Year blockbuster is meant to be cheerful and silly, the perfect absurdist antidote to a day spent playing nice with distant relatives. While Hotel Deluxe isn’t even one of the best examples of its kind (there are scenes that really are just plain awkward, strange and/or terrible), it has its fun moments, and the viewer eventually becomes sufficiently entangled in the characters’ madcap misadventures to care (at least a little) about how it all ends. The film even boasts a couple of excellent comic performances courtesy of veteran actresses Ng and Mo, who form the best unlikely double team on the hotel staff.\n\nMake no mistake: Hotel Deluxe is not a good movie. But that’s what’s so special about Chinese New Year – it’s that time of the year when we’ll readily forgive a movie a great deal if it can make us laugh at the end of a long, hot day spent shuttling between houses and entertaining guests. On this count, Hotel Deluxe scores just about enough to help us forgive its general lack of quality and sophistication.\n\nBasically: We wouldn’t normally recommend that you check in to this particular hotel, but since it’s Chinese New Year and most other places are booked solid – you might find something to enjoy in Hotel Deluxe.\n\nWritten for F*** Magazine"
