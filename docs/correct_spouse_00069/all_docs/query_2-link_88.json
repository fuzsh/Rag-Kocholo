        "text": "Allegedly, Charlene Choi and Ronald Cheng Chung Kei recently broke up after dating for the last 3 years. In 2004, Ronald and Charlene started dating after meeting on the set of movie, 《追击8月15》.\n\nDuring their courtship, Ronald tattooed Charlene's name inside his arm. Despite the love tattoo, their relationship did not last. Charlene could not withstand Ronald's smoking habit and excessive lifestyle. Also the pair were often separated due to work schedules, thus souring their relationship. Allegedly, Charlene decided to break up 2 months ago.\n\nWhen Charlene and Ronald first started dating in 2004, their relationship was not accepted by the public. Although they handled their relationship quietly, it did not withstand the test of time.\n\nAllegedly, Charlene and Ronald's relationship became turbulent at the beginning of 2007. Since Charlene was not a smoker, the pair often argued over Ronald's smoking habits.\n\nA close friend of Charlene's shared the inside scoop: \"Charlene does not like Ronald's nightlife habits. In the last few years, Charlene has been working in mainland China a lot. Ronald often frequents dubious establishments, with the paparazzi taking photos of him with other women and smoking heavily. Ronald's hang-outs often got out of control. Charlene hated this aspect of Ronald the most.\" Charlene's friend continued, \"When Charlene first started dating Ronald, we discussed Ronald's problems with her. At the time, Ronald was able to make Charlene very happy and she was okay with his lifestyle. There was no reason why we shouldn't support her decision to date him. With the passage of time, Ronald would eventually reveal his true colors.\"\n\nThe paparazzi was able to take occasional photos of Charlene and Ronald when they were dating in the past. Starting in 2006, both Charlene and Ronald became busy with their own work projects. There were very few opportunities to spend time together.\n\nCharlene's friend commented, \"Charlene does not smoke nor drink. But she will get lonely while working. One time she was filming in China and had a 2 day break. Charlene took a flight back to Hong Kong, hoping to see Ronald. He was at a friend's party and told her to wait for him at home.\"\n\n\"Charlene waited 2 days and he still did not show up! She could not get in touch with him. Charlene was extremely angry at Ronald that time. She had to return to China to work. Due to this incident, she realized that her relationship with Ronald will not work out.\"\n\nAt recent public events, Charlene often hinted that she had drawn the boundaries with Ronald. In a recent radio interview, she said she did not like tattooed men. Appearing at a no smoking event, Charlene said she had a sensitive nose and hated cigarette smoke. Each of her remarks were aimed at Ronald.\n\nRonald realized his wrong ways and tried to save the relationship. At a Malaysian concert in April 2007, fans cried out Ronald's ex-girlfriend's name, Miriam Yeung Chin Wah. But Ronald joked to the audience, \"Perhaps you should call out Charlene's name instead!\"\n\nRonald tried to publicly reveal his relationship with Charlene, but that did not change her mind about breaking up. In June, a tabloid published photos of Ronald chain-smoking on the street. After seeing the photos and the true Ronald, Charlene's last hopes died and decided to split up.\n\nAlthough Ronald has not been busily occupied by work lately, he appears to be overly tired. On the other hand, Charlene has appeared to be more energetic and beautiful since breaking up with Ronald.\n\nSource: ent.mop.com\n\nCredits: Jayne"
