        "text": "As the ambassador for the Hong Kong Animation Comic Game festival, Charlene Choi, also known as Ah Sa, discussed the future of Cantopop girl duo Twins and stressed that they are both concentrating on their individual work commitments and will not disband. She also shared that the coming year will mark Twins' 10th anniversary since their debut in the entertainment industry, and the pair might perform onstage together.\n\nIt has not easy for her Twins partner, Gillian Chung (also known as Ah Jiao), to make her comeback in the entertainment industry since her involvement in the Edison Chen sex photo scandal. Gillian will soon release her first solo singleand Charlene plans to support her fellow sister by purchasing ten copies. On that note, Ah Sa reiterated again that Twins will not be splitting up and they are merely focusing on their individual careers for now.\n\nAlthough the decision lies in the hands of their company, the petite singer hopes for a Twins reunion on stage next year. Apart from the rumours on the duo's alleged separation, Ah Sa's relationship with Ronald Cheng has also been under the scrutiny of the media. Their parents were recently spotted dining together, sparking off talks of a possible marriage in progress. \"[Our parents] have a business relationship. I can't be bothered. I've said this at least a thousand times - I will only get married when I hit 30 years and above,\" the singer retorted.\n\nSOURCE"
