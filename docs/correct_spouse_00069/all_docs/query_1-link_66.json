This is the big story breaking right now, with all the headlines blaring the words “SHOCKER!” Because, well, it is: Actress Lee Jia, who just a month ago confirmed a romance with A-list movie star and Athena co-star Jung Woo-sung, is married. To groundbreaking rocker Seo Taiji, who practically reinvented the … Continue reading \"Lee Jia is married to (and divorcing)… Seo Taiji\"",

        "text": "JAVABEANS : PLEASE UPDATE YOUR POST!!!\n\n1.They have no children.\n\n2. They already divorced years ago.\n\nThere are so many unfortunately misunderstandings going on here. There are too much hates for Lee Ji Ah. They are calling her gold digger, a cheater, a betrayer, a liar. In my opinion, she is a woman who wants to live as a normal wife, she must feel too tired of hiding the truth all the past years. Have u ever imagined how her life has been in the past? hiding all the time , unable to do anything as a normal person, feel like she can't breathe properly, gosh it must feel like living in hell T.T\n\nAnd she did all these for whose benefits? Of course , it's Seo Taji. Who did all the that to someone you don't love right? She must love him so much.\n\nAnd the timing of this breaking new is so fishy indeed. I believe there is a conspiracy here. The government simply used this new to distract the attentions coughs coughs. And some reporters are being paid to blow off the new out of proportion sighs. This is just insane how people immediately believe in everything media said and attacked and bad mouth Lee Ji Ah\n\nI actually feel bad for Lee Ji Ah.\n\nThey attacked and blamed everything on her, jumped in the conclusion. Wake up, crazy netizens and the media!!\n\nTo marry in such a early age , 20, to a legend of kpop and keep a secret marriage for 14 years . If you were her, how do you feel?\n\nOkay she started her career in Legend and became famous in 2007. She might got the role through connection or talents. I won't argue about it but you all have to agree that no one sure 100% about it right? But yeah, her first role was quite good as a newbie. I'm not a fan of her acting though but I think she got potential to go further.\n\nAnd something I feel a bit off\n\nSeo TaiJi said they divorced in 2006 and Lee Ji Ah said 2009. I don't believe that he is telling the truth. If they indeed divorced in 2006, Lee Ji Ah would never able to join Key East. I think Bae Yong Jun knew the truth all along. He is very close friend of STJ . He seemly just try to clean up the mess so he denied the fact that he knew about their marriage. It's business after all. Cruel reality.\n\nI guess there are some problems about their marriage which hasn't been revealed yet. That's the reason why there is a lawsuit now .\n\nI don't know much about Seo Taiji . He is indeed a legend of kpop which has a big influence in the entertainment industry. But he is a human too, he is no god. Everyone has secrets. Everyone made mistakes. Who knows? It's just like watching a real korean drama with so many unbelievable secrets. In the drama, he might be actually a villain here. He might be the one behind all of this. He might be the one who bought the reporters to stalk Jung Woo Sung and Lee Ji Ah, to write this breaking new in order to ruin Lee Ji Ah's life and her new love life. He might feel too jealous of her happy life. Or may be he is really innocent .The truth will come out eventually .\n\nAnd a comment about Jung Woo Sung. What can I say? At first, when I heard the new , my reaction was \"Poor Jung Woo Sung. He must feel heart broken\". But after reading the news and all the different comments, I start to realise that haizzz I might be so naive to believe that he doesn't know the truth and in shock. It might be that what the agency want to do some damage control here. He actually knew everything .To save his career, he will decide to dump her immediately. If it is true , I will feel very disappointed in you, Jung Woo Sung . He seems ignorant and coward if he dump her now in this situation without listening to the truth. How I wish his reaction was different. I know it's hard decision, really tough indeed. If he is really love Lee Ji Ah, he should stay by her side no matter what other said. Find her and talk to her. She must feel very scared and lonely to face this hellish storm on her own. At least being her friend if he is really care for her. I'll wait for his press conference to hear what he's gonna say.\n\nAnd year, I don't 100% believe in Lee Ji Ah . I'm sure there are still some hidden secrets around and soon to be revealed. There might be few more lies . But I still pity her.\n\nAll I hope for is all the people involved will not get hurt . Actually it's gonna be hurt , damn hurt but I hope they stay strong , find the best solution to end this scandal in peace. I hope that Lee Ji Ah 's career won't be ruined by this scandal because it's just seem unfair you know."
