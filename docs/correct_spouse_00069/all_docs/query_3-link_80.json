        "text": "UPDATED - Scarlett Johansson Camouflages Her Baby Bump on First Red Carpet After Pregnancy Reveal\n\nScarlett Johansson has become engaged to her boyfriend Romain Dauriac.\n\nJournalist Dauriac reportedly proposed to the actress about a month ago. They have been together for ten months.\n\n\"They're engaged and very happy,\" a source confirmed to People. See a picture of the ring below.\n\nJohansson and Dauriac attended her Under the Skin premiere at the 70th Venice International Film Festival last night (September 3).\n\nIn February, she dismissed reports that the two were engaged.\n\nJohansson previously said that she has rarely thought about marrying again due to her divorce from ex-husband Ryan Reynolds in December 2010.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nJamie Lynn Spears marries partner Jamie Watson in New Orleans?\n\nJamie Lynn Spears has reportedly married her partner Jamie Watson.\n\nThe younger sister of Britney Spears announced the news of her engagement last year. She posted a picture of the engagement ring on her Instagram page.\n\nUS sources (via E!

Their pictures are often circulated throughout many forums/websites which is how they gain (and to also maintain) their popularity.\n\nWhat is a VIETNAMESE Net Idol?\n\nA Vietnamese net idol is similar to any other net idols--they achieve their popularity through the internet. The difference between a Vietnamese net idol to that of other countries' is that Vietnamese net idols are often people who \"have made a name for themselves by being a socially active teen icon through the press and online community\" (quoted from truffles14). They do NOT have to have the \"best face\" like what you would consider an \"Uhlzzang\".\n\nSo there are only Vietnamese Net Idols in Vietnam?\n\nVietnamese net idols are very well spread out. We've had a few that are from United States, to France, to Australia, and even Hong Kong. Most of these net idols are often not as popular as the ones in Vietnam, but they are still famous.\n\nCan I post pictures of people I know?\n\nNO. NO. NO. NO. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.

With her features becoming more defined, she looks nothing like how she was when she first debuted.\n\nWhen the media approached Tavia when she was working at the TVB City last Wednesday, the actress vehemently refused to allow photos of her side profile to be taken.\n\nWhen asked to address the plastic surgery rumours, she admitted that she once went to a doctor to have a mole removed, but insisted that her improved looks are all due to make-up.\n\nMeanwhile, there is still no word on whether Tavia, whose contract with TVB is ending soon, will sign on with the company.\n\nSpeculation has been rife that the actress, who has been with TVB for 15 years, had plans to leave the TV station with fellow actor Moses Chan and her long-time manager Chan Ka Lei.\n\nThough Moses and Ka Lei have decided to remain with TVB, Tavia's departure cannot be ruled out as she has been rumoured to have received many attractive offers from Chinese entertainment companies.\n\nHim Law and Tavia Yeung.\n\nSource\n\n↧\n\nMarian Rivera\n\nPrimetime Queen of Philippine Television and Phenomenal Star!!!\n\nThis Forum is dedicated to those Asian fans of Marian Rivera who loves Marimar, Dyesebel, Dangerous Love and Temptation of Wife :))\n\nName:MARIAN RIVERA GRACIA\n\nBirthday: August 12, 1984\n\nRace: Filipina-Spanish\n\nParents: Francisco Javier Gracia and Amalia Rivera\n\nFilipino Heritage: Cavitenia\n\nEducation: Degree in Psychology (De La Salle University-Dasmariñas)\n\nJobs: Actress/Dancer/Model/Product Endorser/Red Cross Philippines Celebrity Endorser\n\nShowbiz Entrance: 2005\n\nStatus: In Relationship W/ Dingdong Dantes (Twitter: @iamdongdantes | Instagram: @dongdantes)\n\nHobbies: Painting, Cooking, Shopping, Visiting various churches with BFF Roxanne and/or BF Dingdong\n\nFavorites: Chocolates, Butterfly, Sully, Finn & Jake, Oggy & The Cockroaches, Phineas & Ferb, Shrek\n\nINSTAGRAM: @therealmarian\n\nFan Clubs:\n\nAWARDS & RECOGNITION\n\n2006\n\n20th PMPC Star Awards for Television – Best New Female TV Personality – Kung Mamahalin Mo Lang Ako – Awardee\n\n2008\n\n4th USTV Students’ Choice Awards Most Popular Actress in a Drama/Miniseries- MariMar -Awardee\n\n1st Annual Fil-Am Visionary Awards Favorite Television Actress- Awardee\n\n38th Box-Office Entertainment Awards – Most Promising Female Star My Best Friend’s Girlfriend – Awardee\n\nPhenomenal TV Star Dyesebel – Awardee\n\nFAMAS – German Moreno Young Achievement Award Desperadas 2- Awardee\n\nWalk of Fame STAR\n\nFHM PH Sexiest – #1\n\n2009\n\n6th Golden Screen Awards – Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role—Musical or Comedy -My Bestfriend’s Girlfriend -Nominee\n\n40th Guillermo Memorial Scholarship Award Valentine Box Office Queen – Awardee\n\nFHM PH Sexiest, #2\n\nYES Magazine’s Most Beautiful\n\n2010\n\n36th Metro Manila Film Festival – Best Actress – Super Inday and The Golden Bibe – Nominee\n\nFHM PH, #3\n\nYes Magazine A-Listers, #6\n\nYahoo PH Top Searches, #9\n\n2011\n\nPinaka-Palaban Women in Pinoy Showbiz, #5\n\nPinaka-HOT Buff Babe, #4\n\nYes Mag 100 Most Beautiful A-Lister\n\nUS Girls’ One of 2011 Face of The Year\n\nYes Mag Top 20 Celebrity Endorsers, #6\n\n8th Golden Screen Awards – Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Drama Series – Amaya – Nominee\n\nKzone Awards Philippines -Fave TV Actress – Amaya – Awardee\n\nFHM PH, #2\n\n2012\n\nNorthwest State Samar University – Best Actress (Amaya)\n\nTRU Favorite Celebrities Survey – #3\n\nInside Showbiz Sexiext Women – #3\n\nTop Tenz 10 International Beauties – #9\n\nFHM Philippines 2012 Sexiest – #5\n\nAMAYA – Best Drama Series, 2012 PMPC\n\nTweets For My Sweet – BEST COMEDY/GAG SHOW, Nominee\n\nTweets For My Sweet – Best Comedy Actress, Nomineee\n\nPARTY PILIPINAS MOST LIKED\n\nMost Liked Performer\n\nMost Liked Kilig Moments – DongYan\n\nMost Liked Love Team – DONGYAN\n\nMost Liked Actress\n\nMost Liked Kapuso Artist\n\nMEG’s Top Choice\n\nTop cover\n\nBest Red Lips\n\nBest Couple – DongYan\n\n2012 Golden Screen TV Awards\n\nBest Actress in Drama – Amaya : Nominee | WINNER\n\nBest Comedy Actress – Tweets For My Sweet : Nominee\n\nBest Original Series – Amaya : Nominee\n\nBest Comedy Program – Tweets For My Sweet : Nominee\n\n2013\n\nBest Actress in a Primetime Teleserye: Amaya – Northwest State Samar University\n\nFHM PH Sexiest\n\nYahoo PH OMG Celebrity of the Year\n\n2013 PMPC Star Awards for TV: Best Actress Winner\n\n2013 Asian Television Awards: Best Actress Nominee:\n\n————————————-\n\nTV Projects\n\n2005\n\nKung Mamahalin Mo Lang Ako – Joyce Cardenal – TAPE, Inc.\n\n2006\n\nAgawin Mo Man Ang Lahat – Almira Alejandro /Isadora/Alegra\n\nPinakamamahal- Carissa Crismundo\n\n2007\n\nMuli-Racquel Estadilla\n\nSuper Twins -Ester Paredes\n\nMariMar -Marimar Perez / Bella Aldama\n\n2008\n\nDyesebel- Dyesebel / Isabel / Cassandra\n\n2009\n\nAng Babaeng Hinugot Sa Aking Tadyang- Proserfina J.

Jones: ‘I Was a Paid Hypocrite’\n\nFormer “Two and a Half Men” star Angus T. Jones has addressed his former show once again, saying that he was “a paid hypocrite” for the CBS comedy.\n\nDuring an interview with Houston television station KHOU, Jones — who played Jake Harper on the series — took himself to task, admitting that he went along with the series even though it didn't fit with his Christian beliefs.\n\n“[The show] was making light of topics in our world that are really problems for a lot of people, and I was a paid hypocrite, because I wasn't OK with it but I was still doing it,” Jones said.\n\nThough Jones is now a student in Colorado and recently spent time with Houston's World Harvest Outreach Church, the 20-year-old added that he would consider acting again, if the gig was in alignment with his religious convictions.\n\n“There's a few different productions that do kind of Bible-based stories and stuff like that,” Jones noted.\n\nJones parted ways with “Two and a Half Men” last year after blasting the series, calling it “filthy” and imploring viewers not to watch it.\n\n“If you watch ‘Two and a Half Men,’ please stop watching ‘Two and a Half Men,'” Jones said in a video published online. “I'm on ‘Two and a Half Men,’ and I don't want to be on it. Please stop watching it. Please stop filling your head with filth. Please.”\n\nJones quickly issued an apology for his comments, saying in a statement, “I apologize if my remarks reflect me showing indifference to and disrespect of my colleagues and a lack of appreciation of the extraordinary opportunity of which I have been blessed, I never intended that.”\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n[official] ♥♥ Charlene Choi Aka Sa (阿sa)♥♥\n\nTalented-Caring-Sweet: Actress, Singer, Model, Author [lots Of Pics]\n\nWelcome to Charlene Choi's 蔡卓妍 Official Thread in Soompi!\n\nCharlene is a really cute actress from Hong Kong. She debuted at the age of 18 in 2000 as a actress, than she debuted as a singer in the most popular Hong Kong band TWINS at 19, and is the youngest female ever to hold a concert in Hong Kong Colisuem. In her short 7 years in the singing industry and 9 years in the movie industry, she has already made over 30 movies, 3 series. Not to mention in the \"Twins\". Currently working on the movie industry.\n\nCharlene was born in Vancouver, Canada. However her family moved back to Hong Kong a year later. She currently resides in Kowloon. Her height is 5'5\".\n\nCharlene studied at a number of different institutions. She attended Marymount Secondary School. In the year 1998, due to her poor academic result and conduct, she was transferred to Rosaryhill School for her studies. In the year 2001, after completed her F.5 studies, she started to become a full-time model in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2001, she was offered to form the Emperor Entertainment Group musical group Twins with Gillian Chung (colloquially known as Gill). Choi since then has been come to known as Charlene, or simply Ah-Sa. In the beginning of twins, there have always been rumors of the two not getting along, mostly because of difference between the two's characters. Gillian was always thought of as the more conservative, and quiet one, while Charlene was the more talkative and outgoing type of character. After 3 or 4 years together, they both had time off and had arranged to go to Taiwan together. After spending so much more stress free time together, they really got to know each other a lot better, and the two have now become best friends. Now after being in the group for over 6 years, twins have announced numerous times that they do not want to be apart, and really enjoy being with each other despite the fact that their management company EEG had suggestions of having the two have solo careers. Twins is now still just as popular as before and have been continuing producing lots of records and movies, and are two of the most successful artists of EEG. Gillian is filming a television series in mainland China, so Charlene has been separated from her for many months now, with many to come, and has been somewhat doing solo acts on TV appearances.\n\nCharlene Choi | Looking Ahead\n\nCharlene Choi | Profile\n\nEnglish name: Charlene Choi Cheuk Yin\n\nChinese Name: 蔡卓妍\n\nNickname: Ah Sa, Sa\n\nLanguages Spoken: Cantonese, English,

The couple were caught kissing on camera at the outdoor seating of some restaurant. From the surroundings and their outfits in the photo, they were probably on their date in a Sai Kung restaurant. That day, the two didn't just hold hands and share a cookie, they also shared a sweet kiss!\n\nJust became the new \"Mrs. Bosco\", yesterday morning Vanessa was spotted driving Bosco's \"wife\" (antique car) to Tsim Sha Tsui to attend the Hong Kong Film Awards press conference. Vanessa got out of the car with a wide smile on her face. Asked if she's really dating Bosco? She openly admitted: \"Yes la, still getting to know one another.\" She also added she has known Bosco for a long time. Asked if it was Bosco who pursued her? She said: \"You all should ask him.\" When speaking of the two caught on a date in Sai Kung? She smiled: \"Just normal social activities. (Held hands and kissed?) Yes la, please give us some space.\" Asked what she liked about Bosco? Vanessa praised Bosco for being filial and he's ambitious. Is she not afraid of a 'sister-brother' relationship? She said: \"Most important is being able to communicate.\" Asked if Bosco's ex-girlfriend Myolie Wu knew about their relationship? She said: \"Thank you all.\" When Vanessa was getting into her car, reporters kept asking her questions about the relationship, but she just smiled sweetly and did not answer. Asked if she and Bosco are going on a date later tonight? She expressed she's going home.\n\nAlso, yesterday afternoon Bosco appeared at TVB City in Tseung Kwan O getting ready work on new series Double Fantasies. Bosco had on the same hat he wore that day when he was spotted kissing Vanessa. Asked about Vanessa driving his beloved car? Bosco said: \"She borrowed it. She took my car to the shop. (Why don't you let others borrow the car when they ask?) Well I have many cars and this one doesn't get driven much, so just got someone to use it.\" Asked what stage their relationship has developed to? He said: \"Ok la, still getting to know each other. (So sweet?) I'm very happy now.\" Asked about their Sai Kung date? He had the same response as Vanessa, \"Just normal social activities. We haven't met the parents yet, but my mother already knows about us.\" He praised Vanessa's high EQ, she's clever and they have things in common. When speaking of a 'sister-brother' relationship, he defended his girlfriend: \"Age is not something we consider.\" Bosco also declared his love, \"We were just doing things normal people would do. I hope everyone will give us some personal space. We are both serious towards this relationship and I really hope to get blessings from you all. I would really appreciate it.\"\n\nMyolie Sends Blessings to Ex-Boyfriend\n\nYesterday ex-girlfriend Myolie expressed she already knew about the relationship because many people notified her. She's currently in Osaka, Japan and expressed in a long distance telephone interview that she wish Bosco and his girlfriend the best. \"Congratulations to them. I wish them all the best.\" Ex-boyfriend has already found a new lover, what about Myolie? She said: \"I'm working hard on it!\"\n\nKate Tsui Clueless about Bosco's New Romance\n\nFormer rumored girlfriend Kate Tsui waas asked about \"good brother' Bosco Wong's new romance, but Kate asked the reporter back: \"Which good brother?

I haven't seen him since the last series we filmed Midas.\"\n\n↧\n\nJackie Chan clarifies rumours about health problems\n\nAfter rumours of his declining health spread due to his late night visit to the hospital, Jackie Chan steps up to address the issue\n\nHong Kong action star Jackie Chan sparked rumours about his declining health after he secretly made a late night visit to the hospital on Tuesday night.\n\nJackie, who is turning 60 on April 7, will be holding aPeace & Love & Friendship concert in Beijing one day before his birthday to celebrate with his fans and friends in the entertainment industry.\n\nWith his sudden admission to the hospital, it seemed as if the martial artist had problems with his health, but he revealed that he was only there for a body checkup.\n\nJackie said: “I’m almost 60 and my friends are suggesting for me to go for a checkup, a 24-hour stay is just so I can go through the full body checkup procedure.”\n\nAlthough Jackie has always been negligent with health checkups, he wanted to set his family’s hearts at ease after hearing about many of his industry friends discovering their ailments too late due to inattention. The checkup was also strongly requested by his actor son Jaycee Chan.\n\nJackie expressed, “I haven’t had a checkup for more than 8 years, and he (Jaycee) hopes that I can live past 100 years!\n\nSource\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nDid Ethan Ruan and Tiffany Hsu marry in secret?\n\nTaiwanese actor and actress Ethan Ruan and Tiffany Hsu, who have been dating for seven years, were rumoured to have wedded in secret on Tuesday.\n\nThe couple revealed two years ago that they planned to marry in 2014, and last year, both even said that they “could get married any time”.\n\nA source also revealed that Ethan even spent NT100 million (approximately S$4.17 million) on a mansion, which would be their new home.\n\nHowever, both Ethan and Tiffany denied that they got married. Responding to media queries at his home yesterday, Ethan said: “Don’t listen to what others say” and jokingly told reporters they should ask Tiffany about their marriage matters instead.\n\nAt that time, Ethan was carrying a box which resembled a gift box often used in weddings. When reporters tried to verify if the box contained a wedding cake, he exclaimed in reply, “It’s not a wedding cake; it’s just a cake!”\n\nHe also denied that he bought the mansion, and brushed reporters off. “Don’t ask me this, I’m busy now,” he said before escaping into his car and sped off. Reporters also spotted Tiffany, who was wearing shades, seated in the car.\n\nAlthough Tiffany could not be reached for comment, her manager said that Tiffany was actually attending an event on Tuesday, and only ended work at midnight.\n\nWhen reporters checked with real estate agents on Ethan’s rumoured purchase of the mansion, a staff member admitted that he “came to view the apartment last month.”\n\nHe also added that Ethan has been eyeing a 100-square-metre apartment, and they are currently negotiating on the price of the house.\n\nSource\n\n↧\n\nKim Kardashian Covers Vogue in a Wedding Dress\n\nThe supposed rift between Kim Kardashian and Anna Wintour seems to be out like last year's trends.

Some buyers were seen purchasing HK200,000 (approximately S$32,000) worth of tickets, while some were seen teaching Filipinos standing in the queue how to purchase tickets, before passing them slips of paper with dates written on it. The most expensive tickets appeared to have been indicated.\n\nSome fans said that the Filipinos appeared to be resellers from the black market, and apart from cutting queue, they had also frightened fans with their words.\n\nA black market for tickets has started online, and the most expensive tickets at HK980 (approximately S$161) were priced up to five times its original price at RMB 5499 (approximately S$904).\n\nMayday’s management said: “Mayday is very concerned for their fans, and is calling for the Hong Kong police to deal with the problem, before it escalates.”\n\nSource\n\n↧"
