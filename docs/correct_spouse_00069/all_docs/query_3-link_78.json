        "text": "THE mother of Chinese model-cum-actress Lynn Xiong was unhappy with the HK$800,000 (S$130,000) dowry offered by artiste Aaron Kwok to marry her daughter, China Press reported.\n\nIt was speculated that Kwok, 45, and 30-year-old Xiong had planned to tie the knot this year.\n\nEarlier this month, Xiong and her mother were spotted meeting Kwok in Hong Kong supposedly to discuss wedding plans.\n\nAn insider said her mother wanted a higher dowry and demanded that a wedding banquet also be held in her Nanjing hometown in China.\n\nKwok, however, stood by his decision to give only HK$800,000. The mother was seen leaving unhappily.\n\nWhen approached, both the mother and Xiong refused to talk to reporters.\n\nLynn first met Aaron when she starred in his music video four years ago. Although it has been known that they are a pair, none of them has publicly admitted to the relationship.\n\nAmong female celebrities in Hong Kong, Michelle Reis was paid the highest dowry when she married Julian Hui in 2008. Her parents received HK$3.8mil.\n\nActor-cum-singer Ronald Cheng gave HK$1.9mil to Charlene Choi's mother when the couple got married in 2006. They, however, divorced last year. Cantopop singer Miriam Yeung's parents received HK$990,000 from her husband Real Ting.\n\n-The Star/Asia News Network, The Daily Chilli"
