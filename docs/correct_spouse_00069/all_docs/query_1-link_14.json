        "text": "Charlene Choi Cheuk-yin (below) of the Canto-pop girl group Twins has ended her six-year relationship with singer-actor boyfriend Ronald Cheng Chung-kei.\n\nChoi's announcement took reporters by surprise in Beijing, where she was promoting her latest film, Beauty on Duty, this week. The confession came when she was asked to comment on rumours saying they were already married.\n\n'We broke up a while ago. I hope there won't be any more questions about how sweet we are. We are no longer together,' she says.\n\n'There wasn't any third person in our relationship and it has nothing to do with marriage. We broke up peacefully, probably because we know each other too much. I have some beautiful memories of this relationship that I'll never forget.'\n\nThe couple started dating in 2004 when they starred in Hidden Heroes, a mo lei tau (nonsensical) comedy.\n\nCheng, who's also promoting his latest film, Just Another Pandora's Box, in Chengdu, acknowledged the break-up and said they'd always remain good friends.\n\nChoi hopes the news will put an end to rumours about Cheng and her. 'I don't normally want to talk about my private life, but there's been much speculation lately so I have to clarify. This will be the last time I talk about my relationships.'"
