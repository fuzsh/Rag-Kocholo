Kevin Cheng, who has been in the industry for 22 years, has always done the same. From his debut till now, there have been many girls surrounding him. Although he has dated Linda Wong, Niki Chow and Charmaine Sheh in the past, he had always been very low-profile about the relationships in front of the media. However, who knew that this time, having only dated Grace Chan for 4 months, he has changed his ways.\n\nKevin Cheng and 2013 Miss Hong Kong Champion, Grace Chan, were exposed to have sparked a relationship for 2 months because of TVB drama \"Blue Veins\", back in April. Although the two were photographed together several times, they had always denied this 21 year gap \"father-daughter\" relationship. The day before, Kevin attended the blessing ceremony for new Mainland drama \"Tai Chi Master: The Door of Tai Chi\" in Hengdian. Many reporters asked about his relationship with Grace Chan. He was all smiles, and finally admitted the two are dating: \"Recently, the phrase I've been saying the most is \"Hope you give us some space.\" I think it's a very normal thing (dating), and, we are indeed dating, thank you for everyone's concern. I've said it many times, I'm not a reality show, nor is there some kind of development, but everytime, it seems like I have to announce and report to everyone. So, please just give us some more space, thank you everyone.\"\n\nAs Kevin unprecedentedly announced their relationship, a reporter asked whether \"good news\" (marriage) is near? Kevin replied: \"Let's talk about this topic later. This thing, you can't rush it. That's not something that's going to happen just because I say it, it's mutual. Not something that you just say and it will happen.\" Another reporter asked: \"Do you mean now that you guys are together, she has more control?\" Kevin quickly denied: \"Don't be like that, I didn't say that. I'm just saying that some thing, there needs to be respect for each other. We need to see whether we are suitable, then we'll talk about it.\"\n\nGrace Chan: \"Our minds are in sync\"\n\nRegarding Kevin Cheng admitting the two are dating, Grace Chan was asked about this when she attended a function in Tseung Kwan O last night. In the beginning, she said: \"I don't know how to answer. We have been interacting and going on dates.\" She thought for a bit, and said: \"Yes, after going on dates, we understood each other a lot more, and I understand what kind of person he is. But this is still a private matter, hope everyone can give us some space.\" She also denied her father got angry about the news of her spending the night at Kevin Cheng's house on Father's Day: \"Daddy's response was just to protect me. He understand our relationship. Dating is a very normal thing, don't need to discuss it out in the open.\" As for her boyfriend openly admitting their relationship this time, she replied: \"We talked about it. Our minds are in sync. Thank you for everyone's care and concern.\"\n\nActually, this past Wednesday was Grace Chan's 24th birthday, and Kevin was seen standing next to Grace in a group photo. Their boyfriend-girlfriend relationship seemed to be quite evident already. Previously, there was also reports that while Grace was working in Paris, Kevin even flew to Paris to accompany her, and pre-celebrated her birthday. The two spent a romantic 5 day 4 nights vacation.\n\nFor her boyfriend, Grace Chan even spent the night at Kevin's home in Tai Hang on Father's Day, the day they came back to Hong Kong, instead of celebrating with her father. As for last night's event, Kevin's ex-girlfriend, Charmaine Sheh was absent due to sickness, Grace said: “Not wanting to see me may not be the reason why Ah Sheh is absent. Hope she recovers soon!\"\n\n↧\n\nCan't Buy Me Love star Amanda Peterson dies, aged 43\n\nCan't Buy Me Love star Amanda Peterson dies, aged 43\n\nCan't Buy Me Love star Amanda Peterson has died at the age of 43.\n\nThe actress's family has confirmed that she passed away from unknown causes in Colorado earlier this week, reports TMZ.\n\nHer father told the website: \"She had some illness and a sleep apnea problem that may have contributed [to her death].\"\n\nPeterson rose to fame starring opposite Patrick Dempsey in the classic 1980s teen comedy Can't Buy Me Love.\n\nThe actress also starred in the Emmy Award-winning miniseries A Year in the Life, and also briefly appeared in Doogie Howser, MD.\n\nPeterson left Hollywood in 1994 to return to her home state of Colorado.\n\nSource\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nBill Cosby once admitted to buying Quaaludes for women, court documents show\n\nBill Cosby once admitted to buying Quaaludes for women, court documents show\n\nBill Cosby once acknowledged in court that he bought the sedative known as Methaqualone for a woman he wanted to have sexual contact with, according to court documents.\n\nThe AP successfully petitioned a Pennsylvania federal court to unseal documents pertaining to a sexual assault lawsuit filed against Cosby by a Temple University employee a decade ago.\n\nThe news service published an excerpt from Cosby's testimony during court proceedings, in which he was asked by an opposing attorney if he'd used the sedative – commonly known as a Quaalude – after it was banned.\n\n\"When you got the quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with?\" lawyer Dolores M Troiani questioned.\n\nAccording to these unsealed court documents, Cosby answered: \"Yes.\"\n\nCosby acknowledged that he had given the sedative to at least one woman and \"other people\".\n\nA woman involved with the case and a separate female also acknowledged that they had willingly taken Quaaludes from Cosby, court documents suggest.\n\nCosby ultimately settled the sexual assault lawsuit in 2006, although the exact terms remain confidential.\n\nDigital Spy has reached out to Cosby's attorney for comment on these court documents.\n\nRepresentatives for the 77-year-old issued a statement to ABC News, saying: \"The only reason Mr Cosby settled was because it would have been embarrassing in those days to put all those women on the stand and his family had no clue. That would have been very hurtful.\"\n\nIn all, Cosby has been accused of drugging and/or assaulting more than 30 women over the last 40 years.\n\nAmong the women who have accused the comic of impropriety are supermodels Janice Dickinson and Beverly Johnson, Lou Ferrigno's wife Carla Ferrigno and actress Michelle Hurd.\n\nCosby has not been criminally charged, and has strenuously maintained his innocence.\n\nSource\n\n↧\n\nPrincess Charlotte Looks Adorable in Official Christening Photos\n\nOnly days after Kate Middleton and Prince William baptized daughter Princess Charlotte, Kensington Palace has released four official photos of the ceremony taken by famed photographer Mario Testino.\n\nIn one shot, Kate Middleton smiles while holding Charlotte and gazing at her infant. Charlotte, ready for her close-up, makes eye contact with the camera. In a second, the family of four poses, with Prince William holding Prince George (who is playing with his hair), while Middleton holds Charlotte. A third shot, black and white, features Prince William holding Prince George, and the last is of the entire family, both royals and Middletons.\n\nIt’s not the first time Testino has snapped the royals. Aside from being Princess Diana’s favorite photographer (having shot her infamous Vanity Fair spread before her death at age 36), he took Will and Kate’s official engagement photos in 2011, along with previous shots of Prince Charles, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Prince Harry.\n\nDuring Charlotte’s christening ceremony, the princess was blessed with a total of five godparents. “There’s no set rule for how many godparents a royal child is given, although it’s certainly more than the average person,” CNN royal expert Victoria Arbiter, previously told Yahoo Parenting. “William and Harry each have six godparents and George has seven.”\n\nHowever, in the case of the royals, godparents won’t serve as potential legal guardians — according to Arbiter, the titles are merely symbolic for those who will provide guidance and friendship to Charlotte. And as for reports that Kate sister Pippa and William’s brother Harry were overlooked for the role, Arbiter says, “As aunt and uncle, they already have a close and meaningful relationship with the Cambridge children so there is no need for them to serve as godparents.” What’s more, she adds, in the U.K., siblings aren’t usually asked to be godparents.\n\nSource\n\n↧\n\nOne Direction\n\nI became aware of One Direction after seeing friends&family repeatedly mentioning them on Twitter and FB.

When asked to confirm the news, JVR Music replied in the positive, and revealed that the newlyweds had just returned to Taiwan on 2 April after their honeymoon in Thailand. As for Hannah\\'s pregnancy, the company stated that Jay has yet to release any other information about it.

Credit : ashley @ Jdorama In 1987, he was taken on by the Johnny's Jimusho talent agency, which specializes in handsome young male idols, and became a member of Johnny's Junior. One of his relatives had sent in the application. He was in a Jr. unit called \"Skate Boys\". Skate Boys used to be backup dancers of Hikaru Genji, which at the time was a popular group. In 1988, SMAP (Masahiro Nakai, Takuya Kimura, Goro Ingaki, Katsuyuki Mori, Tsuyoshi Kusanagi, Shingo Katori) was created. Although all SMAP members were in a dorama in 1988, Takuya's father didn't like his son working in the entertainment industry. In 1989, Takuya was in a play called Modoken. When Takuya's father came to see the play, he was impressed by his son's acting ability, and urged his son to pursue his career. In 1990, he was in a drama called \"Brother, sister, I don't wanna die!\" He starred as a sick boy. In 1991, his dream was realized when SMAP debuted with a single called \"Can't Stop!! ~Loving.\" However, SMAP was not very popular for a Johnny's Idol Group at that time. Their debut single wasn't a success, and when they had their first concert, the hall was almost empty. SMAP slowly gained popularity through a variety program called 愛ラブSMAP, though. 1993 was a year of opportunity for SMAP and Takuya. He was in a drama called Asunaro Hakusho, which was a huge hit. In that drama, he starred as Osamu Toride, an university student who is in love with a girl called Narumi Sonoda. Toride was portrayed as a shy guy who only cares about one girl. SMAP also got more popular with a single called $10. Hikaru Genji was not as popular anymore and it was time for SMAP to get the spotlight. In 1994, Kimutaku Syndrome made this newcomer a superstar. But in reality, he hates being called Kimutaku and has asked his fans not to call him that. He was voted the Favorite Guy by Japanese women's magazine \"AnAn\", and was also voted as the Best Jeanist. So far, he has been voted the favorite guy 12 times consecutively and will not be included from next year. In 1995, he was also in a movie called 君を忘れない, which gained people's attention. In 1996, a drama called Long Vacation made him even more popular. He was a young shy pianist called \"Sena\" who falls in love with an older girl who used be a model. 'Long Vacation' topped the TV ratings, and ever since, every drama of Takuya has become a big hit. SMAP then started a variety show called 'SMAP X SMAP' which made SMAP even more popular. In 1997, he was in two dramas. 'Gift' and 'Love Generation.\" Love Generation topped the ratings and was very popular. Gift was criticized in some ways because some people thought it encouraged teenage crime. In 1999, he broke up with his longtime girlfriend, Kaorin. He and Kaorin were together for nine years, but Kaorin dumped Takuya because she was tired of being 'Kimutaku's girlfriend.' Takuya was very sad about it. With the success of TV drama Beautiful Life, in 2000, he was at the peak of his popularity when he announced his marriage with 'Shizuka Kudo,' an idol singer. Of course, his fans were shocked and angered. Shizuka was pregnant when they announced their marriage. Many people thought Takuya Kimura's career would finish with his marriage. In 2001, however, Takuya proved that he was not finished yet with a drama called Hero. Hero set a record with its very high TV ratings. In 2001, his first daughter, Kokomi, was born and his second daughter, Mitsuki, was born in 2003. Takuya is still very popular. He was in many dramas after Hero, such as Sorakara Furu Ichiokuno Hoshi, Good Luck!!, and Pride. He was also in a movie called '2046' as Tak, and voice actor of Howl in Hayao Miyazaki's animation Howl's Moving Castle.

The actress's youngest son, Luca Dotti, recounts in a book to be released next month that her slender physique was the result of something more sinister.\n\nHe explains in an interview with People that, \"from the time she was 9 to 16, during World War II, she was extremely malnourished. The time she most needed nourishment, she didn't have enough food.\"\n\nDotti, 45, further explains in Audrey at Home: Memories of My Mother's Kitchen that, \"When the Nazis locked down Holland in 1944, they called it the Winter of Hunger and my mom didn't have enough to eat. Almost to the point of her body failing.\"\n\nAt the time, the future star survived primarily on the leafy green vegetable endive, tulip bulbs that she dug out of the ground, and water. She sometimes felt too weak to stand up, Dotti — whose father is Hepburn's late second husband, Italian psychiatrist Andrea Dotti — recalls.\n\n\"She would spend entire days in bed with a book, thus hoping to expel from her mind obsessive thoughts about food,\" Dotti writes.\n\nAt the end of the war, the 16-year-old Hepburn's 5-foot-6-inch frame weighed just 88 pounds.\n\n\"She suffered from asthma, jaundice, and other illnesses caused by malnutrition,\" Dotti notes, \"including acute anemia and a serious form of edema which Mum explained like this: 'It begins with your feet and when it reaches your heart, you die. With me, it was above the ankles when I was liberated.'\"\n\nThe Roman Holiday actress became a ferocious eater after being without food for so long. One of her favorites was chocolate, because she recalled a Dutch soldier giving her seven candy bars on one of the last days of the ordeal. Hepburn ate them all with some condensed milk from a United Nations relief organization, which she later supported.\n\n\"The liberation forces came in with all sorts of things, cigarettes and chocolate, and my mother hadn't eaten for months,\" Dotti tells People. \"She ate it up but her stomach wasn't prepared. It was too small. She couldn't keep it down. Her stomach had been empty for too long.\"\n\n\"Still, the taste of chocolate for her was connected with liberation,\" he added. \"It was the real taste of freedom.\"\n\nFor the rest of her life, the wispy leading lady kept chocolate in a chest of drawers in her living room and regularly made chocolate cake with whipped cream.\n\nThe British cigarettes carried by the Allied troops became a lifelong obsession, too. They were the ones she smoked until she died of cancer in 1993. She was 63 years old.\n\nBut for the rest of her life, she remained slim, although not for lack of trying. Dotti writes that his mother consumed large portions, especially when it came to pasta.\n\n\"A plate of spaghetti al pomodoro was always waiting for her\" when she arrived home from a trip, he recalls.\n\nAlthough, that wasn't really necessary since Hepburn often tucked pasta, olive oil, and cheese in her suitcase.\n\nSource\n\n↧\n\nFavorite Actor\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm3736271/\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n[Taiwanese Actor] Jasper Liu Yi Hao ♥劉以豪 Official Thread (Mr. Dimples)\n\nLiu Yi Hao (Jasper Liu) ♥ 劉以豪\n\nModel -

In the beginning, the relationship was not widely supported because \"the woman was above the man\" (as Charlene's career was much more successful). However, ever since William Chan started to develop his career in Mainland China, his popularity shot up sky high after the ancient drama \"Swords of Legend\". The voices from outsiders immediately changed and felt that William's popularity has even went above Charlene's. In addition to being apart all the time, rumours of the two breaking up were often reported, but the couple had always denied it.\n\nLast night after midnight, William Chan and Charlene Choi both posted a paragraph on Weibo, confessing about the two's relationship. In the end, they expressed that they have mutually decided to break up harmoniously, and hope that everyone can give them enough space to live their lives and work; officially announcing the end of their 5 year relationship.\n\nTheir announcement read: \"Every artist hopes that their hard work can be recognized, but often, the spotlight ends up being focused on our love lives. We can only tell ourselves that we knew what we would be getting into, entering this industry. However, as time passes, these things slowly becomes a type of pressure. When we want to explain, we also feel there is no need to explain. We want to retort, but we also don't want to stir things up and create a new story, but keeping silent also only hurts ourselves and we get accused for misunderstandings. We've tried to hold on and fight the challenge we were given, but we can only blame our hearts for not being as strong as its appearance, nor was our love as strong as we thought it was. So we have decided to separate in the most harmonious way, and we give the sincerest blessings to one another to continue heading towards our dreams, and at the same time, letting this relationship end with the most beautiful memories. We plead that everyone stop the hurting, stop the concern outside of our work, and stop the never-ending guesses and hatred. Please give us the space to work and live happily, and to feel the greatness this world brings us.\"\n\nAfter the announcement was posted, in a very short time, ten thousands of people had already seen it. Most fans left messages expressing what a shame it is. A fan said that both are so popular, they should use their time while they are still young to work hard, so maybe separating is a good thing. However, there were also a small amount of people that felt differently, saying they didn't support this couple from the beginning, and should have broken up long ago. There were also fans that said from when they announced their relationship to the break up now, the two rarely showed off any affection for each other. Being in a such a hard relationship, might as well separate early. Some also accused William Chan of wanting to break up after getting famous, and felt bad for Charlene.\n\n↧"
