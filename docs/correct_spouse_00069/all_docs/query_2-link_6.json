        "text": "Hong Kong celebrity couple Charlene Choi and Ronald Cheng are not just breaking up. They are ending their marriage, Tungstar reports.\n\nChoi and Cheng held a press conference over the weekend and admitted they have been married since 2006, but said a divorce was underway.\n\nThe couple announced earlier this month that they had not been together for a while, but denied they were married.\n\n\"We both thought getting married was our little secret, and we thought there was no need to let the public know,\" said Choi, who is a popular singer-actress. \"What we have found out is that entertainers have no secrets. Ronald and I are still friends, and I hope we both have happy futures.\"\n\nThe couple said the decision to break up was made because they now had a better understanding of each other, and there was not another person involved.\n\nChoi, 27, and Cheng, 38, were first spotted dating in 2004 after they collaborated on the comedy \"Hidden Heroes\"."
