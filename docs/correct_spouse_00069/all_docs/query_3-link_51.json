        "text": "Ending & Thoughts: Secret Door 2023\n\nIt’s been a while since I’ve seen a good thriller drama. But I don’t know if I would consider this a good one. There was way too many annoying characters in it.. like very few likeable ones. It got to the point I started rooting for the evil characters cause of how horrible everyone else is. Probably the first TVB drama I’ve watched where there’s so many characters that I hated.\n\nLuna’s mother in law definitely wins in the obnoxious, irritating character department. My goodness I just wanted her to die. Every time she shows up on screen I just wanted to fast forward. Literally you’re like so old already can’t she just chill out? She’s always so rude to Luna and so damn selfish. She played a huge role in Luna becoming evil. This old lady kept pushing too hard and wouldn’t let go of her. Every time Luna takes a step back even if it meant her putting aside her pride and dignity this grandma crushes it and gives no effs about it. This grandma is so convinced she killed her son, well lady if that’s what you think why don’t you SHUT UP? Aren’t you scared she will kill you too? And she tried to and let me tell you it was satisfying I wished she did die though. She actually convinced her son to not give his liver to his own daughter, Ching Ching even if it meant her niece dying. Manipulated her niece into thinking how awful of a Mom she is and tried to take her away. Luna even gave her the insurance money and agreed for all 3 to just live together, yet she wasn’t satisfied. She barely cared for Ching Ching back then and only shows care now cause she knows no one wants to take care of her selfish butt. So when she fell down the stairs, as bad as it sounds I was happy cause this woman is soo crazy like she actually installed a spy cam on Ching Ching jacket like wtf? Anyways I was very disappointed that she survived that fall, yes she is paralyzed and can’t talk anymore but like Ching Ching is still taking care of her and will for the rest of her life. In a twisted way the Grandma got what she wished for. She wanted Luna out of the picture and Ching Ching to always be by her side and well she got it.\n\nOne thing that gets me worked up is that Ching Ching, won’t ever really know that the only person who truly loved her is her Mother. She just thinks of her as a criminal who killed her Dad and paralyzed her Grandma. She doesn’t understand the reasoning. Now I get it murder is murder… people should never go down that road unless it’s out of self defence. But Luna did all of that cause she was pushed way over the edge. When she tried to seek psychiatric help and take medicine, the Grandma tried to use it against her to take away Ching Ching. The Dad didn’t want to give her liver to her Ching Ching, which meant her daughter could die while waiting for another donor. He also didn’t show a lot of care and wouldn’t even listen to Luna’s reasoning only saying how he wants to divorce her cause she is a daughter of a thief. But Ching Ching is too young to even realize that those two people caused so much pain to her Mother. So while Ching Ching thinks about the seemingly good memories she has with these 2 people, her Mother was coping with trauma from the harsh verbal abuse she suffered in that household.\n\nYip Siu Tin, damn his character was evil of the evil. He committed every crime possible. Yet I find his character more likeable then the Mother in law. Solely, because he talks shit and he knows it everyone else tries to play the victim too hard. This guy though always gets away with everything even in the end the police was never able to charge him with anything. Justice did not prevail for him, Luna in one final act decides to take him to the grave with her. And I loved how Luna was the one to do it, she always lived her life scared of him and the idea of becoming him. So for Luna to be the one to end it all was great. I do wish we got some last words from Yip Siu Tin, though he was irredeemable.. he had done way too many bad things and is not capable of being a good person. But I do wonder if for those last final moments of his life, while he watched his own daughter cut both of her wrists and wait for death.. did he wish he could save her? Now, Luna had stabbed him with a needle that temporarily causes him to be unable to move. But he can still see and hear what is happening, we also see him attempt to move his fingers when he saw Luna slowly lay down. So it just makes me think whether if he was able to get up, would he save Luna? Or is he that shit of a person he’d just get up and save himself? Would’ve been nice to hear an inner monologue from him at that moment.\n\nLuna was just overall a tragic character it’s like she never stood a chance at having a happy life. Her father was an abusive alcoholic who traumatized her childhood. She grows up having to hide her identity ends up marrying into a rich household BUT her husband and mother in law treated her like doormat. She was basically a second maid, no one really cared about her feelings. I’m confused why her husband even married her. Her father gets out of jail and looks for her immediately and right away restarts the abuse. Physical abuse from her father, verbal abuse from her husband and Mother in law. Her anxiety is crippling from trying to hide her past. Back then if she had embraced that she is a daughter of a thief things would’ve been so different. One thing for sure she should’ve chosen Zhong Zhi Kiu back then, as they had an understanding for one another. The tragedy of her character doesn’t sit well with me, cause she’s always been treated so badly I really wanted her to have a happy ending.\n\nYeung Yan Hiu, Roxanne Tong plays her and I noticed she got a lot of hate for her bad acting. But I didn’t see it that way at all, I just think people are so blinded at her annoying character they think it’s her acting. For real you guys are hating on someone cause of a damn character. Yan Hiu was so fudging annoying as well. All she did was follow Luna and especially Zhi Kiu around cause she has biased views that children of incarcerated parents are as evil as them. She would do mindless things to get in their way. And what makes it more annoying is that the one she should be investigating and stalking is Yip Siu Tin himself. Like she knows damn well he’s the criminal and the one who shot her Mother. But no let’s follow Zhi Kiu and Luna around cause she’s related to him like wtf? If Siu Tin was still in jail or dead I’d understand her investigating them but like bro he’s alive and well? How about you take yourself over there and try to find evidence instead? Why are you bothering the side characters when the mastermind that you know yourself is right in front of you?\n\nThat’s the thing with this drama, we all know Siu Tin is this undeniable villain the amount of horrible crimes he committed is scary. Yet, they focused more attention on catching others. The biggest example would be Zhi Kiu capturing Siu Tin and basically got him to admit some criminal things.. but even though he plotted this he didn’t record anything. But of course when he does this to Luna, he has a handy dandy recording device. LIKE LMAOOO are you serious??? Siu Tin has done some horrible stuff and has admitted to so many crimes in front of you and others but no one, NO ONE ever decides to film or record anything. Luna, did what she did cause of her deteriorating mental health cause of the effed up abuse she received practically all her life and opened up to you yet you were finally “smart” enough to record? I don’t know man, is it dumb or lazy writing?\n\nThe things I did like though was that Zhi Kiu’s Father was not a good man. All his life he believed his Father was forced into this and that he’s not all bad. But then we finally get video proof (which is stupid cause who would have such a clear video of something that happened 30 years ago + who on earth would hold on to this footage for so long only to release it now) that shows his Father pushing the pregnant lady onto the floor contrary to Zhi Kiu remembering it as him trying to “save” the lady. We also get another backstory that his Father is an awful wimp of a man. Only thing he did right was call up his old friend and ask him to take care of his son. It was nice that TVB decided for once to not twist the narrative of “oh he was actually a good man”, like nah he wasn’t a good person and the death was needed.\n\nThe ending wasn’t satisfying for me, I felt that it was too rushed and there were some questions left unanswered. Does Yan Hiu and Zhi Kiu end up together? How is Yan Hiu’s Father now? The randomness of Luna’s husband raising his insurance money was not explored… like did he do it out of his own free will? Definitely not a drama I would rewatch but it is the type of drama I won’t forget.\n\nEnding & Thoughts: The Forgotten Day\n\nI was highly looking forward to this drama. I really missed Roger Kwok & Shaun Tam has improved so much. And the theme is a thriller with comedic moments. With a total of 27 episodes which to me was a bad idea.\n\nThe Plot\n\nSo it’s mainly about Ng Yiu Chong (Roger Kwok) accidentally getting involved with the kidnapping of Ming Yat Yin (Shaun Tam). After Yat Yin is saved by his wife Freeya Yau (Grace Wong) who brought the ransom money & helped him escape he arrived home to his Dad Mung Kwan Sui (David Chiang) and in the span of 24 hours he argues with Freeya which culminates her into leaving & then he develops amnesia. Hence the forgotten day. Interesting storyline but it had too many filler episodes. The biggest plot line would be about what happened to Freeya? Where did she go? Why did she leave? And of course is she even alive? Unfortunately, they dragged it out so long that it got super boring & my patience was running out.\n\nThe beginning episodes were fun to watch as Yiu Chong tries so hard to not let Yat Yin know he was also involved with the kidnapping.\n\nFrom episodes 1-10 it’s been pretty good as they set up the story but episodes 11- 23 were pretty tragic. Tragic as in pointless. We get tidbits of what possibly happened to Freeya but every time we learn something new the main villain Ye Wan Sze (Max Cheung) seemingly spoils it. & we start back at zero. It was honestly frustrating watching every episode cause at that point I only cared about what happened to Freeya. I don’t care about whether Yiu Chong & his ex wife Maya Sze (Zoie Tam) get back together or not (only cause it got draggy). I also don’t care about Yat Yins younger sister Siu Dous (Lisa Lau) random romantic storyline. Or even the pointless character of Nam Hoi Ching (Roxanne Tong). Literally the mystery of Freeya was what kept me going!\n\nThe Plot Twist\n\nIt really should’ve been 20 episodes, the filler storylines was just too much. It’s a pity cause from episode 24 onwards it gets real thrilling with a lot of plot twists. Episode 24 is when we finally find out that Freeya has indeed been dead the whole time. I was sad. Even though her dying made the most sense. I still secretly wished that maybe she was kidnapped & hidden somewhere. Ye Wan Sze whose literally been sketchy the whole friggin time turned out to be completely innocent of the crime. He was only involved with kidnapping Yat Yin, stealing & entrapping one of the kidnappers. I was actually so shocked that he was innocent. What a great fake out that the writers wrote in. I was so convinced he hid or murdered Freeya. But nope. All those time where the plan towards finding Freeya is spoiled, he just happened to be around.\n\nNow I knew Yat Yin’s Dad is not innocent. Namely, cause he’s always acting weird. As in he doesn’t want to talk about kidnapping. Doesn’t want to go to the police about it. So I thought he was probably behind the kidnapping. But nope he has another ulterior motive. & that was Yat Yin was the one that caused Freeya’s death. It was pretty surprising for me at first. Cause my mind was just racking around it either being Ye Wan Sze, or Yiu Chongs sister Shun Mei (Elvina Kong). Mostly because Yat Yin dreamt him killing Freeya. After that part it spoiled it. That happened in episode 25. There’s still 2 episodes left, so it really spoiled it. The reveal would’ve been better if it had happened at 27. Because after he dreamt it in episode 25 it all made sense. Why his Dad is always persuading him to leave Hong Kong. Him telling Yat Yin to divorce his wife. Why he’s against him investigating in Freeya. But cause he dreamt it so early, what happens afterwards in 26 & 27 was no longer a surprise & we could easily interpret what happened.\n\nAnd it was correct. He did chase Freeya down demanding for the money back (as he believes she took the money to leave with another man). As he chases her down he accidentally causes Freeya to fall down a dangerous slope hill & she dies. His Dad who followed from behind sees what happens & tries to cover up the crime. So it all became too predictable after that. Despite that it was written really well. I never suspected Yat Yin to be the one. Though he made the most sense since he randomly got amnesia after she went missing. But I was sooo focused on the other red herrings I forgot about him. Bravo. Very well done.\n\nThe Characters\n\nBoy. This drama had way to many unnecessary characters. But first things first. TVB DID GRACE WONG SO WRONG. Why the eff did you name her the female lead & put her so high up in the poster when she barely gets 5 episodes of screentime in a 27 episode drama?? I knew this would be a male dominated drama but this was way too extreme. Like why? She appears semi prominently in the first 2-3 episodes and then after that just flashbacks. & most of the flashbacks are just rehash of the scenes we saw in the first couple of episodes! She can’t even be considered a “special guest star” because the amount she appeared was so pathetic. They could’ve literally casted some random newbie actress instead of wasting her time.\n\nFreeya was such a tragic character though. She dearly loves her husband & does everything she can for him. She has thrown tantrums here and there but it was only to get Yat Yin’s attention. I’m so upset that they were convinced that she had an affair with another man & believes she took the money & ran. The fact Yat Yin believed it pisses me off. First of all, if she planned on running away with a man why should she risk her life to pay the ransom & save you? She literally could’ve used that time to take the money and run while everyone else is distracted. Secondly, the money that was taken out for ransom was the money she & Yat Yin saved. If she was selfish she wouldn’t have used that money. Third of all, how can you not tell how much she loved you? After all those years you actually can’t trust your wife at all? Freeya disappeared for 2 months & those 2 months she was painted as a money hungry adulteress. It’s ironic cause in these 2 months Yat Yin ends up having a one night stand with Hoi Ching. So in the end he’s the one that wasn’t faithful. She literally died cause she wanted to protect the only savings left she has with her husband. & the fact it was her own husband that helped cause her death is crushing. Her death was an accident as it was raining & she slipped but if Yat Yin had trusted her & actually listened to her this whole incident wouldn’t have happened. Justice for Freeya please.\n\nThe second female lead is played by Roxanne unfortunately she also barely got any screentime. What is with TVB and naming the 2 female leads as female leads when they really aren’t? Hoi Ching was such an unneeded character as well. Since she’s a therapist, I thought she would be the key to unlocking Yat Yin’s lost memories. But nope she didn’t. She wasn’t helpful at all except for the time she suggested to him to hire a private investigator. She was only there as a one sided love interest to Yat Yin. And that random one night stand was so dumb. What was the whole point of that? They don’t end up together & honestly her character sorta just disappeared towards the end & we don’t even know what happened to her. Her crush towards Yat Yin never solidified into anything. And the one night stand just leaves a bitter taste as she knows he isn’t over Freeya so she kinda took advantage of the moment. You can remove her character and it would not effect the storyline at all.\n\nSiu Dou is the true female lead. She got the most screentime with her boring & unnecessary love line with a veterinary doctor. Her storyline never even connected with the main one. Her only connection was just being the sister of Yat Yin. She was only used to fill up the episode quota. The amount of times I’ve banged my head cause I had to sit through watching romance counterpart was deadly. Like it’s nice to see her struggle with her insecurity of being born with a birthmark and all. But I didn’t choose to watch this drama for her love line.\n\nMaya also got way more screentime then the so called female leads. Sadly, her character was also annoying. She’s always just yelling at Yiu Chong. & Yiu Chong is not much better he’s always pestering her to get back together. And not taking no for an answer. I can’t blame her for not wanting to get back together with him since he’s always lying to her & gambled away their savings. And even though I liked them together as a couple the “will they or won’t they” get back together storyline was prolonged for way too long. And the appearance of the doctor who fell for Maya was so cringy. I even thought the doctor had something to do with Freeyas disappearance cause it was just so random how a smart rich doctor, fell for a soon to be divorced lady who has a husband following her around & a son that she shares with said husband. & remember this plot literally takes place within the 2 months Freeya went missing. & by then the doctor wants to PROPOSE?? Man they dated for like one month tops and he wants to propose? THE DIVORCE AINT EVEN FINALIZED YET. I felt icky whenever they show the doctor & Maya together cause it felt way too forced. And the doctor got way more screentime then needed. It took Maya too long to realize that she still wanted to be with Yiu Chong. I liked that they got back together as he only ever loved her & Maya never got over him she just wanted to move on with her life. It would’ve been nicer if they had Yiu Chong finally get a stable job & show Maya that he has changed and then finally get together.\n\nThe only female character that made the most sense & actually central to the story was Shun Mei. Cause she’s Ye Wan Sze ex wife & she secretly got back together with him. But her character is dumb too. She’s always getting fooled by him. He was only using her as a cover & for money since she like worships him. Her character is also besties with Freeya. I started suspecting she might be involved with Freeya’s disappearance as well cause she was acting weird. On the night Freeya went missing she was “going around door to door” looking for Ye Wan Sze. She didn’t have an alibi & she was gone for an hour. When she & Yiu Chong find Freeya’s lost bag that had a hidden camera. She wanted to be the one to uncover the footage & she was against Yiu Chong in giving the hidden camera to the police. But I guess all that we’re just things the writers wrote to throw the audiences off or the 3 episodes they cut out would’ve explained more. But she’s completely innocent whose loyal to her brothers despite how dumb she is in love. The siblings love was very endearing to watch. & I really liked how she as the sister was always trying to protect them.\n\nYe Wan Sze is literally one smart criminal. He outsmarted sooo many people. I have to give it to him he played the villain pretty well. I was also impressed with despite how he’s money hungry he would never turn to murder. Like he’ll do anything illegal but murder. & he semi redeemed himself when he chose not to reveal Yiu Chong as one of the kidnappers. He also helped take the suspicions off of Yiu Chong & Shun Mei by revealing that the cellphone must’ve been planted by Yat Yin’s Dad. I mean he could’ve just said that cellphone was planted by them. It would’ve been easier to just blame solely Yiu Chong & them as they have the motive. I thought his character would be like “since I’m going down, I’m taking you down with me” but I guess he was touched by Shun Mei’s love in the end?\n\nThe fatherly love Kwan Sui had with Yat Yin was amazing. The amount of work he put in just to hide the truth because he knew it would crush him. He literally pretended to be Freeya & got rid of evidence so Yat Yin could move on. & when Yat Yin turned against him, he didn’t say a word. He just wanted Yat Yin to be safe & didn’t care about what happened to him. He even took the fall for Freeya’s death, just cause he couldn’t bear for Yat Yin to know & go to jail. Even in the end he told Yiu Chong to take Yat Yin away from Hong Kong cause he doesn’t want him to ever remember what happened that day.\n\nThe Ending\n\nI’m glad that in the end nobody died. Well other than Freeya which is so sad as she died trying to keep a bag of money that no longer had money in it. It could be cause I’m so used to people dying in these type of thriller dramas, I kept thinking “omg she’s gonna die next”. But nope I was wrong they all survived. No one ends up going to jail which is a bit unrealistic since Yat Yin’s Dad tried to hide the truth & got rid of evidence. I liked that Yat Yin was announced to not be the cause of Freeya’s death as it was considered accidental. And the cops couldn’t pin Yiu Chong down as one of the kidnappers as no one ratted him out? (I don’t really get it as one of the kidnappers did name him at first but when it got to trial he changed his statement & said he wasn’t involved). Maya realized she still loved Yiu Chong & seemingly gets back together with him. We don’t know what happened with Hoi Ching but my guess is she went separate ways with Yat Yin as he got his memories back & is still not over Freeya. It’s sad Hoi Chings character didn’t amount to anything & they didn’t talk about her at all. In the end she had a sorta relationship with Yat Yin so I’m surprised they didn’t address it at the end. But I also learned it was supposed to be 30 episodes but they cut out the last 3 so I guess in the midst of the editing of it, they decided it wasn’t important to include Hoi Ching in the epilogue. It ends with Yiu Chong & Yat Yin drinking coffee and saying how they will always be friends.\n\nOverall. It’s hard for me to say it was a bad drama or not. It was way too unnecessarily draggy & the fillers were soo annoying to watch. Freeya’s disappearance was dragged out to death. The last couple of episodes were so well done with the plot twist & reveal it was so great to watch. They really should’ve had it be 20 episodes. It would’ve been more action packed and thrilling. I say watch the first 10 episodes then skip to 23 cause you won’t miss out much & still get what happens.\n\nTVB KING & QUEEN WINNERS 2020\n\nLMAO. Man my predictions were wrong. Never did I think Sisley Choi would actually win. I thought at most she’d win in Malaysia or get Favourite Character award again. Also I had no idea Vincent Wong would actually win this year again. Nevermind the fact he won the most awards.\n\nOkay, so I know Sisley is getting a lot of hate from Hong Kong locals for her win. First, of all. Don’t blame her, blame management for making such a DUMB move again. They really did not learn from 2017 when she won Favourite Character. I’m always surprised by how much TVB likes her. She’s a rumour magnet (not her fault she just has a very outgoing personality). She technically lied about her education. And the local audiences in general don’t like her compared to past Miss HK winners. BUT. You have to give credit when it’s due & it’s the fact she has made immense improvements in her acting. Unfortunately TVB pushed her way too hard in dramas. People who support Sisley are mostly oversea fans. Who shows high favouritism. I remember how she was the most hated actress that TVB was promoting at the time. I’ve seen arguments like “TVB decided to give it to someone that actually had the best performance this year”. The thing is, I agree Mandy Wong didn’t perform well this year. But if we really give it based on “best performance”. Sisley still shouldn’t have won. She improved a lot in Legal Mavericks 2 & Line Walker 3 but it wasn’t anything impressive. People say she was amazing in LW3 but her screentime was reduced after episode 21. Her character was no longer important. And I mention that cause when Mandy was in that drama people praised her in the beginning especially at the elevator scene. And then everything went downhill for her too. So simply put I feel like they both gave similar performances. If we actually go by who acted the best Mandy Lam was super well liked & praised for her portrayal in Come Home Love: Lo & Behold. I know people found Selena Lee boring in Forensic Heroes 4, but the fact remains in she gave an amazing performance. People said she was able to speak clearly & pronounced forensic jargon smoothly & believable. Ali Lee resonated with audiences in Death By Zero. She was hilarious as Cash and people found her very memorable there. These actresses didn’t have “outstanding” acting this year either but they are lot more deserving then Sisleys role. Despite me liking Legal Mavericks 2, it did poorly ratings wise & it was barely talked about. Getting lots of votes from Mainlanders doesn’t mean much. Those votes can be faked & adding on to the fact LW3 aired in China which gives her an unfair advantage. So really. No Sisley didn’t win cause of her acting. She won due to TVB politics. Even when she received the award she didn’t look shocked or touched. I think it’s cause she knows deep down she shouldn’t be getting this & also cause she knows the amount of hate that is gonna get thrown her way now. People need to understand that Sisley has only been in the industry for 7 years. And in those 7 years she never had it bad. She’s always been leading in dramas or put into grand production. She never had to rough it like Nancy Wu, Tavia Yeung, Kristal Tin or even pageant winners like Myolie Wu etc did. She was given lots of opportunities and won so quick. Hence why she wasn’t emotional when she won. Which is not her fault. She has what it takes to be an actress & I am still looking forward to her future dramas. I just wished TVB didn’t have to be like this and promote her this way. She’s gonna continue to get unnecessary hate from this. And since she only won 7 years in, I can see her winning again for a second time in the near future. She has a long contract left & with the lack of talent at TVB it’s highly plausible. But I know one thing for sure, is when she does win it for the second time it will be deserving.\n\nVincent Wong has thoroughly confused me. He won so many awards. Best Actor & Best Drama in Malaysia & Hong Kong & Best Partnership. It was so awkward when he thanked Al Cappucino instead of Legal Mavericks 2. I wonder if he got confused or believes he should’ve won for Al Cappucino instead? Either way, I did not see this coming. I really thought Raymond Lam or Lau Dan. Vincent is an amazing actor but to win for Legal Mavericks 2? The same role he won for the first time? It makes it seem like he has no acting range. Since he has left TVB for Shaw, I believed TVB wouldn’t treat him so well still. Bosco Wong & Ron Ng also signed with Shaw and didn’t even get half the treatment he got. He’s also starting to focus more in the Mainland China market. And has vocally expressed it too. Is this TVBs way of guilting him to film more with them? He also did not have the best performance of the year. That would go to Wayne Lai & Moses Chan from Death By Zero. When that aired people were talking non stop about it. Eddie Cheung also killed it as a villian in Of Greeds and Ants. I feel like the winners won only cause they got recent bias from how their dramas are still fresh in their minds. Forensic Heroes 4 though was really badly written got the highest ratings & were not mentioned at all. Death By Zero was of course shafted. I guess TVB didn’t want Wayne to win a 4th time. And Moses doesn’t care about awards anymore so they didn’t bother with him sadly. Vincent works hard and is a good actor but I feel like he shouldn’t have won this year at all. Like I always knew Vincent was gonna win again but I didn’t think it was gonna be so soon. This year for Best Actor & Actress TVB only gave it to those they wanted & not to those who deserved it. I’m still confused on what even happened or what TVB was thinking though. At least Vincent winning won’t be as controversial compared to Sisley but I still feel like it was very unnecessary of them to do.\n\nSide opinions but... SUPER HAPPY Angel Chiang won Most Improved. It’s been soooo long since someone deserving actually won it. Like it got to the point that Most Improved became more of a Miss Hong Kong award judging by how much won it in the past. Angel Chiang has shown major improvements & this award belonged to her. I also thought Winki Lai winning was also nice. Her acting is great & has always worked so hard. Yoyo Chen was also another actress I wouldn’t mind winning. Brian Chu winning isn’t bad but shocked they didn’t give it to Brian Tse or Joey Law since TVB seems to be more interested in promoting them. Also glad Hubert Wu won for the song portion. Hana Kuk keeps winning and it’s gets annoying. Obviously Hana is winning if TVB keeps assigning songs only to her. I feel like Best Partnership should be given to Priscilla Wong, Shiga Lin & Yoyo Chen. When Life After Death was airing everyone was in love with their friendship. It’s also so hard for TVB writers to be able to to write such a great friendship between woman. It’s always about bromance and womance is ignored. Their strong loyal ship between each other was amazing in that drama. And I hate how this drama was also ignored in the awards show. It looks like Sisley Choi winning is gonna go down in history along with Natalie Tong for worst BA winners. Vincent Wong might also go down as the “randomness winner” along with Wayne Lai when he won for the 3rd time in Forensic Heroes 3.\n\nTVB King & Queen Speculations 2020\n\nThis year has got to be the saddest year yet. There is NO NOISE. Like usually we get like a couple of dramas where we can guess the winner from. This year not really. They can barely hype up any actresses on the female side cause it’s so weak. I feel like it was a dumb mistake on TVB for choosing to not air Shadows of Justice & Chinatown or even Armed Reaction 5. Everyone got nominated this year and the females side is even more saturated. For males there’s a total of 24 nominations while for females there’s only 18. And to make it even more sad 3 of the female nominees is from a sitcom! Mandy Lam is supporting at most in that drama, she’s not even part of the main core family. The fact TVB added in Mandy, & Koni Lui shows how desperate they were. (That doesn’t mean they suck at acting but cause TVB has no plans on promoting them & only added them in to fill the ballots). I don’t even really know where to begin? There isn’t a real popular candidate. I’m only naming the ones that I think might have the chance on winning & ones I like in general.\n\nIf we’re gonna talk about popular characters Angel Chiang as Shui Jie is a standout. Willie Wai as Ah Fan was loudly applauded. Samantha Ko was praised as Chong Ming Lai. Brian Tse scared the audience as Parker. Yoyo Chen was really likeable as Sabrina. And I think that’s about it. I really like how it’s mostly supporting actors & actresses that are largely praised. It shows that they outperformed the leading actors & actresses. But out of this batch who will actually walk away with an award?\n\nTVB KING\n\nRaymond Lam. It would be overdue for him to finally win. I’ve always liked his role of Bao Seed fun to get along with & loyal. But his reduced screentime to promote Owen Cheung was a setback for his character. His character also didn’t get real development and his backstory was quite meaningless with a secret son. His character matured for sure but the storyline went nowhere. His son never finds out he is the real father & he basically hates him. His first love passes away & honestly he never got closure for it. He didn’t get to see her last moments before she died. I guess him winning would depend on if he comes to the award show or not. He has the biggest chance winning this year with good acting & a big fan base to vote for him. But also if he wins it would be because he was snubbed before like Mandy Wong. Him winning would be making up for past years where he should’ve won. The media strangely isn’t hyping him up to win this year.\n\nLau Dan. For his sitcom role in Come Home Love: Lo and Behold. If he were to win it wouldn’t be controversial, so he would be TVBs safe bet in winning. I know I poked fun out of Mandy & Koni for being nominated but it’s different with him. He’s been acting for a way longer time, has a great relationship with TVB & at this point audiences favourite grandpa. Awarding him would be out of gratitude for his loyalty. But performance and character wise he is pretty generic. Will TVB actually award him? I would consider him a dark horse in winning.\n\nVincent Wong has left TVB and the role he is nominated for is Legal Mavericks 2, which didn’t do well in Hong Kong. Vincent already won for this role back in 2017, so chances of him winning again is low. He should’ve been nominated for his role Al Cappucino. His acting there was more memorable especially the way he portrayed his method acting. I still remember the nervousness I got when he seemingly turned evil. Judging by how he didn’t appear at all in the TVB Anniversary, sort of shows his standing in TVB. At least Nancy Wu was featured in a pre- recorded game but Vincent none. He has the acting chops and honestly doesn’t need another award to prove how good of an actor he is.\n\nShaun Tam. Brutally Young was an amazing watch and I’m sad that the ratings were average, despite it being such a thrilling show. He was also in Forensic Heroes 4 but he was literally a block of wood there. So I’m glad he wasn’t nominated for that drama. Obviously TVB has huge plans for him to win Best Actor. But it’s not gonna be for this year. He still needs improvement in emoting more and I’m looking forward to his dramas in 2021.\n\nWillie Wai. I already know he isn’t gonna win. But I felt like writing him in this because honestly he was highly praised when The Witness was airing. His acting there was amazing and it was a great portrayal that a lot of people including me are rooting for him to win. But his chances are super low. He was only in this drama cause they couldn’t find someone else to partner with Him Law. I feel like it would be such a huge win if TVB decides to award it to him. But I’d be honestly happy if Raymond or Lau Dan won instead as well. I hope TVB will give him more big roles.\n\nOwen Cheung, I loved his role as Ko Ban in Al Cappucino, so good for TVB for nominating him in that role instead. But he’s still not well liked by audiences (sorta me included). I like Ko Ban but all the other roles he was in like, in Airport Strikers & Line Walker 3, he was either annoying or just not likeable in general. I am more critical on him but mostly cause the way TVB is promoting him bothers me. And I don’t like how he keeps getting “hot guy” roles when he’s not suited for them. Comedy is where he should stay. TVB is heavily promoting him, so are they gonna bite the bullet and award him with Favourite Character award similar to how Sisley Choi won in 2017? But there was a huge backlash so do they really wanna go through that again? Well either way we will be seeing more of him in general.\n\nTVB QUEEN\n\nKaty Kung was hyped up before and during the airing of Death by Zero. But that failed as despite her amazing transformation, the character itself wasn’t that great. And even though she’s considered one of the main leads she didn’t have that much screentime compared to the others. Her character in Hong Kong Love Story is more likeable but unfortunately, though her acting was great. The character itself was nothing special. She might win Best Actress in Malaysia. As she is very popular there and it could be a way of TVB paving the way for her to win in the future. Like with Ali Lee when she won Best Actress as Never Wong at the Starhub Awards in 2017. Some people say she can’t win cause she was nominated in Death By Zero where’s she not the leading lady... I guess these people forgot that Natalie Tong won in 2017 with My Unfair Lady where she played Cherry the designated second lead LOL!\n\nSamantha Ko, is also talked about. She had 4 dramas that aired this year. Her leading dramas were Operation C9 and On-lie Game. I personally don’t think she’s leading in OLG since Hera Chan clearly had more screentime. And obviously that drama was used to promote Hera and she’s just the camouflage. But anyways. Out of the dramas she’s in her most popular role would be Chong Ming Lai from Al Cappucino which she was great in. She was super well liked but unfortunately cause TVB decided to air her dramas back to back people got tired of her. I believe if the last drama that aired was her role in AC there would’ve been a higher chance of her winning. Now people have just forgotten her performance there and only focused on OC9 which was filmed 2 years ago. I think she’s gonna make it into the top 5, but I don’t think she’s gonna win. Her chances also seem slim next year, as she has less dramas and no leading roles. I can only hope TVB continues to promote her as she has potential.\n\nMandy Wong has the highest chance of winning this year. And she always gives out great performances but I find that recently she’s been losing steam. As in she doesn’t have as much passion as she once did. I don’t know if it’s cause TVB is overworking her but it’s a pity. But honestly all the characters she played this year were so bland. Like she doesn’t have much to work with. And that’s not her fault. She doesn’t pick the roles, they were given to her. I bet 100% if she had played a likeable role people would vote for her to be TVB Queen. But that’s not the case. She’s one of the better actress out of the batches here. Too bad her roles are repetitive and if she wins this year it wouldn’t be considered a hard earned win. It would be more of a makeup award for not winning with Threesome in 2018.\n\nPriscilla Wong. She has made some good improvements in acting since we last saw her. Her crying scenes are better now. And even though her performance in Life and Death was a wonderful surprise. I feel like it’s still not really enough for her to win this year. She still hasn’t portrayed a memorable character yet. Ratman did not do well ratings wise and her screentime was pretty small in Line Walker 3. I wouldn’t mind her winning though as the selection this year is pretty small. And so far no huge competition. And despite what people say TVB has always treated her well. And if she doesn’t win this year it will purely be because she doesn’t have a stand-out character. But if she were to win it would be out of gratitude for the years she stayed at TVB.\n\nSisley Choi. It’s been a while since I’ve seen a Miss Hong Kong make such a vast improvement. I kid you not she was literally one of the most hated actresses at TVB at one point. Her acting was so raw and terrible. She had no voice control and all around bad. I didn’t have high hopes for her. But she proved me wrong. She worked hard, learned to control the tone of her voice. Attended TVB acting class and now she’s building a good fan base. She made a 180 degree turn and I’m proud of her. Ah Dou wasn’t that great of a character in Line Walker 3. So she would have to rely on Legal Mavericks 2 which is unfortunately not doing well ratings wise. I feel like she would be a dark horse in winning. Just like how she won in Favourite Character 2017. But if she does win it will definitely be controversial. Din Jeh for LM2 is likeable but at the same time not popular enough for her to win. There’s a reason why she got such a huge backlash when she won in 2017. Maybe this year will be different?\n\nSelena Lee. At first I didn’t want to put her in the running since she won an award last year & she has left TVB. Her last drama was Forensic Heroes 4 but that aired in February and a lot of people have forgotten about it. Her acting there were largely praised and her character was well liked. She was able to fluently speak medical jargon in both Chinese & English very well. But it wasn’t until she was nominated for the Asian TV Awards that her name got thrown in the mix. So now she has a real chance of winning again. There’s a renewed interest in her and TVB might want to award her so they can stake the claim of her being the first Asian Tv Winner as a TVB actress. (She might not even win there but TVB likes the idea of it) Shes also back at TVB filming Barrack O’Karma 2. Her acting has always been great and I can’t find any negatives about her. I think if she wins she wouldn’t draw as much criticisms compared to the other ones nominated for sure though.\n\nOther Thoughts\n\nI have seen some comments made online about how Mandy and Selena are “passed” their prime and that they don’t deserve to win anymore. That they should “focus” on the new generations cause it’s not “fair” to award the older ones when the younger ones are better. Okay. First of all the younger ones you’re talking about DOES NOT have a representative role yet. At most I guess Sisley Choi for Din Jeh from Legal Mavericks 2 but I don’t count that. She may have won Favourite Actress but it was only due to TVB politics & nothing to do with leaving a memorable impression with the audience. In fact she was heavily criticized for her performance when it was airing. It was controversial for a reason in 2017. Mandy is known for Kwan Yee So from L’escargot & Evie Fong from Threesome. Selena Lee is known for Michelle Chang from Blood and Water & Alex/Coco from Barrack O’Karma. They all have well known works. Kwan Yee So is still talked about today. And Selena literally garnered awards and huge nominations from her works. You’re really gonna compare them to these new actresses that have yet to portray a well known role? Not to mention Sisley and Priscilla has an upper hand in being pushed up by executives. They were given more chances in the sense of being involved in more grand productions and landing leading roles faster. So I think it’s more unfair that you want to shove them aside cause “if they didn’t win then, they shouldn’t win now”. Them not winning TVB Queen yet doesn’t mean they’re not good enough. It just means they had tough competition. Also do they not realize they weren’t given huge opportunities compared to the other batch. Mandy didn’t get a leading role until 2017. She wasn’t promoted right away and actually had to work from supporting up. Selena was always put into low budget dramas. No one imagined that Barrack O’Karma would turn into such a big hit. If TVB had known, heck no would they have given it to Selena. She only got the lead in FH4 cause TVB wanted her to sign a new contract with them after her popularity rose. I also want to point out the hate is towards the females and not the males. Cause for some reason male actors get a free pass in this?\n\nHave they not noticed that TVB has not always given an award based on “performance” of the year? Cause they do it randomly. Do you really think Kenneth Ma deserved to win last year? Natalie Tong in 2017? Joe Ma in 2018? Nancy Wu in 2015? Ali Lee in 2018? Dayo Wong in 2013? These are all examples of them winning not cause of them having the best role but because of gratitude and cause they deserved it for other performances but they’re winning now instead. If Mandy were to win this year it would be because of her previous good performance. And frankly from the actresses list above Mandy and Selena would be the only ones that are actually deserving. They might not have a huge fan base compared to the others but they have given solid performances before. I would also put Priscilla third as she does have higher potential.\n\nI guess what I’m trying to say is don’t write people off just cause you think the newer one deserves it more. Honestly the awards aren’t even as prestigious as it used to be. Everyone is literally taking turns on winning. No one said anything when Kenneth or Joe won despite the fact their role wasn’t anything special. People were literally saying “finally he won” & “it was a long overdue win” & “about time he won”. Yet just the idea of Mandy maybe winning this year has caused people to get pissed cause she didn’t have the best performance? It’s unfair and wrong to be so critical for the female side but not the males. If you’re gonna shit on Mandy for her potential win, you should also be shitting on Raymond or Lau Dan for it too. I don’t mind them winning cause they’re both good actors that just wasn’t given a role that had enough material to garner a huge win this year. But their past performances show they have what it takes. Thankfully these criticisms towards Mandy are mainly from the international audience and not Hong Kong locals. It’s actually outrageous to me how much hate Mandy gets just cause they think Sisley or Priscilla should get it instead. For Mandy if she wins it’s cause it’s rigged, for the male side if Raymond wins it’s long overdue? Why is that same energy not put towards the male side? So haters, if Mandy does win remember to also write about how much you hate [insert male actor name here] for winning too as there wasn’t a huge standout performance from that side either this year. End of rant.\n\nEnding & Thoughts: Legal Mavericks 2020\n\nInitial Thoughts\n\nWhen the first drama came out, I was one of the few people that wasn’t obsessed with it. I mean it was good and I like the message but I wasn’t as into it as everyone else. The bromance between Vincent & Owen wasn’t that great of a watch. And the cases weren’t as interesting. So when I went into watching the sequel, I didn’t have much expectations. Also cause sequels tend to not be as good, example Line Walker 3 wasn’t the best sequel. But this sequel proved me wrong. It was waaay more enjoyable then the first one.\n\nPlot & Characters\n\nHope Man (Vincent Wong) is a blind barrister that works together with Gogo Kuk (Owen Cheung) a former police turned private detective & Deen Jie (Sisley Choi) who is Hopes legal executive. Together they solve various cases and uncover the justice behind it. New cast members included Eva Shaw (Kelly Cheung) a rival barrister, Kan Siu Wang (Pail Chun) Hopes former Master that mentored him. Kwok Lam (Jessica Kan) Hopes new apprentice & Kong Bo Chai (Lesley Chiang) an inspector police were both fun new additions to the cast.\n\nFor most direct sequels there are very rare instances where I would like the new cast additions. For example The Exorcists Meter 2.0 I hated all the new additions to the cast. But for this sequel, I like all of them - well most. For some people they believe Bo Chai & Kwok Lam were unnecessary but I find that they were a nice comic relief (with the bickering) and Bo Chai was needed since she was a police they were able to solve more cases with her help. Kwok Lam though she was born rich, she has a strong sense of justice & she would even go against her Father to pursue it. Kan Siu Wang shocked me with how he’s not as evil as you’d think. You would think he would be the ultimate boss that Hope needs to defeat but that’s not it. He likes power and money but he also knows there’s fine line between black & white.\n\nNow, here comes my least favourite character which is Eva Shaw. And I’m sure anyone can guess why. Cause she is a Never Wong (Ali Lee) replacement. When I say replacement, I don’t mean she just takes over the empty spot & becomes the mandatory new love interest. No I mean. She is the new Never Wong. She dresses sexily, basically the same attitude & personality, strong sense of justice, falls deeply in love with Hope only to end up with Gogo. Like really? She’s literally a carbon copy. And I’m so disappointed that they decided to go down this route. They even had her dance in the rain with Hope too. Like can’t you be anymore original? Only difference is she doesn’t die. She’s also more annoying cause she’s always changing her mind. One moment she’s on her masters side but then the next moment she’s on Hopes side. Like can you just give a stable standing and stay loyal? Cause I’m exhausted with you going back & forth. She becomes more likeable as the series goes on but it was hard for me to warm up as she was just too similar to Never.\n\nThe Cases\n\nThe cases were very fun & interesting to watch. The director also has said that these cases are based on real circumstances and brings in the human side. Which rings true. The case of the “Heart Stealer” & “Fast Food Restaurant Refugee Murder” were both cases that brought a tear to my eye. For the former, it was touching to see how a mother would give up her heart just to ensure her son could live the rest of his life with no worries. The helplessness she felt and also knowing how in real life, cases like that could happen. At times like this the rich would win as they have the time & money. A lot of people think that those that always hang around 24 hours food places are gross & homeless. This case shows to not judge someone by their cover. Everyone has a backstory. The bond these group of people had for each other was eye opening. I was so sad when it showed the flashback of them singing & just enjoying each other’s company. You just feel so bad for them. I don’t want to say too much cause I don’t want to spoil to much of this case. The case of the “Silent Witness” & “Beyond Man and Woman” had good plot twists that I did not see coming. On the cover it sounded like boring cases but the background story to it ended up being surprising to watch.\n\nThe Romance\n\nA lot of people didn’t like how in the sequel Hope & Yanice Tai (Tracy Chu) relationship became a central storyline despite Yanice passing away in the first. I personally actually liked it & didn’t find it draggy. It could be because I love Tracy as an actress. It could be because I find Hope & Yanice to be an amazing couple with a tragic love story. In this case I just find their story unfinished. As in, I never truly understood why Hope would give up Yanice. He could’ve went with Yanice instead of staying behind in Hong Kong. They’ve been through so much only for him to give it up, it always left a sour taste in my mouth. In this sequel we see him deal with the guilt & anguish to finally letting go and moving on. It also intercepted with another case so it was not random. I thought it was a nice touch for the writers to write in about her developing a tumour in her brain. Because from that she decided to pre- record a message to Hope. So we get to hear her last words & get a final wrap up in the story.\n\nHope & Deen Jie is odd to me. Like I’m aware that Deen Jie has a crush on him. But in this sequel she was possessive that it was uncomfortable in some parts. Hope has shown over & over again that he has no interest. Yet she’s still stuck on him. Towards the end they have a fall out because she thought Hope had heartlessly kicked her out of his firm & withheld her Fathers illness from her. She finds out later on it was cause of her Fathers order that he did that but she was still bitter. In the end she admits she was angry not cause of her Father but because she had believed he had fallen for Eva. So she was bitter out of jealousy. This part bothered me to no end. They are not dating. She knows he doesn’t like her. He never led her on, from day one he has said he only has Yanice & that he couldn’t move on. So I guess the idea that he has fallen in love again but not with her triggered her pettiness. It got to the point where she battled him in court with her helping a scumbag rapist just to spite him. Like girl, what happened to helping the helpless & doing what’s right? You threw that away for a guy? Like in the end she does the right thing but that was annoying. I would’ve enjoyed the development of Hope & Deen Jie’s love story if they hadn’t made her so petty and possessive. So for me, no I don’t like them together as a couple but enjoyed them more as friends. If anything I thought if Hope couldn’t end up with Yanice, Eva would’ve been nice. But they did a bait & switch. In the beginning they heavily made it seem that Hope would end up with Eva while Deen Jie would end up with Gogo. That was a weird but interesting twist though. I haven’t seen another drama where they would change up the love interest like that.\n\nGogo has always been a very casual guy so for him to end up with Eva was also odd to me. Eva has a glamorous, mature feel so I don’t find them a matching couple. But opposites attract in this case. I also thought they had no chemistry whatsoever. Eva was never interested in Gogo dispite him always flirting. She only liked Hope, it just looks like she settled for him out of the blue. I actually prefer Gogo with Bo Chai instead. They had better chemistry and he abruptly ended the relationship with Bo Chai that made her never get over him. I hated how he used her love for him to do things as a cop she shouldn’t be doing. They were engaged and he dumped her over the phone while she was trying on wedding dresses. He never ever sincerely apologized for that & he got over her so quickly. So I guess it’s good they didn’t end up together, he doesn’t deserve a good person like her. Bo Chai also never got real closure from it & her character sorta disappears towards the last episode. Gogo was also in a relationship with Never until it ended with her dying. So for him to end up with Eva whose a replica of Never just irks me.\n\nThe Good\n\nI throughly loved Paul’s betrayal. And I also liked how instead of making him a full out villain they made him a man that knows a line that should not be crossed. He has helped bad people but in the end he was able to see the difference between good & bad. He sent one of the innocent accused to jail but he was also the one that ultimately set him free. He stole Deen Jie away from Hope but only cause he saw potential in her & knew she had way it takes to be a good barrister. He set up Deen Jie to battle with Hope not to spite him but because he knew doing this would help Deen Jie. So it’s like ultimately he’s not as bad as they portrayed him. In the end Hope even calls him Master again. I thought in the end there would be a huge showdown between Hope and him with the latter ending up in jail or something. So it was great spin to have him coming out as a semi- hero (for helping them patch things up between Hope & Deen Jie). It was unpredictable and enjoyable to see this instead.\n\nThe sequel is more case driven and I’m glad cause that’s what it made it more interesting. The first one focused more on Hopes journey to finding himself & rebuilding his relationship with his Father that left him when he turned blind (which I understand). Also talked more about friendship and focused solely on one evil villain. So the first one fell flat for me.\n\nThe Bad\n\nI didn’t like how Hope was always in court battling the same people it’s either Eva, his Master and then Walter Wah (Hugo Wong) who is the same character from the first drama. I guess that’s TVBs way of staying in a budget instead of hiring new people to play different barristers.\n\nIt was disappointing to see Deen Jie fix her buck tooth & change her appearance so drastically. What I liked about her is how she didn’t care about the way she looked and that the heart is what matters. In the first drama Never had asked her why she doesn’t fix her teeth since she has the money. And she said she didn’t find it necessary & the inside is more important than her appearance. So for her to change the way she looked for Hope was just sighhh. But I guess the writers want the main couple to “look good”. I wonder if they always had Deen Jie become the main love interest in mind when they wrote the first one.\n\nI also did not like how they had a cliffhanger ending. It ends with Deen Jie getting stabbed in the neck & in a coma. And of course Hope slowly coming into terms that he has fallen for Deen Jie. They did it cause they are potentially writing another sequel in collaboration with China. But with Vincent leaving TVB & the lacklustre ratings, I don’t know if it’s gonna happen anymore. But seeing how things turn out Deen Jie will probably end up with amnesia or something cause their love line will not run so smoothly. But if a sequel doesn’t happen, I can just pretend that ending did not happen and that Deen Jie is back working at his firm together solving crimes.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEveryone was great but I didn’t find any standouts. Vincent reprisal as a blind barrister is still amazing but I don’t see TVB awarding him Best Actor for the same role twice. Also he didn’t show up to the TVB Anniversary Gala which sorta shows his standing with TVB. Sisley improved for sure but I wouldn’t say she’s Best Actress material yet, it was nice to see her become the antagonist though. Kelly was nice & stable as usual. And Owen Cheung just stayed the same, nothing new was brought to the table at all. And weird enough the bromance between Hope & Gogo wasn’t as fun to watch compared to Al Cappucinos Cheung Sai Lung & Ko Ban. Here they just seemed like good friends instead of “brothers”.\n\nI see a lot of comments about Sisley being a huge standout. And I agree with how much she has improved but I still think she still has a lot to learn. I admit her turn as the antagonist was interesting to watch but it wasn’t as great as they say. She isn’t loud acting anymore that’s for sure. But at the same time TVB is running out of actresses so I wouldn’t mind her winning so quickly.\n\nIt was lovely to see Tracy come back in a voice role. The directors had invited her back to film but she rejected the role. I wished she had accepted as it could’ve been her goodbye role since it seems she has no interest in continuing acting. She’s only doing ads & photo shoots as she slowly transitions to becoming a full time lawyer. I wouldn’t say a pity as though she’s a talented actress, becoming a lawyer is more stable. And she got married with her childhood sweetheart. I’m so happy for her but also sad as I will miss her acting. But I can always re-watch Over Run Over.\n\nThis was a better sequel then I have seen in years. Line Walker 3: Bull Fight just wasn’t as great compared to this. The Exorcists Meter 2.0 was also a downer. The plot twists in the cases and heartfelt stories made the drama all the more memorable. It’s turning out to be a great year for TVB drama watchers like me. Death by Zero, Brutally Young, Al Cappucino were standouts this year. While this drama, Line Walker 3 & The Witness do not fall far behind.\n\nSide note: but what’s with the characters name? They’re all so strange. Man San Hap full English name Hope Man. I know it’s a play on for justice hero but dang it’s cringy. Then theres Santiago Kuk nicknamed Gogo. Like for real whyyyy. I hate that so much. “Hey Gogo hows it going”. “Gogo, I love you” blergh. Then Never Wong. Are you kidding me? She’s a court judge who chose Never as her nickname? Cherry was fine!! I guess it’s play on for “never wrong” well in this case you were wrong for thinking Never was a good name choice! And they don’t even pronounce the “r” in Never. They say it like “Neva” and it bothers me for no reason. TVB English names tend to always be questionable and I don’t care if they try to play it off as a nickname (Flashbacks to Laughing Gor, Muse, Bingo, Saving, Cash, Fever that’s only to name a few) but this is the first drama where it has this many.\n\nEnding & Thoughts: The Witness\n\nI was pretty excited for this drama. And you might think I’m crazy since a lot of people thought airing this drama is a waste of a slot. And I get it they could’ve aired bigger dramas. Chances are TVB only aired it so Him Law could get a Best Actor Nomination which they need to fill out the quota for it. Or else it’s gonna end up being saturated with supporting actors from Come Home Love again like last year. But the premise of it is interesting! Instead of a Prince Charming protecting the gorgeous female witness (like all witness protection type dramas). We get a down on the luck rookie cop protecting a straight forward OCD guy. It’s a cute twist to it and the start of bromance.\n\nPlot\n\nAh Kei (Him Law) saves Ah Fan (Willie Wai) after he witnesses a murder. Ah Fan is placed in witness protection program but because of his strange personality that makes it hard to trust others he wouldn’t allow anyone but Ah Kei who saved his life to protect him. Ah Kei ends up living with Ah Fan to protect him. That’s how he gets entangled with Chris (Kelly Cheung) and end up falling in love. Ah Kei’s older sister Miss Ko (Pinky Cheung) gets involved by falling for Ah Fan. The main case of this drama is finding Ah Fans missing memories from years ago which is also connected with Ah Kei’s fathers death.\n\nThe drama is fun to watch. The acting was great from everyone. Kelly is still a bit stiff and has a slight accent but she was still super enjoyable to watch. But the storyline started to falter a bit. It got plagued with annoying side characters and the main leads themselves are dumbed down when the story started focusing more on the mystery behind the fathers death.\n\n- Annoying character #1 belongs to Kam Chi Sing (King Lam). I know every drama there has to be a rival. But boy, he’s just so annoying. All he cared about was getting a promotion. And always arguing with Ah Kei cause he’s such a proud guy that he’s always undermining him. Always getting in the way for Ah Kei to solve cases and he would bring up Ah Kei’s dead father just to rile him up. I’m so glad that even his followers under him stopped listening to him. That was such a good moment for him to realize everyone is tired of his shit and moved on from him. He was despicable from beginning to end. There was no redemption from him. His smirk is downright cocky.\n\n- Annoying character #2 goes to Ah Kei’s ex-girlfriend Yuki (Sammi Cheung). She’s always spending her time shopping which is how she always racks up her credit card debt. In which she decides to borrow money to pay it off. It causes loan sharks to chase after her & always needing Ah Kei’s help to solve it. Her character is infuriating. She lives with Ah Kei rent free, eats for free & has been with him for 10 years. Yet she goes and cheats on him. And when she gets caught she makes up a lie to get him to believe her. In the end when Ah Kei finds out the truth she blames him. WTH. She blames him for not caring about her enough & how she doesn’t defend her when her sister calls her out on things. Nevermind the fact that he’s always running around scraping for money to pay off your debt. Nevermind how he’s always treated you well despite your spending habits. It’s HIS FAULT that she ended up cheating. It’s disturbing that while she’s cheating she’s finding all these ways to hide it while still living with him. And when she witnessed something that could save Ah Fan from wrongly getting arrested she chooses to ignore it so she can continue her affair. Ugh. I hate cheaters especially ones that feign innocent and blames the other partner. Like own up to your wrong doings.\n\n- Annoying character #3 is given to Yip Cheung Lok (Lau Kong). He’s always flip flopping on his emotions. Years ago he finds out his son Gordon (Tsui Wing) was involved with a kidnapping- murder case. He decides to protect him by sending him to America. And years later when he finds out his son has done more horrible things like committing more murders. At first he’s like “I’m gonna call the cops, you’re going to jail” and then the next minute he shuts his mouth to protect his son. He’s always apologizing and trying to “fix” things which just made things worse. Instead of leaving Chun Po (Helen Ma) alone he instead tricks her to live with them. This is the reason why she died cause she kept spouting details about what happened in the past to Gordon. When he realized all the wrong doings of his son. He does nothing to stop it. I get it he’s sick in bed. But he was able to leave and walk. His son isn’t watching him 24/7. He could have easily picked up the phone and call Ah Fan to warn him about Gordon. He didn’t even have to call the cops to get Gordon arrested. The bare minimum for him to do would be at least try to stop Gordon from taking over Ah Fans fathers company. But he did nothing. In the end he died because his own son attacked him & basically left him to die. Sad but fitting end for him considering he’s the one that let his son spiral this out of control. Gordon committing the first crime could be a mistake, but committing a second and third? That’s no longer a mistake but a choice.\n\nThe Love Triangle\n\nPretty annoying. Chris and Ah Kei has cute chemistry. And I really like how it developed they saw each other in a different light. I was disappointed that they dragged out the triangle though. Ah Kei bothered me with how he handled Yuki. I understand that you dated Yuki for 10 years so it’s hard for him to just abandon her. But really? Letting Yuki live with you while dating Chris? Anyone would be pissed. Chris has the right to get mad. Yuki & Ah Kei didn’t have a amicable breakup she cheated and threw a fit about how she’s right and he’s wrong. The next time they saw each other she slaps Ah Kei believing he assaulted her new boyfriend. Yuki girl. You dated Ah Kei for 10 years and you’d rather believe your new boy toy then the guy that stood by you all these years? This is an example of why Ah Kei doesn’t need to go that far to help Yuki. Ah Kei is so oblivious to how Yuki is trying to break apart his relationship with Chris. She sabotaged almost all their dates. I thought Yuki would redeem herself wholly once she realized how much Ah Kei loved Chris but instead she runs to find a Chris & demands her to leave him and stop stringing him along. Then they try to redeem Yuki by having her do the bare minimum to help Chris find Ah Kei. In the end they become good friends which I find unnecessary. I rather have it end with them bumping into each other & wishing each other well. Yuki has made one too many mistakes to earn the right to stay in their lives.\n\nThe Randomness\n\nApart from the annoying characters & love triangle. The character development of Ah Fan went downhill. Ah Fan goes through three amnesiac phases. And the first two involved him forgetting what happened during specific time periods. The third one, he forgets his sister and his friends including Ah Kei & Miss Ko. Now at first it was endearing of him trying to re-learn his past but then it turns awful when he gets used by Gordon. Which I don’t understand. Miss Ko lies to him about her being his fiancé & his sister went along with it. This gets him mad that they lied to him & he goes to live with Gordon. He wouldn’t even listen to their explanations. When Chris tells him that he never dated Gordon he refused to believe her & thought she was playing Gordon with Ah Kei. It was very hard to watch from here on. Seeing him turned into someone different. By that I meant he was no longer the smart thinker he once was. No matter what happens Chris is your sister. Your only blood relative left & yet he chooses to believe Gordon? Ignoring the fact he no longer cares or trusts Chris. He should at least sympathize the fact that this company that he chose to sign over to Gordon was the last of his fathers hardwork. Even if Ah Fan doesn’t want to be involved with the company, he could’ve passed it on to Chris his blood sister. And I’m just so confused and find it random. Before he lost his memories he doted and loved his sister, always wanting to protect her. He even moved out of their house to live with Ah Kei to protect his sister from getting hurt. They had a tight bond. Even if he loses his memories wouldn’t the familiar feeling stay? The way he tells Chris that he chooses to trust & picks Gordon over her was so heartbreaking. I refuse to believe Ah Fan would ever do that memory loss or not. Also Ah Fan is incredibly smart. He’s able to recognize smells, footsteps and even sound of voices. He’s also able to tell if someone is lying at times. You want me to believe all this time he stayed with Gordon he didn’t find anything suspicious with Gordon & his father? He lost his memory, not his brain. Gordon literally hasn’t even done anything ground breaking for Ah Fan to trust him so deeply. I was also convinced that Ah Fan was faking amnesia to get close to Gordon to build a case on him. But turns out he was just dumb & easily fooled. Even at the very end it caused him getting his memory back for him to finally realize Gordon is evil. Ah Fan went way out of character after the amnesia.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI don’t know how I feel about whether or not I’d re-watch. The beginning and middle was fun and hilarious. I think it would be better if you watch it solely for the comedic side that involved friendship, sibling bond & relationships. If you want to watch it for the crime aspect you’d be disappointed. As for this drama they dumbed down the heroes to drag on the cases to fit the 20 episode quota. They could’ve written more cases instead of dragging the three cases but I guess the writer got lazy. The writer chose to prolong it instead of writing a fresh case. The final case involving the mystery of the parents death was dragged on way too long. Ah Kei didn’t even realize Gordon killed them until the very end. He just believed Gordon is involved but not the mastermind. Also I’m shocked that Gordon would end up being such a hardcore villian. In the beginning he was just another spoiled rich boy. I always thought he made mistakes because he was pampered & wanted more money. The fact Gordon killed years ago and went on to kill more people & even offed his own father was something I didn’t expect happening. Especially since this is supposed to be considered a light comedic cop drama, I never thought it would go as far as family killing. I also hoped that there would be more bromance between Ah Kei & Ah Fan. I was sorely disappointed that their interactions afterwards just involved him pressuring Ah Fan to regain his memory instead of an actual friend bonding LOL. All in all it was a good watch. Willie Wai gave an impressive & eye catching portrayal. Honestly if we’re talking about TV King, Willie should win. He has always been a solid actor & his performance was great and he recieved a lot of praises. He didn’t come off as annoying with his OCD & strange personality. Despite his character going off the walls in the later episodes he still acted very well. Unfortunately the drama got sub par ratings so him winning is very unlikely. Also along with the fact TVB has no plans on promoting him. (He only got this role cause TVB literally ran out of older actors). But my vote goes to Willie to win nonetheless. I guess I’d probably re-watch the beginning again and just skip the unnecessary amnesia arc.\n\nEnding & Thoughts: Line Walker: Bull Fight\n\nThis is my most highly anticipated drama of the year. I’ve always loved the Line Walker series and Raymond Lam returning was just the cherry on top. It wasn’t bad but something was just missing. Line Walker is known for polices going undercover to solve cases. And one of the most prominent aspect was “figuring” out who is the hidden undercover. This aspect was missing in this sequel. I understand it in a way cause how many series can you make focusing on finding a UC? But the mystery of it was what made it fun. So I thought alternatively they could focus the mystery on finding who is the “black” cop. They didn’t do that either though. This is probably gonna turn into a very long post.\n\nThe Characters\n\nIn this sequel we see the return of Bao Seed (Raymond Lam), Cheuk Sir (Michael Miu), Tin Tong (Benjamin Yuen), Shuk Mui (Priscilla Wong), Foon Hei (Benz Hui), and guest appearances from Sin Ching (Elena King), Yuk Huen (Shiga Lin) & Wing Cheung (Tony Hung). And then there’s the new cast joining this sequel in Madam G (Mandy Wong), Lam Lam (Serene Lim), Ah Dou (Sisley Choi), Ho Yeung (Owen Cheung) and of course Ngai Tak Lai (Kenneth Ma). Wow this is a huge star- studded cast and I didn’t even include the numerous special guest stars that appeared in this series. It’s an attractive cast for sure but due to it being such a huge cast a lot of characters ended up getting sidelined.\n\nFoon Hei was a huge character in the first and second, but for this one he was just there. He helped Cheuk sir and the others to solve cases but he doesn’t offer much other than that. The only thing that would’ve made him interesting is if we saw the return of Lok Siu (Pakho Chau), who he saved in the prequel. Unfortunately we don’t find out what happens to him in this version. I’m hoping that the TVB version that airs on tv will show him cause until then it’s up to our imagination.\n\nAnother pointless character was Ah Dou. Which is such a pity cause she was soo exciting to watch in the beginning. From episodes 1-10 she was interesting but after that it just went bad. It started focusing on her going undercover and falling for Ho Yeung one of the triad leaders. Boy, that was sooooo boring. It was love at first sight for him while Ah Dou just fell in love with gentleness I guess? After that it was just Ah Dou moping cause she feels extreme guilt & wants to quit. And goodness that bothered me so much. Cause love was all it took for her to want to stop pursuing justice that she wanted when she first joined the police force. After that she was mostly in the background. She didn’t help solve anymore cases and just talked when spoken to. At the end she helped find a chip that incriminated Tak Lei but even then he got away with it. I have no idea why the writers didn’t do more with her character. She wasn’t even there for the final villian gun shooting show down. Her potential was literally wasted in this. Also off topic, but she’s always wearing short-shorts in this series whether undercover or not and that’s how she dresses. I have no problem but yet when Rachel Koo from Al Cappucino dresses formally everyone disses her saying how she shouldn’t be dressing like that cause she’s a cop. Yet here Ah Dou is always dressed in that and no one says anything? I guess when you hate someone, you’ll also hate them over the dumbest thing.\n\nHo Yeung is literally a supporting character yet he managed to get more screentime then Bao Seed and Tin Tong. WTH?? Another unfair tactic used by TVB to promote Owen. Now this character isn’t bad but he’s pretty bland. And I’m not gonna lie, when he found out that Ah Dou was actually a UC and he had a standoff with her. That scene was pretty touching, he was so hurt but at the same time he couldn’t hurt her. It felt sad but too bad I just wasn’t invested in their love story. His performance here wasn’t that special. He was just mono-toned the entire time- so I don’t get where the praises is coming from? He was waaaay better in Al Cappuccino.\n\nTin Tong. One word WHY?? What happened to you? I loved you in the prequel. You were that comic relief playboy. You were hilarious and full on flirtatious. But in this sequel you were way too bland and wooden. I don’t even get what happened. This was a horrible character development. And before you say “he was only flirty cause he was undercover”. That ain’t true when he met up with Cheuk Sir and the rest he would show his true form and there he was still playful! Also there were flashbacks from before he went undercover and he was suuuper serious there too. So he went from serious to playful to back to serious. And it’s a pity cause Benjamin only excels in fun roles and becomes wooden with other ones.\n\nMadam G was a failure. And even more of a disappointment then Ah Dou. She starts off amazing too! A cop with a great sense of justice, and quick witted. Yet, the writers messed up her character as well. Her character is literally a rehash of Madam Yuen from Brutally Young. Where she gets used by people around her and her being so dumb to not figure it out. It’s worse here because once she realized her sister is evil, she does nothing. She leaves the police force and huddles herself alone. While more crimes are committed, & more people are dying. She criticized Cheuk sir so hard when he betrayed the force to save his wife. Yet she’s doing the same thing with her sister but worse cause she chooses to keep this information to herself. If she had revealed what she knew, more people could’ve been saved & honestly her sister could’ve survived too. In the end the only reason she got evidence to arrest Tak Lei is because HE CHOSE to let her go or else she would’ve been dead. Another waste of a potential smart character. Another bland performance by Mandy but it could also be because the character faltered in the end.\n\nNgai Tak Lei, why are you so indecisive? You’re like evil and then you’re not. You’re just like going back and forth before going fully on evil mastermind. It took him way to long to even begin to avenge his brothers death. Kenneths protrayal was pretty bad and uninteresting. I was never scared of his character in the show. When I watched Death By Zero I was literally terrified of Brian Tse. To be a good villain you would have to be able to invoke fear from the audience. I never felt that way with this character. He was just annoying but at the same time he was only annoying cause the other characters were too slow to realize how evil he is.\n\nThe Plot\n\nEpisodes 1 - 10 were AMAZING. This arc featured selling organs in the black market. And wow it was great. Bao Seed became a handler for Chu Sin (Mayanne Mak) and worked together to find the mastermind behind this trade. In the process Chu Sin dies while saving someone else. Bao Seed is overcome with extreme guilt as she died under his watch. The sadness I felt was no joke. Chu Sin only appeared in the first episode and dies yet I felt such huge anguish & pain when she died. She died a hero and when Bao Seed avenged her death it was done with great justice. Along with this arc Cheuk Sir opens a coffee shop with his wife Sin Ching but she is later diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. Cheuk sir in order to save his wife betrays the police in order to get a liver transplant for her. Unfortunately after going through all that Sin Ching passes away anyways. It was so touching to see them go on one last date together, and they danced together and then she finally passes away in his arms. I was almost in tears cause they went through so much together. I just wanted them to be happy. The flashbacks and the songs they played were perfectly in sync. And then that’s it. After this amazing black market arc it goes downhill.\n\nFrom episodes 11- 20 it focused heavily on Ah Dou & Ho Yeungs love story. It got to the point that we barely saw Bao Seed, Madam G and well basically any other characters. All the other characters were like just in the background going through the motions. It was so slow paced and boring. I kid you not, you can watch episode 10 & 11 then skip to episode 20 and you would still get what’s going on. That’s how uninteresting and useless those episodes were. And even now I still don’t get the point of this arc. It was about them duking it out to become the top official leader of the triad. Yet I was not invested at all. The sad part is even after Ho Yeung gets arrested and was no longer part of the main story, it was still boring.\n\nEpisodes 21- 30 focused more on flashback scenes of two undercover cops that died in the prequel. Along with Bao Seeds secret son that they focused way too much on. With a side story of Shuk Mui and Tin Tong finally getting together. These episodes here were pretty much all over the place. The flashback scenes were not needed at all & I’m pretty sure it was only there cause TVB really wanted to give Shiga & Tony more screentime. I would rather have TVB write a different prequel with them starring in it, then to see them act as filler in this drama. And seriously Tin Tong ends up having 2 girlfriends that worked undercover dead? It’s like he’s cursed. The writers could’ve done so much more with Bao Seed but writing in a secret son is just lazy writing. It didn’t help advance the plot & in the end his son still doesn’t even know that he’s the real Dad. I thought it would end with his sons fake father (whose also a cop) turns evil and uses the son against Bao Seed. But that does not happen so it just ended up being more filler than anything. One thing I did really like is how they written the relationship between Bao Seed and Lam Lam. It wasn’t romantic and never got romantic as Bao Seed still loves Ah Deng (Charmaine Sheh) and Lam Lam only had a one sided crush. But I really appreciate the “platonic -esq” of it. It didn’t turn into anything more but I really liked how they have an understanding of one another. Lam Lam knows he won’t love her but is so kind and still willing to help him instead of being bitter & jealous! I also liked the mentorship that developed between Bao Seed and Ah Dou. I’d rather have them write more about that then the stupid love line she got instead.\n\nThe story started to pick up in episodes 31 - till the end. But it really aggravated me that no one suspected Tak Lei as the mastermind. It would’ve been interesting to see someone go undercover to capture him but that didn’t happen. I thought Cheuk sir would realize it quicker. He already knew about him orchestrating to have someone stab Wai Kit (Tak Lei supposed Father). So I thought Cheuk sir would look into him more. Cause wouldn’t he find it weird he was willing to kill his own “father”? Madam G is literally his girlfriend at this point and was able to suspect her own sister but not him? Are you serious? It just seemed like everyone was blind to his actions. I still don’t get why Madam Gs sister didn’t expose Tak Lei as evil. Like why is she helping him? I don’t understand? Was she evil all along? But if she was, why did she plan to expose him but then chose against it when he decided to not kill her? Was she touched cause he did love his sister? I just don’t understand. Bao Seed is a sharp character he should’ve been able to find out sooner. The writing just got sloppy with this part. The ending was nice, justice was served. Madam G is confined to a wheelchair which I’m glad cause she literally indirectly caused a lot of the unnecessary deaths and drama. Cheuk sir is reinstated as a police. Bao Seed decides to go look for Ah Deng. And ends in a good old fashioned cliffhanger. This one I can get behind as most of the main points were resolved.\n\nThe Surprise Ending\n\nTak Lei is killed by another mysterious figure played by Michael Tse. That’s a nice surprise! A pity that he isn’t reprising his role of Laughing Gor though. Madman (Joseph Zheng) who we thought died earlier turns out to be alive and held captive by another mysterious figure portrayed by Philip Keung. This was also a nice touch! Especially when it was revealed that Madman is not who he says he is. I would definitely watch a fourth sequel. Madman was on the way to becoming my favourite character but he had so little screentime I couldn’t really write much about him. He’s a good fighter, smart and he’s able to adapt in situations. So I was pretty sad when he died. But good thing that was not the case. I wonder how they’re gonna write how he survived though in the sequel. One part that annoyed me is that after this whole drama we still don’t know what happened to Ah Deng. They strung us along with saying “she died” to “oh she didn’t die” to having her go MIA. I get why though, TVB wants to leave it open ended should Charmaine ever choose to reprise her iconic role.\n\nMy Prediction for the Sequel\n\nIf there is one, I don’t see Bao Seed coming back. Mainly cause Raymond doesn’t seem to be interested especially with how his screentime got reduced for Owen. I can see that the fourth one would continue on with Tin Tong and Cheuk sir moving on to a different case. But of course Michael & Phillip would disrupt it. Madman will show up and throw them off. They’ll probably say Bao Seed left to go look for Ah Deng and write him off. I’d rather not see Madam G. Ah Dou would be pointless to bring back unless they kill off Ho Yeung so she gets a new love interest. I hope for the fourth one they bring back the who dunnit concept.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI remember on my post on Al Cappucino, I talked about how unrealistic it was with how they portrayed handlers and undercover cops. And that if you wanted to watch a realistic one watch Line Walker... well I take that back. Well for this sequel anyways since it’s super unrealistic how everyone knew Bao Seed was a UC and how they also knew Ah Dou was undercover as well.\n\nThis drama had so much guest stars that I lost count of how many appeared. But I was severely disappointed they didn’t bring Sharon Chan in to guest star. She literally played Sin Yan aka Sin Chings younger sister. It makes no sense that when her sister died she didn’t come back to see her one last time! It would’ve been fine to have her cameo or something. It’s like the writers forgot her character existed. But then again they brought back Owen when he already played a different character (Ah Fo) in the first one and ignored it. Also Pakho scenes getting deleted greatly upset me. In the prequel we were left wondering what happened to him and yet we still don’t know right now.\n\nOne of the flashback scene that I really enjoyed was Muk Sat (Oscar Leung) meeting Tak Q (Brian Tse). They both were basically the obligatory best friend to the male lead who dies tragically. So having these 2 meet and since they both were goofballs it was super hilarious and intriguing to watch!\n\nI like how they kept the story interconnected with Bao Seed taking over Ah Dengs massage parlour while he waited for her to come back. A pity they couldn’t replicate how the parlour looked in the first one. But it has been 6 years so it would be fairly difficult. Ah Mui dying was sad especially since Tin Tong waited 10 years to be with her. I still feel that 37 episodes made the drama too draggy. And they added subplots that weren’t crucial to the plot.\n\nAll in all. It wasn’t terrible but wasn’t great either. There was too much filler & useless flashback scenes. The first ten episodes were perfectly top notch! The middle part was a downer but the ending was thrilling to watch. But my top series of the year would still be Brutally Young, Death by Zero & Al Cappuccino.\n\nEnding & Thoughts: Al Cappuccino\n\nAnother wacky and zany drama. Now I’m telling you now. Do not go into this drama expecting a dark thrilling undercover cop show. Cause this ain’t it. It’s more on the hilarious, lighthearted take on the police and triads. It’s not realistic in any way. Well I mean, no drama is fully realistic but this one is the exact opposite of how things should’ve gone down.\n\nThe amount of times where they talked OPENLY LOUD about who and who is undercover is ridiculous. It’s like they don’t even try to hide the fact. Typically only one or two people would know a certain someone is undercover. In this drama the handlers whole teams know, as well as her superiors. The amount of times they would meet up in public spaces or just casually call them over their personal phone is mind blowing. At first it was annoying, cause every time they did something so openly, I would think well “cover is blown”. But that’s not the case. As you continue to watch, you start to ignore it and pretend everyone is deaf and blind to this. When that happens the drama starts to become entertaining.\n\nThis whole drama just focused on one storyline and that is investigating who killed the triad boss. We don’t find out who it is until the very end. The stories in between talks about Chiang Sai Lung (Vincent Wong) taking over the head triads role. A lot of struggles in between with him trying to stay in this role. Side stories dealing with love lines, fan service scenes of bromance. The bromance was a huge factor and what made me so compelled to keep watching. Honestly Sai Lung and his 4 love interests were totally boring to me. I enjoyed his bromance with Go Bun (Owen Cheung)more. Also really liked Koo Yan Yi (Crystal Fung) as the handler and watch as the 3 become very close. This trio was fun to watch compared to those unnecessary side love stories.\n\nSai Lungs love story features heavily in this drama, so I can’t just not talk about them. The 4 woman in Sai Lungs life comprises of Koo Yan Yi aka Madam Koo, his handler that has a strong sense of justice & loyalty. So Tsz Shan (Kathy Yuen) a timid woman who aspires to be a teacher. Chong Ming Lai (Samantha Ko) a haughty actress. And Yiu Ching Shui aka Shui jie (Angel Chiang), the confident, outspoken business woman. Out of the 4, I only liked Madam Koo & Shui Jei. I guess this is TVBs attempt to make him similar to Chor Lau Heung where everyone falls in love with the male lead despite him not even trying.\n\nTsz Shan is so boring and easily bullied. She was not fun to watch, I didn’t think she had chemistry with Sai Lung and odd enough she was a huge fan favourite. Which I can’t wrap my head around, her character was just so bland to me. She’s so oblivious to her Dad and brothers wrongdoings. It gets annoying when she’s so blind to it all. I know it’s hard to believe your family member is evil, but really? Her role here is basically to be the main love interest to Sai Lung since she plays no role in solving the main mystery. She hasn’t even tried to help Sai Lung to uncover anything. She’s always so timid and getting put into a position where she’s in danger. Way too damsel in distress for me.\n\nMing Lai was super annoying, all she does is bother Sai Lung and threatens to make him stay by her side. And when she forces him to announce that their dating (they actually aren’t) she gets pissed when he leaves her for someone else. Like girl, you know he doesn’t like you. You blackmailed him into staying with you. Like what did you expect? Also her character could be written out and no one would notice her gone. That’s how unnecessary she was. She’s literally a filler character created to fill up the 30 episode slot. Samantha Ko is a great actress, it just sucks her role here is so unneeded.\n\nShui Jie was a breath of fresh air. Originally she was sent to seduce Sai Lung but she ends up falling for him instead. I really disliked how she fell for him though, it came out of nowhere. They met 4 times and suddenly she’s in love? It was to rush and random for me. But as a character itself, she was a breeze to watch. She’s super confident and smart. Unlike Tsz Shan she’s able to help Sai Lung in solving a lot of his problems and find ways to warn him of danger. I love how brave she is. She’s not afraid to tell someone she loves them and pursue it.\n\nMadam Koo was also another likeable character. She doesn’t want to be known as just a pretty rich girl. She wants to prove that she can be a successful cop. You can tell how much faith she puts into Go Bun and Sai Lung. She treats them fairly and always finds way to help them. I really like how she can remain calm and think things through. When Go Bun and Sai Lung seemingly betrays her. She doesn’t get angry instead she goes and secretly investigates what’s going on. That is how she figured out how her Father was one of the masterminds. And she did that all alone.\n\nAnother side love story would be between Go Bun and Chiang Chin Ha (Winki Lai). They were fun to watch and had awesome chemistry. From the beginning we see that they both liked each other but won’t make a move. Chin Ha with her pride and knowing Go Bun would not reciprocate. Go Bun on the other hand is a cop. To him he can never be with someone involved with the triads. So it becomes a can’t help but love each other story. They were cute together but it was unrealistic for Chin Ha to forgive Go Bun so easily after finding out 1) he’s an undercover cop and 2) he only approached her to solve the case. Essentially Go Bun used her infiltrate the triad. The fact that it was glossed over so quickly made no sense. Chin Ha is a strong minded business person who strongly cares about her family. Yet, Go Bun lied to her all this time and used not only her but her family as well, and she’s okay with it? I’m glad they got a happy ending but I wished it showed more of the internal struggle with her finding out.\n\nI’m always hoping for a good plot twist so I was secretly hoping that Cheung Sai Lun was actually Chiang Sai Lung. And that he was faking it the whole time cause he was upset that his family left him in the orphanage. The amount of scenarios that ran in my mind LOL. I also thought maybe he is Chiang Sai Lung but he himself didn’t know and it just became a case of mistaken identity (this would’ve been sooo good especially towards the end where they had a DNA test done). My third theory was Chiang Sai Lung is not dead and that he would show up in the end to reclaim his identity. But as you can see none of that happened. Don’t worry though, cause there were other plot twists that caught me off guard.\n\nThe first one is Sai Lung getting so caught up with his method acting that he actually becomes cruel. He along with Go Bun betrays Madam Koo and turns to the dark side of the triad. I was so invested in this. I really thought Sai Lung could no longer break his character and that he had fallen into deep. This has happened in real life where actors could no longer separate real from fake. I love that they added that into the storyline cause it makes it all real and scary. Of course turns out it was all an act to sniff out the real killer. Unfortunately it was easy to figure out that it was an act once he had a “fall out” with Go Bun. That part was a little too much for it to be real. And that’s when the surprises stop.\n\nThe second one would be the development of Szeto Shun (Jack Hui) a cop that relies on dirty tactics to climb up in ranks. He is one of the many antagonist, what makes him different though is that he repents and redeems himself by the end. His character had the best development if you ask me. He went from someone whose dream was to be a cop, to using underhanded methods to get his way to finally becoming a human again. He gets so caught up in promotions that he forgot why he became a cop in the first place which is for justice. When he helped Madam Koo arrest the bad guy he said something along the lines of “I have done bad things, but in the end I’m still a cop”. He said that as the reason why he decided to do the right thing for once. At first I thought he’d be the typical evil cop that ends up dying. But this character proved me wrong. In the end he turns himself in as he wanted to take responsibility for his actions.\n\nI was shocked that no one died in this drama. And when I say that I obviously meant the main characters. Usually the obligatory best friend, love interest, family member heck even one of the bad guys would die. But that didn’t happen. They all survived, even the bad guys just quietly went to jail. Speaking of bad guys, their problems were resolved so quickly that it was pointless. We did not sit through all of that drama just for the bad guys to one by one casually reveal what happened. It was so unoriginal too. Like Madam Koos father got touched by her speech about good and evil that her father confessed to the crime. Tsz Shans father out of guilt for being the cause of her daughters injuries confessed to everything to “repent”. Even the ultimate black cop just spewed the truth out once asked. Like I understand he was caught red handed but he literally revealed all of the information once questioned? He’s not even gonna try to fight it? He doesn’t even have an emotional backstory for him to feel guilty to admit the truth. It just happened. It was so nonsensical that I got confused that it all ended so quickly. There wasn’t even a huge fighting showdown. Which is why I say despite this dubbed as a undercover triad thriller drama. It isn’t! Being an undercover cop was like a backdrop, even the mystery death was sidelined. The focus was on the familial and bromance relationship. The drama would’ve been short if they hadn’t added in the random romances.\n\nActing wise, I’ve seen a lot of hate against Crystal. There were so many complaints in the international forums I literally thought she was a train wreck. Well she wasn’t. I don’t see how she ruined the drama? I’m convinced that people just complain about her cause they aren’t happy about her being promoted by TVB. But guys you need to chill. Her acting is pretty decent. She isn’t screaming her lines or bulging her eyes out. She is stiff and needs more work on enunciating. This was her first leading drama and she’s still so new. I really thought her acting would be like Sisley Choi from 2012 with the screaming or Charmaine Sheh from 1998 with the overreacting. But she wasn’t. Also people complained about her wardrobe cause she was dressed so fashionably. Are you guys blind? All the main males in this drama are dressed in suits 24/7 whether they’re a cop or not. Literally Go Bun and Sai Lung wears a suit everyday walking around. They’re not wearing causal wear. Why is no one hating on them? The double standards are scary. But then again it could just be hate against Crystal in general. Back when Niki Chow and Kate Tsui played as cops they would wear high heels and pretty clothes as well but no one said anything. And this drama was anything but realistic. I find that it’s the international fans that are complaining, Hong Kong netizens are actually satisfied with Crystal.\n\nOwen Cheung has finally found his niche and that is comedy. Every drama he’s been in, I’ve always been unimpressed with him. But then I figured out it’s mostly cause he gets typecasted as the “hot” guy in which I personally think he’s not. He’s more suited for nerdy roles like (The Offliners) or comedic roles like this one. It’s like how Benjamin Yuen is wooden in serious roles and only good in comedy ones as well. The bromance between him Vincent was great. So hilarious that I sometimes wished the drama just focused on their bromance only.\n\nThe ending was open ended in a way. Go Bun and Chin Ha gets married. The Chiang family has left the triad behind and deals with legal business only. Sai Lun has to make a choice of staying in Hong Kong or pursuing his acting dreams overseas. And between the 4 woman in love with him, he doesn’t end up with either of them. Only ending with saying how he’s happy he met the 4 of them. Obviously he loves Tsz Shan the most. No question about it. The 4 woman knows that as well. So I don’t know why they ended it like that. This is the first drama where the female lead loves the male lead but they don’t end up together. Instead he falls fall for the second lead instead. I’m okay with it as I prefer Madam Koo and Sai Lun as good friends but it’s surprising to see them go down this route instead. Sequel? Hmm I don’t know. What could the sequel be about? Sai Lun can’t just go undercover in a different family again. Unless they shift the focus from triad/ cops to something else.\n\nDespite the flaws I love this drama. I ke"
