        "text": "Canada-born Hong Kong actress-singer Charlene Choi is among the hundreds of thousands of people feeling the effects of Super Typhoon Saola.\n\nHong Kong imposed its highest hurricane storm signal 10 on Friday (Sept 1), and urged its citizens to remain indoors and stay away from windows and doors exposed to the strong winds.\n\nOn Saturday, Choi shared on Instagram a reel of the severe leaks in her home caused by the ferocious typhoon that has battered the island.\n\nIn the short video that showed her predicament, water is seen seeping through gaps between the ceiling and windows. Heavy rain can also be heard pelting against the windows.\n\nThe 40-year-old member of Cantopop group Twins posted a photo of towels lining the windows to soak up the rainwater and seal up the gaps, with the caption: “Hold on tight.”\n\nIn her post, Choi asked if anyone was in a similar situation and told her followers to stay safe.\n\nSeveral netizens replied that they were in the same boat, while others were glad Choi was hunkered down at home.\n\nShe reportedly owns at least five properties valued at over a billion Hong Kong dollars. According to Hong Kong media Dim Sum Daily, Choi earns a monthly sum of HK$200,000 (RM118,809) from rental income alone.\n\nChoi, who divorced actor-singer Ronald Cheng after a four-year marriage, has been focusing on her career in China.\n\nShe recently broke up with Hong Kong’s “Mahjong Prince” Anthony Shek, her boyfriend of six years. – The Straits Times/Asia News Network"
