        "text": "After six years of dating, Charlene Choi from Cantopop duo Twins has called it quits with her longtime boyfriend Anthony Shek. Since going public with their romance back in 2017, the 40-year-old Ah Sa and her “Mahjong Prince” are already living together and well past the “meet the parents” phase. However, recent rumours suggest that the couple have already split and that a third party was the reason for the breakup. Moreover, there’s also speculation that the pair’s differing views on the subject of marriage could have also played a hand in their split. Post breakup, Ah Sa is reportedly indulging in a much needed break to heal. She’s been spotted jetting off to different destinations with family and friends.\n\nDespite Charlene’s claims that the breakup was amicable, Hong Kong media reports that Anthony’s close relationship with a certain Miss C from the entertainment industry was the main reason for the split. Sources have also claimed that Anthony’s partying ways saw him continue to frequent nightclubs. Meanwhile, although Charlene confirmed the breakup recently, she also denied the involvement of any third party as the reason.\n\nSadly, each one of Charlene Choi’s three relationships in the public eye seems to have ended with a broken heart. Her secret marriage to Ronald Cheng Chung-kei was outed only when the couple held a press conference announcing their divorce. They’d been married for four years. Then at the end of 2010, she began dating William Chan whom she’d worked with whilst filming Beauty on Duty. They’d also dated for four years before separating in 2015. Her romance with Anthony Shi was her third one which lasted six years before the couple called it quits."
