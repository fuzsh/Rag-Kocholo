        "text": "Earlier rumored to be married in the U.S., Ronald Cheng Chung Kei and Charlene Choi Cheuk Yin avoided talking about their marriage and instead strangely announced their break up. Yesterday a newspaper found their 2006 Los Angeles marriage certificate and proved that they were already married. They yesterday immediately held a press conference to admit that they were indeed married but now due to an understanding they have broken up and will file for divorce. Cheng Chung Kei who deeply loved Ah Sa emotionally broke down when he talked about them unable to be a couple.\n\nYesterday at 6:30PM, they held a press conference with several dozen reporters on hand. They first posed for press photos then their eyes did not give the same look. Then Cheng Chung Kei spoke first. He took out the written script and said, \"Thank you very much everyone today for coming to Choi Cheuk Yin and my press conference, the marriage is a fact. In 06 we very happily made a decision and received both sides' parental support to wed in Los Angeles. All along, Ah Sa and my attitude to love and marriage has been they were two people's personal matter and didn't need to be publicized. Both sides agreed to this handling method.\" Cheng Chung Kei pointed out in recent years, the outside speculation of their relationship and the continuous inaccurate reports made them feel that today they must explain to everyone and it is also the final explanation. Cheng Chung Kei continued, \"During the several years of our marriage, our lives have been very happy. During this period we grew up together and had even deeper understanding of each other. We realize that breaking up will be better for everyone in the future, so recently we announced our break up to everyone. This reason was made under a sensible situation. This decision is also a fact. I again stress, our break up does not involve any third party. It also does not involve any outside rumored inaccurate reports. I believe the divorce will be the question that everyone will follow up with. This has already been handled. Everything in the legal procedure that we have to do we will do.\"\n\nCheng Chung Kei stopped for a deep breath, bit his lip to hold back his tears. Ah Sa saw how he looked and was teary eyed. After around 20 seconds, Cheng Chung Kei sobbed, \"Even though......we cannot......be husband and wife, we indeed have had a very happy period.\" Ah Sa handed him a tissue. Cheng Chung Kei removed his glasses to wipe his tears. He again said, \"I even more hope that we can be good friends forever. I really want to thank everyone, and hope everyone would return a little space to us. Thank you.\" He again removed his glasses to wipe away tears.\n\nAlthough Ah Sa was teary eyed she was not as emotional as Cheng Chung Kei. She said, \"All along with Ronald from when we started dating to marriage to now breaking up, we have a mutual understanding to make every decision. They are the choices of the two of us. Our marriage not only was a decision that we made with a mutual understanding but also received our family and friends' support. All along, we felt this is a matter of two people, we didn't choose to explain to everyone as we felt it was private. We really wanted it to be our little secret.\" Ah Sa expressed, \"All along we thought that we are artists but we can have privacy that belonged to us, but actually it isn't. Artists cannot have existing privacy.\" She said, \"This matter already no longer only involved two people. (Sniffles) It already reached a place that involves many different people and things. All along we didn't choose to publicize because we reached a mutual understanding, because it could protect everyone's relationship, the other party and family. Now it already has caused damage for many people, we don't want to more damages to follow. So we are explaining this matter to everyone, hopefully in the future you will give more space to me and Ronald. We are still good friends, I hope that Ronald and I will be very happy in the lives that follow.\" Ah Sa also used a tissue to wipe away her tears, then Ronald patted Ah Sa's back and asked whether she had any more to say. Then they stood up together and bowed to the media. They left together. The entire press conference lasted 12 minutes."
