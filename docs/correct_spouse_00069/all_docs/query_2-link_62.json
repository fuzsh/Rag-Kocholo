Twins are made up of two girls, Charlene Choi () and Gillian Chung ().[1] They are a popular group in Hong Kong and a top band in mainland China. Their fanbase have included Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Canada, Australia, United States, Vietnam and Philippines. Their music was generally targeted at young teens, but in 2004 they began to attract a wider audience by venturing into different styles of music. In February 2008 the duo temporarily separated after the Edison Chen photo scandal involving Gillian Chung.[2] The group reunited two years later in 2010.[3]\n\nIn early January 2008, Twins won two major awards at the 2007 Jade Solid Gold Top 10. They earned the most popular group award as well as the most popular Asia Pacific region female artist award.[13] That year, Twins released their third Mandarin and final album before their hiatus, titled Twins Language. The group was dragged into the fray when Gillian was involved in the Edison Chen photo scandal. Her private images were among those which found their way onto the internet at the end of February 2008. With Gillian deciding to duck out of the public eye, Twins announced its \"temporary dissolution\" in July 2008. Charlene said she was highly optimistic that they would reunite some day in the future.[2]\n\nAsked how things were going with her partner Gillian Chung, who hid from the public after the nude photo scandal earlier this year, Ah Sa smiled. She commented that Gillian is resting and the feelings of pressure have subsided. 589ccfa754\n\nwindows server 2012 training videos free download\n\nDekart Private Disk Cracker\n\nadvance steel 2016 crack 12"
