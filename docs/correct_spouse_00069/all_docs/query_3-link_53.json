        "text": "2. 你好 AHUNDREDGHOSTS PARADETONIGHT China started it’s summer in June with the worst heat wave in more than 100 years. June & July became an exam- obsessed period where most of China’s focus was on the Gao Kao - China’s most intense national college entrance exam. August then turned, according to the Lunar Calendar, into a ghostly month where it’s believed deceased ancestors rise from below to visit their living families. With so much happening, September could not be a better month to share with you the weird and wonderful stories that make up the ever chaotic China, as well as the latest in popular culture. Our designer in this issue, Jok Jiang, draws his design inspiration from Japan’s folklore “Hundred ghosts parade tonight” as a tribute for the ghostly festivities that we have recently just celebrated.\n\n3. China snapshot\n\n4. 1 REJECTED BYTHESTARS Star signs has become an increasingly popular topic for Chinese people in various aspects of lives. Parents look at star signs when matchmaking their children, girlfriends discuss star signs to try to get to know each other better. Couples look at star signs for compatibility. But when we see the work place judging you based on your star signs, we know the society is taking it to the next level. Recent job hunters, as many graduated in June, have found themselves getting rejected by companies simply because they were not born in the correct sign. Companies go as far as recruiting employees specific to certain horoscopes – Gemini, Libra, Aquarius, etc, perhaps more of their balanced, easy-going trait. Unfortunately, for many workplaces in China, Virgoeans and Scorpions are not highly welcome, most likely because of their difficult, almost on-the-edge anal traits. But then again, wouldn’t they make good bosses? “Sorry, we do not hire Virgo & Scorpio’s...”\n\n5. 2 COMINGOUT ISSODAMNHARD In china, Two elderly gay men living in Beijing find themselves in the center of controversy after their high-profile coming out on the web is as much censured as praised. Their unofficial wedding ceremony on January 30 was streamed online, but according to the couple, it was going smoothly until the son of the teacher, who has been estranged from the father for years because of his homosexuality, crashed it, chased The couple held their ‘wedding ceremony’ in Beijing and invited internet users over to their reception. Images taken from Weibo their guests away and cut off the streaming. “It made us so humiliated, so painful … Why even a stranger can wish us happy and my own son cannot?” However, in recent years there are signs of growing acceptance and tolerance towards homosexuals amongst the younger generation which is largely influenced by Japanese comics that portray beautiful looking male characters. Many young women who fantasizes about male-male romance are usually obsessed with beautiful faces and ripped bodies that when they see real-life plain-looking gay couple, they are disappointed by the gap between the ideal and the reality. It is estimated that there are nearly 30 million homosexual men and women in China. 16 million women are desperately stuck in fake marriages to gay men who are still in closet due to family pressures.\n\n6. 3 It’s that time of the year that we just have to talk about how crazy it is when parents sleep over at schools as a way to send their children off to university. Every year in September when the first school semesters begin, college students leave home for the first time to embark on a new life journey, and parents drop everything just so they can accompany their only child on this journey. So, do not be surprised when you begin you freshmen year with the school’s largest auditorium filled with parents who are unable to find nearby hotels to stay in. This annual phenomena has become a norm, to the point that schools now prepare mattresses, fans and other accommodations for parents every September.

On June 23, Renmin University’s (one of China’s top university) launched their newly designed website featuring a beautiful young female student with a welcoming smile on her face and caused quite a stir, bringing so much traffic to the website that the server crashed temporally. The university’s website is a contrast to most Chinese educational website as it is usually quite boring and dry. THE‘WAITINGFOR YOU’MEME Renmin University website “I am at University of Electronic science waiting for you” “I am at southwest University waiting for you” “I am at Fujian Normal University waiting for you” The student’s picture then became widely circulated online, starting what we now see the “waiting for you” trend where good looking students from different universities post pictures of themselves with a piece of paper that says “I am waiting for you at my university.”\n\n8. 5 One Weibo user recently started an online challenge by asking other users to show off their most valuable item and the competition became a hot topic for quite a period of time. Since the competition is WHO’STHE RICHEST? not limited only to the rich, other ‘poorer’ netizens started taking part by showing off what they consider valuable or premium, amongst which include Louis Vuitton toilet paper, invisible Nike shoes, ‘jade’ pendant made of green juice, emerald M&M’s ring. Unfortunately the winner of the competition goes to a young boy who reposted his dad’s wealth of around 14.2 billion RMB with one word “OK”. Who can compete against a father who might possibly be in Forbe’s top 100 rich list?\n\n9. New terms of the month\n\n10. 7 学霸Xue Ba was always used to describe a type of student that can always be found sitting in the front row of the class room, concentrating in class and almost always get the highest grades. However, the term is now being used to describe those who suddenly started cramming their studies right before exams times. When you are in a state where you do not want to be disturbed, when you prioritize studies over anything else, you can tell your friends that you are going to switch into a ‘Xue Ba’ mode. xue ba\n\n11. 8 腦殘粉 nao can fen When fandom becomes an obsession, you will be officially classified a Nao Can Fen, which literally means “brand damaged fans”. The word is used to describe people who have extreme obsession for certain a brand or a certain celebrity. You will always find them screaming for their celebrities, or react immediately to any advertisement, or campaigns their celebrities endorse, or find them dressed head to toe in one brand. The reason one it made into our new terms of the month is because China recently released a hot box office movie called Tiny Times based on one of China’s famous modern novel which turned out to be of huge disappoint, however the fans of the book were too obsessed that they were unable to tell how bad the movie was.\n\n12. Pop China\n\n14. 11 HelloGoodbye DavidTao 再見你好吗 {陶喆} David Tao is back again after ‘disappearing’ for 4 years. Known as the king of R&B, as well as a respected singer-songwriter, David Tao has returned with his latest album “Hello Goodbye”, this time with greater appeal as he cooperates with other pop singers across Asia. The special part about his recent album is his tribute to his late father.\n\n15. 12 Blooming CharleneChoi {蔡 卓妍} Charlene Choi, also known as A-Sa, was once a member of Hong Kong’s famous pop duo Twins. Having become solo, her latest album “Blooming” shows the mature, more feminine side of Charlene that we have never seen before. Her tracks are mainly about love, perhaps which explains her discovery of love having matured from the teen pop identity she once was with Twins.\n\n16. 13 Love×π Yen-J {严爵} Yan-J is a singer-songwriter from Taiwan and “Love x π” is his 4th album. In his album, his music consists of a mixture of jazz, piano and string accompaniment as a way to move beyond the expected singer-songwriter template. Through his album, he wants his fans to share the same belief that he does: that love always saves the day. 好的情人\n\n17. 14 low-keylive SandeeChan {陈 珊妮} Sandee Chan is a singer-songwriter, music producer, and director from Taiwan. Her new album “Low-key Life” is dedicated to her ill mother, where she expresses her sentiment about growing up in a disadvantaged family. She directed 2 of her own music videos for the album where lyrics revolve around issues of middle class families. 低调人生\n\n18. 15 ayalkmod ZHANGZHENYUE {张 震岳} Zhang Zhen Yue is one of the most famous rock musician in Taiwan since the 90’s, however his recent albums have been incorporated with a hint of melancholy, perhaps because of his age and maturity. His newest album “Ayal Kmod” is a knod to his indigenous roots called the Ami tribes, and Ayal Kmod is his Ami name which means sea and mountain. 我是海雅谷慕\n\n20. 17 Blind Detective Directed by Johnnie To, Blind Detective casted two popular Hong Kong actors Andy Lau and Sammi Cheng that reunites on screen after their last movie together 9 years ago. Forced to leave service after turning blind, former detective Johnston Chong See Tun (Andy Lau) ekes out his living by solving cold cases for police rewards. During a bank robbery case, he meets an attractive hit team inspector Goldie Ho Ka Tung (Sammi Cheng). When Ho notices Chong’s strong sense of hearing and smell, she enlists his help in a personal case and he decides to take a stab. After going through the whole movie, you realize this is really just a romantic comedy in a crime thriller context. {盲探}\n\n21. 18 The Rooftop The Rooftop is a candy-colored musical, very much like “Rent” meets “Grease”, directed and starred by none other than Taiwanese heartthrob Jay Chou. The songwriter-turned- singer-turned-actor appeared in “The Curse of the Golden Flower,” one of Chinese director Zhang Yimou’s clunkier epics, and played Kato in Seth Rogen’s disastrous stoner update of “The Green Hornet.” The Rooftop is Jay Chou’ssecond try at directing, and he also scripts, scores and stars. The result is as stated by many viewers as ‘delightful’ and ‘worth- watching’. {天台愛情}\n\n22. 19 TinyTimes Tiny Times is a Chinese romance drama film written, co-produced and directed by Guo Jingming, which is based on the best-selling novel of the same name, also by Guo Jingming himself. The story follows the film’s narrator and protagonist Lin Xiao, along with her best friends Gu Li, Nan Xiang, Tang Wanru, as they navigate between relationship, work and friendship in Shanghai. Despite its commercial success, it received mostly negative reviews. {小時代}\n\n24. 21 weaning “Weaning” follows a white-collar named Anqi who crushes on a IT guy named Li Junpeng. As they plan to get married, Anqi’s father decides to disapprove of the man his daughter is about to marry. Through many difficulties and obstacles, Jun peng and Anqi finally get married, but this is only just the start of a long and trivial journey that difficult realities are simply too hard to avoid. They have to depend on their parents while learning how to live together. This TV-series reflect the life of most young couples living in Shanghai who still have to depend on their parents to survive. {断奶}\n\n26. 23 Chinese Idol It isn’t a surprise to see Chinese Idol enter the China market after The Voice’s huge success just prior. In terms of quality, one may say Chinese Idol has a better pedigree given the 4 judges come from the best in their fields. The final winner was announced just 2 weeks ago concluding the show as the top rated show on Dragon TV’s history. {中国梦之声}\n\n28. 25 ChangBa With KTV (Karaoke) being one of the most popular recreational entertainment in China, who can resist a Karaoke app on your own phone? Chang Ba is a newly released app that allows users to sing to their phones, record it and share it with their social networks. Within the first 20 days of the release, the app received nearly a million downloads and was ranked top 5 in its category on iTunes. {唱吧}"
