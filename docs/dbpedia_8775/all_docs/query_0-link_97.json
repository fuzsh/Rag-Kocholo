It was the first, and remains the only autonomous entity to be populated and governed by Arab Druze. The 1927 Syrian Revolution began in Jabal ad-Druze under the leadership of Sultan al-Atrash. Under the Franco-Syrian Treaty of 1936, it ceased to exist as an autonomous entity and was incorporated into Syria.\n\nAllon Plan for a Druze state in the Golan/Quneitra\n\nDuring the 1970's, Israeli politician Yigal Allon proposed as part of the so-called Allon Plan that a Druze state (\"Jabal Druze\") be established in Syria's Quneitra Governorate, including the Israeli-held Golan Heights [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/988828.html] . Allon died in 1980, and in the following year the Israeli government passed the Golan Heights Law, effectively annexing most of the Governorate.\n\nGovernors\n\n*Amir Salim Basha al-Atrash (May 1, 1921 - September 15, 1923)\n\n*Trenga (provisional) (September 1923 - March 6, 1924)\n\n*Gabriel Marie Victor Carbillet (March 6, 1924 - October 14, 1925)\n\n*Charles Andréa (October 15, 1925-1927)\n\n*Marie Joseph Léon Augustin Henry (1927)\n\n*Abel Jean Ernest Clément-Grancourt (1927-1932)\n\n*Renaud Massiet (February 3, 1932 - January 28, 1934)\n\n*Devicq (1934-1935)\n\n*Tarit (1935 - December 2, 1936)\n\nources and external links\n\n* [http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Syria.html#Jebel%20Druze Syria] - WorldStatesmen\n\n* [http://unimaps.com/syria-leb1923/mainmap.gifMap]\n\nee also"
