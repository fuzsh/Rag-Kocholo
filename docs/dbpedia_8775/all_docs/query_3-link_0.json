        "text": "Druze city in Syria\n\nThis article is about the capital of as-Suwayda Governorate in southern Syria. For the village in Hama Governorate, western Syria, see Al-Suwaydah, Masyaf.\n\nCity in Syria\n\nAs-Suwayda (Arabic: ٱلسُّوَيْدَاء / ALA-LC romanization: as-Suwaydāʾ), also spelled Sweida, is a mainly Druze city located in southwestern Syria, close to the border with Jordan.\n\nIt is the capital of As-Suwayda Governorate, one of Syria's 14 governorates, bordering Jordan in the South and Daraa Governorate in the West and Rif Dimashq Governorate in the north and east. The city is referred to by some as \"Little Venezuela\" due to the city's influx of affluent Venezuelan Syrian immigrants.[4][5][6][7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAncient and Medieval eras\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city was founded by the Nabataeans as Suada. It became known as Dionysias Soada (Ancient Greek: Διονῡσιάς) in the Hellenistic period and the Roman Empire, for the god Dionysus, patron of wine - the city is situated in a famous ancient wine-producing region.\n\nThe name Dionysias replaced the former Nabataean name in 149 AD after Nabataean influence decreased and then concentrated towards the south, as a result of the then accelerating Hellenization of Coele-Syria.\n\nDionysias was a part of the Roman province of Arabia Petraea, and received the rights of civitas during the reign of Commodus between 180 and 185.\n\nDionysus was worshipped in the same Nabatean temple dedicated to Dushara. This practice of associating the worship of local and Hellenic gods was common in Hellenistic Syria.\n\nThis name remained in use during the Byzantine Empire, when the town was under the influence of the Ghassanids. Dionysias then was a diocese with a suffragan bishop from Bosra. It was mentioned in the Synecdemus of Hierocles. After the early Muslim conquests, the city was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate of the Arabs in 629 and became a titular see.[8]\n\nYaqut al-Hamawi noted in the 1220s that As Suwaida was \"a village of the Hauran Province\".[9]\n\nOttoman era\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1516, the city and the adjoining region was conquered from the Mamluk Sultanate by the Ottoman Empire. In 1596 As-Suwayda appeared under the name of Majdal Sawda in the Ottoman tax registers as part of the nahiya (subdistrict) of Bani Nasiyya of the Hauran Sanjak. It had a population of 5 households and 5 bachelors, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 20% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and/or beehives, in addition to \"occasional revenues\"; a total of 6,125 akçe. 3/4 of the revenue went to a waqf.[10]\n\nIn recent times Dionysias was identified as as-Suwayda by William Waddington.\n\nIn the 19th century, visitors recorded the now-destroyed Tomb of Hamrath, an elaborate late Hellenistic mausoleum dating from the 1st century BCE.[11]\n\nModern era\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city has been held by the Syrian government for the duration of the Syrian Civil War. On 28 October 2012, security forces launched a campaign of mass arrests in the city.[12]\n\n2018 As-Suwayda attacks\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2018 As-Suwayda attacks\n\nOn July 25, 2018, the city was rocked by a string of terrorist attacks. A group of at least 56 ISIS-affiliated attackers entered the city and initiated a series of gunfights and suicide bombings killing 246 people, the vast majority of them civilians. Many of the terrorists were reported killed during the attack, bringing the total death toll to at least 302 people.[13] Forty-two Druze residents between the ages of 7 and 60 were kidnapped by ISIS and held captive. One was executed bringing the total in captivity to 41.[14]\n\nProtests\n\n[edit]\n\n2020 Suweida protests\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 7 June 2020, anti-government protests erupted in the city due to the deteriorating economic situation. Protesters demanded the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad for the first time since 2015.[15][16] As a result of the protests, Prime Minister Imad Khamis was sacked on 11 June and replaced by Hussein Arnous.[17]\n\n2022 Suweida protests\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February, hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Sweida to decry corruption and worsening living standards.[18]\n\n2023 Suweida protests\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: 2023 Syrian protests\n\nIn August, thousands of protestors took to the streets to decry worsening economic conditions and demanding the departure of Syrian President Bashar al Assad.[19]\n\nDemographics and population\n\n[edit]\n\nThe inhabitants of the city are mainly Druze with a Greek Orthodox Christian and Sunni Muslim minority.\n\nThe population of As-Suwayda Governorate is 313,231 (2004 census).\n\nArchaeology\n\n[edit]\n\nMany archeological sites can be found in the old part of the city:\n\nTemple of Dionysus-Dushara: eight well-decorated columns are still standing from the temple.\n\nSaint Sergius Basilica: was built in the fifth century. It has Byzantine architectural elements, with an abbey surrounding it. The basilica was dedicated to Sergius.\n\nThe arch of the lesser church: the church itself is ruined. An arch is still standing there known locally as \"The Gallows\" (Arabic: المشنقة al-Mashnaqah) with grape motif decorations.\n\nThe theater: was recently discovered[when?], south of the Agora.\n\nThe city has many ancient reservoirs, towers and old Roman houses that are still inhabited by locals today.\n\nMany parts of the old city still await excavation, such as the Roman aqueduct, a conical reservoir, and a larger Roman theatre. There is also an old 7th century mosque built during the time of the Rashidun Caliphate.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nSuwayda's climate is warm, dry and temperate. There is more rainfall in the winter than in the summer. This location is classified as BSk by Köppen and Geiger. The average temperature is 15.5 °C. About 323 mm of precipitation falls annually.\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nNajat Abdul Samad, writer, translator, and obstetrician.\n\nFahd Ballan, singer, actor.\n\nAsmahan, singer.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]"
