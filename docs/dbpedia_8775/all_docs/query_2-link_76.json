        "text": "Despite the vast recent research on religious minorities in the Middle East, surprisingly little comprehensive work is published about the Druze as a political entity. Especially the current position of the Druze communities in the respective states is under-researched. The overall impression that emerges from the existing literature is contradictory and partly advocates an image of a uniform Druze political behaviour guided by the principles of religiously sanctioned dissimulation. However, this approach tends to generalize while neglecting the individual factors as well as broader political trends which shape each Druze-state relationship. The aim of this paper is to explore the position of the Druze communities of Syria, Lebanon and Israel on the political landscape of each state. This paper argues that the position of the Druze community in the three states is very different in each case and depended on many individual factors mainly demographic features, geography, collective memory, leadership and especially the type of the respective political system."
