        "text": "A recent attack on Druze villagers by radical Islamist rebels in Syria has raised fears about the fate of the country's secretive sect.\n\nAt least 20 Druze were shot dead by the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front in the north-western province of Idlib.\n\nIt was the deadliest attack on Druze civilians since the beginning of the country's conflict four years ago.\n\nFighting has spread to areas where Druze predominate. They are the third-largest religious minority in Syria and are considered by jihadists as heretics.\n\nThe Druze religion arose from Ismailism, a branch of Shia Islam, in the 11th Century.\n\nIt takes its name from Mohammed bin Ismail al-Darazi, a mystic from Central Asia who regarded the third Fatamid caliph of Egypt, al-Hakim, as an incarnation of God.\n\nIn 1021, al-Hakim disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Druze believe that he will reappear at the end of time to establish universal justice.\n\nAl-Hakim's successor, al-Zahir, rejected his claim of divinity and persecuted the Druze, forcing them to take refuge in remote mountainous areas, chiefly in Lebanon and Syria.\n\nToday, Druze make up about 3% of Syria's population of 22.5 million.\n\nMost live in the rugged Jabal al-Druze region of Suweida province, south of the capital Damascus. There are also several Druze villages elsewhere in Syria, including the Jabal al-Summaq region of Idlib - the location of last week's shooting.\n\nTo avoid persecution over the centuries, Druze have been secretive about their religion. Only a small number who demonstrate extreme piety and devotion are allowed to participate fully in rituals and have access to scriptures.\n\nAnd although Druze have played prominent roles in shaping the region's history, they have traditionally been considered political quietists.\n\nSome Druze took up arms and formed Popular Committees to defend their homes against rebel attacks, while others joined a pro-Assad paramilitary group, the National Defence Forces, which fights alongside the army.\n\nBut with government forces suffering a string of defeats since December, signs of dissent have become more visible among Druze.\n\nThose in the south have in particular reacted angrily to the government's efforts to stem its manpower losses by rounding up young men evading compulsory military service.\n\nConscription patrols have reportedly been attacked and expelled by residents of Druze villages, and last December an intelligence officer was kidnapped in an attempt to free a local man arrested for draft-dodging.\n\nThe government sought to calm the situation by agreeing to deploy Druze conscripts only in their home areas, but Druze leaders have accused it of breaking that promise.\n\nDruze are also increasingly concerned about the threat posed by jihadists from al-Nusra Front and Islamic State, who have been gaining ground in south.\n\nAl-Nusra fighters are currently only a few kilometres away from the provincial capital of Suweida, opening the possibility that they will soon move on Jabal al-Druze, where Druze constitute the vast majority of the local population.\n\nIn Lebanon, Druze leader Walid Jumblatt strongly condemned the shooting, but insisted it was an isolated incident.\n\nMr Jumblatt, a staunch opponent of President Assad, called on Syrian Druze to support the rebellion in their country, arguing that the real threat to them came from a government that killed dozens of people every day.\n\nA Lebanese Druze politician close to Mr Assad, Wiam Wahhab, disagreed and appealed for \"money, volunteers, weapons\" to help those in Suweida defend themselves.\n\nAs a minority, Druze have had to negotiate centuries of conflict in the region. Once more, they are being forced to pick a side and potentially decide their fate."
