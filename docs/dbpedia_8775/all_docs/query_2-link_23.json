        "text": "Druze revolt\n\nSyrian history\n\nDruze revolt, uprising of Druze tribes throughout Syria and in part of Lebanon directed against French mandatory officials who attempted to upset the traditions and the tribal hierarchy of Jabal ad-Durūz.\n\nIn 1923 Captain Carbillet, the French, but Druze-elected, governor of Jabal ad-Durūz, introduced modern administrative and social reforms that antagonized the population. The high-handed treatment accorded Druze complaints by the high commissioner, General Maurice Sarrail, and his arrest and detainment of several Druze leaders in July 1925 resulted in a full-fledged rebellion. Led by Sulṭān al-Aṭrash, the Druze defeated the French in August and by September were joined by Syrian nationalists from the People’s Party, who entreated their countrymen to join the revolt. When the rebellion reached Damascus, the French bombed the city, but Druze discontent continued to expand into southern Lebanon. The French fought the insurgents throughout 1926, bombing Damascus once again, this time meeting with greater success, and by mid-1927 most of the trouble had died out.\n\nJabal ad-Durūz was henceforth kept under tighter French control; high officials, such as the governor, were no longer elected but appointed and most often were French. The natural tendency of the Druze to isolationism was encouraged in order to keep them free of Arab nationalism but dependent on the French for their security.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Amy Tikkanen."
