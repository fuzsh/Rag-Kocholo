        "text": "In Syria, the Druze are primarily found in the southern regions, including the Jabal al-Druze mountain range. The city of Suwayda is a major center for the Druze population in Syria. In Israel (Palestinian Territory), the Druze have a significant presence, with communities in the Galilee, Mount Carmel, and the Golan Heights. The city of Daliyat al-Karmel, situated on Mount Carmel, is home to a large Druze population.\n\nBeyond the Middle East, the Druze diaspora has led to communities in various countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and Latin America. However, the majority of the Druze population resides in the traditional areas of the Levant, where their historical roots and cultural practices are deeply embedded in the landscape."
