Algiers' efforts to reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged the country into a severe recession. In 1989, the government launched a comprehensive, IMF-supported program to achieve economic stabilization and to introduce market mechanisms into the economy. Despite substantial progress toward economic adjustment, in 1992 the reform drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political turmoil. In September 1993, a new government was formed, and one priority was the resumption and acceleration of the structural adjustment process. Buffeted by the slump in world oil prices and burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994. Following a Paris Club debt rescheduling in 1995, a robust harvest, and elevated oil prices, the economy experienced a strong recovery and key economic improvements. Recent and planned investments in developing hydrocarbon resources are likely to increase growth and export earnings.\n\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $171 billion (2000 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate: 5% (2000 est.)\n\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $5,500 (2000 est.)\n\nGDP - composition by sector:\n\nagriculture: 11%\n\nindustry:37%\n\nservices: 52% (1999 est.)\n\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 2% (2000 est.)\n\nLabor force:\n\ntotal: 7.8 million (1996 est.)\n\nby occupation: ggovernment 29%, agriculture 25%, construction and public works 15%, industry 11%, other 20% (1996 est.)\n\nUnemployment rate: 30% (1999 est.)\n\nBudget:\n\nrevenues :$15.8 billion\n\nexpenditures:expenditures: $16 billion, including capital expenditures of $5.3 billion (2001 est.)\n\nIndustries: petroleum, light industries, natural gas, mining, electrical, petrochemical, food processing\n\nIndustrial production growth rate:7% (1999 est.)\n\nElectricity - capacity: 6.01 million kW (1994)\n\nElectricity - production: 23.215 billion kWh (1999)\n\nElectricity - consumption per capita: 583 kWh (1995 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products: wheat, barley, oats, grapes, olives, citrus, fruits; sheep, cattle\n\nExports:\n\ntotal value:$19.6 billion (f.o.b., 2000 est.)\n\ncommodities: petroleum and natural gas 97%\n\npartners:Italy 22%, US 15%, France 12%, Spain 11%, Brazil 8%, Netherlands 5% (1999)\n\nImports:\n\ntotal value :$9.2 billion (f.o.b., 2000 est.)\n\ncommodities: capital goods, food and beverages, consumer goods\n\npartners:France 30%, Italy 9%, Germany 7%, Spain 6%, US 5%, Turkey 5% (1999)\n\nDebt - external:$25 billion (2000 est.)\n\nEconomic aid:\n\nrecipient: ODA,$100 million (1999 est.)\n\nCurrency: 1 Algerian dinar (DA) = 100 centimes\n\nExchange rates: Algerian dinars per US dollar - 74,813 (January 2001), 75.260 (2000), 66.574 (1999), 58.739 (1998), 57.707 (1997), 54.749 (1996)\n\nFiscal year: calendar year\n\nCommunications\n\nTelephones:2.3 million (1998)\n\nTelephone system:\n\ndomestic: good service in north but sparse in south; domestic satellite system with 12 earth stations (20 additional domestic earth stations are planned)\n\ninternational: 5 submarine cables; microwave radio relay to Italy, France, Spain, Morocco, and Tunisia; coaxial cable to Morocco and Tunisia; participant in Medarabtel; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (1 Atlantic Ocean and 1 Indian Ocean), 1 Intersputnik, and 1 Arabsat\n\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 25, FM 1, shortwave 8 (1999)\n\nRadios: 67.1 million (1997)\n\nTelevision broadcast stations: 46 (plus 216 repeaters) (1995)\n\nTelevisions: 3.1 million (1997)\n\nTransportation\n\nRailways:\n\ntotal : 4,820 km\n\nstandard gauge: 3,664 km 1.435-m gauge (301 km electrified; 215 km double-track)\n\nnarrow gauge: 1,156 km 1.055-m gauge\n\nHighways:\n\ntotal: 104,000 km\n\npaved : 71,656 km (including 640 km of expressways)\n\nunpaved: 32,344 km (1996 est.)\n\nPipelines: crude oil 6,612 km; petroleum products 298 km; natural gas 2,948 km\n\nPorts and harbors: Algiers, Annaba, Arzew, Bejaia, Beni Saf, Dellys, Djendjene, Ghazaouet, Jijel, Mostaganem, Oran, Skikda, Tenes\n\nMerchant marine:\n\ntotal : total: 73 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 896,911 GRT/1,047,991 DWT\n\nships by type: bulk 9, cargo 25, chemical tanker 7, liquefied gas 10, petroleum tanker 4, roll on/roll off 13, short-sea passenger 4, specialized tanker 1 (2000 est.)\n\nAirports: 135 (2000 est.)\n\nAirports - with paved runways:\n\ntotal: 51\n\nover 3,047 m: 8\n\n2,438 to 3,047 m : 24\n\n1,524 to 2,437 m: 13\n\n914 to 1,523 m: 4\n\nunder 914 m: 1 (2000 est.)\n\nAirports - with unpaved runways:\n\ntotal: 84\n\n2,438 to 3,047 m : 3\n\n1,524 to 2,437 m: 23\n\n914 to 1,523 m:18 (2000 est.)\n\nHeliports: 1 (2000 est.)\n\nMilitary\n\nMilitary branches: National Popular Army, Navy, Air Force, Territorial Air Defense, National Gendarmerie\n\nMilitary manpower - military age: 19 years of age\n\nMilitary manpower - availability:\n\nmales age 15-49: 8,794,622 (2001 est.)\n\nMilitary manpower - fit for military service:\n\nmales: 5,383,770 (2001 est.)\n\nMilitary manpower - reaching military age annually:\n\nmales: 388,939 (2001 est.)\n\nMilitary expenditures - dollar figure: $1.87 billion (FY99)\n\nMilitary expenditures - percent of GDP: 4.1% (FY99)\n\nTransnational Issues"
