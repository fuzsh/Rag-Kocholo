        "text": "By Lamine Chikhi and Hamid Ould Ahmed\n\nALGIERS (Reuters) - An Algerian court has summoned former Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia and current Finance Minister Mohamed Loukal, two close associates of former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, in a probe into the wasting of public money, state TV said on Saturday.\n\nThey are being investigated over \"dissipation of public money\" and \"illegal privilege,\" state TV said.\n\nNo other details were immediately available.\n\nThe move comes after army chief, Lieutenant General Gaid Salah, said last week he expected members of the ruling elite in the major oil and natural gas-producing country to be prosecuted for corruption.\n\nBouteflika stepped down two weeks ago after 20 years in power, bowing to pressure from the army and weeks of demonstrations mainly by young people seeking change in the country.\n\nBut the protests, which began on Feb. 22 and have been largely peaceful, have continued as many want the removal of an elite that has governed Algeria since independence from France in 1962 and the prosecution of people they see as corrupt.\n\nOuyahia served several times as prime minister under Bouteflika and also heads the RND party, the coalition partner of Bouteflika's ruling FLN party.\n\nLoukal was central bank governor under the former president.\n\nBouteflika has been replaced by Abdelkader Bensalah, head of the upper house of parliament, as interim president for 90 days until a presidential election on July 4.\n\nHundreds of thousands protested on Friday to demand the resignation of Bensalah and other top officials.\n\nBensalah appointed Ammar Haiwani as acting central bank governor, state TV earlier said. The position had been vacant since Loukal was made finance minister by Bouteflika before he had resigned.\n\nThe army has so far patiently monitored the mostly peaceful protests that at times have swelled to hundreds of thousands of people. It remains the most powerful institution in Algeria, having swayed politics from the shadows for decades.\n\nOn Tuesday Salah said the military was considering all options to resolve the national political crisis and warned that \"time is running out.\"\n\nIt was a hint that the military was losing patience with the popular upheaval shaking Algeria, a major oil and natural-gas exporter and an important security partner for the West against Islamist militants in north and west Africa.\n\nSalah did not specify measures the army could take but added, \"We have no ambition but to protect our nation.\"\n\n(Reporting by Hesham Hajali, Lamine Chikhi and Hamid Ould AhmedWriting by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Richard Chang)"
