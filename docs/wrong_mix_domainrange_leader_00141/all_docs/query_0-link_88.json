        "text": "By examining the events of the Arab uprisings, this paper looks into the nature and dynamics of armies’ responses to popular uprisings. It argues that the outcome of the massive, regime-threatening Arab revolts in 2011 can be assessed by how a military responded to protests: did the army shoot protesters, did it stay idle, or did it largely defect? In light of the rich literature available on the historical experience of the “Arab Spring,” this paper shows that an army’s response to end popular uprisings in authoritarian regimes is determined by several key factors: the military’s level of institutionalization; its relationship to the regime; the degree of the regime’s legitimacy; the amount of international aid it receives; the prospects of foreign intervention; and, finally, the strength of the army’s bond with society and its perception of its own role within society. Additionally, there is a factor often overlooked by scholars; namely, how the military assesses a regime’s capacity to solve the crisis in order to triumph. The paper draws on evidence from the six cases of the 2011 Arab Spring—Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, Yemen, Libya, and Tunisia—to illustrate the dynamics of troop loyalty or defection.\n\nThis paper examines the Arab spring which was spring-rolled by the self-immolation of Mohammed Bouazizi in Tunisia in December 2010 and spread like wild fire across the Middle East. It focuses on the origin of the revolution and chronologically highlights the various revolutions in the Middle East. This study made extensive use of secondary sources such as books and journals. It also made use of periodicals like newspapers and magazines. Findings in the paper reveals that the Arab spring which is supposedly to usher in a just, respected, democratic, egalitarian and an economic prosperous nations was not successful. It argues that if about five years after the ‘revolution’, the much needed peaceful coexistence, economic boom and freedom of expression has not been achieved, the revolution was a failure. The paper further argues that rather than achieving its goals, the ‘revolution’ set the nations further backwards. In the final analysis, the paper submits that revolutions should have a genuine cause and the conviction should come from within and not as a result of external pressure or when the need does not arise.\n\nThe paper provides an account of Arab Spring origin, ideology and demands of civil society. The political turmoil in the Arab world challenged the political status quo of Middle East and North Africa. Arab Spring is the fundamental event in the Arab world history. It also describes the role of well educated youth and power of social media in Arab Spring. It further explains the demonstrations at Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Libya and Syria in details. Specifically, the paper spotlights on the relative deprivation theory of Ted Robert Gurr to illustrate why Arab Spring emerged. Relative deprivation theory has been used to clarify how socio-economic shortages (unemployment, education and poverty) and political inefficiencies lead to collective turmoil. The answer provides a clue to resolve the current problem."
