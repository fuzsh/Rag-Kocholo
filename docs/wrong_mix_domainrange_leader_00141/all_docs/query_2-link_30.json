        "text": "Thousands of people have taken to the streets of the Algerian capital, Algiers, to protest against Thursday's presidential election.\n\nThey briefly overran a polling station. An attempt by police to disperse the crowd failed.\n\nTwo more voting centres were stormed in the Kabylie region, east of the capital.\n\nThe vote follows the ousting of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was forced to resign in April.\n\nHe had been in power for two decades, but was ousted following anti-government demonstrations across the country.\n\nThe protesters have continued to demand the sweeping away of Algeria's entire political establishment, and they are boycotting the election.\n\nAll five candidates standing were closely linked with the rule of ex-President Bouteflika.\n\nWhy are people unhappy?\n\nFor close to a year, thousands of Algerians have protested every Friday in Algiers and other cities across the country against any elections under the current government.\n\nThey want all officials associated with the regime of ousted President Bouteflika to be removed from office, including interim President Abdelkader Bensalah and Prime Minister Nouredine Bedoui.\n\n\"No election with the gangs\", \"they must all be removed\" protesters have chanted week after week, referring to the politicians and businessmen in the inner circle of the ousted president who they see as corrupt.\n\nThey say new faces must be brought in to organise \"real elections\" in a country where the winner of presidential elections has always been easy to guess.\n\nAny election under the current government would be seen as a mere resuscitation of the old regime protesters have been fighting against.\n\nThe election in numbers\n\n24,474,000 registered voters\n\nOf these, 914,000 are registered to vote abroad\n\n61,014 polling stations across the country\n\n135 mobile polling stations catering for Algeria's nomads in the southern desert region\n\nSource: Electoral commission\n\nMany protesters say Mr Bensalah and Mr Bedoui cannot be trusted to secure a free and transparent election because they have benefitted from former President Bouteflika's rule.\n\nBut army chief Gen Ahmed Gaid Salah, the county's de facto leader insisted that the election go ahead if Algeria is to avoid \"chaos\".\n\nDespite clampdowns by the authorities, anti-election protests have taken hold across the country, making it difficult for candidates to engage with voters in the streets or in open-air rallies.\n\nSkirmishes between campaigners and anti-election protesters have marred electoral campaigns in some cities.\n\nWho is running for president?\n\nAll five candidates in Algeria's presidential elections have served under former President Bouteflika or his FLN party:\n\nAli Benflis, 75, is a former Bouteflika loyalist-turned-rival. He served as the ousted leader's chief of staff and prime minister for three years, later running against him and losing in 2004 and 2014\n\nAbdelmadjid Tebboune, 74, rose from a long career as a civil servant to become prime minister in 2017 but lasted just seven months because of a conflict with influential businessmen. He also served as housing minister and information minister\n\nAzzedine Mihoubi, 60, is the interim leader of parliament's second-largest party, RND, which backed President Bouteflika in a ruling coalition. Previous posts included culture and information minister\n\nAbdelkader Bengrina, 57, is a founder of the Islamist party, MSP. He served as tourism minister in a coalition of parties backing Mr Bouteflika before creating his own party, El-Bina\n\nAbdelaziz Belaïd, 56, made his name in the FLN's youth organisation. He went on to become an MP before creating his own party, and ran for president in 2014\n\nA candidate needs more than 50% of the vote to be declared the winner, otherwise there will be a second round.\n\nWas there a TV debate?\n\nYes. For the first time in Algeria presidential candidates took part in a live TV debate, but many viewers were left unimpressed.\n\nA panel of journalists representing the main public and private news organisations in the country took part in the show on 6 December.\n\nIt was run by the state broadcaster and also aired by commercial channels.\n\nAllow Google YouTube content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Google YouTube . We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to read and before accepting. To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.\n\nExperts and observers slammed the event for a lack of real debate and robust questioning of the candidates.\n\nWhat do the candidates promise?\n\nIn their statements, all five presidential hopefuls have sought to distance themselves as much as they could from the ousted president and his inner circle.\n\nThey have also agreed \"to meet the demands of the protesters\" from their first day in office.\n\nMr Tebboune has promised to pursue taxpayer money \"stolen and hidden abroad\". Similarly, Mr Belaid says fighting corruption will be his priority if elected.\n\nMr Bengrina says too many of those in office are old men and he wants to see a \"government of youth\". Mr Benflis, meanwhile, wants to reduce the age requirement to run for public office.\n\nMr Mihoubi promises to improve Algeria's economy by focusing on agriculture and renewable energies.\n\nWho is the front-runner?\n\nUnlike Algeria's previous presidential elections there is no obvious front-runner this time around.\n\nBut experience and political support would put Mr Benflis, Mr Tebboune and Mr Mihoubi ahead of the rest.\n\nMr Tebboune has been dubbed \"the chosen one\" by social media users who see him as close to army chief Gen Salah. But the presidential hopeful was dealt a blow when his son appeared in court last week in connection with a high-profile corruption and cocaine-trafficking case.\n\nMs Benflis, meanwhile, has always struggled to distance himself from the Bouteflika regime in the eyes of the general public.\n\nFor years he was a close ally of the ousted leader and a promoter of his policies, despite a disagreement between the two.\n\nMr Mihoubi arguably has less baggage, and has not been linked to cases of corruption and financial scandals. Yet there is the burden of association with his RND party's disgraced former leader Ahmed Ouyahia, who has been jailed for corruption.\n\nFind out more about Algeria:\n\nWill the vote be undermined?\n\nIn massive demonstrations across Algeria, citizens have once again been calling this election a sham.\n\nThe authorities decided to go ahead with the vote despite massive popular resistance. But low participation would certainly damage the future president's legitimacy.\n\nThe vote was originally scheduled for June 2019 but was cancelled due to a lack of candidates. Army chief Gen Salah has repeatedly said the election must not be delayed a second time.\n\nIn the days ahead of the vote, reports have emerged of angry protesters destroying ballots boxes in some areas of the country.\n\nVoting began on Saturday for the Algerian diaspora. Photos of polling stations opened in consulates and embassies abroad do not show a lot of enthusiasm for the election.\n\nTurnout is likely to be a major challenge for the authorities as people had been more focused on whether the vote would even take place, rather than its possible outcome.\n\nWhat has changed since Bouteflika left?\n\nIt was army chief Gen Salah who triggered the removal President Bouteflika, his former ally, when he called for his office to be vacated. The move was designed to appease nationwide protests against Mr Bouteflika seeking a fifth term.\n\nSince Mr Bouteflika's ousting in April, there have been sweeping arrests of wealthy businessmen and high-profile officials close to the former president and his inner circle.\n\nAn international arrest warrant has been issued against another cabinet minister, Abdesalem Bouchoureb, who is believed to have fled the country. He has been sentenced in absentia to 20 years in prison.\n\nIt is likely these men will appeal against their sentences.\n\nWhile anti-government protesters have celebrated the prosecution of such figures - who they dub \"the gang\" - they remain determined to continue until their demands are met."
