        "text": "The title of this post could be added to the “Algerian wisdom” page as it is a widely known Algerian saying; but I feel many countries do have a similar saying (if they don’t then they should get one) as proven by Gbagbo in CIV, Ezzine who did his best to stay in charge in Tunisia or Mubarak who is still giving it his all to remain the undisputed Zaim.\n\nThe Algerian president is also a fan of this saying as it seems he intends to not leave before death comes. Someone should tell him the saying is only an image and that three mandates are already an eternity for most of us. It is by the way ironic that the candidate who declared in 1999 that his life was behind him, that he had no interest in Power, that if the people did not want him he’d be glad to leave them with their mediocrity; that man changed the constitution and cheated in the elections just to stay in charge of these mediocre people.\n\nBut the problem is in the alternative. And I am not talking here about the genuine alternative which fails to exist so far. I am talking of the visible alternative, that of the opposition parties and of the different associations that exist in the country. This alternative, whether close or not from the Power, is composed of fans of hna ymout kaci.\n\nI decided in this post to look at the different organisations that exist in Algeria, who leads them and since when. The below list is not exhaustive.\n\nAlgerian presidency: Bouteflika (12 years). I guess it would have been longer -perhaps at another position, had he not been ousted after Boumediene’s death.\n\nDRS: Toufik (21 years). He was already playing the puppeteer before the DRS.\n\nMinistry of education: Benbouzid (17 years).\n\nFFS: Da l’Houcine (48 years).\n\nRCD: Said Saadi (22 years). His recent declaration about him wishing to leave but his presence being necessary is funny. Reminds me of the first person in this list.\n\nUGTA: Sidi Said (14 years). I wonder if his predecessor, Abdelhak Benhammouda, would have been still in charge if he hadn’t been killed.\n\nFNA: Moussa Touati (11 years). You’d say it’s not too long but his past is telling: He created the ONEC (organisation of the martyrs’ children) in 1986 which he led till 1992, the year he created the alternate CNEC (coordination of the martyrs’ children) which he led till 2000 (creation of the FNA).\n\nScouts (AMS): Ben Brahem (14 years). He just “won” the “elections” for another mandate.\n\nRND: Ouyahia (11 years).\n\nHMS: Soltani (8 years). Here too, if Nahnah (13 years leading the party) was not dead, I guess he’d still be in charge.\n\nPT: Hanoune (22 years).\n\nAhd54: Fawzi Rebaine (20 years).\n\nI think the list is long enough; I could have added more (ONM, terrorism victims, the disappeared, etc.) I just notice that the FLN had many presidents in the past 20 years, although the power transfer hasn’t always been democratic…"
