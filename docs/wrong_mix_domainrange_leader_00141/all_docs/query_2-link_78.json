        "text": "The supreme court decision against the ally of ex-president Abdelaziz Bouteflika comes a day after another former premier, Ahmed Ouyahia, was also remanded in custody.\n\nThe two politicians are among numerous high-profile figures to be drawn into graft probes since Bouteflika was forced to step down in April following weeks of mass protests.\n\nSellal served as Bouteflika's campaign manager, overseeing the president's past three successful re-election bids.\n\nHe was sacked in March amid mounting public opposition to an attempt to place Bouteflika on the ballot again despite the veteran president's ailing health.\n\nOn Thursday, private channel El Bilad broadcast footage of crowds waiting for Sellal's arrival outside El Harrach prison, in an eastern suburb of the capital Algiers.\n\nBoth Sellal and Ouyahia are being held over cases relating to the misappropriation of public funds, abuse of office and granting undue privileges, according to the official APS news agency.\n\nA former public works minister, Abdelghani Zaalane, also appeared before a supreme court judge on Wednesday and was released under judicial supervision, state media reported.\n\nOn Monday, Algerian authorities also detained an automobile tycoon linked to ousted President Abdelaziz Bouteflika on charges of corruption, one of his lawyers told the Agence France-Presse news agency.\n\nMahieddine Tahkout \"was detained along with his son and two of his brothers on charges of corruption and money laundering\", lawyer Khaled Bourayou said.\n\nThe decision to detain them came a day after they were questioned by an investigative judge, the official APS news agency said.\n\nPrivate media said Tahkout, who holds several foreign car dealerships, was accused of \"undue privileges\" pertaining to the assembly of cars under the rule of Bouteflika, who was forced to step down in April after weeks of protests.\n\nTahkout and the family members run the Tahkout Manufacturing Company (TMC) which assembles vehicles in Algeria for South Korean carmaker Hyundai.\n\nSeveral prominent politicians and businessmen linked to Bouteflika have been detained or questioned in connection with corruption since the ailing president was forced to step down on 3 April.\n\nThe chief of staff of the Algerian army, Ahmed Gaid Saleh, who played a key role in Bouteflika's removal, has previously said that the Algerian justice system \"will open up big corruption casesâ€¦ without restriction or pressure\" regarding what he described as Bouteflika's \"gang\".\n\nMeanwhile, Algeria's interim president Abdelkader Bensalah on Thursday called for \"dialogue\" after the authorities ruled out holding a planned election on 4 July.\n\nHe refused to resign from his position despite calls in this regard from protesters.\n\nBensalah urged the political class and civil society in the North African country to hold an \"inclusive dialogue\" aimed at fixing a new date for elections \"as soon as possible\" in a televised address.\n\nAlgeria's constitutional council said on Sunday it was impossible to stage the poll to choose a successor to ousted president Abdelaziz Bouteflika early next month, after the only two candidates were rejected.\n\nThe move comes after weeks of demonstrations intended to pressure political leaders into postponing the vote."
