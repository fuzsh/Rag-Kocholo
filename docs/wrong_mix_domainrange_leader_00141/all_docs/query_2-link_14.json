        "text": "An Algerian court has sentenced two former prime ministers to long jail terms amid a huge corruption investigation.\n\nAhmed Ouyahia was sentenced to 15 years in prison and Abdelmalek Sellal to 12 years.\n\nThey were accused of abusing authority in a car manufacturing embezzlement scandal.\n\nIt was the first time since Algeria's independence from France in 1962 that ex-prime ministers were put on trial.\n\nThe two were allies of long-time President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who resigned amid mass protests in April.\n\nProtesters have continued to call for sweeping reforms, accusing leaders of the governing party of widespread corruption and repression ahead of presidential elections."
