        "text": "ALGIERS — Algerian police tried to push their way into the president’s headquarters Wednesday in an unprecedented protest movement prompted by violence against security forces in the south. The whereabouts of the long-ailing president were unclear.\n\nThe unrest in southern Algeria and protests in the capital come amid concerns that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika is too ill to rule Africa’s largest country, an ally in US efforts against terrorism. Bouteflika, who helped bring stability to Algeria after a decade of bloodshed, has barely been seen in public since his reelection in April.\n\nIn the second day of protests in Algiers, about 300 police officers marched to the president’s office, wearing their blue uniforms but apparently unarmed. Some tried to push their way past the front gate but were stopped by presidential guards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president’s chief of staff, Ahmed Ouyahia, emerged to try to talk to protesters but quickly went back inside after being met with boos and hisses.\n\nThe police demanded to see the prime minister instead. They also sought the resignation of security chief General Abdelghani Hamel, chanting ‘‘Hamel, Get Out!’’\n\nThe protesters are supporting colleagues in the riot-torn southern oasis city Ghardaia, where security forces have reportedly been attacked.\n\nAbout a dozen people have been killed and many shops burned in riots since December, as Berber and Arab communities compete for scarce jobs and housing. Thousands of police have been sent there to quell the violence.\n\nAlgeria often sees small protests by those frustrated by the distribution of the country’s oil and gas wealth, but police have not been known to demonstrate before.\n\nAssociated Press"
