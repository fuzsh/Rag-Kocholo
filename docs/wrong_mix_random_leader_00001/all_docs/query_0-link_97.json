        "text": "This 1891 article from the Czech-American annual journal, Amerikán Národní Kalendář, is translated to English for the first time. This article is part of a continuing effort to conduct a survey, or census of sorts, of all the Czech immigrant communities across America, which 'Amerikán' began with their first edition in 1878. This article, from the 1891 edition provides us with first person accounts of Czech immigrants in four states and 10 unique communities. It is filled with details and surnames.\n\nThis exclusive English translation, by Onward to Our Past Genealogy & History Services Company, from the pages of Volume: XXVII (1904) of the Czech-American annual journal, Amerikán Národní Kalendář, titled \" The Memories of Czech Settlers in America \" features 13 biographies of early Czech immigrants who settled across the United States. Surnames included are Stekl, Safranek, Straka, Cipra (F), Cipra (W), Cernoch, Pivonka, Capkova, Kosnar, Morisak, Blatny, Seyk, and Cerny. Exceptional details for genealogy and history!\n\nIn the 1934 edition of the Czech-American annual journal, Amerikán Národní Kalendář, August Geringer and Sons published an article titled \"From the memories of old Czech settlers in America\". Originally it ran for 26 pages. In translation it ran to 43 pages and is one of our longer translations to date. This article highlights the first person stories of early Czech immigrants to the United States who settled all across the U.S. and one in Canada. It is a marvelous mix of known and unknown, successful and struggling, and more! It is one of our best so far!\n\nCzech penman and newspaperman, Hugo Chotek, was a frequently early contributor to the Czech-American annual journal, Amerikán Národní Kalendář. In 1901, August Geringer, the publisher of Amerikan included the story we just recently translated to English for the first time, \"An interesting chapter in the history of Cleveland\". This article details the community and, as the author calls it, the riot of 1852. Filled with details of an obscure occurrence in Cleveland, this article adds to the history of this city and state."
