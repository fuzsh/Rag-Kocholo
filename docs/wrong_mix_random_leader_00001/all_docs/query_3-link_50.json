He has become best known for his science fiction, including his novel War with the Newts (1936) and play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots, 1920), which introduced the word robot.[1][2] He also wrote many politically charged works dealing with the social turmoil of his time. Influenced by American pragmatic liberalism,[3] he campaigned in favor of free expression and strongly opposed the rise of both fascism and communism in Europe.[4]\n\nQuick Facts Born, Died ...\n\nClose\n\nThough nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature seven times,[6] Čapek never received it. However, several awards commemorate his name,[7][8] such as the Karel Čapek Prize, awarded every other year by the Czech PEN Club for literary work that contributes to reinforcing or maintaining democratic and humanist values in society.[9] He also played a key role in establishing the Czechoslovak PEN Club as a part of International PEN.[10]"
