        "text": "the occasional stamps - the catalogue number A632\n\nIn accordance with § 35 of the Act No. 29/2000 Coll., on the Postal\n\nServices and on Amendments to Other Acts (Act on Postal Services), on\n\n5th May the Ministry of Industry and Trade\n\nhas issued the occasional stamp\n\nEUROPA: Children's Book - Karel Čapek - Dášeňka.\n\nOn 5th May 2010 the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic issued a occasional postage stamp EUROPA: Children's Book - Karel Čapek - Dášeňka. The author of the artistic concept for the stamp is the engraver Václav Kučera.\n\nThis year's central theme for the annual EUROPA issue, announced by the Association of European Public Postal Operators PostEurop, is Children's Book. Dášeňka aneb život štěněte (Dashenka, or the Life of a Puppy) by Karel Čapek is one of the best-known and most popular Czech books, not only with children. Karel Čapek was born in Malé Svatoňovice. His brother, Josef Čapek, was a famous writer, painter and photographer. Dashenka is an example of their frequent cooperation.\n\nAfter his studies, Karel worked as a tutor to the son of Count Lažanský but soon took the position of a journalist, editing several newspapers: Národní listy, Nebojsa, Lidové noviny. He left the latter in 1921 as a protest against the sacking of his brother Josef by the paper's board. For the next two years he was a dramaturg at the Vinohradské Theatre. He was the first president of the Czech PEN Club in 1925-1933. He married his long-time friend, Olga Scheinpflugová, almost at the end of his life. After 1938 he became the target of political attacks. He spent the last years of his life in Stará Huť by Dobříš where he is still commemorated by a monument. He died of pneumonia, several months before his planned arrest by the Gestapo. Dashenka, or the Life of a Puppy s a book more than 70 years old. Iris, Dashenka's mother, was a wire-haired terrier living with Čapek. The book describes Dashenka's birth and early life until the day when she is carried away by her new owners, and a number of other stories (Stories for Dashenka, On Dogs' Habits, On People, etc.). The stories are accompanied by photographs of Dashenka, made by Josef Čapek. Karel Čapek wrote a large number of books, the major including War with the Newts, R.U.R., The White Disease, Krakatit, etc.\n\nA First Day Cover and a commemorative hand stamp will be issued together with the definitive stamp. The envelope features the sitting dog. The envelope is printed in full-colour offset, in particular the colour is black.\n\nFace value: 17.0 CZK\n\nThe catalogue number of the stamp: A632\n\nThe validation of the stamp: since 5th May 2010 till its revocation.\n\nThe issue of this stamp was published at the Postal Bulletin of the Czech Republic, No. 4/2010, 16th April 2010 [PDF, 412 KB] - only in Czech."
