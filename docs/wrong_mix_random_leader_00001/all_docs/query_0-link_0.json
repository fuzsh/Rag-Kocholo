        "text": "Today’s Wiki-est Amazonian Googlies\n\nAcross\n\n1 Fuzzy fruit : KIWI\n\nWhat we call kiwifruit today (and sometimes just “kiwi”) used to be called a Chinese gooseberry. Marketing folks in the fifties decided to call it a “melonette”, and then New Zealand producers adopted the name “kiwifruit”.\n\n16 __ network : NEURAL\n\nIt used to be that “neural network” was just the name given to a network of nerve cells in an organism. In the modern world, the term “neural net” (short for “neural network”) also applies to virtual or electronic devices designed to mimic the function of the human brain, and in particular learning from past experiences.\n\n18 Taper off : WANE\n\nThe verbs “to wax” and “to wane” come from Old English. To wax is to increase gradually in size, strength, intensity or number. To wane is to decrease gradually.\n\nI used to think that the word “taper” was used for a slender candle because said candle was “tapered” in shape, but it’s exactly the opposite. It turns out that our word “tapered” comes from the candle. “Taper” and “tapur” are Old English words meaning “candle”. From these nouns arose the verb “to taper” meaning “shoot up like flame”. This meaning evolved into “become slender” from the idea that a candle’s flame has such a shape.\n\n30 Lasagna ingredient : RICOTTA\n\nRicotta is an Italian cheese made from the milk of a sheep or a cow. It is produced from the whey of the milk, the liquid left after the curds have been separated out (curds are used to make “traditional” cheese). The whey is heated again so that the remaining protein precipitates out, producing ricotta cheese. The word “ricotta” literally means “recooked”, which makes sense to me now …\n\n“Lasagna” was originally the name of a cooking pot, but the term came to mean a dish that was cooked in it. “Lasagna” also became the name of the flat noodle used in the dish. If you order lasagna on the other side of the Atlantic, you’ll notice the “lasagne” spelling, the plural of “lasagna”. The plural is used as there is more than one layer of pasta in the dish.\n\n42 Warlock’s repertoire : SPELLS\n\nA male practitioner of black magic can be referred to as a witch, but also as a warlock. The term “witch” is used predominantly for female sorcerers.\n\n43 Steamed bun : BAO\n\nA baozi (also “bou, bao”) is a steamed, filled bun in Chinese cuisine.\n\n52 Poutine pieces : CURDS\n\nPoutine is a dish that originated in rural Quebec in the late fifties. It is made with french fries covered in a brown gravy sauce, all topped with cheese curds.\n\n59 “If Beale Street Could Talk” actor Colman : DOMINGO\n\nActor Colman Domingo is well known to followers of the zombie television show “Fear the Walking Dead”, on which he plays the villainous Victor Strand. He is the first actor in any of the “The Walking Dead” shows to direct an episode.\n\n“If Beale Street Could Talk” is a 2018 film based on a 1974 novel of the same name by Barry Jenkins. Both novel and movie tell the story of a young woman working to clear the name of her lover, who was wrongfully charged with rape.\n\n69 Former name of the NBA’s Thunder, informally : SONICS\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder NBA team arrived in 2008 after relocating from Seattle, where they were named the SuperSonics. The “Thunder” name was chosen as a reference to Oklahoma City’s exposure to the storms of Tornado Alley, and to the 45th Infantry Division “Thunderbirds” who were headquartered there until 1968.\n\n72 “Scandal” crisis manager Olivia : POPE\n\n“Scandal” is a political drama TV show centered on a former White House Communications Director named Olivia Pope, played by Kerry Washington. Pope has a complicated relationship with her ex-boss President Fitzgerald Grant, and therefore a complicated relationship with the First Lady. I haven’t seen this one …\n\nDown\n\n1 Midwestern people : KAW\n\nThe Kaw (also “Kansa”) Nation are a Native-American people from what is now the Midwestern US. The “Kansa” gave their name to the Kansas River, which in turn gave its name to the state of Kansas.\n\n2 401(k) alternative : IRA\n\nA 401(k) account resembles an IRA in that contributions can be made from a paycheck prior to the deduction of income taxes. A 401(k) differs from an IRA in that it is an employer-sponsored plan, with payments taken by the employer directly from an employee’s paycheck. Additionally, contributions can be fully or partially matched by an employer.\n\n6 Little bit of change : CENT\n\nThe original one-cent coin was introduced in the US in 1793 and was made of 100% copper, giving rise to the nickname “copper”. The composition varied over time, and was 100% bronze up to the 1940s. During WWII there was a shortage of copper to make bronze, so the US Mint switched to zinc-coated steel for production of one-cent coins in 1943. The “steelie” is the only coin ever issued by the US mint that can be picked up by a magnet. Today’s one-cent coin consists mainly of zinc.\n\n8 “Video” singer India.__ : ARIE\n\nIndia Arie (sometimes “india.arie”) is an American soul and R&B singer who was born India Arie Simpson in Denver, Colorado.\n\n13 Dubai’s fed. : UAE\n\nDubai is one of the seven emirates that make up the federation known as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The two largest members of the UAE (geographically) are Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the only two of the seven members that have veto power over UAE policy.\n\n14 Spy-fi film series starring Vin Diesel : XXX\n\n“XXX” is a 2002 action movie that kicked off a whole series of films. Vin Diesel stars in the first movie, playing an extreme sports athlete who, reluctantly, joins the National Security Agency. Never seen it …\n\nVin Diesel is the stage name of actor Mark Sinclair Vincent. He was born in New York City with his twin brother Paul. The twins never knew their father, and their mother is an astrologer. Vincent was given the nickname of “Diesel” by his friends early in his life, as he was said to have a bottomless supply of energy.\n\n22 Capital of Norway : OSLO\n\nThe Norwegian capital of Oslo is located at the northern end of a fjord known as Oslofjord. The fjord is home to 40 islands that lie within the city’s limits. Oslo also has 343 lakes.\n\n26 Many sci-fi characters : ROBOTS\n\nKarel Čapek was a Czech writer noted for his works of science fiction. Čapek’s 1921 play “R.U.R.” is remembered in part for introducing the world to the word “robot”. The words “automaton” and “android” were already in use, but Capek gave us “robot” from the original Czech “robota” meaning “forced labor”. The acronym “R.U.R.”, in the context of the play, stands for “Rossum’s Universal Robots”.\n\n29 Rhyming slogan opposing a Kansas City Chiefs fan gesture : STOP THE CHOP\n\nFans of the Kansas City Chiefs are prone to make the tomahawk chop en masse. The move evokes stereotypical images of Native Americans that were predominant in the past. There is a “stop the chop” movement that aims to remove the offensive gesture from all sports.\n\n45 Bitter enemy : NEMESIS\n\nNemesis was a Greek goddess, the goddess of retribution. Her role was to make pay those individuals who were either haughty or arrogant. In modern parlance, one’s nemesis (plural “nemeses”) is one’s sworn enemy, often someone who is the exact opposite in character but someone who still shares some important characteristics. A nemesis is often someone one cannot seem to beat in competition.\n\n58 “I Put a Spell on You” singer Simone : NINA\n\n“Nina Simone” was the stage name of Eunice Waymon. Simone was very much associated with jazz music, although she really wanted to be a classical musician early in her career. She was inspired by a love for the music of Bach.\n\n“I Put a Spell on You” is a song written and recorded by Screamin’ Jay Hawkins that was released in 1956. Nina Simone recorded a popular cover version that was released in 1965, and re-released in 1969. Another cover version of the song was released in 2010 by Shane MacGowan and Friends, a record that was sold to help Concern Worldwide’s work in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake that killed so many. Included in the list of “friends” was Johnny Depp, playing the guitar.\n\n60 Halfway between midnights : NOON\n\nOur word “noon”, meaning “midday”, comes from the Latin “nona hora” that translates as “ninth hour”. Back in ancient Rome, the “ninth hour” was three in the afternoon. Over the centuries, traditions such as church prayers and “midday” meals shifted from 3 p.m. to 12 p.m., and so “noon” became understood as 12 noon.\n\n65 Word shouted while putting a card down : UNO!\n\nIn my youth I remember being taught a great card game by a German acquaintance of mine, a game called Mau Mau. Years later I discovered that UNO is basically the same game, but played with a purpose-printed deck instead of the regular deck of playing cards that’s used for Mau Mau. I hear that Mau Mau is derived from the game called Crazy Eights."
