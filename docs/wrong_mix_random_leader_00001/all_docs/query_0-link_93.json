        "text": "I asked the addresses, to my surprise encountered between the addresses the Bata factory, a well known company, in that time, not only in Czechoslovakia but even in Canada and Brazil, where branches existed. I sat down and wrote a letter to the director of the Brazil's branch, in the Saint Paul interior. Told that I was a Czech refugee and that I would like to work in Brazil. In two months the answer came:\"We would like to help in your immigration, but the brazilian government demands proof, that you are a good shoemaker, aproved by syndicate.\" I used to buy my shoes in Bata, received once, from a branch in Kridlovice, one shoe-horn as a gift in an inauguration, that I have until today with me and use daily - but I had never made shoes. Told about my problem to Mr. Wetzlinger, that promised to help me. Day after, he gave me a little paper with one name and telephone, was of the Shoemaker Syndicate. I called the indicated number, was of the chief of the syndicate and we marked a day and hour to the attendance. In the agreed hour arrived in the Syndicate and was lead to the chief's office, a tall and thin young man of around 40 years of age with a big moustache. I presented myself and opened my problems. He knew the Bata factory, but had no contact with it. Praised highly Mr. Wetzlinger, that already knew from the war time, they served together. I told that I needed the Attestation to immigration effect. We talked still about the political situation in Czechoslovakia and in Austria and we agreed that my staying in Austria has no future, better to immigrate - Brazil, he told - is a good opportunity - is a country in development and has field of work and enormous possibilities. \"Return in 15 days to make the proof!\".\n\nI returned there in the combined day, a little worried about \"the Proof\", but the syndicalist passed me two papers: the first one was a certificate of a shoes factory - Kunnert in Brno- Czechoslovakia, where I was supposed to have worked in 1945, where I was praised by my excellent work executed, cited my experties and recommended me to the future employer! In the other paper the Syndicate of Shoes confirm that I passed the executed workshop test with excellent performance and professional disembarrassment! \"This costs 200 Schilling and is valid only to immigration effect!\" I payed with joy because these papers guarantee my immigration. Thanked moved and retire relieved. Provided soon two copys and sent registered the originals to the factory director's in Brazil (Batatúba), with due enlightenments.\n\nIt was 1950, and Christmas arrived - what a difference with the last year! I recollected how I was seating alone in a cold little room, writing letters to my brother and father, remembering the beautiful Christmas feasts we had in our childhood in Kridlovice. In that time we waited the first star to be born, we maintained fast all day long until night - as was in our land custom, and at night we seated all around the table - decorated by my mother. We prayed and afterwords toasted fish was served - a carp, with potatoes salad and mayonnaise followed by sweets, beautiful chocolate cake and christmas fruits. It was custom also to cut apples by the middle, to see a little star, that indicates how our future is going to be. After dinner we retired to the room, where mother had lighted the colourful candles and put them in the tree and down the tree were the boxes with presents.\n\nWe made one current with given hands and chanted:\"Narodil-se Kristus-Pán, veselme-se..\" ( The Christ Jesus has been born, rejoice yourselves).\n\n-In my country the celebration is the birth of Jesus Christ and not Father Noel, that we picked in Brazil from North-American custom, and old bearded man who descend from the chimney of the house and bring presents, personaly I found improper to our climate, we do not have snow and there is no chimney in our houses and a religious error, because the feast is the birth of Christ Jesus, ( in the famous portraits painted in the past by Rafael and Tizziano always Christ Jesus appears in the Virgin Mary arms and never Father Noel!)-\n\nOnly after the chant we have permission to pick our presents, then we kiss our father's and mother's hands asking their blessing and thanking by the presents. How much joy to the children and how many beautiful remembrances - Sweet Memories ... At midnight we went all to Mass, where Aleluia was chanted! God's son has been born! Almost always felt snow in Christmas - everything was white, clean and beautiful.\n\nThe 1950 Christmas was very different then the 1949, the Wetzlinger family embellished all the house. In the living room, Mrs. Flora put a beautiful Christmas little tree, adorned with coloured glass balls and silver stripes: We had a wonderful dinner, watered with champaign and liqueur, mount of sweets, chocolates and present to each one. I received one wonderful book about Austria and its cities and places worldly known, richly illustrated that I kept with me until today as one relic. The czech pharmaceutists couple participated also but as they did not speak german I had the duty to interpret the conversation to german. But everything was joyful, Mr. Wetzlinger turned on the gramophone and we danced by the music's sound of the disks, went to sleep only at late hours. In the New Year the feast repeated. During Christmas and in the New Year we did not work, Americans feasted also and we had ten free days in the Store. In the beginning of January the czech couple departed - Mrs. Flora did not take for less and prepared a beautiful \"Morning Coffee\" with ham, salame, cheese and liqueur as farewell of the sympathetic couple, that immigrate to Australia. I stayed with postal contact by many years with this couple and I received also letters from Mr.Rothe of Munick, Fanny, Sonja Hammer, my brother and my father. In Saltzburg I made also new friends - patrician Karel Háva, who immigrated latter to Venezuela, and Mrs Irene Lettrich, Slovak, sister of the member of the Czech Congress and president of the slovak christ-democratic party, that was also immigrating to the USA, but although of his high political position, he and his sister had to wait the EE.UU's visa. He lived in Munique and his sister in a pension in Saltzburg. She was a middle age woman, little, but extremely sympathetic, but spoke only slovak. How czech and slovak languages are very near, we had no difficulty of communication. She in the beginning was a little reserved, suspicious, because between the political refugees there were many who were not \"political\", fled by other motives, some were even searched by police! But after she knew us better - Karel and I -, she saw that we were rustic in social relationship and she received us as godmother. From her we learned good behauviour in society, how to presented ourselves, how to talk, obliged us to use suit and tie, good shoes, greased, change shirt every day, hold and cut meat with fork and knife, usage of various types of spoons, how to comport in the table, teach us to know classical music, opera, know international artists that frequented the Salzburg Music Festival, order us even to cut the hair and to do the beard everyday - simplely tought us to \" be people\" and not hungry refugees without composure. She was religious, kind and highly cultured.\n\nFrom Brazil I received news, that they sent my certificates and documentation to the Immigration Department, with the affidevit,i.é., guarantee of providing employment arriving in Brazil. Now it was only to wait the IRO's communication and passport. I became glad and also my fellow of service - the old Pap - his name was Gustav Fuchs, but everybody, even the Americans, called him the Pap. He smoked a little pipe - out of service and in the bathroom, in the store it was prohibited to smoke.\n\nIn the service everything runned well, the Americans liked me, in house the Wetzlinger treated me as one family member and the children asked my help in school tasks. Every Saturday I had to participate of the \"big choop\" and dinner in a restaurant. The Pap told me his adventures in Brazil, alligator huntings, the wonders of Rio de Janeiro. Saint Paul in that time was yet a little city, but Rio and the Court, there life was good! In this way the good 1951 was passing, in August participated of a music Festival, watched with Karel many conserts and operas, although in that time was not yet a classical music appreciator - this I learned later with my brasilian wife who was a lyric singer and knew music profoundly.\n\nIn the store something unexpected happened: The office's chief suffered an attack and in days died. He was a Lithuanian, around 60 years, also refugee and the Americans thought that I was the only one that could substitute him. The store manager called me and communicate that from tomorrow on my chair will be in the office, he presented me to the secretary and other funcionarys, desired me good luck and offered himself in any help of his part. I did not become very happy with the unexpected promotion, because I did not know the service executed by the older chief, mainly the monthly reports. And more, charged me of representation, together with the secretary, of the US Army Deposit - The Clothing Sales Stores - the Store - in the exequies of the departed chief. There I soon saw two problems: I need a black suit and tie and to provide a wreath of flowers with dedicatory strip, and worse of all: in Austria it was custom to pronunciate a funeral discourse in the dead grave! I was none Cicero to improvise a discourse and even more, badly knew the dead and did not know anything of his life, only that he was a refugee like me and that he was a Lithuanian...\n\nMy secretary was Italian, originary of the Módena city, in the North of Italy, told me to call her Teresa, that this was not her true name, but that had motives not to be called by her true name. She told me she was 20 years of age, single - she was a very beautiful blond girl and super intelligent. She talked good english and german with a light foreign accent. When I told her my difficulties and problems, she looked at me with that blue eyes and told: Ulli, you are a chief and must manage, what You are going to say is correct, the others are wrong. As for your suit and tie we are going to rent, the wreath of flowers with strip I am going to provide. She picked up the telephone and in five minutes resolved all the problems. Indicated me the address to rent the dark suit and tie, also the shoes, ordered the corbeil of flowers, combined the prices and delivery, the stripe saying and as for the discourse, let to me. Opened the office's file and pick up the dead's curriculum and prepared the dates and little details and she passed them to me. In the foundation of these data I was able to cite some curiosities: The dead was of noble descendant, spoke six languages, had properties that were confiscated during the war, had wife and one daughter, had 64 years, suffered of the heart. I prepared the discourse, and yet that night went to the dead's residence to give the condolences to the family. He lived in a big house in the surroundings of Salzburg, in rang the bell a servent attended, that order us to enter and presented us to the widow, she took us to a noble saloon with crystal lustres and big pictures in the wall. Showed us the family photographs, of the confiscated properties and other curiosities. Order coffee and \"petty-four\" and talked about various subjects. The daughter was a doctor formed in Switzerland, was expected at night to the funeral. We thanked the widow by her kindness and sad farewell (Teresa, me and one more austrian functionary that worked in our office). In the funeral everything went well, I read the discourse that Tereza prepared and typewrited. Teresa showed herself to be a perfect secretary, good typewriter, good reasoning, was not tender and as a good italian called names, but got on well with me, only never signed documents, kept some secret... When the time came of the reports I noticed that my auxiliary persons knew well their jobs, each one made his part, that passed to me, I put the visa in every page and transfered to Teresa, that collect every page and wrote the \"Cover-letter\" and passed the report to the store chief, that by his time made his report of personal point of view, rubricated all and sent by messenger to \"Headquarter\".\n\nIn principle of October I received in home one urgent call, to attend in the IRO's offices. Next day I went there and received the communication that my immigration's documents to Brasil were already there and I was lead to another office - in the backyard - and there I received the passport and the immigration's card and detailed instructions: november 19, 1951, I must attend with a maximum of two parcels of baggage in the Salzburg railway and embark in an express train to Genova, Italy. The train would depart at 11 o' clock morning, but I must appear two hours early to receive final instructions. I was led also to the medical department, where I was summarily examed and received two vaccines against yellow fever and another - I do not remember against what. By one side I was happy that my Odyssey was coming to an end, but sad, that I had to leave the Wetzlinger family, where I felt so well, leave a good work and all friends that I conquered at so much cost.\n\nFirst I communicate the news at home - was a total crying, children, Mrs. Flora and even Mr. Wetzlinger was commoved. In the office idem, I asked for demission to the chief and showed him my IRO's papers. He asked me until when I could stay, answered to the end of the month, because I will need to prepare to travel, buy cases, adequate clothes ( Paps was glad that I am going to Brasil and recommended to buy a white suit, photograph machine and binocles.) I asked the chief if I could buy some american clothes in the store: \"khaki\" shirts, underware and stockings. He authorized, made a Selling Note and signed. He charged nothing. Asked me to choose a person that must stay in my place and to teach him the work. I choose a Law student, that was my auxiliary person and look me as more indicate. In the last day work, November the third, the chief order Teresa to write one recommendation letter \"To whom it may interest\", he asked for various copies and signed. This letter was for me of great utility in the search by the first services in Brasil. The name of the chief was CWO Orel E. Markin Jr. - was one great man!\n\nMy store fellows combined a farewell party in a restaurant at night. The chief excused himself that had a travel marked that day, but indicate a substitute to chief the feast and pay the bill! The farewell party was scheduled to saturday night november 17,1951.\n\nIn the party, all my fellows of the Store were present, even the american soldiers. The men were all more at easy drinking glasses of whisky with coca-cola, beer and eating sandwiches, \"hot-dogs\", mayonnaise salad. The girls were more moderate and drinked soft-drinks and beer. At four o'clock at night I decided to go, I told farewell one by one, each one had something agreeable to say, received many kisses and embraces of the girls, all asked me to write, desired me good travel and many thanked me - specially the Americans by the beautiful work and collaboration in the services execution. I went out of the restaurant moved, in the street a cold rain was falling, autumn came. I picked up a cab and went home.\n\nI forgot to tell one more important encounter, one week before my departure: I was passing in the city by Getreidegasse and remembered, that during my staying in Salzburg I had not visited the museum, installed in the native house of Mozzart, and resolved to enter. But in the entrance door I met the patrician Oldrich, the one that crossed the Austrian frontier in one boat without oars, pushing the boat with the family within, while swiming. We complimented each other happily and he asked me about my immigration situation. I told him that already received the Brasil's papers and that I am going to travel in the next days. I said to him also that I was going to see the Mozzart museum and he told me: \"I just stop seeing the house, there is nothing interesting, there is an old piano and some partiturs written by him, but all falling in pieces....come with me to the square, I have there my office with an austrian partner and we make plants of the new city to be build.\"\n\nThen I went with him to the office and we talked. He asked me where I am going to work, I told him of the Bata factory in Saint Paul's interior, Brasil, then he told me:\" I have an address of a patrician, a friend of mine, he is married and has two sons, he wrote me that he rent a big house in Saint Paul, in the Lapa neighbourhood. He can help you in the first days!\" He seated and wrote a letter to him, presenting me and recommending to help me in whatever necessary. \"His name is Josef Burda - the family is from Prague\" - told Oldrich. Then he gave me the letter with address and I put it in my pocket. There, while talking, his family came and then I met also his wife and their two little sons. We drinked together a beer and then told farewell and never more I had news about him, I do not know if he stayed in Austria or immigrated...\n\nI made up my suitcases - the white suit I did not find in all Salzburg, a tailor offered himself to do but it would take eight days and this would not be yet. The \"Pap\" told me, that I would find white suits in Saint Paul, less expensives. The \"D\" day came - monday, november 19, 1951, day of my departure from Saltzburg, three years after going out of Trebitsch...Mrs. Flora prepared the traditional \"Farewell Coffee\": beyond the coffe there was also slices of black and white bread, ham, salami, a nice cake - the french champagne did not lack. After ending the digestion of a certain portion of the \"Petit-dejeuner\", Mr. Wetzlinger called two taxis, one for me and the baggage and other to all family. We all followed in the railway direction, there I found in a balcony one IRO representative with the papers and documentation, passport and the travel instructions until Genova, Italy, where I must embark in the Campana ship -another instructions I would receive in Genova. All trip was payed by IRO, but we received even more 100 dollars to eventual expenses. I had saved another 300 dollars to the first expenses in Brasil. In the Santos city, Brasil, the IRO responsability ended and from there on by our own count... Ending this formal part, I returned to the little group of the lovely Wetzlinger family, that so much did to my wellfare and while waiting the South Express coming, that would take us to Genova, we yet talked a little, made plans of next Saltzburg visit to a new encounter - I already rich, independent - that \"Dreams Castles\", false promises we made in a farewell! In true, 30 years later, I passed with my wife \"In nuptials travel\" - after 25 years of marriage - we passed by the Salzburg station, where our Express followed from Vienna to Munchen, stopped ten minutes in the station. I opened the train window and looked to see if I recognized somebody, or something knew, but after 30 years I had no news of the Wetzlinger family, or of their sons. Time delete everything - even the memorys! Written was year 1982! But returning in time - 1951, with the train whistle and some more kisses, embraces, desires of good travel. With tears in the eyes I entered in the parked train, the big baggage went in a special van - I went up with a little valise and a documents folder and seated in one of the vacant banks. Besides, with me another patrician went up, he presented himself as Erwin Fuchs and also followed to Brasil, his profession was an \"animal dealer\". I looked by windows, my family was giving good-bye with white handkerchiefs, the train whistled and moved slowly. \"Good-bye Salzburg\" - where I suffered so much in the first part and I had so many joys in the second part of my staying. Soon the train accelerated and sooner the white handkerchiefs disappeared of sight. The voyage to the italian port begun... Moved I seated in the bank and began to remind... but my fellow Erwin was of the talker type, talking all the time, did not give me peace, made dozens of questions, I answered in \"half-mouth\" to sense that I did not want conversation now, but did not matter, he did not stop talking.\n\nThe express stopped only in the big stations and even for little time. In one of that stops entered in our cabin an old lady, she asked license to stay in our company, cause the other part of the train was full. We explained to her that this part of the train was reserved to IRO immigrants and that need the train supervisor's autorization. She was Italian, from Milano, but talked fluent german and english also. She told that this she resolved very soon and asked the conductor to call the supervisor, that soon appeared and told him that she was old and that would like to stay in our cabin, and the supervisor told her that depended of our authorization. We naturally consented, and in this way she stayed in our company and we liked her. She was of good apearance, told us she was widow and that was going to visit her daughter in Genova. Soon we started to like her, was intelligent, cult, knew well the region where our train was passing. This region was a part of the Alphs, in the division of Germany and Italy, (-very beautiful region where I travel again, thirty one years later, with my wife-). The train followed one series of very high bridges, and tunnels that looked like without end, the mountains were already covered with snow and ice and down there valleys appeared still green- this magnificent contrast, impressive! I remembered of one excursion made, during my Munick staying, to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, where we went upstairs of air streetcar in the Zugspitze top, 2960 meters.... Memory, sweet memories!\n\nThe sympathetic lady told us she was Jew and was in the concentration camp (showed us the number engraved in her forearm), she knew well classic music and was frequenter of Milano's Scale Opera. She told us the fascism history in Italy, the end of Mussolini and his lover, the bad luck of the Ciano Count. This Count was an excellent diplomat and Exterior Minister during the Mussoline government, even married with the daughter of the italian dictator, but was denounced and arrested in the end of the war by the german SS, because used to give information to the Allies. He was sent to the Dachau Concentration Camp and hang one day before the liberation of the camp by the Americans! This and other histories had this lady to tell us, everything of first hand!\n\nOur South Express arrived at midnight in Veneza (a strange way to arrive in Genova!) It was moonlit night and our train passed by the hillside above the sea. This for me was very exciting, by the first time in life I saw the sea - how many readen histories since my boyhood: Robinson Crusoe, Mount Chirst Count, Wooden Leg Pirate, and many other books that I had devoured about trips throughout the sea. The train stopped in the Central Veneza station and the loudspeaker communicate that because of technical motives will be waiting one hour. Our companion of voyage told that she would be taking a nap in the coupé, so Erwin and I resolved to get out off the train and stretch out the legs. The station was almost empty, only the funcionarys and the technicians moving in the platform. We spyed by the opposite train door, there was a district- in this hour silent and empty. In front passed a channel in the sea direction: Resolved to explore, came down the stair to the water, wet the hand and taste it - was salt, was from the sea! I did not believe, we were at sea-shore, felt like Columbus discovering the New World! We did not attempt to stay away from the train, returned to our cabin and told our experiences to our companion. She laughed and told: \"From now on you will see a lot of sea\". We waited two more hours in Veneza, finally the loudspeaker announced the departure, hearing whistles and our convoy begun to move, followed to Genova. We passed by the mountain region, saw some lakes, but the sea returned to be seen nearby 10 o' clock , nearing our final train point: Genova.We give farewell to our companion and went down in the station, dragging our suitcases. A IRO funcionary acompanied us to a pension, where the lunch was served: \"La massa\" with meat peaces with sauce and to drink wine - nothing of water, water was rationed, in the taps only very early and at night after 10 o' clock. Water to drink was kept in a cupboard in porcelain jars and had to ask a cup to the pension owner. There was no water, at least it would last only three days, until our departure...\n\nIn the afternoon we went to see the city, Genova was in its center a middle age city. In a square, with sight to the sea, there was the statue of the most famous citizen - Christopher Columbus, he was born here and becoming man he immigrated to Spain and Portugal, both in the epoch domained the seas! The statue represented a man of middle age, long hair, looking in the sea direction with one hand protecting the eyes from the solar rays and with the other indicating in the direction of the horizon of sea, looking like saying: \"There is the searched Land!\". He was an unhappy man, he went out of his native city still young and travelled to Portugal, where existed in Sagres, in the extreme South of Portugal, the navegation school, founded by the Infante Dom Henrique (1394-1460), son of Dom João and Mrs Filipe of Lancastre. Dom Henrique (Navigator) founded the school to promove portuguese navigators. In this school worked the best european cartographers and astronomers and there studied the most famous portuguese navigators, between them Vasco da Gama, Diogo Cão, Bartolomeu Dias, Fernando Magalhães, Pedro Alvares Cabral and other famous navigators. Even Christopher Colombus studied in this school, he believed that the Earth was round, had read the book \"Million\" of the Venetian's Mark Pole. This book described the riches of the asiatic people: India, Sumatra, Java, Chine and because of the difficulty to reach this regions by land, he found it possible to achieve India by sea, navigating to the West. To this needed ships and mariners, supplies and money. In the Portuguese Court had no success, presented his plan then to the Spanish Court. He arrived in Sevilha at good hour, there were the festivities because of the Muslem expulsion from the Spanish lands. Isabel of Castela and Ferdinando Aragão found the Columbus's plan interesting and supplied to him three ships (the Nina, the Pinta and the Saint Mary) and the equipment. In august 3, 1492 the ships departed to the Canary Islands and afterwards took the West direction. It was not an easy voyage - the marines believed that the ships will fall in an abyss, in accordance with the general creed in the epoch and asked to return. With promises and threats Columbus continued in travelling. Finaly, on October 12, 1492 appeared land in the horizon, it was an island (San Salvador - Bahamas), he was convicted that he had discovered a way to India. Returning to Spain, he was feasted and homaged by Isabel Castela. In the following years he returned to do three more voyages, discovering more islands (Haiti, Cuba and Jamaica) and in the last voyage touched the mouth of the Orinoco river (South America), but thought that it was some Indian river, he returned soon. He would like to be named Vice King of the conquered lands, but there entered in a conflict with the Spanish court. He was shackled and arrested and already sick after his return, he died in 1506, sure of being the founder of a way to India. The Italian navigator Americo Vespucio, that helped Columbus in the second and in the third voyage, travelled all over, with his four ships under spanish banner, the same way and afterwards returned South discovering the Amazon river and continuing to the South until the bay of the Silver river, arrived at the conclusion that Columbus discovered the New World, unknown lands, habitated by indians, some friendly, others warriors. These lands were afterwards called America - in homage to the navigator. The pope Alexander VI, that was spanish ( of the Borges family) declared in 1493, that all lands discovered from now on, will be spanish! This revolted the Portuguese and Dom John III called the squadron naval to defend the portuguese's rights. But the couple Isabel and Aragão preferred an agreement and not a war. In this way, in 1494 the Treaty of Tordesillas was signed, that determined a limit of 370 leagues West of the Green Cable, in a way that legitimate the future discovery in 1500 of Brazil to the portuguese´s ownership. The portuguese navigators were able to circulate the Africa (Bartolomeu Dias and Diogo Cão) and Vasco da Gama was able to achieve India by East. The portuguese became the owners of rich markets in Africa, India and Asia - arrived until China and Japan. I take the chance to quote the words of the great modern portuguese poet:\n\n\" Is to the immense and possible ocean\n\nTaught these Quintas, that here is seen,\n\nThat the ocean with end will be greek or roman:\n\nThe sea without end - is portuguese\"\n\nIn messages \"Padrão\", 13.9.1918 - Fernando Pessoa.\n\nI can not leave without mention in this ocasion another great portuguese navigator - Fernão de Magalhães. He was born in 1480 in the North of Portugal (Sabrosa) - served as a page in Dom John II Court. He set forth in one of the armadas to India, after eight years of fights in India and Africa, hurt in one leg in Morocco in a fight against the Muslem, returned to Portugal, where he presented to D.Manuel I a plan of navigation to Asia, sailing to West. But Dom Manuel was not disposed to listen to a lame navigator´s plans. Offended, Magalhães went directly to the enemy in the epoch - Spain. There, arrived in the throne a young king (17 years), Carlos I. This one was disposed to listen the plans of the old navigator and provided to him 5 ships with 268 men. The ships departed in september 20th, 1519 of the port Sevilha - I am not going to enter in details of this voyage, that looked like a romance, where did not lack treason, revolt, attempt to escape , all well described on the board diary, that was taken in all details by the italian Antonio Pigafetta.\n\nThe scurvy was another great enemy of the navigators because of the lack of fruits and fresh vegetables, men died dozens by day. Dramatic was the search by Magalhães of the passage from South America to the West, that was finally realized in the South extreme (Fire Land), this passage has today his name - Magalhães. Arriving in the Philippines, where Fernando stopped to supply with fresh provisions, was in 1521 brutally murdered by the indigenes. The fleet dispersed themselves in the China sea and only one -\"Victory\" with eighteen survivors! - returned november 8, 1522 to Sevilha - the Antony Pigafetta was among them. It was realized the first circumnavigation in the Earth! The Pigafetta showed proudly his Board Diary, that showed the Victory arrival in Sevilha in November 6 - but there was inscribed day 8- missed one day! Pigafetta swear that jumped no day, give entrance daily- there was no explanation... The navigators of the XV and XVI century where able to determine the latitude in the sea ( from North or South of the Equator), but did not know the longitude (the Meridians), that indicated the distance from East and West of the 0 Meridian - named Greenwich, by the observatory nearby London, England. It was only discovered around 1730, with sextant and octant. In an international agreement there is a \"Data-line\" today, that accompany aproximately the Meridian number 180 in the Pacific Ocean, where the ships and airplanes must change date, the ones who direct themselves from East to West must jump a day (6.11 to 8.11, for instance) and the ones in opposite direction West to East, must count the same day twice (6.11 - 6.11). The earth turns in an astonishing speed - 30,4 Km per second from West to East and gave one turn in 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds. But there the astronomy and space science would take to long considerations and would extend to much this biography.\n\nLet us return to Genova, 1951, written November 23. Great day! I found myself like Columbus before the beginning of the voyage! I got up before 6 o' clock in the morning, making profit of the water that this early lasted yet and dressed myself with my \"khaki\" uniforme as it is proper of New World discoverers!\n\nWoman was making coffee in the kitchen, baker brought little bread hot yet, \"madam\" of the pension appeared and soon called the housemaid's attention because the coffee was not ready in that hour - \"the Sirs are already waiting!\" In truth, it was she who was late... At eight o' clock a boy came, communicating that the truck that would take our baggages - broke! In the house were lodged three patricians and one Polish family, which later went to Argentina. We soon took our baggages and told: \"We are going by foot to the port\", but soon we dragged our bags outside of the house, a truck appeared: a very dark Italian from Sicily appeared in explanations, making gestures as a true Italian, that he would take us and our bags, but as the truck was \"Especialle\", he was going to charge 20 Dollars - by the big bags and 5 - by the little bags! Naturally we reclaim, because it was agreed that the bags would be taken free - until the ship. In the conversation the owner of the pension entered and after many screams, somebody called \"Carabinieri\"! And in truth a police car appeared, two officers came out of the car and asked the reason of the screams: \"Nessum dorma\"! The \"Officialle\" took the word and asked the owner of the pension what was the motive of the quarrel. She explained to the officers the problem and the police asked the Sicilian his documents. The Sicilian, naturally, had no documents and explained that the truck was his cousin´s, who was still asleep and asked him to took it to the lodging-house. He had not even the driver's license! In the end it was arranged that the Carabinieri's car was going to accompanied the truck until the port and we, the passengers, were going to pay the gasoline! We all agreed and then arrived in the port with police escort! Each one of us gave 5 dollars to the Sicilian, that became happy and we smelled in the air some trickery, italian typic: it was all combined - Mrs Carmen, Sicilian man and probably even the police.\n\nBut finally we were in the port, gate number 6. Luggager's men of the port came running, picked up our luggagers and took on board of our Steam, named Campana, a ship of 26 thousand tons of Italian-French property, it was half cargo and half passengers. With our passports and IRO documents in hands we entered in queue aboard, where we received one couch number and naturally the stamp and the Ship Regulation, signed by the captain. The Regulation indicated also the Plan and travel hours, ports where we were going to shore and meals' time. The ship had individual cabinets only for the captain and officers, the sailors and passengers had their couchs downstair the deck, in a big saloon that occupied more than half the ship. One part of the ship was for women and children, another part for men, also the sanitaries. In the deck level there was the kitchen and the restaurant, in the second up level was for officers and marines, prohibited to passangers. The ship's stem was a place to take sunbath and appreciate the landscape - the place where we liked most and also the most sympathetic of the ship - the place of the passenger's meeting, to talk and make acquaintances.\n\nWe went up the ship at ten o' clock in the morning, but the foreseen departure was only at three in the afternoon. Punctually at midday the bell rang at the restaurant, in it there were rectangular big and little tables. We occupied one table together with the polish family, our pension's acquaintances. The family was the mother and two adolescent daughters - the polish husband had already travelled last year and waited the family's arrival in Buenos Aires. It was a sympathetic family, educated and much talking. In the table there were already the plates and various wine bottles - \"Chiante\". Soon came the sailors - that made garçons - with trays of salad and spaghetti. We found the food very good - and the wine also. After lunch we waited our departure, which happened after many whistles of our steamer and other neighbours yet seized - at 15:30 sharp. The ship went very slowly, to deviate of buoys and little boats. I became moved, was going out of Europe - will it be forever? The Genova city, where we stayed for three days, became to disappear, soon we stayed in the open sea, the earth was seen no more and our Campana headed at all steam, dark began to fall, we entered in the restaurant to wait for dinner. A good soap was served, slices of roasted fish, salad - and naturally the Chiante, dessert was ice-cream of fruits. After dinner the garçons soon cleaned the tables, and we went little by little downstair to our lodgings, opened our bags to dress pyjama, made toilletes and soon lied in the couchs, we were tired and in little time slept. I woke up with a more vigorous balance of the ship, got up and looked through the window, the sea was agitated, full of big waves which broke in the walls of our ship. Rained, the sky was dark, I saw a sailor looking the sea, asked in english if it was dangerous, he signed with the head that it was not and went up to the upper deck. I returned to bed and slept, when I woke up and looked through the window, the sky was blue, in the sea the waves were small. In the restaurant's door there was fixed a captain's bulletin, communicating that at 10 o' clock we were going to lash in Marseille, but the passengers must not go out of the ship, because must embark more immigrants and many cargo to the lower deck of the steam."
