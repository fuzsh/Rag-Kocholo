        "text": "AKA: That was the year that was……\n\nTWTYTW 2023\n\nThere’s a sense in which 2023 started out quite well. The global political situation was a least stable, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine in particular stalled, looking as if the contending forces were in it for the long haul; that the front lines have barely moved a year later suggests that’s a very long haul. Of the governments that affect me and my nearest directly, New Zealand and the USA seemed relatively stable and sorted, while in the UK what looked like a relatively stable Sunak government belied barely bound together tensions that turned out to anticipate a year of chaos and increasingly right wing action and rhetoric. Now, at the end of the year we’ve got a settler state’s genocidal military assault being inflicted on a refugee, imprisoned population of several million, a dead duck Tory regime, a reactionary hard-right regime in New Zealand, and a very strong prospect of Trump’s return to power in the USA. I’m resisting the urge to make 2024 the year of the hermit.\n\nCloser to home, the year, again, started out fairly well. Work was stable and as secure as anything can be in contemporary higher education, with assorted publication and research projects on the go, if running a little late. Yet by the end of the year, my boss had resigned and a hiring freeze means that I was doing to jobs (badly) rather than one job adequately, most of the publication projects had stalled, as had the research – but at least that is a sense of static, rather than backwards movement… Even so, there was some fabulous work with doctoral students, with two successfully examined and another three due to submit completed theses in the first few weeks of 2024 – one of which is one of the most exciting and interesting PhDs I have been involved with, where I shall greatly miss the intellectual stimulation and adventure that is our regular discussions of the project and draft sections.\n\nYet, even with that static sense a couple of new projects got off the ground, which is quite exciting. One is more of a revival, where in the wake of that shift of Covid-19 from pandemic to endemic and the changes that flowed form that we have ‘revived’ the Philosophy at Play project after the last conference in Prague in 2019, and have been preparing for P@P6 in Madrid in June 2024. It doesn’t feel like a five year lapse, but it’s good to be re-engaging this area of work and continuing the project with my friend and co-worker of two decades Wendy Russell and others in that posse.\n\nThe new project is one that has developed with co-workers in sport history journals The International Journal of the History of Sport and Sport in History to support early career researchers in central and southern Africa working on sport history topics. This is a three year project, including publications in the two journals, that we hope will lead to a network of Africa-based sports historians and help shift the emphasis away from those of us based in Euro-American universities. So far, it’s proving to be an adventure.\n\nAlong the way there were two publications, one of which I am very happy with, the other I am flattered to be a part of. The first is a special issue of the IJHS dealing with histories of netball which although dated 2022 didn’t hit the world until February 2023. The other is a collection of essays reworked from a previous publication exploring sports history, coloniality, and Indigeneity: Decolonizing Sport is, we hope, a significant intervention in the field.\n\nAlong with this academic work, it’s been an honour and privilege to continue to work with Labour Behind the Label, this year further bedding in our work focusing on garment workers in the UK. This included a mid-September day in Leicester (where many of the UK’s clothing factories are) hearing from garment workers about their working lives and visiting a factory. I have been working with LBL now for seven years and remain in awe of their work and their achievements in building a global fair and responsible garment industry.\n\nOut and About\n\nThe Africa project resulted in some serious travel, but nearly the last outing the the year. Before that there was\n\nA jaunt at the end of May to Washington DC for the annual North American Society of Sports History conference, which is always fun and good for the (academic) soul, with stimulating debates and intriguing ideas. It’s also a chance to hang out with some of my nearest and dearest, wrangle the issues of our discipline, eat well, and generally confabulate, including a fine evening out with the very dear Russell Field and Christine O’Bonsawin – we may not have solved sport history’s problems, but wrestling with them was definitely cathartic. It was also good to see some moves around the work several of us have been doing to address issues linked to equity, belonging, decolonization, and diversity in the field. On top of that I always quite enjoy DC, it’s a haven for museum geeks and bookshopophiles like me.\n\nFrom there it was a skip up the line to Philadelphia to visit kinfolk Roger Clark & Amy Boss, including a day outing to NYC to catch up with more kin, visit MoMA, encounter aliens, and indulge ourselves at the Ice Cream Museum. It was a week of museums, good food, the delights of Philly Pride (with a parade the ended outside Roger & Amy’s building so not a parade where I did much walking), but all rather inhibited by having dropped my laptop on my glasses the night before I left DC, so operating on only one lens and therefore one good eye, making it a week of pirate persona.\n\nNext up was a week in Lausanne in July for anther conference. It’s a lovely if expensive (it is Switzerland after all) town, where it was good to send a couple of non-work days, to meander along the lake and soak up the environment. Part way through my visit I switched to the ‘conference hotel’, which turned out to be one stop closer to the venue than my mid-city hotel, and much less fun than the Ibis Madhouse, where I had been staying. Ah, well….\n\nAnd on the way back from Lausanne I stopped off in Paris after a gorgeous train journey through the Alps for four days of hanging out. It was high tourist season so I opted for some less visited museums, spent an afternoon meandering through the Bois de Boulogne after visiting the Warhol-Basquiat show at Fondation Louis Vuitton, ate a couple of outstanding meals, and visited the Immigration Museum. Train, I think, remains my preferred mode of European transport if I can.\n\nIt seems to have been a year of travel for work only, with then end of August including a few days in Manchester for the British Society for Sports History conference where it was again a pleasure to hang out with Canadian chums Carly Adams and Russell Field, and slope off with Russell for a weekend in Liverpool afterwards – there’s a city I enjoy.\n\nThe last planned big trip of the year then was the first stage of the sports history project which was a week-long residential writing workshop just outside Johannesburg, which was a delight and seemed to go well (it’s always hard mid-project to know exactly how things are going), followed by a week in Cape Town being a bit of a tourist – including a visit to Robben Island, some exploring of the peninsular south of the city, perhaps a vineyard or two, and some work with folks at Stellenbosch University, where earlier this year I’d been awarded an honorary appointment .\n\nUnexpectedly, however, I am writing this from New Zealand after only three weeks back in the UK from South Africa, where I have headed out to because my brother’s long term illness has taken a turn for the worse – this getting old malarkey is sometimes not a lot of fun. We’ll see what happens but there’s no real grounds for confidence.\n\nIt’s not all been flitting around the world though. I’ve had some fabulous weekends in London, occasionally left in sole charge of the grandkids, as well as some time in Hastings at the young one’s ‘country villa’. Among these outings were some fabulous exhibitions, including the superb ‘Crown to Couture’ at Kensington Palace.\n\nBeats\n\nAs always, there’s been some great music, including some delights at my local jazz festival and elsewhere. The jazz festival included a lunch time gig with the incomparable Lizz Wright, and mid-afternoon wild time with Rodrigo y Gabriela, who are sensational and whom I have been trying to get to see for years. I’d had tickets for Lizz Wright for the Covid cancelled festival in 2020, so seeing her was especially sweet. But one of the delights of my local festival is the chance to see new artists, and I was especially wowed by Tamzene whose minimalist piano and delicate voice in places cut to my soul. I then found myself in an end of year quandary with Rodrigo y Gabriela and Larkin Poe playing nearby (Birmingham and Bristol) and only being able to make one…. So I opted for Larkin Poe whose blues inflected Southern rock has been a staple of my playlists for the last several years. While I confess I was a little disappointed the set didn’t include Mad as a Hatter, but it was a helluva way to finish the live music year.\n\nWith recorded music, I have been all over the place – although I note again a high rotate list dominated by women, but not all new releases. I spent a while early in the year rather obsessed by two live performances by Lara Fabian (absolutely not my usual tastes) from around 2000. One was her cover of ‘Je Suis Malade’, a song I remember from the ‘70s as a mediocre piece beloved of the France-is-so-sophisticated gold medallion brigade, but that she seems to have made her own – and it is a spectacular performance, and exceptionally performative. The other was from a couple of years later, one her own, ‘Je T’Aime’, from a concert in Paris, not long after she’d talked quite frankly in an interview about her mental health; again, it’s an astounding, quite haunting, if unexpected performance.\n\nMore contemporary, I have loved\n\nLittle Simz – No Thank You – although not quite up to Introvert, still a superb album\n\nRhiannon Giddens – You’re The One – always on high rotate for me\n\nRodrigo y Gabriela – In Between Thought … A New World – the new album they were touring when I saw them, and fabulous\n\nLizz Wright – Live in Berlin – a perk of the live gig, she had a few for sale which I’d not seen elsewhere\n\nCherise – Calling – continuing my obsession with south London soulful singers, I first heard her live doing jazz classics from ‘the American Songbook’ and remain wowed by her diversity\n\nTamzene – Dublin Sessions – her first EP, oh, for more….\n\nLarkin Poe – Peach, featuring ‘Preachin’ Blues’ – their first album (that I know of) but that I was missing – another merch table perk\n\nPatty Griffin – Home Recordings and Rarities, it’s sparse and pared back, and opens with the fabulous ‘Get Lucky’\n\nJanelle Monáe – The Age of Pleasure\n\nWords\n\nOne of the treats of my local literature festival, aside from a fanboy moment with poet and novelist Liz Acevedo, was an hour in the company of Linton Kwesi Johnson and Paul Gilroy as they discussed Black British politics in the 1970s and ’80s. And as always there’s been a lot of books – where it’s hard to cut back to a top ten, but I almost got there, but there’s a lot more at my Goodreads page. As for the top thirteen, in the order I read them:\n\nCaroline Dodds Pennock – On Savage Shores: How Indigenous Americans Discovered Europe is a superb revisioning of histories of the imperial Americas, focusing on Indigenous peoples’ presence in Europe, reviewed here.\n\nNoViolet Bulawayo – Glory tells a story of the immediate post-liberation years in Zimbabwe and the final part of the Mugabe era through a family not-in-favour with the ZANU leadership; it’s a brutal tale of loss and sacrifice, that I can’t see ZANU-PF welcoming in any way, reviewed here.\n\nNada Elia – Greater Than the Sum of Our Parts: Feminism, Inter/Nationalism and Palestine is a profoundly powerful and important activist based thinking through of Indigeneity, Zionism, solidarity and post-colonial feminism, reviewed here.\n\nTom Humberstone – Suzanne: The Jazz Age Goddess of Tennis didn’t win the book prize I was a judge for this year, sadly, but is a fabulous piece of sports history as graphic novel, reviewed here.\n\nYasmin El-Rifae – Radius: A Story of Feminist Revolution is harrowing, painful, and vital as an insider’s account of the organising against the sexual violence deployed during the Egyptian revolution in 2010/11, and the costs of that violence and resistance; possibly my book of the year, reviewed here.\n\nRivers Solomon – The Deep was an unexpected treat, browsing a south London bookstore when (very) early for a meeting just up the road, exploring a possible world resulting from one of modernity’s greatest crimes, and with it the meaning of history and trauma, reviewed here.\n\nSaidiya Hartman – Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route explores the mass enslavement of Africans, from the coast, inland – it’s poetic, potent, and superb rivalling Radius as my book of 2023, reviewed here.\n\nMargaret D Jacobs – After One Hundred Winters: In Search of Reconciliation on America’s Stolen Lands explores Midwestern history and local acts of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples despite official and widespread denial of the USA’s coloniality, reviewed here.\n\nLamia Ziadé – My Port of Beirut is a beautiful, tragic rendering of the 2020 silo explosion that destroyed large parts of Beirut, telling tales of what was, of survival, and of loss with poetic prose and gentle paintings, reviewed here.\n\nElizabeth Acevedo – Family Lore is Acevedo’s first book for adults, a kind of magical tale of powers, food, preparation for death, and being Dominican in New York; an utter delight, reviewed here.\n\nDavid Toms – Pacemaker is my second challenge to Radius exploring, poetically, elegantly, and painfully life with a chronic heart condition; quite, quite beautiful, reviewed here.\n\nP. Djèlí Clark – Ring Shout is classic Clark, an alt-history in which a group of armed Black women take on the KKK and win; what’s not to like? Reviewed here.\n\nRussell Field – A Night at the Gardens: Class, Gender, and Respectability in 1930s Toronto is my specialist academic title on the list (and not the first by a friend); it is both an impressive social history of an era, and a challenge to my scholarly field to rethink the way we do a sizeable part of our work, reviewed here.\n\nPictures\n\nI heard, I read, but I also watched some fine cinema, starting out early in the year with Till, the tale of Emmett Till’s brutal racist murder, told largely through a focus on his mother Mamie Till-Mobely, played superbly by Danielle Deadwyler, giving powerful insight to an often side-lined aspect of the USA’s Civil Rights Movement. That was followed quite quickly by The Half of It, a delightful, queer, Asian-American take on Cyrano de Bergerac.\n\nThe early part of the year also featured the delightfully odd Meine teuflisch gute Freundin (How to Be Really Bad) in which the devil, sick of daughter’s defiance, banishes her to small town Germany to convert people to evil. By mid-year the mokopuna and I had discovered the Barbican kids film club, as a good way to deal with bad weather grandparenting days, including Long Way North a gorgeous 2D animation about a young Russian girl in the early 20th century who goes searching for her grandfather, missing on an expedition to the Pole.\n\nOther treats during the year included The Swimmers, the biopic of Yusra & Sara Mardini, Syrian swimmers who swam in the refugee team at the Rio Olympic games and became famous after their boat to Greece broke down and they pushed/dragged it to shore. Finally, I was quite wowed by Salt of This Sea exposing the experiences of occupation in Palestine through the tale of a Palestinian-American woman trying to recover her father’s pre-Nakba bank savings.\n\nIt’s a year that has ended with the world in turmoil, notably worse off with news of the death of the journalist John Pilger whose work was, for many, a marker of what journalism should be – sharp, insightful, critical.\n\nThe circumstances mean I’m reminded of a piece by D. Bunyavong:\n\nin hell.\n\nMay our 2024 be better.\n\nTWTYTW 2022\n\nI know full well that the number at the end of the date changes by virtue of an arbitrary decision by a Pope urged to adjust the calendar to account for previous miscalculations of the Earth’s orbit. I know also that globally lived traditions and state systems adhere to the rulings of Julian rather than Gregory XIII, date their beginnings of current time from events other than the supposed date of birth of a Palestinian carpenter’s son, or organise their cycles of time on different bases than having 365¼ unevenly allocated to 12 sub-sets than mean it’s now a Zhaaganaash or Pākehā (or countless other names for whoever might be newcomer-settlers) new year. I know all those things… but still Gregory XIII’s 1st of January marks a time to muse and reflect on those preceding 365¼ days. And, if my Twitter feed is anything to go by I’m not alone in being glad to see the change in that end-of-date number.\n\nEven so, in not being sad to see the end of a tough year, there’s been much to enjoy in 2022 even as we rushed, perhaps impetuously, away from the Years of Living Reclusively – remembering in the UK at least that the Tory regime that declared Covid-19 endemic, not pandemic, also had throughout the period a policy that required many of us to become ill, and not an inconsiderable number to die. Their contempt was reinforced in late in the year when those declared heroic essential workers through 2020 and 2021, those publicly performatively applauded, became recast as selfish greedy disrupters as industrial disputes grew over wages and conditions. It has been refreshing to see the high levels of public support those workers in dispute – nurses and other health workers, railway workers, postal workers and more – have retained even as daily life has been unsettled.\n\nThe Tories also brought to the year their own special form of disruption, with 3 Prime Ministers in 2 months, including the shortest ever in office who gave us such profound economic turmoil as to intensify a global crisis of capitalism and reinforce the UK’s status as one of the weakest OECD-type economies, while further impoverishing large numbers of UK residents. Even with Johnson’s ousting and Truss’s truncated term, a change in Tory leadership away from increasingly authoritarian populism (although keeping the racist and xenophobic policies, so perhaps Sunak’s government should be seen as subtle authoritarianism) and Bolsanaro’s loss in Brazil, I look around me and continue to see an increasingly unsafe world. It is still the case that much of the place is on the brink of or in states of war (well beyond Ukraine, let alone Tigray, Yemen, Mali, Azerbaijan, Armenia or the 65 year war against Palestine), while the USA, China, Russia and Israel hold us on the brink of widespread, perhaps nuclear, conflagration, not helped but not caused by Iranian and North Korean posturing. Then there are the continuing and new fascist or fascist-facilitating regimes in office in India, Turkey, Hungary, Italy and elsewhere, events such as the coup in Peru, and with the sanitisation of repressive regimes– Qatar and Saudi Arabia most obviously – and others passed over (Nicaragua, Myanmar amongst others). Despite some minor shifts, it’s not been a good year for social justice – although the awe inspiring women-led generational struggle in Iran has provided some hope (even with the regime’s murderous repression), especially in the light of war on Afghan women just across the border. And this is without getting to the accelerating global race to the brink of climate collapse. Sadly, none of these things become better with the arbitrary change in date.\n\nAfter a couple of years of barely venturing more than a few kilometres from home, it was good to begin to travel again – to see the kids and friends – academic and otherwise in north America and Europe, and to get back to live music and social outings. One of the big ones was Rupert’s birthday. When our off-spring enter their 5th decade it’s hard to escape the sense that tempus is fugiting rather quicker than we might pretend. It was a warm July day and evening day marked by a sizable gathering of friends and kin in their back yard near Hastings, excellent food, a top bar and great company: all-in-all, it was quite a delight (although they could have done without the slow leak none of us was aware of finally collapsing the kitchen ceiling – luckily, overnight when all were in post party sleep).\n\nA weekend in a cabin outside Hastings didn’t really count as a major outing; neither do work-related outings to south west Wales. The return of in person conferences provided for more extensive outings. There was a late May week in Chicago where the North American Society of Sport History provided an excuse to spend time with good chums and dear friends, to eat extremely well (with thanks to a superb ‘culinary outing organiser’, Russell) including a raucous Peruvian eatery, and of course be scholarly. It seemed to me that stopping off in Toronto seemed a reasonable thing to do on my home from Chicago, so some serious a conferencing was followed by a week or so in Russell and Carolyn’s spare room in central Toronto, still eating well, meandering museums and galleries, book shopping and catching up with more friends two years of reclusiveness had meant not seeing.\n\nThen June saw me heading off to Oslo for another conference, and the excuse/chance to see other chums. It’s a fabulous, if pricey, city, although we managed to get a cheap room in a hotel in the main train station (always a good move for travel planning) that also had a window out over the square in front of the station were a regular late night busker (Berthina Kayembe) had the most gorgeous, crystal clear voice – which made leaving the window open on warm nights all the more pleasant. I did come home with a dose of Covid though, so another bout of reclusiveness. That was followed by a short trip to Dublin for a seminar on the anti-apartheid movement, which reminded me how little I knew about the Irish movement. I’ve also learned that taking a holiday in November helps break up what can otherwise be a long semester, is good for the soul, and can be remarkably cheap. This year’s was an indulgent jaunt back to Toronto with cheap fares, that spare room again, and film festival to go to – although going to Canada to go to the movies does feel a little excessive. I also took in and really enjoyed the Denyse Thomasos retrospective at the AGO and a fantastc set of new pieces by Kent Monkman and the ROM. The Monkman was a refeshing and challenging engagement with Indigeneity, made more so perhaps after my high hopes for the promising but ultimately disappointing and frustrating visit to the Native Truths exhibit at the Field Museum in Chicago earlier in the year. The week, with sub-zero temperatures and snow did, however, prepare for the UK’s early December ‘cold snap’, even if the Canadians do road and footpath clearing a lot better.\n\nAmid all of this I also managed to publish a few things. There was a contribution to the alternative-to-Olympic-orthodoxy project, Another Five Rings. I managed to finish (after a very long time) a long review essay looking at visual culture and visuality in sport history books. Then, towards the end of the year I was pleased to be included in a group of commentators on work to diversify the scholarly field. This theme continued with my final article exploring aspects of the coloniality of British sports history. Bundled up in his work was a continuing editorial role for an academic journal: all this along with a paid job keeps me on my academic toes and in the midst of a difficult year has been a treat (if rough on the synapses some days).\n\nOut and about\n\nIt was also the year we got back to more in person cultural outings, including a few days in Liverpool to meander galleries and museums (where I really enjoyed the Radical Landscapes show at the Tate Liverpool), most notably my local jazz and literature festivals. High points included:\n\nLady Blackbird – my first live gig since seeing the Muttonbirds in Wellington in February 2020, and what a fabulous restart it was. She’s spectacular, with a powerful, a times mournful, soul-jazz voice that fills the space and drags her audience in to be swept along by her presence.\n\nAdeline – a Franco-Nigerian, New York based funkster (who also has an Afro-pop persona as Adi Oasis) who gave one of the most entertaining and engaging shows I have had the pleasure of experiencing in many years, perhaps made more enjoyable by being a mid-afternoon, I’ll-see-what-they’re-like outing.\n\nA session billed as Songs of Love and Hate, featuring two Ukrainian poets, a songwriter and Berlin-based DJ performing their album of war-inspired work: quite brilliant and not surprisingly extremely disturbing.\n\nAn evening session with A M Homes, whose fiction I have been soaking up since the late 1990s when I first stumbled on her work – a real treat.\n\nA couple of sessions with the Emirati spoken word poet Afra Atiq, entirely on the I’ll-see-what-she’s-like basis and left wanting so much more.\n\nMy in-person cultural outings were topped off by seeing Hurray for the Riff Raff in September, supported by the marvellous Sister Ray, at the Hare and Hounds, a Birmingham institution: I had planned a couple of other outings (and was disappointed not to be able to see Layla McCalla when she toured in November), but HFTRR was a fine way to wrap up my gigging year.\n\nThe Beats\n\nIt’s not been much of a year for new music, although I have enjoyed Adeline in both her personas, and Lady Blackbird. The high rotate list has been marked mainly by those who’ve made regular previous appearances, with at the top of the list\n\nHurray for the Riff Raff, Life on Earth, an album where the previous Americana influences weave together with a revival of some of the indie rock sounds of their very early outings with songs that link the personal and political in a potent mix, most forcefully in Precious Cargo, although Saga creeps up on you – pay attention: I’ve found it hard to replace it on the gramophone some days.\n\nFirst Aid Kit, Palomino, in which the Stockholm sisters continue their journey into country-folk, all crystal clear voices and powerful harmonies: I suspect it’ll keep on the high rotate list well into next summer.\n\nValerie June, The Moon and the Stars, extending the astral swirly soul sounds she’s been playing with for a while, with the addition of Carla Thomas on Call Me a Fool.\n\nLarkin Poe, Paint the Roses. These Nashville-based, Georgia born and raised, sisters have been on the turntable for the last few years, with their rich blues – but this live album, only a short seven tracks including the wonderful Back Down South, makes me want to see them sooner rather than late, and finally they’ve released a version of the wonderful Mad as a Hatter.\n\nI’ve already sung the praises of Lady Blackbird: her album Black Acid Soul has been at war with HFTRR Life on Earth for dominance of the ‘turntable’; it’s impossible to pick a fave – but It’s Not That Easy come close.\n\nSister Ray, Communion, is eight tracks of stripped down, guitar based indie including the potent, heart-breaking Good News unpacking being Métis in contemporary Canada – when I saw her live that song in particular cut to the core.\n\nOther newcomers to the high rotate list include spending too much time streaming\n\nOlivia Dean, whose mellow soulful sounds in The Hardest Part kept me enchanted.\n\nPoppy Ajudah, who leaves me wondering what is it about South London that keeps producing these young women who kick butt, with her uncompromising sexual politics in PlayGod.\n\nMuddy Magnolias, with some wonderful Americana: I do like a well-used mandolin.\n\nAnd in the wake of reading Michelle Zauner’s gorgeous memoir Crying in H Mart a return to her band Japanese Breakfast.\n\nTopping off the London crew with the haunting Cat Burns – her Go is one the great you cheated, it’s over, fuck off songs.\n\nI got a pile of PJ Harvey demos and outtakes for Christmas – I’d not be surprised if they make next year’s list.\n\nThe words\n\nAnd of course I read… a lot – as I struggle with the relationship between two hobbies – buying books and reading books (which are absolutely not the same thing!): there’s a lot more to see at my Goodreads page. There’s a lot of very pointy headed academia that makes the best books list this year, that kept such pleasures as Crying in H Mart and exceptional scholarship as Sara Ahmed’s On Being Included: Racism and Diversity in Institutional Life and Aileen Moreton-Robinson’s The White Possessive: Property, Power, and Indigenous Sovereignty off. Quite a lot is a few years old, including my best of the year:\n\nLisa Lowe’s The Intimacies of Four Continents disrupts much of the way we think about and write imperial and colonial histories to look at the interweaving of Asia, Africa, the Americas and Europe in both the experience and representation of Empire. It’s one of those books that made me stop, rethink reconsider and revise some of the basic ways I do my work. It was too long in the to-read pile. There’s a fuller review here.\n\nChristina Sharp’s In the Wake: On Blackness and Being in a similar vein gave me tools to think again about that work, and had a profound influence on an article that came out at the end of the year exploring the historiography of empire in British sports history. Her notion of redaction gave me a way to conceive of how we do history not as oversight and missing the voices of the marginalised, but of the active exclusion of those subaltern voices. There’s a fuller review here.\n\nAnd then, in the order I read them, the rest of my top eleven\n\nGurminder K Bhambra & John Holmwood in Colonialism and Modern Social Theory revisit the canon of western sociological theorising to explore how being at the heart of empire shaped how social theory developed and subsequently how that coloniality shaped being at the heart of empire. It’s probably the most specific to academia book on the list, but it is crucial to much of my work because it shows the shape of orthodoxy. There’s a fuller review here.\n\nC A Davids is a Cape Town based writer whose second novel. How to Be A Revolutionary. A Novel deals with the contradiction of post-apartheid South Africa by, oddly it seems, focusing on a mid-ranked consular official in Shanghai who strikes up a friendship with her neighbour, who turns out to be a fallen from favour elderly journalist with difficult questions about the Great Leap Forward, as it was known, and the famines of the late 1950s. There’s a fuller review here.\n\nErika Munkwitz’s Women, Horse Sports, and Liberation: Equestrianism and Britain from the 18th to the 20th Centuries was my stand out sport history text this year. There were other goodies, but in terms of my specific interests and work Erika’s unpacking of the gendering of horse sports, including a useful breaking of the geographical limit of nation by drawing British India into active dialogue with horse sports in the British Isles, resonated. There’s a fuller review here.\n\nRebecca Hall and Hugo Martínez have developed in Wake: The Hidden History of Women-led Slave Revolts a powerful graphic history, including some insightful critical reflections on being an historian working on these questions. I’m taken by the way more historians are working with different media, including graphic non-fiction. This is one of the best. There’s a fuller review here.\n\nLouise Erdrich’s The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse is probably the oldest book on the list at 20 years old, but I know I can be sure she’ll engage and captivate as she continues to world build reservation life in northern Minnesota. There’s a fuller review here.\n\nJoanna Kidman, Vincent O’Malley, Liana Macdonald, Tom Roa and Keziah Wallis in Fragments of a Contested Past: Remembrance, Denial and New Zealand History explore the ways in which colonial history, including military conflict, is cast in New Zealand. It’s a short collection of essays linked to a much bigger project, and weaves together Indigenous experience, the presence of the past in the present, heritage and history in compelling ways. There’s a fuller review here.\n\nElsa Dorlin Self Defense: A Philosophy of Violence unpacks the ways different conceptualisation of violence, of bodies, of politics and of the production of exclusion, power and inclusion casts different kinds of violence and legitimate or illegitimate. It was one of my more demanding bits of philosophy for the year, but one that resonated with a set of other debates and ideas that have been rolling around my reading and thinking in recent years. There’s a fuller review here.\n\nCherie Dimaline’s Red Rooms is an interwoven set of short stories based on occupants of a mid-priced chain hotel. The collection is held together by the cleaner-narrator, drawing on the idea that domestic staff are usually unseen – even more so when Indigenous – but see nearly everything. I had read Dimaline as a YA writer previously; this was an unexpected treat. There’s a fuller review here.\n\nKristin Ghodsee in Red Valkyries: Feminist Lessons from Five Revolutionary Women takes the lives of five women, four Soviet, one Bulgarian (three of whom I knew a reasonable amount about – Alexandra Kollontai, Nadezhda Krupskaya and Inessa Armand), to unpack lives of struggle in the aid of revolution to explore what they might tell us about ways of doing political action. I was taken by her use of the notion of confluence rather than intersectional, noting that intersections tend to be static, confluence moving. There’s a fuller review here.\n\nThe year ended with obituaries for two global figures that caused me to muse on the oddness of my cultural and work worlds. Pele has drawn much more attention, as he is held up to be the greatest footballer ever, and I can’t help but think it added a poignancy to the swearing in of Lula da Silva to replace Bolsanaro. But I suspect that Vivienne Westwood will be remembered longer as having a greater cultural influence as a designer, a key player in British punk, and a shaper of a cultural and aesthetic milieu. Along with the death of Elizabeth II, which left this republican slightly unsettled – perhaps because she’d always been queen – their deaths marked a pretty odd year.\n\nTWTYTW 2021\n\nPerhaps best seen as The Year of Living Reclusively (anything but dangerously, with apologies to Christopher Koch, Mel Gibson, Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hunt – look it up), Part II, I’ve spent the most part of 2021 generally avoiding other people – continuing to refine my misanthropy, and deciding that it’s not the best of looks – wandering my neighbourhood and still finding things I didn’t know existed after 2 decades (a small wildlife reserve, for instance), and musing wistfully (not easy while perfecting misanthropy) on the prospects of civil existence and meandering medieval cities. Unlike 2020 I ventured out to a couple of events – conferences mainly – but like 2020 held off on jaunts to elsewhere (even Lisbon!) for scholarly outings. Yet through all of this it was a delight and privilege to continue working with the crew at Labour Behind the Label: you’d hard pressed to find an organisation that, through excellent networking and the quality of its staff, ‘punches above its weight’ to the extent that LBL does.\n\nIt turned out to be a year where it was hard to engage with the everyday world of politics (an oddity for me) although Johnson and his fascism facilitating coterie continued to pursue a pandemic-response strategy of herd immunity, although whereas last year it was all about letting us get sick and having a bunch die to build up virus resistance, this year it was the single strand strategy of vaccinations: in itself a dangerous public health strategy. Having one string to your bow is never a good approach to managing a complex social crisis. Globally those forces of reaction stayed in power – although with the heart warming and soul protecting difference that after some time in February our mental environments were no longer polluted by a seemingly daily output of Trumpian venom: the man wasn’t silenced but he was harder to hear involuntarily. It might be setting the bar low, but I’ll take that as a win. Unfortunately the effects of Trump and other like him still in power (in some cases less securely – think Johnson, Bolsanaro and perhaps Orbán) persist. Much to the cost of others mainly, most notably/severely women in Afghanistan.\n\nOf course, it was the year of the continuing pandemic. I found myself reflecting, wryly, on a conversation with my GP in March 2020 about filling a prescription before heading off to the country. She gave me double the usual, so four months, hoped it’d be enough and we made arrangements for what to do if it wasn’t… Oh, how naïve we were thinking we’d have it sorted by mid-July. We’re now (end of December, 2021) looking at over 172,000 Covid deaths in the UK’s official figures, up to 5 million worldwide – and governments following a dangerously nationalist vaccination programme while using IP laws to prevent cheaper vaccine manufacture across much of the world where access is very limited, if almost non-existent. That means over half of us aged over 12 in the UK have had three vaccine shots, while around 5% of people in Africa have had any. The global Powers That Be don’t seem to realise that their vaunted globalisation works on multiple vectors.\n\nBut, staying home was both productive, and less productive than I’d hoped. The downside of ‘freelancing’ in a pandemic is far fewer want ‘lancing’, so income stayed well below the taxable level. Happily that changed towards the end of the year when I took a full time post managing and training research degree supervisors at University of Wales Trinity St David. It might not sound like a dream job but it’s an area I have been working in and around for 15 years or more, that I really enjoy and what’s more, it’s a new post in a new unit – so I get to shape it: I guess that’s pretty close to ideal. But starting a job in the middle of a pandemic, when we’re all working remotely, is kind of odd – so the major change (aside from the actual content of much of my day) has been the new laptop on my desk at home: I’m expecting to venture out to Carmarthen at best in late January or February. So that started at the beginning of November at very short notice (after a long lead in time before contracts were finalised) at just the same time as I took on some teaching for a friend who’d gone off on sick leave. To say the last two months were busy would be euphemistic.\n\nEven so, I spent the year writing less than I’d hoped, editing about as much as I’d expected (and making good progress on an edited collection of essays on histories of netball, which is rather exciting), wrapping up and seeing in print in December the fifth in our series of essays on the philosophy of play (in this case, Play & Democracy, edited with Alice Kubová and Petr Urban from the Czech Academy of Sciences, and with Wendy Russell: it’s a fabulous collection with an excellent team of co-editors) – although given the price it’s unlikely to be a big seller. Not only that, earlier in the year the fourth in series, Play, Philosophy and Performance, also made it to print (having been wrapped up right at the end of 2020 – co-edited this time with Wendy & Emily Ryall). Unfortunately the pandemic has slowed down work in our now decade long Philosophy at Play project: hopefully we’ll get underway again in 2022. There were also two new book proposals developed which will no doubt need more work (one certainly does, perhaps significant rethinking – the downside of trying to be innovative, dammit!).\n\nDespite begin Johnny-say-at-home, there were a few outings including ten days or so at Rupert & Hayley’s place near Hastings. The change of scenery was delightful, as was seeing them after a year, as I wandered the local farmland, meandered through Hastings and Rye for food gathering outings (and to sit on the beach) and enjoyed a rural-ish spring. There was a delightful weekend in Chester for a book launch, of essays honouring a former PhD student, Stuart Lester, who passed away suddenly in 2017, where we had the chance to celebrate a major thinker and doer in play studies and practice, a significant force in our philosophy project, and one of the smartest students and co-workers I have had – and dammit it was good to spend time with the play crew face-to-face. But travel otherwise meant the bus to Gloucester for teaching…. In the midst of it all, and much as I like the reach of our on-line seminars (including my own turn at the Institute of Historical Research) and conferencing, I really enjoyed two days of face-to-face sports history conferencing in August. I’m hoping 2022 includes more, including Gibraltar, Chicago, Porto and Oslo.\n\nOf course, staying home meant books, music and bad TV.\n\nThe Beats\n\nIt’s not been a year for much new music and I realised as I surveyed the high rotate it’s been powerfully women centric, and quite genre specific: perhaps I’ve been seeking the mellow. Sadly it was a live gig free year (not counting an outing to the fabulous, musically unpredictable spoken word event that is Tongue Fu), so it’s all recorded.\n\nNot surprisingly it starts pandemically, and equally unsurprisingly with new work by Rhiannon Giddens with Francisco Turrisi. Their haunting They’re Calling Me Home draws on her black southern world, his southern Italian life and their Irish residence to blend the traditional and new into an album that truly deserves the label ‘world’ music but more importantly innovates and reflects on our times. The title track reaches inside and grabs the heart and soul, whereas their version of classic Waterbound seems to sum up the year.\n\nIt’s hard to rank the others, but for the most part they’re people I have been listening to for a while with a couple of newbies in the mix.\n\nI’ve sung the praises of Joy Crookes before, although 2021 saw her first full album with the late in the year release of Skin featuring some of the previous EP tracks but mainly new work. She has a whispy, slightly breathy voice that she uses superbly in the title track but it’s hard to go past the power of Power with its oft quoted line: “You’re a man on a mission, but you seem to forget, you came here through a woman, show some fucking respect”. She’s the first of a bunch of Londoners who’ve been on high rotate.\n\nAlso in that group of women is Little Simz whose second album Sometimes I Might Be An Introvert marks a shift from the raw and stripped down sounds of 2019’s Grey Area with big productions that work, with choirs and string sections and raw, brutal cutting of the crap. Opening with the decidedly non-introverted Introvert sets the scene for a sonic and political tour de force.\n\nFor an entry by association I first encountered Eliza Shaddad when she supported Rhiannon Giddens at the Islington Town Hall several years ago. Now her second album The Woman You Want has provided a mellow, poppy, slightly swirly psychedelia with its wistful The Man That I Want and the FFS tone of Fine and Peachy, all woven through an unsettling intimacy.\n\nShifting back to the Londoners, Arlo Parks’ Collapsed in Sunbeams rather crept up on me after she kept appearing in the ‘if you liked’ lists by virtue of whatever algorithm was running that week – although I had encountered her work before. I love the pared down sound of Hurt, while in a year where (perplexingly) a Neil Diamond song became beloved of football crowds, this Caroline seems so much more of our times.\n\nA little more electronic than my usual comfort zone I also found myself sucked into Griff’s world on her (first EP), One Foot in Front of the Other with its hypnotic Black Hole.\n\nA few years ago Imelda May seemed to abandon her rockbilly style and now her new era second album 11 Past the Hour came with an added spoken word disc. She’s got much more diverse, including mellow ballads like Diamonds while Made to Love reminds me why I enjoy her gigs so much.\n\nAlthough I’ve also noted this year how much I stream, including excessively the divine Canadian Dominique Fils-Aimé including her Three Little Words that opens with Grow Mama Grow but I adore Big Man Do Cry from a couple of years ago.\n\nMoving back again to London, Ego Ella May is probably my wow discovery of the year with her gorgeous Honey for Wounds but it’s all about her Girls Don’t Always Sing About Boys.\n\nAnd finally from Brighton there is Isabelle Brown, who I really should have praise sung before and now there an album In Your Head with a foot stomping title track.\n\nThe quality of the list has kept some fabulous performers – Sampa the Great for instance – on the sideline, while other favoured artists older and newer have added to the sonosphere – here I mean Etta James, Jesca Hoop, the Highwomen (who never seem to go away), Paul Kelly, Kandace Springs, Emmylou Harris, Valerie June (whose new album is still on the to-get list), Larkin Poe (they’re due to play Bristol in a couple of months – pandemic permitting, the Mad As A Hatter remains a gut wrenching regular while I adore the hard edged blues of She’s a Self-Made Man), Pip Millet (oh, may there be an album soon) and Hurray for the Riff Raff (with a new album due early in 2022 – be still my beating heart).\n\nThe words\n\nStaying home also means reading, a lot – and I did, making it really hard to pare 120+ titles down to a top eleven (I couldn’t make it to ten). They’re a mixture of pointy-headed academia, lefty politics and sharp literature. There’s more at my Goodreads page.\n\nTop of the list, the first of my mind altering titles for the year is a couple of years old now but at 630 or so pages it looked a little daunting in the to-read pile: looks were not deceiving. Ariella Aïsha Azoulay’s Potential History, Unlearning Imperialism is an astounding piece where she weaves together her training in photography and political science to disrupt the notion of the archive, to push the notion of silences to unravel and read gaps in the archive, and to argue that rather than exploring ‘alternative’ histories we can explore those gaps and silences to uncover the potential histories that already exist and in doing refuse the power claimed by orthodoxy. More than anything in the last few years this has challenged me to rethink the way I work and what I’m doing with it. (Fuller review here)\n\nSharing the podium with Azoulay’s work at the top of the pile is Minna Salami’s Sensuous Knowledge: A Black Feminist Approach for Everyone which makes a powerful case for a system of knowledge production grounded in the banalities of our everyday lives while denying Europatriarchal knowledge and the claims it makes to universality. It’s beautiful, evocative and richly political. Along with Françoise Vergés’ A Decolonial Feminism (below) and Sylvia Tamale’s less even Decolonization and Afro-feminism this is a marker of dynamics of thought and practice challenging WENA (Western Europe North America) thinking and practice, and sitting in a discussion with Minna Salami and Emma Dabiri at my local literature festival in October here they explored African-Feminist politics and practice was a highlight of the year. (Fuller review here)\n\nAs for the rest, simply in the order I read them….\n\nJanice Forsyth’s Reclaiming Tom Longboat: Indigenous Self-Determination in Canadian Sport is both a history of an award recognising contributions to Canadian sport by Indigenous athletes and administrators, an account of the ways Longboat has been remembered and an analysis of the place of Indigenous peoples in Canadian sport policy. It’s a superb piece of work that quite properly won the North American Society for Sport History’s book prize for 2020 (and by way of full disclosure, I chaired that judging panel). (Fuller review here)\n\nDan Hicks, in The Brutish Museums: The Benin Bronzes, Colonial Violence and Cultural Restitution focuses in on one set of plundered artefacts, the Benin Bronzes, as a way to explore the ‘problematic’ basis of many British museum collections and some of the ways those institutions remain woven into the histories of British imperialism. (Fuller review here)\n\nIn some ways, the sleeper in the pile is Rachel Buchanan’s Ko Taranaki Te Maunga which powerfully explores her family background in and links to the colonisation of Taranaki in the mid-19th century and the sacking of the Māori community at Parihaka in 1881, focusing in part on her father and on the Crown’s penchant for apology. (Fuller review here)\n\nFrançoise Vergés’ outstanding A Decolonial Feminism both challenges the whiteness of much that goes on in feminist theory and practice, forcefully makes the case for ‘taking sides’ and calls to task what she calls ‘civilizational feminism’; it’s woven through with her French context but profoundly and richly internationalist with it. (Fuller review here)\n\nI have found myself reading more climate related things of late, some of which have been really insightful and exciting, but the standout was Andreas Malm and the Zetkin Collective’s White Skin, Black Fuel: On the Danger of Fossil Fascism exploring the place of the ‘hard right’ and newly invigorated fascist and quasi-fascist groups in climate denialism sustaining a capitalism grounded in fossil fuels and increasingly mainstreamed. Part of the reason for it making this list is the collectivist approach to writing (Malm was more an editor than lead author) and the internationalist perspective that resulted. (Fuller review here)\n\nCarwyn Jones’ fantastic New Treaty, New Tradition: Reconciling New Zealand and Māori Law looks at the debates around Treaty settlements in Aotearoa New Zealand, the Crown’s professed goal of atonement and the failure to recognise the profound differences in legal systems (Māori and colonial) to argue that the goal of Māori self-determination is actively undermined by the process. It’s a powerful frame for analysis and a damning indictment. (Fuller review here)\n\nAlso in the field of Indigenous history, Susan M Hill’s The Clay We Are Made Of: Haudenosaunee Land Tenure on the Grand River explores the experiences of the peoples who have come to occupy the Six Nations reserve, west of Lake Ontario, treaty making and breaking and struggles to defend their national integrity through Indigenous ways of looking at evidence used to tell colonisers’ histories and Indigenous evidence ignored or denigrated by those histories. It’s an empirically and methodologically challenging and invigorating piece of work. (Fuller review here)\n\nAnd wrapping up with novels, Katherena Vermette’s The Break (which sat for far too long in the to-read pile) looks at a single moment of sexual violence and other assault through lenses proved by three generations of Indigenous women and parts of their wider social networks in Winnipeg – it’s tough, it’s demanding and it is superb. (Fuller review here)\n\nAlmost the last book of the year was my much anticipated Mrs Death Misses Death by Salena Godden. I’ve been watching this develop for a few years through readings and assorted literary events so with a whetted appetite had high expectations for a book that adopts multiple voices and genre – prose, poetry, prose poetry – and tropes – humour, sadness, anger – to tell the story of Mrs Death and her human voice-giver. It’s hard to describe, and it’s utterly captivating and uplifting, reminding why Salena Godden is a treasure. (Fuller review here)\n\nAs to viewing, it’s been a year of trashy comfort viewing and with the exception of Shaka King’s impressive Judas and the Black Messiah about Fred Hampton, the Black Panthers and the FBI’s murderous war on them I’d be inclined to leave it under the rug.\n\nBut amid all this, I think I’m left at the end of the year slightly in awe of two young women, elite athletes who reminded us that amid all the razzmatazz of commercialised sport and sporting bodies, of movement as commodified entertainment for the rest of us, that there are more important things. Naomi Osaka and Simone Biles’ simple, if really high profile, acts of saying no granted space to many to act to protect themselves – or at least made it easier for other to do so. Respect.\n\nOn not going out: TWTYTW 2020\n\nAbout the years ago, as a kind of self-check I started doing a this was the year that was meander to wrap up the year that had just been – not with any kind of self-improvement, reflective practice kind of motive, just as a reminder. Over that decade it took on a kind of conventional form – a bit of a commentary on the big issues, some showing off about shit I had done, places I’d been, and ranking of the year’s cultural activities, with a here’s stuff you should read and listen to not-at-all-subtle sub-text. Much of it relied on getting out and about – and at the outset of 2020 it all looked kind of as expected, with planned outings to New Zealand, Chicago, Japan (mainly Hokkaidō) and some musings on the possibility of time in Central Europe…. And here I am 12 months later wondering what to do with this wrap up of a year marked by not going out (much).\n\nWhat is there to say? We’ve had a year where the decisions taken by right wing heads of state have resulted in the unnecessary deaths of perhaps hundreds of thousands of their citizens; we know from epidemiological modelling in the UK that Johnson’s populist decision to delay social controls by a week in March means that around 20,000 more people died in this pandemic than would have otherwise. We’ve seen Bolsonaro and Trump (as well as Johnson) act against medical advice, deny the significance of the virus, actively undermine their own public health advisors and advice, catch and survive the disease with therapies and treatments well beyond those available to most of their citizens and to an extent weaponise the pandemic in their own political interests. Is it any wonder that they are heads of state in the places with the highest death totals?\n\nIt’s easy to hold them up for the murderous scumbags they are, made worse in Johnson’s case by his celebration of the completion of trade talks with the UK’s biggest trading partner that set out to (and did) make worse the trading arrangement. At least in the USA they managed to vote out Trump – they may have to live with the ideology for quite a while but at least is sociopathic headman is out of power; the UK has to live with its marginalisation for the EU for decades. Now, I have no love for the EU as an economic project with its constitutional neo-liberalism, but the new arrangements look as if they’ll be way worse…. It’s not a good time to be in the UK searching for a more regular pay cheque.\n\nWhile those are the big issues dominating the news cycle, the year has also been marked by a rising global movement for social justice, sparked surprisingly by the slow, sadistic roadside murder-by-police of a middle aged Black man in Minneapolis; George Floyd’s death, a few weeks after Breonna Taylor’s – an emergency room worker in Louisville shot by police when they raided the wrong house (hers), became the tipping point that sparked a worldwide movement for racial justice. Much as I saw this through the mediated eyes of the TV watcher, it also came home to me when several thousand of us in whiter-than-white Cheltenham rallied in a local park as part of these protests. The breadth and persistence of this movement, as well as the right wing backlash (in the UK we have Tory ministers and toadies invoking culture war rhetoric – possibly to build a new bogey-man for their policy failures not that they can’t blame the EU), has I suspect transformed or political landscape.\n\nCloser to home, for me, was the work my co-workers in Labour Behind the Label (I generously include myself in that group, when I am at best a very active supporter) did exposing the rates and forms of worker exploitation in the UK textile industries. The focus has been principally on production for one label (Boohoo) in factories in Leicester, and there is no doubt that issues around Covid-19 exacerbated the issues and concern – but again I suspect there has been a marked change in consciousness and perhaps action, although the state’s response has been inadequate, inspection and control mechanisms remain appallingly underfunded, independent trade unions remain marginalised, although it appears one label might be shamed into some action, there’s still much further to go than we’ve come.\n\nI sent most of the year in Cheltenham, avoiding people (and testing the limits of my introversion and misanthropy) – so much so that some-time in August I ventured north across a fairly busy main road about 200m (a straight line) from my house, and realised that aside from the rally in the park, it was the first time I had crossed Suffolk Rd and gone into the town centre since mid-May. I, as with many other people, spent most of the year in my neighbourhood – I wandered and explored in a vain effort to stave off a the effects of a sedentary existence (my jeans are notably tighter), but did discover places I’d not been to in the nearly 20 years I have lived here – parks, side streets, main streets, industrial areas and more, although the downside of wandering is that I probably have no real idea of how to find them again….\n\nThe 3km radius from home was not, thankfully, the whole year. Thanks to Melissa and Rupert I got out to New Zealand for a couple of weeks in January and February (if it had been a little longer I might have stayed!) that was almost entirely turned over to catching up with chums, eating indulgently and a few days archive rummaging for a paper I really do need to finish. Being there involved unexpected catch-ups with old lefty and trade union mates and others from an extended kin network who I’d not seen for over 20 years – but I opted against heading up country to see my eldest brother, Brian, foolishly as it turns out given that he didn’t make the end of the year: it’s a strange sense of one’s place in the world when it’s a sibling who passes away simply by virtue of having got old, and of the funeral playing out on a small screen in my spare room late one evening…. Vale old boy.\n\nI’d also spent much of the first lockdown (March through May) with Rupert, Hayley, Rudy & Nell at their digs in the Sussex countryside (they’d fled London) – arriving just in time for everything to shut down. It was a strange and slightly unsettled experience in a hamlet of a few hundred in a farming area – so there was a sense that everyday working life was carrying on as usual, although the village pub was shut and grocery shopping was not as it normally would be. They’ve got a sizeable plot surrounded by farmland making for lots of good walking and adventures – Nell & I especially while Rudy was ‘in school’, although the walking distances were limited mainly by how far seemed reasonable for 3 year old legs: it may have been a couple of hours most days, but the distances not so great.\n\nAll this staying home stuff meant that it was a bad year for live music gigs – although it started really well with an outing to the Muttonbirds while in Wellington. I’d first seen Don McGlashan, who fronts that ensemble, in 1979 (in his Blam Blam Blam days), and the Muttonbirds had provided much of the soundtrack of my 1990s so the gig carried all sorts of memories and delights. Otherwise I’d got in early and made a bunch of jazz festival bookings – but its cancellation meant I missed gigs by Kandace Springs, Lizz Wright, Danielle Nicole, Ibibo Sound Machine, Bebel Gilberto, the Blind Boys of Alabama and more; even worse its cancellation means that a whole bunch of workers and musicians lost out on income.\n\nStill I made up for this by listening to a whole bunch of things. Music has been, as with much of the rest of the year, in a comfort zone, but among the recent arrivals on the scene I haven taken by is The Highwomen, a shameless riff off the Johnny Cash et al Highwaymen of country supergroup fame right down their own re-writing of the eponymous song. Much as four women, assertively feminist, social justice oriented group sits disruptively with many of images of country music, they could still surprise. I watched some highlights of the CMA’s annual awards show where Maren Morris (of The Highwomen) picked up Best Female performer, which wasn’t all that surprising given her profile. It was her acceptance speech that wowed me. This wasn’t the rolling off the usual thanks: she listed an array of Black women country and Americana performers, contemporary and historical, proclaimed their presence in country music and asserted their role in its formation and growth – a direct critique, in the core of the industry, assertively recovering a history of the genre that has been actively written out of the mainstream. That’s using your power for good.\n\nThe Highwomen have also been at the top of my high rotate list for the year, which has been a mix of streaming services and (the now old fashioned) CD and exclusively women, in alphabetical order it has been:\n\nAldous Harding (her 2019 beauty Designer) for sparse, haunting tones\n\nDanielle Nicole (of the foiled jazz festival outing) for a bit of raucous bluesiness\n\nEmel (Mathlouthi) who made her name 10years ago as the voice of the Tunisian (Arab Spring) revolution, featured big in one of my fave ever movies No Land’s Song and towards the end of 2019 gave us the electronically influenced Everywhere We Looked Was Burning\n\nJoy Crookes, from London, who I’ve been following for a couple of years, evoking hints of Sade and Eryka Badu\n\nLarkin Poe (both their recent albums – Self Made Man and Venom & Faith) for even more raucous bluesiness\n\nOur Native Daughters/Amythyst Kian/Rhiannon Giddens/Birds of Chicago/Leyla McCalla/Allison Russell – who all get rolled into one increasingly inseparable but individually distinct cluster with sharp, engaged, politically savvy Americana\n\nPip Millet, a Mancunian jazzy, soulful newcomer: I swoon\n\nTaylor Swift (I know, I’m a late middle aged bloke) – while I have been wooed by individual songs in the past (shamelessly asserting 2009’s Love Story as one of the great pop songs), Folklore is a superb album\n\nThe Delines (from 2019, their come-back after a long break, The Imperial): they’re great story tellers enriched by Amy Boone’s voice\n\nWhat this all means is that my Spotify algorithm has got really interesting, throwing up such wonders as Kylie Minogue, Hailey Whitter, IAMDDB, Alicia Keys, HAIM & PJ Harvey – it’s nothing if not eclectic.\n\nOf course, the other thing about staying in is reading (I averaged about 10 books a month) with a couple of real standouts – most notably Hazel Carby’s outstanding Imperial Intimacies: A Tale of Two Islands where she traces her biography as the daughter of a Jamaican father growing up in suburban south east London and village Devon in the 1940s and 1950s, and building a family history weaving together her father’s Jamaican lineage and her mother’s South Wales and West Country heritage that come together in working class Bristol and Bath. It’s a brilliant unpacking of complexly interwoven family pasts and debunking the notion of Empire as something out there. (Fuller review here)\n\nThe rest of my top ten (it was tough cutting out the other 111 titles), in the order I read them, are:\n\nAmbelin and Ezekiel Kwaymullina – Catching Teller Crow is a multi-genre title by Indigenous Australian siblings weaving together a police procedural with the settler colonial world and Indigenous outlooks and ways of knowing. It shifts voice, varies between prose, blank verse and prose poetry and while dealing with harrowing topics, is a beautiful text. (Fuller review here)\n\nJessica Dunkin – Canoe and Canvas: Life at the Encampments of the American Canoe Association, 1880-1910 was not only a surprising read but rather surprised me when it finished up in my best ten. Much of the discussion of the place and use of the canoe in settler North America reads it a an instance of cultural appropriation, while Dunkin builds on the settler colonial (re)making of space adding layers to the appropriation argument to consider the ways organised canoeing asserted settler control at multiple levels. (Fuller review here)\n\nKathleen Bachynski – No Game for Boys to Play: The History of Youth Football and the Origins of a Public Health Crisis is one of the best bits of historical writing, let alone sports history I have read in a long time (I’ll say the same about two others in the list) exploring the background to contemporary debates about head injury in American football to weave together public health and gender history into developments in American youth (so, amateur) football as influenced by discourses of man-making in sport; it’s a rich and superb piece of work. (Fuller review here)\n\nBenjamin Sacks – Cricket, Kirikiti and Imperialism in Samoa, 1879-1939 is the second title I proclaim as one of the best pieces of sport history in quite some time. I confess here I had examined and sung the praises of the PhD thesis it is based on so come to the book with ‘form’. Cricket in Samoa is marked by the 11-a-side version we all know and, as with several Pacific Islands, an Indigenous form. Sacks elegantly weaves both of these into his work showing the integrity of both as grounded in colonial relations, themselves with multiple aspects. (Fuller review here)\n\nCherie Dimaline – The Marrow Thieves is the only other novel in my top ten (there was lots of comfort reading) and also by an Indigenous author. In this case we’re in a post-apocalyptic land we once called Canada where all but Indigenous peoples have lost the ability to dream – so the settler world is hunting down First Nations peoples to harvest their bone marrow to recover the ability to dream. It’s a tale of a teenager separated from his family who makes a kin group when drawn into rag tag bunch of people travelling North away from the hunters. (Fuller review here)\n\nRobbie Shilliam – The Black Pacific: Anti-Colonial Struggles and Oceanic Connections is a brilliant analysis of the cultural and political links between anti-colonial struggles in Africa, the diaspora and the South Pacific, principally Aotearoa New Zealand. It is subtle, sharply insightful and something I should have read when it came out in 2016 – but I missed it…. (Fuller review here)\n\nMarama Muru-Lanning – Tupuna Awa: People and Politics of the Waikato River is a biography of the River and an ethnography of its people, focused on the relations and dynamics woven around claims to authority and negotiations towards the settlement of claims and joint governance with the settler state. It stood out for me in part because of the multi-disciplinary, decolonial approach, in part because I had heard her speak about aspects of the project at various conferences over the years, and in part because of the centrality of Waikato-Tainui and the River in Aotearoa New Zealand’s contemporary and historic cultural politics. (Fuller review here)\n\nBrenna Bhandar and Rafeef Ziadah (eds) – Revolutionary Feminisms: Conversations on Collective Action and Radical Thought also surprised me when I put it in the top ten, yet on reflection not so much. We’re continually told we’re into a post-feminist world, yet mainstreamed feminism is all about incorporation into an unequal social order. This collection of interviews with leading voices in an array of transformative feminist tendencies reminds us of the diversity of ways of doing anti-racism, decolonial, abolition feminism. (Fuller review here)\n\nShlomo Sand – Twilight of History is Sand’s reflections on the discipline. He has made his name in the English-speaking world as a critic of Zionist orthodoxy in histories of Israel. Here he uses his biography as an historian to explore tendencies on the discipline over the period from the late 1970s grappling with political and cultural histories, memory studies and the ‘reality’ of the past. It’s a demanding read but addressed to audiences beyond those of us who are practitioners in the field – which given the contested character of history in contemporary political and cultural life makes it all the more important. (Fuller review here)\n\nCarly Adams (ed) – Sport and Recreation in Canadian History is my final ‘among the best bits of historical writing in years’ camp. I also have to confess that Carly is a good mate as are several of the authors in this collection that, by placing conflicts and tensions around settler colonial relations and related Power relations in key places, gives a much more complex sense of sport and recreation than the conventional approaches and challenges the rest of us to think and rethink our national histories and the analyses that underpin them. (Fuller review here)\n\nAll in all then it’s been a year of big ideas.\n\nBeing stuck in has also meant there’s been a bunch of film watching – most of it escapist reruns that I had forgotten an hour later, but there were several delights.\n\nAgain, in the order I watched them:\n\nWhere Hands Touch The marvellous Amandla Stenberg is the standout in this 2018 tale of mixed race teenager in Nazi Germany, the daughter of a colonial soldier in the German army, who falls for the son of a local fascist leader, and he for her. It’s an achingly wartime tale of great power and beauty, and deserves to sit alongside the wonderful 2012 film Lore as unpacking everyday life in a fascist world.\n\nTop End Wedding Quite a different dynamic drives the entertaining tale of a now big city, successful Indigenous woman – Miranda Tapsell – who travels Home for her wedding and in doing s finds herself having to track down her estranged (from her and each other) parents. It’s a lovely tale of Country (and could have been an ad for the Northern Territory Tourist Board).\n\nMade in Bangladesh has an almost entirely amateur cast telling the story of a young woman’s efforts to organise a union in her clothing factory, her struggles with the bosses and her husband, the loyalty of her friends and the bureaucratic barriers thrown up. It’s a sharply cast tale of the global dynamics of one of the world’s largest, most exploitative and destructive industries.\n\nGipsy Queen tells the story of young Roma woman boxer played by Alina Serban (herself Roma and the first in her family to graduate from high school and university) who works in construction, a second job in a bar, fights in the quasi legal bouts in the bar’s basement and raises her son. The film manages to strike a balance between the conventions of sports movies while resisting the heroic aspects of those conventions.\n\nBinti is a lovely little Belgian movie about 7 year old Binti and her father, undocumented and running just ahead of the immigration authorities, who find a sense of precarious safety in a suburban neighbourhood through Binti’s friendship with Elias after she hides out in tree house. It’s a great tale of the human costs of the borders we maintain.\n\nA Matter of Life and Death (from 1946) in one of Michael Powell and Emric Pressburger’s oddest (and that’s saying something given some of their work), where a bomber pilot (David Niven) cheats death (he is supposed to die over the channel but it is foggy and the ‘collector’ missed him), and must argue his case for continuing life before a court of appeal. It is delightfully internationalist, packed full of P&P sense of honour, allegory and justice – it is tightly scripted, wonderfully shot and inventive. A delight.\n\nThere was also lots of TV, some of it superb (Michaela Coel, anyone?) but the utter standout was Samuel L Jackson and Afua Hirsch’s Enslaved (I saw the BBC version – it’s different in other productions, mainly I think to localise cases) covering the Atlantic slave trade, its costs, dynamics and continuing presence in four hours through powerful commentary, excellent reportage and uncovered suppressed histories.\n\nYet all of this staying in came at the cost of human contact – it’s been a rough year for many and I know that even with pretty much a non-existent income I’m a bucket load better off than many. Many of us are grieving with this pandemic, and I’ve been lucky also that those we’ve lost have not been as close as many I know – but being better off than many in a crisis where (at the time of writing) the choices made by my government have resulted in the death of over 70,000 of my fellow citizens, and we’ve lived with mendaciousness, contempt and ineptitude of leadership where the costs has been borne by those least able to sustain that cost, whose work has put them in them in danger and cost many their lives.\n\nSo to wrap up this That Was The Year That Was, I’m drawn to Marx, who in an 1861 letter to Engels wrote: “May I wish you in advance every happiness for the New Year. If it’s anything like the old one, I, for my part, would sooner consign it to the devil.”\n\nTWTYTW2019\n\nSome years go down as ones we’d have best avoided. Whereas it is quite easy to look around the world and agree that we’re globally better off than we have ever been before – better educated, with better health and the like – it should also be blindingly obvious that the conditions that allow that to be the case may not last. The forces of political reaction are growing in strength, overthrowing social democratic governments in South America, building increasingly oppressive states in India, Brazil, many parts of Europe (Poland, Hungary, Italy, Turkey – I know, I hear some of you scream ‘It’s not Europe!’) all the while mendacious, white supremacist, fantasists keep or gain power in Britain, the USA and Australia. It’s a world that actively promotes inequality and xenophobia – it’s hard not to despair.\n\nExcept of course these conditions are hotly contested by, amongst others, LGBTQI+ activists in Brazil who flip Bolsanaro the bird with a fantastic defiant Pride (note Pride corporatisers in the UK and elsewhere – there’s a hell of a fight to be fought), by school pupils and students worldwide staging climate strikes making a simple case to act on the scientific advice, by very many Indians of all classes and faiths who turn out to resist the BJP’s redefinition of citizenship, by voters in Istanbul who deny the reactionary AKP political power in its leader’s perceived home base, by global social justice campaigners who force the Bangladesh Govt to extend the regulation of textile factories that is the only thing that has improved working conditions in that industry in the last decade. There’s one hell of a fight to be fought, that starts by not giving in to despair.\n\nCloser to home, it has been very much, to invoke a cliché, a year of two halves. It started as I wrapped up my 19 years at the University of Gloucestershire, as that institution’s on-going self-inflicted financial crisis resulted in a swathe of academic posts being disestablished (most not by compulsory redundancy as in the case of a small group of us – but I did walk away with a year’s take home pay). Not of course that those responsible carry any of that cost, as boss class hubris means that those who cause these crises convince themselves that they are the only ones who can fix the problems they have caused – but then such arrogance is the way of the bosses. Of course, in a tough employment setting finding a new regular income has proved to be a challenge – as that quest continues, I spent the first half of the year expecting something soon. I’ve spent so long working in and around labour markets that I expected things to get psychologically difficult after about 6 months, if I was still unemployed, but even knowing that and having a well-developed structural understanding of labour markets hasn’t made those thanks but no thanks letters any easier to deal with, but the gizza a job epistles have become much more polished even as I have found it difficult to do much other writing.\n\nA few years ago I had a melanoma (which turned out to be the lowest possible risk) removed, which has made me alert to skin. A weird growth resulted in a minor bit of surgery in February – less than 10 minutes of cutting around an inner thigh about which I expected to be more squeamish but which I found fascinating to watch, leading to a new word for my vocab; hemagatoma, which is a harmless but aesthetically unpleasant (in this case) knot of capillaries. That, and a young friend’s much more serious cancer diagnosis, puts this regular income thing into perspective.\n\nEven in these circumstances, I’ve not hung round at home (God, a year of Cheltenham without respite would drive me crazy!). There’s been a lot of travel, three outstanding gigs (the aforementioned travel prevent me getting to a couple of others), less writing (other than those gizza a job things) than I’d hoped for, and one of the finest movies I have ever seen….\n\nTravel got underway in March with five days in Gibraltar doing some teaching, planning some projects (that have taken longer than we’d like to come to fruition) and scrambling about on the damned big rock. It was great to be there (tucking into fine meals at a lovely little vegetarian tapas bar), including an unexpected trip across the border to Spain to get back to the UK after high winds closed Gibraltar airport and we were loaded on a bus to Malaga.\n\nThe big trip came in April and May, with a six week jaunt to the USA and Canada. I had a conference at Easter in Pennsylvania and on in Boise (Idaho) in late May. Figuring I had no specific need to be in the UK – there are perks in not having an office where attendance is required – I decided there was no need to fly back and forth across the Atlantic when I could invite myself to visit chums, which I duly did. Kicking off with time in Philadelphia either side of Easter, it was great to hang out with Roger and Amy, meander museums and galleries and take in a city I have long enjoyed. During Easter I flitted up to State College for a South African themed conference (with thanks to Michelle Sykes and Mark Dyerson for arranging some financial support to get there). It was a fine gig (I’m still working on the paper from it), made more so by an excellent afternoon lurking on Jaime and Paul’s back porch with Zack, Dain, Michelle and a couple of others – there is nothing like a relaxing afternoon of good company – and by a catch up curry with Laura and Doug: damn academia can give us fine networks of buddies.\n\nThe next 4 weeks or so were back north of the border starting out with a week in Hamilton (Ontario) with Nancy & Pauline; a superb, extremely pleasant time with two of my dearest chums including an afternoon at ‘Disney’s Freaky Friday’ (not a show I ever expected to take in), an outing to Niagara Falls (astoundingly intimidating), a visit to a superb book store on the Six Nations Reservation specialising in Indigenous books (check out Good Minds, it’s awesome) and generally soaking up the world that is Hamilton. Then, into Toronto for a few days (big thanks to Mel & Elaine for the bed in the basement) to hang out with Russell, Carolyn & Alice, to eat well (including some superb Indonesian street food), indulge Toronto’s cultural activities, catch up with Janelle and spend too much time writing lists of books I’ll never get to read…\n\nThe adventure continued out on the west coast, with a weekend in Vancouver visiting the fabulous Museum of Anthropology at UBC, wandering through and around Stanley Park, an afternoon chewing the fat with Rob and generally enjoying one of my favourite cities. A short boat ride later, there I was in Nanaimo, on Vancouver Island, taking up space in Rob & Nic’s spare room, meandering the mid-Island area, talking PhD thesis with Rob and sitting in on a fascinating meeting at Vancouver Island Uni on the establishment of a Faculty of Indigenous Studies. I have to confess to deep envy of those who live in this part of the Island (or in my limited experience, most parts of the Island). The Canadian jaunt finished with a week or so in the greater Victoria area at Christine and Al’s – as the kids slowly worked out who this odd guy in the spare room was. There’s nothing like the relaxing good company of good chums to replenish and recharge, or the chance to engage with worlds that are not quite our own to be reminded of the multiple ways of seeing and making sense of what’s going on around us. It was also refreshing to get up to UVic and see the First Nations house right in the middle of campus, most excellent to spend the afternoon chewing the fat with Emma, take in an evening of football (I’m still grappling with the irony of the group of Indigenous women offering the middle aged white guy – me – the bottle of cinnamon flavoured whiskey, as colonialism bites back) and alarming to visit a worryingly retrograde museum.\n\nFrom there it was off to Boise for my annual outing to the North American Society for Sports History conference. Boise was a pleasant surprise (my stereotypes of Idaho were slightly dented – but I note that university towns and capital cities tend to be a little more open). There’s great food (including a fab evening at Fork with Russell and Carly), a wonderful local bookshop, and a relaxed college town vibe about the city centre, and it is only an hour or so drive from the Rockies.\n\nOf course, this wasn’t the end of the travel. There was a week in Prague at the end of June for the 5th Philosophy at Play conference (the first we’ve not organised in Cheltenham or Gloucester), this year themed around play & democracy. It was great to be in Prague with a posse including Wendy and Colin, and to join in a pro-democracy rally with several hundred thousand other people in Letna Park. Then, a few weeks later, it was off to Madrid for another sports history gig, where I took an apartment with Russell in a part of the city I really like and spent an awful lot of time on public transport getting to the venue well out of town, but it was worth it for the apartment location.\n\nThere endeth my travel adventures – nothing too exotic this year, and less time than I’d usually spend with Rupert & Hayley in London, with their house out of commission for six months while they added a floor and extended the ground floor, but I made up for the absence by getting up several times in November and December, including at Xmas when Melissa and Grace were also visiting: a fine end to the year in most excellent company.\n\nOf course, as I’ve been ‘resting between engagements’ there was lots of time for a cultural life, with a big hole made in the to-read pile, but before that, some excellent gigs. I was disappointed to miss the local jazz festival this year (in Canada) and an appearance by the superb Kandace Springs. Three gigs really stood out, with visits to the world of Rhiannon Giddens in January (in Glasgow) and November (in London). The January gig, part of Celtic Connections, featured her solo with an orchestra backing, while the November gig was a trio of two multi instrumentalists and a bass player. In the middle, in March, I kept the former Carolina Chocolate Drops theme running with a great Leyla McCalla gig for her Capitalist Blues album – admittedly a bit of a banjo theme there.\n\nAs to the top books read, this was tough (plenty of time, lots read) and surprisingly not a lot of fiction although Rachel Siffert’s The Dark Room, three novellas of German experiences of WW2, including the one that gave us the superb movie Lore in 2012. That said, my two absolute outstanding book were forms of the fictional (one a novel in verse, one a collection of spoken word poetry).\n\nElizabeth Acevedo’s The Poet X is a superb YA novel in verse form about a young poet struggling to manage the demands of her everyday urban existence. (She’s a stunning poet, check her out.)\n\nSuhaiymah Manzoor-Khan came to the public eye for many when she won the Roundhouse slam in 2017 with her fabulous ‘This is Not a Humanising Poem’, the final piece in her collection Postcolonial Banter (it opens with her piece from the heats of that event, about audience vouyeurism and poets exposing themselves for our pleasure). This collection is outstanding, showing her to be both a fabulous poet and increasingly, to my mind, one of the UK’s most important public intellectuals (if one who speaks in verse).\n\nThese two stood out not only as fine books, as ones I’ll revisit, often. Then, in alphabetical order I managed to whittle well over two books a week down to eight more to praise sing over:\n\nTithi Bhattacharya’s edited collection Social Reproduction Theory: Remapping Class, Recentering Oppression demands that we rethink and rework the relationships between feminism, Marxism, oppression and ways of engaging critically with contemporary gender relations as systems of social reproduction. It’s far from an easy skip-through by the pool, but it is one of the most pressing critical texts I have read in long time.\n\nWill Bishop’s Pinstripe Nation: The New York Yankees in American Culture shows us what a melding of social and cultural histories of sport in/and popular culture can do: it is quite outstanding.\n\nNick Estes’ Our History Is The Future: Standing Rock versus the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the Long Tradition of Indigenous Resistance takes us into the struggle at Standing Rock that came to high profile in 2016 as case of Indigenous resistance to land loss and desecration, to the depredations of Big Oil and explores it as a case in the long struggles of the people of Oceti Sakowin, the people we call Sioux, against colonial occupation.\n\nDavid Featherstone, Christopher Gair, Christian Høgsbjerg and Andrew Smith’s edited Marxism, Colonialism, and Cricket: C. L. R. James’s Beyond a Boundary takes papers from a conference exploring CLR James’ Beyond a Boundary – one of the key texts of sports history and postcolonialism to give us a major reassessment of a major text. It’s admittedly fairly specialist, but a profoundly important collection.\n\nbell hooks’ Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom, the oldest (and re-read) on this list is one of my basic texts about teaching. Every teacher, every academic should read it.\n\nWalter D. Mignolo and Catherine E. Walsh challenge us in On Decoloniality: Concepts, Analyses, Praxis to think and rethink pluriversality and the multiplicity of global stories, it is an excellent example of collegial, open scholarship that we need more of.\n\nPriyamvada Gopal rewrites the history of empire in Insurgent Empire: Anticolonial Resistance and British Dissent. It is vital reading in contemporary Britain, and beyond.\n\nTanya Talaga’s All Our Relations: Finding the Path Forward is drawn from the text of her 2018 Massey lectures exploring Indigenous well-being; it is essential reading to get a handle on contemporary Indigenous lives.\n\nNot exactly light and chirpy reading in 2019 I’m afraid.\n\nWhile I was in Glasgow on January I took in a movie (and discovered the wonder that is the Glasgow Picture House) that utterly blew me away. On Her Shoulders is a biographical film about Nadia Murad Basee Taha (2018 Nobel Peace Prize co-winner) that tells the story of the genocide waged against the Yazidi people in Iraq through her story as a survivor of sex slavery – and it is potent, empathetic and at times harrowing. There is a moment in it where, in the course of an interview she gets a wistful look on her face and says “You know, I wish you’d known me because I was a great athlete; I wish you’d known me because I was a great farmer; I wish you’d known me because I was a great make-up artist.” – simply superb. Nothing I have seen in an awfully long time comes anywhere hear it as a film to praise sing about.\n\nAs I’m looking at these lists, it is very much a year where women writers, musicians and film makers have dominated my cultural world – and the highest rotate 10 albums are also all by women.\n\nNo-one should be surprised to know that Rhiannon Giddens tops my list. Much as I love her album There is No Other with Francesco Turrisi, the album that has totally wowed me is her collaboration with Leyla McCalla, Allison Russell (formerly of Po’Girl) and Amythyst Kiah as Our Native Daughters, with the album Songs of Our Native Daughters\n\nAnd the other eight in alphabetical order\n\nPatty Griffin Patty Griffin is packed full of the kind of thing we’ve come to adore her for – lyrical and powerful melodies, as seen in ‘Where I Come From’\n\nKaia Kater’s Grenades draws on her father’s experiences as a refugee from the overthrow of the Grenadan revolution; the title track is a mournful, punchy RnB inflected ballad.\n\nI get grumpy when ‘world music’ means ‘something not in English’, so was delighted to discover that Angelique Kidjo’s global reach in late 2018 (I got this at the end of 2018) included a full cover of Talking Heads’ Stop Making Sense. Remain in Light is a spectacular album, unsettling because we know it so well, yet don’t – as in ‘Houses in Motion’\n\nIf you’ve not encountered Little Simz, shame… she’s one of two spectacular young women doing great stuff out of London (the other is Ray Blk, who only releases on-line). Her album Grey Area fizzes. The collaboration with Michael Kiwanuka ‘Flowers’ is gorgeous, and delightfully inverts male rapper, woman singer dynamic of some much music.\n\nI’ve already praised Leyla McCalla, and Capitalist Blues is a great album, with a great title track.\n\nAngel Olsen’s third album (in my collection, anyway) All Mirrors sometimes makes me think Sharon van Etten and Dusty Springfield mind melded, at least in the title track. Elsewhere, as in ‘Lark’ there’s quite different vibe.\n\nIt took quite a while to engage with Amanda Palmer’s There Will be No Intermission but when I did, I was pleased I had, including the musical intensity of ‘Drowning in the Sound’ to the politically unsettling, intense ‘Voicemail for Jill’.\n\nSince Rupert pushed it into my hand last week, I have listened to pretty much nothing but Sudan Archives –I’d seen her on the telly a few weeks ago with ‘Confessions’ and the entire album Athena is spectacular – she might make my top ten next year as well.\n\nSo, an all over the place year, but one that in the wake of the politics we’re living with and the alarming prospect for the UK in 2020, I find myself revisiting Percy Bysshe Shelley, 200 years ago, in ‘England in 1819’\n\nAn old, mad, blind, despised, and dying King\n\nPrinces the dregs of their dull race, who flow\n\nThrough public scorn, – mud from the muddy spring;\n\nRulers who neither see nor feel now know,\n\nBut leechlike to their fainting country cling\n\nTill they drop, blind in blood, without a blow.\n\nA people starved and stabbed in th’ untilled field;\n\nAn army, whom liberticide and prey\n\nMakes as a two-edged sword to all who wield;\n\nGolden and sanguine laws which tempt and slay;\n\nReligion Christless, Godless – a book sealed;\n\nA Senate, Time’s worst statute, unrepealed –\n\nAre graves from which a glorious Phantom may\n\nBurst, to illumine our tempestuous day.\n\nWe live in hope…..\n\nLet’s kick some butt in 2020!\n\nTWTYTW, 2018\n\nFor the last few years I have done one of those irritating end-of-the-year meanders through stuff that happened; I’ve normally tried to get it out about New Year’s Day, but held off a few days this time to mark another end – but more of my working life below….. For me it has very definitely been a ‘year of two halves’ (accepting that those halves were not quite equal) which might intensify the sense I have living in a time of crisis, but then there seems to be a widespread view that we’re in a time of crisis so perhaps I’m just in sync with the rather battered world around me.\n\nIn last year’s meanderings I noted Antonio Gramsci’s observation on the 1930s that “The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born; now is the time of monsters” – and while the monsters still hold much power (and have won more – Bolsano in Brazil, for instance) they’ve also suffered some setbacks as the being born world scored some minor but notable victories. I suspect, though, that it is telling how fragile some of those victories seem when lefties like me get excited by a handful of US Congressional victories – although we should not underestimate the significance of Native American and Muslim women (one a headscarf wearer) in that institution, but the panic of the right at the political profile of one young woman from New York City shows just fragile their egos are.\n\nMore than the US though I have been taken by the weirdness that is British politics, as the Tories tear themselves apart over an unachievable goal, as Labour hangs on to the increasingly obvious fantasy that it can 1) force a general election and 2) be sure of winning it and as many in the political elite pretend to be able to redefine and reshape the constitutional configuration of the UK by undoing 40 years of work in half a dozen chats around a table in Brussels. At the same time, others in that elite seek to destroy whatever perilous, precarious security the UK’s dispossessed can hang on to by adopting what seems to be a ‘fuck ‘em’, we can rebuild the Empire as it never was and rule the world. Now, I’m no fan of the EU – it is a set of neoliberal institutions hanging on a defunct ideology and setting rules on the basis of some dystopian, misanthropic view of the world rather than considering a long term vision of social justice and wellbeing. That said, the kinds of leaving the EU options the UK is faced with are all worse than staying, but that doesn’t stop some on the left falling into form of the old ‘heighten the contradictions and build a movement for change out of misery’ argument. The whole thing has revealed the ineptitude of the British ruling class – with the one exception of the smoke and mirrors trick that makes it someone else’s fault.\n\nAll in all it comes down to the monsters still calling the shots – Trump’s megalomania depriving people of their livelihoods for the emperor’s new clothes on the Southern border, Bolsano’s reactionary class politics, misogyny, racism and homophobia, Modi’s not-quite fascism, Orban’s fascism but we’re not calling it that, Duterte’s regime based in state sponsored murder and terror, Putin’s fantasy of restored greater Russian Empire. No wonder we’re feeling bleak – except we’re surrounded by people doing great things to build local strength, power and connections. And I haven’t even mentioned climate change, or having a shower in Cape Town (remember the water restrictions).\n\nIt’s hard not to look beyond the language of Power and see forces resisting reaction. In some cases, paradoxically, these forces are part of the state – think of the US states that continue to work towards globally agreed emissions targets to limit climate change (they’re probably not enough, but when the Federal Government denies human causation, this resistance seems progressive) or recent decisions in London and Greater Manchester to, in effect, prevent fracking. I take hope from Syria’s Kurds, who despite the on-going relentless assault, continue to build an inclusive, democratic political entity (I daren’t call it a state), as well as from the 30 or so artists from around the world who donated works for a fund raising auction organised by the crew at Labour Behind the Label. I take even more hope from and have enormous respect for Kayla Morris, a cheerleader for the 49ers who ‘took the knee’ at a match in early November, although none of the media outlets I have seen could name her until the next day – which tells pretty much we need to know about why what she did matters so much.\n\nSo, we take our victories when we can – like the Guardian naming Khadija Shaw as its footballer of the year, perhaps a sign that some things definitely are changing for the better.\n\nIt’s also been a year of big change for me. My now former university finally fessed up to being in financial strife (they blame unexpectedly low enrolments linked to a slump in the number of 18 year olds over a 3-4 year period due to low birth rates in the late 1990s and early 200s – but I am not sure that not preparing for something we’ve known about for 18 years is a ringing endorsement of management and planning!) and imposed severe funding cuts over the next few years (again, those responsible for the problem seem to believe they can be trusted to fix it). That meant, in my School, six academic posts disappearing, including mine – so after 18 years I get shunted out the door with a sizeable go-away cheque. Watching what has happened, more to others than me, has taught me a lot about how not to manage change at both a systems and humane level (for instance, in my case 10 of those 18 years were in posts classified senior management, including quite close work with several members of the current university executive who made the final decisions about which posts would go: in the 5 months between being put ‘at risk’ and leaving the only comment any of those people have made to me about being made redundant is the one who has agreed to write references when I have asked if that’s OK. If they’re ashamed of the position they’ve put us in they should just suck it up and at least be humane; if they’re not ashamed it is clear that they’ve turned into sociopathic bosses of the worst order holding their staff in contempt – and yet some still have the audacity to refer to those staff as ‘colleagues’). OK, so I am angry at their ineptitude and callousness – but I’ve also got a year’s (take home) pay, a pretty strong CV and at least getting interviews in about ¼ of the applications I make; I’m a damn sight better off than many in my position. I’ll admit at times it got a bit overwhelming – in part the paradox of being told I was surplus to requirements while people across the institution came to me with the ‘oh, before you go will you just….’ requests – and I shut down on a couple of projects where I had commitments so have some relationship repair to do there – apologies to those for whom I missed obligations/expectations. Please know also that I have appreciated expressions of comradeship, solidarity and support from far and wide, those job ads I wouldn’t otherwise have seen and quite expressions of good will – I doff my (imaginary) cap in thanks.\n\nDespite all that malarkey, I had some crackingly good adventures including a couple of superb gigs. The first was a late night turn at a lovely art deco restaurant (and former cinema) around the corner from home, where Cherise Adams-Burnett turned on a late night set of 50s and 60s jazz standards keeping me utterly captivated until well into the small hours: it was a great, politically savvy performance. Then a couple of days later I was across town for a brilliant, unexpected performance by a young Estonian pianist Kadri Voorand who was not just a great musician but a phenomenal performer, engaging, funny and given what seemed to be a penchant for extemporisation a challenge for her band. Then later on the same day I took in a big, blistering gig by Imelda May, rockabilly performer turned T Bone Burnett produced songstress.\n\nIf the Jazz festival gave me my best gigs, the local Literature Festival saw me soaking up some sharp cultural commentaries: I heard the impressive Elif Shafak and Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche discussing their work, politics and making change. The festival began for me with a blistering poetry performance by Hollie McNish and Hera Lindsay Bird – reminding me of the wonder and power of t"
