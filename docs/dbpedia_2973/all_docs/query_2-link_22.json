        "text": "Jim Carrey, Canadian-born and a U.S. citizen since 2004, is an actor and producer famous for his rubbery body movements and flexible facial expressions. The two-time Golden Globe-winner rose to fame as a cast member of the Fox sketch comedy In Living Color (1990) but leading roles in Ace Ventura - Ein tierischer Detektiv (1994), Dumm und Dümmer (1994) and Die Maske (1994) established him as a bankable comedy actor.\n\nJames Eugene Carrey was born on January 17, 1962 in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada, and is the youngest of four children of Kathleen (Oram), a homemaker, and Percy Carrey, an accountant and jazz musician. The family surname was originally \"Carré\", and he has French-Canadian, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. Carrey was an incurable extrovert from day one. As a child, he performed constantly, for anyone who would watch, and even mailed his résumé to The Carol Burnett Show (1967) at age 10. In junior high, he was granted a few precious minutes at the end of each school day to do stand-up routines for his classmates (provided, of course, that he kept a lid on it the rest of the day).\n\nCarrey's early adolescence took a turn for the tragic, however, when the family was forced to relocate from their cozy town of Newmarket to Scarborough (a Toronto suburb). They all took security and janitorial jobs in the Titan Wheels factory, Jim working 8-hour shifts after school let out (not surprisingly, his grades and morale both suffered). When they finally deserted the factory, the family lived out of a Volkswagen camper van until they could return to Toronto.\n\nCarrey made his stand-up debut in Toronto after his parents and siblings got back on their feet. He made his (reportedly awful) professional stand-up debut at Yuk-Yuk's, one of the many local clubs that would serve as his training ground in the years to come. He dropped out of high school, worked on his celebrity impersonations (among them Michael Landon and James Stewart), and in 1979 worked up the nerve to move to Los Angeles. He finessed his way into a regular gig at The Comedy Store, where he impressed Rodney Dangerfield so much that the veteran comic signed him as an opening act for an entire season. During this period Carrey met and married waitress Melissa Womer, with whom he had a daughter (Jane). The couple would later go through a very messy divorce, freeing Carrey up for a brief second marriage to actress Lauren Holly. Wary of falling into the lounge act lifestyle, Carrey began to look around for other performance outlets. He landed a part as a novice cartoonist in the short-lived sitcom Die Entenfabrik (1984); while the show fell flat, the experience gave Carrey the confidence to pursue acting more vigorously.\n\nCarrey also worked on breaking into film around this time. He scored the male lead in the ill-received Lauren Hutton vehicle Einmal beißen bitte (1985), and had a supporting role in Peggy Sue hat geheiratet (1986), before making a modest splash with his appearance as the alien Wiploc in Mein Liebhaber vom andern Stern (1988). Impressed with Carrey's lunacy, fellow extraterrestrial Damon Wayans made a call to his brother, Keenen Ivory Wayans, who was in the process of putting together the sketch comedy show In Living Color (1990). Carrey joined the cast and quickly made a name for himself with outrageous acts (one of his most popular characters, psychotic Fire Marshall Bill, was attacked by watchdog groups for dispensing ill- advised safety tips).\n\nFollowing his time on In Living Color (1990), Carrey's transformation from TV goofball to marquee headliner happened within the course of a single year. He opened 1994 with a starring turn in Ace Ventura - Ein tierischer Detektiv (1994), a film that cashed in on his extremely physical brand of humor (the character's trademark was talking out his derrière). Next up was the manic superhero movie Die Maske (1994), which had audiences wondering just how far Carrey's features could stretch.\n\nFinally, in December 1994, he hit theaters as a loveable dolt in the Farrelly brothers' Dumm und Dümmer (1994) (his first multi-million dollar payday). Now a box-office staple, Carrey brought his manic antics onto the set of Batman Forever (1995), replacing Robin Williams as The Riddler. He also filmed the follow-up to his breakthrough, Ace Ventura - Jetzt wird's wild (1995), and inked a deal with Sony to star in Cable Guy - Die Nervensäge (1996) (replacing Chris Farley) for a cool $20 million--at the time, that was the biggest up-front sum that had been offered to any comic actor. The movie turned out to be a disappointment, both critically and financially, but Carrey bounced back the next year with the energetic hit Der Dummschwätzer (1997). Worried that his comic shtick would soon wear thin, Carrey decided to change course.\n\nIn 1998, he traded in the megabucks and silly grins to star in Peter Weir's Die Truman Show (1998) playing a naive salesman who discovers that his entire life is the subject of a TV show, Carrey demonstrated an uncharacteristic sincerity that took moviegoers by surprise. He won a Golden Globe for the performance, and fans anticipated an Oscar nomination as well--when it didn't materialize, Carrey lashed out at Academy members for their narrow-minded selection process. Perhaps inspired by the snub, Carrey threw himself into his next role with abandon. After edging out a handful of other hopefuls (including Edward Norton) to play eccentric funnyman Andy Kaufman in Der Mondmann (1999), Carrey disappeared into the role, living as Kaufman -- and his blustery alter-ego Tony Clifton -- for months (Carrey even owned Kaufman's bongo drums, which he'd used during his audition for director Milos Forman). His sometimes uncanny impersonation was rewarded with another Golden Globe, but once again the Academy kept quiet.\n\nAn indignant Carrey next reprised his bankable mania for the Farrelly brothers in Ich, beide & sie (2000), playing a state trooper whose Jekyll and Hyde personalities both fall in love with the same woman (Renée Zellweger). Carrey's real-life persona wound up falling for her too--a few months after the film wrapped, the pair announced they were officially a couple. By then, Carrey had already slipped into a furry green suit to play the stingy antihero of Ron Howard's Der Grinch (2000).\n\nAlthough Carrey maintains a foothold in the comedy world with films such as Bruce Allmächtig (2003) and Mr. Poppers Pinguine (2011), he is also capable of turning in nuanced dramatic performances, as demonstrated in films like Vergiss mein nicht (2004) and the drama/comedy Der Ja-Sager (2008). In 2013, he costars with Steve Carell in Der unglaubliche Burt Wonderstone (2013).\n\nCarrey has one child with his first wife, Melissa Carrey, whom he divorced in 1995. He married actress Lauren Holly in 1996, but they split less than a year later.\n\nJaeden Martell is an American actor known for his compelling performances in both film and television. He first gained recognition for his role as Bill Denbrough in the 2017 film adaptation of Stephen King's novel It (2017) and reprised this character in the 2019 sequel It Chapter Two (2019) . His other notable work includes a role in the mystery film Knives Out (2019) (2019) and starring in the miniseries Defending Jacob (2020). Born on January 4, 2003, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Jaeden is the son of Wes Lieberher, a Los Angeles-based executive chef, and Angela Teresa Martell. He has Korean heritage through his maternal grandmother, Chisun Martell. Initially growing up in South Philadelphia, he moved to Los Angeles at the age of eight in 2011. For the first six years of his career, he was credited under his family name, Lieberher, but in 2019, he adopted his mother's maiden name, Martell.\n\nJaeden's acting career began with a commercial for Hot Wheels and expanded to include various other advertisements for brands such as Google, Moneysupermarket.com, Liberty Mutual, Hyundai (for the 2013 Super Bowl), Verizon Fios, and General Electric. His first significant film role was in St. Vincent (2014) (2014), where he starred alongside Bill Murray. Murray later recommended Martell to Cameron Crowe, which led to his role in the 2015 film Aloha (2015) . He played the title character in The Book of Henry (2017) , further cementing his position as a talented young actor.\n\nIn addition to his early successes, Martell joined the cast of the Apple miniseries Defending Jacob (2020-2020) in March 2019, based on the novel by William Landay. He also confirmed his participation in the film Tunnels (????) as Grayson Mitchell during an Instagram Live interview with Teen Vogue on April 30, 2020; however, this film has yet to be released. In September 2021, he portrayed Morty Smith in promotional interstitials for the two-part fifth season finale of Rick and Morty (2013-) . In October 2021, he was cast as Craig in the Netflix film Men (2022) , directed by John Lee Hancock and based on the novella from Stephen King's Mr. Harrigan's Phone (2022) .\n\nContinuing to expand his filmography, Jaeden Martell appeared in Y2K (2024) and Arcadian (2024) in 2024. Both films showcase his versatility and commitment to developing complex characters. Through these roles and his consistent presence in both independent and major studio projects, Martell continues to establish himself as one of the most promising actors of his generation.\n\nAs a child growing up in Benton Harbor, Michigan, Ernie Hudson wrote short stories, poems and songs, always thinking that his words might one day come to life on stage. After a short stint in the Marine Corps, he moved to Detroit where he became the resident playwright at Concept East, the oldest Black theatre in the country. In addition, he enrolled at Wayne State University to further develop his writing and acting skills and found time to establish the Actors' Ensemble Theatre, where he and other talented young black writers directed and appeared in their own works. After graduating with a B.A. from Wayne State, he was rewarded a full scholarship to the M.F.A. program at the prestigious Yale School of Drama. While performing with the school's repertory company, he was asked to appear in the Los Angeles production of Lonne Elder III's musical \"Daddy Goodness,\" which led to his meeting Gordon Parks, who gave Hudson the costarring role in his first feature film, Leadbelly (1976). Unfortunately, all that followed \"Leadbelly\" was a year of \"bit parts and some harsh lessons about Hollywood,\" which led Hudson to enroll in another academic doctorate program at the University of Minnesota. He did not complete the program. Through his experience, he learned another vital lesson: \"There are those who spend their lives studying it and those who spend their lives doing it.\" Hudson definitely wanted to be in the second group. Keeping in mind this self-revelation, Hudson accepted the starring role of Jack Jefferson in the Minneapolis Theatre In The Round's production of \"The Great White Hope,\" a role that he put \"everything he had into,\" including shaving his head. A series of starring and guest roles followed on such television shows as Fantasy Island (1977), Der unglaubliche Hulk (1977), Unsere kleine Farm (1974), Noch Fragen Arnold? (1978), Taxi (1978), One Day at a Time (1975), Gimme a Break! (1981), Das A-Team (1983) and Webster (1983), as well as costarring roles in the TV movies White Mama (1980) with Bette Davis, Roots - Die nächsten Generationen (1979), Die Frauen von San Quentin (1983), Kalifornien, ich komme! (1985), Mad Bull - Der Supercatcher (1977) and Der Mörder und die Lady (1985). Other feature film credits include The Jazz Singer (1980), Was, du willst nicht? (1979), Spacehunter - Jäger im All (1983), Blutige Lorbeeren (1982), Auf die Bäume, ihr Affen! (1983), Joy of Sex (1984) and, of course, the mega-hit Ghostbusters - Die Geisterjäger (1984).\n\nL.L. Cool J was born James Todd Smith in Bay Shore, Long Island, New York, the son of Ondrea Griffith and James Louis Smith, Jr.\n\nTodd, as he was called, did not have a very happy childhood. At the age of four, he saw his mother and grandfather shot by his own father. After they recovered from their injuries, his mother began to date a young physical therapist she met while in the hospital. The therapist treated Ondrea kindly, but for years he abused Todd physically and verbally, which resulted in Todd becoming a bully himself. It was during this period that he started wearing hats all the time (one of L.L. Cool J's trademarks is the fact that people never see him without a hat on--until recently). Fortunately, Ondrea finally discovered what this man was doing to her son and left him.\n\nAs he grew older, Todd found a way to escape the effects of his abuse and his bullying attitude: hip-hop music. He fell in love with it at the age of nine, and by 11 he was writing lyrics and making his own songs with some DJ equipment his grandfather gave him. At 15, he and one of his best friends came up with his present stage name, L.L. Cool J, which means \"Ladies Love Cool James.\"\n\nIn 1984, when L.L. was 16, he met Rick Rubin, a student at NYU, who gave him his big break in music. Rick really liked L.L.'s music and decided to try to get him a record deal. Together, they made the single \"I Need a Beat\" and sent it to an artist manager named Russell Simmons. Simmons loved the single, and, in the same year, Rick and Russell co-founded the famous Def Jam Recordings; L.L.'s debut album, \"Radio,\" released in 1985, after securing a distribution deal for Def Jam with Columbia/CBS Records, was the label's first long-playing release. Even today, L.L. is considered one of Def Jam's most prized possessions.\n\n1985 was also the year L.L. started his acting career. He first appeared in Krush Groove (1985), which is a semi-biographical account of the early days of Def Jam Recordings. L.L. had a cameo appearance in the film. In 1986, L.L. also had a cameo appearance in the movie American Wildcats (1986) and also wrote that movie's theme song. After that, L.L. took a break from film and concentrated more on his first love: music. His career took off, and after every one of his albums hit platinum-selling status, he was (and still is) regarded as one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time.\n\nAfter a few years, he had small roles in a few other films, but was still better known for his music. All this changed in 1995. By this time he was a happily married 27-year-old with three children. His first starring film, Out-of-Sync (1995), had also been released. It didn't do very well at the box office, but it got him noticed by executives at NBC-TV, who wanted to give him a part in a sitcom they were going to air. This sitcom was Ein schrecklich nettes Haus (1995), which showed L.L.'s acting ability; the show stayed on the air until 1999.\n\nHe had been offered several films roles during the run of the show and decided to accept a part in Halloween H20 - 20 Jahre später (1998). Its success resulted in L.L. being cast in bigger and better film roles, and he has acted alongside such stars as Whoopi Goldberg, Samuel L. Jackson, Jamie Lee Curtis, James Woods, Al Pacino, Omar Epps, Pam Grier, Stanley Tucci, and Dennis Quaid, to name a few.\n\nIn 2000, he was finally rewarded for his acting talent. That year he won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for the best supporting actor in the action film Deep Blue Sea (1999). Even though his film career has taken off, he hasn't forgotten his love of hip-hop music. In 1998, he was planning to retire from hip-hop and just concentrate on his film career, but he later decided to keep dividing his time between both fields. L.L. is not only known as one of the greatest MCs of all time, but he is also known as a great actor."
