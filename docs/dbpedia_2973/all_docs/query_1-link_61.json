        "text": "SABATON are gearing up to release their brand new record this august!\n\nThe Swedish metallers are currently preparing to release their ninth studio record, titled The Last Stand, will be released in August this year!\n\nWe once work again with Peter Tägtgren in his newly upgraded and top class Abyss studio in Sweden to record, produce and mix the album. The mastering will be done by Jonas Kjellgren who also works in the same building in nice Pärlby on the countryside of Sweden. Both Carolus Rex and Heroes were done in the same way and we feel very comfortable to return to the same place and people again. Fans will recognize the sound of the album as SABATON, but we really feel we took it a step forward this time”, says Pär Sundström.\n\nAs fans will know, the themes of SABATON is all about war and conflict and The Last Stand is no different. “We had the idea to make an image reflecting soldiers of different times representing the different historical battles we sing about on the new album. This only reveals a small part of the album topics though” explains Sundström.\n\n“The concept of a last stand has always fascinated me, and both me and Pär were ”all in excited” about the subject so it was an easy choice to make”, says vocalist Joakim Broden about the album title The Last Stand. “We always have several ideas for albums to work with. Since there are countless different views and angles of war, we will unfortunately never run out of ideas. We kinda felt that the last stand was something perfect for SABATON. Something we really wanted to do. Heroes was a perfect theme and The Last Stand is right down our alley too. It was exciting to do the research”, adds Sundstöm.\n\nThe Last Stand is set for release on August 19th via Nuclear Blast Records."
