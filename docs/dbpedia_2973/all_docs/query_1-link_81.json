        "text": "They say, \"never ever gonna ′mount to anything in this life\"\n\nBut I've got some pride I′m not swallowing, call on it tonight\n\nAnd they may be right, dropped right outta my high school\n\nGot a gun to my head every night\n\nReal talk, with a trigger that I might pull\n\nNobody knows it, it's over for me\n\nI'm over the edge, an I′m blowing up inside\n\nCause I′m not who I'm supposed to be\n\nNobody′s chosen me\n\nToo sick for the heavens and yet\n\nI've neglected the demons in my head, I′m directed like I'm\n\nNever gonna get another chance at joy with somebody else\n\n′Cause I'm too vindictive, addicted to pain\n\nAnd yo, it might've helped\n\nIf I hadn′t read into this so stupidly\n\nIt could be you and me in the future, fucking in love, and mutually\n\nBut it′s never gonna be that way, life is looking down now\n\nGotta get my fam outta debt, Get my hands on a check\n\nWith a mic, I'm looking right out at the crowd\n\nIn my dreams, if you really wanna know what I mean\n\nThat′s too bad, 'cause I just don′t trust\n\nAnyone anymore, you're an enemy scene\n\nThis is my last stand, tell me what you really mean\n\n′Cause after this record I'm headed for the guillotine\n\nI can't take it\n\nI′ve made myself to be someone that I′m not and it's crazy\n\nSo save all your goodbyes\n\nI′m gonna give it to you one last time\n\nSo if you hear me\n\nJust throw your fists up\n\nYou're gonna miss me\n\nWhen I′m gone and I give up\n\nDay one I'ma take it slow\n\nHappiness, I can′t make it show\n\n'Cause I've been forgotten, there′s no fixing a forsaken home\n\nAnd the bread, I′ma make my dough\n\nWhatever means, I don't hustle crack\n\nBut whatever it takes, I′ma make my cake, and I might just bust a rap\n\nFor the green, I see no point\n\nTo be doing it free, my joints\n\nAre the hottest products up on the market, rocking, bringin' noise\n\nBut I can′t do that, cause I do rap for the fans when I need to vent\n\nAnd you'd better believe me\n\nThis ain′t easy\n\nI cannot breathe and bet\n\nThat if I collect a check, for the words in my notepad\n\nI'm giving it all away to my family, and it's so sad\n\nThat it really had to come to this but I′m a fuck up, and you love it so\n\nAnd the pain that I gain from the life\n\nThat I′m living isn't gonna get covered, no\n\nI just can′t keep up with my music life or my challenges\n\nBetween being me and pleasing you, I can't balance it\n\nAn′ this may be the last album if you don't stop sleeping and playing me\n\n′Cause you are never gonna hear another\n\nMotherfucker drop this shit like David G\n\nThis is my last stand, tell me what you really mean\n\n'Cause after this record I'm headed for the guillotine\n\nI can′t take it\n\nI′ve made myself to be someone that I'm not and it′s crazy\n\nSo save all your goodbyes\n\nI'm gonna give it to you one last time\n\nSo if you hear me\n\nJust throw your fists up\n\nYou′re gonna miss me\n\nWhen I'm gone and I give up\n\nYou′re gonna miss me\n\nYou're gonna miss me when I'm gone (gone, gone, gone, gone)\n\nYou′re gonna miss me\n\nYou′re gonna miss me when I'm gone (gone, gone, gone, gone)\n\nYou′re gonna miss me (miss me, miss me, miss me)\n\nThis is my last stand, tell me what you really mean\n\n'Cause after this record I′m headed for the guillotine\n\nI can't take it\n\nI′ve made myself to be someone that I'm not and it's crazy\n\nSo save all your goodbyes\n\nI′m gonna give it to you one last time\n\nSo if you hear me\n\nJust throw your fists up\n\nYou′re gonna miss me\n\nWhen I'm gone and I give up\n\nWriter(s): David Gonzalez<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
