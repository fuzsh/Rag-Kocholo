        "text": "Label: Nuclear Blast Release: 19th August 2016 Playing Tme: 37 Min\n\nSabaton are Sabaton. Everyone knows them. And either you love them or you hate them. None of that facts will change in 2016 because “The Last Stand” continues seemlessly what was started on its predecessors. So most fans of the band will be happy that Sabaton still sound like Sabaton.\n\nWhile I loved most releases of the band in the past, this does not affect me much. Why? Joakim Broden is still a good songwriter and he really knows how to write good, catchy melodies. Besides some good songs, there are also some great ones, ‚Sparta’ and ‚The Last Battle’. But most of the melodies on “The Last Stand” and even more of the lyrics sound like they had been used before. Or in other words: The absolute majority of the songs would also fit on the previous albums. There are also 2 more or less unique songs, ‘The Battle of Bannockburn’ and ‘The Lost Battalion’. But for my taste, the rate of repetitions is much too high. This does not make “The Last Stand” a bad album, but it adds a stale flavour.\n\nwww.sabaton.net"
