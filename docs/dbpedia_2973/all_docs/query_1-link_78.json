        "text": "In the last few months, Real Gone Music has announced a number of welcome reissues of soundtracks on LP. Next up in the series are two soundtracks to hard-to-find films, due out February 1: one by a countercultural hero and voice of experimentation, the other by a pair of Faces who explore a rural blend of folk-rock.\n\nTimothy Leary remains one of the legends of the sixties counterculture scene. He cashed in on the hippies' sense of adventure and experimentation to become a spokesperson for LSD, in particular. In 1967, Leary, his partner Rosemary, and his fellow adventurer Ralph Metzner created a film called Tune In, Turn On, Drop Out. The film presumably documents an LSD trip undertaken by Metzner, although the film rarely, if ever, showed in theaters so the jury's out on the content. Nevertheless, Mercury Records released a soundtrack, also entitled Tune In, Turn On, Drop Out. Not to be confused with the spoken word album of the same name that arrived on the ESP-Disk label in 1966, the Mercury title is more than just Leary's raps. The soundtrack also features groovy, \"East-meets-West\" accompaniment with a blend of guitar, the Indian tabla and veena, as well as sound effects and musique concrete elements. Over the course of the 10 tracks, Leary guides Metzner through the steps of a trip, reflecting on the body, memory, and his cellular evolutionary origins. Rosemary Leary, meanwhile, acts as a \"divine connection,\" echoing Leary's sentiments. Real Gone's version of the far-out album will be pressed on \"kaleidoscope\" red, blue, and green vinyl and is limited to 1,600 copies.\n\nOn the same day, Real Gone will release the soundtrack to the film Mahoney's Last Stand, featuring a soundtrack by The Faces' Ron Wood and Ronnie Lane. Though the film and its soundtrack were produced in 1972--Wood and Lane cut the tracks in between sessions for Ooh La La--neither production saw the light of day until 1976. The low-budget film, entitled Mahoney's Estate in the U.S., starred Alexis Kanner, Sam Wasterson, and Maud Adams and tracked the life of Mahoney (Kanner) as he \"went back to the land,\" retiring from his urban life to one of self-sufficient farming in the Canadian countryside.\n\nThough the film was a flop and apparently only screened once, the soundtrack LP has remained something of a cult release, due in part to the immense talent that performed on it. The 1972 sessions were produced by Glyn Johns and feature Pete Townshend, session bassist/ex-Blind Faith member Ric Grech, fellow Faces Ian MacLagan and Kenney Jones, as well as Rolling Stones friends Ian Stewart, Bobby Keys, and Jim Price. The result was a collection of songs that are at times rocking and funky and at others distinctly rural.\n\nWhile this missing piece in Wood and Lane's careers has appeared a few times on CD over the years (including from Real Gone), this version marks its first-ever U.S. vinyl reissue. The title will be limited to 700 copies and will be pressed on green vinyl.\n\nYou can get your copy of Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out and Mahoney's Last Stand on February 1.
