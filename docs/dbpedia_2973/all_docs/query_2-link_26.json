        "text": "Quite simply, Andrew Dice Clay is a rock and roll comedy legend and proud to be one of America's most outrageous comics. When he released his debut album, Dice, the parental advisory label simply read “Warning: This album is offensive.”\n\nDespite media backlash, Dice’s rise to fame was nothing less than meteoric, creating “Dicemania.” He’s sold-out hundreds of arenas across the country, famously sold-out Madison Square Garden (MSG) two nights in a row in 1990 and was the only performer ever “Banned for Life from MTV” (a ban which has since been lifted).\n\nDice has released numerous gold and platinum-selling albums including the Rick Rubin-produced The Day The Laughter Died (among the five releases Rubin produced for Dice); best-selling DVDs (Dice Rules!); and starred in several one-hour HBO, pay per view, and Showtime stand-up specials including No Apologies, The Diceman Cometh, and Indestructible.\n\nIn recent years, Dice’s career has experienced a resurgence including his recurring role on the final season ofEntourage (2011). He starred to great critical acclaim alongside Cate Blanchett and Alec Baldwin in Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine (2013); in Martin Scorsese’s Vinyl (2016); in the award winning, blockbuster hit, A Star Is Born (2018) alongside Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga; and in Hulu’s Pam & Tommy (2022). His other notable TV credits include two seasons (2016-2017) of his Showtime series, called Dice, very loosely based on his own life.\n\nDice is currently on the road receiving rave reviews with his stand-out shows. Recent highlights include a notable set between Chrissie Hynde and Guns N’ Roses at MetLife Stadium in August 2023 - a performance harkened back to ‘92 when Dice shared the stage with GNR at the Rose Bowl and performed in front of the largest audience ever by a comedian at that time.\n\nDice recently wrapped his role in the upcoming Eddie Murphy heist comedy The Pickup, also featuring Pete Davidson and Keke Palmer.\n\nCurrently, Dice’s “on the street” videos on Instagram and TikTok have resulted in him being hailed as a contemporary cultural phenomenon tackling the modern zeitgeist."
