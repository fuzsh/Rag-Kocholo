        "text": "I remember feeling very conflicted with Happier Than Ever - I had the lingering feeling that it was great, which eventually crystallized over time and had me call it one of the best albums of 2021, but it was the sort of album that convinced me if we never got another project from Billie Eilish, I would not have been surprised. It was also a project that attracted the kind of intense scrutiny that felt distinctly… weird - yeah, some of it was tied to pandemic conditions, there’s a lot of weird shit said and done online that many would rather forget - there was the bodyshaming, folks calling it her flop era because the singles were more soft-focus and sedate and the album was more difficult and introspective, and let’s not forget all the accusations of queerbaiting, which look a certain type of way now that she’s come out. I dunno, you’d think the audience who was aggressively loud and wrong - and who Billie was intensely aware of and wrote about on this album - might do some personal reflection on the discourse they perpetuated, but nobody wants that now, do they?\n\nIn any case, despite what the internet might say and my own thoughts that she might just disappear, Billie Eilish stuck around: 2022 was quiet for her outside of an EP that was quite strong and touring - I’ve seen her live twice, she’s phenomenal - but ‘What Was I Made For?’ came through in 2023 for the Barbie movie and got her a second Oscar and another big Grammy win, which felt predictable but also more deserved, that song is incredible. But I really had no context of what was coming for her third album HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. No singles were pushed, I knew it was shorter in running only ten songs, she was still only working with her brother Finneas for production of which I don’t have complaints - better he produces for her than his own projects - and while the critical acclaim once again poured in, I’ve heard very little context around said acclaim, so I was going in blind here and hoping for the best, conscious of how at the time I described Happier Than Ever as transitional… so where did we wind up?\n\n…so albums like this can really frustrate me, not because they are bad or because I don’t hear all the reasons this is getting a ton of critical acclaim: even if I think comparing this to Joni Mitchell’s Blue is wildly hyperbolic, it’s hard for me to listen to this album and not think… ‘well, it seems like she’s doing everything right, the quality is self-evident, it’s not like it’s far removed from her last two projects’. But the more listens I’ve given to HIT ME HARD AND SOFT, the more I’m left thinking that the ghost of a much more compelling album is just out of frame, where more chances are taken or followed through and everyone sticks the landing - or even if they don’t, you wind up with a project that hits harder and feels more idiosyncratically hers. And what’s even worse is that I intellectually get the logic behind a lot of the decisions made here, and they make sense, and Billie is a strong enough performer to stick the landing, and Finneas is still one of the best producers working in mainstream pop… but this feels like another lateral move for me; following in the path of Happier Than Ever, it’s easily her most tasteful, well-composed, and even-keeled project to date, and while that’s gotten rid of the obvious missteps, I’m not sure the highest peaks are here either.\n\nBut let’s start with Billie Eilish herself, where arguably the most positive changes have happened: her voice and vocal technique is only getting more refined and potent with age. While she may have stuck with soft, whispered vocals early on with an outright aversion to singing loudly, on this album there’s a deeper well of sensuality and tenderness to her delivery that has real character to it as she dips into more vocal runs - she’s really trying to sell the romance on performance and she’s getting there - or a song like ‘LUNCH’ just how horny she can be with the breathy moans on the outro - even when she does choose to belt and prove that even if she doesn’t like doing it, she really can pull it off, with the only vocal melody hook I didn’t particularly like coming on ‘CHIHIRO’ and I think the vocal mix is all over the place for that song anyway! She even dispenses with a lot of the usual warping synthetic effects… well, except when she’s using them to make a point, like when she slathers on the autotune for ‘L’AMOUR DE MA VIE’ , in its flashing, pulsating dance break outro, or writing from the perspective of a stalker on ‘THE DINER’ which is probably the closest throwback to her first two albums. The cynical part of me thinks that her proving that she really can open up and sing more loudly is subtle proof that she’s not just defined by soft-spoken indie girl cooing - although there’s a lot of that on this album too - but Billie is a great performer in both lanes, and I know it’ll translate live.\n\nIn fact, I have to wonder how much the production was tailored for a live environment, not just in the continued well-balanced emphasis on groove with more of a rock swagger in those basslines, but as many of these songs change up or press into other genres how they can feel damn near house in the synth palette and faster tempos, like on ‘CHIHIRO’ with the sharper klaxons and sandy percussion, or how ‘L’AMOUR DE MA VIE’ erupts with these 80s-inspired synths that are unlike anything Billie has ever used, or those more distorted buildups across ‘THE GREATEST’ and ‘BITTERSUITE’, the latter of which starts interestingly with its broad, buzzy synths before going into its glassy lounge vibes with that sandy cymbal into something like a borderline dirge with those heavier synths, with a really cool flourish on the outro. But that’s evidence of the first niggling issue I have with this album: many of these ideas are explored through a cool transition for an outro passage that’s barely a third of the song, a cool showcase of an idea and something that Finneas could produce well, but then they’re abandoned before they can pay off any striking climax or really do something melodically. Meanwhile, the songs that are more in their comfort zone with soft-focus acoustics, gentle percussion, thicker wells of bass, sometimes even something closer to lounge music or sophistipop especially as Finneas pulls together some admittedly striking strings arrangements, these are tracks that are allowed to take their time, set a more chic and sophisticated mood, playing up the soft-focus smooth lounge romance, with the change-ups implying a greater sense of instability below the surface. Which again, feels like the desired mood, and Finneas’ guitar production has improved considerably, the interplay with the bass across ‘LUNCH’ is proof of that… but for lack of better words, it’s a sound that doesn’t feel nearly as unique and idiosyncratic compared to the late 2010s, there is a lot of sad, alternative-leaning pop that’s very tastefully arranged but can start running together. The difference of course is that Finneas’ grooves are more accentuated - which can have its drawbacks with the occasional drum machine sounding awkwardly brittle and a little less intentionally so, with ‘CHIHIRO’ and ‘BLUE’ both standing out here, and we get plenty of teasers for other spaces they could take the sound… but it never feels like there’s much followthrough, and the atmosphere seems to have less bite and character. Again, I know that’s intentional - Billie has been softening that edge for a while now, and given the themes of this album it wouldn’t have made sense to chase for one of those darker bangers - but it winds up feeling like it’s a tool missing from the arsenal, and given how serious ‘THE DINER’ is being taken, with its twisted vision from an obsessed stalker’s perspective, it doesn’t really nail that atmosphere. And while we’re here, while there’s still some of that darker, playful humor that would manifest in samples or quirkier flourishes, it’s nearly gone here outside of ‘LUNCH’, and without that tonal juxtaposition on this album, it can start feeling lethargic very quickly, especially when the switch-ups feel like a tease and never quite establish momentum; it’s the sort of album where I get why Billie wanted it to be pitched as a whole album statement rather than drip-feeding singles… because a fair few of these songs would struggle to stand out on their own, especially as it often feels like Billie’s vocal lead is nestled a bit deeper into the mixes than she usually is - as the arrangements get more lush, it can be tougher to define that hook.\n\nBut again, the more listens I’ve given, the more I’m convinced that’s the point, and that takes us to themes and content… which oddly feel more straightforward than you might otherwise expect. In essence, this is an album showcasing the arc of a distinctly sapphic relationship - Billie is very careful and canny to avoid much in the way of identifying details, we’ll come back to that - and a breakup that hits her pretty hard by the very end. There is establishing context for her state of mind - ‘SKINNY’ is a very slow-paced opener but it works for showing her continued frustrations with the confines of celebrity and what that sort of acclaim has done to her self-esteem in questions of whether it’s genuine or just for an idealized version of her - and from there you get traces of how it plays out, Billie falling a little too hard and too fast, with ‘WILDFLOWER’ implying that it’s for an ex of a friend that leads to a guilt she can’t quite shake, but the relationship feels one-sided where she’s doing too much, and then the breakup hits, where the partner moves on fast and she realizes this person was indeed not the love of her life. It’s a reason I actually have no issue with ‘THE DINER’ and its stalking story popping up on the album - perhaps a bit awkwardly sequenced, it feels like it should come earlier, but if she wants to draw the ironic juxtaposition between an overcommitted partner and a stalker, that’s effective. And as the album ends, with her stranded in hotels for discreet rendezvouses she referenced on Happier Than Ever - the reality of touring so much - and longing for connect, the final track ‘BLUE’ is probably the most sobering, not just in its direct reference point to previous tracks on the album but also in the details of their lives that would have driven them apart with time, where the partner’s issues with family and Billie’s perpetual insomnia means that she can’t really blame anyone for it not working or hate the partner, but she’s also aware she can’t change it either, and that feels very mature; ironic that at on ‘SKINNY’ she sardonically says ‘am I acting my age now’ and by ‘BLUE’… no, sadly you still sound older than your years, ask Taylor Swift off of her last album how much of a curse that can be. And as it all seems to end, we get the throwaway spoken line ‘but when can I hear the next one’, which immediately implies that Billie’s aware that the soft-focus, deeply low-key exploration of heartbreak isn’t exactly built for the mainstream smash success - even if it’ll probably have it, more on this in a bit - but by placing it in her art, the commodification and turnover process starts anew, which is a deeper, very meta resonance that I appreciate…\n\n…and yet, I feel like there’s something in the writing that should be hitting harder here, and it’s tough to pin down what it precisely is. Part of it might be the lack of idiosyncratic humour and odd swerves that have peppered her career - this album feels more ‘respectable’ in all aspects, which is what she set out to do but can have the downside of diminishing some of her unique personality - and where she’s gotten more meta before about her career in music, Happier Than Ever had more introspective detail. Yes, her newfound queerness adds a different and welcome texture to her storytelling, but the writing feels built for more broadly universal themes, that Billie isn’t just looking to tell a story that can only be linked to her. And that makes sense on a number of levels - her desire for privacy especially in comparison with mainstream pop acts in her space that overshare, where I think she’s tapped in enough to recognize there are some audiences sick of that style, and there’s truth that within mainstream pop, the queer framing and normalization of these love and breakup songs is incredibly valuable. But the other side of the coin is that if you’re only considering the mainstream, there’s a broad swathe of queer indie pop that plays to a very similar palette to Billie Eilish in recent years that is ahead of the game, which leaves some of these songs feeling more tentative and guarded. And that’s fine too… if it didn’t feel like it came at the expense of Billie Eilish’s personal stylism of which we get plenty of teases but limited payoff. What’s frustrating is that again, I can’t argue that Billie didn’t deliver exactly what she set out to do here, and or that a specific audience won’t find a ton of resonance - what it feels like is a choice to prioritize a specific resonance that she knows isn’t for everyone, but it’s where her muse has taken her, and I can respect that even if emotionally I’m not nearly as gripped.\n\nAnd I think that’s where I fall in an odd space with HIT ME HARD AND SOFT: a project I very much like and respect but don’t love - it’s Billie Eilish’s formula further refined in multiple senses of the word, as her voice and grooves only continue to get better and she sketches a pretty strong, self-contained arc and theme, easily her most tasteful album to date. I miss the humour and pitch-black swerves, and I get the feeling that Billie knows that, and I’m not about to demand she retread that material when exploring this part of herself is a much higher and emotionally fraught priority. I just wish I connected as strongly with it as so many critics have - all the more annoying because I can hear what is driving that connection, it’s just not fully sticking. Still, very good album, I’m curious to see if it also grows on me as strongly as Happier Than Ever did… not my favourite of hers, I wish the hit was a little harder, but I can appreciate the softness all the same."
