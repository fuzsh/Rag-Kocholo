        "text": "Upstairs in the bathroom insulated from the blaring pulse of Afrobeats and dancehall, women in black miniskirts and tight dresses were drying their arms and legs. We’d withstood a torrential downpour to get into New York City’s Musica nightclub for Rema’s Heis listening party, celebrating the second album of the same name he released last month to critical acclaim. He had first christened the album with romp in London, wild clips from which blasted around the internet. Now, he was bringing the noise stateside.\n\nThough Rema had long called his style of Afrobeats “Afro-rave,” there was little particularly rave-ready about it until Heis, a jarringly intense evolution of the Nigerian party music that defined the early 2010s in the diaspora. The event demanded an all-black dress code, matching both the album’s dark energy and, incidentally, the stormy night. All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom looked pristine, even with rain-waved hair and damp skin.\n\nMusica’s main floor is flooded with bodies well before Rema’s arrival, with local-but-global DJs Mohogany, Brandon Blue and mOma readying the crowd. Alongside professional dancers hyping the crowd on stage, mOma, who co-hosts the popular traveling day party Everyday People around the world, runs a set that includes an edit of soca house classic “Work” (“What ya waiting for? Put ya back in it! Just a little more!” goes its popular refrain sung by Denise Belfon) and last year’s amapiano hit “Mnike” by Tyler ICU. It also includes “Bicycle,” by recently unincarcerated dancehall star Vybz Kartel, and, as has become customary at large gatherings, Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us.” You can hear the fists and palms collide from every corner when Kendrick cries “WOP WOP WOP WOP WOP, Dot, fuck ‘em up!”\n\nAlmost unceremoniously, Rema emerges from doors tucked far behind and catty-cornered from the stage, moving in a mob of friends, affiliates, and security to a section on the other end of the platform, through the mass of VIPs already hanging out behind the DJ booth. Though it was a muggy 70 degrees outside and much hotter in the packed venue, Rema wears a knit black beanie and heavy leather coat with diamond chains glistening from underneath. With his eyes guarded behind chunky black shades, he’s smoking what looks like a cigarette, a new calling card for his Heis era. Professional and iPhone photographers vie for footage of Rema as he ascends on top of a couch against a wall, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Nigerian singer Joeboy, his popular producer London (Rema and Selena Gomez’s “Calm Down,” Ayra Starr’s “Bloody Samaritan,” Tiwa Savage’s “Koroba”), Ghanaian singer King Promise, and eventually, New York City’s own Ferg. Shaboozey and Emily Ratajkowski are somewhere among the melee.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nRema only takes the stage after enjoying more of his cigarette, giving his crew time to hydrate with water and cocktails, and letting the exclusive batch of VIP onlookers bask in their presence. As his posse makes their way in infront of the DJ, a woman next to me bolts away from a man who embarrassingly clamored to get near her so she can get a better view of Rema. Operatic music crescendos as he and his friends take their place in front of the crowd under green strobes, still smoking. Then, there’s the sound of glass shattering. “When I say another what? You say another?” he says, testing the crowd with his signature tagline. “Another?”\n\n“Banger!” we scream giddily.\n\n“I don’t wanna take too much of your time, I wanna say thank you for coming out tonight,” he says with a sheepish, bright white grin. “I know it’s raining – you made it, you made it.” There’s more screaming before he makes a plea. “I want nothing but your energy,” he says, repeating the request four times, rapid fire. And true to his word, “March Am,” the frenzied first track on Heis, drops without much ado. Rema sways and bounces like he’s powering up, cupping his ear to beckon us to sing along.\n\nTrending\n\nRelated\n\nThe DJ runs through the album with few breaks – the strobes turn fire red for the electric percussion that kicks off “Azaman.” They go bright white then cobalt blue for “HEHEHE,” to which Rema jumps with so much vim he could’ve launched himself into the ceiling. He circles his hands to outline an imaginarily giant ass when the line “Ikebe super, oya, shake am,” plays from “Villian.” He struts with his elbows up and out to “Benin Boys,” and raps Shallipoppi’s verse with even more fervor than his own lyrics. He keeps a mic in hand and impressively manages to perform more loudly than his voice on the tracks when he decides to. London, also in a leather jacket, two-steps with a dainty, pink, handheld electric fan cooling his face."
