        "text": "RELEASE DATE: August 19, 2016RECORD LABEL: Nuclear BlastPRODUCER: Peter Tägtgren\n\nThe eighth chapter in our musical journey marked a huge moment for the band which set the stage for unprecedented success and experiences.\n\nWe wanted to write another concept album that delved into the stories of extraordinary military battles, showcasing acts of defiance by outnumbered or outgunned forces. We noticed in the past that when we sang about the underdogs in military history, it was a fulfilling experience for us! Thus, “The Last Stand” was born.\n\nThe album spans millennia, from the renowned Battle of Thermopylae in ancient Greece to the tale of a small group of paratroopers fending off 250 rebels during the Soviet-Afghan War in 1988. We didn’t always have to write about tanks and guns… We could write about swords and armour too. Mixing things up keeps things interesting, and that’s something we continue to do to this day!\n\nUpon its release on August 19, 2016, our eighth studio album surged in popularity and was hailed by many as our finest album yet. Critics and fans alike eagerly embraced its arrival, sparking a buzz within the metal music industry and community.\n\nThe album would lead us to incredible new milestones. We began playing in larger clubs and venues, and found ourselves higher up the bill in festival lineups. Each album we have released throughout our career so far has marked a significant step forward for Sabaton as a band, and “The Last Stand” was no different…\n\nTHE CONCEPT\n\nFor the album that would follow “Heroes”, we didn’t feel the need to stray from our ethos and usual formula. We had no obligations to create something completely new – it just needed to be GOOD. A good concept with powerful songs.\n\nYou may think that searching for an album concept is challenging. For some, it may be, but for us, it’s usually a piece of cake and we follow our gut! Although we did have a different historical theme in mind, the idea of last stands seemed like the perfect choice. There are so many epic last stands in history; so many stories that hold the potential for an epic song with awesome guitar riffs and solos that pack a punch. The concept was decided upon just one month before production for the album started.\n\nFor “The Last Stand”, our approach remained largely unchanged. Joakim took charge of most of the music, while Pär gathered the initial ideas and topics. Fun fact: we often collect topics without fully researching them until it’s time to write the songs. This way, the material stays fresh in our minds and inspiration flows naturally when we need it most.\n\nA lot of research went into a number of the songs on this album, but some of them required very little to none, purely because these stories are so well known. The first song on the album, “Sparta”, was easy to write and required zero research because it’s something that’s so common in pop culture. Take the movie “300” for instance! Other tracks, such as “The Last Battle” or “Rorke’s Drift”, required us to dig a little deeper in order to find out more.\n\nWe made a point of picking a healthy mix of well known last stands and lesser known stories that interested us. We think this album offers a good balance! We want to make sure that we introduced something never-been-heard or known before to each of our albums.\n\nIN OUR ELEMENT\n\nWhen it comes to sound, “The Last Stand” is really bombastic and quite epic. We all wanted to beat “Carolus Rex” and “Heroes”, so we gave it everything we had, and our long-time producer, Peter, pushed us to our limits. We felt that some of the songs on this record would go down in Sabaton’s very own hall of fame, which later happened.\n\nSome of Joakim’s crazier, more ‘out there’ ideas materialised in “The Last Stand”. The album’s sound is massive and quite aggressive at times – Joakim once described it as “a movie soundtrack gone industrial”.\n\nOn the whole, the recording process was the smoothest it’s ever been this time round. Everyone knew each other very well by this point so we were all really comfortable working together. We each added our own spice to the album too!\n\nMeanwhile, Peter took what he did in “Carolus Rex” and multiplied it, taking the big sound we previously had and pushing it one step further. We somehow took influences from all corners of the world of metal and rock music and injected them into this album. This made it more theatrical and created a rollercoaster ride with peaks and valleys. There were some really cool new elements that we added to the album such as a Hammond organ, bagpipes and even a drum kit made from the sounds of a machine gun, a 9mm pistol and a bayonet being pushed into human flesh. Gnarly, right?! We’d never done anything quite like this before!\n\nThe cherry on the top of all of the above was that we were so at ease during the recording sessions that we had BBQs every day. We were relaxed and enjoying what we were doing. We were in our element!\n\nTHE STORIES BEHIND THE SONGS\n\n“The Last Stand” is filled to the brim with incredible stories of last stands – some that are known the world over and some that are lesser known tales of bravery.\n\nThe album kicks off with “Sparta”, a song that deeply resonates with our fans in Greece! This track is about the Battle of Thermopylae, which took place in Ancient Greece. King Leonidas and a small number of soldiers – including 300 of his warriors from the state of Sparta – died making a brave last stand against an invading force of around 100,000 Persians, according to historians. When writing the music for this song, Joakim asked for Pär’s input, and when he heard what Joakim had written, Pär immediately said “Guys, I’m not hearing a metal song. I’m hearing the soundtrack to the movie 300!” – and that’s how the topic was selected!\n\n“Defence Of Belgrade” is an ode to the bravery of Serbia’s soldiers. Following the complete failure of the Austro-Hungarian invasion of Serbia in 1914 during World War 1, it was time for them to try again with the newly re-organised Austro-Hungarian 3rd Army. On October 9, 1915, the fall of Belgrade was declared, but not without one hell of a fight! The Serbian fighters knew they didn’t stand a chance and bravely sacrificed their lives for their motherland. Pär was inspired to write this song after reading the speech of Major Dragutin Gavrilovic. When this song was performed in Belgrade, Serbia, we had this speech recorded by a famous Serbian actor. It moved us to tears to witness the crowd’s reaction to the recording – they knew the words by heart. This was one of the top highlights of our entire career!\n\n“Blood Of Bannockburn” is track three on “The Last Stand” and tells the story of Scotland being at war with England for its independence. In 1314, the Scots went up against the English army and besieged Stirling Castle. In retaliation, England’s King Edward II sent a mighty force to end the siege, but the Scots, led by their King, Robert the Bruce, defeated them at Bannockburn with a much smaller army. This song is pretty uplifting as it’s in a major key. We love playing it live and people in Scotland really appreciate it. We’ve actually performed it in Scottish war paint and kilts!\n\n“Diary Of An Unknown Soldier” is track 4 and serves as an introduction to the sound of our “war drum kit” which we use in the song that follows (“The Lost Battalion”). It features a narrator who explains what the different sounds are one-by-one. Meanwhile, “The Lost Battalion” is about the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in October 1918. 554 all-American soldiers, who were part of the 77th Division, were completely surrounded by the German army. They were known as ‘The Lost Battalion’ and they inspired this track. The soldiers were subjected to friendly fire as well as enemy fire, and only 194 of them made it out alive. It’s an incredible story! But how did we hear about it? Many years back, a friend named Mike gave us a book called The Lost Battalion, and the rest is history. This is a very different song featuring the aforementioned “war drum kit”. The kick drum is a machine gun; the snare drum is a 9mm handgun; and the high hat is a bayonet going into flesh (a bit macabre, we know!).\n\nThe next song on the album, “Rorke’s Drift”, is about Colonial Africa. One of history’s most renowned last stands, the Battle of Rorke’s Drift took place in 1879 during the Anglo-Zulu war. For two days, 150 British and colonial soldiers defended the Rorke’s Drift mission station in South Africa while being attacked by 4,000 Zulu warriors. Thanks to better firepower, organisation and morale, the few stood against the many!\n\nAfter this comes “The Last Stand”, which is actually the first song we ever wrote with Chris. It’s one of the most popular tracks on this album and possibly the most popular Sabaton track. It’s about the Sack of Rome. In 1527, the outnumbered Swiss Guard, protectors of the Vatican, stood against an invading horde, giving their lives so the Pope could escape before the horde got to him.\n\nTrack 8 on the album is “Hill 3234”. The Battle for Hill 3234 was fought by Soviet troops in Afghanistan to secure an important strategic road. 39 Soviets faced 250 well-armed Mujahideen rebels over the course of two days, suffering heavy casualties but ultimately prevailing.\n\nFollowing this is “Shiroyama”, a song that Joakim is really fond of. It has an 80s movie vibe to it. This track was written about the Satsuma Rebellion – the last revolt of the samurai against the imperial government of emperor Meiji. Ending with the famous Battle of Shiroyama, the uprising marks the final chapter of Japan’s most famous warriors. This song very much explains that the technology of advanced weaponry was too much for the Samurai. They simply could not compete.\n\nCan you guess which song resulted in the most memes? That’s right! It’s “Winged Hussars”, which is track number 9 on “The Last Stand”. When we wrote this song, we knew it was the catchiest moment of the album. It was written about the Battle of Vienna in 1683, whereby 140,000 soldiers of the Ottoman Empire were tearing the city’s defences apart. They were driven away when a relief force, comprising the famed Winged Hussars of Poland, arrived to save the city. This battle has not only inspired Sabaton, but a lot of literature and art, including the second Lord Of The Rings book. Anyone seen the scene in the movie where the riders of Rohan charge down the mountain towards The Hornburg?\n\nConcluding the album, barring the bonus tracks, is “The Last Battle”. When Joakim read about this incredible story, he instantly knew it was going to be a Sabaton song. This song is a little more uplifting, positive and catchy. Not all heavy metal songs need to be super dark. “The Last Battle” tells the story of the retrieval of high-profile French hostages at Castle Itter in Austria on May 5, 1945. This was thanks to an unlikely alliance: an American Army captain, a Waffen SS officer and a German Army Major! This is one of our most popular underestimated songs!\n\nLOOKING BACK…\n\nSo this marks the end of our eighth album story. On the whole, we believe this specific studio album possesses all the elements that a Sabaton album should possess. It’s clear we have a musical identity and it’s one we’re really proud of, but if there’s variation in any Sabaton album, it’s this one.\n\n“The Last Stand” garnered huge international success. It reached #1 in the album charts of Sweden, Finland, Czech Republic and Switzerland. But not only this, it got to #2 in the album charts in Germany, #4 in Belgium and was featured in the album charts of the Netherlands, Norway, Hungary, the UK, Australia and Ireland. In September 2016, it took 6th place in the worldwide charts and we couldn’t believe it. All our hard work and dedication was paying off. What an achievement!\n\nAnd finally, as a side note, before the release of “The Last Stand”, we had never performed so many songs from a new album on tour. Once the album was released, fans were demanding we play these tracks, and we were more than happy to oblige. It’s a very good sign when fans are eager to hear a band’s latest material at a live show and not just the traditional anthems!\n\nAnd so, the Sabaton story continues…"
