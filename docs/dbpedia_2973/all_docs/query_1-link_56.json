        "text": "A new compilation from German progressive / hard rock band Luciferâ€™s Friend marks the end of this great band, following the losses of founding members Dieter Horns [bass] last year, and singer John Lawton earlier this year. The band had began in 1970, and continued until 1981 with Lawton leaving the band in 1976 to join Uriah Heep, then returning for one album in 1980 following the departure of his replacement Mike Starrs. The band regrouped in 1994 as Luciferâ€™s Friend II, minus founding member â€“ keyboard player Peter Hecht, and with a new drummer, and released the album Sumo Grip. They disbanded again, but Lawton, Horns, and guitarist Peter Hesslein would reunite again in 2014 to record some new songs for the compilation Awakening in 2015. They then played some shows in 2015, when they would record Live At Sweden Rock [issued the next year]. 2016 also saw the release of a brand new studio album titled Too Late To Hate, which was followed by 2019â€™s excellent Black Moon album. During this time health issues prevented the band from playing live before the Covid pandemic started in 2020. At the time of Black Moon John Lawton stated that another album was largely done, and was just awaiting his vocals. But Covid had closed the studio John would normally work out of, so no chance to record seems to have shelved this project. Sadly, In December of last year Dieter Horns, who had had recent health issues contracted Covid-19, and passed away in hospital. Further tragic news came when John Lawton suddenly passed away on June 29 of this year, leaving fans shocked. Late last year Peter Hesslein released his first solo [instrumental] album Night Drive, and is set to release the follow up, Night Drive 2.\n\nThe Last Stand is a fitting touch to end the bandâ€™s catalogue (unless of course, thereâ€™s things in the vaults ðŸ™‚ ) . It is compiled by Hesslein, from the albums from Sumo Grip, up until Black Moon.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1 Heartbreaker\n\n2 Sheree\n\n3 Ride The Sky â€˜94\n\n4 You Touched Me With Your Heart\n\n5 Pray\n\n6 Did You Ever\n\n7 Demolition Man\n\n8 When Children Cry\n\n9 Straight For The Heart\n\n10 This Time\n\n11 Black Moon\n\n12 Passengers\n\n13 Call The Captain\n\n14 Freedom\n\n15 When Youâ€™re Gone (Live)\n\nKJ, 09 /â€™21"
