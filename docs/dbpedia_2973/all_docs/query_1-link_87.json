        "text": "First vinyl release of the album from Farm Dogs, a country rock band led by Bernie Taupin (Elton John lyricist), originally released on the Warner label Discover in 1996. Last Stand in Open Country is a lost gem, the kind of music you want to hear as the sun sets, stoke a fire and keep good company with friends and dogs (very much in the vein of Tumbleweed Connection-era Elton John). The band is comprised of Bernie Taupin on vocals, Jim Cregan on guitars and vocals (Family, Rod Stewart to name just two of his affiliations), Robin Le Mesurier on guitars and dobro (also Rod Stewart), Dennis Tufano on harp and vocals (The Buckinghams) and Tony Brock on drums.\n\nTracklist\n\nA1.
