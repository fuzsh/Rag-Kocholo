        "text": "He adds, “Dog Day Afternoon influenced this work greatly. It's a film that peels back layers to reveal who we are at our core, especially when faced with extreme, chaotic situations and no way out.”\n\nWith the release of this third video, Maxwell concludes the trio of crime and tension-themed visuals that form the narrative backbone of 'Lone Rider.' The album, released last summer, is an anthology of characters and their edge-of-society stories, all brought to life with lush orchestral arrangements and powerful, evocative vocals.\n\nVenture into the raw, emotional landscape D.C. Maxwell has painted with 'Lone Rider,' and let the album's tales of love, loss, and outlaw lives resonate with the outlaw spirit in you.\n\nABOUT D.C. MAXWELL\n\nD. C. Maxwell is an alt-country singer-songwriter from New Zealand. Formerly the teenage frontman of the high-octane punk band Roidz, Maxwell has grown up to become a tender songwriter who doesn’t shy away from the fiery performance of his songs. With the frenetic energy of a punk preacher, he puts a new spin on the 1970s outlaw country of Lee Hazlewood and Townes Van Zandt. A troubadour, a magnetic performer, but foremost a storyteller, Maxwell’s live show sees him physically embody each of his song’s characters with passion. The mosaic of his songs creates a world of love and loss in roadside motel rooms and the inner lives of small-town dreamers majestic as the plains.\n\nCalled “indisputably one of Tāmaki Makaurau’s hottest rising talents” by Under the Radar magazine in 2022, he managed to play several sold-out shows across the country and opened for Future Islands on their New Zealand tour all without releasing a single. His debut album Lone Rider was released in 2023 via Danger Collective Records, leading to a tour with Alex Cameron and acclaim from Rolling Stone Australia and Coup de Main.\n\nFOLLOW DC MAXWELL:"
