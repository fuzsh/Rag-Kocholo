Diary Of An Unknown Soldier\n\nI remember the Argonne, 1918.\n\nThe sounds of that battle still haunt me to this day.\n\nMachine gun fire from enemy lines.\n\nThe sickening sound of a bayonet tearing through human flesh.\n\nThe soldier next to me firing his sidearm in desperation.\n\nAll these sounds still echo in my mind,\n\nAnd as conducted by Death himself it all comes together as music.\n\nA rhythm of death\n\nA symphony of war\n\n5. The Lost Battalion\n\nFar from their land as they made their stand\n\nThey stood strong and the legend still lives on\n\n1918\n\nThe great war rages on\n\nA battalion is lost in the Argonne\n\nUnder fire there is nothing they can do\n\nThere's no way they can get a message through\n\nSuffer heavy losses as the battle carries on\n\nLiberty division standing strong\n\nFar from their land as they made their stand\n\nA disregarded demand\n\nIt's surrender or die and the stakes are high\n\nThey live or they die there's no time for goodbye\n\nWeapon in hand as they made their stand\n\nStill disregarding demand\n\nThey would never comply they would rather die\n\nBroke through the blockade they were finally saved\n\nFriendly fire, munitions running low\n\nThe supplies they were dropped upon their foe\n\n1918\n\nThe war still rages on\n\nThe battlalion still trapped in the Argonne\n\nChose not to surrender\n\nThey chose victory or defeat\n\nFallen brothers resting by their feet\n\nFar from their land as they made their stand\n\nA disregarded demand\n\nIt's surrender or die and the stakes are high\n\nThey live and they die there's no time for goodbye\n\nWeapon in hand as they made their stand\n\nStill disregarding demand\n\nThey would never comply they would rather die\n\nBroke through the blockade they were finally saved\n\nFar from their land as they made their stand\n\nA disregarded demand\n\nIt's surrender or die and the stakes are high\n\nLive or die who can tell there's no goodbye\n\nWith a weapon in hand as they made their stand\n\nStill disregarding demand\n\nThey would never comply they would rather die\n\nThey stood strong and the legend still lives on\n\nSuffered heavy losses\n\nThrough the great war they stood strong\n\nBut the memory of the fallen still lives on\n\nFar from their land as they made their stand\n\nA disregarded demand\n\nIt's surrender or die and the stakes are high\n\nThey live and they die there's no time for goodbye\n\nWeapon in hand as they made their stand\n\nStill disregarding demand\n\nThey would never comply they would rather die\n\nBroke through the blockade they were finally saved\n\n6. Rorke's Drift\n\nNews that came that morning told that the main force had been slain\n\nChance for peace and justice gone and all talks had been in vain\n\nA prince had been offended and he has gone the path of war\n\nNow that 1500 men are dead and the Zulu's at the door\n\nZulus attack,\n\nFight back to back\n\nShow them no mercy and\n\nFire at will\n\nKill or be killed\n\nFacing, awaiting\n\nA hostile spear, a new frontier. the end is near\n\nThere's no surrender\n\nThe lines must hold. Their story told, Rorke's drift controlled\n\nLater on that fateful day as they head towards the drift\n\nStacking boxes, fortify, preparations must be swift\n\nSpears and shields of oxen hide facing uniforms and guns\n\nAs the rifles fire, echoes higher, (beating) like the sound of drums\n\n1879, when a few held the line\n\nBack to back, attack, the dead are stacked\n\nWhere a last stand was made, and the empire saved\n\nBack to back, attack, the dead are stacked\n\n7.
