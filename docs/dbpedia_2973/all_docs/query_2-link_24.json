        "text": "hold on\n\nHOLD ON - Frank Solivan & Dirty Kitchen are true masters of progressive bluegrass. They have built a reputation as one of the most exciting bands on the scene, delivering electrifying live performances and drawing new listeners to the genre through their wide-open approach to the music. Perhaps their expansive vision of bluegrass shouldn’t be a surprise. After all, front man and Alaskan Frank Solivan is a bona fide Renaissance man. He has worn a lot of hats in a career that has included tenure in the US Navy band and work as leather craftsman, master cook (who picked up recipes from his Filipino grandfather) and pick maker. He even did a stint blowing up mountains in Alaska.\n\nPowered by Solivan’s bold and dynamic vocals and driven by the band’s virtuosic instrumental chops, the group has earned widespread critical acclaim as well as Grammy nominations for their most recent two albums. They have also received multiple International Bluegrass Music Association awards and nominations, both collectively and individually, including 2 wins for IBMA Instrumental Group of the Year.\n\nFrank and company bring it up a notch on their newest release HOLD ON. Triple-threat Solivan shines as a vocalist and mandolinist and shows his stuff as a songwriter on the album’s 11 tracks, 6 of which were written or co-written by Solivan himself. There’s an overarching theme of optimism that runs through the album and a spirit of hope for better days ahead. Solivan explains: \"I was going through the hardest time of my life leading up to the pandemic. And then the world stopped! Exploring some of the subject matter and song ideas that came out of those difficult times led me to these songs. Songs that helped bring me out of a seemingly hopeless situation. Finding light where there was darkness and trying to relay some of my journey of figuring out how to ‘hold on’. My hope is that the listener will be able to relate and will have these songs to help them get through difficult times.”\n\nTogether with bandmates banjo master Mike Munford, guitarist Chris Luquette and bassist Jeremy Middleton, the band dazzles on covers including Newgrass Revival’s, “Sail to Australia” (featuring NGR’s bassist John Cowan on harmony vocals), Buzz Busby’s “Lost,” and a crafty cover of Orleans’ “Sails,” bringing their instrumental savvy and deep groove to each track. But the real heart of the album is the original material Solivan contributes here, including several outstanding new songs destined to take their place in the bluegrass canon.\n\nThe upbeat “I’m Already Gone” and “Hold On” which open the album are both ready-made bluegrass classics, the later written by Solivan in about 15 minutes right before the recording session. “Goodbye, Goodbye,” co-written by Solivan and his cousin singer/songwriter Megan McCormick, has one of the catchiest choruses you’ll hear in any kind of music, and the achingly beautiful “Modesto,” co-written by Megan McCormick and Amanda Fields, is a gorgeous tip of the hat to the town where Solivan was born. The album also features a re-record of the Solivan-penned instrumental dazzler “Scorchin’ the Gravy,” the first tune the band ever played together. This version, recorded live with no overdubs, leaves little doubt why the quartet is a multiple IBMA Instrumental Award winner.\n\nFrank Solivan & Dirty Kitchen’s reputation as one of the most dazzling bands on the bluegrass scene is even more firmly established with the release of HOLD ON. Old and new fans alike will delight as the band plants another flag in their journey of musical exploration, continuing their seemingly endless upward trajectory, and raising the bar for bluegrass in the process.\n\nAbout\n\nMulti-Grammy nominated Frank Solivan and Dirty Kitchen is a torrent of mind-blowing bluegrass. Known for their meaty pile-driving rhythms and Frank’s dynamic and bold vocals, the band’s last two albums have both received a Grammy nomination for Best Bluegrass Album. They have twice been named IBMA Instrumental Group of the Year and earned numerous other IBMA noms including Male Vocalist of the Year, Mandolin Player of the Year, and in 2013, received Banjo Player of the Year. Their massive sound and show stealing performances command the most prestigious stages in the country and abroad; from The Grand Ole Opry to the biggest international festivals across Europe, South America and Australia. The band has performed at the biggest bluegrass festivals including Telluride, MerleFest, Grey Fox, RockyGrass, Delfest, Strawberry Music Festival, Pickin’ in the Pines, ROMP, and countless more. Frank Solivan and Dirty Kitchen is among the most respected and sought-after bands in the business. FS&DK’s respect and deep understanding of the bluegrass tradition collides, live on stage, with rock-tinged fiery virtuosity that pushes the boundaries of the genre. Other influences include country, jazz, blues, southern rock, and soul.\n\nMore than a performer, Solivan is an award winning songwriter, master cook, outdoorsman, leather craftsman, and entrepreneur, a bonafide Renaissance Man. Frank manufactures his own line of spice mix and hot sauce, handcrafts high end plectrums (picks), leather straps and belts used by the likes of Billy Strings and Trey Hensley, and is an influencer and endorser of national brands such as Traeger Grills, Bonafide Kayaks, D’Addario, Bluechip Picks, and Grace Designs.\n\nIn 2022, Frank started a high end boutique plectrum company with his partner David Welch called, ToneSlabs. They have spent decades performing, searching, tinkering, and experimenting to find a pick that will produce the perfect tone. ToneSlabs is THE premier pick across the plectrum landscape.\n\nThe band’s highly anticipated new album, Hold On was released September 2, 2022 with high expectations as the band’s previous two releases have both been Grammy nominated for Best Bluegrass Album."
