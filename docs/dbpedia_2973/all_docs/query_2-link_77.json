        "text": "As momentous as the 2024 GRAMMYs telecast will be, it will only cover a fraction of the actual GRAMMY nominations.\n\nThe realities of TV broadcasting mean the wider world only gets to see, not the whole iceberg, but merely the tip. This by way of its head-turning, world-shifting General Field Categories including Album Of The Year, Record Of The Year, and Best New Artist.\n\nYes, the General Field Categories boast the most visibility. But while they may be listed at the top of the nominations list, they are never meant to overshadow those beneath — not by a long shot.\n\nThat’s why the Recording Academy puts so much time, intention and care into the Premiere Ceremony, which annually precedes the main GRAMMYs telecast. And by all accounts, the 2024 iteration will be one for the ages.\n\nThe 66th Annual GRAMMY Awards Ceremony & Livestream will air at 12:30 p.m. PT/3:30 p.m. ET on live.GRAMMY.com and the Recording Academy's YouTube channel. City National Bank, the Official Bank of the GRAMMY Awards, is returning for its second year as the presenting sponsor of the Premiere Ceremony.\n\nThe Premiere Ceremony is the most incredible lead-up to Music's Biggest Night,\" Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason jr. said in a statement. \"With an amazing line-up of presenters and performers, we'll reveal and celebrate the winners of more than 80 Categories, spanning the diverse genres and crafts that have contributed to such a spectacular year in music.\"\n\nRead on for a list of four reasons to be thrilled for the Premiere Ceremony — and we’ll see you on the stream!\n\nA Star-Studded Opening Number\n\nThe opening performance at the Premiere Ceremony is always a highlight, and this year promises to be no exception: J. Ivy, Larkin Poe, Pentatonix, Sheila E., and Jordin Sparks.\n\nAt the 2024 GRAMMYs, J. Ivy is nominated for Best Spoken Word Poetry Album, for The Light Inside. Poe is up for Best Contemporary Blues Album, for Blood Harmony. For Holidays Around the World, Pentatonix earned a nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album.\n\nFinally, for her feature on for KING & COUNTRY’s “Love Me Like I Am,” Sparks is up for Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song. (E., though being a four-time GRAMMY nominee, is not nominated at the 2024 GRAMMYs.)\n\nStellar Performers All Around\n\nThe rest of the 2024 GRAMMYs Premiere Ceremony will feature brilliant performers. These musicians will showcase the wide range of genres the Academy celebrates on GRAMMY night, as well as the diverse creators in the Academy and the music industry at large.\n\nThese include current nominees Adam Blackstone, Brandy Clark, Kirk Franklin, Robert Glasper, Bob James, Laufey, Terrace Martin, and Gaby Moreno and David Aguilar, as well as GRAMMY-nominated recording artist/drummer Harvey Mason Sr.\n\nThe Music’s In Great Hands\n\nThe music producer and music director of the 2024 GRAMMYs Premiere Ceremony will be Cheche Alara, a GRAMMY-and Latin GRAMMY-winning music master who has worked on titanic albums by Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera, Natalia Lafourcade, and many more.\n\nWith Alara at the helm, the Premiere Ceremony won’t just celebrate music — it’ll be a bastion of outstanding music itself.\n\nYou Get The Complete GRAMMYs Experience\n\nDon’t think of the Premiere Ceremony as the mere ramp-up to the 2024 GRAMMYs; think of them as two pieces of one GRAMMYs experience.\n\nBy carefully watching the Premiere Ceremony as well as the main telecast, you get the entire sense of where music is headed, through the lens of the world’s leading society of music people.\n\nSo tune into both the 2024 GRAMMYs Premiere Ceremony and the 2024 GRAMMYs themselves — if you love this universal artform, and wish to elevate it, join us on Feb. 4 for Music’s Biggest Night!\n\nHow To Watch The 2024 GRAMMYs Live: GRAMMY Nominations, Performers, Air Date, Red Carpet, Streaming Channel & More\n\nAustin is nominated for Best Jazz Vocal Album (For Ella 2 Featuring Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band); Blackstone is nominated for Best Jazz Performance (\"Vulnerable (Live)\" Featuring The Baylor Project & Russell Ferranté) and Best Jazz Instrumental Album (Legacy: The Instrumental Jawn).\n\nMeanwhile, Clark is nominated for Best Musical Theater Album (Shucked), Best Country Solo Performance (\"Buried\"), Best Country Song (\"Buried\"), Best Americana Performance (\"Dear Insecurity\" Featuring Brandi Carlile), Best American Roots Song (\"Dear Insecurity\" Featuring Brandi Carlile), and Best Americana Album (Brandy Clark).\n\nFranklin is nominated for Best Gospel Performance/Song (\"All Things\"); Glasper is nominated for Best R&B Performance (\"Back To Love\" Featuring SiR & Alex Isley) and Best R&B Song (\"Back To Love\" Featuring SiR & Alex Isley).\n\nJames is nominated for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album (Jazz Hands); J.

Lamar specifically praised Top Dawg's CEO, Anthony Tiffith, for finding and developing raw talent that might not otherwise get the chance to pursue their musical dreams.\n\n\"We'd never forget that: Taking these kids out of the projects, out of Compton, and putting them right here on this stage, to be the best that they can be,\" Lamar — a Compton native himself — continued, leading into an impassioned conclusion spotlighting some of the cornerstone rap albums that came before To Pimp a Butterfly.\n\n\"Hip-hop. Ice Cube. This is for hip-hop,\" he said. \"This is for Snoop Dogg, Doggystyle. This is for Illmatic, this is for Nas. We will live forever. Believe that.\"\n\nTo Pimp a Butterfly singles \"Alright\" and \"These Walls\" earned Lamar three more GRAMMYs that night, the former winning Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song and the latter taking Best Rap/Sung Collaboration (the song features Bilal, Anna Wise and Thundercat). He also won Best Music Video for the remix of Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood.\"\n\nLamar has since won Best Rap Album two more times, taking home the golden gramophone in 2018 for his blockbuster LP DAMN., and in 2023 for his bold fifth album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers.\n\nWatch Lamar's full acceptance speech above, and check back at GRAMMY.com every Friday for more GRAMMY Rewind episodes.\n\n10 Essential Facts To Know About GRAMMY-Winning Rapper J. Cole\n\nBrandi Carlile's soaring performance of her song \"The Joke\" at the 2019 GRAMMY Awards didn't necessarily make her a superstar, but it showed the world that she is one. And judging by her own reaction, she knew it, too: Carlile ended the performance with a flourish, throwing her head back to drive the final notes even higher, grinning and jumping up and down as she finished.\n\nAlready, she had six albums and plenty of critical acclaim to her name, but that night Carlile won her first GRAMMYs — three, to be exact — including two for \"The Joke.\" Since then, she's added three more golden gramophones to her collection, and now boasts a total of 24 nominations — including seven at the 2023 GRAMMYs.\n\nHer 2021 album, In These Silent Days, is nominated for Album Of The Year and Best Americana Album; \"You and Me on the Rock\" is up for Record Of The Year, Best Americana Performance and Best American Roots Song; and \"Broken Horses\" earned nods for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance — Carlile's first in the Rock Field. (The album's lead single, \"Right on Time,\" also earned her three GRAMMY nominations in 2022: Record Of The Year, Song Of The Year and Best Pop Solo Performance, the latter of which was another first for Carlile.)\n\nOver her nearly 20-year career, Carlile has built a diverse fan base. Although she considers Americana to be her \"home base,\" Carlile's music often doesn't fit neatly into any one genre, which is abundantly clear in her wide array of nominations for In These Silent Days. In fact, since her first GRAMMY nomination in 2016, Carlile has been nominated across six different Fields: American Roots Music, Country, General Field, Rock, Pop, and Music for Visual Media.\n\nWhile Carlile's genre-bending prowess is essential to her musical vision, it's her powerful voice and range that captivates listeners. Beyond those, Carlile's canny ability to convey universally-relatable sentiments through songs, often based on her own experiences, solidified her standing as one of the most beloved stars in Americana and beyond.\n\nFrom the get-go, Carlile established her broad appeal with her debut self-titled album in 2005, laying the foundation for her breakout album, The Story, released in 2007. The title track, a lilting love song — which spoke to millions with honest, relatable lyrics about how our personal histories make us who we are today — remains her biggest hit to date. (Though she didn't write it herself, the track was penned by Phil Hanseroth, one half of the Hanseroth twins, with whom Carlile has performed and written for most of her career.)\n\nAfter The Story's resounding success, the singer continued honing her voice and performance on her 2009 and 2012 LPs, Give Up The Ghost and Bear Creek. Then in 2015, Carlile foreshadowed the precision and strength of 2018's By The Way, I Forgive You, with The Firewatchers's Daughter — which earned her her first GRAMMY nomination, for Best Americana Album. The album shifts from the powerful and personal \"Wherever is Your Heart,\" to the rowdy, cathartic jam \"Mainstream Kid\" and the haunting \"The Stranger at My Door,\" whose central character lends the album its name.\n\nWith By the Way I Forgive You, Carlile sharpened her songwriting chops, zeroing in on the same blend of candor and levity that makes her live performances so riveting. \"The Joke,\" a profound love letter to kids who don't fit in, is arguably one of the strongest displays of Carlile's ability to distill emotion into lyrics. But \"The Mother\" is the album's lyrical standout, wherein Carlile neatly packages her profound and funny experience of becoming a mother.\n\nThe slow burn of Carlile's career served her well, allowing her to perfect her writing and performance without the pressures of instant success. Reaching superstar status in her late 30s enabled her to realize its full potential, Carlile, who's now 41, says.\n\n\"You only have so many shots anymore,\" she told NPR last year. \"And if you're not ready for that — like, musically ready, emotionally ready, physically ready and just mentally ready to, like, seize that moment, really take the bull by the horns, and go, 'This is my shot, I'm going to do this' — I don't think you can do that in your 20s on purpose.\"\n\nIn addition to scoring her most GRAMMY nominations in one year, Carlile had several other superstar moments in 2022. She was the cover star of Billboard's Pride Month issue in June; in July, she surprised the world by bringing Joni Mitchell on stage with her at the Newport Folk Festival (Mitchell's first full performance in 20 years), and became the first woman to headline Tennessee's Pilgrimage Music & Cultural Festival in September.\n\nCarlile closed out the year with a return to \"Saturday Night Live,\" her second appearance on the late-night sketch show in the last 14 months. Neatly linking her early breakout with her current hit, she performed \"The Story\" and \"You and Me on the Rock\" back to back.\n\nAs her most recent \"SNL\" performance hinted, Carlile delicately balances her roots with her present success. Wherever Carlile's star power takes her next, she's poised and ready for a bright and captivating future.\n\nMeet The First-Time GRAMMY Nominee: How Carly Pearce's Darkest Personal Moments Helped Her Reach Milestones"
