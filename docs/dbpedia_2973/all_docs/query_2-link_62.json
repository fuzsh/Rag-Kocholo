        "text": "MODO-LIVE, I am the Eggplant, Programme Presents\n\nCrumb\n\nw/ L’Rain, Discovery Zone\n\nNew York psych-pop band Crumb return with AMAMA, their most carefree and open-hearted album to date. A soundscape full of playful and patchwork experimentation — glitchy pitch-shifted vocals, cell phone recordings, nautical blips, sax mouthpiece solos, blasted drum samples, and piano strings dampened with Silly Putty — AMAMA continues to deepen the band’s hypnotic sound in a cohesive line back through 2021’s Ice Melt, 2019’s Jinx, and breakout EPs Locket and Crumb. Without a doubt, AMAMA is Crumb — singer and multi-instrumentalist Lila Ramani, keyboardist and saxophonist Bri Aronow, bassist Jesse Brotter, and drummer Jonathan Gilad — at their most animated.\n\nBuoyed by Ramani’s songwriting, at turns poetically abstract and directly confessional, AMAMA culls the strange encounters from Crumb’s touring years, tracing the dizzying path of a group that’s been in movement for nearly a decade. “Crushxd” is an ecstatic requiem for a turtle flattened under the tires of a tour van; “(Alone in) Brussels” finds Ramani in forced isolation in a distant city. On “The Bug,” we’re at a pit stop in a seedy motel, where a critter’s bite leaves a nagging feeling: “It’s always on my mind / it’s just always on my mind,” Ramani repeats over a creeping groove as she wanders the place at night. On “Side by Side,” perhaps the most candid track on AMAMA, frenetic percussion and disorienting, layered synth envelop Ramani as she considers the personal sacrifices she’s made along the way.\n\nEven as it explores transient stops and fraught encounters, AMAMA features some of Crumb’s most vulnerable, tender searches for organic connection. “Home is what I want and what I need,” Ramani sings on the clear-sighted opener, “From Outside a Window Sill”—which samples a police radio scan about a flock of geese crossing a bridge in Gowanus, Brooklyn, where Ramani grew up. The title track, “AMAMA,” is an upbeat and hopeful homage to Ramani’s grandmother, her namesake, who sings in Malayalam in the opening sample. The two voices, Lila’s and Leela’s, separated by language and place, intertwine as if on a spotty long-distance call in what is the most direct love song of Crumb’s repertoire. On the album’s closer, “XXX,” laden with distorted, industrial sounds, we finally find respite—a house shared between two lovers, a safe place. In the last moments, Ramani asks: “Isn’t this as good as it can get?”\n\nAMAMA exists at the crossroads of psychedelia, pop, jazz, and rock, and cements Crumb as a band uniquely their own. Released independently on Crumb Records and produced alongside Johnscott Sanford and Jonathan Rado in Los Angeles, AMAMA is an incandescent statement about searching for solid ground, connection, and clarity in a life of nomadic upheaval.\n\nAugust 31 2024\n\n19+\n\nDoors at 7:00PM\n\nTickets\n\nInertia Entertainment Presents\n\nThe Lox\n\n30th Anniversary Tour\n\nThe Lox, an iconic rap group hailing from Yonkers, New York, emerged in the early ‘90s, carving a distinctive niche within the hip-hop scene with their gritty lyrical content and authentic street narratives. Comprising Jadakiss, Styles P, and Sheek Louch, the trio initially gained prominence under the mentorship of Mary J. Blige, which led to their signing with Bad Boy Records. Their debut album, Money, Power & Respect (1998), was a commercial success, bolstered by the hit title track, and solidified their presence in the rap industry.\n\nDespite their initial success, The Lox became disillusioned with the glossy image imposed by Bad Boy and made a high-profile switch to Ruff Ryders Entertainment. This move marked a turning point, allowing them to express their raw and unfiltered street ethos more freely. Their sophomore album, We Are the Streets (2000), reflected this shift, earning critical acclaim for its hard-hitting lyrics and rugged beats.\n\nBeyond their group projects, Jadakiss, Styles P, and Sheek Louch have each enjoyed successful solo careers, releasing numerous albums that have been well received by fans and critics alike. However, their chemistry as The Lox remains unparalleled, leading to further collaborative projects, including, Filthy America… It’s Beautiful (2016), and, Living Off Xperience (2020), which showcased their evolution while staying true to their roots.\n\nRenowned for their lyrical prowess, cohesive group dynamic, and contributions to the evolution of hardcore rap, The Lox have solidified their legacy as stalwarts of hip-hop, respected by peers and revered by fans across generations.\n\nSeptember 6 2024\n\n19+\n\nDoors at 8:00PM\n\nTickets\n\nCollective Concerts Presents\n\nBôa Sold Out!\n\nw/ Rocket\n\nBritish alt-rock band bôa have reformed following an incredible renaissance for their track, Duvet, driven by TikTok fans the world over. Originally released in 1998, and placed as the soundtrack to cult-classic anime series, Serial Experiments Lain, Duvet, became a viral hit on social media towards the end of 2021 – sparking an ongoing, enormous interest in the group that lead to millions of streams across their entire catalogue. Now signed to Nettwerk Music Group, the song has continued to trend throughout 2022 and even entered an incredible third resurgence in May 2023.\n\nFollowing the initial viral trend that saw, Duvet, streaming into the millions, bôa have reconnected as a band and with fans to continue to build on that initial moment. Garnering well over 100 Million streams over the last year, and over 200,000 fans across social media, the growth of the band still continues.\n\nFronted by Jasmine Rodgers, daughter of Paul Rodgers (Free, Bad Company), with Alex Caird on bass and Lee Sullivan on drums, bôa had mostly dispersed over the last few years with members following solo careers. Inspired by the growing interest in their past releases, they have garnered an exceptionally invested new fanbase – clamoring for more from bôa.\n\nbôa have returned to the studio in 2023 to record new original music, with new releases anticipated later this year.\n\nSupporting act, Rocket, is an emerging musical group that has quickly captured the hearts of fans across the globe. Known for their electrifying performances and unique sound, Rocket blends elements of rock, indie, and electronic music to create an unforgettable auditory experience. Formed in 2020, the band consists of four members: Alex on vocals and guitar, Jamie on keyboards, Morgan on bass, and Casey on drums. Each member brings a distinct musical background, contributing to the band’s diverse soundscapes and lyrical depth. Rocket’s debut EP, Launch Sequence, received critical acclaim for its innovative production and emotional resonance, establishing the band as a rising star in the music industry.\n\nSeptember 23 2024\n\nAll Ages\n\nDoors at 7:00PM\n\nCollective Concerts Presents\n\nStars Sold Out!\n\nSet Yourself on Fire 20th Anniversary Tour\n\nw/ Gentleman Reg\n\nIn celebration of a pivotal milestone, the acclaimed Canadian indie pop band Stars embarks on the “Set Yourself on Fire 20th Anniversary Tour.” This tour commemorates two decades since the release of their transformative album, Set Yourself on Fire, an opus that captured the hearts of fans and critics alike in 2004.

Along the way, they’ve ticked off milestones ranging from a Number Two chart placing and Mercury Prize nomination for debut album, The Overload, to a co-sign from Elton John who joined the band to guest on a string-laden reworking of album closer ‘100% Endurance’.\n\nYet, whilst the band’s trajectory continuously shot upwards, vocalist James Smith and his wife had also welcomed in a son. And it’s this duelling sense of responsibility and ambition, guilt, love, drive and everything in between that forms the narrative backbone of brilliantly exploratory second album, Where’s My Utopia?\n\nWritten in snapshots of time between a relentless touring schedule, and produced jointly by the band and Gorillaz’ Remi Kabaka Jr, the quartet’s second act is a giant leap forward into broad and playful new sonic waters. “The main reason that ‘post-punk’ was the vehicle for Album One was because it was really affordable to do, but we always liked so much other music and this time we’ve had the confidence to embrace it,” James explains. Across the record, influences ranging from Fela Kuti to Ennio Moricone via Spiller’s ‘00s pop smash ‘Groovejet’ make themselves known.\n\nIt’s a celebratory palette upon which Smith allowed himself to reach lyrically deeper into himself than ever. Gone, largely, are the outward-facing character studies of yore, replaced with a set of songs that stare fully into the headlights of life, wrangling with the frontman’s own fears and foibles to create a sort of Promethean narrative - but with jokes. “You can commit to the idea that we’re just animals who eat and fuck and then we die, and that’s fine,” he suggests. “But for me, creativity always seems to be the best way of articulating the absolute minefield of what human existence is.”\n\nOctober 7 2024\n\n19+\n\nDoors at 7:00PM\n\n$42.89\n\nTickets\n\nCollective Concerts Presents\n\nJD McPherson\n\nNight Owls Tour 2024\n\nw/ Kate Clover\n\nOver the past 12 years, JD McPherson has carved out a unique musical path, releasing four studio albums and two EPs that blend foundational rock ‘n’ roll, rockabilly, and R&B with his distinct songwriting style. Hailing from Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, JD is deeply inspired by classic sounds yet approaches his music with a fresh, innovative twist. “I love those old styles, but I don’t treat my music like a museum piece. It’s more about mixing those rhythms and sounds and seeing what comes out,” he says.\n\nThis creative philosophy shines through in his latest album, Nite Owls. His fifth studio release features ten dynamic rock ‘n’ roll tracks that incorporate elements of glam, new wave, post-punk, and surf rock. JD connects these diverse influences seamlessly, noting, “The thread between Duane Eddy and Depeche Mode is that reverb-y guitar style. It felt natural to blend that with the classic stuff and a dash of surf.”\n\nNite Owls opens with “Sunshine Getaway,” a catchy glam rock track with a darker lyrical undercurrent. Collaborating with Jack and Page from the Cactus Blossoms, the song reflects on harsh winters and dreams of sunnier days. The album continues to showcase JD’s versatility with tracks like the r&b rave-up “I Can’t Go Anywhere With You” and the melancholic dream-pop of “Just Like Summer.”\n\nJD’s storytelling prowess is evident in the title track’s vivid narratives and the Beach Boys-esque harmonies of “That’s What a Love Song Does to You.” He also collaborates with Ryan Lindsay of Broncho on “Shining Like Gold,” a breezy love song. Longtime fans will appreciate familiar elements in songs like “The Rock and Roll Girls” and “Baby Blues.”\n\nThroughout Nite Owls, JD’s enthusiasm and passion for music are palpable. Reflecting on his journey, he shares, “I’m just trying to share an infectious enthusiasm. I want to enjoy myself and make the music I love, and I’m so grateful I get to do this for a living.”\n\nOctober 8 2024\n\n19+\n\nDoors at 7:00PM\n\n$49.73\n\nTickets\n\nCollective Concerts Presents\n\nMdou Moctar\n\nFuneral for Justice Tour\n\nFuneral For Justice, is the new album by Mdou Moctar. Recorded at the close of two years spent touring the globe following the release of 2019 breakout, Afrique Victime, it captures the Nigerien quartet in ferocious form. The music is louder, faster, and more wild. The guitar solos are feedback-scorched and the lyrics are passionately political. Nothing is held back or toned down.\n\nThe songs on Funeral For Justice speak unflinchingly to the plight of Niger and of the Tuareg people. “This album is really different for me,” explains Moctar, the band’s singer, namesake, and indisputably iconic guitarist. “Now the problems of terrorist violence are more serious in Africa. When the US and Europe came here, they said they’re going to help us, but what we see is really different. They never help us to find a solution.”\n\n“Mdou Moctar has been a strong anti-colonial band ever since I’ve been a part of it,” says producer and bassist Mikey Coltun, who has been playing with Moctar since 2017. “France came in, fucked up the country, then said ‘you’re free.’ And they’re not.” The song ‘Oh France’ tackles this head on: “France’s actions are frequently veiled in cruelty/We are better off without its turbulent relation/It’s high time we grasp the endless lethal games it plays.”\n\nOn the lead single and title track, Moctar addresses African leaders directly, bidding them: “Retake control of your resource rich countries/Build them and quit sleeping”. The song ‘Sousoume Tamacheq’ deals with the plight of the Tuareg people to which the band belong, and who are mainly spread across three countries: Niger, Mali and Algeria. “Oppressed in all three/In addition to lack of unity, ignorance is the third issue.” Another song, ‘Imouhar’, calls on the Tuareg to preserve their Tamasheq language - it’s at risk of dying out, and Mdou is one of the few in his community who knows how to write it. “People here are just using French,” laments Mdou. “They’re starting to forget their own language. We feel like in a hundred years no one will speak good Tamasheq, and that’s so scary for us.”\n\nMdou Moctar in its current iteration is first and foremost a band. Alongside Moctar, it consists of rhythm guitarist Ahmoudou Madassane, drummer Souleymane Ibrahim, and American bassist and producer Mikey Coltun.\n\nThe band got their start performing at traditional weddings. These are high energy events – amps are dialed up to 11 and the whole town is invited to attend. “I grew up in the DC punk scene and this is no different,” explains Coltun. “It’s a DIY punk show: people bring generators, they crank their amps. Things are broken, but they make it work.”\n\nConveying that energy and feeling of community to a new audience has been an important goal for the band. Their first concerts in the US were sometimes, mistakenly, organized to be tame seated affairs. That’s no longer the case. Over 100s of shows, they’ve proven themselves as one of the world’s most vital rock bands – a group rooted in Tuareg tradition, but undeniably its own singular organism. An Mdou Moctar concert is now recognized to be a place for dancing, if not full-force moshing.\n\n“Ilana was the gateway album, saying that this is a raw rock band. And Afrique Victime was a summation of that vision,” says Coltun, who captured the bulk of the recordings over five days in a mostly unfurnished house in upstate New York. “With Funeral For Justice, I really wanted this to shine with the political message because of everything that’s going on. As the band got tighter and heavier live, it made sense to capture this urgency and this aggression – it wasn’t a forced thing, it was very natural.”\n\nIn July 2023 – after Funeral For Justice had been completed – Niger’s democratically elected government was deposed in a military coup. The president was placed under house arrest and the nation plunged into a state of chaos and uncertainty. The French have withdrawn. The area continues to be threatened by terrorism. The band – then on tour in the US – was, for a time, unable to return to their families.\n\n“I don’t support the coup,” explains Mdou, “but I never in my life liked France in my country. I don’t hate France or French people, I don’t hate American people either, but I don’t support their manipulative policies, what they do in Africa. In 2023 we want to be free, we need to smile, you understand?”\n\nOctober 9 2024\n\n19+\n\nDoors at 7:00PM\n\n$42.24\n\nTickets\n\nCollective Concerts Presents\n\nGinger Root\n\nGinger Root’s SHINBANGUMI Tour\n\nA multi-instrumentalist, producer, songwriter, and visual artist from Southern California, Cameron Lew has crafted his Ginger Root project steadily since 2017, inviting a fervent and growing legion of fans into storylines drawn across mediums: captivating albums with accompanying films and globe-spanning tours. The Ginger Root sound — handmade yet immaculately polished synth-pop, alt-disco, boogie, and soul — takes shape through Lew’s lens as an Asian-American growing up enamored by 1970s and ‘80s music, specifically the creative and cultural dialogue between Japanese City Pop and its Western counterparts from French Pop to Philly Soul to Ram-era McCartney. SHINBANGUMI, his long-awaited third LP, and Ghostly International debut set for physical release in 2024 with a visual album component, translates roughly to a new season of a show. It finds Lew more poised, idiosyncratic, and intentional than ever in a new chapter of life, unlocking “exactly what Ginger Root should sound and feel like,” he says. “In terms of instrumentation and musicality, it’s the first time that I felt very confident and comfortable with what everything should be comprised of. On the more personal side, I’m coming out of the last four years of writing, touring, and living as a different person; SHINBANGUMI is a platform to showcase my new self.”\n\nSince his first release of “aggressive elevator soul” music and dispatch from his beloved weekly YouTube cover series during college, Lew has captained the ship of Ginger Root, able to write, record, and mix the music while creating the art and videos from scratch. What makes Ginger Root special is the project’s ability to weave influence beyond pastiche into a bigger picture, exploring that rarified pop pleasure center where referential meets refreshing.\n\nIn 2018, the project delivered its first album in collaboration with Acrophase Record, Mahjong Room, followed by several projects including the 2020 LP, Rikki. Between each move, Ginger Root has played alongside many modern Indie standouts, such as Khruangbin, Durand Jones, Omar Apollo, The Marias, and Hippo Campus.\n\nWith much of Rikki’s release feeling lost to the moments of that year, Lew decided to take a step back and try to write a succinct project to engage listeners for as long as possible. His redirected energy, paired with the newfound influence of Japanese art and culture from his experience learning to speak the language, yielded City Slicker in 2021. On the strength of breakout songs like “Juban District” and “Loretta,” the project connected with a massive audience on the internet, with his YouTube amassing 160,000 subscribers and his Spotify nearly hitting 1 million monthly listeners.\n\nGinger Root released the Nisemono EP in 2022 and has since played sold-out shows across North America, Europe, and Asia as fans await new music. In 2024, Ginger Root presents SHINBANGUMI across a sequential music video series, resuming the conceptual narrative from his 2022 EP Nisemono, which follows Ginger Root as a newly-fired music supervisor in 1987 starting his own media conglomerate, Ginger Root Productions. “If you watch music videos one through eight, you’ll be presented with a story that’s comparable to a traditional movie; something I’ve always wanted to do.”\n\nOctober 12 2024\n\n19+\n\nDoors at 7:00PM\n\n$48.68\n\nTickets\n\nCollective Concerts Presents\n\nThe Dip\n\nLove Direction Tour\n\nw/ Jordan Мackampa\n\nThe Dip is an exuberant, multi-genre band from Seattle, Washington, that has been captivating audiences with their unique blend of soul, funk, and modern pop music.
