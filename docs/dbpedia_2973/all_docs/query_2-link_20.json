After spending much of his young life engaging in mostly non-violent criminal activity, Matt has dedicated the rest of his days toward the pursuit of peace and harmony. He wrote the novel Overlook: A Story About Drugs, Disappointment, and the American Dream. He was also supposed to be on a local TV news show once, but they scrapped the segment. Matt seems to think it had something to do with the fact that he showed up incredibly stoned and didn’t really answer any of their questions in a coherent and satisfying manner. He is a stern, yet loving father and a sexually dedicated husband who ultimately places God above all things.\n\n**RATED R**\n\n****21 and Over****\n\n**Premium Seating is guaranteed in the 1st 6 rows**\n\n**All MEMBERS OF THE SAME PARTY MUST BE PRESENT TO BE SEATED TOGETHER**\n\nSEATING WILL BEGIN 45 MINUTES PRIOR TO SHOWTIME\n\nLiz Miele is a NYC comedian that has appeared on Comedy Central, FOX, AXS TV, Hulu and NPR’s Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me.
