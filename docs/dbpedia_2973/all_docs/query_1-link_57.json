Randomly selected 1 of 3 collectable print\n\nLast Stand was Cold Chisel's final tour before their breakup in 1983.\n\nThe tour consisted of 28 dates and culminated in a four-night extravaganza at the Sydney Entertainment Centre. Two nights of the Sydney shows were recorded and later released as a live album and documentary film, capturing the band's electrifying performance without any unnecessary fluff.\n\nLast Stand holds a special place in Cold Chisel's legacy, celebrated by fans and critics alike for its production values and killer sound. The recordings from the tour are now available in the Last Stand - 40th Anniversary Box Set, which includes additional tracks never released before on CD or vinyl, as well as photos, posters, and a laminate.\n\nWhether a long-time fan or a newcomer to their music, the Last Stand - 40th Anniversary Box Set is a must-have for anyone who appreciates the impact Cold Chisel has made on Australian music.\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nLast Stand (2LP)\n\nSIDE A\n\n1.
