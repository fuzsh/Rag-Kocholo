        "text": "HUGH JACKMAN is an Academy Award-nominated, Golden Globe- and Tony Award-winning performer who has made an impression on audiences of all ages with his multi-hyphenate career persona, as successful on stage in front of live crowds as he is on film. From his award-winning turn on Broadway as the 1970s singer/songwriter Peter Allen, to his metal claw-wielding Wolverine in the blockbuster âX-Menâ franchise, Jackman has proven to be one of the most versatile actors of our time.\n\nThe Australian native made his first major U.S. film appearance as Wolverine in the first installment of the âX-Menâ series, a role he reprised in the enormously successful âX2â and âX-Men: The Last Stand.â He then starred as the title character in âX-Men Origins: Wolverine,â a prequel to the popular series which grossed an outstanding $85 million domestically in its first weekend of release. Audiences once again went to see Jackman in the popular role in the next chapter titled âThe Wolverine,â which grossed over $400 million worldwide. In 2014, Jackman and the X-Men team reunited for âX-Men: Days of Future Past.â\n\nJackman garnered his first Academy Award nomination, for Best Actor, for his performance in Tom Hooperâs âLes MisÃ©rables,â based on popular stage show created from Victorâs Hugo famous novel of the same name.

In addition, he lent his voice to the animated features âHappy Feet,â âFlushed Awayâ and âRise of the Guardians.â\n\nOn Broadway, Jackman most recently received rave reviews for his performance as The Man in the âThe River.â In 2011, he made a splash on the Great White Way in his one-man show, âHugh Jackman â Back on Broadway.â Backed by an 18-piece orchestra, the revue, which previously opened to rave reviews during its limited engagements in San Francisco and Toronto earlier that year, was comprised of both Broadway hits and a selection of some of his personal favorite standards. Jackmanâs continued dedication to the Broadway community was fÃªted at the 2012 Tony Awards, where he received a Special Award from the Tony Awards Administration Committee, recognizing his accomplishments both as a performer as well as a humanitarian.\n\nIn 2009, Broadway audiences could see Jackman in the Keith Huff-penned âA Steady Rain,â in which he starred with Daniel Craig. For his portrayal of the 1970s singer/songwriter Peter Allen in âThe Boy From Oz,â Jackman received the 2004 Tony Award for Best Actor in a musical as well as Drama Desk, Drama League, Outer Critics Circle and Theatre World awards.\n\nHis additional theater credits include âCarouselâ at Carnegie Hall; âOklahoma!â at the National Theater in London, for which he received an Olivier Award nomination; âSunset Boulevard,â for which he garnered Australiaâs prestigious âMOâ Award; and âBeauty and the Beast,â for which he received a âMOâ Award nomination.\n\nJackmanâs career began in Australia in the independent films âPaperback Heroâ and âErskineville Kings.â His performance in the latter earned him an Australian Film Criticsâ Circle Best Actor award and The Australian Film Institute Best Actor nomination.

The series debuted in October 2015 and delivered CNBCâs most-watched first season in network history. New episodes of âJay Lenoâs Garageâ return Wednesday, November 9th at 10PM ET/PT on CNBC.\n\nThe show is an outgrowth of jaylenosgarage.com, which Leno produces and which has an international following on the Web and which has garnered several Emmy Awards and nominations for Outstanding Special ClassâShort-Format Nonfiction Programs.\n\nLeno has been honored by the Television Academy with an Emmy for âOutstanding Comedy, Variety or Music Series.â âThe Tonight Showâ has also taken home the trophy for âFavorite Late Night Showâ in the annual TV Guide Awards determined by voting viewers. Leno is also the recipient of the Peopleâs Choice Award and other honors, including the Harris Poll selection as most popular star on television. Other personal highlights include the Hasty Pudding Award at Harvard University, an honor whose sole prior comedy/talk host recipient was Johnny Carson; receiving a star on Hollywoodâs Walk of Fame, and being the first person to drive the pace car of all major NASCAR events.\n\nIt was in May 1992 when Leno followed in the footsteps of legendary NBC late-night hosts Steve Allen, Jack Paar and Johnny Carson as âTonight Showâ host. Pitted against another television superstar David Letterman in the ll:35 p.m. hour, Leno became the ratings leader of late night within two years and never looked back.\n\nPrior to becoming host, Leno had been the exclusive guest host on âThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carsonâ since September 1987. He first appeared as a guest on the show March 2, 1977, and he made numerous additional appearances on the show, as well as NBCâs former program âLate Night with David Letterman.â\n\nAn indefatigable performer, Leno loves to test his humor live on audiences across the nation, performing over 100-150 live appearances in nightclubs, theaters and stadiums each year. He has been touted as one of the nicest people in show business and the hardest-working -- a winning tandem for the man who says, âAnyone can have a life - careers are hard to come by!â\n\nHis âeverymanâ-style and personality have helped him earn millions of fans worldwide, especially in the regions where people relate to his personable style and work ethic. In addition to traversing the U.S., he has entertained in various countries, including performing for military troops associated with the wars in Afghanistan and Bosnia. He remains passionate about performing in front of live audiences, including the military, and appears regularly in Las Vegas, on college campuses around the United States and in other venues.\n\nMoreover, he is committed to using his amalgam of talents to help those less fortunate. Each year, he serves as Master of Ceremonies and does numerous benefit performances, including shows for those whose lives were devastated by the 9/11 tragedy, the tsunami in Thailand, hurricanes in the gulf, and the severe economic downturn in Detroit. He leads the annual Love Ride in California to benefit numerous humanitarian organizations serving people with autism, muscular dystrophy, and Special Olympics, among many others.\n\nHe has also served as honorary campaign chairman for several years for the Entertainment Industry Foundation, Hollywoodâs charitable arm, and he has assisted the Gender Apartheid campaign led by wife Mavis together with the Feminist Majority, to free Afghan women of Taliban tyranny, an effort for which Mavis and The Feminist Majority were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nLenoâs childrenâs book âIf Roast Beef Could Flyâ (from Simon & Schuster) hit bookstores in April 2004 and immediately was a New York Times Bestseller. His follow-up kids book âHow to be the Funniest Kid In Your Classâ was similarly successful. His other book, âLeading with My Chinâ (from HarperCollins), hit the bookstores in 1998. He also has published four versions of âHeadlines,â the compilation of books and desk calendars featuring his favorite funny newspaper headlines, and âPolice Blotter,â a book with more humorous newspaper clips involving police stories (book proceeds go to various charities).\n\nWhen he is not performing, writing, doing charitable work, Leno keeps busy doing voice-over work in such movies as âCarsâ and âIgorâ and the hit-TV show âThe Fairly Oddparentsâ (Nickelodeon), where the character âThe Crimson Chinâ â a superhero with a chin with superpowers â was inspired by Lenoâs own noted jawline. He also is a much-in-demand corporate speaker for companies including General Motors, and he is a monthly columnist in âPopular Mechanics.â And in his âspareâ time (as if he has any), he enjoys working on his collection of classic cars and motorcycles. In fact, he has built a number of cars, including an acclaimed eco-car in his eco-friendly green garage.\n\nLeno was born in New Rochelle, New York, and raised in Andover, Massachusetts. He and his wife, Mavis, live in Los Angeles.\n\nThree-time Grammy Award winner AngÃ©lique Kidjo is one of the greatest artists in international music today; a creative force with thirteen albums to her name.
