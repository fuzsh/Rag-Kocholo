Last Stand in Open Country is a lost gem, the kind of music you want to hear as the sun sets, stoke a fire and keep good company with friends and dogs (very much in the vein of Tumbleweed Connection-era Elton John). The band is comprised of Bernie Taupin on vocals, Jim Cregan on guitars and vocals (Family, Rod Stewart to name just two of his affiliations), Robin Le Mesurier on guitars and dobro (also Rod Stewart), Dennis Tufano on harp and vocals (The Buckinghams) and Tony Brock on drums.\n\nExclusive double vinyl produced by Warner Records in celebration of Record Store Day 2024. Only 3500 copies worldwide.\n\nTRACKLISTING:"
