        "text": "Welcome to your Lied Center’s 31st season! From Tony Award-winning best musicals to Grammy-winning legends, we hope you find our 2024–25 offerings to be exciting and relevant.\n\nAs I reflect upon the last ten years, I always come back to one word—community. We are so grateful to the entire community, and especially our Friends of the Lied, for supporting our organization for over three decades. It is truly an honor for the Lied Center to play a role in the lives of tens of thousands every season.\n\nWe are always seeking different ways to best serve our community and thank all of you for joining us on this journey. Whether you have kids or grandkids who enjoy our free school performances, attend a naturalization ceremony, or celebrate a KU graduate at one of our many commencement events, we appreciate your efforts in helping us to create a stronger sense of community.\n\nThank you for taking the time to explore your Lied Center’s 2024–25 season, and we will see you soon!\n\nROCK CHALK!\n\n—Derek S. Kwan, executive director"
