If you’re looking for never-been-heard before facts and stories about the album, as well as some pretty silly jokes, this is where you’ll find them!

Find out about this and more by joining today!\"\n\nCheck out the listening party below or go to this location.\n\nThe Last Stand is Sabaton's eighth studio album. It was produced by Peter Tägtgren at Abyss Studios in Sweden and released on August 19, 2016. Like Sabaton's previous album, Heroes, The Last Stand is a concept album and takes inspiration from \"last stand\" military battles."
