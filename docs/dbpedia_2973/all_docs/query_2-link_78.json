        "text": "Summerfest Announces First 2024 Headliner Tyler Childers on Friday, June 28\n\nPosted: Sep 19, 2023\n\nTICKETS ON-SALE THIS FRIDAY\n\nGLOBAL “MULE PULL ’24 TOUR” SELLS OUT IMMEDIATELY\n\nACCLAIMED NEW ALBUM RUSTIN’ IN THE RAIN OUT NOW\n\nMILWAUKEE, WI (September 19, 2023) – Summerfest presented by American Family Insurance is excited to announce the first headliner for 2024 - acclaimed singer, songwriter and musician Tyler Childers and his longtime band, The Food Stamps will be bringing his Mule Pull '24 tour to Milwaukee on Friday, June 28 at the American Family Insurance Amphitheater.\n\nTickets for the show will be available for pre-sale starting this Thursday, September 21 at 10:00 a.m. local time with general on-sale following this Friday, September 22 at 10:00 a.m. local time. Full details can be found HERE. Tickets include admission to Summerfest on the day of the show.\n\nThe Milwaukee show is just the latest added to Childers’ global “Mule Pull ’24 Tour,” which kicks off in February and sold-out immediately after tickets went on-sale last week. Upcoming stops include New York’s Madison Square Garden (two nights), Nashville’s Bridgestone Arena (two nights), Inglewood’s Kia Forum, Austin’s Moody Center, Fort Worth’s Dickies Arena and London’s Eventim Apollo (two nights) as well as shows in Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Norway and more. Special guests on the tour include Medium Build, Hayes Carll, Sylvan Esso, 49 Winchester, John R. Miller and Allison Russell. See below for complete itinerary.\n\nThe tour adds to yet another monumental year for Childers, who released his acclaimed new album, Rustin’ In The Rain, earlier this month via Hickman Holler Records/RCA Records (stream/purchase here). In celebration of the record, Childers recently spoke with The New York Times, who praises, “His songs with roots in bluegrass, Southern rock and Appalachian tradition have pushed the boundaries of country music and even his own fan base, while cementing him as one of the most successful touring and streaming artists in his field—without the aid of radio,” and continues, “when he sings live, his eyes burn with the ferocity of a preacher, and fans hang on to every word.”\n\nCritical acclaim for Rustin’ In The Rain:\n\n“Childers is clearly continuing to grow his audience by simply staying true to himself…one of country music’s more interesting, boundary-pushing artists”—Grammy.com\n\n“a singular figure in roots music”—Vulture\n\n“an original artist dedicated to finding new ways to outdo himself”—Associated Press\n\n“Childers is the most essential mainstream country musician working right now”—Paste\n\n“an uncompromising artist, one who lets his art speak for him…Childers is undeniably one of the most successful artists working today.”—The Bitter Southerner\n\n“he’s redefining country music”—The Tennessean\n\n“this is still Tyler operating on a fully-fleshed-out level, with songs and performances that stand tall next to his best”—Brooklyn Vegan\n\n“one of the year’s more vital pure country albums”—PopMatters\n\n“an outstanding singer and songwriter”—No Depression\n\n“He is and will continue to be one of the most talented and important musical forces in American music and his new album is further evidence of this fact”—Americana Highways\n\n“This is a complete body of work, thoughtfully curated, expertly crafted, and the finished product is yet another stellar piece of the Tyler Childers catalog”—Whiskey Riff\n\n“Childers continues to capture the complexities of rural life as he’s always done, carefully molding each narrative with his calloused hands and knowing heart”—Holler\n\n“the potency of intention and raw emotion captivates”—Hits Daily Double\n\n“an excellent album that completely transports you and makes you feel like you’ve just been dropped into an old-time honky-tonk bar, listening to a collection of timeless tunes”\n\n—Entertainment Focus\n\n“The current king of alt-country”—Live For Live Music\n\nAdditionally, ahead of the release, Childers unveiled breakthrough lead single, “In Your Love,” alongside an official music video, which debuted as YouTube’s #1 trending music video. Since then, it has garnered over 6.4 million video views and 30 million on-demand streams along with acclaim from outlets such as NPR Music, Billboard, Pitchfork, Stereogum, Consequence, The Advocate, OUT and Rolling Stone, who praises, “the music video of compassion and caring we need right now,” while USA Today calls the video “a much-needed portrait of inclusivity.” Watch/share the official music video—written/creative directed by Silas House, and starring Colton Haynes and James Scully—HERE and “The Making of ‘In Your Love’,” a special behind-the-scenes look at the video HERE.\n\nIn addition to “In Your Love,” the album also features new renditions of Kris Kristofferson’s “Help Me Make It Through the Night” and S.G. Goodman’s “Space and Time” as well as special guest vocals from Goodman, Margo Price and Erin Rae (“Luke 2:8-10”) and Ronnie McCoury, Jason Carter and Alan Bartram of the Travelin’ McCourys (“Percheron Mules”).\n\nRecorded at Dragline Studios, the album was produced by Childers and The Food Stamps—James Barker (pedal steel), Craig Burletic (bass), CJ Cain (guitar), Rodney Elkins (drums), Chase Lewis (keyboards) and Jesse Wells (guitar, fiddle).\n\nThe new album follows last year’s triple album, Can I Take My Hounds to Heaven?, which featured eight songs presented in three distinct sonic perspectives—Hallelujah, Jubilee and Joyful Noise. Released to widespread acclaim, Esquire praised, “Who’s doing it better than Childers in roots music these days? No one,” while the Associated Press declared, “fearless exuberance…one of country music’s most compelling and unpredictable artists” and NPR Music asserted, “eight songs so good he had to record them thrice.” Before Hounds, Childers released 2020’s Grammy-nominated surprise album, Long Violent History, which NPR Music called an “explicit and remarkable stand in solidarity.” His two previous releases, 2019’s #1 Country Squire as well 2017’s RIAA Platinum debut, Purgatory, were released to overwhelming critical and commercial acclaim. In the years since his debut, Childers has earned two Grammy nominations and has been featured on “CBS This Morning,” “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” NPR Music’s Tiny Desk Concert series and “Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown.”\n\nRUSTIN’ IN THE RAIN TRACK LIST\n\nRustin’ In the Rain\n\n2.
