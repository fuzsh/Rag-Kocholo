These show that both cosmopolitan and Antarctic–subantarctic genera increased regularly as percentages of faunas with time; 15% of Paleocene genera, 30% of Eocene genera and 59% of Oligocene–Early Miocene genera still live in the Antarctic– subantarctic region. The present major Antarctic families of larger molluscs have remained the most diverse ones since Middle Eocene time, and the Antarctic fauna was well established by then. However, Mytilidae and Veneridae have decreased markedly in diversity, Mactridae and oysters have disappeared from the Antarctic, and Antarctic Trochidae, Volutidae and Conoidea are now distinct guilds of more offshore taxa. This reﬂects the present Antarctic ice cover; shallow-water taxa that are no longer able physically to live in Antarctica provide an index of Antarctic glaciation. Glaciation was not extensive on the Antarctic Peninsula by Late Eocene time, and a few genera of shoreface molluscs still inhabited the King George Island area during Oligocene–Early Miocene time. Subduction has left only sparse localities around the margins of the Paciﬁc and Indian/Australian plates containing shallow-water early Paleogene macrofossils; almost none are known from the central regions of these plates. Few data points are available, so apparent indications of taxa originating in Antarctica are not interpretable. New names are provided for two junior homonyms (Gaimardia zinsmeisteri, replacing Gaimardia ﬂemingi Zinsmeister, 1984; Prosipho stilwelli, replacing Aeneator huttoni Stilwell and Zinsmeister, 1992). © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction The fossil faunas and ﬂoras of Antarctica have always been of great biogeographical interest because of their unique contribution to understanding the history of the southernmost end of the world and its evidence for the Earth's climatic history, particularly the development of Antarctic glaciation. The development of knowledge of Antarctic paleobiogeography and macrofaunal history was reviewed by Stilwell and Zinsmeister (2000, pp. 365–368). For early Cenozoic Antarctic marine macrofaunas, few fossil localities are known and these consequently have been studied in detail. Much the richest and best-known of these faunas is that of La Meseta Formation (Eocene) on Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula. This is now well-known for its highly diverse fossil molluscs (bivalves, gastropods, scaphopods, nautiloids), crabs, lobsters, barnacles, brachiopods, echinoids, asteroids, ophiuroids, crinoids, corals, teleost ﬁsh, sharks, and whales (see references listed by Stilwell and Zinsmeister, 1992, p. 2; Dutton et al., 2002). A variety of birds also has been recorded, including a phororhacoid, a ratite, an ibis-like bird, and diverse penguins (Marples, 1953; Simpson, 1971; Cione et al., 1977; Case et al., 1987; Tambussi et al.,\n\nE-mail address: [email protected]. 0031-0182/$ – see front matter © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.palaeo.2009.09.025\n\n1994; Jadwiszczak, 2006; Jadwiszczak et al., 2008). The fauna indicates deposition in shallow water of normal oceanic salinity and moderate temperatures, close to shore. Even quite diverse terrestrial mammals are present in La Meseta Formation (Woodburne and Zinsmeister, 1984; Case et al., 1988; Vizcaíno et al., 1998a,b; Reguero et al., 1998; Bargo and Reguero, 1998). The present review was initiated by the availability of the overview of the present-day Antarctic molluscan fauna by Dell (1990). This ﬁlls the need for comparison with the present Antarctic fauna, allowing analysis of the biogeographical origins of the La Meseta and other important Antarctic Paleogene molluscan faunas (Fig. 1). Those studied are Paleocene rocks on Seymour Island (Stilwell et al., 2004), Eocene glacial erratics of McMurdo Sound, Ross Sea (Stilwell, 2000) and the Oligocene–Early Miocene rocks of King George Island, South Shetland Islands (Pugaczewska, 1984; Gaździcki and Pugaczewska, 1984; Karczewski, 1987; Studenka, 1991; Anelli et al., 2006; Quaglio et al., 2008). The intention here is to amplify the excellent descriptive work by previous authors with updated identiﬁcations, because the molluscs seem to show closer similarities to the present Antarctic molluscan fauna than earlier studies have suggested. Stilwell (2003a, appendix) provided a list of all Paleocene Mollusca known to him from the most southern localities of the southern hemisphere (New Zealand/Chatham Islands, Australia, Seymour Island, and in particular,\n\n192\n\nA.G. Beu / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 284 (2009) 191–226\n\nFig. 1. Polar stereographic projection to 45°S, at 50 Ma (Early Eocene) (redrawn from Lawver and Gahagan, 2003, ﬁg. 3), showing close position of all southern continents at this time. Darker grey pattern shows land, paler grey shows continental shelves; note seaway open between the Antarctic Peninsula and the present Ross Sea. Paleocene–Eocene fossil localities discussed in the text are shown: Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula (Cretaceous to Late Eocene); King George Island, South Shetland Islands (Oligocene–Early Miocene); McMurdo Sound, Ross Sea (late Middle-Late Eocene); Pebble Point, S Victoria, Australia (late Paleocene); Wangaloa, SE South Island, New Zealand (early Paleocene); Sierra Dorotea, SW Argentina (Cretaceous–Paleocene), an example of Paleocene localities in Argentina and Tierra del Fuego.\n\nseveral localities in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego). His paper should be consulted for a fuller review of the relationships between southern faunas during Paleocene time, and an analysis of changes following the extinctions at the K–T boundary. Some of the genera he listed are reidentiﬁed here, but many are beyond the scope of the present paper, and changes following the K–T extinction are not considered. Another aspect of this paper is a re-evaluation of “high latitude heterochroneity”. Zinsmeister and Feldmann (1984), Wiedman et al. (1988) and Stilwell and Zinsmeister (1992), among others, have promulgated the notion that the Cenozoic fossil crab, brachiopod and mollusc faunas (respectively) of the Antarctic region indicate that this area was a signiﬁcant source of genera. They suggested that these since have become more widespread in more northern faunas, in New Zealand, in the Indo-West Paciﬁc or in the Atlantic. Crame (1996, 1999) reviewed the origins of the present Antarctic molluscan fauna, but all such reviews suffer from the same initial bias: identiﬁcations must be accurate to be of use for evolutionary and biogeographical generalisations. The molluscan faunas reviewed here, from Seymour Island, King George Island and McMurdo Sound, are the only source of information on the Paleogene molluscan fauna of the entire Antarctic region, and so are of great signiﬁcance for biogeography. They are clearly illustrated and described and, particularly for\n\nthe Paleocene and Eocene of Seymour Island, located in a clear stratigraphical, biostratigraphical and chronological framework. Some the stratigraphical framework has been developed since the original description of the fauna (notably by Marenssi et al., 1998; Dutton et al., 2002; Ivany et al., 2008). However, the molluscs all lack comparison with the present-day Antarctic fauna. In particular, Karczewski (1987) compared the Early Miocene gastropods of Cape Melville Formation on King George Island largely with taxa from North America and Europe, scarcely mentioning an Antarctic genus. Stilwell and Zinsmeister (1992) also compared the Early to Late Eocene Seymour Island fauna mainly with New Zealand living taxa, in the now outdated volume by Powell (1979). Stilwell et al. (2004) also compared the Paleocene fauna of Seymour Island mainly with North American fossils. A Miocene Fauna from Kerguelen Island (Giret et al., 1994; LauriatRage et al., 2002) is not considered here, as the taxa apparently are endemic and all closely resemble the present-day Antarctic fauna; little if anything needs revising. Meagre late Neogene faunas (apparently all latest Miocene to Pliocene) also have been reported from the Pecten Conglomerate, Cockburn Island (Zinsmeister and Webb, 1982; Jonkers, 1998, 2003), from Marine Plain, Vestfold Hills (Pickard et al., 1988; Harding, 2005), from Wright Valley, Victoria Land (Turner,\n\nA.G. Beu / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 284 (2009) 191–226\n\n1967; Webb, 1974) and from Black Island and Brown Peninsula, McMurdo Sound (Speden, 1962; Vella, 1969). However, these are all of very low diversity, and most represent unusual near-shore deposition sites. Also, almost all species present still live around Antarctica, the obvious exception being the Pectinidae, which have been revised by Jonkers (2003). Other meagre late Paleogene to Pleistocene faunas have been reported from drill cores by Dell and Fleming (1975; DSDP sites 270 and 272), Beu and Dell (1989; from CIROS-1), Taviani et al. (1998), Jonkers and Taviani (1998), Taviani et al. (2000), and Taviani and Beu (2001, 2003), all from the Cape Roberts drill holes, McMurdo Sound, and by Whitehead et al. (2006) from Lambert graben, inland from Prydz Bay, East Antarctica. They have not been used here to supplement the King George Island and Seymour Island faunas, as they were by Crame (1996). Neogene faunas are essentially identical to the shallow-water fraction of the Recent Antarctic one. The small faunas reported by Dell and Fleming (1975) and Beu and Dell (1989) are helpful in providing records of a pectinid ancestral to the Antarctic living species Adamussium colbecki (Smith, 1902) (see also Jonkers, 2003; Quaglio et al., 2008, ﬁg. 9). They also include Amauropsis(?), Proneptunea, Nuculana, Ledella(?), Sarepta, Malletia, Limopsis, Austrochlamys aff. natans (Philippi), and possibly Macoma, all of which have little or no other conﬁrmed fossil record in Antarctica. None of these assignments requires reidentiﬁcation. The records by Dell and Fleming (1975) and Anelli et al. (2006) of the now major Antarctic genus Limopsis are particularly signiﬁcant, as otherwise it might have been thought absent until geologically recent times, because of its offshore habitat and the shallow depositional facies of onshore Antarctic Cenozoic deposits. Here, I start with the assumption that, being situated in the Antarctic region at present, the faunas of King George Island, Seymour Island and McMurdo Sound are most likely to have Antarctic relationships. An earlier catalogue and overview (Powell, 1960, 1965) of the Antarctic molluscan fauna largely have been supplanted by Dell's (1990) monograph and several later reviews (Hain, 1990; Numanami, 1996; Linse, 2002; Zelaya, 2005; Linse et al., 2006). Gordillo (1995), Cortés and Narosky (1997) and Forcelli (2000) have provided popular accounts of the present-day shallow-water molluscs of southern South America. Dell's (1990) overview deals particularly with the fauna of the Ross Sea, which is on the opposite side of Antarctica from the main area of interest of this paper (Fig. 1), although Dell (1990) recorded and illustrated many taxa extending to West Antarctic as well, and all the later works listed above have dealt with West Antarctic molluscs. A helpful review of molluscan assemblages along the Victoria Land coast and Balleny Islands, Ross Sea, was provided by Schiaparelli et al. (2006), including 20% newly recorded taxa. These are ampliﬁed by personal knowledge of the Paleogene molluscan fauna of southern South America which, as shown in Fig. 1, is much the nearest of extraAntarctic faunas to those of West Antarctica that were reported in most of the publications I review. 2. Materials and methods I commenced this review with revised identiﬁcations (listed in Appendix A) of the Paleogene molluscs (gastropods and bivalves only; scaphopods and nautiloids are not included) previously recorded from Antarctica: (1) the Paleocene fauna of Seymour Island (Stilwell et al., 2004), (2) the Early to Late Eocene fauna of Seymour Island (Stilwell and Zinsmeister 1992), (3) the Eocene fauna of glacial erratic boulders in McMurdo Sound, Ross Sea (Stilwell, 2000), and (4) the Oligocene and Early Miocene (Birkenmajer and Gaździcki, 1986; Birkenmajer et al., 1988) fauna of King George Island. These are followed in Appendix B by notes justifying the identiﬁcation changes. Although Stilwell and Zinsmeister (1992) accepted a Late Eocene age for the fauna of La Meseta Formation, and Stilwell et al. (1993) adopted a Middle Eocene age, the faunas are now known to range in age from Early to Late Eocene (Dutton et al., 2002). Ivany et al. (2008) presented\n\n193\n\ndetailed strontium isotope stratigraphy, along with paleotemperature measurements on bivalve shells (Cucullaea and Retrotapes) in La Meseta Formation. They recognised a large hiatus (c. 47–43 Ma) early in the Middle Eocene (between Telm 5, earliest Middle Eocene, and Telm 6, mid-Middle Eocene; Telm = Tertiary Eocene La Meseta unit; Sadler, 1988) and an otherwise complete record of Eocene time, between c. 55.5 and 33.5 Ma. Ivany et al. (2008, ﬁg. 3) also presented the most useful map to date of the outcrop of Telms 1–7 on Seymour Island. Buick and Ivany (2004) presented results of growth-ring dating and stable isotopes on Cucullaea shells from La Meseta Formation. They recognised a highly unusual habitat for the shells, which lived in darkness for half the year, as all the rest of this fauna also must have. They fed only during the summer, when phytoplankton was available, but bred during winter, and seven of the 12 specimens measured lived for more than 100 years. Buick and Ivany (2004) suggested that long life may be selected for when the chances of reproductive success during any one breeding cycle is low, and that food limitation played a role in extending life by reducing metabolic rate and somatic growth. This is a reminder of the unique ecology of early Paleogene polar faunas, which lived in temperate waters (~14 °C for La Meseta Formation; Buick and Ivany 2004) but with little or no light for half the year. However, it was difﬁcult to allow for this ecology in the present review. The taxa listed in Appendix A are arranged in taxonomic order, specifying family assignment (as several of these are changed from earlier assignments) as well as genera and, where possible, species names. The analysis by Crame (1996, ﬁgs 10.2, 10.3), using family composition, is repeated below using the new assignments, so the family is the most critical identiﬁcation for the present purposes. Genera identiﬁed in Appendix A are used in the following sections as the units for biogeographical analysis, and are also listed below in Table 1, as genera are the standard category for this type of analysis. All taxa originally recorded are listed in Appendix A under the new identiﬁcations, followed by the original identiﬁcation and an abbreviated reference to published illustrations. The newly determined genera are then analysed for biogeographical relationships of interest for this paper, and their percentages in each fauna calculated and compared. The following categories are used: (1) cosmopolitan, including those still living in the Antarctic–subantarctic region at present; (2) genera limited to the Antarctic–subantarctic region at present; the combination of this category and the Antarctic genera listed in (1) gives the total genera still living in the Antarctic–subantarctic region; (3) genera restricted to a particular fauna; (4) genera forming part of the southern, high-latitude, Mesozoic-early Cenozoic fauna, or Weddellian province (Zinsmeister, 1982), regardless of their other biogeographical classiﬁcation (i.e., categories are not necessarily exclusive); (5) genera occurring also in the Cenozoic and/or living fauna of South America; (6) genera occurring also in the Cenozoic and/or living fauna of New Zealand, regardless of their other biogeographical classiﬁcation (although not including obviously cosmopolitan genera); and (7) for La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island, some obvious absences of genera that might have been expected are discussed; for other faunas these are too numerous to be considered. A point to note is that, following Dell's (1990) review, the Antarctic fauna is interpreted here as a single uniform one. Most present-day molluscs occur around the entire continent, despite a small proportion of the modern fauna being restricted geographically, so no attempt is made to subdivide the Paleogene fossil faunas into regions. 3. Paleocene molluscan fauna of Seymour Island I suggest new identiﬁcations in Appendix A for the Paleocene molluscan fauna of the Lopez de Bertodano and Sobral Formations of Seymour Island. The list of Seymour Island Paleocene molluscs by Stilwell et al. (2004) comprises 48 genera, of which 6 (Nucula, Leionucula, Lucinoma, Perissodonta, Euspira, Probuccinum) still live\n\n194\n\nA.G.

The new identiﬁcations listed here include 46 genera, of which 12 are considered not certainly enough identiﬁed to be used in biogeography, leaving a total of 34 genera for analysis. The biogeographical subdivisions recognisable in this fauna are listed below, with their percentage of the fauna. 1. Not considered to be identiﬁed reliably: Indeterminate Nuculanoidea, Ostrea, Patellogastropoda, indeterminate Cerithioidea (3 taxa), indeterminate Naticidae, indeterminate Buccinidae (5 taxa) = 12 taxa in total. 2. Genera limited to the Antarctic–subantarctic region at present: Probuccinum (1 genus, 2.9%). 3. Cosmopolitan genera: Nucula⁎, Leionucula⁎, Jupiteria, Thyasira⁎, Panopea, Periploma, Volutomitra⁎ (7 genera, 21%). Genera identiﬁed with an asterisk⁎ still live in the Antarctic–subantarctic region (4 genera, 12%); adding the restricted Antarctic–subantarctic genus Probuccinum=5 genera (15%) still living in the Antarctic–subantarctic region. 4. Genera endemic to this fauna: Seymourtula, Antarctiranella, Seymourosphaera (probably = the southern Argentinean genus Austrosphaera; see Appendix B, note 19), (new cerithioidean genus) virginiae (3 or 4 genera, 9% or 12%). This category possibly includes a further three genera of unnamed Buccinoidea (see Appendix B, notes 14, 16, 20), making it much the largest group of restricted, endemic genera in any of the faunas studied (it would then contain 6 or 7 restricted genera, = 16–19% of the new total of 37 genera). 5. Weddellian genera (regardless of their other biogeographical classiﬁcations): Neilo, Cucullaea, Lahillia, Marwickia, Cyclorismina (as Cyclorisma in Stilwell et al., 2004; the distinction requires further study), Struthiochenopus, Perissodonta, ?Pyropis, Microfulgur, Cosmasyrinx (Tholitoma) (10 genera, 29%). 6. Genera occurring also in South America: Leionucula, Neilo, Cucullaea, Lucinoma, Lahillia, Pseudotylostoma(?), Austrosphaera (=Seymourosphaera?), Struthiochenopus, Perissodonta, Palaeomelon (10 genera, 29%). 7. Genera occurring also in New Zealand: Neilo, Leionucula, Cucullaea, Acesta, Lucinoma, Lahillia, Marwickia, Cyclorismina, Perissodonta, ? Pyropsis, Microfulgur, Taioma, Cosmasyrinx (Tholitoma) (13 genera, 38%). 8. Obviously, there is a huge number of other genera that might occur at Seymour Island, but have not been recorded. Stilwell (2003a) reviewed southern Paleocene faunas, listing all the faunas he knew of (although his Seymour Island Paleocene monograph was still in press then) including New Zealand, Australian, Antarctic, and Patagonian/Tierra del Fuegan localities. Most of the taxa he recorded might be expected at Seymour Island. 4. Eocene molluscan fauna of Seymour Island I suggest new identiﬁcations in Appendix A for the fauna described and illustrated by Stilwell and Zinsmeister (1992) from the La Meseta Formation (Early to Late Eocene) of Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula. The bivalves originally were described by Zinsmeister (1984),\n\n195\n\nand have been reillustrated and further taxa added by Stilwell and Zinsmeister (1992), who also described the gastropods. Stilwell and Gaździcki (1998) have since added the restricted limid Acesta (Antarcticesta) laticostata to the fauna (=“Chlamys” n. sp. A of Stilwell and Zinsmeister, 1992), and Stilwell (2005a) added Calliotropis antarchais. Also, Zinsmeister and Stilwell (1990) described a Ringicula species, R. cockburnensis, from rocks similar to Telm1 of La Meseta Formation cropping out on Cockburn Island, only 7 km west of Seymour Island. However, this has not been added here to the Seymour Island fauna, although this species was recorded tentatively from McMurdo Sound erratic boulders by Stilwell (2000, p. 310, pl. 9h, t). The La Meseta Formation fauna is much the most diverse and important Cenozoic one reported from the Antarctic region. The faunal list by Stilwell and Zinsmeister (1992) contains 126 genera, of which only three (Gaimardia, Perissodonta and Pareuthria) were considered to be restricted to the Antarctic–subantarctic region at present (2.4%). The new identiﬁcations listed here include 108 genera, of which 20 are considered not sufﬁciently certainly identiﬁed to be used in biogeography, leaving a total of 88 genera for biogeographical analysis. The biogeographical subdivisions recognisable in this fauna are listed below, with their percentage of the fauna. 1. Not considered to be identiﬁed reliably: Yoldiella, Electroma, Mytilus, Perna, Oxyperas, nacellid limpet, Cantharidus, Micrelenchus, Gibbula, Littorina, Bittium, Cerithidea, Austrofusus (i.e., Aethocola; Beu, in press-b), “mitrids” (other than Volutomitra), Turbinellidae, Neoguraleus, Cosmasyrinx, “Inquisitor”, Aforia, Limulatys (20 genera). 2. Genera limited to the Antarctic–subantarctic region at present: Yoldia (Aequiyoldia), Gaimardia, Cyamiomactra, Perissodonta, Falsilunatia, Sinuber, Trophon, Prosipho, Pareuthria, Probuccinum, Chlanidota, Neacteonina, Tornatellaea, Kaitoa, Parvaplustrum(?) (15 genera, 17% of the total of 88 genera). 3. Cosmopolitan genera: Leionucula⁎, Acharax, Mytilus, Perna, Modiolus, Pinna, Acesta, Gryphaea (Notostrea) (early Cenozoic only), Ostrea, Mysella⁎, Thyasira⁎, Cyclocardia⁎, Crassatella, Serratina, Oxyperas, Mactra, Mya⁎, Hiatella⁎, Panopea, Thracia⁎, Calliotropis⁎, Collonia⁎, Littorina, Fusinus, Volutomitra⁎, Gemmula, Syrnola, Eulimella, Agatha, Epitonium⁎, Acirsa, Tuba, Dentalium⁎, Gadila⁎ (32 genera, 36% of the total of 88 genera). The 13 genera still living in the Antarctic–subantarctic region (including Mya; Powell (1960, p. 183); M. antarctica (Melvill and Standen, 1898, Falkland Islands) identiﬁed with an asterisk⁎, bring the list above (15 genera) up to a total of 28 Antarctic–subantarctic genera (32% of the fauna). 4. Genera endemic to this fauna: unnamed genus aff. Nuculoma, Surojupiteria, Mytilosootus, Acesta (Antarcticesta), Nymphactra, Cockburnia, Arrhoges (Antarctohoges), Austroﬁcopsis, Austrosullivania (9 genera, 10%). 5. Weddellian genera: Neilo, Cucullaea (bipolar at this time, and so perhaps to be included in cosmopolitan genera), Lahillia, Cyclorismina, Colposigma, Struthioptera, Perissodonta, Microfulgur, Pristimerica, Priscaphander (10 genera, 11%). 6. Genera occurring also in South America: Leionucula, Neilo (Cenozoic only; still living in New Zealand), Arcuatula, Modiolus, Saxolucina?, Mulinia, Retrotapes, Eupleura?, Miomelon, Adelomelon, Odontocymbiola, Austrotoma (see Appendix B, note 93) (11 genera, 12.5%). 7. Genera occurring also in New Zealand [NZ]: Leionucula still lives in both areas, but apparently is very widespread, and probably cosmopolitan (see Appendix B, note 1). Neilo lives in NZ only, but is fossil also in the North Paciﬁc, e.g., Savitsky (1980, ﬁg. 2), as Multidentata, Miocene of the Russian far east and northern Japan, a synonym of Neilo. The specimens illustrated by Amano et al. (2000, ﬁg. 2–4) agree with New Zealand Neilo species in all characters, and clearly show the diagnostic umbonal-ventral posterior ridge. See also Neilo gryci Marincovich (1993, p. 11, ﬁg. 8.1–8.4), Danian, northern Alaska. Dall (1908, p. 386, pl. 18, ﬁg. 6) also referred Malletia goniura Dall (Recent, Gulf of Panama, 3058 m) to Neilo,\n\n196\n\nA.G. Beu / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 284 (2009) 191–226\n\nand it has a similarly rostrate posterior, although it is very small (13 mm long) and smooth, so probably is not correctly referred here. Acharax lives in NZ, but is widespread. Cucullaea does not live now in either area. Genaxinus still lives in both areas. Lahillia occurs in Late Cretaceous–Danian rocks in NZ, and in Late Cretaceous– Miocene rocks in South America. Atamarcia is restricted to the Cenozoic fauna of these two areas. Cyclorismina occurs in Late Cretaceous rocks in NZ, and in early Cenozoic ones on Seymour Island, and in the Eocene of McMurdo Sound. Cantharidus(?) and Micrelenchus(?) both live in NZ, and possibly are present in the Seymour Island fauna. Colposigma apparently is widespread in NZ, Australia and South America. Trichosirius, which occurs in the Cenozoic and living fauna in NZ, is present at Seymour Island, but possibly is a synonym of Cerithioderma, a widespread genus. Struthioptera is endemic to the Late Cretaceous–early Cenozoic record of these two areas and Patagonia only (Stilwell, 2003c). Arrhoges is moderately widespread, and is still living in the NW Atlantic. Perissodonta (see Appendix B, note 126) is circumAntarctic and subantarctic at present, and early Cenozoic only in NZ, but widespread, abundant and diverse in Paleogene and Miocene rocks of southern South America and Seymour Island. Falsilunatia is circum-Antarctic and subantarctic at present (Dell, 1990), and a few species occur in deep-water Cenozoic rocks in NZ, mainly late Neogene; several fossil species are present in southern Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego, Seymour Island, and possibly Chile. Trophon includes the one NZ late Neogene species T. munitus Marwick (1934) (only tentatively assigned here), but the genus is abundant and diverse in the Cenozoic and living circum-Antarctic, subantarctic and southern South American fauna (Pastorino, 2005; Grifﬁn and Pastorino, 2005). Penion is common in the Cenozoic record of South America, Seymour Island, Australia and NZ, and lives in Australia and NZ only (Hayashi, 2005, p. 94). Microfulgur occurs in the early Cenozoic in both NZ and South AmericaSeymour Island. Taioma has the same record, but also occurs in the Late Cretaceous on Seymour Island, and is recorded also from the Sonja lens, Agatdal Formation, Nûgssuaq, West Greenland, Danian (Kollmann and Peel, 1983, p. 97, ﬁg. 220C, D; as Clinura sp.). A cast in GNS (WM1876) of a larger Agatdal specimen (height 68 mm) was sent by A. Rosenkrantz, so Taioma might well be a more widely distributed genus. Pristimerica occurs in the early Cenozoic rocks of NZ and Seymour Island only. Zemacies occurs in Paleocene–early Pliocene rocks in NZ, in Paleocene–Miocene ones in Australia, South America, and Seymour Island, and is living in the tropical Paciﬁc (Sysoev and Bouchet, 2001, p. 283). Austrotoma (see Appendix B, note 93) has a record like that of Zemacies, but rather than the tropics, is still living off eastern South America (Cortés and Narosky, 1997, p. 77; Forcelli, 2000, p. 109, ﬁg. 321; “Pleurotomella” aguayoi Carcelles, 1953; Beu, in press-a). Marshallaria occurs in early to mid-Cenozoic rocks of New Zealand, Australia and Seymour Island. Large, similar, coarsely sculptured species of Cirsotrema are common in Cenozoic rocks of New Zealand and South America, and one species is present in Seymour Island; it still lives in SE Australia (Beu, in press-a) (24 genera, 27%). It is important for biogeography to note that, in my opinion, almost none of the Buccinidae described by Stilwell and Zinsmeister (1992) belongs in the restricted New Zealand genera employed by them (Aeneator, “Austrofusus” (i.e., Aethocola; Beu, in press-b), Cominella, Nassicola, and Zelandiella). The possible exception is Pseudofax, which deserves careful reconsideration based on comparison of specimens. Many of Stilwell & Zinsmeister's records can be referred to Antarctic–subantarctic genera, such as Prosipho and Chlanidota, although many others are not well enough preserved for identiﬁcation. On the other hand, the buccinoidean genus Penion, which occurs in the Cenozoic fossil record of both Australasia and South America, does occur in the Antarctic Paleogene fauna.\n\n8. Some absences: Some of the genera not recorded in the Seymour Island fauna are surprising, most notably Limopsis. This is the most diverse genus of larger bivalves around Antarctica at present (Dell, 1990, pp. 17–26; 9 species) and some species are abundant and reach a large size (L. marionensis Smith, 1885: 60 × 80 mm; Dell, 1990, p. 20). It is also common and conspicuous in the Cenozoic faunas of both New Zealand and southern South America. However, its presence in the DSDP core samples recorded by Dell and Fleming (1975) and the recent record from King George Island by Anelli et al. (2006) show that it has been present around Antarctica since at least Oligocene–Early Miocene time. Today it inhabits a more offshore environment than that represented by Antarctic fossil faunas. Perhaps the next most surprising absence is that of all Glycymerididae, particularly Glycymerita, which is common, large and widespread in comparable shallow-water early Cenozoic rocks of New Zealand and southern South America. The one possible record of the family is from King George Island (Pugaczewska in Gaździcki and Pugaczewska, 1984, pl. 18, ﬁg. 8; as Cardium cf. pisum Philippi). Another conspicuous absence is the Philobryidae, the most speciose family of living Antarctic bivalves (Crame, 1996, ﬁg. 10.3). The Seymour Island depositional environment evidently was not favourable for the preservation of small, thin-shelled bivalves. The genus Mysella also might be expected to be more diverse. Again, Astarte is a conspicuous member of the living Antarctic fauna, lending a bipolar aspect as it is not recorded from the Cenozoic rocks of most southern hemisphere areas, including New Zealand, South America and Seymour Island. However, the late Dr P. A. Maxwell recognised unrecorded taxa of Astartidae in NZ Early Eocene rocks, and it is present in both New Zealand Late Cretaceous rocks (J. S. Crampton, pers. comm.) and the late Paleocene fauna of Pebble Point, Victoria, Australia (Darragh, 1994). Laternula is a further conspicuous absence, as L. elliptica (King and Broderip, 1832) is one of the largest and most abundant Antarctic bivalves at present (Dell, 1990, p. 62), occurring at abundances of up to 50/m2 off the South Orkney Islands. It could be concluded that Laternula had not yet reached Antarctica, although its thin, fragile shell might not have been preserved in Seymour Island rocks. However, Alistair Crame (British Antarctic Survey (BAS), pers. comm. October 2008) informed me that a specimen of Laternula in BAS was collected from the Polonez Cove Formation (Oligocene) on King George Island by Bert Jonkers, and that the material from the Cockburn Island Formation (Pliocene) on Cockburn Island identiﬁed as “Laternula sp. n.?” by Jonkers (1998, pl. 1, ﬁg. 5, 1999) is probably a distinct species, larger than L. elliptica. The fossil history of Laternula, therefore, is more diverse than published records suggest. Crame (1999, p. 5) also pointed out that the record of Laternula from the Middle Eocene Río Turbio Formation in southern Patagonia by Grifﬁn (1991, p. 140) is apparently the oldest report of the genus, suggesting that it had little distance to cover to reach Antarctica. The vetigastropods are virtually 100% different genera from those recorded by Dell (1990), but the distinction results largely from the very shallow facies represented by the Seymour Island faunas. The exception is Calliotropis, recently recorded by Stilwell (2005a). The Naticidae are also of low diversity compared with the large fauna described by Dell (1990), but again the shallow depth of deposition has had a strong inﬂuence, as most present-day Antarctic naticids are deep-water taxa distinct from the Seymour Island ones. The Buccinoidea (sensu lato) are diverse in the Seymour Island fauna, and the reidentiﬁcations show that all reasonably certainly identiﬁable taxa have modern Antarctic relationships, rather than with the New Zealand region, although many of the living Antarctic genera still are not known fossil from the region. The exceptions are the more generalised busyconine–melongenine groups (Busyconinae, Fusininae and Melongenidae and similar groups in Bouchet et al. 2005, pp. 254–255), characteristic world-wide of Paleogene faunas, but of\n\nA.G. Beu / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 284 (2009) 191–226\n\nlower diversity at present. Kantor (2003) and Harasewych and Kantor (2004, appendix) recognised as valid taxa, on anatomical grounds, most of the families and subfamilies proposed by Powell (1929) for southern hemisphere Buccinoidea. This suggests that the apparent bipolarity of buccinoidean taxa results from convergence following very long separation, rather than recent connections between boreal and austral buccinoidean faunas. Trophon, the most speciose living Antarctic muricid, is represented by only one species and might be expected to be of greater diversity. Finally, Dell (1990) recorded a large, diverse fauna of Conoidea, i.e., Turridae sensu lato, now recognised as several families (Taylor et al., 1993; Puillandre et al., 2008). Many of them are of conspicuous size. Those recorded by Stilwell and Zinsmeister (1992) from Seymour Island have almost nothing in common with the present Antarctic fauna. They resemble more closely the Paleogene fossil Conoidea of Australia and New Zealand and, to a lesser extent, of southern South America. The possible Aforia species recognised in La Meseta Formation is the single conoidean taxon possibly in common with the Recent Antarctic fauna. Again the depth of deposition probably had a strong inﬂuence on the preserved fauna, as many of the taxa recorded by Dell (1990) were dredged in deep water. However, the taxa at Seymour Island are not recorded living around Antarctica at present even in shallow water, so much of the difference apparently results from a general evolution of conoidean faunas during Cenozoic time.\n\n5. Eocene fauna of McMurdo Sound erratic boulders I suggest new identiﬁcations in Appendix A for the fauna of Middle to Late Eocene glacial erratic boulders around McMurdo Sound, Ross Sea, described and illustrated by Hertlein (1969) and Stilwell (2000). The list of McMurdo Sound molluscs by Stilwell (2000) comprises 57 genera (including doubtfully identiﬁed taxa such as Anomiidae, Patellogastropoda, Rissoidae, and Cerithiidae), of which 9 are still living around Antarctica (16%). The new identiﬁcations listed here include 40 identiﬁed genera, of which 4 are considered not certainly enough identiﬁed to be used in biogeography, leaving 36 genera for analysis. The biogeographical subdivisions recognisable in this fauna are listed below, with their percentage of the fauna. 1. Not considered to be identiﬁed certainly: Bembicium, Bittium, Arrhoges, Austrocominella. 2. Genera limited to the Antarctic–subantarctic region at present: Retrotapes, Perissodonta, Falsilunatia, Chlanidota (4 genera, 11%). 3. Cosmopolitan genera: Leionucula⁎, Saccella⁎, Yoldiella⁎, Solemya, Cucullaea, Crassostrea, Brachidontes, Conchocele, Cardita, Cyclocardia⁎, Crassatella, Caryocorbula, Panopea, Thracia⁎, Acteon⁎, Ringicula (16 genera, 44%; all but the last two are bivalves). The 6 genera identiﬁed with an asterisk⁎ still live in the Antarctic–subantarctic region, 17% of the total; adding the restricted Antarctic–subantarctic genera (above) (4 genera) gives a total of 10 genera (28%). 4. Weddellian genera: Neilo, Perissodonta (2 genera, 6%). 5. Genera occurring also in South America: Leionucula, Saccella, Neilo, Cucullaea, Cyamiomactra, Cyamiocardium, Retrotapes, Arrhoges, ? Drepanocheilus (9 genera, 25%). 6. Genera occurring also in New Zealand: Linucula, Yoldiella, Neilo, Limopsista(?) (recorded only from McMurdo Sound and the Wangaloa fauna in New Zealand), Cyclorismina, Drepanocheilus, Penion, Crenilabium (8 genera, 22%). 7. Genera not recognised in La Meseta Formation of Seymour Island, i.e., additional genera in the Antarctic Eocene list: Linucula(?), Acila (?), Saccella⁎, Pseudotindaria(?), Solemya, Limopsista(?), smooth pectinid, ribbed pectinid, Anomia(?), Crassostrea(?), Miltha(?), Conchocele, Cyamiocardium(?), Cardita, Crassatella, Caryocorbula (?), Bembicium(?), Tulochilus, genus of Ampullinidae(?), Austrocominella(?), Ringicula(?) (21 genera). However, Bembicium and Austrocominella are listed above as not certainly identiﬁed. Ringi-\n\n197\n\ncula was recorded only from La Meseta Formation on Cockburn Island, rather than Seymour Island, by Zinsmeister and Stilwell (1990). Also, the smooth pectinid is not certainly distinct from the La Meseta Formation taxon. This leaves 17 genera, 47% of the McMurdo erratic fauna of 36 genera. Saccella is added to the list of genera that still live in the Antarctic–subantarctic region. No genera are restricted to this fauna. Gastropods seem to be under-represented, and there are particularly few neogastropods. Conoideans are not represented among the reidentiﬁcations. This is a much more generalised fauna than all others studied here, with a much less marked dominance of buccinoideans than in the other faunas, suggesting that further collecting would bring more taxa to light. However, this possibly would be prevented by the severe lithiﬁcation. The very limited “outcrop” as boulders in moraines presumably limits the collected fauna severely. The absence of Conoidea and several other neogastropod groups that are well-represented in the La Meseta Formation suggests either a preservational bias or that the fauna of the McMurdo Sound erratics was deposited in even shallower water than other Paleogene Antarctic faunas.\n\n6. Oligocene–Early Miocene fauna of King George Island The list of suggested new identiﬁcations of King George Island molluscs in Appendix A is compiled from the papers by Pugaczewska (in Gaździcki and Pugaczewska, 1984) and Quaglio et al. (2008) on the fauna of Polonez Cove Formation (Oligocene), and by Karczewski (1987) on the gastropods and Anelli et al. (2006) on the bivalves of Cape Melville Formation (Early Miocene). Studenka (1991) also recorded a species of Panopea from Destruction Bay Formation (Early Miocene). The brief list by Pugaczewska (1984) of a fauna from Magda Nunatak, King George Island (Retrotapes sp., not R. newtoni (Wilckens, 1911); Panopea sp., Dentalium (sensu lato) sp.) adds nothing to the faunal list and is not included. In addition, a rock-boring bivalve, Penitella (Pholadidae) or a similar genus such as Pholadidea was recorded by Gaździcki et al. (1982), although it is poorly preserved and not certainly identiﬁed. It occurs in the bases of four pebbly sandstone beds in otherwise unfossiliferous Siklawa Member of Polonez Cove Formation (Oligocene) at Mazurek Point on King George Island. The molluscan fauna of King George Island is markedly less diverse than that of Seymour Island (above), presumably as a result of (a) a more cemented matrix — the signiﬁcance of lithiﬁcation in reducing apparent biodiversity was pointed out by Hendy (2005, 2009), (b) a very much smaller outcrop area, (c) a still shallower site of deposition, and (d) deposition after the onset of Antarctic glaciation and consequent decrease in molluscan diversity. Also, the pectinid shellbeds represent a unique site (for Antarctica) of very slow deposition, i.e., a sediment starvation period, such as a sea-level high-stand, with highly concentrated shells (Gaździcki, 1982, 1984; “Austrochlamys” gazdzickii Jonkers, 2003, p. 63, pl. 12a–d). The total number of molluscan genera recorded here is 34, but of these the ostreid, two pectinids, Venericardia(?), and Urosalpinx(?) are considered too poorly known to be used in biogeography, resulting in a usable total of 29 genera. Biogeographical elements recognised in the fauna are listed below, with their percentages. 1. Genera limited to the Antarctic–subantarctic region at present: Yoldia (Aequiyoldia), Antarctolima, Adamussium, ?Cyamiidae indet., Falsilunatia, Perissodonta, ?Obscuranella, Prosipho, Chlanidota, Trophon; most are present also at Seymour Island (10 genera, 35%). 2. Cosmopolitan genera: Nucula?⁎, Leionucula⁎, Glycymeris, Limopsis⁎, Cyclocardia⁎, Pratulum, Panopea, Periploma, ?Turbo, the turritellid, Volutomitra⁎, Aforia⁎, Philine⁎, ?mathildid (14 genera, 48% of the fauna of 29 genera). The seven genera identiﬁed with an asterisk⁎ still live in the Antarctic–subantarctic region (24%). Adding the 10\n\n198\n\nA.G. Beu / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 284 (2009) 191–226\n\ngenera (listed above) still living in the Antarctic–subantarctic region = 17 genera, 59% of the fauna. 3. Weddellian genera: Struthioptera, Austrotoma? (both are present also in both New Zealand and Seymour Island) (2 genera, 7%). 4. Genera occurring also in South America: Leionucula, Neilo, Limopsis, Swiftopecten(?), Retrotapes, Penion, Trophon, Adelomelon, Austrotoma (all but Swiftopecten and Limopsis are recorded also from Seymour Island) (9 genera, 31%). 5. Genera occurring also in New Zealand: Leionucula, Neilo, Limopsis, Struthioptera, Penion, Volutomitra, Austrotoma, Philine (8 genera, 28%). No genera are restricted to this fauna, although the apparently unnamed genus required for “Austrochlamys” gazdzickii is otherwise represented only by “Chlamys” mawsoni Fletcher, 1938, Miocene(?), Kerguelen Island (Jonkers, 2003, pl. 15e). The fauna is much more markedly dominated by cosmopolitan (48%) and Antarctic–subantarctic elements (59%) than all other faunas studied here.\n\n7. Graphical comparison of faunas 7.1. Biogeographical composition Fig. 2 is a graphical comparison of the changing proportions of the biogeographical elements identiﬁed above within each Antarctic Paleogene fauna. Both cosmopolitan and Antarctic–subantarctic taxa show a gradual, regular increase with time. The dominant taxa in the Paleocene fauna have New Zealand (38% of Seymour Island Paleocene genera), South American (29%) and Weddellian (29%) relationships, in a more evenly distributed biogeographical composition than all later faunas. They change gradually with time to domination by cosmopolitan taxa (36% in Seymour Island Eocene, 44% in McMurdo Sound erratics), and eventually to domination by taxa that now live in the Antarctic–subantarctic region (59% of the King George Island fauna). Cosmopolitan taxa are less dominant (48% of the King George Island fauna). Obviously, these categories are not mutually exclusive. Taxa now occupying the Antarctic–subantarctic region, not necessarily exclusively, made up only 15% of the Seymour Island Paleocene fauna, but made up a third (32%) of the Seymour Island Eocene fauna, and dominated (59%) the King George Island Oligocene–Early Miocene fauna. Genera restricted to each fauna reached only 10– 12%, in both the Paleocene and Eocene faunas of Seymour Island, although they possibly reached as high as 19% in the Paleocene fauna, taking unnamed genera into account. None has been recognised in the younger faunas studied. Restricted taxa evidently have been replaced by cosmopolitan or currently Antarctic-wide taxa as temperatures fell through Neogene time. Stilwell and Zinsmeister (2000, p. 369) recognised a total of 136 molluscan genera from Antarctic Eocene rocks (La Meseta Formation, Seymour Island, plus McMurdo Sound erratics) of which 11% were considered to be “endemic and unknown outside the continent”. Total genera recognised here in the combined Eocene fauna, using ﬁgures listed in Table 1, below, and only bivalves and gastropods = 118 genera, of which 35 (30%) are restricted to or still live in the Antarctic– subantarctic region. Taxa that still live in the Antarctic region and Southern Ocean provide a better estimate of Antarctic faunal change and are considered to form a more useful biogeographical element to identify than those that are entirely restricted to Antarctica. The lower percentage of Antarctic–subantarctic molluscs in the McMurdo erratics fauna (28%) than in the La Meseta Formation fauna (32%) obviously has an inﬂuence here. However, given the very limited size of the McMurdo Sound erratic boulder “outcrop”, this is inferred to be a result of chance collection differences rather than a signiﬁcant biogeographical difference. The 95% conﬁdence limits on these percentages also are not signiﬁcantly different.\n\nFig. 2. Histogram of percentages of genera making up biogeographical elements in the Antarctic Paleogene faunas (bivalves and gastropods only) compared here. Hachured column (restricted Seymour Island Paleocene genera) indicates doubt whether 9 or 12% of genera are restricted to that fauna.\n\n7.2. Familial composition Histograms of the numbers of species in each bivalve and gastropod family were also compiled in a similar way to those of\n\nA.G. Beu / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 284 (2009) 191–226\n\nCrame (1996, ﬁg.10.2, 10.3) (Figs 3 and 4). The Cretaceous fauna listed by Crame is not included in this study; part is nevertheless included as it has since been redated as early Paleocene. The Cenozoic faunas show numbers of species in each family as a percentage of the total bivalve or gastropod species numbers, rather than being weighted for abundance, as in Crame's ﬁgures. The present-day fauna (righthand column) shows the percentages determined by Crame (1996), modiﬁed slightly. A rather surprising aspect is the number of families that have been deleted from the fauna altogether, as a result of the reidentiﬁcations: Sportellidae, Psammobiidae, Trapeziidae, Vermetidae, Ficidae(?), Columbellidae, Olividae, Mitridae, Bullidae, and Architectonicidae. The putative pholadid has also been reidentiﬁed, but as noted above, Gaździcki et al. (1982) subsequently recorded the pholadid bivalve Penitella from Polonez Cove Formation, King George Island. On the other hand, a few families have been added to the faunas: Acharacidae, Sareptidae, ?Neilonellidae, Glycymerididae(?) (one possible record), Nacellidae (possibly), Turbinidae, Littorinidae (possibly), Ampullinidae, Haminoeidae (possibly, or possibly “unnamed family for Parvaplustrum” of Powell, 1951). The overall effect of these deletions and replacements is to lessen the warm-water aspect of the early Cenozoic faunas, and to make them more nearly similar to the living Antarctic and southern South American faunas than would have been supposed from the earlier identiﬁcations. Some groups remain, however, that now inhabit markedly warmer water than the Antarctic–subantarctic region, such as Eucrassatella, Cras-\n\n199\n\nsostrea, Crenilabium, and possibly Ficus. Of course, other genera such as Cucullaea and Zemacies inhabit much warmer water today, but they were apparently more widespread in the past. The important point is that the overall appearance of the family group histograms has changed relatively little from those published by Crame (1996), despite many changes in detail; Crame's histograms are included in Figs. 3 and 4 for comparison. It appears that the same families have been the major components of the Antarctic fauna for most of Cenozoic time, and remain so today: Nuculidae and other paleotaxodont bivalves, Pectinidae, Carditidae, Veneridae, Hiatellidae, Trochidae, Aporrhaidae/Struthiolariidae, Buccinoidea (sensu lato), Conoidea, and diverse shelled opithobranchs. This is probably also true of all faunas inhabiting the southern half of the southern hemisphere. It is the proportions of biogeographical components within these groups that have changed dramatically with time (Fig. 2) rather than the family composition. 7.3. Generalisations from histograms Generalisations to emerge from the graphical comparisons are: 1. The most diverse families of Antarctic larger gastropods have remained largely unchanged since Paleocene and Eocene time: Trochidae, Naticidae, Conoidea and, above all, Buccinoidea (sensu lato). However, Cerithioidea, Stromboidea (Aporrhaidae+Struthiolariidae)\n\nFig. 3.

The most diverse families of Antarctic bivalves also have remained largely unchanged since Eocene time: protobranchs, Carditidae, and Veneridae. However, Mytilidae, Veneridae and Hiatellidae have decreased in diversity markedly during this time, Pectinidae increased until Oligocene–Early Miocene time (perhaps recording unusual periods of slow deposition) and then decreased again dramatically in diversity, and Cucullaeidae, Glycymerididae, Ostreioidea, Lahilliinae, Mactridae, Crassatellidae, and Periplomatidae have disappeared from the Antarctic fauna altogether since Paleogene time. Rather than only 2.4% of the fauna (in the identiﬁcations by Stilwell and Zinsmeister, 1992), genera still living in the Antarctic– subantarctic region comprise 15% of the Paleocene fauna, 30% of the Eocene fauna and 59% of the King George Island fauna. The Antarctic molluscan fauna clearly was well established by early Cenozoic time, a point already concluded by Clarke and Crame (1989, p. 264): “Overall the fauna has had a long evolutionary history and thus has no single origin. In a sense, it has always been there”. Therefore, the onset of glacial conditions did not bring about radical changes, and “there is no simple relationship between the onset of glaciation and the extinction of certain key bivalve and decapod groups” (Crame, 1999, p. 1). The benthos evidently had somewhere to retreat to during glaciations. It is feasible that some taxa retreated to and advanced from the deep sea around Antarctica, particularly once Antarctic waters cooled to near their present temperatures. However, the shallow-water benthos that is represented by fossils at Seymour Island has more in common with South America than with the deep sea, and seems likely to have migrated back and forth from South America, via the Scotia Arc. The most diverse genus in the Recent Antarctic fauna, Limopsis, has almost no fossil record in onshore rocks in the region, apart from a possible record of the very small genus or subgenus Limopsista in the McMurdo Sound erratics. The abundant large species might well have been assumed to have arrived in the Antarctic region relatively recently were it not for the Oligocene(?) record of Limopsis by Dell and Fleming (1975), and the Oligocene occurrence recorded by Anelli et al. (2006) from King George Island. This is probably another result of the shallow-water deposition site of the Antarctic Paleogene faunas, as Recent Antarctic Limopsis species mostly live in deep water. The very diverse families of small bivalves and gastropods, with most adults b5 mm long, in the present Antarctic fauna have virtually no fossil record in the region (right-hand column in Figs. 3 and 4): Philobryidae, Kelliidae, Lasaeidae, Montacutidae, Leptonidae, Cyamiidae, Perrierinidae, Condylocardiidae, Scissurellidae, Eatoniellidae, Cingulopsidae, Barleeidae, Rissoidae, Marginellidae, Diaphanidae and Eulimidae. Note that, although Crame (1996) maintained all the “traditional” families of small bivalves including Cyamiidae, Perrierinidae and Gaimardiidae, Ponder (1971) united these three families on anatomical grounds, and has been followed by most later authors, such as Zelaya (2005, 2008). In order to allow comparison with Crame's (1996) histograms, these families have been kept separate here. Other major families of small gastropods (notably Pyramidellidae) are greatly under-represented in the fossil faunas. However, this is likely to be a reﬂection, again, of the shallow, near-shore deposition site of the Seymour Island and King George Island rocks, combined with the difﬁculty of preparing samples of small molluscs from these cemented lithologies. It is unclear how much sampling has been carried out to extract small molluscs, but clearly it would be worth trying. Cooper et al. (2006) pointed out the preservational bias affecting small fossils, and Hendy (2005, 2009) discussed the deleterious effects of lithiﬁca-\n\n201\n\ntion. Valentine et al. (2006) also pointed out that the 308 genera of living bivalves not recorded as fossils do not comprise a random sample, but consist of small taxa with commensal or parasitic habit, deep-sea distribution, narrow geographic range, occurrence in areas with few Neogene fossils, or a recent date of description. Most taxa not recorded as fossils have at least two of these characteristics and tend to be concentrated in particular families. Consequently, it is difﬁcult to take account of these absences in biogeography. 6. Some families of infaunal, near-shore to shoreface bivalves in Cenozoic and living faunas that are common throughout the temperate and tropical world are notably more diverse in the Seymour Island Paleocene to Late Eocene faunas than in any later Antarctic faunas, particularly Ostreioidea, Mactridae, Veneridae and large Mytilidae. This faunal change likely resulted from the presence of exposed rocky shores and of normal, soft sediments in shoreface environments around Antarctica before the development of ice shelves, and their disappearance from the region with the advent of glaciation (discussed further below). 7. A similar change in the generic composition of the diverse Buccinoidea and disappearance or marked decrease of the Cucullaeidae, Lahilliinae, Pleurotomariidae, and Aporrhaidae/ Struthiolariidae from the Antarctic fauna more likely results from the general waning of diversity of these groups through Paleogene time throughout the world, along with the retreat of Pleurotomariidae to deeper water during Cenozoic time. The Aporrhaidae and the busyconine–melongenine buccinoideans, many with columellar plaits, were diverse and widely distributed in Mesozoic and Paleocene–Eocene faunas over much of the world, in New Zealand (Beu and Maxwell, 1990) and southern South America (e.g., Zinsmeister and Grifﬁn, 1995; Stilwell, 2003a) as much as in the classic Paleogene faunas of the Paris Basin and the Gulf Coast of the United States. The one living Antarctic remnant of the Aporrhaidae/Struthiolariidae clade is Perissodonta which, ironically, seems likely to have been the Late Cretaceous–early Cenozoic ancestor of the entire struthiolariid radiation. The Lahilliinae is the one faunal element providing a deﬁnite link between the Late Cretaceous–early Cenozoic faunas of Australia, New Zealand, South America and Seymour Island, and occurs nowhere else during early Cenozoic time. However, it is now extinct. The widespread occurrence of the Mesozoic lahilliine genera Integricardium and Onestia in Europe, Alaska, Canada and Australia, i.e., more-or-less cosmopolitan (see Appendix B, note 42) demonstrates that, rather than being a restricted Weddellian group, Lahilliinae was relict in the Southern Ocean after formerly occupying a much wider area. The Cucullaeidae is another family that formerly was much more widespread than it is at present; it is now reduced to a single living tropical Paciﬁc species. The Buccinoidea were diverse enough early in Paleogene time for the change not to have affected their overall diversity, and the classic genera of living Antarctic buccinids were already quite diverse by Eocene time: Chlanidota, Prosipho, and fewer species of Probuccinum and Pareuthria. Further study of better material of some of the buccinids not reidentiﬁed here possibly will demonstrate that they belong in further genera that still live around Antarctica, such as Proneptunea, Antarctoneptunea, and Neobuccinum. Some of the material referred here to Penion might well belong in Antarctoneptunea. 8. The taxonomically and morphologically diverse Conoidea have, not surprisingly, maintained their high diversity around Antarctica throughout at least Middle Eocene to Recent time, despite an apparently complete generic turnover. However, none has been collected from the McMurdo Sound Eocene erratics; “?Turridae” of Stilwell (2000, pl. 9i, j, l, m) is reidentiﬁed here as Perissodonta (see Appendix B, note 126), and few Conoidea are present in Seymour Island Paleocene rocks. A shallow deposition site (in about 10–30 m of water) for the Seymour Island rocks would explain a lot of the difference in generic composition, as conoideans are most diverse\n\n202\n\nA.G. Beu / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 284 (2009) 191–226\n\nwell offshore. This is possibly countered by the dominance of protobranchs among the bivalves in this fauna, suggesting either a more offshore deposition site or a ﬁne-grained substrate. Relative depth of deposition is likely to have affected the proportions of the palaeotaxodont bivalves, trochoideans, conoideans, and shelled opisthobranchs in all these faunas, to judge from the trophic analysis review by Hickman (1984). However, the generic turnover of conoideans appears largely to be part of the evolution of world conoidean faunas during Cenozoic time. 8. Faunal list and similarity indices Occurrences of the genera recognised in the present study (identiﬁed in Appendix A) are listed in Table 1. Most taxa identiﬁed only to family and highly uncertain generic determinations have been deleted from Table 1 for the purpose of calculating similarity indices, as categories such as “Chlamys (indeterminate)” are not likely to refer to the same genus in different faunas. However, more of the uncertainly identiﬁed genera are included in Table 1 than in the biogeographical analyses above, for completeness of the faunal lists. One of the main conclusions from Table 1 is that three genera (Leionucula, Thracia and Perissodonta) have been present in the Antarctic–subantarctic region throughout Cenozoic time, and still live around Antarctica. Others were present throughout Paleocene–Eocene time, but became extinct in Antartica as temperatures fell towards the end of Eocene time (Neilo, Cucullaea, Bittium?). This possibly includes Lahillia, although it is not recorded from McMurdo Sound erratic boulders. Still others remain characteristic Antarctic–subantarctic genera that were not present during Paleocene time, but have been present since the Early or Middle Eocene (Cyamiomactra, Cyclocardia, Retrotapes, Falsilunatia). Limopsis may well have been a member of this group, but has no deﬁnite record before the Oligocene/Early Miocene of King George Island, unless Limopsista is considered a synonym, as it was by Beu (2006, pp. 178–179). The table also helps visually to demonstrate the dearth of neogastropods and heterobranch gastropods in almost all faunas, compared with their high diversity in La Meseta Formation. Table 2 lists three similarity indices (Hammer and Harper, 2006, pp. 212–213) calculated from the presence/absence counts of genera in Table 1. Jaccard's index is calculated as M/N (M = number of genera common to the two compared faunas; N = number of genera not shared between the two; i.e., M + N = total number of genera in both faunas). Simpson's index is calculated as M/S (S = total genera in the smaller fauna). Dice's index (also known as Sørensen's) is calculated as 2M/(2M + N). All give results between 0 (no similarity) and 1 (identical). Although the ranges of values are very different for the three indices, the results are similar. The faunas of La Meseta Formation and the McMurdo Sound erratic boulders (the two Eocene faunas, with about 13 species in common) are the most similar, judged by Jaccard's and Dice's indices. However, those of La Meseta Formation and King George island are the most similar judged by Simpson's index. The fauna of Seymour Island Paleocene formations is equally dissimilar to the faunas of both King George Island and the McMurdo Sound erratic boulders (the most dissimilar ones in age) judged by all three indices. All other compared faunas have indices intermediate between these extremes. As might be expected, the faunas that are most dissimilar in Table 2 Similarity indices of Antarctic Paleogene molluscan faunas, calculated from numbers of genera listed in Table 1. Faunas compared\n\nJaccard\n\nSimpson\n\nDice\n\nPaleocene: La Meseta Formation Paleocene: McMurdo erratics Paleocene: King George Island La Meseta Form: McMurdo erratics La Meseta Form: King George Island McMurdo erratics: King George Island\n\n0.154 0.108 0.108 0.188 0.162 0.169\n\n0.462 0.205 0.212 0.564 0.545 0.333\n\n0.235 0.178 0.177 0.273 0.245 0.253\n\nage have the lowest similarity indices, and the faunas that are coeval have the highest similarity indices, despite the fact that Seymour Island and McMurdo Sound geographically are the most widely separated faunas. This similarity presumably reﬂects the gradual Antarctica-wide evolution of the marine molluscan fauna as a result of origination, extinction, migration, and temperature and other ecological changes. The fauna evolved from a more generalised, post-KT boundary, eurythermal southern hemisphere fauna (Stilwell, 2003a) through the climatic optimum of the late Paleocene–Early Eocene Thermal Maximum, the subsequent cooling through the late Middle and Late Eocene, and the probable Oligocene commencement of Antarctic glaciation, to the present-day offshore, cold-adapted fauna. 9. Disappearance of the near-shore “antiglacial” fauna: an index of glaciation 9.1. “Antiglacial” Mollusca Lipps and Hickman (1982) and Chapelle and Peck (1999, 2004) recognised a set of morphological characteristics evolved by Antarctic and deep-sea faunas as a response to resource limitation: gigantism, dwarﬁng, and a variety of bizarre constructions. The constructions include appendage elongation, by some deep-sea pycnogonids and Antarctic isopods, and extreme ﬂattening, by some Antarctic isopods. The ﬁrst obvious point about the Antarctic Paleogene molluscan faunas considered here, therefore, is that there is no evidence of these morphological characteristics. They are “normal” molluscan faunas, morphologically, with more diverse large molluscs but few of the taxa of large, thin-shelled molluscs (such as Laternula and Adamussium) that characterise the present Antarctic fauna. The resource limitations of the present Antarctic fauna evidently had not yet made themselves felt by Eocene time. However, both Laternula and Adamussium are recorded earliest in the Oligocene fauna of King George Island, shortly after Antarctic glaciation seems to have commenced. Of course, the great longevity of La Meseta Formation Cucullaea specimens (over 100 years; Buick and Ivany, 2004) demonstrates that a different set of resource limitations prevailed during the early Cenozoic temperate period of polar winter darkness. Several other changes between Eocene time and now are visible in the molluscan fauna. One of the most obvious types of macrofaunal change in Antarctica since the deposition of La Meseta Formation has been the extinction or great reduction of some groups of shallowwater taxa that remain diverse in the rest of the world. The obvious explanation for the extinction of these groups in the Antarctic region is the disappearance of sandy beaches, rocky shores, and normal shallow offshore soft substrates from Antarctica with the development of a signiﬁcant ice cover. Berkman et al. (1998, p. 345) pointed out that “most of the Antarctic coastline is occupied by ice shelves, ice streams, ice walls, and outlet glaciers”; only 5% of the present coastline is ice-free, almost all of it around the Antarctic Peninsula. Rocky shores and soft shoreface environments immediately offshore from sandy beaches are not accessible to biota. Taxa that inhabit these environments therefore are unable physically to occupy Antarctic shores at present. Pugh and Davenport (1997) pointed out the effects of ice scour on intertidal communities, and Barnes (2005) pointed out the erasure of intertidal zonation. The southernmost normal, intertidally zoned shores at present are found along the southern coast of Tierra del Fuego. Smale (2007, 2008a,b) and Smale et al. (2007a,b) also described the effects of ice scour on Antarctic communities, pointing out the great variation from site to site and the patchiness, rather than zonation, induced by scour. The presence of ice mainly affects the obvious, macroscopic biota. This was emphasised by Waller's (2008) description of the cryptic biota and zonation of crevices in a latitudinal gradient from the Falkland Islands and the Scotia Arc to the Antarctic Peninsula, where cryptic and encrusting biota survive despite the ice cover. This intertidal microbiota is irrelevant, however, to the\n\nA.G. Beu / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 284 (2009) 191–226\n\nAntarctic fossil record, in which the biota described by Waller (2008) is not preserved or has not been sampled adequately, apparently because of its delicacy and small size. The recorded fossil faunas of Antarctica consist only of the obvious macroscopic biota. The main macroscopic, preservable molluscan groups that occur as fossils in Antarctic Paleogene faunas and would have been affected by this major ecological change, the inaccessibility of intertidal and shallow subtidal shores to habitation by macrobiota, are: 1. Mactridae; almost all members live infaunally in the shoreface off sandy beaches, or in even shallower environments in more sheltered estuaries. Mulinia, which is recognised here in La Meseta Formation, is a diverse and widespread South American genus of abundant near-shore to estuarine mactrids at present, living as far south as Tierra del Fuego. 2. The larger intertidal and shallow subtidal Veneridae; again, many members are infaunal sandy beach inhabitants although, as this is a much more diverse family than Mactridae, they occupy a correspondingly greater range of habitats. It is clear, however, that intertidal sandy beaches and embayments where such heavyshelled, commarginally sculptured venerids as Retrotapes could live are not accessible to biota around Antarctica at present. Again, though, this genus is abundant around southern South America at present, at least as far south as the Beagle Channel in southern Tierra del Fuego. 3. The larger, byssally attached Mytilidae that live epifaunally on exposed rocky shores, or in the subtidal zone of rocky shores, just below the low tide line, are surprisingly diverse in La Meseta Formation: Arcuatula, Brachidontes, Modiolus, Mytilosootus, Mytilus?, and Perna?. However, all these are absent from Oligocene and younger rocks. These large taxa are distinct from small, softsubstrate taxa such as Dacrydium, which live well offshore and are still found around Antarctica. 4. Oysters (Ostreidae and Gryphaeidae) have disappeared completely from Antarctica (Clarke and Crame, 1989, p. 264) despite being reasonably common fossils during Paleocene–Eocene time. Sadler (1988) described the abundant large oysters, up to 20 cm long, attached to basement in the base of Telm 1 of La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island. 5. The thick-shelled, shallow-water Trochidae and Turbinidae. These are the classical epifaunal rocky shore gastropods, grazing algal ﬁlms and diatoms from rocks and the larger algae in the intertidal and shallow subtidal zones. Almost all the trochids and the one turbinid from Seymour Island fall into this group. The trochid fauna has an almost completely different taxonomic composition from that of Antarctica today, where the diverse trochids are a very different guild of deep-water, relatively thin-shelled, soft-bottom inhabitants, such as Antimargarita, Calliotropis, Submargarita, and Bathybembix (Dell, 1990). Stilwell (2005a) described the ﬁrst Calliotropis species from La Meseta Formation, the one trochoidean genus in common with the Recent Antarctic fauna. 6. The group of genera affected by the environmental turnover possibly includes some of the Cerithioidea, the larger members of which are mostly shallow-water to estuarine “mud-creepers” at present, e.g., Bittium and Cerithidea. However, most of these are too uncertainly identiﬁed to be useful. 7. Another family possibly affected by this environmental turnover is the Pectinidae, which comprised six or more taxa in the King George Island fauna, but now consists of only the one extremely abundant, very thin-shelled “red scallop”, Adamussium colbecki (Smith, 1902). Factors that might have brought about a lessening of scallop diversity are the resource limitations pointed out by Lipps and Hickman (1982) as, like almost all other bivalves, Pectinidae are ﬁlter-feeders; cooling temperatures; the lack of shallow, shoreface environments, particularly those of low turbidity favoured by scallops; and the present high diversity and abundance\n\n203\n\nof Antarctic predatory starﬁsh. A factor leading to the thin shell and weak sculpture of early Adamussium species was possibly the need to swim rapidly away from durophagous ﬁsh. The decrease in diversity and abundance of crabs and ﬁsh from Antarctica with decreasing temperature during Telm 6 (Middle Eocene), corresponding to a decrease in defensive architecture of shells and the occurrence of unusual concentrations of ophiuroids and crinoids (Aronson et al., 1997, 2007; Aronson and Blake, 2001; Ivany et al., 2004) would have acted in the opposite sense and substituted the predation pressure on scallops exerted by ﬁsh and crabs with that exerted by starﬁsh. Starﬁsh pull scallop shells apart, so radial ribs are helpful to strengthen the shell. The development of radial ribs by Adamussium during Miocene time (Jonkers, 2003) possibly correlates, then, with starﬁsh becoming more signiﬁcant predators than crabs and ﬁsh at that time. 8. Other taxa that no longer live around Antarctica but still live commonly in shallow water around southernmost South America, and so probably provide another component of the ice-free index fauna, are shallow-water Volutidae such as Palaeomelon, Adelomelon and Odontocymbiola. Dell (1990, pp. 212–221) reviewed volutes from the Antarctic region, recording three Miomelon species and two Tractolira species on the southern Patagonian shelf to the islands of the Scotia Arc, all in depths greater than 150 m. The only truly Antarctic volute at present is Harpovoluta charcoti (Lamy, 1910) (see Numanami, 1996, p. 195, ﬁg. 134A–F), again occurring offshore (recorded from 73–1469 m), in this case all around Antarctica. However, this highly distinctive species has a smooth, strongly inﬂated exterior and no columellar plaits, and is very different from the narrow, sculptured shells with two columellar plaits recorded as fossils from Seymour Island. Leal and Harasewych (2005) have added Tractolira delli, from off Victoria Land, East Antarctica, again from deep water (1772–3596 m). Ríos et al. (2005, table 2) recorded the shallow-water South American volute Adelomelon ancilla (Lightfoot, 1786) living as far south as the Straits of Magellan, along with typically Antarctic taxa such as Limopsis marionensis and Yoldia (Aequiyoldia) eightsii (Couthouy in Jay, 1839) and typically southern Patagonian taxa such as Trophon geversianus (Pallas, 1774), Aulacomya atra (Molina, 1782), Leionucula grayi (d'Orbigny, 1846), and Zygochlamys patagonica (King and Broderip, 1832). Arntz et al. (2005) also reported that in general, the northern arm of the Scotia Arc has a Magellanic biota, with many similarities to that of southern South America, whereas the southern arm has an Antarctic biota. These distributions imply that the biological boundary between Antarctica and South America is gradational, and such shallow-water volutes as Adelomelon, with no dispersive larval stage, had only a short distance to migrate to inhabit the Antarctic Peninsula. 9. Other taxa whose absence from the younger fossil faunas and the Neogene–Recent fauna of Antarctica might well be due to the same environmental change are Glycymerididae, Crassatellidae, Tellinidae, Panopea, Pholadidae, Turritellidae, and Calyptraeidae. The few possible Littorinidae recorded here also are almost certainly members of this group, as they are limited now to exposed hard substrates above high tide, another environment that has vanished from Antarctica.(one species each tentatively assigned to Littorina in the Seymour Island Paleocene and Eocene faunas and a possible Bembicium or, more likely, Peasiella species in the McMurdo Sound erratics). The same comments apply equally to limpets but, as none of these is certainly identiﬁable even to family, they are impossible to interpret. In the presence of mactrids and a tellinid, large shallow-water venerids, diverse large mytilids, oysters, a few possible littorinids and limpets, and several shallow-water trochids and volutes, the fauna of La Meseta Formation more closely resembles the southern temperate faunas than it does the present Antarctic fauna. These faunas live at\n\n204\n\nA.G. Beu / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 284 (2009) 191–226\n\npresent around New Zealand, southern Australia, southern South America and southern Africa. The disappearance of this “antiglacial” intertidal and shallow subtidal fauna appears to offer a useful index of the timing and extent of Antarctic glaciation. Its disappearance also left the genera that still inhabit the Antarctic–subantarctic regions as the dominant faunal element in Oligocene and younger rocks. The Paleocene and Eocene molluscan faunas analysed here are largely composed of present-day Antarctic genera plus these shallow-water taxa that now are unable physically to inhabit Antarctica, together with a number of cosmopolitan taxa and characteristic early Cenozoic taxa that have since become extinct throughout most of the world. It is possible that some groups that are common in temperate and tropical areas remain absent from the polar regions for ecological reasons. It would be possible to interpret the fauna of the polar regions as a result of the lack of sufﬁcient time having elapsed for some groups, such as heterodont bivalves, to have evolved the necessary adaptations to life in high latitudes. As a consequence, other groups such as neogastropod predators of heterodonts might not have been able to inhabit these areas. Conditions have, of course, always been strongly seasonal in the polar regions. With the onset of coastal glaciation, marine near-shore seasonality would have become even more marked than previously, with very low productivity during the combined cold and darkness of winter making it impossible for many groups to inhabit the polar regions. Nevertheless, the fossil record clearly demonstrates that the numerous “antiglacial” taxa listed above previously inhabited both the northern Antarctic Peninsula and the Ross Sea region during Eocene time. Winter darkness is a constant, so the onset of low temperatures and, more speciﬁcally, glacial ice seems to be the only possible changing ecological factor explaining the disappearance of the “antiglacial” taxa. The disappearance of these taxa possibly was caused by two factors. The physical presence of coastal ice affected at least the larger, obvious, fossilisable intertidal and shallow subtidal biota. The lowered productivity possibly affected shallow continental shelf taxa as well, such as heterodont bivalves, volutes and Conoidea. 9.2. Nautiloids Another faunal element in the La Meseta Formation that indicates an equable climate quite far from ice is the nautiloids (Zinsmeister, 1978, 1985; Dzik and Gaździcki, 2001). Scattered specimens of Euciphoceras and Aturia are reported from a few horizons, and Cimomia cf. C. imperialis (Sowerby and Sowerby, 1812) occurs in Telm 1. The surprising occurrence is of common Euciphoceras argentinae (Del Valle et al., 1976), a species described from Telm 2 or the base of Telm 3. Dzik and Gaździcki (2001, p. 301) reported this species to be common (26 specimens seen), particularly in “the Cucullaea beds” of Telms 2 and 3 (Early Eocene). A further ﬁve specimens were collected higher in Telm 3, three from Telm 4, and one from Telm 5. Dzik and Gaździcki (2001) pointed out that the diversity is similar to that in the Eocene London Clay of England, and surprisingly high for an Antarctic locality. Zinsmeister (1985) also reported 25 specimens of Aturia, the rarer La Meseta Formation nautiloid, from the site where the terrestrial marsupial Antarctodolops was collected. This apparently represents a single beaching event of drifted and mostly juvenile shells. The distribution and taxonomy of living Nautilus species were summarised by Ward (2008). Nautilus is entirely tropical at present, in the central western Paciﬁc. However, empty shells drift a long way from living sites and, e.g., cast ashore rarely in northernmost New Zealand (34°S), 1300 km straight-line distance southeast of the nearest living specimens, off the central Great Barrier Reef and in New Caledonia. Hamada (1964, 1965) also described the post-mortem drift of Nautilus shells from Indonesia and the Philippines to Thailand and the southern half of Honshu, Japan, a distance of at least 2000 km. However, these specimens and those found on northern New Zealand beaches are rare, adult, severely damaged, and encrusted with epi-\n\nfauna including bryozoans, barnacles, polychaete tubes, oysters and other bivalves. In contrast, the well-preserved and, in many cases, juvenile specimens in La Meseta Formation imply at most short postmortem drift for the La Meseta specimens. Chirat (2000) emphasised port-mortem drift as the explanation of the wide distribution of Aturia, which he suggested mostly lived along the two coasts of the Americas, and drifted to the rest of the world. However, the common, wellpreserved, and in many cases juvenile Aturia specimens at several Australian and New Zealand Miocene localities up until Messinian time (Beu, 1973) make such a restricted distribution unlikely. Aturia probably occupied tropical regions widely for much of Paleogene–Miocene time, particularly the central Indo-West Paciﬁc province, where Nautilus occurs now. Dzik and Gaździcki (2001) concluded that nautiloids lived near enough to Antarctica for empty shells to ﬂoat there in large numbers. The abundance of specimens in Telms 2 and 3 indicates that nautiloids were probably living closer than 500 km away during Early Eocene time, around southern Tierra del Fuego. A decrease in faunal diversity after Telm 6 probably identiﬁes a marked cooling when nautiloids became extinct in the region. 9.3. Initiation of glaciation The total “antiglacial” molluscan fauna, including nautiloids, indicates that there were no glaciers or ice-sheets on the Antarctic Peninsula during Eocene time, at least near the coast, when La Meseta Formation was being deposited. However, this single window on the Antarctic fauna of the time cannot rule out the possibility of ice being present elsewhere on Antarctica. Of course, the absence of ice at this time has already been concluded from other abundant evidence (Shackleton and Kennett, 1975; Kennett, 1977; Leg 119 shipboard scientiﬁc party, 1988; de Robin, 1988; Mackensen and Ehrmann, 1992; Dingle et al., 1998; Barker, 2001; Roberts et al., 2003; DeConto and Pollard, 2003a,b). It has usually been accepted that extensive ice sheets developed on East Antarctica after the opening of the Tasmanian gateway and, probably, the Drake Passage gateway at around 34– 33 Ma and possibly even as early as 41 Ma (e.g., Barrett, 1996; Lear et al., 2000; Barker, 2001; Lawver and Gahagan, 2003; Livermore et al., 2004; Coxall et al., 2005; Scher and Martin, 2006; Siegert et al., 2008). However, they did not develop on West Antarctica until after about 17–15 Ma (de Robin, 1988; Flower and Kennett, 1995; Billups and Schrag, 2002; Shevenell et al., 2004; Barrett, 2007). The East Antarctic ice sheet also increased in size during the Middle Miocene (Hall et al., 2003). However, more recent evidence has questioned this relatively simple model, and the possibility of minor glaciation on parts of Antarctica from early Middle Eocene time on now seems realistic (Miller et al., 1991; Wise et al., 1992; Ivany et al., 2004; Triparti et al., 2005). Lazarus et al. (2008) reported opaline microfossil evidence for Antarctic glaciation and for cooling in the Southern Ocean c. 2 m. yrs before the Eocene–Oligocene boundary. Ivany et al. (2006) also provided evidence of an ice sheet on the Antarctic Peninsula, West Antarctica, during Oligocene time, revealed by c. 7 m of diamictite and pebbly mudstone, dated by dinoﬂagellates, overlying the youngest strata of the La Meseta Formation (Late Eocene) on Seymour Island, although the dinoﬂagellates possibly were reworked into younger rocks (Alistair Crame, BAS, pers. comm. October 2008). There is also little doubt now that the East Antarctic ice sheet ﬂuctuated signiﬁcantly throughout the period from 33–15 Ma, or perhaps a little later (Zachos et al., 1997, 2001; Naish et al., 2001; Pekar and DeConto, 2006; Barrett, 2007). Naish et al. (2007) summarised the results of the Andrill1B core (McMurdo Sound, East Antarctica) as revealing a cold polar climate and ice sheet during early Late Miocene time (c. 13–10 Ma), a warmer climate with polythermic ice late in Late Miocene time (9–6 Ma), a relatively warm climate with interglacials dominated by pelagic diatomite during Pliocene time (c. 5–2 Ma), and the present cold polar climate and ice sheet, with rocks dominated by diamictite, during Pleistocene time (c. 1–0 Ma).\n\nA.G.

The geometry of the stratiﬁed units of La Meseta Formations was described by Sadler (1988), who established numbered units (Telms 1–7) separated by unconformities. Marenssi et al. (1998) divided the 720 m-thick formation into six named members, again separated by unconformities, with similar boundaries to the Telms, but these have been adopted by only a few recent authors. Judging from Sadler (1988), ages provided by Wrenn and Hart (1988) and, in particular, strontium isotope stratigraphy (Dingle and Lavelle, 1998; Dutton et al., 2002, ﬁgs. 5, 7; Ivany et al., 2008), the lowest units, Telms 1–4 (55.5–51.5 Ma) and most of Telm 5 are Early Eocene to earliest Middle Eocene in age. The uppermost part of Telm 5 (51.5–47.5 Ma) and Telms 6 and the lower part of 7 (43–37 Ma) are Middle Eocene, including a hiatus between Telms 5 and 6 (47.5–43 Ma). The upper part of Telm 7 is Late Eocene (37– 33.5 Ma). Ebridian, silicoﬂagellate and dinoﬂagellate biostratigraphy of the McMurdo Sound erratic boulders indicates a late Middle to Late Eocene age for most lithologies (Bohaty and Harwood, 2000; Levy and Harwood, 2000), so they have an age range equivalent to La Meseta Formation above the major Middle Eocene hiatus. A convenient table showing the occurrences of molluscan taxa in La Meseta Formation Telms was provided by Stilwell and Zinsmeister (1992, table 1). Fig. 5 shows the numbers of “antiglacial” molluscan species recorded from Telms 1–7 by Stilwell and Zinsmeister (1992), table 1). It should be noted that Telm 1 has been added into Fig. 5 by guesswork, to show the number of taxa recorded from it; its limited extent and impoverished fauna did not allow Ivany et al. (2008) to sample it for dating. A maximum during Telm 5 and the slightly rightskewed normal (Gaussian) distribution of occurrences (apart from Telm 4) are obvious conclusions from the histogram, suggesting at least partial control of diversity by water temperature. However, the paucity of records from Telm 1 and the series of Cucullaea shell banks making up Telm 4 shows that the distribution of taxa reﬂects depositional environments as much as temperature, and the histogram cannot be interpreted as a temperature graph. Oysters, although stated by Sadler (1988) to be large, abundant, and partly attached to basement in Telm 1, in fact occur throughout La Meseta Formation, apart from Telm 4. Large Mytilidae occur in Telms 2, 3 and 5–7. The large cardiids Lahillia and Nymphactra occur in Telms 2, 3, 5 and 6. Mactridae occur in Telms 2–6 (not including Nymphactra; see Appendix B,\n\nFig. 5. Histogram of numbers of “antiglacial” molluscan species (listed in Ostreidae, Mytilidae, Lahilliidae, Mactridae, Veneridae, Trochidae, Volutidae and Turridae) recorded from La Meseta Formations Telms by Stilwell and Zinsmeister (1992, table 1). Ages of Telms from Ivany et al. (2008, ﬁg. 8); Eocene subdivisions from Berggren et al. (1995).\n\n205\n\nnote 42). Some large venerids, including Retrotapes species, occur in all Telms, although Eumarcia and Atamarcia are limited to Telm 5. “Calliostoma” monile, tentatively referred here to Littorina (sensu lato), occurs in Telm 5. The other taxa referred to Trochidae and Turbinidae occur in Telms 2, 5 and 6. Volutidae occur in Telms 2–6. Large Conoidea occur in all units other than Telm 1. Although the largest number of “antiglacial” taxa occurs in Telm 5 (late Early to earliest Middle Eocene), some occur in all Telms, with the lowest numbers in Telms 1 (earliest Eocene) and 7 (late Middle to Late Eocene), apart from the minimum in Telm 4 caused by its general low diversity. These faunas, therefore, indicate that ice was absent near the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula throughout the deposition of La Meseta Formation, i.e., throughout Eocene time (c. 55.5–33.7 Ma; Ivany et al. 2008, ﬁg. 8). The decrease in biodiversity after the markedly warm period of Telms 2–6 is signiﬁcant, and apparently resulted from cooling near the Antarctic Peninsula after mid-Middle Eocene time (Ivany et al., 2008, ﬁg. 9). Of course, it is also now recognised (Ivany et al., 2006) that diamictite and pebbly mudstone dated as Oligocene overlie Telm 7, suggesting that glaciation commenced not long after deposition of La Meseta Formation ceased. The marked global cooling at the Eocene–Oligocene boundary was of the order of 5 °C (Liu et al., 2009). A signiﬁcant observation about Fig. 5 is that Telms represent rather regularly increasing periods upwards through the section. Apart from the major hiatus between Telms 5 and 6, the breaks between Telms possibly represent eustatic low-stands. The break between Telms 5 and 6 lasted for c. 5.5 m. yrs, and presumably was caused by either a local tectonic event or a major period of erosion. However, not only did cycles occupy long periods, at least 1 m. yrs, but also the relative lengths of periods is the opposite of what would be expected if Antarctic glaciation was least at the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum and increased to a level where it became visible in the sedimentary and paleontological record at the Eocene–Oligocene boundary. The rather regularly increasing intervals between unconformities indicate that they result from local tectonism. Scher and Martin (2006) recently concluded that Drake Passage possibly was open enough for Antarctic Circumpolar Current ﬂow to commence by approximately 41 Ma. They pointed to earlier estimates that it opened as early as 49 Ma, markedly earlier than the opening of the Tasmanian gateway. Similarity of timing suggests the possibility that the major unconformity in the La Meseta Formation records an erosion period resulting from initiation of ﬂow through Drake Passage, and perhaps initiation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, during c. 47.5–43 Ma. 9.5. The accompanying ﬂora The large gymnosperm log fragments identiﬁed by Brea (1998) as Cupressinoxylon and Podocarpoxylon occurring in Telm 5 also indicate that glaciation had not yet reached Seymour Island at that time. They are up to c. 0.5 m long and 0.5 m in diameter, assuming the ice-axe handle is about 1 m long (Stilwell and Zinsmeister, 1992, ﬁg. 49, 50; Ivany et al., 2008, ﬁg. 2). However, their teredinid borings indicate that the logs ﬂoated in seawater to the deposition site. Case (1988) also reported excellently preserved fossil leaves of Nothofagus and ferns from a Paleocene locality in Sobral Formation and two Eocene horizons within La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island (in Telms 1– 2, Early Eocene, and Telms 4–5, late Early to earliest Middle Eocene). This establishes the lack of an ice sheet extending to sea-level. Doktor et al. (1996) recorded further plant taxa. Gandolfo et al. (1998) also reported leaves of Nothofagaceae, Dilleniaceae, Myricaceae, Myrtaceae, Lauraceae and other unidentiﬁed dicotyledonous angiosperms from La Meseta Formation, indicating a temperate to cool temperate, seasonally moist climate. However, Pole et al. (2000, p. 249) reidentiﬁed many of the earlier-recorded leaves as Nothofagus, including Case's (1988) ferns and all taxa recorded by Doktor et al. (1996). Presumably extensive glaciation was not possible at the time this ﬂora lived nearby. However, valley glaciers extending to sea level through\n\n206\n\nA.G. Beu / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 284 (2009) 191–226\n\nNothofagus forest at higher altitudes and lowland mixed conifer– broadleaf forest would have been possible on the basis of the ﬂora, as this occurs now in southwestern parts of both New Zealand and Chile. A similar, though sparser, wood and leaf ﬂora is recorded from the Eocene glacial erratics of McMurdo Sound (Pole et al., 2000; Francis, 2000). It consists largely of several taxa of Nothofagus, but also Araucaria and wood of Phyllocladus- or Dacrydium-like gymnosperms. These are accompanied by a pseudodontorn bird (Jones, 2000) and a single crocodilian tooth (Willis and Stilwell, 2000), again good evidence that any coeval ice was a considerable distance away. 9.6. Oligocene/Early Miocene “antiglacial” molluscs Despite its low diversity, and 59% of the identiﬁed genera still occurring in the Antarctic–subantarctic region, the fauna of King George Island also includes diverse Retrotapes species, large conoideans, and shallow-water volutes. This, again, provides a deﬁnite indication that sandy beaches or shallow subtidal sand areas were still available for molluscs to inhabit from time to time. The molluscs suggest that, although glaciation was strongly developed on inland areas in the region around King George Island and the northern Antarctic Peninsula during Oligocene and earliest Miocene time, coastal areas were not so strongly affected. Glacial diamictite has been described at many Oligocene–Early Miocene localities on King George Island and the lithology of Polonez Cove Formation routinely is described as “glaciomarine” (e.g., Birkenmajer, 1985; Birkenmajer and Gaździcki, 1986, p. 224; Porebski and Gradzinski, 1987; Troedson and Riding, 2002; Troedson and Smellie, 2002). Evidently the fossils inhabited a marginally glaciomarine environment, possibly similar to that of the Beagle Channel in southernmost Tierra del Fuego at present or, further south, the marginally habitable shores of South Georgia. It seems likely that possible Oligocene glaciation of the Antarctic Peninsula was not accompanied by permanent ice sheets, particularly on offshore islands such as King George Island, until later in Early or Middle Miocene time. Unfortunately, the great sparseness of the later Antarctic fossil record, itself presumably a result of glaciation, means that this molluscan index of glaciation has no later tie-points for estimating the timing of glacier development and the proximity of glaciers to the coast, although there is now little doubt that glaciation was well under way by early Oligocene time. 10. Antarctica as a biogeographical source The ﬁnal point considered here is the notion of Antarctica as a signiﬁcant biogeographical provenance area — the concept that southern high-latitude marine faunas, at least early in Cenozoic time, were a signiﬁcant source of evolutionary novelties, providing genera that later spread more widely through the world ocean. This process has been labelled “high latitude heterochroneity” (e.g., Zinsmeister and Feldmann, 1984; Wilson and Feldmann, 1986; Wiedman et al., 1988; Feldmann and Tshudy, 1989, p. 193; Clarke and Crame, 1989, p. 259; Stilwell and Zinsmeister, 1992; Crame, 1986, 1996, pp. 127– 128). This is such a diametrically opposed concept to the more familiar one of molluscan taxa mainly evolving in and spreading from the tropics (e.g., Jablonski, 1993; Jablonski et al., 2006; Martin et al., 2007; Valentine et al., 2008) that it deserves reconsideration. The main way in which this mechanism has been envisaged as operating has been by the evolution of southern cold-water taxa (represented particularly by the fossils in La Meseta Formation) in shallow water, and their subsequent tracking of isotherms northwards, to appear in deeperwater faunas in middle and low latitudes at a later time. This hypothesis has been promoted particularly clearly by Watling and Thurston (1989). However, the fossil record seems to me to offer little support for it. The only examples I am aware of among Antarctic Paleogene molluscs whose distribution might be explained in this way are the\n\nbivalves Gaimardia and Atamarcia. Both might well have other, equally plausible explanations. Gaimardia still occurs only in the southern high-latitude fauna of the subantarctic and marginally Antarctic region, and might well have had a long history throughout this region (see Appendix B, note 40, for dismissal of a possible Paris Basin Eocene species). Seymour Island provides the only diverse, shallow-water Paleogene fossil record of the southern high-latitude shallow-water fauna documented to date, so there is no way of knowing how diverse and widespread this genus was in the past. Obviously, Gaimardia has sp"
