K. DELL\n\nI. INTRODUCTION The writer has twice previously prepared short reviews of Antarctic marine biology. The first (Dell, 1952) was written during what can now be recognized as an interregnum between two major periods of biological endeavour in the Antarctic. The main line of British oceanographic interest had already turned to other fields and active biological investigation by the Discovery Investigations had in fact ceased. The great international assault on the Antarctic stimulated by the International Geophysical Year (IGY) was about to commence. The second review (Dell, 1965) was written when it was still too soon to assess what biological results had in fact been achieved. For various reasons, there is often a significant time lag between biological field work and the publication of results. I n 1964 many of the biological results that had been achieved had not been published and even some that had been published had not reached the Southern Hemisphere. I n the last few years publication has begun to catch up, and a wealth of material is becoming available. The year 1965 did not seem to be a very propitious period in which to assess progress. The present period may be little better, but at least it is now obvious that no time in the immediate future will provide the kind of hiatus during which reviews seem best attempted. Major papers on Antarctic marine biology will be appearing regularly over the next decade. The writer has kept files on Antarctic biology for many years. A major review of literature in preparation for this contribution was carried out throughout 1970 and the major part was written during the first half of 1971. It has not proved possible to set an absolute deadline beyond which reference to material could not be included. All literature which has been received in New Zealand up to the beginning of May 1971 has been included. Because of postal inconsistencies there will undoubtedly be anomalies in the treatment of literature produced during the last six months. The aim has been to give some account of the work carried out to date on Antarctic benthic plants and animals. The area included in the Antarctic has been very definitely circumscribed to cover the Antarctic region defined herein as the shores of the Antarctic Continent, the South Shetlands, South Orkneys, the South Sandwich Islands and South Georgia together with Bouvet Island. The Subantarctic has been excluded, and such islands as Kerguelen, Heard and Macquarie have been considered basically Subantarctic. Consideration of Subantarctic biology raises many other problems since the biota cannot be so readily circumscribed, and involves much closer relationships with associated\n\nANTAROTIO BENTHOS\n\n3\n\nregions such as South America, New Zealand and Australia. It surely warrants treatment as a unit on its own. At the same time the approach to the Antarctic Region has been essentially faunal and the extensions of the Antarctic fauna have been traced whenever necessary. Some authors have not made a clear distinction between Antarctic and Subantarctic, and in reviewing their results the geographical scope may have been extended. Parasitic forms have not been treated in detail unless the occurrences are of biogeographical interest.\n\n11. THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT I n complete contrast to Arctic conditions, Antarctica consists of a large land mass invested with ice sheets of varying thickness, and surrounded by a great body of water, the Southern Ocean (Herdman et d , 1966). Extending southwards into the Southern Ocean towards Antarctica are three spearheads of land, each a potential pathway whereby organisms living on the shelves associated with three major landmasses could disperse, or have dispersed, southwards. From South America, the Scotia Arc with its surface features of the Falklands, South Georgia, the South Sandwich and South Orkney Islands and the South Shetlands, curves towards the most northerly extension of the Antarctic Continent, the Antarctic Peninsula. New Zealand and Australia provide a more fragmented pathway from Asia through the Indo-Malayan Archipelago. South Africa stops at a greater distance from the Antarctic Continent but provides shallow water contacts northwards into the Indian Ocean on one coast and into the Atlantic on the other. Deeper water organisms are brought closer into contact with Antarctic waters, the Southern Ocean being but a continuation of the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans. There is no shortage of potential migration routes through which biogeographers can derive the Antarctio biota, or through which it may be considered to disperse. The biogeographer must try to deduce the routes that have actually been used by the plants and animals concerned. There have been many recent general accounts of the physical oceanography of Antarctic and Subantarctic waters, some with a biological slant, (Deacon, 1937, 1960; Mackintosh, 1946, 1960; Knox, 1960 ; Ostapoff, 1965 ; Brodie, 1965 ; El-Sayed, 1968). The biological significance of the water current patterns in the Antarctic has been discussed by El-Sayed (1968) based on Deacon (1937). The surface manifestations of Antarctic Surface Water near the continent surrounded by a belt of Subantarctic Surface Water separated\n\n4\n\nR. K. DELL\n\nby the Antarctic Convergence result from a pattern of subsurface water movement. Mainly because of the westerly wind, the surface waters of the Southern Ocean move in an easterly direction to form the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Cold sea water originating along the edge of the Continent is cold and dense and sinks to move towards the north as Antarctic Bottom Water. Some of the Antarctic Surface Water has a northerly component which sinks to an intermediate level at the Antarctic Convergence to form Subantarctic Intermediate Water. Highly saline deep waters from the north, rich in nutrients, move southwards at intermediate levels to replace the northward moving waters mentioned above, to rise close to the surface near the Continent. This injection of nutrient salts in the Antarctic, together with the effect of sunlight for 24 h of the day in southern summer results in an extremely high period of summer productivity. In marked contrast to other areas the supply of nutrient salts from this source is so great that productivity is probably never limited from a lack of nutrients in the Antarctic. There is of course a marked contrast in productivity between summer and winter. The results as recorded by a human diver working throughout the year have been vividly expressed by Peckham (1964). During the winter the absence of phytoplankton meant that the sea water was exceptionally clear. A small lighted torch bulb was still visible to a depth of almost 100 m. The first sunlight in September allowed exceptionally clear observation but by mid-summer the heavy phytoplankton growth often cut visibility to less than 10 ft. The unique contribution of Antarctic waters in this respect can better be appreciated by the objective estimation (El-Sayed, 1968) that the waters south of the Antarctic Convergence (about 5% of the oceans of the world) support a total production equivalent to about 20% of that produced by all the oceans of the world. This abundance of phytoplankton provides an almost unlimited source of food, directly or indirectly, to the benthos. The fact that i t is seasonal imposes physiological rhythms which have as yet been investigated in only a relatively few organisms. The continental shelf around Antarctica is narrow everywhere except in the two embayments of the Ross and Weddell Seas (Brodie, 1965). As Brodie has noted the sudden change in slope which marks the outer limit of the shelf and the beginning of the continental slope is much deeper than the 150 m or so that is commonly found elsewhere. Around the Antarctic Continent the change in slope may occur at depths between 400 and 600 m, and in the Ross Sea it occurs at nearly 800 m. In most areas the continental slope descends without any very complicated bottom features to depths of about 3 000 m. Three areas of\n\nANTARCTIC BENTHOS\n\n5\n\ncomplex topography mentioned by Brodie occur off the Antarctic Peninsula, forming the southern limb of the Scotia Ridge, off the Balleney Islands-Scott Island area, and in 70°E,in the form of the Kerguelen Ridge. Outside the continental slope the sea floor extends as broad ridges or deep basins. Essentially three main basins are involved, an Atlantic-Indian-Antarctic Basin, an Eastern Indian-Antarctic Basin, and a Pacific-Antarctic Basin. All three basins are cut off to one extent or another to the north by major ridges arranged more or less in a circumpolar fashion, whose crests lie in depths of less than 3 000 m. Andriashev (1965) has described the peculiar nature of the Antarctic continental shelf, commenting on the \" sunken \" nature with an edge a t 400-500 m or more, and the presence within the shelf limits of \" innershelf depressions \" and narrow trenches which may reach depths of 1 000 m or more. The bottom sediments in Antarctic seas are influenced primarily by the fact that practically all the effective transport of terrigenous material is by ice, The effect of glacial deposits carried by ice will extend to the northern limit of pack ice, although the intensity of effect must diminish from the continental boundaries outwards. Glacial sediments do dominate almost to the limits of pack ice. This is not a uniform sediment, ranging as it does from fine muds to large boulders. There are areas such as those in which thick belts of sedentary organisms occur where sedimentation for one reason or another must be minimal, and others such as deposits of barnacle plates (Bullivant, 1967) where the fine sediments appear to be swept away by bottom currents. A t its northern boundary the glacial deposit gives way to a zone of diatom ooze, some 1 000-2 000 km wide. Diatoms occur plentifully enough to the south but the amount of terrigenous material available effectively masks the deposit. The northern limits of the zone of diatom ooze extends somewhat north of the Antarctic Convergence where diatom production is replaced by Foraminifera and Globigerina ooze takes over. Within the zone of Diatom ooze there can be extensive areas influenced by local volcanic action.\n\nA . The Antarctic biological region For those who like order in all things, it is unfortunate that the Antarctic Continent cannot be confined within the Antarctic Circle instead of buIging inconsiderately beyond i t in several areas, and extending the Antarctic Peninsula well beyond it to about 63\"s. Some of the benthic organisms of the Southern Ocean live in close association\n\n6\n\nB. K. DELL\n\nwith this continent, some in the ocean basins around its periphery. It is probable that this latter group is better considered in relation to world abyssal faunas, rather than as part of a specific Antarctic fauna. Such evidence as is available points in this direction. The Antarctic Circle is a geographical abstraction, not a biological boundary, even for terrestrial organisms. The coastal area of the Antarctic Continent itself proves to be an equally unsatisfactory boundary for a specific Antarctic benthic biota. The islands of the South Shetlands are so closely associated with the Antarctic Peninsula geographically and faunally that these must be included. However, a large part of the plants and animals living within this area is not confined to it but extends to varying degrees, particularly through the islands of the Scotia Arc. The one physical boundary which has proved a particularly useful biological boundary especially for the organisms living in the surface waters of the Southern Ocean has been the Antarctic Convergence. The position of the Convergence fluctuates throughout the year, and from year to year, but this creates no major problems in delineating the distribution of planktonic organisms and for those animals dependent upon the plankton. The literature on the relationship of plankton to the waters on both sides of the Antarctic Convergence is considerable and has a vast literature of its own. A recent summary is that of Mackintosh (1960). Many of the attempts to delimit the Antarctic Region seem to be based upon the wrong criteria. I n a biogeographical discussion, the evidence for subdivision should be essentially faunal. The primary task should be to determine what the animals do, and where they occur, rather than how well they conform to some stated scheme, however logical this may be. Kusakin (1968, p. 355) criticizes rather scathingly “ the excessively pedantic utilization of the zonal-geographical method at the expense of the faunistic (or floristic) method ”. In considering the benthos, there seems no reason why the Antarctic Convergence should be a benthic boundary except in a very indirect way. I n group after group the Antarctic fauna, or appreciable elements of it, extends along the island groups of the Scotia Arc as far as South Georgia. But most of the evidence we have is for the narrow continental shelf and the continental slope and the shelves and slopes around the islands. Except in the region of the Scotia Arc, the Antarctic shelf fauna cannot extend as far north as the Antarctic Convergence. The distinction is well shown in Hedgpeth (1969a, p. 6, Fig. 10)where the area within the Antarctic Convergence (i.e. the “Antarctic Region ”) is far greater in extent than the ‘‘ Continental Subregion ”. The abyssal faunas of the\n\nANTARCTIO BENTHOS\n\n7\n\nvarious deep-water basins which intrude inside the boundary of the Antarctic Convergence will surely extend south of the Convergence. Cailleux (1961) in a discussion of endemism in the Antarctic, and after analysing a long series of systematic works concluded that a majority of authors included the South Shetlands, South Orkneys and South Sandwich Islands in the Antarctic, and that Bouvet Island was usualIy included. For the majority of groups South Georgia and Shag Rocks presented a faunal mixture of Magellanic and Antarctic forms together with a group of endemics. Cailleux pointed out, a fact all too often forgotten, that the degree of endemism of the Antarctic fauna depends very greatly on whether South Georgian species are included in or excluded from, the Antarctic Region. This problem will be discussed more fully in a discussion on endemism later in this contribution. Following what seems to be a consensus of modern opinion the Antarctic benthic region is accepted for purposes of the present work as extending to South Georgia. On the little evidence available Bouvet Island is also included. However, Heard, Macquarie and Kerguelen Islands which fall within or straddle the Convergence, are considered on the faunal evidence to be essentially Subantarctic, although some elements of the Antarctic fauna reach these islands.\n\nB. Terminology It is impossible not to touch on some matters of terminology. The whole question of the nomenclature for basic divisions in the southern regions is gradually becoming more confused. Hydrological usage has been based upon the characteristics of the water masses extending in concentric belts from the Antarctic Continent. The Antarctic water closest to the Continent separated from the next water mass, Subantarctic water, by the Antarctic Convergence, the Subantarctic water separated in turn by a Subtropical Convergence from Subtropical. There may well be anomalies in this usage but it has served southern hydrographers well and several generations of southern biologists have been trained in the basic patterns and used them to interpret plant and animal distribution patterns. Biologists cannot complain if growth in oceanographic knowledge demands a change in these basic concepts, and perhaps we must learn to accept the “Antarctic polar front )’in place of the “Antarctic Convergence )’, and the presence of the Subantarctic Divergence between the Antarctic Convergence and the Subtropical Convergence. It is to be hoped that physical oceanographers will remember that many other scientists wish to use their results and refrain from changes in nomen-\n\n8\n\nR. K. DELL\n\nclature solely for the sake of semantics. Biogeography has already bedevilled itself in the search for better words, rather than better concepts. The term “ Subantarctic ” was apparently introduced by plant geographers around the turn of the century and soon came into common use in a collective geographical use, as in Chilton (1909). It was also taken over by hydrologists. The terms Antarctic and Subantarctic have been in common usage in discussions of southern biogeography for many years. Ekman (1935), in his classic book on marine zoogeography, and perhaps with more effect in the English (1953) translation, advocated a usage corresponding to that in the Northern Hemisphere, and coined the term “Antiboreal ” to replace “ Subantarctic ”. Oceanographers have not used Ekman’s proposed “Antiboreal Convergence ” to replace the “ Subtropical Convergence ”, and the term Antiboreal has gained little acceptance. Several Soviet authors have used the term “ notal ” (Vinogradova, 1962; Andriashev, 1965) instead of “ Subantarctic ” for the area between the Convergences. Hedgpeth (1970) has been rather scathing about the term “ notal ” and such derivatives as “ notalian ”. Knox (1960) influenced no doubt by the general title of the symposium to which he was contributing, used the term “ cold-temperate ” and sometimes “ Subantarctic cold-temperate ” for Subantarctic surface water. There does not really seem to be a case for uniform practice in naming major northern and southern zones, particularly in relation to marine biogeography. Southern Hemisphere conditions are not the same as comparable latitudinal zones in the Northern Hemisphere, and the basic difference between the relationships of water to land masses in the two polar areas precludes any chance of fruitful close comparison. Workers in the Northern Hemisphere, who are the main critics of “ Subantarctic ” and the main protagonists for uniform nomenclature between the hemispheres, might first consider that while the parallel of 55”s cuts through Tierra del Fuego and that there are no permanently inhabited areas south of this (much less cities), the parallel of 55”N leaves the northern tip of Ireland and the cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Copenhagen and Moscow somewhat to the north, with Oslo, Stockholm and Helsinki well to the north. Human habitation patterns are very different in the two hemispheres, are not most other factors also different? Hedgpeth (1969) came out very strongly in favour of the terms “Antarctic ” and “ Subantarctic ”, as would many marine biologists, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. The whole matter seems to be causing fresh discussion at present between workers concerned with terrestrial biogeography who find a need to subdivide “ Subantarctic ”\n\nANTARUTIC BENTHOS\n\n9\n\nIslands into two different categories. Whatever decision is reached in this field, marine biologists will probably continue using “ Subantarctic ” as long as hydrographers retain the term. C . Subdivisions of the Antarctic Region Some of the problems encountered in attempting to limit the Antarctic Region, also make subdivisions of the Region difficult. A number of schemes have been proposed. Regan (1914b),discussing the distribution of Antarctic fishes, separated coastal from oceanic fishes. It is in fact difficult to separate benthic fishes sharply from other forms, since many of them have larval stages which are pelagic and many of the adult species which would normally be considered as benthic have been taken quite frequently in mid-water. Considering coastal fishes alone Regan postulated three zones : 1. South Temperate Zone ; 2. Subantarctic Zone ; 3. Antarctic Zone with two districts, Glacial and Kerguelen.\n\nRegan’s Antarctic Zone included, “ t h e coast of the Antarctic continent and the islands that lie south of the isotherm of 6OC, with the probable exception of Macquarie Island ”. The Glacial District comprised the coast of the Antarctic Continent and all the adjacent islands lying within the extreme limit of the pack ice, including South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands and probably Bouvet Island. He believed that any subdivision of the Glacial District was premature. The Kerguelen District included Kerguelen and Heard Islands, the Crozets, Marion and Prince Edward Islands. Regan (1914) was followed with approval by Norman (1938) when he argued that the fish fauna of Kerguelen-Macquarie was so different from that of the Patagonian Region and “ the Antipodes ” that i t ahould be included in the Antarctic Zone as a separate district. Waite (1916) combined Regan’s classification with a geographical one and divided the whole southern ocean into four quadrants : 1. Australian Zonal Quadrant (Victoria Quadrant) ; 2. Pacific Zonal Quadrant (Ross Quadrant) ; 3. American Zonal Quadrant (Weddell Quadrant) ; 4. African Zonal Quadrant (Enderby Quadrant).\n\nThe resultant Quadrant-Zone-District classification, although based upon logical 90’ divisions, had of course no biological significance. The\n\n10\n\nR. K. DELL\n\nfact that one boundary cuts the Ross Sea shows the difficulty of using such a scheme. At the same time a number of workers trying to record and analyse the distribution of organisms around the Antarctic Continent have used this scheme or a modification of it to codify their distributional data. Ekman (1935, 1953) largely on the basis of surface water temperatures subdivided the Antarctic Region into \" High Antarctic \" and \" Low Antarctic \". Hedgpeth (1970) has pointed out that Ekman used the terms \" region '' and \" province \" almost interchangeably in the English translation (1953). Norman (1938), again considering fishes utilized Regan's scheme, together with the Quadrants. He did not believe that the evidence allowed any subdivision of the Glacial District. Nybelin (1947) working also with fishes subdivided the Antarctic Zone as follows : 1. High Antarctic Region, the coasts of the Antarctic Continent and associated islands. A. East Antarctic Subregion. B. West Antarctic Subregion. 2. Low Antarctic Region, South Georgia and Shag Rocks. He showed that the South Sandwich Islands and Bouvet were both related to the West Antarctic Subregion and to the Low Antarctic Region, with an additional independent character. The subdivision into East and West Antarctica, commonly used by geologists is an extremely useful subdivision particularly if used in a non-committal sense. The longitude of Greenwich and the equivalent line of 180' divides Antarctica unequally into two sections, the western section largely taken up with the Weddell and Bellingshausen Seas and the Antarctic Peninsula which together with the islands of the Scotia Arc has its own biogeographic features. The boundaries should not be taken too precisely because once again 180' longitude bisects the Ross Sea (which surely belongs faunally to East Antarctica). The fauna off the coast of Marie Byrd Land and the Amundsen Sea is so poorly known that it can serve at present as a no-mans-land type of boundary. Similarly the fauna from the eastern shores of the Weddell Sea and off Crown Princess Martha Land is hardly known. The term West Antarctica is a very useful one in a strictly geographical sense as a kind of shorthand for, \" the Weddell and Bellingshausen Seas, together with the Antarctic Peninsula and the associated islands of the Scotia Arc \". It is in this sense, and with the boundaries purposely left indefinite that the term \" West Antarctica \" is used throughout the present work.\n\nANTAEUTM BENTHOS\n\n11\n\nPowell (1951), considering molluscs particularly, discussed some of the history of subdivision into biogeographic zones, and used the term “ province ’) for the units. He considered it undesirable to formulate a comprehensive scheme. He did, however, nominate a Georgian Province for the South Georgia-Shag Rocks area. I n later work (1965) he did not modify this scheme in relation to the Antarctic. Knox (1960) proposed a subdivision of the Antarctic Province into Rossian and Scotian Subprovinces with a distinct South Georgian Province. The Rossian Subprovince comprised Victoria Land and the Ross Sea area of East Antarctica. The evidence for his separate rank for the Rossian Subprovince was the lack of many Magellanic species, the fact that the algae Ascoseira mirabilis and Cytosphaera jaquinotii had not been recorded, and the distinct Australasian affinities shown by the occurrence of algae such as Gigartinu apoda. The Scotian Subprovince comprised Graham Land, the South Shetlands, South Orkney and South Sandwich Islands. The South Georgian Province was based largely on algal evidence, quoted from Skottsberg (1941), which allied South Georgia to the Falklands. The only zoological evidence quoted was Powell’s (1951) statement that the molluscan fauna of South Georgia is distinctive with little in common with that of the Falklands. Knox therefore considered that South Georgia is best considered transitional between the Antarctic and Subantarctic cold temperate. Knox’s treatment shows the difficulties in applying the concept of biological provinces in general, and in reference to the Antarctic, especially widely separated island groups in particular. He, himself, (Knox, 1960, p. 611) was quite clear that he was discussing a subdivision for the littoral zones of the Antarctic and southern temperateregions. Other workers using his scheme subsequently have not always realized this limitation. Kusakin (1967) commented on the difficulties in comparing Subantarctic and Antarctic faunas as follows : “An important failing in ow analysis (of which we are well aware) is that we examine entirely different fauna, namely, littoral, sublittoral, pseudo-abyssal and bathyal. However, this is at present unavoidable . . . although it is certain that the boundaries of the biogeographical zones for all these zones do not and usually should not coincide ”. It is unfortunate that all workers on marine biogeography do not see the issues so clearly. He also comments on the difficulty of comparing the faunas of the Antarctic and of other areas because of the absence of littoral isopods on Antarctio shores, and because the shelf fauna which elsewhere occurs down to depths of 150-200 in, here descends to between 400 and 700 m. Unfortunately Knox does not always seem to realize that the only littoral evidence that would be available for the Antarctic Region would\n\n12\n\nR. K. DELL\n\nbe confhed to the islands of the Scotia Arc and part of the Antarctic Peninsula, there being no littoral to speak of exposed in the rest of the Antarctic Continent (what little there is will be highly specialized and largely confined to a crevice biota). This is not quite so vital in regard to the algae, but some of the animals cited as characteristic of the Antarctic Province are unfortunately chosen, to say the least. Even Powell’s remarks on the molluscan fauna of South Georgia, and cited by Knox, refer to the fauna as a whole, deep-water forms as well as littoral species. Andriashev (1965) discussed Nybelin’s scheme and although allowing that more recent work has borne out the distinctions between East and West Antarctica, and that these are significant and at present inexplicable, does not believe that the distinction between the High and Low Antarctic Regions can be maintained. South Georgia has some elements of endemism and some negative features and thus merits some degree of biogeographic subdivision, but not at the level of a separate Region or Subregion. Andriashev attempted a synthesis of previous work in the light of the additional distributional evidence available. The following were included in Andriashev’s Glacial Subregion of the Antarctic Region. 1. Continental Province (= High Antarctic Region of Nybelin). Includes the South Shetland and South Orkney Islands. A. East Antarctic District. B. West Antarctic District. 2. South Georgia Province\n\nThe Kerguelen Subregion included Marion, the Crozets, Kerguelen, Heard and Macquarie Islands. Andriashev’s description, “ They have an impoverished, mosaic fauna of an insular type with a considerable percentage of local endemism ”, seems to sum up the situation of this area very aptly. Kusakin (1967) working with isopods proposed divisions essentially similar to those of Andriashev except for different usages of category names, i.e. ‘‘ subregions ” and “ provinces ”. The evidence available to him forced a subdivision of the Antarctic Continent into Pacific Ocean (or Ross) and Indian (or Davis) districts. Kusakin also restricted West Antarctica to Graham Land together with the South Shetland and South Orkney Islands. In his figure showing his proposed Antarctic biogeographical divisions Kusakin includes sections of the Weddell and Bellingshausen Seas so that his view of East Antarctica is essentially identical with that used by the writer in the present work. Kott (1969a, p. 194) adopts a classification based upon a study of\n\nANTARCTIC BENTHOS\n\n13\n\nascidian distribution which is essentially the same as that put forward by Knox (1960). 1. Antarctic Subregion\n\nA. Continental Province (Antarctic Peninsula to Weddell Sea). B. South Georgian Province (Bellingshausen Sea, Antarctic Peninsula to South Georgia). 2. Subantarctic Subregion\n\nA. Magellanic Province (South Georgia to Patagonian Shelf). B. Kerguelen Province. C Antipodean Province. This scheme is a little uncertain in its application since the Antarctic Peninsula occurs in two provinces, as does South Georgia. Kott is obviously uncertain of the correct location for South Georgia. To name a province \" South Georgia \" and then t o exclude South Georgia from it perhaps indicates that the provincial concept can cause difficulties in itself. Hedgpeth (1969) proposed a broad scheme as a synthesis of divergent views. This accepted a Subantarctic and an Antarctic Region. The Antarctic Region essentially fitted within the Antarctic Convergence except where the Kerguelen Subregion of the Subantarctic cuts across its northern boundary. The Subantarctic Region covers the southern portion of the area covered by Subantarctic Surface Water. The Antarctic Subregion was divided into a Continental (or High Antarctic) Subregion (or Province) with two extensions, and a Scotia Subregion with South Georgia separated as a distinct District (Fig. 1). The writer has discussed the validity of the concept of marine provinces (Dell, 1962), has argued against fine distinctions in the Antarctic Region at our present stage of knowledge (Dell, 1965) and has shown the Wculties of fitting isolated islands such as Macquarie into a provincial pattern. He has also (Dell, 1956) shown that in New Zealand the distribution of the archibenthal molluscan fauna (200-600 m) bears little relationship to the distribution patterns developed on the shelf. I n spite of the number of workers who have discussed marine provinces, there are remarkably few definitions of a province, and most definitions that have been put forward are expressed in very general terms. A major factor in limiting a province must be a barrier which will act on all organisms in a similar way causing a large number of geographic ranges to cease at about the same point. With marine organisms such a barrier will need to be a wide deep-water gap, sudden marked changes in temperature or an extensive land mass.\n\n14\n\nR. K. DELL\n\nFIQ.1. Biogeographio divisions as used in the present work (adapted from Hedgpeth, l909),showing essentially the three oonoentrio zones of the High Antarotio Region, the Antarotio Region (essentially referring to plankton) and the Subantarotio Region. 1. Megellado; 2. Tristen de Cunha; 3. Kerguelenian; 4. Continental Antarotio; 5. South Ueorgien Distriot.\n\nIt is difficult enough to define provinces for one group of plants or animals. To find common provincial boundaries for many different groups of animals has not proved an easy task. Since littoral distribution patterns may not correspond with those on the shelf or in deeper\n\nANTARUTIU BlDNTHOS\n\n16\n\nwater, the term \" province \" will probably always require qualification in some way. The terms \" littoral algal province \", or \" shelf molluscan province \" may have some relevance, but a \" Rossian marine province \" can only be the result of the sum of many compromises, and thus have little real meaning. The compilation of detailed geographical and bathymetrical ranges is of far more value for studies on distribution, than discussions about systems of provinces. There is evidence that discussing distribution in terms of provinces leads biologists into fundamental errors of outlook. There is always a tendency to consider that the fauna of a province is uniformly distributed throughout an area, or that the province has some objective validity of its own. It is often claimed that additional records for the distribution of a species shows that it has extended its range to an additional province. Isolated areas such as South Georgia, or Kerguelen or Macquarie Island are always difficult to fit into a provincial concept. For example the statement that a species occurs in the Kerguelenian Province does not tell the reader very much. It may occur on Kerguelen, or on Macquarie or on both. It may also occur in the Ross Sea or on South Georgia. A more useful piece of knowledge would be that the species has been recorded from off Kerguelen in depths from 10 to 76 m and in the Ross Sea in 300 m. The kind of information we do require for biogeographical discussions is the type of detailed distribution records presented for the marine algae by Papenfuss (1964) and for ascidians by Kott (1969). Even in groups such as these the distributional evidence available to us still indicates the areas in which the major expeditions have worked rather than the actual distribution of the organisms concerned. The study of actual distribution patterns seems a far more useful biological exercise than division of an area into provinces, districts, regions or zones, and into subdivisions of these with groupings into hierarchies of relationship. This method of approach seems doubly necessary in areas where there is obviously a dynamic ebb and flow of species in several directions as there undoubtedly is through the islands of the Scotia Arc. The major part of the shelf fauna of the Antarctic seems effectively cut off from the rest of the world by the major barrier of the Southern Ocean. The one area where the barrier starts to break down is the Antarctic Peninsula and the associated sections of the Continent. The stepping stones of the islands and island shelves of the Scotia Arc here supply a pathway between the Antarctic and South America which different organisms have used to varying degrees. It is precisely in this area that most discussion about faunal subdivisions occurs, where the boundaries proposed by previous workers are shifted and where\n\n16\n\nR . K . DELL\n\nproblems of definition are more difficult. Here especially a study of the dynamics of biological migration will surely prove more fruitful than the static studies which working within a provincial concept often engender.\n\nD. Endemism Most systematists dealing with Antarctic organisms are interested in the degree of endemism. Some few have been strong minded enough not t o calculate the percentage, or at least not to publish the results. Most of us, while admitting the incomplete data with which we work, persuade ourselves to carry out the exercise and publish the results. The degree of endemism is of course of special interest for the Antarctic since it is one of the few \" objective \" measures we have for the degree to which the Antarctic fauna and flora has been isolated, and thus a measure of the age of the biota. As such these calculations are beloved by biogeographers. One biogeographer has recently assembled a long list of the endemism percentages (Cailleux, 1961) given by authors for Antarctic plants and animals, recent and fossil, marine, freshwater and terrestrial. A somewhat modified extract from this list as it relates to Antarctic benthic organisms is given in Table I. There are now more up to date figures for some of these groups, but Cailleux had demonstrated that taking the figures given by subsequent workers for any one group may have changed the actual figures but the general order of magnitude remains roughly the same. Some successive percentages for a few groups illustrate this point (Cailleux, 1961). Sponges Pycnogonids Ascidians Marine isopods\n\n42 84 57 45\n\n44 80\n\n67 80\n\n67% 91%\n\na4y0 78%\n\nThe general high percentages listed by Cailleux ranging from 31 to 96% for a large number of animal groups bears striking testimony to the independent character of the Antarctic fauna. Cailleux even gave mean values for marine organisms (67%), terrestrial organisms (57y0), marine fossils (60%) and terrestrial fossils (62%). Whatever precise value such calculations may have, the figures are remarkably consistent and they are remarkably high. It is hard to escape the belief, when considering degrees of endemism of this magnitude, that the biota of the Antarctic has been isolated for a long time. Whatever the history of the presence of a modern migration route in the form of the Scotia Arc, two conclusions seem inevitable:\n\n17\n\nANTARCTIO BENTHOS\n\nTABLEI Group Littoral fishes Ascidians Holothurians (littoral) Holothurians (abyssal) Echinoidea Echinoidea, Ophiuroidea, Asteroidea (littoral) Echinoidea, Ophiuroidea, Asteroidea (abyssal) Ophiuroidea Asteroidea Crinoidea Pycnogonida Isopoda Mollusca Gastropoda Bryozoa Bryozoa, Stenolemata Nemertea Polychaetes Actiniaxia and Zoantharia Actiniaria Scleractinian Corals Octocorals Hydroids Hexactinellid sponges Sponges (Calcarea) Sponges Phaeophyceae Rhodophyta\n\nAuthor Regan Norman Hartmeyer Vaney Vaney Mortenseri Koehler Koehler Hertz Fisher John Hodgson Richardson Lamy Strebel Rogick Hastings Borg Joubin Ehlers Carlgren Pax wells Molander Billard Schulze Bronsted Burton Skottsberg Kylin\n\n(yo) Number of species listed Endemic 49 54 44 39 18 27\n\n96 90 84 85 67 82\n\n106\n\n77\n\n52 89 52 16 77 49 30\n\n75 76 69 76 91 78 64 73 89 84 42 84 31 87 86 60 66 55 77 73 67 46 30\n\n26\n\n36 37 24 19 36 16 22 10 16 37 26 52 200 13 20\n\n(1) plants and animals of the southern hemisphere have their dispersal effectively stopped by water temperatures below O'C, and (2) plants and animals adapted t o Antarctic water temperatures, on the whole, cannot efficiently migrate into warmer water.\n\nCailleux raised one extremely important point in relation t o the degree of endemism especially when considering the odd situation demonstrated by the biota of South Georgia. It is obvious, when one has had the point demonstrated, that if one includes the total fauna of\n\n18\n\nR. K. DELG\n\nSouth Georgia in the Antarctic region, one must include a large number of Magellanic and Subantarctic species which k d their southern limit in South Georgia. If one uses such a list to calculate the percentage of endemism, the total number of Antarctic species becomes unbalanced. On the other hand if South Georgia is rigorously excluded from the Antarctic, then many species cannot be claimed to be Antarctic endemics. Cailleux solves his immediate problem for his analysis by excluding the northern species which also occur in South Georgia from his calculations, and by classing as endemic to the Antarctic those species which also occur in South Georgia. South Georgia is perhaps the most difficult problem in analysing the relationships of Antarctic fauna, but it really only points the self evident fact that the percentage of endemic forms will alter with the boundary accepted for any particular region. The percentage of endemism found in any particular square kilometre will be O%, the percentage for the whole world must be 100% (Cailleux, 1961). 111. HISTORY OF BENTHIU INVESTIGATIONS An extremely large number of expeditions of one sort or another have visited Antarctica. Roberts (1958) has provided a magnificent source of information in listing them up to the beginning of the International Geophysical Year in July 1957. The earliest beginnings of human intrusion into Antarctic waters are poorly documented and will probably never be better known. Proper documentation really begins in the 1770s when the fringes of Antarctica began to be explored as part of the general exploration of the Southern Hemisphere and the southern Indo-Pacific in particular. Two French expeditions skirted the Subantarctic with Kerguelen-Tremarec (1 77 1-72) discovering Kerguelen Island, and Marion-Dufresne (1771-72) Prince Edward Islands and Iles Crozets. The Antarctic Circle was f2st crossed by literate man on 17 January 1773 in about longitude 39\"E by the two vessels, Adventure and Resolution on the second voyage of Captain James Cook. The circle was crossed several more times on this expedition which reached 7lo10'S, charting South Georgia and discovering the South Sandwich Group. The results of Cook's voyage were largely geographical in relation to the Antarctic, although observations were carried out on birds. Certainly no benthic Antarctic animals were recorded. Following accounts of Cook's discoveries British sealers began to exploit seals at South Georgia in 1778, to be followed rapidly by American interests. As seals of one species or another were decimated in one area, operations were extended from the Falklands to South Georgia,\n\nANTILBUTIU BENTHOS\n\n19\n\nthe South Orkneys and the South Shetlands. The position of all the major Subantarctic and Antarctic island groups were largely determined or confkmed during this period of intensive sealing activity around the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries. I n 1821 Palmer sighted the Antarctic Peninsula (Graham Land, or the Palmer Archipelago). British sealers, particularly James Weddell and the vessels of the Enderby company carried out much useful geographical work on the American sector and later in the New Zealand and Australian Subantarctic islands. Many of the geographical results of these excursions were at first kept as tight commercial secrets but eventually appeared on charts, available to all. But very little biological knowledge resulted from all these traffickings, except as they related to the body of lore on seals, whales and penguins which were utilized commercially, or to the other obvious birds of the area. The first government sponsored United StatesAntarctic exploring expedition was under the command of Benjamin Pendleton, but with other ships commanded by Nathaniel B. Palmer and Alexander S. Palmer, one or other vessel of which visited the South Shetlands in JanuaryFebruary 1830. The expedition was accompanied by several independent investigators, one of whom was Dr James G. Eights, who collected shells andcrustacea. One of the shells was described by J a y (1839), from a Couthouy manuscript, as Nucula eightsi (now Aequiyoldia eightsi). Eights himself published several papers describing other animals from the South Shetlands, most of which have proved to be important Antarctic species. The first in 1833 described Brongiartia trilobitoides (now Serolis trilobitoides according t o Sheppard, 1933). I n another paper Eights (1852) described the giant isopod, Glyptonotus antarcticus, whose important ecological position around Antarctic coasts is only slowly being realized. Perhaps the most interesting of these finds was the ten-legged pycnogonid, Decobpoda australis (Eights, 1835). At the time the very idea of a ten-legged pycnogonid seemed a contradiction in terms, and Eights’ description was largely ignored, when it was not tacitly considered to be an error of observation. Hodgson, on Scott’s first expedition was to collect a very different pycnogonid with five pairs of legs from the Ross Sea, and the following year (1905) recognized Dewbpoda austraZis among material collected by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition. Eights remarkable pycnogonid thus had to wait for 70 years before it was recognized again and made respectable. Calman (1937) gave an interesting account of Eights’ career as far as known and reproduced the original figures of Decolopoda, Glyptonotus and Serolis. Eights died in obscurity. It is perhaps fitting that this first naturalist to describe some of the charac-\n\n20\n\nR. E. DELL\n\nteristic Antarctic benthic animals should now have a United States base in Ellsworth Land bearing his name. Bellingshausen's fine Russian expedition ( 1819-21) circumnavigated the Antarctic Continent, but again the major discoveries were geographical and because the account of the expedition appeared in Russian the results were slow in percolating through to the rest of the world. During the years 1839 and 1840 three different national expeditions were in the Antarctic, and although they all had great potential for collecting biological material, and although they all produced reports on biological material, collected mostly outside the Antarctic, none of them seems to have contributed significantly to our knowledge of the Antarctic benthos. Dumont D'Urville (1837-40) with the two corvettes Astrolabe and La Z&e operated south of Cape Horn in 1838, and surveyed the South Orkneys, the South Shetland5 and parts of the Antarctic Peninsula. Bate (1862) described three species of amphipods collected at the South Orkneys by La ZdZde. In 1840 D'Urville discovered Adelie Land and was off the Wilkes Coast just a few hours after Charles Wilkes of the United States Exploring Expedition. The United States Exploring Expedition under Charles Wilkes ( 1838-42) with five ships again carried out geographical investigations over a wide area of the Antarctic. Extensive biological results were produced based on the collections made in the tropical Pacific and in the Subantarctic but again no marine benthic animals appear to have been recorded from the Antarctic. Sir James Clark Ross (1839-41) with the Erebus and Terror especially equipped for magnetic observations, circumnavigated the Antarctic Continent. His ships broke through the pack ice of the Ross Sea, thus opening a gate through which many subsequent expeditions were to work their way south to the Ross Sea and the Continent. Ross made many geographical discoveries and confirmed the positions of many other features. Thanks t o the presence on board of the botanist, J. D. Hooker, this expedition laid the major framework for all subsequent work on southern floras, particularly of the Subantarctic Islands. Contributions to knowledge of Antarctic benthos appear to have been rather minimal. Had the animals collected been recorded in a single publication, the results of the Antarctic work might have had more impact. It is, however, extremely difficult to track down papers based on collections from the Erebus and Terror. Ross (1847, vol. 1, p. 199) recorded that near 72'87'5, 176'6% on 18 January 1841 from 230 fm, \" Small stones and shells, with some pieces of coral and a crustaceous animal (Nymphn gracile), common in\n\n21\n\nANTARCTIC BENTHOS\n\nthe Arctic Seas, came up with the lead ”. Later (1847, vol. 1, p. 201) Ross recorded the result of a dredge haul in 270 fm at 72”31’S, 173”39’E. Besides a large block of granite and many stones, beautiful specimens of living coral and other animals were obtained. “ Corallines, Flustrae, and a variety of marine invertebrate animals, also came up in the net, showing an abundance and great variety of animal life. Among them I detected two species of Pycnogonum ; Idotea Baffini, hitherto considered peculiar to the Arctic Seas ; a chiton, seven or eight bivalves and univalves, an unknown species of Gammarus, and two kinds of Serpula, adhering to the pebbles and shells ”. In an appendix to Ross’s work Charles Stokes (1847) described and indicated several new species of “ corals )’, Hornera lateralis (Bryozoa), Retepora cellulosa (Bryozoa), Primnoa Rossii (Alcyonaria),Melitoea australis and MadreporaJissurata. It was stated that drawings of these new forms would appear in the Zoology of the voyage but only descriptions of vertebrate animals appear to have been published in the official results of the Expedition, and Stoke’s names seem to have been largely ignored. Ross’s account seems to be the first account of a collection with a dredge in Antarctic waters. Hooker (1845) contributed a slightly different account of the same collecting episode, but was mainly concerned to show that life existed at depths greater than 300 fm. Baird (1865, 1870) described some polychaetes from this material, e.g. Terebella Jlabetlum, T. bilineata, Eunice narconi and 8erpula narconensis. Carter (1872) described two new species of sponges from material in the British Museum collected from 300 to 206 fm respectively. Ehrenberg (1844) recorded some foraminiferans from the Ross Sea material. Bate (1862) described two amphipods from expedition material collected from Hermite Island, off Tierra del Fuego. Other forms have probably been described by various workers. The ones outlined above are the only papers to come to the writer’s attention. There was then a long hiatus period in biological activity in the Antarctic, to be broken by the H.M.S. Challenger (1872-76). The magnificent set of volumes recording the biological results of this expedition described many southern high latitude animals from the plankton and from the benthos especially in the vicinity of Kerguelen, Prince Edward Islands, the Crozets and Heard Island. The Challenger penetrated to 66’40’5 in latitude 7S022’E, the first steam vessel to cross the Antarctic Circle. The appearance of the biological results of the Challenger Expedition mark the end of a period of biological exploration that can rate as little more than preliminary skirmishing with the problem. Many Antarctic benthic animals were described as a result of the Challenger’s investigations but these were mostly species which also occurred in the\n\n. .-\n\nA. M B I0\n\na\n\n22\n\nk. K. DELL\n\nSubantarctic. Up to this period there were extremely few records of Antarctic benthic animals as such. The Challenger collected benthic animals at three stations south of SO'S, i.e. at Station 152 at 60'52's in 1 260 fm (2 304 m), obtaining an ophiuroid, holothurians, an isopod, a macruran, a gastropod and one fish ;Station 153 a t 65'42'5 in 1 675 fm ( 3 063 m) and Station 156 at 62'26's in 1 975 fm (3 611 m). At both these latter stations a range of benthic animals was collected. These stations are all, however, at abyssal depths and hardly warrant consideration as Antarctic animals. Apart from the German International Polar Year Expedition (1882-83) which wintered at South Georgia, it was not until the closing years of the nineteenth century that the first real collections of Antarctic bottom animals were made. The first two decades of the twentieth century were to see a great flood of expeditions, many of them with biological programmes. One problem in writing a consecutive account of investigations into the Antarctic fauna arises from the fact that dates of publication of scientific results may bear little relation to the date of the expedition. The earlier expeditions did not amass very large collections and their biological reports running to a single volume or at most a very few volumes could be brought out quickly after the close of the expedition. Those expeditions which concentrated upon biological work and which obtained large collections could no longer hope for such rapid publication. Thus the biological results of the British-Australian-New Zealand Expedition (B.A.N.Z.A.R.E.), which was in the field from 1929 to 1931, are still appearing moderately regularly. The Belgian Antarctic Expedition under Adrien de Gerlache de Gomery in the Belgica (1897-99) appears to be the first expedition to sample the Antarctic benthos proper, working around the South Shetlands, the Antarctic Peninsula and the Bellingshausen Sea. And now the flood gate was open. The 1898-1900 British expedition under Borchgrevink in the Xouthern Cross besides being the f i s t scientific expedition purposely to winter on the Antarctic continent, collected marine animals from the Ross Sea, publishing the results in a single volume. The German Antarctic Expedition (1901-03) under Drygalski in the Gauss made large collections especially from the Gauss Winter Station in the Davis Sea. The Swedish South Polar Expedition (190104) under Nordenskjold maintained a comprehensive biological programme at South Georgia and off the Antarctic Peninsula. Some collections were lost when the Antarctic was crushed in the pack. The British National Antarctic Expedition (1901-04) under Captain Scott in the Discovery collected extensively in the Ross Sea. The\n\nANTARUTIU BENTHOS\n\n23\n\nreports laid the basis for an understanding of the marine animals of the Ross Sea. The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition under W.S. Bruce in the Scotia carried out the first oceanographic exploration of the Weddell Sea, and also collected benthic animals from the South Orkneys and the Palklands. Bibliographically the reports can cause confusion since most were published first in Scottish scientific journals, before being republished later as expedition reports with changed pagination. The French Antarctic Expedition under Charcot in the B a n p i s carried out an extensive biological programme off the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, working its way to within sight of Alexander Island. The British Antarctic Expedition under Shackleton in the Nimrod wintered at Cape Royds in the Ross Sea. An attempt was made to publish a series of scientific results but government support was lacking and publication lapsed. Papers by Hedley (1911) on molluscs, Waite (1911) on fishes and by Koehler (1911) on echinoderms were the major ones to appear on benthic animals. A useful list of scientific results from this and subsequent Shackleton expeditions was published by J. M. W(ordie) and B. B. R(oberts) (1943). The Second French Antarctic Expedition again under Charcot was carried out in what was surely the most suitably named vessel for any expedition, the Pourquoi Pas? The biological programme was again concentrated along the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula and through the Bellingshausen Sea to within sight of Peter I Island. The British Antarctic Expedition (1910-13) under Scott in the Terra Nova was to end in heroic tragedy. Biologically it proved very productive and the series of reports added significantly to knowledge of the benthos of the Ross Sea. The Australasian Antarctic Expedition (1911-14) under Mawson in the Aurora was to be the last in this spate of Antarctic endeavour. The biological results have been amongst the most fruitful of any of the early expeditions although some were not published until much later. The onset of World War I and its depressing aftermath drew a blackout curtain across the Antarctic, at least in respect of the major expeditions required to obtain marine biological results. When the curtain lifted it was to usher on to the Antarctic scene a completely new era of biological investigation. From 1925 until at least 1939 biological work in the Antarctic was dominated by the activities of the Discovery Investigations. Hardy (1967) in his book Great Waters, possibly the best semi-popular account of a large scale expedition and the work of marine biologists, traces the\n\n24\n\nR. I(. DELL\n\nhistory of the Discovery Investigations and supplies a most useful contents list to the 34 volumes of Discovery Reports (some 13 000 pages of scientific reports). Previous biological efforts in the Antarctic had all been based upon short term expeditions. The Discovery Committee planned its work as a continuing investigation. Early work was concentrated on major whaling areas such as South Georgia but the work was slowly extended to embrace the whole of the Antarctic ocean. The old R.R.S. Discovery, and R.R.S. Discovery 11 and R.R.S. William Scoresby achieved an enviable record of scientific work between 1925 and 1937. I n 1949 The Discovery Investigations were taken over by the National Institute of Oceanography. Discovery 11 made one more extensive Antarctic cruise in 1950-51 to give a tally of a quarter of a century of active investigation into Antarctic marine biology. However, the collections are by no means fully described and new Discovery Reports appear year by year. The Discovery Investigations were initiated in order to understand the biology of the commercial whales in the Southern Ocean. It is understandable, therefore, that physical oceanography and the world of plankton should be the fields to attract most attention. In fact in spite of the great extent of the Discovery Reports, a relatively small amount has so far been published on the benthos as such. In the meantime several other expeditions had entered the field. The Norwegian Antarctic Expedition (1927-28) under Haakon Mosby on the Norvegia visited Bouvet Island, South Georgia, the South Shetland5 and the Antarctic Peninsula, and in 1928-29 landed on Peter I Island. Three volumes of scientific results have been published, interesting because a number of authors considered biogeographical problems in detail and attempted to review the state of knowledge in their groups. Holtedahl (1935) gave a brief account of these rather complicated expeditions, of which results were still appearing in 1961. A small German expedition under L. Kohl-Larsen collected in South Georgia in 1928-29. Between 1929 and 1931, the British Australian, New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (B.A.N.Z.A.R.E.) under Mawson in the Discovery carried out a most productive biological programme which has added appreciably to our knowledge of the benthos in Antarctic waters between about 45°C and 130\"E. This ship Discovery was a veteran of Antarctic exploration, having been built especially for Scott's 1901-03 expedition, and later, having initiated the work of the Discovery Committee, became the base for the B.A.N.Z.A.R. Expedition. This is the vessel which, moored on the River Thames in London, now serves as a memorial to Captain Scott. Ten volumes of\n\nANTAROTI0 BENTHOS\n\n26\n\nbiological results have so far appeared from this expedition. A very useful summary by Johnston (1937) gives an account of the biological organisation of this expedition together with a station list. The British Graham Land Expedition (1934-37) carried out an extensive biological programme, though little relating to marine biology has yet been published. The onset of World War I1 did not effectively close down all Antarctic activity. The United States Antarctic Service Expedition (1939-41) established two bases, one at Marguerite Bay, Antarctic Peninsula and the other in the Ross Sea. Biological results were not extensive. The period 1940-45 saw the development of almost comic opera moves and countermoves as British and Argentinean parties sought to establish their own claims to the islands of the Scotia Arc and to the Antarctic Peninsula. Science often suffers from political comic opera but in this case science gained through the establishment of occupied bases and the maintenance of scientific programmes. The British endeavour was mounted under the code name of \" Operation Tabarin \". Most of the biology was terrestrially oriented and few of the marine collections obtained have been written up separately. From 1947 onwards Argentinean and Chilean claims were consolidated by annual expeditions matched by similar activities on the part of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey by the United Kingdom. The United States Navy mounted operation \" Highjump \" in 1946-47 and this was followed by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition (1947-48). I n 1947-48 the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition was inaugurated. Little marine biology was achieved by any of these endeavours. The next major phase in Antarctic scientific exploration was the International Geophysical Year (1.G.Y.) organised by the International Council of Scientific Unions (I.C.S.U.). The year was planned for 1957-68 but planning began in 1952, and special attention was directed towards Antarctic research. The scheme for the I.G.Y. with manned stations around the Antarctic Continent was taken up enthusiastically by many nations. Several countries were involved in preliminary reconnaisance expeditions often primarily planned to choose suitable sites for I.G.Y. bases. Thus the United States series of \" Deep Freeze \" operations commenced in 1955-56, and a Soviet I.G.Y. expedition was mounted in 1955-56. I.G.Y. bases up to 1958 had been established by the United States, United Kingdom, the U.S.S.R., Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, Norway and Japan. Twelve nations signed the\n\n26\n\nR. E. DELL\n\nAntarctic Treaty in 1959. A committee of the International Council of Scientific Unions (I.C.S.U.), the Special Committee on Antarctic Research (S.C.A.R.) formed in 1958, has held conferences, organized subcommittees to stimulate further work, and acts as a scientific advisor to the Treaty nations. Some nations continued to maintain bases in Antarctica after the close of the I.G.Y. These have included Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, United Kingdom, U.S.S.R. and the United States. Marine research programmes have been instituted at many of these bases, especially McMurdo Sound (U.S.A. and N.Z.), Adelie Land (France), Mirnyy (U.S.S.R.), Signy Island, South Orkneys (U.K.). With a few exceptions the most productive programmes have resulted from the use of expedition vessels to work in associated areas. The United States efforts have been organized by the U.S. Antarctic Research Program (U.S.A.R.P.) appointed under the auspices of the National Science Foundation. Since 1962 the U.S.N.S. Eltanin operated by the United States National Science Foundation has been operating an almost continuous collecting programme through the Southern Oceans. The results of many of these more recent endeavours insofar as they relate to the benthos are only slowly appearing. The New Zealand Oceanographic Institute is publishing a series of bulletins based on material collected in the Ross Sea during the early New Zealand work there, and especially from extensive dredging and trawling programmes carried out from H.M.N.Z.S. Endeavour in 1958-59 and 1959-60, under the general heading \" The Fauna of the Ross Sea \". The results of biological work stemming from U.S.A.R.P. activities are now appearing in an Antarctic Research Series. Two bulletins on Polychaeta (Hartman, 1964, 1966), and others on Cirripedia (Newman and Ross, 1971), Ascidiacea (Kott, 1969) and Antarctica-Subantarctic Marine Algae (Papenfuss, 1964b) have been published. Soviet work on the benthos carried out from the Ob and other vessels has been published in a series of \" Biological Reports of the Soviet Antarctic Expedition (1955-1958)\"', four volumes of which have fortunately been translated into English. Shorter preliminary reports of Soviet work have appeared in \" Soviet Antarctic Expedition Information Bulletins \", many of which have also appeared in English translation. Many of the papers relating to French Antarctic work have appeared (or have been reprinted) in a series of publications of \" Expeditions Polaires Frangaises \". Japanese marine material was mostly collected from R.V. Umitaka Maru, and some of the reports are published in JARE Scientific Reports. British biological work is being published in a series under the title of \" Scientific Reports of the British Antarctic\n\nANTARUTIO BENTHOS\n\n27\n\nSurvey ”. Many results are, however, being published in the normal scientific literature, so that keeping in touch with the literature of the last few decades is a difficult task. The United States produces an “Antarctic Bibliography ”, issued first as index cards and later consolidated into bound volumes. One of the most useful general bibliographies of Antarctic and Subantarctic biology is that produced as a subject bibliography by Amaud, Arnaud and Hureau (1967) arranged in broad systematic sections. An invaluable bibliography of papers by Soviet workers has been published by Petrovskaya (1968).\n\nIV. THEFAUNAOF ANTARCTICA Every major group of marine benthic animals seems to have been recorded from Antarctic waters, although the representation within these major groups may be uneven. The occurrence of higher Crustacea may be used to illustrate this point although i t will be demonstrated in considering many of the animal groups that follow. Benthic decapods are rare, brachyuran crabs not having been recorded, apart from a doubtful reference of Halicarcinw to the South Orkneys. Anomurans are represented by rare lithodid crabs at Scott Island and at South Georgia. Stomatopods are lacking completely. On the whole it is at about the level of Orders that occasional gaps appear in Antarctic checklists, although most of the noteworthy gaps are at the family level or slightly higher. Groups of animals which are well represented are those adapted to make use of the great summer bloom of phytoplankton. Many of these animals have thrived under Antarctic conditions, e.g. sponges, bryozoa, ascidians, gorgonian corals, hydroids, bivalves, cirripedes, sedentate polychaetes, ophiuroids and crinoids. Many of these are sedentary, anchored to the substrate, some are colonial. Especially in shallow water a surprising number, often the most common animals, practice either facultative or obligatory necrophagy (Arnaud, 1970). Some groups seem particularly well represented in Antarctic waters. Outstanding examples are siliceous sponges, pycnogonids and isopods. Some individual species occur in very high numbers, e.g. the nemertean Lineus corrugatus, the amphipods of the genus Orchomenella, small gastropods of the genera Subonoba and Ovirissoa, and the ophiuroid, Ophiacantha antarcticu. The collections of echinoderms from off Adelie Land from 0 to 60 m contained 1 100 specimens of Sterechinus neumayeri (85% of all the echinoids collected) and 736 specimens of Odontaster validus (87% of all the asteroids collected) (Amaud, 1964).\n\nR.

DELL\n\nMany Antarctic benthic animals have been recorded from a single station, or from a relatively restricted geographical area. It is impossible to decide if these species have a restricted distribution in fact, or if the species has not as yet been collected adequately. Some of the wide ranging species which may be considered as typical Antarctic forms are confined strictly to the Antarctic Region (Fig. 2). Other wide ranging species equally typical of the Antarctic biota extend their ranges into the Subantarctic or into southern South America. The ranges of some of those species taken from varied systematic groups are shown in Fig. 3. Detailed accounts of the main groups of animals follows. A. .Foraminifera The benthic Foraminifera of the Antarctic have been described and discussed by a long series of authors, almost in direct inverse proportion to their size. This is not surprising since the benthic forms are easily collected in bulk and can often be obtained from material which has not been primarily obtained for biological purposes, let alone for foraminiferal workers. Chapman’s paper (1916) on Foraminifera and Ostracoda obtained from the material obtained on sounding leads on the British Antarctic Expedition, 1907-09, is a good example. Work on the Foraminifera in general has also been well financed because of the obvious economic value in stratigraphy, and hence the prime importance of the group to such economic ventures as oil prospecting. Because they are usually the dominant organism present in sea bottom cores their systematics and distribution have been carefully studied. These factors have not yet affected the study of the Antarctic forms markedly but it has meant that the literature on the group is well organized and many of the basic systematic problems have already been thoroughly dealt with. Early work on the group in the Antarctic was mainly concerned with systematics and distribution, and indeed a good deal probably remains to be done along these lines of investigation. New species are still being described even from such relatively well worked areas as the Ross Sea (Kennett, 1967). The fist Antarctic species were recorded by Ehrenberg (1844) from material collected on the voyage of the Erebw and Terror. A summary of this rather sketchily identified material is given by Heron-Allen and Earland (1922, p. 28). Major reports from Antarctic expeditions have been contributed by Brady (1884), two of the Challenger deep-water stations being south of the Antarctic Circle; Faure-Premiet (1911, 1913, 1914) from the two French Expeditions ;Heron-Allen and Earland (1922) from Terra Nova\n\nLNTAlZUTIU BENTHOS\n\n31\n\nmaterial; Pearcey (1914)from the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition; Chapman (1916a, b) from the British Antarctic Expedition 190709 ; Wiesner (1931) from the German South Polar Expedition ; HeronAllen and Earland (1932) and Earland (1936) from the material collected by the Discovery Investigations ;Chapman and Parr (1937) from the Australasian Antarctic Expedition ; Cushman (1945) from the U.S. Antarctic Service Expedition and Parr (1950) from the B.A.N.Z.A.R. Expedition. Warthin (1934) recorded some material from 1 600 ft in the Bay of Whales, Ross Sea, and Crespin (1960) studied Foraminifera from terraces in the Vestfold Hills and reviewed some previous work. Some of these earlier reports went beyond questions of identification, classification and distribution. A much stronger ecological basis and a rather different outlook has been apparent in more recent work, obviously influenced by the trends of research in other areas. The workers responsible have been able to escape very largely from the qualitative approach of the earlier works (essential though this W ~ Ba t the time) and develop a much more quantitative approach. Uchio (1960) studied the benthonic Foraminifera from ten samples from Lutzow-Holm Bay (38'E). He recognized three assemblages based on depth 1. From 350 to 850 m with the characteristic species, Angulogerina angulosa Cushman, Epistominelh exigua (Brady) and Ehrenbergina glubra Heron-Allen and Earland. 2. Prom 850 to 2000m. An assemblage of Bulimina aculeata Orbigny with a dominance of Eponides weddellemis Earland. 3. Deeper than 2 000 m. Assemblages of Eponides weddellensis and Epistominellu exigua. The two species Haplophragmoides bradyi (Robertson) and Bulimina rostrata Brady appeared to be restricted to this zone. Saidova (1961) demonstrated an increase in Foraminifera down to about 400m. Abundant calcareous species occurred down to about 4 000 m. Species groups occurred at 150 to 500, 1 200 to 2 800, and at 3 500 to 5 000 m respectively. A major contribution came from McKnight (1962) who reviewed previous work on Foraminifera in the Antarctic and presented very full quantitative data based on 28 surface core samples. From an analysis of his results he could find no correlation between distribution and depth, temperature, salinity, or mean grain size. Organic carbon seemed a possible controlling mechanism especially for arenaceous species. I n some instances the spread of grain size in the sediments also appeared to have some effect. McKnight postulated a bottom current carrying a\n\n32\n\nR. K. DELL\n\nhigh arenaceous and a low calcareous foraminifera1content passing over the stations in which he had found high arenaceous contents, in order to explain the distribution of foraminifera he had observed in the Ross Sea. At the same time this current would have swept most planktonic species out of the area. Pflum (1963) studied 10 surface core samples from the Ross Sea. His results largely agreed with those of McKnight. Blanc-Vernet ( 1965) described the distribution of Foraminifera from nine samples from off Adelie Land, in depths from 10 to 270 m. These samples fell into two groups, a shallow water fauna from 10 to 40 m and a deeper fauna from 180 to 270 m. A larger number of families was represented in the deeper series. The family Trochamminidae was much commoner in the shallower series, the genus Trocbmmina (except for F. globigeriniformis) being largely confined to depths less than 100 m. The families Textulariidae, Cassidulinidae and Buliminidae seemed present in both series roughly in the same percentage. The families Lagenidae, Polymorphinidae, Miliolidae and Silicinidae, well represented in the deeper series were absent from the shallower group. Bandy and Echols (1964) analysed all the data previously collected on the Antarctic forms, including that presented by Uchio (1960) and McKnight (1962). A careful examination of these existing records gave the following zones for zonation of Antarctic benthic Foraminifera. 1. 200 (&150) m. aculeata group. 2. 500 (f 160) m. pusilla Brady group. 3. 1 000 (f200) m. 4. 2 000 (+200) m. 5. 2 400 (f600) m.\n\nAdercotryma glomerata (Brady)-Bulimina Cibicides wuellerstorfi (Schwagar)-Cyclammina Cyclammina orbicularis Brady group. Astrorhixa crassatina Brady group. Bulimina rostrata group.\n\nBandy and Echols present several useful tables giving bathymetric ranges for selected index species. They also showed that some Antarctic species occur in different depths from those known for the same species in other areas (heterobathyl species). For example Laticarinina pauperata (Parker and Jones) occurs in the deep cold waters of the Antarctic and in shallower warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico. A major contribution to our knowledge of the ecology and distribution of Antarctic Foraminifera is Kennett’s (1968) study of Ross Sea species. Based on 48 newly collected bottom stations and 60 earlier samples spread more or less over the whole extent of the Ross Sea it gave a wider geographical and bathymetric coverage of a restricted area than had been available in Antarctic waters before. A total of 102 genera and 210 species were identified, and bathymetric distribu-\n\nANTAROTIO BENTHOS\n\n33\n\ntion and abundance for each species was recorded. Kennett found that his faunas fell into two separate and completely contrasting groups. 1. A calcareous fauna, with abundant calcareous Foraminifera, moderately abundant Ostracoda, Bryozoa, small Mollusca, etc. but with relatively few arenaceous Foraminifera, generally a high number of foraminiferal species present. 2. A dominantly non-calcareous fauna, with arenaceous Foraminifera, diatoms and siliceous sponge spicules. This group of faunas with more than 85% of the benthic faunal constituents consisting of arenaceous Foraminifera was defined by Kennett as arenaceous faunas. Arenaceous Foraminifera build their tests by cementing various materials such as sand grains or sponge spicules with a predominantly ferruginous secretion. Only a relatively small number of species is usually present. Most of the calcareous faunas occurred in depths shallower than 550 m, while all the arenaceous faunas were found deeper than 430 m. Kennett stresses that approximately the same number of arenaceous species occur in both calcareous and arenaceous faunas, and with some exceptions they are essentially the same species. The arenaceous faunas have much greater numbers of individuals. Arenaceous species characteristic of the calcareous fauna are Brachysiphon sp., and Ammodiscus cf. anguillae Hoglund. The more characteristic species in the arenaceous fauna include : Rhizammina indivisa Brady, Bathysiphon Jiliformis Sars, Pelosina bicaudata (Parr), CJlomospira charoides (Jones & Parker), R e o p h x distans Brady, R. spiculifer Brady, Adercotryma glomerata (Brady), Verneuilina minuta Wiesner and Karreriella pusilla Parr. There have been many attempts to determine the reasons for the level a t which arenaceous species become dominant, at whatever depth the phenomenon takes place. The general theory has been that there is a solution boundary beyond which at least thin-shelled calcareous foraminiferal tests are dissolved. General studies on this problem have indicated that the solubility of calcium carbonate increases with increasing salinity and with pressure. However it also appears that different species differ in the ease with which the test dissolves. It has been shown that in Antarctic waters generally quite abundant calcareous foraminiferal faunas do exist down to at least 4 000 m. (Saidova, 1961 ; Bandy and Echols, 1964). Kennett (1968, p. 34) believes that solution of calcium carbonate occurs at shallower depths in the Ross Sea because the water below about 550 m is highly unsaturated for a number of reasons. The water is at very low temperature even for Antarctic sea water ( O O C to -2°C) at a very high salinity (34.75 to 35.00%). Such cold water would allow\n\n34\n\nR. K . DELL\n\nan increase in the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide, which is readily available in the Ross Sea since sunlight is lacking for about half the year, and since many animals live permanently away from light under the Ross Sea shelf. These are of course factors which can be checked, and the work planned for examining the water beneath the Ross Ice Shelf will add some firm knowledge in this respect. On the face of it, however, it seems difficult to see that such a great difference in depth should exist between the “ calcium solution ” layer at about 530 m in the Ross Sea, and at 4 000 m in the Antarctic waters just outside the Ross Sea area. If this factor is to work on the tests of Foraminifera, it should also work to obliterate the shells of Mollusca. It may very well do this in the course of time but dead shells occur below 500 m in the Ross Sea in numbers. The shells of live Mollusca from deeper water contain little calcium carbonate, but that is rather a different matter. The cores studied by McKnight (1962) from the Ross Sea showed an increase in the percentage of calcareous benthic specimens present from top to bottom in his cores. He postulated two possible reasons for this. The first supposed that arenaceous forms had not yet entered the Ross Sea in strength and had gradually done so over the time the sediments in the cores were being deposited. The second required a change in water masses because of climatic change. Kennett (1968) believed that the second explanation fitted the facts of the situation better. An increase in the percentage of calcareous forms would represent a warmer period with the calcium-solution boundary lowered correspondingly. As Kennett (1968, p. 35) suggested, “A study of the distribution of calcareous and arenaceous foraminifera1 assemblages in long cores from the Ross Sea may provide evidence of the climatic history of the area ”. From his analysis of bathymetric ranges for Foraminifera from his own samples, and from those recorded by McKnight (1962) and Pflum (1963) in the Ross Sea, ranging in depth from 90 to 3 570 m Kennett (1968) noted several abrupt changes with increasing depth. These main changes occurred a t about 270, 450 to 550 m, and at 1 300 and 2 200 m. The boundary a t 270 m was the upper depth limit for some 19 species. The relatively broad boundary between 450 and 550m seems to represent the calcium solution boundary and was the lower limit for practically every calcareous species. Ten arenaceous species reach their shallow depth boundary in this zone. Two species Hyperammina novaexealandiae Heron-Allen and Earland, and a species of Rhabdammina do extend into shallower depths but only occur in quantity from this zone down to about 2 200 m. At 1 300 m, the upper\n\nANTAEUYTIC BENTHOS\n\n35\n\nlimits of the depth range of Cyclammina orbicularis and Cribrostomoides subglobosum (Sam), and the upper limit of abundance of Glomospira icharoides is reached, and Karreriella puailla, Reophax spiculifer and Hemisphaerammina depressa (Heron-Allen and Earland) reach their lower limits. At 2 200 m the upper depth limit of Ammomarginula ensis Wiesner, and the upper limits of abundance of Haplophragmoides rotulatum (Brady) are reached, while Hyperammina novaezealandia, a species of Rhabdammina, Reophax SUbfUSifOrmiS Earland, Bathysiphon discreta (Brady), Miliammina arenacea (Chapman) and Reophax subdentaliniformis Parr reach their lower limit. Boundaries were postulated at 475 m (McKnight)andat 515 and 1 134 m (Pflum), so that there appears to be a degree of agreement between these different workers. The number of species of Foraminifera recorded from different collections have been: 40 species from one Challenger Station a t 65'42'5 in 3 063 m (Brady, 1884) ; 216 species from the shelf and slope and 52 others in adjacent deep water basins from material collected by the German South Polar Expedition (analysis by Earland, 1935 based upon the report by Wiesner, 1931); 83 species from the Antarctic area especially the Weddell Sea (Pearcey, 1914) ; 342 species from the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (Chapman and Parr, 1937) ; 196 species and varieties from the B.A.N.Z.A.R. expedition (Parr, 1950). McKnight (1962) identified 133 species classified in 67 genera from 28 Antarctic cores, while Kennett (1968) identified 102 genera and 210 species from the Ross Sea. McKnight (1962) recorded that many of the 67 genera he recorded were believed to be confined to the Antarctic but no recent biogeographical account has come to notice. McKnight has recorded benthonic assemblages from the Ross Sea, the Weddell Sea, Queen Maud Land with a few records from the Palmer Peninsula. Other records are available for other areas, but some critical systematics w i l l surely be needed before comparisons can reasonably be made.\n\nB. Porifera It has been claimed that the abundance of sponges in the Antarctic makes the present as much the Age of Sponges as was the Cretaceous (Burton, 1932). Practically every biologist who has worked in the Antarctic has commented on the number of sponges, their size and the part played in the fauna by the glassy sponges. The Erst scientific records were published by Carter (1872, 1875, 1877) who in 1872 described Tethya antarctica and Rossella antarctica from material collected in the Ross Sea by the Erebus and Terror, the\n\n36\n\nR. K. DELL\n\ngenus Rossella being proposed for the second species. I n 1875 he discussed the genus Rossella, provided more information on R.antarctica and described further deep sea species from outside the Antarctic. I n spite of the difficulties inherent in work on the systematics of the group, reports on sponges have been produced by almost every Antarctic expedition, and the list of contributions is long indeed, the main authors being: Topsent (1901a, b, 1905, 1907a, b, 1908, 1910, 1912, 1913, 1915, 1916, 1917), Kirkpatrick (1902, 1907a, b, 1908), Jenkin (1908), Lendenfeld (1908), Schulze and Kirkpatrick (1910), Hentschel (1914), Dendy (1918, 1924), Brondsted (1928, 1931), and Tanita (1959). But two names are prominent amongst the students of the Antarctic sponges, the British zoologist Burton (1929, 1930, 1932, 1934, 1938) and the Soviet investigator Koltun (1964, 1969, 1970). Koltun (1964) recorded the sponges collected during the Soviet Antarctic expeditions mostly between 1955 and 1958, belonging to the Tetraxonida and Cornacuspongia. The sponges concerned come also from the South Orkneys, South Sandwich and Bouvet Islands, and South Georgia as well as from the Subantarctic islands of Marion, Crozet, Prince Edward, Kerguelen, Heard and Macquarie. In this paper Koltun diagnosed 230 species belonging to 98 genera, the two genera, CEudothenea and Bipcillopsis and 23 species being described as new. Koltun (1970) has recorded some 300 species of sponges from the Antarctic, the islands of the Scotia Arc, Bouvet, Marion, Crozet, Prince Edward, Kerguelen, Heard and Macquarie Islands. These are divided amongst the classes as follows : Calcispongiae Hyalospongiae Demospongiae\n\n8 species ; - 26 species ; - 260 species.\n\nLike the Arctic, the Antarctic sponge fauna shows a dearth of horny sponges. The families Geodiidae, Theneidae, Stellettidae and Tethyidae are either very poorly represented or are completely absent (Burton, 1932). The large glass sponges are, however, abundant, especially representatives of the family Rossellidae, species of which may grow to gigantic size, e.g. Scolymastra joubini Topsent, which may attain a height of 100 cm (Koltun, 1970). Antarctic sponges occur over wider bathymetric ranges than they do in other parts of the world. Koltun believes that this is related to the mixed bottom sediments which provide uniform bottom conditions over much of the shelf and continental slope. Because there is no\n\nANTARCTIC BENTHOS\n\n37\n\ncontinental run-off oceanic waters extend right to the edge of the continent, allowing sponges from deeper water to occur in shallow water close inshore. The glass sponges are typically oceanic forms found only at depths greater than 100 m, but in the Antarctic they may be abundant near the coast even in water as shallow as 10m. The presence of bottom currents flowing from the continent outwards and downwards also tends to produce a uniform sponge fauna with no zonal distribution developed between 100 and 900 m. More than half the species recorded from the Antarctic (in the wide sense used by Koltun including also most of the Subantarctic) are endemic. Generic endemism is much less marked. Some 116 genera are known in the Antarctic. Of these only nine (Koltun, 1970) can be considered to be endemic, Scolymastra, Acanthorhabdus, Hoplakithara, Cercidochela, Meliidermu, Crellina, Bipocillopsis, Acanthoxa, and Cladothenea. Most of the Antarctic species of sponges belong to genera which are well represented in the seas of the world, e.g. Mycale, Asbestopluma, Myxilla, Tedania, Iophon, Hymedesmia, Isodictya, Anchinoe, Haliclona, Adocia, and Hymeniacidon. As in many other groups many sponges have a circum-Antarctic distribution. The commonest species in this group are : Rossella antarctica Carter, R . racovitzae Topsent, Scolymastra joubini, Cinachyra antarctica Carter, Tetilla leptodermu Sollas, Mycule tridens Hentschel, M . acerata Kirkpatrick, Asbestopluma belgicae Topsent, Iophon radiatus Topsent, I . spatulatus Kirkpatrick, Acanthorhabdus fragilis Burton, Cercidochela lankesteri Kirkpatrick, Tedania masaa Ridley and Dendy, T . oxeata Topsent, Axociella nidijcuta Kirkpatrick, Isodictya erinacea Topsent, Ectyodoryx ramilobosa (Topsent), Eurypon miniaceum Thiele and Microxina benedeni (Topsent), (Koltun, 1964). Koltun has shown that there are, however, marked differences between the faunas of East and West Antarctica. McMurdo Sound in the Ross Sea is the only area in Antarctica from which representatives of Stelletta, Geodinella, Jmpis, Penares, Hemiasterella, Rhabderemia, Chondropsis, and Dysidea have been collected (Burton, 1929). Other species, e.g. Hoplakithara dendyi Kirkpatrick, Plocumia gaussiana Hentschel, Clathria pauper Brondsted, Sphaerotylus schoenus Sollas, Dolichancanthu macrodon Hentschel, Desmucella vestibularis Wilson and Monoggringa longispinu von Lendenfeld have a wider distribution but are still confined to Emt Antarctica. Many fewer species are endemic to West Antarctica, e.g. Mycale macrochela Burton, M . tylotornota Koltun, Isodactyla toxiphila Burton, Myxilla australis Topsent, M . piatillaris Topsent, and Hymeniacidon\n\n38\n\nR. K. DELL\n\ntorquata Topsent. Koltun (1970) does not believe that these differences between East and West Antarctica can be accounted for solely by our admittedly incomplete knowledge of the fauna. The closest relationships of the Antarctic sponges appear to be with the Falklands and southern South America. More than 50 species are found in both areas, whereas only 30 species are common to the Antarctic and Australasia. Abyssal sponges of the southern oceans are as yet hardly known. About 30 species have been recorded belonging t o such genera as Caulophacus, Malacosaccus, Holascus, Aubcalyx, Hyalonema, Asbestopluma and Cladorhim. One of the characteristic Antarctic sponge families is the Rossellidae. It is a family of glass sponges, some members of which grow to great size. Normally found below 100 m, members of this family are found commonly on the shelf. It is the abundance of these forms in comparatively shallow water that gives a unique character to the benthos of the Antarctic. Anyone who has sorted collections of Antarctic benthic animals either straight from the trawls, or from bulk preserved material in museum or laboratory on the other side of the world, will know the long, unbelievably sharp, glassy spicules which almost in themselves certify the collection as Antarctic. Koltun (1969) has presented eight distribution maps showing patterns for selected Antarctic and Subantarctic sponges (Fig. 4). I n the family Rossellidae, the "
