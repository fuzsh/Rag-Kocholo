The President exhibited a number of living Helicide which were actively crawling about. They had been received from Major Freeman, who had collected them in a condition of estivation in the Gallipoli Peninsula during the recent military operations. SPECIAL MEETING. Fripay, 10ta Drcremper, 1915. The Rev. A. H. Cooke, Se.D., F.Z.S., President, in the Chair. The meeting was convened by the Council for the purpose of submitting a proposal to omit from Rule XVI the words ‘‘at 8 p.m.”’ in order to enable the Council to alter the time of meeting so as to make it more convenient for country members to attend. The President formally proposed a resolution to that effect, which was seconded by Mr. R. Bullen Newton, F.G.S., and carried unanimously. VOL.

By the kindness of a friend I have come into possession of a specimen of Lugyrina (formerly known as Fanella) gigantea, Lam., from British ~ waters. ‘he specimen, which was alive when taken, measures exactly 5 inches in length, and still retains the operculum. It was trawled (there were several specimens in all) in the deep trough (50 to 100 fathoms) off the Saltees lightship, between Carnsore Point and St. David’s Head, in company with Cassidaria rugosa, L. Unless I am mistaken, the discovery of this species constitutes an important addition to the British marine molluscan fauna. Five specimens were exhibited before the Conchological Society in May, 1915, having been dredged alive off the south-west coast of Ireland in deep water, also with C. rugosa. Butno precise statement is published ' as to the locality, which may or may not have been within the British marine area. In any case, the present specimen comes from waters which are essentially British, and the locality is by far the most northern hitherto recorded. The species is common in the Mediterranean, and it is probably an accident that all Weinkauff’s localities (ii, 71) are west of Tarentum. Kobelt (Iconogr. ii, 1901, pp. 11-138) records it from the Atlantic only up to the mouth of the Tagus. The Z)-availleur had many years before dredged it in the Bay of Biscay (Jeffreys, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. v, vol. vi, 1880, p. 318). Dautzenberg records? it from the voyage of the Hirondelle (1886), from various localities in the Bay of Biscay, from lat. 43° 12’ to 45° 48’ N. and long. 5° 58’ to 11° 52’ W., at depths varying from 160 to 510 metres, in fine sand, coarse gravel, mud, and rock. He also adds that it was met with in the Gulf of Gascony by the Zravailleur and the Porcupine, and that it is frequently brought up by the fishing-boats from off Arcachon. Finally, A. Reynell, recording the results of the cruise of the S.8. Hualey to the northern side of the Bay of Biscay in August, 1906, mentions® Ranella gigantea as dredged in 109 fathoms (four living specimens—two male, two female) from lat. 47° 48 N., long. 7° 46’ W., adding ‘‘the most northerly habitat of this species so far recorded ’’. It appears doubtful whether Locard’s view will hold good, that the Atlantic shells differ sufficiently from the Mediterranean to justify the constitution of two varieties, atlantica and mediterranea. The form atlantica is said to occur in the post-Pliocene of Italy. In accordance with Dall’s classification’ of the Ranellide and Tritonide, the Ranella gigantea of Lamarck is now separated from the former group, and is at present the sole occupant in the British Museum Collection of the genus Hugyrina of Dall. 1 Journ. of Conch., xiv, 1915, p. 366. 2 Mém.

By the Rev. A. H. Cooxs; Se.D., F.Z.8: Read 10th December, 1915. Dorine a visit to Porthcawl (Glamorgan) in August of the present year, I was struck by the occurrence of Helix pisana, Mill., on the sand-hills to the east of the town. Specimens were present in hundreds, clinging, as usual, in masses to the stalks of the herbage. It seems obvious that the species must have been introduced by the agency of man, and probably within the last few years. Although the ‘burrows’ at Porthcawl extend for a distance of perhaps two miles along the coast, and offer what seems a suitable habitat through- out, the species only occurs at present, so far as I was able to ascertain, for the few hundred yards immediately adjacent to the town, just where the bathing tents are pitched. It seems clear that the introducer put his specimens down on the first suitable ground he came to, where they at once increased and multiplied, but they have not yet had time to extend their area of occupation over more than a small section of the sand-hills. It is quite probable that the species was introduced from Tenby, which is hardly more than four hours journey from Porthcawl by train. Not all attempts to colonize Helix pisana in Glamorgan have been so successful. Jeffreys made two attempts, at an interval of years, to colonize it on the sand-hills near Swansea, but the experiment failed. According to J. W. Taylor,? ‘‘Mr. H. Rowland Wakefield now entirely omits it from his list of Swansea shells, as he has regularly and persistently searched the district for some years past, in conjunction with the local Field Club, without finding a trace of a single shell, though recently he has picked up a few dead specimens at Singleton.” Perhaps one of these local Field Clubs may be able to furnish some definite information as to when and how the Porthcawl colony was started, which seems to have a more brilliant future before it than that at Swansea. 1 Brit.

Read 14th January, 1916. W. H. Datt, in his well-known and admirable paper,! ‘‘ An Historical - and Systematic Review of the Frog-Shells and Tritons,” draws up a classification, which results in the following grouping :— Genus Bursa. A. Sub-genus Bursa. Operculum with lateral nucleus: (a) Sect. Bursa (spinosa, Lam.). (6) Sect. Marsupina (spadicea, Mtf., or crassa, Dillw.). (c) Sect. Chasmotheca ( foliata, Brod.). Operculum with apical nucleus : (d) Sect. Ranella (bufonia, Gmel.). (e) Sect. Lampadopsis (rhodostoma, Beck). (f) Sect. Colubrellina (conditus, Gmel.). B. Sub-genus Aspa. Sect. Aspa (marginata, Gmel.). C. Sub-genus Bufonaria. (a) Sect. Crossata (ventricosa, Brod.). (6) Sect. Bufonaria (serobilator [ sic], L.). (e) Sect. Craspedotriton (convolutus, Brod.). It will be noticed that the characteristics of the operculum, given in the above classification, affect only one of the three sub-genera (Bursa), while of the operculum of the two remaining sub-genera (Aspa, Bufonaria) nothing is stated. Dall further remarks: ‘‘ According to Adams the Ranella have the operculum ovate, with an apical or subapical nucleus, while Gray speaks of it as half-ovate with a central, lateral, or internal nucleus ; probably it varies in the different groups as in the Tritons ; in anella Joliata it is figured as concentric, with the nucleus mid-lateral. One cannot safely generalize on the character until the operculum of more species 1s known.”’ In view of this last remark I venture to put on record the facts, so far as they are known to me, of a considerable number of species of the genus Bursa. If students to whom are known the opercula of other species not in the list will gradually add to the number, a more or less complete body of evidence will in the end be accumulated. No final classification of a group can be regarded as settled until full information of this kind is in our possession. It must be premised that Dall published no list of species contained in each of his several groups or sections, but only a type species in each case. J have therefore worked the list as interpreted by the * Smiths. Coll., xlvii, 1904, pp. 114-44. 6 PROCEEDINGS OF THE MALACOLOGICAL SOCIETY. Natural History Museum in their show-cases. The only difference between their grouping and Dall’s is the nominal substitution of Tutufa, Jouss., for the sub-genus he calls Bufonaria. Nothing is commoner than for opercula to be misplaced, turned upside down, outside in, and even located in shells they do not belong to. Great caution is needed in order to avoid mistakes.

With regard to the section Craspedotriton, Kesteven has shown ' that the operculum and radula of convolutus, Brod., are those of Trophon, not Bursa; it is probable, therefore, that scalariformis, Brod., and scalarina, A. Ad. (= speciosa, Ang.), will also prove to be Trophons: the section therefore drops out. The details of the known species are as follows :— A. Sub-genus Borsa. (a) Section Bursa. General characteristics: operculum rather thin, more or less transparent, almost triangular, with longer side rounded, nucleus sub-lateral, to the left (¢.e. adjacent to the columella), nearly central, clear of the margin, lines of growth prominent. 1. albifasciata, Sowb. A somewhat broken operculum is attached to the tablet in M.B., nucleus to right, sub-lateral, half-way between centre and lower end. In other words, if the operculum belongs to the shell, which I doubt (the shells are Cuming’s), the species must be removed, probably to section Ranella or Colubrellina, from which, conchologically, it is quite distinct. 2. erumena, Lam. Nucleus well marked, lines of growth flattened. 3. elegans, Beck. As in spinosa, not transparent, colour deep brown. 4. margaritula, Desh. Rather less pointed at top and bottom than the other species, dark brown, lines of growth not very prominent. 5. nana, Sowb. ‘Two opercula are attached to the tablet in M.B. (Cuming’s specimens), one rather long, narrow, nucleus sub-terminal, the other more ovate, light-coloured, nucleus sub-marginal, to right, below the centre. It is clear that both of these cannot be the true opercula, and I am inclined to regard them both with suspicion. 6. rana, L. ‘Thin, transparent, lines of growth very sharply marked, and occasionally rising into broad raised ridges. 7. spinosa, Lam. Not angled, but rounded, against the columella, thicker than in rana, lines of growth not elevated. 8. thersites, Redf. Rather thin, nucleus very near the margin, a little below the centre. 1 Pyoe. Linn. Soc. N.S. Wales, vol. xxvii, 1902, p. 479. Dall, though writing his paper on the Frog Shells in 1904, does not seem to have seen Kesteven’s paper, as he expressly says (p. 13), with reference to scalariformis and convolutus, *‘ their operculum is not known to me.’’ 8 PROCEEDINGS OF THE MALACOLOGICAL SOCIETY. Sections I/arsupina and Chasmotheca. It seems doubtful whether these sections embody any valid distinction from Bursa, s.str. The operculum of crassa, Dillw., does not appear to be known; Dall states that that of fol/ata is as in rana. (0) Section Panella. General characteristics: nucleus to right, thicker than in Bursa, not well marked, lateral, sub-terminal. 1. bufonia, Lam. Rounded above, narrower below, nucleus very indistinct, close to the right of terminal margin. 2. stphonata, Rve. Rounded above and below, nucleus better marked and rather higher up than in bufonva. tuberosissima, Rve. Almost exactly as in stphonata. (ce) Section Zampadopsis. General characteristics: more or less as in Ranella. 1. asperrima, Dunk. Thin, ovate, transparent horn-colour, nucleus terminal, well marked, slightly to the left, lines of growth well marked. This operculum differs markedly in character from the others in the section. 2. eruentata, Sowb. Thin, rounded above, somewhat angled below, nucleus sub-terminal, to right, fairly well marked. 3. rhodostoma, Desh. ‘‘ Nucleus lateral, submarginal, to the right and sub-terminal, like that of s¢phonata” (Ph.D.). 4. thome, Orb. Thin, ovate, nucleus sub-marginal, to the left, sub-terminal, indistinctly marked. (d) Section Colubrellina. General characteristics : operculum ovate, sometimes semi- unguiculate, thickish, narrower below than above, nucleus rather obscure, sub-terminal, or sub-lateral to the right. 1. granularis, Bolt., with vars. afinis, Brod., livida, Rve., ponderosa, Rve. The nucleus varies slightly in position ; in two typical granu- laris (= granifera, Lam.) from M.M. the nucleus is sub-terminal, in a divida from M.M. and an affnis from J.R.T. it is obscurely sub-marginal, to the right, and sub-terminal. Ph.D. remarks to me: ‘‘opere. a nucléus latéral, marginal, situé, soit au dessous du milieu, soit méme presque a l’extremité.” 2. celata, Brod. Shape almost semi-unguiculate, nucleus well marked, sub-terminal, but well away from the margin, lines of growth well marked, rising into ridges in old specimens. 3. pustulosa,| Rve. Shape semi-unguiculate, nucleus almost terminal, closely resembling that of celata. 4. semigranosa, Lam. Many consider this species another variety of granularis. Operculum thin, nucleus obscure, sub-marginal, to right, sub-terminal, as in granularis. ' This species, from West Africa, St. Helena, and Ascension, must surely be regarded as distinct from celata, Brod., a Panama shell which does not occur in the West Indies. DR. COOKE: OPERCULUM OF THE GENUS BURSA. 9 B. Sub-genus Aspa. Section A spa. marginata, Gmel. (the only species). Operculum thin, semi- transparent, lines of growth clearly marked. Shape as in Bursa, but not so triangular, nucleus similarly situated, slightly more removed from the left margin. C. Sub-genus Bufonaria. (a) Section Crossata. General characteristics: operculum ovate, rounded at both ends, thick, dark horn-colour, lines of growth obscure, a nucleus indicated but not existing, lateral, sub-terminal, to right. californica, Hinds. Opercnlum as in the section. In a remark- ably fine and clear specimen from McA. there is almost a visible nucleus on the margin low down on the right. 2. ventricosa, Brod. Operculum a little wider than in californica, but in other respects generally corresponding. (6) Section Bufonaria (= Tutufa, Jouss.). 1. rubeta, Bolt. (=lampas, auctt.). Operculum sub-ovate, not very thick, rounded at top, angled below, nucleus distinct, sub-lateral, to right, well away from margin, below the centre, lines of growth well marked, but not raised in ridges. 2. scrobiculator, L. Operculum sub-ovate, rather thin, semi- transparent, rounded above and below, nucleus distinct, sub-lateral, to right, well away from margin, below centre, lines of growth well marked, but not raised in ridges. On a general survey of the evidence afforded by the operculum, the following points seem to stand out :— 1. There is a large group of Bursa (Bursa, s.str. + Chasmotheca + ? Marsupina) with a more or less triangular operculum, nucleus well marked, in the centre of the left sub-margin. 2. Closely allied to this group stands the sub-genus Aspa, conchologically different, but with an operculum of similar general construction. 3. Another large group (Ranel/a + Lampadopsis 4 Colubrellina) possesses an ovate operculum, with nucleus to the right or near the extremity, generally less well marked, sub-marginal or sub-terminal. Closely allied to this group, and possibly not separable from it, are the species contained in section Bufonaria. 4. Further removed comes a group (Crossata) geographically separate from the Bufonaria section, and with an operculum not essentially dissimilar to that of certain species of Zriton (Lotorium). As Dall has remarked, ‘the Ranellas shade very gradually into the forms formerly known as Triton, judged by most of their characters,” and it is interesting to observe how, on the one hand, Gyrineum and Eugyrina carry the “ Ranella” shape of shell, minus the anal sulcus, into the ‘‘ Tritons”’, while the shell shape of certain 10 PROCEEDINGS OF THE MALACOLOGICAL SOCIETY. low-spired forms of Zotortwm is carried into the Crossata group of “* Ranella’’. The evidence, then, of the operculum, plus certain other con- siderations which have appeared in this paper, would lead one to throw out the suggestion that perhaps Dall’s classification might with advantage be modified in the following way :— A. Sub-genus Borsa, containing in a single section Bursa, s.str., Chasmotheca, and probably Marsupina. Fic. 1.—Median teeth of :—1. Bursa granularis, Bolt., Umkomaas, Natal. 2. Triton (Lotorium) australis, Lam., Port ‘Jackson. 38. Crossata ventricosa, Brod., Orange Harbour, Tierra del Fuego. 4. (Triton) leucostoma, Lam., Port Shepstone. 5. Hugyrina gigantea, Lam., Algiers. 6. Crossata californica, Hinds, San Pedro, Cal. All from Professor Gwatkin’s collection. B. Sub-genus Aspa. C. A sub-genus (Ranerra would be a convenient title) including all the sections whose operculum is sub-marginal, generally but not always to the right, or sub-terminal, viz. Ranella, Lampadopsts, Colubrellina, and Bufonaria. D. A sub-genus (call it Crossata if you like) including the two species californica and ventricosa, the form of whose shell and shape of whose operculum approximate towards the ‘‘ Tritons”’. DR. COOKE: OPERCULUM OF THE GENUS BURSA. El The evidence of the radula, as kindly given to me by Professor H. M. Gwatkin, may be stated thus :— An examination of twenty-six species and varieties shows three types of radula. 1. A Bursa type, which includes all the typical Burse, viz. bufonia, calata, cruentata, crumena, granularis and varieties, pustulosa, rana, rhodostoma, semigranosa, siphonata, spinosa, thome. Under this type also, but somewhat distinct from it, come (a) marginata, with radula of so delicate proportions that it stands somewhat apart from the others, and (d) rudeta, of the typical form, but much stronger and stouter. 2. A Triton (Lotoriwm) type (i.e. a median tooth with strong central denticle and several small side denticles) including perca, pusilla, tuberculata, vexillum, and argus, but not gegantea or leucostoma., (N.B. These radule of the ‘‘ Triton” type are by no means typical eeTiripons ’?,) 8. A type unlike both Bursa and ‘‘ Triton”? proper, and including californica, ventricosa, gigantea, and leucostoma, ‘he median exhibits one great central denticle, and is almost bare of side denticles in californica and gigantea: ventricosa combines the big central denticle with the lateral prolongations of a Bursa (Fig. 1). I have to express my thanks to Mr. R. Standen, of the Manchester Museum, to the authorities of the Museum of Zoology at Cambridge, to Dr. J. C. Melvill, and Mr. J. R. Le B. Tomlin for the kind loan of specimens, now exhibited, and also to M. Ph. Dautzenberg for valuable information. ON A COLLECTION OF PELECYPODA FROM THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS. By Enear A. Suirn, 1.8.0. Read 12th November, 1915. PLATE I. Trts small collection, submitted to me for determination, is not of very special interest beyond the fact that it comprises a number of species not previously recorded from the Philippine Islands, with seven which appear to be undescribed. The specimens were all collected at Port Galera, a small bay almost completely landlocked, on the north coast of Mindoro, opposite the town of Batangas, on the island of Luzon. Of the fifty-nine species enumerated rather more than half have already been recorded from the Philippines, and those which appear to be new to the fauna are marked with an asterisk. The identifica- tion of the specimens! has been much facilitated by the catalogue of the Pelecypoda of these islands published by Dr. J. G. Hidalgo in the Mem. R. Acad. Ciencias Madrid, vol. xxi, 1903, pp. 1-v, 1-400, and in the Revista R. Acad. Ciencias Madrid, vol. ii, 1905, pp. 246-312, and vol. iii, 1905, pp. 9-43. A. LIST OF THE SPECIES.

The locality of this species was not known to Deshayes or Reeve, and Hidalgo has not recorded the species in his list of Philippine Pelecypoda. Caxiisra Roskorrncra, Smith, Rep. Challenger Lamellibr., 1885, p- 186, pl. i, figs. 6-60. When describing this species I suggested that it probably attained larger dimensions than those then given. In a series of specimens in the present collection one example is 20°5 mm. in length, which is only 3mm. larger than the type. I am now inclined to think that it does not become much larger. The general tone of colour is rather like that of ‘‘ Dione festiva”’ as given by Reeve (Conch. Icon., vol. xiv, Dione, pl. i, fig. 2). Usually there are at intervals zones of a darker tint than the ground colour, and in some specimens there are distinct, more or less interrupted rays. In the fresh specimens at hand the interior of the valves is whitish round the margin, but purplish elsewhere, with a pale ray from the umbo downwards, All the specimens have the tips of the umbones rosy pink. Anticona (CrrcompHatus) FoLracEa, Philippi, Abbild., vol. ii, 1846, p.alO7 spl. 2, fie. 1. The specimens in the present collection belong to that form of the species figured by Reeve (Conch. Icon., vol. xiv, figs. 109 and 110) SMITH : PELECYPODA FROM THE PHILIPPINES. 15 as Venus tiara, Dillwyn, and by Sowerby (Thes. Conch., vol. 1, 1853, pl. elviii, figs. 125, 126) also as dzara. This variety differs from the typical form of the species, as figured by Philippi, in having the concentric lamine more prominently foliated posteriorly, a groove down the dorsal slope, a little distance from the margin, cutting through the lamelle and thus forming an upper or marginal series of short Jamelle. ; GLyYcIMERIS PECrUNCULUs (Linn.), var. The single specimen in the present collection is flatter than usual, and the coste are more slender than in normal examples, and consequently the intervening grooves are broader. Another slight distinction is the absence of brown colour on the hinge-plate, a conspicuous feature in G. pectunculus and G. muskatensis, Melvill. The latter attains much larger dimensions than those given by the author of his type. Specimens in the British Museum from Muscat, presented by Dr. Jayakar, are 41 mm. high, 43 long, and 27 in diameter, in fact almost double the size of Mr. Melvill’s shell. GLYCIMERIS REEVEI (Mayer), Viertelj. Naturf. Ges. Ziirich, vol. xi, 1868, p. 23, as Pectunculus. = Pectunculus angulatus, Reeve (non Lamarck), Conch. Icon., vol. i, fig. 30. A number of young shells 16-19 mm. in length appear to be immature examples of this species. At this stage of growth the sculpture is more raised, the radiating threads and concentric stris which cross them producing a granose surface. The radiating threads are in groups of about four or five on the middle of the valves, the groups being marked off by pale striz. At the sides they are not in groups, and between them the grooves exhibit very short bristles. The colour is variable, usually light or dark brown with irregular white blotchings. Guycimeris pLanatus (G. & H. Nevill), Journ. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, vol. xlili, pt. 1, 1874, p. 29, pl. i, figs. 16, 16a, as Pectunculus. This Pecten-like species has hitherto been known only from the Andaman Islands. ‘he colour was described as ‘‘ white, mottled, and variegated with brown.” The specimens from the Philippine Islands are white spotted with red, the spots being only on the radiating ribs, and disposed in irregular concentric rows. ‘The interior is white with a faint purplish stain below the umbones down the middle of the valves. One or two of the costz on each side near the hinge- line are slender, simple, and not grooved down the middle like those on the rest of the shell. The largest specimen is 20°5 mm. in height, 21 long, 10°5in diameter. A specimen from the Andaman Islands in the British Museum is about the same size. C. DESCRIPTIONS OF THE NEW SPECIES. PsaAMMOBIA PHILIPPINENSIS, n.sp. Pl. I, Figs. 16-18. Shell transversely elongate, slightly inequilateral, anterior portion rather the longer, sharply rounded at both ends, somewhat more 16 PROCEEDINGS OF THE MALACOLOGICAL SOCIETY. acuminate behind, white with a few remote brown marks on the dorsal margins both in front and behind the umbones; both dorsal margins only slightly oblique, ventral margin little arcuate in the middle, but curving upward at both ends; valves thin, sculptured with fine growth-lines, crossed by fine threads which radiate from the umbones, the thread towards the hinder end being more distinct than those in front; upon the posterior excessively fine striz are observable which curve from the margin towards the other radiating threads ; umbones brown at the tip, inthe form of a minute glossy boss or knob of a different texture to that of the rest of the shell; interior of valves glossy white ; hinge-characters normal ; pallial sinus tongue-like, rounded at the end, not reaching quite half-way across the valves. Length 8°5, height 4°75, diameter 3mm. This species resembles P. candidula, Deshayes, somewhat in form, but it is very differently sculptured. The generic term Gari! of Schumacher is used by some authors as being anterior to Psammobia of Lamarck, but to employ a word with a genitive termination as a genus hardly seems admissible. PETRICOLA DicIraLE, n.sp. Pl. 1, Figs. 7, 8. Shell small, sub-quadrate, rather convex and inequilateral, white, slightly iridescent, thin, sculptured with excessively fine criss-cross raised threads, so that the surface presents a punctate appearance rather like a thimble; here and there at intervals shallow waves of growth are also observable; anterior end obtusely rounded, posterior broader, curvedly sub-truncate, ventral margin straightish, not much curved ; anterior dorsal edge oblique, slightly curved, posterior longer, straighter, less descending; lunular area large, defined by a distinct curved impressed line in each valve, extending from the umbo to the end of the dorsal slope; the surface, unlike the rest of the shell, for the most part exhibits lhttle punctation, but merely the most delicate growth-striz. Umbones raised a little above the hinge- margin, contiguous, smooth, with only delicate growth-strie ; three cardinal teeth in the left valve, the central one thick, A-shaped, the others oblique, one on each side divergent from the umbo; right valve with two divergent slender teeth which fall, when the shell is closed, one on each side of the central tooth of the left valve; adductor scars large, anterior pyriform, posterior a little broader ; pallial sinus large, broad, ascending high and beyond the middle of the valve, rounded at the end; hinge-ligament occupying about half the posterior dorsal margin, yellowish. Length 6, height 5°5, diameter 4mm. This shell has not the appearance of being the young of a larger form, since it is considerably convex, and rather like certain forms of Spherium or Kellia in general aspect. The surface to the naked eye appears smooth, and the punctate or thimble-like appearance of the surface is only visible under a lens. 1 From the Latin garwm, a fish-sauce, made from the fish garus. SMITH : PELECYPODA FROM THE PHILIPPINES. ul The young of P. lapicida (Chemnitz) Gmelin, has somewhat the form of this species, but the sculpture is different, being coarser, and it has no definite lunular area. A single valve from Flinders Passage, North Australia, recorded in my report on the Challenger Lamelli- branchiata, p. 118, belongs to the present species and not to P. lapicida. Dosinra supaxata, n.sp. Pl. I, Figs. 11-13. Shell subcircular, moderately convex, rather thin, white with rosy tips to the umbones, very delicately concentrically striated at first and then rather more distantly towards the base, the threads between the strize smooth upon the central part of the valves and becoming finely lamellar both anteriorly and behind; lunule elongate-cordate, prominent in the middle, fairly striated; escutcheon raised and keeled down the middle, defined by a shallow depression in each valve extending from near the umbones nearly the whole length of the posterior dorsal margin; the valves at this part consequently exhibit a narrow wing-like prominence; interior of valves whitish ; anterior adductor scar narrow, elongate, posterior pyriform; pallial sinus long, tongue-like, extending some way beyond the middle of the valves, blunt at the end; hinge normal. Length 25, height 24, diameter 11 mm. Allied to D. lucinalis, Lamarck, of which D. striatissima, Sowerby, is a synonym. The concentric sculpture of the present species, however, is finer, and it lacks the radiating strive of D. lueinalis. The form of the latter is somewhat different, being shorter in proportion to the height. ‘The pallial sinus is considerably longer in D. subalata. D. celata, Reeve, is even more closely related, and differs only in having stronger lamelle in front and behind, a larger and much deeper dorsal area marked off by asharper cristate keel, and a slightly shorter pallial sinus. Antigona (VENTRICOLA) MINDOoROENSIS, n.sp. Pl. I, Figs. 1-3. Shell sub-globose, very inequilateral, white, with four curved, sub-equidistant, reddish rays, concentrically delicately lamellated, the lamelle being thin, erect, and cross-striated on the lower side ; between the lamelle the surface exhibits fine thread-like lines, four or five in each interval, also excessively minute curved radiating strie ; lunule broadly cordiform, brown, sunken except in the middle, where it is a little raised; marked with fine raised lines of growth; escutcheon deep, defined by a sharp keel in the left valve, upon which the lamelle terminate; the portion of the escutcheon in the right valve is smaller than that of the left and less sharply defined, the lamelle extending further over towards the edge of the valve; umbones yellowish or pale brown at the smooth tips which curve forward over the lunule ; interior of the valves white outside the pallial line, very faintly tinted with a kind of flesh tint within the pallial line, which is shortly angularly sinuated; inner edge of the valves very finely crenulated all round excepting on the hinder dorsal margin, the crenulations on the edge of the lunule being finer than those on the ventral edge; anterior adductor scar ovate, posterior larger, sub-reniform. VOL. XII.—MARCH, 1916. 2 18 PROCEEDINGS OF THE MALACOLOGICAL SOCIETY. Length 30, height 28, diameter 16 mm. A specimen in the British Museum, said to come from Hong-Kong, is a little larger than the Philippine specimen, being 37 mm. long, 35 high, and 21 in diameter. V. rigida, Dillwyn, of which V. pilula, Reeve, is a synonym, in some respects resembles the present species. It is, however, rounder, more globose, differently coloured, has less erect and less delicate lamelle, and the spotting on the escutcheon, in the left valve only, is peculiar. It isa West Indian shell. Luctna EvGLyeTa, n.sp. Pl. I, Figs. 4-6. Shell irregularly rounded, inequilateral, white, concentrically finely closely lamellated and radially costate between the lamelle, which are finely frilled through crossing the coste ; valves moderately thick, with a depression marking off a wing-like portion below the straight posterior dorsal margin; lunule very small, deep, under the umbones, which are contiguous, but the tips curl away over the lunule; beyond this there is another ill-defined lunular space enclosed by a slight curved depression on the valves; there are no radiating costelle upon the hinder wing-like portion of the valves, or upon the lunular space, and consequently the concentric lamellee are simple and not frilled; interior of the valves white, with the lower margin slightly denticulated; posterior adductor scar pyriform, anterior narrow, long; dentition normal. Length 17, height 16, diameter 9 mm. This species bears some resemblance to LZ. gemma, Reeve, in respect of the wing-like hinder part of the valves. There is a great difference in the surface ornamentation of the two species. JZ. gemma has no radiating coste between the concentric lamelle, which are beautifully denticulate or serrate. It is also a much flatter species than that now described. Luctna TRANSVERSA, n.sp. Pl. I, Figs. 9, 10. Shell oblong, transverse, almost equilateral, white, concentrically finely ridged, finely yet roughly radiately striated between the concentric ridges or lire; valves rounded in front with a cristate keel behind, marking off an elongate, lanceolate escutcheon exhibiting only fine growth-lines; lunule sunken, elongate, marked with fine lines of growth ; umbones smooth at the tips, contiguous; the posterior keel, which is crested with the concentric lamelle, forms a point at the hinder end of the valves; interior white; posterior adductor scar rounded except above, where it is as if truncate; anterior scar short, irregularly ovate. Length 10°75, height 8, diameter 4°75 mm. Allied to Z. fabula, Reeve, but more closely concentrically ridged, and not so strongly or regularly striated between the ridges. There are also differences in form. GuLycIMeRIs MINDOROENSIS, n.sp. Pl. I, Figs. 14, 15.

PELECYPODA FROM THE PHILIPPINE 1S. SMITH: PELECYPODA FROM THE PHILIPPINES. 19 these are about twenty-four in number, rounded, sub-equal, excepting a few on each side near the umbones which are more slender. ‘The sulci between the ribs and the costz also are crossed by very fine crowded lamelle; the valves are rather thick, having the shorter side (that towards which the umbones incline somewhat) rather straight, the opposite end and the ventral margin being broadly curved. The interior is white, stained on the anterior side with - reddish brown; lower and lateral margins coarsely dentate ; hinge- teeth, about twelve, arranged in a curved line; anterior adductor scar roundish, posterior elongate-oval. Length 9, height 9, diameter 5-5 mm. Somewhat resembling G. hoyle’, Melvill & Standen, from Torres Straits, but with the umbones more curved over anteriorly, higher in proportion to the length, fewer and coarser hinge-teeth, the ribs are devoid of tubercles, and the concentric fine raised strive or lamelle are continuous on and between the coste. Although it is impossible to say that the shell described is adult, it does not look as if it would attain much larger dimensions. For so small a shell the hinge-plate is very thick, and the teeth are strong. The lines of growth are very crowded, and, being continuous over and between the ribs, they have a wavy appearance.

Read 14th January, 1916. PLATE II. Some time ago a collection of Mollusca from South Africa was sent me for determination by Mr. H. C. Burnup, of Maritzburg, Natal. It contained a number of ‘‘ bones’ or shells?! of cuttlefishes, the identification of which necessitated the study of all the South African forms.? Since the collection contained some new species which had to be described, it seemed it might be useful to offer at the same time some notes on all the South African forms. Although I am unable to give any account of the animals of the new species, the shells appear to possess certain constant reliable characters by which the species can be recognized.

M. d’Orbigny suggested that this species and S. hierredda of Rang are synonymous, and, judging from the shells only, I am inclined to think he was correct. Certain differences which have been described in the coloration of the animals of the two forms may not, I think, be of much importance. Sepia HIERREDDA, Rang.

Hab.—Port Elizabeth, Cape Colony, Tongaat Beach, Natal, Lagos, Guinea Coast, Sierra Leone (all Brit. Mus.); Goree, Cape of Good Hope (d’Orb. & Fér.); Goree (Rang). A large shell of this so-called species from Lagos, presented to the British Museum by Sir Alfred Moloney, is about 230 mm. in length. This form is narrow, elongate, rather pointed at the anterior end, considerably thick about the middle of the ventral side. The chitinous margin spreads over the dorsal surface at the hinder end. The back is pale down the middle, becoming very pale reddish at the sides. ‘here is scarcely any noticeable central ridge and the surface is finely granulated, the granules sometimes ranged in series following the lines of growth down the middle of the back. 1 Sepiostaire, sepium, or sepion. 2 Here limited to the coasts of Natal and Cape Colony.

Hab.— Tongaat, Natal (H. C. Burnup) ; Zanzibar (G. Pfeffer). A single shell from Tongaat agrees in every respect with the - description and figure, but is much lar ger, having a length of 255 mm. The dorsal surface, not referred to by Dr. Pfetfer, is coarsely wrinkled towards the posterior end, the wrinkling becoming gradually more feeble anteriorly. This species is remarkable for the very broad, deep central depression on the ventral side, and for the great development of the deep inner cone, which is lined with a thick calcareous deposit and has a chitinous outer covering. The yellowish chitinous margin of the shell is well developed all round, and united above, but free from the end of the inner cone, The spine is short and strong, and arises from a much thickened shelly margin. Colour white, excepting an obscure reddish ray on each side, diverging from the posterior end. Sepra acuminata, n.sp. Pl. II, Figs. 3, 4. Shell elongate elliptical, conspicuously tapering and becoming pointed anteriorly ; striated area flattish or a little concave, occupying more than half the total length, with a shallow central groove and a few faint strie radiating from the hinder end, causing the curved transverse strie to be a little wavy. Chitinous margin broad posteriorly, thinly lined with callus, which is a little thickened beneath the spine, the thickening being ridged or striated. Limbs of the inner cone thickened, united behind, forming a rounded angle, horn-colour. Spine moderate, rounded, not keeled, generally directed slightly dorsally. Dorsal surface reddish, excepting the corneous margin, having a faint central ridge, finely wrinkled and granulated. Length 103, greatest width 36, greatest thickness 9 mm. Hab.—Port Elizabeth (J. H. Ponsonby and H. A. Spencer); Tongaat Beach, Natal (H. C. Burnup). A small specimen, 35mm. in length, described by Dr. G. Pfeffer as S. venusta’ (= venustoides, Hoyle) from Zanzibar apparently closely resembles the young of this species. A specimen from Tongaat, 46 mm. in length (pl. ii, fig. 4), differs from other examples of the same size in having the chitinous margin more widely developed posteriorly, and the striated area is longer and divided into three distinct areas, one on each side, and a central one, twice as broad as the laterals. The latter are concave and separated from the central area by a keel or ridge. The striz on both lateral and central areas are elegantly curved. ' Abhandl. Naturwiss.

Sepia papillata, Quoy & Gaimard, Voy. Astrolabe, Zool., vol. ii, 1832, p. 61, atlas, pl. i, figs. 6-14. Shell elongate ovate, in adult specimens sometimes contracted somewhat anteriorly; striated area a little concave, with a median groove or depression which is faintly continued upon the last loculus ; inner cone shallow, rounded at the end, its limbs, of a pale brownish colour, reaching almost half the total length, spreading more or less, and sometimes somewhat pointedly produced posteriorly ; spine very obtuse and short, with an excavation or pit between it and the margin. The dorsal surface has a feeble central rounded ridge, with a faint depression on each side, and is finely wrinkled everywhere, excepting towards the hinder part, where the wrinkling becomes coarser. The colour of the dorsal surface is pale reddish excepting the posterior thin sides, which are whitish. Length of Quoy’s type 76 mm., width 37. Hab.—Port Elizabeth (J. H. Ponsonby and H. A. Spencer) ; Tongaat Beach, Natal (H. C. Burnup); Cape of Good Hope (Quoy & Gaimard). One of the specimens presented to the British Museum by Mr. Spencer is 134 mm. in length and 60 in width. In general structure this species resembles S. mestus, Gray,’ from Australia, but differs in the absence of the keeled spine, in the expansion of the limbs of the inner cone being more narrowly produced posteriorly, and in rather coarser dorsal wrinkling. The almost obsolete spine appears to be a constant feature both in young and old specimens. Quoy & Gaimard do not describe this feature, but it is quite possible they may have regarded it as an abnormality in their specimen, since there is no evidence that they had other examples. However, their figure 12, although somewhat crude, sufficiently shows that their shell had an obtuse spine similar to those in the series I have examined. It should be noted also that the limbs of the inner cones are rather variable. Sometimes, as in the Astrolabe figure, they do not expand much posteriorly. On the contrary, in some specimens they spread considerably, and become rather pointed posteriorly. I have given the above particulars, since the description in the Astrolabe is very superficial and incomplete. SEPIA JoUSSEAUMI, Rochebrune. Sepia jousseaumt, Rochebrune, Bull. Soc. Philom. Paris, sér. vir, Wol. wili,. 1884.<p.. 11%. Hab.—Cape of Good Hope (Rochebrune). This unfigured species is known only by the brief inadequate description. The shell or ‘sepium’, as it is termed by Steenstrup, is described as ‘‘ oyoide, atténué en avant, arrondi en arriére, a ailes large, armé en arriére d’un mucron obtus; face dorsal trés finement ' Type figured by Hoyle in Challenger Cephalopoda, pp. 123, 135. SMITH: SHELLS OF SOUTH AFRICAN SEPIID/@. 23 tuberculeuse ; face ventrale concave en arriére, devisée par un gorge médiane peu profonde, trés convexe dans la premiére moitié”’ The length of the body is given as 61 mm., and consequently the shell would be almost as long. The only other South African species which has the spine short and blunt is S. papillata. The animal of that species, however, does not agree with the description of S. jowsseaumt, since no mention is made of the occurrence of closely arranged tubercles so characteristic of S. papillata. Sepia BurNupI, Hoyle. Sepia burnupt, Hoyle, Journ. Conch., vol. xi, 1904, p. 27, pl. 1. At the above reference I am of opinion that Dr. Hoyle has included two, if not three, distinct species: (1) The form which I retain as durnupi is that figured on pl. i, figs. 188, 189. (2) Figs. 190, 191 represent a second species or possibly the female of the above. (3) Fig. 192 is a third species having several distinguishing features. The above conclusions have been arrived at through the study of a further series of specimens sent by Mr. Burnup. These I submitted to Dr. Hoyle, and he writes ‘‘ I agree with you that there are three forms”, but he definitely considers No. 2 the female of No. 1, which I now regard as the type of burnupt. He may be right in his conjecture, but until the animals are known it is a case of uncertainty, and therefore I have suggested a distinctive name for this form in the meantime. No. 1. Sepia purnupr, Hoyle. PI. Il, Fig Sepia burnupt, Hoyle, partim, pl. i, figs. 188, 189. This form has the central groove in the ventral surface con- spicuously deep, and the marginal limbs are very prominent and closer together. Between them and the outer chitinous margin the surface exhibits very peculiar curved indented striz, which are not present in No. 2 (cncerta). The spine is only slightly recurved. The dorsal surface exhibits a central raised fillet, not very strongly defined, and marked with transverse wrinkles or lines of growth. It is of rosaceous tint, excepting the sides anteriorly, which are covered with yellowish epidermis. Largest specimen (probably not adult) 61 mm. in length, 13 in width. Hab.—Tongaat Beach, Natal (H. C. Burnup). No. 2. Sepra mcerra, n.sp. Pl. II, Fig. 6. Sepia burnupi, Hoyle, partim, pl. 1, figs. 190, 191. The central groove on the ventral surface is not so deep as in S. burnupi (No. 1), and the marginal limbs are wider apart. They converge to a sharp point, form a “distinct inner cone, and are united to the chitinous margin of the outer cone. The space between the marginal limbs of the inner cone and the outer chitinous margin is quite smooth, and not striated as in burnupt. The spine is more distinctly curved towards the dorsal surface than in durnup?. This surface has a conspicuous rosy central stripe, from end to end, much 24 PROCEEDINGS OF THE MALACOLOGICAL SOCIBLY. more defined than in durnupz, and the central fillet ismore prominent.

This species is of the same form as S. incerta, but is peculiar in haying the marginal limbs of the inner cone quite lateral, the surface on each side the central ventral groove regularly convex, and a different kind of striation. Another distinguishing feature is the presence of longitudinal strize (fig. 8) down the middle of the dorsal surface. These are particularly strong towards the posterior end of the largest specimen examined, but they continue the whole length of the central fillet. ‘he dorsal rosy stripe is narrower in this species than in incerta. The character of the inner and outer cone, also of the spine, is similar to that of S. encerta. Largest specimen, if perfect, would measure 130 mm. in length and 19 in width.

Hab.— Agulhas Bank (Q. & G.); Port Elizabeth (H. C. Burnup). The name S. senope was substituted by Gray for the 8S. australis, Q. & G. (non @’Orb.), and he quoted a single imperfect shell in the British Museum collection which was labelled ‘‘ China”. No information concerning its acquirement is attached to the specimen, and consequently in all probability the locality cannot be relied upon. It certainly belongs to the present species. This is one of the smallest South African forms, and the shell is not likely to be confounded with that of any other species. It is very flat, very acuminate posteriorly, gradually widening towards the middle and then gently narrowing towards the rounded anterior end. The ventral side exhibits a conspicuous central groove which broadens in front. There is also a depression on each side near the lateral margins, so that the surfaces may be said to exhibit three furrows, one central and two lateral. The dorsal surface has a distinct central cretaceous ridge marked off by a shallow depression on each side. The surface is then smooth and somewhat glossy, except towards the lateral margins, which appear to have a yellowish epidermal covering. The smooth areas and the lateral portions of the surface exhibit delicate yet distinct lines of growth. A remark- able characteristic feature, not noticed in any of the descriptions, SMITH: SHELLS OF SOUTH AFRICAN SEPIIDA. 25 is the presence of a short acute dorsal keel adjoining the delicate terminal spine. It is situated upon the centre of the curved hinder portion of the shell. The limbs of the small inner cone are thread- like and quite close to the outer margin. The name Sepia capensis, according to d’Orbigny, was employed by him in 1826, six years before S. australis was described by Quoy - and Gaimard. Since, however, no confirmation of that statement could be found Dr. Hoyle! upholds the latter name, at the same time changing the S. australis, founded by d@’Orbigny upon an Australian form, to Sepia nove-hollandia. Sepia insiIenis, n.sp. Pl. II, Fig. 10. Shell elongate, acutely pointed in front, rounded at the posterior end, which is surrounded by a very broad chitinous margin, extending along the sides more than half the length of the shell; the calcareous portion is white beneath but pinkish dorsally ; the test is thin, with a narrow ventral groove obliquely striated on each side, then longitudinally obtusely ridged, the strie being continued over the ridges, forming an angle, and then extending to the chitinous margin, but being interrupted posteriorly by the limbs of the inner cone. ‘These converge to a small rounded end over the moderately deep inner cone, where the cross-strie are remarkably conspicuous. The dorsal side is curved, obtusely keeled or angled down the middle, and besides delicate lines of growth it exhibits a fine wrinkling posteriorly and very delicate granulation elsewhere. There is no terminal spine,’ the end being merely a pale rounded boss. Length 26, diam. 8mm. Hab.—Tongaat Beach, Natal (H. C. Burnup). The two specimens examined agree in every detail, but whether they are the young stage of a species which attains larger dimensions is uncertain. However, the form is so remarkable that I have not hesitated to describe it as new. Hemisepivus typicus, Steenstrup. Hemisepius typicus, Steenstrup, Dansk. vidensk. Selsk.

He also mentions the fact that in the catalogue of the collection, in Dutch, the Cape of Good Hope is given as the locality of the specimens. D’Orbigny has considered Lamarck’s S. tuberculata the same as S. papillata of Quoy & Gaimard, but it seems to me doubtful whether they even belong to the same genus, and it is possible that S. tuberculata may even be identical with the preceding species (Hemisepius typicus). Sepia affinis, @Orbigny,' is not a Sepia, but evidently belongs to the genus Seproteuthis, and although said by d’Orbigny and others to be the same as Sepioteuthis sepordea (Blainville, 1825), itis not likely to be identical considering the remoteness of the localities—West Indies and South Africa.

By Yom Irepate. Read 12th November, 1915. Tae names here dealt with are such as have attracted special attention while determining Mollusca from Lord Howe Island in connexion with Kermadec and Norfolk Island forms. Complications have ensued so that it seems convenient to expound some of my solutions herewith. I am very gratified at the continuation of the criticism, in correspondence as well as in print, of my previous notes by Dr. Dall, M. Cossmann, and Mr. Hedley. It is my custom to acknowledge the work of such, and I would here record the fact that a paper by Dr. Dall on the ‘‘ Orthaulax pugnax Zone”’, published ‘‘ Jan. 21, 1915”, was not received in England, owing to the unusual conditions existing, until the first week in September, 1915. Consequently notes written and published by me long after the first date do not mention this paper, while I was dealing with names that occurred init. The points wherein my conclusions differ from those arrived at by Dr. Dall wiil be considered later. It is necessary to make this apology, since all systematic malacologists are so deeply indebted to Dr. Dall’s writings, whether his conclusions be absolutely accepted or otherwise. I have received one criticism of my previous notes in which the advice was tendered to ‘‘ go slow”? and lessen the risk of proposing synonyms. I might remark that in cases such as are hereafter set out it is quite impossible to do otherwise than ‘‘9o slow’, though, in the present chaotic state of classification, that does not obviate the chance of creating unacceptable names. It is only by the co-operation of other workers, through the publica- tion of incomplete notes, that the truth can be arrived at in very complex cases. ANARITHMA, Nov. gen. From a dredging made by Mr. Roy Bell in 15-20 fath. off Lord Howe Island I sorted out some half-dozen shells whose beauty greatly pleased me: my tentative attachment was ‘‘ Colwmbella sensu latissimo’’, with distinct leanings towards the Turride. Mr. Edgar A. Smith generously helped me in the same manner as when dealing with many other shells, and I now record the results of our search. It was found that owing to its peculiarities the shell had received (at least) s¢x specific names, three writers assigning it to Columéella, one ‘to Cythara, one to Mitra, and one to Clavatula. Following up its history I found it had been placed, at various times, under no less than thirteen genera or sub-genera. It correlates with no known genus at all well, hence I allot it one for itself. Before taking this action, many generic names had to be considered, and I give notes on these to receive criticism. It had better first be stated that the genus name is proposed for the shell commonly known as ‘‘ Columbella lachryma, Gaskoin’’, 28 PROCKEDINGS OF THE MALACOLOGICAL SOCIETY. which I consider conspecific with Clavatula metula, Hinds, and my conclusions will be quickly followed by the synonymy here given :— ANARITHMA METULA (Hinds).

The wanderings of the names from genus to genus may be recorded individually in chronological order. Since Hind’s metula was described from a private museum, it was probably inaccessible to most workers. Hence Reeve copied Hind’s figure, but placed it in his genus Plewrotoma, sp. 288, Noy. 1845, not recognizing it as his Mitra lachryma just previously figured. Tryon, again, copied Reeve’s figure when he placed it in Mlangilia (Man. Conch., vol. vi, 1884, p. 269, pl. xvi, fig. 59), the figure gaining no accuracy in the process. H. & A. Adams, in the Gen. Rec. Moll., vol. 1, 1853, p. 96, placed metula in Defrancia, and Mitra lachryma, p. 178, in Zurricula (Pusia). The unique type of metula was later acquired by the British Museum, and from the study of it Pace (Proc. Malac. Soc., vol. v, 1902, p. 106, April) classed it with the Columbellidee, but without any note as to its identity. I believe this is the first time it has been recognized as conspecific with ‘‘ lachryma” As indicated above, Reeve described a Dhtra and later a Columbella under the same specific name ‘‘lachryma’’. It appears probable that Gaskoin, to whom the latter name was accredited, had recognized the Reevean Jhira in a shell in the Cuming Collection, and Reeve was ignorant of this fact. Chenu was the first to place it in Colombella [sic], and of course, not concerned with Clavatula and Mitra, gave it a new specific name ‘‘pamila”. Pease, ignorant of the preceding history, called it Cythara garrettii when he procured it at the Sandwich Islands, this being the first locality ascertained. Carpenter, in the Proc. Zool. Soc., 1865, p. 516, wrote a note upon Pease’s manuscript (?) names, observing $ Clithara] garrett is a Mitrella”. I have great respect for the accuracy displayed by Car penter, and cannot understand how he should have blundered so badly in this instance, since Pease’s names had been published in the IREDALE: NEW AND OLD MOLLUSCAN GENERIC NAMES. 29 same journal in 1860. Dunker described Anachis pustola, comparing it with C. garrettii, Pease, and almost immediately afterwards Schmeltz (Mus. Godeff. Cat., v, Feb. 1874, p. 127) synonymized both C. pusivla, Dkr., and C. garrettii, Pse., with Columbella lacryma[ sie], Gaskoin. Hervier made a detailed study of this shell and its relations, writing : ‘Elle parait étre le type d’un petit groupe intéressant, caractérisé par son galbe spécial, son mode de sculpture, et la conformation de son ouverture.’ He describes three varieties: of ‘‘ abbreviata’’ he notes, ‘Cette forme serait-elle le C. puszola, Dunker, ou méme le C. linigera, Duclos? Je mai pu m’en convaincre’’; and of ‘‘nztescens,”’ ‘‘ Cette forme correspond-elle au C. gracilis, Reeve, des iles Fidji, qui parait décrite et figurée sur un échantillon jeuné?’’ Hethen added a species C. sublachryma, with a variety spherica. I have studied the figure of C[olombella] linigera, Chenu, Illust. Conch., 1846, pl. xvii, figs. 13-14, and would not associate it with this species, but believe it is referable to another shell also recovered from these Lord Howe 15-20 fathom dredgings, which is a true Zafra. I will elaborate this point later. I have not found a C. gracilis, Reeve, and conclude Hervier referred to Citharopsis gracilis, Pease (Amer. Journ. Conch., vol. iv, Nov. 3, 1868, p. 97, pl. xi, fig. 20: Paumotus). The figure appears to be drawn from an adult specimen which should be classed under Seminella. I would record Tryon’s remark under C|olwmbella | gracilis, Pease (Man. Conch., vol. v, 1888, p. 167): ‘‘ Pretty constant in form, but varying in sculpture and coloring. Pease described it from a not perfectly adult specimen. Dunker described the adult under the name of C. pustola. A portion of the original set of the latter species is before me. Mr. Garrett believed C. pustola to = C. lachryma, Gaskoin.’’ ‘There is little close affinity between “* CO. lachryma” and “ C. gracilis”, so I at present cannot understand Tryon’s note. However much ‘‘lachryma”’ varies—and there is a considerable amount of limited variation—it is an easily recognizable shell. As Hervier noted, it is marked by a striking facies. It has, however, been referred to several groups, and these need consideration. When Pace reviewed Columbelloid names (Proc. Malac. Soc., vol. v, April, 1902) he observed much confusion in connexion with the names Citharopsis, Pease, and Seminella, Pease, and concluded, p. 42, ‘‘ It will be best, in my opinion, to restrict the name Citharopsis to the very distinct group of C. dachryma (Rve.), which species is one of those enumerated by Pease, and Seminella to the group of C. troglodytes, Sow.’’; and p. 44, ‘“‘If C. lachryma (Rve.) is correctly referred to the Columbellide, Cantraine’s Iitra olivotdea must accompany it. . . the columella folds are unlike those of Jhtra, and resembles rather the peculiar split tooth which is met with in so many Columbellide.” I do not conclude from this that Pace considered C. lachryma (Rve.) congeneric with Mitra olivoidea, Cantraine; the latter is the type of Mitrolumna, Bucquoy, Dollfus, & Dautzenberg, and I would not place ‘‘ lachryma”’ in the same genus, and in this opinion Mr. E. A. Smith agrees. It was probably due to Pace’s comments that Hedley 30 PROCEEDINGS OF THE MALACOLOGICAL SOCIETY. wrote (Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S.W., vol. xxxviii, 1918, pp. 824-5) when advocating the usage of Zafra, A. Adams: ‘‘This genus has been neglected and misunderstood. ... Here H. Adams referred anew species, Zafra pupoidea, thereby misleading Nevill, Fischer, and Tryon to transfer Zafra to the Pleurotomide, with Z. pupoidea for type. But H. Adams emphasized his own error by noting that Seminella of Pease [type Columbella garretti, Tryon] was equivalent to Zafra. Another name for ‘the minute ribbed Columbellide occurring in the Indo-Pacific region is Cvtharopsis, Pease, type Columbella lachryma, Reeve (Mitra lachryma, Reeve, 1845 = Columbella pamila, Chenu, 1848)’.” Hedley then gave a list of Australian shells he proposed to refer to Zafra, and on p. 3828 introduced a new sub-genus Retizafra, with Pyrene gemmulifera, Hedley, as type. This necessitated the investigation of Seminella and Citharopsis. In the Amer. Journ. Conch., vol. ui, Jan. 2, 1868, p. 2338, Pease wrote: ‘‘A group of small shells inhabit Polynesia, represented by Cithara ornata, Pse., varia, Pse., ete., which have been referred by Dr. Carpenter to the genus Anachis, A. Ad. Species also occur on West Coast of America and in the West Indies, which differ but slightly from the Polynesian. Perfect specimens are rarely met with. Having collected a few of each species, I find they present the following characters: Smooth, shining, colours sometimes iridescent, more or less closely ribbed longitudinally, and striated transversely ; ribs continuous; aperture narrow, outer and inner lips denticulate or lyrate within, inner lip bordered by a slight callosity, outer lip sinuated at or near its junction with the body-whorl. ‘The denticu- lations are often worn off, and the sinus is shallowed or entirely disappears, as the edge of the lipis sharp and thin.” p. 234: ‘‘T agree with Dr. Carpenter that they should be classed with Columbelline, but not with Anachis, A. Ad., which appears to be a conglomerate genus. C. muser, pacifica, etc., are not very closely related to the strongly-ribbed Panamic forms, nor to the small iridescent species of Polynesia. I would therefore propose that the latter should be separated under the name of Seminella.”’ Apparently no Cithara ornata had been described by Pease, but Cythara varia, Pease, had been published in the Proc. Zool. Soc., 1860, p. 147. Consequently this species, by monotypy, became the type of Seminella. Carpenter, in the Proc. Zool. Soc., 1865, p. 516, observed ‘‘ C[ithara] varia, Pse., is probably an Anachis = Columbella virginea, Gld. (from type)’. In a well-known work quoted as the ‘‘ Donum Bismarckianum ”’, 1871, the name was changed. In the introduction it is recorded that part of this appeared as a paper by Langkavel alone in the Programm Friedrichs-Werderschen Gymnasium. I had not seen this quoted, and found it was not available in the British Museum (Natural History) Library. I indicated my want to Mr. Alexander Reynell, who is becoming famed for his craft in securing rare conchological works, and in this case he immediately procured a copy, from which, by his permission, I make the following notes. In April, 1871, there IREDALE: NEW AND OLD MOLLUSCAN GENERIC NAMES. 31 appeared in the Programm Friedrichs-Werderschen Gymnasium the article by Langkavel alone on a collection of South Sea shells. This article ran into 85 pages, accompanied by 4 plates with explanation. The first 24 pages are exactly the same as those of the better known “Donum Bismarckianum’’, but in the latter reprint 48 additional pages appear instead of only 11. That is, the 85 pages of the Programm have in the ‘‘ Donum” been extended to 67. The 4 plates are the same, absolutely, but in the only copy of the Programm seen these are uncoloured, whereas they are coloured in the ‘* Donum”’. All the figures therefore date from the Programm as well as the first 24 pages; the majority of the rest of the matter is, of course, novel in the ‘‘Donum”’. This note is here interposed because in the Programm, p- 28, Langkavel proposed the new name ‘‘ Columbella (Seminella) Peaset, nobis. Cythara varia, Pease, P.Z.S., 1860, p. 147. Seminedla, v., Pse., A. J. C., iii, 1867, 233, 234”. This change was made on account of the prior Columbella varia, Sowerby, 1832. On the same page was recorded Columbella (Séminella) lacrima [sic], Gaskoin, Cythara garrett, Pse., being given as synonym. Figures of both these species appear on pl. i, figs. 17, 18, but unfortunately they are not very good. No reference to Columbella virginea, Gould, was made by Langkavel. Tryon (Man. Conch., vol. v, 1883, p. 245) included both species in Columbella, using peasei as the specific name of the former, and, apparently ignorant of Carpenter’s note, also included (p. 180) Columbella virginea, Gould, remarking that the type was probably lost. It seems that fortunately such is not the case, but, anyhow, in the British Museum there is preserved a specimen of virginea, Gould, received direct from Gould by Cuming, and therefore a paratype ; this authentic specimen agrees exactly with authentic specimens, probably types, of Pease’s C. varia in the same collection. Columbella virginea was described by Gould in the Proc. Bost. Soc. Nat. Hist., vol. vii, Sept. 1860, p. 335: China seas; and a tedious search for priority is obviated by the fact that there is a prior Colombella | sic| virginea, Duclos, Monogr. Colomb., 1840, pl. ii, figs. 15, 16. At present I regard Seminella as a well-marked generic group. Apparently further considering the matter, Pease, in the same Journal (vol. iv, pt. 3, Nov. 3, 1868, p. 97), correctly proposed ‘‘Citharopsis, nov. gen. Description. T. parva, fusiformi, longitudinaliter costata, nitida, interdum iridescente ; labro superne emarginato, intus lirato aut denticulato; apertura angusta. Remarks. I establish the above genus to include a group of small, bright shining species, resembling Anachis in the character of their aperture and in being longitudinally ribbed or partially so, and Cithara in general shape and emargination of outer lip. Mr. Cuming has placed one species with the Tritons (7. pusillus, Pse.). Mr. Gaskoin attached the name of Columbella lachryma to another; Dr. Carpenter connects them with Anachis, and I have described several as Cithara. They evidently belong to the Columbellide ”’. Two species were then described, Citharopsis ornata, p. 97, pl. xi, fig. 49, from Tahiti, and C. gracilis, p. 97, pl. xi, fig. 20, from the Paumotus. = 4 PROCEEDINGS OF THE MALACOLOGICAL SOCIETY. Tryon, in the Man. Conch., vol. v, 1883, p. 168, ranged the species under Columbella, renaming Cutharopsts ornata, Pse., Columbella garrettii, Tryon. This name has been accepted, but it was invalid on account of Cythara garretti, asynonym of C. lachryma, Reeve. Again, authentic specimens of Citharopsis ornata, Pse., are preserved in the British Museum, and these are absolutely true Zafra, and have even been determined as variants of troglodytes, Souverbie. Further, there is a prior Cytharopsis, A. Adams, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 11, vol. xv, April 1, 1865, p. 322. C. gracilis, Pse., as noted above, I determine to be a true Seminella. The only other species mentioned in relation with Citharopsis, viz. T(riton) pusillus, Pse., may be here commented upon. This shell was described in the Proc. Zool. Soc., 1860, p. 434, as Zrzton pusilla from the Sandwich Islands, the type being preserved in the British Museum in the Cuming Collection. ‘Tryon, in the Man. Conch., vol. iii, 1881, p- 31, ranged it under Zrzton in the sub-genus Hpidromus, and on pl. xvi, tig. 156, gave a figure, observing, ‘‘ Figured from a typical example in Coll. Acad. Phila.” Mr. J. R. Le B. Tomlin, identifying shells received from the Sandwich Islands, showed me this species, and IT immediately recognized it as one of my puzzling forms. It very rarely occurred in this Lord Howe dredging, and also rarely as a sub-littoral shell at Norfolk Island. When looking up Chenu I observed the same species as C| olombella| zsomella, Illust. Conch., 1846, pl. ix, figs. 7-8, and Mr. Tomlin has told me he has made, independently, the same determination. It is curious to quote Tryon’s remarks concerning this species (vol. v, p. 173)—‘‘ The present species may possibly be a small Pleurotomoid.”’ The variation displayed by this species appears to be great, as I suggest all the shells from Lifu are conspecific, though Hervier differentiated these into three species with many varieties as follows in the Journ. de Conch., vol. xlvii, 1899, p. 358, Columbella lifouana, pl. xiii, fig. 6: Lifu. p. 359, var. a, rufolineata, and p. 360, var. B, intermissa. Onp. 360, Columbella isomella, Duclos, with p. 361, var. a, transversa, var. B, subfelina, pl. xii, fig. 7, and p. 362, var. y, notata. On p. 362, Columbella striatula, Dunker, with p. 363, vars. «a, sulphurea, B, rubtcunda, 1, subcarnea, 6, lineolata, and e, immaculata. It is possible that there may be more than one species, but as my few specimens also show variation I conclude we have here a very variable species. I propose to designate this generically by the new name :— ZAFRONA, Nov. gen. and name Colombella [sic] «isomella, Duclos, as type. I think C. burnupt, KH. A. Smith (Journ. Conch., vol. x, Oct. 1, 1901, p. 112, pl. i, fig. 2: Natal), is congeneric, and I note it is there recorded ‘¢The radula is columbelloid”’. I hope later to deal in detail with the species referable to the above- named genera, but would observe that Zafra seems easily limited, though the species vary in size, sculpture, and shape. Thus some are very small, 2 mm., to comparatively large, 5 mm., from slender to IREDALE: NEW AND OLD MOLLUSCAN GENERIC NAMES, oO obese, and from closely sculptured to almost smooth. Hedley’s beautiful figures and descriptions in the Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S.W., vol. xxxix, pt. 4, 1915, pp. 740-5, pl. Ixxxiii, figs. 68-72, 74, 75, 77, of typical Zafra ‘should enable the easy recosnition of this genus. I am doubtful about the inclusion of Pyrene lurida, and have written to Mr. Hedley for his further opinion. I, however, have not the least doubt in rejecting Columbella abyssicola, Brazier, from this association. Mr. Hedley has furnished splendid illustrations of this shell in the Proc. Linn. Soc. N S.W., vol. xxxii, Oct. 25, 1907, pl. xix, figs. 40-3, and these show the generic characters of quite another group, of which I have a magnificent species in these same dredgings. Other smooth ‘‘ Columbelloids”’ I will treat at a later opportunity, but would just summarize this note as follows :— Genus ANARITHMA, nov. gen.—Here proposed for Clavatula metula, Hinds. MHervier has added other species to this group, which I will later discuss. It must be repeated that these are preliminary notes published for the sake of criticism, and later I will develop any points indicated. Genus Zarra, A. Adams.— Hedley has discussed this at the places quoted previously, and I have noted minor points where we differ for further consideration. Cutharopsts, Pease (not Cytharopsis, A. Adams), is an absolute synonym. Genus SEMINELLA, Pease.—T ype, Seminella varia (Pease). I consider this a well-marked group, which I will elaborate later. For the purpose of criticism I would cite as members Columbella leta, Brazier, Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S.W., vol. i, 1877, p. 232, and Zafra purpurea, H. Adams, Proc. Zool. Soc., 1873, p. 206, pl. xxiii, fig. 3. Genus Rerizarra, Hedley.—I think, in view of the complexity of these small ‘‘ Columbelloids’’, it would be best to at once consider Retizafra as a genus. Through all the variation of Zafra no close approach to these reticulate shells is found, and as we might proceed almost directly from Zafra into Seminella, and thence to Euplica, while on the other hand we can grade into a quite smooth shell, I cannot demonstrate a subgeneric value for Letizafra. Euplica was provided by Dall (Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool. (Harv.), vol, xviii, June, 1889, p. 187) with Columbella turturina, Duclos, as type. To this genus belongs Columbella versicolor, Sowerby, though this shell has been commonly classed in the same sub-genus as C. tylert, Gray, which I refer to Pyrene. I will elahonate the relationships of this species later, as I have to deal completely with all the above-named species. Genus ZaFRona, nov. gen.—Introduced for Columbella vsomella, Duclos. The forms at present ranged by me under this name will be reviewed later, as will most of the other species referred to previously. This note may appear lengthy, but I have endeavoured to limit my remarks to the generic names concerned, and I will fully review the species when I ‘later report on the collections named. Only one further point will I touch on now, and that is the family name. I maintain it should be called Pyrenide, not Columbellidz, while VOL. XII.—MARCH, 1916. 3 34 PROCEEDINGS OF THE MALACOLOGICAL SOCIETY. I agree with Dall and Hedley that Pyrene is a distinct genus from Columbella. I have been questioned as to my argument, the only rule in this connexion reading ‘‘ The name of a family is formed by adding the ending -7de ... to the root of the name of its type genus”. ‘I'he only type genus of a family I can recognize is the oldest genus admitted in the family. The selection of any other would cause as much confusion as there is in recognizing the type species of a genus at present, and give rise to even more complications. TRIVIA. In these Proceedings, vol. vili, 1909, p. 288 et seq., H.O. N. Shaw gave some ‘‘ Notes on the genera Cyprea and Trivia”. These notes were of special value as therein was accepted the fact that the ‘“‘Descr. Cat. Shells by J. E. Gray’, usually quoted as of 1832, was never published at that date, but only existed in proof. Shaw endeavoured to trace the first publication of the new species generally credited to the above-named Catalogue. There is, and always will be, great difficulty in fixing the first user of a manuscript name, when such name has been made commonly available to all contemporary workers. Consequently I now show that most of the data, as regards generic names, provided by Shaw, must be amended, but do not suggest my own results are final. These must be regarded as simply stepping-stones, and my facts are open to further correction as soon as published. Thus, according to Shaw, Zuponta and Trivia dated from the Conchological Manual of Sowerby, 1839 ; Arzecafrom H. & A. Adams, 1854; and aria from Gray, 1857. I had noted Luponia occurred in Sowerby’s Conch. Illus., Cypreeadee| sve], p. 12, published in Nov.—Dec. 1837, when I referred to the Penny Cyclopedia, vol. viii, and found that Broderip monographed the Cypreide on pp. 254-9, and that his account was based on Gray’s ‘‘Descr. Cat.” Broderip wrote: ‘‘Mr. Gray, whose arrangement we select, as being, in our opinion, the best which has hitherto appeared.” ‘This article was published in June, 1837, or earlier, so that the above four generic or subgeneric names date from here as they all occur in this essay. On p. 255 Cyprea is subdivided into sub-genera, the sub-genus Cyprea being accompanied by two illustrations, one of Cyprea childrent, Gray, with figs. a, bin text, loc. (?); and the other of Cyprea adamsoniu, Gray, two figures in text, from Pacific Ocean (?). On the same page the sub-genus Ardea was proposed with species Cyprea guttata, moneta, ete. On p. 256 the sub-genus Marta appears with only Cyprea irrorata, Gray, described from South Seas with two figures in text. Again, the genus Zuponia is defined (p. 256) with only the species Luponia algoensis, figured and described, followed by genus Cypreovula, with C. capensis alone. ‘Then comes the genus Trivia, which is divided into four sections : Section a, 7rivia carnea, fig. 2 in text and described. B, europea 4p 5 \") pediculus 3 fe é, pustulata _,, 5 IREDALE: NEW AND OLD MOLLUSCAN GENERIC NAMES. 35 In the Proc. Zool. Soc., 1847, p. 142, Gray designated as type of his own genus Zrivia, Cyprea europea. Consequently we retain Trivia in its accepted usage. It is possible that the specialist will find it worth while to examine this article carefully, and I note that Trivia carnea may be sanguinea, but no change seems necessary in the species-names as given by Shaw. I, at present, am only concerned with Zrivia, which I now quote as of Broderip, Penny Cyclopedia, vol. villi, June, 1837, p. 256 (ex Gray MS.). I would add that the Natural History articles contained in the Penny Cyclopedia were reprinted under the name English Cyclopedia, edited by C. Knight, who had the articles brought up to date. In this case the article Cyprzide appears in Natural History, vol. i, 1854, coll. 281-9, but nothing of importance is appended in this later publication. Lamsis, Bolten, 1798. I would just note that the type of this genus, by tautonymy, would be Z. dambis, which appears to bea form of the shell known as Pterocera lambis, and consequently Lambis would displace Pterocera, Lamarck, which dates from 1799. Doyxerta, Carpenter. This name was introduced as a sub-genus of Chemnitzia by Carpenter in the Cat. Mazatlan Shells, B.M., 1857, p. 483, with the diagnosis ‘‘ Chemnitzia, anfractibus tumidis, decussatis”. No type was named and four species were attached, viz. D. paucilirata, sub- angulata, cancellata, and intermedia. Fischer (Man. Conch., p. 790, Aug. 31, 1885) ranked Dunkerva as a sub-genus of Zurbonilla, naming D. paucilirata as example. This is not type designation according to the International Rules, but in the Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., vol. xvii, Feb. 5, 1904, p. 8, Dall and Bartsch definitely named as type the first species, as Fischer had selected. ‘he Rules read, ‘‘Such designation is not subject to change,’”’ but the same authors in the U.S. Nat. Mus, Bull. 68, Dec. 13, 1909, p. 12, gave as type D. subangulata, the explanation for their action being given on p. 120 as follows :— ‘“* Doctor Carpenter, after diagnosing Dunkeria laminata (Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., 1865, p. 396), writes: ‘This beautiful Fenelloid species may be regarded as the type of the group of Dunkeria.’ Unfortu- nately this species was not included in the original list, hence cannot serve as type for the group. We had selected the first species, Dunkeria paucilirata, of the four cited by Carpenter in his Mazatlan Catalogue, for the type in our Synopsis of the Genera, Subgenera, and Sections of the Family Pyramidellide. Since then we have seen Doctor Carpenter’s material in the British Museum, and we find that Dunkeria paucilirata is a Pyrgisculus, and that the second species, Dunkeria subangulata, resembles D. laminata in form and sculpture, and this bears out the author’s intent of typifying the group. D. cancellata must be removed to Pyrgisculus and D. intermedia to Evalina.”’ The argument here presented is not valid, and since I drew up 36 PROCEEDINGS OF THE MALACOLOGICAL SOCIETY. this note Dr. Bartsch has kindly written me ‘‘to carefully note... the rules . . . and to hold to them absolutely rigidly’. It is some- what unfortunate that my first instance of the rigid application of the Rules should be in connexion with one of Dr. Bartsch’s own rulings. I, however, would remedy this matter by proposing BartscHELLA, nov. gen. with Dunkeria subangulata, Carpenter, as type. On Dall & Bartsch’s conclusions, Dunkerta would replace Pyrgisculus, while Barischella will come into use for the group Dunkeria, Dall and Bartsch, 1909. A matter of dates may here be stated. In quoting Dunkeria I observed that Dall & Bartsch wrote ‘‘ Cat. Mazatlan Shells, 1856”. In the Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus., vol. xlix, July 24, 1915, p. 34, Bartsch has explained this, writing: ‘‘ His report, Catalogue of the Collection of Mazatlan Shells in the British Museum, was published in parts during the years 1855-1857, the part dealing with our genus appearing in 1856.” This is not quite correct, so that it seems necessary to publish the facts at once in order to avoid complications later. In the Cat. Lib. Brit. Mus. (Nat. Hist.), vol. 1, 1908, p. 318, under ‘Carpenter (P. P.), an edition published at Warrington is recorded with the dates ‘‘ 1855-57’. his, however, is only a re-issue of the London edition with a new title-page and preface, and the dates 1855-7 are therefore wrongly given. It was published later than the London edition, and the dates only refer to the proof-sheets, not to publication. The Mazatlan Catalogue was ‘‘ Printed by P. P. Carpenter, Oberlin Press, Warrington”’, but was published in one item by the British Museum authorities after June, 1857. A preface was written by John Edward/Gray, signed ‘‘April 22,1857”. The first sheet bears the signature ‘“ July 1855 b”, the second *‘ Aug. 1855 c”’, the third ‘‘ Aug. 1855 d”’, and so on, the last bearing ‘‘ June 1857 yy”’. The signatures have been mistaken by Bartsch for dates of publication, but Carpenter, on p. 546, wrote, ‘‘The proof-sheets of this work having been submitted to several naturalists, and fresh sources of information having been obtained during its progress, the following errors have been discovered and additions made.” Exvusa, A. Adams. Elusa was proposed by A. Adams in the Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 11, vol. vii, April, 1861, p. 297, with only species #. teres. He later included in the genus his Pyramidella subulata of the Thes. Conch., vol. 11, 1855, p. 815, pl. elxxii, fig. 13; Proc. Zool. Soc., May 16, 1855, p. 177, pl. xx, fig. 6. This species was erroneously given as the example by Fischer (Man. de Conch., p. 787, Aug. 31, 1885). This error prejudiced writers such as Hedley, Smith, and Melvill, who utilized Llusa for subulata. It escaped the notice of these writers that A. Adams had been anticipated in his selection of Elusa by Walker in the List Spec. Lepid. Insects, B.M., pt. xvi, p. 202, 1858. IREDALE: NEW AND OLD MOLLUSCAN GENERIC NAMES. 3d I am publishing this note to draw attention to the fact that Dall & Bartsch (Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., vol. xvii, Feb. 5, (1904, p. 5) have provided as substitute for this misusage of Hlusa the name Tropxas, Dall & Bartsch, introduced for Pyramidella subulata, A. Adams. They did not explain that Hlusa was typified by £. teres, which. they considered generically distinct from the former, nor that Hlusa was also invalid. In the U.S. Nat. Mus., Bull. 68, Dec. 13, 1909, pp. 28-9, they did, however, place Hlusa as an absolute synonym of Turbonilla, without, however, adding any remarks. In the meanwhile the misusage of Hlusa has been continued by Melvill, Schepman, and Hedley, and it is to prevent the further perpetuation of this error that I have given this explanation. NOTE ON THE OLIGOCENE OF TAMPA, FLORIDA, THE PANAMA CANAL ZONE, AND THE ANTILLIAN REGION. By Wittum He Darn, Se)... GL. D: Read 10th December, 1915. Tue line dividing the Oligocene from the Miocene in Europe is less distinct than in America, and the particular horizon at which it should be drawn has long been a subject of controversy between Continental paleontologists. In his comparative study of the fossils of Martinique and Panama,' M. Cossmann, in referring them to the Miocene, acknowledges (p. 3) that this conclusion is not final, and that it is possible that his views might be modified. Nevertheless, in a recent criticism of my monograph of the ‘’ampa fauna,* in the Revue Critique de Paléozoologie, 1915, p. 119, he takes me severely to task for adopting a different view. In general it is of very slight importance by what name we call a fauna provided that it is clear how we define it, and in my introduction to the Miocene volume of the Maryland Geological Survey I have shown that the typical Miocene (Chesapeake) of Kastern America is to be correlated with the Miocene of North Germany and Denmark, and not with the warm-water Miocene of South Europe. Our warm-water Miocene of Virginia and the Carolinas (Yorktown) may be the equivalent of the latter, but it is absent in Florida, where a faunal abyss separates the typical Chesapeake Miocene from the uppermost Oligocene of the Alum Bluff and Oak Grove horizon. Ordinarily I do not consider that it is well to enter into controversy upon matters of opinion, as time usually settles such questions to the general satisfaction, but when statements of fact are concerned it is not advisable to leave errors uncorrected lest the reader of them may be misled. In the review in question certain statements are made which require correction. The geological Tertiary column in the Floridian region is very complete, and ties up with the Panama and Antillian Tertiary absolutely, so far as the correlation between the horizon represented by the Orthaulax pugnax zone of Tampa is concerned. ‘lhere is no doubt whatever of their equivalence in fauna. Both M. Cossmann and myself agree in regarding this horizon as probably equivalent with at least the lower part of the Aquitanian of France. Whether this be called Miocene or Oligocene is of little consequence, provided we understand clearly how these terms are defined. M. Cossmann considers that Megatylotus is characteristic of the Oligocene, and states that it is absent from the Tampa fauna, which therefore from his point of view cannot be Oligocene. Now the name Jfegatylotus is based on the Natica crassatina of Deshayes, which is an Eocene species in both Europe and America, but reaches up to the lower bed at Vicksburg, 1 Journ. de Conch., vol. Ixi, 1913, pp. 1-64. 2 Bull. U.S. Nat. Mus., No. 90, 1915. DR. DALL: OLIGOCENE OF TAMPA, ETC. 39 Mississippi, which is Lower Oligocene. The American form is hardly varietally distinct from the European and was named Ampullinopsis by Conrad twenty years before Fischer separatedit. The ‘ genus”’ is in my opinion but sectionally distinct from Ampullina, Bowdich (1822), of which there are in the Tampa fauna three species. No species of this group occur in either division of our American Miocene, which accords with M. Cossmann’s view as to the European - Miocene. M. Cossmann complains that the two species of Tampa Orthaulax figured are represented by imperfect specimens, but since no complete specimen has ever been known this could not well be helped. M. Cossmann states that I base my attribution of the Tampa horizon to the Oligoce"
