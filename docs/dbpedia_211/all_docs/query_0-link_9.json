        "text": "The molluscan species described by Linnaeus exceed 800 in number, most of them common and widespread; but changing species concepts necessitate a re-evalution of the status of many of them and this cannot be done satisfactorily without reference to the Linnaean shell collection. Since Linnaeus's death, however, that collection has been mishandled and adulterated to such an extent that its value to the systematist has been seriously diminished. It is more than a century since the collecton was studied in its entirety and the publication resulting from that study, Hanley's Ipsa Linnaei Conchylia (1855), is almost unobtainable and, in some respects, is unreliable. A re-appraisal of the Linnaean shells has been, therefore, long overdue. Part I of the present report outlines the history of the collection from its origins up to the twentieth century, reviews past work on it and describes its appearance. The significance of markings on shells and the metal receptacles in which they were placed originally is assessed; and the need for caution when designating types from the collection is emphasized. Part II is devoted to matter ancillary to that in Part I. Copies of the Systerna Naturae once owned by Linnaeus and his son are discussed and the importance of the annotations in them investigated. Some of the books utilized by Linnaeus and cited by him in the Systerna are listed and those in his own library which he annotated are mentioned. His association with Queen Louisa Ulrica and the descriptive account of her shells published in his Museum Ulricae are surveyed briefly. Finally, to help decide the provenance of some of his shells, an annotated list of persons who gave him shells or information on them is appended. The Appendix comprises a list of all the species absent from the collection which were described in the ‘Vermes Testacea’ portion of the Systema Naturae and the ‘Regni Animalis Appendix‘ of the Mantissa Plantarum.\n\nMarian Adachi Kohn (Deceased August 29 2014)\n\n·\n\nAlan C. Riggs\n\nKohn, A. J., and Riggs, A. C. 1975. Morphometry of the Conus Shell. Syst. Zool. 24:346–359.—A geometric model of the Conus shell has been developed in order to increase objectivity, quantification, and reproducibility in the use of attributes of gastropod shells as taxonomic characters. The model also permits determination of the position of Conus in the spectrum of geometrically possible gastropod shell forms. The parameters of the model comprise the smallest number of characters sufficient to describe the shell adequately. They include 1) shape of generating curve, 2) rate of whorl expansion, 3) rate of translation, 4) rate of spire translation, 5) relative whorl height, 6) convexity, 7) position of maximum diameter, and 8) relative diameter. Parameters 1–3 are adopted from Raup's generalized model of the coiled shell; 4–8 are necessitated by aspects of geometry specific to Conus. In addition, two sculptural parameters, number of tubercles and number of spiral striae on the last whorl, are utilized. Comparative analyses of the morphometric and sculptural parameters in five samples of shells belonging to three species indicate that nine of the ten are independent, i.e., not significantly correlated with others. Comparisons of samples from 3 geographically separated populations of C. miliaris from the southeastern Pacific indicate that specimens from Easter Island differ significantly from those from Mangareva and Tahiti with respect to seven of nine independent characters. Objective analysis of shell color by reflectance spectrophotometry also distinguishes Easter Island specimens of C. miliaris from those from more central Indo-West Pacific localities. Specimens from Tahiti assigned to C. coronatus and C. aristophanes on the basis of one sculptural character were distinguished by only two of the remaining eight independent characters. Conus occupies a region of the hyperspace of geometrically possible shell forms bounded by the following approximate values of major parameters: shape of generating curve, 5.5–19; rate of whorl expansion, 1–2; rate of translation, 2.5–8; distance between generating curve and axis of coiling, 0.\n\nView"
