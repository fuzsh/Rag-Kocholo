We have seen no authentic specimen of this form, but from the description and figures would be disposed to consider it a variety of D. aprinum with somewhat stronger interstitial striae than usual. D. JAVANUM Sowerby. PI. 4, fig. 49. Shell strongly arcuate, pale tawny or greenish, angulated by 8 ribs, the interstices wide and flat ; apical slit small.

Watson remarks that D. octogonum, which this very much re- sembles, has much stronger intercostal striae and the ribs are much more sharply prominent. It may be added that in octogonum the calibre increases more rapidly, and the shell is more curved. The aperture of D. javanum is as wide as long, and distinctly octagonal. The single specimen we have seen is nearly white. D. LETSON^: Sharp & Pilsbry, n. sp. PI. 1, fig. 13 ; pi. 5, figs. 66, 67, 68. Shell long and slender, the length about 12 times greatest diam- eter, solid, but rather thin, well and equally curved ; pale green, with numerous indistinctly defined darker zones. Sculpture, 17 longitudinal riblets at the apex, increasing to about 25 at aperture, rather unequal in size and strength, but not conspicuously so, the smaller ones being intercalated irregularly ; all the main riblets DENTALIUM. 5 rather wide and rounded, generally wider than the intervals; the concave side as a whole with stronger sculpture than the convex side ; growth striae faint. Aperture slightly compressed laterally, not oblique. Anal orifice shortly ovate, the narrower end toward the convex side ; no slit or notch. Length 75, length of aperture 6, breadth 5'5 mill. ; diam. of apex 2 mill. ; height of arch from chord 13 mill. Island of Bohol, Philippines. With the color and general shape of D. aprinum, this species pre- sents less prominent and many more longitudinal riblets, without trace of the definite arrangement seen in that species. It is not es- pecially related to aprinum except in being of a green color. The aperture is noticeably compressed from side to side. The figures on pi. 5 represent the sculpture at the apex and aperture, with an out- line of the latter. GROUP OF D. OCTANGULATUM. White shells with 6 to 13 strong ribs at the apex, continuing to the aperture or becoming obsolete, the intervals either smooth, with several striae, or a median riblet. Apex small ; anal orifice simple, without terminal \" pipe,\" slit, or notch (with very few exceptions where a short slit occurs). An Indo-Pacific, West American and West Indian group, with shells somewhat like the group of D. entails but not colored, and without the notch, sheath or other apical peculiarities frequently developed in that series. Some species possibly belonging to this group have been placed in the group of D. disparile, q. v. So many of the species are unfigured and insufficiently described that a satisfactory \" key \" to them cannot now be constructed. The Australian forms particularly are but little known. In the absence of something better, the following synopsis may be found of some use. Key to Species. I. Hexagonal or six ribbed at and near the apex. a.

D. LESSONI Deshayes. PI. 6, figs. 86, 90. Shell rather straight, cylindrical, whitish-gray, with 8 to 10 ribs, ribs obtuse, depressed, disappearing at the aperture. Allied to D. novemcostatum, but distinguished by form, curvature, and disposition of the ribs. It is narrower, longer, less curved, con- stantly of a yellowish-white uniform color, without transverse zones. The ribs, numbering 8, 9 or 10, are contiguous at their bases, mod- erately raised and rounded. They are more elevated toward the apex, diminishing gradually and disappearing toward the aperture. They are interrupted by some growth lines. The aperture is small relative to the length of the shell. Length 50, diam. 4 mill. (Desk.). New Guinea (Lesson). D. lessoni DESK., Mem. Soc. Hist. Nat.

Very distinct from D. lineolatum Cooke, which it nevertheless strongly resembles in its sculpture. This shell is more curved, the ribs are never less than eleven, and are comparatively obscure, while in lineolatum there are always nine, and they are very marked and prominent ( Cooke). MacAndrew perceived that \"Belcheri Sow.\" was wrong, and has corrected to \"Reevii Desh. MSS.\" I have no idea what this refers to, so will describe the species, which is a good one (Cooke). D. LAQUEATUM Verrill. PL 7, figs. 1, 2 (immature) ; pi. 5, fig. 73. Shell rather large, thick and strong, moderately stout, gradually tapered, gently curved, chiefly behind the middle. The sculpture consists of about eleven [9 to 11] strong, prominent, broad, obtuse* longitudinal ribs, separated by deep, concave interspaces, which are wider than the ribs in the middle of the shell and of about the same breadth posteriorly ; at about the anterior third the ribs decrease in prominence, fading out, or becoming flattened into mere obtuse angles at the anterior end ; along the middle of the shell a smaller rib [or two] intervenes between part of the larger ones; four of the ribs on the convex side are closer together and narrower than the rest, while those on the concave side are widest apart. Between the ribs the whole surface is covered with regular, fine and close, microscopic longitudinal lines, which also cover the ribs where they are not worn. Distinct and rather close lines of growth cover the 1>ENTALIUM. 11 surface, and, in some places, make with the longitudinal striae a fine reticulated structure. Anterior aperture nearly round, but slightly angulated in line with the principal ribs ; edges thin, but the shell is thickened and the interior is circular farther back. The posterior end is rather small, with a very small aperture, the shell being thickened, but the tip is so eroded as to render uncertain the exist- ence of a slight notch. Color dull grayish-white. Length 45, di- ameter of large end 6, of small end 3 mill. ( Verrill). D. laqueatum VERRILL, Trans. Conn. Acad., vi, p. 431, pi. 44, f, 18 (1885).— DALL, Blake Kep., Bull. M. C. Z., xviii, p. 426, pi. 27, f. 1 ; Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., No. 37, p. 76, pi. 27, f. 1 (1889). Of Martha's Vineyard and Chesapeake Bay in 68 fms. (U. S. Fish Commission) ; from near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, to the vi- cinity of Cape Florida, abundant (Blake Expedition) ; at Station 9, Gulf of Mexico, in 127 fms.; off Sombrero, living, in 54 fms.; off Havana, in 127 to 177 fms. (Sigsbee) ; off Santa Cruz, in 115 fms. ; off Dominica, in 118 fms., sand; near the Grenadines, in 164 fms., coral ; off Grenada, in 154 fms., ooze ; near Barbados, in 73-84 fms. (Blake Exped.). This species is easily distinguished from all others of our coast by the very large and strong longitudinal ribs, and the fine longitudi- nal striae between them ( Verrilf). This very fine species reaches the length of 55 mill. The very young have generally a very slight wave on the convex side of the anal aperture ; in the adults this aperture is somewhat circular and unslit; sometimes there is a narrow slit 5 mill. long. The very young have the transverse sculpture most prominent (aside from the strong ribs which range from 9 to 11), the adolescent part the longitudinal striae ; while near the lip of the adult both are obsolete. I am disposed to think the species does not reach more than 200 fms. (Dall.~). It recalls D. octangulatum Don. somewhat, but the secondary striae in that species, when present, are generally more numerous, the primary ribs fewer, and the taper at the posterior end much more abrupt.

Shell solid, pale amber colored, acuminate, curved toward the apex, fluted with 9 angulated, very high, equidistant ribs; inter- stices and some of the ribs themselves longitudinally lineated, and 12 DENTALIUM. decussated by very minute transverse striae. Apex entire. Length 1-75, breadth at base 0'25 inch (Cooke). Gulf of Suez (Mac Andrew). D. lineolatum COOKE, Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. (5) xvi, p. 274 (Oct., 1885). In fresh specimens the interstitial lines are very marked ; they are parallel to the ribs, which are themselves generally bisected by a similar line (Cooke). D. laugieri Jouss. and D.reevei Desh. seem to be identical with, or at least very nearly allied to, this species. Although reevei has pri- ority, the absence of a sufficient description would lead us to adopt Cooke's name should the specific identity of these forms be confirmed. The descriptions here follow : D. laugieri Jousseaume. Shell white, solid, cylindrical, slightly arcuate, longitudinally costate ; ribs 9, equal, strong, rounded, smooth ; the intervals flat, wider, with 3 to 5 delicate stride. Length 40-48, diam. 7 mill. (Jotiss. in Bull. Soc. Philomath, de Paris, (8), vi, p. 103, 1894). Aden ; Suez. This form seems to present no tangible differences from D. lineo- latum Cooke, and from comparison of the diagnoses we believe it a synonym. D. reevei \"Deshayes\" Fischer. This species, which will shortly be described by M. Deshayes, is white, arcuate, having 9 longitudi- nal ribs. The interstices are very finely striated transversely, and some longitudinal narrow ribs run along them. (D. reevei De- shayes, mss., Fiseher, Journ. de Conchy 1., xix [(3), xi], p. 212, .1871). Suez. The above insufficient descriptive note is all that has been pub- lished on this species. Compare D. laugieri Jouss. and lineolatum Cooke, with which reevei is probably identical. D. ROBUSTUM Brazier. Shell nearly straight, thick, dull white, longitudinally 9-ribbed, ribs rounded, wide apart, narrow toward the apex, interstices flat- tened, smooth ; apex with small perforation, entire ; aperture thick- ened, regular.

D.filosum B. & S., Zoological Journal, v, p. 48 (1830-1832). Distinguished from D. octogonum by its much more slender shape and its thinner shell. Instead of the eight angles of that species it has eight distinct, raised, longitudinal threads. Three specimens of this fine species were lately brought to England by Mr. Hay, who himself picked them up on the coast of Tennasserim (B. & S.). It is somewhat peculiar that this apparently distinct and large species has not been noticed by any author since its original descrip- tion. Compare D. javanum. D. STRIGATUM Gould.

So far as our material goes, there are oftener 11 than 12 ribs ; and the development of an intermediate thread in each space over the greater part of the shell is occasional though probably exceptional. The specimen from Yokohama which I refer to this species came ^with a series of D. oetangulatum. It is 11-ribbed, and measures, length 16 DENTALIUM. 47, length of aperture 5, breadth 4'7 mill. ; height of arch from chord 9 mill. The apical third is much more curved than in the typical form, but this, like the greater ratio of diameter to length, is a character of immaturity. D. YOKOHAMENSE Watsoo. PI. 2, figs. 29, 30, 31. Shell much curved when young becoming nearly straight with later growth, little conical, rather strong, opaque, yellowish-white, quite dull, but not chalky. Sculpture : Irregular, slightly elliptical, lines of growth, a little puckered, generally slight, but sometimes sharp and even ; towards the mouth faintly imbricated ; occasion- ally marked by a deep furrow-like construction of the shell. The longitudinal ribs are eight to nine in number, equal, rounded, rather strong, but not very prominent. These are parted by furrows, round and open, very shallow, and of very unequal breadth. In these furrows, one, two, or even three thread-like riblets appear, and in the whole texture the lens shows a tendency to a longitudinal or rod like structure. At the apex the shell is squarely truncate, and in the young shell there is, on the convex slope, a slight ragged fis- sure. Length 1*2, breadth at month. 0*15; at apex 0*003 inch.

The ribs here are much less sharp than they are in Dentalium dentalis Linn., and there is no trace of the exquisite longitudinal fretted stria? which cover the furrows in that species. The sharp intercostal striae of Dentalium oetogonum are quite absent here ; and in that species, which is much more bent, the ribs are much wider apart and more equally parted. ( Wats.'). D.

Out of 32 specimens before us from Japan, 2 have nine equal and equidistant ribs, and in another one rib is replaced by two contiguous smaller ones. The young are much more curved than adults ; and in the latter the larger half of the length is scarcely arcuate. The number of ribs is practically the chief character separating this from D. sexcostatum. In some specimens the primary ribs become much lower toward the aperture, which, while still octagonal, has the angles rounded off, not projecting as in the typical form. Donovan supposed the species to be British ; but there can be no doubt whatever of the identity of his types with the Lamarckian D. octogonum. After arriving at this conclusion we found that Des- hayes, in his MS. card catalogue, had adopted the same view. D. JAPONICUM Dunker. PI. 2, fig. 19.

Several specimens of the original lot are before us, with others collected by Archer at Singapore. These have sharply cut, high and rather narrow ribs, separated by flat or concave intervals showing lines of growth only, although in the largest there are faint traces of interstitial striae. One out of 5 from China is 7-ribbed (see be- low). There is no apical slit. The shell is somewhat more slender than D. octangulatum, the diam. of aperture being contained 12 to 14 times in the length of shell. Lischke writes as follows : Gould's diagnosis agrees excellently with the 16 examples before me, except that the intervals are plain only in the smaller part of the shell to about 20-25 mill, from the .apex, beyond there having very fine interstitial riblets. These riblets become more numerous toward the aperture, but they vary in num- ber, not only in different specimens but in the different intervals on DENTALIUM. 19 the same shell ; usually being 1-3, exceptionally 4, or even 6. My largest example has a length of 50, breadth 4 mill. With the 16 six-ribbed specimens, there are 4 with seven primary ribs, the largest one 41 mill. long. These were received with the others, and are exactly like them except in the number of ribs (pi. 2, figs. 23, 24). All the seven ribs run from apex to aperture, and the latter is as pronounced a heptagon as that of the typical form is a hexagon. Var. SEXCOSTATUM Sowerby. PL 2, figs. 27, 28.

This species has hitherto been confused with the Japanese Z>. hexagonum Old., a mistake apparently originating with Dr. Car- penter. It never grows as large as that form, the six primary ribs lose conspicuously in prominence on the larger part of the shell, and fewer interstitial riblets develop. The two species are very readily separated at all stages of growth, and have only been united because no comparison of Oriental and Californian specimens seems hitherto to have been made. The young shells, as usual, are much more curved and taper more rapidly than adults. Specimens from the Pliocene at San Diego are larger than any recent shells we have seen. There is a form of this species having 7 or even 8 ribs, (pi. 11, figs. 81, 82, 83, 86) and another with a short apical slit on both con- vex and concave sides of the tube (pi. 11, fig. 84). We have not seen specimens enough to be satisfied that these are more than variations of D. neo hexagonum. D. GOULDII Dall. PI. 7, fig. 14 (var. obscurum'). Shell elongated, slender, slightly arched, vitreous, anteriorly whit- ish, behind with a yellowish or pale greenish tinge , surface polished, with fine microscopic longitudinal strise over a large part of the surface; in well developed specimens the shell is hexagonal and six-sided, with the sides impressed so that the ribs stand out like marginating rods ; as the shell grows older, the angles become less marked, although generally quite perceptible at the aperture ; the lines of growth are visible as extremely fine engraved striae ; in an- other mutation of the species (which served the draughtsman for fig. 14), there are longitudinal threads between those forming the DENTALIUM. 21 angles, and which obscure the angularity especially in front until the shell is examined from behind \"end on \" when it will be per- ceptible ; this form is straighter than the type. The aperture is not at all oblique. There is a wide rather short notch, perhaps due to erosion, at the convex side of the anal orifice in the shell figured. Typical form shows no notch when perfect, and measures 30*0 mill, long, height of the arch 3'5 mill., aperture 3*0 and anal end 0'6 mill, in diameter.

The shell was confounded with D. hexagonum Gould, a large Chinese species of similar form, by Sowerby and Reeve. The typical form of D. gouldii is longer, more slender, and less curved than the figures of Reeve and Sowerby, which represent a young D. hexago- num. It is just possible that the supposed variety may prove dis- tinct, in which case it may be called D. obscurum; but I inclined at present to believe it to be nothing more than a variety. The ordinary form is what has been called hexagonum by West Indian collectors for many years, but the rounding off of the angles as the shell becomes adult is not paralleled in the Chinese species, which is much larger, and has a reddish dull surface, like pale terra-cotta. (Dall). It is probable that this species was described three times before the publication of Dall's description, but some doubt attaches to the identity in each case. We therefore retain the name gouldii. The following is probably a young specimen of D. gouldii Dall, which is known to occur at Galvestou. 22 DENTALIUM. D. texasianum Phil.

Shell cylindrical, subulate, somewhat curved, grayish-white, some- what transparent. At the apex there are 6 strongly projecting equidistant angles ; between each of these ribs a great many striae arise, covering the shell, and the primary ribs rapidly decrease and disappear at the first fourth or third of the shell's length. Growth striae quite fine and often regular. Length 45-50, greatest diame- ter 4 mill, (from Desh.). Masbate, Philippines; W. Colombia (Sowb.); Cape York, near Albany L, N.

Brazier writes : This species is six-ribbed near the apex, finely striated below, as Mr. Sowerby expresses it. The specimens before me have very fine, thread-like ribs ; the number of ribs in all are from 24 to 25, and at or near the apex 6. Shell thin, white, slightly arched. There can be no reasonable doubt that \" W. Columbia \" cited by Sowerby as a locality for this species, refers to specimens of D. oer- stedii Morch. We have unfortunately no Oriental examples for comparison with the West American species, and published descrip- tions are insufficient ; but while the forms from opposite sides of the Pacific may be identical, it is at least unlikely that they are. Des- hayes was ignorant of the locality of his species, but he was well supplied with East Indian material and had very little from the Panamic Province, so it is somewhat likely that his types were from the former region. Fig. 47 is a copy of Deshayes original fig- ure. D. OERSTEDII Morch. PI. 10, figs. 60, 61, 62, 63, 64. Shell not much curved, decidedly tapering, rather solid, white. Sculpture : hexagonal at and near the apex, with a narrow, raised riblet at each angle, the intervals flat ; a short distance from apex each face is divided by a riblet which soon attains the size of the six primary ribs, and the tube becomes circular in section. Some- what further on, each interval on the convex and lateral faces of the shell bears a (tertiary) riblet, and still later these appear in the in- tervals on the concave side, so that the number of riblets at the middle of the shell is 12 (usually with some small threads also), and at the aperture it varies from 21 (or sometimes as few as 17) to 24, according to the age, and individual variation in development of tertiary riblets on the concave face. Near the aperture the riblets become rather low and wide, and are somewhat unequal. Growth stria3 fine and inconspicuous, but occasionally there are low, varici- form rings on most specimens. Aperture slightly oblique, circular ; apex small, with circular ori- fice without slit or notch of any kind. Length 39'5, diam. of aperture 3*5, of apex 1 mill.

The hexagonal six-ribbed apex, with interstitial secondary and tertiary riblets successively appearing in the intervals, are the more obvious features of this form. The specimens from Panama Bay and Galapagos Islands are lusterless and somewhat chalky. This southern race is evidently the typical D. oerstedi which was de- scribed from a rather short specimen. A translation of Morch's diagnosis is as follows : D. oerstedii Morch. Shell arcuate, rather solid, somewhat shin- ing, white or yellowish, hexagonal at apex. Aperture circular, having 12 lirse, the interstices smooth posteriorly, but toward the middle divided by a riblet, whence to the aperture there are 24 lirse. Growth lines here and there more raised, nearly variciform. Length 27, diam. 3 mill. Gulf of Nicoya, west coast of Costa Rica (Dr. A. S. Oersted). A specimen in the U. S.

This name, which Dall used to cover the entire species, as found from Lower California to the Galapagos, may be utilized in a re- stricted sense for the northern form. The general proportions and curvature are as in typical D. oer- stedi, but the sculpture is less coarse ; tertiary riblets soon appear on the concave as well as the other sides of tube, and toward the middle a varying number of threads of a fourth order are inter- posed ; toward the aperture all sculpture becomes flattened, and the total number of riblets and threads is decidedly greater than in typical oerstedi. The primitive 6 riblets retain their predominance longer than in the type. The specimens are glossy. Length 41*5, diam. of aperture 3'5, of apex 0'6 mill. Types of var. numerosum are no. 87,559, U.

D. AGASSIZI Pilsbry & Sharp, n. sp. PI. 12, figs. 90, 91, 92, 93, 94. Shell gently curved posteriorly, the later half nearly straight,, tapering, solid, white and lusterless (often with a black encrustation toward the apex, and reddish-brown on the larger end). Sculpture: at the apex there are 12-20 rather sharp and well raised riblets- separated by wider, concave intervals ; at a varying distance from the apex an interstitial thread appears in these intervals, so that near the middle of the shell's length there are double that number of riblets and threads, alternately larger and smaller, and at the aperture there are 25-48 unequal riblets and threads, lower and blunter in large examples. Aperture somewhat oblique, subcircu- lar, but the arc along the concave side is sometimes less curved than the remainder of the peristome, and the edge is irregular from breakage. Anal orifice small, circular, no slit or notch, but often the inner layer projects tube-like from erosion of the softer, more chalky outer layer. a.

D. occi- dentale is very similar, but the sculpture developed between the primary ribs is unlike this Pacific form. D. majorinum and it& variety magellanicum are also much like agassizi, but the latter has finer sculpture. The inner layer of shell substance is very dense and bluish-white, the outer layer being softer and more chalky, fre- quently eroded, often exposing the inside stratum which resists the solvent power, at the apex and elsewhere. The number of riblets is quite variable ; thus the four specimens measured above have : (a) At apex 20, at aperture 48 riblets. (6) At apex 17, at aperture 40 riblets. (c) At apex 14, at aperture 29 riblets. (d) At apex 12, at aperture 25 riblets. (Off San Diego). The number of interposed riblets varies somewhat, but the num- ber of apparently primary ribs at the apex is also subject to a wider range of variation than usual. D. MAJORINUM Mabille & Rochebrune. PI. 12, figs. 98, 99. Shell moderately curved posteriorly, the later two-thirds nearly straight, slender, attenuated toward the apex ; white, the young and newer growth of adults somewhat translucent; slightly shining. Sculpture of about 11 narrow, rather acute ribs near the apex, separ- ated by concave intervals ; the number increasing by intercalation to about 29 at the aperture, where they are approximately equal, with concave, transversely finely striate interstices, in some of which a median riblet occurs. Aperture circular, not oblique. Anal orifice minute and circular, without slit or notch. Length 38-5, diam. of aperture 3'5, of apex 0'7 mill. West coast of Patagonia, 122 fms. (U. S. F.

Something is wrong with Mabille and Rochebrune's measurements (their figure measuring, length 50, diam. at aperture 4'3 mill.), and their description is not very good. It is here translated. Shell long-conic, rather slowly increasing, much attenuated to- ward the apex, hardly shining, subpellucid, a little fragile, orna- mented with numerous, nearly equidistant, somewhat roughened 28 DENTALIUM.

Another form of this species was collected by the U. S. Fish Com- mission at Sta. 2777 and 2780 in 77^-369 fms., bottom temp. 36°-46° Straits of Magellan. It has the riblets on the median portion of the shell unequal, alternating, becoming subequal toward the aperture where they are rounded and parted by narrow grooves, instead of acute, with wider concave intervals as in the type. Length 57, diam. 4*5 mill. This form may be called var. MAGELLANICUM (pi. 12, figs. 95, 96, 97). In the specimen figured there are 12 or 13 riblets at apex, 24 at aperture. Type no. 87561 U. S. Nat.

Sculpture : near the apex 17 subequal but unequally spaced, narrow, sharply defined riblets very much narrower than the interspaces ; these continue to the aperture, increasing in size ; their number is early increased by the intercalation of some interstitial threads, mainly on the concave side, so that at the aperture there are 25 unequal, unevenly spaced ribs and threads ; the whole surface densely and conspicuously striated transversely, the striae unequal, like cords scattered among threads, crenulating the riblets. Aperture oblique, subcircular, a trifle wider than long, the peristome jagged from fracture. Apex large, the orifice simply circular, without notch or slit.

A large species, apparently without near allies. It is remarkable for the prominence of the growth-strise, and the clearly carved ribs of the surface. Figure and description are from a specimen in coll. U. S. National Museum. Jousseaume's original diagnosis is as follows : Shell large, gray-white, cylindrical, slightly arcuate, longitudi- nally costate, transversely densely lamellose-striate ; ribs 21, sub- equal, separated by flat grooves.

Shell longitudinally ribbed, latticed by circular riblets or fine raised lamellae, often rising into minute knots or spines at the inter- sections. The species following would apparently fall into Sacco's subgenus Coccodentalium (Boll. Mus. Zool. ed Anat. Comp. R. Univ. di Tor- ino, xi, 1896, p. 98). We have not seen D. radula Schroter, Gmel., the type of that group, and Sacco gives no diagnosis, but the descrip- tion of that Pliocene species indicates sculpture like carduus. Other members of the same section are D. tryoni Pils. & Sharp of the Miocene of San Domingo, and possibly the recent D. cancellatum Sowb. 30 DENTALIUM. The group Coccodentalium is hardly equivalent in value to the subgenera we have recognized, being merely a modification of the D. agassizi type. D. CARDUUS Ball. PI. 7, fig. 6. Shell pure white, sometimes attaining an ashy or rusty tinge from extraneous matter, elongated, slightly curved, and with a rasp-like surface for about half its adult length ; longitudinal sculpture of very numerous fine sharp raised threads with somewhat wider inter- spaces, in which intercalary threads from time to time arise ; trans- verse sculpture of fine sharp elevated lamellae which cross the threads and become almost spinulose on the intersections ; these can be felt, but are almost too fine to be clearly seen with the naked eye ; in the perfectly adult shell, this sculpture becomes, through senility or wear, less sharp on the last half of the shell ; though both sorts of ridges persist, they are thicker and more rounded ; shell not very thick ; aperture circular, very little oblique ; anal orifice small, with a short wide slit on the convex side, and no notch or wave on the other. Length of completely adult shell, 87*0 ; height of arch from chord, 7'0; diameter of aperture, 7'0; of anal orifice 0*7 mill. (Dolt).

The specimen figured is only 16 mill, long, but shows sufficiently the characters of the form and sculpture. Better specimens were afterwards found in some of the Fish Commission dredgmgs, from which the above description is drawn. The peculiar sharpness felt by drawing the shell gently between the finger and thumb is very recognizable and under the glass the sculpture is very beautiful. (Dall). A closely allied species attains a very large size in the Oligocene of San Domingo. D. CANCELLATUM Sowerby. PI. 10, fig. 67. Shell thin, white, acuminate, strongly curved towards the apex, where it is cancellated by about 8 longitudinal ribs and elevated con- centric strict, then the shell becoming straighter and the ribs more numerous (Sowb.).

Cancellated near the apical end by distinctly raised striae crossing the longitudinal ribs (Sowb.). GROUP OF D. QUADRAPICALE. Small or moderate sized shells with the tube square at and near the apex, having angles on the convex, concave and two lateral sides, becoming subcircular at the aperture. Generally costulate be- tween the angles, sometimes smooth ; the apical orifice occupying a short pipe, or without this and square or round. Distribution, Pacific shores of tropical and subtropical America, and of the East Indies south to Torres Strait. No species of this very distinct group appear in the \"Albatross \" •dredgings off west America, so it is likely that the species are shal- low water forms, not descending to archibenthal or benthal depths. No recent species is yet known with certainty from the Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico ; but in the Miocene of Jamaica and San Do- mingo D. dissimile Guppy and its probable synonym, D. pondero- sum Gabb, species allied to D. dipsyche, but much larger and more solid, occur. Dall has described from the Caloosahatchie Pliocene a D. caloosaense, also similar in general characters, and doubtless the direct descendant of the Miocene species. Another similar form has been reported by Harris from the \" Galveston deep well \" as D. quadrangulare f Sby., from strata of upper Miocene age. The fragments seen by us are not large enough to be characteristic, but it is probably not the recent species. In the same deposit occurs a form not separable so far as material we have seen shows, from the recent D. tesseragonum (D. tetragonum Sby., Harris, Bull. Amer. Paleont, no. 3, p. 13). Nothing we have seen from the Eocene belongs to this immediate group. Key to Species. I. The four primary ribs bifid or trifid ; shell attenuated and stri- ated toward apex, smooth toward aperture.

D. quadricostatum Braz., perhaps belonging to this group, is not clearly enough described to admit of its inclusion in the above analysis without doubt. Whether the keels are serrate (as in the fossil D. radula), or divided as in D. dispar, we do not know. D. DISPAR Sowerby. PL 4, figs. 52, 53, 54, 55, 56. Shell rather slender, the length about 9 times the greatest diam- eter in adults ; earlier third well curved, the rest of the length but slightly arcuate ; much attenuated toward the fine apex ; rather thin, white or bluish-white, glossy and brilliant. Sculpture : four- angled at apex (square in section), the angles dorsal, ventral and lateral, continuing as keels which rapidly become obsolete (extend- ing two-thirds the length of shell in a specimen 15 mill, long, but only about one-third the length in one 30 mill, in length) ; each of the four primary ribs bifid or trifid at summit. Between these angles, throughout their extent, the surface has very fine longitudi- nal riblets ; and not far from the apex a secondary rib arises in each of the four faces, and continues as far as the primary ribs. The larger moiety of the shell is polished, cylindrical, wholly free from longitudinal sculpture. Growth strise fine and inconspicuous. Aperture slightly oblique, sub-circular, the peristome thin ; anal orifice square with thin walls, and without slit or notch. Length. 30, antero-posterior diam. of aperture 3 mill., lateral 3*2 mill.

Shell slender, the length about 11 times the diam., well curved, attenuated toward the apex ; white, nearly lusterless. Sculpture : at and near the apex square in section, with four acute, narrow, pro- jecting, longitudinal, pinched-up ribs, the spaces between flat ; not far from the apex in each face a median thread arises, and soon equals the primary four in size ; each interval then bears a tertiary thread, and here the section of the tube has become circular. At about the middle of the length another set of interstitial threads ap- pear ; so thatch the aperture there are 32 flat, equal, low, but abruptly defined riblets separated by flat interstices of about the same or slightly greater width. Interstices everywhere plain except for cir- cular growth-lines, which are moderately obvious throughout. 3 34 DENTALIUM.

Length 45, antero-posterior diam. of aperture 3'8, lateral diam. 4'1 mill. Habitat unknown. This species differs from D. dispar in the simple primary ribs, lack of fine, even longitudinal striation, and persistance of the sculpture to the aperture. D. quadrapicale is allied, but has a much more oblique aperture, more rapidly tapering tube, and though far smaller, a greater number of much finer longitudinal riblets. D. QUADRAPICALE ' Hanley ' Sowerby. PL 4, fig. 50. Shell rather stout, apical third strongly curved, the remainder but slightly arcuate ; white, shining. Sculpture, four angles at the apex (giving that part an almost square section, the two outer sides of the square slightly longer), situated at the outer, inner and lateral sur- faces, the faces between them straight and flat ; these angles rapidly lose in prominence, and the intervals become convex ; very near the apex each interval becomes parted by a secondary riblet ; and the interstices between these are again divided by tertiary threads at about the end of the first third of the shells length ; and subdivision proceeds until at the aperture there are about 36 low, subequal rib- lets, with narrow, shallow intervals, and the tube is sabcircular, a little flattened antero-posteriorly, in section.

Mr. Sowerby changed the name of his fathers species in 1860 without assigning any cause, or even mentioning that a change had been made. The etymology of the original name is obvious, and we do not see that such radical emendation is called for, the more be- cause the specific name tetragonum had already been used by Broc- chi. Carpenter reports tetragonum Sby. from Margarita Bay, Pacific coast of Lower California in about N. lat. 24°, specimens collected by one of Harper Pease's collectors. They may possibly be refer- able to D.fisheriy q. v. There are some specimens in the collection of the Academy said to be from Rio Janeiro, collected by the U. S. Exploring Expedition. We do not know whether the locality is authentic or not, but it seems doubtful. There were, however, several species of this type in the Antillean Miocene fauna. D. QUADRANGULARE Sowerby.

FISHERI Stearns, n. sp. PI. 5, figs. 61, 62, 63, 64, 65. Shell cylindrical becoming square toward the apex, not much taper- ing, and nearly as wide at apex as at aperture ; moderately arcuate ; comparatively solid and strong. White with the riblets gray ; luster- less. Sculpture of four strong angles at and near the apex, where it is square ; these angles rapidly decreasing in prominence until at the first third of the shell's length the section is almost round. Very near the apex each of the four faces is parted by a median riblet ; and a little further on a tertiary series of riblets, one in each of the intervals except the two bounding the keel of the convex side, in which intervals small riblets develop later. At the middle of the shell's length the section is circular and the 28 to 30 riblets nearly equal in size ; a few threads are intercalated toward the aperture, where the riblets are slightly unequal, low, narrow and close. Aper- ture circular, slightly oblique. Anal orifice circular, with a slightly raised rim ; placed in the middle of the square apex. Length 14*1, diam. at aperture 1'8, at apex 1/2 mill.

This species is evidently near to D. quadrangulare Sowb. of Col- ombia, but it is narrower in proportion to its breadth. We have not, however, been able to compare specimens of Sowerby's species. The general system of sculpture is the same as in several allied species ; DENTALIUM-ANTALIS. 37 and it must be remembered in dealing with these that an older shell, or a younger one, would show corresponding differences in the sculpture at and near the apex, owing to the truncation of this part with advancing age. This species is probably what Carpenter reports as D. tetragonum Sby. from Margarita Bay. Another specimen (no. 46207, U. S. Nat. Mus.) before us, from the Gulf of California (pi. 5, fig. 63, apex enlarged), is probably an older stage of this species, in which the apex has been more trun- cated, the riblets extending to the extreme end. There is a short 41 pipe \" for the anal orifice. Length 14'7, diam. at aperture 1'8, at apex 1*3 mill. Subgenus ANTALIS H. & A. Adams, 1854. Entails GRAY, P. Z. S., 1847, p. 158, type D. entails.

Shell circular or polygonal in section, sculptured with longitudi- nal ribs or strise at least in the young, often without longitudinal sculpture in adults, or only so sculptured near the apex; apex gen- erally with a v-shaped notch at or near the convex side, or with a solid plug and central short tube or orifice. Type D. entalis Linn. Distribution, -Mediterranean, North Atlantic, Arctic and North Pacific. Mainly a group of moderate depths. These forms differ from the foregoing ribbed species in the pecu- liarities of the apex mentioned above, which are probably developed in some specimens of all the species, though examples not showing them are also abundant in all. The group as here constituted may seem heterogeneous, including as it does species with or without a v-shaped apical notch, with or without a short pipe or tube inserted in an apical plug, and either heavily ribbed or smooth ; but apical characters vary within each species in limits so wide that they are among the secondary specific characters, and they are not correlated with sculptural characters. 38 DENTALIUM-ANTALIS. Thus, were we to divide into (1) species with a tubular apical fora- men and (2) those with a v-like notch, such closely allied forms as D. vulgare and D. weinkauffii would he separated, and a good many specimens of other species would fail to show the differential feat- ures ; if we divide by a criterion of sculpture, each section would contain forms with various apical characters, and a number of spe- cies intermediate in sculpture. If the characters of the apex be held of subgeneric importance, then the group with an apical tube, such as vulgare, novemcostatum, etc., will require a new subgeneric name. The names for this division of Dentalium are involved in obscur- ity. Aldrovaudus, writing in 1642, proposed to call the smooth Italian species (probably D. vulgare) Antale ; but as his nomencla- ture was not binomial, the name has of course only a historic in- terest in the light of subsequent events. Defrance and other early French writers enter \" Antale\" as a synonym of Dentalium, or another name for D. entails (see Nouv. Diet. d'Hist. Nat. ii, p. 136, 1816 ; Encycl. Meth., i, p. 75, 1892, etc.). Schroter, between 1774 and 1784, is said to mention Antale, but his two works on geology, \" Lithologisches Keal- und Verballexicon,\" and \" Vollstandige Ein- leitung in die Kenntniss und Geschichte der Steine und Verstein- erungen,\" are not accessible to us, and it does not appear that he adopts Antale as a genus. In 1846, Herrmannsen mentions Antalis Aldrov. as a name for smooth Dentalia, no type species being given. In 1854 H. & A. Adams recognized Antalis Aldrov. as a second genus of Dentaliidce, with the following diagnosis : \" Shell symme- trical, tubular, subcylindrical, recurved ; apex perforated, perfora- tion with a notch-like fissure on the dorsal or posterior margin ; aperture circular, entire. Of the two examples cited, A. semistrio- lata Guild, is evidently introduced merely as an illustration of the soft anatomy, but as the shell has no \" notch-like fissure,\" it is ap- parent that the second example, A. entalis L., of which the shell is figured, must be the type. It agrees with the generic definition, and with the express statement in regard to the fissure following it. So far as we can learn, this was the first formal introduction of the term Antalis into post-Linn»3an nomenclature, and although the name is attributed by Adams brothers to Aldrovandus, it is essen- tially a new group, the original \"Antale\" Aldrov. (D. vulgare= tarentinum) being omitted from the list given under Antalis Adams, and placed in Dentalium. DENTALIUM-ANTALIS. 39 Stoliczka in 1868 restricts Antalis to the species of the type of D. vulgare, in which there is a supplemental tube at the apex, sep- arating it generically from Entails Gray. Tryon and Fischer fol- low Stoliczka's definition of Antalis or Antale and Entails. Finally, Newton and Harris in 1894 finding Entails Gray pre- occupied by Sowerby (but not by Defrance, as they allege) substi- tute Entallopsls for the group. It appears, therefore, that Entails Gray, Entallopsls Newton & Harris and Antalis Ads. are absolutely equivalent, being based upon the same species as type. There is another chapter of this history, in which the genesis of \"Entale\" (Defrance's Gallic vernacular for Entallum) is dealt with, the vicissitudes of its career related, with at last its final trans- formation into \" Entails.\" The details of this melancholy tale may be found by the curious in the section of this volume treating of Pyrgopolon. GROUP OF D. ENTALIS. Shell moderately or very solid, circular in section ; white or red- dish toward the apex ; near the apex always sculptured with longi- tudinal riblets or strise, at least in the young, but frequently the greater part in adults is smooth, with growth-lines only. Apex typically with a slightly projecting \" sheath \" interrupted by a small v-shaped notch on or near the convex side. North Atlantic, Mediterranean and North Pacific in distribution, from shallow water to the greatest depths reached. In many species of this group the inner layer of the shell is of more porcellanous, firmer texture than the outer, and by the pro- gressive erosion of the smaller end with growth this layer projects slightly as a sort of narrow, elevated rim around the apical orifice, interrupted on one side by the notch, as shown in fig. 25 of plate 8. This condition, while usual in some species and likely to occur in all of the group, is by no means invariable in any of them. In some forms the inner layer thus exposed by erosion, may form a longer tube, as in the young specimen of D. agile which Jeffreys called D. vagina. The same structure occurs in D. agassizi and many other forms. This tube is not homologous with the apical tube of D. vulgare (which is probably more allied to the novemcostatum group), or of D. filum, etc. 40 DENTALIUM-ANTALIS. Key to species. I.

Allied to D. entalis L., but when unworn it is lusterless, finely striated throughout, not slit or notched posteriorly, and it is more robust.

D. weinkauffi Dkr., of Japan, is a near relative of this species, but that has the apical notch of typical Antalis, while vulgare is like novemcostatum in apical features. According to Jeffreys, \" The stomach of this Dentalium is a reper- tory of littoral Foraminifera. It is not, like Spatangus or Synapta, an indiscriminate swallower of sand, but a fastidious Pig from the herd of Epicurus, luxuriously picking out the choicest morsels with its extensile and delicate captacula. Adriatic specimens of the shell collected by Professor Stossich are 2i inches in length and very fine.\" Besides the literature cited above, there are very many references in local and faunal works, and a number doubtfully applying to this species or confusing it with D. entalis. Martini, Bonanni, d'Ar- gentville and other early writers have also noticed and figured it. D. ENTALIS Linne. PI. 8, figs. 25. Shell tapering, not much curved, often irregularly divided into segments by the successive accretions of growth ; it is solid, opaque, and glossy ; sculpture, slight concentric lines of growth, and occa- sionally a few indistinct and extremely fine longitudinal stria? to- wards the narrower end, these strise, when they occur, are not very numerous, and are only visible with the aid of a magnifier ; color ivory-white, with sometimes an ochreous stain on the narrower part, caused by an admixture of mud with the sand in which this species burrows : margin at the anterior or broader end more or less DENTALIUM-ANTALIS. 43 jagged, owing to that part of the shell being nearly formed and con- sequently much thinner than other parts; at the posterior or nar- rower end it is usually truncated in adult specimens, and furnished with a very short sloping and oblique pipe or tubular appendage having a pear-shaped orifice ; there is also occasionally at the point on the convex side a notch or groove, in a line with the front or smaller part of the tubular appendage, and this notch is rarely ex- tended into a short and narrow slit or channel.

More glossy and ivory-like than D. vulgare, usually more dis- tinctly annulated, and with the longitudinal striae completely want- ing except at the smaller end, where their presence is variable. The posterior termination has either a labial projection which is rather broadly fissured dorsally (i. e. upon the arched side of the tube) or if it have not experienced that reparative process is then very taper- ing, and has a short shelving notch-like dorsal fissure; it is always entire upon the ventral or incurved side of the shell. In certain specimens the close approximation of the concentric lines of growth produces a somewhat annulated appearance. (F. & jET.). D. entails is an abundant species on the coast of Maine; and William Stimpson, comparing with the European D. vulgare and finding differences, distinguished the American shells as D. striolatum, 44 DENTALIUM-ANTALIS. under which name the species is generally known in American col- lections. Had he compared with D. entalis, the identity of the two would no doubt have been recognized. There is no difference, not even varietal, between English and Maine specimens. D. striolatum or Entalis striolata of Jeffreys, Sars and Watson is D. occidental Stimp. D. striolatum of Risso is D. vulgare. There is great latitude of opinion regarding the limits of the species entalis; some conchologists holding occidental, agile and pretiosum as merely varieties of the Linnsean species. The following variations have been named : Var. infundibulum Jeffr. Shorter and less cylindrical, being pro- portionally wider toward the mouth. Loch Fyne (Jeffr., Brit. Conch., v, p. 197). Var. anulata Jeffr. Narrower and more regularly cylindrical, ornamented with white ring-like marks of growth (Jeffr., Brit. Conch., iii, p. 192). Var. ORTHRUM Watson.
