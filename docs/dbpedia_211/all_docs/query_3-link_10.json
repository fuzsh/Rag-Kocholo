In the course of time, the number of participants has been growing slowly and we hope many more will join eventually. Happy anniversary to all editors, past and present, and thanks for your improvements to gastropod articles and all your contributions to the many informative discussions here over the past 10 years. JoJan (talk)\n\nWell that is a really significant anniversary, and I am sorry I overlooked it. JoJan you must be proud to see how the project has grown over the last 10 years. Congratulations and thanks to everyone who has contributed. Invertzoo (talk)\n\n10 May of 1795 is date of birthday of malacology.[1] Thank you. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nThis overview common name article Limpet just got slammed with a lot of templates which were put in place by an IP address editor. It is true that the article does really need a great deal of work, and plus it often gets edited by people who are apparently not very knowledgeable on the subject, and that seems often to cause detrimental changes. The article is currently listed here at the Community Portal as a \"fix OR\" issues article, so maybe it will get some attention... Hope either way we can work something out to help it get into better shape. These overview articles based on a polyphyletic common name are not at all easy to do well. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI re-wrote the intro and greatly cut down the number of templates that were placed on that page; the person who put them on there appears to have been angry at the time and over-reacted. NPOV applies to templating as well as to adding other content. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nAnother editor, during a discussion about the articles Scallop and Pectinidae, pointed out that a search for \"winkle\" currently takes a reader straight to the article on Littorina littorea, the common periwinkle, as if that is the only species in the world known as a winkle! That is of course very misleading. I will now try to put together a short overview article about \"winkle\" as a common name that is applied to many species in several families. Anyone who cares to help out will be very welcome. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI created a disambiguation page instead. Hopefully that is a better solution. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nOur underwater photographers may get a laugh out of these humorous underwater images. There are a few sea slugs in them if you scroll down. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nHello, if you are interested in making maps of Conidae there are SHP files at http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data Direct link at: http goo.gl/aaGFf5 I made an example of the map. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nThanks Michal for this very useful information. It seems however that many of our members are not active right now, so although this would be a very good idea, I would be surprised if anyone gets round to doing it. Perhaps it may happen at some point in the future. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nUnfortunately, the data are made freely available to the public for non-commercial use. Therefore they cannot be used in Wikipedia. JoJan (talk)\n\nThe license for images derived from those IUCN SHP files really is CC-BY-SA although is is explicitly written nowhere on the iucnredlist.org webpage. Feel free to verify it at the OTRS Commons:Commons:IUCN Red List – Commons:Template:IUCN map permission. I verified it by myself at the IUCN employee. - Spatial data are available for Conidae only for public download. I will get more information about data for other gastropods sometimes. I will let you know then. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nI have learnt to make those maps of freshwater molluscs (Bivalvia are within those molluscs datasets together with gastropods. This guide apply also for Odonata and for some other group – probably fishes(?)).\n\n1. Download GDB files from IUCN, unzip.\n\n2. Install ArcGIS for Desktop Advanced (ArcInfo) Single Use (under Windows, ArcGIS works for 60 days in Trial mode). I am not sure if other programs can process GDB files.\n\n3. Run ArcMap.\n\n4. File / Add data / Connect to folder (Navigate to Eastern_Himalayas.gdb folder), Add.\n\nSelect the dataset EASTERN_HIMALAYAS_FWMollusc, Add.\n\n5. Selection / Select by attributes /\n\nClick to binomial, click to =, click to Get Unique Values, select a specie you want and click to it. There will be for example: binomial = 'Assiminea brevicula' Verify, OK. Apply. (This will select distribution area of a chosen species.)\n\n6. Right click at \"EASTERN_HIMALAYAS_FWMollusc\" / Data / Export Data /\n\nFill Output feature class, for example: \"D:\\IUCN\\Eastern Himalayas Gastropoda\\Assiminea brevicula.shp\". OK. This will export distribution data files for Assiminea brevicula including the \"Assiminea brevicula.shp\" file for further use in other GIS programs.\n\n7. Now you have SHP files for a separate species and you can use it in other programs, for example in Quantum GIS: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Rbrausse/distribution_maps_with_QGIS\n\nNotes:\n\nDatasets available: Eastern Himalayas, Indo-Burma, Pan Africa, Western Ghats. They have freshwater molluscs inside.\n\n\"Indo Burma\" dataset is larger than \"Eastern Himalayas\" dataset. This means if there is the same species in both of them, use the \"Indo Burma\" dataset. (example: Assiminea brevicula). But some species are in the \"Eastern Himalayas\" dataset only. If the species is in more datasets, use all of them.\n\nFor some species there are some distribution data available, even if they have no map on the IUCN website. Such distribution data may be incomplete. But some of them appear to be complete.\n\nNo datasets are freely downloadable for terrestrial gastropods. Data for them can be probably obtained one by one requests. I am not sure if the CC-BY-SA licence apply also for terrestrial ones. - (The same question should be resolved for American, European and Australian gastropods and for other marine gastropods.)\n\n--Snek01 (talk) 21:39, 20 August 2014 (UTC), corrected --Snek01 (talk)\n\nHello there! As you may already know, most WikiProjects here on Wikipedia struggle to stay active after they've been founded. I believe there is a lot of potential for WikiProjects to facilitate collaboration across subject areas, so I have submitted a grant proposal with the Wikimedia Foundation for the \"WikiProject X\" project. WikiProject X will study what makes WikiProjects succeed in retaining editors and then design a prototype WikiProject system that will recruit contributors to WikiProjects and help them run effectively. Please review the proposal here and leave feedback. If you have any questions, you can ask on the proposal page or leave a message on my talk page. Thank you for your time! Harej (talk)\n\nCopied from the proposal talk page:\n\nCould you explain what you mean by, \"to facilitate collaboration across subject areas\". Do you mean that the various different projects should be collaborating with one another more than they do? Or do you mean something else, such as that people should collaborate within one project who are currently usually working on different subject areas? Invertzoo (talk)\n\nHello Invertzoo, that was clumsy wording on my part. I meant within subject areas. Sorry for the confusion! harej (talk)\n\nThere is a discussion at the Anatomy Project about a mismatch between the title of the project and its scope. The title refers broadly to anatomy, but the project rejects all articles that are not primarily about human anatomy. For example, none of the articles in Category:Mollusc anatomy are accepted by the project. There is a similar issue with WikiProject Physiology. --Epipelagic (talk)\n\nEpipelagic has created a new project, WikiProject Animal anatomy. Interested people will want to go and check it out. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nHello, Rathouisia leonina will appear as a DYK hook. I would like to ask, if you could check out captions on the image File:Rathouisia leonina anatomy.png. I slightly modified Heude's 1880s captions and I would like to be sure, that they are correct. I will modify captions on the image if needed. original image and original image description in French language. Thanks. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nHello everyone!\n\nYou may have received a message from me earlier asking you to comment on my WikiProject X proposal. The good news is that WikiProject X is now live! In our first phase, we are focusing on research. At this time, we are looking for people to share their experiences with WikiProjects: good, bad, or neutral. We are also looking for WikiProjects that may be interested in trying out new tools and layouts that will make participating easier and projects easier to maintain. If you or your WikiProject are interested, check us out! Note that this is an opt-in program; no WikiProject will be required to change anything against its wishes. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you!\n\nNote: To receive additional notifications about WikiProject X on this talk page, please add this page to Wikipedia:WikiProject X/Newsletter. Otherwise, this will be the last notification sent about WikiProject X.\n\nHarej (talk)\n\nI am curious to see what other people think about this new stub and whether it should become a redirect. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nWoRMS hasn't changed its entry yet. But even then, I think the name of the family will remain valid, even if it is devoid of genera. JoJan (talk)\n\nSo, should I make a taxobox? And change the intro? Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI think this would be best. JoJan (talk)\n\nFixed it up now. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nSee talk page of Reproductive system of gastropods. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nThank you Michal for the \"heads up\" on these important issues! Invertzoo (talk)\n\nThis article was first created in May 2014. However the person who created it, User: Melanie VH, wrote it to be only about land slugs, not understanding that land slugs are a very polyphyletic group. We accepted the article, hoping it could become part of a much larger article (or perhaps several articles) on mating in all the different gastropod groups. Unfortunately not much has been added to it at all in the past 8 months. Can anyone add something to it about a group of gastropods that they are familiar with? Thanks. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nIf not, then we may have to turn it back into an article about mating in pulmonate land slugs I suppose, because currently it is attracting some negative attention from editors who are outside this project. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nPer a recent identification of 6 cryptic species within the formerly monotypic Alviniconcha, I believe they should all be described in one complete article rather than 6 largely redundant stubs. Please see discussion at Talk:Alviniconcha#Proposal: All Alviniconcha species in one article. Cheers. --Animalparty-- (talk)\n\nGreetings, --Animalparty--! Sounds like a reasonable idea to me. --Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\nNothing wrong with that. JoJan (talk)\n\nThere is nothing wrong with few stubs, there is nothing wrong with red links. Such exceptions are not good. But if it must be for now, then those species in the Alvinichoncha article should be marked in bold. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nI was away when this merge-type listing was proposed. I accept it now how it currently is, but I would have preferred the species to exist as separate articles. It is quite likely that more will become known about these individual species over time. Philosophically I am a Wikipedia eventualist, not an immediatist. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI marked the species in boldface. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI'm not a big fan of one sentence stubs on cryptic species. But I'm also not a fan of creating redirects from valid binomials to genera. Leaving the red-links would have been better, in my opinion. I've been tagging plant species redirects to genera with {{R plants with possibilities}} (which puts them in Category:Plants redirects with possibilities). Perhaps you could adopt a similar approach for flagging redirects that should eventually be expanded into articles? I realize the editor-base for gastropods is low, and it might be a very long time before the redirects are expanded. Plantdrew (talk)\n\nWe are gradually inching our way up towards the 30,000 article mark! Quite a milestone! I remember back in 2009 when Jimmy Wales was very impressed to hear that we had over 2,000 articles on gastropods.\n\nCurrently, User:Bernardp is making large numbers of very good start articles on nudibranchs, with many of his fine underwater photographs, enormously improving our coverage of that group. User:JoJan is working away on many more obscure groups of shelled marine gastropods. User:Snek01 comes in every once in a while and creates a good new non-marine gastropod article. I sincerely thank everyone who is still active on this project for their fine work.\n\nInvertzoo (talk)\n\nA couple of days ago a new stub appeared about Lumaca romana, Roman snails in a historical context. The text, short though it is, was almost unintelligible until I fixed the prose, and this short stub currently has no references at all. The blue links within it are to the Latin Wikipedia. I put a merge tag at the top but unless we can come up with some references, should this be merged, deleted or what? Invertzoo (talk)\n\nJoJan found a good reference, and the info in that stub has now been merged with the article on Heliciculture. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nHi all. I've been uploading some old gastropod diagrams to Commons, and came upon some labelled Triton, which is apparently a synonym of Charonia (a redirect to Triton (gastropod). However, the article Ranellidae also says \"triton\" is a common name for the family. So my question is, which is the most appropriate redirect of Triton (gastropod): the genus, the family, or other? In other words, are there some (or many) species commonly called tritons that are not in the genus Charonia? Cheers, --Animalparty-- (talk)\n\nThis is one of the reasons I'm against naming articles with the common name. Scientific names are unambiguous. One can always make the common name a redirect to the scientific name. Therefore I've made Triton (gastropod) a redirect to Charonia. This should solve the problem. JoJan (talk)\n\nYikes, that's not an easy question to answer. There are no species called \"triton\" that are not in the family Ranellidae, but I think there are plenty of species that get called \"something triton\" which are not in the genus Charonia. I do think that Charonia is often called \"Triton's trumpet\" rather than just \"triton\", but it might require some google research to see which terms are most often used for which taxa. Also in my experience, common name usage seems to evolve and change over time, so a name that was most often used 40 years ago may no longer be the dominant name now. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nA new table ranks WikiProjects by how many changes to all of their pages have been made in the last year. Our project comes in at # 358 out of a total of 2,355. I suppose that is not bad. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nMy understanding is that Wikipedia:Database reports/WikiProjects by changes tracks changes to \"project\" pages. While I'm not quite sure how that is defined, I assume it probably means changes to pages in Wikipedia space (like this talk page). The table doesn't report number of edits to regular article pages that have a WikiProject banner. The table does measure WikiProject activity in a way, but not in the way you might expect.\n\nThere have certainly been more than 261 edits to gastropod related articles in the last year. I suspect that Gastropods rates higher than 358/2355 if edits in articles space are taken into account. Plantdrew (talk)\n\nOh I see! That's interesting! Thanks Plantdrew! Invertzoo (talk)\n\nIf counted exactly, we should rank somewhere in the top of the list, since I make about 20 or more changes daily. And that's just me. What about the edits of all the others ? JoJan (talk)\n\nOn the talk page it is pointed out that the report \"shows activity of the WikiProject itself, not activity on the articles of that project. In other words, the edits are to pages whose name starts with Wikipedia:WikiProject Foo/.\" I guess here at the Gastropods Project we don't have that many pages in the Project itself, and most of then are not edited very often. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nIf anyone has a chance, please check to see how this article is doing during its GA assessment, and help out if you can. Thanks. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI think I can help. Do we have enough time? --Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\nThanks so much Daniel for your helpful edits. I would think there is not much time left at all, but the reviewer seems to be patient with us fortunately.

Unfortunately we are currently very understaffed here at Project Gastropods, with only a very few active members, so I don't know how long it will be before we can take advance of this list to fill in some of the worst gaps in our coverage. Thanks again for your help, Invertzoo (talk)\n\nNo worries. It's a shame there isn't more activity here (seems to be a lot of very quiet WikiProjects), but it's good to see one person holding the fort at least. —Pengo\n\nThanks Pengo. There are three of us that are quite busy here, and another few that are working every once in a while. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nThings are, as they say, snail-paced... --Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\nThere is a statement on the Project Gastropods banner that states:\n\n\"Taxonomy\n\nFor all marine species, Project Gastropods uses the taxonomy in the online database WoRMS.\"\n\nWhen I create a new article I would like to follow this advice, and in Carinaria cristata I did so. Contrast this with Firoloida where I went along with the established Gastropod-article-in-Wikipedia practice of using unranked clades, a practice which I really dislike. I am sure this matter must have been discussed within the project in the past and I can see that uniformity of practice within Wikipedia is desirable, but, if I reference something to WoRMS, I would really like it to replicate the information contained there. Cwmhiraeth (talk)\n\nHello, thank you for notifying this. It must be clarified in the Template:WikiProject Gastropods.\n\nSome previous related discussion:\n\nWikipedia talk:WikiProject Gastropods/Archive 3#2005 taxonomy\n\nWikipedia talk:WikiProject Gastropods/Archive 4#Reliable sources for gastropod taxonomy?\n\nWikipedia talk:WikiProject Gastropods/Archive 5#Is Super family a major rank?.\n\nI will do my best to clarify the actual situation. The situation factually has not changed since 2005. We depend on the Taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005) because it is the only new taxonomy, that classify all gastropods including marine, non-marine and fossil taxa. There are some changes in the taxonomy of gastropods since 2005 – some of those changes are minor and some of those are crucial, but they are always within the sense of Bouchet et al. Every new changes should be handled very carefully with deep understanding of taxonomy of not only the particular group but usually also with understanding of all other gastropods.\n\nThe authors of WoRMS also use exactly the same taxonomy scheme by Bouchet et al. including clades as we on Wikipedia do. The WoRMS is made by experts for experts. They know that Pterotracheoidea is within Caenogastropoda/Hypsogastropoda/Littorinimorpha, but WoRMS database does not allow to put many ranks around the ordo rank. Therefore they simplified it and ommited some taxa (because of limitaion of their database). They ommited Hypsogastropoda in this case, but in some other cases they had to omit few more taxa. WoRMS focus on marine gastropods only, therefore we can not rely on WoRMS only. If we would rely on WoRMS only now, then we would not be able classify all gastropods in a unified way.\n\nWe can like or dislike it, but as encyclopedians we should at least respect it. Clades are used not for fun, not for make things more complicated, but because they are necessary. \"The systematics of some groups [of gastropods], in particular, is so problematic that precludes the advance of other biological fields.\"[1] I am proud, that taxonomy of gastropods is in the forefront and that we can present it to the general public in an actual way to move human knowledge forward.\n\nTherefore it is still valid, that for articles about gastropod species should be taxonomy (using unranked clades) copied from the certain family articles. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nThank you for your detailed reply. Cwmhiraeth (talk)\n\nDoes someone know how to upload this figure from the UK wikipediauk:Файл:Lottia alveus.jpg#filelinks to Commons? --Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\nGood catch! I would recommend to contact the uploader to upload it by himself/herself to Wikimedia Commons. He/She is active on Commons. Maybe it would be also necessary to send written permission for this image to OTRS. I contacted the uploader. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nThank you Snek01 =D! --Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\nWell... Snek and the rest of us did it! That's great to have another GA in the project. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nHello folks, Today I was going over the article on Semicassis granulata and updating it a little. The article struck me as being really in very good shape overall. I don't know if anyone wants to be bothered, but I think this article could be submitted for Good Article status without too much work being involved in getting it to pass. A few years ago the article was an unsuccessful student project, and as such it was submitted twice for GA and failed both times. It has since been cleaned up tremendously. I am currently on vacation, but I would love to hear from anyone who might want to help out with submitting this for GA. Wikipedia's standards have risen steadily over the years, but GA is still not nearly as difficult to attain as FA. Best, Invertzoo (talk)\n\nIt does look good, indeed. If this goes for GA review, then I'll help however I can.--Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\nIn fact, I might even review it myself...--Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\nThat would be great either way. Is it OK for you to be the primary reviewer in terms of the rules? Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI'm not one of the main contributors, so I don't see why not. But I'm not completely sure about that!--Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\nI read the instructions and it does seem to be the case that you could review it. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nThat does look to be a candidate for good article status, in my opinion. Being a member of this project, but not having done much in a while to help it out (been doing other wiki-things, and there's only so much time a sane person is willing or able to spend on WP, lol) I was wondering about the review process for good articles when I saw this. I have skimmed over the criteria over at [[WP:WIAGA]] sometime in the past , so I am at least familiar with it, but I should probably look at it in some more detail. Anyways, is their anything I can do to help with the review process? SarrCat ∑;3\n\nI am familiar with the GA criteria and without having given the article a detailed examination, it looks in pretty good shape to me. Perhaps the lead could be expanded a little so as to better summarise the contents of the rest of the article. Any other imperfections could be ironed out during the GA review process. Cwmhiraeth (talk)\n\nThanks everyone! I think we should tinker with it and then submit it ASAP. I honestly think it will probably not be too much work to get it through. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI am away on vacation/field trip till the 23rd May and then away again on a marine expedition from June 7th to June 28th during which time I will probably be very busy, but if someone goes ahead and submits the article for GA, I will do every thing I can to help out. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI am strongly tempted to just go ahead and submit it myself now, and if we get a reviewer rapidly (that can sometimes take a long time), if I am not available at all times to do the necessary fix-it work, either because I am in transit from one country to another, or because I am working flat out during the expedition (June 7 to 28), I am hoping that others, including Sarrcat and Cwmhiraeth (thanks for volunteering with this) will check the article talk page every day and help carry out the fixing-up process as needed. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI have now submitted the article. Yay. I hope we can all help out and get this done. It is about time this article made it to GA. Best wishes to everyone involved. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nLet the review begin =D --Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\nScotch bonnet (sea snail) is now a Good Article!\n\nThanks to everyone who helped with the refining process! It is great for the project to achieve another GA, Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI was looking at the northern moon snail article whose title, Lunatia heros, contradicts the article text which states the species name is Polinices heros. WoRMS lists Euspira heros as the accepted name. A bit confused as to what the article title should be and what the \"correct\" genus for this species is. 73.223.96.73 (talk)\n\nI moved the article to Euspira heros and edited it a bit. JoJan (talk)\n\nI heard back from my expert on biological Latin, and he did the translation for me of the original description without charge. I have placed it in the article. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nBased on the number of people who have the project main page and/or talk page on their watch list (in our case 64 people), our project is 365th on the list here:\n\nWikipedia:Database reports/WikiProject watchers\n\nInvertzoo (talk)\n\nHi. I'm afraid I'm very clueless about your field, but, coming to this from a placename interest, I wondered if anyone could tell me about where the name Embletoniidae came from, and is it something that it's appropriate to mention, if there's an RS in the article? Anyway, if anyone is interested in pitching in, here it is: Talk:Embletoniidae#Etymology. Sorry to bother you if this isn't your kind of thing. Best wishes to all, DBaK (talk)\n\nPeople replied to this question on the talk page of the article Embletoniidae, and by editing the articles itself. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nCan someone review my request at Wikipedia:WikiProject Gastropods/Assessment.\n\nHello back at you. It would help a lot if you told us who you are and what article you are talking about. Thanks. I assume you are talking about Nembrotha cristata?That article was upgraded to a Start a while ago. It might be a little better than a Start but perhaps not very much. Maybe it would qualify as a C, but many of the statements in it could use a ref. What else would you like to know? Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI copied this here to let anyone who is reading know that the article could use some more fixing up. Invertzoo (talk)\n\n..............................................\n\nHello! This is a note to let the editors of this article know that File:Nembrotha cristata bunaken.jpg will be appearing as picture of the day on September 23, 2015. You can view and edit the POTD blurb at Template:POTD/2015-09-23. If this article needs any attention or maintenance, it would be preferable if that could be done before its appearance on the Main Page. Thanks! — Chris Woodrich (talk)\n\nI would be grateful if someone familiar with mollusc taxonomy would kindly check the species names mentioned in Annie Law, derived from a 1927 source, and match them against current names.\n\nHi User:Pigsonthewing! Ok, let's go:\n\nVitrina latissima Lewis is a synonym of Vitrinizonites latissimus (J. Lewis, 1875). Source: ITIS\n\nHelix chilhoweensis Lewis is a synonym of Appalachina chilhoweensis (J. Lewis, 1870). Source: ITIS\n\nI couldn't easily verify Zonites acerra, Z. cerinoidea and Zonites lawi (single \"i\"). These will take a while.\n\nUnio lawi (single \"i\") is a synonym of Pleurobema oviforme (Conrad, 1834). Source: Mussel Project\n\nThat's it for now! --Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\n@Daniel Cavallari: Thank you. How would you express those changes in the article in question (please edit it directly if you like)? BTW, I found sources with both \"i\" and \"ii\" versions.\n\nYou're welcome! I think we could use the synonym names, as long as we link them to the correct articles (i.e., the accepted names). I did just that for Unio lawi. We'll need to create stubs for the missing names, of course. As for the single or double \"i\" thing, it's a complicated matter indeed. It may depend on how the name was first described, and the ICZN has a few recommendations. Here is an example. --Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\nRejoice, my fellow gastropod people!

Orcula Troschel, 1846 is a later homonym, published for sea cucumbers. The correct author for the land snails genus is Held, 1837 -- clearly shown in the two cited sources at the bottom of the page. 22:11, 30 November 2015‎ 160.111.253.35 (talk)\n\nAuthorship has been corrected. JoJan (talk)\n\nGreen abalone and Haliotis fulgens are separate articles, but this is the exact same species. It has been tagged for merge in almost 2 years (since February 2014), but nothing has happened. How does one resolve two articles dealing with the exact same species? 62.107.210.94 (talk)\n\nIt's only a matter of taking the time to edit one of the articles so that it contains all the information from both, and then turning the other into a redirect. More information for how to do it is at Wikipedia:Merging#How to merge. Sometimes a discussion is needed about whether to merge the articles, but this is a very clear cut case so it's just a matter of someone making the effort to do it. —Pengo\n\nI merged the two articles yesterday I merged them under Haliotis fulgens but someone can change that if they feel that the common name is more suitable. I want to thank 62.107.210.94 for letting us know about this duplication, and also I want to thank Pengo for explaining how 62.107.210.94 could go about doing the merge. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nSomehow I managed to miss the initial reply; thanks to Pengo for explaining and Invertzoo for making the edits. 62.107.194.196 (talk)\n\nI've been browsing Wikipedia articles on species found in the Kermadec Islands and noticed the above article may possibly need an amendment to its title. I noted on the talk page that it states \"Project Gastropods uses the taxonomy in the online database WoRMS\". It appears from that database that the currently accepted species name of this gastropod is Casmaria perryi (Iredale, 1912). I refer you to this link. I hope this helps. Ambrosia10 (talk)\n\nThanks so much for alerting us to this necessary change. I carried it out. Next time if you find something like this, you can make the change yourself, using the \"Move\" function. If you don't know how to do this yet, you can always ask me. :) Invertzoo (talk)\n\nHello, feel free to verify, that all informations in the Aplysia morio article are species specific. There were some informations referred to some other species in the genus removed from the article. All informations seems very probable, but I am very suspicious of the reference by Coviello. This reference is written in dubious way. It would be very helpful if we could check out every single fact from the Distribution section and from Ecology section according to others peer reviewed articles. Just to be sure. Thanks, --Snek01 (talk)\n\nHappy New Year 2016! A few memorable things have happened in our project in 2015. In the past year we've passed the threshold of 30,000 articles. We have received in the Commons a generous donation by Naturalis, Leiden, the Netherlands, of more than 30,000 photos of museum specimens. That's a lot to deal with but in the end we'll manage. This donation brings the total of gastropod photos in the Commons to somewhere between 33,000 and 34,000.\n\nBy this short message, I wish to send my best wishes to all our collaborators. And who knows, perhaps our little group of active collaborators will grow considerably in 2016.\n\nJoJan (talk)\n\nHappy New Year! I will check out freshwater snails for images. I found Rivomarginella meantime. Maybe there are few more useful images. I also started to categorize them like this into the family level (although they are automatically categorized into usual categories of species and generic level – unfortunately to both):\n\nMolluscs at Naturalis from the Zoölogisch Museum Amsterdam\n\nGastropoda at Naturalis from the Zoölogisch Museum Amsterdam\n\nMarginellidae at Naturalis from the Zoölogisch Museum Amsterdam\n\nMolluscs at Naturalis from the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie\n\nIt is necessary to note, that there are two musea in Naturalis, so take care. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nOf course. In the mean time, their donation has grown to over 68,000. ([1]). JoJan (talk)\n\nA new article about Archachatina camerunensis has been translated into English after originally being posted in Russian. It is written in note form and lacking in prose, categories, wikilinks, etc. It needs some expert attention, so hopefully somebody in this project can help. AtHomeIn神戸 (talk)\n\nDone. JoJan (talk)\n\nThanks JoJan :) AtHomeIn神戸 (talk)\n\nI have clean up the prose some more. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI attempted to merge the duplicate type_species parameters in Dianella (gastropod). it would be great if someone could sort it out properly. Frietjes (talk)\n\nTwo days ago, this article was created, by an editor that is, so far, a one-purpose account. I can't find any evidence that anyone has actually declared a day for celebrating nudibranchs, so unfortunately this may have to be considered a hoax. I will however try to do a bit more research. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI decided to rescue the article by moving it to Symposia and workshops on opisthobranchs. I did a lot of work on it and racked up a few references. I may have to stop where I am because I have a lot of other stuff I need to work on today. If anyone wants to take a look at, it please go ahead. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI have done a few hours work on researching the original topic and its various ramifications. I have expanded the article a little bit. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nSuteria ide is a new article recently accepted at AFC, the genus is not listed on the Charopidae page so it may have changed recently – the sources cited in the article are fairly old. In addition the genus page Suteria is redirected to a plant genus. Roger (Dodger67) (talk)\n\nThanks Roger for alerting us to this. :) I have polished up the new article a bit although the original references still need to be fixed Wiki style. I added this genus to the Charopidae page which is supported by the WoRMS listing for that family. I created a new genus page and disambiguated the genus Suteria on both pages. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI fixed the referencing, it's all consistent now. There is no such thing as \"wiki style\" referencing. Any method that clearly identifies the sources is acceptable, but it must be consistent, a mix of different methods is deprecated. Parenthetical disambiguation is only used if there are three or more affected pages, for only two pages a hatnote is used. Roger (Dodger67) (talk)\n\nHe is out of my field. I only found his name while resolving a bad {{disambiguation needed}} bluelink. He seems to have been a major binomial authority for gastropods, deserving a {{Zoologist|Jonas}} tag in his biography. He's all over Wiki, but rarely linked to. He often turns up in searches as J. H. Jonas, so may have sometimes published under a less obviously Jewish name (which I haven't been able to identify).\n\nI found one tiny scrap of biography, which identifies his family and dates.\n\nCan I leave him on your expert doorsteps? He may need study of actual books. I'm busy with other things, and not sure I could do him justice. Narky Blert (talk)\n\nI gave it a try. JoJan (talk)\n\n@Jojan: & now he's in Wiki, where he belongs :-) 53 species, even if some are junior synonyms, is pretty good going. I added a couple of categories, and his name to Jonas (name)#Notable people with the surname Jonas, and a link in your article to the German article on the Hamburg Natural History Museum. Narky Blert (talk)\n\nNew article, improvements welcome – especially if you know of any other species he described. Narky Blert (talk)\n\nHello, there is a Category:Nudibranchia filled with articles of species(!). This contravene the principle of categorization and the guideline Wikipedia:Categorization#Subcategorization: \"an article should be categorised as low down in the category hierarchy as possible, without duplication in parent categories above it\". We have categorized all gastropod species and genera in a category at family level unanimously/standardly.\n\nCategory:Heterobranchia\n\nCategory:Nudipleura\n\nCategory:Nudibranchia\n\nCategory:Pleurolidiidae\n\narticle Pleurolidia juliae should be categorized in the Category:Pleurolidiidae. Not in Category:Nudibranchia.\n\nThose >900 articles species/genera should be removed from the Category:Nudibranchia and those ~70 articles should be removed from Category:Nudipleura, because they are categorized at family level already. I am sorry I did not noticed it two years ago, because I edit non-marine ones mainly. (A good example is for example Category:Panpulmonata, where there are articles of higher taxa only.) If it will became necessary (or anyhow useful) to keep Category:Nudibranchia, then you can move relevant categories of families from Category:Nudipleura to Category:Nudibranchia. Otherwise you can even delete Category:Nudibranchia. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nPlease feel free to make these changes yourself, as the project does not have many members now, and some of those who are still active no longer spend much time onsite. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nAn stub article was recently started for Gustav Schwartz. The article's creator, User:MB asked me if this person was the Schwartz who is honored by Alvania schwartziana. It seems unlikely to me that there would be any other Schwartzs working on Rissoidae in the mid-19th century, but I can't find anything to confirm that etymology of the epithet. Plantdrew (talk)\n\nThere is also a whole genus Schwartziella to which the same question applies. MB (talk)\n\nYes, both of them are named in honor of Gustav Schwartz. It is always useful to find authority reference for every taxon. But it is usually the only source for its etymology. The authority reference citation for those two species is mentioned in WoRMS. The authority reference directly mention \"Schwartz von Mohrenstern\". --Snek01 (talk)\n\nHello, the reviewer requested to improve English of the Scaly-foot gastropod, which is under the GA review. Could you help me with clear prose, spelling and grammar, please? It would be helpful if you could focus on the grammar only. I can deal with all reviewers comments and questions easily then. Thanks! --Snek01 (talk)\n\nI have gone through the whole article once, carefully fixing the prose as best as I can. Yes the grammar was faulty, but often the prose construction was faulty as well. There were not many spelling mistakes that I noticed. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nExcellent! Thank you. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nThis article has now reached GA status. :) Invertzoo (talk)\n\nAmazing =)!

Nevill is a redlink, but may soon be a disambiguation page (76 results for All pages with titles containing nevill).\n\nI've tried but failed to track down online the papers in which those species were described. Can anyone help resolve the puzzle of who the binomial authority or authorities was or were? I suspect it was always Geoffrey, both because of his profession and because I've seen attributions to \"G. Nevill\" in some sources; but suspicion isn't good enough, those writers might have been guessing in the same way I just did.\n\nIn any event, it looks to me as if Geoffrey might deserve an article – there are two good-looking sources in that museum.wales link at the top of this post.

I tried the system and it gave far neater arrangements than the present manual clades in nudibranchs, where the word clade is in the right-hand column. Also it will make taxonomic changes easier to implement and ensure consistency. See Tergipes tergipes as opposed to Tenellia pustulata. However I then ran into some comments on why are we showing all the clades and not just the main Linnean hierarchy. See discussion here: Template talk:Taxonomy/Cladobranchia. BernardP (talk)\n\nHello, it does not gave far neater arrangements, it does not provide changes easier to implement and it does not ensure consistency. That is complex of questions.\n\n1) Are all ranks between class and superfamily important IN GASTROPODS? Yes, they are. All ranks between these ranks should be included in all taxoboxes. Related discussion on this theme include:\n\nWikipedia talk:WikiProject Gastropods/Archive 3#Taxobox rank inclusion. There is written, that we, malacologists, are unable to get proper overview of classification if there would be only few clades written.\n\nWikipedia talk:WikiProject Gastropods/Archive 5#Is Super family a major rank? That applies for the superfamily also.\n\nThat applies for subfamily, genus, subgenus where applicable, of course.\n\nAs all we know, some gastropods have only one, some have three, some have five and some have ten those clades. Is is not possible to say which of those clades are more important or less important.\n\nI also like the explanation at Talk:Cypraeidae#Intermediary Taxa, that contain some useful ideas.\n\n2) Is automatic taxobox better than classical taxobox? No authoritative answer can be done for now. This is unresolved in this project as well as for example in Wikiproject tree of life.\n\nI am strong opponent of automatic taxobox (as everybody knows here). The automatic taxobox has the only (theoretical) advantage: the change of all subtaxa is needed to be done only once (at the right place). What will happen, when the editor does not know the right place? There are also difficulties and disadvantages: those taxoboxes even does not look the same. (Why is the word \"clade\" in italics???) The complete classification for one species is not on the single place, but it is on as many subpages as there is number of its ranks. Therefore you can not track changes. For example you can not take a look, how the classification of the certain species was like a year ago, because you would have take a look into the history of those about 10 pages all at once. It is prone to errors (to intentional and unintentional). You can not use the same referencing way; you can not add the same certain reference (for the Wikipedia article) into the superior taxon (because it is in different subtemplate).\n\nI can not use automatic taxobox even if I would like to: it is difficult to use and I can not verify the classification, because automatic taxobox has no complex history. That is serious problem when the taxonomy (of gastropods) is extremely difficult and when we have no relatively simple, uncontroversial resource for classification of ALL gastropods (marine, non-marine, fossil).\n\n3) You provided two examples:\n\nTergipes tergipes uses automatic taxobox and shows classification like this:\n\nClass: Gastropoda Clade: Heterobranchia Clade: Euthyneura Clade: Nudipleura Order: Nudibranchia Clade: Dexiarchia Infraorder: Cladobranchia Clade: Aeolidida Superfamily: Fionoidea Family: Fionidae\n\nTenellia pustulata uses classic taxobox and shows classification like this:\n\nClass: Gastropoda (unranked): clade Heterobranchia clade Euthyneura clade Nudipleura clade Nudibranchia clade Dexiarchia clade Cladobranchia clade Aeolidida Superfamily: Fionoidea Family: Fionidae\n\nI will challenge this classification. Why is Cladobranchia listed as infraorder? Could you provide some peer reviewed reference, that would acknowledge it (including all those seven related ranks)? By the way, WoRMS is not reliable resource for ranks:\n\n2011 discussion: Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Gastropods/Archive 4#Reliable sources for gastropod taxonomy?\n\n2015 discussion: Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Gastropods/Archive 6#Taxonomy\n\nThere would possible to talk about this theme infinitely. But I am quite skeptical because automatic taxobox was forced to Wikipedia very brutally. The correct way would be like this: to create such automatic taxobox, that would be 1) either compatible; 2) or that would be better – then it would be possible to replace old solution with better solution. Every other possibility is against unification, against standardization and against cooperative spirit of Wikipedia. The actual state is harming Wikiproject Gastropods. Moreover the Wikiproject Paleontology strongly overlap with Wikiproject Gastropods. Unfortunatelly Wikiproject Paleontology uses Automatic taxobox as a standard. I wrote what is the best for gastropods. Unfortunately it seems for a long time, that this project is very small in number of its active members to resolve any problem that is behind this project boundaries. What if there is 50% of people against 50% of people on a global scale? Then the Wikiproject Gastropods will suffer forever. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nThis is not an easy matter. We cannot even pretend to have the knowledge to construct a taxobox (classical or automatic) that shows all the ramifications of the taxonomy of a taxon. This would be \"original research\" and is forbidden in Wikipedia; We can only follow what is the most actual viewpoint in scientific literature and otherwise rely on WORMS. Snek is against automatic taxoboxes and that is his good right. I'm rather for automatic taxoboxes, because it becomes easy to change it. Just think of the Conoidea superfamily and especially the Turridae family, that has been split into several new families. If all articles within Turridae had been provided with automatic taxoboxes, hundreds if not more than a thousand taxoboxes could have been changed with a few clicks. Now this has to be done manually and it is a giant undertaking. Are automatic taxoboxes then THE solution ? No, first of al, all higher taxa must have also an automatic taxobox for consistency in taxonomy. Snek gives some very critical remarks with this regard to consistency. If his remarks can be overcome, automatic taxoboxes are certainly the solution. Much thus depends, for some time to come, on the personal opinion of each one of us. JoJan (talk)\n\nT.Shafee(Evo&Evo)talk\n\nThere is currently a merger proposal for the article Clam to be merged into Bivalvia. Please comment at Talk:Bivalvia#Proposed merger of Clam into Bivalvia.\n\nYes, I know bivalves aren't gastropods. But this project is more active and might be watched by editors who've worked on both classes that may not also be watching WikiProject Bivalves.\n\nThe merger proposal has bearing on a frequently appearing formulaic lead sentence, as can be seen at Cerastoderma edule; \"Cerastoderma edule, commonly known as the common cockle, is a species of edible saltwater clam, a marine bivalve mollusc...\". Bolded words in this lead are used in various articles on species that are also described as cockles, mussels, oysters and scallops. Is \"clam\" really a catch all term for ALL bivalves? Plantdrew (talk)\n\nPleurotomella coeloraphe & Pleurotomella coelorhaphe appear to describe the same species. As gastropods are not my field, though, I don't know which of the two spellings is the valid binomial. AddWittyNameHere (talk)\n\nThank you very much for noticing this and telling us about it. You are right: Pleurotomella coeloraphe is a mis-spelling of the correct name. I will make it into a redirect page. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nHello, I requested this bot task: Wikipedia:Bot requests#Replacement of NCBI template in gastropods articles. Snek01 (talk)\n\nDone\n\nWe – Community Tech – are happy to announce that the Popular pages bot is back up-and-running (after a one year hiatus)! You're receiving this message because your WikiProject or task force is signed up to receive the popular pages report. Every month, will post at Wikipedia:WikiProject Gastropods/Archive 6/Popular pages with a list of the most-viewed pages over the previous month that are within the scope of WikiProject Gastropods.\n\nWe've made some enhancements to the original report. Here's what's new:\n\nThe pageview data includes both desktop and mobile data.\n\nThe report will include a link to the pageviews tool for each article, to dig deeper into any surprises or anomalies.\n\nThe report will include the total pageviews for the entire project (including redirects).\n\nWe're grateful to for his original , and we wish his bot a happy robot retirement. Just as before, we hope the popular pages reports will aid you in understanding the reach of WikiProject Gastropods, and what articles may be deserving of more attention. If you have any questions or concerns please contact us at m:User talk:Community Tech bot.\n\nWarm regards, the Community Tech Team 17:16, 17 May 2017 (UTC)\n\nDoes anyone have any information on this genus? I'm making a list of animals in Utah, and Ogaridiscus subrupicola is listed as one of the species of snail (at least I think it's a snail) in Utah (see here). Please {{ping}} me on any reply. ···日本穣 · 投稿 · Talk to Nihonjoe · Join WP Japan!\n\nLooks like they have a page on the species on the Swedish Wikipedia. I'll see about translating it and making the page here. ···日本穣 · 投稿 · Talk to Nihonjoe · Join WP Japan!\n\nOkay, I made Ogaridiscus subrupicola. Please feel free to correct any errors. ···日本穣 · 投稿 · Talk to Nihonjoe · Join WP Japan!\n\nAs you did here. Thank you. ···日本穣 · 投稿 · Talk to Nihonjoe · Join WP Japan!\n\nHello User:Nihonjoe, thank you for your interest in gastropod articles! I did it because Zonitidae is container category as well as any other gastropod category, that has less than 200 species. Although it is explicitly marked as container category since now. (All subcategories of Zonitidae will be deleted.) Thank you for your cooperation. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nSince when did we empty out and merge categories when they have less than 200 pages in them? That's ridiculous. ···日本穣 · 投稿 · Talk to Nihonjoe · Join WP Japan!\n\nHello, this can be explained for example here Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Gastropods/Archive 5#Created a subcategory--did I do wrong? and here Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Gastropods/Archive 4#Split of Category:Turridae stubs and here Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Gastropods/Archive 3#Split of Category:Muricidae and Category:Muricidae stubs. Generally there is an agreement (tradition, consensus, nobody opposed that) that categories (of gastropods) of small families (with approximately less than 200 species) include all species. And there are good reasons for larger families also in some cases, when it is very practical to keep articles in the category of the family. - Correctly organized category in this sense is for example Category:Planorbidae. Another correctly researched and planned category is for example Category:Hygromiidae, but nobody has taken an effort for years, to get rid those redundant subcategories, that were created by Bot. Zonitidae is absolutely non-controversial category and all of its subcategories can be removed without hesitation. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nYou still haven't explained why you are choosing to go against everything supported by consensus in Wikipedia as a whole. There are many valid reasons to have separate categories for each genus, and no valid reasons to get rid of them. Yes, some of them may be small right now, but that doesn't mean they won't be increased as time goes by. Saying it's \"practical\" is not a valid argument. Whether they are all in one category or split into subcategories within that category, they are all still within that category. Whether a bot created the category or not is irrelevant.\n\nNow, regarding the email, whether I'm a bureaucrat or not is irrelevant to what articles I choose to create or edit. In this case, I created this article (and the associated category) because I'm working on a list of fauna for a specific location. That includes gastropods. ···日本穣 · 投稿 · Talk to Nihonjoe · Join WP Japan!\n\nThat is really very surprising question, because I expected at least basal knowledge in biology and in Wikipedia guidelines. If there is one species in the genus Ogaridiscus now, then we can not expect, that the category:Ogaridiscus will be increased as time goes by. So guideline Wikipedia:Overcategorization, and especially WP:SMALLCAT should apply. I deeply hope, that this my explanation is sufficient. If not, I would like to ask any other member of this WikiProject to provide a better one. On the other hand, this discussion is an alarming example, how spreading knowledge of biology is crucially important in this technically oriented civilization. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nPlease stop with the arrogant attitude. Using phrasing like \"alarming example\" makes it sound like you believe anyone without a PhD in biology is a complete moron. Wikipedia can be edited by anyone, so I recommend refraining from driving away people who have done nothing technically wrong. We discover new species of various animals all the time, so assuming that we will only ever have one—especially for something as small and difficult to find as this tiny snail—is ridiculous. There may easily be one or more subspecies that just haven't been found yet. Utah and Idaho are very large places, and there are certainly plenty of places for the snails to hide. I would be surprised if there weren't many different snails in just that area that have yet to be discovered. Having different categories for each genus is actually helpful when trying to figure out relationships between various species. ···日本穣 · 投稿 · Talk to Nihonjoe · Join WP Japan!\n\n(talk page lurker) I will point out the WP:Gastropods policy follows the guidelines for categorization that WP:Categorization has in place Wikipedia:Overcategorization. It really boils down to there being very little growth potential at this time. and in the event there is, it can be split out at that time.--Kevmin §\n\nIn that case, perhaps a clearer edit summary from Snek01 would make things better. Just stating \"{{db-c1}}\" does nothing to tell anyone why the category is suddenly being tagged for deletion. Something along the lines of \"Consolidating to Category:Zonitidae per WP:SMALLCAT\" would be far more clear. That's the whole point of the edit summary: to tell people what and why you're making the edit. ···日本穣 · 投稿 · Talk to Nihonjoe · Join WP Japan!\n\nHello, a User:Verashark completely rewrote the article Reproductive system of gastropods from Special:PermanentLink/758227015 to Special:PermanentLink/773669161. I kept all old texts an included new texts and organized them info into sections. It is worth to take a little attention to this article. Thanks. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nHello, there were some articles marked as needing images, while they virtually has a proper images in them. During the last over 1 or 2 years I properly tagged over 2000 (or more?) of such articles like this. So now the Category:Gastropod articles needing images shows the actual number. Actually there are 21,901 articles needing images (of 30858 articles). Now we (or I) can focus on adding existing images from Commons to Wikipedia articles without images. I recommend the Fist tool http://toolserver.org/~magnus/fist.php for searching images at Commons for articles without images (although it sometimes shows false positive results). The number of articles with images as well as ratio of articles with images/without images is slowly, but continuously increasing and since now you can measure the progress in real numbers. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nDear gastropod friends, it has been a while! Nevertheless, I've been somewhat active lately, so expect some good news soon. Speaking of which, Amphidromus looks promising. Information-wise, the article is quite complete. With an intro expansion and drastic prose improvements, I think it could easily achieve GA. So, what do you think? Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\nFossil distribution: according to Fossilworks the species † Amphidromus ellipticus was recorded at Creechbarrow Hill (Eocene of the United Kingdom) [2] and described in H. Keeping. 1910. On the discovery of Bembridge Limestone fossils on Creechbarrow Hill, Isle of Purbeck. Geological Magazine 5(7):436-439. This site dates from between 40.4 – 37.2 Ma. This is a pre-human fossil occurrence, in conflict with the text in our article. This species is not recorded in our list of Amphidromus species. Or has it become a synonym ? JoJan (talk)\n\nAllright, I'll check that with a friend of mine who happens to be a fossil expert =). I'll give you an update ASAP.--Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\nJoJan, I've checked the info. As a matter of fact, my friend is quite familiarized with the fossils from Creechbarrow Hill. It seems that this so-called Amphidromus record is actually a misidentified Filholia laevolonga (Boubee 1831). Quite a mistake, actually (something on the lines of looking at an armadillo and calling it a rhinoceros, hahaha!). Anyway, we should disregard this Creechbarrow Hill record entirely.--Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\nWell done. Only an expert could have done this. I didn't add this species in the list because I had some doubts. JoJan (talk)\n\nIt should probably be mentioned in the appropriate article(s), though, just so it's there for future reference. Is there a published source that explains what happened? ···日本穣 · 投稿 · Talk to Nihonjoe · Join WP Japan!\n\nActually yes. You can download the paper here. --Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\nThis very interesting paper[1] below discusses the relationship between sinistrality in Amphidromus and predation by snail-eating snakes. We should discuss this somewhere in the article. In several places along the article, actually.--Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\nGood idea to reach GA. I will deal with images and with species list. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nAnd I am working on a thorough cleaning-up of the prose. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nThank you, friends! It's looking better and better! --Daniel Cavallari (talk)\n\nYour GA nomination of Amphidromus\n\nThe article Amphidromus you nominated as a good article has passed ; see Talk:Amphidromus for comments about the article.

Snek01 (talk)\n\nHello, for a long time we have had linked terrestrial gastropod to \"terrestrial animal\" article like this\n\n[[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[gastropod]]\n\nExample:\n\nHelicina rhodostoma is a species of tropical land snail with an operculum, a terrestrial gastropod mollusk in the family Helicinidae.\n\nThere is/was section about gastropods in the terrestrial animal article. terrestrial animal#Terrestrial gastropods\n\nIt was created useful terrestrial mollusc article this year. The previous section will be merged into the new article. But how to wikilink to the new article?\n\nI thought, that everything should link to more precisely named terrestrial gastropod article (with redirect from terrestrial mollusc article). But I checked it out prior to any move. Both are established scientific terms.\n\nGoogle shows 31500 results for \"terrestrial mollusc\" and 203000 results for \"terrestrial gastropod\", but this is highly affected by results from the wikipedia and the high usage of \"terrestrial gastropod\" in Wikipedia and its copies all over the internet.\n\nGoogle Scholar gives for\n\n\"terrestrial mollusc\": 2030 results.\n\n\"terrestrial molluscs\": 4880 results.\n\n\"terrestrial mollusk\": 1250 results,\n\n\"terrestrial mollusks\": 2550 results.\n\naltogether 10710 results\n\n\"terrestrial gastropod\": 2890 results.\n\n\"terrestrial gastropods\": 5630 results.\n\naltogether 8520 results\n\nIt also depends on how many of these papers are from native speakers. We do not know precisely, but many of authors are not native speakers. It seems that malacologists from English speaking countries decided to use \"terrestrial molluscs\". Is is so?\n\nI would like to update wikilinks (semi-automatically by myself) from\n\n[[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[gastropod]]\n\nto terrestrial gastropod wikilink (regardless to which article it will land, either to \"terrestrial gastropod\" or to \"terrestrial mollusc\" article over redirect.)\n\n[[terrestrial gastropod]]\n\nFirst question: Will it be OK to chnege all those wikilinks?

The development and success of online taxonomic authority lists (e.g., WoRMS /MolluscaBase, Catalogue of Life, Australian Faunal Directory), demonstrated that the use of additional ranks – suborder, order, subclass – is favored by many users; consequently, they have been adopted in the classification;\n\n(c) The contents have been expanded to include the class Monoplacophora.\n\n2,604 names (up from 2,400 in 2005) at the rank of subtribe, tribe, subfamily, family and superfamily have been proposed for Recent and fossil gastropods, and another 35 for monoplacophorans. All are listed in a nomenclator giving full bibliographical reference, date of publication, typification, and their nomenclatural availability and validity under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Another 790 names (up from 730 in 2005), established for categories above the family group (infraorder to subclass) are listed separately. In all, the classification now recognizes as valid a total of 721 gastropod families (up from 611 in 2005), of which 245 are known exclusively as fossils and 476 occur in the Recent with or without a fossil record; and 20 monoplacophoran families, of which 1 only occurs as Recent.\n\nThis is an average 132 valid species per family of Recent gastropods – to be compared to 1,000-2,000 for insects and 35-57 for vertebrates.\n\nThe work is accessible electronically on BioOne at http://www.bioone.org/toc/mala/current. Printed copies will also be distributed by ConchBooks.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nEllen E Strong Research Zoologist and Chair Department of Invertebrate Zoology\n\nw 202.633.1742 f 202.357.2343 StrongE@si.edu\n\nSMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION\n\nNATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY\n\n................... The above info added by Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI propose this guideline User:Snek01/Guideline for WikiProject Gastropods for better standardization and consistency within gastropod articles. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nVarious editors, including myself, have been creating categories such as Category:Molluscs described in 2000 and populating them. It is rather slow, repetitive and tedious. I am considering setting up a bot for the task of moving molluscs from \"Animals described in...\" categories to the corresponding \"Molluscs described in...\" category. Any thoughts? I'm asking here because the vast majority of the relevant pages are for gastropods, and it would be a light task if there weren't so many of them. William Avery (talk)\n\nWhy not \"Gastropods described in YYYY\"? The thing I don't understand is that the described in year categories are getting steadily refined, but the refinement happens with no defined ultimate structure. There's an enormous amount of wasted effort in going from \"Animals described in YYY\"->\"Insects described in YYY\"->\"Moths described in YYY\". Figure out what the categories should look like in the end, rather than wasting time making repeated edits refining the categorization one rank down the taxonomy hierarchy each time. If \"Gastropods described in YYYY\" will never be desired, that's fine with me; but if \"Molluscs described in YYYY\" will someday be subject to further refinement, we might as well do that refinement now. I definitely support a bot for this task regardless of what categories end up being used. Plantdrew (talk)\n\nThank you. If there is a consensus to create \"Gastropods described in YYYY\" I will go with that. It's just that I'd really like to get to a point of consistency using the current categories, ASAP. I'd quite to see some sort of warning to editors not to split the categories without consensus. There seem to be a number of partially realised schemes about the place. William Avery (talk)\n\nI must admit, I've added many times the \"Category:Animals described in....\" in the absence of a better category. If this has to be changed by a bot, then I prefer the more specific \"Gastropods described in ...\". And together with these categories by year, there are also list by year such as List of gastropods described in the 2000s. These lists are more elaborate and one can wonder do we need these categories and lists coexisting at the same time ? JoJan (talk)\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I agree with having a dedicated set of categories for gastropods. Thank you both for taking the time to comment. William Avery (talk)\n\n@William Avery: \"Gastropods described in YYYY\" is the only strategic category. Every of them should contain some information template; something like that this category shold not be splitted into subcategories. The parent category will be \"Gastropods by year of formal description\". Thanks, --Snek01 (talk)\n\nThank you. I agree that some mechanism to stop splitting (without getting a consensus at the relevant project page) is highly desirable. William Avery (talk)\n\nI have filed a bot approval request at WP:BRFA#William Avery Bot. William Avery (talk)\n\nThe main photograph for the Acanthinucella punctulata article has a hermit crab inside the snail shell rather than the actual snail. It might be confusing. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 66.75.224.148 (talk)\n\nWhat you say is true, however, the caption does state that fact, and the image is otherwise a good clear photo of the shell, and one which shows many of the diagnostic features.

Peter coxhead (talk)\n\nI'm contemplating a huge undertaking, and I want to run it by this WikiProject first, to make sure I don't run afoul of any special preferences here.\n\nThere is a huge category page, and an almost as huge stub category page for the family Pyramedellidae. The stub page has a tag that it's very large, and it might be good to set up subcategories. I'm thinking of setting up and populating subcategories for the genus Odostomia, within both the family category and the family stub category. I estimate there will be over 400 articles in each. I've completed projects of that scope before. (And it will save me a lot of time if I do them at the same time.)\n\nBut here's the thing I want to check:\n\nI notice that someone set up subcategory pages (the main category, not the stub) for both Odostomia and another large genus Chrisallida. That someone then moved 9 species in one genus and 11 species in the other to their respective subcategories, and then left Wikipedia.\n\nI also recall seeing in the past that WITH THE GASTROPODS, category pages for large families often have a note asking that all species be listed there--for convenience, it says--even if some of them are in subcategories. I don't know why that is. It's not the usual way in Wikipedia, but I don't want to go against Project preferences.\n\nIn this case, should I go ahead and create the subcategories, both in the category and in the stub category, and move all the relevant species? Should I create both subcategories and move the stubs, and add the articles to the non-stub subcategory while leaving them in the main category? Should I just do the stub subcategory, and not do anything with the non-stub? Or should I leave it all alone? Uporządnicki (talk)\n\nI should add that I'm not a member of this WikiProject, nor am I any kind of expert in gastropods. I just go round performing major surgery on categories and lists here. Uporządnicki (talk)\n\nHello, thanks for your message. I am happy that you are interested in gastropods and I appreciate that. Unfortunately there is no need to split the category Category:Pyramidellidae. It is a large category, but splitting will give no advantage. These species will be moving among genera, but probably they will stay in this family. There is no need neverending splitting and merging categories. It is better to focus on improving articles about species. Thank you for your cooperation. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nRegarding categories, it would be useful for this Wikiproject to apply the following ideas:\n\nTo add information to the template like this: Template talk:WPBannerMeta/Archive 11#More informative optional text for categories of Wikiprojects.\n\nTo prevent new unwanted categories it would be useful to include newly created subcategories within Gastropods category in some Alertbot.\n\n--Snek01 (talk)\n\n@AzseicsoK: there is a major category rework being discussed at WT:TREE#Request for comment: categorizing by year of formal description which might interest you/be relevant here. I would hold off on major category reworks until that is closed/formalized. ~ Tom.Reding (talk ⋅dgaf)\n\nOK, I guess I should just leave it alone for a while. Clearly, there's reason NOT to do what I proposed, and these other projects talked about are not things I've generally gotten my teeth into, and I'm not 100% clear what they are, anyway. I think there's still plenty of tidying of categories for me to do among moths. Uporządnicki (talk)\n\nThe reason I am contacting you is because there are one or more portals that fall under this subject, and the Portals WikiProject is currently undertaking a major drive to automate portals that may affect them.\n\nPortals are being redesigned.\n\nThe new design features are being applied to existing portals.\n\nAt present, we are gearing up for a maintenance pass of portals in which the introduction section will be upgraded to no longer need a subpage. In place of static copied and pasted excerpts will be self-updating excerpts displayed through selective transclusion, using the template {{Transclude lead excerpt}}.\n\nThe discussion about this can be found here.\n\nMaintainers of specific portals are encouraged to sign up as project members here, noting the portals they maintain, so that those portals are skipped by the maintenance pass. Currently, we are interested in upgrading neglected and abandoned portals. There will be opportunity for maintained portals to opt-in later, or the portal maintainers can handle upgrading (the portals they maintain) personally at any time.\n\nBackground\n\nOn April 8th, 2018, an RfC (\"Request for comment\") proposal was made to eliminate all portals and the portal namespace. On April 17th, the Portals WikiProject was rebooted to handle the revitalization of the portal system. On May 12th, the RfC was closed with the result to keep portals, by a margin of about 2 to 1 in favor of keeping portals.\n\nThere's an article in the current edition of the Signpost interviewing project members about the RfC and the Portals WikiProject.\n\nSince the reboot, the Portals WikiProject has been busy building tools and components to upgrade portals.\n\nSo far, 84 editors have joined.\n\nIf you would like to keep abreast of what is happening with portals, see the newsletter archive.\n\nIf you have any questions about what is happening with portals or the Portals WikiProject, please post them on the WikiProject's talk page.\n\nThank you. — The Transhumanist\n\nThere is an RfC regarding recommending usage of automatic taxoboxes at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Tree of Life#Request for comments: Should the automatic taxobox system be the current recommended practice?.

Plantdrew (talk)\n\nThank you for the information. I shared my opinion there. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nSomeone I know, who is a gastropod person, said it was OK for me to post this, which is part of a message from him to me:\n\n\"A thought that has been bugging me for a while about public biodiversity information on the internet (specifically type specimen photos) is that they are not generally pulled into Wikipedia, leaving species pages barren when they could be full of information and photos that are available publicly, often under a restriction free CC license.\"\n\n\"I think you’re active in the wikipedia taxonomy world, is there already a project or plan in place to get images from things like iDigBio or museum type imaging projects into taxon pages, or to better incorporate taxon pages with curated databases like WoRMS and MolluscaBase?\"\n\nMaybe someone would like to reply to his question? Thanks. Invertzoo (talk)\n\nI'm afraid the uploading has to be done manually to commons.wikimedia.org, using the upload wizard: [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:UploadWizard]. Don't forget to add down below in the upload wizard a request that the license be checked with the template {{LicenseReview}} I can recommend the website of the Muséum nationale d'histoire naturelle in Paris on the website [https://science.mnhn.fr/institution/mnhn/item/search/form?listCount=147&listIndex=32]. Lately, they have released thousands of photos in excellent condition. Not all photos however carry a free license. One has to look for CC-by on the photo, which is a {{cc-by-4.0}} free license. One has to check in WoRMS if the given name is the latest accepted name, which is not always the case. There are probably also other websites providing photos with an acceptable free license. Once uploaded in the Commons, one has to put the photo in a category. Then one can enter the photo in an existing article in wikipedia (or one can make this article oneself). When in doubt during every step of this process, just look how someone else has done it and copy the method. This seems a lot of work but it is rewarding. Hope this helps and welcome to this project. JoJan (talk)\n\nIf they know where a large number of images can be obtained for upload in one go they could inquire at commons:Commons:Batch uploading. I uploaded a load of moth images last year, and may be able to advise if required. William Avery (talk)\n\nThanks for the advice. However, a batch upload, if it were possible, would require lots of verification afterwards (could take months or even years). Is the name the accepted name for the species ? Has the photo been categorized in the correct category ? Review of the licence by an administrator in the Commons (this would give an overload). And then keeping track of the many changes in the taxonomy. If all this can be done by a bot, fine. But I think this would require some AI in the bot. With this reasoning, a manual upload, photo by photo, checking the data every time, is in my opinion the only solution. I have been doing this for some time and it is a work that will require much, much time. JoJan (talk)\n\nThere is virtually the plan to upload all best relevant images because it is within the scope of Wikipedia. But we lack enough human resources to have uploaded everything possible already and so on. There are already much of images not yet used at Wikimedia Commons and there are immense number of images with suitable license on Interent on various webpages. As far as I know, nobody uploaded images from iDigBio. Articles are already linked to WoRMS through WikiData. (Not to MolluscaBase, because it would be duplicate to WoRMS). - The user can ask detailed questions here (or at my talk page or via email). I will be happy to share my experience and opinion. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nHi, gastropod fans: over at Wikipedia:Typo Team/moss the \"potential mis-spelling\" tools have unearthed the term \"turrited\" as a typo for \"turreted\". Most or maybe all of the tagged articles refer to a description of gastropod shells. I find both spellings online; I think the \"i\" occurs mostly in older papers. A few online zoological lexicons don't have the term at all. Some members of the project have already started \"correcting\" it. Which spelling do you prefer? (ETA:) I can't even find a definition of the term, only multiple uses of both spellings. David Brooks (talk)\n\nAccording to the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, the term \"turrited\" is now rare or obsolete. The word \"turreted\" means (according to the same dictionary): having a long pointed spire resembling a turret (said of a mollusc shell). \"Turrited\" therefore should be replaced by \"turreted\" in all articles. JoJan (talk)\n\nThanks. Will report back to the moss project. David Brooks (talk)\n\nHello, do we need subterclass rank? This is not mentioned even on the Class (biology)#An example from zoology. I have taken a look at Euthyneura taxon on WoRMS http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=1057247 and it has few subtaxa ranked as subterclass. These taxa were ranked as cohort in the taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet et al., 2017). The rank subterclass is under the infraclass rank on WoRMS. So my question is like this: is the rank subterclass the same as parvclass? I think, that it is the same, especially when the WoRMS does not use the rank parvclass at all. If they are 100% the same, then we can use parvclass instead of subterclass in taxoboxes. If they are not the same, then we would need add a new rank subterclass into the taxobox template. It is so tricky and so important question, that it would be the best to ask somebody on WoRMS directly. Any volunteer? --Snek01 (talk)\n\nParvclass and subterclass are clearly not the same, although they might occupy similar positions in the taxonomic hierarchy (depending on what other minor ranks are recognized). If I recall correctly, when WoRMS was still based on Bouchet 20005, they slotted Bouchet's informally ranked groups into formal ranks that preserved Bouchet's hierarchical relationships, but not the lack of ranks (and WoRMS maybe omitted a few of Bouchet's 2005 \"ranks\"?). I thought WikiProject Gastropods had previously preferred to directly follow Bouchet 2005, rather than WoRMS ranked representation of the 2005 classification. So I'm not sure why it's even under consideration to use WoRMS \"subterclass\" instead of Bouchet 2017's \"cohorts\", let alone a \"parvclass\" rank that isn't suggested by either Bouchet or WoRMS.\n\nAt any rate, {{Taxobox}} doesn't currently support parvclass, cohort, or subterclass. {{Automatic taxobox}} does support cohort, which means if support for any of these ranks is added to manual taxoboxes, cohort would probably the easiest to incorporate. Plantdrew (talk)\n\nThanks. Wikipedia always use the most up to date taxonomy (taxonomy on WoRMS is updated taxonomy by Bouchet et al. 2017). Bouchet et al. 2017 used cohorts and subcohorts (and one grade and two clades), but luckily we do not need cohorts and subcohorts now in taxoboxes (as far as I know, special cases can always appear, but I found none yet). So now we only need Taxobox to support subterclass. --Snek01 (talk)\n\nIf you want to insert extra levels in {{taxobox}} you can use |=unranked_infraclassis= and |=unranked_magnordo= to insert taxa above and below infraclass. They will of course show as \"(unranked)\", but this will allow the extra levels to be shown. A useful feature would be to name the unranked levels, as \"clade\" or \"parvclass\" or \"subterclass\" with an |=unranked_infraclassis_alias= parameter. Jts1882 | talk\n\nIncidentally, google finds nothing using both parvclass and subterclass. However a couple of pages get picked up for parvphylum and subterphylum and for parvorder and subterorder which suggests they are alternative names. Jts1882 | talk\n\nI have no view on whether these ranks should be used here or not. I'd just like to comment on what is involved in a rank being \"supported\" in the automated taxobox system.\n\nIn a limited sense, any rank is \"supported\", since the whole point of the automation is that the hierarchy is determined through |parent= in taxonomy templates, not by the order of the parameters in the taxobox template.\n\nHowever, full support involves two pieces of information being available:\n\nthe correspondence between the English and Latin names of the ranks\n\nan arbitrary numerical value for the rank if the rank is used consistently, so that the system can check for out-of-order ranks; some ranks, like \"series\", are used quite differently in different groups so can't be checked.\n\nThe ranks that are fully supported at any one time are shown at Wikipedia:Automated taxobox system/taxonomy templates#rank. The table can be sorted to show the ordering. The problem with the novel interpolated ranks that some sources use, at least in my experience of them, is that there's no consistency between sources as to their ordering. We already have to allow for two different uses of \"grandordo\" and \"mirordo\". Peter coxhead (talk)\n\nBy the way, the automated taxobox system has supported subterclassis since 11 Sept 2018, although it can't check for correct ordering as I don't know exactly where it fits. As an illustration, I have set up Aiteng ater to use {{Speciesbox}}. Click on the red pencil icon as usual to view the complete hierarchy. See Template talk:Taxobox#Subterclass adding request for some further comments. Peter coxhead (talk)\n\nThe article Philbertia pygmaea has been proposed for deletion because of the following concern:\n\nNomen dubium of an invalid genus (see WoRMS for the species and genus, respectively. No suitable redirect target.\n\nWhile all constructive contributions to Wikipedia are appreciated, pages may be deleted for any of several reasons.\n\nYou may prevent the proposed deletion by removing the {{proposed deletion/dated}} notice, but please explain why in your edit summary or on the article's talk page.\n\nPlease consider improving the page to address the issues raised. Removing {{proposed deletion/dated}} will stop the proposed deletion process, but other deletion processes exist. In particular, the speedy deletion process can result in deletion without discussion, and articles for deletion allows discussion to reach consensus for deletion. ♠PMC♠ (talk)\n\nThis article should be deleted. This is worse than a nomen dubium: no authorship, no reliable reference. Even a nomen dubium eventually gets resolved into an accepted name. In this case the genus has also become a synonym of Raphitoma Bellardi, 1847. If I had encountered this article before, I would have speedily deleted it. The Rhaphitomidae is one of the 13 families originating in Turridae s.l.(Raphitomidae is on my list for next year after I have finished Pseudomelatomidae). Many of these species are ill defined, but Philbertia pygmaea is certainly a separate case with no right of existence in Wikipedia. JoJan (talk)\n\nDone — Ganeshk (talk)\n\nTurbinelloidea needs an article. — Ganeshk (talk)\n\nI've added a few items. JoJan (talk)\n\nI am helping with WP:ORPHAN and as Ganeshbot goes to work, the workload increases! As per the feedback above, will appreciate that the new entries be pre-empted written into their genus pages so other editors running AWB will not be tagging them as orphans and we have to manual edit and remove tags! Also, I have updated Laetifautor page but I am not sure have I written into the article correctly for Laetifautor spinulosus. Please help to edit and advise. As it is, since both species are the same with different names, should we just have a single article or two articles? Thanks --Xaiver0510 (talk)\n\nAll the references on the page Laetifautor are to WoRMS. If I were creating the page I would list the five species that WoRMS includes:\n\nLaetifautor deceptus (E. A. Smith, 1899)\n\nLaetifautor elegans Habe, 1960\n\nLaetifautor fundatus B. A. Marshall, 1995\n\nLaetifautor rubropunctatus (A. Adams, 1853)\n\nLaetifautor spinulosus (Tate, 1893)\n\n- and I would deal with \"Species brought into synonymy\" differently so as to agree with WoRMS (ie that Laetifautor spinulosus is valid rather than Laetifautor spinulosum.) Cwmhiraeth (talk)\n\nHello Gastropod members, I had mentioned sometime ago that I lost the code for Ganeshbot and have not been able to run the bot beyond the 18k articles. I have now found some time to rewrite the code and was able to get a few articles created. Please review the following Conidae genus list for correctness. The bot will need few more tweaks before it is good. I do not have access to the WoRMS database any more, so had to rely on their web services for the data. For this reason, I was not able pull the notes and the links data as I did in the previous version.\n\nContraconus\n\nEoconus\n\nHerndliconus\n\nHemiconus\n\nMalagasyconus\n\nPapilliconus\n\nTequestaconus\n\nSeason's greetings! — Ganeshk (talk)\n\nPlease check these species articles too.\n\nConasprella torensis\n\nConasprella tirardi\n\nConasprella ramalhoi\n\nConasprella paumotu\n\nConasprella nereis\n\nConasprella minutissima\n\nConasprella masinoi\n\nConasprella marcusi\n\nConasprella kantangana\n\nConasprella imitator\n\nConasprella hivana\n\nConasprella culebrana\n\nConasprella coletteae\n\nConasprella burckhardti\n\nConasprella boriqua\n\nConasprella berwerthi\n\nConasprella aturensis\n\nConasprella aquitanica\n\nThanks, Ganeshk (talk)\n\nFeedback 1\n\nHi! A few comments / preferences:\n\nInstead of adding orphan tags, preemptively add the species/genera links to a higher taxon page.\n\nMark as extinct in the taxobox when appropriate.\n\nThe lead phrasing in several of the articles currently suggests that Conidae is the only family known as \"sea snails\". (e.g. \"Papilliconus is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Conidae.\") It needs a comma after \"mollusks\" or to be otherwise rephrased.\n\nYou can probably omit the \"Habitats\" section if all it says is that it is a marine species.\n\nIf it only occurs in a single location, don't format it like a list, e.g. \"This species occurs in France.\" is preferable to \"This species occurs in the following locations: France.\"\n\nIf there is only a single species in the genus, it should be included in the lead and the taxobox formatted for monotypic genera (i.e. using a Speciesbox).\n\nFormat authors in taxon lists with <small> tags.\n\nUse citation templates, e.g. {{cite web}} or Template:Cite WoRMS.\n\nItalicize when appropriate in references (species, genera).\n\nDon't italicize parentheses for subgenera.\n\nRemove extra spacing, e.g. between lead and references here.\n\nI don't think the \"External links\" heading is necessary if the only thing under it is the taxonbar.\n\nDon't add an extra external link for WoRMS if it's already in the taxonbar, especially if it's already used as a reference.\n\nTaxonbar should be formatted, for example, {{Taxonbar|from=Q27982477}} where Q27982477 is the corresponding item for that taxon on Wikidata. No need for the additional \"worms=|itis=|ncbi=|eol=|iucn=|bold=|fishbase=\" since all of that is added automatically from Wikidata when available.\n\nCan you also add it to the appropriate location category too?\n\nTwo blank lines go before stub templates.\n\nThanks, —Hyperik ⌜talk⌟\n\nThanks @Hyperik:. Will look into these suggestions before my next run. — Ganeshk (talk)\n\n@Hyperik: I have created a few more pages,\n\nEoconus veteratoris\n\nEoconus sulciferus\n\nEoconus sauridens\n\nEoconus diversiformis\n\nEoconus derelictus\n\nEoconus bareti\n\nMy replies:\n\nI have disabled AWB from adding orphan tags.\n\nAdded extinct option, see Eoconus bareti.\n\nUpdate the lead sentence to include the comma.\n\nHabitat section will only show if there is more than one habitat available.\n\nI have updated distribution text, will find an examples shortly.\n\nIf there is only one species, the bot adds a category for monotypic genera. Replacing the taxobox with speciesbox is complicated.\n\nGenera taxon lists will now include small tags for authority.\n\nI pull the citation directly from WoRMS, I would prefer to retain as it is. It is cumbersome to break it up into different parameters required for CiteWeb.\n\nDone, I have italicized the genera/species name in the citation.\n\nI don't parse subgenera right now. How should this be handled?\n\nI have tried to remove spaces as much as I could. I cannot avoid adding two empty spaces between the lead and the rest of the page.\n\nI have removed external links section.\n\nI have removed the extra WoRMS link\n\nFor the bot to add a Wikidata item #, it needs to search for it first. If it does not exist, it will need to be added. The bot uses AWB to create articles, so cannot handle this requirement. It does add all those params if available, and someone has to manually add to Wikidata.\n\nNot handling location category at the moment, will look into it.\n\nBot is adding two empty lines before the stub template.\n\nThanks, — Ganeshk (talk)\n\nFeedback 2\n\nGreat. A few more comments:\n\nMaybe better to ignore monotypic genera for now, if they can't be formatted correctly en masse? Related, does it create redirects for species to their monotypic genera?\n\nFor subgenera, they should be formatted ''Genus'' (''Subgenus''). I noticed it in a few lists of synonyms in the taxoboxes.\n\nLikely better to just leave the taxonbar blank. Just {{Taxonbar}} should be fine.\n\nDefinitely a miniscule personal preference, but it's helpful of the taxoboxes are formatted with the parameters in a certain order, roughly the order in which they are displayed, e.g.\n\n|image=\n\n|image_caption=\n\n|display_parents=\n\n|taxon=\n\n|extinct=\n\n|authority=\n\n|synonyms_ref=\n\n|synonyms=\n\nIf extinct, can you add that to the lead? \"Eoconus sauridens is an extinct species of sea snail...\"\n\nOthers may have opinions on how many parents to display in the taxoboxes... I would personally default to leaving that blank. It's probably better to set certain taxa to always_display in the taxonomy templates instead of in the individual taxoboxes.\n\n—Hyperik ⌜talk⌟\n\n@Hyperik: I have implemented some of the above and created 94 new Conidae stubs listed here.\n\nMy replies:\n\nRight, it may have to be a separate project to address monotypic genera.\n\nI have removed all parameters from the Taxonbar now. I still need to figure out how to add the IDs to Wikidata. I am getting some help from Tom Reding for that.\n\nI have formatted the parameters in the order you suggested.\n\nThe extinct word has been added to the lead now. The extinct symbol will also be included in the species lists on genera pages.\n\nThe display_parents is the compromise that I"
