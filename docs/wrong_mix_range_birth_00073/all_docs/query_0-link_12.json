        "text": "“\n\nYou! You're a dead man! Green light! Green light! Martin Madrazo give you green light!\n\n”\n\n— Natalia Zverovna\n\nNatalia Zverovna (Russian: Наталья Зверовна) is a minor character appearing in Grand Theft Auto V.\n\nShe is voiced by Vanessa Lemonides.\n\nHistory[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nNatalia was born in Russia and moved to Los Santos at an unknown time.\n\nNot much is known about Natalia, besides her being Martin Madrazo's lover and living in his house in Vinewood Hills.\n\nShe is the mistress of Martin Madrazo.\n\nEvents of Grand Theft Auto Online in 2013[]\n\nIn GTA Online, after the completion of the mission \"Out of Court Settlement\", Martin Madrazo refuses to admit that the house is for Natalia, telling the player the house is for a \"business associate\" that he likes. He also asks the player to keep that between them, obviously hiding his affair from his wife.\n\nEvents of Grand Theft Auto V[]\n\nWhen Michael De Santa is chasing Kyle Chavis after he was sleeping with Michael's wife, Chavis hides in her mansion. Michael, thinking the building is Kyle's property, pulls down the residence's pillars, destroying it. Natalia takes the phone from Chavis, who is telling Michael that it was not his home that was destroyed, and she tells Michael that Madrazo gave the \"green light\" (a hit).\n\nWhen Martín confronts Michael and Franklin, demanding that he funds the rebuild of the residence, Natalia spits on a fallen Michael after Madrazo hits him with a baseball bat. It is mentioned that she would be living in a hotel until the house is fully repaired again.\n\nMission Appearances[]\n\nGrand Theft Auto V[]\n\nMarriage Counseling\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nNatalia's hairstyle, shirt, pants and heels can all be purchased by the GTA Online Protagonist.\n\nNatalia's last name is not an actual Russian last name and is structured like a feminine patronymic instead. It can be translated as \"daughter of a beast\". The closest match to an actual feminine form of a surname would be Zvereva.\n\nNavigation[]"
