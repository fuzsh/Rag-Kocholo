Luka Doncic’s first trip to the title round. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, getting another chance at a ring. Kristaps Porzingis facing his former team, too.\n\nPick a storyline. There are many in these NBA Finals.\n\nThe matchup is now set: It’ll be Boston against Dallas for the Larry O’Brien Trophy, a series that starts on the Celtics’ home floor on June 6 — meaning everyone will be sitting around and waiting for about a week, a byproduct of the Celtics and Mavericks making short work of their respective conference finals.\n\nDallas eliminated Minnesota on Thursday night, winning 124-103 to finish off a 4-1 victory in the Western Conference finals. Boston’s spot was clinched Monday night, after the Celtics beat Indiana 108-105 to cap a 4-0 series in the East.\n\n“We’re going to the NBA Finals,” Doncic said during the on-court celebration in Minneapolis on Thursday night. “Just can’t believe it, man.”\n\nIt’s Boston’s second time in the finals in the last three seasons, after falling to Golden State in six games in 2022. Dallas is in the title round for the first time since winning the championship against Miami in 2011.\n\nMuch will be made, and rightly so, of Irving and the Celtics meeting with a title on the line. Boston made a blockbuster move in 2017 by trading for Irving, with the hopes of seeing him grace its parquet floor in the NBA Finals.\n\nHey, it’ll happen now — just not as the sides envisioned seven years ago.\n\nIrving was an All-Star in both of his Boston seasons, then left as a free agent to join the Brooklyn Nets in 2019 a few months after saying — vowing, really — that he would be staying with the Celtics. There have been some interesting moments in his returns to Boston; he’s been routinely booed and had a water bottle thrown at him, while he’s been fined for making an obscene gesture and raised ire by stomping on the Celtics’ leprechaun logo at midcourt following a Brooklyn playoff win there.\n\n“Boston’s in the way and in between our goal,” Irving said when the West finals ended Thursday night.\n\nIrving’s message to the Mavericks: Enjoy this moment.\n\n“Nothing’s guaranteed in this league, especially making it to the finals every year,” said Irving, who won a title playing alongside LeBron James with Cleveland in 2016. “We couldn’t have done it without a collective responsibility, us working together every single day, practicing hard, doing the little things. We should reward ourselves by playing hard.”\n\nPorzingis spent nearly three years in Dallas after being traded there by the New York Knicks in 2019. He’s in his first season in Boston and has been a huge part of the Celtics’ success — but got hurt in Round 1 against Miami and hasn’t played since, though it seems reasonable to think he may be ready for the NBA Finals.\n\n“He’s progressing well and he’s working really hard to get back,” Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said.\n\nThe Celtics won the two head-to-head meetings against the Mavericks in the regular season, 119-110 at Dallas on Jan. 22 and then 138-110 in Boston on March 1.\n\nThe Mavericks didn’t have an answer for Tatum; he had 39 points in the January game, 32 in the March matchup. The Celtics didn’t have an answer for Doncic; he had triple-doubles in both games — 33 points, 18 rebounds and 13 assists in January, then 37 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in March.\n\nThose games won’t mean much now.\n\n“This group believes,” said Mavericks coach Jason Kidd, who played for the Dallas team that won a title in 2011. “They believe in each other. … This is a special group.”\n\nThe Celtics are seeking their 18th title overall, which would break a tie with the Los Angeles Lakers for the most in NBA history, and their first championship since 2008.\n\nAgainst the Warriors two years ago, the championship experience of Golden State prevailed. Lessons were learned then, Boston has insisted since, and the Celtics will get a chance to finish the season differently this time.\n\n“It’s a new challenge. It’s a different situation,” Celtics center Al Horford said. “I’m just excited to be in this position and to have this opportunity.”\n\nThe Celtics will have spent more than a week without a game before the finals start. Mazzulla said all that downtime won’t be spent idly.\n\n“Nothing’s really valuable if you let it go to waste,” Mazzulla said. “Between now and June 6th, we have to take every experience that we’ve been through, and we’ve got to make sure we take advantage of it and that we utilize it to put ourselves in the best position to win.”\n\nCAVS ADD COACHING CANDIDATES, GET PERMISSION TO SPEAK WITH ASSISTANTS BRYANT, QUINN, AP SOURCE SAYS\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) — Cleveland added two more candidates to its coaching search Friday, receiving permission to interview New York Knicks assistant Johnnie Bryant and Miami Heat assistant Chris Quinn, a person familiar with the process told The Associated Press.\n\nEarlier this week, the Cavs began looking for J.B. Bickerstaff’s successor by getting clearance to speak with Golden State’s Kenny Atkinson and New Orleans’ James Borrego.\n\nBickerstaff was fired one week after Cleveland was knocked out in the second round of the NBA playoffs by Boston. The Cavs believe they have their pieces to compete for a championship and want a new voice.\n\nThe Cavs will further broaden their list of prospective candidates, said the person who spoke on condition of anonymity because the team is not commenting during its first search for a coach in five years.\n\nCleveland and the Los Angeles Lakers are the only teams with coaching vacancies at the moment.\n\nBryant’s name has been linked for some time to the Cavs because of his background with Donovan Mitchell. The All-Star guard worked with Bryant in Utah and has credited him with helping him develop as a player.\n\nMitchell can sign a long-term extension with Cleveland this summer, and Bryant’s hiring could seal the deal.\n\nQuinn, who is highly regarded in Miami, has been a candidate for several jobs in recent years. The Heat agreed to terms with assistant coach Caron Butler on a four-year deal earlier this week, and have been talking with Quinn and fellow assistant Malik Allen on new contracts as well.\n\nBickerstaff’s dismissal was somewhat shocking since he had guided the Cavs through the early stages of a rebuild and had made improvement each season.\n\nHe was forced to juggle his lineup almost this entire season due to injuries. The Cavs played the series against the Celtics without center Jarrett Allen because of a broken rib, while Mitchell sat out Cleveland’s final two games with a strained calf.\n\nBickerstaff took over for John Beilein midway through the 2019 season and went 170-159 in the regular season. He got the Cavs back to the playoffs for the first time since 2018 last season, but a first-round exit against the Knicks didn’t help his resume.\n\nPISTONS PART WAYS WITH TROY WEAVER, HIRE TRAJAN LANGDON AS PRESIDENT OF BASKETBALL OPERATIONS\n\nDETROIT (AP) — The Detroit Pistons have parted ways with general manager Troy Weaver and hired Trajan Langdon on Friday as president of basketball operations.\n\nDetroit has had the NBA’s worst record the past two seasons and won just 23% of its games over four years with Weaver in charge of basketball operations.\n\nLangdon was hired by the New Orleans Pelicans as general manager in 2019 and they improved under him in each of the past five years, winning 49 games last season to trail the win total of only one team in franchise history.\n\nThe former Duke standout, who played in Cleveland for three seasons, previously was the Brooklyn Nets’ assistant general manager.

A pair of 3-pointers from Jones and Thornton coupled with four points from Stewart locked up another victory for New York.\n\nWashington’s 0-8 start matches the worst start in franchise history, set by the 2007 rendition of the team. The team has not won a game since their regular-season finale against the Liberty last season.\n\nAriel Atkins was one of the few bright spots of the Mystics’ loss. Her team-leading 15 points marked her fifth double-digit performance of the season, while Shakira Austin’s 12-point performance marked the only other double-digit output by a Washington starter.\n\nMyisha Hines-Allen and Jade Melbourne both contributed 11 points off the bench, but their efforts were not enough to push the Mystics over the top.\n\nIonescu scored 15 of her points in the first quarter alone, helping New York build its initial cushion.

Duke’s season ends at 52-9 after their first-ever appearance in the WCWS.\n\nAlabama had just three hits going into the sixth, before Giles reached out and poked left-hander Cassidy Curd’s 1-0 offering out to right-center field for her team-leading seventh home run of the season.\n\nThe Crimson Tide took the lead in the first on an unearned run after Kenleigh Cahalan reached second on an error and came around on Giles’ double.\n\nGiles missed more than a month of the season with a broken arm before returning in early May.\n\nDuke’s Ana Gold tied it with a solo homer to left-center off Jocelyn Briski in the second.\n\nAfter Gold’s one-out single in the fourth, Alabama brought in Kayla Beaver, who went the distance in the Crimson Tide’s 4-1 opening-round loss to UCLA.\n\nBeaver (19-10) was excellent, retiring all 11 batters she faced, including striking out pinch-hitter Sarah Goddard to end the game and keep the Crimson Tide alive.\n\nBeaver threw 45 pitches, 39 for strikes.\n\nCOLLEGE ATHLETICS\n\nBIG 12 WILL DISTRIBUTE RECORD $470 MILLION, THOUGH 10 FULL-SHARE MEMBERS GETTING LITTLE LESS\n\nIRVING, Texas (AP) — Big 12 schools will share in a record $470 million of revenue distribution, the conference announced Friday when wrapping up its first spring meetings as a 14-team league and before growing by two more teams.\n\nWhile the 10 full-share members will get smaller amounts than they got last year because of the addition of the four schools that joined the league for the 2023-24 academic year, Commissioner Brett Yormark said the conference is more relevant than it has ever been.\n\n“We went with stability as a conference and we felt it was investing in all the right ways and for all the right reasons,” Yormark said. “Clearly that was the right one for this conference as we think about where we’re going.”\n\nFirst-year members BYU, Cincinnati, Houston and UCF each will get partial shares of about $18 million each. That leaves about $398 million to be split among the league’s other 10 schools, including Oklahoma and Texas before they move this summer to the Southeastern Conference.\n\nAbout $440 million was distributed last year.\n\nThe Big 12 will grow to 16 teams with the additions of Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah from the Pac-12, officially on Aug. 1. The four incoming schools took part in this week’s meetings, while Oklahoma and Texas did not.\n\nYormark said the increases came as a result of bigger College Football Playoff and bowl revenues, growth in ticket revenue across all of the conference championships and sponsorship after streamlining that to be handled directly by the conference instead of using outside parties.\n\nAccording to tax filings released last week, the five power conferences generated $3.55 billion in the 2022-23 fiscal year, with the Big Ten reporting revenue of $879.9 million compared with $852.6 million for the SEC. The ACC saw the most significant increase, going from $617 million in 2021-22 to $707 million.\n\nThe Pac-12, which will see 10 of its 12 members disperse to other conferences in 2024-25, generated $603.9 million. The Big 12 was fifth at $510.7 million, which was before distributions when it was still only a 10-member league.\n\nLike the other leagues, the Big 12 is preparing for big changes after news of a landmark $2.8 billion settlement that will transform how athletes are compensated. The power conferences last week agreed to settle a host of antitrust claims that could start steering millions of dollars directly to athletes as soon as the 2025 fall semester.\n\n“I think we ended up in a fair and reasonable place,” Yormark said. “Obviously, it’s going to be a changing landscape. But I also do see opportunities in that changing landscape, and the work really starts now. A lot of work to be done. I look at this as a bit of a reset for our industry. And we’re prepared for that. The ADs, myself, the board, we’ve been discussing that reset for quite some time. So it’s not coming as a surprise.”\n\nWhen he became the Big 12 commissioner two summers ago, Yormark was an executive with Jay-Z’s Roc Nation and a former CEO of the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets. He spent almost 15 years with the Nets, overseeing the club’s move from New Jersey and construction of the Barclays Center, and previously was with NASCAR, where he oversaw a $750 million agreement with Nextel Communications for naming rights to the circuit’s top racing series.\n\n“Since I took this job, you know, I said from day one, I was open for business. And I guess you could say we’re open for business now more so than ever before,” Yormark said. “When I think about my background, I certainly do believe that collegiate athletics is shifting, more closely to where I came from than where we are today.”\n\nUnlike when he first got to the Big 12, “open for business” this time isn’t a reference to any further expansion plans.\n\nUVA TO PAY $9 MILLION RELATED TO SHOOTING THAT KILLED 3 FOOTBALL PLAYERS, WOUNDED 2 STUDENTS\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — The University of Virginia will pay $9 million in a settlement related to a 2022 campus shooting that killed three football players and wounded two students, a lawyer representing some of the victims and their families said Friday.\n\nBut some of the families are calling for more: The immediate release of an independent probe into the shooting that was completed last year. Its focus included efforts by the university to assess the potential threat of the student who was eventually charged with murder as well as recommendations from what was learned.\n\nKimberly Wald, an attorney who represents some of the families, said the university should have removed the alleged shooter from campus before the attack because he displayed multiple red flags through erratic and unstable behavior.\n\n“This settlement today is only one small step for these families — there is much to be done,” said Wald, an attorney with the Miami-based Haggard Law Firm. “If there is one lesson, even one lesson that we can learn from that report, we need to know it now … We need to protect lives now.”\n\nUniversity officials postponed the report’s release last year over concerns that it could affect the alleged shooter’s upcoming trial.\n\n“We are committed to providing it as soon as we can be sure that doing so will not interfere in any way with the criminal proceeding,” UVA President Jim Ryan said last fall.\n\nThe school in Charlottesville will pay $2 million each to the families of the three students who died, the maximum allowable under Virginia law, said Wald, who represents the estate of D’Sean Perry. The other two students who died were Devin Chandler and Lavel Davis Jr.\n\nThe university will pay $3 million total to the two students who were wounded Mike Hollins, a fourth member of the football team, and Marlee Morgan, who Wald also represents.\n\nThe settlement was negotiated outside of court and did not follow the filing of a lawsuit, Wald said. However, every settlement in Virginia must be approved by a judge. The settlement with UVA was accepted by a judge in Albemarle County Circuit Court on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe agreements also were approved by Virginia Gov. Glenn Younkin and state Attorney General Jason Miyares, the university said in a statement.\n\nUVA Rector Robert Hardie and President Ryan said in the statement Friday that the three students’ lives “were tragically cut short” and the young men “have been ever present in our minds.”\n\n“We will forever remember the impact that Devin, Lavel, and D’Sean had on our community, and we are grateful for the moments they spent in our presence uplifting UVA through their time in the classroom and on the football field,” the statement said.\n\nPolice said Christopher Darnell Jones Jr., a UVA student and former member of the school’s football team, carried out the shooting. It occurred when he and others had returned by charter bus to campus from a field trip to see a play in Washington, authorities said.\n\nThe violence that erupted near a parking garage set off panic and a 12-hour lockdown of the campus until the suspect was captured. His trial on murder charges and other counts is scheduled for January.\n\nWithin days of the shooting, university leaders asked for an outside review to investigate UVA’s safety policies and procedures, its response to the violence and its prior efforts to assess the potential threat of the student who was eventually charged. School officials acknowledged he previously had been on the radar of the university’s threat-assessment team.\n\nThe report was completed in October, and UVA said it would release it in November. But UVA’s stance changed over concerns about affecting Jones’ trial.\n\nHappy Perry, who lost her son D’Sean Perry, said Friday that the report should be released now if it can help prevent similar shootings.\n\n“As a mom, I want to know what happened. It is my right to know what happened,” she said during a Zoom call with reporters. “At this point, it is an issue of public safety and national security that we get that report.”\n\nBrenda Hollins, whose son Mike Hollins was shot and wounded, said she felt mixed emotions Friday in the wake of the settlement. And she talked about how devastated and changed all of the families are.\n\n“You put on your smile, and throughout the day you may be able to move forward,” Hollins said during the Zoom call. “But then it just creeps up on you. And if you do not address it at that moment, then it consumes you.”\n\nNFL NEWS\n\nBILLS SIGNING OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST WRESTLER STEVESON\n\nThe Buffalo Bills are signing wrestler Gable Steveson to a standard three-year rookie deal, his agent told ESPN’s Adam Schefter.\n\nSteveson hasn’t played football in the past and hadn’t worn cleats until a workout with the Bills, per Schefter. He’s expected to play defensive line for Buffalo.\n\n“I have been fortunate to compete at the highest level of competition in my sport but am looking forward to the challenge of seeing how my wrestling skills may translate to football,” Steveson said, according to Schefter.\n\nThe 24-year-old was a dominant college wrestler, winning back-to-back NCAA Division I titles at 285 pounds in 2021 and 2022. He also earned a bronze finish in 2019.\n\nThe Minnesota product carried that success to the international stage, capturing a gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics by defeating Georgian opponent Geno Petriashvili.\n\nBuffalo’s defensive line features Ed Oliver, DaQuan Jones, and rookie DeWayne Carter in its interior, among others. Greg Rousseau, A.J. Epenesa, and Von Miller are expected to be the team’s primary edge rushers.\n\nSteveson was recently released from the WWE after spending three years in its developmental program.\n\nGOLF NEWS\n\nRYAN FOX, ROBERT MACINTYRE TIED ATOP CANADIAN OPEN LEADERBOARD\n\nRyan Fox of New Zealand and Robert MacIntyre of Scotland will enter the weekend tied for the lead at the RBC Canadian Open after strong rounds Friday at Hamilton Golf & Country Club in Ontario.\n\nMacIntyre shot a 4-under 66 early in the day to be the first to reach 10-under 130 for the tournament. Fox got hot in the afternoon and tied MacIntyre at 10 under by shooting a 6-under 64.\n\nThe duo is two shots ahead of Joel Dahmen, whose bogey-free 65 on Friday pushed him into third place at 8 under. Canadian Mackenzie Hughes matched Fox’s 64 for the round of the day and moved into a tie at 7 under with Andrew Novak (67) and first-round leader David Skinns of England (71).\n\nFox started on the back nine and birdied four holes going out. Consecutive birdies at the fourth and fifth got him to 10 under, and after a bogey at the next hole, Fox rolled in a 14-foot birdie, his seventh of the round, on the par-4 ninth to match MacIntyre again.\n\nRory McIlroy, the highest-ranked player in the field and a two-time Canadian Open champion, struggled to a 2-over 72, and the Northern Irishman dropped to 2 under for the tournament.\n\nThe projected cut line was even par as Friday’s action finished up. Defending champion Nick Taylor of Canada (3 over) did not reach the weekend. Others projected to miss the cut included Cameron Young (1 over), Canadians Mike Weir (1 over) and Adam Hadwin (2 over) and World No. 12 Sahith Theegala (5 over).\n\nWICHANEE MEECHAI LEADS U.S. WOMEN’S OPEN AS NELLY KORDA MISSES CUT\n\nWichanee Meechai of Thailand kicked off her round with four straight birdies before signing for a 3-under 67 and taking a two-shot lead into the weekend at the U.S. Women’s Open on Friday at Lancaster (Pa.) Country Club.\n\nMeechai is 4-under 136 at the midway point of the major championship, one of only four players under par. Andrea Lee shot her second consecutive 69 to sit in second place at 2 under. Former U.S. Women’s Open champions Minjee Lee of Australia (69 on Friday) and Yuka Saso of Japan (71) are tied for third place at 1 under.\n\nThey’re all looking up at Meechai, a 31-year-old ranked 158th in the world who has never won in the United States.\n\n“To be honest, before the tee time, I was so nervous,” Meechai said. “I just talked to my manager, like my hands just shaking, my brain just stop working. But trying to commit to the shot. I know that the course is hard; just go with the flow probably. That’s my point, and just have fun.”\n\nMeechai began her round on the back nine and dialed up a tight approach shot 6 feet of the cup at the par-4 10th hole. She one-upped herself at the par-4 11th, landing her second shot inside 5 feet. Then came a 5-foot birdie putt at the par-3 12th and another at the par-5 13th.\n\n“To be honest, I don’t know who she is the first four holes, but I’m glad that she came,” Meechai joked.\n\nShe cooled off and bogeyed three holes before getting back on the birdie train at the par-4 fourth. Her final birdie was a 9-foot putt at the par-3 eighth — her longest birdie putt of the day.\n\nLee also started on the back nine, playing it in 2-over 37 before a hot streak of her own.\n\nThe 25-year-old Californian hit out of a fairway bunker at the par-4 first and watched her ball roll from right to left up the green, finding the pin and dropping for an unlikely eagle.\n\n“Pulled my driver off the tee but had a pretty good lie in the bunker, so I knew if I just hit it solid and got it up anywhere on the green I could two-putt and make a par,” Lee said. “As soon as I hit it, I knew it was a good shot. I saw it kind of land in the front portion of the green and then I saw it trickle from there. I looked away and I was like, it’s on the green, it’s fine.”\n\nIt gave her a shot of momentum and she birdied the next three holes to get to 4 under for the week, but a pair of late bogeys brought her back.\n\nSaso, the 18-hole leader and 2021 U.S. Women’s Open champ, had two birdies to three bogeys on Friday. Minjee Lee, who won in 2022, had two birdies and two bogeys on the back nine (her first nine) and came home strong, with a birdie and eight pars on the front nine.\n\n“There’s definitely higher scores out there. Pars and birdies feel like gold right now,” Lee said.\n\nAmateurs Megan Schofill and Asterisk Talley are part of a large tie for fifth at 1 over. Talley, a 15-year-old high school freshman, is the youngest player in the field yet she’s having a better week than many of the best golfers in the world.\n\n“I feel like my expectations were to at least make the cut,” Talley said. “That’s what I wanted to do. Then if I achieved that, I wanted to get low amateur. But I feel like that’s still achievable even after today’s round.”\n\nThe most notable player to miss the 8-over cut line was World No. 1 Nelly Korda, who followed Thursday’s disastrous 80 with an even-par 70 to miss the weekend by two shots.\n\n“There’s not many low scores out here, and I was pretty far back,” Korda said. “Tried to give it my all. That’s what I do with every round. I had nothing to lose, so that was kind of like the mentality. Just go for it.”\n\nFormer champions Brittany Lang (9 over), Thailand’s Ariya Jutanugarn (10 over), In Gee Chun of South Korea (12 over) and Allisen Corpuz (12 over) also missed the cut. Chun won in 2015 the last time the major was held at Lancaster, while Corpuz was the defending champion.\n\nTENNIS NEWS\n\nIGA SWIATEK, COCO GAUFF CRUISE INTO ROUND OF 16 AT FRENCH OPEN\n\nWorld No. 1 Iga Swiatek celebrated her 23rd birthday in Grand Slam fashion on Friday, defeating Czech Marie Bouzkova 6-4, 6-2 to easily move into the Round of 16 at the French Open in Paris.\n\nSwiatek, of Poland, advanced to the fourth round at Paris for the sixth consecutive year. She has won the past two titles and three overall at Roland Garros.\n\nShe needed just 93 minutes to defeat Bouzkova — who has 10 career wins against top-10 players — in their first-ever match. Swiatek struck 32 winners compared to 16 for Bouzkova and broke her serve four times.\n\nThe victory continued an incredible run at Roland Garros, where Swiatek is 18-0 in the first week of the tournament in her career and 32-2 overall.\n\nAlso posting an efficient win Friday was third-seeded Coco Gauff, who eliminated Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine 6-2, 6-4. While Gauff wasn’t at her sharpest — eight winners compared to 24 unforced errors — she won the match on defense, breaking Yastremska’s serve in five of nine service games.\n\nIt’s become a strength for reigning U.S. Open champ Gauff this season, winning 49 percent of her return games, according to the WTA.\n\n“One thing I learned from Serena (Williams), she would spend probably like an hour sometimes literally just hitting returns,” Gauff said, per the WTA Tour website. “I took inspiration from that because that’s the first part of the point. I think the average rally is like four or five balls. The first two balls are really important.\n\n“For me, returns were something I was working on a lot because my return-made percentage honestly used to be really, really bad like a couple years ago. I’d be curious to look at those stats.”\n\nAwaiting Gauff in the next round with a spot in the quarterfinals at stake is unseeded Elisabetta Cocciaretto of Italy, who defeated No. 17 seed Liudmila Samsonova of Russia 7-6 (4), 6-2.\n\nSwiatek will take on Anastasia Potapova of Russia, a 7-5, 6-7 (6), 6-4 winner against Xinyu Wang of China.\n\nAlso moving to the fourth round were Czech Marketa Vondrousova, the fifth seed, and eighth-seeded Ons Jabeur of Tunisia, both straight-sets winners.\n\nVondrousova defeated France’s Chloe Paquet 6-1, 6-3, while Jabeur topped Canada’s Leylah Fernandez 6-4, 7-6 (5).\n\nOther winners were Olga Danilovic of Serbia and Clara Tauson of Denmark.\n\nSOCCER NEWS\n\nCUCHO HERNANDEZ, CREW PREPARE FOR CHAMPIONS CUP FINAL AT PACHUCA\n\nThe Columbus Crew welcome the return of star forward Cucho Hernandez when they travel to Mexico play CF Pachuca in the final of the CONCACAF Champions Cup on Saturday.\n\nHernandez, the 2023 MLS Cup MVP, missed the past three league matches due to a sore back while the Crew rolled off road victories in each. He has four goals and an assist in nine MLS matches and two goals in five Champions Cup appearances.\n\n“The idea is he’s going to be available. He wants to have a good game and we want that also,” Crew coach Wilfried Nancy said. “We are all happy that he’s back and hopefully he’s going to be able to have a good performance.”\n\nSaturday’s winner qualifies for the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup next summer in the United States. The 32-team field includes renowned clubs such Manchester City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Inter Milan.\n\nThe Crew can use all the help it can get to defeat Pachuca, which has won all five of their previous finals of the Champions Cup (the former Champions League) in 2002, 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2017.\n\nColumbus seeks to become the second MLS team in the modern era to win the Champions Cup (Seattle Sounders, 2022). Since 2011, Real Salt Lake, CF Montreal, Toronto FC and Los Angeles FC lost in the finals when it was aggregate goals over two matches.\n\nD.C. United (1998) and the Los Angeles Galaxy (2000) won previous versions of the tournament.\n\n“I think it’s a good moment for the team,” said Crew forward Diego Rossi, who has three goals in six Champions Cup appearances this season. “Obviously it’s a different competition, but I think the team is good, working hard. For me, it’s the most important thing to go and have a great game there in the final.”\n\nThe match will be played at Estadio Hidalgo, which sits 7,979 feet above sea level. Crew players were given altitude tents for home use and trained with elevation training masks.\n\n“We’re just trying to get as acclimated as we can,” Crew captain Darlington Nagbe said. “Every little bit helps. At the end of the day, though, altitude is altitude. It’s two good teams playing against each other.”\n\nTOP INDIANA SPORTS RELEASES\n\nINDIANA HIGH SCHOOL LACROSSE\n\nLACROSSE CHAMPIONSHIPS SET FOR SATURDAY, JUNE 1, 2024\n\nIndiana, May 31, 2024 — The highly anticipated Lacrosse Championships are set to take place on Saturday, June 1, 2024, and fans can watch all the action live on IndianaSRN.org.

Gorski, however, responded with a solo home run to even the score in the third. The Storm Chasers (36-16) secured the lead on a three-run blast, courtesy of Brian O’Keefe, to put Omaha ahead and cap their scoring.\n\nGorski continued to show his strength as he notched another home run to cap his dominating month for the Indians (24-29).

The Hoosiers knew they belonged. They proved that on Friday (May 31) afternoon, riding seven combined RBIs from senior outfielder Morgan Colopy and junior first baseman Brock Tibbitts to a 10-4 win over second-seeded Southern Miss in Knoxville.\n\nIU bookended a dominant offensive display with a first inning home run from Tibbitts and a ninth-inning blast from Colopy. The Hoosiers compiled 17 hits on the day, chasing the Southern Miss starter after just 3.2 innings of work. IU’s 17 base knocks are the most in an NCAA Tournament game in program history, topping the previous best of 15 which was done twice.\n\nEvery starter in the IU lineup recorded a hit by the fifth inning with Tibbitts, redshirt junior catcher Jake Stadler and sophomore designated hitter Devin Taylor all tallying three-hit contests. The Hoosiers totaled 10 runs, the 23rd game with 10-or-more runs this season. Tibbitts now has 197 hits on his career, three from becoming the 25th member of the 200-hit club at IU.\n\nOn the mound, IU was just as phenomenal, riding veterans Ty Bothwell (W, 7-3) and Drew Buhr (SV, 1) for the complete nine innings. Bothwell, who loves pitching in the postseason, punched out nine across 5.2 innings of work. He’s now got 240 career strikeouts, moving him into fifth in program history. After the game, to make the day sweeter, he proposed on the field to his long-time girlfriend.\n\nThis is the eighth-straight regional that IU has made and won at least one game. The Hoosiers won their opening two games last season in Lexington. Head coach Jeff Mercer’s team will face the winner of No. 1 Tennessee and Northern Kentucky tomorrow at 6:00 PM ET.\n\nScoring Recap\n\nTop First\n\nBrock Tibbitts got the party started, smashing a two-strike fastball into the seating in left field to hand the Hoosiers an early lead.\n\nIndiana 2, Southern Miss 0\n\nTop Second\n\nMorgan Colopy roped a ball down the left field line, scoring Carter Mathison on the double. Josh Pyne came through clutch later in the inning, singling through the left side as Jake Stadler and Colopy came around to add on to the lead.\n\nIndiana 5, Southern Miss 0\n\nTop Fourth\n\nAgain, it was Tibbitts to the rescue. He smashed a ball into the corner in left field to score both Nick Mitchell and Devin Taylor.\n\nIndiana 7, Southern Miss 0\n\nTop Fifth\n\nTaylor took a ball the other way, lining a single over the shortstop’s head to bring home Jasen Oliver.\n\nIndiana 8, Southern Miss 0\n\nBottom Sixth\n\nSouthern Miss dug into the lead in the sixth inning. Nick Monistere hit a two-run home run on a ball that seemed to keep carrying into the wind in right field. Later in the inning, Dalton McIntyre smashed a ball towards Oliver. The freshman second baseman fumbled the ball, allowing an unearned run to score.\n\nIndiana 8, Southern Miss 3\n\nTop Ninth\n\nColopy got those runs back in the ninth. After falling short of a home run earlier in game, he took care of a first-pitch breaking ball. He smashed a two-run home run, 110 miles per hour off the bat, into left field.\n\nIndiana 10, Southern Miss 3\n\nBottom Ninth\n\nDavis Gillespie got a consolation run in the ninth, doubling to right field to score McIntyre.\n\nIndiana 10, Southern Miss 4\n\nTop Hoosier Performers\n\n#9 Tibbitts, Brock\n\n3-5, 1 HR, 4 RBI, 1 2B\n\n#10 Colopy, Morgan\n\n2-5, 2 R, 1 HR, 1 2B, 3 RBI\n\n#41 Bothwell, Ty\n\n5.2 IP, 7 H, 2 ER, 9 K\n\nNotes to Know\n\n• Brock Tibbitts was outstanding as the Hoosiers picked up a win to open their stay in Knoxville. He smashed three hits, taking his career tally to 197. He just needs three more to become the 25th member of the 200-hit club in program history.\n\n• Ty Bothwell continues to thrive in postseason play and today was no different. He struck out nine batters to move his career total to 240. He now sits No. 5 in program history after passing Kyle Hart (237, 2012-16) over the course of his Friday outing.\n\n• IU tallied 17 hits on Friday afternoon, the most in an NCAA Tournament game in program history. Three players had three-hit days as every starter in the order recorded at least one. The previous best for hits in a single NCAA Tournament game was 15, done twice.\n\n• This IU offense continues to move up the ranks as one of the best in program history. Both Tibbitts and Colopy doubled as the Hoosiers took the season tally to 136. IU needs just three more to break the single-season doubles record. This is the fifth season in program history hitting at least 80 home runs after Colopy and Tibbitts’ long balls against Southern Miss.\n\nPURDUE FOOTBALL\n\nTHIENEMAN LANDS ON LOTT IMPACT TROPHY WATCH LIST\n\nNEWPORT BEACH, Calif. – Coming off an All-American season as a freshman, Purdue defensive back Dillon Thieneman landed on the 2024 Lott IMPACT Trophy Watch List ahead of his sophomore campaign. The 2023 FWAA Defensive Freshman Player of the Year and Big Ten Freshman of the Year, Thieneman is one of only six sophomores on the watch list.\n\nNamed after Pro Football Hall of Fame member Ronnie Lott, the Lott IMPACT Trophy is awarded to college football’s defensive impact player of the year, someone who exhibits the same characteristics Lott embodied during his distinguished career: Integrity, Maturity, Performance, Academics, Community and Tenacity.\n\nThieneman had a breakout freshman campaign. As one of the best players in the country, regardless of class, Thieneman earned Third Team All-America accolades from The Associated Press to become the 50th All-American in program history. He was Purdue’s first All-America defensive back since Steve Jackson in 1990 (Gannett News Service) as well as the first AP All-America Boilermaker since College Football Hall of Famer Rod Woodson (1986).\n\nThieneman ended his 2023 campaign ranked third nationally in interceptions (6) and solo tackles (74), leading all freshmen and setting new Purdue freshman records. His six interceptions were double the nearest freshmen, while his 74 solo tackles ranked first amongst all Big Ten defenders. The defensive back made a pair of interceptions in the win over Indiana, bringing his season total to six to surpass Stuart Schweigert’s freshman record of five for a single season. Along with his pair of picks, Thieneman recorded a team-high eight tackles to lead the Purdue defense in stopping the Hoosiers. All of his tackles were solo, as he broke Woodson’s Purdue freshman record of 67 solo tackles in a single season. Thieneman was Purdue’s leading tackler in eight different games, cracking double figures four times.\n\nThe 2023 Thompson-Randle El Big Ten Freshman of the Year also paced the nation’s freshmen in total tackles (106) and forced fumbles (2). Thieneman became the seventh Boilermaker to be named Big Ten Freshman of the Year (Brian Fox – 1988, Eric Hunter – 1989, Corey Rogers – 1991, Stuart Schweigert – 2000, Rondale Moore – 2018, David Bell – 2019), including the third Purdue player in the last six seasons. He was the conference’s 11th defensive player to win the award as well as the fifth defensive back alongside the fellow Boilermaker Stuart Schweigert (2000), Charles Woodson (Michigan – 1995), Jabrill Peppers (Michigan – 2015) and Brandon Joseph (Northwestern – 2020).\n\nLast season, Thieneman was the only Big Ten freshman defender to make one of the three all-league teams, earning Second Team All-B1G honors from the coaches and third team accolades from the media. He was a five-time Big Ten Freshman of the Week honoree throughout the 2023 season, becoming the first defender in conference history to win any weekly award five times in a single season. The Purdue defensive back joined a list of only seven other Big Ten players (six quarterbacks, one running back) to win at least five weekly accolades in a single season and became the first Boilermaker to win a weekly conference award five times. Drew Brees (Offense – 2000), Travis Dorsch (Special Teams – 2001), Kyle Orton (Offense – 2004), Rondale Moore (Freshman – 2018) and David Bell (Freshman – 2019) collected Big Ten weekly honors four times in a season, tying for Purdue’s previous best.\n\nThieneman and the Boilermakers begin the 2024 season at home against Indiana State (Aug. 31). Kickoff from Ross-Ade Stadium is set for 12 p.m. ET on BTN.\n\nPURDUE WRESTLING\n\nTRIO OF BOILERMAKERS TO COMPETE ON FREESTYLE CIRCUIT THIS WEEKEND\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Three members of the Purdue Wrestling team will make the trek to Geneva, Ohio to compete in the USA Wrestling freestyle events being held at the Spire Institute on Saturday.\n\nOrland Cruz (79kg) and James Rowley (86kg) will represent the Boilermakers in the U20 World Team Trials tournament while Jacob Macatangay (61 kg) takes on the loaded field in the U23 Nationals bracket. Incoming freshman Isaiah Quintero qualified for the U20 competition after taking fifth at the U.S. Open back in April but is unable to attend this event.\n\nCruz comes in after going 18-7 in his debut collegiate campaign. He finished the season leading the team in tournament wins (16) while also recording the fastest tech fall with a 2:01 win over Ashland’s Hayden Flynn at the Purple Raider Open. He qualified for U20s thanks to a runner-up finish at the 2023 Fargo Freestyle National Championships.\n\nRowley is set to be a force in this tournament , bringing an impressive history on the freestyle circuit. The Corvalis native owns a silver medal from the 2021 Cadet Freestyle World Championships and is a two-time World Team member. With multiple wins over some of the other favorites in this tournament, MatScouts identified him as a “threat we haven’t seen in a while” in their weekend preview.\n\nThe Boilers lone representative in the U23 Nationals field, Macatangay enters a bracket with over 60 Division I wrestlers. The Plainsfield, Ill., native has four wins on his record as a Boilermaker, including three with bonus points.\n\nMatches for both tournaments will begin at 9:30 a.m. ET on Saturday, June 1. Medals matches and finals for the U20 World Team Trials will take place around 4:00 p.m. on the same day. The U23 brackets will run into Sunday starting at 10:00 a.m. Both events will be streamed live on FloWrestling.\n\nPURDUE BASEBALL\n\nPURDUE BASEBALL’S SUMMER LEAGUE ASSIGNMENTS\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Purdue Baseball players remain active on the field thanks to the opportunities provided by collegiate wood bat summer leagues, with Boilermakers slated to play for leagues from coast to coast.\n\nAfter his Big Ten Freshman of the Year campaign, Luke Gaffney heads east again and is set to take the field among some of the nation’s top prospects in the renowned Cape Cod League while playing for the Falmouth Commodores. He’ll become Purdue’s first position player to challenge himself in the Cape League since five-year starting center fielder Skyler Hunter in 2018.\n\nA host of Boilermakers will be playing in the Prospect League, which continues to expand and now features 18 teams spanning from Johnstown, Pa., to Metro St. Louis and Clinton, Iowa to Jackson, Tenn.\n\nThe Northwoods League serves as the Midwest-equivalent of the Cape Code League. Pitcher Enas Hayden has signed on to pitch for the Bismarck Larks of the Northwoods League after averaging 13.6 strikeouts per nine innings in 29 2/3 innings for the Danville Dans of the Prospect League last summer.\n\nLogan Sutter enjoyed a summer to remember a year ago as the Appalachian League Player of the Year for the league champion Johnson City Doughboys. This summer the Northern California native is slated to stay closer to home and play for the Healdsburg Prune Packers of the Pacific Empire League.\n\nGaffney played in the Cal Ripken League last summer and two of his Purdue teammates – Parker Dean and Mac Lewis – will be teammates with the Olney Cropdusters in the Washington, D.C.-area league this year. The Boilermakers also had players placed with the Cropdusters last summer.\n\nSome leagues began their schedules during the final week of May or first weekend of June. That includes the local teams within an hour of Purdue’s campus – the Lafayette Aviators (May 28 opener in the Prospect League), the Danville Dans (May 28 opener in the Prospect League) and Kokomo Jackrabbits (May 27 opener in the Northwoods League).\n\nThis page will be updated throughout the summer as new information becomes available.

The Broncos fell in their opening game to No. 2 national seed and regional host Kentucky on Friday afternoon, 10-8. The game is set to be carried live on ESPN+ and 105.5 The Legend.\n\nThe Sycamores and Illini (35-19) took the field for the third time in the 2024 season after splitting the season series with both teams winning their respective home contests. Both teams also competed in a fall scrimmage in Champaign providing a sense of familiarity between the two squads that played out on the field as the game settled into a pitcher’s duel early.\n\nIllinois took the lead in the top of the third inning with Dylan Westcott connecting on a two-run single through the right-side scoring Cal Hejza and Connor Milton to give the Illini the 2-0 lead. The Sycamores limited the damage as Josue Urdaneta fielded a grounder up the middle and turned the double play to end the inning.\n\nIllinois right-handed pitcher Jack Crowder (7-2) kept the Sycamores off-balance throughout the contest and retired the first nine Indiana State players in order before Randal Diaz led off the bottom of the fourth inning with a solo home run down the left field line. Luis Hernandez followed two batters later with a double down the right field line and advanced to third on a wild pitch putting the tying run 90 feet from the plate. However, Crowder escaped the jam getting a foul out to limit the Indiana State scoring chance.\n\nThe Fighting Illini continued to threaten throughout the contest putting runners on base in four of the final five frames before as Illinois took advantage of nine ISU walks and a hit-by-pitch to keep the pressure on the Sycamores.\n\nLuis Hernandez fielded a line drive and doubled off a runner to keep Illinois off the scoreboard in the fifth, before the Illini added to their lead in the eighth. Brody Harding singled home Westcott in the top of the eighth inning to give Illinois the 3-1 lead, and Milton scored on a passed ball in the ninth to put Illinois ahead 4-"
