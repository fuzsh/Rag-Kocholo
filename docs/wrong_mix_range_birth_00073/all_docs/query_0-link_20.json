        "text": "I know that each of you strives to become a wonderful, unique dancer. And those of you, who have already achieved that – dream of dancing for as long as possible, broadening their repertoire. In my class I aim to help you with that. I will pass on to you my knowledge, my vision, so that not only you will be improving your technique with every lesson, but so that the joy of dance stays with you for the rest of your life.\n\nI believe, that each of you has their own unique abilities. We will be working on both the basic technique exercises, and working with you on your personal strengths.\n\nCurrently a lot of things have moved to the world wide web, and I try to find joy in the fact that we still can work, even though we are not flying all over the world – we are in different rooms, on different continents. The internet gives us this opportunity.\n\nWe will work on technical aspects, drama, partner techniques, routines, variations, we will learn to win ballet competitions and create our own takes on different shows, we will learn about things that will prolong your time in the ballet world and will help develop and enhance your individuality as a dancer.\n\nBorn in Tbilisi, Georgia, Birkadze’s primary dance training began at the National Academy of Dance of Tbilisi with Vakhtang Chabukiani. Upon moving to Moscow he was invited to attend the Bolshoi Ballet Academy under the direction of Genady Ladiah where he graduated with Honours in Classical Ballet, Pas de Deux, and Traditional Dance.\n\nBirkadze was awarded the Gold Medal in Moscow for his brilliance in World History and Literature. During his dance studies, he obtained his Diploma in Business Administration with a Master in Art Direction, and Public Relations and Marketing. Upon graduating from the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, he furthered his studies as a Pedagogy in Dance.\n\nIn September of that same year, under the direction of Ekaterina Maximova, he joined the Kremlin Ballet, with directors Erick Volodin and Andrei Petrov.\n\nBirkadze has interpreted numerous roles with great success, some of which include works by Y. Grigorovich, A. Petrov and V. Vasiliev for which he was awarded the Silver Medal in Russia and the Bronze Medal in Luxembourg in 1996. During his professional career he has worked closely with Natalia Makarova, Christopher Wheeldon, Stanton Whelch, as well as many other great inspirations in the world of dance today.\n\nBirkadze danced and choreographed throughout Europe and in 1999, was promoted to Principal Dancer in the Young Ballet of Catalonia. Birkadze was also named Artistic Director of BMK Company, bringing elite dancers from around the world to perform in their galas.\n\nIn 2002, Birkadze began creating works for world renowned dancer Angel Corella, for whom he would continue to create works in years to come. During this time Birkadze also participated in numerous productions at the Gran Teatre del Liceu of Barcelona and taught in the most prestigious schools in the city. He continued to work with Angel Corella, creating Macbeth, Taming of the Shrew, Celaje, and numerous other ballets for Corella’s company, Stars of American Ballet, which would later become, Corella Ballet Castilla y Leon. In 2010 Birkadze joined the Sarasota Ballet at the rank of soloist and choreographed for their company.\n\nHe has since created works for companies throughout Europe, Southeast Asia, and the United States to critical acclaim.\n\nCurrently, Birkadze is based out of Boston, with his wife, American ballerina, Ashley Ellis.
