        "text": "Time heals all wounds, but these results left a dubious mark.\n\nWorst Losses in Sports History\n\nWe can learn from defeat, but not all losses are created equal. Sometimes, the result is an epic fail because of how it happened. Other times, the margin of defeat makes losing — already an awful feeling — even more terrible.\n\nOpponents, especially those who have no right to win and still do, also can produce humiliating losses. And every once it a while, a loss gets seared in memory because one team snatches defeat from the jaws of victory after blowing a huge lead.\n\nThese are the 51 worst losses in sports history, with each loss categorized as a blowout, blown lead, blunder or big upset.\n\n51. Saudi Arabia 2, Argentina 1\n\nSport: Soccer\n\nVenue: Lusail Stadium\n\nLocation: Lusail, Qatar\n\nDate: Nov. 22, 2022\n\nType of loss: Big upset\n\nArgentina was one of the pre-tournament favorites to win the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Saudi Arabia, a +2200 underdog, didn't get the memo and beat Argentina 2-1 in their opening game in one of the greatest upsets in World Cup history.\n\nSaudi Arabia executed a great game plan from manager Herve Renard, and goals by Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al-Dawsari in the second half sealed the deal. Al-Dawari's decisive strike in the 53rd minute was one of the most beautiful shots you will ever see.\n\nThe loss left Lionel Messi with another World Cup disappointment. Asked how his team felt after the game, Messi said: \"The truth? Dead. It's a very hard blow because we did not expect to start in this way. ... There are no excuses.\"\n\nBut the loss inspired Messi and the whole Argentina team. They didn't lose another game in the tournament, going on to win the world's biggest soccer prize. The World Cup championship was Messi's first and Argentina's third World Cup title.\n\n50. England 903, Australia 324\n\nSport: Cricket\n\nVenue: The Oval\n\nLocation: London, England\n\nDate: Aug. 20, 22-24, 1938\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nEngland’s Len Hutton set a world record with the highest individual score of 364, two Australian players got hurt, and Australia suffered the worst defeat in Test cricket history.\n\n49. North Carolina State 54, Houston 52\n\nSport: Basketball\n\nVenue: The Pit\n\nLocation: Albuquerque, N.M.\n\nDate: April 4, 1983\n\nType of loss: Big upset\n\nThe No. 1-seeded Houston Cougars boasted Clyde Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon and were known as Phi Slama Jama for their high-flying style.\n\nTheir 26-game winning streak ended when Jim Valvano’s North Carolina State, a six seed, upset Houston in the NCAA championship on Lorenzo Charles’ game-winning dunk.\n\n48. Holly Holm Defeats Ronda Rousey\n\nSport: Mixed martial arts\n\nVenue: Etihad Stadium\n\nLocation: Melbourne, Australia\n\nDate: Nov. 14, 2015\n\nType of loss: Big upset\n\nBefore this UFC fight Ronda Rousey was being hyped as the greatest fighter of all time by some. In fact, she’d never even lost a round in her career.\n\nBut Holm dominated Rousey throughout the fight.\n\nRousey only fought once more in UFC, also a loss, and then retired and joined the WWE.\n\n47. Steffi Graf Wins 6-0, 6-0 Over Natasha Zvereva\n\nSport: Tennis\n\nVenue: Stade Roland Garros\n\nLocation: Paris, France\n\nDate: June 4, 1988\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nPoor Natasha Zvereva. She ran directly into the buzzsaw that was Steffi Graf in 1988.\n\nGraf won all four Grand Slam singles titles that year, but none were as easy as her 32-minute victory in the French Open final at Roland Garros.\n\nIt’s the shortest Grand Slam final match ever.\n\n46. Jordan Spieth Blows Five-Shot Lead in 2015 Masters\n\nSport: Golf\n\nVenue: Augusta National Golf Club\n\nLocation: Augusta, Ga.\n\nDate: April 10, 2016\n\nType of loss: Blown lead\n\nIt looked like Jordan Spieth was going to continue his dominating run. He already had won the Masters and U.S. Open in 2015, but Spieth collapsed at the 2016 Masters.\n\nHe led by five strokes after the front nine of the final round, but carded two straight bogeys and then a devastating quadruple-bogey that knocked him out of the lead for good.\n\n45. Man o' War Loses to Upset\n\nSport: Horse racking\n\nVenue: Saratoga Race Course\n\nLocation: Saratoga Springs, N.Y.\n\nDate: Aug. 12, 1919\n\nType of loss: Big upset\n\nMany horse racing experts consider Man o' War to be the greatest racehorse of all time.\n\nThe only blemish on his record came against an aptly named horse called Upset.\n\nThe loss was the only time Man o' War finished out of first place in 21 lifetime starts.\n\n44.

Australia 142, Namibia 0\n\nSport: Rugby\n\nVenue: Adelaide Oval\n\nLocation: Adelaide, Australia\n\nDate: Oct. 23, 2003\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nAustralia is known as a rugby power, but it took it to a whole new level in the 2003 Rugby World Cup against a hapless Namibia squad.\n\nThe 142-0 win set the record for the biggest blowout in World Cup history, and narrowly missed out on the record high margin of victory, 145, set by New Zealand against Japan.\n\nTo Japan's credit, at least its team scored 17 in defeat.\n\n42. UCF 52, Baylor 42\n\nSport: Football\n\nVenue: University of Phoenix Stadium\n\nLocation: Glendale, Ariz.\n\nDate: Jan. 1, 2014\n\nType of loss: Big upset\n\nBaylor had the best regular season in school history and felt like it should have made the College Football Playoff. Instead, the Bears played the UCF Golden Knights in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nBaylor was favored by 16.5 points, but ended up losing by 10 to a Golden Knights team that featured Blake Bortles at quarterback.\n\n41. Aledo High School 91, Western Hills High School\n\nSport: Football\n\nVenue: Aledo/Bearcat Stadium\n\nLocation: Aledo, Texas\n\nDate: Oct. 22, 2013\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nYou know a game is a big blowout when you get accused of bullying.\n\nAledo's high school football team, ranked No. 1 in the state of Texas at the time, did not stop scoring against Western Hills.\n\nOne Western Hills parent had enough and filed an official complaint of bullying on the school’s website, but the complaint was dismissed.\n\n40. Indiana Pacers 107, New York Knicks 105\n\nSport: Basketball\n\nVenue: Madison Square Garden\n\nLocation: New York, New York\n\nDate: May 7, 1995\n\nType of loss: Blown lead\n\nThe Knicks-Pacers rivalry in the 1990s was one of the fiercest in NBA history.\n\nThis game produced a legendary moment when Reggie Miller scored eight points in 18.7 seconds to stun the Knicks in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\n39. AS Adema 149, SO l’Emyrne 0\n\nSport: Soccer\n\nVenue: Mahamasina Municipal Stadium\n\nLocation: Antananarivo, Madagascar\n\nDate: Oct. 31, 2002\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nSOE was upset about some refereeing decisions in previous games, so to protest, the team scored 149 goals against themselves.\n\nIf they wanted to make a statement that would be remembered, they succeeded. Their coach was suspended for three years as punishment.\n\n38. Rulon Gardner Defeats Aleksandr Karelin\n\nSport: Wrestling\n\nVenue: Sydney Convention and Exhibition Center\n\nLocation: Sydney, Australia\n\nDate: Sept. 25, 2000\n\nType of loss: Big upset\n\nAleksandr Karelin is known as the greatest Greco-Roman wrestler of all time.\n\nBefore the gold-medal match at the 2000 Olympics, Karelin hadn’t lost in 13 years or dropped a point in six, but he was defeated by an unknown kid from Wyoming named Rulon Gardner.\n\nGardner became a worldwide celebrity with the upset, one of the biggest in Olympic history. Karelin finished his career with 887 wins and two losses.\n\n37. New York Giants 20, Buffalo Bills 19\n\nSport: Football\n\nVenue: Tampa Stadium\n\nLocation: Tampa, Fla.\n\nDate: Jan. 27, 1991\n\nType of loss: Blunder\n\nMissing a 47-yard field goal isn’t the most unforgivable blunder in the world, but Scott Norwood’s famous \"Wide Right\" missed field goal at the end of Super Bowl 25 is frozen in Bills fans’ memories.\n\nThe miss began a string of four consecutive Super Bowl losses for the Bills, something the franchise has still never recovered from.\n\n36. Oklahoma Sooners, 77, Texas A&M 0\n\nSport: Football\n\nVenue: Gaylord Family Memorial Stadium\n\nLocation: Norman, Okla.\n\nDate: Nov. 8, 2003\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nOn paper, this game wasn’t a huge mismatch. In fact, Texas A&M beat Oklahoma the season before.\n\nBut this game was over at kickoff. It was 49-0 at halftime and 77-0 after three quarters.\n\nBob Stoops eventually ordered his team not to score any more, a task that was more difficult to execute than one would think.\n\n35. Nate Diaz Submits Conor McGregor\n\nSport: Mixed martial arts\n\nVenue: MGM Grand Garden Arena\n\nLocation: Las Vegas, Nev.\n\nDate: March 5, 2016\n\nType of loss: Big upset\n\nConor McGregor had become the most famous name in the MMA world with his brash attitude and penchant for self-promotion. And he was backing it up in the Octagon, too.\n\nHe appeared to have an easy route to another title when he faced Nate Diaz, who was only given 11 days to prepare for the UFC fight as an injury replacement.\n\nBut Diaz submitted McGregor in the second round, putting a serious dent in McGregor’s aura of invincibility.\n\n34. Texas A&M 92, Northern Iowa 88\n\nSport: Basketball\n\nVenue: Chesapeake Arena\n\nLocation: Oklahoma City, Okla.\n\nDate: March 21, 2016\n\nType of loss: Blown lead\n\nThe NCAA tournament is called March Madness for a reason, but this second-round contest really hurt Northern Iowa.\n\nBy some calculations Northern Iowa had a 100-percent chance of winning this game. They were up by 12 points with 44 seconds to go, up by 10 with 30 seconds left, and tied at the end of regulation.\n\nThe Aggies won in double overtime, completing the biggest final-minute comeback in NCAA Division I history.\n\n33. New York Jets 16, Baltimore Colts 7\n\nSport: Football\n\nVenue: Orange Bowl\n\nLocation: Miami, Fla.\n\nDate: Jan. 12, 1969\n\nType of loss: Big upset\n\nThe New York Jets' victory in Super Bowl III is considered one of the greatest upsets in sports history.\n\nBy defeating the Baltimore Colts, who were favored by 18 points, the Jets proved that the AFL belonged with the NFL.\n\nJets quarterback Joe Namath famously guaranteed the victory and then delivered it with an MVP-worthy performance.\n\n32. USA 4, Soviet Union 3\n\nSport: Hockey\n\nVenue: Olympic Center\n\nLocation: Lake Placid, N.Y.\n\nDate: Feb. 22, 1980\n\nType of loss: Big upset\n\nThe \"Miracle on Ice\" was a seminal moment in U.S. sports history.\n\nA team of amateur Americans defeated the mighty Soviet Union in the Olympic hockey semifinals. The Soviet Union was a team of professionals that were thought to be unbeatable.\n\nThe win was a great American moment, and a devastating result for the Soviets.\n\n31. New York Giants 17, New England Patriots 14\n\nSport: Football\n\nVenue: University of Phoenix Stadium\n\nLocation: Glendale, Ariz.\n\nDate: Feb. 3, 2008\n\nType of loss: Big upset\n\nThe Patriots went undefeated in the NFL's 2007 regular season, becoming only the second team to ever accomplish that feat.\n\nMeanwhile, the Giants barely squeaked into the playoffs.\n\nThe Patriots were favored by 12 points in Super Bowl 42, but Eli Manning, aided by a miracle catch from David Tyree, and the Giants shocked the world.\n\n30. Indianapolis Colts 45, Kansas City Chiefs 44\n\nSport: Football\n\nVenue: Lucas Oil Stadium\n\nLocation: Indianapolis, Ind.\n\nDate: Jan. 4, 2014\n\nType of loss: Blown lead\n\nThe Chiefs have had their fair share of playoff disappointment, but this one takes the cake when it comes to devastating moments.\n\nKansas City led 38-10 in the third quarter, but everything went wrong after that.\n\nThe defense collapsed, the offense failed to manage the clock, and the Chiefs extended their playoff losing streak to eight games.\n\n29. Villanova 66, Georgetown 64\n\nSport: Basketball\n\nVenue: Rupp Arena\n\nLocation: Lexington, Ky.\n\nDate: April 1, 1985\n\nType of loss: Big upset\n\nSome call it \"The Perfect Game.\"\n\nIn the 1985 NCAA men's basketball final, the No. 8-seeded Villanova Wildcats completed one of the greatest tournament runs in history by defeating the top-ranked Georgetown Hoyas.\n\nVillanova still is the lowest seed to ever win the NCAA tournament.\n\n28. Chicago Bears 73, Washington Redskins 0\n\nSport: Football\n\nVenue: Griffith Stadium\n\nLocation: Washington, D.C.\n\nDate: Dec. 8, 1940\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nNot only is this loss the biggest defeat in an NFL championship game, but it's also the biggest defeat in any game in NFL history.\n\nEntering the game, the Bears were slight favorites, but they scored 11 touchdowns to destroy the Redskins, who had beaten them 7-3 only three weeks before.\n\n27. UMBC 74, Virginia 54\n\nSport: Basketball\n\nVenue: Spectrum Center\n\nLocation: Charlotte, N.C.\n\nDate: March 16, 2018\n\nType of loss: Big upset\n\nThe NCAA tournament is known for huge upsets, but never in the history of the tournament had a 16 seed beaten a 1 seed. Until 2018.\n\nAnd University of Maryland, Baltimore County didn't just beat No. 1 overall seed Virginia. The Retrievers crushed them by 20 points.\n\nIt was one of the most shocking results ever.\n\n26. Buster Douglas Knocks Out Mike Tyson\n\nSport: Boxing\n\nVenue: Tokyo Dome\n\nLocation: Tokyo, Japan\n\nDate: Feb. 11, 1990\n\nType of loss: Big upset\n\nMike Tyson was the baddest man on the planet, vanquishing foes with his devastating right hand. No one gave Buster Douglas any chance in this heavyweight title bout.\n\nBut Douglas, whose mother had passed away 23 days prior, dominated Tyson the whole fight before knocking him out in the 10th round.\n\nIt was the first time Tyson even had been knocked down in his career.\n\n25. Slovakia 82, Bulgaria 0\n\nSport: Hockey\n\nVenue: Liepaja Arena\n\nLocation: Liepaja, Latvia\n\nDate: Sept. 10, 2008\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nThe Slovakian women’s hockey team had no mercy on the poor Bulgarians in this pre-qualifying tournament for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. The Bulgarians also lost 30-1 and 41-0 in the same tournament.\n\n24. North Korea 1, Italy 0\n\nSport: Soccer\n\nVenue: Ayresome Park\n\nLocation: Middlesborough, England\n\nDate: July 19, 1966\n\nType of loss: Big upset\n\nThe proud Italians were eliminated from the 1966 World Cup by North Korea, which already had shocked the world by qualifying for the tournament.\n\nEnglish fans — who appreciated the North Korean team's style of play, and the fact that they beat one of their European rivals — embraced and loved this group of overachieving underdogs.\n\n23. Morningside High 102, South Torrance 24\n\nSport: Basketball\n\nVenue: Morningside Gym\n\nLocation: Inglewood, Calif.\n\nDate: Feb. 7, 1990\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nThis game is most famous for future WNBA Hall of Famer Lisa Leslie, a 6-foot-5 center, scoring 101 points in one half for the Morningside High School girls basketball team.\n\nSouth Torrance refused to play in the second half, robbing Leslie of her chance to break Cheryl Miller’s national record (at the time) of 105 points in a game.\n\n22. Ned Jarrett Wins by 14 Laps Over Second Place\n\nSport: Auto racing\n\nVenue: Darlington Raceway\n\nLocation: Darlington, S.C.\n\nDate: Sept. 6, 1965\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nNed Jarrett set a NASCAR record that still stands to this day, winning the race by 14 laps over the second-place finisher and 19 laps over the third- and fourth-place finishers.

Minnesota Vikings 29, New Orleans Saints 24\n\nSport: Football\n\nVenue: U.S. Bank Stadium\n\nLocation: Minneapolis, Minn.\n\nDate: Jan. 14, 2018\n\nType of loss: Blunder\n\nThe home team was headed for the offseason. With 10 seconds left and the ball on their own 30-yard line, the Vikings were down 24-23, desperately trying to get downfield to attempt a game-winning field goal.\n\nInstead, on a deep pass to wide receiver Stefon Diggs, Saints safety Marcus Williams overran Diggs and allowed him to sprint down the sidelines into the end zone to win the game. The \"Minneapolis Miracle\" was born.\n\n20. San Francisco 49ers 39, New York Giants 38\n\nSport: Football\n\nVenue: Candlestick Park\n\nLocation: San Francisco, Calif.\n\nDate: Jan. 5, 2003\n\nType of loss: Blunder/blown lead\n\nThis game had a bit of everything. The Giants blew a 38-14 second-half lead. That was bad enough, but the way they lost at the end lives long in the memory of New York fans.\n\nWith three minutes left, newly signed 41-year-old deep snapper Trey Junkin botched a snap, resulting in a missed field goal. Then, with six seconds left, Junkin missed with another snap, resulting in a wild pass play that ended in an incompletion. The Giants also were called for an illegal man downfield.\n\nThe NFL later admitted the 49ers should have been called for pass interference, which would have created offsetting penalties and a replay of the down.\n\n19. Cleveland Cavaliers 148, Miami Heat 80\n\nSport: Basketball\n\nVenue: Richfield Coliseum\n\nLocation: Cleveland, Ohio\n\nDate: Dec. 17, 1991\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nThe biggest blowout in NBA history featured the Heat only scoring 27 points in the second half.

Manchester City 6, Manchester United 1\n\nSport: Soccer\n\nVenue: Old Trafford\n\nLocation: Manchester, England\n\nDate: Oct. 23, 2011\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nThe result was not the biggest margin of victory ever, but it may have been the most important. The bitter rivals finished the season tied for the Premier League title on points. Manchester City was crowned champion based on goal differential.\n\n17. USSR 51, USA 50\n\nSport: Basketball\n\nVenue: Rudi-Sedlmayer-Halle\n\nLocation: Munich, Germany\n\nDate: Sept. 9, 1972\n\nType of loss: Big upset\n\nThe United States men’s basketball team never had lost an Olympic game before this one — the gold-medal game of the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics — which they lost to their country’s most bitter rival.\n\nThe game was shrouded in numerous controversies that still are debated, while the U.S. team continues to protest the result and refuses to accept its silver medals to this day.\n\n16. Seahawks 21, Cowboys 20\n\nSport: Football\n\nVenue: Qwest Field\n\nLocation: Seattle, Wash.\n\nDate: Jan. 6, 2007\n\nType of loss: Blunder\n\nThe Cowboys were one 19-yard field goal away from beating the Seahawks and advancing in the playoffs.\n\nBut Tony Romo, who had taken over the Cowboys’ starting quarterback job during the season, remained the holder for field goals and dropped the snap. He picked it up, tried running for the first down and was tackled.\n\nIt became an iconic play —albeit in a bad way — in Romo’s career.\n\n15. Houston Rockets 120, Orlando Magic 118\n\nSport: Basketball\n\nVenue: Orlando Arena\n\nLocation: Orlando, Fla.\n\nDate: June 7, 1995\n\nType of loss: Blunder\n\nNick Anderson is one of the best players in Magic history, but he always will be remembered for missing four straight free throws at the end of Game 1 in the 1995 NBA Finals against the Houston Rockets.\n\nIf he had hit even one of those free throws, the Magic would have been up by four, and Kenny Smith’s 3-pointer with 1.6 seconds left would not have sent the game to overtime.\n\nThe Magic ended up getting swept in the series.\n\n14. Germany 7, Brazil 1\n\nSport: Sport\n\nVenue: Estadio Mineirão\n\nLocation: Belo Horizonte, Brazil\n\nDate: July 8, 2014\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nBrazil was supposed to win the World Cup when it hosted the event in 2014. The entire country expected and anticipated a celebration, and when the team advanced to the semifinals the dream seemed so close.\n\nThen, Germany thrashed Brazil 7-1, sending the country into a depression known as the \"Agony of Mineirão.\"\n\n13. Seattle Seahawks 43, Denver Broncos 8\n\nSport: Football\n\nVenue: MetLife Stadium\n\nLocation: East Rutherford, NJ\n\nDate: Feb. 2, 2014\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nThe Broncos were favored to win Super Bowl XLVIII, but everything that could go wrong did. The first snap sailed over Peyton Manning’s head and was recovered by the Broncos in the end zone for a safety.\n\nThe rest of the night didn’t get any better for the Broncos as Seattle won its first Lombardi trophy.\n\n12. San Francisco 49ers 55, Denver Broncos 10\n\nSport: Football\n\nVenue: Superdome\n\nLocation: New Orleans, La.\n\nDate: Jan. 28, 1990\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nSuper Bowl XXIV was a mismatch from the start. The heavily favored 49ers sported a roster of five future Hall of Famers, and they played like it.\n\nJoe Montana threw for five touchdowns en route to his third Super Bowl MVP.\n\n11. New England Patriots 34, Atlanta Falcons 28\n\nSport: Football\n\nVenue: NRG Stadium\n\nLocation: Houston, Texas\n\nDate: Feb. 5, 2017\n\nType of loss: Blown lead\n\nThe Falcons were up 28-3 in Super Bowl LI and somehow managed to lose. It’s become such a common joke that it’s easy to forget how bad the loss was for the Falcons.\n\nThe Patriots scored 25 unanswered points and then scored on their first possession in overtime to win the game.\n\n10. Detroit Red Wings 15, New York Rangers 0\n\nSport: Hockey\n\nVenue: Detroit Olympia Stadium\n\nLocation: Detroit, Mich.\n\nDate: Jan. 23, 1944\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nWhen a goalie makes 43 saves that usually marks an incredible night for the netminder, but not in the case of Rangers goalie Ken \"Tubby\" McAuley. He let in 15 goals this night en route to the worst loss in NHL history.\n\nThe 15 straight goals scored by the Red Wings also are a record.\n\n8. Greg Norman Loses 1996 Masters by Five Strokes\n\nVenue: Augusta National Golf Club\n\nLocation: Augusta, Ga.\n\nDate: April 14, 1996\n\nType of loss: Blown lead\n\nGreg Norman, or \"The Shark\" as he was known, got eaten up this time.\n\nNorman took a six-stroke lead into the final day at Augusta and managed to lose by five strokes. He carded a final-day 78 to lose to Nick Faldo, who shot a 67.\n\n7. New England Patriots 28, Seattle Seahawks 24\n\nSport: Football\n\nVenue: University of Phoenix Stadium\n\nLocation: Glendale, Ariz.\n\nDate: Feb. 1, 2015\n\nType of loss: Blunder\n\nSeattle could have won two straight Super Bowls.\n\nBut for some inexplicable reason in Super Bowl XLIX, the Seahawks decided to throw a pass from the 1-yard line instead of handing the ball off to running back Marshawn Lynch, one of the premiere short-yardage backs in the NFL.\n\nMalcolm Butler intercepted Russell Wilson’s short pass with less than a minute to play, securing victory for the New England Patriots.\n\n6. Florida Marlins 8, Chicago Cubs 3\n\nSport: Baseball\n\nVenue: Wrigley Field\n\nLocation: Chicago, Ill.\n\nDate: Oct. 14, 2003\n\nType of loss:Blunder\n\nThe Chicago Cubs were five outs away from going to their first World Series since 1945 when everything fell apart.\n\nIt started with the famous Steve Bartman incident, where a fan interfered with a foul ball that Cubs outfielder Moises Alou appeared in position to catch.\n\nThings spiraled from there. Cubs shortstop Alex Gonzalez dropped an easy double-play groundball, and the Marlins scored eight runs in the inning to win the game.\n\nThey went on to win Game 7 of the NLCS and took the 2003 World Series.\n\n5. North Carolina Tar heels 77, Michigan Wolverines 71\n\nSport: Basketball\n\nVenue: Louisiana Superdome\n\nLocation: New Orleans, La.\n\nDate: April 5, 1993\n\nType of loss:Blunder\n\nThe Fab Five for Michigan changed college basketball forever with their talent and swag, but they failed to win a national title despite making the championship game two years in a row.\n\nThe second of those games — this 1993 NCAA championship game — involved the infamous Chris Webber timeout when his team was out of their allotted amount. The result was a technical foul, icing the game for the Tar Heels.\n\n4. Jean Van de Velde Blows British Open on Final Hole\n\nSports: Golf\n\nVenue: Carnoustie Golf Links\n\nLocation: Angus, Scotland\n\nDate: July 18, 1999\n\nType of loss: Blunder/blown lead\n\nAll Jean Van de Velde had to do to become the first Frenchman since 1907 to win a major golf tournament was double bogey the 18th hole at Carnoustie. What he did instead has gone down in golf history as the most embarrassing loss ever.\n\nThe comedy of errors started with an errant drive. Then, his second shot hit the railings of the grandstands and a stone wall and rolled 50 yards backward. His third shot flew into a shallow water hazard.\n\nThat’s when things got absurd as Van de Velde decided to hit the shot out of the hazard, removing his socks and shoes and wading into the water before deciding to take the drop.\n\nHis next shot went into the bunker, and when he finally got the ball into the hole, it was a triple bogey, sending him to a three-way playoff that he lost.\n\nHe never won a major tournament.\n\n3. St. Louis Cardinals 10, Texas Rangers 9\n\nSport: Baseball\n\nVenue: Busch Stadium\n\nLocation: St. Louis, Mo.\n\nDate: Oct. 27, 2011\n\nType of loss: Blown lead\n\nThe Texas Rangers made history on this night, just not the kind of history anyone wants to be making. They became the first team in history to be one strike away from winning the World Series twice in the same game and lose.\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals third baseman David Freese delivered the crushing blow both times, hitting a game-tying triple in the bottom of the ninth inning and the walk-off home run in the bottom of the 11th.\n\nThe Cardinals went on to win the World Series in Game 7, and the Rangers still are waiting for their first World Series title.\n\n2. New York Mets 6, Boston Red Sox 5\n\nSport: Baseball\n\nVenue: Shea Stadium\n\nLocation: Queens, N.Y.\n\nDate: October 25, 1986\n\nType of loss: Blunder\n\nThe Red Sox were so close to their first World Series since 1918 they could taste it. In fact, the champagne already was waiting for them in the locker room.\n\nBut a wild pitch in the 10th inning allowed the tying run to score. Then, a routine ground ball to first baseman Bill Buckner — a ball that should have been the final out of the inning and sent the game to the 11th — went right between Buckner’s legs.\n\nThe winning run scored for the Mets. They went on to win the World Series in seven. And Red Sox misery continued until 2004.\n\n1. Georgia Tech 222, Cumberland 0\n\nSport: Football\n\nVenue: Grant Field\n\nLocation: Atlanta, Ga.\n\nDate: Oct. 7, 1916\n\nType of loss: Blowout\n\nThe very definition of a blowout. Cumberland College experienced a beatdown of epic proportions.\n\nCumberland actually had disbanded its football program before the 1916 season, but Georgia Tech coach John Heisman demanded they honor the contract and play the game, so Cumberland struck up a makeshift team and played the game.\n\nHeisman, who also coached baseball, reportedly was angry about Cumberland’s baseball team beating Georgia Tech 22-0 the season before. How bad was the revenge? Every Georgia Tech first down was a touchdown, while Cumberland committed 15 turnovers and did not record one first down."
