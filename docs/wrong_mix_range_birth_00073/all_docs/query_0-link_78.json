Soon she finds herself trapped in a chaotic spiral forged of sleep deprivation, paranoia and a paralyzing fear of the unseen, which like a pack of emotional phantoms, begin to derail her life, even forcing her to consider the unthinkable option of going back to her abusive, but somehow twistedly stable relationship.\n\nJennifer’s only chance is to uncover the mystery of the strange bites, a mystery that seems to spring from the vacant apartment next door and the tortured woman who once lived there.\n\nWhat Jennifer finds is a horrible revelation, something that defies belief. Something that can only be stopped through the summoning of her own inner will to remain a survivor.\n\nBut can she confront her fears, restore her sanity and ultimately wage a final battle before the last, bloody bite is taken?”\n\nAnd three pictures from the film:\n\n(Click on a picture to enlarge.)\n\nWhat’s gnawing at her?\n\nThe film has yet to get an official release date.\n\nStay tuned with us for more details about the movie Gnaw.\n\n:)"
