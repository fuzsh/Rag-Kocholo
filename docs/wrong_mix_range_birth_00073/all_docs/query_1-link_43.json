        "text": "Hana Mandlíková (born 19 February 1962, in Prague) is a former Czech professional tennis player from Czechoslovakia and later Australia. During her career, she won four Grand Slam singles titles – two at the Australian Open, one at the French Open, and one at the US Open. She was the runner-up at four Grand Slam singles events and won one Grand Slam women's doubles title, the US Open in 1989 with Martina Navrátilová. Beginning with the 1980 US Open and extending through Wimbledon in 1981, Mandlíková played in four consecutive Grand Slam singles finals.\n\nStruggling with injuries and a lack of confidence, Mandlíková retired at the relatively early age of 28.\n\nContents\n\n1 Personal life\n\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Junior\n\n2.2 Professional\n\n3 Major finals\n\n3.1 Grand Slam finals\n\n3.1.1 Singles: 8 (4 titles, 4 runner-ups)\n\n3.1.2 Doubles: 4 (1 title, 3 runner-ups)\n\n3.2 Year-End Championships finals\n\n3.2.1 Singles: 1 (0 titles, 1 runner-up)\n\n3.2.2 Doubles: 1 (1 title, 0 runner-ups)\n\n4 Titles (46)\n\n4.1 Singles (27)\n\n4.2 Doubles (19)\n\n5 Runner-ups (43)\n\n5.1 Singles (24)\n\n5.2 Doubles (19)\n\n6 Grand Slam singles performance timeline\n\n7 See also\n\n8 References\n\n9 External links\n\nPersonal life\n\nMandlíková is the daughter of Vilém Mandlík, who was an Olympic 200 meter semifinalist for Czechoslovakia in 1956. Hana married Australian restaurateur Jan Sedlak in Prague in 1986:[1] they divorced two years later, shortly after Mandlikova obtained Australian citizenship. In June 2002, she gave birth to twins Mark Vilém and Elisabeth Hana. Their father was a friend who was to have no role in their upbringing; Mandlikova intending to raise them with her partner, fitness trainer Liz Resseguie.[2]\n\nCareer\n\nJunior\n\nMandlíková first came to the tennis world's attention as a junior player. In 1978, the International Tennis Federation launched the world junior rankings, and Mandlíková became the first ever female World No. 1 junior player.\n\nProfessional\n\nMandlíková captured her first Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open in 1980, defeating Wendy Turnbull in straight sets in the final. Her second came a year later at the French Open with straight-sets wins over Chris Evert in the semifinals and West German left-hander Sylvia Hanika in the final. Mandlíková was also the runner-up at the US Open in 1980 and 1982 and at Wimbledon in 1981, losing in all three finals to Evert.\n\nIn 1983, Mandlíková led Czechoslovakia to the first of three consecutive Fed Cup titles. The following year she defeated Martina Navratilova in three sets in the final at Oakland, California, ending Navratilova's 54 match winning streak, two short of tying the record held by Evert at the time. Navratilova then embarked on a 74 match winning streak, a record that still stands.\n\nIn 1985, Mandlíková became the first woman since Tracy Austin to beat both Evert and Navratilova in the same tournament when she beat the top seeded Evert in the semifinals and then the second seeded Navratilova in the three-set final at the US Open. The following year, Mandlíková teamed with Turnbull to win the women's doubles title at the WTA Tour Championships. In doing so, they defeated the top two teams of the time, Navratilova and Pam Shriver in the semifinals and Claudia Kohde Kilsch and Helena Suková in the final. Mandlíková and Turnbull were also runners-up to Navratilova and Shriver at Wimbledon and the US Open in 1986. Mandlíková also lost in the Wimbledon singles final that year to Navratilova but not before avenging her 1981 final loss to Evert in the semifinals. Another high point of Mandlíková's summer that year was a win over Steffi Graf in the quarterfinals of the French Open. Graf had won four titles that season on clay with victories over Mandlíková, Evert, Navratilova, Kohde Kilsch, and Gabriela Sabatini, and even held a match point in the second set of their quarterfinal before Mandlíková stopped Graf's run.\n\nIn 1987, Mandlíková won her fourth and final Grand Slam singles title when she beat Navratilova in straight sets in the final of the Australian Open. Her last consistent performance in a Grand Slam event was at the 1988 Australian Open, where, as the defending champion, she reached the quarterfinals before losing to the eventual champion, Steffi Graf.\n\nMandlíková and Navratilova then teamed in 1989 to win the US Open women's doubles title, beating Shriver and Mary Joe Fernandez in the final.\n\nMandlíková assumed Australian citizenship in 1988. She retired from the professional tennis tour in 1990, having won 27 singles titles and 19 doubles titles. Her career-high singles ranking was World No. 3.\n\nSince retiring from the tour, Mandlíková has become a successful tennis coach. She coached Jana Novotná for 9 years, during which time Novotná won Wimbledon and reached the World No. 2 ranking. Mandlíková has also captained the Czech Republic's Fed Cup team.\n\nMandlíková is one of 13 women during the open era to have reached the singles final of all four Grand Slam tournaments. She is one of five women who have won Grand Slam singles titles on clay, grass, and hard courts, with the others being Graf, Navratilova, Evert, and Serena Williams.\n\nMandlíková was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1994.\n\nMajor finals\n\nGrand Slam finals\n\nSingles: 8 (4 titles, 4 runner-ups)\n\nOutcome Year Championship Surface Opponent in the final Score in the final
