It would have been easy to choose an individual who altered the landscape of American tennis. Players with names like McEnroe, Connors, Lendl, Navratilova, Evert, Borg and Agassi came to mind. These players were dynamic role models who dominated the sport for a period of time. Their styles and personas were painstakingly imitated while they invoked images of greatness in the minds of children and adults alike. These and many others are worthy of mention when one speaks of great tennis players. When I decided to name my book Bollettieri: Changing the Game, I felt compelled to dedicate my life story to the two people who not only changed American tennis, but also with poise and quiet confidence, elevated the sport of tennis to unprecedented levels worldwide. These two people “Changed the Game” across the planet and left an indelible mark on the human conscience. I dedicate my life story to Arthur Ashe and Billie Jean King. Most people in life build foundations from the ground up. Arthur and Billie Jean tore down foundations. They did this to enable people to have a chance to survive in life. Without people like them, tennis wouldn’t be where it is today. Arthur could have been president—that’s the way I feel about him. Very few people could endure the indignities that he encountered without succumbing to anger and despair. He turned the other cheek time and again while honing his skills to become a world champion against all odds. He then used his celebrity to advocate for diversity and changed the collective minds and practices of people 9\n\nNick Bollettieri around the world. Arthur was a human rights activist who challenged us to reach inside and find our better selves. Billie Jean is a pioneer who fought for women’s rights. Don’t think for one moment that her match against Bobby Riggs was simply a victory on the tennis court. That match was a defining moment in human evolution—a moment that allowed 3.5 billion women, about 50% of the world’s population, to dream of equality. So, allowing another perspective, Bobby Riggs was not a combatant, he was a partner in an event that forever changed the landscape of human rights. Billie Jean King and Arthur Ashe are much more than champions on the tennis court. They are both “Champions of Humanity” who were able to dream wonderful dreams, and each was willing to pay the price for those dreams to come true! I am proud to have known them and called each of them “Friend.”\n\n10\n\nFOREWORD by Jim Courier\n\nNick Bollettieri is a pioneer. He altered the tennis landscape when he started the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy (NBTA) in Bradenton, Florida in 1981. Until then, most top junior players practiced at their local tennis clubs or in public parks with whomever their parents or coach could find for them, a haphazard process at best. At NBTA, Nick created the first full-time boarding school where the best junior tennis players from around the world lived and practiced with (and against) each other in a highly disciplined, professional and competitive environment. He hired coaches, physical trainers and even a sports psychologist (Dr. Jim Loehr, himself a pioneer in that field) to give the students all of the tools they needed to pursue excellence. They were trained in the same fashion as the top professionals who also spent time at Nick’s Academy. It was a remarkable new approach for those lucky enough to be there. I became one of the lucky ones starting in 1984 when I was 14 years old. Nick has never been interested in conforming to the norm. One of the results of his tennis revolution was that he accelerated the path to the pros for male players. Teen girls like Chris Evert, Tracy Austin and Andrea Jaeger had already made the leap from juniors to pros with great success—made possible by the fact that in women’s tennis, girls matured earlier physically and mentally. But before NBTA came along, all of the best American male players—Arthur Ashe, Stan Smith, Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe—went to college for at least one year to get more seasoning before they would turn pro. Nick didn’t believe in playing the waiting game. He wanted success, and he wanted it now. With Nick’s vision being implemented\n\n11\n\nNick Bollettieri at NBTA, the first male American teen prodigies, Jimmy Arias and Aaron Krickstein, who would be followed shortly by Andre Agassi, both made their marks on the pro game as teenagers without going to college. In fact, they turned pro and hit the road full-time before they turned 17. Since then, Nick’s innovations have become the norm. All of the top juniors skip college and go pro in their teens. It’s rare for them to stay at home unless they live in cities like Los Angeles, Miami, Paris or Barcelona, which all have topflight coaching and training. It’s a given that promising players have to move to where the best training is. I lived and trained at NBTA from 1985 to 1989. Those were incredibly formative years in my life and I look back on them fondly (even if Andre Agassi described it as being similar to Lord of the Flies). Nick changed the course of my life, as he has with so many others, by offering me a scholarship to attend NBTA, which my family couldn’t otherwise afford. Even though I was one of the best players in the U.S. for my age, I still knew I was at a disadvantage training-wise compared to the Academy kids, and I desperately wanted to be there to ensure I wouldn’t get left behind. The Academy was eye-opening for me. It was a proving ground where I received top-notch coaching from Nick and the many other capable members of his staff, and could test myself daily on (and off) the court against the best juniors in the world. Nick provided us the opportunity to push each other to greater heights. I’m not sure what course my tennis career would have taken had I not been given that opportunity. Little did I know I would end up being one of Nick’s students who would reach the No. 1 ranking in the world. One of the great things about Nick’s experiment was that it was a true meritocracy. All of us there wanted to be the best tennis player on campus, and there was only one way to prove it—by winning on the court. We played matches daily to see which rung we occupied in our group ladders. I was in Group 1, which was the highest level\n\n12\n\nChanging the Game on campus. At age 14, I was playing against boys as old as 18. Andre and I were the youngest in that group when I got there, and it was a big change having to battle on the back courts daily with players who were not only the best in their hometowns, as I was, but also bigger, stronger, and as hungry as I was. It made me tough in a hurry. One of the rewards for playing well on the back courts in Group 1 and moving up in the pecking order was to get “called up” to Stadium Court, where Nick spent his days teaching a select few players. I remember my first time was nerve-racking. Nick was the guy who was footing the bill for me, investing in my future with no back-end participation clause. I desperately wanted to impress him and show him he had made the right decision, and I was going to be a great ambassador for the Bollettieri Academy—a star on his team. When I got to Stadium Court I could barely hit a ball on the strings. He stopped the practice, pulled me aside and told me to forget where I was and to “just concentrate on hitting the damn ball.” “It doesn’t matter who’s watching you,” he said. “The ball doesn’t care if I am here or not. Just do what you know how to do.” That seems like simple advice, right? For me it was like a door opened. Suddenly, I was freed up, swinging and playing my best tennis. I’ve carried that memory with me whenever I’ve gotten into situations where I’m under pressure and start to doubt myself. “Just do what you know how to do” can be transferred to many areas of life—pubic speaking, business meetings, etc. It’s one of the great gifts Nick has given to me and countless others. At the same time, Nick custom fits his advice to each player from a strategic and technical standpoint. Most other coaches operate with a cookie-cutter philosophy, insisting their players all play the same way. He’s coached Monica Seles, Andre Agassi, Maria Sharapova, Serena Williams—the list goes on forever seemingly—and each of those players has a different grip, swing and style; yet they’re all Bollettieri protégés. My own grips and swings will never be found in a\n\n13\n\nNick Bollettieri textbook on tennis, and a few of my earlier coaches tried to correct them (although not successfully because I resisted). Nick saw what my limitations were (the extreme western grip of my forehand and my baseball swing backhand), and he built my game around maximizing my strengths (serve and forehand) and protecting my weakness (backhand) in order to give me the best chance for success. Has Nick been proven right with this philosophy for his players? Just check the numbers. He’s had 10 No. 1 ranked players in the world, and countless others who have been in the top 10 during his career. Case closed. Nick is an incredibly generous man. Millions of Nick’s dollars— and the dollars of several of his generous friends—made it possible for people like me to pursue our dream and come to the best place in the world to try and be a professional tennis player. He literally fed, housed, and coached many of us out of his own pocket, and for that I will forever be thankful. In 1987 he raised about $200,000 to pay for a traveling team of eight young amateurs to get additional experience and test the waters in regards to our future. I was fortunate enough to be a part of that, to travel the world with his coaches (his son Jimmy was my primary coach on the team) and to see if we were good enough to turn pro or if we should go to college instead for more seasoning. After six months I had played well enough to turn pro, and Nick promptly assigned another coach to travel with me, at his cost, on the tour. He never asked for a penny in return. There’s a lot to admire about Nick. One of the things I admire most about him is his passion for everything he does. He loves what he does and that energy is infectious. Nick has used his passion and commitment to change the sport of tennis. But more importantly, he has changed thousands of lives for the better. I am lucky enough to be living proof of it. And to me, that is his real legacy.\n\n14\n\nChanging the Game\n\nJim Courier is a former World No. 1 professional tennis player, holder of four Grand Slam singles titles, is a well respected tennis commentator and a leader on the Senior Tour.\n\n15\n\n16\n\nINTRODUCTION Quite often, articles and commentators talk about me as the greatest tennis coach ever, but I feel somewhat out of place being named the best when there are so many other coaches who have contributed greatly to the game of tennis, including Robert Lansdorp, Harry Hopman, Vic Braden, John Wilkeson, Dr. Robert Johnson, Richard Williams, Paul Annacone, Bob Brett, Rick Macci, Brad Gilbert, Niki Pilic, Dick Gould, Dennis Van Der Meer, Welby Van Horn and Steve Wilkinson, to name a few. I would, however, accept being named the best-ever crazy tennis coach who went in a totally different direction in the development of players. I started the first stand-alone academy where youngsters received intense professional training. I encouraged them to turn pro earlier, in many cases before they graduated high school. I emphasized the power game in tennis with the Bollettieri killer forehand, the sonic serve and the ballistic backhand long before they became the norm. Being something of a cowboy and pioneer has made me a controversial figure at times, and I have welcomed the occasional hullabaloo surrounding my approach. Yes, I am an entrepreneur and promoter, but if I had not done what I did, my chances of any success would have been much lower. Writing this autobiography has allowed me to reflect not only on what I have achieved so far, but also brought to my attention the influence of others and the wisdom they implanted in me, notably my grandmother, my grandfather and my parents. Along with my stint in the Army, they taught me to have courage, believe in myself and that I could do what I set my mind to, and never think that failure along the way meant that I made a poor decision.\n\n17\n\nNick Bollettieri Many would say that I have lived an expansive, sprawling life, big as Mount Rushmore; and they may be right. Myself, I would say I’ve lived a heck of a life! I have had the opportunity to coach some of the best tennis players in the world and to introduce tennis to some of the neediest neighborhoods in America. I have met and worked with well-known, famous and wealthy people, and people from ordinary walks of life. Many of them have become good friends, have gone to bat for me in times of crisis and difficulties, and helped in any way they could. Along the way, I have owned fancy cars and beautiful homes. And I have had several girlfriends and been married eight times, becoming the proud father of five children, two adopted children and grandfather of four. There are plenty of other stories, too—some of them laced with life’s lessons, others just crazy and fun. I will leave you to judge what they all add up to, although I can assure you I’m not finished yet. I’m just warming up! One of the things I have learned on my journey is that I have been blessed with a unique gift for coaching, motivating and developing players and young people of all kinds of backgrounds and talent. I also know that without the help of numerous others—my friends, sponsors, supporters and my coaches and longtime staff at the Academy—I could not have accomplished all I did and would not be where I am today. I am eternally grateful to them, and this book is a way of saying “Thank you, danke, merci, grazie, arigato, doh je, spasibo, gracias…” If my example can help inspire others to pursue uncharted courses and crazy paths to realize their dreams, I have done my job. If my storied journey can help others to realize that everything is possible and that, despite occasional setbacks, life can be filled with fun, laughter, excitement and success for everyone, no one will be more pleased than me.\n\n18\n\nChanging the Game I know it can be done. I have lived it. So fasten your seatbelts and prepare for takeoff! This is a “we-can-do-it” story! Nick Bollettieri\n\nBradenton 2014\n\n19\n\nMe at age three in front of our home on the Fourth of July.\n\n20\n\nCHAPTER 1 My Beginnings I was born in 1931 in my grandmother’s house in a village about 30 minutes outside of New York City that was called North Pelham at the time. It was a natural birth, but I’ve been told that it wasn’t an easy delivery. Guess I started out as a bit of a challenge, and I’m damn sure I’ll go out the same way. My sister Rita told me that I was born early in the morning, and I think my natural habit of being an early riser is due to that delivery time. To this day, I am up at 5:45 a.m. I do my stretching and 50 sit-ups, work out with light weights at the gym or my “office” at IMG Academy—it used to be an old metal desk next to one of the courts at the indoor tennis center, but my staff recently surprised me with a new one—and begin my duties at 7. I don’t eat breakfast, but I always seem to have energy to burn. My grandmother’s two-story house was large enough to accommodate both of our families. The DeFillipos, on my mother’s side, lived on the ground floor and we, the Bollettieris—my father, mother, older sister, younger brother and I—lived upstairs. It was tight quarters on the top floor. We all shared three bedrooms—my brother and I doubled up—and one small bathroom. Imagine five people maneuvering around each other in the morning before school and work. By today’s standards, it would seem impossible, but back then, families managed. The DeFillipo house was situated on a large, two-acre lot, and every inch was covered with flowers, grapevines, a vegetable garden, a chicken house and fig trees. I was responsible for collecting eggs from the chicken coop each morning. Grandpa would make his homemade wine the old-fashioned way—in our basement. The 21\n\nNick Bollettieri entire family crushed the grapes by jumping up and down on them in bare feet. Because of my diminutive size and because I was the youngest, I was allowed a little leeway growing up. No one ever told me to be quiet, and my friends will tell you I haven’t stopped talking to this day. We were one big happy family, both upstairs and downstairs, but make no mistake—the entire house, from the wine cellar to the attic, was ruled by Grandma DeFillipo. Every night, all 12 of us sat down to eat together at the table in her kitchen. Except Grandma; she never sat. She was busy serving the different pastas, meatballs, sausages, bread and salads. Grandma never asked us what we wanted; she simply made the selections for us. Salad always came with the main meal, never before. Things would get going when Grandpa tipped a bottle of his homemade wine above The DeFillipo-Bollettieri house. his mouth and let the red liquid flow. At that point, we ate. And Grandma kept filling the plates. If any food dropped to the floor, she would point to it, pick it up, make the sign of the cross and put it back on our plate; and we ate it. No one in the household could smoke, though my mom and dad would sneak out to the open sun porch to get in a few puffs. Did I say no one could smoke? During dinner, Grandpa DeFillipo would always light up one of his five-inch guinea stinkers. The fumes would drift upstairs, downstairs and even to the cellar, but no one ever said a word about it.\n\n22\n\nChanging the Game When we were done, Grandma would take whatever was left over on the plates and the kitchen counter, and in the pots and pans, and pile it all into a huge pot. The next day, she would serve it as her most recent concoction, saying “mangia;” and we ate. No matter how it tasted, we would tell her it was good. Believe it or not, my grandma would keep feeding me and say, “Sonny, God is looking at you, keep eating.” I’m told that when I was a baby I became so fat that I did very little walking until I was almost 18 months old! My mother, Mary, was one of a long line of Marys in my family. She was a traditional Italian, stay-at-home mom who put all her time and energy into taking care of the family. She lived for others, worried a lot and never spent money on herself. She wore the same apron and dress all week long. After her death, we found birthday and Christmas presents she’d put away in the attic over the course of 20 years—all of them unopened! For as long as I can remember, she gave me three pieces of advice: “Save your money.” “Eat.” And, “Stay with the family.” She repeated them to me often, even later on in life, probably because I only followed the second one. Mom was a stickler for neatness. She didn’t tolerate unmade beds, clothes on the floor or messy closets. She didn’t get involved in our sports activities or schoolwork, leaving them to Dad. But she saw it as her personal responsibility to make sure all of us left the house in clothes that were clean and ironed. In an effort to save money, she and my grandmother would wash the family clothes by hand and hang them in the backyard on the clothesline to dry. Not only was this economical, but Mom loved the way the clothes smelled when allowed to dry in the fresh, clean outdoor air. This was a common practice in suburban communities and was also a regular sight in apartment buildings in the big cities, until residents complained and the management companies no longer permitted it. But in our home, the practice continued. It made for a great place to play hide and seek, though Mom got annoyed if she caught us.\n\n23\n\nNick Bollettieri Of course, wintertime was another matter. Then Mom would dry the clothes on a line in the basement of our home. It took a bit longer, as there were no breezes, but it still saved the cost of buying and operating an electric dryer. At the time, we never imagined how that common, penny-wise practice would lead to a tremendous loss for the entire family. In many ways, my dad and mom were polar opposites. He always looked on the bright side of things and knew how to enjoy himself. Handsome and flamboyant, he was meticulous about his clothes and his cars. He also was smart and had been an excellent student at New Rochelle High School. Somehow, Grandma and Grandpa Bollettieri saved enough money from their butcher shop to send him to Fordham University in New York City. He excelled there, too, and graduated at age 21 with a degree in chemistry and became a pharmacist. When he married my mom, they moved into Grandma DeFillipo’s house, which is why he opened his own drugstore on 5th Avenue and Lincoln Avenue in North Pelham. It was directly across the street from The Bollettieri home. the fire station. A few years later, he became fire chief. He had political aspirations and ran for mayor, but lost by one vote. Dad wrote and spoke his parents’ native language fluently. I’ve been accused of speaking four languages—Italian, Spanish, English and with my hands—but I’ve never had difficulty getting my point\n\n24\n\nChanging the Game across. At the tennis academy, my approach has helped me communicate with its many foreign students. In my dad’s case, being bilingual allowed him to help many of our Italian neighbors who didn’t speak English with their income tax filings—at no charge, of course. In fact, he helped everybody in whatever way he could. Everyone in our little town knew everyone else and many of the residents came to my dad’s drugstore. It seems that most had charge accounts, and he didn’t want to take legal steps to collect the money owed to him. It wasn’t long before my dad went bankrupt. Unfortunately, I think his lack of smarts regarding finances rubbed off on me. I certainly inherited his giving and trusting genes when it comes to being generous and seeing the best in others, as well as his ability to bounce back from failures and try again. He never stopped striving to improve himself. After he lost his pharmacy, he managed to achieve high positions with the Winthrop Chemical Company and later moved to Bala Cynwyd, north of Philadelphia, to become vice president of Baxter Laboratories, which manufactured medical devices and pharmaceuticals. My sister Rita was a few years older than me and was an excellent student. Many thought she would become a doctor, but in the end she became an outstanding nurse. I really don’t remember much about her until she was much older. She was married twice and had a son, Phillip, and a daughter, Mary Lou. Rita and I didn’t have much to do with one another because we lived far apart most of our lives, but we stayed in touch. My parents willed all their money to Rita—they feared my wife at the time would get her hands on it!—which was probably the right thing to do. By then, I had already experienced a few divorces. Actually, Rita played another important role in my life. Like my mom, she was a “glass-half-empty” type of person who worried about everything, and it was obvious to me that it affected the quality of her life. I vowed to take the opposite point of view, which was one of\n\n25\n\nNick Bollettieri the best decisions I ever made and taught me early on the power of positive thinking. My brother, James Thomas Bollettieri—Jimmy Boy, as we called him—was a kind and gentle soul. Although we shared the same room, we got along well. It didn’t hurt that he idolized his older brother! He loved learning and spent all his free time with his nose in a book. While I was out playing sports, Jimmy Boy was reading. He was so bright that by the age of 14, he skipped two grades ahead in school! He wanted to be a doctor, and I’m sure he would have been a successful one—maybe a brain surgeon—but God had other plans for him. When my grandparents came to the United States from Naples, Italy, they settled in two adjoining New York suburbs—the Bollettieris in New Rochelle, a mostly Italian community, and the DeFillipos in North Pelham, a middle-class town comprised mostly of African-Americans, Italians and Irish. The neighborhoods were all one happy family, a true melting pot. We met on the streets, mingled in school, played sports together and we all got along. The fire department and police force were integrated, too. Several of my uncles were cops. It made no difference what color, religion or ethnic background you were, and I grew up without prejudice toward anyone. Again, my father set the tone. When I spent time in his pharmacy, I’d see him treat all of his customers with equal respect. In those days, parents never seemed to worry if their kids were safe. We walked everywhere, to grammar school about two miles away, and later on, to Pelham Memorial High School, an even farther distance on the rich side of town. We were seldom concerned with drugs, bullying or violence. One time, though, I came home from grade school crying. My uncles asked me what happened. When I said that a big boy beat me up, they were furious. They told me exactly what to do the next day: “Walk up to the big boy and punch him right on his nose—and then run as fast as you can.” I did! In fact, I’m still running.\n\n26\n\nChanging the Game The neighborhood was filled with kids and we were given our freedom. Every day when I got back from school, Grandma DeFillipo would look at my knickers. (For you youngsters, I don’t mean Snickers. Knickers, short for knickerbockers, were baggy pants that fell just below the knees.) If mine were the slightest bit dirty at the knees, Grandma would smile because she knew I had been playing marbles on the side of the road. If there was no dirt, she knew I was wandering about—and that was a no-no. She would give me a smack and say, “Sonny, go and play and be a good boy.” At dinnertime, Grandma would go to the front door and yell, “Sonny, come home!” If I didn’t hear her, a few of my friends would find me and deliver the message. All my friends were terrified of Grandma. Before my father opened his pharmacy, the Bollettieri family’s popularity was due largely to my grandfather, who had a super-duper butcher shop in New Rochelle. He carried all the meats that Italian mothers would use to prepare the family meals. In addition to a variety of pastas, he also had a selection of meatballs, sausages and other delicacies. Directly across the street from the butcher shop was the original Bollettieri home. In later years, the family moved to North Pelham on 9th Avenue, right up the street from Grandma DeFillipo’s house on 6th Street, and when my parents got married, they moved in upstairs. Back in those days, family togetherness was everything. During the month of June, Dad would take vacation and Mom would prepare food, drinks and umbrellas for our weekend trips to Orchard Beach, only a few miles away. Sometimes we would brave the much longer journey to Jones Beach on Long Island, which had lots of crashing waves. This was always my favorite jaunt because I got a chance to surf, which is one of my most enjoyable pastimes. I turn 83 in 2014 and I still surf every chance I get, especially with my sons Jimmy Boy (named after my brother), nine-year-old Giovanni and six-year-old Giacomo.\n\n27\n\nNick Bollettieri Another of my fond recollections was our Saturday night visits to the amusement park in White Plains, which was about 10 miles away. I remember asking Grandpa to go on the roller coaster with us once. We assured him that it would go slow and when it reached the top of the track, he would be able to see the entire park. He had no idea what to expect. As the wagon climbed the long incline at the start, all our eyes were on him. At the very top, he enjoyed the panoramic view of the park for a split second before we raced down the other side at 60 miles per hour. I can still hear him yelling, “Rallenta! Rallenta!” (Slow down! Slow down!) We all thought this was hysterical, but let me tell you, at the end of the ride we ran like bandits. Mom finally calmed him down and by the weekend meal he proudly told the entire family about his ride. Throughout my youth, I was something of a hustler. I would get candy and ice cream from my father’s drugstore and give it to my friends. Sometimes, I’d sell it to them. I probably contributed to him going bankrupt. There was a black lady living nearby who had beautiful dahlias in her garden. I’d steal them and sell them back to her. She knew that I had taken them, but bought them anyway. I had a lemonade stand, too. Later on I caddied, washed cars and worked as a lifeguard. I loved being outdoors and getting a tan. But all I ever really wanted to do was play sports. Touch football on a dead-end street, king of the mountain, ice skating on a nearby frozen lake or sledding down hilly streets—I lived for sports. My uncles on the DeFillipo side—Charlie, Tony, Joseph and Michael—were all big guys and outstanding football and basketball players (many of them received athletic scholarships to college), and they would often play tag football with me. I would be the quarterback and over a period of time developed confidence that I could deliver the ball to the receiver. When I entered high school, I was introduced to Coach Schilling, the football coach who was there when my uncles played for the team. I became captain of the team in my senior year.\n\n28\n\nChanging the Game There were actually three Pelhams back then: North Pelham, Pelham Heights and Pelham Manor, where the cream of the crop lived. When I got to high school, I found a way to spend time in Pelham Manor by dating girls from that part of town. One in particular, Bobbie, was my dancing partner at socials. She ended up marrying Alan Holton, who was on the football team with me and is a super-nice guy. They live in Boca Raton, Florida, now, and I always see them at the Sony Tennis Tournament. They subscribe to the philosophy that “marriage is a onetime deal— forever.” My philosophy, as it turned out, was quite different! During the summer months, I would spend a good deal of time at the Hampshire Country Club in Mamaroneck, New York, another upscale community. My cousin was the caddie master there, and that connection allowed me to make good money as a caddie and valet park attendant. I would also act as a server at the big parties that the club occasionally hosted. My uncle, John Lightfoot, Pelham Memorial High School. had married my Aunt Rose DeFillipo; he was well-to-do and a member of a tennis club in New Rochelle. The Hampshire Country Club was closed on Mondays and one day he asked me to join him at his tennis club. He was one of the best players there and his opponent hadn’t shown up, so he asked me to hit balls with him. I said, “Are you kidding? Tennis is a sissy sport!” But I obliged him, and I had no idea what I was doing; I chased the balls around, trying to hit them back any which way I could. I was\n\n29\n\nNick Bollettieri almost too embarrassed to admit that I had had a great time and ask if I could play more often with him. That was my sophomore year in high school, and even though I didn’t go out for high school tennis, I continued playing with my uncle from time to time. By senior year, he encouraged me to try out for the tennis team when I got to college, and I did! I was a weak student, academically. This was not because I wasn’t bright enough to master the subjects, but because I couldn’t relate them to any plans for the future. I had no idea what I wanted to do, I just knew it had to be something big and exciting, so I couldn’t get my heart into the schoolwork and was a persistent underachiever. As one of my teachers commented, “Nick’s attention span is all over the place. When he applies himself, he ranks among the best of my students, but he falls short of his capacity.” In biology class, for example, I didn’t know one end of a frog from another, but I noticed that whenever the teacher—she stood 5’ 1” on tiptoe—looked at someone and he or she looked away, she’d call on them. So when she looked at me, I always gave her a big smile, and she never called on me! That ability to observe habits and ways of behavior in others has served me well throughout my career coaching players, for whom a slight adjustment in grip or stance can make a huge difference in performance. During my senior year in high school, my parents bought a new house on Lincoln Avenue and Young Avenue. It was a bit larger, but still in the same neighborhood, and we moved there to have more room to ourselves. My dad also bought himself a new car—a sleek, green Buick Riviera. Sixty-five years later, I can still see it in my mind, sitting proudly in our driveway. One particular day is imprinted on my memory as if it were yesterday. There had been a morning snow, but by afternoon it had melted. My closest friend, Richie Daronco, came by to see me and, as we were talking, my dad surprised me by handing me the keys to his new Buick. “Take it for a spin and let me know what you think,” he said.\n\n30\n\nChanging the Game Richie and I looked at each other and away we went. We drove to the next town where my girlfriend, Joanie Langbein, attended New Rochelle High School. I was excited to show off the new car, but as we arrived I spotted her getting into a four-door convertible with another girl and two boys. I said to Richie, “What the heck is going on?” and stepped on the accelerator to catch up to them. By then it was late in the afternoon and little did I know that the melted show had turned into slippery ice. When I took a turn too fast, I lost control and the car slid up on the lawn of a house that had huge rocks spread throughout the front yard. BANG! I said, “Holy sh*t!” and we got out to assess the damage. We had smashed the passenger door. A lady came out of the house and waved at us, but we jumped back in the car, took off and just kept going. I quickly made up a tale about us watching a basketball game at the high school and when we came out, we saw the car all banged up. Richie looked at me with his eyes as big as snowballs. I told him not to worry, just stick to our story. When we got home my dad was standing on the porch of our new house. He asked, “So, how do you like the new car?” I said, “Dad, I love the car, but you’ll never believe what happened!” As I continued to talk, Dad moved closer to me, and Richie moved further away. When I had finished, Dad asked me to repeat my story. Before I could complete the first sentence—Pow!—he popped me for the first and last time in my life. Then he delivered a memorable message, “When you have to make up a story, at some point it’ll catch up with you and the truth will come out. So no matter what—always tell the truth right off the bat and accept the consequences!” I was as stunned by the unexpected blow as by the realization that he knew exactly what had happened. How could he have known? Well, I later learned that the lady who’d waved after us wrote down my license plate number and called the New Rochelle police, who tracked down the owner’s name. She then called the North Pelham\n\n31\n\nNick Bollettieri police station where three of my uncles were cops! They loved me, but had no choice but to tell my father. Dad fixed the car; I decided not to continue my relationship with Joanie—and I didn’t marry her! (Too bad I didn’t follow that path throughout my life!) And I never let Richie forget that he set a world record in the long jump when he leapt down the six steps to our new house and took off! He later was appointed by President Reagan as a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In 1988, two days after he dismissed a sex discrimination suit filed by a young woman, her father shot him to death at his house in Pelham. I was at the French Open at the time, so I couldn’t attend his funeral. I was shocked and saddened by the news; Richie was only 56 years old. Still, the Buick Riviera experience is a fond memory of better times with a good friend, and it delivered an important life lesson about telling the truth (well, maybe not always the whole truth). It also offers a revealing insight into my dad’s character and values, which I have built on, hoping that I would one day possess the same characteristics and be admired by my own children. I know that he’s smiling down on me as I follow in his footsteps.\n\n32\n\nChanging the Game\n\nOn the steps of the DeFillipo-Bollettieri house during a recent visit.\n\n33\n\nI went to college with Nick and graduated with him in 1953. During that time we became close friends and have remained so for over 50 years...I would not be alive today but for Nick’s intervention and salesmanship. It was my freshman year and the Korean War was just starting up. I had Father John O’Keefe as my professor in the first philosophy course I took in college. I flunked the final exam and won my way out of college, so I decided to go back to Milwaukee and join the Marine Corps. Nick said, “Baloney. Let me talk to Father O’Keefe.” He went to his office, told him that he and many of his classmates were interested in keeping me in school, and that it would require Father O’Keefe to lose the exam and give me a passing grade. Well, I wound up with an 83 on my report card and stayed in school. Two of my high school classmates joined the Marines. One came back from Korea with a steel plate in his head and had to learn to speak all over again, and the other came home in a box and I was one of his pallbearers. So there is no doubt in my mind that I would not have lived past 1950 without Nick’s intervention. He saved my life and that allowed me to finish college, do my time in the service, get married and have three kids and eight grandchildren and live a wonderful life. —Jerry P. O’Leary, Sr., Potomac, Maryland\n\n34\n\nCHAPTER 2 College and the Army Even though I was a pretty darn good quarterback and might have played on a few small college teams, my dad had other ideas. At Fordham University, his professors were Jesuit priests who valued learning, and he wanted me to have a good Catholic education, too. He became good friends with Father Colkin who, among other duties, was in charge of intramural sports. In one of their conversations, Father Colkin mentioned that he was being transferred to Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama, a small school of only 1,500 students. He was going to be the athletic director there and promised my dad that if he sent me to Spring Hill, he would make sure I took part in the sports activities, although they only had intramural football. Dad thought that would be perfect for me. I was surprised that he insisted on driving me himself from New York to Mobile—I figured he would just put me on a plane. I didn’t know what to expect, but when we arrived and drove down the long entrance road lined with beautiful azalea bushes to the administration building, I noticed that the men there were all dressed in black with white collars. When I asked my father who they were, it finally became clear why he’d driven me there himself. They were priests and lay brothers, and they would be my teachers. Jesuits—what a surprise! I didn’t say much, but as time passed I found out how to sway them, and most of the time, I got things my way. I majored in Spanish. Mr. Cuen, my language teacher, wasn’t a priest and had a large family whose health he worried about. By then, 35\n\nNick Bollettieri my dad was working for the pharmaceutical company, and so I had him send down some special vitamins to give to Mr. Cuen, which he appreciated. When the time came for the final, I told him I wasn’t prepared for it. I asked if I could just put down what I knew, and he could grade me on that? He agreed and I managed to squeak by. The philosophy teacher, Father O’Keefe, liked to tipple, and taking him out for a glass of wine from time to time did wonders for my grades! By the time I was an upperclassman, I basically ran the whole college. Every important student activity went through me. I organized everyone’s social lives, setting my friends up with dates, pulling off pranks and hazing freshmen who were too full of themselves. As in high school, I made no big academic splash, managing to get by in my classes while concentrating on ROTC and sports. I participated in intramural football and, following my Uncle John’s advice, went out for the tennis team and played both singles and doubles for the next four years. Although I had fun, I knew I had no special talent for the sport and had no plans to do anything with it in the future. Wow! What a turnabout!\n\nI include this photo (me, lower right) to prove to John McEnroe and Jim Martz that I did play tennis before opening my Academy. In fact, this photo of my collegiate tennis team was taken about five years before John was born.\n\n36\n\nChanging the Game I don’t know if I could have stayed in one place for four years if we didn’t have a lot of fun along the way. One weekend a buddy of mine and I drove his car to Miami. Coming back, we loaded up with bags of grapefruit and oranges. It was foggy and when we reached a place where the road diverged, we drove straight on, right through the billboard in the middle of the fork. Luckily, we were okay, just a little banged up. My friend’s insurance company made a settlement, and everyone at school loved both the story and eating the tropical fruit, bruises and all. My college years would have made for a happy-go-lucky, allAmerican experience if it hadn’t been for a tragic event that befell my family. You always hear about terrible accidents that happen to others, but you never think it will happen to you, and then one day, it hits home with a vengeance. In my case, it occurred when I was 19, the winter of my sophomore year. I was making one of my rare visits to the campus library—I considered it sort of out of bounds and preferred to spend my time with my “underbosses” planning social activities. I can still remember looking up from my textbook to see Father O’Keefe walking towards me. He had such a serious expression I figured I must be in big trouble. But then he sat down next to me, sighed and told me that my younger brother was dead. Remember the clothes my mom would hang up to dry in the basement? Apparently, Jimmy Boy was on his way down there and tripped, fell down the stairs and hung himself in the clothesline. He had just had breakfast, and as the line cut across his throat, he vomited and choked on his food. I was stunned. I hardly heard Father O’Keefe assuring me that it was all part of God’s divine wisdom and that God had big plans for my brother. On my flight from Mobile to New York, I was in a daze. I went directly to the funeral home. When I saw my brother lying in the coffin with nothing but kindness written across his innocent face, a wave of hopeless sadness washed over me, and I sobbed\n\n37\n\nNick Bollettieri uncontrollably. It still happens sometimes, even today, almost 65 years later. It was by far the most traumatic event that I’ve ever experienced. Sure, parents we love pass on and we miss them. But parents are supposed to die before their children. It’s the “way” of things. So many people say that time will heal everything, but whenever I think of Jimmy Boy today, tears come to my eyes and I wish that he could be here as part of my life and career. I think about what magnificent feats he might have accomplished, had he survived. My parents never got over his loss either. Even now, I can’t figure out why he was taken so soon. My only hope is that Jimmy Boy can look down, smile and say, “Big Brother Nick, I’m still proud of you!” I returned to Spring Hill with a heavy heart, vowing to make something of myself, to make my life matter. By my senior year, I decided that I wanted to become a Navy fighter pilot. So in May of 1953, I traveled to New Orleans to take the exam for the Naval Air Corps. I passed the physical part of the test, but didn’t do so well on the written part. I was deeply disappointed not to be able to pursue my dream. I haven’t had many regrets in life, but for more than 40 years I couldn’t look up at a plane flying overhead without wishing I was My college yearbook picture. the pilot. But life goes on, and upon my college graduation, I received a second lieutenant commission from the ROTC and was assigned to the Army’s Transportation Corps at Fort Story near Norfolk, Virginia. On weekends off, I would travel to Virginia Beach, Virginia for fun and relaxation and to have a few drinks. It was on the Fourth of July in 1953 that I met a girl named Phyllis Johnson. She and\n\n38\n\nChanging the Game her sister Shirley were at a club called The Casino on the boardwalk. They were originally from Roanoke and had come east for greater opportunities than a small, sleepy town in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains offered. Phyllis worked as a lab technician for an orthodontist and loved to dance. We both did. That night, we boogied with each other for more than two hours. It got late and as they were leaving, I asked where they normally went to go swimming. Phyllis said at the beach by the Coast Guard building. From then on, whenever I had time off and on weekends, Phyllis and I would go surfing there on rented boogie boards. Because I was not happy in the Transportation Corps, I volunteered Second lieutenant, Nick Bollettieri. to become a paratrooper and began my jump training in Fort Benning, Georgia. Some of my friends kidded me that I only did it for the dough—we got an extra $150 per jump, a lot of money at the time. But there was more to it. Many of my buddies dropped out when they weren’t able to keep up with the mental and physical demands, and the total commitment required to succeed in an elite unit. Each member of the team had to be exceptional. Excuses were not tolerated and being content with second place, even if you did the best you could, wasn’t acceptable. I can still remember when our drill sergeant said “give me 10,” meaning 10 push-ups, and we had to take a two-second pause between each rep. This made it increasingly difficult to perform the exercise and ridiculously difficult to handle the next 10 push-ups that he would be\n\n39\n\nNick Bollettieri demanding. About 50 yards away from the regular training ground was a muddy stretch of territory, and that’s where the sergeant had us do our push-ups. He knew that most of us would not succeed and end up face-first in the mud. His mission was to find out who among us would throw in the towel and quit, and who could deal with the adversity! Before going further, let me explain my attitude about the paratroopers. I volunteered because I thought the training would allow me to be with others who aspired to be exceptional—gung-ho individuals who had the same outlook that I had. Yes, the training was insanely difficult, and many participants decided that they had made a poor choice and quit. As for me, sometime during the six-week training program, I realized that we were being pushed to be leaders and to accomplish what others felt couldn’t be done. This was another important life lesson for me: Only a few, determined individuals possess the resolve and focus to become the best at anything; and I wanted to be one of them. Sure, we worked our butts off every day, 24-7, but it was fulfilling our dreams of becoming paratroopers, to achieve something special. That kind of determination and pride of accomplishment motivates me to this day. I made it through the six weeks of rigorous training (and would later employ similar tactics at my tennis academy), graduated jump school and earned my paratrooper wings. I was now Second Lieutenant Nicholas J. Bollettieri 04003116 in the 187th Airborne at Fort Campbell in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. Besides our military duties, we also played football. Our team was a highly competitive outfit as we competed against teams from other bases. Having been the quarterback in high school and college, I felt that I was fairly good at leading the team. It was a lot of fun, especially when the cheerleaders and pretty girls came to watch us play. Unfortunately, the good times didn’t last very long. One afternoon, I was late returning from off base for a football practice. I had a beautiful, souped up, yellow and green Ford con-\n\n40\n\nChanging the Game vertible that my dad had given me when I graduated from college. You guessed it: In my rush to get back on time, I sped along and was stopped by a state trooper who clocked me doing over 100 mph. I guess I wanted to be a fighter pilot so badly that going that fast in a car was as close as I could get to flying. The incident was turned over to the military police and because I was an officer, referred to the commanding general, General Smith. He reamed me out for being so reckless (as if jumping out of a plane at 10,000 feet were a common, rational act) and said that I was guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer. For punishment, he gave me an Article 15 citing, ordering me to be reassigned to Japan. Fortunately, one of my innate gifts is to extract the positive out of difficult circumstances. I actually looked forward to spending the remainder of my military career in Japan. The Korean War was over. How bad could it be? So I drove my car to my parents’ home, which at this point was in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. My dad asked if there was anything he could do for me before I left for San Francisco, my port of departure. I didn’t think so. All the while, we had never told Mom that I had been jumping out of airplanes for the past several months. We knew her nerves would have gone haywire at the thought. We also spared her the news that I had been reassigned as a punishment. We led her to believe that the government was providing me with the opportunity to travel and see exotic parts of the world. As I traveled to the west coast to get ready for my departure to Japan, I began thinking about Phyllis. I called her up and we talked for a few minutes. Finally, I asked if she would visit with me before I left for Asia. She laughed and said, “Nicky, you’re as crazy as a bed bug!” Not being a guy who takes no for an answer, I asked again a few more times and got the same response. Finally, I gave up and we parted on good terms. On the day before my departure, an announcement came over the speaker system at the base in San Francisco: Will Second Lieutenant\n\n41\n\nNick Bollettieri Nicholas Bollettieri please report to the orderly room? I thought for sure that I had managed to get into trouble again and spent the time on my way to the orderly room trying to figure out what rule I might have violated. When I finally got there, imagine my surprise to find Phyllis waiting for me. She had apparently changed her mind about traveling across the country for a visit. I proposed to her on the spot, and we were married in the base chapel a few hours before I left for Asia on September 15, 1954. Fortunately for us, Phyllis had thought to pack a wedding gown in her suitcase and we went before a newly appointed judge who waived the typical three-day waiting period. Phyllis returned to Roanoke and I shipped out on the General Mitchell to Japan, where I was stationed in the city of Beppu on the island of Kyushu. With Mount Tsurumi and the Pacific Ocean as backdrops and warm weather, it was a tropical paradise, but a lonely place for a newlywed. Fortunately, Mom and Dad decided to send Phyllis over to spend time with me as a honeymoon and Christmas present to both of us. It was a wonderful time. We lived in a cottage off base, in a threehouse compound owned by a Japanese family. We even had a maid who would shine my boots to the point where I could see myself in them. Phyllis and I took in the famous hot springs in Beppu—hot steam rising from incredibly cobalt blue water—and went to Tokyo on weekends. We’d go shopping and to nightclubs where we put on dance shows to American big band jazz music, which was all the rage then. During that time, my son Jimmy Boy was conceived. The rest of my tour was uneventful, and we left Japan to return to the United States in the summer of the following year. We ended up at Fort Bragg in Fayetteville, where Jimmy Boy was born in a private doctor’s suite in June of 1955.\n\n42\n\nChanging the Game\n\nPhyllis visiting me and Jimmy Boy, who was taking a break from kitchen duty, at NBTA.\n\n43\n\nI’ve always been proud of the fact that I was one of Nick’s first students. As a junior I won many titles under Nick, including Junior Nationals, Orange Bowl and Sugar Bowl. The lessons taught me so many years ago have stayed with me throughout my life. Thanks to Nick I’ve enjoyed a life in tennis through teaching, coaching college, playing league tennis and having a wonderful social life...[and] he has remained a good friend through the years. When I was fighting stage 4 cancer, he made arrangements for me to go to the U.S. Open as his guest, something he knew I had always wanted to do. When I was in remission, he sent me a new tennis racquet as inspiration to get back on the tennis court. His friendship has meant a lot to me. I’ve been fortunate to see the real side of Nick, the softer side. —Sheryl Smith Craig, Saint Augustine, Florida\n\nI was falling into a rough crowd of guys that hung out in the late 50s around North Miami Beach, smoking, riding around in cars, causing trouble. I was also playing tennis at the time, and one night outside of the two old cement courts, Nick pulled me aside and pretty sternly said, “Either come here and continue with tennis, or go hang out with those thugs and don’t come back.” Well, I took his advice and it led to a pretty fortunate life that I have had through tennis and friendships with some great people. —Joe Szucs, Miami, Florida\n\n44\n\nCHAPTER 3 Learning the Ropes at Victory Park When I finished my military service, my dad called me to ask about my future plans. I didn’t really know what I wanted to do, so he suggested I become a lawyer. Throughout my early life, I always loved warm weather and being outdoors—going to the beach, riding the waves. So I asked if it was okay to enter the University of Miami law school in Coral Gables, Florida. I knew that Dad would be pleased because one of my mom’s brothers, Tony DeFillipo, lived in nearby North Miami Beach and could “keep an eye” on us. I had a wife, a nine-month-old son and a 1949 Plymouth; and with the cash from having sold my previous car and our personal belongings, we headed to Florida. Dad provided the additional money I needed and we bought the house right next door to my uncle Tony DeFillipo for $17,000. We got settled in, and I started law school in the fall of 1956. Although the G.I. Bill paid for my tuition, I needed to earn some money to take care of my family. Uncle Tony, besides owning the largest gas station and the biggest sanitation company in North Miami Beach, was very well connected politically in the community. One of his good friends was Frank Sepedi, the director of the city’s water department. My uncle knew I had played tennis in college, so he suggested that I offer tennis lessons at the two courts across the street from the city administration building and next to park administration, where the mayor and other politicians spent most of their time. Back then, it was a broken-down facility not much in use. Actually, “broken-down” 45\n\nNick Bollettieri is an understatement—the place was a wreck. The courts were best described as hard-grass-dirt: Hard, because they were made of concrete; grass, because lots of greenery was poking through the cracks in the playing surface; and dirt, because there was dirt everywhere. The nets, which were iron mesh to prevent theft, had holes in them. The facility had three amenities—an umbrella, a shell-and-brick wall and a Pepsi-Cola machine. Until then, my only experience with tennis had been batting the ball around in high school and playing in college, but I applied for the position of head pro and was awarded the contract at Victory Park in 1957. My “sponsors,” the local mafia, also made sure that I received a decent salary and a benefits package. Let me put my cards on the table: The only reason I got the job, knowing less than zero about teaching the game, was the influence wielded by Uncle Tony and Frank Sepedi. I would get up early, drive to law school for my classes, come home at 2:30 in the afternoon and My early coaching days. teach tennis until 8 or 9 at night. The law professors expected the students to dress properly—at least slacks and a collared shirt. I was going from school directly to the tennis courts and had other ideas. I had moved to Florida to wear shorts and a t-shirt, and so that is what I did. After a semester of listening to their constant complaints about my attire, I told the professors where they could put their books and quit law school for good. By then, I had decided to make a go of it as a tennis instructor. I sent Phyllis to “spy” on other programs in the Miami area and report\n\n46\n\nChanging the Game back to me what the instructors there were doing. When I went out to visit some of them myself, I was amazed at how easy it was to earn money teaching this sport. Most of the coaches used what seemed to me mindless, robotic techniques with their beginner students. The advice I heard repeatedly and most often was, “Put your palm on the face of the racquet and slide it down on the grip; shake hands with the racquet forming a “V” between your thumb and index finger on top of the racquet; ready position, racquet back early, step to the ball, hit the ball, catch the racquet with your non-hitting hand and back to the ready position.” I figured if they could do this and make $3.00 an hour, why couldn’t I? You didn’t need to be a good player, because to a beginner, perception is everything. If you look the part and speak with authority, they can’t tell the difference between a novice and a world-class instructor. Even if I was on a downward spiral from my earlier dreams of becoming a fighter pilot and my brief stints as a paratrooper and law school student, I was going to make the most of it. When I heard that Fred Perry lived in the area, I decided to pay him a visit. He was a tennis legend who won eight Grand Slam titles in the 1930s, including three consecutive Wimbledon championships—the last British player to win that tournament until Andy Murray did it again in 2013. I drove up in my yellow-green convertible to the Diplomat Hotel in Hollywood, Florida, where he was director of tennis, and introduced myself. He approved of my taste in cars, and we met several times after that socially, although we never talked about tennis. Fred Perry was a very flamboyant man and he always smiled when I arrived. His favorite piece of advice to me was, “Make sure you always have a good-looking woman with you.” I decided to use the experience at Victory Park to hone my teaching skills. I discovered that I had the innate ability and the compassion to genuinely help my students improve their tennis. For a while, I learned a lot from watching the best tennis coach in the area, Slim Harbett.\n\n47\n\nNick Bollettieri The grips, backswing, follow-through and other components were pretty uncomplicated, so I mimicked his techniques and language. But unknowingly, I began to add my own concepts and found that I was creating my own style. I began to evaluate technique and strategy and provide meaningful recommendations for improvement. No more teaching by the numbers. I wasn’t going to have my students look like soldiers parading at Buckingham Palace. Frank Sepedi and my uncle noticed the increase in activity at the tennis courts. When I mentioned that the facility needed to be upgraded to accommodate the growing numbers, Uncle Tony said, “Don’t worry about it, we’ll take care of it.” They hosted a picnic at Victory Park to impress the town administrators and offered free food and drink to whomever wanted to come. Believe me, the place was packed. As things got going, Uncle Tony and Frank came up to me and said, “Nick, when everything settles down, take the microphone and this is what you say, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, this is a big day in North Miami Beach. Mayor Diefenbach wants to announce the resurfacing of the two existing courts, construction of four additional courts, the installation of lighting and a new pro shop.’” I did as they told me, and the mayor was taken completely by surprise. When they joined him on the podium with a shovel, he shot them a look that would have turned lesser men to stone. A brief, quiet discussion ensued, and then the mayor announced that ground was being broken for the upgrading of the facility. He stuck the shovel in the dirt as a symbolic gesture to save face. I now had a six-court facility and my local reputation was spreading. I hope you all get the message. Italian names end in A, E, I, O and U. The “mafia” had done its work. Need I say more? I spent a lot of time and energy building up the programs at Victory Park. But like many hard-working young men, I also partied hard. Most evenings and weekends I hung out with my cousin Ken DeFillipo, who lived at my uncle’s next door, and his friends. We all\n\n48\n\nChanging the Game had a lot of fun carousing. To give you an idea of the kind of trouble we got into, one night in a lounge, we happened to see two guys and an attractive woman. The next night at our hotel, we saw them again. As they walked past, I glanced at her appreciatively, and one of the guys said, “What are you looking at?” Well, one word led to another, and we got into a fight. It didn’t last long. Kenny was 6’ 4”, played football for the University of Miami, had a brown belt in karate and took care of things. That’s how things went: I’d start the arguments and he would finish them! Later that evening when we returned to our hotel, as we entered the lobby, one of the guys came down the stairs. He pulled out a gun and said he would kill us both. I was mortified. While the night manager called the cops, Kenny walked up to the guy, said “You don’t have the balls,” and broke his nose. When the cops came, Kenny gave them Frank Sepedi’s number to call. They did, wished us “good night,” and we Getting ready to work on my tan. went on our way unscathed. I had a good time, but in the process, I did neglect my family too much. One night when I came home at 2 a.m., I found my packed bags sitting on the front porch with a note from Phyllis that read, “Nicky, I love you, but I can’t take this life any longer. I’ll miss you!” And that was the end of my first marriage. Phyllis was a kind soul, but she had taken about all she could handle from me, staying out at all hours of the night. She wanted to make sure I stayed in touch with my son as much as possible, and Jimmy Boy spent the summers with me when I ran tennis camps up north. In the meantime, Phyllis kept the house and I moved into an\n\n49\n\nNick Bollettieri apartment at the Sun City Motel on Collins Avenue by the beach, sharing two bedrooms with five other guys. I resumed my life as a hard-working, hard-playing bachelor. By 1960, the city of North Miami Beach began getting recognition from the United States Tennis Association (USTA). I was starting to develop some darn good players who were making waves on the national tennis scene. Sheryl Smith (now Sheryl Craig), one of my first four students, was the 14-and-under National Champion. Other outstanding players were George Shuert, Joe Szucs, Margie and Herb Cooper, and members of the Kantrovick family.\n\nFrom left: Lionel Standerd, guest, me, Sheryl Smith, Herb Lewis, my uncle Tony DeFillipo (in back), guest, unknown, Judge Balaban and Colonel Bannister. Abe Rebman, stooping, later replaced me at Victory Park.\n\nThe best player to come out of Victory Park was Brian Gottfried. He arrived at age 11 or so with huge ears and an even bigger champion’s heart. He did very well. In 1962, he won the national 12-andunder singles title. Before long, Brian came to train with me and travel with me during the summers. With only about five years separating them, he and Jimmy Boy became close friends, almost like brothers.\n\n50\n\nChanging the Game Brian was an extremely talented young man with determination, focus and a world-class volley. (And they said I couldn’t teach the volley.) He had an outstanding professional career, winning 25 singles and 54 doubles titles, reaching No. 3 in the world at some point and becoming the runner-up at the 1977 French Open.\n\nBrian Gottfried and me at Beaver Dam.\n\nWith the success of some of my young players, I began to gain some name recognition for myself in other parts of the country, too. In Springfield, Ohio, Dr. Howard Dredge, a dentist with a thriving practice and considerable influence in the community, was nuts about tennis and loved children. He wanted to help the kids in the city and directed a tennis program at two of Springfield’s tennis centers, Snyder and Reid Parks, free of charge. Somehow he heard about me and arranged for me to be interviewed to become tennis director for those parks from mid-April through September. I was delighted to get the job, because it was much too hot in Miami in the summer to spend any time on the tennis courts. Every Wednesday and Saturday during the summer, 1,500 children would use public transportation and make their way to Snyder Park. We made special arrangements with the bus company to provide\n\n51\n\nNick Bollettieri them with 25¢ fares. The best young players in the community (some were college students) helped me give lessons to these kids. We called them the “Leaders Club.” As a reward, the “leaders” received free winter instruction at the YMCA’s indoor gymnasium. My staff joined in and, with the assistance of local pro Gunnar Polte, ran the program for two years in 1961 and 1962.\n\n“Free Clinic Day!” in Springfield, Ohio.\n\nI did not stay there in the winter, but went back to Florida. When my marriage ended and I had wanted to move on, I became the tennis director at the Sahara Beach Hotel in Miami Beach. There were two Har-Tru courts across the street on Collins Avenue. Har-Tru is often called green or “American” clay, but it’s actually composed of crushed stones, which make it a little harder and faster than the red clay courts popular in Europe. The problem was that these courts had very little Har-Tru left on them. The hotel wasn’t ready to spend the money, and I didn’t have any extra after alimony and child support. Enter my cousin Kenny, who was already following in my uncle’s footsteps, solving problems\n\n52\n\nChanging the Game in a “creative” manner. He borrowed a pickup truck and late one night we cruised by another resort, the Hollywood Beach Hotel in the adjoining town. There were a number of 100-pound bags of HarTur lying by the sidewalk next to the tennis center—we thought they were garbage. Somehow, as if by magic—don’t ask me how—a few of them ended up in the bed of our truck, and the next day I had brand-new courts at the Sahara. Kenny, by the way, later became vice mayor of North Miami Beach! I can’t take credit for coaching Harold Solomon to success, but I did get him started at the Sahara Beach Hotel. One day, his father, Lenny, brought his young son “Solly” to meet me and get a tennis lesson. When we started, I noticed that Harold had his hands more under the racquet in a strong, semi-western grip. Although common today, it was odd at the time, but I didn’t change it at all, and it worked very well for him. He had a terrific professional career, winning 22 singles titles and ranking among the top 10 players in the world for five consecutive years. In 1976, he reached the finals of the French Open. Harold was a handsome kid, and in 1980, when he won 64 matches, Playgirl named him one of the 10 sexiest men of the year. That first and only lesson paid unexpected dividends. Lenny Solomon was a kind man who loved tennis. Years later, his daughter Shelly attended NBTA in Florida. At the time, we didn’t have a lot of extra room and needed a library, so Lenny had one built for us. Today, it houses the executive office and my Hall of Fame room at IMG Academy. Meanwhile, several notable juniors emerged from Springfield, Ohio, including Robin and Marmee Fry, Chuck Parsons and Ginger Pfeiffer, who was ranked No. 2 in the Western Tennis Association’s Girls’ 14 Division in 1962. The following year, she won the singles title of the American Tennis Association, the black version of the U.S. Tennis Association (USTA). Previous title holders included the\n\n53\n\nNick Bollettieri great Althea Gibson, the first African-American tennis player to win Wimbledon and the French Open (she had 11 Grand Slam victories altogether). Springfield also hosted the Boys’ 16 and 18 Western Conference Championships as a warm-up to the National Championships in Kalamazoo, Michigan. I coordinated the tournament and met a number of the best American teenage players there, including Bob Lutz, Marty Riessen, Stan Smith, Charlie Pasarell and Arthur Ashe. The latter two were to have important roles in my life and career. When Jimmy Boy first started spending his summers with me, he was only eight years old. He would climb on the seat in the red and silver public phone booth by the pro shop and call his mom every day, reversing the charges (which I would pay for later). In those days, calls still went through switchboards and telephone operators would make the connection by hand (you can see them plug in lines in movies from the 40s and 50s). On one occasion, when I made the call for Jimmy Boy, the operator, Nancy, started a conversation with me. She said that she often made the connection for us and knew I was the tennis director at Snyder Park. I thanked her for being so kind to my son and mentioned that we might meet one day and share a drink. She said that would be a good idea. We got together sooner rather than later and found that we enjoyed each other’s company… you can see where this is headed. The next winter, Nancy visited Miami on vacation. Nancy was a kind and generous person. She played tennis every day and we got along very well with one another. By the end of her stay, we decided to get married when I returned to Springfield in April. In the meantime, she went back there ahead of me, determined to make all the necessary arrangements for our wedding. A few weeks later, another attractive young lady from up north stopped in to play some tennis at the Sahara Beach Hotel. Her name was Shirley Phillips and we got along just fine. We danced the night\n\n54\n\nChanging the Game away and I told her all about my seasonal travel. She invited me to visit her in Franklin, a small town just south of Indianapolis, on my way to Springfield, and I did. We had a good time and she said she’d love to marry me. I said, “Okay,” and told her that I’d return in a week and we’d work out the details then. But when I got to Springfield, Nancy had all her wedding arrangements ready. So I married her the weekend I was scheduled to return to Franklin. Having stood Shirley up, I was almost afraid to travel to Indianapolis for years after!\n\n55\n\nIt all started some 50 years ago when I decided to seriously pursue the game of tennis at the highest level. I flew to Dorado Beach, Puerto Rico, in the early 70s where Nick was teaching. The minute I stepped on the court to take up the game, I felt like I was in seventh heaven. Nick practiced feisty, combative, unparalleled motivation to make you better; psychology par excellence; cutting-edge strategy and had the wisdom of a sage. I was treated to a clinic that dazzled my inner thoughts. And guess what? Over these past 50 years—including 35 years of state and regional competition—I delivered my two daughters and now four grandchildren to his tennis camps for personal instruction. Nick Bollettieri always delivers more than he promises. —Harvey Mackay, author and entrepreneur\n\nNick, a crazy Italian? You bet. But he is a generous person with a big heart and talent to match. He was extremely influential in helping to guide my three children, Harolyn, David and Michael in their early developing years. To me, he has always been a friend that was as true and loyal as a friend can be. —Nate Landow, longtime friend Nick is not only my friend, he is part of the Marx family. I have supported his crazy ideas because he made the ideas come true and has taken tennis to another level of excellence. We all LOVE him. —Louis Marx, longtime friend\n\n56\n\nCHAPTER 4 My Big Break One day at the Western Conference Championships in Springfield, a woman came into my pro shop and asked to borrow some tennis balls so that her son could practice his serve. When she brought them back, I refused to take payment for their use. A few weeks later, I received a call from RockResorts, the management company for the Dorado Beach Resort in Puerto Rico, which was owned by Laurance Rockefeller and his family. My name had been submitted on a long list of applicants for the head tennis pro position. Would I be interested in applying for the job? I was stunned. Of course I would! I didn’t have much of a name in tennis yet, so I didn’t think my chances were very good, but what did I have to lose? A few weeks later, to my surprise, I received a call telling me that I was among the final three applicants. At the U.S. Open, which in those days was held in Forest Hills, New York, I went into the pro shop and had a conversation with Eddie Moylan, the director of tennis, and a friend of mine, his assistant Bill Parks. They told me, “We just landed a plum job for next year— at Dorado. I didn’t know what to say. I was on pins and needles, not knowing whether or not to believe them. So I called my dad on the telephone and told him about it. He said, “Stand tall. Don’t worry.” And he was right. Three days later, I got a call from RockResorts notifying me that I had been selected for the job. I was thrilled, of course, but also amazed. How had it happened? It turned out that the woman who had borrowed the practice balls was Dora Pasarell, the mother of 57\n\nNick Bollettieri Charlie Pasarell, who at the time was one of the best junior players in the country. She and her husband, Charles Sr., were well respected business leaders and athletes in Puerto Rico—he held the distributorship for Philip Morris for all the Caribbean. They belonged to Dorado Beach and were good friends with Laurance Rockefeller. Dora had proposed me for the job and offered a strong recommendation in my favor. Nancy and I packed our bags—no more Sahara!—and flew to San Juan where we were met by a car and chauffeur from the hotel. I was so excited, I still remember the 90-minute drive to the resort past the Bacardi Rum headquarters and through a series of small, scenic towns. But nothing compared with the beauty of the resort itself. It was located on a section of pristine coast. As we entered we could see the private airport, which allowed wealthy clients to fly in from San Juan. There were individual, two-story cottages along the beach, nestled among lush trees, a main hotel and a house called “Su Casa,” where Amelia Earhart spent time before her fateful flight. It still stands on the premises to this day and commands a big price tag: $25,000 for one night’s stay! Naturally, Nancy and I were impressed. Then I got even better news! When I met with the manager, he told me I would earn $3,500 for the winter season, November through March, plus all the money from lessons I taught and the proceeds from the pro shop. We were given a beautifully furnished condo with maid service and offered free meals. As a director I had dining privileges to eat with the guests of the hotel. To say I was in paradise would be an understatement. This was the big time! I quickly realized, though, that the people who stayed at Dorado Beach came mostly for the golf. The two 18-hole courses hosted the famous Dorado Cup, which attracted all the top 1960s golfers, including Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player (his daughter later attended my tennis academy for a year). The assistant golf pro\n\n58\n\nChanging the Game there was Chi Chi Rodriguez, a promising “local boy” on the cusp of realizing his extraordinary talent. He and his beautiful wife lived in another condo on the grounds, and he and I became good friends. Fortunately for me, hotel guests had to pass by my three front tennis courts on their way to the golf shop and golf course. When Nancy and I saw them heading our way, we’d race out on a court and start hitting balls back and forth to give the impression that tennis was a fun, lively activity at the resort. As the tennis program grew, I used some of my street hustling skills to augment my income. We had five courts at the main tennis center close to the golf shop, two of them behind the main three show courts. This was where all of the action took place. My biggest spenders would be assigned to play on “my court.” There were also two courts on the west side of the complex near the 13th hole of the golf course, right next to the ocean. We called them “The Wind Tunnel” because the constant breezes and heavy gusts often blew both tennis and golf balls into the sea. Me demonstrating good form. That’s where we “banished” those guests who would not come into the pro shop and purchase our merchandise or sign up for lessons. Most of our guests left their racquets with us overnight. Many of these racquets were strung with gut, a resilient fiber made from cow’s intestines, favored by professional players. During the evening, a sprinkler system would come through the window of the pro shop—\n\n59\n\nNick Bollettieri ha, ha—and wet the strings. The next day in the heat and humidity, they would begin to pop and the guests would wonder why their strings were breaking, as they often had them newly strung before coming to Dorado Beach. We would tell them to put talcum powder in their racquet covers to absorb the moisture from the tropical climate. They would use so much of it that it often looked like a snow shower when they pulled their racquets out of the sleeves. Naturally, we gave them a great deal on restringing. The tropical climate did have its drawbacks. Whenever it rained, it cost me money; brief downpours would halt our lessons for half an hour at a time. To get back in business quickly we’d take the white hotel towels and use them as squeegees. It was quite a sight when we dragged 30 towels across a court at one time. Unfortunately, some of the green paint came off in the process, and the hotel administration went crazy and stopped the practice. About the only thing that could get me off the court in those days was when the surf got big. I’ve always been crazy about surfing, and while the other side of the island had the big waves, there was a small point on the golf course, surrounded by rocks and jutting into the ocean, that made a great local spot for us. I’d phone Jimmy Boy at the condo to alert him that the conditions were Jimmy Boy and me on vacation ripe, and we’d have fun together in Fort Myers, Florida. body and boogie board surfing. I met a number of interesting people at Dorado Beach, including Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, whose son Jonathan later attended one of my summer camps. Another was\n\n60\n\nChanging the Game A.C. Nielsen, Jr., then president of the famous market research and television ratings company. One day when I was giving a tennis clinic for the children of some local club members, a solidly built, middle-aged gentleman stopped on his way to the golf course and watched me teach for a while. Then he commented, “Young man, you belong with children!” I didn’t know who he was at the time, but soon found out: Vince Lombardi, the coach of the Green Bay Packers, who had recently been named the most successful coach in the history of the National Football League, winning five NFL championships in seven years and the first two Super Bowls. After football season ended, he came to Puerto Rico to play golf and relax. He stopped by the tennis courts nearly every day, and we became friends. I loved football and would send bags of golf balls up to Green Bay for Vince and his friends. Later on, he helped me start an important summer camp. The old adage, “It’s not what you know—it’s who you know,” again proved incredibly accurate! You never know whom you are talking to and what might happen as a result of that friendly conversation! My grandmother would always say, “Thank you,” to people who helped her and did things for her, and I learned early on to follow her example. Nowadays the buzz word for what she did is “networking,” and I have no doubt that it is one of the most important practices that has made me and my career so successful. In a very real way, Vince Lombardi and Dora Pasarell played key roles in my early development and ultimately, all that followed. I will be forever grateful to them. Vince died in 1970, and Dora’s son Charlie went on to represent the United States in the Davis Cup, and excelled especially in doubles, sometimes with Arthur Ashe as his partner. After his retirement from playing, Charlie was instrumental in the creation of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, a Masters tennis event with one of the largest audiences after the four Grand Slam tournaments. He and I have remained close friends over the years.\n\n61\n\nNick Bollettieri In the meantime, the tennis program at Dorado kept growing and our courts were often completely booked. One day, a guest telephoned the pro shop to reserve a court at 9 a.m. the next day, and Nancy told him we were booked up until 3 in the afternoon. She had no idea what it meant that she had just turned down Jay Rockefeller! When I found out about it, I just about had a hernia and quickly called him back to tell him that a court had opened up for him at the time he had requested. This was before he became governor of West Virginia and later on, a U.S. senator, but I knew the Rockefeller name carried plenty of clout. I later had the privilege of teaching the Rockefeller family at Pocantico Hills, their 4,000-acre estate and family compound in Tarrytown, New York. It was an amazing place. The first thing you saw when you arrived was a three-story greenhouse so big you could have parked a 747 in it! The Har-Tru tennis courts, surrounded by ivy, were beautifully decorated in an Egyptian motif. For me it was almost a surreal experience, coming as I did from the streets of North Pelham, to be welcomed to the governor’s place! The Rockefeller brothers—David, John D., Laurance and Nelson, who was governor of New York at the time—each had a mansion at the estate, all except Winthrop, who had a house in Arkansas. The brothers all got along exceedingly well and were always pleasant. Chi Chi Rodriguez would give golf lessons and I taught tennis to the family. All of the Rockefellers, including Happy, the second wife of the governor, overwhelmed us with kindness and affection and made us feel like a part of the family. We played together, swam together and had lunch together. But when we were summoned to come up to the “big house” on the top of the hill, where the governor had his own tennis court, it was all business. Even I got a little nervous. Everybody was intimidated by him. Brian Gottfried and Jimmy Boy traveled with me a lot in those days. Brian was only 13 and played singles and doubles. I remember\n\n62\n\nChanging the Game one match when he and Jay Rockefeller, who was the best tennis player in the family, were paired against Laurance’s son-in-law and Bones Spencer, the husband of John Rockefeller’s daughter and later the dean of Deerfield Academy. The spectators were the wives of Laurance and John, among others. It was a very competitive contest, and you wouldn’t believe the colorful language the players used throughout the match, which showed how down-to-earth they all were, even though they had unimaginable wealth. Along with my son, they also invited my mother and father to come up from nearby North Pelham. Jimmy’s favorite place was the Playhouse, a big building on the golf course that had two bowling lanes,\n\nMy father, Jimmy Boy and me on the golf course in 1969.\n\nan indoor swimming pool and a gym with all kinds of gymnastic equipment. There was also a family ice cream parlor. The first time Jimmy Boy came along, his eyes were as big as saucers. Then he said, sadly, “Daddy, I don’t have any money,” until I assured him, “No, no, it’s for free!” In the meantime, my marriage to Nancy came to an end rather abruptly. I’m not sure what went wrong. I was too busy with tennis\n\n63\n\nNick Bollettieri lessons, schmoozing with guests and running tennis camps during the summer—which all may have contributed to our breakup. I think that maybe coming from a quiet Midwestern town, it was too hard for her to fit into my wild, erratic life, and she decided to move on. The end came in the fall of 1964 when she went to Mexico and got a divorce. I didn’t remain a bachelor long, though. Chi Chi Rodriguez was planning to play an exhibition golf event in Des Moines, Iowa, and then head to Las Vegas afterward, and he invited me to join him. I drove to Des Moines, and directly across the street from the airport was a restaurant/hotel called “Johnny and Kay’s.” Working there was a cute waitress whose name was Jeri Sylvester. She was a senior at Drake University, liked music and had a fun personality. Her sister Jeannie was the maître d’, and as I was leaving, I mentioned to her that I would like to take Jeri with me to Las Vegas. She assured me that her sister would not be interested; she didn’t even know me! I left my car near the airport and following the golf exhibition, Chi Chi and I flew to Las Vegas. After a few days there, I called the restaurant and invited Jeri to join me. She refused, but asked me to come back to Des Moines for a Dave Brubeck concert. So I returned and we had a good time both at the concert and afterward. A day or so later I drove back to Miami and flew to my winter gig at the Dorado Beach resort. Before long, I called Jeri and invited her to come down to Puerto Rico, and she accepted. Soon after she arrived, we were married by a judge in his office in Old San Juan. Our two daughters Danielle and Angel were born in 1967 and 1969, and we had a lot of fun at the resort. I can still remember Angel as a little girl walking into the pro shop with live lizards for “earrings.” She’d have them bite her earlobes and they dangled by her head as she came in to show them off! Danielle, Angel and Jimmy Boy, who visited during the winters, all later told me that the times at Dorado were some of the happiest in their young lives, because I\n\n64\n\nChanging the Game was always there. During the summers, when I continued to conduct tennis camps, I couldn’t always take them along. At some point in Springfield, Dr. Dredge and I no longer saw eye to eye, and after co-managing the Snyder Park program for two years, we parted amicably. By then, I had other job offers, and spent time at a variety of tennis clubs on the East Coast and in the Midwest, including the Woodmont Country Club in Rockville, Maryland and the Nassau Country Club in Glen Cove, Long Island. In the summer of 1963, my staff and I began teaching at the Lake Bluff RacMe, Angel, Danielle and Jeri quet Club in Lake Forest, Illinois, on at Dorado. the north shore of Chicago. It was a very upscale club that had HarTru courts that needed constant attention. After about five winters at Dorado, Bland Hoke, the general manager of RockResorts, called me into his office. He told me that I was doing a great job and he wanted me to stay at the resort year-round. When I said to him that I couldn’t do that because of my summer camp commitments—I wasn’t about to give those lucrative jobs up— he informed me that it would be my last year at Dorado. Some days later, Laurance Rockefeller and his wife Mary stopped by to say hello. They were kind, soft-spoken people and they told me how much they loved having me there. When they asked me if everything was okay, I said, “Yes, but I won’t be here much longer,” and told them about the manager’s ultimatum. Two hours after they left, I received a call from Bland Hoke and he told me I could do as I pleased. One day I met a kindly gentleman with horn-rimmed glasses who just sat courtside for a number of days and watched me teach tennis.\n\n65\n\nNick Bollettieri He finally got up the courage to take a lesson, and during our session, he told me that he loved the sport, but was really a squash player. Hy Zausner chipped this, chopped that and kept spinning the ball until I had to tell him to stick with squash! He had a good sense of humor about it. He was a successful businessman, one of the largest importers of foreign cheeses. At some point he asked me where I would be going for my summer job. When I explained that I would be at the Nassau Country Club in Long Island and would spend some time at Pocantico Hills with the Rockefellers, he offered me the use of his guesthouse located in Sands Point, a wealthy Long Island community. His home had its own tennis court, and Brian Gottfried and I would hit with his two older sons from his first marriage, Marty and Dick. He also had two younger children, Susan and Michael, with his current wife, Annabell, a kind and beautiful lady. When word got out that I was in the area, three little girls came over for lessons—the Gengler sisters, Nancy, Louise and Margie. Louise later became the ladies’ tennis coach at Princeton University, and Margie married Stan Smith, a former No. 1 tennis player and two-time Grand Slam tournament singles champion. The next summer, Hy invited me to return, but this time he had a surprise for me. He had purchased several acres in the town adjoining Sands Point. He was going to build the Port Washington Tennis Academy and invited me to become its director. I was speechless, but decided to go for it. Brian Gottfried, Jimmy Boy and I helped spread the Har-Tru as the first clay courts were built. Most people think Harry Hopman, the legendary Australian Davis Cup team tennis coach, was the first director, but those people would be wrong. After Hy and I had a falling out, Bill Weisbach replaced me, and then Harry Hopman replaced Bill some time later. The academy has some illustrious graduates, notably John McEnroe and Mary Carillo. Today, the Port Washington Tennis Academy is run by Hy’s sons and continues to be a very successful enterprise.\n\n66\n\nChanging the Game\n\nJeri and me in 1966.\n\n67\n\nBeaver Dam, Wisconsin, 1970 to 1971—we would go to Wayland Academy, where Nick had one of his summer camps. We would play tennis and train six and a half days a week. There was a group of eight of us on scholarship. Our payment for all of this was to wash Nick’s yellow Corvette “thoroughly,” and he would inspect it. Some of the best times a kid could ever hope for we spent there. Lessons I still carry on in my life even now, I realize I learned during those summers with Nick. —Larry Gottfried, brother of Brian Gottfried\n\nIt all started with Nick Bollettieri in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. While he was exploring uncharted territory in tennis, Nick was also mentoring young people like myself who have gone into the tennis industry and were part of the tennis boom of the 1970s. In my estimation, Nick Bollettieri was one of the three or four people largely responsible for that tennis boom and consequently, for the wonderful industry that I, along with thousands of other people, now work within. I would love to see a “Nick Bollettieri Family Tennis Tree,” as I am sure the branches would be plentiful and the number of Bollettieri-influenced men and women within the industry would reach four generations deep. —Steve Contardi, USPTA Master Pro The Club at Harper’s Point, Cincinnati, Ohio\n\n68\n\nCHAPTER 5 Beaver Dam I guess I was something of a hothead sometimes—it was “my way or the highway.” But this was long before I started my Academy in Bradenton, Florida, and I couldn’t call my own shots yet; more often than not, I had to take to the highway when there were disagreements with owners or management. One time, for example, I had an argument with a woman at the Lake Bluff Racquet Club. She was rude and I responded in kind. She always complained that the courts were too dry and gave the maintenance crew a difficult time. I agreed that the courts were too dry, but it was because she and her friends continued to play on them long into the watering time. She ranted at me that it didn’t matter how long they played, it was my job to keep the courts in tip-top condition. The next day, as she and her friends were playing at exactly the time that the courts should be watered, I turned on the sprinkler system and soaked the entire group. Dripping wet, she ran into my shop, yelling, “Do you know who I am?” My response was “Lady, I don’t care who you are!” Well, it turned out that she was the wife of the president of the club. When I found out, I told her, “You don’t like me and I don’t like you. Either you stay out of my way, or tell your husband to buy out my contract.” I finished the season and decided to move on. At some point I recalled Vince Lombardi’s advice that I belonged with children, and I called him in Green Bay to ask for his assistance in identifying another location for my summer programs. I was thinking about the Midwest. My wife’s parents lived in Carlisle, Iowa; I had bought a house there and always enjoyed the time we spent there as 69\n\nNick Bollettieri a family. Vince Lombardi went out of his way to help, as did A.C. Nielsen, Jr. in Illinois, and the very next spring I found myself in a little community called Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, about 100 miles northwest of Milwaukee. The sign at the entrance to the town said that 14,000 busy beavers live there! I ran my summer programs at Wayland Academy, a private prep school that students from all over the United States attended, and Beaver Dam became the premier summer tennis camp in the world.\n\nBeaver Dam Tennis Camp brochure featuring Jimmy Arias, Kathleen Horvath and me.\n\n70\n\nChanging the Game The headmaster of Wayland was Ray Patterson, Jr., a great sports fan with a phenomenal eye for talent. He later became the president of the Milwaukee Bucks and drafted a young basketball player from UCLA named Lew Alcindor, who soon after changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The following year, the Bucks became the fastest expansion team ever to win a championship title in any sport. Fifteen years later, Patterson did it again when he ran the Houston Rockets and selected Hakeem Olajuwon, who led the Rockets to back-to-back NBA championships in the 1990s! Part of the deal that first year at Wayland was that I had to coach the boys’ and girls’ tennis teams in the spring. It meant I had to leave Dorado Beach in April, a few weeks early. In retrospect, it was worth the financial sacrifice. I had a room on the bottom floor of the girls’ dormitory, so my family did not join me. Jeri and the kids stayed at our house in Carlisle, Iowa. There were only four outdoor tennis courts. When I told Ray Patterson that they weren’t enough for the summer program, he said, “So build some more.” We did and, incredibly, managed to finish 11 additional outdoor courts just before camp opened in late June. As luck would have it, it poured down rain that whole first week. Fortunately, Wayland had a magnificent indoor dome with tartan turf, and we were able to share it wi"
