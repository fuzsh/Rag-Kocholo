        "text": "Dear friends and colleagues, About 4 months ago, I announced that I was hiking the entire length of the Jordan Trail (684km) alone and unassisted to raise awareness about children's mental health in places where violent conflict is occurring or unfolding. I began walking last Friday and today is my 6th day on the road. I have walked 146 Kms so far and I have about 500+ more to go. In case you were wondering how could you support me, there are three ways: 1. I have set up a GoFundMe campaign. Funds raised through the hike will support local or community initiatives working with children affected by conflict. I will donate half of the amount received to a shelter working with refugee and migrant children in Mexico (where I am from) and the other half to an organization providing immediate medical health to children wounded in battle. Any help you can give will be super useful. https://gofund.me/43e9460d 2. You could also take some time and write me a short message sharing your thoughts as to why protecting children during conflict is important. If you live in a place where conflict is taking place, I would like to hear how is the conflict affecting children where you live or work. If you live in a place without conflict, I would like to also hear your thoughts. Sometimes conflicts have reverberating repercussions that are felt elsewhere. More than anything, I want you to think about it and for us to have a conversation. 3. I would also invite you to do something on your own. Why not volunteer for a couple of hours in a local project working around children's issues and their communities? Anything that you can do to support will make a massive difference. By the way, I am sharing the progress of my walk through Instagram. https://lnkd.in/ezupV2TX From now on, I will also be making weekly posts through Linkedin. Finally, If we have met in person, and you do not have Instagram but would like to follow my trek, make sure to send me a message. I can either add you to a WhatsApp group or share the link to my satellite tracker. I look forward to your support and thanks again for your help! See you in the trail. Antonio"
