        "text": "Early Life:\n\n- Raja Ram Mohan Roy was born in 1774 in Hooghly district, Bengal Presidency.\n\n- He got married at the age of nine and later served the East India Company as a clerk.\n\n- He learned Bengali, Sanskrit, Persian, and Arabic. He also took up English, which greatly influenced his spiritual and religious beliefs.\n\nSocial Reforms:\n\n- He is also known as the Father of the ‘Indian Renaissance’\n\n- During the late 18th century, Bengal society was burdened with customs like child marriage, polygamy, and the brutal practice of Sati.\n\n- Raja Ram Mohan Roy abhorred Sati and raised his voice against it. In 1830, he went to the UK as a Mughal ambassador to protect the ban on Sati by Bengal Sati Regulation, 1829.\n\n- He was a champion of women's rights, working to abolish Sati and advocating against child marriage and polygamy.\n\n- He also opposed the rigid caste divisions of his time.\n\nEducational Reforms:\n\n- Raja Ram Mohan Roy appreciated English literature and recognised the need for scientific and rational education that was lacking in traditional Indian texts.\n\n- To address this, he advocated for an English Education System in India, with subjects like Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Botany.\n\n- His educational initiatives included co-founding Hindu College in 1817, which became a prestigious institution, and establishing the Anglo-Vedic School in 1822 and the Vedanta College in 1826.\n\nReligious Contributions:\n\n- Ram Mohan Roy strongly opposed unnecessary ceremonialism and idolatry advocated by priests.\n\n- He played a key role in reorganising the Atmiya Sabha (1815) into the Brahma Sabha, a precursor to the Brahmo Samaj (1828).\n\n- This new movement emphasised monotheism, independence from scriptures, and renunciation of the caste system.\n\n- Brahmo religious practices were stripped of Hindu ceremonialism and adapted elements from Christian or Islamic prayer practices.\n\n- The Brahma Samaj became a progressive force driving social reforms in Bengal, particularly advocating for women's education.\n\nJournalistic Contributions:\n\n- A supporter of free speech, Ram Mohan Roy fought for the rights of the vernacular press, advocating their freedom to publish without government interference.\n\n- He established newspapers 'Mirat-ul-Akhbar' in Persian and 'Sambad Kaumudi' in Bengali.\n\n- Protested against press control: He asserted that newspapers should remain free and the truth should not be suppressed based on government preferences.\n\nEarly Life:\n\n- Ishwar Chandra Bandopadhyaya was born in 1820 in Midnapore district, Bengal.\n\n- His parents, Thakurdas Bandyopadhyay and Bhagavati Devi, were religious people.\n\n- In 1826, he went to Calcutta with his father and learned the basics of Sanskrit at a village pathshala.\n\nCareer:\n\n- Vidyasagar joined Fort William College in 1841 as the Head Pandit in the Sanskrit department.\n\n- He later became the Principal of \"Sanskrit College\" after resigning and rejoining due to an altercation with Rasomoy Dutta.\n\n- In 1855, he assumed the responsibilities of a special inspector of schools, travelling to remote Bengal villages to oversee the quality of education.\n\nEducational Reforms:\n\n- Vidyasagar is credited with remodelling the scholastic system at Sanskrit College, introducing courses in European History, Philosophy, and Science alongside Vedic scriptures.\n\n- He also changed admission rules, introduced admission and tuition fees, and established the Normal School for teacher training.\n\n- Advocating for women's education, he opened 35 schools for girls in Bengal and supported the establishment of the first permanent girls' school in India, the Bethune School.\n\nSocial Reforms:\n\n- A vocal advocate against women's oppression, Vidyasagar played a pivotal role in the passage of the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act in 1856, which legalised widow remarriage and provided relief to widows.\n\n- He challenged Brahminical authorities and presented arguments that proved Vedic scriptures sanctioned widow remarriage.\n\n- Vidyasagar went beyond advocacy, personally arranging several marriages for child or adolescent widows within respectable families.\n\n- Sister Nivedita was born as Margaret Elizabeth Noble, an Irish woman who became an ardent follower of Swami Vivekananda and moved to Calcutta, India.\n\n- She was also a vocal advocate of the Independence movement that was gaining ground in the State.\n\n- She was an educationist from a very early age; in India, she was the pioneer in women's education. In North Calcutta, for the upliftment of women, she started a school.\n\n- She visited Midnapore in 1903 to inaugurate the first Akhara (a place of practice for martial arts and physical training)at Miyabazar. It was opened in Mr Abdul Kaddar’s (ex-Deputy Magistrate) house.\n\n- She supported the cultural resistance against the British. She had a significant impact on promoting and reconstructing the \"Indianness\" of Indian Art as a result of her activities, which were primarily in Calcutta.\n\n- In cooperation with Ananda Coomaraswamy, she defended Indian Art against the British misconception that Indian Art was not original but influenced by Hellenic Art.\n\n- Sister Nivedita urged young artists to avoid being influenced by Western Art in the months after Abanindranath Tagore's establishing of the Bengal School of Art, a cultural movement opposing the imitational style of Western Art.\n\n- She wasinfluential in sending young artists to the caves in Ajanta, Maharashtra, to document the ancient pieces of art and bore their expenses as well.\n\n- Ramabai, a prominent advocate for women's rights and a social reformer, was the only woman in the male-dominated world of gender reforms.\n\n- She excelled in Sanskrit and was rewarded with titles like 'Pandita' (Scholar) and 'Saraswati' (Goddess of Learning).\n\n- Ramabai travelled extensively in Bengal, addressing women's education and emancipation, drawing on mythological figures of educated and independent women.\n\n- in 1882, she established Arya Mahila Samaj at Poona to educate the women and save them from child marriage and other evil customs.\n\n- She wrote “Stree Dharma Niti” and “The Cry of Indian Women” (both in Marathi) and “High Caste Hindu Women” (in English)\n\n- Ramabai faced resistance when she established the Arya Mahila Samaj in 1882 in Poona, mobilising women and causing hostility.\n\n- She established a home for high-caste Hindu widows and appealed to the Hunter Commission (1882) for women's training in teaching and medicine, enabling them to serve others.\n\n- She founded Sharda Sadan for widows and unmarried girls in 1883.\n\n- She got the Kaisar-e-Hind Gold medal in 1919.\n\n- She was heavily criticised for the alleged propagation of Christianity."
