        "text": "2022 M I S C E L L A N Y\n\nFrom the Principal's Desk As we gradually return to our normal mode of functioning, albeit with uncertain steps, all of us are rediscovering the possibilities of living purposefully with more sincerity and an appetite for experiences that are both enchanting and enlightening. And there isn't a better way to find ourselves than giving character and shape to the thoughts that provoke our confusions, our idle indulgences and basically invigorate the prejudices we leave behind on our way towards an enlightenment, all our own. After a period of stasis and volatility, we are all taking steps towards our old lives, now changed in so many ways. On this note, Miscellany attempts to celebrate and honour the desire of our dear students to express themselves using this platform that humbly documents their journey of devotedly discovering the raptures of self-expression. For the second time, we are please to introduce Miscellany in electronic format and in addition to showcasing their photography, painting, drawing and writing skills, we have reviews on books, films and music from our contributors. Current Affairs and very aptly, Life Beyond the Pandemic along with Campus Chronicles are some of our segments in this year's edition. Travelogues feature as well in the segment wanderlust since they are the perfect recipe for rejuvenation and articles through which students have conveyed their respects in honour of the legacy of the stalwarts we have lost in the last two years have added value to the variety of contributions. I thank and congratulate all students for their submissions. I would also like to thank the publishers and everyone involved with Miscellany for making this journey an indelible one.

My family had planned a trip to Darjeeling and for some reason I was initially not very keen on going it. Thankfully I went ahead with the trip and avoided making a grave mistake. When I entered Darjeeling, the irst thing I felt was the gentle breeze and the lush green trees and the clouds covering the hills and it was nothing less than paradise. I spent my days at the fabulous and amazing property of Mayfair Hotel. Since it was my irst time in Darjeeling, I wanted to make sure I explore the place thoroughly. So we visited the Darjeeling Zoo where I saw bears, black panthers, various parakeets and even the cute red pandas. Also, I had a very close encounter with the wolves. Apart from the beautiful animals, the lush green trees, the light orange sky and the sunset were creating their own magic. We also visited the Darjeeling Rock Garden which was very beautiful with the greenery and the waterfalls. We headed to the Tea Plantation and had refreshing cups of tea and clicked pictures amidst the garden with great dif iculty because the place was very sloping. We boarded the Darjeeling Toy Train and it was a good 30-minute joy ride from Darjeeling till Ghum. Mid-way the train stopped at Batasia Loop where we clicked loads of pictures. The coal engine train with the smoke coming out of the roof and the “chhuk-chhuk” noise actually made me feel like wanting to do the “Chhaiya Chhaiya” step that Shah Rukh Khan did in his movie.\n\nA good trip always needs good food and I'm sure you have already guessed where we went to eat some delicious and lip-smacking food. Yes! Glenary and Keventers. Being foodies and meat lovers, we gorged on the crispy fried pork, bacon and cheese macaroni and ham and cheese omelettes. We had strawberry milkshakes and blueberry muf ins. And obviously, we had some amazing chicken momos from the street vendors with piping hot Darjeeling tea. Well all good things come to an end so on our last day at this beautiful place, we spent most of our time in the hotel and clicked pictures of the scenic view. We even woke up at 5 am to see the amazing Kanchenjunga range. Lastly, we bought a lot of gifts for my friends and relatives and even bought varieties of tea and a fruit cake with us. Darjeeling has been one of my best holidays so far. It was so refreshing and beautiful. Plus I was happy that my parents had improved their photography skills because I got some good pictures of myself and made my Instagram feed very happening. Overall the trip has been amazing and I can't wait to go back there again! Thea Chakraborty, Sem - 6, Phychology\n\nVaranasi VARANASI VARANASI, BANARAS OR KASHI-This city has different names but has only one notion; the notion of divine energy. In schools, colleges and other institutions we are often taught about the History of India but from a western point of view. According to the western historians, the oldest and ancient civilization of India was the Indus Valley Civilization with Harappa and Mohenjo Daro as its oldest cities. But according to the Indian Culture which is least known by all of us it is believed that Varanasi is the oldest city of India. Varanasi is often regarded as “SHIV KI NAGRI” as mentioned in the Rig Veda which is the oldest known Vedic Sanskrit text written between 1500 and 1200 BCE. The ideal time of visiting Varanasi is from October to March a fey years back, I was fortunate enough to visit Varanasi once. I still remember the feeling of witnessing\n\nthe abode of peace in the clamorous city ; the feeling was highly elusive. There was a positive energy which touched my mind, body and soul. There are 88 ghats in Varanasi along the mesmerizing Ganges. It is quite impossible for a human being to visit all of the ghats and I was no exception but I managed to visit some of the signi icant ghats of Varanasi namely the Dashashwamedh Ghat, Manikarnika Ghat and the . Dashashwamedh Ghat Dashashwamedh Ghat is the main ghat in Varanasi created by Lord Brahma to welcome Lord Shiva to Varanasi. The best time to visit this ghat is evening time. One can witness a splendid view of the Ganges during the time of “Ganga Aarti” and feel Shakti. It seems as if all your pain and injuries are healing from within. If in Varanasi one cannot miss the Ganga Aartiin Dashashwamedh Ghat.\n\nAlong with being the Spiritual Capital, Varanasi is also very renowned as a place of attaining Moksh after Death. Manikarnika Ghat is one such famous ghat where it is believed that one can realise the actual truth of life. In this ghat, cremation continues 24×7 and never stops. I had been keenly desiring to go there since I had heard stories about it and after reaching there I felt that energy is not always light and happy, it can be powerful and heavy too. Here I learned the fact that death is inescapable and life is a circle; a human being starts walking on the soil and ends up laying there on the soil.
