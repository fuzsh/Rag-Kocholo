        "text": "At the time when a wave of Swadeshi Andolon was sweeping across India, emerged a protest against western influences replacing Indian traditional art in the form of Bengal School of Art. The thought behind this movement was to revive Indian art from the clutches of Eurocentric approach at a time when British colonization had spread its claws to all spheres be it art, culture, social, political or the economy.\n\nThis school of thought attempted to bring in swadeshi values to Indian paintings which had lost the essence of traditional Indian styled themes and mainly catered to western subjects and techniques. In spite of it being a protest to British imperialism ironically one of the founder members along with Abanindra Nath Tagore was Ernest Benfield Havell. He was an art historian and teacher who presented Indian art to the world as it should be. While being the Principal of Government School of Art in Kolkata he felt Indian art is overly influenced by western techniques as he is to have rightly said ‘in India, painting must be Indian in attitude and spirit’.\n\nThe Primary Thought\n\nThis school of thought originated in Bengal, Santiniketan, and Kolkata being the epicenter. It took shape as an Avant Garde or primarily an aesthetic style of art that was close to Indian spiritual Ideas. Thus incorporating the spiritual essence of the east and doing away with the materialism of the west in their paintings and other art forms was what this school of artist propagated. Students were encouraged to imitate Mughal miniature paintings and those of Ajanta caves.\n\nSalient Features\n\nThey found the paintings of Raja Ravi Verma and other company artists to be away from Indian traditional style so they started following the style of Moghul miniature paintings, Rajasthan paintings and that of a fresco from Ajanta Caves.\n\nIn continuance with following the traditional Indian theme and style these artists borrowed themes from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, Gita and the Puranas and thus celebrated the rich Indian culture.Bright colours were not used instead artists experimented with light and shade in painting elegant figures.\n\nAnother noteworthy characteristic of this school was the influence of Japanese artists and Japanese wash techniques. Even some work of artists had so much influence of Japanese art that painting of human features distinctly resembled Japanese features.\n\nThe Legacy\n\nThis school can be considered the first nationalist art group whose main aim was to celebrate India’s rich heritage and create art that had India’s very own spiritual essence in it. Even the west started looking towards the east to come away from extreme materialism.\n\nWhen we talk of Bengal school of Art the name that comes to our mind is that of Earnest Binfield Havell who has been the principal of Calcutta Art School. He was the main driving force along with Abanindra Nath Tagore in establishing the school that encouraged Indian art form both in technique and spirit. When he was appointed the Principal of Calcutta Art school in 1896 it was also the time when nationalism was raging in the air. Though his name is not as well known for supporting Indian nationalism like that of O Hume or Annie Besant, but it was him who encouraged young artists to veer out from the influence of materialism of the west and instead celebrate the spiritual essence of the east. He gave more weightage to the art traditions of this country than of the west which he represented.\n\nThe books that he wrote were written from an Indian point of view which Havell developed through his extensive reading of Indian philosophy, mythology and literature. Thus his influence towards Indian art in developing a contemporary style was a great deal.\n\nThe first Indian artist who brought the essence of Swadeshi into the realm of art was one from the famous Tagore family. Abanindranath Tagore nephew to Nobel Laureate Rabindranath was also the first Indian artist to be recognised globally. An artist and also a writer who was born in Jorashako in 1871 to Gunendranath Tagore and Saudamini Devi was exposed to a world of art and culture from his birth. Since 1880 he studied in Sanskrit College where he learnt art for 9 years until he was married to Suhasini Devi in 1889.\n\nThereafter he took admission to St Xaviers college where he studied English before enrolling himself to the prestigious Calcutta School Of Art. Here he learnt the use of pastels from O Ghiladri, an Italian artist who was also the vice-principal of the college and then went onto learning watercolours from Charles Palmer. By 1890 he had published several illustrations in Sadhana magazine and in Chitrangada and also drew illustrations for his own stories, but that was following traditional European technique. He had started to reject western modernism and realised the importance of using Indian elements to his paintings but it was not until he met Havell that he started propagating and implementing it to bring about a change in the technique of painting of other contemporary artists and students. He was greatly influenced by Mughal and Rajput style of paintings and incorporated both. Taking inspiration from Joydev’s Geetagobindo The Krishna Lila series that he painted in 1895 to 97 using watercolour was the first of its kind which had a pronounced influence of Mughal Art. Thus though he was training himself on the use of watercolour from a European artist he had found the importance of retaining traditional style in Indian art.\n\nThere was also an element of drama to be depicted in his work which was his response to the human sufferings that he saw around him at the same time giving a thematic focus to his work. In the field of painting also Ramkinkar was no less a stalwart. the red earth, flowering Palash, mother earth and the Santhal youth all held a special place in his artwork. His paintings were all filled with colour, force and vitality.\n\nRabindranath Tagore\n\nLike his poetry, Tagore’s art also had a unique rhythmic style of his own. He started painting late in his career in his sixties and it began not as a conscious effort to paint but resulted from his doodles and erasures in his manuscripts taking some form. The unplanned shapes which were initially formed accidentally did not always represent any bird or animal that we know of. According to the poet, ‘a probable animal that had unaccountably missed his chance of existence’ or ‘ a bird that only can soar in our dreams’. His creative mind continued painting a variety of images including bizarre animals, masked and mysterious human faces, colourful landscapes etc. The medium he used for his expression of freedom also was not confined to brushes only. He used rag, cotton wool and even his fingers.\n\nAccording to Siva Kumar modernism for these artists from Santiniketan did not just lay in style or a form of internationalism. He used this term to help understand the art form that these artists have practised. The alternative modernity that emerged in place of so-called European modernism was against the racial and cultural modernity which was the essence of European modernism. Their breaking free from stereotypes of European art and theme and establishing their form resulting from understanding traditional concepts and influence by transcultural exchanges.\n\nLimited Edition Art\n\nThe concept of Limited Edition Art has helped art collectors to a great extent by increasing the availability of artworks. Limited Edition Art is a series of artwork produced with the approval of the artist. These are not prints as we understand but are artworks made in the form of prints by the artist and are as authentic as the original artwork. This series is not only a one-time printing of the artwork but also limited to a specific number of pieces as decided by the artist and most commonly signed and numbered by the artist himself.\n\nIt is different from reproductions which are mechanically produced photographed copies of the original artwork. This production of multiple version of the same work is referred to as Editions. Various techniques of prints have been used in this Limited Edition Art like that of Serigraphs, Lithographs, woodcuts, engravings etc. Serigraphy or silk screen printing is the most sophisticated printing as this technique produces vibrant colours and beautiful textures. Using this technique of printing also gives the impression of a painting rather than a print and hence is the most popular. Use of woodcut technique is one of the most complicated, labour intensive and time-consuming as each of the colour used is produced by using a different hand-carved woodblock.\n\nDifferent techniques used in different kinds of printings adds to the variety of texture and finish of the prints. Interested collectors are exposed to the choice of having diversity in their art collection. Just like original artworks the Limited Edition Prints also might become more expensive with time and the artist’s popularity. So they can fetch lucrative returns from the investor’s point of view too. Though the market for Limited Edition Prints is not yet very popular in India slowly the popularity is increasing with contemporary buyers entering the market. In the international market, The Frugal Repast by Pablo Picasso’s first-ever print has been known to fetch thousands of dollars.\n\nArt and craft in Bengal\n\nBengal is not just known as the birthplace of some famous artists, poets and painters. The rich cultural traditional handicrafts and paintings of Bengal are not only aesthetical masterpieces but are eco friendly also. At the same time, they have been representing the local heritage since ages.\n\nPattachitra\n\nIt is a traditional style of folk painting to depict stories is done on patta or cloth. The painters are called Patuas and they use natural bright colours on the cloth to paint stories which are recited. Thus pattachitra drawings serve as a visual device during the chanting of a song."
