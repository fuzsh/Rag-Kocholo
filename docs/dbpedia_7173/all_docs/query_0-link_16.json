        "text": "This exhibition explores the role of 20th-century modern artists—J. Sultan Ali, M.F. Husain, Jamini Roy, and Rabindranath Tagore—in creating and shaping India’s national identity. Featuring 13 works of art, including paintings, bronze sculptures, photography, and rare books, this exhibition provides a look at pre-and post-colonial Indian artistic responses to the global modernist art movement.\n\nThe British Raj, the oppressive reign of the British Empire in the Indian subcontinent, lasted from 1858 until independence in 1947. The late 19th century Indian modernist art movement was born as a reaction against British colonization. Artists fought to assert a positive cultural image of India to counter the British imperial view of Indian tradition being “backward.” The global dominance of Western ideas of modernity spurred a cultural resistance among Indian artists, who created a modernist style distinct to their country. They sought to portray an Indian identity on their own terms, rather than be seen through foreign lenses like those of the American photographer William Witt, who visited India during the Second World War.\n\nA defining feature of global modernism was a rejection of realistically portrayed, historic subjects. Primitivism, an outlook and artistic approach that appropriated so-called “primitive” styles, such as tribal arts, was embraced by certain Indian modernists to contradict colonial schools of art and a rising industrialism. Indian modernists turned their gaze inwards and harkened back to the history of their subcontinent, not unlike Western modernists who evoked images of pre-industrial European society.They valorized rural Indian forms over Westernized ones and continued the depiction of significant figures like historically celebrated deities.This exhibition places Jamini Roy’s works alongside 19th-century Indian bronzes to represent aspects of what the modernists were attempting to revive. Through their work and efforts to represent the people of India, modernist Indian artists developed a rural, idyllic, folk-art aesthetic that created an enduring visual legacy in and of India.\n\nNetra Bhat (USC ’23), Getty Collections/Conservation Intern, Summer 2021\n\nThe three works below engage with representations of Indian rural life in its varying forms.\n\nWilliam Witt, an American, photographed poverty in rural India while he was stationed there during World War II. His lens is that of an outsider’s—his Western gaze prompts discomfort in the Faces of India’s two women, which can be seen in the way they reach for their veils, covering their faces for the camera. Whereas prominent Indian modernist painter Jamini Roy’s Three Bengali Women stand tall in their traditional sarees and look directly at the viewer with their veils pulled back, unlike the women in Witt’s photographs.\n\nAlthough Witt’s pictures aimed to spotlight regular people, Faceless Woman, as is evident in the title, betrays an impersonal view which contributes to the Western “othering” narrative of Indians. Roy’s rural women look regal, showcasing how Indian modernists sought to invent the face of India with a romanticization of rural, traditional culture at the forefront.\n\nWilliam Witt (1921–2013)\n\nFaces of India, 1943\n\nGelatin silver print on paper\n\n14 x 11 in.\n\nGift of Sally Strauss and Andrew E. Tomback\n\nScripps College, Claremont, California\n\n2019.22.160\n\nWilliam Witt was stationed in India during WWII, and inspired by documentary photography, began his photo career on the subcontinent. Witt portrays a throng of veiled women and their children. The photo is perhaps a snapshot of how the world imagined a stereotypical rural Indian setting, as scenes like this are often the ‘face’ of India.\n\nJamini Roy (1887–1972)\n\nThree Bengali Women, c. 1965\n\nAcrylic on Paper\n\n29 1/4 in. x 15 1/2 in.\n\nGift of Mr. Vladimar S. Aronovichi\n\nScripps College, Claremont, California\n\n95.2.1\n\nOne of the most celebrated Indian modernists, Jamini Roy’s signature bold, black calligraphic brushstrokes and large, almond-eyed women seem to pop from the paper. Although he was academically trained in classical Western painting at the Bengal School of Art in India, Roy began to look toward native Bengali folk art to develop his iconic primitivist style, which we see in this work. His limited palette consists of earthy colors made from locally found minerals and plants, like tamarind seeds.\n\nWilliam Witt (1921–2013)\n\nFaceless Woman, India, 1943\n\nGelatin silver print on paper\n\n14 x 11 in.\n\nGift of Sally Strauss and Andrew E. Tomback\n\nScripps College, Claremont, California\n\n2017.12.91\n\nThis woman captured by Witt has her face masked by a veil and is performing what is possibly a daily chore of pumping and pouring water from a communal tank to take to her home.\n\nThe three works below place Jamini Roy’s Cow and Krishna alongside Indian bronzes from circa 1800 to represent aspects of what the modernists were attempting to revive.\n\nThe ball in the hands of the god Krishna, seen in both the bronze and Roy’s painting, is symbolic of the story where the young deity steals lumps of butter from neighboring houses. Such mischief humanizes him. These stories live on in the rural consciousness and were what modernists like Roy referenced in order to connect urbanites to village scenes, creating a homogenous nationalism. Indian freedom fighters, including Mahatma Gandhi, idealized folk arts and handicrafts (like the bronzes seen below) as the cultural heart of India. Roy helped promote this ideal, using his unique works and self-made paints to protest the industrialization that accompanied colonization.\n\nJamini Roy (1887–1972)\n\nCow and Krishna, c. 1950\n\nGouache on Paper\n\n12 in. x 16 3/4 in.\n\nGift of Mr. Vladimar S. Aronovichi\n\nScripps College, Claremont, California\n\n95.2.5\n\nThe hypnotizingly large eyes of Jamini Roy’s cow draw you into this vibrant work, where the artist incorporates whimsy with background motifs. The blue figure on the right is the infant Krishna, a widely revered God in Hindu mythology. Roy aspired to carve out a distinct style for himself, stating “I do not care whether my paintings are good or bad. I want its appearance to be different.”\n\nCrowned Lord Krishna, c. 1800\n\nBronze\n\n2 3/4 in. x 2 1/2 in. x 2 in.\n\nGift of Mr. Vladimar S. Aronovici\n\nScripps College, Claremont, California\n\n95.3.8\n\nBrahma Candle Holder, c. 1800\n\nBronze\n\n2 1/2 in. x 2 3/4 in. x 2 in.\n\nGift of Mr. Vladimar S. Aronovici\n\nScripps College, Claremont, California\n\n95.3.14\n\nThese bronzes of the divine child Krishna and the worshipped cow Nandi (in this case, in the form of an incense holder) are household items in India, often placed in prayer rooms.\n\nMiniature paintings like the ones below flourished during the reign of the Mughal Empire in India (1526-1857). Hookah or opium pipe smoking in a courtly scene was prominent in Mughal paintings, due to the commonality of the practice among emperors and their penchant for commissioning art.\n\nAs seen here, Mughal miniatures were highly detailed, sometimes painted with brushes consisting of a single hair. The labor-intensive quality of these miniatures required artistic collaboration and division of work. Similarly, Indian folk art was often produced collaboratively in workshops, a tradition that modern, anti-consumerist artists like Jamini Roy upheld. Prominent modernists like M.F. Husain and Amritha Sher-Gil drew inspiration from the style of Mughal miniature artists, which were themselves a synthesis of Indian vernacular art’s bright palette, Persian manuscript’s fine detail, and the technical forms of European art. These examples showcase the connectedness of global modernism and how every regional movement played a part in the creation of modernist art.\n\nPortrait of Man Smoking Hookah, c. 1800\n\nPaint and colors on paper\n\n12 x 9 1/2 in.\n\nScripps College, Claremont, California\n\n2018.9.2\n\nKneeling Man with Opium Pipe, n. d.\n\nPaint on Paper\n\n8 11/16 in. x 6 9/16 in.\n\nGift of Mr. Edward Nagel\n\nScripps College, Claremont, California\n\n1929\n\nKatherine Gilette Osbourne Papers\n\nElla Strong Denison Library, Scripps College, Claremont, California\n\nLittle is known about this Indian manuscript (that was in an American traveler’s souvenirs), except that it demonstrates the Devanagiri writing system, which is shared by several languages like Hindi, Sanskrit, Marathi and Pali. The text is interspersed with minutely detailed miniature paintings, which are often followed by intricately decorated and handwritten title pages. It is a religious text, most likely Hindu, since the God Krishna can be identified in blue. The binding consists of a European print, and the text might have been rebound by former owner Ms. Osbourne. The decorative nature of these miniatures and their storytelling capacity were aspects of primitivist artwork that Indian modernists were attempting to revive.\n\nM.F. Husain (1915-2011)\n\nThe Triumphant, n. d.\n\nOil on Canvas\n\n25 3/8 in. x 33 1/2 in.\n\nGift of Mr. Vladimar S. Aronovici\n\nScripps College, Claremont, California\n\n95.2.2\n\nOne of the best paid Indian painters of his day, M.F. Husain portrayed Indian imagery in contemporary styles like the bold, modified Cubism we see above. Husain was a part of the Progressive Artists’ Group (PAG) in Bombay (now Mumbai) whose motto was to paint with “absolute freedom.” PAG formed in 1947 during the tumultuous partition of India and Pakistan. The group’s art was never without socio-political commentary on current matters, and Husain was no outlier. In The Triumphant, Husain depicts the royal, majestic Indian elephant perhaps as a symbol of the British Raj finally leaving the subcontinent and the people of India triumphing over colonialism.\n\nSultan Ali (b. 1920)\n\nLonely, n. d.\n\nOil on Canvas\n\n30 in. x 24 1/2 in.\n\nGift of Mr. Vladimar S. Aronovici\n\nScripps College, Claremont, California\n\n95.2.3\n\nThis piece—an oil painting diverging from formal realism, with its intentional cracks and figurative flaws—encapsulates J. Sultan Ali’s art. Ali trained under the strict confines of classical European painting but felt that overall, the style was too cold. He sought to bring his Indianness into expressionist works that were inspired by tribal communities, Hindu deities, and other religious iconography. The woman in the painting seems calm, serene albeit for the cracks that belie a darker, somber feeling of loneliness. This yearning for art to convey true feeling rather than technical perfection was Ali’s goal, as he states, “I was more concerned with the heart than the head.”\n\nWilliam Rothenstein (1872-1945)\n\nSix portraits of Sir Rabindranath Tagore, 1915\n\nElla Strong Denison Library, Scripps College, Claremont, CA\n\nEnglish painter, printmaker and writer William Rothenstein had a career that intersected with the rise in Indian nationalism. Rothenstein was a war artist, drew portraits of famous people, and was a witness to the Indian modernist movement. He became enraptured with the Bengali poet and artist Rabindranath Tagore, who started the Santiniketan art school in 1901 to “blend the best of Eastern and Western culture.” Rothenstein sketched the above portraits of Tagore when the poet visited him in London.\n\nRabindranath Tagore (1861-1941)\n\nThe crescent moon: child-poems, 1914\n\nElla Strong Denison Library, Scripps College, Claremont, CA\n\nRabindranath Tagore was a Bengali artist, poet, author, song-composer and playwright. In 1913 he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. Tagore wrote in Bengali, his native language, and his works, including this one, were translated into English. However, layers of symbolism can be lost in translation. For example, “Fairyland” above references the tulsi (holy basil) plant. Commonplace in Indian homes it connotes scenes of domestic beauty to Indian readers but would lose that emotional impact with a Western audience. His nephew, Abanindranath Tagore, created the poem’s accompanying artwork and founded the Bengal School of Arts which trained modernists like Jamini Roy. Rabindranath Tagore’s appreciation for folk culture was reflected in his work. He became a spokesperson for Indian independence abroad and was seminal in defining Indian identity during the 1900s.\n\nBibliography\n\nKumar, R.
