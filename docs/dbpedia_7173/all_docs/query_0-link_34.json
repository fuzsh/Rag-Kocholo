        "text": "Paintings of Bengal&#39; have broad ranges of scopes and perspectives, though historically it faced changes in its meaning in different stages. ‘Paintings of Bengal’ as a genre of art is more or less neglected in the institutional arena due to some reasons including - lags in the possibility of competing with the European style of painting and absence of western standards of aesthetic considerations and pre-colonial classical formulas. The difference between the actual form and appearance of paintings in Bengal can be seen through analyzing current situation compared to the actual scenario from a standard point of view. Considering the similarities and differences between the ancient and the current paintings of Bengal, the course of paintings of Bengal can be understood - where, when, how has it changed or has Bengali painting been going in such a trend since its earliest period of journey? Keeping all these facts in consideration, the write-up has its major objectives to explore t...\n\nThe paper looks at the crucial transformations of cultural and intellectual history of Assam in the wake of the Bengal Renaissance leading to the formation of what can be termed as the 'modernist consciousness of Assam' that had kindled a deep sense of emancipation as well as legacies of ambivalences and destabilities, for it had brought in a fresh wind of progressive social ethos and also warrants of defeat to the vernacular syntax of social and cultural mores. The paper problematises the Renaissance of colonial Bengal not only as instrumental in the formation of a new capital of learning but also as an era of shifting and dislocating of the traditional centres and institutions of power and social pedagogy. The paper underlines that Assam is one such state where the ethos of the Bengal Renaissance has been one of its most significant legacies through which had evolved Assam's transformative rationality of modernism and at the same time, quite significantly, had also been a catalyst to engender cultural disquiet and epistemic anxieties.\n\nThe softness of river line soil has softened our minds, which gave the opportunity for the ancient artists of this most fertile delta of the world, comprised of approximately 700 rivers, to draw coarse lines over muddy surface and to mold any shape by fingers, a hypothetical beginning of art in this land. After Pala consequence, synthesis of Islam and Hinduism in rural culture gave birth of Bengal’s own artistic language during medieval period, where art was something inherent, instinct and intuitive. Folk art was not; even still not iconoclastic but the study of nature is prior to there. Bengal art had been possible only for the thirst to acquire precise negotiation with the surrounding nature. This observation resulted in a metaphysical fancy and was relevant in all forms of art. It represents the emotion of our community, not of the individuals. Thus the artists are lost, in the womb of past but not their arts. Prominence of folk literature had shaped the art of Bengal. From Bengal renaissance to Modernism, it is obvious that all of the artists wanted to search a common answer of a very simple question- what is art of our own! The question echoed in the realm of folk arena, where they all bowed and sought help, got enriched but there were conjoint dissatisfaction too: success without any specific response. Art of Bengal is synonymous to the art of folklore. It was, it is and it will be.\n\nAfter a preparatory phase of nationalist modernism, where the assimilation of the past and the question of identities leading to the boundaries of a national subject was the cultural problematic, the decade of the 40s, with the imminent approach of independence, brought to prominence a modernism in closer contact with the West. That it arose in Bombay, on the West coast, neighboring Gujarat with its long maritime history of intimate relations with the people of West Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe, is thus no surprise. The arrival of Indian independence must be seen in the backdrop of larger world events, such as cultural modernism as a response to modernity and social dispersions as a result of World War II. Both may be seen at work in the presence of a number of European émigré Jews in Bombay at that time, particularly the trio, Walter Langhammer, Emanuel Schlesinger and Rudolf von Leyden, who seeded the artistic culture of the city with a taste for European modernism and patronized the development of an Indian modernism related to this. The Progressive Artist's Group, formed just after Independence, is a result of this new current. In keeping with its peripheral and hybrid cultural history, its founding members included the religious and ethnic minorities of India, an Indian Christian from Goa, two Muslims and a Dalit. They represented the expansive soul of India arising in the new nation, its continuing assimilation of \"the outside\" in a millenia-old process of engagement between monism and pluralism. It should be noted though that this spirit of expansion and adventure did not last long as a local presence in cultural politics, two of its founding members, Souza and Raza, leaving for London and Paris respectively in three years of its starting. It did not fare so well, either, in the majoritarian milieu of the rising nation, with Husain pushed to relinquish his Indian citizenship and ending his days in Doha. But whether in India or outside, the body of works produced by these artists is a testament to the psychic becoming of contemporary India."
