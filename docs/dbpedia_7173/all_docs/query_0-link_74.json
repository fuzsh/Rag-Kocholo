        "text": "GROWING up in Delhi in a small middle class family in the 1980s, I had a desultory and haphazard literary education. At school we read and memorized the words of a jumble of Indian poets, some medieval some modern, some in Hindi some in English, some original some translated. Occasionally we were taught songs in Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi or Tamil  as preparation for our future lives as citizens of secular India, rather than as evidence of any actual knowledge of different cultural worlds within the country.\n\nAs well as the next kid in my class, I could sing a poem by Rabindranath Tagore or Subramania Bharati, but perhaps I had a slight edge, unbeknownst to my classmates and unappreciated even by me at the time. Why? My parents were both professors of literature; my father a widely respected and well recognized Hindi poet. I got by at school, but I was raised in a deeply literary household. Without my realizing it, I soaked up poetry the way my friends soaked up cricket or TV serials  it was the ambient noise in my parents home.\n\nAs I got older, I ended up following the parental example, despite desperate early efforts to branch out into the hard sciences. I studied literature in multiple languages, at universities in India, England and the United States. I developed a better understanding of who my own father was and what he wrote. But even after all this, after a childhood and early youth spent steeped in literature, when I finally turned to Tagore in my mid-thirties, as part of the research for my first book, I felt as though I had opened a secret door into a whole unexpected pleasure garden that I never knew existed right behind my house.\n\nThe nature of the revelation was so profound that it completely consumed two years of my life. I was surprised not just by the mans unending creativity, but also by my own ignorance of and lack of exposure to this great poetic genius of modern India. A committed Indian, a professional scholar of the humanities, and my fathers daughter  how on earth had I missed Rabindranath Tagore for the preceding three decades? A chance conversation with the novelist and critic Amit Chaudhuri, in the late summer of 2008, changed my perspective on Tagore forever.\n\nMy discovery of Tagore reflects, I suspect, a larger truth about the poets reception in contemporary India, 150 years after his birth (in 1861) and 70 years after his death (in 1941). Unless you are born into Bengali bhadralok society, a narrow and insular band of Indias enormous and diverse population, or belong to an even narrower elite across the border in Bangladesh, you might never learn anything significant about Tagore  not even that he wrote the songs that became the national anthems of India and Bangladesh respectively. He is shrouded in the oblivion that sometimes attends the overly famous  everyone knows him, no one knows him.\n\nBengalis listen to a type of cloying, beatless music the rest of us are dimly aware of as being somehow associated with him, but for the most part, it doesnt translate out of Bengali culture, neither as words nor as a musical style. Tagores poetry that one might come across in English sounds vaguely Victorian and thoroughly irrelevant. Occasionally an enormous dusty portrait of the bearded sage might hang mournfully in some seminar room in a government building  Gandhi, Nehru and Ambedkar have long elbowed Tagore off the walls, pillars and podiums of the nations historical consciousness. Even among Indian intellectuals, were it not for the efforts of Tagores later compatriots and eminent alumni of his university like Satyajit Ray and Amartya Sen, it might have been difficult to grasp exactly why this man mattered, why we ought to care.\n\nBut care we must, and care we do, or so the expense and fanfare of Tagores 150th birth anniversary this year might suggest. Conferences, edited volumes, cultural festivals, concerts, exhibitions, newly instituted university chairs, journal issues like this one, articles in newspapers, TV shows, singing schoolchildren  suddenly, in 2011, its as if India has woken up to remember and celebrate its long-lost national poet. Bengalis and non-Bengalis reflect on what Tagore means to them. Prominent Bollywood film stars return to their neglected roots in Bengal. Indians and Bangladeshis living overseas grasp at his memory even harder, as a way to connect to their distant homelands. Historians have a field day with the Bengal Renaissance, otherwise a closed chapter.\n\nLuckily, even after this hubbub has died down, one thing that will remain with us is Harvard University Presss new collection, The Essential Tagore, edited by Fakrul Alam and Radha Chakravarty (2011), soon to appear in its Indian edition from Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan. This important work distils, collects, translates and synthesizes a range of Tagores fiction, prose and poetry, making him once more the contemporary that he ought to have been all along. Prominent contributing translators include Supriya and Sukanta Chaudhuri, Amitav Ghosh and Sunetra Gupta, as well as Amit and Rosinka Chaudhuri, Reba Som, Sudeep Sen and Somdatta Mandal, whose work appears in this issue of Seminar too. The volumes importance is enhanced by its inclusion of scholars from Bangladesh and India, in addition to those based elsewhere  proof that Tagore is a living force in both parts of divided Bengal.\n\nEver since I found Tagore, I began teaching his novel Ghare Baire (The Home and the World), as well as his three essays, collectively titled Nationalism, in my American classroom. Semester after semester, my students have loved him. I have devoted two chapters of my book to the Tagores, Rabindranath and his nephew, the painter Abanindranath. My house is overrun with prints of their artworks, and my collection of Rabindrasangeet CDs has slowly but steadily grown, much to the distress or amusement of those who must live with me. I still cannot read the Bengali script, but I am thinking about learning it soon. I have reconciled myself to the fact that I will never experience the emotional connection to Tagores poems and songs that so many Bengalis feel, because I did not grow up with Tagore the way they did. I do not automatically associate particular seasons, flowers, foods, trees, moods and fragrances with his poetry, nor does he speak to any of the elements of my cultural identity.\n\nAnd yet, if there is one figure in the literary life of modern India who has come to fascinate me in an abiding way, it is Tagore. I have no primordial affinities with him, and any knowledge I crave must be painstakingly acquired, but this much is clear to me: Tagore represents something very important in our history. He stands at the very centre of and yet at an angle to Indias modernity, to nationalism in India, and to any conception of Indian literary traditions. Though he stayed away from mainstream politics, opposed the nation state as a political form, died before independence, and had long-running disagreements with Mahatma Gandhi, Tagore is in the fullest sense a founding father. One may or may not be born into a relationship with Tagore, but such a relationship is important to forge, because it can provide an insight into the very idea of India  itself, incidentally, a Tagorean phrase.\n\n*\n\nIt is hard to think of a single living intellectual in India who approximates Tagores stature, either within the country or internationally. Certainly polymaths like him are rare in any period, but even to find a poet, a painter, an essayist, a fiction writer, any one of these, who might currently be as famous or as influential as Tagore was during his lifetime, is impossible. In one of his pieces of literary criticism, Tagore refers to the poets of the Sanskrit epics as belonging to a race of giants, now extinct  this description could well be applied to him."
