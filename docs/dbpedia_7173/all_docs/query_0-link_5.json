        "text": "Kolkata, Dec 17 (PTI) In a bid to create a nodal center in learning of Sanskrit, a bill was passed in West Bengal Assembly today.\n\nSanskrit College and University, West Bengal Bill 2015 will enable complete up-gradation of the 191 year-old Sanskrit College along with its properties and liabilities.\n\nThe primary objective of the University will be to create a nodal center of study in the field of Sanskrit language, various other Indian languages, Indology, Indian philosophy, comparative literature, humanities and cognitive science, including study in various foreign languages which have close association with Sanskrit.\n\nThe foundation of Sanskrit College was laid during the British regime on a recommendation by James Prinsep and Thomas Babington Macaulay. John Paskal Larkins, a scholar of oracular knowledge laid the foundation stone of the college in 1824, seven years after Presidency College adjacent to the citys famed College Street, known as the Oxford of the East.\n\nIshwar Chandra Vidyasagar, a polymatch and a key figure in Bengal Renaissance had served as the principal of Sanskrit College, which had as its alumni the illustrious artist of Bengal School of Painting Abanindranath Tagore.
