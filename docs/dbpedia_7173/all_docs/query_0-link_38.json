Kolkata was originally three villages - Sutanuti, Gobindapur, and Kalikata - that were purchased by the British East India Company in 1698. The Company developed the area as a trade settlement and presidency city. In 1772, Kolkata became the capital of British India, replacing Murshidabad. It remained the capital until 1911 when the British moved the capital to Delhi. In 1947, Kolkata became part of independent India's West Bengal state and continues to be its capital today.",
