The document discusses painting techniques, specifically washes. It defines a wash as applying a brush with little paint diluted in solvent to a surface to create a smooth, uniform, and semi-transparent area without visible brush strokes. It notes washes can be fragile due to the dilution of the binder in the paint. Watercolor washes are most commonly used due to their longevity when applied to absorbent surfaces like paper.",
