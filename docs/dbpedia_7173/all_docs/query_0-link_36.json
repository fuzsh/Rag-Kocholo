        "text": "Rabindranath Tagore had a sweet voice from his childhood .Thakurbari was always full of literary activities, songs and dramas. But that was amongst the elders, children were not allowed to enter. Dwijendranath, the eldest son of Devendranath, was then writing a Kabya, \"Swapnaprayan\", which he used to recite for others to listen. Rabindranath, standing by the side of the door, listened and learnt the verses by heart. Rabindranath said that he could not remember how he learnt to sing. Sreekantha Singh, a friend of Devendranath and el Singing was his passion. He was always absorbed in music. He was appointed for teaching songs but he did not teach songs, he gave them lessons only. Bishnu Chakraborty was a singer of Adi Brahmo Samaj; he gave them the first lesson in how to sing. Rabindranath did not take regular tuition. Finally, Jadu Bhatta became their vocal music teacher. But Rabindranath learnt singing in his own way- from servants, from gypsy women, from Bauls and from here and there, from whatever he heard. These were the first lessons of Rabindranath before he went into formal education.\n\nHe and the other children had to pass most of their time with Ishwar or to be more precise, Brajeshwar. Once he was a village-teacher. He was entrusted to train the children. At that time there was no electricity, there were Kerosene or other oil lamps. Childrens used to sit around him and hear the stories of Ramayana and Mahabharata in the dim light of the lamp. After dinner, when they went to bed, a maid told them bed time stories of galloping horses on vast stretches of land, till all of them were sound asleep.\n\nRabindranath started his education when he was 3+ [ 1864-1865]. Khagendranath Chattopadhyay wrote , \"he started his education before he was 5 years old.But it was customary at that time even in Tagore's family that education starts after the ceremony of first lesson. Prof. Prabodh Chandra Sen wrote about his first lesson that immediate after he finished alphabets from from his mentor he studied \" sishu Bodhak\" [ Child's Instructor] .\n\nAfter some oral education of songs, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Thakumar Jhuli etc Rabindranah got his first lesson from \"Barnaparichyaya\" from his home tutor Madhab Pandit.Rabindranath had a good memory and quickly finished the spelling lessons of \"KARA, KHALA , JALA etc and came to short sentences --Jala Pare, Pata Nare. By this time his imagination had sparked and he thought that he was gradually entering into the area of \"Adi kabita of Adi Poet\" and the line was continually vibrating through his mind --Jala Pare Pata Nare. Rabindranath was getting his education at home but when he saw that his elder brothers (Somendranath and Satyaprasad) were going to School he began to cry and wanted to go with them. At this Madhab Pandit got angry and slapped him and said that now he was crying for going to school, a time would come when he would cry to avoid going to school.\n\nRabindranath said in his old age that the forecast made by his home tutor was the most accurate that he had come across in his life.\n\nHe was admitted to the Infant Class of Calcutta Training Academy at the end of 1965., Gourmohan Addya established the School. The school was running at that time in the house of Gorachand Basak of Garanhata). This was the first school he attended, along with his elder brothers Somendra and his nephew Satyaprasad. Rabindranath, Somendra (Rabindranath called him DADA) and Satyaprasad went to school together. He could not remember the lesson he got in the Oriental Seminary. He remembered only the punishment a student got for being unable to answer any question about his home task. He was asked to stand up on the bench and extend both of his hands. Then slates, one after another, was kept on his extended hands.\n\nAfter few days, the guardians transferred all the wards to Normal School, where the method of teaching was of European style. The school started after a prayer song. One line in the song was -full of glee, singing merrily, merrily, merrily. This school was established under the guidance of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar in 1855. At that time the School was held in Jorasanko, in the house of Shyamlal Mallik, very close to the Thakur bari.\n\nRabindranath expressed in his \" Jibansmriti\" that he was not happy at the School because of the rough behaviour of the teachers. The behaviour of one of the teachers was so nasty that he refused to answer any of his questions.\n\nBut he secured highest mark in the annual Bengali Examination taken by his Bengali teacher Madhusudan Bachaspati . The Class Teacher could not believe this and he complained to the Headmaster that Madhusudan Babu might have been partial. At this, Rabindranath was re-examined and the superintendant became the invigilator during the examination. The second time also Rabindranath secured the highest mark.\n\nThis was the only known result of an examination taken by Rabindranath during his student life.\n\nRabindranath was admitted to the Normal School at the age of 7 years. Rabindranath wrote a short story, Ginni, remembering this school. After one year when his age was about eight he was forced to write a poem by one of his nephews, Jyotyprakash Gangopadhyaya (1855-1919), son of Kadambini Devi (the eldest sister of Gunendranath). Jyotyprakash was six years older than Rabindranath. He was reading, at that time, English literature, especially Hamlet, and was always reciting the dialogues.\n\nOne day, in the day time, he called Rabindranath and said that he had to write a poem. Jyotyprakash explained to Rabindranath the Payar Chanda containg 14 words in a line.\n\nRabindranath at that stage had seen poetry only in the books. It appeared to him as neat and clean with no overwriting or scribbling in it. There was no hesitation. He could not imagine that he could write such a thing only by his mere will. However, he collected some blue papers with the help of an office staff of Tagore family, drew some lines, running in different directions, and tried to write something with his hand. Somendranath, the brother immediately elder to Rabindranath, became delighted with this and began collecting listeners for Rabindranath's potery. Somendra always encouraged Rabindranath to keep writing poetry and he acted as his oral publisher. One day he caught Nabagopal Babu, the editor of \"National Paper\", and persuaded him to listen. On hearing the poetry, Nabagopal Babu said it was alright but he could not understand the meaning of the word \"DWIREF\". Now the words DWIREF and BHRAMAR, in Bengali, both contained three letters, and why he used the former one and where from he got the word, Rabindranath could not recollect.\n\nGovinda Babu was the superindentent of Normal School. He was short, fat and dark. His office room was on the first floor. One day, Rabindranath entered in his room fearfully to report torture by some of the naughty boys of the school. Govinda Babu took pity on him and one day he called Rabindranath to his room and asked that whether he wrote poetry. Rabindranath was pleased and confirmed the rumour. He asked Rabindranath to write a poem on some difficult topic. Rabindranath did so and brought the poem the next day. Govinda Babu took Rabindranath to the class and told him to read it. Rabindranath recited the poem loudly.\n\nIn 1871, Rabindranath was admitted to the Bengal Academy, an Anglo-Indian School.\n\nIn the year 1872 when he was about 11 years old, he got the opportunity of going out of town for the first time due to a Dengue (1872-1873) epidemic in Calcutta.\n\nAll of them went to a garden-house at Panihati near the Ganges. In front of the servant's quarter there was a guava tree and through two of its branches Rabi could see large boats sailing in the Ganges.\n\nThat blue coloured copy book was gradually being filled up with poetry and he always welcomed the news of its circulation.\n\nSatkari Dutta was not a teacher in the class where Rabindranath was reading but he was sympathetic to Rabindranath. One day he asked Rabindranath that whether he wrote poetry. On hearing in the affirmative he gave him two lines and asked him to fill up next two lines; Rabindranath did this nicely. Thus he gradually became known as a poet and he got a new avenue in his life which he maintained till his death.\n\nThis time his third elder brother Hemendranath, a good student in Science, was in charge of supervising their all round development. He narrated a daily routine to be followed by every body from morning till night. In the morning , after rising from bed, they had to practice wrestling with an one eyed wrestler. Then they had to take their lessons with all the muds and sands in their body. The home tutors for Bengali, Mathematics, History and Geography would come. Then they had to go to school. After coming back from the school, at about four, they had to attend drawing classes with the drawing-master and then Gymnastics. In the evening followed English lessons. At this time they were about to fall asleep and the elder Brother Dwijendranath on seeing this allowed them to go to bed. Rabi , at this opportunity, used to go to his mother's room.\n\nEvery Sunday, Science teacher used to come with the apparatus for demonstrations. Rabi happened to get interested The passion, Rabindranath had for science, was due to this. Moreover, for training in the Bengali literature Meghnadbadkabya was chosen. Rabindranath wrote a critical review of this book which was published in \".Bharati\".\n\nThe boys had to leave Normal School and be admitted in Bengal Academy, an European School, for their training in English. Here Rabindranath got a . Rabindranath has mentioned his name in his book.\n\nThe interest of Rabindranath Tagore developed in books rather than in his study materials. He took books from his elder brother, Dwijendranath's library e.g., \"Abodhbandhu\" and Bividharta Sangraha. Rabindranath beacame a fan of poet Biharilal Chakraborty.\n\nIn 1872, at the age of eleven, Rabindranath finished \"Bangadarshan\" from beginning to the end."
