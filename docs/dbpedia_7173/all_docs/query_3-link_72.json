The initiative came in the later half of the 19th century from Calcutta-based M.D. turned homeopath, Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar, and resulted in the establishment of Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science in 1876. We place this initiative in the broader context of the transfer of Hindu community leadership from the landed class to the professional, and critically examine how the colonial government responded to it. We also discuss the achievements and the failures of the science movement in the 19th century. Given the class composition of the native leadership, science speculation was preferred to science application. While the Science Association succeeded in creating a general awareness about science and getting it incorporated into the university system, it failed to initiate basic research under its own auspices. It would be UK-trained government college professors who would place India on the world science map. We briefly touch upon how India’s attitude towards modern science has been fashioned by the colonial experience.\n\nKeywords: India – colonialism – English education – cultivation of science – Bengal middle class -19th century\n\nPACS Nos. 01.65+g, 01.75.+m\n\nFriends.-It is a matter of great pleasure and honour for me that I have been asked to deliver the Akshoy Datta Memorial Lecture. I am particularly elated that the lecture is named after Akshoy Datta (1820-1886). If Mahendra Lal Sircar was a man of science, Datta was a man of scientific methodology. In his time Sircar received donations from many rich men. But if we view the donation as a fraction of the total assets owned then Datta is the most generous benefactor of this institution.\n\nIndian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata, today is a well respected modern scientific laboratory. To scholars, historians and laypersons alike the Science Association (founded 1876) is well known as the laboratory where Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman (1888-1970) did his experimental work that fetched him the 1930 Nobel physics prize. The dazzle of the prize has made it difficult to make an objective assessment of the early years of the Science Association which had been in existence for thirty tortuous years before Raman set foot in it in 1907. Many published accounts of the Association’s history tend to give the impression that the sole purpose of its establishment was to wait for Raman to bring glory to it half a century later. An individual award is an accident. No matter how happy it cannot be a factor in the historical assessment of an institution.\n\nThe Science Association succeeded in getting science introduced into the higher education system and motivating better-quality students for a career in science rather than in law or government service. It also provided high-ranking European government officials a glimpse of scientific activities back home. It however failed in its avowed goal to create cultural interest in scientific topics in public at large. Nor could it initiate scientific research under purely Indian auspices. It would be UK-trained professors employed in a government college (Presidency College, Calcutta), Jagadis Chunder Bose1 (1858–1937) and Prafulla Chandra Ray (1861-1944), who would place India on the world science map twenty years later.\n\nThe Science Association came up during what were conflicting times for Bengal. The native leadership was still in the hands of the landed class (represented by the British India Association; see below) which was coming under increasing pressure to yield place to the new self-made middle class. Science Association represents the first ever Indian initiative for a middle class organization. Since it was in the name of science it could seek and obtain goodwill and support from the government as well as the landed class. Its formation was accompanied by that of a political organization with a similar name and involving more or less the same people: Indian Association. (That would explain the rather odd name for a science institute.) As is well known the Indian Association became the precursor of the Indian National Congress.\n\nIf science historians have examined the Science Association in romanticized isolation, students of political history have ignored it altogether. Here my aim is to try to place the Science Association in a wider context. What was the philosophy enunciated to justify it? How did the colonial government respond to it? What were the circumstances under which it was set up? What arguments were proffered to defend it? What did science mean to the late 19th century Bengal middle class? These are important questions that have a bearing on modern India’s approach towards science. An attempt will be made to address these and related questions.\n\nThe Science Association was founded by Dr Mahendra Lal Sircar2 (2 November 1833 – 23 February 1904) who remained its general secretary till his death. The presidentship was held ex-officio by the Lieutenant-Governor3 while the Viceroys agreed to become the patron4. Sircar owed his station in life to western education. A Calcutta University M.D. – turned homeopath, Sircar was the first Indian public figure to acquaint himself with the happenings in Europe on the scientific front; to introduce modern science into the collective Indian consciousness; and seek to invert the use of the race theory hitherto employed by the British to legitimize their rule. The view expressed in 1900 by Sir William Lee-Warner5, former acting director of public instruction, Berar and Bombay, in what was obviously a prescribed school text can be taken to be prevalent throughout the 19th century: “From the West which owes so much in the past to the Aryan race, India has in turn received freedom, free speech, free trade, free movement”. Sircar wanted modern science to be added to the list\n\nColonial science\n\nIt may be no more than a coincidence that the British merchant ships arrived in India the same year (1608) telescope was invented in the Netherlands. But it does bring home the fact that modern science and technology have grown hand in hand with maritime activity, colonial expansion and Western domination over nature and fellow human beings. The British could not have built and retained an empire in India without the help of science and the natives. This brought Indians in touch with modern science. The phenomenon can be conveniently discussed in terms of a three-stage model comprising the colonial-tool stage, the peripheral-native stage, and the Indian response stage, each leading to and coexisting with the next6.\n\nThe colonial-tool stage began with field surveys and went on to include technologies such as steam, telegraph, railway and radio. The Western scientific interest in the subcontinent was latitude- driven in the sense that it was dictated by the geographical and ecological novelty of India. (In contrast the current software-facilitated globalization – era Western interest in India is longitude- driven.) The institutionalization of science as a colonial tool began in 1767 with the appointment of a surveyor-general in Bengal7. Ironically when we celebrate anniversaries of scientific institutions like the Trigonometrical Survey, Geological Survey or railways we are also unwittingly celebrating step-wise entrenchment of the British in India.\n\nThe peripheral-native stage can be taken to have begun in 1817 with the founding of the Hindoo College in Calcutta (see below). In this stage the Indians were assigned the peripheral role of providing cheap labour to the colonial science machinery. The peripheral native stage can be illustrated with the help of three biographies: Ardaseer Cursetjee (1808-1877); Radhanath Sickdhar (1813-1870) and Seebchunder Nandy (1822-1903). Sickdhar entered the Hindoo College Calcutta in 1824 and joined the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1831 at Mussoorie as a computer. He was one of the six boys so appointed but he is the only one who rose to make a mark. In 1843 he was transferred to Calcutta to take charge of the computational office there. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1853.\n\nSickdhar was held in very high esteem for his mathematical abilities by George Everest as well as his successor Andrew Waugh. Everest recorded in 1835 that Sickdhar “received an exceedingly good elementary education in mathematics…which he …had the good sense considerably to extend”. He was given a personal monthly allowance of Rs 100 to dissuade him from leaving the Survey. On his part Sickdhar noted with pride that Everest admitted him “in his own table”8. The following letter written by Lieutenant Colonel Walter Stanhope Sherwill of Scotland and published in The Friend of India in 1876 makes interesting reading. “A friend has just sent me a copy of the Friend of India of the 24th June, all the way from Germany, in order that I might be made acquainted with the sad fact that, when bringing out a third edition of “Smyth and Thuillier’s Manual of Surveying for India,” the much respected name of the late Babu Radhanath Sikdar, the able and distinguished head of the computing department of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, who did so much to enrich the early editions of the “Manual,” had been advertently, or inadvertently, removed from the preface of the last edition; while at the same time all the valuable matter written by the Babu had been retained, and that without any acknowledgment as to the authorship.\n\nAs an old Revenue Surveyor who used the “Manual” for a quarter of a century, and as an acquaintance of the late Radhanath Sikdar, I feel quite ashamed for those who have seen fit to exclude his name from the present edition, especially as the former Editors so fully acknowledged the deep obligations under which they found themselves for Radhanath’s assistance, not only for the particular portion of the work “which they desire thus publicly to acknowledge – so runs the preface of the 1851 edition, – but for the advice so generally afforded on all subjects connected with his own department.\n\n” Yesterday only I mentioned the circumstance of the omission of Radhanath’s name to one of the Tagores, an old and intimate friend of Radhanath’s and who is now travelling in Scotland; he was pained beyond measure, but made the significant remark “you see, he is a dead man”9.\n\nSickdhar’s “hobby was beef, as he maintained that beef-eaters were never bullied, and that the right way to improve the Bengalees was to think first of the physique or perhaps physique and moral simultaneously”10. He certainly had moral courage. Whether it was due to beef or not is difficult to say. In 1843 he stubbornly confronted an English magistrate on the latter’s maltreatment of “paharee coolies”. Although the colonial administration fined him Rs 200 for his “criminal” action he was hailed as a hero by his countrymen11.\n\nNandy joined the Calcutta Mint in 1846. When in 1852 the Company decided to construct telegraph lines in India under the superintendence of Dr William O’Shaughnessy (1809-1889), Nandy became his assistant. By the end of 1856 India had 4,250 miles of electric telegraph and 46 receiving offices. “During the Mutiny of 1857 he [Nandy] rendered excellent service, sometime acting as head of the Telegraph Department’s headquarters; and in order to secure the communication between Calcutta and Bombay, he laid down a portion of the alternate line from Mirzapur to Seoni via Jubblepore”12. As Sir John Lawrence (1811-1879), Chief Commissioner of Punjab and later India’s Viceroy during 1864-1869, put it matter- of- factly: “Telegraph saved India”, for the British that is. Nandy was made a Rai Bahadur in 1902 and Calcutta named a lane after him conveniently calling it “the Sibu Nandy Lane”13 no doubt to avoid using his anglicized spellings.\n\nBombay-based Cursetjee, a scion of the Wadia shipbuilding family, had a natural flair for engineering. He even assisted Arthur Bedford Orlebar, professor of natural philosophy at the Elphinstone College, “in instructing the natives, especially in mechanical and chemical science”14. Introduction of steam in 1829 necessitated the upgradation of native skills. “The prompt repair of the engines of the numerous steamers arriving in Bombay posed a problem. Few of the European engineers and drivers could withstand the climate, and those who were enabled to do so proved so troublesome that a remedy for the inconvenience appeared of paramount importance.”15 The remedy was Ardaseer Cursetjee, then an assistant builder at the dock, who was officially sponsored to visit England. Duly trained and networked, he was appointed Chief Engineer and Inspector of Machinery at the Company’s factory and foundry in Bombay in 1840. It was noted in the press that a “body of English workmen” would be under his charge. In 1841 he became the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of the Royal society of London. Of course the Society was then more a gentleman’s club than the learned body it became later. The distinction however does not seem to have made any impact in India. Bombay was perhaps too practical to make sense of an honour bestowed in London while it was too early for Calcutta to be interested16. The Wadias’ familiarity with steam had far reaching consequences. It led to the mechanization of Indian textile industry. Ardaseer’s grandson Nowrosjee Nusserwanjee (1849-1899) who as a young boy had been dispatched “to school in Liverpool and for factory training” set up the Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Company in 1879, and then the Century Mills which subsequently changed hands17.\n\nIn course of time the Indians, educated and trained under colonial auspices, developed a world perspective on the benefits the West was deriving from science and decided to join the world club of science as equals. Science Association marks the beginning of the Indian response stage. Here we generally use the term native to refer to Indians in a subservient role. The term Indian is employed when there is exercise of, or desire to exercise, free will.\n\nTwo early examples of native contribution to basic science deserve mention. In 1850 Master Ramachandra (1821-1880) of Delhi College published a mathematical text A Treatise on Problems of Maxima and Minima solved by Algebra. The famous British mathematician Augustus De Morgan was much impressed by it. He saw in it “not merely merit worthy of encouragement, but merit of a peculiar kind, the encouragement of which was likely to promote native effort towards the restoration of the native mind in India”18. The book was reprinted in London in 1859 with a foreword by De Morgan. Additionally, the Company “were pleased to sanction a khillūt (dress of honour) of five pieces to be presented to him and also a reward of Rs. 2000” 19. “Encouraged by such appreciation” Ramachandra published in 1861 his second work A New Method of the Differential Calculus. Much to the horror of the native communities, Ramachandra converted to Christianity in 1852. He would have been killed in 1857 if he had not been saved by his friends and former students. “ Since he was by far the most advanced in English studies, it was inevitable that his name should be held up for a warning, as to what results might happen if the English language were allowed to be taught to the young”20. His impact on modern science in India remained non-existent21.\n\nIn distant Madras Chintamani Ragoonatha Charry (d.1880) joined Madras Observatory as a young boy and rose to discover a variable stars R Reticuli. This was the first recorded astronomical discovery by an Indian. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 187222. In their time both Ramachandra and Ragoonatha Charrry were presented as proof of colonial success in improving the natives.\n\nA myth was created in the 1930s, when Sickdhar had been dead for more than six decades, that the height of Mount Everest was calculated by him23. The implication is that he was cheated of due credit by the colonialists. This is patently wrong. “Official records clearly show” that the “computations which determined the position and height of the highest mountain of the world” were carried out at Dehra Dun, when Sickdhar was already in Calcutta24. Why was the myth created and why has it persisted? There can be no doubt that Sickdhar was the father of mathematical techniques in surveying in India. His contribution was sought to be dramatized by associating his name with the very pinnacle of century-long surveying operations. By the 1930s the discontent against the British had become quite pronounced. Rewriting the 19th century was part of attempts to fuel the 20th century anger. As we shall see later a similar myth was created about Jagadis Bose’s being denied the Nobel prize. Persistence of such myths even today, evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, arises out of our current disappointment at missed opportunities in science.\n\nEnglish education\n\nThe British Parliament first took notice of the Indian possessions in 1773 with the grant of a Charter to the Company. The Charter would come up for review and renewal every twenty years preceded by intense lobbying. The last Charter was issued in 1853. Thus all major initiatives on India occurred in the years 1773+20n where n ranged from zero to four. India was taken over by the Crown in 1858 bringing to an end the most bizarre experiment in governance the world had ever seen. (The Company was finally disbanded in 1873.)\n\nIndia was a nice country to own but its people could not be wished away. India was already a thickly populated country. Large-scale European settlements were not possible especially because an industrializing England required its manpower for itself. Also after the disastrous Portuguese experiment and the bloody Haitian revolution in 1790 mixed marriages were ruled out. There was thus no alternative to training the natives to take up lower-level administrative jobs. In addition there was this desire to civilize them. In 1793 when a bill for English education for the natives (and for missionary activity) was introduced in the British Parliament the Court of Directors opposed it and got if defeated. Among the influential persons consulted by the Company was the barrister , Randle Jackson, who brazenly blamed the secession of the American colonies to the English folly in opening schools and colleges there and warned the Directors “to avoid and steer clear of the rock we had split on in America”25. Twenty years later the Parliament did pass a resolution saying that “such measures ought to be adopted, as may tend to the introduction among them [natives of India] of useful knowledge, and of religious and moral improvement”26. The Parliament further directed an annual expenditure of “not less than one lakh of rupees” on the education of the natives. The Charter also ended the Company’s monopoly of trade with India which was now open to all. This enabled Europeans and Indians to collaborate in making money together through trade.\n\nThe Company was in no hurry to comply with the educational clause. It was only in 1817 when the Mahratta power was broken and the British grip on India became unassailable that the Governor-General, Lord Hastings , could loftily declare “that the Government of India did not consider it necessary to keep the Natives in a state of ignorance, in order to retain its own power”27. The same year the native leadership in Calcutta, encouraged and supported by the British officials and non-officials, collected a handsome amount of more than a hundred thousand rupees to found a private institution called the Hindoo College (the school section) for “the tuition of sons of respectable Hindoos”, respectability being measured in term of the ability of the parents to pay a monthly fee of the then princely sum of five rupees28. How high the fee was can be gauged from the following incident. About the same time Iswarchandra Vidyasagar’s (1820-1891) would-be father Thakurdas came to Calcutta at the age of fifteen in search of employment. “After a good deal of hardship he secured a job which carried a monthly pay of Rs. 2. His meritorious service soon earned him a rise in pay to Rs 5 per month. But in those days a rupee would go very far. Thus ended the days of misery of the family”, which comprised his mother, four sisters and a brother29. In 1817 itself the School Book Society was established “for the preparation, publication and cheap or gratuitous supply of works in schools and seminaries of learning in English and oriental languages, but not to furnish religious books”30.\n\nThe benefit of English education was soon extended to poor Hindu boys through the efforts of David Hare (1775-1842) and others31 by the establishment of Calcutta School Society in 1818. Government grants were forthcoming for the education of native elites only from 1823 with the establishment of a General Committee of Public Instruction in Calcutta and corresponding committees elsewhere. British India was the first country in modern times to provide state funding for education. The peculiarity of the Indian case can be gauged from the fact that while the aid in the Western countries was meant to benefit the poor, in India it went to the upper classes. Hindoo College started receiving government32 aid in 1823 under official supervision and was taken over by the government in 1855 as Presidency College. It is significant that for three decades the government was aiding an educational institution meant strictly for a particular community. Unlike the Hindus, especially in Bengal, the Muslims were not keen on English education. In 1826 the Company “sanctioned the opening of an institution in Murshidabad for the education of the members of the Nizamat family”, but they refused to “embrace the opportunity”33. Maulvi Nazir Ahmad’s (1833-1912) father sent him from Bijnor to Delhi to study traditional Islamic sciences. The father permitted Nazir to accept a stipend from Delhi College on the condition that he not learn English. Nazir Ahmad learnt English later and rose to become a deputy collector34.\n\nSir Mountstuart Elphinstone (1779-1859), who annexed the Peshva territory and was the Governor of the Bombay Presidency during 1819-1827, had “a pile of printed Mahratta books” in his tent. When asked about them, he said that they were “To educate the natives”, adding that, “but it is our high road back to Europe”. When asked why he then insisted on the native education, Elphinstone’s reply was that “We are bound, under all circumstances, to do our duty to them” 35. In 1838 Sir Charles Edwards Trevelyan (1807-1886), a Company civil servant and brother-in-law of Lord Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800-1859), noticed “by actual observation and experience” two sets of ideas prevailing among the natives. In parts of India “where, owing to the comparative novelty of our rule and in the absence of any attempt to alter the current of native feeling”, people wanted “the sudden and absolute expulsion of the British”. Trevelyan was thus anticipating the 1857. The educated natives in Bengal, he noted, stood in sharp contrast. “Instead of thinking of cutting the throats of the English, they were aspiring to sit with them on the grand jury, or on the bench of the Magistrates”, “all of them being fully sensible that these plans of improvement could only be worked out with the aid and protection of the British Government by the gradual improvement of their countrymen in knowledge and morality”, requiring “a long continuation of our administration, and the gradual withdrawal of it as people became fit to govern themselves”36.\n\nInherent in the British rule over India was the slow and increasingly reluctant training of the Indians to eventually overthrow that role. The strategy can be said to have been eminently successful. The British rule lasted close to two centuries and when the colonialists left they did so with tremendous goodwill. Bengal occupied a special place in this scheme of things. The British transformation from a vaishya (trading) outfit into a kshatriya (ruling) organization began in Bengal which became British India’s biggest and the richest province. Calcutta, the capital of British India since 1774, understandably received special treatment. Of the total amount spent on education in the 18 year period 1813-1830 as much as 76% was disbursed in the Bengal Presidency, 19% in Bombay and only 5% in Madras37. The pre-eminence of Bengal, more specifically Calcutta, as recipient of government educational grant would continue throughout38 and play an important role in initiating basic scientific research here by the Indians.\n\nNew Bengal social class\n\nMadras (founded 1639) and Bombay (acquired 1668) both lay off the political map of the time; that is why the Company could own them. But Calcutta (founded 1690) came with its vast hinterland. Here the Company entered the Indian mainstream. Beginning with the 1698 purchase of the petty zamindari of the three Calcuttan villages, Sutanati, Govindpur and Dihi-Kolkata, from the Mughal administration39, the Company worked its way upwards and ended up owning the country itself. Since the Company was replacing Muslim rulers, the Hindus were favourably inclined towards it. (In western India the British would face the odium of deposing Brahmin rulers.) Also in Bengal the British had the convenience of dealing with a social class they themselves had created and which owed its wealth, social status and native leadership position to its association with the British40. (In contrast, elsewhere in the country the British would have to come to terms with the pre-existing social elites which had their own notions of prestige and self-importance.)\n\nNot only did the British create a new social class they also invented a new India for it to dwell in and dwell on. This was the Indologist’s India as distinct from the artisan’s India. While Europe through the telescope, microscope, maritime voyages and geographical explorations was discovering for itself that knowledge did not lie in churches, archives and the past but in the open and in the future, India was seduced into defending an ancient culture which in its time had belonged to a small segment of appropriators of wealth but was now presented as if it were representative of the whole country. It is noteworthy that in the early years the European officials did take interest in traditional Indian technology (wootz steel, dyes, variolation, etc., 41 but the phase soon passed. No Indian in the 19th or early century seems to have paid any heed to this aspect of India. The Hindus were introduced to what we may call archivalism.\n\nThe physical foundations of the British empire in India may have been laid at Plassey but the legitimacy for it came from the Asiatick Society type of researches (Old spellings have been advisedly used).Fortunately for the British at the very beginning of their rule over India there came the discovery of Indo-European linguistic commonality then interpreted in purely racial terms. It was famously enunciated in 1786 by the founder president of the Asiatick Society, Sir William Jones (1746-1794). Jones declared that Sanskrit, Greek and Latin “sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists”. He went on to assert that “there is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the Gothic and the Celtic, though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the Sanscrit”42.\n\nOrientalism43 which would be confrontational in the Muslim world was seductive, persuasive and interactive in India where it took the form of Indo-Europeanism44. Indo – Europeanism “placed in the hands of the British Government a powerful instrument of connexion and conciliation” with the (upper-caste) Hindus. The thesis went like this. Both the Europeans and the upper-caste Hindus belonged to the Aryan race, while the Muslims were the other. The British rule set up by defeating the Muslims was therefore a restoration. The Hindus had had their period of glory in the ancient past when the Europeans were still barbarians; now it was the turn of their European brethren to rule ( see below).\n\nThe British interest in ancient India liberated Sanskrit from the custody of the priestly class and transformed the scriptures into books of civilization. The European discovery of the glory of ancient India raised self esteem of the new Indian middle class. The introduction of Western law and modern medicine for reasons of administration and good governance made a significant impact on the natives. These inherently egalitarian disciplines planted the concepts of human equality and dignity in native minds. Indeed lawyers and medicos would play a leading role in the nationalist movements. The Aryan race theory gave legitimacy not only to European domination over India but also to upper-caste domination within India. Just as the English-knowing class raised itself in the social scale within India with the British help45, it next wanted British help in raising India in the scale of nations under its own leadership46. The lead came in the 1870s from Dr. Mahendralal Sircar.\n\nMahendra Lal Sircar: Life sketch\n\nOur major source of biographical information on Sircar is Sarat Chandra Ghose, a fellow homeopath, who first published an obituary of Sircar in 1904 in the ninth volume of The Hindustan Review and Kayastha Samachar. This was expanded into a book in 1909 the second edition of which appeared in 193547. This is a valuable source which unfortunately has not been fully tapped by self-conscious historians because of its homeopathic orientation. Assuringly, its contents are entirely consistent with Sircar’s obituary published in the journal he himself had founded, Calcutta Journal of Medicine. Although the author’s name is not given it is presumably his son Dr Amrita Lal Sircar (1860-1919)48. A brief scientific biography of Sircar was published by G.A. Natesan in 192949. Except for a few minor discrepancies, it agrees with and is complementary to Amrita Lal’s and Ghose’s works on which it is no doubt based. Another valuable primary source is the collection of personal diaries covering the period 1873-1899 with some interruptions by Mahendra Lal Sircar and Amrita Lal Sircar. They have been recently brought to light by Arun Kumar Biswas who has selectively quoted from them50.\n\nSircar was born on 2 November 1833 in a poor family in a small village Paikpara some 30 km west of Howrah. He described himself “as a man of the people sprung from the actual tillers of the soil”51. When he was five years old his mother brought him and his younger six-month old brother to her own brothers’ house in Nebutola in Calcutta. A few days after his arrival in Calcutta the death of his father occurred at Paikwara. The family went back for the last rites but soon returned to Calcutta for good. If Sircar’s mother had to shift with her sons to her brothers’ place even when her husband was alive the family must have been extremely poor52. The mother also died four years later, due to cholera, leaving the orphaned boy in the care of his maternal uncles who themselves were not well off. A brilliant student, young Sircar received support from a number of people whom he always remembered with a sense of gratitude. He was sent to a traditional pathshala for learning Bengali and to a tutor for English. At the age of seven he was admitted to David Hare’s School where he received free education53.\n\nSircar finished school in 1849 with a junior scholarship to go to the Hindoo College where he won a senior scholarship. Sircar did not think much of the Hindoo College where “the principal object of education was to teach the pupils how to read and write the English language”. His “fierce passion for science” made him shift to the Medical College, “the only place in those days where the students were given practical lessons in some of the more important sciences”54. “Dr Mahendra Lal Sircar originally had no intention to study medicine…his favourite subject was Psychology. There are a great many problems involved in the study of Psychology, which cannot be well understood without a knowledge of Biology. He did not get satisfactory explanation of many such points from his professors. He therefore decided to join the Medical College to study for himself the science of Biology…”55\n\nSircar joined the Medical College in early 1854 and passed the Licentiate in Medicine and Surgery examination in 1860. In the meantime Calcutta University was set up in 1857. In 1862 Sircar successfully wrote to the University saying that his senior scholarship certificate be recognized as B.A. diploma to enable him to sit for the M.D. examination56. He got his M.D. in 1863 in first class. As a private practitioner Sircar was able to translate his academic brilliance into professional, financial and social success. When in 1863 the Bengal chapter of the British Medical Association was opened through the efforts of Dr. Goodeve Chuckerbutty, Sircar became an active member57. After serving as its secretary for three years he became a vice-president in 1867. However much to the shock of his colleagues and former teachers he took to homeopathy under the influence of Rajendra Lal Dutt58 (1818-1889) then a millionaire merchant and himself an accomplished practitioner. Sircar boldly announced his conversion in February 1867 from the august platform of the Medical Association itself for which sin he was unceremoniously thrown out59.\n\nA dejected but determined Sircar declared to himself: “I am a farmer’s son and will better live by humble work, but what I have known as truth must be told and worked upon”60. After an initial setback Sircar was soon able to establish a very successful and high-priced practice. In September 1874 he increased his fee for a single prescription in Calcutta from Rs. 10 to Rs 16. Subsequently it was further raised to a whopping Rs 3261. In 1875 he was charging as much as Rs 500 per day for an outstation visit62. He was consulted by many eminent, rich and influential personages of his time including the greatly revered mystic Ramakrishna Paramhans63. Sircar’s medical contacts would stand him in good stead in his later fund-raising drive.\n\nHe was made a Companion of the Indian Empire in 1883 by the popular liberal Viceroy Lord Ripon. This was the beginning of Sircar’s social rise. Sircar was appointed sheriff of Calcutta in 1887. He served as an honorary presidency magistrate for 25 years 1887-1902 when ill health forced him to resign. He was a nominated member of the Bengal Legislative Council from 1887 to 1893. He remained an elected commissioner of the Calcutta Corporation for several years and made his mark on the Municipal Board especially in the department of sanitation. For many years he was a trustee of the Indian Museum as a representative of the Asiatic Society64. In 1899 he was invited to give evidence before the Indian Plague Commission65.\n\nHe had a long association with the Calcutta University66. He was appointed a Fellow of the University in the Faculty of Arts for life with effect from 187167. For ten successive years he was a member of the Syndicate and frequently acted as its president in the absence of the Vice-Chancellor. He was also for four successive years, 1893-1897, president of the Faculty of Arts (Buckland II: 1065). The University in 1898 bestowed on him the honorary degree of doctor not in science, but law, for “his labours in the cause of science” and for his service to the University.\n\nNotwithstanding the honours bestowed on him, non-acceptance of his homeopathic credentials by the mainstream rankled him. As an influential member of the Calcutta University Senate he persuaded it to transfer him from the Arts to the Medical Faculty. Persistently hostile reaction from the latter forced him to revert back. It would be instructive to discuss the episode at some length because the published historical research seems to find the whole thing rather embarrassing and has tended to shove it under the carpet. The episode has been discussed in Sircar’s homeopathic biography68 with a sense of injury. Understandably, the emphasis here is on Sircar’s representations in defence of homeopathy than in the University proceedings. A fuller version is attempted below.\n\nRebuff from the Medical Faculty\n\nWhen the Calcutta University Senate held its first meeting of the fiscal year 1878-79 on 27 April 1878, it had a routine item on the agenda, namely, the adoption of the annual report of the Syndicate for the past year. Babu Kali Charan Banerjee and Rev. K.M. Banerjee proposed an innocuous-looking amendment that “Dr Mahendralal Sircar’s name should be added to the list of members of the Faculty of Medicine given in the report”. The report, “subject to this amendment” was duly passed by the Senate. Interestingly, Sircar was present at the meeting69.\n\nThe matter then went to the ten-member Faculty of Medicine which included an Indian, Munshi Tamiz Khan, Khan Bahadur. It met on 15 May 1878 to unanimously pass a resolution bluntly declaring that “they are unable to associate themselves as a Faculty of Medicine with a member who professes and practices Homeopathy; an inability of which probably the Senate were not aware when the nomination was made; hey trust. Therefore, that the Syndicate may be able to remove the present difficulty by the transfer of Dr Mahendralal Sircar’s name to another Faculty or in some other manner”. Sircar protested by addressing a long letter to the Registrar, defensively adding that “As men of Science they [Medical Faculty] should have been more accurate in their language, especially when they sat to condemn a professional brother”70. Sircar’s use of the phrase professional brother is interesting. The point precisely was that the Medical Faculty did not wish to include him in their brotherhood.\n\nSircar’s letter was discussed by the Senate on 13 July 1878 at a meeting specially called for the purpose. It passed a resolution requesting “the Faculty of Medicine to re-consider the resolution come to at their last meeting with special reference to Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar’s letter now read”71. The Medical Faculty met on 23 July 1878 to discuss the matter. It now had two Indian members Tamiz Khan as before and Rai Kanailal De, Bahadur [also spelt Dey]. They unanimously reiterated their earlier decision, pointing out that having a homeopath on the Faculty will “deteriorate the value of the University Medical degrees” and cause “serious loss” to “all present and future Medical Graduates”, and will be “to the manifest discredit of the University in public estimation”.\n\nThis brought forth another long reply from Sircar which was placed before the Senate on 31 August 1878. There was a strong worded proposal from the medical members asking the Senate to rescind its earlier order transferring Sircar to the Medical Faculty. A counter–proposal came from Dr Rajendralala Mitra72 and Dr K. M. Banerjee saying that Sircar’s letter and the Faculty’s proceedings be put on record. This was put to vote and passed73. In other words the Senate’s earlier decision to transfer Sircar to the medical Faculty stood. Sircar’s victory however was pyrrhic74.\n\nOn 2 September 1878 “Dr Partridge and seven other members” (presumably all European) resigned from the Faculty. They were individually informed “that they [the Syndicate] have no power to accept the resignation by any member of the Senate of the Faculty to which he belongs”. The resigning members surely knew the legal position. There aim was to exert pressure. The message indeed went home. On 7 September 1878 just before the Syndicate met, Dr Sircar handed a letter on the basis of which he was transferred from the Faculty of Medicine to that of Engineering75. Perhaps this transfer was a face-saving device, because Sircar does not seem to have attended any meetings. Eventually he went back to the Faculty of Arts76, because we find him as its president 1893-1897. A quick perusal of the University proceedings has failed to reveal any clues as to when exactly he returned to Arts. It would be useful to ascertain the precise date. It is noteworthy that although he did not belong to the Medical Faculty he did serve as an examiner for Medical College examinations, as can be seen from the Syndicate proceedings. On 26 March 1896 he wrote to the University declining to serve as the president or as a member of the Syndicate for reasons of health. (Interestingly in spite of Sircar’s own commitment to and public defence of homeopathy it was not taught at the Science Association although Hahnemann’s anniversary was celebrated.)\n\nScience Association: Manifesto\n\nWithin a year of his conversion to homeopathy, Sircar founded in January 1868 a journal called the Calcutta Journal of Medicine with the object of popularizing his new creed. It was billed as “a monthly record of medical and auxiliary sciences”. In the issue brought out on 8 December 1869 (though nominally dated August 1869) Sircar published an essay entitled “On the desirability of a national institution for the cultivation of the Sciences by the natives of India”. The essay was published separately as a pamphlet. This is an historically important document. It sought to use Indo-Europeanism to Indians’ own advantage77.\n\nSircar begins by citing an article “On the teaching of natural science in schools” published in the July 1869 issue of the (British) Quarterly Journal of Science. He then makes an unnecessary digression charging the whole of Europe with being uncivilized by definition because “Until men should learn to respect each other’s honest convictions, and until they should be free from all prejudice, in other words, be fearless of the consequences of the discoveries in the fields of knowledge, they cannot be said to have become civilized men”. This diatribe seems to be directed against critics of homeopathy.\n\nSircar then comes to his main thesis where he makes the first Indian use of the race theory. Where did he get his inputs from? The British journal which he quoted from was barely six years old. Sircar would presumably have read the 23-page-long editorial in the inaugural issue (1864) describing the benefits Britain had derived from science and technology in various fields. The editorial declares that “All questions…concerning the connection or differences between the various races of mankind, will receive the earnest considerations of the writers in this Journal”, because these questions are “par excellence questions of the day”. The editorial disapprovingly refers to the view expressed by the president and the secretary of geographical and ethnological section at the 1863 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, “that the Negro is inferior, intellectually, to the European” and further that “whenever intellectual superiority exists in a man of colour, he is always found to have an admixture of white blood in his veins” (The editorial made it a point to protect its own liberal credentials by pointing out “that the gentlemen who thus sought to denigrate the Negro race, were the tools of the Southern Confederacy and had been enlisted as the champions of slavery in England”.)\n\nSircar became a life member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1864. If he had at hand its earlier proceedings he would have been familiar with Max Muller’s paper, entitled “On the relation of the Bengali to the Arian and aboriginal languages of India”, which was read at the 1847 meeting. Max Muller argued that Indians are “one great branch of the Caucasian race, differing from other branches of the same race merely by its darker complexion”. He stated that “it is curious to see how the [English] descendents of the same [Arian] race, to which the first conquerors and masters of India belonged, return …to accomplish the glorious work of civilization, which had been left unfinished by their Aryan brethren”78.\n\nThe phrase Aryan brethren, Max Muller’s own coinage, profoundly influenced the thinking of Indian leadership throughout the nineteenth century. The charismatic Brahmo Samaj leader, Keshub Chunder Sen (1838-1884) declared at a public meeting in Calcutta in 1877: “Gentlemen, in the advent of British nation in India we see a reunion of parted cousins, the descendents of two different families of the ancient Aryan race”79. In far-off South Africa, Mohandas Gandhi addressed an open letter (1894) to the members of the legislature protesting against the ill-treatment of the Indians, and circulated it among the Europeans in Natal. In it Gandhi pointed out “that both the English and the Indians sprang from a common stock, called the Indo-aryan”80. [Indo-aryan is wrong. It should have been Aryan.] In fact Mohandas Gandhi becomes Mahatma Gandhi only when he jettisons this historiography.\n\nSo far Indo-Europeanism had provided the British with the legitimacy for their rule; now it would provide the natives with the courage to mildly challenge that rule.\n\nSircar argued that “the once glorious Hindu nation” has been “down -trodden for centuries by foreign yoke and a most de-energizing religion”. “The Hindu mind, thanks to this religion that has been swaying it for centuries without number, and thanks no less to its other surroundings, has lost much or its original Aryan vigor and energy”. Fortunately help was at hand in the all-important task of regeneration. The British increasingly recognized that they had “a duty to perform towards us”, that is their “brethren, now fallen and degraded”. “It must be acknowledged with gratitude that England, despite all shortcomings inseparable from a foreign rule, is doing her duty right royally. She has become aware that her true glory should consist not in simply holding under subjection the people of India, but in elevating them in the scale of nations, in taking them by hand and reconciling them to their long alienated brethren, her own children [that is, the English people themselves]”. “Let us thank Heaven then, that though nominally under a foreign power…we have fuller opportunities of developing the ends of our being, of fulfilling our destiny.”\n\nSircar was clear81 that “The best method…the only method… by which the Hindu mind can be developed to its full proportions is… by the cultivation of the Physical Sciences. The great defects, inherent and acquired,… of the Hindu mind… of the present day can only be remedied by the training which results from the investigation of natural phenomena.” The envisaged institution “shall be for the instruction of the masses, where lectures on scientific subjects will be systematically delivered, and not only illustrative experiments performed by the lecturers, but the audience should be invited and taught to perform them themselves”. “And we wish that this Institution be entirely under native management and control” so that “we may begin to learn the value of self-reliance without any serious risk”.\n\nWhere would money come from for the proposed science institution? Sircar hoped that the Rajahs and noblemen “will be willing…to spend a fraction of their wealth for such a glorious purpose as the amelioration, nay regeneration, of their own country, when their ancestors could spend so liberally on such ignoble and ridiculous occasions as the marriages and burials of dogs and cats.” Sircar also hoped that aid would be forthcoming “especially from the English community”, to which “it will be gratifying to see that we have at last learnt to beg for such noble purposes, which we must gratefully set to the credit of their own example”. Finally to reassure the administration and fellow loyalists, he hoped that the foundation stone of “the Temple of Positive Science” [quotes in the original] would be laid by the Prince of Wales during his forthcoming visit.\n\nLater in 1872 no doubt bowing to the public opinion he tried to tone down his criticism of the traditional society and declared: “It is hardly necessary for me to formally declare that I have never meant the cultivation of the physical sciences to be a panacea for all ills incident in human nature, and certainly I never meant that the Association in question was the only remedy I could propose for the evils that teem to my unfortunate country”82 (Biswas 2003: 79-80). In subsequent campaign writings he tended to use the term Indian rather than Hindu. However in 1891 he recalled: “It is to help in reluming the light of knowledge in the breasts of my countrymen in order to restore their old Aryan vigour of intellect, that this Association has been established”. A quarter of a century later Sircar’s 1869 views were echoed by P.C. Ray while concluding his monumental History of Hindu Chemistry: “The Hindu Nation with its glorious past and vast latent potentialities may yet look forward to a still more glorious future, and if the perusal of these lines will have the effect of stimulating my countrymen, to strive for regaining their old position in the intellectual hierarchy [italicized in the original] of nations, I shall not have laboured in vain”83.\n\nFar more significant is the response of Sircar’s contemporary, the well-known Bengali author, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee (1838-1894), who wrote an article in 1872 in his popular magazine Bangadarshan advocating the cause of the Science Association84. He also gave a donation of Rs 500 on 14 January 187685. More importantly, Bankim seems to have drawn on the Sircar thesis while bringing his influential novel Anandamath to a close. As we shall see in the next section a December 1875 report prepared by the provisional committee called “the restoration and elevation of the people of India” as “the mission of England” (Biswas 2003: 125). More specifically Sircar in the sketch of the scheme for the proposed Science Association declared in the closing paragraph that he had “a right to expect aid from all countries and peoples, especially from those which are enjoying the advantages and privileges of the cultivation of science”86. Going overboard in December 1875 Sircar wrote on the eve of the visit of Prince of Wales to India : “I hope that the Prince in whose veins runs the best blood of the most intellectual nations of Europe, will lend a helping hand in laying the foundation of an institution which will be a pledge as it were of England’s good wishes to India, and serve as a lasting monument to remind India’s children of the debt immense of India’s gratitude they owe for their intellectual moral revivification to England’s noble sons87. In Anandamath after the sanyasis have crushed the Muslim rebellion and wish to take on the English, a Healer (Cikitsak) appears on the scene. This Healer could have been Dr Mahendra Lal Sircar himself even though transported a century back. The Healer explains that the knowledge is of two kinds: Outward and inward. “For a long time now the outward knowledge has been lost in this land, and so the true Eternal Code has also been lost.” It is noteworthy that in the first edition of Anandamath Bankim used Arya dharma in place of Eternal Code (sanatana dharma). The Healer continues: “The outward knowledge no longer exists in this land…The English are very knowledgeable in the outward knowledge, and they are very good at instructing people. Therefore we’ll make them king. And when by this teaching our people are well instructed about external things…the true Code shall shine forth by itself again”88. This point about Sircar’s possibly having been the model for Bankim’s Cikitsak does not seem to have been made before.\n\nCampaign\n\nSircar wanted his institution to be like the Royal Institution and the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The Royal Institution came about in response to the dual revolution: industrial and the French (Berman 1976:2). It was established in 1799 by “improving landlords”, who “decided to solve the problems of the poorer classes by trying to increase food production through scientific methods”. However since the number of such landlords was too small to sustain the institution its base was soon expanded to include the professional classes. The British Association, founded in 1831, “was able to combine the cultivators of science into a body politic, an intellectual union which was able not only to offer advice to the government but also to secure attention to that advice”89. Both were irrelevant for India, which in Sircar’s time neither had improving landlords nor men of science. Nor was there any counterpart in India of the strains caused in Europe by the industrial and the French revolution.\n\nSircar’s Science Association project was not driven by any historical necessity. It did not fulfil any felt need. No wonder then that the type of funding and support Sircar had envisaged was not forthcoming. If Sircar was able to establish his institution and sustain it for three decades without any regular source of income or grant it was due to his tenacity. It of course helped that he was a successful physician and in the good books of the government.\n\nWe can distinguish between three phases in the campaign for and early sustenance of the Science Association. (i) The first phase extending from 1870 through 1874 during which Sircar tried to generate enthusiasm for the project on his own strength. (ii) The second phase from 10 March 1875 when the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir Richard Temple, showed interest in the project till the Association’s inauguration by Temple on 29 July 1876. During this period, Sircar had to guard against subversion by Temple, raise funds and also gain legitimacy from the community through widespread support. This is the most fascinating part of the campaign often sanitized by the assertion that Temple supported the project. (iii) The third phase ran from the establishment of the Association till Sircar’s death in 1904. During it Sircar sustained himself through large donations from wealthy people even if the support he received remained below his expectations.\n\nThe scheme when announced was well received by the press. A brief three-paragraph prospectus was published in the Hindoo Patriot on 3 January 1870, the influential mouthpiece of the British Indian Association. Through it “All well-wishers of Progress and of India” were “solicited to contribute their quota in furtherance of the project”. The first donor was the eminent zamindar from Uttarpara, Joykissen Mookerjee, who paid a rather small sum of Rs 1000. Iswarchandra Vidyasagar also contributed the same amount. It is noteworthy that donations from the landed class were not substantially higher that those from the professional class90. The first year of soliciting (1870) brought in 17 subscribers/donors. The number fell sharply after that: to seven in 1871, five in 1872 and only two in 1873 (including Sircar himself who gave Rs 1000), and zero in 1874. The only saving grace was an unexplained contribution of 5000 rupees in 1870 from the Maharaja of far-off Patiala91. In 1874 the Maharaja of Kashmir’s “Chief Justice and General Manager” Nilambar Mukherjee told Sircar that the Maharaja was willing to “patronize the Science Association” by paying the substantial sum of three hundred thousand rupees provided the institution was set up in Benaras, the ancient seat of learning, but Sircar was not ready to move away from his home ground92.\n\nSircar found a valuable ally and comrade in the science professor at St Xavier’s College Calcutta, the Belgian Catholic priest, Father Eugene Lafont, S. J. (26 March 1837-10 May 1908), without whose “ungrudging and long, continued aid, the association would not have been an accomplished fact”93. As Nature put it in its tribute to him: “He was, however, an educationist rather than original thinker or original worker, but he did yeoman service for science in Bengal”94. St Xavier’s College “is one which makes provision for the education of the domiciled European and Eurasian population of Calcutta and Lower Bengal, and in this way Father Lafont secured great influence among these classes. The college is also popular with native Indian gentlemen, and by his influence with Rajas and other men of note, Lafont was able to obtain several endowments for the purchase of scientific apparatus. This college possesses an excellent supply of most costly lecture apparatus, especially of the kind necessary for popular science demonstration, in which way that college is better equipped than any in India95. Indeed in addition to his sterling qualities as an educationist96, Father Lafont was a born popular scientific lecturer, and had a peculiar facility for putting dry facts in a popular way and an equal facility for making his lectures interesting by excellent experimental illustrations”97. He lectured at the Association uninterruptedly for seventeen years”, that is from 1876 till 1893, and was “one of its perpetual Vice-Presidents”98. Whatever little gate money Lafont collected from his public lectures, he made over to the Science Association fund99. Like Sircar, Lafont was well honoured in his own life time. He was made a Companion of the Indian Empire in 1880 as also Officer de l’Academie de France (1886) His own King of Belgium made him a Knight of the Order of Leopold (1898). In 1877 Calcutta University appointed him a fellow of the Senate for life, which in turn elected him to the Syndicate a number of times100. (Cal.U.1857:463) Calcutta University awarded him an honorary doctorate in science in 1908, the year such a degree was introduced101.\n\nBorn in Mons, south Belgium, Lafont was admitted into the Society of Jesus in December 1854. He was first educated in St Barbara’s College, Ghent, and then (1863-1965) at Jesuit College, Namur (now a university). In the meantime, on 16 January 1860, the Belgian Province of the Society of Jesus opened St Xavier’s College in Calcutta. On completion of his studies, Lafont was assigned to the Bengal Mission. He arrived in Calcutta in December 1865 to teach at St Xavier’s College and remained associated with it till his end. In 1869, Lafont was ordained and made a vicar and then the priest at St Thomas Parish. He held the charge for more than twenty years, gaining “more popularity as an eminent preacher as time went by”102. Lafont’s place in history however owes to science rather than faith. He was the Rector of the college from 1871 to 1878 and then again from 1901 to 1904. He visited Europe twice, during 1878-1879 for health reasons and in 1900 to see the Paris exhibition. Both times he brought back latest scientific equipment.\n\nLafont began by teaching to school pupils, but in 1867 when B.A. classes were opened he was transferred to the college section where he taught natural philosophy as also mental and moral philosophy. Lafont converted a small part of the terrace of the college building into a laboratory–cum-retreat, calling it his museum. “There he would sit till well into the small hours, tinkering with any gadgets he could lay his hands on or reading and preparing his lectures and sermons”103. Lafont furnished his museum with barometers and thermometers. Noting a sharp fall in the barometer reading of atmospheric pressure on the morning of 1 November 1867, he predicted the impending arrival of a severe cyclone, which dutifully made its presence felt the same evening. The prediction helped limit the damage and enhanced his prestige in the government circles as well as the native society. It also facilitated the establishment in the college of a valued meteorological laboratory104.\n\nInterestingly, Lafont did not know English when he arrived. However by 1870 he had mastered it well enough to be able to give forceful public lectures. This is also the time when Sircar appeared on the scene with his manifesto. Although donation-wise Sircar drew a blank in 1874 the year itself was scientifically very important because of the astronomical phenomenon of the transit of Venus across the disc of the sun seen on 9 December 1874. The event brought in an Italian team led by Pietro Tacchini (1838-1905) of Palermo Observatory, which set up an observing station in Muddapur with full support and participation from Lafont. The temporary event produced a permanent result. Tacchini persuaded Lafont to establish a spectroscopic observatory in his college for which he himself drew the plan.\n\nTemple who held office from April 1874 till January 1877 (when he was transferred to Bombay as Governor) visited Lafont on 5 February 1875 accompanied by Mr Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant-Duff. “By the end of the month, the Government of Bengal sanctioned a grant of Rs 5000 towards the erection of the observatory, on condition that a like sum be gathered by private subscription before the end of March”105. Lafont’s appeal for public funds was enthusiastically received. “A special performance was given at the Opera’s theatre of Calcutta for the proposed Observatory”106. A total of Rs 21000 was soon collected; construction of the building begun; and high-class equipment ordered from Europe107. It is unfortunate that the observatory failed to produce any results108. Thus the first ever attempt to introduce basic modern scientific research outside the government failed to take off. Physical astronomy was institutionalized by the establishment of the imperial government’s Kodaikanal Observatory in 1899109.\n\nIt is likely that during Temple’s visit to St Xavier’s Lafont put in a word for Sircar. (Jesuit archives may be able to confirm this hypothesis and provide other useful information.) Sircar met Temple briefly on 10 March 1875 on the latter’s invitation. After the meeting Sircar claimed that Temple had supported his scheme. In the absence of any official record of the meeting or reference to it in Temple’s published memoirs it is not possible to say what exactly transpired at the meeting. We learn from Sircar’s diary that he rather sheepishly “put on trousers and chapkan [jacket] and a pagri [turban]” for the occasion. “It appeared from the conversation we had with the Lt Governor that I could appear with my ordinary dress , even with my slippers”110. It is curious that Sircar did not record in his diary any thing more substantial than this about the momentous meeting.\n\nSircar’s name does not figure at all in Temple’s reminiscences. If Temple’s official reports and actions, subsequent writings as also the official archives since made available are any guide it is very likely that Sircar was putting a spin on the outcome of the meeting for local consumption. Temple could not possibly have asked Sircar to start the institution as Sircar had envisioned. Temple supported the proposal only to the extent that he did not reject it outright. The relationship between the colonial government and the native leadership had already become quite complex. The government was wary of opposing a cause that seemed to command native support. Native support in turn was forthcoming if the government seemed to be positively inclined.\n\nThe news that the Lieutenant-Governor had invited Sircar for a private audience enhanced Sircar’s prestige among the native gentlemen111 and changed the Association’s fortunes. The first meeting of the subscribers took place five long years after the prospectus was issued but within four weeks of Sircar-Temple meeting. From 1870 up to the meeting, Sircar had been able to enlist only 32 subscribers (including himself) who paid an average of slightly less than Rs 1700. Now a month’s labour brought in as many as 35 donors even though their contribution per person was only Rs 400 112. By 1876 end Sircar had collected slightly less than a hundred thousand rupees from 171 subscribers. Of these 171 only 19% had enrolled before Temple came on the scene but they accounted for as much as 54% of the total amount. Later subscribers were more numerous but low-paying. This division suited Sircar fine because large number of low-paying subscribers spelt wide-spread native support for Sircar and bestowed legitimacy on the project. Once the project got going Sircar targeted big donors113. (The number of subscribers dropped to 100 in 1901114.)\n\nAt the first subscribers’ meeting, Sircar described his recent meeting with Temple thus: “At this stage, an impetus comes from an unexpected quarter. His Honor, the Lieutenant-Governor, animated with an ardent love of the sciences, full of zeal for the introduction of science teaching into our educational institutions, accidentally hears of my project, and becoming acquainted with its scope and objects, so far as I could in a short conversation render them intelligible, asks me to start the Institution, and His Honor goes so far as to hint that some aid might be granted from Government” Curiously, as Sircar continued he himself did not sound very confident of the government support. He insisted rather defensively that while government aid would be most welcome, the institution would be “solely native and purely national”. “And, I believe,…that His Honor, far from being desisted from granting us the contemplated aid, will come forward as generously with it, as His Honor has done with reference to the spectro-telescopic observatory of Father Lafont”115.\n\nFour days after the meeting, on 8 April 1875, Sircar sent a letter to Temple. The letter itself does not seem to be on record but we learn about its contents from the reply it elicited from Temple. The reply dated 3 May 1875 and sent by the private secretary quotes Sircar as “explaining that the meeting intended to be held on behalf of the Scientific Society had been postponed, and that it is proposed to hold a meeting at some future time, or whenever His Honor might be in Calcutta, and expressing your [Sircar’s] hope that he will accord a general support to the Society’s operations”116. Temple’s detailed response to Sircar’s letter is historically important; because it was the first time he was engaging himself with the native leadership on the important question of education. It would be instructive to place Temple’s response in a larger context.\n\nQuasi-disloyal discontent\n\nThose were the days when the British were getting increasingly worried about the discontent among educated Indians, especially in Bengal, and were keen to modify the extant education policy. The colonial authorities indeed had many occasions to recall the blunt assessment of Lord Ellenborough (Viceroy 1842-1844) that English education was “the surest means of putting an end to British rule in India”117. His prescription in 1858 as the Secretary of State for India was: “Education and civilization may descend from the higher to the inferior classes, and so communicated may impart new vigour to the community, but they will never ascend from the lower classes to those above them; they can only, if imparted, solely to the lower classes, tend to general convulsion, of which foreigners would be the first victims. If we desire to diffuse education, let us endeavour to give it to the higher classes first” 118. Lord Ellenborough would have approved of the 1870 founding of Mayo College, Ajmer, where “the sons of Chiefs, Princes and leading Thakurs” would be educated and taught British values.\n\nLord Mayo (Viceroy 1868-1872) wrote to a retired judge friend of his back home in England: “Let the Babu learn English by all means. But let us try to do something towards the three R’s to Rural Bengal”119. Through a resolution dated 9 September 1869 the Government of India “expressed disapproval of the expenditure of large public funds on higher education to the detriment of the vernacular education”. Beneficiaries of English education were not ready to accept this lying down. At a big public meeting held on 2 July 1870 in Calcutta under the auspices of British Indian Association, a resolution was passed saying that “nothing should be done to starve the English institutions for the sake of feeding vernacular schools”120. The resolution was moved by Joykissen Mookerjee and seconded by Sircar. Unmindful of the public sentiment Sir George Campbell, Lieutenant-Governor during 1871-1874, “pursued with energy the policy of encouraging primary education, discouraging the expansion of English education so eagerly sought by the bhadralok”121. He paid for his initiative with his job.\n\nThe Bengal middle class’s hostility to the move can be gauged from the comments made in London in 1871 by Surendra Nath Banerjea who had then just joined the Indian Civil Service and would emerge as an important national leader. While participating in a discussion on a paper on “Popular education in India” read by an India-returned former civil servant, William Tayler, Bannerjea loftily agreed that “We all recognize the great importance of mass education. We all know it would be impossible to civilize India without it”. But he warned “it is unwise on the part of Government to withdraw the aid it gives to high English education for the purpose of mass education”. Bannerjea declared that “I, for one, would stand up for English education” as against the vernacular, adding that “We have had enough of the stories of the wars between gods and goblins in the Ramayana and other works. At the present moment we ought to give them an education which will make them …better men” 122. Banerjea’s use of the term civilizing India in the context of mass education is significant. By this time the Indian baboos had starting speaking the language of the colonialists while the more sensitive among the British India’s officials were taking a more progressive line partly out of conviction and partly with the object of putting the middle class in its place.\n\nBy now the English-knowing middle class was sufficiently large, self-assured and articulate to protect and advance its class interests. If Campbell rooted for grass-root level education, Temple sought solution in technical education. But Temple had no intention of going the Campbell way. Instead of forcing his solution down the native throats he tried to carry them along. If he eventually failed it was not for want of trying. In the “Lieutenant-Governor’s Resolution” appended to the annual report of the Director of Public Instruction, Temple persistently put forward his thesis. Para 19 of the 1873-74 report asserts: “The Lieutenant-Governor would impress upon all concerned that one main object of scientific and technical education is to enable the rising generation in Bengal to earn their own living in practical pursuits, such as mechanics, engineering, surveying, mensuration, the higher branches of agriculture, the special culture of valuable products and the like…”\n\nContinuing in the same vein in the next year’s report (1874-75) Temple talks of “engrafting upon our education system (which is mainly of a general and literary character) of the study of practical sciences”, on the ground that “If the educated youth are to find employment, there really is no alternative but that a portion of them should resort to those employments…for which practical sciences afford the indispensable qualification”. Significantly the report records that the Lieutenant-Governor “has encouraged the wealthier and more enlightened classes of the natives to bestir themselves on this behalf”. These unquestionable views were for record. Clues to the philosophy behind them come from a letter Temple wrote on 18 February 1875 to the Viceroy, Lord Northbrook, referring to the “quasi-disloyal dissatisfaction” displayed in the Bengali press123. “No doubt the alumni of our schools and colleges do become as a class discontented. But this arises from our higher education being too much in the direction of law, public administration, and prose literature, where they may possibly imagine… that they may approach to competition with us. But we shall do more and more to direct their thought towards practical science, where they must inevitably feel their utter inferiority to us.”\n\nTemple felt constrained in Bengal because the Calcutta University was under the direct control of the Viceroy124. But when he went to Bombay as Governor (1877-1879) he also became the Chancellor of Bombay University. He could now implement some of his ideas. He introduced drawing as an optional subject in the secondary schools. To him goes also the credit for the introduction of agricultural education in 1879 in the Bombay Presidency125. He also introduced B.Sc. degree in Bombay. He later recalled: “By this time [1879] a project long in my contemplation was matured. This was the conferring of Degrees in Physical Science. I thought at Bombay, as in Calcutta, that the superior instruction had been too exclusively literary, and had not been sufficiently directed to the Physical Science which might lead to practical results. At Calcutta I had been powerless to remedy this, but at Bombay I was Chancellor, and had power to nominate the Fellows of the Governing Body. As vacancies occurred, I had accordingly nominated men of science as well as persons of literary distinction. Thus the science element was by degrees raised to its due proportion. I remember that at the decisive meeting the requisite motion was made in my presence by Dr (afterwards Sir Guyon) Hunter. Thus was passed a scheme of Science Degrees, more adequate than anything which had as yet been attempted in India.”126\n\nThe decisive Senate meeting Temple refers to was held on 12 April 1879. It was unprecedented in the history of Bombay University that a business meeting of the Senate (other than convocation, etc.) was chaired by the Chancellor himself. The course for the proposed degree comprised English, mixed mathematics, physical geography and one of the following: physics, zoology, botany and geology. Since there was yet no Faculty of Science the B.Sc. degree was instituted in the Faculty of Arts. Science students came from Engineering College at Poona which offered geology, chemistry, botany, forestry and agriculture and from Grant Medical College in Bombay which established a chair in biology127. Bombay University thus became the first university in the country to award B.Sc. in 1882128. Interestingly the prominent nationalist leader Sir Pherozeshah Mehta criticized Temple for his attempts to run the university as a government department.129\n\nLieutenant-Governor’s response to Sircar\n\nWith this background into Temple’s own thinking we return to the letter written on his behalf on 3 May 1875 in reply to Sircar’s letter of 8 April 1875. The reply pointedly refers to a “spontaneous and unaided effort on the part of the natives themselves to promote the spread of practical science among the people of Bengal”. Use of the term unaided suggests that Temple had no intention of financially supporting Sircar’s scheme. Mention of practical science is Temple’s way of pointing out where his own preferences lay.\n\nConceding for the sake of politeness that “Science may be pursued for its own sake in the abstract and for the mental pleasure it affords” and “there doubtless are many native gentleman in Bengal who will thus pursue it”, the Lieutenant-Governor went on to painstakingly argue that “Science also may be made to add immeasurably to the national wealth and so to afford lucrative employment to numberless persons according to their qualifications and acquirements…”. “Moreover by these means not only will many new industries be introduced into Bengal, but almost every one of the old established arts and manufacturers of the country may be rendered more useful and remunerative than at present.” (Bengal and indeed the whole of India today could advantageously use Temple’s blueprint prepared 120 years ago!).\n\nTemple wanted that the scheme “details be settled by yourselves without any specific guidance from the State”. He expressed confidence that Sircar and his supporters “will be able to elaborate plans calculated to redound to the material benefit of your countrymen”. The letter closed with Temple’s “cordial and earnest wishes for your practical success”. The use of the terms like material benefit and practical success leaves no doubt about the direction Temple wanted the native initiative to take. But he was not ready to confront the Calcutta middle class. He therefore decided to enlist native support for his own scheme. More specifically he tried to dovetail his scheme to the ongoing municipal factional politics.\n\nIf colleges were churning out a large number of unemployed and unemployable young men whose discontent was a major cause of worry for the colonial government there were also now after fifty years of English education a significant number of well-educated, articulate, bright young men who could look the empire in the eye and who now wanted a community leadership role. This leadership was currently in the hands of the landed class through the British India Association which had been formed in 1851 in time to influence the 1853 charter to be granted to the East India Company by the British Parliament. Though an organization of those entitled to privileges by accident of birth it still had place for the upwardly mobile members of the middle class. The arrangement was mutually beneficial. The upper crust could use the middle class’ intellectual prowess and the ability to write and argue130. The middle class in return received social prestige, built contacts and acquired a forum. The 50-rupee-a year membership of the British India Association was a proof, because proof was needed, of having arrived. But now this middle class was ready to strike out on its own. Fortunately for it the government for its own reasons was keen to reform the extant municipal corporations. So far the native representation had been through nominated members. The government appointed justices of peace from among the “Hindu property-owners and British tradesmen” who in turn constituted the corporation.\n\nIn 1875 an act was passed providing for a partially elective corporation for Calcutta. The self-made professional class now saw a bigger role for itself. Only it was not quite clear within its own ranks as to what was to be done with the past baggage as represented by the landed class. One faction led by Sisir Kumar Ghose owner of Amrita Bazar Patrika (who had moved to Calcutta in 1871) and Dr Sambhu Chandra Mookerjee (1839-1894), editor of the Mookerjee Magazine founded a political organization, Indian League, on 25 September 1875. This faction wanted a clear break with the past elitist leadership. The other faction which had old family and social ties with the old guard was more moderate and favoured a smooth transition. (It included Anand Mohan Bose, Surendra Nath Banerjee and others.) It is this latter section which was by the side of Sircar. It eventually prevailed politically with the founding of the more representative Indian Association, on 26 July 1876.\n\nSince the Indian Association leadership was supporting the Science Association Temple decided to enlist the support of the rival Indian League to further his polytechnic plan. The conflict between the Indian League and the Indian Association leadership was a factional fight untainted by any economic ideology. Indian League leaders may have been upstarts compared to those of the Indian Association131 but the former’s support for Temple’s polytechnic was certainly not driven by any commitment to the cause of the artisans. Indian League was supporting the Lieutenant-Governor not technical education. It was opposing the people behind Indian Association; it was not supporting the polytechnic.\n\nThe fact that the Lieutenant-Governor had decided to operate through a section of the native middle class rather than take a public stand himself lent intensity to the enrolment campaign in favour of the Association. Temple’s letter was published in the press and commented on editorially. The influential Hindoo Patriot (15 May 1875) which had consistently supported Sircar exhorted the Bengali Babus to donate liberally for the Science Association project, since “Mohamedans of N. India have already raised Rs 200,000/-for their Anglo-Oriental Fund”. At the same time it urged the government to give a grant-in-aid132.\n\nThe second subscribers’ meeting was held on 20 November 1875 which appointed a provisional committee under the chairmanship of Father Lafont to work out the plans for the Science Association. Its report along with “a sketch of the scheme” by Sircar was considered on 16 December 1875. Sircar’s sketch stated that “The object of the Association is to enable the natives of India to cultivate Science in all its departments, with a view to its advancement by original research and (as it will necessarily follow) with a view to its varied applications to the arts and comforts of life”. Obviously reference to the arts and comforts of life was an afterthought added for form’s sake as a concession to Temple’s stated views.\n\nThe provisional committee was still banking on support from the government and its sense of noblesse oblige: “Sir Richard Temple has already evinced the most lively interest in the project, and it will not be too much to believe that Lord Northbrook will do the same. And when the Rajas, Maharajas and Princes, who will gather in this our capital to honor the royal visitor, will learn this, they will, if we are not much mistaken, very gladly join, as one of them the Maharaja of Patiala has already long ago joined, in founding and endowing an Institution which, while, it will be the most fitting memorial of the Prince that can be conceived, will grandly fulfil the mission of England, the restoration and elevation of the people of India”133.\n\nThe campaign for more donations continued and the third subscribers’ meeting was called on 15 January 1876 under the chairmanship of Temple. In the meantime Temple had been active on his own agenda. Indian League was formed on 25 September 1875.It called a public meeting of “Native Gentlemen, Chiefs and Rajas” on 25 December 1875 under the chairmanship of Temple where a resolution was passed “to found an Institution for instructing in the various branches of the Physical Sciences in the name of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, to commemorate the visit of His Royal Highness”. Interestingly, the resolution was proposed by Sircar’s ardent supporter Lafont134. In his presidential address Temple made a far-sighted remark. He advised the organizers: “I do hope that if the large sums you expect are realised, the money will not be spent in building a structure. A structure is a very good thing in its way, but what is of more essential importance is the means of paying the salaries of the lecturers. You must remember that the lecturers and students form the living part of an Institution like this. To that purpose the money should be primarily devoted; that is, money should be invested, and the proceeds devoted to the payment of the salaries of lecturers”135. As it turned out the Indian League never reached a stage where it could follow or flout Temple’s advice. Sircar could have benefited from this valuable piece of advice but he chose to invest in the structure than in the living part.\n\nSince the date for the third subscribers’ meeting would have been fixed in advance in consultation with Temple there can be no doubt that he contrived to make sure that the practical sciences school meeting was held earlier. Indeed at the 15 January 1876 subscribers’ meeting, in his presidential remarks Temple declared that he “would be glad if any individual influence could be the means of drawing together a similar Association formed in the city under other auspices”. Temple took this opportunity to reiterate his own thesis. He declared that the objects of both the initiatives “are ultimately the same, namely, the improvement of the rising generation to the Western knowledge of science, while it will also afford those who cannot find a living in the public service and the Bar, a means of earning a good livelihood by practical pursuits, such as those of a scientific forester, a gardener, a civil engineer, a surveyor, a chemist and the like. I am sure you will agree with me that the learned professions, as they now exist in Bengal, are not sufficiently extensive to furnish employment to all those educated men who are annually, constantly seeking for employment. There is, therefore, nothing for these young men, if they wish to live respectably, but for them to put their shoulders to the wheel-the wheel being the cultivation of the practical sciences”136. Temple’s remarks were greeted with “loud cheers” but did not bring about any change of heart.\n\nThe meeting formally resolved to set up Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science with Temple as its ex-officio chairman. The matter however did not end there. A joint meeting of the subscribers to the Science Association and to the Indian League’s polytechnic was held on 28 January 1876 with Temple in the chair to examine the possibility of the merger of the two schemes. The idea was formally given up when of the present only 5 voted for amalgamation and 32 against. But more significant than the vote count were the arguments.\n\nIn the early days of the British rule over Bengal the social relationship between the British officials and the native leadership was quite cordial cemented as it was by mutually beneficial financial transactions. More basically the British in Bengal were dealing with a social class they themselves had created, enriched and socially elevated137. In this setting Indians had no difficulty in playing second fiddle while learning English language, literature and law. But by the 1870s the Empire had hardened and the native leadership had also gained in confidence. Given its class characteristics it was not willing for the second round of apprenticeship that technical education entailed. The well-respected scholar Dr Rajendralala Mitra asserted that “no nation on earth had shown a higher appreciation of learning for its own sake than the Hindu. For three thousand years and upwards their ancestors had cherished Sanskrit learning for its own sake, and need it be doubted that their descendents would not be equal to the sciences of the present day?”138. There could not have been anybody in the audience to remind the learned orator that three thousand years ago the production of wealth was based on frozen empirical technologies which did not require any formal learning while the 19th century production of wealth required learnt skills. Learning for its own sake had appealed to the Brahmins then and had an equal fascination for the new social class British rule in Bengal had created. But farmers and artisans would have benefited from modern science. Thus while Europe was artisaizing science it was sought to be Brahminized in India in keeping with the caste composition of the middle class.\n\nMitra warned Sircar: “do not attempt to make your institution a school of technical education in the industrial arts… nor attempt to make it self supporting by producing remunerative art work in your laboratories. If you do, you will disappoint your pupils”. Mitra’s admonition had a history behind them. In 1854 a School of Industrial Art was set up under the auspices of a newly established Society for the Promotion of Industrial Arts, with Mitra as the secretary and a British engineer Colonel H. Goodwyn as the president. The school hoped to offer three-year training to about 30 students in “the arts of engraving, modelling, printing, architecture design, ornamental pottery and porcelain manufacture, etc.” so as to open “new branches of employment for middle and educated classes”139. The idea was “to lead these classes… to regard with respect and honour the manual labour necessary for the practice of these arts”. The school was taken over by the government in 1862. Its report for the year 1866-67 is rather discouraging. Noting that the majority of students came from “the middle and poorer classes of the Natives”, the Principal, H.H. Locke, lamented that “several instances have occurred of parents being compelled to withdraw students from the School and relinquish their intention of obtaining them a professional training as draughtsmen, owing to the necessity for their procuring some kind of office or other employment”. He suggested that “If Government or any of the native gentlemen…would offer one or two scholarships…to induce students to remain at their studies a year or two longer than at present, it would ensure the complete education of a few well qualified draughtsmen”. No support either from the government or native leadership seems to have been forthcoming. The school did succeed in diffusing the lithographic technology but by the time half-tone block prints were introduced the school had changed its colour140. Under the leadership of E. B. Havell and Abanindranath Tagore it became a fine arts institute (since re-named Government College for Art and Craft).\n\nFather Lafont bluntly stated that the pro-polytechnic Indian League wanted “to transform the Hindus into a number of mechanics requiring for ever European supervision”141. If the Indians drawn from artisan castes had been consulted they would not have minded their utter inferiority to the foreign rulers for one or two generations as a price for upgradation of their traditional skills. But the native leadership was in the hands of upper castes well known for their disdain of manual work. It had taken them two generations of study of western law and literature to claim equality with the rulers. They wanted science to be cultivated at the same level. Since this class knew Shakespeare as well as if not better than the British themselves it believed that its edifice of science should be supported by and be an extension of the British effort.\n\nEuropean missionaries acted as a bridge between the colonial rulers and native upper class interests. In 1886 there was a suggestion afoot from Charles Henry Tawney, the acting director of public instructions, backed by the Government that technical education should be introduced at the school level and the institutions which would not arrange technical education would cease to receive Government aid. Father H. Neut (1845-1921),the then Rector of St Xavier’s and a colleague of Lafont’s, opposed the scheme saying that “ To begin the technical studies in the school itself is to prepare a generation without elevation or grandeur”142.\n\nExercising his executive powers and independently of the Science Association the Lieutenant-Governor resolved to establish a number of surveying schools observing that “the foundation of these schools will only be a preliminary step towards establishment of technical schools for the teaching of handicrafts and the improvement of several kinds of manual industry.” The editorial comment in the influential Hindoo Patriot (31 January 1876) was on predictable lines: “This will of course improve the condition of the masses, but will not affect the educated classes”.\n\nFinally yielding to the demands of the educated classes, the Lieutenant-Governor gave his approval to through a notification gazetted on 23 February 1876. The notification itself is dated 21 January 1876, that is a week before the joint meeting. Unless the official date is a misprint the notification must have been back-dated because it could not possibly have been issued before the outcome of the joint meeting was known. Through this notification the Lieutenant-Governor noted that “the realization of so large an amount of donations as that promised would indicate munificence on the part of many native gentlemen for the good of their countrymen”. Making it clear that “the members should depend on their own independent exertions for the attainment of success”143, the government decided to purchase a suitable building (for Rs 40000), and make it available free of charge for the Association. It is noteworthy that the government saw the Association as a science college. As the Annual Report on Public Instruction for 1875-76 in Bengal put it (para 451): “The objects of the institution are to provide lectures of a superior kind in science, especially general physics, chemistry and geology, mainly for students who have already passed through school or college or have otherwise attained some proficiency in these respects”.\n\nBy another minute dated 18 April 1876 Temple considered the proposal of the Indian League for the establishment of a technical school. “The promoters of the institution having agreed to invest two lakhs of rupees (expected as donations) in Government securities, so as to produce an income of Rs 8000 p.a., an equal grant of Rs 8000 was made by His Honor.” It was officially noted that “Among the donations, one of Rs 40000 by Rai Luchmipat Singh Bahadur of Asimgunge has already been invested in Government securities” (Annual Report of Public Instruction in Bengal for 1875-76, para 453). Interestingly Hindoo Patriot (26 February 1876) pointed out that Luchmipat’s contribution was made to the Government for Berhampore College, and “he merely agreed for the diversion of funds to the Indian League at the request of Sir Richard Temple”. As is well known nothing came out of Indian League’s officially supported initiative for a technical school while Science Association was inaugurated by Temple on 29 July 1876 (See Table 1 for a summary of chronology).\n\nTable 1.. Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science: Chronology 1869-76\n\nLectures\n\nWhile the Science Association was in the subscription stage Calcutta University was introducing science into its system. Chemistry stood apart from other scientific disciplines; it was a part of the British Indian governance. Ghazipur opium factory had a post of opium chemist (When was it introduced?). Various government departments of industry hired industrial chemists while Calcutta municipal corporation maintained a chemical laboratory. Unlike other industrial products it was not very viable to import sulphuric, nitric and hydrochloric acids. Being hazardous, these chemicals could only be brought in as deck cargo, which entailed heavy freight making their landed cost prohibitively high. A Scottish immigrant Dr David Waldie (1813-1889) who arrived in Calcutta in 1853 set up chemical works for manufacturing mineral acids in large quantities. Limited amounts were produced by three or four small units through “primitive and wasteful methods”144.\n\nIt would be instructive to briefly review early attempts at introduction of science education. As is well-known Hindu College (or rather its junior branch) was opened in January 1817 as a community initiative. Hindu College applied for a government grant in July 1823. The government agreed and appointed a general committee of public instruction which was asked to examine the possibility of the introduction of “European Science as far as practicable”145. The committee recommended the appointment of a professor of experimental philosophy, and proposed that the instructions “embrace the following sciences:-Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, Optics, Electricity, Astronomy, Chemistry”. The committee further suggested that “it would be advisable to separate Chemistry from the rest, and to appropriate a practical course to that science alone”146. Accordingly, one Mr D. Ross from the Calcutta mint was appointed a lecturer in chemistry in 1824 in the Hindu College, “but his knowledge of the subject seems to have been very poor-at any rate his pupils were not at all favourably impressed by his lectures. The only thing he was conversant with was Soda, and he was never tired of dilating on its properties. No wonder one of them Krishnamohan Bandhyopadhyay (afterwards famous as Rev. K. M. Banerji) contributed to the papers a sarcastic article entitled “Soda and his Pupils”147.\n\nChemistry had to wait another fifty years for a second chance. In the meantime 1863-1975 Henry Francis Blanford (1834-1893) of the Geological Survey of India served as a broad-spectrum professor of natural science at the Presidency College Calcutta where he taught outlines of a number of subjects ranging from physical geography to physics148. In 1872 Calcutta University permitted First Arts (F.A.) students to opt for chemistry in place of psychology. Also B.A. was split into two streams: the traditional A course (literature) and the new B (science) course. Two years later chemistry (along with physical geography) was made a compulsory subject for the B course while two papers in physical science were made optional149. Science gained immediate popularity. In 1874 out of the 96 regular F.A. candidates from the Presidency College as many as 83 opted for chemistry. Similarly in the B.A. examination 60 out of 84 opted for science in the third year and 48 out of 84 in the fourth year150.\n\nIt was left to the far-sighted and therefore unpopular Lieutenant-Governor Sir George Campbell (tenure 1871-1874) to ask for specialist professors in chemistry and botany151. [Sir] Alexander Pedlar, joined in 1874 at the young age of 25 and later rose to become the Vice-Chancellor of Calcutta University. For his own researches done in India, including on cobra poison, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1892. He can truly be called the founder of chemistry education in India. Similarly [Sir] George Watt came as a professor of botany at the Hughli College and later moved to Krishnagar.\n\n“Under instruction from the Government” Pedlar “came with a considerable supply of chemical apparatus” and started practical classes in 1875152. Presidency College Calcutta was the best funded college in the whole of the country and the only one in Calcutta, apart from the Jesuit St Xavier’s, which offered science. Other private colleges did not have the resources to do so. Their students were however permitted to attend classes in Presidency College on payment of a small fees. The popularity of science can be gauged from the number of these “out-students”. The number was four in 1871 and zero in both 1872 and 1873. But with the arrival of new equipment number rose rapidly. It was 14 in 1874; 21 in 1875; 45 in 1876; and as high as 63 in 1882153.\n\nPedlar recommended appointment of an additional member of faculty. The addition, in 1889, was P.C. Ray which turned out to be historically significant. The Presidency College chemistry laboratory refurbished in 1893 helped P.C. Ray attain international fame as an experimental chemist as also to found a flourishing school (see below). India would go on to establish a successful chemical industry which in turn has led to a pharmaceutical industry now known the world over for its ability to produce generic drugs at low cost. Although facilities existed in other science subjects they did not receive the same attention as chemistry because chemistry was a compulsory subject while the others were not. Notwithstanding the science facilities in the Presidency and St Xavier’s Colleges the general lack of laboratory facilities made science education under university auspices mostly a theoretical exercise. Those days “it was possible for a B.A. student to pass his University examination in chemistry without entering a laboratory or touching a test tube” 154.\n\nWithin a month of its inauguration the Science Association embarked on its regular lecture series.
