        "text": "Hindu School (Kolkata)\n\nIndia / Bangla / Calcutta / Kolkata\n\nWorld / India / Bangla / Calcutta World / India / West Bengal / Kolkata\n\nschool Add category\n\nSituated in the academic heart of Kolkata(Calcutta), the cultural capital of India, Hindu School is the national heritage of institutional education, history and reform. The school was established in 1817 by stalwart educationalists like Maharaja Radhakanta Deb, David Hare, Dewan B. N. Mukherjee and others in a visionary and ahead-of-era intention to impart modern education to the young students in European and Oriental subjects.\n\nPrior to the advent of the British in India, the indigenous pathsala(s) i.e. primary schools & tols of Bengal taught very little beyond Bengali & Sanskrit languages, simple Arithmetic etc. The tols (local small schools run by individuals) imparted lessons in advanced Sanskrit, grammar and literature, theology, logic and metaphysics. This was not enough to satisfy the aspiration of the enlightened Indians like Raja Rammohun Roy, who felt that the process would only 'load the minds of youths with grammatical niceties and metaphysical distinctions' without having any practical use. The necessity of learning English was also keenly felt by people who had to carry on a constant interaction with the British businessmen. A few schools were set up with the purpose of providing rudimentary education in the English language to native Indians. The most prominent among them was the school (pathshala) section of Hindu College which later got separated as an independent institute named Hindu School.\n\nStanding tall and traditional at the threshold of its 200-year jubilee the institute is the proud academic parent of more than 17000 students in totality. Students of this school have been continuously bringing glory and pride for the nation in various fields for last two centuries. The school has groomed up many nascent talent and prodigies to the eminent personalities who are globally known and adored for their contribution towards the human society and civilisation. Dr. Satyendranath Bose, Madhusudhan Dutt, Abanindranath Tagore, Debendranath Tagore, Kesab Chandra Sen are some of the eminent alumni of this school. Even today, the excellent performance is continuing.\n\nNearby cities:"
