        "text": "GURUDEV RABINDRANATH TAGORE IN KASHMIR\n\n“Where the mind is without fear\n\nand the head is held high;\n\nWhere knowledge is free;\n\nWhere the world has not been broken up\n\ninto fragments by narrow domestic walls;\n\nWhere words come out from the depth of truth;\n\nWhere tireless striving stretches\n\nits arms toward perfection;\n\nWhere the clear stream of reason has not lost\n\nits way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;\n\nWhere the mind is led forward\n\nby thee into ever-widening thought and action -\n\nInto that heaven of freedom,\n\nMy Father, let my country awake.” …………….( Rabindranath Tagore..Gitanjali)\n\nPolymath, poet, author, painter - Rabindranath Tagore left a deep impact, not just in India but across the globe. The first non-European to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, 'Gurudev', as he came to be known was born to Debendranath Tagore, a religious reformer and member of the Brahmo Samaj, and Sarada Devi. In addition to his several literary works, Tagore also wrote the National Anthems for, both, India and Bangladesh.\n\nTagore received Nobel Prize in 1914. This was a hectic year for the poet. He visited many places lecturing and meeting students, writers and people in general. In early 1915, he wrote his famous play Phalguni (The Cycle of Spring) and one of his major novels Ghare- Baire (The Home and the World). He was knighted in 1915 ( he resigned the honour as a protest against British policies in India.).He had hectic sessions at Shantiniketan where his play Phalguni was staged and he played the role of the blind Baul. He also wrote about 100 songs in 1915. He suggested that he should take a break and move to some hill station. And Tagore decided to go to Kashmir.\n\nIn October 1915, Rabindranath Tagore visited Kashmir for a fortnight’s holiday. He was accompanied by Bengali poet Satyendra Nath Datta, his son Rathinder Nath and Pratima Devi. He was simply captivated by the beauty of the valley, especially the autumn season. Quite often, he would sit on the banks of River Jhelum in thoughtful silence. To a friend, he wrote that River Jhelum was like his native Padma. He started composing the famous Balaka ( Flight of Cranes )series of poems in Kashmir.\n\nThe Kashmir invitation was extended to Gurudev by a senior Bengali officer, Jagdish Chander Chatterji who worked as Superintendent of the State Research Department during Maharaja Partap Singh's rule. All the arrangements were made by the said official and his dedicated team in Srinagar. Gurudev’s party arrived via Rawalpindi and stayed in the houseboat \"Paristaan\" moored on the banks of the Dal Lake in Srinagar. Later, Gurudev and his family shifted to another houseboat located on the banks of the Jhelum River.\n\nGurudev visited many places in Kashmir . He also visited King Lalitaditya’s Martand Sun Temple. Dina Nath Hanjura, principal of DAV School, Rainawari once told us in our class that Gurudev Tagore had praised the intellectual loftiness of King Lalitaditya of Kashmir by looking at the location and grandeur of the Martand Temple ruins in Kashmir. And again Badri Nath Sidda, a learned Purohit from Mattan had informed me in 1988 that his Yejmaan Bahi ( patrons record register) had signatures of a Mahatma from Bengal named Rabindranath Tagore who had visited Martand Teertha of Kashmir in 1915. Mahatama Tagore is Gurudev Tagore .\n\nWhile in Kashmir, Gurudev’s literary work was disrupted by the people who would come to meet him . He also accepted an invitation from Pandit Anand Kaul for a dinner at his downtown, Zainakadal residence in Srinagar city. Apart from being a writer, Anand Kaul worked as Sheriff in the office of Raja Amar Singh's Council of Regency and later President of Srinagar Municipality from 1914 to 1917. He was a scholar and a historian who had published some books through the Asiatic Society of Bengal. Master Zinda Kaul and Pandit Anand Koul brought Gurudev in a Tonga for the dinner and the literary meeting. The host had organized a lavish non-vegetarian dinner(that included Roganjosh,Yakhni,Mutsch,Kabargaah and fish ) for Gurudev and the guests.Tagore used to have non-vegetarian food on a regular basis. Being born in a Brahmo landlord family and having exposure to European and other cuisine, he was quite open -minded about food. He used to love different types of fishes specially Hilsa and prawns. Many people say that Kashmiri poet Mehjoor was also present in this gathering but this needs some authentic confirmation. Cinema actor Balraj Sahni was a great admirer of Mehjoor’s poetry and it was he who introduced Mehjoor to the world. In 1938 Sahni wrote an article titled,’ Mehjoor, Poet of Kashmir’ in Vishwa Bharti’s quarterly magazine edited by Rabindranath Tagore . In 1972 Sahni was instrumental in making a biographical film by the name of ‘Shayar-e-Kashmir Mehjoor‘ which was directed by Prabhat Mukherjee. The film starred Parikshat Sahni as Mehjoor and Balraj Sahni as Mehjoor’s father.May be Gurudev came to know Mehjoor through this link. In his interview with Prof V S Naravane, Master Zinda Kaul has not confirmed Mehjoor's presence in Pandit Anand Kaul’s house. In this poetic gathering, Tagore advised Kashmiri poets to be careful about the choice of their themes. Apart from enjoying a Kashmiri dinner at Pandit Anand Kaul’s residence, Tagore also desired to have some books on Kashmir’s Shaivism from Pandit Anand Kaul. A poetic gathering was also held in the house of Pandit Anand Koul. Many young poets joined this gathering and Gurudev was amused to listen to the Kashmiri poems. These poems were translated into English by Pandit Anand Koul and copies of the English translation were provided in advance to Gurudev. Master Zinda Kaul also participated in this poetic gathering.\n\nGurudev also helped his nephew Abanindranath Tagore who accompanied him to paint some views, especially the paintings depicting Ashoka sitting atop Shankaracharya hill and looking at Hariparbat, Shahjajan in Shalimar garden during night, Chashm e Shahi garden, Nishat garden, Nasim Bagh and some more. Abanindranath Tagore is credited with the founding of the Bengal School of Art. This movement revolted against the western style of painting and sought to revive ancient and medieval Indian traditions of painting. Abanindranath was the creator of a new national vocabulary in art and he helped to regenerate the decadent art and aesthetic scene in India. The Indian Society of Oriental Art was established to promote the Abanindranath-style on the national plane. It was Abanindranath who ushered in the modem art movement in Bengal. It was his brush, which first gave convincing proof that the Indian artist had his own contribution to make to the world of painting. With these paintings and the Balaka series of poems, Kashmir was showcased to the Bengali elite for the first time.\n\nAt the invitation of I K Sharga ( a Kashmiri Pandit from Lucknow and the then principal of S P College, Srinagar ), Gurudev also addressed students and intellectuals inside the S P College auditorium. Pandit Samsar Chand Koul Ganhar (well-known bird watcher, writer and a teacher in Mission School, Fateh Kadal, Srinagar ) also visited Gurudev while he stayed in the houseboat ,Paristaan . Pandit Samsar Chand requested Gurudev for a visit to Mission School ,Fateh Kadal to address the students. Gurudev expressed his inability and told him that he had a hectic and busy schedule. He invited Pandit Samsar Chand Koul and the boys of the Mission School, Fateh Kadal to SP College where he addressed a gathering of the students, teachers and intellectuals and also sang verses from his book Gitanjali.\n\nKashmir remembered Gurudev’s visit when in 1958, Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad decided to name the newly built Cultural Complex in Wazir Bagh as ‘Tagore Hall’. This was possibly a humble tribute to Gurudev who had many admirers in the J&K state. About his visit and getting inspiration in Kashmir to write the Balaka series ( poems), Gurudev writes this:-\n\n\" My coming to Kashmir has helped me to know clearly what I want. It will likely become obscured again when I go back to my usual routine; but these occasional detachments of life from the usual round of customary thoughts and occupations lead to the final freedom – the Santan, Sivam, Advaitam. I was in Kashmir. One evening, I sat by the River Jhelum. There was stillness all around. I felt like I was sitting beside the Padma. Of course, when I lived on the Padma, I was a young man, now I am old. Yet that difference seemed to have been wiped out by some link transcending time. A flock of geese flew over my head across Jhelum. I seemed to hear some ineffable call, and be led by its impulse to some far journey..I heard the many voiced words of man wing along unheeded ways, from the faded past to far off future dim, I heard within myself the sound of this homeless bird winging with countless other birds from shore to shore through daylight and darkness. Space echoes with the song of all creation’s wings: ‘Not here! Elsewhere! Elsewhere! Somewhere else! \"\n\nThe flight of the flying geese ( Balaka ) in the sky is indicative of the larger freedom man longs for but cannot attain. The wings of a home-seeking bird in the dusk remind the poet of the sweeping energy of human love and God being the centre of the unattainable.The birds seem to give the eternal message to the poet. Balaka or “The Flying Geese”, the title word usually means a heron; but the poet points out that it refers to a flock of flying geese. I add a poem from the Balaka series of Gurudev:-\n\n“O flying geese,\n\nYour wings are maddened by the tempest’s wine:\n\nWith the resounding laughter of piled-up joy,\n\nRising waves of wonder, beat along the sky.\n\nThe rush of wings rose around,\n\nA dancing nymph composed of sound,\n\nBreaking the meditation of the silence.\n\nThe mountains sunk in gloom\n\nSuddenly shuddered, and the deodar woods.\n\nfelt the message of those beating wings\n\nFor instant bring\n\nThe impulse of motion to the enraptured depths\n\nOf all that’s immobile.\n\n…Of mountains, and this forest, fly from strange\n\nTo strange realm, isle to isle\n\nThe pulse of the stars’ flight\n\nStarlets the dark with the sound of weeping light.\n\nI heard the words of men flying in the flocks\n\nAlong invisible tracks\n\nFrom the dim past to some new unformed age.\n\nNight and day in my heart have I heard\n\nWith countless other birds, this\n\nRelinquishing its nest, through light and darkness go –\n\nFrom what shore to what shore?\n\nThe infinite’s wings send out their song through space:\n\nNot here but elsewhere, elsewhere– in some other place.”\n\n(Avtar Mota )"
