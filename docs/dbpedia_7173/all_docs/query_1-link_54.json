        "text": "Preamble:\n\nThe School of Sanskrit, Philosophy and Indic Studies (SSPIS) is the outcome of integrating two separate academic units at Goa University, namely, the Department of Philosophy, one of the oldest Departments, and the nascent School of Sanskrit and Indic Knowledge Systems into a composite whole for wider and deeper engagements. Academic study of Philosophy at Goa University was initially part of the then Centre for Post-Graduate Instruction and Research of University of Bombay (CPIR-1967). Subsequently, when Goa University came into existence, it became one of the constituent departments.\n\nCurrently, the SSPIS offers Master’s as well as Doctoral studies in Philosophy, encompassing both the Indian and Western Philosophical specializations. As Philosophy overarches beyond any specific subject matter as far as it involves systematic investigation into various sources and methodologies of knowledge, the Master’s Programme in Philosophy at Goa University offers a wide range of courses, both as Core and as Optional that aim to develop critical awareness in understanding other disciplines and subject matters. Built on the classical foundations, the curriculum addresses contemporary developments and prepares the students for an informed and meaningful life. The small classroom size serves well the learning eco-system. Opportunity for student exchange programmes is also available for the students with reputed Universities abroad.\n\nSSPIS has a very robust research programme and students from other reputed Universities both from India and abroad pursue their studies here. Over the years, with sustained efforts of the faculty and students, the Philosophy programme at Goa University has been able to embark on the path towards excellence in teaching and learning. Prof. Ramakant A. Sinari, Prof A.V. Afonso, Prof. U.A. Vinayakumar, Dr. Milan B. Desai, Prof. A. Raghuramaraju and Prof. C.A. Tomy were faculty members of Philosophy here and had contributed to the growth of the discipline.\n\nIn the near future, SSPIS would offer programme of studies in Sanskrit Language and Literature, Computational Linguistics, Pali and Buddhist Studies besides Philosophy. Through these academic programmes, SSPIS aims to explore the dialogical potentials of our ancient knowledge and wisdom traditions with our contemporary concerns in order to build a cosmopolitan knowledge community, capable of addressing the societal challenges from the perspective of the Humanities discipline aimed at molding the enlightened citizens."
