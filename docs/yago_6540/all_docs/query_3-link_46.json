        "text": "This paper presents a study on Brazilian Cinema Marginal film posters. It identifies the political and cultural context of the posters production, and considers their graphic, communicative and meaningful aspects. In 1968, the Institutional Act #5 (AI-5) comes into force in Brazil, and, for the next ten years, the country is haunted by the most violent period of military dictatorship. Cinema Marginal has its heyday between 1968 and 1973, a period marked by the military regime (1964-1985). Such films portray the spirit of that era in dissimilar ways that alternate between eroticism, horror, romance and suspense, often with political messages in subtext. Its main shared characteristics are the subversion of cinematic language and experimental attitude. Such films interact with avant-garde theatre, visual arts and Brazilian popular music, especially with the Tropicalia movement, setting up a privileged moment of creation, despite the sombre political framework.\n\nThis article describes a collection of silent movie posters at the National Library of Sweden (Kungliga biblioteket). The collection, unique in several aspects, has been digitized and made available on the internet. The collection, consisting of 6,200 uncirculated posters, contains original illustrations produced for the domestic market between the years 1896 and 1930, most of them from the 1920s. The films were predominately American, and to a lesser extent European. The posters were illustrated by a small group of illustrators and poster artists, working mainly in Stockholm. This article considers how the posters were made, and the contemporary process of making the digitized posters available on the internet, and offers suggestions for how they may be used by researchers.\n\nThe aim of the present article is to provide an approach to the posters of the main movies producedd in the United States during the World War I (1914-1918) that have any kind of war as its main plot. The research allows us to determine the existence of a particular graphic style associated to war, which helped to build a war imaginary, implemented through a series of movie posters that exemplify this. During this period, the movies produced and released in the United States can be divided in three main categories: the historicist war movies, the pro-government war films and, finally, commercial cinema, with a more marked pacifist tone. In the three groups, film posters played a key role, not only from the commercial point of view, but also in the creation of an intentional speech, of a denotative nature that can be social, political or even philosophical."
