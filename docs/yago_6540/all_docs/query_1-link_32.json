These three friends do not want to get out when they are released. What are Abuzer, Haci and Arap going to do when they will be out? They have no one, no jobs... Apart from Haci and Arap, everything will be the same for Abuzer, who doesn't know where to go. He will still be alone, starving on the streets of the big city.",

        "text": "The idea is interesting (weaving multiple stories together, moving between past and present) but the execution somewhat poor. That could have something to do with the fact that I had really bad copy with sound issues that kind of made my experience fragmented. Güney doesn't save his punches but jumps right to the heart of social issues and this film probably shows best how at sometimes he seems to just poke instead of managing to hit. Then again there is not clear way of life for these people, they are always at the mercy of circumstances and their lives never seem to really go anywhere. There isn't much to say about these characters, they aren't exactly likable but that's not where Güney is going with this. Shattered dreams cannot be glued together and too many cracks in people and their existence becomes inhuman, first for themselves and soon everyone else will see it too.\n\nTurkish neo-reo about ex-cons unable to reintegrate themselves into life outside their prison. I don't have much to say about it, but it was good.\n\nWhat was that ending, though? A moment of homosexual panic as an irrelevant punchline?"
