        "text": "Yılmaz Güney, (April 1, 1937 — September 9, 1984) was a Kurdish film director, scenarist, novelist and actor of Zaza and Kurdish origin. [ [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwsxCJqesJo&feature] ] Many of his works are devoted to the plight of ordinary, middle to low class people in Kurdistan of Turkey. He described himself as an \"assimilated Kurd\". [ [http://www.chris-kutschera.com/A/Yilmaz%20Guney.htm http://www.chris-kutschera.com/A/Yilmaz%20Guney.htm] ]\n\nBiography\n\nYilmaz Guney was born in 1937 in the Yenice village of the southern city of Adana. His father is a Zaza from Varto Turkey and his mother is a Kurd from Siverek, Turkey. Güney studied law and economics at the universities in Ankara and Istanbul, but by the age of 21 he found himself actively involved in filmmaking. As Yeşilçam, the Turkish studio system, grew in strength, a handful of directors, including Atıf Yılmaz, began to use the cinema as a means of addressing the problems of the people. Only state-sanctioned melodramas, war films and play adaptations had previously played in Turkish theaters, but these new filmmakers began to fill the screens with more artistic, personal and relevant pictures of Turkish/Kurdish life. The most popular name to emerge from the Young Turkish Cinema was that of Yılmaz Güney. Güney was a gruff-looking young actor who earned the monicker \"Çirkin Kral,\" (\"the Ugly King\")or (pasha nashrin) in Kurdish. After apprenticing as a screenwriter for and assistant to Atıf Yılmaz, Güney soon began appearing in as many as 20 films a year and became Turkey's most popular actor.\n\nAlthough the early 1960's brought some political reform to Turkey, Güney was imprisoned in 1961 for 18 months for publishing a \"communist\" novel. The country's political situation and Güney's relationship with the authorities only became more tense in the ensuing years. Not content with his star status atop the Turkish film industry, Güney began directing his own pictures in 1965 and, by 1968, had formed his own production company, Güney Filmcilik. Over the next few years, the titles of his films mirrored the feelings of the Kurdish people: Umut (1970); Agit (1972); Aci (1971) ; Umutsuzlar (1971).\n\nAfter 1972, however, Güney would spend most of his life in prison. Arrested for harboring anarchist students, Güney was jailed during preproduction on Zavallılar (1975) (completed in 1975), and before completing Endişe (1974), which was finished in 1974 by Güney's assistant, Şerif Gören. This was a cherished role that Gören would repeat over the next dozen years, directing several scripts that Güney wrote laboriously while behind bars.\n\nReleased from prison in 1974 as part of a general amnesty, Güney was re-arrested that same year for killing the public prosecutor of Yumurtalık district in Adana, Turkey. During this stretch of incarceration, his most successful screenplays were \"Sürü\" (The Herd) (1978) and \"Düşman\" (1979), both directed by Zeki Ökten.\n\n\"The Herd, in fact, is the history of the Kurdish people, but I could not even use the Kurdish language in this film; if we had used Kurdish, all those who took part in this film would have been sent to jail...\" Güney said in his last interview with journalist Chris Kutschera.\n\nAfter escaping from prison in 1981 and fleeing to France, Güney won the Palme d'Or at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival for his film \"Yol\", whose director in the field was once again Şerif Gören. It was not until 1983 that Güney resumed directing, telling a brutal tale of imprisoned children in his final film, Duvar (1983), made in France with the cooperation of the French government.\n\nGüney remains a highly controversial figure in Turkish and Kurdish political and art circles. His works are still highly regarded by cinema critics.\n\nExile and death\n\nGüney was an active member of the \"Türkiye Halk Kurtuluş Partisi-Cephesi\" (THKP-C) (Turkish People's Liberation Party-Front, TPLP-F), thus it is believed this is the reason for his exile, since there are thousands of supporters of the organization in many European countries, such as the UK, France, Germany and Switzerland, seeking for asylum. Yılmaz Güney died of stomach cancer in 1984, in Paris, France.\n\nFilmography\n\nSee also: List of Turkish films\n\nActor\n\n* \"Zavallılar\" (1975)\n\n* \" [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071159/
