        "text": "Palme d’or-winning unfinished YOL is 35 years later still Turkey’s most\n\nimportant film and with its topics more contemporary than ever. Finally,\n\nit has been restored and completed. YOL – THE FULL VERSION recounts, as in YÄ±lmaz Güney’s original script, six, rather than five stories about Turkish and Kurdish prisoners. Each of them attempts to get his life back on track during a week’s leave from prison. For 35 years, the fate of these men and their wives have moved audiences around the world. YOL – THE FULL VERSION is a piece of Turkish-Kurdish film history that is more contemporary than ever. The work is a timeless portrait of a society whose concepts of honor and moral compass are the downfall of men and women alike.\n\nYOL (1982) and YOL – THE FULL VERSION (2017) are films by YÄ±lmaz Güney which Åerif Gören, his long-term assistant, was in charge of shooting. During this process, YÄ±lmaz Güney – like the protagonists of his film – was imprisoned on the island of ImralÄ± and then in Isparta: he could not direct the film himself. He had been condemned to lifelong imprisonment on a politically-motivated charge of murder. YÄ±lmaz Güney convinced the only recently released Åerif Gören to take over directing in his stead. Further works of YÄ±lmaz Güney include THE FATHER [BABA] from 1971, THE POOR ONES [ZAVALLILAR] from 1975 and THE WALL [DUVAR] from 1984."
