        "text": "Today, people in Turkey continue to cherish and revere with a warm sense of nostalgia the locally produced films of the 1960s and 1970s. This era was the “Golden Era” of Yeşilçam, the Turkish Hollywood that takes its name from a street in Beyoğlu where the main production companies were located. The word “Yeşilçam” not only denoted the local film industry but radiated with the dreams of becoming a star for many.\n\nIn the years that film production peaked in Turkey, Yeşilçam had become a foundation of popular culture with its own stars, dream worlds and cultural imagery. As it was the home of film production companies and the film market and due to its leading role in most Turkish films, Istanbul was associated with Yeşilçam. In 1971—its most productive year, with 266 film productions—Yeşilçam was addressing not only the urban audience and the rural migrants newly settled in the city but also provincial audiences all around Anatolia. The golden years of Yeşilçam also coincided with the interim period between the coups of 1961 and 1980: a period marked by increasing class differences, a deepening income gap and violent clashes between the left and the right. The official ideology of one, classless, homogenous nation had ceased to secure harmony, leading to social unrest and discontent. Thus, one reason for these films’ popularity was that they made a spectacle out of the desire for a better life, wealth and luxury through the scenes of life in Istanbul.\n\nYeşilçam’s Istanbul was home to the stories of families wrecked by their struggles with poverty, of young girls straying down the “wrong” path in the pursuit of a wealthy life, and of young men going rogue while trying to save their families from misery; stories all woven together by the desire and fear of the transformation that the city came to represent. In a period when class conflict and lifestyle differences were crushing the dreams of a classless, homogeneous Turkish society, Yeşilçam was expressing social anxieties through the different faces of Istanbul. As the borders of the city kept expanding, the Land and Sea Walls that surrounded the city for centuries kept winking at us through the representations of Istanbul in Yeşilçam, despite their isolation and dilapidated state.\n\nMise-en-Scène: Walls as Liminal Spaces\n\nWhen we look at the images of the city that Yeşilçam has produced, we see that the city walls have two main functions in the films. Regardless of the genre, walls as the margins and as the boundaries of the city acquire meaning according to these two primary physical functions they served. The exhibition pamphlet for “On the Margins: Istanbul Land Walls,” organized at the Research Center for Anatolian Civilizations (ANAMED) between October 19, 2016 and January 8, 2017, stresses that walls as margins define the social life around them:\n\nThe spirit of the Land Walls was shaped by the walls’ location at the periphery of the city, and some functions located in this area, some of the people settled here and certain events taking place here had a ‘dissenting’ nature that could only be situated at the fringes of the city rather than its centre.\n\nJean-François Pérouse’s observations on life around the walls in 2003 are in a similar vein, as he writes: “[...] the walls constitute a sort of extraterritorial poverty, an anti-world or an interior margin, protecting and hiding the entire pressure of the city they’re surrounding. It is as if this old boundary, neglected or even abused, is re-transformed with functions that are deemed denigrating.”[1] [translation mine]\n\nThroughout history, city walls, built as margins and borders, have come to determine the social life they surround, hosting, as it were, communities otherwise marginalized due to their lifestyle, occupation and class. More often than not, the city walls in Yeşilçam films are associated with isolation, danger, illegal activities and outcasts. Aside from these associations, the walls are a spatial metaphor used to denote the turning points or main conflicts in the protagonist’s life in the film narratives. As we will see in different scenes in the following pages, the walls emerge in the cultural imagery as a boundary between interior/exterior, new town/old town, past/present/future, security/danger, familiarity/alienation, and tradition/modernity. In this sense, the walls in Yeşilçam films are liminal spaces.\n\nThe concept of liminality in anthropology is used to describe a state of transitionality and marginality, being in-between two social categories or positions. Liminality, first coined as a term in the context of rites of initiation in relation to symbolism, is used today in a myriad of disciplines, and even for spaces themselves. In this usage, the borders are liminal spaces due to their position in between two geographically, politically and socially defined regions; a go-between area where the identity of one fades into that of the other. Similarly, it can be said that the city walls draw the boundaries of the historical nucleus of the city and, as such, constitute a cultural and symbolic threshold between different meanings attributed to the city. There are two other liminal lines in relation to the walls; the suburban railway line following the sea walls and Kennedy Avenue, which transformed the city radically by coming in between the sea and the Sea Walls. This article will analyze the different meanings and associations of the city walls in the films produced between the years 1960 and 1980, in relation to the different spatial functions they assume in connection to these two liminal lines.\n\nWalls as the Boundaries of the Mahalle\n\nThe mahalle is one of the main settings of the Yeşilçam films from the 1960s, when migration to Istanbul was transforming the city at a dizzying pace. In these films the mahalle was portrayed as a safe haven of social harmony and solidarity that surpasses the different dispositions of its residents. During this tumultuous period between the 1960 coup and the 1980 coup, the mahalle[2] surfaces as a nostalgic construct as well as a solution to a social problem.\n\nThe mahalle is the backbone of a typical Yeşilçam mise-en-scène: a village-like oasis amidst the urban cosmopolitanism, with narrow wooden houses adjacent to small apartments, shopkeepers playing backgammon at the coffeehouse on the tiny square, chicken coops next to the houses, vegetable gardens and rude boys and children running after automobiles that rarely visit their dusty street. The neighborhoods surrounded by the walls fit such mise-en-scènes like a glove. The vast stretch of empty fields outside the land walls, the beautiful view from the sea walls, the trains passing through the neighborhoods and the vicinity to monumental spaces made the city walls a highly preferred setting to carry the city to rural audiences.\n\nOn the other hand, Yeşilçam narratives had been seeking to narrate the issue of social mobility in this period. The protagonists were not only weaving their paths between poverty and wealth and provinciality and urbanism, but also between virtue and vice and alienation and solidarity. Such traversing reflects on the settings as binaries of street/home, day/night, and inside/outside. City walls are also used as a part of the description of these binaries, as a threshold between the meanings attributed to them.\n\nIntramural neighborhoods starred in the films due to their preservation of the “old Istanbul” texture up until the 1960s. In contrast, in the films about the rural-urban migration, new settlements lining up on the hills of the Bosphorus or outside the walls near Zeytinburnu are preferred. The “invasion” of the neighborhoods and their alienation brought about by modernization and rapid urbanization is represented either through the plot thickening with the desire for a luxurious life, or symbolized by evacuation orders and American cars. In Yeşilçam films set in intramural neighborhoods in this period when the city limits still coincided with the Land Walls, the walls form a mise-en-scène that marks the margins of the safe haven of the mahalle. In this article, we examine how the city walls are incorporated into the imagery of Yeşilçam through their use in mise-en-scènes to evoke notions of rootedness, stability, homogeneity and protection.\n\nToday, the mahalle has not only persevered as an administrative unit and a socio-economic indicator; it also continues to play a significant role in cultural imagery as a bridge to the past, despite the radical urban transformation. The intramural neighborhoods, some of which are transformed to the point of unrecognizability while were others completely demolished, were established right after the conquest of Constantinople.[3] During the 1960s and 1970s, the physical structure of the neighborhoods changed quickly due to the rapid growth of the city and the separation of the neighborhoods from the sea with the construction of Kennedy Avenue. However, as we will see in the following film analyses, the significance of the mahalle for social life and cultural imagery persisted.\n\nIn his study titled “Bir Mahallenin Doğumu ve Ölümü” (“The Birth and Death of a Mahalle”), Cem Behar stresses that it is imperative that we think of a mahalle not as a physical unit but as a network of social relations. According to Behar, the reason for the mahalles’ survival over centuries is their mobility and flexibility. Mahalles are able to remain intact through centuries, yet they also assimilate new life practices within themselves thanks to their flexibility: “The mahalle is first and foremost a space where people are neighbors and where human relationships are based on being neighbors. It is a bundle of face-to-face, dense daily relationships people and families, women men and children form with each other; whether it is through shopping, praying, playing or conversing.”[4]\n\nThe image of the mahalle portrayed in the Yeşilçam films of the period does not fall far from the description above. In the Yeşilçam’s mahalles, men socialize at the coffeehouse, women chat over the windows or by the stoops, and the poor and the rich live on the same streets—streets which are protected by an unwritten code of honor. It is depicted as a space where everyone looks after each other and feels a deep sense of belonging towards their fellow mahalleli against the backdrop of urban chaos and cruelty, in a city which we see stretch over the horizon. In this period, such a depiction is frequently painted by Akbıyık Mahallesi and the square surrounding the Cankurtaran Station. In many films shot in this area, such as “100 Numaralı Adam” (Man of the Hour, Dir: Osman F. Seden, 1978), “Sarmaş Dolaş” (Warm Embrace, Dir: Ümit Efekan, 1977), “Şeref Kavgası” (Fight for Honour, Dir: Mehmet Aslan, 1966), “Yumurcak” (Little Rascal, Dir: Türker İnanoğlu, 1969), the borders of the mahalle are drawn by the railway, city walls and Kennedy Avenue. The relations that form the mahalle are symbolized by the shopkeepers such as the butcher, the grocer, the gardener and the coffee shop owner.\n\nYeşilçam films often seek to uphold the virtues and the “essence” of Turkish culture against the threat of excessive Westernization, while criticizing the regressive tendencies of traditionalism. Therefore, mahalles are not only picture-perfect safe havens but also suffocating and conservative environments that can drive their youth to the corruptive tendencies of the big city. We can better grasp these two aspects of the mahalle imagery, especially in melodramas, through the comings and goings of the characters as well as the binary of inside/outside. This binary is spatialized through images of the suburban railway, Kennedy Avenue or the city walls—all separating and linking the mahalle and the city, inside and outside. We encounter a striking example of such a mise-en-scène in “Sözde Kızlar” (So-Called Girls, Dir: Nejat Saydam, 1967).\n\nAn Example of Spatial Binaries: “So-Called Girls”\n\n“Sözde Kızlar” tells the story of young women from the slums who are running to the city, which ultimately corrupts them. The film turns the issue of modernization into a gendered and spatial metaphor. This is a typical Yeşilçam narrative, both in the way it describes the mahalle and the way it bases itself on the binaries of old/new and traditional/modern. The protagonist is Mebrure; she becomes a morphine addict at the hands of her acquaintances, to whom she is entrusted after her father’s death. Mebrure is saved later in the film thanks to a righteous young man, Fahri. The side characters, Ayşe, Saliha and the other young women from mahalle, change their identities and guises everyday as they leave their mahalle and run to the glamorous streets of uptown neighborhoods (Nişantaşı, Teşvikiye, Şişli). As is the case in most Yeşilçam melodramas, the young women are trapped by prostitution, alcohol and drugs when they seek to free themselves from the constraints of their families and their mahalle. At the end of the film, the “so-called girls” restore their old identities and lives, with the joint efforts of the Vice Department, Fahri, the men of the mahalle and Mebrure. What renders this film interesting for our article is the way it delivers this familiar story in a very economic and striking manner through the use of space.\n\nThroughout the film, the “so-called girls” leave their identity behind as they venture into the city every day. We see Ayşe/Ayla/Aynur as she is dropped off at the Topkapı bus stop by a fancy car. On the one side of the motorway is the hustle and bustle of the cars and trucks coming into the city, on the other a narrow trail that leads to the mahalle through the cracks of the crumbling city wall. Ayla/Aynur/Ayşe disappears on this very trail after she ridicules her fiancé, who confronts her about her comings and goings.\n\nLater in the film, we see the four young women in front of newly built suburban villas in Levent. Here, it is as if the invisible shackles on their feet are broken. Their timid gait and modest outfits are replaced with self-confidence and swaying moves. The camera pans out of their dazzling walk and focus on the teenagers following them. We see a suburban settlement with vast empty fields in horizon and isolated streets, which is in stark contrast with the mahalle, which resembles a tight-knit fabric weaving all residents together. Such spatial contrast and the lack of control over female bodies are often reiterated in the film.\n\nThe transformation of Aynur, whose image is that of a body seeping out of the cracks of tumbling walls, is the epitome of Yeşilçam’s gender anxiety. The boundaries of the mahalle and the city walls are as porous as they are sturdy: this image recounts the idea that what is old (tradition) is falling apart and needs to be repaired with the right tools. To put it differently, it is implied that the problem lies at the imbalance between modernity and tradition. This imbalance is translated to the use of space through the binaries of railway/automobile and suburbia/intramural mahalle.\n\nBeyond the Mahalle: Outside the Walls Lies the Unknown\n\nDuring the 1960s, Yeşilçam experienced its golden age both due to the increase in film production and the rise of cinema as a popular cultural medium. The main function of the walls in these films is the separation of the inside and outside of the mahalle, as well as between the city center and the outskirts. This is most evident in the melodramas shot in locations by the suburban railway between Sirkeci and Kazlıçeşme stations. The melodramatic narrative structure is dominant in Yeşilçam productions regardless of the genre. Such structure portrays the protagonists’ worlds through binaries such as good/bad, hero/villain, honest/dishonest, oppressed/oppressor, day/night, and home/street as we watch our heroes traverse between the two ends. In the melodramatic universe, life is precarious: everyone can turn out to be a villain or a victim, lose their identity or are in a constant state of being tested by fate. Within this context, sensations, mise-en-scène and use of space carry the burden of expression. It is through the setting that the narrative conveys meaning, emotion and action.\n\nAs such, we encounter protagonists standing on top of the walls and taking one look at the horizon and to the unknown future and another look at the neighborhood and to responsibilities and obligations—the mundane life. In these turning points, Yeşilçam narratives spatialize the threshold between the habitudinal present and the ambivalent future through the city walls. In this part of the article, we will discuss the relationship of the two types of characters with the walls: lovers and tramps.\n\nIdling over the Walls: “Avare” Films\n\nA typical example of walls starring as liminal spaces occurs in Avare films.[5] This sub-genre emerged after Raj Kapor’s “Awaara” became a great hit in Turkey, and Yeşilçam producers decided to ride the wave of success with their own renditions of the film. Avare films center the narrative around poor, unemployed, sometimes homeless, single male characters who seize the day without any aspirations.[6] We often encounter beautiful views of the walls and the landscapes as seen from the walls in these films.\n\nAvares are men (and in rare cases, women) who refuse to conform to social norms or to be drifted away by the dreams of climbing up the social ladder. Instead, they choose to spend their time enjoying themselves. There are also avares who stagger between continuing their carefree lives and becoming rich the easy way. These characters are either pushed to a life of work and marriage due to social pressures or they make the audience laugh with the adventures of vagabond living. They are frequently pictured on the edges of the mahalle, over the walls, under the bridges or by the railroad, as they spend their time watching the city, drinking wine and cursing at their own lives. We also run into them fighting by the Sea Walls or shooting crabs at İncili Köşk. Typically identified by gambling, drinking, womanizing and pickpocketing, avares idle around the walls. Although they are known and cared for by their neighbors, they are ostracized on account of their bad habits, as made evident by their placement in the margins, by the walls.\n\nA good example of an avare film is “Avare Mustafa” (Mustafa the Vagrant, Dir: Memduh Ün, 1961). Mustafa is fresh out of military service, still to find a job, with three siblings and parents expecting him to earn his share. He, on the other hand, prefers to slack around with his friends Sülo and Gypsy Murat. The three pals dream of opening their meatball restaurant, becoming their own bosses and answering to no one. Along comes a big shot, Mr. Zülfikar, who is determined to build an apartment block on the empty field where the kids play football. When his daughter falls in love with Mustafa, Mr. Zülfikar “buys” Mustafa and his family, who are now leading a life dictated by his whims.\n\nDuring the film, we see the walls twice: The climax of the story is when Mustafa is confronted by his girlfriend Aynur, who hears he is about to get married. As we listen to Mustafa sweet talk Aynur, we watch the dilapidated Land Walls in the background. He convinces Aynur that they will remain lovers, and together they dream about the meatball restaurant and apartment blocks. Their dreams are as precarious as the Land Walls they walk by, as the film ultimately shows us.\n\nMustafa is not alone in his aspirations to get to a better place in society. Ayşecik tries to convince her vagrant friend to try and make a place for himself in society in “Ayşecik Sokak Kızı” (Ayşecik the Street Urchin, Dir: Ülkü Erakalın, 1966). She will later find out that this man is her long-lost father, after persuading him to give up drinking and idling: “I was telling myself ‘This is no life to live, one day something will happen and I’ll be saved, yet I didn’t know when that beacon of hope will appear or who this person would be.’” Tired of having no one and no home, Ayşecik tells Murat he can change their destiny if he agrees to become a singer, as they stand on the Sea Walls, looking at the horizon, where future opportunities lie.\n\nSelim, Suphi, Bekir and Niyazi are another band of cronies, nesting in the walls in “Mahalle Arkadaşları” (Friends from the Hood, Dir: Metin Erksan, 1961). Director Metin Erksan adapted Steinbeck’s Cannery Row, choosing to narrate the story in Haliç, Cankurtaran and Ayvansaray. Captain Selim and his young deckhand Niyazi are close friends with Suphi, Bekir and Niyazi, the vagrant lot of the neighborhood. Selim grows distant from his friends as he tries to prove his dad of his serious intentions so that he can marry his girlfriend. His buddies get cross with him and say:\n\n“We are pleased with the way we live. Laziness is a great virtue.”\n\n“It’s fit for kings.”\n\n“Instead of earning our comfort, we get comfortable without working.”\n\nIndeed, these pals know how to make themselves comfortable as they lie on the walls as if they are velvet couches, drinking wine and watching the Golden Horn over Tekfur Palace. They do not heed to Selim’s advice, as they are happy with their lives, and they continue to live in the ruins of the old palace. They tell him these derelict places are “for demons only,” and that there is “no place for angels here.” Selim yearns for a settled life and spends his life between Şişhane Bridge and his boat, while his buddies get wasted on the top of the walls or sleep among the ruins. They do not mingle with the crowds and remain the kings of their rundown castle.\n\nThe protagonist of “Kalbimdeki Yabancı” (The Stranger in my Heart, Dir: Sırrı Gültekin, 1968), Orhan, is a young man and an unemployed orphan in his village who gets caught up in the promises of Istanbul. He can find no job as he has no one to vouch for him, so he takes a rest on the walls after a long day of searching. It is here he comes across a rich man who is in trouble and who is his doppelganger:\n\n“It’s marvelous, there is virtually no difference between me and you”\n\n“There is, you are elegant and I am not”\n\n“I wish I were like you, neither rich nor elegant”\n\nOsman’s luck finally turns when he is least expecting, in a city in which he does not stand a chance. He and the man change identities. Osman manages to get rid of the man who has been chasing the “Gentleman,” and he goes down to Kennedy Avenue. By that time, he has become the “Gentleman,” with his chauffeur and his car waiting for his arrival. Between the motorway where the traffic rushes into the city center and the humble suburban line, on the top of abandoned city walls, Osman has changed his identity. From then on, his place is not the crumbling walls, the slums for the new migrants, nor the intramural neighborhoods with the monotonous rhythm of life. He jumps into a brand-new American sports car, driving to the villas of Levent. He has finally stepped over the threshold.\n\nLove on the Walls\n\nJust like the avares, the lovers looking to avoid gossip meet on top of the walls. Poor lovers who cannot marry due to their families make plans to jump over the fences of their neighborhoods and their families, in a warm embrace on the walls or by the railroad, far from the curious stares of the neighbors. In a similar vein to the avares, lovers are stuck in between the dreams of a better life and the obligation to live by the rules set by the wants and expectations of their families. In the Yeşilçam universe young women are always vulnerable: they are open to slander and harassment, prone to “selling themselves” to a rich family in pursuit of a better life. Young men are vulnerable too, as they cannot “control” their lovers because they are too poor, or they must leave their dreams aside to take care of their families. The ambivalent position of the couples is once more depicted by the railway and the walls.\n\nMaking Love in Sheltered Corners: Melodramatic Portrayals\n\nPerhaps one of the sweetest examples of lovers seeking refuge in the nooks of the walls is the scene of Selma and Ahmet’s meeting in “Bekçi Murtaza” (Murtaza the Nightwatch, Dir: Tunç Başaran, 1965). Selma’s father is a despotic night guard who follows the rules to the letter, suffocating everyone around him. She meets her lover Ahmet secretly. As Selma’s father Murtaza is a menace to the workers in the factory, the workers start looking for a way to hurt him, including through his daughter. Murtaza wants Selma to marry a rich and old man from Izmir. Selma tells the news to Ahmet on the walls. The two separate worlds in which Selma lives are linked by the sound bridge, and the films weaves the incidents together by her coming and going between her home and the walls. As Selma tells Ahmet that she is to get married, the sharp whistle of the train suppresses their voices. Their desperation translates into their muteness. The impossibility of their relationship is accentuated with the image of rundown walls, while the fast train is juxtaposed against the lovers’ inaptitude to move beyond their conditions.\n\nAnother aspect of the use of walls as safe havens for lovers is the realism it introduces, as it is often the case that lovers meet in the isolated corners to avoid conformist neighbors, and it makes it easier for the audience to be immersed in the film as it follows their expectations. As the lovers take a stroll on the walls or by the railway, we take pleasure in secretly witnessing their love. Gülizar in “Kamil Abi” (Brother Kamil, Dir: Yavuz Yalınkılınç, 1963) and Ayşe in “Beş Milyoncuk Borç Verir Misin?” (Can You Loan Me 5 Millions?, Dir: Osman F. Seden, 1975) confide their troubles in their lovers on the top of the walls and by the railroad. They also confide in us as they whisper their secrets to their lovers, secrets which cannot be told in public. It is through these conversations in these locations that the narratives take a different course. One of the most memorable of these secret meetings is in “Nereden Çıktı Bu Velet?” (Where Did This Kid Come From?, Dir: Osman F. Seden, 1975). Hale is a babysitter for a toddler who inherits millions. After the toddler goes missing, her path crosses with Zeki. They pretend to be lovers to dodge the man following Hale. They embrace until the man is gone and have their first kiss. As the ruse becomes real, we the audience follow their shy flirtations behind the back of the man. Zeki and Hale kiss and embrace between the vegetable gardens stretching across the railway and the old car, allowing us to enjoy both the landscape and the sight of their romance in an example of lovers meeting in blind corners. The isolation that protects the lovers from evil eyes means danger for other characters.\n\nOutside the Walls: Deserted, Secluded and Dangerous\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the green belt which stretched alongside the land walls was maintained in spite of the expansion of Zeytinburnu, just outside the walls. This empty stretch of land, with the land walls and their towers rising northward over the bumpy terrain, was often the background in adventure and action films targeting a young male audience with stories of vengeance and crime. It is possible that the land walls provided both technical ease for the wide angles necessary for action scenes and an overall pleasing perspective. On the other hand, as we have stressed through this article, the association of the surroundings of the wall with danger and desertion, which continues to haunt Istanbulites today, and the position of the Land Walls between the maritime traffic and highway traffic pouring in from Topkapı are important factors for the preference of the location for these films.\n\nIn action films and crime dramas such as “Şeytanın Kurbanları” (Victims of the Devil, Dir: Nejat Okçugil, 1973), “Yarınsız Adam”(The Man without Tomorrow, Dir: Remzi Jöntürk, 1976), “Büyük Bela” (Great Trouble, Dir: T. Fikret Uçak, 1972) , “Baba Kartal” (Father Eagle, Dir: Cüneyt Arkın, 1978), “Jilet Kazım” (Kazım the Razor, Dir: Yılmaz Atadeniz, 1971) , “Zavallılar” (The Wretched, Dir: Atıf Yılmaz/Yılmaz Güney, 1974) and “Yılan Soyu” ( The Viper, Dir: Hidayet Pelit, 1969), we see the Land Walls, extending towards Edirnekapı from the Yedikule Fortress, as places where the protagonist is set up, money is exchanged for contraband, drug addicts live or dirty business is handled. Unfortunately, to this day, residents of intramural neighborhoods complain about the how the dereliction of the walls has resulted in illegal transactions. Therefore, the walls in Yeşilçam films host spies, smugglers, assassins and mafia, using the imagery already settled in the minds of the audience.\n\n“Şeytanın Kurbanları” (Victims of the Devil) narrates the struggle of Ahmet, who is caught in the world of crime. Ahmet’s father is proud of his son, who told him he is working as a manager in a company, but he is in fact going down the wrong path, as the film title warns us. He has become rich through smuggling and leading a life on a knife edge. He gets ambushed and almost gets killed one day, during a delivery around the Yedikule Fortress. In another film, right at the same spot, the character of Murat finds himself in a deadly trap. Murat, the protagonist of “Büyük Bela” (Great Trouble), has recently migrated to the city but is unable to find a job as he briefly did time in jail. He is thrilled to find a job thanks to an old friend he runs into, and he can finally feed his family. Little does he know that he is in fact working for a crime ring dealing in passport fraud, car theft and smuggling. When he gets suspicious, his boss sets him up and Murat finds himself in an armed conflict with the police along the walls by Yedikule. In the close-up scenes, we even get to closely examine the structure of the walls.\n\n“Yılan Soyu” (The Viper) is one of the adventure films where Ayhan Işık plays an Interpol agent. In the film, ship captain Orhan finds himself on the wrong side of a great arms-smuggling ring. In the midst of a torrent of adventures, he meets Pervin, who secretly aids him, by Silivrikapı. Orhan rushes up a tower when he notices Pervin, yet he finds Pervin to be stabbed and left posed standing up by the tower window. The conspirators get a hold of Pervin before Orhan and ambush him. Orhan gets hit on his neck as he is running away and finds himself in the dungeons. He is now in a test orchestrated by Interpol to see if he is worthy of working as an agent.\n\nTwo years later, Murat, played by Ayhan Işık again, is waging a different war against smugglers. In “Ölümden Korkmuyorum” (I’m Not Afraid of Death, Dir: Nazmi Özer, 1971), Murat seeks to get closer to a drug ring to fight against those who dragged his son into addiction. He contacts a pot-smoking hippy near Cankurtaran, as it was known at the time that foreign hippies gathered in the vicinity. Hippies in Yeşilçam were often associated with immorality, vagrancy and substance abuse, and they are the consumers of smuggled goods. In this film, we have a brief encounter with walls as places where addicts buy and use drugs, as a liminal space between established neighborhoods and the railway/walls where dirty business takes place. Only a few steps away from the married and virtuous women of the mahalle sit the immoral hippies who enjoy being beaten up, smoking weed and cheating people. As Murat threatens a hippie girl on their way down to Kennedy Avenue, towards the crowd, people tell Murat not to hurt the girl. Murat tells them this is his daughter and says that he is beating her up because she is walking around “in such outfit,” a reaction lauded by the people of this mahalle. It seems like the walls stand as a border right between social control and complete chaos.\n\nBaba Kartal (Father Eagle) is shot amidst the left-right conflict and social realism debates of the 1960s and 1970s. The film is molded by the influence of the demand for social equality and justice, or to put it more correctly, it sought for a different aesthetic and narrative structure in order to turn this influence into popularity. The film tells the story of Kartal’s involvement in the world of crime upon arriving to Istanbul after growing tired of the feudal order in his village, and he is set on seeking a better future for his kids. In contrast to the title sequences depicting the Istanbul of the 1960s with glamour, new experiences and beauty, the film, shot on the eve of the 1980 coup, opens with the view of masses pouring into Istanbul through Haydarpaşa Station. Up until the middle of the film, Kartal and his sons appear as small figures, either tucked within the crowd or huddled up in their small, desolate room. Kartal cannot find a job, and when he does, he is dismissed when he stands against injustice. After being swindled out of the rest of his money, Kartal sees no point in remaining clean and accepts to become a hired gun. When he completes his first mission, he calls his boss who asks him to come “to the top of the walls in Yenikapı.” With a sharp sound of the train whistle, the camera pans over to Kartal and Rafet standing atop the walls. Noticing his reluctance to kill, Rafet tells Kartal that “you can’t be stupid enough to take me down with you, think of your kids,” and adds “you will earn even more. You’ll get a hundred thousand liras. Enjoy it. Forget about the murder, forget about me. We will not meet again, OK?” Rafet writes a cheque on Kemal’s chest; Kemal is leaning on the walls, while Rafet is standing towards the sea. It is the last scene we see Kemal entrenched in his misery, and this scene too portrays the walls as a liminal space between the present and the future of the protagonist. Kemal’s transition from his one-bedroom misery and desperation to a large flat with a view and infinite opportunities is depicted via the spatial change, the turning point of the transition taking place on the walls.\n\n“Zavallılar” (The Wretched, Dir: Yılmaz Güney-Atıf Yılmaz, 1974) is a film Yılmaz Güney started directing and left in Atıf Yılmaz’s hands after he was imprisoned. The film, shot in 1974, opens with the images of laborers, orphans and the urban poor striding through the muddy streets of the city. Yılmaz Güney’s Istanbul is not a treasure to be hunted—it is a destitute city full of misery and sinister people. Abu, Arap and Hacı are three friends who do not want to be released from prison as they have no other place to go. The film tells their story as they venture into parts of the city no one else is willing to see or go to. Through their adventures, we encounter the urban dwellers that we would rather look away from. Atıf Yılmaz explain about the three characters, who are searching around the walls for a lost friend who is in a terrible state:\n\nLater, these three poor people go out to find an old friend, from whom they hope to get some food. The drug addicts, broken and miserable people taking shelter in Ayvansaray walls symbolize Abu, Arap and Hacı’s future. We finished the film with a focus on the three characters, who are about to disappear in a worse, more hopeless future, spiraling down to more crime, a future where these three friends will betray each other for a petty gain, for which they will forever feel agony.[7]\n\nAs opposed to the other films, in Zavallılar we encounter the walls not as a barrier or a border but as a shelter. After long struggles, the threesome reaches the Ayvansaray walls to ask drug addicts where they can find their friend Muhlis the Blonde. They find out that Muhlis is now a dealer and would not be hanging around here. In pitch dark, we watch the faces of the addicts and hear their breathing. This time, the walls are not a threshold, they are merely a part of a vicious circle. As Atıf Yılmaz interpreted it, it is clear that the three friends, if they survive, will end up in these walls or in prison. In the next scene, we watch Abu, Arap and Hacı as they look at the American cars rushing through İstiklal Avenue and gape at the hot meals on display. After their last meal together, Arap and Hacı bail on Abu without paying the bill. Abu is lucky to run into a friendly officer and is released. Yet he has no place to go. The three finally go down the drains of what Atıf Yılmaz calls “human sewage.”\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this article we analyzed how the walls are represented and with which situations and characters they are associated in the Yeşilçam films produced between 1960 and 1980.\n\nIn popular cultural imagery, the walls are associated with desolation, inauspiciousness and danger due to their derelict state and the marginal space they occupy in the city.\n\nSuch associations led to the walls hosting marginalized and socially precarious characters in the films. The walls are also the border between the new and the old city and, together with Kennedy Avenue and the railway, they divided the established urban life from suburbia and the new migrant settlements. This spatial significance is translated to the role of the walls as a symbolic threshold, a liminality in Yeşilçam films. This liminal quality is used to describe the ambivalent situation of the vagrants, male heroes involved in dirty business, young women seeking to liberate themselves from their communities, and the lovers. The use of the walls in mise-en-scènes visualized the climax of the narratives as well as the in-betweenness of the characters. The walls, however, did not star in historical films, and when they did, they had to settle with being extras in roles irrelevant to their past."
