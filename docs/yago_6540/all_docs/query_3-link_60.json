I would like to add Sami Al-Ramadhani and Heiny Srour for their illumination and encouragement, over a period of ten and more years, of my I\n\nwould\n\nextraordinary\n\nlike to thank\n\nfor\n\nhis\n\nassistance\n\nactivity in this arena. I would like to express gratitude to coundess students and individuals from different nations of the South for their discussions, arguments, challenges, from my undergraduate days onwards. I must acknowledge indebtedness to Harold Weaver, whose readings for his 1981 course on Third World cinema at Smith College underlined for me the importance of this project. I found further stimulation for the project in the international conference\n\non Third World cinemas at Hunter College, New York, in April-May 1983, which I organized in conjunction with the Camera News collective, and which was funded by the New York Council for the Humanities, the New York State Council on the Arts, the Film Fund and the Smithsonian InsUtute. Still further incentive was provided by the series of screenings and seminars I organized in Hunter College with nationals of the countries concerned during 1985: of Iranian, Turkish, Chinese, Filipino and a number of Arab films. I record with sorrow the premature death of Margaret Pennar, a marvelous activist in this area, whose passing robbed this volume of a chapter on the major cinema of Egypt Yiannis Kitromilides provided his customary intellectual and moral wisdom. Dick Hensman's work gave me the basic concept. Patrick and Annie Duffy-McAleese kept me supplied with information and much more. Stansil Lamb continued to be much more father than father-in-law. Corinna, Anneli, Juanita and Jamal remained their delightful selves. And with Ash Corea I experienced as ever the stimulation, the panache, the warmth and the love, to sustain an aberrant vision of a differendy ordered planet Earth.\n\nDigitized by the Internet Archive in\n\n2011\n\nhttp://www.archive.org/details/filmpoliticsinthOOdown\n\nForeword\n\nt;.le\n\nvariety\n\nand energy of\n\ncultures, political\n\nmovements, cinemas, which\n\nWorld, are not indicated by the term \"Third World\".

But neither do they represent\n\nmore than a\n\nfraction of the international reality of the South.

As a result, fewer films are made, less reputation problems of distribution and sub-titling, along with the culture of disdain or patronisation for the South - not to mention basic ignorance -- that perm-\n\neates film circles as\n\nmuch\n\nas other intellectual milieux in the North, and\n\nhardly surprising that 'Third World\" films get marginalized there.\n\ndoes not It\n\nmean is\n\nthat they are\n\nthe\n\naim of\n\nthis\n\nIt\n\nit is\n\ncertainly\n\nindeed marginal.\n\nvolume\n\nto help to redress that balance, in the\n\ndovetailed interests of communicating the fascination of little-known\n\nartistic\n\nexcellence (with a political sting), and of developing international comprehen-\n\nwhich seems bent on understanding neither others nor itself. cinema histories and film-makers has been based on four criteria: 1) to give most of the stage to voices from the sion in a nation\n\nThe\n\nselection of films, national\n\nSouth; 2) to provide a spread of information across a variety of nations; 3) to\n\nconsider the availability of the films discussed inside the\n\nUSA;\n\n4) to intro-\n\nduce a US audience to inaccessible films and unknown film-makers.

The other will be edited by Teshome Gabriel of the UCLA X^^ Film and Theatre Arts Department. ^ This present text is the third in a sequence written by the author.

Although African film-\n\nappropriate\n\nAfrica since 1979\n\nis\n\nmore things making has come a long way\n\nand infrastructure since its changed over the two decades of its history in terms of production, distribution, exhibition, and scholarship. First of all, in spite of government intervention in some countries to create parastatal institutions to enhance their film industry and in spite of efforts of individual film-makers to organize in order to more effectively promote their craft, the African film industry continues to be plagued by a chronic lack of capital, equipment, production facilities and effective distribution and shaky beginnings\n\nin quality, quantity\n\nin the 1950s, little has\n\nexhibition channels, nationalization decrees notwithstanding.\n\nThe\n\nresult is a\n\ncontinued inundation of African screens with escapist foreign films of\n\ndubious quality and relevance. Secondly, African film-making continues to be the activity par excellence of North and situation in the early\n\nWest\n\nAfricans, a repetition, in this area, of a similar\n\n1960s when the hterary scene was also dominated by\n\nNorth and West Africans. More specifically, in the case of the latter, it is the cineastes from the so-called \"Francophone\" countries of Senegal, Mali, the Ivory Coast, Upper Volta, Niger, and Cameroun who continue to be responsible not only for the overwhelming majority of productions in that region but also for the patently socio-political orientation, a characteristic of\n\nof these films.\n\nA\n\nmany\n\ncause for concern and self-introspection on the part of the\n\n\"Anglophones\" and\n\nfrustration for the film festival organizer or scholar in\n\nsearch of quality productions\n\nby the former,\n\nthis\n\n\"Francophone\" domination\n\nhas not, however, gone unchallenged in recent years by efforts (albeit\n\ncomparatively mediocre) principally from Ghana and Nigeria. Although these efforts\n\nhave so\n\nfar\n\ndone\n\nlittle to alter\n\nrecent appearance and activities of such\n\nCham's essay\n\nfirst\n\nradically the current imbalance, the\n\nunknowns\n\nas\n\nKwah Ansah\n\nappeared in Presence Africaine #124, 1982.\n\n13\n\nof Ghana\n\n14 Film Production\n\nand Eddie\n\nUgboma\n\nin\n\nWest Africa\n\nof Nigeria have been\n\namong\n\nthe interesting developments\n\nlandscape of African film production.\n\nin the\n\nThe conspicuous dearth of critical\n\nstudies devoted to this subject\n\nmany\n\nfunction partly of the difficult access to\n\nAfrican films due to\n\nis\n\na\n\ndistri-\n\nbution problems, and partly of the lack of outlets for scholarly and popular criticism.\n\nThe few\n\ncritical\n\nworks\n\nthat exist are again\n\nindividuals from the ''Francophone\" areas and, even here,\n\nPaulin\n\nmainly products of it is\n\none individual,\n\nSoumanou Vieyra of Senegal, whose name has become synonymous\n\nfew years, there have been \"Anglophone\" publications, such as the widely-circulated West Africa, have begun to pubUsh film reviews and general pieces by African scholars such as Niyi Osundare and Lindsay Barrett. Also worth singling out is the symposium on film and its relationship to cultural identity in Nigeria held at the University of Lagos in 1979 and sponsored by the Nigerian National Council for Arts and Culture. The proceedings of this symposium are gathered in a book entitled The Development and Growth of the Film Industry in Nigeria} Our intention is not to set up an invidious comparison between \"Francophone\" and \"Anglophone\" achievements in this area. None the less, attention needs to be drawn to the apparent neglect or low priority which seems to be the unfortunate fate, in \"Anglophone\" West Africa, of this extremely powerful and effective medium of socio-political analysis. Film in Senegal - a country less endowed economically than either Nigeria or Ghana, and disposing of practically no film-making facilities — has managed to achieve in a short period of time a level of maturity and sophistication that has won it both continental and international acclaim and puts it on an equal footing with that country's equally highly acclaimed creative writing. The same cannot be said for either Nigeria or Ghana, whose creative literary repertory is far ahead of film both in quality and quantity. This is especially disturbing in the case of Ghana which, from the time of Nkrumah, could boast not only of a parastatal Ghana Film Industry\n\nwith\n\nfilm\n\ncriticism.\n\nHowever,\n\nencouraging signs of change in\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nlast\n\nthis area as\n\nand a National Film Industry and TV Insutute and probably still is, \"the only English-speaking country in Africa, apparently, that has full film-making facilities, including studios, equipment, trained crews and full (...) lab facilities, sound studios and Corporation\n\n(G.F.LC.)\n\n(N.A.F.T.I.) but\n\nwas\n\nalso,\n\nSam Aryete, head of the Ghana Film Industry Corporation, was quoted as saying not too long ago that \"we have in Ghana the best cinematographic infrastructure in tropical Africa.\"^ air-conditioned negative cutting-rooms.\"^\n\nThe only\n\nother\n\ncounuy\n\nin\n\nproximity or even superiority\n\nthe to\n\nregion\n\nGhana\n\nthat in\n\ncan\n\nnow\n\nterms of these\n\nlegitimately\n\nclaim\n\nfacilities is\n\nUpper\n\nVolta, where private entreprcncurship and transnational co-operation are combining to set up what is fast becoming the film production capital of West Africa.\"* And this in addition to being the site for the biennial Festival\n\nMbye-Baboucar Cham 15\n\nPanafricain du Cinema de Ouagadougou (F.E.S.P.A.C.O.),\n\nfirst\n\nheld in 1969\n\nwith the participation of six film-makers from Senegal, Mali, the Ivory\n\nCoast and Niger.\n\nTo what extent the underdeveloped state of the industry in \"Anglophone\" West Africa can be attributed to political unrest is open to discussion, but it should be pointed out that the vogue of military coups and counter-coups originated in the \"Francophone\" regions. The question of imbalance aside, if recent signals from Nigeria and Ghana are any indication of what may come in the future (witness the Lagos Symposium which put forth a series of ameliorative recommendations, the renewed activity of Ghana's N.A.F.T.I., the planned Festival and Seminar in Ghana, the first in the \"Anglophone\" region, and the increasing representation of Nigerian and Ghanaian productions in festivals) then there is cause for cautious optimism in the future of the\n\nseventh art in both regions in the face of ever-increasing\n\nand political odds.^ The ensemble of productions dating from 1979 seenis to confirm this optimism. Although few of our films have made continental or international headlines since the premiere of Sembene Ousmane's Ceddo in\n\nfinancial, technical\n\n1977,\n\ntiie\n\ndrive towards artistic innovation, perfection and socio-political\n\nrelevancy continues to be one of the fundamental guiding principleKof\n\nemerging as well as the already -established cineastes. Ther6 new aesthetic ground for the exploration of new as well as persistent ethical, social and poUtical themes arising out of issues confronting contemporary society that is grappling with the problems and challenges of development. The effort made in Ceddo to deglorify and question certain aspects of the past, in order to confront it with the present and projections into the future, remains a constant in the most accomplished of\n\ncreativity for the\n\nhas been an attempt to clear\n\nsome of\n\nthe\n\nmost recent productions.\n\nIn addition to the increase in original scripts, there has also been a\n\nmarked tendency towards adaptation and\n\ncollaboration. Here,\n\nit is\n\nparticularly\n\ngratifying to note the choice of African literary texts as basis for adaptation,\n\nand the writer. This is Ola Balogun's Cry Freedom (1981) which is adapted from Carcase for the Hounds,^ a novel by the young Kenyan writer Meji Mwangi. Also worth noting are Balogun's Aiye (1980), adapted from a play by Herbert Ogunde, Daniel Kamwa's Notre Fille (1980), based on\n\nand also the collaborative illustrated\n\nby\n\neffort of the cineaste\n\nthe Nigerian\n\nGuillaume Oyono-Mbia's Trois Pretendants, un Mari^ and a work (still in by Mahama Johnson-Traore, based on the novel Le Revenant^ by\n\nprogress) the\n\nSenegalese\n\nfemale\n\nwriter,\n\nperhaps best exemplified by\n\nAminata Sow-Fall. This collaboration\n\nEn Residence\n\nSurveillee(l9Sl), the\n\nfirst\n\nis\n\nlong\n\ncinema and the foremost authority on Vieyra. Closely working with him was Abdou Anta Ka, the Senegalese playwright-poet and former cultural feature of the father of Senegalese\n\nAfrican film criticism, Paulin\n\nSoumanou\n\n16 Film Production\n\nin\n\nWest Africa\n\nadvisor to the then President Senghor.\n\nAlthough such developments are indicative of future possibilities,\n\nsome\n\nin\n\nthemselves encouraging and\n\nrecent works (particularly those of\n\n\"Anglophone\" directors) have tended to be crassly commercial, sometimes unbalanced and sadly imitative of non- African models of questionable quality and appropriateness. This is the case of Eddie Ugboma's The Mask, in particular.\n\nNotwithstanding\n\nconceptual,\n\ncertain\n\nideological\n\nand\n\ntechnical\n\nshortcomings, most of the recent works can be appreciated at least for their critical reflections\n\non the material and moral traumas commitment to social,\n\nrespective societies, and their\n\nthat presently grip their political\n\nand economic\n\ntransformations geared towards uplifting the material and moral stature of the individual\n\nand the society as a whole.\n\nThe New Ghanaian Cinema? Prior to the 1980 premiere of\n\nKwah\n\nAnsah's Love Brewed in the\n\nAfrican Pot (hereinafter referred to as Love Brewed...), feature film production\n\nby Ghanaians (excluding the catastrophic 1976 co-production with Italy, Contact) had been experiencing a long dry spell. The most productive phase was between 1968 and 1972. In addition to a variety of shorts and documentaries, this period saw the appearance of four features by four different directors:\n\nNo\n\nTears for Anansi (1968) by\n\nSam\n\nAryete, / Told You So\n\n(1970) by Egbert Adjesu, Doing Their Thing (1971) by Bernard Odjidja and\n\nThey Call That Love (1972) made\n\nin\n\nGermany by King Ampaw under\n\nthe\n\nauspices of the Hochschule fUr Film und Fernsehen of Munich.^ Generally\n\nconsidered significant in terms of \"Anglophone\" film history, these have attracted litde attention outside\n\nGhana although Love Brewed... may have\n\nalready begun to alter this perception.\n\nProduced, written and directed by Ansah with a predominantly Ghanaian crew and cast. Love Brewed... has already had premieres in Africa, Europe, Asia and the United States and critical as well as popular response has been quite favorable. ^^ It has already received two major film awards: the\n\nPeacock Award\n\nJury's Special\n\nNew\n\nat the\n\nDelhi in 1981, where\n\nEighth International Film Festival of\n\nwas\n\ncited for \"a genuine and talented attempt to find a national and cultural identity,\" and the second award coming\n\nIndia in\n\nat the 7lh\n\nGanda for\n\n\"a\n\nFESPACO\n\nPrize (so\n\nin\n\nnamed\n\nit\n\nFebruary -March 1981\n\nin\n\nin the\n\nhonor and memory of the\n\nform of the Oumarou from Niger)\n\nlate cineaste\n\nmost remarkable direction and production\n\nin\n\nhne with African\n\nrealities.\"\n\ndeparture\n\nproductions.\n\nIt\n\nmay\n\nalso have heralded a new era in as far as it marks a from the usual financing paths trodden by previous was the first Ghanaian feature to be produced in the private\n\nThis film radical\n\nMbye-Baboucar Cham\n\nsector with private financing, even though the director,\n\nhimself of the\n\nfacilities\n\nCorporation, of which he\n\nKwah\n\nAnsah, availed\n\nof the semi-governmental Ghana Film Industry is\n\na member.\n\nSet in colonial Accra in the earlier 1950s, Love Brewed... story of Joe\n\nQuansah, a young,\n\nfisherman, and\n\n1\n\nAbba Appiah,\n\nilliterate\n\ntells\n\nthe\n\nauto-mechanic from a family of\n\na recent graduate of a vocational school in\n\nCape\n\nCoast from a \"modem\", middle class, relatively well-off family, but whose members are also descendants of fishermen. Joe and Abba meet, fall in love, prevail over the prejudices\n\nand reservations of\n\ntheir respective parents, get\n\nmarried and set up a household to plan for the future. The bond between them is strong enough to withstand the onslaught of sustained parental pressure,\n\nand mockery, but when a well-connected wealthy lawyer (rejected by Abba), Mr. Bensah, decides to step up his pursuit of Abba, whose father intrigue\n\nwould\n\nrather have\n\nhim\n\nas a son-in-law, suspicion sets in Joe's mind, quickly\n\ngets into a sense of betrayal\n\neventually repudiates Abba, is\n\nnot sure\n\nif\n\nand the relationship begins to founder. Joe is in the early stages of pregnancy (but Joe\n\nwho\n\nhe or his \"rival\"\n\nis\n\nresponsible), disappears temporarily only to\n\nupon his return, of the catastrophic consequences of his baseless jealousy and impulse. Abba miscarries, becomes a victim of rape at the hands of an accountant, goes mad and is eventually committed to a mental asylum. Within the framework of this quadrangle, Kwah Ansah explores the myriad implications of a colonially-inspired social malaise, the residual repercussions of which are still felt with equal vigor in present-day Ghana. Under close critical scrutiny are issues as varied as class and generational conflicts, alienation, social inequity, elitism, traditional and modem medical methods and effectiveness, jealousy, love, lust and traditional beliefs. With a sharpness unprecedented in previous Ghanaian films. Love Brewed... satirizes the pretentious and philistine attitudes of the colonized elite whose perverted sense of the modem renders them contemptuous of all things Ghanaian at the same time that it transforms them, ironically, into cultural untouchables and learn,\n\nfreaks in the eyes of the unalienated majority.\n\nSuch is the case with Abba's father, Kofi Appiah, a male chauvinist businessman of fisherman ancestry who cannot, for the hfe of him, understand how an individual, such as Joe's father, Atta Quansah, can remain a fisherman all his life and chng to what, in Kofi's eyes, amounts to the ways of \"primitives\" and \"riff-raffs.\" His opposition to Abba's marriage is predicated on this distorted notion of progress and success. He sees his daughter's move as a clear case of class sin and debasement, for how can any graduate of a posh Cape Coast school in her right mind prefer a lower class fellow like Joe to the lawyer, Mr. Bensah, son of the District Chief Clerk? Even more baffling to Kofi is Abba's decision to have Akua, a traditional wedding ceremony, as opposed to a modem church wedding a la europeenne. But ephemeral relief and joy come to Kofi when, in a beautifully done\n\n18 Film Production\n\nin\n\nWest Africa\n\nKwah Ansah intercuts Kofi's dream of the ideal wedding (Abba, Mr. Bcnsah, relatives and guests in snow-white flowing robes and immaculate tuxedos, church bells and organ serenading Abba's march down the aisle on\n\nsequence,\n\nthe\n\narm of her\n\nfather, a Christian priest\n\nand\n\nchoir, a motorcade, a majestic\n\ncake with white icing, champagne...) with the acmal wedding (Joe, Abba and guests in modest traditional outfits, Ghanaian musical instruments, songs and dances, a traditional priest, akpeteshie...) which Kofi deliberately refuses to attend.\n\nJoe's father's initial reluctance to support his son's decision has\n\nits\n\nroots less in class allegiance and contempt than in his fear of the fickle wrath\n\nof the his\n\nwounded powerful of the\n\nlikes of\n\nKofi Appiah.\n\nson of the dangers of \"playing with\n\nright.\n\nfire\".\n\nHe\n\nappropriately warns\n\nSubsequent events prove him\n\nResentment, rejection and humiliation from Abba's father combined\n\nwith the relentless advances and destabilizing pranks of Mr. Bensah spark and\n\nwhich ultimately bums out Joe and Abba.\n\nfuel the fire\n\ndreams are\n\nJoe's\n\nshredded to pieces and he comes close to losing his mental sanity as does\n\nAbba, but their combined misfortune ironically becomes the catalyst that sets motion a process which will bring their feuding families closer together and, more importantly, start the cleansing of Kofi Appiah of his cultural in\n\ninsanity.\n\nHe destroy\n\nmy\n\nrejects\n\nMr. Bensah's bottle of Schnapps and vows,\n\ndaughter for his wealth, not for\n\nall\n\n\"I will not\n\nthe wealth in this world.\"\n\nAfter initially invoking the help of Jesus Christ with a series of \"Hail\n\nMarys\", he ends up by taking an active, if not primary, role in the attempt to Abba with traditional heahng methods. Not only is he present at the\n\ncure\n\nhealing site but, in fact, fowl. This\n\nis\n\nbecomes\n\nthe interpreter and helps kill the sacrificial\n\nsignificant in the light of his earlier refusal to\n\nbe associated\n\nmentally, let alone physically, with anything traditional (witness his refusal to attend the\n\nrevulsion\n\noutdooring of his nephew's child and Abba's wedding, and his\n\nagainst\n\nakpeteshie,\n\namong\n\nother\n\nexamples).\n\nThis\n\nbecomes an\n\nmanhood Abdou Kader Beye in\n\nattempt not only to heal Abba, but also to bring back the cultural\n\nof Kofi Appiah\n\nin\n\na\n\nway\n\nnot unlike that of El-Hadj\n\nSembcne Ousmanc's Xala. Thus, sacrificial objects.\n\nin a\n\nway, Abba and Joe can be seen as\n\nTheir happiness and sanity are sacrificed (although not by\n\nharmony and understanding among people of all and for the cultural sanity of the alienated elite, in particular.

There are, however, a few artistic and technical flaws which affect this film in terms of composition, progression and impact. The plot is overloaded with incidents which all too this sense,\n\ntheir craft for social\n\noften\n\nseem conu-ived\n\neither to\n\ndenounce\n\nexplicitly aspects of\n\nGhanaian\n\nsocial\n\nMbye-Baboucar Cham 19\n\nlife\n\nwhich the\n\ndeems negative on screen aspects of\n\ndirector\n\nto the collective well-being, or to\n\ntraditional behefs and practices sometimes presented as antidotes to the crippling influences of a foreign mentality. An example of the former is the incident where a character (simply referred to as \"an accountant\") surfaces from nowhere in a black Mercedes Benz to \"rescue\" Abba from Bensah, when actually she was doing a fine job fending off the harassment with a barrage of tomatoes from her shopping bag. Abba succumbs too easily to the offers of the accountant, who then drives her to his house, entertains her on the piano (cultural aUenation?), gets her drunk and finally rapes her. While his demarche may be typical of a segment of the\n\nsimply\n\ndisplay\n\nprofessional eUte in colonial (and\n\nwith which he\n\nis\n\nfoisted\n\nunderstanding of his role\n\nmaybe contemporary) Accra,\n\nthe alacrity\n\non and off the screen contributes Uttle to our in the real dynamics of the emotional and mental\n\ndecline of Abba.\n\nThe\n\nsignificance of the surreal sequences featuring the equally\n\nWanderer\" also is not quite clear, for Kwah Ansah more than merely display chunks of exotica which seem to\n\nsurreaUstic \"Heart-broken\n\nseems\n\nto\n\ndo\n\nUttle\n\nsay \"yes, Ghanaians\n\nstill\n\nbeheve\n\nin the supernatural.\"\n\nThe choice of EngUsh, as opposed to an Akan language, ^^ may have contributed to some of the flaws in the dialogue, which tends at times to be trite\n\nor plain unconvincing, especially during the period of Joe's courtship of\n\nAbba. The sound effects of the film remind one too much of those encountered in popular U.S. television \"soap operas\" and other series such as Get Smart and The Fugitive. Perhaps that another reviewer classified la\n\nit\n\nis\n\npartly\n\nLove Brewed... as\n\non account of such traits melodrame realise a\n\n\"...un\n\nmaniere hollywoodienne....\"^^\n\nIn spite of such technical shortcomings, Ansah's first feamre remains a positive development in Ghanaian film-making. It is a pioneer in to the knowledge of this author, the first African feature to utilize a wide screen with a 1.85 to 1 ratio, as opposed to the standard 35mm, 1.33 to 1 ratio used by the majority of African directors. Ansah handles this very difficult screen dimension relatively well, and the visuals are also very well done. Hopefully, Love Brewed... will mark a turning-point in Ghanaian film-making in particular and \"Anglophone\" fihn-making in general.\n\nthat\n\nit is,\n\n35mm\n\nNigerian Film:\n\nA\n\nSleeping Giant?\n\nMost observers of\n\nfilm production in Nigeria consistently deplore\n\nthe disturbingly sad state of this very powerful\n\ntwo years, taken a giant leap backwards\n\ncountry.

In other words, the industry has so far yielded only mediocre productions, so that the highly touted potential of film (wimess Soyinka's remarks to a Lagos audience) ^\"^ remain largely untapped. Hence, the disappointment for such critics as Osundare who, in a review of Ola Balogun's Aiye, concludes that \"the Nigerian film has yet to catch up with the dynamics of Nigerian life and establish its relevance to the Nigerian condition.\"!^ Osundare is equally disturbed by another new film, The Mask by Eddie Ugboma, and concludes that\n\nquestions\n\n...the\n\nNigerian film\n\namateurishness....\n\nA\n\nis still in\n\na disturbing stage of\n\ndisquieting lack of originality besets\n\nthe Nigerian film, a virus transferred directly from the\n\ncountry's foreign -dominated socio-economic system. Just as\n\nwe have worked\n\nourselves into believing that Nigeria's\n\nand economic development is not possible without an infantile reliance on Europe and America, our social, political,\n\nfilm practitioners cannot think of a marketable film that is\n\nnot stuffed with vulgar cliches and tired motifs from\n\nforeign movies. ^^\n\nLack of\n\noriginality,\n\nimitation,\n\ncommercialism and pandering to and sensibilities of an audience\n\n(instead of critically confronting) the tastes still\n\nnumbed by a daily dose of the cheapest and worst types of escapist from the West and the East - such is the predicament that continues to\n\nrejects\n\nplague the Nigerian feature film. In spite of the mushrooming of indigenous\n\ncompanies such as Cal penny-Nigeria Films Ltd. (Francis Oladele), Afro-Cult Films (Ola Balogun), and Fed Films, Nigerian productions still remain changed from Son of Africa (1971) (nicknamed in which the lead actor dubbed Agent 009 \"...wore a Hollywoodian garment without its paraphernalia,\" 1 8, to Sanya Dosunmu's Dinner with the Demi (1976), touted as \"remarkable for being the first mediocre.\n\nLittle\n\nhas\n\n\"Daughters of Lebanon \"),17\n\nNigerian film that attempts to translate to-day Nigerian\n\nlife,\n\ncommon\n\nincidents recognizable in day-\n\nstylized along the lines of the popular psychological\n\ndramas of popular Western cinema,\"^^\n\nto\n\nBalogun's Ajani\n\nOgun\n\n(1976),\n\nheavily saturated with Indian romance motifs and techniques borrowed from the\n\nFrench cinema^o\n\nto\n\nUgboma's The Mask (1980), described\n\nbastardized version of Ian Fleming. ..and...a failed copy of James featuring a Nigerian 007.\n\nas\n\n\"...a\n\nBond\"\n\nMbye-Baboucar Cham 21\n\nThe Mask premiered\n\nin\n\nLondon\n\nin July 1980.^^ It is a story\n\nabout\n\nrepossessing part of the cultural heritage of Africa trickily stolen from her by colonialist art scavengers, ignorant or\n\ncontemptuous of the significance of\n\nowners. The heritage, in\n\na mask of Queen by an unscrupulous British colonial officer. This mask, which eventually ended up in the British Museum, became the object of British-Nigerian tension as the latter demanded its return for the 1977 FESTAC in Lagos while the British expressed reluctance to do so.

However, one still notices his much maligned propensity to simplify in order to feed a somewhat misguided popular taste for the sake of commercial success. But he is not an Ugboma.

The plot revolves around a book entided Le Livre, written by an African academic, which is saturated with truths and common sense knowledge about the historicity and utility of democratic and other egalitarian principles in traditional African societies. This body of knowledge and truths, if acknowledged and adopted as part of the political system, will undoubtedly defeat and reduce to redundancy the role of the President's white foreign adviser, whose job it is to dish out advice and formulate policies calculated to maintain the current system, pegged to that of the former colonial power. In no time at all, the battle lines are drawn between those in favor of the ideas contained in Le Livre and those opposed to them. Confusion follows, the as an\n\nand his and Le Livre is burnt.

Part of the genesis of the idea for this film may be found in a piece of legislation passed not too long ago by the Senegalese governments 5 requiring each couple, prior to marriage, to sign and agree to a legally-binding document defining the present and future nature of their marriage ~ whether it is going to be monogamous or polygamous on the part of the man.

There\n\nsynchronization (a system a\n\nlittle\n\nlike the Italians',\n\nwho\n\npost-synchronize\n\nThe absence of technical preparation did not harm the film all that much on the dramatic level. The scenes were done in chronological order, which helped put at her ease the leading actress, Therese Mbissine Diop, by profession a dress-maker, and here playing her first film role. The director could also follow his film's progress and enrich it with other shots and scenes as the occasion arose. By contrast, the cameraperson was constandy confronted with the problems of linking up filmic light and space, since he was continuously having to move from one set to another, and then back to the first, in order to follow the unfolding of the story.

This meant the French cameraperson had to have his professional Chief Cameraman card (which was not the case) and that the technical crew had to be approved.

This was not the case for Black Girl either, where Therese Diop was dubbed by the Haitian actress Toto Bissainthe. The two main European actors, Robert Fontaine and Anne-Marie JeUnek, were able to dub themselves, being in France at the time. Black Girl, taken from a novel by Sembene Ousmane, is based on an actual story which came out in a southern French newspaper about the suicide of a young Black woman. Sembene subsequently made of it a film\n\ntened by five minutes. (The long,\n\nprize.)

But the film recounted a typical case of attitudes emanating from the will to power, bom of the assumptions of personal racial superiority. In Dakar, the maid Diouana was only concerned with the children. Once in France, she became the all-purpose maid, rather in the style of a slave over whom one might have the right of life and death. In the end, this is what transpired. For how else could it be explained that the mistress could refuse her maid permission to have rest days, when labor laws made provision for them?

The family refuses any contact with the\n\nman\n\nthey consider responsible for their child's death. In leaving, almost\n\nman is pursued by her young brother with a mask over his face, same mask he had sold to his sister and which she had given to her mistress. With the stem countenances of several other children following him, the mask becomes the symbol of Africa, conveying the message of an fleeing, the\n\nexactly the\n\ninsurgent Africa, crying for vengeance.\n\nStopping the child\n\nat the bottom of a seems to be saying that justice will be done one day, emerging out of the normal course of events. The film's attraction is that it can be read at several levels: that of the story, which in itself is already thought-provoking, and then that of the symbolism of the images. The richness of their possible interpretation leads us to deeper analyses of the social situations and politico-economic relations of African and European societies. Black Girl is a film which introduced an\n\nfootbridge, the\n\nmask away from\n\nhis face, the director\n\ninteresting director.\n\nMandabi (The Money Order) In 1968, Sembene brought out Mandabi, his first film entirely in The screenplay was taken from his own novel of ths same name,^ and was funded by an advance against receipts of 15 million CFA francs.'* At that period, when cooperation agreements had not yet been revised, the Senegalese color.\n\nwere admitted as privileged foreigners, being from a former French colony. The mechanism of the advance against receipts consisted, for the receiving party, in taking a French co-producer to whom the French National Film Center allocated the entire advance. For Mandabi, this co-producer was the French Film Fund. But what a series of sagas this co-production ran into! A long-drawn-out court case ensued, simply because the French Film Fund, fortified by its knowledge of the details of French legislation, wished to profit a Uttle from what it thought to be the naivete of Film Doomireew, the Senegalese co-production company. This type of advance against receipts which the Center generally disburses for difficult subjects or to young directors, comes from monies pre-levied on receipts by way of a percentage on each ticket sold. If the film makes money, the Center recovers this advance. In the opposite instance, the loan is written off under profit and loss. ForMandabi, a part of the 15 million, about 5 million, was sent to Doomireew Productions to pay for operations and wages in Senegal. The French co-producer handled the wages of three French technicians (the chief cameraperson, the sound engineer and the chief electrician), together with the laboratory, editing\n\nand sound-track\n\ncosts.\n\n34 Five Major Films of Sembene Ousmane\n\nMandabi was\n\nshot in two color versions in just six weeks.\n\nThe\n\nand then did the same scene over in French. The shorter French version lasts 90 minutes, the Wolof version 105 minutes. It was an achievement which astonished the French technicians just actors spoke their parts in\n\nas\n\nmuch\n\non\n\ntheir first film.\n\nas\n\nWolof\n\nfirst\n\nmost of the members of the Senegalese technical crew working\n\nIt is true that the film had been well-prepared. The actors knew their Wolof, the country's main language, and in French (it was a requirement that the same actors could speak both languages perfectly). Moreover, the scenes, while complex, were very manageable since almost everything es-\n\nlines in\n\nwas in the same location. Mandabi can be understood as the drama of cultural and economic underdevelopment. The unemployed situation of the father, with two wives, is sential\n\nHe\n\ncertainly the result of a lack of education.\n\nFrench, nor in his mother-tongue.\n\ncan neither read nor write\n\nNot having an\n\ncash the money-order sent him by his nephew, a streetsweeper in Paris. his misfortune begins\n\nfrom\n\nin\n\nidentity-card,^ he cannot\n\nThe 25,000 nephew's mother, some\n\nthat point on.\n\nCFA\n\nAll\n\nfrancs have to\n\nto his uncle, and the be cashed, to give some to the rest to be kept for him to await his return.

He could have been told all this. But it was an opportunity for the director to attack the lack of professional decency of State officials, active as\n\nown affairs, salaries, increases, costs of living. man can thus curse the entire earth for people's dishonesty.

As regards the spiritual power of the marabouts, Sembene makes a point of saying there are good and bad marabouts; and that the good ones are not necessarily the most expensive.

The story of Emitai takes place then in a Diola village, next to Guinea-Bissau.^ The same tribe Uves in and the west of Guinea-Bissau. While the film was being shot, some extras came from GuineaBissau, and the fighters and the resistance people of the time helped us a lot.

But when they themselves fall, they borrow the vocabulary of revolution. It is very symbolic and very true at the same time.

Xala was shown at the Bombay festival last January and the Indians told me that the film's content applies to Indian society.

But the UGC, very gluttonous despite this\n\nUGC\n\n20%, wanted\n\nto\n\nswallow up everything and absorb cinema\n\nentirely. It\n\nthese grounds that the film-makers alerted the public authorities, total\n\nstop to theater sales to the\n\nUGC.\n\nThis\n\nis\n\nwas on\n\nwho\n\nput a\n\nthe current phase of\\pur\n\nnegotiations.\n\nWe\n\nare aware of the fact that Xala constitutes a kind of guarantee,^\n\nthat. It will be a test to see how the UGC will operate. A test of collaboration, I won't say of a frank and honest kind, but in our mu-\n\nbut\n\nwe\n\ncannot reject\n\ntual interest. Nonetheless, all\n\nwe know\n\nthe solution for our\n\ncinema\n\nwill\n\nbe for\n\nthe theaters to be taken over, and the African states will get to that point\n\none day. We will do like Algeria, and we will control production, distribution and management, in short all cinema from A to Z.^o Up to now, and even though it has only 20% of the capital, the UGC imposes its own programming. Now we want to decide by ourselves what films to distribute in our country.

But there is, undoubtedly, an undeniable problem: polygamy, against which we struggle. There is a problem, but the problem is clear because the woman's inferior status is visible. We do not, however, find any solution in the Westem concept of the family, for that model only produces a deterioration in human beings.
