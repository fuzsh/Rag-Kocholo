        "text": "I’m just about a year younger than Crispin Glover, and we’ll get to him, because his own birthday just passed, and I am an enormous fan of his. But prior to that we must contend with the prior generation. For, as Crispin only began showing up in the mid ’80s, it can’t accurately be said that I grew up with him. I did however grow up watching the screen performances of his father, character actor Bruce Glover (b. 1933).\n\nIf not for Crispin’s success I’m not certain I would have known Bruce’s name, but I most certainly knew that visage. His was an extremely familiar face on movie and TV screens throughout the 1970s especially. He has the same intense pale blue eyes as his son, but the body of a former football player (which he indeed was) so he was usually cast as bikers, henchmen, and thugs. In terms of screen time and popularity, his best known role was probably that of Mr. Wint (paired with Mr. Kidd) in the James Bond movie Diamonds Are Forever (1971), although his most prestigious film, one in which he has a smaller role, is Chinatown (1974). He played the part of “Deputy Grady” in the Walking Tall films (1973-77), and can also be seen in The Thomas Crowne Affair (1968), The Over-the-Hill Gang (1969), C.C. and Company (1970), Bless the Beasts and Children (1971), Black Gunn (1972), One Little Indian (1973), and Hard Times (1975), Walter Hill’s first film. I also recall from a memorable Adam-12 episode where he played a terrorizing leader of a biker gang named Bach (which he mispronounces as “Batch”, and from The Six Million Dollar Man, wherein he portrayed a Soviet military officer.\n\nBy his own testimony, Glover was modeling at the Art Institute of Chicago when he was tapped by one of the female models to play a gorilla in her burlesque act. A magician in the stage show they performed in waved his wand and joked “Now you’re an actor!” He has three truly excellent Broadway credits: the original productions of Night of the Iguana (1961) and The Lion in Winter (1966) as well as the Broadway debut of Mother Courage and Her Children (1963). Early films include Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster (1965) and Who Killed Teddy Bear? (1965), but mostly he did lots and lots of television: Car 54 Where Are You?, Perry Mason, My Favorite Martian, The Big Valley, Bonanza, Mod Squad, The Streets of San Francisco, Kojak, BJ and the Bear and such like.\n\nAs Crispin’s career began to take off in the ’80s, Bruce’s began to cool off. He continued to make TV guest appearances, though less frequently, and the films became less prestigious. He never stopped working however. In the ’90s his refuge seemed to be horror and camp horror, things like Shakespeare’s Plan 12 from Outer Space (1991), Warlock: The Armageddon (1993), Night of the Scarecrow (1995) and Die Hard Dracula (1998). He has a wonderful stunt turn in indie favorite Ghost World (2001) as a guy in a wheelchair. He’s also in Crispin’s films Simon Says (2006) and It Is Fine! Everything is Fine (2007). At this writing, he is still appearing in films. His last released one was in 2021, and there are others in production, notably one directed by Crispin.\n\nBruce Glover has also taught acting for decades, and it must be said that his prize pupil and greatest creation is his only child. I’m not sure that it’s possible to have create a body of work of which I approve of more than Crispin Glover’s. There is no one to compare him to. As an actor he chooses only the most sinister or eccentric roles, sometimes in the most sinister or eccentric vehicles, and he’s also an avant-garde author, artist, musician, and film-maker. It’s widely whispered that he’s mentally ill, but one can’t help noting that that’s just what those participating in a dead, moribund, ossified, conventional industry and society WOULD say. I don’t know what he’s like to spend time, with, but from where I sit I’m just seeing somebody who’s walking the walk in terms of living a set of aesthetic principals. He is NEVER boring. He is ALWAYS himself. And in a business and a world full of empty mannequins, that can be totally threatening. I’ll always mourn that we don’t have Andy Kaufman around to shake things up anymore. But thank god we still have Crispin Glover.\n\nCrispin’s mother Betty Krachey (1928-2016) was a dancer. The Glovers named their only child after the St. Crispin’s Day speech in Henry V, which means that ultimately, if indirectly, it’s after St. Crispin, Patron Saint of Cobblers. His middle name (for real) is “Hellion”, a name he has clearly always sought to live up to. (This choice of name arises from the fact that it was the joking middle name Bruce always gave for himself when people asked about the “H”, which actually stands for Herbert). His first major credit was a pilot for an ABC variety show for teenagers called The Best of Times (1981), which also featured Nicholas Cage (then Coppola) in his first real gig. Jackie Mason was also in the cast, but it wasn’t picked up. His first films were fairly conventional things: My Tutor (1984), Teachers (1984), Racing with the Moon (1984) and Friday 13: The Final Chapter.\n\nGlover’s ascent was rapid. He stood out, with his strange awkwardness, whiny voice, and creepy smile. Robert Zemeckis put him on the map when he cast him as Michael J. Fox’s father in Back to the Future (1985), a justifiable choice, since most of the film takes place in a flashback when the character was a teenager. A GREAT Hollywood story attaches to the fact that Glover is not in the film’s two sequels. Apparently the producers wouldn’t match his terms for reprising his role as George McFly, so he balked. Not to be thwarted, they recast the part with character actor and impressionist Jeffrey Weissman, wearing prosthetics, shot from lots of angles that don’t emphasize the face. (This is a technique called “Dead Shemping”, because it was pioneered by Jules White in Three Stooges films after Shemp Howard died. It has double resonance when applied to Glover, because he actually used to wear a Shemp style haircut, a signified calculated to endear him in the eyes of his fans). Glover successfully sued the producers over the use of his image. (Meanwhile, I’ve had the honor of meeting Weissman, a major classic comedy proponent, and have gotten to converse with him at length about our mutual enthusiasms). This btw, is a dispute which has no moral component that I can see. It’s strictly about competing interests, so I can absolutely justify both sides. If I were the producer? I’d absolutely have tried that, faking the presence of a troublesome actor. And if I were that actor? Hell, yeah, I’d sue over the use of my face!\n\nIn 1986 Glover was extremely well cast in the dark dramatic film River’s Edge, about a group of soulless, amoral teenagers and their ambivalence about a murder. To promote the film, he went on Late Night with David Letterman and delighted and/or confused many, including the host, by taking the stage in platform heels, striped bell-bottoms, and a long-haired wig. It came to a climax when Glover did some martial arts moves and nearly kicked Letterman in the head, prompting the comedian to stand-up and run away from his desk. This always read to me as an Andy Kaufman style stunt, although some speculated that Glover was crazy, or on drugs or a combination of those things. Wy can’t it be all three? It seemed to me that Letterman was a baby about it all, for, if I may speak frankly, this is the kind of shit I live for. Most of these shows are like monotonous conveyor belts bringing you products off of the assembly line. For once, some guy comes on with a little spontaneity and everyone’s like “Hey, whoa! Don’t blow up our pretty machine!” But that’s why they call it controversy. This moment, perhaps more than all others, cemented Glover’s strange show business legend.\n\nSurely, you people know PERFORMANCE ART when you see it? Actually, there’s no “surely” about it. Most people don’t. I think it is no coincidence that at this point, Glover begins to diversify his artistic projects. In 1988 he created a book called Rat Catching, a sort of collage-like, surreal cut and past of a pre-existing work Studies in the Art of Rat Catching (1896) by Henry C. Barkley. In 1989, he released an album called The Big Problem Does Not Equal the Solution, The Solution Equals Let It Be, featuring readings from his books, covers of “These Boots Are Made for Walking”, “The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze” and the Charles Manson tune “Never Say ‘Never’ to Always”, as well as the original song “Clowny Clowny CLown”. Look it up on Youtube and you will be richly rewarded. That same year, he had a great role in the mainstream disaster film Twister, just to keep a hand in.\n\nAfter this, it’s like a bottle is uncorked, and what follows is like the best movie career in the whole history of mankind. I want to list almost every single role and film he appeared in, and I think I will. It includes David Lynch’s Wild at Heart (1990), the part of Andy Warhol in The Doors (1991), Rubin and Ed (1991, a buddy film with Howard Hesseman), Gus Van Sant’s Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1993), What’s Eating Gilbert Grape? (1993), Jim Jarmusch’s Dead Man (1995), Milos Forman’s The People Vs. Larry Flint (1996), Neil LaBute’s Nurse Betty (2000), the part of the villainous “Thin Man” in Charlie’s Angels (2000) and its 2003 sequel, the title role in the 2001 screen adaptation of Herman Melville’s Bartleby, followed by Raskolnikov in a 2002 Crime and Punishment, followed by the title role in the 2002 remake of Willard, for which he also recorded a remake of the song “Ben” , thus truly establishing for the record some sort of major obsession with rats.\n\nIn 2005 he directed his first film What Is It? (title apparently inspired by Zip the Pinhead), which featured an all Down’s Syndrome cast. This was followed by It is Fine! Everything Is Fine (2007) starring a man with cerebral palsy. Other projects included a 2007 remake of Herschell Gordon Lewis’s The Wizard of Gore, the part of Grendel in Beowolf (2007), a role in The Donner Party (2009), and he’s the Knave of Hearts in Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland (2010). Hot Tub Time Machine, released that same year, was (for him) a relatively mainstream picture. He co-starred with his dad in Hiszpanka (2015), a Polish sci-fi picture. I very much enjoyed him the spooky and offbeat We Have Always Lived in the Castle (2018). His most recent credit was in a 2022 episode Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities. And he is purportedly still working on the third part of his screen trilogy (provisionally titled It Is Mine) starring his 90 year old dad.\n\nWhen not in LA or NYC, Glover lives in a castle-like 17th century villa in Bohemia (Czech Republic), as though he were literally living a Dracula movie. Or at the very last, Dwight Frye as Renfield. Undead? Perhaps. Oh and how I would love to see Crispin Glover star in a punk version of Hamlet, with Bruce as the Ghost. Crispin’s birthday was April 20, btw."
