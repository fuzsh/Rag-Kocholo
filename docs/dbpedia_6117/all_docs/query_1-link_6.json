        "text": "If young Glover were looking to shrug the mantle of Hellion, however, he might’ve chosen a different tack for his Late Night with David Letterman debut. On the evening of July 28, 1987, instead of promoting the release of his then-latest film, River’s Edge—which marked Glover’s first top-billing in a theatrical release—he stumbled onstage in ’70s-style platform heels, tight flares, and a long, higgledy-piggledy wig, setting in motion what Legs McNeil wrote up in Spin as “the best bit of television since Jack Ruby shot Lee Harvey Oswald.”\n\nOnce seated, a thoroughly spooked Glover waxed garbled about his discomfort with the side effects of his burgeoning movie stardom—“The press, they can do things, they can twist things around”—before challenging his host to an arm wrestle. “People try to make me sound like I’m a lot… weird, and I’m just, I’m strong!” he sputtered, flexing his bicep. With Letterman all but tapped out, Glover ventured an upping of the ante: “I can kick!” he insisted, launching a very high kick indeed in Letterman’s direction. Under cover of a commercial break, Glover was summarily booted from the show—the only guest to have ever picked up that particular badge of honor. Back in control, a ruffled Letterman defended the expulsion: “You wanna have dinner with the guy?”\n\nThis Kaufman-esque gambit, which (unlike Joaquin Phoenix’s half-baked rapper schtick) was executed without the foreknowledge of anyone at Late Night, stoked giddy speculation in living rooms and gossip rags across the United States—that McFly kid is unhinged! An acid freak! If Glover had clearly been courting infamy, he nevertheless seems to have over-estimated his audience’s capacity to clock a piece of performance art. A few years after the Letterman fracas, he would appear in that same outlandish get-up in Trent Harris’s budget buddy comedy Rubin & Ed (1991), playing one of the titular odd couple—“Rubin” was evidently a character, not a bad trip, but the legend had become fact, been printed: Hellion by name, hellion by nature.\n\nThe name was in fact a hand-me-down from his father. Bruce “Hellion” Glover had adopted it first, when he was just starting out in the biz. A prolific character actor himself, you might recognize the elder Glover as half of the assassin duo from Diamonds Are Forever (1971) or one of Jack Nicholson’s associates in Chinatown (1974), or, depending on your vintage, as a devilish presence in hundreds of other movies, plays, and TV shows. Interviews with him evidence a showman with a prankster streak. For Crispin, on the other hand, acting is no laughing matter. He eschews the spotlight except for promotional duties—you won’t even catch him clowning in the blooper reels that close out Charlie’s Angels and Epic Movie (2007)—­­and he has skewed increasingly earnest in interviews, often induced to repeat some variation of his FAQ claim to sanity: “Many people confuse Crispin the actual person with characters he has played.” He is not, in fact, a born exhibitionist, but—often pinstriped, always polite—a professional one.\n\nAs regards his performance style, however (let alone his physiognomy), Glover seems very much his father’s son. Bruce’s first acting teacher, as he tells it, was a gorilla whose gestures he was studying for his stage debut, in a strip club act. “Think my thoughts and do my moves,” is the instruction Glover Sr. received, without a word passing between man and ape. While big speeches are what tend to scoop up award season statuettes, acting is at its core pantomime—a lesson he no doubt imparted to his offspring.\n\nThe younger Glover does have a way with dialogue—he bends his thin, aniseed voice into (as per critic Jonathan Rosenbaum) “goofy rhythms and stresses”—but he doesn’t need it, indeed, sometimes doesn’t even want it, preferring alternative modes of expression. “I wouldn’t trust no words written down on no piece of paper,” his coal-faced seer advises Johnny Depp in the monologue—one of very few in his filmography—that sets the tone for Jim Jarmusch’s acid Western Dead Man (1995).\n\nIn Bartleby, Jonathan Parker’s adaptation of the Herman Melville story about an uncooperative clerk, Glover has little more than the one, recurring line, “I would prefer not to.” It is his physicality that makes the performance hypnotic: underscored by noodling theremin, he lurches languidly through the fluoro-lit office space, impervious to the bafflement of his colleagues. As Grendel in Beowulf, Glover contrived to ululate exclusively in Old English; as a spacey Andy Warhol in Oliver Stone’s The Doors (1991), he requested a “line reduction.” Most notable is his reinvention of the Creepy Thin Man, saddled in the Charlie’s Angels script with exposition, as mute. (The hair fixation was also his idea.)\n\n“His command of physical gesture is virtually Egyptian,” remarked River’s Edge director Tim Hunter of his lead—a description that calls to mind Antonin Artaud’s praise for Balinese theater actors as “looking like moving hieroglyphs.” In Hunter’s proto-Twin Peaks tale of teen anomie, Glover plays metalhead ring-leader Layne with slowed-down, stoner intonations and the twitchy physicality of a speed freak. Screenwriter Neal Jimenez thought that he wrecked his movie, but it’s a bravura performance, all the more so for the way in which Glover’s neo-Expressionist stylings clash with the hammy naturalism of his co-stars (Keanu Reeves and Ione Skye amongst them), producing eerie new harmonics—it makes for a film that is, like the actor himself, in a key all its own.\n\nCertain directors have managed to work Glover into their films, not seamlessly, but smoothly: Lynch, Harris, Jarmusch… McG. More often, however—River’s Edge being the finest example—Glover is something like insoluble; add him to the mix and you get, rather than a solution, a suspension. The former scenario, generally speaking, has made for better films in the Gesamtkunstwerk sense, but the latter offers its own, more rarefied thrills. If Glover has now more or less walled himself up in his Czech chateau, preferring to labor in the construction of his own cinematic worlds than visit upon those of others, to keep company with his peacocks rather than studio execs, it is nevertheless true that he has seemed to thrive in (aesthetically, professionally) hostile environments; when he’s had something to push against. Of “Crispin the actual person,” though, perhaps all that can be said with unimpeachable accuracy is that he’s a man of whom questions are frequently asked.\n\nKeva York is a New York-born, Melbourne-based writer and critic.
