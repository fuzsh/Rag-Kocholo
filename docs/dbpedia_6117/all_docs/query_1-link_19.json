It's called The I Scream Man and is about a vengeful ice cream vendor who's driven (pun intended) by brutal memories from his twisted past to wreak havoc on a small, seemingly innocent town in Wyoming. And guess what, the ice cream vendor madman has been cast by a real madman - Crispin Glover.\n\nSay what you will about Crispin, but not only are the films he's directed insanely twisted (and never seen by that many people), but most roles he plays are rather twisted, too. The movie is an independent horror feature written by first-timer Mikos Zavros and directed by first-timer J.T. Mollner; let's hope these first-timers can pull it off. Also starring in the film is Tom Sizemore, Judd Nelson and Haylie Duff. I'll definitely keep an eye on this one."
