        "text": "PARK CITY— The characters played by Crispin Glover tend to be a bit eccentric, and they're usually pretty shy and soft-spoken.\n\nSuch as the dad in the first \"Back to the Future\" film or the high-kicking \"thin man\" in the two \"Charlie's Angels\" pictures or \"Epic Movie,\" which opens today and features Glover spoofing Johnny Depp's character from \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\" (Glover also starred in local filmmaker Trent Harris' short \"The Orkly Kid\" and Harris' feature \"Rubin and Ed.\")\n\nIn real life, the 41-year-old actor is soft-spoken as well, though at times he does get surprisingly animated — especially when he's discussing his second directorial effort, \"It is fine! EVERYTHING IS FINE.\"\n\n\"This is exciting. I'm very excited to be here with this movie,\" Glover said during an interview in the Park City Marriott Hotel, adding that this is the film he had to make.\n\n\"It is fine!\" — a psycho-sexual fantasy about the rather vivid imagination of a disabled man — had its premiere Tuesday as part of the Park City at Midnight section. (Two more screenings remain, both of them today.)\n\nThe film is loosely based on the experiences of the late Steven C. Stewart, a Bountiful resident who wrote the screenplay and was the film's lead actor. He died in 2000 from complications related to cerebral palsy, shortly after the film's primary photography was completed.\n\nGlover said he was glad Stewart's scenes were all filmed before his death, as it was essential to have him in the film. \"It is unfortunate, however, that he's not here to see his film debuting at the Sundance Film Festival.\"\n\nGlover credits his longtime friend, Trent Harris, for introducing him to David Brothers — a local photographer and designer whose works have been seen in \"The World's Fastest Indian\" and Harris' own \"Plan 10 From Outer Space,\" as well as Rolling Stone magazine. Brothers, in turn, introduced Glover to Stewart.\n\nBrothers had met Stewart in the mid-1980s and became one of his closest confidants. He also wound up transcribing Stewart's spoken-word \"script,\" which became the basis for the film.\n\n\"It's all Steven's words,\" Brothers said during the same interview. Brothers isn't credited as a screenwriter, but he does get a co-directing credit on the film. \"I'm not entirely sure he would have agreed with some of our depictions of the scenes and characters, but it's definitely all his unique voice.\"\n\nConsequently, there are things in the film that are \"potentially very upsetting,\" according to Glover. \"I'm not really that worried about it, though. I might be, if this was a major studio-financed and -distributed film, but I'm distributing this myself.\"\n\nStill, Glover and Brothers agree that \"It is fine!\" has its share of button-pushing moments and controversial content (due to some frank depictions and discussions of sexuality, the currently unrated film would probably receive an NC-17 rating).\n\n\"Look, am I saying that 13-year-olds should see the film? Absolutely not. This is an adult-oriented film,\" Glover said. \"Of course, that also means there are audiences over 18 who should absolutely not see the film either.\"\n\nGlover said he barely completed postproduction work in time for the festival. \"I haven't even seen it projected yet.\"\n\nOnce he finishes all the edits and postproduction work, Glover wants to tour the art-house circuit with \"It is fine!\" along with its 2005 predecessor, \"What is It?\" which also played at Sundance. He plans to include a slide show and lecture with excerpts from some of his books.\n\nThis has been a particularly high-profile week for Glover. In addition to \"It is fine!\" and \"Epic Movie,\" the festival is hosting Sundance Collection special screenings of the 1986 film \"River's Edge,\" which featured a breakthrough role for Glover.\n\n\"It's important for me to have a Hollywood acting career, because it helps me afford to make my own films,\" said Glover, who adds the middle name \"Hellion\" to his credits for more personal projects. \"That isn't to say that I don't enjoy my other film work, but it's the job that allows me to have some fun.\"\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: \"It is fine! EVERYTHING IS FINE.\"\n\nWhere: Sundance Film Festival 07\n\nWhen: Today, 3 p.m. (Park City); midnight (Salt Lake City)\n\nHow much: $15 ($10 wait-list tickets)\n\nPhone: 435-776-7878\n\nWeb: festival.sundance.org/2007 or www.crispinglover.com"
