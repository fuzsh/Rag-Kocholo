        "text": "Biography: \"Crispin Glover moved to Los Angeles when he was four, and began acting while still in elementary school. His father is actor Bruce Glover and his mother is a former dancer-actress. A talented child actor who had an agent by the age of 13, Glover won a co-starring role in the Los Angeles production of The Sound of Music starring Florence Henderson. After high school, he appeared on television series such as Hill St. Blues, Family Ties and Happy Days. His most recognizable role was as George McFly in Back to the Future.\n\nAside from his film and television career, Crispin Glover had recorded a couple of albums. In 1989, he released 'The Big Problem Does Not Equal The Solution - The Solution Equals Let It Be' which featured a remake of the Nancy Sinatra hit \"These Boots Are Made For Walking\". He has recorded a second album called 'The Big Love Album', which has yet to be released. He also writes his own literature and poems, and distributes them through his own publishing company called 'Volcanic Eruptions'. He has written several books to date, including Rat Catching (1987), Oak Mot (1990), and Concrete Inspection (1992).\" - Crispin Glover Encyclopedia\n\nFilmography\n\nBeowulf (2007)\n\nThe Wizard of Gore (2007)\n\nEpic Movie (2007)\n\nIt Is Fine.
