        "text": "Behind the five windows of the second floor of the house, in the ‘Beletage’, the “dining room with the figures of gods” and the “landscape room” wait for visitors as a part of the permanent exhibition ‘Buddenbrooks – the Novel of a Century’. It is a one-off staged union of reality and poetic fantasy. “One sat in the landscape room on the first floor of the spacious old house… The strong and elastic wall coverings, … delicately coloured, much like the thin carpet which covered the floor; an idyll in 18th Century style with happy winemakers, busy field-workers, nicely beribboned shepherdesses who held clean lambs on their laps or kissed shepherds tenderly.”\n\nIn this exhibition, Thomas Mann’s nobel-prize winning novel ‘Buddenbrooks’ (1901) becomes a piece of literature to be physically experienced. Whoever reads, sees – whoever sees, reads. With the reprint of the first edition of the book in your hand, you can emerge yourself in the setting of Buddenbrooks, in the everyday life of the merchant family from Lübeck.\n\nOn the tables, on the harmonium, on the Lübeck Gazette from 1981, on the sofa; numerous small tags with the page numbers of the text. In this way, reading is brought about – the inner eye reads, but the experience is very tangible – the props become talking furniture, the text becomes the room. At once, numerous storylines and characters of the novel are consolidated in one setting. And standing at the window, looking down into Mengstraße, the clattering on the cobbles completes the illusion of being immersed in another world, in the Lübeck of the turn of the 19th Century. Only once a year, at Christmas, are the white sheets, which symbolise the approaching move shortly after the death of the Frau Consul, taken down, and the rooms are aglitter with Christmas brilliance.\n\nBut not to be forgotten: the history of the novel, its genesis, its production, the scandal it provoked in Lübeck, the Nobel Prize for Literature which it won in 1929 and not least its worldwide reception, which continues to this day – from translations to the stage adaptations, radio plays and films. Enough space is dedicated to these aspects of the novel in the exhibition, that alongside aesthetic enjoyment, the exhibition also offers cultural-historical context from which the novel arose.\n\nOnly a few original pieces have been handed down, a few pieces from the family estate – the font, or the cup celebrating the family firm’s 100 year jubilee – which provide a point of contact to the real Mann family, and connect real life with the literary work. Apart from where these items are concerned, the principle of established reality dominates.\n\nAnd thus is the mental image conjured up in the permanent ground floor exhibition “The Manns – a family of writers” completed. The ‘Windsors of Germany’ stand out in their uniqueness, their internationality, but also in their fractured psyches."
