        "text": "IIE is proud to celebrate Jewish American Heritage Month and pay tribute to the contributions and leadership of Jewish Americans to IIE, the field of international education, and the world. To commemorate Jewish Heritage Month this year, we took a look back at the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German (later Foreign) Scholars.\n\nIn the 1930s, Jewish scholars had been dismissed from their university positions in Europe. Through the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars, IIE stepped in, providing space for some of Europe’s brightest minds to cultivate their ideas and continue their research at U.S. colleges and universities; these acts saved the lives and scholarship of prominent scientists, writers, and other talented individuals who might have faced persecution or death because of their background and beliefs.\n\nFrom 1933 to 1935, American broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow chaired the Committee, playing a lead role in finding positions and securing funding for refugee scholars from Europe. It was after his time at IIE that Murrow rose to prominence, covering World War II in a series of live CBS radio broadcasts from Europe. In an interview later in his life, Murrow reflected on his time at IIE: “It was the most personally satisfying undertaking in which I have ever engaged, and contributed more to my knowledge of politics and international relations than any similar period in my life.”\n\nIt was the most personally satisfying undertaking in which I have ever engaged, and contributed more to my knowledge of politics and international relations than any similar period in my life.”\n\nEdward R. Murrow\n\nAssistant Director of IIE and Chair of the\n\nEmergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Scholars\n\nDetermined to surmount financial and social barriers to entry at U.S. higher education institutions, IIE worked with philanthropic organizations to secure funding for the scholars. The contributions of the Rockefeller Foundation and private philanthropists would extend beyond $1.5 million and between 1933 and 1946, approximately 400 European scholars received such aid. United States higher education gained notable scholars such as Martin Buber, Paul Tillich, Jacques Maritain, and even Nobel Prize laureates."
