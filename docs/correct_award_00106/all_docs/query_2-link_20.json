        "text": "Chapter 1\n\nThe Teacher of Germany\n\nAn author like Thomas Mann has made deeper strata of the German spirit and soul accessible to the world than any number of books that merely present experience or memory in formulaic fashion… . In the continuities that connect Thomas Mann to Nietzsche and Wagner, European intellectual circles get a clear sense for the continuity of German spiritual development.\n\n—Max Rychner, “The Nobel Prize in Literature 1929”\n\nWhenever I meet Thomas Mann, 3,000 years of tradition look down upon me.\n\n—Bertolt Brecht, letter to Karl Korsch, July/August 1941\n\nThat Thomas Mann should at one point be celebrated in the United States as the leading voice of the “other Germany,” and as an intimate enemy of his native country’s official government, would have come as a surprise to many who read his works during the time of the First World War. In his exhaustive summation of his political views of the time, the paradoxically titled Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man (1918), Mann argues that a true artist is obligated to refrain from any intervention in public affairs. He further describes this attitude as distinctively German and casts scorn on writers who try their hand at journalistic commentary, a stance he associates with French and English public life.\n\nTwenty years later, these earlier remarks would occasionally still come to haunt him. In December of 1938, for example, the New York Herald Tribune published a letter to the editor that condemned America’s embrace of Mann as a spokesperson of the other Germany, and demanded, “Read his ‘Friedrick und die Grosse Koalition’ [sic]—there’s a copy in the New York Public Library—and observe the sea-change that has in recent years transmogrified his political theorizing.”1 The author of this letter, a certain Thomas A. Baggs, was poorly informed about Mann’s oeuvre in translation, for “Frederick and the Grand Coalition” was, in fact, the only one of the author’s patriotic wartime writings that had been translated. But the larger point stands. For example, Mann had written that Germany would inevitably win the war, because “history will not crown ignorance and error with victory” (GKFA, 15.1:45). Had ordinary Americans in the late 1930s been aware of such chauvinistic remarks, they would most likely have abandoned him.2 Mann himself was keenly aware of this, and made sure that Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man was never translated into English during his lifetime.\n\nViewed from a different perspective, however, Reflections actually foreshadows rather than negates Mann’s later role in America. For its very existence is premised on the assumption that an author and his country are conjoined by a representational link, and that both the words and the actions of an individual reflect the larger character of the national community. This assumption—or rather this active desire to become representative—guided Thomas Mann’s career from the very beginning and remained intact throughout his various reinventions and transmogrifications.\n\nDuring the years of the Weimar Republic, Mann’s representative aspirations became the subject of much commentary and even more ridicule. As early as 1919, the conservative journalist Hanns Elster bestowed upon Mann the epithet “precaeptor Germaniae” (teacher of Germany), an honorific title that had first been applied to the Renaissance humanist Philipp Melanchthon and indicated an author who through his writings guided the nation to self-understanding.3 Conservative opinion cooled off considerably after Thomas Mann publicly embraced the Weimar constitution in 1922. A satirical drawing by the right-wing caricaturist Arthur Johnson relentlessly mocks him as panegyrist of the republic (figure 1.1). Liberal and left-wing opinion was often similarly scathing. The Austrian essayist Jean Améry, for example, wrote an amusing piece in which he spoofs the obeisance that Thomas Mann so often seemed to expect (and usually received) from the Weimar public by summarizing the breathless narration that a German radio reporter provided from the 1929 Nobel Prize awards ceremony: “Thomas Mann just arose from his seat, and now his figure, so accustomed to wearing a tailcoat [seine frackgewohnte Gestalt], is approaching the podium with bounding steps.”4\n\nIn reality, Thomas Mann wasn’t nearly as rigid and pretentious as his fiercest critics liked to suggest. His copious and often agonized reflections concerning his representative status reveal that he was instead intensely attuned to the social flux around him. And his later career in America demonstrates that he ultimately owed his fame to his ability not to resist, but rather to respond to, unprecedented historical conditions. Whatever else it might have been, Nazism was a powerful manifestation of modernity. In successfully positing himself as its antipode, Mann was not expressing blind obeisance to tradition but rather engaging in a dialectical dance that transformed the social role of the author into something that it had never been before.\n\nFigure 1.1. Arthur Johnson, “Thomas Mann, Panegyrist of the German Republic,” Kladderadatsch, July 22, 1923, n.p.\n\nRole Models and Literary Antecedents\n\nThe most obvious symptoms of Mann’s search for representational forms that would be suitable for his own era can be found, paradoxically, in his near-constant reflections upon the literary past. Mann’s numerous speeches and essays about his poetic forebears do not simply form an attempt to appropriate these figures as sources of authority. The outrage with which conservative circles greeted his 1933 lecture “The Suffering and Greatness of Richard Wagner” (in which Mann accuses Wagner of bourgeois pretentiousness and questions whether the idea of the “total work of art” is really as artistically profound as the composer’s disciples would argue) already demonstrates this.5 Mann’s critical reflections should instead be seen as attempts to better understand the present by analyzing both its similarities and its differences to the recent past.\n\nOne of the most important antecedents whom Mann used as a reference point in this process of historical self-triangulation was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Mann’s literary engagement with the older writer was multifaceted and encompassed such internally diverse projects as the story “A Weary Hour” (1905), the essays “Goethe and Tolstoi” (1923), “Goethe as a Representative of the Bourgeois Age” (1932), “Goethe’s Career as a Writer” (1933), “Goethe’s Faust” (1938), and “Goethe and Democracy” (1949), as well as the historical novel Lotte in Weimar (1939). Indeed, it is notable that with the exception of a single essay on Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (“Lessing,” 1929) and a few crucial remarks about Martin Luther, Mann never turned his gaze on any earlier figure in German literary history.\n\nGoethe was not the first writer ever to be acclaimed as the archetypal spokesperson of the German cultural tradition. The example of Philipp Melanchthon has already been mentioned, and during the 1780s German readers celebrated the novelist Christoph Martin Wieland as their “classical national author.”6 Goethe, however, was the first person to outline a theory of artistic representativeness that took into consideration the extent to which authorial reputations are both created and continually undermined by social change. In his classic pronouncement on the subject, “Literary Sansculottism” (more commonly translated as “Response to a Literary Rabble-Rouser,” 1795), he argued that Germany would never be able to produce a truly “national” author because the country was “politically splintered despite representing a geographical unity” and lacked a “real cultural center where writers can gather and find a common guideline to aid their development.”7 Goethe also fretted about the increasing influence of a “mass public without taste.”8 In other words, he displayed a keen analytical understanding of the dawning age of nation-states, as well as of the constraints that govern artistic production in bourgeois societies, in which writers can no longer depend on the aristocratic patronage of the feudal court system. In the two essays that Mann wrote to commemorate the centenary of Goethe’s death, “Goethe as a Representative of the Bourgeois Age” and “Goethe’s Career as a Writer,” he took great care to emphasize this modernizing aspect of the great author’s legacy.\n\nA second foundational rumination on representative authorship within the German tradition, Friedrich Schiller’s “On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry,” was also published in 1795. Like Goethe, Schiller was a lifelong intellectual touchstone for Thomas Mann, who paid heartfelt tributes to his forebear in the story “A Weary Hour,” the abandoned essay manuscript “Intellect and Art” (1909–12), and the “Essay on Schiller” (1955), among others.9 As was the case with “Literary Sansculottism,” “On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry” had been written in response to the trauma of the French Revolution. According to Schiller, the revolution reveals the fundamentally fragmented nature of modern societies. In such societies, artists will have to commit to one of two choices. They can either strive for an ideal depiction of their surroundings, treating the world as if it could somehow be made whole again, or they can adopt a reflective and critical attitude, acknowledging that they will invariably produce fragments. To artists choosing the former path, Schiller gives the name “poets” (Dichter); to those choosing the latter he refers as “writers” (Schriftsteller).10\n\nOver the course of the nineteenth century, Germans began to self-identify as citizens of a “country of poets and thinkers” (Land der Dichter und Denker).11 The concept of the critical and reflective “writer” was instead associated with neighboring France and to a lesser extent also with Great Britain and the United States. In the early years of the twentieth century, as tensions between Germany and the western European nations intensified, it was joined by the more derogatory term “man of letters” (Literat), which referred to a professional scribbler or hack, somebody capable of adopting any viewpoint whatsoever as long as there was money to be made from it.12\n\nThe irony, of course, is that German society in the late nineteenth century was more fractious than it had been at any point in the country’s past. The second industrial revolution, set in motion by the dawn of the electrical and petrochemical ages, belatedly threw what had been a largely agrarian nation into a condition of modernity. And modern societies inevitably splinter into a number of discrepant groups—workers, capitalists, beleaguered farmers and artisans, bureaucrats, intellectuals—whose outlooks contradict one another as a consequence of the differing roles that they play in the social collective. Writers certainly do not escape this process. At the same time that popular sentiment in Germany thus enshrined the poet as a kind of oracular figure, the sole guarantor of a national identity that in real life seemed lost amid the squabbles of partisan interest groups, the people doing the actual writing were busy carving out a social niche for themselves that was as insular as any other.\n\nIn light of this gap between image and reality, it will be evident why Thomas Mann raised considerable hackles when, to mark the centenary of Goethe’s death, he pronounced him a prototypical “representative of the bourgeois age” and—even worse—spoke of his “career as a writer” (Laufbahn als Schriftsteller) rather than of his “calling as a poet.” Mann even explicitly stated that “it is a fruitless and futile mania of the critics to insist on a distinction between the poet and the writer—an impossible distinction, for the boundary between the two does not lie in the product of either, but rather in the personality of the artist himself” (ED, 44, translation modified; GW, 10:181–82). This was not an innocent pronouncement but rather a highly self-aware effort to enlist Goethe’s prestige as a quintessentially “German” artist for a reformed understanding of what might actually constitute such a representative function.\n\nMann’s inspiration for this process of redefinition was Friedrich Nietzsche, from whom he borrowed the term “insight” (Erkenntnis, a word that is sometimes also translated as “knowledge” or “understanding”) as the principal goal for which the modern writer should strive. In his first major aesthetic manifesto, the 1906 essay “Bilse and I,” for example, Mann wrote, “There is an intellectual school in Europe—Friedrich Nietzsche created it—which has accustomed us to combine the concept of the poet with that of the one who strives for insight. Within this school, the border between art and criticism has become much less definite than it used to be” (GKFA, 14.1:105–6). Four years later, in the unpublished essay “On the Social Position of the Writer in Germany,” he again asserted that the modern man of letters is “an artist of insight, separated from art in the naive and trusting sense by self-consciousness, intellect, moralism, and a critical disposition” (GKFA, 14.1:225). Intellectual activity and a moral sense here combine with self-consciousness to reinforce the image of an artist as someone who is painfully aware of living in a fragmented world, in which all viewpoints are inevitably subject to further disputation and critique.\n\nThis insistence on critical reflection and an awareness of things as they actually are was largely rooted in Mann’s lifelong respect for his forefathers, who rose to their prominent social position through bourgeois pragmatism and commercial calculation. Already in 1895, for example, he wrote a letter to his friend Otto Grautoff in which he placed the “writer with a strong intellectual talent” above the mere poet, but the businessman above both (GKFA, 21:58; emphasis in original). By contrast, Mann had very little patience for the conventional German understanding of the “poet” as a purveyor of idealized alternatives to reality, or of what in one of his notebooks he calls creations that “arise from Orphic depths with slurred speech” (GuK, 158). “No modern creative artist,” so he insisted, “can regard the critical faculty as something that is opposed to his inner nature” (GKFA, 14.1:86). Everything that he ever wrote about Goethe, Schiller, and indeed Wagner can consequently be read as an attempt to disentangle these figures from their traditional role in German intellectual life and recuperate them as forerunners of his own conception of the modern writer. This would prove to be a lifelong task, and the frustration is evident in Mann’s 1925 response to the conservative German professor Conrad Wandrey, who had sent him a manuscript once again extolling the virtues of the Germanic poet type: “What is certain is that this a difficult and almost always awkwardly executed opposition. You do know that Goethe, in contrast to Shakespeare, considered himself to be a writer, don’t you?” (GKFA, 23.1:136).\n\nArtistic Habitus and the Contrast with Stefan George\n\nFiguring out how to position himself in relationship to an existing discourse concerning representative authorship was only the first step in Thomas Mann’s struggle for self-definition. He also needed to show that he could fully inhabit the new subject position that he had articulated. This was a task at which he succeeded marvelously, and indeed, nowadays he is much less remembered for his written commentaries on the social position of the modern writer than he is for his remarkably theatrical attempts to live as one.\n\nThis attempt to embody what it might mean to be a modern writer, and to subordinate his public appearance to a specific set of rules to which the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu would refer as a “habitus,” can be contrasted with the quite different strategy of the previous generation of cultural producers, the literary bohème. The bohème had come into being in the 1850s, when artists first tried to articulate a distinctive identity, a code of behavior that would separate the professional from the mere amateur.13 Mann still experienced bohemian culture, with its eccentric mannerisms, strategically dissolute lifestyles, and outlandish manners of dress, in his adopted home of Munich-Schwabing during the 1890s, and it left an imprint on his earliest stories. By that time, however, bohemianism had already largely given way to something else altogether, namely the ideology of l’art-pour-l’art. While the bohème had endeavored to carve out a social space for the artist in the modern world, the disciples of l’art-pour-l’art went one step further and turned their backs on that world. They advocated for the purity of art and for the independence (both financially and sociologically) of cultural production from society at large.\n\nThe foremost representative of this tendency in Germany was the poet Stefan George, who gathered around him a circle of admirers who believed his art to be an expression of the true, the “secret” Germany. In the words of George’s disciple Friedrich Wolters, this secret Germany hovered “in the free space of its own self-created atmosphere” above “the domains of ethnic and economic borders, unconfined by topography or customs unions.”14 Much like Mann, George was supremely conscious of the fact that his ability to embody a specific vision of modern authorship crucially depended not only on the quality of his writing but also on choices of personal comportment, such as dress, work habits, and interpersonal attitudes. Blessed with an aquiline nose vaguely reminiscent of Dante Alighieri, George thus affected priestlike vestments and would wander around Munich swathed in an aura of noble asceticism.15\n\nMann detested Stefan George and parodied his influence in several of his works, most notably in the short story “At the Prophet’s” (1904) and in the final chapter of The Magic Mountain. The literary critic Daniel DiMassa blames this animosity largely on the fact that both authors were gay and yet held very different views about same-sex attraction.16 It is just as true, however, that Mann had no patience for George’s attempts to lead art away from society, to close it in upon itself until it could only be appreciated by the properly initiated. If literature was to be guided by the artist’s critical faculties, then it needed to open out upon the world. By cultivating a consciously bourgeois lifestyle that in many ways was outwardly indistinguishable from that led by successful lawyers, merchants, or politicians, Mann was thus setting out in the exact opposite direction from that chosen by George and his circle.\n\nMuch more was at stake than just the question of how one dressed and presented oneself in public, however. The final decades of the nineteenth century were also a period in which the publishing landscape became cleft by an ever-widening chasm between popular outlets hoping primarily to make money and those catering to a self-defining clientele. Journals and to a lesser extent publishing houses had, of course, always catered to diverse audiences, and differences in aesthetic preferences are one of the ways in which social hierarchies become instrumentalized.17 But rapid urbanization, widespread employment, and a noticeable rise in literacy all combined to rapidly accelerate this development. As new mass-market dailies catered to the urban masses—many of them also printing fiction and cultural reviews—a number of more intellectual journals came into being hoping to defend the needs of modern art.18 Similarly, once the larger publishing houses began issuing cheap reprints of the German classics, making it difficult for younger artists to compete in an already-saturated market, smaller firms came to their rescue.\n\nGeorge, unsurprisingly, elected to position himself against the demands of the market, self-publishing most of his works in his journal Blätter für die Kunst, as well as in the publishing house that went with it.19 Mann chose a different route. His early stories appeared in or were contracted by smaller publications, such as the naturalist magazine Die Gesellschaft, the art nouveau journal Pan, and the satirical weekly Simplicissimus, which also offered him an editorial position.20 But by 1897, he had established a permanent base in the pages of the Neue deutsche Rundschau (later simply Neue Rundschau)—the house journal of the S. Fischer publishing firm, which aimed to introduce demanding modern fiction to the center of German social life. Three years later, Mann was offered the chance of a lifetime when Fischer agreed to publish his debut novel Buddenbrooks, though at the insistence that he cut his manuscript by half. Audaciously, Mann refused, arguing that the integrity of his work depended upon it—and he prevailed. The initial printing of Buddenbrooks was a commercial flop, though the novel found an audience when Fischer lowered the price and released it as a single volume rather than in a more cumbersome two-volume edition. Soon it went through print run after print run, and by the late 1920s, it had become one of the bestselling German novels of all time.\n\nFor Mann, this combination of initial failure followed by spectacular success was perhaps the best of all possible outcomes. On the one hand, his refusal to compromise on his work even in the face of market opposition established him as someone who could creditably defend the autonomy of modern art. The subsequent success of his stories, on the other hand, vindicated him as someone who could speak to, and ultimately also for, an entire society. In the early years of the twentieth century, Mann could therefore shift gears and begin to produce with a wider audience in mind, knowing that his reputation as a writer of quality was assured. He was nevertheless careful how he went about this, and in 1908, when he placed one of his stories (“A Railway Accident”) in a mass-market daily for the first time, he still felt compelled to inform friends and family that “it was really nothing at all. A thing of one afternoon, done only on account of the surprisingly decent fee they pay. Christmas is expensive” (GKFA, 21:404). Soon, however, he grew bolder. He convinced Fischer to license a mass-market paperback of his novella Tristan, and by the early 1920s, he was routinely driving hard negotiations with his publisher in order to persuade a reluctant Fischer to try to reach for more popular markets. The celebrated outcome of these endeavors was the so-called people’s edition of Buddenbrooks, which sold almost one million copies between 1929 and 1935.21\n\nFinding the right kind of presentation for his stories was only part of the battle. Two further qualities were required to complete Mann’s self-realization as the kind of modern writer that he envisioned. First, he needed to acquire visibility as a public figure, and as someone who could command respect not only through his writing but also through the force of his personality. This he achieved primarily by embarking on a series of highly successful reading tours, but also through less conventional strategies, such as his innovative use of author photographs to suggest a modern professional identity.22 The second quality that was required to truly live up to the Nietzschean ideal of the modern intellectual was self-reflexivity, or an awareness of the fact that his works were themselves a part of German society and thus available to critique from vantage points other than his own. Mann’s early endeavors in this regard have a certain roguish quality to them. In 1901, for example, we find him giving his friend and admirer Otto Grautoff detailed instructions on what the latter should say in a book review of Mann’s recently published Buddenbrooks (GKFA, 21:179). Throughout his life, Mann studied reviews of his works very carefully, and frequently responded to them either privately or in print.23 He also went out of his way to befriend professors from around the world who took an interest in his stories, and he was an early member of the Bonn Society for Literary History, the first-ever German academic society devoted exclusively to contemporary literature.24 In 1909 he also became one of the founding members of the Association for the Protection of German Writers (Schutzverband deutscher Schriftsteller), a lobbying organization for literary professionals. Through the association, an interest group created by cultural producers for cultural producers, Mann could creditably fight for the independence of modern art from mere economic demands while simultaneously ensuring that it was firmly anchored in larger German society.\n\nBy the second decade of the twentieth century, then, Thomas Mann had not only philosophically articulated, but also publicly modeled, an entirely modern conception of what a writer should be, one that stood profoundly at odds with conservative understandings of the “poet.” This modern conception of the writer’s role meshed only uneasily with Mann’s simultaneous ambition to be perceived as the mouthpiece of his nation. In his 1901 instructions to Otto Grautoff, he had already urged his younger friend first and foremost to stress “the German character of the novel” (GKFA, 21:179). And several years later, he confided in his notebooks that he possessed an “inclination to see myself as a national factor, to regard myself as essentially national” (Nb., 2:120). But if modern writing was defined not only by the embrace of the critical faculty but also by self-awareness, and thus by a cognizance of the writer’s perspectival limitations, then how could a truly modern artist ever claim to speak for an entire nation? Throughout the early 1900s Thomas Mann wrestled with this question, and his literary projects of that period bear the imprint of his struggle. He tried—with mixed success—to adapt classic forms of German literature to the twentieth century: the novella (with Tonio Kröger, 1903), the historical drama (with Fiorenza, 1906), and even the novel of development, or bildungsroman (with The Magic Mountain, which he began in 1913). Ultimately he concluded, however, that such forms could only be used as a matter of parody (GKFA, 15.1:175–76). And he also began—and then quickly abandoned—a number of monumental projects, such as the essay “Intellect and Art” or a historical novel about Frederick the Great, in which he would presumably have sought to shed critical light on the vagaries of the German national experience.\n\nMann’s struggles did lead him to one noticeable success, the 1912 novella Death in Venice. The protagonist of this story, Gustav von Aschenbach, has completed all the projects that Mann himself had abandoned over the previous years; we are also told that he enjoys the “homage” (SD, 381; GKFA, 2.1:506) of his nation. Official school textbooks carry excerpts from his stories, and a well-meaning aristocrat has even bestowed upon him an honorific title of nobility. But Aschenbach’s greatness is also predicated on his conscious renunciation of the intellectual ideals for which Mann himself was striving, of “criticism” and of “insight.” As a young man, we learn, he “had done homage to intellect, had overworked the soil of knowledge [Erkenntnis] and ground up her seed-corn” (SD, 385; GKFA, 2.1:512). But as he matured, he had “turned his back on the realm of knowledge and passed it by with averted face, lest it lame his will or power of action” (SD, 386; GKFA, 2.1:513). It is precisely this renunciation of knowledge, and particularly of critical self-knowledge, that will lead to Aschenbach’s eventual downfall in Venice when his encounter with Tadzio forces him to confront truths about himself that he is ill-equipped to handle.\n\nPolitical Engagement and the Contrast with Émile Zola and Maximilian Harden\n\nMann’s struggles to reconcile his self-conception as a modern writer with his ambition to be perceived as a “national factor” can be usefully contrasted with those of the older colleague to whom he would later be compared during his American exile: the French author Émile Zola. When he published his famous open letter “J’accuse” in the Paris daily L’aurore, Émile Zola, then fifty-eight years old, already stood at the peak of his influence and was arguably the most famous novelist in all of France. With essays such as “The Experimental Novel” (1880), he had also elevated the naturalist movement into the public consciousness, and was thus recognized as a principal voice of modernism in literature. The social context from which he had sprung was very different from that of Thomas Mann, however. As the historian Christophe Charle has shown, the strong influence that Auguste Comte’s philosophical positivism exerted upon French educated society in the 1890s caused an entire generation of French intellectuals to adopt scientism as its guiding credo, especially since this worldview served as a useful rallying cry in a battle with the aging grandees who held prestigious posts in the academies and grandes écoles.25 Zola’s naturalism was the literary outgrowth of this scientistic movement. Naturalism claimed to carry into the artistic sphere the same impassioned analytical gaze, the same ambition to speak truth for truth’s sake that also characterized recent advances in the hard as well as social sciences. And it furthermore believed that that a scientific disposition was the only way to adequately render human social life, because human actions could—at least on a general level—be attributed to extrapersonal forces capable of objective study.\n\nWith his intervention in the Dreyfus case, Zola applied his ambition to cultivate a neutral analytical stance to the realm of social affairs.26 When the Nation, in 1937, published Mann’s letter to the dean of the philosophical faculty at Bonn as “I Accuse the Hitler Regime,” it clearly meant to draw a parallel to this earlier intervention. In reality, however, the two acts were quite differently motivated. Thomas Mann knew Zola’s novels, was influenced by naturalist thought in the early stages of his career, and later in life even declared that Zola had been one of the “gods” “of his youth (GW, 13:134). And yet he never commented on “J’accuse” or on the Dreyfus affair more generally when it happened. This silence is all the more remarkable because the affair was widely discussed in Germany.27\n\nMann’s silence can be explained by the fact that he neither regarded his own intellectual stance as detached and scientistic, nor was he as yet willing to admit that modernity might sometimes place the cultural producer into militant opposition to other social institutions, such as the military, parliament, or the courts. By birth, Mann belonged to the typically German social class of the Bildungsbürgertum: a subsegment of the bourgeoisie that defined its status not just through its accumulated wealth but primarily through education and specifically through cultural erudition. As Gangolf Hübinger has argued, the Bildungsbürger believed himself to be equally at home in the scientific, cultural, and political spheres of society.28 It was only during the latter years of the nineteenth century, when scientists, writers, and politicians all began to develop their own professional ethos, that this self-understanding slowly began to fall apart. And Mann had no interest in the scientistic worldview that began to take hold in the research laboratories of the empire. His preferred terms for intellectual activity, Geist and its adjectival correlate geistig, are instead of humanistic origin and could also be translated as “spiritual.”29 Lacking such a scientistic basis, Mann also did not follow Zola in the assumption that the foremost social role of the artist should be to proclaim “truth.” Instead, he believed that writers should use their intellectual powers to analyze the opposing viewpoints that were an inevitable consequence of any modern society, and then produce artistic statements that would expose these viewpoints to public scrutiny while withholding judgment of their own.\n\nTwo further factors undoubtedly contributed to Thomas Mann’s apparent reluctance to comment on the Dreyfus trial. The first was his fraternal rivalry with his older brother, Heinrich, who was himself a highly regarded novelist. Heinrich’s admiration for modern French literature, and for the works of Zola in particular, was well known, and Mann thus made a strategic choice to seek other means of defining his artistic identity.30 The second was Mann’s reluctance to embrace journalistic activities. Émile Zola had launched his manifesto not in a small literary magazine with close connections to the naturalist movement but rather in the socialist daily L’aurore, which was then edited by Georges Clemenceau, the future president of the republic. Clemenceau, furthermore, immediately recognized the significance of what he was about to publish. He posted broadsheets all over Paris and increased his print run more than tenfold, from the usual twenty to thirty thousand to roughly three hundred thousand copies. “J’accuse,” then, was a genuine intervention in the public sphere of its country, targeted not solely at the more educated liberal and socialist clientele that ordinarily read L’aurore, but at a mass public (figure 1.2). It appealed to its readers as citizens of the French Republic, not as individuals holding specific political beliefs or cultural pedigrees.\n\nFigure 1.2. Émile Zola’s “J’accuse” on the front page of L’aurore, January 13, 1898. Public domain/Wikimedia Commons.\n\nBy contrast, Mann’s relationship both with the popular press and with the concept of a “German public” was much more complicated. Of course he was anxious to become a well-known and widely read author, but this goal was initially secondary to being perceived as a writer of quality. Broadsheets and popular newspapers were unlikely to be helpful in this strategy; Mann’s ambivalence about publishing his “Railway Accident” in the Viennese Neue Freie Presse contrasts tellingly with his unbridled joy about seeing his novella Tristan reprinted by the mass-market publisher Reclam. Reclam had made its reputation by offering affordable editions of the classics. As such, it was a focal point for the self-perception of the Bildungsbürgertum, the social stratum that Mann identified as his primary audience, and whose internal cohesion was actively threatened by the thought that everyone, even workers, was now reading newspapers.\n\nMann’s hesitation to embrace the medium of the popular newspaper was undoubtedly aggravated by a public scandal that occurred in 1906 and formed a rough German equivalent to the Dreyfus case: the Harden-Eulenburg affair. In November of that year, the journalist Maximilian Harden, whose every move Mann followed with a mixture of envy, awe, and disgust, published an article in which he accused Kaiser Wilhelm II of having endangered national security through an alleged relationship with a member of his general staff, Prince Philipp zu Eulenburg.31 The accusations and resulting trials held the German public spellbound for several years. Whereas Zola emerged from the Dreyfus affair a hero, however, having exposed the illiberal and deeply anti-Semitic mindset of the French military, Harden could not score a similar success. Sued for defamation, he lost both in a court of law and in the court of public opinion. The consensus, essentially, was that he was a ruthless journalist who had tried to engineer a public scandal in order to increase the circulation of his paper. The affair, furthermore, had disastrous consequences for Germany’s gay subculture, which had previously thrived amid a cultural milieu that was actually more welcoming than that of most other European nations in the early twentieth century.32\n\nAs a closeted gay man, Thomas Mann followed the Eulenburg affair closely. He commented publicly on it only once, in a 1907 response to an opinion survey in the daily newspaper Der Morgen, in which he praised Harden’s “political seriousness, his sense of responsibility, and his will towards the positive” (GKFA, 14.1:179).33 Privately, however, he clearly entertained doubts. In his working notes to “Intellect and Art,” for example, he described Harden as a “man of letters who has been perverted into becoming a politician” and who “compromised Germany … through the whole Eulenburg affair” (GuK, 217). These phrases outline very clearly Mann’s evident revu lsion at the thought of cultural production as a form of political activism, a verdict that easily could have been applied to Zola in the Dreyfus affair.\n\nFor perhaps the first time in his writings, Mann in this passage also used the term “man of letters” (Literat) to refer to a particular author type from which he was trying distance himself. Although Mann in his published writings prior to the First World War employed the words Literat and Schriftsteller fairly interchangeably (see, e.g., the essay “The Artist and the Man of Letters” of 1913), he was privately attempting to draw finer distinctions between the writer who critically analyzes for the benefit of others and the man of letters who abuses his analytical powers for a partisan purpose.34 Soon enough, he would also employ this distinction publicly, with explosive results.\n\nRepresentation and the Contrast with Heinrich Mann and Gerhart Hauptmann\n\nGermany’s invasion of Belgium in August 1914 greatly intensified the pressure on Thomas Mann to finally find an adequate form for his representative aspirations. Surely now, more than ever, the nation needed a spokesperson who could represent its cultural values to the world? Mann’s initial response to the call was revealing. Shortly after the invasion, he published an essay titled “Thoughts in Times of War,” in which he strongly supported the actions of the German government. And in early 1915 he followed up with his essay “Frederick and the Grand Coalition,” in which he reshaped some of the materials that he had accumulated for his abandoned historical novel into an essay examining the causes of the Seven Years’ War.\n\nThe outbreak of the war coincided with a new and even more intense confrontation with Heinrich that finally forced Thomas Mann to publicly position himself vis-à-vis Zola. In the spring of 1915, Heinrich published an essay in which he praised the French writer as a militant intellectual. The essay begins with the sarcastic observation that “writers who affect a self-assured and ‘representative’ [weltgerecht] demeanor during their twenties will generally see their talents wither by mid-career.”35 It didn’t take a lot of skill to identify this as a barb aimed at his younger brother, who was about to turn forty and had not published a major novel since Buddenbrooks fourteen years earlier (Royal Highness, in 1909, had met with only tepid critical and commercial success). Thomas Mann took this insult quite personally. Mere personal insult alone cannot explain, however, why he decided to set aside all work on his novel The Magic Mountain and devote the next three years to his Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man. To arrive at some account for this, one also has to keep in mind that Heinrich’s essay was intended as a partisan intervention in debates about modern authorship, a conscious taking of sides for Zola and against Thomas. It contains the fateful line “a war can be necessary and moral as long as it is the outcome of a long struggle for truth.”36 The meaning of these words is obvious, given Zola’s well-known insistence that the obligation of the modern writer was to struggle for truth not only in fiction but also in social affairs. They constitute a clear endorsement of the writer as a political agent, right down to the point of agitating for war. And of course they also provide tacit support for the French side in the First World War, a fact that only hastened Thomas’s resolve to align himself with the German position instead.\n\nReflections of a Nonpolitical Man is, therefore, first and foremost an attempt to outline a conception of the modern writer that might be placed in conscious opposition to that offered by Zola and Heinrich. On a personal level, the book is also a sustained attack on the hated brother. Going in a more general direction, it is furthermore a polemical attempt to contrast German and French national characters. But the personal and the general are really two sides of the same coin: attacks undertaken not as much for their own sake as in an attempt to bolster Mann’s own representative strivings.\n\nReflections is the only place in Mann’s entire oeuvre in which he offers an (albeit brief) analysis of Zola’s intervention in the Dreyfus affair, confessing that he did not want “Dreyfus to be condemned and then acquitted for political reasons—for the acquittal of an innocent person for political reasons is no less repulsive than his conviction on the same basis” (R, 189; GKFA, 13.1:285). The logic underlying this conclusion is hair-raising, but the assumption that judicial decisions should be based on deliberations about justice, not political expediency, is clearly sound. Zola would, of course, have agreed with this rather elementary point. But the two men part ways over the question whether it should be the task of the writer to pursue political causes in an attempt to restore justice in situations where it was abrogated. Mann clearly thought not.\n\nWhat then was to be the task of the representative writer? One answer that Mann gives in Reflections is that it is to steer away from the corrosive influence of partisan politics, and instead to try to remain impartial by making the best case for both sides on any given issue. This strategy Mann calls “aestheticism,” though he is careful to differentiate himself from the l’art-pour-l’art understanding of that term by insisting that he does not mean “dying in beauty or always having figures of speech such as ‘wine leaves in the hair’ on one’s tongue” (R, 161; GKFA, 13.1:244). As quintessential examples of aesthetes, Mann instead lists a diverse set of writers (Schiller, Gustave Flaubert, Arthur Schopenhauer, Lev Tolstoy, August Strindberg, and Nietzsche, among others) who each aimed for such a complex depiction of reality. In his 1803 play The Bride of Messina, for example, Schiller has the same character praise both peace and war within a few lines of one another. Had Schiller advocated only for the former, we might have acclaimed him as “enlightened and praiseworthy.” Had he spoken only for the latter, we would have perceived him as an “enemy of humanity to be combatted.” In either case, however, he would have acted as a “politician”—that is, as a partisan of particular interests. “To immerse himself deeply into the essence of peace and war with the same dilettantish empathy,” however, “was aestheticism” (R, 161; GKFA, 13.1:245).\n\n“Aestheticism” is thus the answer with which Thomas Mann responds to the banner of “truth” that Zola carried into the public sphere. Zola believed that the modern writer deserves to represent society to itself because the writer has learned to cast an indiscriminating eye on the world, to set aside social pieties and clearly describe what is actually the case. From this he furthermore inferred a mandate for political activism as the writer attempts to change the world for the better. Mann makes a different argument. The specific virtue of artists is that they are pledged to an aesthetic view of the world, and thus aim to represent all facets of it. This does not mean that they cannot have strict opinions. Schiller, for instance, lived in a most violent age and definitely had some personal thoughts about the preferability of peace to war. Writers, however, should not issue prescriptions but should act as a kind of catalyst: by making us rehearse all sides of an issue, they force us to come to our own conclusions.\n\nMann’s biographers have often pointed out—usually in a critical tone—that he never fully renounced Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man, not even after his political journey had driven him to embrace the western “civilized world” that he so bitterly attacked in 1918. Instead, Mann generally insisted that Reflections, far from representing a momentary lapse in critical judgment, was actually a crucial stepping stone in his development as a writer.37 Indeed, Mann’s greatest literary achievement of the 1920s, The Magic Mountain, is perhaps better read as a continuation of some of the main arguments of Reflections than as a recantation of them. Back in 1916, shortly after he had set aside the manuscript for his novel, Mann had argued that the most characteristically “German” of all literary forms, the bildungsroman, could nowadays only be appropriated as parody. But in writing Reflections, he found that this was not necessarily true. The character of the Italian humanist Ludovico Settembrini, who appears as a vaguely Satanic tempter figure in the early sections of The Magic Mountain, was now reshaped into a spitting image of “civilization’s man of letters.” Just as importantly, he was given an intellectual antagonist in the form of Leo Naphta, who manages to combine characteristics of an ultramontane Catholic, a Communist, and a fascist demagogue all in one complex personality. Standing between these figures is the protagonist Hans Castorp, who lends a sympathetic ear to both, but pledges allegiance to neither, and instead draws his own conclusions. The Magic Mountain offers a powerful example of what Reflections calls an “aesthetic” point of view, for it is not just Hans Castorp who profits from the exposure to Naphta and Settembrini. By accompanying Castorp on his intellectual path, the reader is exposed to the multiple conflicting ideologies of the interwar period as well. And like Castorp, the reader will learn how to critically evaluate them all, without being forced (or even invited) to take sides.\n\nCastorp’s “aesthetic” openness can usefully be contrasted with the general demeanor of another character in the novel, namely that of Mynheer Peeperkorn. Peeperkorn is in many regards the exact opposite of the novel’s young protagonist. Whereas Castorp lacks a strong personality and tends to be at his best when he gets to react to other characters (he never formulates any ideas of his own but proves to be a master dialectician, brutally skilled at turning a point against the person who originally made it), Peeperkorn exudes authoritarian charisma and repeatedly shows himself capable of shutting down an interlocutor with a simple gesture. In one telling scene, for instance, the quarreling Naphta and Settembrini instantly fall silent when Peeperkorn points toward an eagle that is soaring above them in the mountain air. In a novel that is obsessed with talking, Peeperkorn also stands out because he is practically aphasic. He seems incapable of completing even simple sentences and instead persuades through the nonverbal force of his personality.\n\nThe comparison with Peeperkorn is useful not only because it brings Castorp’s own qualities into sharper focus but also because the Dutch planter is a thinly veiled parody of Mann’s foremost rival in the race to become Germany’s most distinguished writer of the interwar period, Gerhart Hauptmann. As winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1912, Hauptmann was perhaps the most famous German author of the 1920s, not just in Germany itself but internationally. He also happened to share a publisher with Thomas Mann, which made the rivalry between the two men all the more intimate. Hauptmann had leapt onto the literary scene in the late 1880s as the principal German exponent of the naturalist movement. By the 1920s, however, he had settled into bourgeois respectability as the author of neoclassical dramas and verse epics. When the empire collapsed, there were rumors that Hauptmann would be offered the presidency, and throughout the 1920s he was revered as an incarnation of the German national spirit. In 1922, on the occasion of Hauptmann’s sixtieth birthday, the actual German president, Friedrich Ebert, even felt compelled to declare that “By honoring Gerhart Hauptmann, the German nation honors itself.”38\n\nThomas Mann publicly adulated and privately resented his older contemporary, as The Magic Mountain documents. Mynheer Peeperkorn’s appearance and speech patterns are unmistakably modeled on Hauptmann, a fact that was widely remarked upon in the Weimar press and led to some tense moments between the two authors. Hauptmann understandably felt betrayed by his younger colleague, since two years earlier, on the occasion of Hauptmann’s sixtieth birthday, Mann had still paid obeisance to him as a “king of the Republic” (GR, 109; GKFA, 15.1:515). What Mann primarily resented about Hauptmann was that the older man seemed to have built up a representative façade that was backed up by very little substance. Hauptmann fancied himself to be the last great German poet in the tradition of Goethe, and he certainly cultivated a public persona to go along with these claims.39 But in truth, much of his best work was long behind him. It had furthermore been written at a time when Hauptmann still took a self-consciously antagonistic stance to the German state, as the author of scandalous naturalist plays and as a supporter of the socialist party who even inspired the personal ire of the kaiser. Hauptmann had little to say about public life in the Weimar Republic, and when he did speak—so Mann clearly thought, judging by his depiction in The Magic Mountain—he spoke in platitudes.40\n\nDespite all this, Hauptmann largely succeeded at positioning himself as the foremost spokesperson for the new Germany. The Magic Mountain was, among many other things, a gauntlet thrown down in protest against these representative aspirations. The novel is an incomparably more modern work than anything that Hauptmann ever wrote. It rejects the self-enclosed neoclassical style associated with the late Hauptmann and instead aims for a radical openness of both form and content.41 It is precisely this openness that makes it uniquely suited to speak for an internally conflicted society like the Weimar Republic. Political reactionaries were dismayed by the novel, but among a younger generation, Mann now firmly established himself as the foremost literary spokesperson for his country.\n\nIn the Interwar Republic of Letters\n\nBy the mid-1920s, then, Thomas Mann stood at the pinnacle of his fame and influence in Germany. And increasingly, this fame spread across the country’s borders as well. This was not at all a foregone conclusion, for the European interwar republic of letters was still to an astoundingly large extent governed by national prejudices. When Mann and his wife visited Oxford in May 1924, for instance, many of the local dons refused to meet him because (as his translator Helen Tracy Lowe-Porter put it) they did not think he displayed the “sense of guilt” that was felt to be “the proper attitude of all worthy Germans.”42 The following year, the Times Literary Supplement devoted only half a column to the newly published Magic Mountain.43 Mann’s works never sold particularly well on the British Isles, and it was largely Alfred A. Knopf’s influence that convinced the British firm of Martin Secker (later Secker & Warburg) to publish them at all.44 In France matters stood even worse. A French translation of Death in Venice did not come out until 1925. Following its success, Mann was able to persuade the publishing house Kra to take on translations of all of his novels (GKFA, 23.1:224), only to have its editor-in-chief, Léon Pierre-Quint, try to back out of the deal once the German volumes arrived on his desk and he realized how long they were (GKFA, 23.1:280). La montagne magique finally appeared in 1931, Les Buddenbrooks in 1932.\n\nDespite these obstacles, Thomas Mann quickly gained preeminence as a representative of the German cultural tradition not only within the confines of his own country but also abroad. A series of widely publicized lectures around Europe was perhaps the most important motor of this development. Unlike Mann’s earlier speaking commitments, which had mostly comprised readings from his fictional works and were confined to cities that either lay within the German Reich or could boast of large German-speaking minorities, these new lectures were devoted to broader intellectual themes and were frequently written specifically for the occasion. In keeping with Mann’s continued reluctance toward overt political action, he almost always spoke on literary topics. But the attentive audience member never had to burrow very deep in order to discover some kind of applicability to contemporary social problems.\n\nPerhaps the best illustration of this is the 1922 lecture “On the German Republic,” a large part of which is given over to a comparison between two seemingly antithetical writers: the royalist German poet Novalis and the bard of the American republic, Walt Whitman. True to the aesthetic method already propagated in Reflections, Mann pays equal attention to both figures, only to then show that they have much more in common than we might initially assume. The conclusion that Mann draws from these similarities is that the German people ought to give a republican form of government a fighting chance, rather than rejecting it as alien to their traditions. “Goethe and Tolstoi,” “Lessing,” “Freud’s Position in Modern Intellectual History” (1929), and “The Suffering and Greatness of Richard Wagner” represent similar attempts to show Germans how a careful study of their own cultural history might lead them toward reconciliation with the western world. And the Germans were clearly listening, for they flocked to such lectures in droves, as Mann proudly noted in his correspondence with his publisher.45\n\nIncreasingly, Mann also delivered his talks abroad. Unlike his later lecture tours in the United States, his visits to cities such as Amsterdam, Paris, London, Stockholm, or Warsaw generally were noncommercial in nature and came about at the invitation of some kind of hosting organization, such as the local PEN Club. At a time when the reading public in France and Great Britain still viewed German authors with a great deal of suspicion, Mann thus forged personal connections with colleagues in the former enemy countries, for example, with André Gide in France or with John Galsworthy, H. G. Wells, and George Bernard Shaw in England (Galsworthy was the first president of International PEN, and played a crucial role in bringing Mann to London). In return, Mann also tried to introduce foreign-language authors to the Weimar Republic. He thus wrote an important foreword to S. Fischer’s 1926 edition of Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent and for a time served as the coeditor of the book series Novels of the World (Romane der Welt) for the Knaur publishing house.46\n\nThe list of authors with whom Mann associated during the 1920s reveals an important fact about his representative strivings and allows us to shed new light on the nature of literary relations in the interwar republic of letters. Gide, Galsworthy, Wells, and even Conrad—these were all authors who were born between 1855 and 1875 and who therefore belonged to the very first wave of what we now call modernist literature. They rose to prominence and into middle age in the decades before the First World War, and thus before the cataclysmic events that formally and politically radicalized the subsequent generation. These were authors who had struggled to first establish and then defend the autonomy of modern art and who by the 1920s occupied positions as the de facto “elder statesmen” of the European republic of letters. Thomas Mann belonged to the very tail end of this generation. He was young enough to recognize slightly younger contemporaries who would exceed him in stylistic daring, such as Alfred Döblin (born in 1878), James Joyce (1882), or Franz Kafka (1883), as competitors, but still old enough to adopt an attitude toward his craft that owed more to the previous generation. This strange transitional position has led many later critics to underestimate the innovative nature of Mann’s works, especially since Mann’s authorial habitus has come to be so strongly enshrined in the collective literary memory.47 But it needs to be stressed that Mann’s alignment with such people as Gide or Galsworthy was not just a reactionary gesture in the context of the early 1920s. It represented a lesson learned from the horrors of the war in its own right and was thus a legitimate a response to modernity.\n\nThe metaphor of “elder statesmen” seems entirely appropriate to describe the particular redefinition of representative authorship in which Thomas Mann participated during these years. For these prestigious middle-aged writers forged not only personal but also institutional connections across national barriers in an attempt to prevent another world war. The various national PEN Clubs—Mann joined the German one in February 1925 (Br. LF, 514)—are a prime example of this. Similar in function to the Schutzverband that Mann had helped found before the war, they nevertheless differed from this purely national project by virtue of the fact that they were interconnected both through their practical activities and through their charter status as autonomous subsidiaries of International PEN. The Nobel Prize Committee provides another example. Though the first Nobel Prize in Literature had been handed out in 1901, and although technically only members of the Swedish Academy were eligible to participate in the awards deliberations, the Nobel Prize during the 1920s changed from a fairly parochial institution that heavily favored Nordic writers into a major force in European (though not yet “world”) literature. Writers from all over the continent tried to influence prize decisions either directly (past laureates were able to submit recommendations, as Thomas Mann did on several occasions after his 1929 win) or indirectly (though vigorous lobbying activities). Privately endowed, the Nobel furthermore stood above the meddlesome influence of national governments.\n\nAt the same time, the interwar republic of letters was never completely “independent of political boundaries,” as has sometimes been claimed.48 The metaphor of the “republic” here proves entirely apt, for after all, republican systems of government are characterized by the fact that their principal actors function as representatives of larger social collectives. Thomas Mann’s hosts in Holland, France, England, Poland, or Sweden always invited him with the explicit understanding that he would speak to them as the representative of German letters and culture. And Mann gladly obliged. In 1926, for example, he gave a well-received lecture, “The Intellectual Situation in Contemporary Germany,” in Paris on the invitation of the Carnegie Foundation for International Peace. At the same time, he always stressed the fundamental unity of cultural producers across the continent. In an address to the PEN Club in Warsaw (figure 1.3) he remarked, “We [European writers] are bound, determined, and preordained by birth and tradition. We live our lives within verbal and spiritual webs that we ourselves extend as we maintain and develop the culture of our people” (GW, 11:403). Mann nicely summarized his position at another point of the Warsaw lecture, when he pointed at a French colleague and declared, “whatever this man is and means for his country, I am and mean for my country as well. I am to Germany what he is to France. And thus national character becomes a more or less formal concern, a mere external difference that is due to chance. The essential, personal and human elements that unite us are revealed underneath” (GW, 11:403).49\n\nFigure 1.3. Thomas Mann visiting the Polish PEN Club in Warsaw, March 1927. Thomas-Mann-Archiv, ETH Zurich. Photographer: Atelier Karol Pe˛cherski.\n\nThomas Mann’s 1929 Nobel Prize can similarly be seen as a symptom of the reassertion of national characteristics within an international context. Mann owed his prize primarily to the advocacy of the powerful Swedish literary critic Fredrik Böök, a Germanophile who admired Mann primarily because he believed him eminently capable of popularizing the German cultural heritage for an international community.50 The 1929 award was specifically given to Buddenbrooks (by then almost three decades old) rather than to the more stylistically advanced Magic Mountain because Böök believed the older novel stood a better chance of representing German life and German thought on a global stage.\n\nThis paradoxical combination, whereby a writer is at once intimately bound to the traditions of his or her country and, precisely by so being bound, part of a larger community of cultural producers that all share in the same condition, stood at the heart of Mann’s hopes for European peace. As he put it in some remarks to the French PEN Club in Paris,\n\nThe social union of poets and writers, their amicable correspondence from country to country, is of the greatest importance in our day… . There can be no hostility that runs deep enough to permit war between nations whose intellectual advocates are friends. Economic and political conflicts have never been enough to set people at war with one another. Intellectual tension, alienation and strife have always been necessary as well, and these we must prevent and correct. The PEN Club may not have a very predisposing name, but the idea that undergirds it may grow into an important factor for peace and for the reconciliation between nations. (GKFA, 15.1:1094–95)\n\nThese are unquestionably idealistic and perhaps even otherworldly sentences. Yet they are also unmistakably a product of their times. Their goal is to lead Germany back into the community of European nations, rather than to underline its exceptional status as a “nation of culture,” a Kulturnation. It is important to remember in this context both the weakness of the political parties in the Weimar Republic and the inefficiency of the League of Nations on an intergovernmental level. As Thomas Mann noted in a letter to Ernst Robert Curtius shortly before his departure to address the Carnegie Foundation, “The main efforts to achieve an amicable understanding [between France and Germany] will probably have to be made by us [intellectuals]” (Reg., 25/215). In the absence of effective political action, the thought that writers might lead the way toward European reconciliation may not have seemed quite as unrealistic as it does today.\n\nIdealism aside, we can discern in Mann’s various interwar addresses a visionary program statement for an international republic of letters. According to this vision, organizations such as the PEN Clubs function as anchors that ground an international intellectual community within the realm of geographical boundaries and linguistic differences. As chartered entities that come into being within specific national spaces, the clubs both serve these spaces and represent them to the rest of the world. The writers who congregate within them have a similarly representative function. At the same time, however, the centers operate as portals that lead from the national world into a realm of intellectual activity and camaraderie, which knows neither linguistic nor political divisions. Looking back on the past decade in an autobiographical essay that he published in 1930, Mann would interpret his activities in the PEN Clubs and similar institutions as an entirely logical outgrowth of the reigning political circumstances, writing that “the official elevation of literary intellect into an organ of national life … was a logical consequence of social developments in Germany and only confirmed existing circumstances” (GW, 11:136).\n\nBoth the PEN Clubs and the Swedish Royal Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize, are nongovernmental organizations. This does not mean, however, that Mann believed international understanding could only come about in complete independence from political interference. Rather, it is a case of governmental systems sheltering and supporting spaces for free creative and intellectual expression within their midst. To the extent that this assessment insists on the fundamental segregation of culture from politics, it represents a continuation of the position already advanced in Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man. At the same time, Mann took seriously the implication that cultural producers needed to do their part to remind the governing classes of the need for an independent creative sphere. As a founding member of the Section for Poetic Art of the Prussian Academy of the Arts, Mann worked tirelessly toward just this purpose.51\n\nMann’s personal vision of a semiautonomous republic of letters, anchored within national cultures and protected by national governments, yet at the same time international in scope, helps explain why his break with the Nazi regime in 1936 was brought about by such a seemingly trivial occasion as the revocation of his Bonn doctorate. It would be easy to attribute Mann’s consternation over his lost title entirely to his personal vanity, as some people already did during his own lifetime.52 Mann’s outrage and disappointment make perfect sense within the context of his worldview, however. Over the course of the nineteenth century, Germany’s once-parochial universities had established themselves as the very best in the world precisely because of their guiding ideal that they would be state supported yet at the same time entirely autonomous from political demands.53 This commitment toward intellectual autonomy, backed by the financial and administrative heft of the German states (and later the Second German Empire), made their humanistic faculties important institutional pillars of the field of cultural production, as well as of the European republic of letters. An honorary doctorate of letters was thus one of the highest forms of accreditation that a modern writer could possibly achieve. Tellingly, even Gustav von Aschenbach, who seems to have overcome all the obstacles in front of which his creator stumbled, is able to win a certificate of nobility, but not an honorary doctorate.54\n\nTo be stripped of this degree thus meant far more than a personal insult to Thomas Mann. It also illustrated to him the true nature of totalitarian dictatorship, which consists precisely of the dissolution of boundaries between the separate fields that comprise a modern society, and their submission to the dictates of charismatic politics. And since Mann’s self-perception as Germany’s representative in the European republic of letters was built on the notion of a field of cultural production whose autonomy was guaranteed by the power of the state, the attack on the independence of the university meant an attack also on his professional identity. When he arrived in New York in February 1938, his representative status thus was not nearly as self-evident as his confident address to the American nation might indicate. Thomas Mann needed to construct a new kind of representative status, one that would be appropriate to his condition as an émigré and one in which US cultural institutions would play a significant and hitherto underappreciated role."
