        "text": "Thomas Mann Signed Photograph.\n\nMANN, Thomas.\n\n$4,800.00\n\nItem Number: 123909\n\nRare silver gelatin print signed by Nobel Prize-winning author Thomas Mann. Inscribed by him on the lower portion of the photograph, “Mr. Satoru Yamano, with all my good wishes, Thomas Mann.” Double matted and framed. In near fine condition. The entire piece measures 11.5 inches by 10 inches.\n\nGerman novelist, short story writer, and social critic Thomas Mann was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1929, after he had been nominated by Anders Österling, member of the Swedish Academy, principally in recognition of his popular achievement with the epic Buddenbrooks (1901), The Magic Mountain (Der Zauberberg, 1924) and his numerous short stories. His highly symbolic and ironic epic novels and novellas are noted for their insight into the psychology of the artist and the intellectual and his analysis and critique of the European and German soul used modernized versions of German and Biblical stories, as well as the ideas of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Arthur Schopenhauer."
