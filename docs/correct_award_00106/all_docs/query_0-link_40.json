A fine, partially unopened copy, in original very good or better unprinted glassine dust jacket with light wear and tanning on spine. Includes the address by Fredrik Book awarding Thomas Mann the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature (\"1929 Ars Nobelpris I Litteratur\") and Thomas Mann's acceptance speech. Also prints a brief biographical essay about Mann. The other Nobel Laureates for that year were Prince Louis-Victor de Broglie, Arthur Harden, Hans von Euler-Chelpin, Frederick Gowland Hopkins, and Christiaan Eijkman, also printing remarks by each of the scientists, during \"Les conferences Nobel.\" Mann was awarded the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature, principally for his novel *Buddenbrooks,* which is now recognized as one of the classic works of 20th century literature. Very scarce. *OCLC* appears to locate a single copy, in Sweden. (Inventory #: 470136)"
