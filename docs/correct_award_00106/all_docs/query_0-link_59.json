        "text": "On June 6th of 2020 marks the 145th anniversary of the birth of the most famous member of his family, rich in famous writers, Nobel Prize winner in literature Thomas Mann.\n\nPaul Thomas Mann, a German writer, was born in Lübeck on June 6, 1875, in a wealthy family. His father was a grain merchant and head of the family company. Difficulties with money began in 1891 after the death of his father. And the Mann family moves to live in Munich. There, Mann attended University, although he did not receive a degree.\n\nHe worked for an insurance company for a while, then became an editor of a local satirical magazine and began publishing his first short stories.\n\nIn 1896-1898, he lived in Italy with his brother Henry, who was also destined to become a famous writer. In Italy, Thomas Mann began his first major work - the novel ´Buddenbrook´. In this epic family chronicle is described the story of three generations of the Buddenbrooks family in detail. This novel reflects events in Germany in the nineteenth-century. This work brought its author great popularity.\n\nIn 1924, a new and very popular novel, ´The Magic Mountain´, was published. In 1929, the writer was awarded The Nobel Prize for his work ´Buddenbrooks´.\n\nIn 1933, after the Nazi government came to power in Germany, Mann immigrated to Zurich, and two years later he moved to the United States and taught at Princeton University and published the novel \"Lotte in Weimar\" (1939).\n\nIn 1947, the novel ´Doctor Faustus´ was also published in America, but due to the unfavorable situation in the United States, Mann soon had to return to Switzerland again.\n\nIn 1949, the writer visited FRG and GDR. Among Mann's most famous works are the novels 'Joseph and His Brothers', 'The Sorrows of Young Werther', 'The Holy Sinner', 'The Black Swan' etc. He began working on the novel ´Confessions of Felix Krull´, which was remained incomplete due to Mann's death in August 1955."
