        "text": "Visit Lübeck, a city with only 220.000 inhabitants boasts three Nobel Prize Laureates. All three personalities are closely associated with the city. Their works and their labours can be experienced and traced in the three museums dedicated to them in Lübeck’s Old Town. The three establishments see themselves as places of lively engagement with the works of Lübeck’s Nobel Prize Laureates. Besides the permanent exhibitions, thematic shows, concerts and series of discussions invite visitors to experience and assess the work of these outstanding men of Lübeck in a new context. Find out more about the inspiring lives of Thomas Mann, Günter Grass and Willy Brandt.\n\nThomas Mann bequeathed his home town a literary monument in 1901 with his novel “Buddenbrooks: The Decline of a Family”. The proud patrician family of the Buddenbrooks who came to money and power through the grain trade, is almost entirely wiped out within the space of three generations. In 1929, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for his epoch-making novel. However, not all the people of Lübeck were happy with this work as some of the “similarities with living persons” turned out to be anything but flattering. In business circles, the young author was cursed as a traitor and distant relatives even took out ads in the newspaper in which they disowned him as a family member. Today, people in Lübeck are very proud of their Nobel Prize Laureate. The major significance of Thomas and Heinrich Mann and further representatives of the family can be seen in the fact that the historical Buddenbrook House is currently undergoing conversion and is being considerably extended. Until 2028, the interim exhibition, “Buddenbrooks in Behnhaus” is the new destination for fans of Thomas Mann from all around the world.\n\nBorn Ernst Karl Frahm, he became Willy Brandt – SPD politician, former Mayor of Berlin, German Chancellor, committed European who fought for reconciliation between East and West and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate. One image that is engraved in people’s collective memory all round the world is the memorable sight of Brandt kneeling at the Warsaw ghetto memorial 50 years ago. Brandt grew up as the son of working class parents in Lübeck’s St. Lorenz Süd district. He remained attached to the town of his birth throughout his life. In 1971, Willy Brandt was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his policy towards the East, and one year later he was made an honorary citizen of Lübeck. Excitingly staged with multimedia and interactive elements, Willy Brandt’s political life and the eventful history of Germany and Europe are brought to life in the Willy Brandt House where you can also learn more about the atmosphere in society and politics as well as the lifestyle in the Federal Republic of Germany in those days.\n\n“Thomas Mann, Gdansk and Willy Brandt“, that was Günter Grass’ reply to the question of why he settled near Lübeck in 1987. For him, the Hanseatic city was a kind of second home town, replacing Danzig, the town of his birth which he had to leave at the age of 17. The literary proximity to Thomas Mann and the Buddenbrook House inspired him, but above all, his attachment to his old friend and fellow traveller Willy Brandt was a significant reason behind his decision to opt for Lübeck. Günter Grass was a writer, graphic artist and sculptor rolled into one and in 1999 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for his life’s work. Go to Glockengießerstraße in Lübeck and visit the Günter Grass House! The museum has been a forum for literature and the fine arts since 2002. Immerse yourself in the artist’s creative process, his words and his imaginary worlds! Here, the artist's creative process and his worlds of words and images can be experienced from the most diverse perspectives. The detailed and lovingly designed colonial goods shop in the entrance is reminiscent of Grass's novel \"The Tin Drum\" as well as his parents' shop in Gdansk."
