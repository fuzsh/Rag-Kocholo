        "text": "The Bay Psalm Book\n\nThe decision to print a book of psalms metered for singing may seem an odd choice as the first book to be printed by the settlers of Massachusetts Bay, but this modest book served the larger purpose of the colonyâto live within the reformed church. The Bay Psalm Book, as it is known, is essentially sacred text to be sung during the liturgy. A committee of thirty learned elders, including John Cotton, Richard Mather, and John Eliot, set about the task of creating a new translation of the 150 Hebrew psalms into English and casting the text into verse for singing.\n\nPrinting the Bay Psalm Book in 1640 required importing the tools and materials of printing to the new colony. The Reverend Jose Glover put this into action when he resigned his post in Surrey, England, and set sail for the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1638 with his family, possessions, and a printing press operation, replete with paper and slightly worn type. Glover died aboard ship, and it was left to his widow Elizabeth to establish the press.\n\nElizabeth Glover eventually moved the printing operation to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and placed it under the charge of her husband’s apprentice, Stephen Daye (1594?–1668). Daye was a locksmith by trade; his press work and spelling were inconsistent. Two centuries later, American printer Isaiah Thomas would remark that the Bay Psalm Book “abounds with typographical errors. . . . This specimen of Daye’s printing does not exhibit the appearance of good workmanship.” It was, nevertheless, the first full venture of printing in British North America, and this ambitious effort is an important monument of the establishment of this nation and its culture. It is estimated that 1,700 copies of the book were printed, which sold for twenty pence. Today, only eleven copies survive.\n\nBack to top\n\nPrinting in Massachusetts\n\nStephen Daye stepped aside from the Cambridge Press in 1649 and his assistant English-born Samuel Green (ca. 1614–1702) assumed control until it ceased operation in 1692. Green was the first of a two-hundred-year run of family printers. His work exemplified the narrow range of publishing in seventeenth-century Massachusetts. With a purposeful selection of essays, sermons, and homilies, the press in this period served the church rather than the social and economic interests of a growing river city.\n\nTo produce the most significant publication of the Massachusetts colonial period, the Eliot Indian Bible, Green took on an assistant, Marmaduke Johnson (1614–1702), to manage the printing of 1,000 copies of the book, each more than 1,100 pages in length. Johnson went on to operate the first press in Boston in 1674 where he and others attempted to launch a newspaper. Despite several efforts of local printers, British North America did not have a successful, continually published newspaper until Bartholomew Green (1666–1732) printed the Boston News-Letter in 1704.\n\nAlthough printing eventually spread to other Massachusetts towns, it was carefully controlled by civil and church authorities. An open press implied the ability to question standing authority and to promote heresy. Because newspaper printing often sustained the finances of a press operation, many Massachusetts printers found government intervention intolerable and moved out of the colony in order to operate viable printing businesses. Philadelphia, in particular, emerged as the next major center of colonial printing in the eighteenth century, in part, because its size and diversity attracted a more varied and robust press.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Beginning of Printing in New York\n\nThe âPioneer Printer of the Middle Coloniesâ William Bradford (1663–1752) was born into a family of English printers. He apprenticed in London with printer Andrew Sowle and married Sowleâs daughter. Together the couple set off to Philadelphia in 1685 to begin life as a Quaker family. Bradfordâs training gave him a significant advantage over colonial printers who were less schooled in the craft of printing. He would become known for many âfirstsââthe first printer in Philadelphia, co-owner of the first paper mill in America, printer of the first American paper currency, printer of the first book in New York, and the printer of New Yorkâs first newspaper, the New-York Gazette. Like most early printers of the era, Bradfordâs business was sustained by printing almanacs, newspapers, and government reports.\n\nIn the first release from his press, the almanac for 1686 titled Kalendarium Pennsilvaniense, or Americaâs Messenger, Bradford wrote: âI have brought that great Art and Mystery of Printing into this part of America, believing it may be of great service to you in several respects.â Bradford soon stepped into controversy when Governor William Penn took umbrage at a reference to him in the almanac. A later pamphlet printing further inflamed the issue. In 1692 Bradford printed a broadside, An Appeal from the Twenty-eight Judges to the Spirit of Truth, written by an opposing Quaker, George Keith. The text was found seditious, and Bradford was tried and jailed for printing without identifying himself in the imprint. With his release, he accepted an offer from the Provincial Council to become the first printer in New York.\n\nBack to top\n\nSpread of Colonial Printing\n\nPrinting was very slow to spread throughout neighboring colonies after it was introduced in Massachusetts Bay. It was almost exclusively an urban activity, and only then in cities with sizable populations. In 1720, Boston, New London, New York, and Philadelphia were the only cities with print shops. Twenty years laterâa century after the Bay Psalm Book came to pressâprinting had spread to nine cities.\n\nThe harsh reality of the colonial economy was that larger book publications were more cheaply produced in England and shipped to the colonies. It was difficult for printers to stay afloat in the early period, and many printers sought out some form of âbread and butterâ printing to offset the costs of their more elaborate printing productions. These colonial printing staples included government forms and proclamations, religious pamphlets, sermons, primers, chapbooks, and posters. Newspapers would later be counted on as a source of revenue, but before 1720 many failed. After 1740, with the reduction in government and church oversight, the establishment of profitable newspapers, and the larger role printing played in broadcasting information, printing emerged as a powerful and viable business.\n\nBack to top\n\nYoung Franklin in Boston\n\nBorn in Boston, Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) was the fifteenth child and the tenth son of Josiah and Abiah Franklin. His father attempted to âtitheâ his son to the church in preparation for the clergy, but the expense was too great. Young Franklin was pulled out of school and, at age twelve, apprenticed to his older brother James, a printer.\n\nIn 1721 James Franklin published one of the earliest newspapers in America, The New-England Courant, the first to include literary pieces and essays in a newspaper format. The younger Franklin was drawn to the idea of appearing in print and submitted several failed efforts to make it into the pages of his brotherâs paper. Finally, at age sixteen, under the pen name of Silence Dogood, Benjamin Franklin developed a character whose commentary appealed to James, which resulted in the publication of fifteen of Mrs. Dogoodâs letters in the Courant.\n\nWhen James Franklin finally learned of the true authorship of the letters, his anger separated the brothers. Soon thereafter James was charged and imprisoned for âscandalous libelâ for controversial content in his paper. Benjamin left Boston and settled in Philadelphia. When the Courant was suppressed in 1727, James and Ann Franklin moved to Rhode Island and established that colonyâs first press that same year in Newport.\n\nBack to top\n\nFranklin as Colonial Printer\n\nArriving in Philadelphia empty-handed, Benjamin Franklin found work with printer Samuel Keimer. After several false starts with businesses and a near-fatal bout with pleurisy, he traveled to London in 1724 to carry out business that never transpired. Unable to afford a return trip on his own, Franklin spent the next year and a half working as a printer. As it had for William Bradford, training in the English craft of printing bolstered his skills and design aesthetic. By the time Franklin retired in 1748, he had established the largest printing business in colonial America and was considered its most accomplished printer.\n\nFor many, Franklinâs fame as a writer and printer rests on Poor Richardâs Almanack, which is recognized for Franklinâs homespun wit and wisdom, under the pseudonym Richard Saunders. But Franklinâs accomplishments as a printer were far greater. He built his business on the profitable formats of printing at the timeâjob printing, government forms and currency, almanacs, pamphlets, and newspapers. He rescued a Philadelphia newspaper from bankruptcy and in 1729 rebuilt it as the Pennsylvania Gazette (later published as the Saturday Evening Post), the most successful colonial American newspaper. He was the first printer to propose a monthly magazine.\n\nAlthough Franklin would go on to distinguish himself as a scientist, diplomat, politician, and writer, his success was built on the foundation of his work as a printer. It brought him wealth as well as a public platform.\n\nBack to top\n\nMarch to Declaration\n\nAfter the British Parliament passed the Sugar Act (1764) and the Stamp Act (1765), many colonists sought means to break from the tyranny of British rule and expand individual rights. The dramatic political and social shift played out in the pamphlet wars that fueled the American Revolution and shaped the early republic. Pamphlet literature informed the political conversation, and it is estimated that more than 1,500 titles were published between 1763 and 1783.\n\nPopular pamphlets such as James Otisâs Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved (1764), John Dickinsonâs Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania (1767), and Common Sense (1776) by Thomas Paine exerted tremendous influence. Easily printed and distributed, pamphlets played a dramatic role in fomenting and spreading rebellion. Many went through multiple editions; others were republished in their entirety in newspapers. Patriots created loosely organized circulating societies as a means to gather, read, and forward important publications.\n\nAt the core of the printed arguments were the notions of the right to self-government and the value of a republic over a monarchy. Thomas Jeffersonâs 1774 A Summary View of Rights of British America declared clearly that because of the kingâs tyrannical rule, the contract with the colonies had been broken. Thomas Paine soon followed with his pamphlet that stated the American people, by their own virtue, were entitled to their own republic. The revolution in American thought, captured in print, was underway; and the rebellion was soon to follow.\n\nBack to top\n\nDeclaration of Independence\n\nIt is fitting that the means by which the colonies declared their separation from British rule was that of a one-page printed broadside. In fact much of the American Revolution was reported through pamphlets, posters, and newspapers. When actions demanded rapid distribution, the colonies turned to the power of the press to further the revolutionary cause.\n\nBefore putting independence to the vote, the Committee of Five (John Adams, Roger Sherman, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston, and Thomas Jefferson) was formed to draft a statement. Thomas Jefferson was chosen to write the declaration. Between June 11 and June 28, 1776, Jefferson penned the rough draft of the Declaration of Independence, which firmly stated it was just and right that the colonies separate themselves from a rule that had so violated their contract.\n\nOn July 4, 1776, a draft of the Declaration, with key changes by Franklin, Adams, and the Continental Congress, was delivered to John Dunlap (1747–1812), owner of a print shop located near the Philadelphia State House. That night it is estimated that 200 copies of the âDunlap Broadsideâ were printed for distribution to members of Congress, to commanders of the Continental Armies, and to King George of England. News spread quickly through the colonies; twenty-nine newspapers printed the text of the Declaration of Independence and colonial presses printed nineteen additional broadside editions.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Federalist\n\nNow considered to be one of the most significant American contributions to political thought, the Federalist Papers, eighty-five essays that supported the ratification of the new U.S. Constitution, first appeared in New York newspapers in 1787 under the pseudonym âPublius.â From the moment the U.S. Constitution appeared as a document under consideration, it had been the target of attack. Alexander Hamilton responded in Federalist No. 1 that the authors would âendeavor to give a satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their appearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.â Although it was widely known that the essays were the work of Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, the authors maintained their anonymity to promote discussion of the substance of the essays.\n\nEven as these essays on central themes of federalism were still appearing in newspapers, there was significant demand for their publication in book form. The New York publishing firm J. and A. McLean released the first thirty-six essays in volume one in March 1788. Volume two completed the series and included eight additional essays when published in May of that year. While The Federalist had an impact on New Yorkâs vote for the Constitution, it had a less direct impact on the immediate issue nationwide. Several states had already voted for ratification before the book was released. By the time New York put the Constitution to vote, ten states had already ratified the document, one more than what was needed for ratification.\n\nBack to top\n\nPost-Colonial Printing\n\nAmerican printing came into its own at the end of the eighteenth century. By then most materials needed for book production could be obtained locally; it was no longer necessary to turn to Europe for paper, ink, type, or presses. In the centuryâs last decade, 13,000 titles were published in America. Many of these were the familiar almanac, pamphlet, or religious texts, but textbooks, spellers, arithmetics, and primers were also among that number.\n\nBy the time Isaiah Thomas (1749–1831), patriot printer and founder of the American Antiquarian Society, wrote History of Printing in America in 1810, 360 newspapers, including more than 20 dailies, were in print in the United Statesâmore than in the entire circulation of Great Britain. Books published in the U.S. were still relatively expensive compared to their British counterparts. Full-length texts were uncommon, especially belle lettres or fine literature. Although moralistic works, such as Francis Baconâs Essays or John Bunyanâs Pilgrimâs Progress, were colonial blockbusters and religious texts still dominated the market, there is evidence that thousands of people were reading short stories, novels, and childrenâs books. With the onset of mechanized printing only a few years away, America would soon be awash in the printed page."
