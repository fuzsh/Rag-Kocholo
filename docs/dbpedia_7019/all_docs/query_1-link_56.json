        "text": "PRIMARY SOURCE: Autobiography, 1791\n\nShare this story\n\n×\n\nPrimary Source\n\nFrom The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, which waspublished in French in Paris a year after Franklin's death in 1790; the first English edition appeared in London in 1793.\n\nI was the youngest Son and the youngest Child but two, and was born in Boston, N. England…My elder brothers were all put to Apprentices to different Trades. I was put to Grammar School at Eight Years of Age, my Father intending to devote me as the Tithe of his Sons to the Service of the Church…\n\nAt Ten Years old, I was taken home to assist my Father in his Business, which was that of a Tallow Chandler and Sope-Boiler. A Business he was not bred to, but had assumed on his Arrival in New England and on finding his Dying Trade would not maintain his Family, being in little Request. Accordingly I was employed in cutting Wick for the Candles, filling the Dipping Mold, and the Molds for cast Candles, attending the Shop, going for Errands, etc. I dislik'd the trade and had a strong Inclination for the Sea; but my Father declar'd against it; however, living near the Water, I was much in and about it, learnt early to swim well, and to manage Boats, and when in a Boat or Canoe with other Boys I was commonly allow'd to govern, especially in any case of Difficulty; and upon other Occasions I was generally a leader among the Boys, and sometimes led them into Scrapes, of which I will mention one instance, as it shows an early projecting public Spirit, tho' not then justly conducted.\n\nThere was a Salt Marsh that bounded part of the Mill Pond, on the Edge of Which at Highwater, we us'd to stand to fish for Minews. By much Trampling, we had made it a mere Quagmire. My Propsal was to build a Wharf there fit for is to stand upon, and I show'd my Comrades a large Heap of Stones which were intended for a new House near the Marsh, and which would very well suit our Purpose. Accordingly in the Evening when the Workmen were gone, I assembled a Number of my Playfellows, and working diligently like so many Emmets (ants) sometimes two or three to a Stone, we brought them all away and built our little Wharf. The next Morning the Workmen were surpris'd at missing the Stones; which were found in our Wharff; Enquiry was made after the Removers; we were discover'd and complain'd of; several of us were corrected by our Fathers; and tho' I pleaded the Usefulness of the Work, mine convinc'd me that nothing was useful which was not honest.\n\nThe Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, 2nd edition (Yale University Press, 1964).\n\nOn this day in 1722, the Boston paper The Courant first published a letter from a widow with a keen wit and a gift for satire. Every few weeks, another letter from \"Silence Dogood\" appeared. The city was captivated by the lady's willingness to poke fun at institutions as illustrious as Harvard. After six months, \"Silence Dogood\" fell silent. Even James Franklin, The Courant's publisher, did not know who she was or what had become of her. When her identity was revealed, Boston was amused but James Franklin was not. \"Silence Dogood\" was his 16-year-old brother Benjamin, an apprentice in his print shop. The brothers parted ways, and Benjamin Franklin left his native city for Philadelphia, which now claims him as its own.\n\nThe Courant's publisher, did not know who Mrs. Silence Dogood was or what had become of her.\n\nAsk most Americans and they will tell you that Philadelphia was Benjamin Franklin's hometown. But the famous printer, writer, statesmen, and inventor was actually a Boston boy. By the time he was sixteen, he was already well-known as the young man who had introduced Boston readers to an entertaining middle-aged widow, \"Mrs. Silence Dogood.\"\n\nFranklin was born in 1706 in a little house on Milk Street just across from the Old South Church. He was the fifteenth child of Josiah Franklin, a candle and soap maker, and his wife Abiah. When Ben was six, the family moved to a slightly larger dwelling at the corner of Union and Hanover Streets. Young Ben Franklin explored the streets, mill ponds, and wharves of the colonial city, getting into various forms of mischief and picking up an education along the way.\n\nHe was eight when his father decided that, as the tenth son, Ben should be a tithe to the church and enrolled the boy in a grammar school to begin preparation for the ministry. Ben was a quick study and soon moved to the head of his class. But after a year, his father reconsidered, deciding that it was too expensive to educate a minister given the small salary clergymen earned. He withdrew his son from school and put him to work in his shop. From then on, Ben Franklin educated himself, whenever he could find time, from books that he bought, borrowed, or came across in his work.\n\n\"Being still a Boy, and suspecting that my Brother would object to printing any Thing of mine in his Paper if he knew it to be mine, I contriv'd to disguise my Hand, & writing an anonymous Paper I put it in at Night under the Door of the Printing House.\"\n\nAfter several years in his father's shop, he was restless and \"Hankering for the Sea.\" Fearing the boy would run away and recognizing how much his son loved books, the elder Franklin apprenticed Benjamin to one of his older sons, the printer James Franklin. The 12-year-old boy went to work setting type for books — and reading them. He would often \"borrow\" a bookseller's book, stay up much of the night reading it, and then return it \"early in the Morning lest it should be miss'd or wanted.\"\n\nWhen Benjamin was about fourteen, his brother began publishing The New England Courant, \"only the second newspaper to appear in America.\" After composing the Types & printing the Sheets, [Ben Franklin] was employed to carry the Papers thro' the Streets to the Customers,\" as he wrote in his Autobiography.\n\nJames Franklin often printed pieces written by his friends, and Ben desperately wanted to see his own work in the paper. When he was sixteen, he devised a plan. \"Being still a Boy, and suspecting that my Brother would object to printing any Thing of mine in his Paper if he knew it to be mine, I contriv'd to disguise my Hand, & writing an anonymous Paper I put it in at Night under the Door of the Printing House. It was found in the Morning & communicated to his Writing Friends when they call'd.\" The men read it, and Ben Franklin had \"the exquisite Pleasure\" of listening as they praised it.\n\nIn her own dignified way, \"Silence Dogood\" managed to mock Boston manners and mores.\n\nJames's friends were not likely to have guessed the identity of the author, for that piece and fifteen more \"letters\" that followed over the next six months were written in the voice of a woman — a widow with a charming, witty, and satirical style and the name \"Mrs. Silence Dogood.\"\n\nThe letters were a delight. In her own dignified way, \"Silence Dogood\" managed to mock Boston manners and mores. She lampooned Harvard College, suggesting that the only thing its students really learned was how to be conceited. She commented on Boston's drinking habits, the absurdity of certain fashions — and, with delicious irony — Bostonians' tendency to reserve judgment on an opinion until they knew who had expressed it. She was free with her advice, particularly on the way women should be treated.\n\n\"Silence Dogood\" completely charmed Boston. In a city where the old-school Puritan elite rarely sanctioned public criticism of one's betters, the letters were acceptable as social satire. When the widow coyly suggested that she would welcome suitors, several men wrote to the paper with offers of marriage.\n\n\"If any Person . . . will give a true Account of Mrs. Silence Dogood, whether Dead or alive, Married or unmarried, in Town or Country, . . . they shall have Thanks for their Pains.\"\n\nAfter six months, \"Silence Dogood's\" letters stopped; readers were distraught. One wrote to The Courant that the paper had \"lost a very valuable Correspondent, and the Public been depriv'd of many profitable Amusements.\"\n\nOn December 3, 1722, James Franklin ran an ad in his paper: \"If any Person . . . will give a true Account of Mrs. Silence Dogood, whether Dead or alive, Married or unmarried, in Town or Country, . . . they shall have Thanks for their Pains.\" Only then did Benjamin Franklin reveal the widow's identity to his brother and to Boston.\n\nJames Franklin was one of the few townspeople who was not amused. Ill feeling and rivalry between the brothers caused Benjamin to break the terms of his apprenticeship and leave Boston for Philadelphia. Within a few years, he had set up his own press and was publishing the Pennsylvania Gazette. It would be in Philadelphia, not his native Boston, that Benjamin Franklin would become the most famous American of his time.\n\nIf You Go\n\nBoston By Foot offers the walking tour “Ben Franklin: Son of Boston”\n\nLocation\n\nThis Mass Moment occurred in the Greater Boston region of Massachusetts.\n\nSources\n\nThe First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin, by H.W.
