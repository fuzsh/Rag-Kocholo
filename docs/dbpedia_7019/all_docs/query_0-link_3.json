        "text": "Last Updated: 1 Feb 2017\n\nThe Famous Ben Franklin\n\nSo, You're Related?\n\nFirst, you will want to review several of the Top Ten Genealogy Mistakes to Avoid:\n\nMistake #3: We're Related To... Someone Famous Mistake #6: Accepting Family Legends Without Question\n\nIt appears that every Franklin family has a tradition/fable/tall tale that they are somehow related to Ben Franklin. If your family has a tradition that says you are not related the to the famous statesman, please let me know.\n\nIf your surname is Franklin and you have a family tradition that you are descended from The Famous Benjamin Franklin, this is a fable. The reason for this is simple. Ben Franklin had one son who lived to maturity. That son had one son. He (i.e. Ben Franklin's grandson) had no sons.\n\nSo - you think you're related through his brother John?\n\nSorry, no.\n\nQuoting from an article in FFRU Volume 51:\n\nWill of John Franklin of Suffolk County, Massachusetts\n\nBy Ben Franklin, Editor. This John Franklin is the brother of the famous Statesman. Note that many, many persons who claim to be related to the statesman make the claim through this John Franklin. Unfortunately for such claims, John Franklin leaves his estate to his nephews, nieces, stepsons, sisters, etc., with no mention of children or grandchildren, and thus it seems that there were none, or at least none who were alive when his will was written. Note also that just two days after the original will was written, he added a codicil. One of the most common false connections through John Franklin is the Surry County, North Carolina line, described and thoroughly debunked in FFRU Volume 6. John Franklin was born 7 Dec 1690 in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, son of Josiah Franklin and Abiah Folger. He was a soapmaker and tallow chandler by trade (as was Josiah Franklin, his father), and was appointed deputy postmaster of Boston by his famous brother. He died 30 Jan 1756 in Boston, Massachusetts. The New England Historic and Genealogical Register, Vol. 11, Jan 1857, pages 18-19 states: 8. John Franklin, born 7 Dec 1690; died Jan 1756; Married ______ Gooch; had but one son John, lost at sea, a young man grown There are numerous words found in this will whose meanings have changed radically in the intervening centuries. A prime example is the term son-in-law which was used in a more literal and generic way than it is now, thus it meant any son whose relationship was legal rather than by dependency, thus what we now call a step-son would be a son-in-law. This relationship designation was common for those times. The son-in-law Thomas Hubbart mentioned in this will, was actually a step-son, the son of Johns wife, Elizabeth (Gooch) (Hubbart) Franklin. The daughters-in-law were the wives of his step-sons. This will was written 22 Jan 1756, probated 6 Feb 1756. In the Name of God Amen.
