        "text": "Introduction\n\nBenjamin Franklin (b. 1706–d. 1790) was born and raised in colonial Boston, Massachusetts, in the waning years of Puritan hegemony. He was apprenticed to his brother James, a printer. The precocious apprentice’s first publication was a broadside ballad on the capture of Blackbeard, but his first lasting literary creation, the character of a Puritan widow turned author named Silence Dogood, appeared in a series of letters surreptitiously submitted to his brother’s newspaper, The New England Courant, in 1722. After several fallings out with his brother, Franklin slipped away to Philadelphia in 1723. In late 1724, he took his first transatlantic trip (out of eight during his lifetime), and he spent most of the next two years learning the printing trade in London. In 1728, Franklin began operating a successful printing business and publishing The Pennsylvania Gazette. From 1733 to 1758 he wrote and published Poor Richard’s Almanack, significant for its hundreds of popular maxims and the creation of Richard Saunders, its fictional author. For the preface to the 1758 edition, Franklin compiled many of the maxims concerned with making and saving money in a humorous and lightly satirical piece that was later titled “The Way to Wealth,” and it became one of the two most widely read of his literary productions. After retiring from day-to-day operations of his printing business in 1748, Franklin spent much of the next three years performing and publishing his Experiments and Observations on electricity in 1751. His contributions earned him recognition by the Royal Society in England and garnered for him an international reputation as a natural philosopher. Active as well in Pennsylvania politics, he was selected in 1757 to represent the colony in England during its dispute with proprietor Thomas Penn. Aside from a brief return to Philadelphia from 1762 to 1764, he remained in England until the eve of the Revolution, eventually representing several colonies and serving as de facto ambassador from British North America. For two weeks in July and August 1771 he wrote the first of four installments of his memoirs, which would be composed over the next nineteen years and be published posthumously as his Autobiography. Franklin returned to Pennsylvania on the eve of the Revolution in the spring of 1775, and he was elected to the Continental Congress. He was selected by Congress to act as emissary to King Louis XVI largely because of his international celebrity, and he acted in that capacity from his base in Passy, France, beginning in early 1777. After concluding the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, he completed the second portion of his memoirs. He completed the two other extant sections of his memoirs between his return to Philadelphia in 1785 and his death in 1790."
