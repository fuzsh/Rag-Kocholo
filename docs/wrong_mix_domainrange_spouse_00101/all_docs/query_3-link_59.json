        "text": "Michael Landes ( Lois & Clark: S1 ) as Det. Nick O'Malley\n\nAlexondra Lee as Det. Kate Benson\n\nRichard Gant ( V ) as Capt. Richard Page\n\nDanny Woodburn ( ) as Carl the Gnome\n\nSean Whalen as Sean Radmon\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 1, Episode 0] Pilot\n\nShown Unaired Pilot\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 1, Episode 1] The Brothers\n\nShown 11 Apr 01\n\nChicago cop (and probable part-time model) Kate ( Alexondra Lee ) gets seconded to a secret plainclothes unit named SU2. Her new partner is O'Malley (Michael Landes - Lois & Clark: S1 ), a pretty-boy with a Dirty Harry attitude. Their mission - to solve crimes committed by supernatural creatures called Links.\n\nA Flying gargoyle is attacking people. Sort of like Q: The Winged Serpent .\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 1, Episode 2] The Pack\n\nShown 18 Apr 01\n\nYuppie werewolves are on the rampage. Cameron Bancroft ( Codename: Eternity ) is the main suspect.\n\nO'Malley (Michael Landes - Lois & Clark: S1 ) gets infected (yes, as if doing their job is not enough, the cops need a personal motive fo solving the case) and goes undercover.\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 1, Episode 3] The Wraps\n\nShown 25 Apr 01\n\nA Mummy rises from its sarcophagus. Dominic Keating ( Star Trek: Enterprise ) guest-stars.\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 1, Episode 4] The Web\n\nShown 2 May 01\n\nThe team hunt a Black widow.\n\nO'Malley (Michael Landes - Lois & Clark: S1 ) protects a young woman who looks like Erica Eleniak .\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 1, Episode 5] The Waste\n\nShown 9 May 01\n\nA plastic surgeon is killed by a monster made out of liposuction fat. The team try to trap it, but it is smarter than they are. After all, it retains the skills of all the people whose fat make it up. And its super-fast metabolism means it must consume all the lipo fat in the city. Then it goes after the fat that is still inside people.\n\nThe first detective on the scene is O'Malley's ex-partner. The guy is angry at having the case taken from him. He is super-competitive, and wants to solve it before O'Malley (Michael Landes - Lois & Clark: S1 ) does. Therefore he will get in the way ...\n\nThis was written by Joel Surnow, creator of 24. As a police procedural it works, unlike most Sci-Fi thriller shows.\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 1, Episode 6] The Depths\n\nShown 16 May 01\n\nWe have another Sexy Victims Unit ep. After the last on a couple of weeks ago, this time the monster attacks females instead of males. Virgins, in fact. Tom Welling ( Smallville ) is a victim's boyfriend.\n\nCarl the Gnome (Danny Woodburn) is in chains after messing with the Chief. Kate Benson ( Alexondra Lee ) has problems of her own - her younger sister is in town, and enjoys dressing like a streetwalker.\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 2, Episode 1] The Grain\n\nShown 3 Oct 01\n\nA parasitic Link called The Sandman can jump from body to body when people are asleep, acting out their repressed urges.\n\nKate the Babe Cop ( Alexondra Lee ) gets infected, and becomes sexually liberated to her new BF. She wears a skimpy skintight outfit, showing off her great cleavage and legs.\n\nThe Unit has a new PR officer ( Pauley Perrette ). She is glamourous, the opposite of Abby in NCIS.\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 2, Episode 2] The Skin\n\nShown 10 Oct 01\n\nA shapeshifter is murdering people. His MO matches that of The Chameleon (Mark Sheppard - Supernatural ), a paticularly brutal link who killed O'Malley's last partner ( Tsianina Joelson ).\n\nThe Chameleon has been in a holding cell for years, so we get the typical Silence of the Lambs storyline.\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 2, Episode 3] The Years\n\nShown 17 Oct 01\n\nA male model is found drained of his youth, dead of old age at the age of 19. SU2 deduces that the Link responsible is a witch who can keep herself young by sucking the life-energy out of her victims. There is an obvious suspect - the victim's female employer ( Lola Glaudini ). She starts toying with the detectives like Catherine Trammel in Basic Instinct.\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 2, Episode 4] The Invisible\n\nShown 24 Oct 01\n\nThe team hunt The Boogeyman. He is a monster that is invisible to adults, but can be seen by children. Unfortunately an innocent man is in jail for one of the Boogeyman's kills.\n\nAmy Acker was originally cast as a sexy babysitter, but the part was either re-cast or cut.\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 2, Episode 5] The Eve\n\nShown 31 Oct 01\n\nIt is Hallowe'en, and Four killers are raised from their graves in the convict graveyard. The brains of the operation is the King of the Links (John DeLancie - Star Trek: TNG ), who uses his new henchmen to hold the Chicago Museum to ransom. Not unlike Lois & Clark [Season 2, Episode 7] That Old Gang Of Mine , though the villain in that one used clones as henchmen instead of zombies.\n\nThe team try to outsmart the villain. But it turns out he was involved in the death of O'Malley's previous partner, two years ago. Yes, the villain has had two years to plan this caper. No wonder he is always a few steps ahead of them.\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 2, Episode 6] The Rocks\n\nShown 7 Nov 01\n\nKate the Babe Cop ( Alexondra Lee ) dates her college BF (Sebastian Spence - First Wave ).\n\nTwin babes are picking up lonely men in singles bars. Unfortunately they are Gorgons. One note - to turn their victims to stone they use their hair-snakes' venom, not their gaze. This is actually an improvement on the original myth.\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 2, Episode 7] The Drag\n\nShown 14 Nov 01\n\nIn the 1870s a Native American tribe conducted a human sacrifice to appease a dragon. They must have avoided being charged with murder. Of course, since the dragon probably caused the Great Chicago Fire ...\n\nSome grave-robbers messed with the grave site. The team track the stolen grave goods to a Playboy Mansion place, where the Hefner type is HRG from Heroes .\n\nCarl the gnome is targeted by the dragon. Can he slay it before it gets him?\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 2, Episode 8] The Beast\n\nShown 21 Nov 01\n\nSomeone murders a dancer on her way home from the strip-club she works at. The too-obvious suspect is an over-enthusiastic fan of hers, although she could also have been attacked by a robber who wants to steal the massive wad of money she earned on her shift.\n\nSU2 investigate, and discover the blame is an Ogre - not a friendly one like Shrek . Apparently he was also responsible for the Jack the Ripper killings. However, Jonathan the CSI dude states that the DNA is inconsistent.\n\nCarl the comedy-relief gnome has an online girlfriend. Kate the Babe Cop ( Alexondra Lee ) also has a love interest - the Police Detective originally assigned to the case.\n\nPotential suspects include a pair of lapdancing twins. They are carrion-eaters, but they do not look like the Pach-Marrah in Babylon 5 . One of them always lies, and the other only tells the truth. Kate ( Alexondra Lee ) must have seen Labyrinth , because she knows the way to work out which one is which. Then Kate goes undercover as a streetwalker to act as bait to find the killer.\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 2, Episode 9] The Wall\n\nShown 28 Nov 01\n\nKate ( Alexondra Lee ) goes to her High School reunion. Unfortunately there are Monsters in the walls. It turns out she discovered this at the Graduation ceremony, and as a result her former classmates all think she is crazy. It is not the first time that a character's personal subplot has overlapped with the main freak of the week, but it is shocking that a main character's personal backstory happens to be so pivotal!\n\nMeanwhile, the Boss goes for a vacation in his isolated country shack. Carl the Gnome tags along too, as an unexpected guest.\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 2, Episode 10] The Straw\n\nShown 16 Jan 02\n\nA couple of workmen excavate an old coffin. Inside it is a reptilian-looking scarecrow. It does not kill its victims, just scares them and feeds off their fear. Which means it can take advantage of modern horror film tropes. Cheerleaders having a slumber party are an easy target.\n\nO'Malley (Michael Landes - Lois & Clark: S1 ) was caught giving a troll a punishment beating. He has to attend anger management sessions. Will the therapy help him face his own fears, to overcome the fear demon?\n\nSpecial Unit 2 [Season 2, Episode 13] The Wish\n\nShown 13 Feb 02\n\nThe villain of the week is a Genie. An evil Genie, that is. She makes wishes come true by committing crimes and letting the wisher take the fall for them. And she is three wishes away from 3000, which will give her free will so she can use her magicks for her own selfish reasons.\n\nMeanwhile, O'Malley (Michael Landes - Lois & Clark: S1 ) is having a good time with his new GF ( Cobie Smulders ). But as always, the character's private life is dragged into the main plot. The Genie makes the GF jealous, and acts like a Vengeance Demon to go after the hero. Ironic, this ep has the same title as the Vengeance Demon's first ep in Buffy."
