A year has passed since her first marriage ended. Kay was quiet throughout her divorce and decided to write about her feelings in her debut album, All I've Ever Known, which came out in 2023.\n\nWho is Alexandra Kay's ex-husband?\n\nAlexandra married her longtime boyfriend, Indiana Touchette, an American union laborer, on 25 September 2021, after dating for over ten years.\n\nIndiana Touchette and Alexandra Kay's relationship history\n\nTouchette and Kay are from neighboring small towns (Waterloo and Millstadt, respectively) in Southern Illinois. The two reportedly met in high school but went on their first official date in 2012 after high school.\n\nSinger Alexandra said:\n\nI remember exactly what he was wearing. He pulled up, and his car was super clean. We went to the movies, and I made fun of him for eating cookies.\n\nThe two moved in together after just three months. Touchette said:\n\nIt was a learning curve, both of our first time out of the house — we were 18, 19 years old. I worked days, then she would bartend.\n\nAt that time, Alexandra had turned down college scholarships to pursue her music career and was performing in musical theater productions. She even tried her luck as an American Idol contestant in 2011.\n\nKay and Indiana called it quits just six months after moving in together but subsequently realized they were a perfect fit. During their separation, which lasted about a year, she wrote a song, Somewhere Near Indiana, about the breakup and her love for Touchette.\n\nThe singer landed a record deal with Network Entertainment in 2013 at age 21. At 22, she rose to stardom by making cover videos of '90s hit tunes for her Facebook fans.\n\nKay's fame skyrocketed while they were still together when she dropped her debut single, No More (2016). Indiana proposed around Christmas time in 2019 and married her in September 2021 at A Pocketful of Sunshine in Mt. Vernon, Illinois.\n\nTouchette's brother-in-law, Tim Hastey, officiated the wedding, and Kay wrote a song, From September to Forever, for the event. Nonetheless, she decided not to perform it at the wedding and sang it privately for her new husband.\n\nAlexandra released many popular tracks while married to Touchette, including her debut EP, Dive Bar Dreamer (2021), and her first radio hit, Backroad Therapy (2022).\n\nWhen did Alexandra Kay get divorced?\n\nSources indicate that Indiana Touchette and Alexandra Kay divorced on 27 October 2022. News about their divorce emerged in January 2023 after the American singer tweeted:\n\nI hadn't slowed down for long enough to realize I was pouring myself into someone who was never filling me back up.\n\nAlexandra Kay's wedding ring has since been taken off, and she does not post about her husband on her social media handles as before.\n\nAfter releasing her debut album, All I've Ever Known, in October 2023, the singer admitted to Music Mayhem:\n\nEverything that I say in this music is truth. The process of actually writing the music and opening up was the easiest part of it all, because I just told my story.\n\nAlexandra started writing songs at 13 because it was the only way to express her feelings. So, composing the 11 tracks for the album helped her heal. She said:\n\n\"All I’ve Ever Known\" is that initial experience of me kind of laying in bed in my new apartment… Every house that I’ve ever bought was to fit his needs. Every place we’ve ever lived was to fit him, and so \"All I’ve Ever Known\" is that realization of coming into my own\n\nAlexandra also said in the interview:\n\nThen you have \"Kiss Me Goodnight,\"which is hearing about someone in your life moving on and being like, \"How could you do this so fast?\" and then \"Painted Him Perfect\" is really what kicks off the entire album, and that’s the letter to my fans.\n\nShe concluded:\n\nI wrote through every different new emotion and new experience I’ve experienced over the last year and a half, and then we just created eleven songs out of it.\n\nWho is Alexandra Kay's dating?\n\nOn 15 February 2024, the country music star posted pictures of her fun moments with singer Rick Beal on Valentine's and tagged his IG page in the caption. Kay wrote:\n\nOh how rare it is, to find someone like you. ❤️ Happy Valentine’s Day, sugar. You make me the happiest girl in the world. @rockobeall.\n\nWho is Rocko Beall?\n\nAnthony \"Rocko\" Beall is an American guitarist, songwriter, producer, and music teacher at Music Staff Studio.\n\nWhere is Rocko Beall from?\n\nCountry singer Alexandra Kay's boyfriend is from Orange County, California, but currently lives and works in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nA glimpse into Rocko Beall's career\n\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, Anthony \"Rocko\" Beall began his career with the \"Hero For Today\" pop/punk group. Recording and producing several albums with the band in Tommy Lee's Atrium Studio in Calabasas, California, gave him valuable production and business experience.\n\nFrom there, Rocko was licensed to use his original song, Superman, in the Crowning Jules film. After releasing two EP's and several live performances throughout California, Beall switched from band to solo artist.\n\nAnthony attended the Musicians Institute in Los Angeles, California, where he received the Independent Artist Scholarship. He also studied production and songwriting with LA's top industry professionals.\n\nAfterward, Beall graduated from Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, with a degree in Commercial Music: Guitar (with a Songwriting Emphasis).\n\nDrawing inspiration from classic and contemporary artists, Rocko writes upbeat melodies that evoke strong feelings, and more people are starting to appreciate his artwork in the United States.\n\nIs Alexandra Kay married?\n\nThe country music singer has been divorced for over a year. She is currently dating American guitarist/singer Anthony \"Rocko\" Beall.\n\nFacts about Alexandra Kay's ex-husband, Indiana Touchette\n\nIndiana Touchette's nickname is Indy.\n\nHe is about a year younger than Alexandra.\n\nThey met in high school through friends.\n\nTouchette inspired numerous songs Alexandra Kay composed.\n\nKay documented their relationship’s highs and lows through her songs.\n\nIt has been confirmed that Indiana Touchette is no longer singer Alexandra Kay's husband.
