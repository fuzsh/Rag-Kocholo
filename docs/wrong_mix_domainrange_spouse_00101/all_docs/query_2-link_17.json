General email address: mail@austinchronicle.com Postmarks forum: austinchronicle.com/forums/postmarks Mailing address: The Austin Chronicle, PO Box 49066, Austin, TX 78765 RECA SUPPORTED PROP. 15 Dear Editor, Regarding last week’s, “Then There’s This: Campaign Cash” [Nov. 23], the Chronicle wrote, “It bears repeating over and over again, though, that the city still faces a critical affordable hous- ing problem (the homebuilders’ political action committee and the Real Estate Council of Austin were curiously absent from the housing bond cam- paign’s list of donors).” The Real Estate Council of Austin did indeed support Proposition 15. While RECA’s Business M/PAC did not contrib- ute to the specific HousingWorks Action PAC, it did make a $15,000 contribution to Unity PAC (as noted in the article), which promoted passage of all of the bonds, including Proposition 15. In addition to the cash contribution, RECA staff and volunteers actively worked for the Unity PAC’s Love Austin campaign supporting all of the bonds, including those for affordable housing. While we may have been “curiously absent” from the HousingWorks Action PAC, we were never absent from actively campaigning for the passage of Proposition 15. Do count us in as disappointed that Proposition 15 did not pass on Election Day. Nancy McDonald , Director of Regional Outreach DISAPPOINTED BY ‘PI' REVIEW Dear Editor, I was surprised and disappointed by Marjorie Baumgarten’s superficial review of Life of Pi in the Nov. 23 Film Listings section. It is hard to imagine that Ms. Baumgarten took the time to understand the book by Yann Martel on which the film is based, given that she seemed to completely miss the allegory which sits at the heart of this novel. Perhaps my 13-year-old son should explain it to her; last year he wrote an eighth-grade English paper on the book. When Ms. Baumgarten has won the Man Booker Prize - the British equivalent of the National Book Award - she might be in more of a position to use phrases such as “fuzzy theological concerns” in regards to the story. Without these “fuzzy theological concerns,” the central tension of the story - expressed in every- thing from the lead character’s name (Pi) to the interplay of the physicality of the natural world ver- sus its wonder and magic - is totally lost. Perhaps Mr. Martel’s central thesis, that science and religion are important but different narrative traditions which can both be valuable in different ways in helping someone understand the world, is beneath her consideration. One is left wondering if perhaps Ms. Baumgarten is simply uncomfortable discussing or considering God or religion in any context that does not want to use it as a punch line. Ang Lee had a difficult task in taking this extraordinary novel and adapting it to film. There \"PAGE TWO” IS TAKING A BREAK. are decisions regarding the narrative flow of the film - the decision to concentrate more on Pi’s family than his religious instructors would be one example - with which one could take issue. However, Ms. Baumgarten does not seem up to that task. I can imagine her review of The Old Man and the Sea would criticize the 1958 movie for not simply concentrating on the excellent fishing yarn. Jim Rife TWO THINGS Dear Editor, Thing one: What?\\ Austin Water needs more money to complete Water Treatment Plant No. 4 [Headlines, News, Nov. 23]? Who would ever have thunk that? Thing two: Re: “Point Austin: We Want Your Urine” [News, Nov. 23]: Rick Perry has been on the public dole a good bit of his adult life. So when does he get drug tested as a condition of continuing to receive his public assistance? David Venhuizen ‘BEST OF' TOO ELITIST Dear Editor, I’ve gone through the “Best of Austin” [Nov. 9] issue twice now, and I’ve come away just wishing maybe you could put down the mustache curling wax and charcuterie paddle, and throw a bone to those of us who don’t buy our jeans two sizes too small on purpose? For example, actual useful information for Joe F. Blow? You know, like Best Burger? Best Pizza? Best Indian Buffet? Best Sushi? That kinda thing? When my friends and I are arguing viciously about where to eat, do you think I’m inclined to nasally announce that, thanks to the Chronicle, I know of this divine trailer that serves Senegalese peanut butter soup between 11 and 11:15am on Tuesdays and Thursdays? By all means, keep the hipsters happy with a gazillion categories about where to get the best $9 cup of Momotaro Artisan Tea or double-decker bicycle handle-tassles, but there are people over the age of 24 who occasionally venture outside their own assholes in this town, and sometimes they just wanna know where to get a good steak. Love , Matt Ford [“Best of Austin ” Editor Kate X Messer replies: For the record , despite Mr. Blow’s ... I mean , Mr. Ford’s thorough two go-throughs of our “Best of Austin’’ issue , there are no categories for “$9 cup of Momotaro Artisan Tea ” nor “double-decker bicycle handle-tassles.” And in addition to a slew of Readers Poll and Critics Picks winners that we believe Mr. Ford might actually enjoy there is also an annual Restaurant Poll published by the paper each spring to cover the essentials he feels are missing from the “BOA” ranks (i.e., Best Burger and Best Sushi).] CHEAPO KEPT ME SANE Dear Editor, It’s kinda sad something I knew since I moved here has died [“Cheapo Records to Close,” Earache!

Aaron Blair GOOD LOGIC O’CONNELL Dear Editor, So when is this Joe O’Connell going to write another article about UTSA football [“UTSA Looms As Texas State’s New Rival,” the Score Sports blog, Nov. 21]? I’m dying to know what he says now. Probably just more reasoning that makes no sense. A guy putting so much faith in a Texas State team that has - at least had - a team for how long? And only winning three games this season? Yeah, good logic, Joe! You should be fired. Apparently you never took the time to watch past footage of the Roadrunners. Also this line from the article: “[T]he Bobcats are likely to bitch-slap them”? Not classy at all\\ Eric Guajardo THANK YOU, AUSTIN Dear Editor, My husband and I have just returned to England from a two-week trip to Austin. Our love of music has often tempted us to come over for the South by Southwest Festival in March, but the even bigger love of Formula One motor racing was the clincher to finally visit Texas for the first time. The brand-new track is beautiful and the most perfect one from a viewer’s point (and prob- ably from a driver’s point). There were problems with parking facilities and lack of sufficient food choices/outlets, but all these are easily solvable for the next event [“Fans Declare FI a Success,” News, Nov. 23]. We have been to many tracks around the world, and all provide free parking within walking distance to the track, in addition to free shuttle services from parking areas if they’re a little too far to walk. Please rethink the parking costs. One area of disappointment in a country known for its fairness in most things was the disproportionate increase in hotel accommoda- tion costs for the Grand Prix weekend. This may be a deterrent to some people for future visits. Nonetheless, our praise goes out to the city and people of Austin, who we found to be the most gen- uinely friendly, welcoming, and accommodating to such a huge crowd of visitors. You handled it well, and all those doubters should now be convinced that you do indeed have something to be proud of and something to tempt first-time visitors to return to see more. We’ll certainly be back for the music next time, more motor racing in the future, and more exploration of the fantastic state of Texas. Once again, a very big thank you, Austin.

The corrupt process of appointing designated associates by county commissioners - comprising persons with already voiced inter- ests in either building roads or being involved in development - who then sit down and decide for the rest of the citizens (and landowners) of this county what should happen to their lives is undemocratic, blatantly contemptible, and should not be tolerated. Most people know little or nothing about these new proposed roads, and there has been no public interest in building more roads. Instead, it is a top-down bogus process of hand- ing over public tax money to private entities in the form of road contracts and eventual housing and commercial development. Our lands and our lifestyle must not be for sale, nor open to controlled special interest decisions about where increased vehicular traf- fic, overpopulation, and additional air and noise pollution should be directed and how. Local news media, along with community resi- dents, must rise up together as a giant tsunami of protest. We recognize that the county is grow- ing and that we must make improvements to our roads, but not this way. Peter Stern WON’T LET THE COMMUNITY DOWN Dear Editor, I’d like to take this opportunity to thank you all for the “Best of Austin” Best Way To Lay a Loved One to Rest [Nov. 9]. We won’t let you, our families, or the community down, at least until you tell us. I have great news! Solace has found its own home in which to serve the community. We will be located at 1508 W. Koenig, and our phone num- ber remains the same (517-0937). Our doors have not opened, but we are working hard to be up and running by the week of Dec. 3. Our vision is to bring funeral service into the 21st century, keeping it sacred and community supported by partnering with other local small busi- nesses - that is, local churches, event centers, limo services, etc. By keeping our overhead low, we can pass the savings on to grieving families, as well as offer sustainable alternatives to traditional funeral services (should the family choose). As you know, as a community we are uniquely Austin. We are a full-service funeral home and commu- nity resource center for approaching end-of-life issues - and we offer affordable caskets from “Green Casket King” with free local delivery.

About Those Numbers Headlines > City Council doesn’t meet this week, but a weighty agenda is set for Dec. 6, with a public hearing on whether to give an economic incen- tive deal to Visa Inc. (see “Point Austin,” below), and a council vote on whether to pour more money into WTP4. See “Next Week’s Council: It’s a Porker,” p.20, and “Then There’s This,” p.16. y Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott announced Wednesday that the state wants to seize the nearly 1,700 acres bought in 2003 by the Mormon-breakaway sect the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, alleging the property was purchased to hide the group’s polygamist practices involving underage girls. See “State Seeks to Seize FLDS Compound,” Newsdesk, Nov. 28. y A court of inquiry intended to determine whether current Williamson County District Judge Ken Anderson knowingly withheld exculpatory evi- dence from Michael Morton’s defense that could have spared him wrongful conviction and nearly a quarter century behind bars has been postponed until Feb. 4 and is expected to last a week. y Gov. Rick Perry this week tapped his chief of staff, Jeffrey Boyd, to serve on the Texas Supreme Court, replacing Justice Dale Wain- wright, who resigned with two years left to serve in his term in order to return to private practice. Boyd’s appointment is effective Dec. 3; he’ll be replaced by Employee Retirement System of Texas Executive Director Ann Bishop. y Perry also called on his liaison on border and Mexico affairs, John Steen, to become secre- tary of state, replacing Hope Andrade. Questions for Visa A few queries before providing corporate welfare Beginning with Wednesday’s staff brief- ing, City Council is considering whether to donate $1.56 million (over the next 10 years) to Visa Inc. The “economic development grant,” of course, is not exactly charity. Under the terms of the proposed agreement (a vote is expected next week), in return for the city’s annual grant, “Visa is proposing to establish a Global IT Center creating at least 794 jobs [and retain 47 existing jobs] over the next five years, with average salary [and] wages across all posi- tions of $113, 3 51a year.” Those kinds of jobs (and local economic genera- tors) are nothing to sniff at, and the city estimates (based only on direct costs ^ and benefits) a net $6.8 million benefit to Austin. Although the company site is not specified (an exist- ing facility to be renovated), it is said to be located within the city’s “desired develop- ment zone” (i.e., not over the aquifer), and that the company recruits a diverse work- force with “commercially reasonable” local hiring and would adhere to the city’s minor- ity business contracting programs. As is common with these deals, Austin is expected to genuflect to what has already been negotiated under Gov Rick Perry’s Texas Enterprise Rind. (The TEF supports “free enterprise” by donating taxpayer money to businesses considering Texas location or expansion; it’s called an “enterprise” fund, presumably, because “state socialism” might give people the wrong idea.) The Governor’s Office announced the state’s ante as $7.9 mil- lion, “contingent upon finalization of local incentives.” That is, should Austin balk and the company walk its jobs elsewhere, city leaders would take the blame for not feeding the corporate gift-horse additional oats. According to Perry, “the TEF has invest- ed more than $472 million and closed the deal on projects generating more than 63,900 new jobs and more than $22.6 billion in capital investment in the state.” As you might guess, there is much less to the TEF than meets the gubernatorial press release. The indispensable watchdogs at Texans for Public Justice have been review- ing TEF grants since the program’s 2003 inception and have concluded that the gov- ernor’s numbers are - to put it politely - baloney. Perry’s 63,900 number apparently includes every job promised over the nine program years; in late 2011 he was claiming about 60,000, of which TPJ reported (“Con Job,” Nov. 2011), “Putting aside five TEF projects that make fraudulent job claims and a sixth project that appears to be undergo- ing an audit, TPJ found evidence that TEF had created 22,349 jobs by the end of 2010. That number amounts to 37 percent of the job claims made by the Governor’s Office.” continued on p.16 y Starting Nov. 29, city of Austin curbside recy- cling customers can start adding more recycla- bles to their bins: aluminum baking tins, trays, and pie plates (clean of food residue), plus clean balls of aluminum foil 2 inches or larger. y It’s a new battle of the Alamo as the Daughters of the Republic of Texas take aim at Attorney General Greg Abbott after he issued a scathing report on how they run Texas’ most famous his- torical monument. Abbott alleged financial mis- management and that they allowed the Alamo to fall into disrepair; the Daughters claim he ignores changes made since 2010. > As the post-election reality sets in, some high- ranking Republicans are scurrying away from Americans for Tax Reform founder Grover Norquist and his budget-destroying Taxpayer Protection Pledge, which he and his Tea Party- loving secret donors have used to force the GOP to the right for almost three decades. “We shouldn’t be playing games.

A Austin, Tx 78701 Ph: 800.690.9463 austinchronicle.com NOVEMBER 30, 2012 the Austin chronicle 15 ■ J I POINT AUSTIN continued from p.14 Of the 65 projects TPJ reviewed, it found that only 17 (26%) complied with their job commitments; 24 (37%) failed to deliver on their original 2010 job promises, 11 (17%) were terminated prematurely, seven (11%) are “troubled” (usually by defaults on job pledges), five (8%, including most of TEF’s largest grants) fraudulently claimed more jobs than they actually created, and one project claimed “new” jobs with hiring dates predating its TEF contract. That’s not to say nobody in Texas has benefited from TEF largesse. TPJ sepa- rately found that “43 companies that land- ed a total of $333 million in TEF awards contributed almost $7 million to Perry’s campaign and the Perry-affiliated Repub- lican Governors Association [which in turn contributed to Perry’s campaigns]. ... The 43 TEF recipients that contributed to Perry and/or the RGA represent about half of the 90 companies that received TEF awards but received 76% of all TEF-awarded funds” (“Perry’s Piggybank,” Oct. 2011). Rude Questions Austin’s not so near full employment that we can afford to turn our nose up at new jobs. The state’s money is already pledged, and Austin’s relatively small 10-year commitment is subject to city review and transparency that the state pro- gram (with projects subject to the approval only of the governor, lieutenant governor, and speaker) doesn’t even contemplate. But before we fall in line, we should feel free to ask a few more questions. It’s unlikely, for example, that Perry and David Dewhurst - who recently and heartily endorsed drug tests for “welfare” and unemployment insurance recipients (“We Want Your Urine,” Nov. 23) - asked Visa Inc. Chairman Joseph Saunders or CEO Charles Scharf to provide urine samples before they receive their TEF checks. Perhaps we could add that requirement to the city’s Chapter 380 matrix, to protect ourselves (and Visa’s stockholders) from corporate decisions made under the influence. Visa was also among the corporate pay- masters who succumbed to U.S. govern- ment pressure to block payments to WikiLeaks - although the organization is not charged with any crime and is guilty only of journalistic embarrassment of U.S. and other officials. Might we not ask, does Visa presume the constitutional authority to decide which media are or are not worthy of financial transactions - or does it just leave those decisions to Sen. Joe Lieberman? Finally, and more simply: Why does a $10 billion company like Visa need to play one state against another, one community against another, all in order to extort tribute in the form of public funding that would better go to education or health care? Visa’s “corporate responsibility” standards explic- itly emphasize “local giving.” Why take away the public money in the first place? ■ The proposed Visa economic development agree- ment is available at www.austintexas.gov/department/ economic-growth.

Water for Sale WTP4 HAS TO PAY FOR ITSELF, BY HOOK OR BY CROOK If you’re among the “small but vocal minor- ity” of people who questioned the wisdom of building Water Treatment Plant No. 4, you must be feeling somewhat vindicated by now, what with the latest financial revelations. Next week, Dec. 6, offers yet another opportunity to tell the City Council how the albatross known as WTP4 is economically and environmentally flawed, and how it will continue to drive up rates and force the city to sell more water in order to pay off the debt. An item on that day’s agenda calls for consideration of the Austin Water Utility’s request for an additional $15.5 million to finance WTP4’s completion so the plant can be up and running in 2014. Council has seen this pro- posed budget adjustment coming for many weeks, but a city auditor’s report released Nov. 19 solidified the utility’s warning signals and clarified some other fine-print details. (See “WTP4: Running on Overruns?,” Oct. 19.) Construction of the plant, the city’s biggest public works project in decades, was given the green light in 2009 on a narrow 4-3 vote. The project was billed by the business community as a much-need- ed jobs booster at a time when the economy was down and construction materials were cheap. Even though one of the four “yes” votes has been replaced by an ally of WTP4 opponents, don’t expect a council majority to outright reject staff’s request for more money. The project is too far along to back out now, the argument goes, so council has little choice but to approve the requested funding for the three remaining construction contracts. (The same too-far-along argument was applied last year when a new council majority toyed with the idea of temporarily halting construction.) As critics see it, “throwing good money after bad” will bring the project’s cost-overrun tally to nearly $60 million; this includes the $44 million that was shaved off over the summer to bring costs closer to the $359 million mark that council set (again on a nar- row 4-3 vote) in November 2010 as part of a “construction cost limitation” agreement with MWH Constructors Inc., the council- approved manager at-risk firm hired to over- see the contracts. Now we’re told, and the auditor’s report verifies, that the “structure of the agree- ment” of that $359 million did not guarantee a firm cap. At the time, however, key staff members - in their hurry-hurry rush to ink a deal - assured council that the blank-check approval would simply pro- vide some wiggle room in the event of unexpected costs. Most of the council members - along with the rest of us - seem to remember that the $359 mil- lion was supposed to be the stopping point. Staff made the case that with funding in hand and a construction manager at-risk on board, the contract packages could be negotiated and awarded quickly and efficiently, without coun- cil having to review each package individually. Which is another way of saying they didn’t want the public to see where and how the $359 million was being spent. DON’T ASK, DON’T TELL “One of the disturbing things for me is that when I voted for this [$359 million], I thought that was the number,” said Mayor Pro Sheryl Cole at the Nov. 19 meeting of council’s Audit and Finance Committee, where the WTP4 overruns were front and center. The four council members on the committee - Cole, Laura Morrison, Bill Spelman, and Kathie Tovo - all expressed surprise that what they had believed to be a spending cap in 2010 had just been an estimate all along. Staff neglected to mention that in its original pitch for approval. “Because we didn’t ask you that explicit question, you and other city staff who were present at the [2010] meeting did not give us that answer,” Spelman told Austin Water Director Greg Meszaros. Spelman said he had even gone back and reviewed a video of the meeting to make sure he hadn’t glossed over a key piece of information. Morrison said there were lessons to be learned from the overruns and called for greater transparency and scrutiny of future high-dollar projects. She was among the three who voted against the blank-check deal, arguing that the council, and the public for that matter, should be able to review the contracts before they were awarded. She pointed out that nine of the 11 contract pack- ages have gone well over their so-called guar- anteed maximum prices. “That sounds like a pretty bad guesstimate record,” she said. In a statement later, she added, “All along, the contract sounded too good to be true and now we’re finding out that it was.” Cole, for her part, seemed mystified by how a major omission in a financial agree- ment managed to escape council’s radar for two years. To be fair, the words “construction cost limitation” do carry a ring of a spending cap, and staff should have told them up front that the amount they were asking for was only an estimate. But then, that would have just raised more questions and postpone- ments, and hey, we need jobs, don’t we? Opponents warned that while the project itself should never have been approved, handing over a $359 million check to build the thing would cast an even greater shroud of secrecy within the utility department. They were right. Chamber-of-Commerce-driven boondoggles seldom prove skeptics wrong. ■ CIVICS 101 THURSDAY 29 SATURDAY 01 MONDAY 03 PEDALING FOR SAFER ROADS The recent deaths and serious injuries of cyclists due to drunk drivers have incited fellow bikers to send a message to city officials and Austin at large with a ride from City Hall to the Capitol. 7pm.

Hours after the Chronicle hit stands last Wednesday morning, the city of Austin issued a press release revealing that on Oct. 31, it had sent a cease-and-desist letter to the company’s CEO, Joshua Huck. The letter advised Huck that “Heyride very closely resembles ... a taxi franchise, and that any operation dis- patching drivers to potential passengers on-demand requires a City Council approved Franchise Agreement, and that all drivers are required to successfully satisfy criminal back- ground and driving history checks as per Austin City Code.” Heyride does perform criminal background checks, as the article mentions, though when I registered for the ser- vice as a driver, I didn’t have to pass one for my driving history. While the cease-and-desist letter wasn’t publicized until the press release was issued Nov. 21, part of the conversation between Huck and the Chronicle did include a discussion of the legal and permitting issues involving the service and its drivers. When asked if the company had a lawyer who told them why they didn’t need permits, Huck responded: “It’s new technology, and we currently exist in this grey area. You can say, ‘Is it illegal for me to get in your car and give you five bucks for taking me to the grocery store?’ How illegal is that? Are you a ground transporta- tion service now? Are you my chauffeur, or are we still friends? Or are we both?” Those are fine theoretical questions (it would have also been a fine time for Huck, who was interviewed on Nov. 9, to mention receiving the Oct. 31 cease-and-desist letter), but that sort of abstraction may not get Heyride off the hook: “He’s operating a franchise,” says Karla Villalon, public information manager at the Austin Transportation Department. “If you look at his revenue model, he takes a cut on every transaction, so I don’t know that it’s a friendly exchange anymore. That type of service is regulated by the city.” (Other unconventional transit operators, including pedicabs and electric cabs, have also bumped up against city regs in recent years.) The city had requested a meeting with Huck to discuss Heyride, which he had scheduled and then canceled. (He’s since reached out to the Transportation Department to reschedule.) “There were some internal discussions before we opened that conduit up,” he explained after the city of Austin issued its press release about the cease-and-desist letter. “We had to consult within our organization to make sure that we presented ourselves accurately to the city, so the city has the correct view of what we do.” One group that Huck may not have presented Heyride’ s status accurately to, however, is its drivers. It’s understand- able that, as he sought to publicize his company, he might choose to decline to inform the Chronicle about the fact that the city had challenged its legality. It’s less understandable that he kept this from the people who provide the service that makes Heyride work - especially since those people face potential criminal liabili- ties for offering rides. The press release reads, “Should those associated with Heyride proceed with providing unlicensed for-hire services in Austin, citations will be issued to those observed operating without a permit/ operating authority, which is a Class C mis- demeanor,” and Villalon clarified that this does refer to both “the drivers and the fran- chise operator.” Huck, for his part, is unconcerned about this. “I don’t know how they’d enforce it,” he says. “To me, that sounds like they’re trying to strike fear into the heart of people who are giving rides to each other.” While it’s reasonable to question if it would be a good use of city resources to, say, have police request rides on the Heyride app, and then ticket the driver who shows up, it’s also reasonable to expect that this possibility is something that the company probably ought to have shared with its users once the city notified them. The question of Heyride’ s legality isn’t settled by the fact that the city issued a cease-and-desist letter to the company, and Huck is almost certainly right when he says that this business model is something that the city will need to learn to work with. “We may be the first, but we’re not going to be “If I were the city, I’d love to work with a local business trying to do something positive here, instead of threatening them with fines.” - Heyride CEO Josh Huck UT students protest the Bhopal gas tragedy, where in 1984, 27 tons of lethal gas leaked from a Union Carbide (now Dow Chemical) pesticide factory in Bhopal, India. To date, 25,000 have died. This year's protest will be held on the 28th anniversary of the tragedy, Dec. 3, from 11am to 2pm, on the West Mall on the UT campus. the last,” he said. “If I were the city, I’d love to work with a local business trying to do something positive here, instead of threatening them with fines.” That would certainly be in the best interest of Heyride and - if the safety questions (which extend beyond back- ground checks into driving history, vehicle safety, and insurance) can be properly addressed - probably in the best interest of the people who need another option for getting around Austin. One group who might take issue with it, though, are the taxi companies. Taxi permits are tightly regulated, and the Taxi Drivers Association of Austin was incensed after a new round of 45 additional permits were issued over the summer, which cost individual cab drivers revenue. And Huck believes they may have also pressured the city to pursue legal options against Heyride. That may be the position of someone looking for an excuse as to why the company he’s spent months building is suddenly under legal fire, but it may be true, as well - for evidence, he points to tweets that the company has received from an Austin cabbie (@41grapeape) that included a photo of a copy of the cease-and-desist letter, sent on Nov. 13. Villalon isn’t aware of how the cab driver received a copy of the letter before the press did, though she notes that it is in the public record. The driver himself didn’t respond to questions within the narrow time window for this story. No matter what ends up happening with Heyride, the city of Austin, and the cab drivers who may or may not be out to shut the service down, one thing remains clear: The newness of the business model utilized by companies like this, as well as their user-to-user nature, means that the law and regulators are going to need to figure out a way to deal with them soon - and the old approaches are probably not going to be sufficient for companies that operate in so many gray areas. - Dan Solomon 18 the Austin chronicle NOVEMBER 30, 2012 austinchronicle.com SECONAL™ ASHLEY FURNITURE $1099 bl FA & LOVE SEAT $699 BICAST FUTON $179 6 PIECE QUEEN LOUIS PHILLIPE BEDROOM SET $799 BRING THIS AD AND GET A FREE NIGHTSTAND (WHILE SUPPLIES LAST - LIMITED TIME ONLY) 7 PIECE QUEEN SIZE BEDROOM SET $799 SECTIONAL WITH OTTOMAN $499 FAUX MARBLE COUNTER HEIGHT TABLE WITH 4 STOOLS RED SOFA AND LOVE SEAT $399 o OVERSIZED 7 PIECE RUSTIC BEDROOM SET $269 TWIN SIZE CAPTAIN’S BED QUEEN SIZE PLATFORM BED CAPPUCCINO FINISH $199 $1399 ALL WOOD BUNKBED FRAME SERTAVISCO MEMORY — FOAM MATTRESS SET r $459 REAL MARBLE v 7 PIECE DINETTE SET $999 ESPRESSO 5 PIECE DINETTE SET ALL MATTRESS SETS HALF OFF QUEEN SIZE EURO TOP MATTRESS SET * $289 ASHLEY MICROFIBER RECLINER islet' $199 NO CREDIT CHECK ALL OFFERS WHILE SUPPLIES LAST approval up to $3000 DISCOUNT FURNITURE MUEBLERIAALEX 6801 N.

Some of the headliners and eye-catchers include: • A public hearing on a proposed $1.56 mil- lion “economic development grant” for Visa Inc. in exchange for building a global IT cen- ter here. See “Point Austin,” p.14, and “Victories for Living Wages,” p.22. • Action on Austin Water Utility’s request for an additional $15.5 million to finish out construction on the troublesome Water Treatment plant No. 4. See “Then There’s This,” p.16. • A resolution for the city to participate in the Texas Facilities Commission’s plans to unload prime state property in Central and North Central Austin for private development. Considering the Facilities Commission is run by former Austin state Rep. Terry Keel, a Republican who helped facilitate plenty of Austin-bashing bills in his day, it’s no wonder the city and several neighborhood groups are just a little interested in what gets built where and how. • A public hearing and possible action on the creation of the East Riverside Corridor zoning district, east of 1-35, where a redevel- opment transformation process is already making the low-rent street look, well, differ- ent. Several other East Riverside matters are also on the agenda, including the return of a controversial proposal to rename Arena Drive as Shore District Drive “for purpos- es of neighborhood enhancement,” otherwise known as marketing. • A rather convoluted zoning/development issue in the 5500 block of North Lamar, regarding property owned by the Texas State Troopers Association. Developers are seeking upzoning to allow a 385-unit apartment complex and possible mixed-use. Neighborhoods in the area have weighed in with traffic and other access concerns, as has AISD because of the site’s proximity to McCallum High School. • And for those South Austinites who’ve been asking when Wheatsville Food Co-op will open its second location on South Lamar, the case is currently tied up in city code issues involving its sale of alcoholic beverag- es in close proximity to a public school. A public hearing is tentatively set for Dec. 13. Mark the date on your holiday calendar and come on down. - Amy Smith FLOYD’S® The OtynJ! ROCKA ROLL BARBERSHOP' LAMAR 4200 N.

Tuesday morning, the Travis County Commissioners Court finally signed off on its brand-new eco- nomic development incentives policy, one that will include an $ll/hour wage floor for program participants and the construction workers who build their facilities. That after- noon, a subcommittee of the Austin City Council proposed similar changes to the city of Austin’s development incentives criteria. Despite the clear trend here, none of this comes without all kinds of hand-wringing from contractors, the Austin Chamber of Com- merce, and Mayor Lee Leffingwell. For con- tractors, the worry centers around (predict- ably) the impact of increased wages on their respective bottom lines. On the other hand, the chamber and Leffingwell worry that such changes will implode the city’s very robust economic development program (see: Apple, U.S. Farathane, and HID Global, to name a handful of recent cases). Workers advocacy organizations - particu- larly the Workers Defense Project, which gets a gold star for pushing hard on the issue over the past year - say the relative financial impact of higher construction wages on a project is minimal. Development- minded folks aren’t so sure. They say that even the 1% increase suggested by WDP would amount, using HID Global construction as a marker, to $300,000. Not pennies, that number. As part of his slate of sug- gestions, Council Member Mike Martinez offered a bone to contractors. He called for the creation of a collateral pool that he hopes will help offset the pain for subcontractors trying to make wages while waiting for a check from the prime contrac- tor. The pool, Martinez told online In Fact Daily, will proba- bly be funded by the city. None of this was enough for Leffingwell, who pictured trouble if it’s all passed by the full council. The mayor tried to offer an amendment that would make the wage floor an option for companies looking for bonus incentives, not part of the core set of requirements for receiving public funding. His suggestion did not get a second. This sets up a vote at council where Martinez, Morrison, and Tovo will need just The Workers Defense Project rallied at City Hall on Sept. 12. one more of their colleagues to sign off on the new requirements. We know it won’t come from the mayor. That leaves the trio of Mayor Pro Tern Sheryl Cole and Council Members Chris Riley and Bill Spelman - at least one of whom is likely to get on board. Meanwhile, regarding what is likely a more far-reaching action, Leffingwell and Martinez opposed a policy proposal that would require city staff to brief council members on pro- posed incentive deals before, rather than after, negotiating them. - Mike Kanin MORE VOLVO MORE VALUE 2013 VOLVO S60T5FWD VOIiVO PER MONTH ' 2.9 WE+SECIRECOVEUEEPIM 5 72 mo.

Now the University of Texas branch of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers is apolo- gizing for printing T-shirts that clearly mimic the tribute. Barrera, 29, was murdered in her West Campus home on Jan. 1 (James Loren Brown, whom APD described as the prime suspect in her slaying, committed suicide a month later). She was a teaching assistant at Casis Elementary and, through her work as a volunteer with Girls Rock Camp and an employee at Waterloo Records, had become a mainstay of Austin’s live music scene (see “Excited About Life,” Jan. 13). The For Esme logo became a way for her many friends in Austin and her hometown of El Paso to commemorate her: friends such as John Walker, who wears the logo as a tattoo on his arm. On November 20, he was in Torchy’s Tacos on Slaughter Lane when he saw students wearing what he thought were For Esme shirts. Walker said he approached the students and asked, “‘Hey guys, are you all friends of Esme’s?’ They looked a little perplexed.” Looking closer, he saw the design had been altered to read “Hooked on ASME,” and the students explained that they were part of the UT engineering group. Walker spread the distressing news via Facebook, and soon ASME came under pressure. Walker explained: “There wasn’t an organized effort. I think everyone is so emotionally entrenched in the whole Esme thing that they acted naturally, and started calling and writing.” While ASME was ini- tially defensive, Walker said that “within 24 hours we had full apologies from the head of engineering, the head of the organiza- tion, and someone from the board of regents wrote me back.” Since the uproar began, ASME is trying to make amends. In a statement, ASME President Katie Leahy wrote: “We made a mistake. We are sorry for any sad- ness we caused friends of Esme Barrera and we have learned from our mistake.” She explained that the group ran a contest, and received three submissions, including the winning design by graduate research assistant Jared Garrison. They ordered 550 shirts to be handed out to new members at the begin- ning of the school year. The group has prom- ised to destroy the 90 shirts still on its shelves, and Leahy is also asking members to return the 460 that were distributed. “We were not fully aware,” she said, “of the mean- ing and purpose of the Esme logo which the winning logo looked so similar to.” The Esme design clearly predates the ASME logo. A few days after Barrera’s death, local graphic artist Charlie Chauvin was contacted by his brother, who had worked with Barrera at Casis. His brother asked him to design a symbol that would memorialize her life, and he put the design online on Jan. 5. ASME announced Garri- son’s design via their Eacebook page on July 16 - six months after Chauvin released For Esme. Chauvin’s design, with its thumb straight out and two fingers up, evokes the American Sign Language sign for “I love you” (something that Chauvin said on his blog at the time was a happy coincidence). With the thumb folded in, Garrison’s design looks more like the familiar “rock on” and “hook ’em horns” signs. However, the simi- Charlie Chauvin’s original For Esme design (I) and the UT student group’s redone version (r) larities - the font, using the vowels to make the raised fingers, the staggered position- ing of the s and the m - dramatically out- weigh the differences. In an email, Chauvin called the ASME shirt “inappropriate and insensitive. I am not okay with any deriva- tive of the original design as there are too many visual similarities.” For Chauvin and Walker, the issue is not about copyright infringement, but rather about respecting Barrera’s memory and the meaning of the design. When he first saw Chauvin’s design, Walker said: “It was the first time I saw anyone giggle or laugh at anything in the couple of weeks since Esme was murdered.” Garrison and UT mechanical engineering departmental chair Jayathi Murthy have both written to Chauvin to apologize for the misappropriation of his design. Chauvin said, “I appreciate that [ASME has] been sensitive to the matter and took immediate action to resolve the problem. There are so many people that hold Esme Barrera close to their hearts in this community, and it would be an injustice to dismantle something that has so much meaning to so many people.” - Richard Whittaker THE HIGHTOWER REPORT Sr,',',\"., Fixing American Airlines a us ti d j«ad stofe FRANZETTI masterJJ^^ ieweler BRILLIANCE YOU DESERVE® \\j / ^ .

Having plunged the corporation into bankrupt- cy last year, the geniuses in American’s executive suite decided that the way to fix the airline’s financial mess and restore public confidence in its service was to force more cuts on the employees who provide the services. Thus, in February, it was decreed that maintenance crews in Fort Worth and Tulsa would be slashed, and more than a third of their jobs would be outsourced. Tom Horton, American’s genius-in-chief, blithely declared that airplanes “can be maintained in Asia or Latin America ... anywhere.” True - but not necessarily we//-maintained. In September, when the seats started com- ing loose, the brass callously drove company morale further down by implying that Ameri- can’s maintenance crews, who are members of the Transport Workers Union, were the culprits. But TWU fired right back, pointing out that maintenance of two lines of 757s, including seats, had been outsourced to a non-union, low-wage corpora- tion where employees don’t get expert union training or regular on-site reviews by fed- eral safety inspectors. As a frequent flier on Ameri- can, I have a personal interest in this fight. I want CEO Horton to come to his senses and recognize that he can’t climb out of bankruptcy by step- ping on the line employees he has to count on to make the flying experience pleasant and safe.

Chances are you will never meet Patient No. 1, but you’re deeply invest- ed in Patient No. 1. In calendar year 2010, Patient No. 1 absorbed $75,407.41 worth of emergency medical care, and you paid for it. Patient No. 1 does not have a home, let alone any sort of insurance coverage. Instead, Patient No. 1 depends on care from local emergency rooms or, every once in a while, the county jail. Patient No. 1 is a poster patient, and a metaphor twice over - the wandering personification of a national problem, and the living, breathing argu- ment for its solution. So what is Austin to do with Patient No. 1 - and, for that matter, with the portion of the homeless population that isn’t Patient No. 1: the single moms who live in cars, the gentrification-ousted renters, the whole tragic mess of homelessness? To get at it, Austin could well turn to exist- ing, successful models for inspiration. The city of Miami designed a solution that includes a business-community-backed (i.e., well-funded), comprehensive approach that offers a significant portion of the city’s home- less population real ways to get off the street. Since its 1993 inception, the effort there has reduced the city’s homeless population from 8,000 to just 1,000 “street” homeless. Three Austin City Council members, high-ranking city administration officials, and a host of advocates from such organizations as the Downtown Austin Alliance and Foundation Communities have been to Miami to see the solution up close. Some version of this pro- gram could find its way to Central Texas. Closer to home, San Antonio officials built a sprawling, 15-building, 37-acre cam- pus that surrounds transitioning homeless with a variety of on-site services. Austin policymakers say the city doesn’t have the space to provide a San Antonio-style cam- pus, and besides, it might be seen as a seg- regationist solution. Yet, the San Antonio method serves nearly 1,000 down-on-their- luck citizens and sleeps up to 500 a night. By comparison, the Austin Resource Center for the Homeless sleeps only 100. None of this is to say that there aren’t substantial efforts in Austin to help Patient No. 1. Indeed, the city has more than a fist- ful of existing advocacy and outreach orga- nizations already doing the hard work. But there is no overarching plan - a funny situ- ation for a town so devoted to planning. Worse, when the city went to its own voters on Nov. 6 for $78.3 million in bond funds to support affordable housing in the region - a key portion of any comprehensive approach to the homelessness issue - the voters declined. It was a significant, and some- what surprising, blow. The election has thereby complicated the obvious question: What’s next? The Miami Model According to the website of a private part- ner in Miami/Dade County’s program, the Florida version of the story reads like a Dickensian rich-man-makes-good fantasy, \"In Austin, the government sector is taking a primary role in trying to address the issue. But we do not want to do that alone, and we do not think we can do that alone.\" - Mayor Pro Tern Sheryl Cole complete with a bit of deus ex machina pro- vided by a court order. The story starts with a quote from Alvah Chapman, a former pub- lisher of The Miami Herald : “In 1991, when I left my Knight-Ridder office and drove south, I was appalled by the sea of human- ity that was living under the expressways in conditions that would have been a disgrace to a third world nation.” Chapman, according to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, pushed Florida’s then-Gov. Lawton Chiles to create the Governor’s Commission on the Homeless in 1992, and to appoint Chapman to it. The Sun-Sentinel - a competitor of Chapman’s Herald - says that the effort was “jolted” into place by an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit accusing Miami-Dade of “a pattern of unconstitutional treatment of the home- less.” Obviously, the program needed fund- ing - and by 1993, Florida jurisdictions were granted the authority to impose a 1% food and beverage tax and direct a significant portion to homelessness-combating pro- grams. Miami-Dade would be the only region in the state to take the opportunity. Miami-Dade began to see an impressive turnaround in its homeless population. By 1997, even the Sun-Sentinel had called the progress “striking.” In 1998, the program was recognized as a national best practice. The Miami model found success - at least in the Chapman program - in a comprehen- sive approach that offers the region’s home- less sleeping accommodations at facilities that also boast social and medical services and offer meals and job training, as well as mental health support. The plan includes a strong outreach pro- gram - nicknamed the Green Shirt effort, for the color of the tops worn by its workers - that aims to get homeless Miamians quickly off the street. The Green Shirts carry a list of available services and the abil- ity to immediately direct individuals to the appropriate place. Some observers argue that Miami’s num- bers, especially the initial 8,000 estimate, aren’t quite accurate, but no one questions the visible success of the Chapman effort. Still, it’s not quite fair to compare Miami to Austin. Even if Austin had a comprehensive outreach program like Miami’s, the city still wouldn’t have enough empty beds, caseworkers, or housing to answer the need. Ann Howard, executive director of the Ending Community Homelessness Coalition, says, “The Chapman Center, which does a great job, is not a shelter for folks with mental illness. They are at a dif- ferent shelter in Miami. . . . They’ve culled out who’s going to the Chapman.” She continues: “It’s not the right com- parison if we’re worried about what’s going on Downtown in Austin, Texas.” San Antonio’s Campus The beginning of San Antonio’s program reads a lot like Chapman’s call to power. According to the private nonprofit Haven for Hope’s website, local “business and civic leader” Bill Greehey - chairman of NuStar Energy - saw a documentary on San Anto- nio’s homeless population in 2005.

It’s not the right comparison if we’re worried about what's going on Downtown in Austin, Texas.” - ECHO Executive Director Ann Howard years later, Greehey, in partnership with local politicos, opened a massive campus that Haven for Hope claims is “the largest, most comprehensive Homeless Transfor- mation Campus” in the United States. In addition to beds, the facility contains treat- ment options for addiction and mental ill- ness, job training, and chapel services. According to a January 2012 report pre- pared by the facility, “The Haven for Hope campus increases the effectiveness of 78 nonprofit service providers [40 housed on- site], who are now able to collaborate.” Haven for Hope is a centralized facility, something that critics might dismiss as a ghetto of poverty separated from the rest of the city. It’s still a bit early to evaluate Haven’s success, but its approach seems persuasive. “Studies show that up to 80% of people who become homeless can quickly regain self-sufficiency if they receive sup- portive services such as those found at Haven for Hope,” continues the 2012 report. “Following best practices based on thor- ough research on homelessness and sub- stance abuse, the campus provides holistic treatment by combining: Housing, Food, Health, Job/Employment, Education, Finan- cial, Social Support Services, Case Man- agement, Spiritual and Targeted Population Services within a single campus.” In two years, Haven for Hope has found work for 700 of its clients and permanent housing for nearly 900. According to spokes- woman Evita Mendiola, Haven’s early suc- cess stems from its ability to avoid the pre- dictable barriers for a homeless population, thanks to the on-site services that let Haven residents access social services without having to worry about how to get to them. Bill Brice, security and maintenance director for the Downtown Austin Alliance, notes one problem with the San Antonio approach that might also be an issue for Austin. Though the program has been suc- cessful in moving people off the streets into temporary shelter, the logical next step has been somewhat elusive. “They are recogniz- ing that they don’t necessarily have the [permanent housing] units to move those people into,” Brice says. There are certainly lessons for Austin in each of these programs. Foundation Com- munities is one of the Austin success sto- ries, and Executive Director Walter Moreau says that some of the success of the Miami and San Antonio programs is due to the simple fact that those efforts provide reserved beds. “You have a reserved spot that you don’t have to leave in the morn- ing,” he says. That’s not the case for Austin’s emergency shelter, the Austin Resource Center for the Homeless, where some of the most acutely needy turn. In the first place, the ARCH is primarily a first-come, first-served emergency shelter and is not equipped to serve as a centralized intake facility for the chronically homeless. According to Howard, only a fraction of the Ann Howard DOWNTOWN STOPGAP: THE PUBLIC In late September, Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo launched what the APD called a “public order initiative.” The operation was aimed at reducing Downtown crime in the wake of data that reflected that, while violent crime had been decreasing citywide, it had been rising in neighborhoods Down- town. Numbers were floated that suggested - perhaps mislead- ingly - that Downtown’s homeless population was linked to a disproportionate amount of crime. There was also a statement from Acevedo, delivered the day before the start of the initia- tive, that suggested homeless services be moved out of the center of the city (see “Latest Homeless Initiative: Bust ’Em?,” Oct. 12). There were rumors that the cops were engaged in sweeps, arresting large numbers of homeless people. In late October, Acevedo testified before the Austin City Council’s Health and Human Services Committee, providing a full-throated defense of the Downtown efforts: “We don’t target people,” he told council members, “based on socioeconomic standing.” Acevedo was not ready to abandon the idea that Downtown is not the best place for homeless social services - such as the Austin Resource Center for the Homeless on Seventh Street - to be head- quartered. “It has beer readily available and booze readily available; it’s probably not a good mixture,” he said. Acevedo waded into an even trickier argument, the conflict between the have-nots and the haves - specifically panhandlers vs. wealthy Downtown residents. Those residents “have an expectation,” he told the committee. “If I’m going to pay hundreds of thou- ORDER SOLUTION sands of dollars for a condo, I want to be able to go to that corner restau- rant or to that cafe” without being harassed. The September crackdown evoked a variety of responses. Mayor Pro Tern Sheryl Cole said the homelessness question was getting wrongly but “inextricably intertwined” with other issues. “A crime is a crime whether it is committed by a homeless person or not, and that needs to be addressed,” she said. “Violence is unac- ceptable regardless of who commits the crime.” But Cole also told the Chronicle that public order initiatives are not an ade- quate solution to homelessness. Downtown Austin Alliance’s Bill Brice said he con- siders Downtown safe, but added that “it’s hard to keep that area safe ... when people wait in line” to get into the ARCH. He further suggested that the system - fine as its operators might be - is overloaded. “What’s going out of the back of the [social services] pipeline,” he said, “is a lot less than what’s coming in the front.” The ultimate outcome of Acevedo’s roundup/public order ini- tiative remains to be seen. Part of that determination may come when the chief reports back to City Council with more precise data about how the homeless are involved in Downtown crime - how much as perpetrators and how much as victims. Council Member Mike Martinez said that while he is not absolutely opposed to moving services out of Downtown, homelessness isn’t necessarily bounded along street lines. “If we keep looking at homelessness as a geographical issue, we’ll never solve it,” he said. “It is a social problem, not a geographical problem.” - M.K. Sheryl Cole population that visits the ARCH receives case management services - the kind that help direct an individual through the some- times byzantine world of federal, state, and local social support services. Finding the Money Mayor Pro Tern Sheryl Cole has visited both Miami and San Antonio in search of best practices to bring home. She suggests that the city governments in those places have formed extensive partnerships. “Both cities have a model - a new model - that I think is probably one of the most critical aspects of what we need to implement here,” she says. “It involves a collaboration between the government sector, the faith- based community, social services, and the business community “In Austin, at this stage,” Cole continues, “the government sector is taking a primary role in trying to address the issue. . . . But we do not want to do that alone, and we do not think we can do that alone. We have to have the other prongs of the model at the table.” Much of the solution comes down to money. Miami-Dade reeled in millions of dollars in federal funding, thanks to its con- siderable local match. It can also depend on $14 million annually from the food and bev- erage tax. San Antonio, by contrast, is sub- ject to the same lack of state social services funding we are - but managed to give just over $7 million to Haven for Hope alone in fiscal year 2012. San Antonio’s Department of Human Services funded a raft of com- munity programs to the tune of $36.1 mil- lion from the city’s general fund. The city of Austin can provide only a frac- tion of its already severely diced $25 million in social services funds to address homeless- ness. Private investment did help establish such efforts as the ARCH, but Council Member Mike Martinez isn’t sure that’s an adequate precedent. “We’ve got to get the right partners at the table,” he says. “You can’t go to the business community every time and say, ‘Hey, we need you to pony up some money and help us solve this.’ We’ve already tried that, and it hasn’t worked. They stepped up heavily for the ARCH and helped fund that and embraced it being Downtown, and it’s done good - it’s done a lot of good things - but it certainly didn’t solve our issues.” Proposition 15 was supposed to help. On Nov. 6, the city of Austin asked its voters to approve $78.3 million in bonds for rental housing and affordable ownership opportu- nities for low- to moderate-income residents and Austinites with special needs who are working toward self-sufficiency. It wasn’t the annual $95 million infusion that helps fund Miami’s programs, but it would have been a substantial investment. The citizens of Austin said no. There’s been plenty of speculation, includ- ing in this paper, about why Prop. 15 failed. Martinez suggests it was insufficient educa- tion. “It’s not that [Austinites are] opposed to it. ... They just want to know where we are going to stick all of these units,” he says. “Obviously, we’d love to have a road map, but . . . when the opportunity arises and a property continued on p.30 28 the Austin chronicle NOVEMBER 30, 2012 austinchronicle.com • STORE • BOOTS MAKE A GREAT GIFT FOR THE HOLIDAYS 100s OF STYLES MEN, WOMEN & KIDS.
