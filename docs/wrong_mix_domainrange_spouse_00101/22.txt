They said it would never last.

But Anthony LaPaglia and his much younger wife Alexandra Henkel proved the haters wrong last Wednesday as they attended a screening of the Aussie actor's new Netflix show Florida Man in Los Angeles.

The Without a Trace star, 64, held hands with Henkel - who at 33 years old is more than three decades his junior - as the couple posed for photos on the red carpet.

LaPaglia, who plays the eponymous protagonist's father Sonny Valentine in the limited series, kept things casual in a black zip-up hoodie and matching blazer.

He completed his laid-back look with black pants and monochrome sneakers.

Henkel looked stylish in a floral-printed shirt dress, and styled her shoulder-length blonde hair loosely.

LaPaglia also posed for photos alongside his castmates, including Lex Scott Davis and Australian model-turned-actress Abby Lee.

The Frasier star married Henkel in an intimate ceremony in Hawaii in July 2018, a year after the couple got engaged in April 2017.

Announcing the news on social media at the time, the young bride wrote: '28.4.2018. The day I married the love of my life.'

Clearly aware of the age gap in their relationship, Henkel singled out trolls in another Instagram post.

'They said it wouldn't last. Love you, bub,' she captioned a photo of the pair.

Before meeting Henkel, LaPaglia was married to My Big Fat Greek Wedding actress Gia Carides for 17 years.

They announced their split in March 2015, and divorced a year later.

The former couple share 20-year-old daughter Bridget.

During an interview with the Herald Sun in April 2016, LaPaglia said his divorce from Carides was nobody else's business.

'My attitude is that if I don't know someone - and it's no disrespect to anyone out there - then I don't care what their opinion is because they're not me, they're not in my life and they can have all the opinions they like - they don't know what went on,' he said.

'Outsiders are relatively unimportant to me, as long as the people involved know what went on.'
