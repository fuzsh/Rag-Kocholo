        "text": "Even Hollywood tryna get a piece like 2Pac said.\n\nUma Thurman offers her Kill Bill jumpsuit to Drake amidst his ongoing beef with everyone in hip-hop. The actress posted an Instagram Story on Sunday (April 14) offering the black-and-yellow outfit from the film to Drake. “Need This @ChampagnePapi?” Thurman captioned the story.\n\nThe 6 God accepted the offer and asked for the Hattori Hanzo pen, which references the film’s legendary sword. “Yes pls,” he replied. “The pen is the Hattori Hanzo.”\n\nDrake shared an Instagram Story supporting Thurman, which featured an action scene from Kill Bill Vol.1. Their Instagram Stories spread across social media immediately.\n\nAfter posting the actress’s Instagram Story connected to Drake, Rick Ross inquired about Thurman’s outfit fitting him in The Shade Room’s comment section. “Think it fit me?” he wrote.\n\nThurman starred as The Bride in Quentin Tarantino’s 2003 film. She wore the outfit while fighting the triads in a roaring rampage scene. The outfit was also inspired by iconic action star Bruce Lee, who wore a similar outfit in his final film, “Game of Death.”\n\nDrake released “Push Ups” on Saturday. The track responds to recent verses directed at him by A$AP Rocky, Metro Boomin’, Kendrick Lamar, The Weeknd, Future, and, of course, Rick Ross.\n\nRoss responded to “Push Ups” with “Champagne Moments” shortly after its release, following two albums by Metro and Future that took shots at Drake.\n\nThe Bawse claims that his feud with Drake started after Drake sent a cease-and-desist letter to French Montana for using Drake’s verse on his new album.\n\nAfter Thurman, Birdman posted an Instagram Story showing support for Drake in the beef. The post featured a picture of them and the caption, “I’m Ridin’ With You 4L [Bald Eagle emoji]. I Got Ur Bak. Surprise Party CMRGYMCMBOVO.”"
