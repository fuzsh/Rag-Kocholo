        "text": "For ages, there had been musings from writer/director Quentin Tarantino about revisiting the “Kill Bill” saga with “Kill Bill 3,” having Uma Thurman reprising her role as Beatrix Kiddo, aka, The Bride as she fends off a wave of revenge seekers alongside her now grown daughter, Bibi. Well, with his tenth and final pic secured with “The Movie Critic” expected to go into production soon as casting is said to be on the horizon, Tarantino is seemingly pumping the breaks on all that “Kill Bill 3” hope.\n\nWhile speaking with Belgian outlet DeMorgan, the filmmaker was quick to shut down potentially casting Uma Thurman’s daughter Maya Hawke, who briefly appeared in “Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, as Bibi Kiddo (The Bride’s long lost daughter) in the long-talked-up “Kill Bill 3.” Stating that “The Movie Critic” is his main focus and alludes to the fact the third “Kill Bill” movie won’t be happening.\n\n“I don’t see that. My last film is about a film critic, a male critic. And he plays in the 70s,” Tarantino told the Belgian outlet when asked about casting Hawke alongside her mother.\n\nIf you’re not familiar with the next and potentially final theatrical feature film from Tarantino, it is said to be focusing on a male film critic set during 1977 in Los Angeles and is loosely based on a real-life person who wrote for a “porno rag.” The project has been compared to “Taxi Driver” by Tarantino suggesting his lead character is inspired by Robert De Niro’s socially isolated and violent protagonist, Travis Bickle. Alongside some previous nods to the revenge pic “Rolling Thunder,” there are clear signs (such as the film’s title) that Quentin will be taking cues from legendary screenwriter Paul Schrader, who wrote both “Rolling Thunder” and “Taxi Driver.”\n\nHowever, this doesn’t entirely rule out Tarantino returning to the project in the future as a potential miniseries or television series. You may remember the second film refers to the bloody Japanese samurai film “Shogun Assassin,” a key inspiration for the two volumes that was an adaptation of the “Lone Wolf & Cub” manga that was turned into a string of feature films and also cut-up to be presented in a television series format (“Shogun Assassin” being a blend of these films for the western market). In theory, given that he’s already talked up the idea of pursuing shows like his “Bounty Law” spinoff, it’s possible that “Kill Bill 3” might find a second life as a television project or even get the novelization treatment."
