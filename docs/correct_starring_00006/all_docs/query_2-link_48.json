        "text": "Quentin Tarantino's two-part festival of swords and slaughter Kill Bill could potentially spawn a third movie, the director has said.\n\nSpeaking around the release of his latest film, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, the auteur said that he's even been in discussion about it with his star Uma Thurman.\n\nAnd not only that, it was only the other day.\n\nRead more: Star Trek could be Tarantino’s last movie\n\nHe told the Happy Sad Confused podcast: “Me and Uma have talked about it recently, frankly, to tell you the truth.\n\n“I have thought about it a little further. We were talking about it literally last week.\n\n“If any of my movies were going to spring from my other movies, it would be a third Kill Bill.”\n\nThis is not the first time he's proffered a possible third instalment of his revenge saga, in which Thurman played The Bride, a woman scorned and then buried who embarks on a murderous spree to destroy her tormentors.\n\nHe's said back in 2004 that he might make a third film around the daughter of Vivica A. Fox's Vernita Green, Nikki, who witnesses The Bride killing her mother.\n\nHe told Entertainment Weekly: “Oh yeah, initially I was thinking this would be my ‘Dollars Trilogy’. I was going to do a new one every ten years. But I need at least fifteen years before I do this again.\n\n“I’ve already got the whole mythology: Sofie Fatale will get all of Bill’s money. She’ll raise Nikki, who’ll take on The Bride. Nikki deserves her revenge every bit as much as The Bride deserved hers. I might even shoot a couple of scenes for it now so I can get the actresses while they’re this age.”\n\nRead more: Tarantino bristles at Margot Robbie question\n\nBut equally, he told IGN in 2012 that he would 'probably not' revisit the films.\n\nHowever, he will be looking for a new project after the star-studded Once Upon A Time In Hollywood hits screens.\n\nThis will be his ninth movie, and he's more or less said that he'll be calling it a day after making 10 movies.\n\nThere's a possibility that the planned Star Trek movie he's written could be his last project, but sure a third chapter to the Kill Bill series would be far more appropriate.\n\nStarring Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Timothy Olyphant, Dakota Fanning, Bruce Dern, and Al Pacino, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is out across the UK on August 14."
