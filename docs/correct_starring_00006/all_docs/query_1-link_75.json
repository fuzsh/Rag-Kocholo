        "text": "Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman have recently discussed the idea of Kill Bill: Volume 3.\n\nTarantino was asked about making another Kill Bill movie during his appearance on the Happy Sad Confused podcast to promote his upcoming movie. As it turns out, Tarantino recently discussed making another Kill Bill movie with Thurman.\n\n\"...me and Uma have been actually [sic] talked about it recently, frankly, to tell you the truth. I'm not sure if I'm going to do it, but I have thought about it a little further,\" Tarantino said at the 33 minute mark. \"And if any of my movies would be taken -- me and Uma were literally were [sic] talking about it last week -- so, if any of my movies were going to spring from one of my other movies, it would be the third Kill Bill.\"\n\nThe podcast was uploaded on July 22 but it's not known when the interview was recorded. So, \"last week\" could mean the week of July 14 or not.\n\nTarantino plans to retire after making one more movie, and that last movie has been discussed as being a Star Trek movie. With Kill Bill back in the mix, who knows what Tarantino will set his heart on.\n\nThe filmmaker was then asked which characters he thinks about the most and he singled out four. He chose Uma Thurman's The Bride and David Carridine's Bill from the Kill Bill movies as well as Brad Pitt's Aldo and Christoph Waltz's Landa from Inglourious Basterds.\n\n\"...I wondered about what happens to the Bride, you know 10 years later, 15 years later, what happens to her daughter,\" Tarantino said. \"With Bill -- none of these I've worked out scenarios for -- but the whole Bill origin story has always entranced me with the idea of these three godfathers: [gang leader] Esteban Vihaio, the Mexican pimp, [sword smith and teacher] Hattori Hanzō and [kung fu teacher] Pat Mei. And how he had to go through all three of those to become this diabolical Bill.\"\n\nThe actor who played Esteban, Michael Parks, passed away in 2017 and Carridine died in 2009. If Tarantino was pursuing an origin story, he might have wanted to cast younger actors anyway. Tarantino could also stick to the future and tell the story of what happened to Thurman's Bride and her daughter. Or he will go classic Tarantino and tell a story jumping around different points in time.\n\nThe one thing to note about Tarantino is that the man stays true to his vision. Here he is in 2004 speaking to IGN about another Kill Bill movie after Volume 2:\n\n\"I have an idea about writing, like I did for the animation section in Vol. 1, is doing a Japanese anime feature about the origins of Bill. How Bill became Bill, you know, and deal with his three godfathers: Esteban Vallejo, Hattori Hanzō and Pei Mei. And I've also thought of the idea of, like, any other little stories that I might want to tell about the Bride or any of the other Deadly Vipers or anything. I could do [them] as a Frank Miller-style graphic novels or something. But I do have an idea that, maybe 15 years from now, doing the last chapter in the story. But it wouldn't star The Bride, it would star Nikki [Bell], Vernita's daughter, and she would be the star of it and she would be 20 years old and I already know exactly what happens to her, how she's raised and everything that happens, the whole story. I might even [be] shooting some time in the next two years, a couple of scenes while the actors that I'm working with are still young and this age and I can do a couple of scenes and stick them in a vault until I need them. It would be Nikki going out to get revenge on the Bride. Uma wouldn't be the star, she'd kind of be the bad guy, because the little girl kind of deserves her revenge.\"\n\nMaybe Tarantino will make a non-Kill Bill movie as his last feature and write or produce an anime for Kill Bill. If the man has a similar story idea lined up 15 years later, then maybe he still has the urge to go the animation route.\n\nTarantino originally envisioned Kill Bill as one long story. One of his producers suggested to split the film up into two to tell a longer story and flesh out characters. Tarantino agreed and Kill Bill: Volume 1 and Kill Bill: Volume 2 were released in October 2003 and April 2004 respectively. Neither reached the heights of Pulp Fiction at the box office, but were both big hits."
