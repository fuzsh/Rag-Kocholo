        "text": "Fans have had their fingers crossed for The Bride (Uma Thurman) to return in Kill Bill Vol.3, especially since director Quentin Tarantino has teased the possibility a few times over the years. Thurman is now admitting that there were some serious talks about returning in the past but recently it appears those talks have subsided.\n\nDuring a chat on The Jess Cagle Show on SiriusXM, Thurman gave another update on Kill Bill Vol.3 and that’s when she confirmed that she’d had serious discussions with Tarantino about the third entry and there was even a time when there was “real thought” that it would happen. Now have several years have passed since that moment, Thurman believes that Kill Bill Vol.3 is less probable:\n\n“I can’t really tell you anything about it. I mean it has been discussed over the years. There was real thought about it happening, but very long ago. I don’t see it as immediately on the horizon. I hate to disappoint people. Everybody wishes it would be the case, but I think it’s not immediately on the horizon.”\n\nTalks of a third Kill Bill film go all the way back to 2004 when the first two films were still fresh in the minds of moviegoers. Tarantino once told Entertainment Weekly that it was his hope for this to be his personal “Dollars Trilogy”, but he thought he needed at least 15 years to help set up the story for the third film. The idea that he toyed with was that young Nikki, now an adult, seeks revenge against The Bride for killing her mother.\n\nIn recent years, Tarantino has continued to keep hope alive for Kill Bill Vol.3. The director has said that his next film, his tenth, would be his last as he goes into retirement so I imagine he has to think long and hard about what that film should be. Back in 2019, Tarantino told Andy Cohen that Kill Bill Vol.3 was still “in the cards” and he even added on The Joe Rogan Experience that he was still considering doing the film, hoping to get Maya Hawke, Uma Thurman’s real-life daughter, involved in the cast.\n\nAt this point, it seems that Kill Bill Vol.3 has always just existed as talk but I would love to see The Bride return for a third film. I think it would be a lot of fun to revisit that universe.\n\nDo YOU want to see Kill Bill Vol.3?"
