        "text": "Uma Thurman will not be dusting off her Hattori Hanzō anytime soon.\n\nThe Golden Globe winner, 51, gave an update on a potential third installment of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill franchise during Wednesday's episode of SiriusXM's The Jess Cagle Show.\n\n\"It has been discussed over the years. There was real thought about it happening, but very long ago,\" she said.\n\nThurman added, \"I don't see it as immediately on the horizon. I hate to disappoint people. Everybody wishes it would be the case, but I think it's not immediately on the horizon.\"\n\nRELATED: Uma Thurman Reflects on Batman & Robin 25 Years Later: 'As Much Rubber as I've Ever Worked with'\n\nThe actress worked with Tarantino, 58, on Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003) and its 2004 sequel, playing Beatrix \"The Bride\" Kiddo, a former assassin who hunts down her ex-lover Bill (David Carradine) after he attempted to murder her.\n\nTarantino previously revived some longstanding hype about completing the trilogy, revealing in 2019 that he spoke to Thurman about what a third film would look like. He said on SiriusXM's Radio Andy that another installment is \"definitely in the cards.\"\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free weekly newsletter to get the biggest news of the week delivered to your inbox every Friday.\n\nAndrew Cooper/A Band Apart/Miramax/Kobal/Shutterstock Uma Thurman in Kill Bill\n\n\"I do have an idea of what I would do with it,\" he said. \"That was the whole thing, was conquering that concept, exactly what's happened to the Bride since then and what I would want to do. I wouldn't want to come up with a cockamamie adventure. She doesn't deserve that. The Bride has fought long and hard.\"\n\n\"But now I have an idea that would be interesting. I wouldn't do it for a little bit. It would be like at least three years from now, or something like that. But it is definitely in the cards,\" Tarantino added.\n\nMany fans have speculated that a third film would feature a showdown between the Bride's now-grown daughter and the daughter of Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), who witnessed Beatrix (a.k.a. Black Mamba) kill her mom.\n\nStephane Cardinale /Getty Images Maya Hawke and\n\nFox, 57, later nominated Zendaya for the role of her daughter, to which the Euphoria star, 25, said she was \"quite honored.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Tarantino has suggested that Thurman's actual daughter Maya Hawke should play the Bride's daughter Bebe, after he worked with Hawke, 23, on his 2019 film Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Ethan Hawke Proudly Applauds Daughter Maya's Stranger Things Role: 'She's the Real Thing'\n\n\"I think it's just revisiting the characters 20 years later and just imagining the Bride and her daughter, Bebe, having 20 years of peace, and then that peace is shattered,\" he said on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, adding: \"And now the Bride and Bebe are on the run and just the idea of being able to cast Uma and cast her daughter Maya in the thing would be f------ exciting.\""
