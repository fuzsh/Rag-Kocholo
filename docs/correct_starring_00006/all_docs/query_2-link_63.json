        "text": "Quentin Tarantino has never made a proper sequel to one of his films, but he said in an interview Monday that there’s a chance we see a “Kill Bill 3” — and that could happen sooner than we think.\n\nOn Andy Cohen’s radio show Monday, the “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” director said he recently had dinner with the Bride herself, “Kill Bill” star Uma Thurman, and said he has an idea for where she’d now be after all this time.\n\n“I do have an idea of what I would do with it. That was the whole thing was conquering that concept, exactly what’s happened to the Bride and what do I want to do,” Tarantino said. “Because I wouldn’t just want to come up with some cockamamie adventure. She doesn’t deserve that. The Bride has fought long and hard. But now I have an idea. I still wouldn’t do it for a little bit.\n\nAs for an actual timeline, “It would be at least three years from now. But it is definitely in the cards,” he continued.\n\n“Kill Bill” was originally conceived as one film, but due to a runtime of over four hours, it was was divided in two movies – “Kill Bill: Volume 1” and “Kill Bill: Volume 2,” released in 2003 and 2004 respectively.\n\nTarantino clarified that in between when he wrote “Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood” and actually filmed it, he took some time off and instead wrote a play and a five-episode TV series. So he says both of those projects would come before any plans for a third “Kill Bill” movie and that he’s mapped out his next three years.\n\nOf course, Tarantino has a lot of ideas for movies, sequels and the rest of it. But in comparison to some other auteurs, he’s actually been quite selective about the movies he takes on, and he’s repeatedly said in interviews that he envisions capping off his career after just 10 films. And for those keeping score at home, “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” is his ninth film. There’s also been rumblings of a Tarantino “Star Trek” script, and perhaps even more from “Django Unchained.” So we’ll keep a pin in any “Kill Bill” sequel for now.\n\nCheck out a clip from Tarantino’s interview with Cohen above."
