Uma Thurman has addressed the possibility of a third Kill Bill movie... and we're not popping our corn any time soon.

In spite of the movie's director Quentin Tarantino creating anticipation for a Kill Bill Vol. 3 over the years, Beatrix 'The Bride' Kiddo herself quelled such speculation in a recent conversation on SiriusXM's The Jess Cagle Show.

When asked about a follow-up for the franchise, Thurman admitted that a third entry is "not immediately on the horizon".

"I can't really tell you anything about it," she said. "I mean it has been discussed over the years. There was real thought about it happening, but very long ago. I don't see it as immediately on the horizon."

Thurman added: "I hate to disappoint people. Everybody wishes it would be the case, but I think it's not immediately on the horizon."

Leaving a scintilla of hope, however, she did end on "never say never".

Tarantino has previously imagined possible storylines for the follow-up.

The director said on The Joe Rogan Experience in June 2021 that Kill Bill Vol. 3 would centre on the daughter of Vivica A Fox's character Vernita Green, in order to "avenge her mother's death by killing Uma Thurman’s The Bride".

It would also star Beatrix's daughter, who Tarantino said would be played by Thurman's own daughter, Stranger Things' Maya Hawke.

Fleshing out the potential plot, he added: "I think it's just revisiting the characters 20 years later and just imagining The Bride and her daughter, Bebe, having 20 years of peace, and then that peace is shattered.

"And now The Bride and Bebe are on the run, and just the idea of being able to cast [Thurman] and cast her daughter, [Hawke] in the thing would be f**king exciting.”

Fingers crossed this is something that still comes to light.
