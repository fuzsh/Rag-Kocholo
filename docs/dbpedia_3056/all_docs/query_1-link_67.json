        "text": "The feature length animated adaptation of the Walt Disney Studios movie Cinderella (1950) is based upon a 1697 fairy tale of the same name by French author Charles Perault. Directed by Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske, the animated movie was written for the movies by Bill Peet and Erdman Penner. The Disney studios, which later would become Disney Pixar, had been on the brink of bankruptcy due to poor performing movies in part due to losing access to the European markets during World War Two. Cinderella became the studios biggest hit since the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), reviewed here.\n\nThe story of Cinderella as offered by the movie begins with narration as performed by Betty Lou Gerson. We are provided context sufficient to learn that Cinderella’s father had remarried once widowed to widower and mother of two, Lady Tremaine. Lady Tremaine, as voiced by Eleanor Audley, would become widowed a second time herself. Looking to favor her daughters Drizella and Anastasia, as voiced by Rhoda Williams and Lucille Bliss, Lady Tremaine would make Cinderella a domestic servant in the family house following her final husband’s death. Ilene Woods would voice Cinderella; Helene Stanley served as a live model for Cinderella.\n\nDrizella and Anastasia would take advantage of their stepsister’s position for their own advantage socially and through additional work. Additionally, we are introduced to the support Cinderella receives from her main source of friendship. Jaq and Gus, a pair of mice voiced by James MacDonald, are the most clearly defined friends that Cinderella earns through the course of the presented story. The natural enemy to Jaq and Gus is the cat Lucifer, the pet of Lady Tremaine. Lucifer retaliates against Cinderella for Cinderella’s protection of the mice, who the cat would like to catch and eat. June Foray voiced Lucifer.\n\nThe story we get to see in Cinderella appears to occur over a period of two days. The king of the land where the Tremaine family lives desperately wants to be a grandfather. This pronounced desire leads the King to create a ball for the kingdom with the intent of encouraging his son to find a single lady to marry her son and mother the son’s children. The King orders the Grand Duke, both characters as voiced by Luis van Rooten, to bring all the single ladies of the kingdom to the castle to meet the king.\n\nConniving to the advantage of the Tremaine daughters is put in motion by Lady Tremaine, who would prefer to see one of her two biological daughters become the enchanted one of the King’s son, Prince Charming. The stable of animals around the Tremaine home, save Lucifer, aim to assist Cinderella against this plot. The aid of a Fairy Godmother comes to assist Cinderella with her supportive animals. The transformations to the song Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo offers a charm eclipsed only by the love connection eventually made and requited thanks to a glass slipper fitting for Cinderella the next day. Al Hoffman, Mack David and Jerry Livingston wrote the transformation song. Prince Charming was voiced by William Phipps (talking) and Mike Douglas (singing) while Verna Felton voiced the Fairy Godmother; Claire Du Brey served as a live model for the Fairy Godmother.\n\nPart of what drew me to review Cinderella now is that Daycare Friend will be performing in a local stage production of the story next week. The story itself offers endearing statements in support of friendship, love, believing in dreams and facing adversity even when confronted with cruelty. Your choice of response also comes through as a redeeming message of the film. I give the movie Cinderella as directed by Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson and Hamilton Luske 3.75-stars on a scale of one-to-five.\n\nMatt – Saturday, September 30, 2023"
