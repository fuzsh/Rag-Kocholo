Frank Baum''s book series.\n\nParts and Labor\n\n- Director: Robert Eggers - IMDb user rating: 6.9 - Metascore: 83 - Runtime: 92 minutes It was a dream job for the 210-pound billy goat named Charlie to play Black Phillip in the 2015 horror film, “The Witch.” But on the fourth day of making the movie, Charlie put his horns in the star''s rib so his role was subsequently outsourced to a puppet with the exception of one scene where Charlie was filmed while tethered to a leash.\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)\n\n- Director: Fred M.
