        "text": "One Hundred and One Dalmatians\n\n84 in x of animated feature film history Release: Jan. 25th, 1961 Country: USA Director: Clyde Geronimi, Hamilton Luske, Wolfgang Reitherman\n\nOne Hundred and One Dalmatians is a film from Walt Disney Productions, based on Dodie Smith's 1956 novel of the same name.\n\nPongo is a male Dalmatian living in London with his master, Roger, a bachelor songwriter who has yet to sell his first tune. Bored with their single existence, Pongo arranges for Roger to meet Anita, a pretty young woman who just happens to have a female Dalmatian named Perdita. It is not long before love blossoms all around and a double wedding takes place. A few months later, Perdita gives birth to 15 puppies, much to the delight of Cruella De Vil, a wealthy, wicked former schoolmate of Anita's whose burning passion is to own a coat made of Dalmatian pelts. When she is unable to purchase the puppies, she has them \"dognapped\" and brought to her crumbling estate in the country, where 84 other Dalmatians are also being held captive. All attempts by the police to find the missing pups fail, and the desperate Pongo and Perdita appeal to the dogs of London, via the ‘twilight bark.’ Led by The Colonel, an indomitable shaggy dog and a cat named Sergeant Tibbs, all dogdom comes to the rescue and, aided by geese, cows, and horses, tracks down the missing puppies.\n\nWhen Walt Disney read Smith’s novel in 1957, it immediately grabbed his attention, and he promptly acquired the rights. Smith had always secretly hoped that Disney would make it into a film. Disney assigned Bill Peet to write the story, marking the first time that the story for a Disney film was created by a single person. When Peet sent Dodie Smith some drawings of the characters, she wrote back saying that he had actually improved her story and that the designs looked better than the illustrations in the book.\n\nAfter the very expensive Sleeping Beauty failed at the box-office, there was some talk of closing down the animation department at the Disney studio. Ub Iwerks, in charge of special processes at the studio, had been experimenting with Xerox photography to aid in animation. By 1959 he had modified a Xerox camera to transfer drawings by animators directly to animation cels, eliminating the inking process. However, because of its limitations, the camera was unable to deviate from a black scratchy outline and lacked the fine lavish quality of hand inking. According to Chuck Jones, Disney was able to complete the film for about half of what it would have cost if they had had to animate all the dogs and spots. All totaled, the film featured 6,469,952 spots, with Pongo sporting 72 spots, Perdita 68, and each puppy 32.\n\nThe production of the film also signaled a change in the graphic style of Disney's animation. Sleeping Beauty had a more graphic, angular style than previous Disney films, and the same look was carried over. The background artists would paint loose molds to represent an object and photocopy the details onto the mold. Disney disliked the artistic look of it and felt he was losing the fantasy element of his animated films. Disney eventually forgave art director Ken Anderson on his final trip to the studio in late 1966.\n\nOn previous Disney animated features, the top animators were assigned a character and drew the bulk (if not all) of that particular character's scenes individually. Animation on this film was far more of a ‘team effort’ - for example, seven of the famed Nine Old Men worked on Perdita. There was one notable exception: Marc Davis drew Cruella De Vil entirely on his own.\n\nAs done with other Disney films, Disney hired an actress to perform live-action scenes as a reference for the animation process. Actress Helene Stanley performed the live-action reference for the character of Anita. She did the same kind of work for the characters of Cinderella and Princess Aurora. Barbara Luddy (the voice of Lady in Lady and the Tramp and Merryweather in Sleeping Beauty) provided the live referencing for Nanny. Mary Wickes, who did live reference for Cruella De Vil, would later go onto voice Lavern the Gargoyle 35 years later in The Hunchback of Notre Dame.\n\nThe best known member of the cast was Australian actor Rod Taylor, who before the making of this movie had had extensive radio experience. He was cast as Pongo. Walt Disney originally had Lisa Davis read the role of Cruella De Vil, but she ended up being cast as Anita. Clarence Nash (best known as the voice of Donald Duck) did the dog barks for this film.\n\nUnlike many Disney animated features, the film features only three songs, with just one, ‘Cruella De Vil’, playing a big part in it. The other two are ‘Kanine Krunchies Jingle’ (sung by Lucille Bliss, who voiced Anastasia Tremaine in Disney's 1950 film Cinderella), and ‘Dalmatian Plantation’ in which only two lines are sung by Roger at its closure.\n\nThe film was first released to theaters on January 25, 1961. After its initial theatrical run, it was re-released to theaters four more times: 1969, 1979, 1985, and 1991. The film was the tenth highest grossing film of 1961 in the US and Canada, accruing $6,400,000 in distributors' domestic (U.S. and Canada) rentals during its first year of release.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the cartoon that the puppies watch on the TV in Hell Hall is not Disney’s 1932 short Flowers and Trees. It is actually Springtime, a Silly Symphony film made in 1929.\n\nCameos of characters From Lady and the Tramp can be seen during the scene where all the dogs of London are sending out a message that the puppies have been puppy napped (the twilight bark).\n\nIn the scene when Horace and Jasper are watching television, the TV show they're watching ‘What's My Crime’ is loosely based off of a contemporary TV show called ‘What's My Line.’ What's My Crime consists of a panel asking several questions to guess what crime the guest has committed, while in What's My Line the panel tries to guess who the mystery guest is while blindfolded.”"
