The star of the show turns out to be a Himalayan cat named Jinxie whose disappearance adds to the chaos and comedy.\n\n- Director: Simon Wells - IMDb user rating: 7.1 - Metascore: data not available - Runtime: 78 minutes Fans of the movie “Balto” fell in love with the young Siberian husky that helps a team of sled dogs deliver life-saving serum to Nome from Anchorage, Alaska to help the community battling diphtheria. It was actually a 12-year-old husky named Toto that led the first leg of “The Great Race of Mercy.” You may also like: Best Robert De Niro movies\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nIndian author Ruchi Prabhu observes that “pets understand humans better than humans do.” Look no further than film to see the truth in Prabhu's sentiment: Who can resist Lassie's loyalty, Toto's tenacity, or the way the pixilated pets in “The Secret Life of Pets” fill up the screen?

Their journey home is a visual delight in the stunning Sierras where the trio encounters surprises in their travels.\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)\n\n- Directors: Victor Fleming, George Cukor, Mervyn LeRoy, Norman Taurog, Richard Thorpe, King Vidor - IMDb user rating: 8.0 - Metascore: 92 - Runtime: 102 minutes The Cairn terrier named Toto that accompanied Dorothy on her journey through Oz played a vital role in Dorothy's well-being. Who could forget when the Wicked Witch of the West shrilled, “I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog, too?” Toto was played by Terry, who earned $125 a week for her fetching role in the movie classic based on L. Frank Baum's book series.\n\nParts and Labor\n\n- Director: Robert Eggers - IMDb user rating: 6.9 - Metascore: 83 - Runtime: 92 minutes It was a dream job for the 210-pound billy goat named Charlie to play Black Phillip in the 2015 horror film, “The Witch.” But on the fourth day of making the movie, Charlie put his horns in the star's rib so his role was subsequently outsourced to a puppet with the exception of one scene where Charlie was filmed while tethered to a leash.\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)\n\n- Director: Fred M. Wilcox - IMDb user rating: 7.1 - Metascore: 78 - Runtime: 89 minutes “Lassie Comes Home” illuminates the special bond between a dog and his family. When Lassie, the family's beloved collie, is sold out of financial desperation during the Great Depression, she bravely faces a myriad of obstacles to rejoin them. The original Lassie, named Pal, was actually a boy-and his direct descendants, also all boys, have played the starring role ever since.\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)\n\n- Directors: Charles Crichton, John Cleese - IMDb user rating: 7.5 - Metascore: 80 - Runtime: 108 minutes One has to pay close attention to note the cameo appearance of the fish in “A Fish Called Wanda.” The plot revolves around the fish, and the fish is always being talked about, but it only appears at the beginning.
