        "text": "Alice in Wonderland, American animated musical film, released in 1951, that was a madcap family classic based on Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland (1865) and included elements of his later sequel, Through the Looking-Glass (1871). It was produced by Walt Disney.\n\nThe film centres on the adventures of young Alice, a dreamy, distractable girl who nevertheless proves very practical when necessary. One day, finding herself bored by her older sister’s history lesson, she notices a rabbit running by in a waistcoat and carrying a pocket watch. Curious, she follows him down a rabbit hole and into Wonderland, a bizarre, nonsensical world filled with strange characters, from a disappearing Cheshire Cat to a tea-loving Mad Hatter to the cruel Queen of Hearts, who orders Alice’s execution. Realizing that her trip to Wonderland is a dream, Alice escapes the queen by waking herself up.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz"
