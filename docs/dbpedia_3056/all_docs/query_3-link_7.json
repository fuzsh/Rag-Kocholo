Pat Wyeth tells the Contra Costa Times investigators believe Perkins's claim that he abandoned the pet and are trying to track down the animal.\n\nPolice say the woman was robbed by two suspects while she walked her dog around 2 p.m. on Oct. 30. One of the men apparently simulated a gun, as one grabbed her dog and the other stole her purse.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Contra Costa Times"
