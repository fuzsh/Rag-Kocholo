The series started in 1937 with Pluto's Quin-puplets and ended in 1951 with Cold Turkey. The series stars the titular character Pluto, introduced in the Mickey Mouse film series as Mickey's pet dog, in addition to having recurring appearances by previously known characters such as Minnie Mouse, Figaro the Kitten, and Mickey Mouse, and also introduced well-known characters such as the chipmunk duo Chip 'n' Dale.[1]\n\nProduction[edit]\n\nThe short films were produced by Walt Disney Productions, and distributed by RKO Radio Pictures (later shorts being distributed by Buena Vista Distribution in re-releases). Like other Disney animated shorts in the golden age of American animation, the shorts begin with a starburst with a close-up of the star character's face (in this case Pluto), followed by the title \"A Walt Disney Pluto\".\n\nMost of the shorts were directed by Charles Nichols.[2] Another director of a considerable number of shorts in the series was Clyde Geronimi.[3]\n\nBeing Pluto a dog and most of supporting characters being also animals without dialogue, the plot of most shorts is understood through their expressions, gestures, and actions. This made Pluto short films pioneering cartoons in animation, counting on characters who express personality through physical actions rather than dialogue.[4]\n\nList of films[edit]\n\nThe following is a list of Pluto films.\n\nThis list does not include shorts from other series in which Pluto appears, such as those from the Mickey Mouse series, the Donald Duck series, or other Walt Disney Productions short films that are not part of the Pluto series, nor shorts of Pluto made as part of the episodes of the television series Mickey Mouse Works.\n\n1937[edit]\n\n1940[edit]\n\n1941[edit]\n\n1942[edit]\n\n1943[edit]\n\n1944[edit]\n\n1945[edit]\n\n1946[edit]\n\n1947[edit]\n\n1948[edit]\n\n1949[edit]\n\n1950[edit]\n\n# Title Director Release\n\n33\n\nPluto's Heart Throb\n\nJanuary 6, 1950[41]\n\nPluto walks down the street, and Cupid (represented as a dog), makes him fall in love with Dinah, who pays no attention to him, but Cupid makes her fall in love with him too. Pluto is happy until Butch shows up, who also wants to woo Dinah. They both accompany Dinah to her house, where after taking advantage of Butch leaving, Pluto gives her a bone. They both go outside, but while Dinah is out, Pluto gets beaten up by Butch while Dinah hears the noise. Butch pretends to walk down the street, and Dinah warns him that someone is attacking Pluto. Butch pretends to revive him to her, but when Dinah isn't looking, Butch punches Pluto. In the end Dinah discovers him, and kicks him out. Reanimated, Pluto leaves to get the bone, but Butch returns, and seeing Pluto together breaks his heart. Dinah tries to get away from Butch, until she falls into the pool, and while Butch can't bring himself to go in the water, Pluto ends up saving her. Butch leaves in shame, while Pluto and Dinah end up together happily.\n\nOther appearances: Dinah the Dachshund, Butch the Bulldog, Cupid\n\n34\n\nPluto and the Gopher\n\nCharles Nichols[42]\n\nFebruary 10, 1950[42]\n\nPluto discovers a gopher eating the flowers in Minnie's garden, and tries to catch it, while the gopher taunts him. As he chases after him, he smashes some flowers, for which Minnie scolds him. Minnie keeps a pot with a flower inside the house, in which the gopher was, who after confusing a green carpet with the grass in the garden, begins to make tunnels in it. Soon Pluto discovers him, and chases the gopher around the house. The gopher hides in different ways, but Pluto always has him cornered. After the chase, the gopher finally returns to the garden, where he goes back to digging tunnels. Pluto tries to catch him, but the gopher tangles his ears in the tunnels, trapping Pluto as the gopher continues to eat flowers.\n\nOther appearances: Gopher, Minnie Mouse[43]\n\n35\n\nWonder Dog\n\nCharles Nichols[44]\n\nApril 7, 1950[44]\n\nPluto discovers that Dinah is a fan of Prince the Wonder Dog, who is the star of a circus. To be like him, Pluto imagines the scrapyard as a circus where he begins to juggle. He is watched by Butch, who laughs at Pluto's clumsiness. With Butch locked up, Pluto taunts him, but Butch escapes and chases after Pluto, who immediately ends up doing different kinds of mischief which impresses Dinah, who watches him outside the junkyard. In the end, Pluto ends up falling into the fence where Prince's sign is, with his face sticking out where Prince's was, while Dinah glares at him, with Pluto happy about it.\n\nOther appearances: Dinah the Dachshund, Butch the Bulldog, Prince the Wonder Dog (on a poster)\n\n36\n\nPrimitive Pluto\n\nCharles Nichols[45]\n\nMay 19, 1950[45]\n\nPluto is comfortably in a cabin in the woods, where his primitive instinct appears to him, represented as a miniature wolf, which, seeing that Pluto is too comfortable, convinces him to go hunting for his own food. In the forest, searching and tracking food, the wolf constantly scolds him for not doing things properly. Finally, after having problems with a rabbit, and running into a bear, Pluto runs home, where he discovers the wolf eating the food he had in his bowl, so he begins to chase him furiously, refusing to listen to his primitive instinct anymore.\n\nOther appearances: Primo the Wolf[46]\n\n37\n\nPuss Cafe\n\nCharles Nichols[47]\n\nJune 9, 1950[47]\n\nMilton the Cat goes in search of his friend Richard to take him to a house where there are some bottles of milk at the door, and some appetizing birds flying and fish in the garden pond. When Pluto catches them drinking the milk, the cats run away, but as Pluto goes to his hammock, the cats go back into the garden to trap the birds in the tree house, but they fall on top of Pluto, and they run away again. Not wanting to have any more trouble, they use the hammock to catapult Pluto out of the garden, seizing the moment to catch the fish in the pond. However, Pluto returns and the cats run away again, this time chasing them through the city, until they lead him to a huge cat that ends up scaring Pluto.\n\nOther appearances: Milton the Cat (debut), Richard the Cat\n\n38\n\nPests of the West\n\nCharles Nichols[48]\n\nJuly 21, 1950[48]\n\nBent-Tail intends to capture the chickens on a farm with the help of his son, whom he orders to get into the chicken coop, but instead of fulfilling his mission, he ends up sleeping in a nest. Faced with such a situation, Bent-Tail breaks into the chicken coop and captures the chickens himself, but the scandal awakens Pluto, who barks ferociously at the coyotes. Pluto returns to his dog house to sleep, not realizing that the coyotes are hiding on the roof, trying not to make any noise. But in the end, Bent-Tail ends up sneezing and wakes up Pluto, who starts chasing him. After an attempt to catch Bent-Tail, Plutp discovers the coyotes trying to take a chicken from her nest, continually trying to return it to the coop, while coyotes take it from him all the time. Finally, after the commotion, Bent-Tail manages to take the nest, but ends up realizing that the hen is not on top but his own son, who tries to cheer up his father by showing that he has got an egg, which Bent-Tail breaks furiously over the head of his son.\n\nOther appearances: Bent-Tail the Coyote, Bent-Tail Junior\n\n39\n\nFood for Feudin'\n\nCharles Nichols[49]\n\nAugust 11, 1950[49]\n\nChip and Dale fill their tree with acorns, but when Pluto sees that the tree is a good place to hide his bone, the pressure causes the acorns to fall out, causing both Pluto and the chipmunks to fall down the hill. With the acorns inside Pluto's dog house, the chipmunks try to get them back. Chip and Dale hide inside two gloves to avoid discovery, as well as trying to distract Pluto thanks to it. After starting to play with a ball, and Pluto ends up tied to his house, they carry the ball to their tree for Pluto to follow and drag the dog house behind him. Thanks to this, they move the acorns from Pluto's house to the tree. Pluto discovers them, but the chipmunks tangle his paws with the gloves, trapping him. Mimicking the situation, they end up entangling their own hands, which makes the three of them end up laughing.\n\nOther appearances: Chip 'n' Dale[50]\n\n40\n\nCamp Dog\n\nCharles Nichols[51]\n\nSeptember 22, 1950[51]\n\nWhile howling at the moon, Bent-Tail and his son smell food hanging from a tree next to a campsite. Taking advantage of the fact that the owner is not there, they try to catch it, but Bent-Tail is scared away by Pluto, who was inside the tent. When he goes back inside the store, Bent-Tail tries again to get the food, but his son drags Pluto out of the store while he is asleep, thinking he is edible. Bent-Tail quickly returns him to the tent, and again tries to get the food down from the tree, which ends up falling to the ground. As Bent-Tail picks the food up, his son continues to get Pluto out of the tent, until he finally wakes up. The coyotes pretend to be asleep inside the tent, so Pluto tries to let them sleep peacefully, but they go off to get the food again, while they lock Pluto in the tent. In the end, Pluto escapes, but falls into the river, so the coyotes take advantage of the moment to eat by setting up a picnic. Pluto returns and scares them away, but seeing the owner return, Pluto runs away so he wouldn't think he was going to eat the picnic food himself, and ends up joining the coyotes in howling at the moon.\n\nOther appearances: Bent-Tail the Coyote, Bent-Tail Junior\n\n1951[edit]\n\n# Title Director Release\n\n41\n\nCold Storage\n\nFebruary 9, 1951[52]\n\nA stork is getting cold during the winter, so it flies in search of shelter, until it finds the house of Pluto, who later returns full of cold. The stork takes Pluto out of the booth, and does not let him in, moving the booth continuously. Pluto begins to think that he is going crazy watching his kennel move, until he sees it walking on legs. Pluto tries to get the stork to come out, but instead he uses his long beak to eat his food out of the hut, and flies away. As the stork sleeps comfortably, Pluto kicks her out and takes back the kennel from him, but the stork kicks him out again. Continually, they both start fighting, kicking one out of the booth while the other goes back inside. Finally, the sun comes out and it starts to get hot, so now they both try to get out of the kennel, and while the stork does, it doesn't let Pluto out, so the dog starts to get hot. Fortunately, Pluto manages to move the house to the garden pond, being able to cool off thanks to the water.\n\nOther appearances: Fred Stork\n\n42\n\nPlutopia\n\nCharles Nichols[53]\n\nMay 18, 1951[53]\n\nMickey and Pluto arrive at a camp, where they stay in a cabin. But according to the rules of the camp, Pluto must be tied up outside the cabin, and wearing a muzzle, which prevents him from eating his food. Adding to his frustration, Milton the Cat seizes the opportunity to take Pluto's food and eat it himself. During the night, Pluto dreams that he is in a place where Milton is his butler, and that he can easily spank him, plus he serves her all kinds of food whenever he bites its tail. When he wakes up, Mickey removes his muzzle, but with the dream still in mind he bites Milton's tail, who begins to fight with Pluto.\n\nOther appearances: Milton the Cat, Mickey Mouse\n\n43\n\nCold Turkey\n\nCharles Nichols[54]\n\nSeptember 21, 1951[54]\n\nPluto and Milton sleep while a wrestling show is on TV. Waking up, they see a succulent roast turkey on TV, and wanting to eat it, they try to see if there is any way to access it, until Pluto is electrocuted by the wiring. When it's time to eat, the food in their bowls isn't enough for them, so they search for food until they see cans in a cupboard. Pluto tries to use the garbage can to get Milton up, but accidentally ends up throwing him into the fridge, opening the door on impact. The two see a frozen turkey inside, and struggling to get it, Pluto locks Milton in the fridge, but Milton ends up running away and locking Pluto inside the fridge. Once he gets out, he goes looking for Milton, who hides with the turkey inside the television. Pluto turns on the light, causing Milton to come out due to the heat from the appliance, but he leaves the turkey inside, which ends up burning. In the end, they both end up wrestling just like in the wrestling show.\n\nOther appearances: Milton the Cat\n\nHome media[edit]\n\nThe films have been released in various forms of home media, with selected films released on VHS, laserdisc, and DVD.
