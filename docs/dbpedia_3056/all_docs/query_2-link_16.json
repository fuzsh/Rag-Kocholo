        "text": "After being snubbed by the royal family, a malevolent fairy places a curse on a princess which only a prince can break, along with the help of three good fairies.\n\nThe running gag where two of the fairies argued about what color Princess Aurora's dress should be (pink or blue) comes from the filmmaker's problem as to deciding just that.\n\nAlice stumbles into the world of Wonderland. Will she get home? Not if the Queen of Hearts has her way.\n\nWhen Cinderella's cruel stepmother prevents her from attending the Royal Ball, she gets some unexpected help from the lovable mice Gus and Jaq and from her Fairy Godmother.\n\nAnimator Frank Thomas, who was responsible for animating Captain Hook, had some initial difficulty trying to get the character started. Thomas was torn between two iterations of Hook: as Erdman Penner's foppish dandy or as Clyde Geronimi's snarling heavy. Eventually, Walt Disney came to Thomas' aid in regards of his approach to Captain Hook. Disney told him, \"I think you're beginning to get him,\" and then advised him to keep going in that direction.\n\nWhen a litter of Dalmatian puppies are abducted by the minions of Cruella De Vil, the owners must find them before she uses them for a diabolical fashion statement."
