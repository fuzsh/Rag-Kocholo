        "text": "Alice in Wonderland was the second feature-length film in Disney’s post-war renaissance, following Cinderella, and it holds up remarkably well. Far more so than the relatively straight-down-the-line Cinderella, Alice is unpredictable, hilariously witty, and bristling over with creativity if not beauty. It’s also surprisingly ahead of its time, feeling like an ideal companion piece to Yellow Submarine almost a decade before the Beatles exploded.\n\nThe film is a perfect culmination to the flurry of anthology musical animations that Disney produced in the 1940s, including Fun and Fancy Free, Melody Time and Make Mine Music. There, the compilation of lots of short films allowed for a great deal of visual and musical variety, often linked by a broad framing device. Here, the framing device is much more consistent – Alice (Kathryn Beaumont) follows a White Rabbit (Bill Thompson) down a rabbit hold, and finds herself wondering through the weird environs of Wonderland – but the film is still at its core a series of wacky vignettes, introducing instantly memorable characters and then moving on before any can become boring.\n\nSome of the vignettes are beautifully realised. The absolute highlight is ‘The Walrus and the Carpenter’, told as a story within a story by Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-dum (J. Pat O’Malley playing all the voices). The story of the two friends who decide to lure a group of innocent oysters to a meal is beautifully rendered, with Dum and Dee playing the sun and moon who split the landscape, and the Walrus (who evokes Winston Churchill with his cigar) descending into the sea to play pied piper to the oysters. The childlike oysters, with their upper shells as bonnets, and little floating feet, are cute as a button, and the moment when they are revealed horrific; yet the conflict between the Walrus and Carpenter evokes Donald Duck slapstick, all set to the sonorous tones of the Walrus’s poetry (‘The time has come’). It’s a masterpiece of short storytelling, funny and shocking all together.\n\nIn many ways, Disney’s compression of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass turns the fantasias of Lewis Carroll into an extended nightmare. The dream logic is beautifully visualised in such small touches as Alice trying to stay afloat in a glass jar on a huge ocean, slipping against the glass; the claustrophobia when she grows into a giant in the tiny confines of the White Rabbit’s hut; and, most evocatively, as she floats through mid-air towards a tiny door, trying to escape the rampaging hordes chasing her down. Alice’s dislocation is captured in animation that dispenses with lavish backgrounds for a range of styles that shift between German expressionism (as Alice wanders down jagged corridors), surrealism (the pink-elephant evoking dance of the playing cards), and weekend cartoon (the Mad Hatter’s Tea Party), with Alice herself the fixed point in an ever-changing landscape.\n\nThe supporting characters are beautifully sketched. Sterling Holloway’s Cheshire Cat is a highlight, honeyed tones turning Alice’s words dreamily back on her, even while the presence of the Cat is both a reassurance and a liability. The Dodo (who seems to evoke George Washington of all people, and also voiced by Thompson) is officious and distracted; the Caterpillar (Richard Haydn), despite the troubling Orientalism of the music, is hookah-fuelled and scathing; and the magnificent Queen of Hearts (Verna Felton) is a towering, terrifying, breathtaking creation. Boiling over with incandescent rage, and repeatedly instigating the dragging off of playing cards to be beheaded, she’s a wonderfully unpredictable villain and offset by the ridiculousness of everything around her; yet also made more terrifying by the Fantasia-like anonymous army of playing cards that begins chasing Alice through a maze."
