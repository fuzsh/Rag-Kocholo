He is best known for his work at Walt Disney Productions.\n\nBiography[]\n\nGeronimi was born in Chiavenna, Italy, immigrating to the United States as a young child. Geronimi's earliest work in the animation field was for the J.R. Bray Studios, where he worked with Walter Lantz. Upon the dissolution of the Bray Studio in 1928, Geronimi followed Lantz to his own studio, Walter Lantz Productions, producing Cartoons for Universal Pictures. Geronimi left Lantz in 1931 to join Walt Disney Productions, where he remained until 1959. Geronimi started off in the shorts department as an animator, eventually becoming a director. His 1941 short, Lend a Paw, won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.\n\nGeronimi moved into directing feature-length animated films after the end of World War II, mainly working for Walt Disney Productions. He was one of the directors on Bambi, Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Lady and the Tramp, Sleeping Beauty, and One Hundred and One Dalmatians.\n\nAfter Geronimi left Disney in 1959, he worked in television for a number of years (mostly at UPA), including directing many episodes of the 1967 animated Spider-Man series. He retired from animation sometime in the late 1960s, and provided illustrations for children's books.\n\nGeronimi received the 1978 Winsor McCay Award from the International Animated Film Society, ASIFA-Hollywood, for his lifetime of contributions to the animation field. The award was presented by his long-time friend and colleague Walter Lantz. Geronimi was also posthumously inducted as a Disney Legend on July 14, 2017.\n\nIn 2019, Sleeping Beauty was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[1]\n\nGeronimi died on April 24, 1989 at his home in Newport Beach, California, aged 87.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nShorts[]\n\nWalter Lantz Productions period[]\n\nThe Pied Piper (Short) (assistant animator) (1924)\n\nThe Giant Killer (Short) (assistant animator) (1924)\n\nThe Magic Lamp (Short) (assistant animator) (1924)\n\nDinky Doodle in a Restaurant (Short) (assistant animator) (1925)\n\nDinky Doodle in the Circus (Short) (assistant animator) (1925)\n\nHow the Camel Got His Hump (Short) (assistant animator) (1925)\n\nDinky Doodle in the Hunt (Short) (assistant animator) (1925)\n\nHow the Bear Got His Short Tail (Short) (assistant animator) (1925)\n\nDinky Doodle and the Bad Man (Short) (assistant animator) (1925)\n\nHow the Elephant Got His Trunk (Short) (assistant animator) (1925)\n\nJust Spooks (Short) (assistant animator) (1925)\n\nThe Babes in the Woods (Short) (assistant animator) (1925)\n\nThree Bears (Short) (assistant animator) (1925)\n\nRobinson Crusoe (Short) (assistant animator) (1925)\n\nMagic Carpet (Short) (assistant animator) (1925)\n\nPeter Pan Handled (Short) (assistant animator) (1925)\n\nThe House That Dinky Built (Short) (assistant animator) (1925)\n\nCinderella (Short) (assistant animator) (1925)\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood (Short) (assistant animator) (1925)\n\nThe Cat's Nine Lives (Short) (animator) (1926)\n\nThe Pig's Curly Tail (Short) (animator and writer) (1926)\n\nDinky Doodle in the Army (Short) (assistant animator) (1926)\n\nDog Gone It (Short) (assistant director) (1926)\n\nThe Magician (Short) (assistant animator) (1926)\n\nDinky Doodle's Little Orphan (Short) (assistant animator) (1926)\n\nDinky Doodle's Bed Time Story (Short) (assistant animator) (1926)\n\nWild-West (Short) (assistant animator) (1926)\n\nThe Ostrich's Plumes (Short) (assistant animator) (1926)\n\nDinky Doodle in Egypt (Short) (assistant animator) (1926)\n\nThe King of Beasts (Short) (assistant animator) (1926)\n\nThe Arctic (Short) (assistant animator) (1926)\n\nDinky Doodle in Lost and Found (Short) (assistant animator) (1926)\n\nDinky Doodle in Uncle Tom's Cabin (Short) (assistant animator) (1926)\n\nHow the Giraffe Got His Long Neck (Short) (assistant animator) (1926)\n\nThe Goat's Whiskers (Short) (assistant animator) (1926)\n\nHyena's Laugh (animator) (1926)\n\nLunch Hound (animator) (1927)\n\nMars (Short) (animator) (1930)\n\nAlaska (Short) (animator) (1930)\n\nAfrica (Short) (animator) (1930)\n\nMexico (Short) (animator) (1930)\n\nThe Navy (Short) (animator) (1930)\n\nThe Fowl Ball (Short) (animator) (1930)\n\nThe Detective (Short) (animator) (1930)\n\nThe Singing Sap (Short) (animator) (1930)\n\nCold Feet (Short) (animator and writer) (1930)\n\nSnappy Salesman (Short) (animator and writer) (1930)\n\nHenpecked (Short) (animator and writer) (1930)\n\nSpooks (Short) (animator and writer) (1930)\n\nNot So Quiet (Short) (animator and writer) (1930)\n\nMy Pal Paul (Short) (animator and writer) (1930)\n\nHells Heels (Short) (animator and writer) (1930)\n\nHot for Hollywood (Short) (animator and writer) (1930)\n\nThe Prison Panic (Short) (animator and writer) (1930)\n\nThe Hunter (Short) (animator) (1931)\n\nKentucky Belles (Short) (animator) (1931)\n\nRadio Rhythm (Short) (animator) (1931)\n\nThe Stone Age (Short) (animator and artist) (1931)\n\nNorthwoods (Short) (animator) (1931)\n\nThe Bandmaster (Short) (animator) (1931)\n\nCountry School (Short) (animator) (1931)\n\nSunny South (Short) (artist) (1931)\n\nThe Fireman (Short) (animator) (1931)\n\nThe Farmer (Short) (animator) (1931)\n\nWhat a Doctor!
