        "text": "VIDEO and AUDIO\n\n101 Dalmatians sports fantastic picture quality on Blu-ray. The 1.37:1 Academy Ratio visuals stay true to the film's original look, while gaining the detail, clarity, and vibrancy you expect of a Disney high definition release. Gladly, this movie does not suffer from any of the issues that plague fellow '60s 'toon The Sword in the Stone. Nor does its framing prompt any concerns about the accuracy of its aspect ratio. No matter how closely you're looking, you won't notice a single unintended flaw (the TV programs watched have imperfections by design, as broadcasts did back then).\n\nThe default soundtrack is presented in 7.1 DTS-HD master audio. This remix does not boast a tremendous amount of directionality and\n\nnothing that feels like a betrayal to the film's original monaural sound design. Happily, Disney does right by purists by including an alternate English soundtrack resembling the original theatrical experience in Dolby Digital 1.0 mono. You can't go wrong with either track, with the 7.1 mix doing a nice job of distributing the different elements but the mono one still keeping dialogue crisp and audible at all times.\n\nThere is the option on Blu-ray to watch the movie with DisneyView bars making up the difference between the film's squarish aspect ratio and the format's native 16:9 frame. New ambient artwork created by longtime Disney background and landscape artist Michael Humphries changes frequently to match the film's visuals in color and tone. DisneyView remains a well-intentioned but truly unnecessary feature, which requires inordinate distraction by and objection to the vertical black bars on the sides of your television being replaced to appreciate.\n\nBONUS FEATURES\n\nThe Blu-ray's four new HD bonus features begin with \"The Further Adventures of Thunderbolt\" (1:46), a tasteful new black and white animated short expanding the TV serial the Dalmatians are seen watching in the film.\n\n\"Lucky Dogs\" (9:08) collects new comments from yesteryear Disney employees including Rolly Crump, Floyd Norman, Burny Mattinson, Carmen Sanderson, and Lisa Davis, the voice of Anita. Complemented by views of real Dalmatians running around the studio, they recall the technical specifics of making Dalmatians.\n\nThe fluffy \"411 on 101\" (5:20) allows Cameron Boyce (of Disney Channel's \"Jessie\" and upcoming Descendants in which he'll play Carlos De Vil, son of Cruella) to give us five reasons why 101 Dalmatians is the best dog-gone Disney dog movie ever. It's pretty obnoxious, but some fun facts are revealed and maybe the tweens it's aimed at will enjoy it.\n\nNext we get a full episode of \"Walt Disney Presents\" titled \"The Best Doggoned Dog in the World\" (51:05). This black and white 1961 broadcast from Walt Disney's long-running, weekly anthology series promotes the then-upcoming 101 Dalmatians for about fifteen minutes. Before and after that, it celebrates dogs, from seeing eye dogs and trackers to avalanche dogs and sheep herding dogs. As a 1960s television program, it is fascinating, especially the parts in which Walt shares the screen with a dalmatian. But it's also a bit of an endurance challenge, since people in the '60s clearly had much greater attention spans (and fewer media options) than we do today. An earlier version of this episode aired in 1957 and devoted partly to promoting Old Yeller accompanies that live-action classic on DVD.\n\nThe remaining extras, encoded in standard definition (and most of them also letterboxed within the 1.33:1 frame) fall under the header Classic Bonus Features and all of them appeared on the film's 2008 Platinum Edition DVD.\n\n\"Redefining the Line: The Making of One Hundred and One Dalmatians\" can be seen as seven subject-specific shorts or a single 34-minute documentary. It's a good, if ordinary, overview of production which rounds up the usual Disney and Pixar animators to sing praises and a handful of historians to contextualize. Though it supplies insightful stories and lots of information, the piece seems to struggle to find aspects unique to Dalmatians worth discussing.\n\nStill, the contemporary setting, Bill Peet's single-handed story treatment, the shortage of music, contributions of specific animators, and the xerography technique are all remarked upon and to some level of interest. Now in their eighth year of making these types of DVD retrospectives, it seems like Disney could use a little inspiration in this department and stands to improve on this fine but not so fresh fragmented formula.\n\n\"Cruella De Vil: Drawn to Be Bad\" (7:07) brings back many of the present-day animators to gush over 101 Dalmatians' villain. Their praise is divided between author Dodie Smith, story man Bill Peet, animator Marc Davis, voice actress Betty Lou Gerson, and live-action reference model Mary Wickes. It's a short but appropriate and sustaining bonus.\n\n\"Sincerely Yours, Walt Disney\" (12:35) is a fun piece which documents a series of correspondences between Walt and author Dodie Smith regarding the production of the adaptation. It's aided by the use of actors who visually complement the selective letter readings. Smith's concerns and reactions are interesting, as are Disney's responses, while a narrator serves to contextualize the exchanges and 101 with other activities occupying Walt's time back then.\n\n101 Dalmatians is the rare Disney animated film whose marketing campaign gets preserved for general consumption. First, a Trailers & TV Spots section includes a trailer, TV spot, and CinemaScope-formatted teaser from 1961, a theatrical trailer and two TV spots plus a third promoting a double feature with Swiss Family Robinson from 1969, three TV spots (one of them, French-Canadian) and a trailer from 1979, and a trailer from Christmas 1985.\n\nAnother section holds twelve promotional radio spots (three from the original 1961 theatrical release, six from a 1969 reissue, and three from a 1979 reissue), but sorely lacks a \"Play All\" feature, especially since ads run as short as ten seconds.\n\nFinally, a Music & More section starts with the music video for Selena Gomez's 2008 cover of \"Cruella De Vil\" (3:20), which balances predictable singer-against-spots footage with movie clips and scenes from a less expected fashion runway setting. The song aspires to a Hannah Montana sound, complete with electronic trickery and generic interpretation.\n\nAlso here is the deleted number \"March of the One Hundred and One\" (2:29), which is recorded by the cast and played within context to story sketches (1:55).\n\nIt is followed by two Abandoned Songs: an alternate, longer newly-recorded version\n\ncalled \"Cheerio, Good-Bye, Toodle-oo, Hip Hip!\" (2:30) that's set up by Disney historian Russell Schroeder, in which the puppies sing with excitement about going to London for Christmas. Next comes \"Don't Buy a Parrot from a Sailor\" (2:39), an English pub chantey that was to be performed by henchmen Horace and Jasper.\n\nThe remaining Demo Recordings and Alternate Versions are renditions of music that made the film. \"Dalmatian Plantation\" is heard in a longer, slower cast recording (2:20) and a temp version (1:00) by go-to Disney quartet The Mellomen. A staggering number of options are offered on the most famous song, \"Cruella De Vil.\" There are demos of a \"spooky\" version called \"The Creation of Cruella De Vil\" (4:50) which painfully removes any subtlety from the character's name and a blues ballad version (2:20) which resembles the final product. Roger's brainstorming composing sessions are heard from speaking voice Ben Wright (3:06), singer/dubber Bill Lee with direction (4:30), and in a honky-tonk piano version (1:25). The song comes to an end with three different (but universally annoying) vocal versions (1:11, 2:20, 1:15) of the song as a radio hit. Finally, we get 9 alternate recordings (5:55) of the Kanine Krunchies commercial jingle by Lucille Bliss, performing the tune with such sounds as \"Very Young\", \"Older English\", and \"Eton Boy.\"\n\nKeeping with Disney's tradition of devaluing DVD, the combo pack's secondary disc -- one they apparently aren't even bothering selling on its own -- only includes \"411 on 101\", the Selena Gomez music video, and \"Cruella De Vil: Drawn to Be Bad\" in the way of bonus features.\n\nThe discs open with promos for Disney Movies Anywhere, Aladdin: Diamond Edition, Cinderella (2015), and a Dalmatians-themed anti-smoking PSA. The Sneak Peeks listing plays ads for Disney Movie Rewards, Disney Parks, \"Dog with a Blog\", \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars\" - The Lost Missions, Big Hero 6, and Legend of the Neverbeast.\n\nWHAT'S MISSING?\n\nCompletists will lament that a number of Platinum Edition DVD extras fail to make the leap to Blu-ray here, but it is mostly material you're unlikely to revisit with any frequency. Dropped are the Virtual Dalmatian set-top sampler and its more expansive DVD-ROM version, the Puppy Profiler personality quiz, and two Fun with Language games. More significantly lost are seven art galleries consisting of 248 stills ranging from concept art to production photos and both family and fan modes of playback-enhancing Pop-Up Trivia Facts.\n\nMENUS, PACKAGING and DESIGN\n\nThe main menu surveys the neighborhood, with characters riding by while piano plays. Typical for Disney, the Blu-ray remembers where you left off watching the movie but does not make resuming playback any easier than that, so try not to leave bonus features partially watched.\n\nThe two discs occupy a side-snapped keepcase which is topped by a slipcover giving the reproduced artwork a reflective silver touch. A booklet provides your magic code for the digital copy and another insert promotes the Disney Movie Club.\n\nCLOSING THOUGHTS\n\n101 Dalmatians got one of Disney's lighter Platinum Edition DVDs in terms of content. This Blu-ray adds over an hour of new bonus features, most of it an over 50-year-old television episode that will put many to sleep. The set also drops the art galleries and games found on the movie's two-disc DVD.\n\nAnd yet, this is still a set that is easy to recommend because it clearly provides the finest home video presentation to date of one of Walt Disney's most endearing animated films. Others may prefer the fairy tales with their romance and songs, but this enjoyable canine caper doesn't require a mood or predilection. Its comedy keeps amusing, its story keeps engaging, and its characters keep provoking strong reactions as intended. It's a film you are not likely to outgrow, whether you revisit it around once a decade like the studio or more frequently."
