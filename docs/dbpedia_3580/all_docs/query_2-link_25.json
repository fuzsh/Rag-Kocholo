        "text": "\"I assure you, friends, had you been on the field and witnessed such conditions as I have, you would term it other than bravery or heroism. To have considered one’s own life precious in the face of desperate and dying multitudes would have been utter cowardice\". [1]\n\nThose are the words of Nellie Miller Mann, secretary to the Treasurer of Near East Relief (NER) in Beirut, 1921–1923. A graduate of Goshen College, in Goshen, Indiana, Nellie came in the humble guise of a secretary, willing to take dictation and to type as her contribution to the “most colossal child welfare [undertaking] in the history of the world.” [2] Among the several treasurers under whom she served were Ray F. Bender, of the Mennonite Church, and Stanley Kerr, author of The Lions of Marash.\n\nBesides diligently tending to accounting and correspondence in the office, Nellie had the presence of mind to preserve her tenure with NER by taking photographs, a cherished hobby. She used photography to educate friends and family back home about the conditions she witnessed and those she heard about from co-workers and survivors, never imagining that her photographs would help establish the incontrovertible truth of the ongoing tragedy facing Armenian, Greek, and Syrian refugees.\n\nNellie Miller grew up in Elkhart, Indiana, and attended the Prairie Street Mennonite Church. She graduated from Goshen College in 1921. It might seem improbable that a young secretary would wind up documenting relief work in the Near East until one considers the inspiration for Nellie and other Mennonites to help rebuild cities and lives at the end of the Great War.\n\nThe Mennonite Relief Commission for Wars Sufferers (MRCWS) formed in Nellie’s hometown of Elkhart, Indiana, in 1917. The thought had been to establish a Mennonite mission in the Near East. However, an expedition made it evident that existing infrastructure adequately supported ongoing relief work. Thus, the Mennonite Church thought it wiser to cooperate with NER instead of establishing an independent endeavor. [3]\n\nThat this relief commission was born in Elkhart harkens back to the support of several missionaries from north-central Indiana, beginning with Rose Lambert in 1898. She founded the United Orphanage and Mission in Hadjin, Turkey. Her sister Norah had attended Nellie’s church as a young girl, and Nora, too, had taken courses at Goshen College. In late 1914, at the start of the war, all of Elkhart waited news of Norah’s safe return after a perilous escape from Everek, Turkey. [4] Just five years before those apprehensive days, Nora’s older sister Rose made headlines during the siege of Hadjin in 1909 when anti-Armenian massacres erupted throughout the vilayet of Adana. [5]\n\nBesides the courageous Lambert sisters, there was Adeline Brunk who came from Elkhart. She died in Hadjin only six weeks after her arrival. Henry Maurer, one of two Americans killed during the Adana Massacres, lived in Goshen before he went to Hadjin. Katherine Bredemus, from nearby South Bend, was yet another missionary from northern Indiana who served the United Orphanage and Mission, assisting orphans in Hadjin and in Cyprus.\n\nWhen Nellie was fourteen years old (1911), the Prairie Street Mennonite Church welcomed as speakers Rose Lambert and her guest Bishop Moushegh Seropian, ex-Prelate of Adana. According to the local paper, Elkhart had “of late years been much interested in the welfare of the Armenians,” and expressed the hope “that the opportunity they […] had of seeing and hearing Bishop Seropian” would leave a lasting impression. [6] Nine years later, Katherine Bredemus who had returned to Hadjin after the Armistice, was trapped there amidst the final, fateful battle of that Armenian town. South Bend Times reported the disturbing circumstances. [7] At that time, Bredemus worked among the repatriated orphans.\n\nPerhaps the event at her church in 1911 made a profound impression on Nellie. Most certainly, the heritage of Elkhart’s support of Armenian orphans and several Indiana missionaries played an important role in shaping her decision to set out for the Near East as a relief worker.\n\nAt the end of World War One and at the direction of French authorities of occupied Cilicia, Armenian orphans were gathered and resettled in their native towns, many having been rescued from the homes of Turks, Kurds and Arabs. [8] Nellie’s arrival in Beirut in 1921 came only weeks before the Ankara Accord in which the French ceded to Turkey the very places to which orphans had been returned in 1919. The herculean task of safely evacuating several thousand children was about to begin. [9]\n\nIn November 1921, the month following the Turkish-French agreement, Nellie’s correspondence begins recording the influx of Armenian refugees fleeing Turkey. Letters during 1922 express ongoing concern for nearly 7,000 orphans in Ayntab, Marash, Mardin, Diarbekir, Ourfa and Harput/Kharpert. “Still 1,200 orphans in Marash,” she wrote on 19 February. [10] By mid-April, 300 Marash orphans and 130 orphans at Ourfa had been safely removed. The Turkish government would not allow the mass evacuation of the children. Therefore, relief workers were forced to “send out several with each family that comes out,” Nellie had explained in an earlier letter. [11] Finally, the Turkish government granted permission for the departure of all Armenian orphans, which set the mass evacuations into motion.\n\nAccording to Nellie, a truck drove from Ourfa—where orphans from other stations were being gathered—to Jerablus. Many trips had to be made since the truck could transport only 20 children at a time. In Jerablus, the children boarded a train to Aleppo. Once in Aleppo, they slept before taking the 5:00 a.m. train to Beirut, not arriving there until midnight. Day after day, NER workers met these groups of beleaguered children and transferred them to the Ghazir (Lebanon) Orphanage as a temporary measure. [12]\n\nThe overwhelming task of safely conveying thousands of Armenian orphans and the valiant work of sheltering, educating and nurturing them was all vividly chronicled by the sensitive and astute secretary to the NER Treasurer in the Beirut office. Nellie both photographed and developed (in an improvised darkroom) her collection of over 200 photographs. Although she did not travel inside Turkey, she is to be credited with preserving pictures that others took at their stations in the interior.\n\nDavid Mann recently paid this tribute to his mother: “She was a gifted and humble person with a desire and commitment to serve a group of people in great need. The fact that she left [for Beirut] while engaged to my father says something of her spirit of service and mission.”\n\nMost of these photographs were provided by the Mann family who donated all of Nellie's photos (over 200) to the Mennonite Church USA Archives in Elkhart, Indiana. In this page, we present only a handful of the photographs available at the archive, many of which were also used by Near East Foundation on its website.\n\nIn the Open Digital Archive section of our website, we usually present archives from family collections. However, in this page we make an exception and present the photographs of an American Near East Relief worker because her photographs concern the life of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. Such micro-histories and materials, just like all the materials in the Open Digital Archive, also help to revive traces of this past life.\n\nOur sincere thanks to Rosemary Russell for the preparation of this page."
