Between 1984 and March 2001, the area was the location of the 1921 Self Defense Battle of Aintab Memorial. The Fountain -Memorial is now located adjacent to the Self Defense Battle of Aintab Memorial. Commemorative Activities:Every April 24 and at the beginning of every September,people come to visit the Fountain -Memorial to honor those who perished during the Armenian Genocide."
