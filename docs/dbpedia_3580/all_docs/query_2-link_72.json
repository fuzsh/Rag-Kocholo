SMITH, CHAIRMAN, COMMISSION ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE Mr. Smith. The Commission will come to order and good afternoon to everybody. Welcome to our witnesses and everyone joining us for today's hearing marking 100 years since the start of the Armenian Genocide--one of the most terrible crimes of the 20th century. The Armenian Genocide is the only one of the genocides of the 20th century in which the nation that was decimated by genocide has been subjected to the ongoing outrage of a massive campaign of genocidal denial, openly sustained by state authority. This campaign of genocide denial is a slap in the face to the Armenian people, preventing reconciliation and healing. As Pope Francis said so eloquently at his Mass marking the 100th time period of the genocide, quote, ``Concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it.'' In September 2000 I chaired the first congressional hearing on the Armenian Genocide. It was a four-hour hearing and the testimony I heard that day, and many accounts of the atrocities I have read in the articles and books over the years before and since, including the eyewitness account ``Ambassador Morgenthau's Story,'' have shocked me deeply. The facts were reported throughout the world as they were happening, corroborated immediately afterward by survivors and even some perpetrators, and have been amply documented by historians, including in a number of recent books. In 1915, there were about 2 million Armenians living in what was then the Ottoman Empire. They were living in a region that they had inhabited for 2,500 years. By 1923, well over 90 percent of these Armenians had disappeared. Most of them, as many as 1.5 million, were dead. Some even say the estimates are higher. Most of them were death-marched into the desert or shot and in some cases raped and other unbelievable cruelties were meted out against men, women and children. The remainder, the remnant, was forced into exile. When the term genocide was invented in 1944 to describe the systematic destruction of an entire people, its author Raphael Lemkin explained the term by saying, quote, ``it was the sort of thing Hitler did to the Jews and the Turks did to the Armenians,'' close quote. Since the facts are so well- established, this is not a hearing only to inquire into the events of 1915. Rather it's also a hearing on what has happened since and is still happening today--genocide denial. Sadly, the Turkish Government has driven this campaign of denial, and has done so over a course of decades using a variety of means to punish Turkish citizens who dared to acknowledge the crimes committed by the Ottoman government in 1915 and thereafter. The Turkish Government has also threatened other countries to keep them from acknowledging the genocide. Ironically, it is only the Turkish Government's campaign of denial that obliges other countries to recognize the genocides officially. And the Turkish Government underwrites a disinformation campaign to confuse the historical record. It also tries to relativize the Ottoman government's crimes, sometimes by changing the subject to the wartime sufferings of Turks or crimes committed by individual Armenians. This is in no sense a hearing that's designed to be against Turkey. Rather, I consider it a hearing that supports the Turkish people. Today many people in Turkey are in the process of freeing themselves from the effects of decades of denialist propaganda by their government. Many already see through the official denialism and some oppose it openly, and some have paid a price. I want to support and express my admiration for these people--for their courage, and for their Turkish patriotism. They act, sometimes at grave personal risk to themselves, for the good of their country and out of love for their country. They are thought-leaders. And there are many signs of this. In recent weeks, in the lead up to the 100th anniversary of the genocide, there have been many deeply moving feature stories in the world press about Turks discovering their families' secret Armenian heritage, or seeking to connect with the Armenian aspects of Turkish history, or supporting efforts to rebuild Armenian churches which were also leveled and decimated, as our witnesses will attest to today. I'd like to insert one of those articles, ``Remembering the Armenian Genocide,'' by Victor Gaetan, into the hearing record. And without objection so ordered. No country is immune from evil. We all know that. All governments have been complicit at some point in their history in terrible crimes. And this certainly includes the United States--remember slavery. It also includes Germany. I want to urge the Turkish Government to take the path taken by Germany after World War II. And it was the right one. Germany started with open acknowledgment of the crimes of the Holocaust, and it built from there over a course of decades, establishing relationships with Jewish groups and Israel in which it demonstrated remorse and commitment to righting its wrongs, as far as it could. Now there is a strong German-Israeli friendship. And today Germany is one of the most respected countries in the world. That path is still open to the Turkish Government. And working to put Turkey on it will be the truest, deepest expression of Turkish patriotism. Finally, I must respond to President Obama. On Tuesday his aides met with Armenian leaders and made it clear once again he will not recognize the Armenian Genocide. That is to say, he will not use the word ``genocide.'' This is in direct contradiction to the promises that he made before becoming President. He said, and I would say very eloquently, in 2008, ``I also share with Armenian-Americans--so many of whom are descended from genocide survivors--a principled commitment to commemorating and ending genocide. That starts with acknowledging the tragic instances of genocide in world history. As a U.S. Senator, I have stood with the Armenian- American community in calling for Turkey's acknowledgement of the Armenian Genocide. Two years ago, I criticized the Secretary of State for the firing of U.S. Ambassador to Armenia John Evans after he properly used the term ``genocide''--and he's here today--``to describe Turkey's slaughter of thousands of Armenians starting in 1915.'' ``I shared with Secretary Condoleezza Rice my firmly held conviction that the Armenian Genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence. The facts are undeniable. An official policy that calls on diplomats to distort the historical facts is an untenable policy. As a senator, I strongly support passage of the Armenian Genocide Resolution. And as President I will recognize the Armenian Genocide.'' These are eloquent words that should echo today and ought to be expressed today. With Germany and the European Union lining up to do the right thing, our government needs to do likewise. At this point, according to the Congressional Research Service, the EU states listed as having recognized a genocide are France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Greece, and Cyprus, and the Holy See. The European Parliament has also referred to the deaths of the Armenians as genocide. The non-EU states that have also taken this important step are Argentina, Canada, Chile, Lebanon, Russia, Switzerland, Uruguay, Vatican City, Venezuela. Sadly, after the President's powerful promise, we need that kind of statement to come very clearly and unambiguously from the United States. As mass atrocities unfold in Syria and Iraq, the U.S. needs the Turkish Government to engage constructively with its neighbors. The Turkish Government can do this more effectively after it honestly faces its own past. The President, I think, is missing an opportunity. I'd like to yield to my good friend and colleague, Commissioner Cohen, for any comments he might have. HON. STEVE COHEN, COMMISSIONER, COMMISSION ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I am a proud member of the Helsinki Commission and appreciate the chairman and his works. And I know this is a very special day for the Armenian people-- tomorrow is an anniversary. So it's appropriate that we have a hearing of this sort. I did make a request, and I don't know at what level it was determined, that in historical accuracy or at least in fairness in discussion and determination of what occurred that there should be historians presenting a different perspective. That was not granted. I can understand that, for this is a particularly sensitive moment to Armenian descendants and Armenian people. But at the same time, I think that if we're talking about having a determination of an historical event by a political body at a minimum we should have our ears open to all sides, regardless of what one might think the other side's perspective would be. To hear it would only be fair. I look forward to hearing from all the witnesses today. I wish we could have heard from the other witnesses. And I know that what happened some 100 years ago was atrocious. There were awful, awful, awful things that happened. How you define those events, how you determine what caused them should be the study of historians and scholars, not politicians. But if politicians are going to be involved in trying to make a determination, they should hear from all sides on the issue. I look forward to hearing from you and indeed understand your position and certainly wish that what happened 100 years ago did not happen. And I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Smith. Thank you, Commissioner Cohen. I just would note for the record that tomorrow marks the most solemn day of remembrance any nation can experience. Back in 2000 I put together a hearing. It was on September 14th, 2000. And it was all about the Armenian Genocide. We invited the Turks. We invited the Armenians. They sat at a table not unlike this one. And frankly, the denial--it was sophomoric, to say the least. And the arguments proffered by a distinguished member of the diplomatic corps for Turkey reminded me exactly of the Holocaust deniers. But I would be more than happy to welcome, on another day when the remembrance isn't so acute and so filled with pain and sorrow by the Armenian community, to invite the Turks amd the others, and I will ask them very, very difficult questions, as I did at that hearing. As a matter of fact, to take it one step further, right from the witness table the Turkish leader actually threatened the United States. He and I got into a very significant argument--a NATO ally threatening as he was, is very unprofessional. But I will give my promise that I would look forward to such a day to bring the Turkish side back. Nothing has changed. If anything, the historical record, particularly the archivists in countries, particularly in Europe and United States, the information has become even more one-sided, that this indeed was a genocide. But I will invite them back. But this is a remembrance day. And we have people who know this issue, have done brilliant scholarship on it. So I would--there is a uniqueness to this hearing to have such an array of individuals to speak truth to power, and that includes the United States and the White House. Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen. I thank you. And I understood that was the reason. And I think it's probably--it's appropriate because of the solemnity of the week and of the occasion. There are different issues than history that come into play on the determinations of whether or not to declare an event a genocide or not. Since I've been in Congress, I know some countries have and some feel politicians shouldn't be doing this, it should be somewhere else. But we had hoped that the Turkish Government would come to some rapprochement. And there were some protocols that we at one time thought were going to be pursued and that there would be some type of rapprochement and that never occurred. And Prime Minister Erdogan suggested I think last year he was going to set up a hearing with scholars, and that didn't occur. I wish that such a hearing could be set up because it has gotten more and more difficult to hear promises that don't get followed through and to hear threats both at our government and at the Pope, who is a wonderful gentleman. I yield back my time. Mr. Smith. Thank you very much, Commissioner Cohen. I'd like to now welcome our very distinguished panel, beginning first with Dr. Taner Akcam, professor of history and chair in Armenian Genocide Studies at Clark University. Dr. Akcam is the pre-eminent scholar on the Armenian Genocide and has published widely on the topic. Without objection, all of your full resumes will be made a part of the record and your very distinguished backgrounds. We'll then hear from Mr. Kenneth Hachikian, who's chairman of the Armenian National Committee of America, and Mr. Van Krikorian, who's co-chairman, board of trustees of the Armenian Assembly of America. We'll then hear from Dr. Elizabeth Prodromou, Visiting Associate Professor of Conflict Resolution, the Fletcher School, Tufts University. We'll then hear from Karine Shnorhokian, who is here as a representative of the Genocide Education Project and will speak to us about her family's experience as survivors of the genocide, and as an experienced activist in genocide education. Dr. Akcam, if you could begin. DR. TANER AKCAM, PROFESSOR OF HISTORY, ROBERT ARAM, MARIANNE KALOOSDIAN AND STEPHEN AND MARIAN MUGAR CHAIR IN ARMENIAN GENOCIDE STUDIES, CLARK UNIVERSITY Dr. Akcam. Thank you, Chairman Smith. Thank you very much for inviting me. I would like to begin by thanking you for giving me the opportunity to share my thoughts on the centennial commemoration of the Armenian Genocide. In 2000, when I first visited the United States for a series of lectures, my presence generated a great deal of suspicion among Armenian-Americans. Few could bring themselves to believe that a Turk would even acknowledge the Armenian Genocide. But after 30 years of research on this subject matter, I have gained the confidence of the Armenian community, as well as that of my own countrymen. The Turkey that is best known today is one that is represented by a denialist government, but there is also another Turkey. And the citizens of that Turkey are ready to face their history. We Turks feel obligated to rectify the black stain upon us that was left by those who committed these crimes. At this very moment, in more than 25 cities from Istanbul to Van, people are not waiting for their government to recognize the genocide. Instead, they are blazing a new path-- one that allows them to discover their past. Our history does not simply consist of murderers. It is also a history of brave and righteous people who risked their lives to save thousands of Armenians. When we recognize and honor such persons, we help to create an environment that would encourage others who would act likewise. Why must we Turks, as well as the global community, recognize the Armenian Genocide? The answer, I would suggest to you, is very simple: If we agree to acknowledge and remember the Nazi-perpetrated Holocaust--and I'm confident that most of us feel that remembrance of those crimes is necessary--then we are equally obligated to acknowledge and remember the Armenian Genocide. I believe that this statement stands on its own merits, and that we should ask ourselves: Why is it that the question of recognizing the historicity of the Holocaust is not up for debate within political circles while the Armenian Genocide, despite its recognition within respectable academic circles, still is? Recognition of my country's historic wrongdoings is not a simple opinion or attitude on a past event. Instead, it is directly related the kind of society that we envision for our future. Dehumanization is the most important component of all mass atrocities. In order to be able to kill, perpetrators dehumanize their victims. Recognition is necessary to acknowledge the human dignity of victim. Without recognition, the consequent generations cannot properly mourn and heal. Mourning and healing are necessary for closure and can only come after the truth is acknowledged. If we fail to acknowledge, we fall into a trap that continues to support the perpetrators and their ultimate goals. After decades of denials, Armenians need to heal and to understand that the justice they seek will prevail. If we want reconciliation and the establishment of peace between Turkish and Armenian people, we have to acknowledge the truth. Without truth, there can't be a peace. If Turkey wishes to achieve a democratic, stable society and a vision for a better future, it needs to create an environment that is respectful of human rights. Confronting its past wrongdoing is a critical step towards this future. A hundred years ago, the Ottoman government had a flawed concept of national security. They viewed the Armenians and their demands for equality and social justice as a threat to the Ottoman state and society. Their solution to this problem was to target the Armenian people for extermination. Today, Turkish and Armenian children are taught, through textbooks published by Education Ministry in Turkey, that the Armenians continue to pose a threat to national security. These textbooks are steeped in false narratives about treacherous Armenians. This sounds unbelievable, but unfortunately it is the bare truth. What continues to trouble me is that the United States has not officially recognized the Armenian Genocide. The justification for their position remains the same: National security interests in which Turkey is a critical partner. The argument goes something like this: It would be pointless to anger Turkey and jeopardize American security interests for a moral issue that goes back 100 years. It is ironic that the words, ``national security,'' continue to haunt Armenian people even here in the United States. But juxtaposing national interest and morality as being mutually exclusive is just plain wrong. Any security policy in the Middle East that excludes morality in favor of expediency is likely, in the long run, to undermine national security. Historical injustices are not dead issues; the past has always been the present in the Middle East. Insecurity felt by different groups towards each other as a result of events that have occurred in history is one of the central problems in the region. Kurds, Arabs, Alawites, Armenians and other Christians in the regions perceive each other and Turkey through this flawed prism of history. If we want a real politic to be successful in the region, we have to integrate the acknowledgment of past wrongdoings into any national security policy and to stop using it as an excuse. Turkey's denialism of its past and making it as an essential part of its foreign policy is not simply a moral abomination. It represents a threat to democracy, stability and security not only in Turkey but in the region too. Turkey continues its denialist policies because until now it has not had to contend with serious external pressure to do otherwise. But there is other Turkey of which I spoke earlier. It is a Turkey that is determined to build a tolerant, democratic society ready to face up to the darker history of our country's past and to put an end to the denialist policy. All that is lacking is external pressure from international community. The United States has a choice, but if it continues to support a denialist regime it will endorse this historical mistake. The refusal to recognize past injustices is fundamentally undemocratic and contributes to the destabilization of Turkey and the region. How can the United States, which prides itself on its exceptionalism in supporting liberal values and human rights at home and across the world, justify a position at odds with its own democratic values? America should not uphold human rights only when it's expedient. The test of American exceptionalism is the commitment to persevere in upholding these principles even when it may seem costly or inconvenient to do so. By officially recognizing the Armenian Genocide, the United States could lend its moral and political weight to the cause of encouraging Turkey to come to terms with its history, to further embrace democratization and to contribute to its own future stability and that of the region. The citizens of my Turkey, the other Turkey, are waiting for you to join us in acknowledging the truth. Thank you very much. Mr. Smith. Doctor, thank you so very much for your courage in speaking out. I know you take risk by doing this. And I want you to know that we on this committee and Commission deeply admire how you have stepped up to speak out, and at potential cost to yourself. Thank you so very much for that. I'd like to now ask Mr. Hachikian if you could speak. KENNETH V. HACHIKIAN, CHAIRMAN, ARMENIAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE OF AMERICA Mr. Hachikian. Commissioner Smith--Chairman Smith, excuse me, Commissioner Cohen, thank you for organizing today's Helsinki hearing and for your invitation to share our views on the ongoing costs and consequences of the Republic of Turkey's denial of the truth and obstruction of justice regarding the Armenian Genocide. We all know that the Armenian Genocide is settled history. No serious, objective historian questions the veracity of that characterization. We've seen debate around the false choices presented by Ankara's apologists, calling into question whether America can afford to speak the truth, as if we could ever advance our international interests by compromising our national values. Of course, we know that no foreign country deserves a veto over our human rights policy, a gag rule against our stand against genocide. We must never, ever outsource our nation's moral voice. Most recently, we have seen a cynical campaign by Turkey to silence America's moral voice by arguing against all evidence that the recognition of the Armenian Genocide represents an obstacle to improved Armenian-Turkish relations. That position is akin to saying that postwar Germany's establishment of relations with Israel would have been somehow better served by the world's silence about the Holocaust, or that the path to Hutu-Tutsi reconciliation rests upon a refusal to speak forthrightly about the realities of the Rwandan genocide. There are many aspects to the cost of Armenian Genocide denial--costs to both U.S. interests and American values as well as to international norms. I would like to address just a few of them today. There is, of course, first and foremost, the moral cost. As the Chairman indicated, no one has spoken more powerfully to this aspect than Pope Francis. Earlier this month, he offered a sermon during an Armenian Catholic rite in St. Peter's Basilica. The pontiff, consistent with the Vatican's long standing principled tradition of Armenian Genocide recognition, spoke honestly about this atrocity, telling the world that concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it. The cause of genocide prevention, a core moral imperative of our age, requires, as the Pope so powerfully stated, that we not engage in concealing or denying evil. A second cost of Armenian Genocide denial is the danger to at-risk populations around the world created by Turkey's precedent of a genocide openly committed and unapologetically denied. Perpetrators of subsequent crimes--from Hitler to al- Bashir--have been emboldened by the international community's failure to confront genocide. Just this week, the president of Israel, President Rivlin, said, quote, ``The Nazis used the Armenian Genocide as something that gave them permission to bring the Holocaust into reality.'' There is no more compelling observation than that this week. A third cost of Armenian Genocide denial is the threat it represents to Armenians, a Christian nation with deep connections to the Western tradition and a long history of friendship with the American people. Very simply, Armenia cannot be safe as long as it is bordered by an over-armed, unrepentant perpetrator of genocide. Armenians cannot be secure as long as Turkish schoolchildren are taught that Armenians were traitors, the perpetrators were heroes, and the victims deserving of their fate. A fourth cost is the price the Turkish people pay in terms of their own nation's progress toward greater tolerance and pluralism. A Turkey that fully accepts responsibility for the Armenian Genocide would very likely be one that is on the road to rehabilitation into a post-genocidal state. Sadly, we have seen few official signs of progress on this front. And finally, a fifth cost is the destruction of the rich religious heritage of Anatolia, a cradle of the early Christian faith. As a result of these genocidal crimes, and Ankara's continued obstruction of justice, only a small fraction of the historic Christian presence in Anatolia remains today in modern Turkey. Estimates are that of the well over 2,000 Armenian churches which existed in the early 1900s, far fewer than 50 are functioning today. Perhaps as few as 200 even remain standing. The rest have been ground into dust with the properties illegally confiscated by the government, and only a small fraction of the historic Armenian Christian population that once populated Anatolia remains today in modern Turkey to care for their cultural heritage. As an initial step, Turkey's return of the thousands of church properties it outright stole from Armenians, Assyrians, Greeks, Syriacs and other Christians prior to, during, and after the Armenian Genocide era would represent a meaningful move by the Turkish Government toward accepting its responsibility for a truthful and just resolution of this still-unpunished crime against humanity. It would, as well, mark progress for the cause of international religious freedom in a corner of the world sadly known not for its pluralism, but rather for the depths of its intolerance. We need no look further than ISIS to realize the challenges of religious intolerance. Finally, I must comment on President Obama's statement that will be coming out tomorrow. His ongoing failure to properly acknowledge the Armenian Genocide is nothing short of a moral disgrace and an insult to the victims of genocides worldwide. His failure to honor his word and his submission--and I'm saying submission--to Turkish blackmail is extraordinarily bad policy. He leaves the United States isolated, standing virtually alone with Turkey in the denialist camp. He leaves the United States open to ongoing blackmail from Turkey and any other country who can see the weakness of this administration's moral standing. And finally, it leaves no doubt, sadly, that this President's words, his solemn commitment, his considered promises are simply meaningless and open for reconsideration under pressure from foreign governments. Shame on you, President Obama. It is time for the United States and the rest of the world to stand up to Turkey's shameless blackmail and demand justice for the Armenians--not just for the Armenians, but for all of civilized mankind. Thank you. Mr. Smith. Thank you so much, Mr. Hachikian, for your testimony and your very strong and persuasive words. I'd like to now recognize Mr. Krikorian. VAN Z. KRIKORIAN, CO-CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE ARMENIAN ASSEMBLY OF AMERICA Mr. Krikorian. Thank you, Chairman Smith and Commissioner Cohen. And thank you for agreeing to include my written statement in the record. It's extensive and it addresses some of the issues that denialists and people that would not have the United States use the correct term, Armenian Genocide, deal with. I want to start as I started in the written testimony though, with my sincere thanks to this Commission and this institution and Chairman Smith. My personal experience with the Helsinki Commission goes back to the late 1980s when Armenians were, again, at threat of Genocide by Azerbaijan, and when the threat was to eliminate the Nagorno-Karabakh problem by eliminating the Armenians. That threat still exists. I've been fortunate in my life as the grandson and descendent of genocide survivors, have had several honors. One of the honors that I had was to be part of the official U.S. delegation to the human rights meetings in Moscow, where we heard really the best of the United States standing up for human rights in the Soviet Union. This Commission's work on Nagorno-Karabakh, the independence of Armenia, in 2005 your hearings on religious liberty and religious situation of Christians and Armenians in Turkey were dramatic. And we hope that today's proceedings continue in that vein. The testimony and the facts that were submitted echo what Mr. Hachikian said regarding religious churches, monasteries, Armenian cultural heritage. And it's kind of sad that we're sitting here 10 years later, and while there's been some progress the disrespect that's been shown to our religion and to the Christian religion is still going on. I also at the start want to reflect on this idea that we should let historians decide. I think that, again as my colleague and friend Ken Hachikian said, historians have decided. It would be just as useful to have a commission of historians look at the Armenian Genocide as it would to have one re-examine whether the Earth is flat. The people that run around saying that the Moon landing is a hoax are probably more entitled. And for America and America's history, where our archives alone have 30,000 pages of documents detailing in the regions with photographs, with direct testimony from the perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide what their intent was and how brutal the extermination was, is beyond the pale. It is literally rewriting our history. In the late 1800s and the early 20th century The New York Times distinguished itself--distinguished itself by chronicling the Armenian Genocide--eyewitness reports, facts, all in the newspapers, all in the archives. But Tuesday's New York Times headline I think is one we're going to remember. Tuesday's New York Times headline says: ``White House Acknowledges Armenian Genocide, but Avoids the Term.'' It's absurd. And avoiding the term is fatal. It's fatal in the sense that we know that history repeats itself. And we know that avoiding the term empowers people who are going to commit this crime again. Now, President Obama has used the Armenian term for Armenian Genocide, Meds Yeghern, which I understand can be difficult to pronounce for some. He's described and condemned all of the events, provided a dictionary definition of the Armenian Genocide. He's called on Turkey to deal with its past honestly, as a clear implication that they have not dealt with their past honestly. He's referred back to his prior statements as a senator, where he explicitly and passionately used the term Armenian Genocide and criticized those who would not use it. But since his election as President, he's been misled by false promises and he's bowed to threats from the worst kind of people. This undercuts his credibility and, worst of all, it puts more lives at risk. When we saw that on the same day the United States Government--National Security Adviser Rice and Secretary Kerry--met with the Turkish foreign minister who made his annual--or made the annual trip here to talk about carrots and sticks and the same kind of sticks we heard about in 2000, and they put ISIL on the table, we knew what was coming. Turkey is ISIL's lifeline. There's no denying that either. And the United States, understandably, doesn't want to put American military at risk. But by continuing to bow to this kind of pressure, it just procrastinates and puts off the inevitable. Now, we feel pain at this time of year. We really do. Our relatives are not in marked graves in places where we can visit. We don't know where--my parents never knew her aunts and uncles. They didn't exist. They were gone. Those people lie in unmarked graves in what's now Turkey. That's painful. So when President Obama acknowledges but doesn't use the term, that just deepens the pain even more. We also feel sorry that the kind of courage that leaders who aspire to be world leaders isn't shown. But like other victim groups, and as part of our national character--and I say that in two senses; I was born in the United States and my parents were born in the United States. My wife's grandmother, who was affectionately called Betsy Ross because she was born in the United States, was also Armenian. We're more than resilient enough to rededicate ourselves to continuing the cause of preventing genocide because that's what we've inherited, and it doesn't seem to be going away. My written testimony includes just a brief amount of the legal record and the historical record. In fact, the United States has recognized the Armenian Genocide several times-- President Reagan in 1981, the United States Government in its formal submission to the International Court of Justice. And a brief summary of that is included in the written testimony. Today we're also announcing the opening of the Armenian Genocide Museum of America online--a virtual museum that people can go if they truly want to learn what happened and how to help. What I want to do with the remainder of my time though, is speak again from personal experience, because historical dispute over whether it was a genocide is gone. Yes, there was an advertisement in The Washington Post today referring to Bernard Lewis. Unfortunately, the advertisement did not acknowledge that in prior editions of the same book that they rely on, Bernard Lewis talked about the terrible holocaust in which one and a half million Armenians were slaughtered. It also omitted the fact that in a country like France, where they have laws against genocide denial, in 1995 Bernard Lewis was found guilty of genocide denial. We don't have those kinds of laws here because of our First Amendment, but in countries where they do and people have the opportunity not just to say things because they want to say them or because somebody's paying them to say them or because they're being threatened if they don't say them, they have to back up what they say. President Obama is going to be quoted extensively in these coming days, and not just because of the Pope's statement and the European Parliament's decision and Chancellor Merkel's and the rest of the statements that were referred to, not just because President Putin, with whom a lot of people have issues, has made the kind of statement we would have liked to see the President of United States make--and President Putin is in Armenia at the commemoration, where we wish President Obama was. We're going to read President Obama's quote that the Armenian Genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence. The facts are undeniable. ``An official policy that calls on diplomats to distort the historical facts is an untenable policy.'' ``America deserves''-- and these are his words--``America deserves a leader who speaks truthfully about the Armenian Genocide and responds forcefully to all genocides.'' That's not the quote that I really want to use as the basis, though, for the rest of what I'm going to say. I thought President Obama spoke eloquently in his 2009 inaugural address. And I think it reflects the sentiment that we hold--and not just we as Armenians, but all people of good will who want to see progress in this area--is that we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect. ``To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society's ills on the West, know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand to you if you are willing to unclench your fist.'' Today the president of Turkey shows no respect. He sows conflict. He blames society's ills on the West. He is destructive. He clings to power through deceit. He silences dissent. He's on the wrong side of history in denying the Armenian Genocide and many other areas. How much would it take for President Erdogan to show respect for the unmarked graves of our ancestors and the unmarked graves of other Christians who were slaughtered during this period? Instead, he cynically scheduled a commemoration of the Battle of Gallipoli on April 24th, outside the usual date, just to divert countries from participating in the Armenian commemoration. And then, he had the gall to criticize the Armenians for choosing April 24th as their commemoration date. The truth is, we didn't choose April 24th. Mr. Erdogan's predecessors did when they decided to start the killing on that day. The president of Turkey has again threatened to expel the Armenians living in Turkey. Last year, he stated it's ugly to be called an Armenian. He conflated Muslim deaths during the war with no relation to Armenians with the deaths of Armenian victims--just as discredited deniers used to do in the early 1990s to claim mutual losses and no real victim group. In the city of Kars, an artist trying to promote Turkey-Armenian reconciliation put up a statute. In 2011, then-Prime Minister Erdogan had it torn down. Last month, thankfully, the court found for the artist and ordered President Erdogan to pay roughly $3,800 in damages. My testimony goes on--my written testimony goes on more and more about the bad faith that's being shown. But the truth is, as Professor Akcam has said, Armenians are willing to extend a hand if Turkey unclenches its fist. Armenia has had three presidents since 1991. Each has offered without condition to normalize relations with Turkey. In 2009, President Sargsyan took a bold and courageous step--and a lot of people didn't agree with at all--to normalize relations based on the protocols. After ratification, those agreements would have established diplomatic relations, reopened the border, and established mechanisms to resolve multiple issues between the countries, including the outstanding legal issues that need to be resolved. The protocols represented a breakthrough. Turkey didn't ratify them. Azerbaijan vetoed them. Now, to try to be brief and summarize, because I could go on, I want to speak from some other personal experience. After those 2000 hearings, in 2001 a Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission was formed. And I participated in it actively. Our initial job was just to last one year and come up with joint recommendations to the governments. The genocide issue hung over our situation. The same ambassador who appeared before you, Chairman Smith, was on that commission. And he insisted that we have a legal hearing. And the International Center for Transitional Justice facilitated that. Ted Sorensen was on the panel, Alex Boraine, who had been the vice chairman of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission was on the panel. And we had a hearing. We had a hearing. The Turkish side brought their lawyers. They brought Ambassador Aktan. I actually had Samantha Power as my first witness. And she was eloquent and persuasive and authoritative. And we'll always appreciate that. They issued an opinion in 2003 that found the Armenian experience met all of the elements of genocide. And they made that finding not based on any disputed facts or disputed history, but essentially Turkish sources. In fact, if we are to look at history we should understand that the Turkish Government itself tried and convicted the leaders of the Armenian Genocide for the extermination of the Armenian people, and referred to the orders of the Central Committee, which included direct references to their intent and the plan to exterminate the Armenian people. That Turkish ambassador, Gunduz Aktan, as Professor Akcam noted, has passed away. And even though it was rare for us to agree, I can say that he earned a measure of respect from us, even though we disagreed on so much, because he made sure that that study was correctly translated in Turkish and had it published. He didn't want to do that, but he did it because he kept his word. When we look at President Erdogan today and we see not even close to that level of honor. I am going to skip to the end because I do understand that I have exceeded my time, and I appreciate it. We understand-- actually, we had another anecdote that had one incidence, in a commission where one of our Turkish colleagues looked at us and said: You don't know how badly it makes us feel to say that we committed genocide. And one of our Armenian colleagues looked back and him and said--it was former Armenian Foreign Minister Arzumanian--said, well, how do you think it makes us feel to have been genocided? Those kinds of exchanges have to continue. There needs to be support for that kind of dialogue. And that reconciliation is not going to take place unless there is recognition by the United States. We understand that nobody wants to be branded as a criminal, and we're not painting an entire race with that brush at all. And we know there were courageous Turks that saved Armenians. The lawyer Raphael Lemkin, who came up with the term Armenian Genocide, asked: ``Why is the killing of a million a lesser crime than the killing of a single individual?'' The philosopher George Santayana provides a response: ``Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' I have a lot to thank you for, but I'm really going to thank you for letting me go over my time. And I'll conclude here, Chairman Smith. Thank you. Mr. Smith. Thank you so very, very much. We are joined by Senator Whitehouse, and I understand he has to be back to the Senate at about 3:00. Senator, if you'd like to make any comments or wait to the end? HON. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, COMMISSIONER, COMMISSION ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE Mr. Whitehouse. Well, I'm very pleased to be here and have a chance to participate in this very important hearing. I congratulate my fellow members of the Helsinki Commission for holding it. Now is the right time to address this issue, and it's long overdue that the facts and truth of what took place a century ago now be recognized. It's not just a question of truth and it's not just a question of candor, it's also a question of this being a very important step to preventing things like this from happening again. So I think we all have a very common stake in this. If I may ask unanimous consent that a full statement be admitted for the record, I'll---- Mr. Smith. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Whitehouse. ----end my comments, then, and allow us to go back to this very learned and articulate panel. Mr. Smith. Thank you, Senator. Mr. Whitehouse. Thank you, Chairman. Mr. Smith. Without objection, your full statement will be made a part of the record. I'd like to now introduce Dr. Prodromou, if she could proceed. DR. ELIZABETH H. PRODROMOU, VISITING ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION, THE FLETCHER SCHOOL, TUFTS UNIVERSITY Dr. Prodromou. Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, good afternoon. Thank you for the invitation to brief you here today on this very important subject. I respectfully request that my written comments, from which I'll draw for this testimony, be entered into the Congressional Record. Mr. Smith. Without objection, yours and all other statements, and--as well as any extraneous materials you'd like to add, articles or whatever, will be made a part of the record. Dr. Prodromou. Thank you. As a former Commissioner and Vice Chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and as a member of the Secretary of State's Advisory Group on Religion and U.S. Foreign Policy, I'm particularly heartened by this hearing, and I want to applaud you and to thank you for holding this hearing today. Given that the hearing aims to explore what the U.S. and other countries can do to help bring about recognition and eventually reconciliation, and given that this hearing also takes into account the importance and implications of U.S. recognition of the Armenian Genocide for U.S.-Turkey relations and more generally for the broader Transatlantic Alliance, I am going to focus my remarks on two general points. First, I'd like to talk a bit about the architecture of genocide denial and the ideology of denialism because their logic and operation are oftentimes overlooked in terms of the pernicious, insidious, corrosive effects that they have on the kinds of foundational freedoms to which this Commission is dedicated to protect and to uphold, as well as on the kinds of foundational freedoms that inform the Constitution of the United States of America and our foreign policy. And secondly, I'd like to consider the negative effects of genocide denial on Turkey's behavior and the corrosive consequences for U.S.-Turkey relations, as well as for Turkey's relationship with its Transatlantic partners. And then finally, I'll conclude with some brief thoughts about what the U.S. and other countries might do to end Turkey's policy of denialism, and therefore to facilitate a move towards a durable, sustainable Turkish-Armenian reconciliation. In terms of the architecture of genocide denial and the logic of denialism: As we all know, there's overwhelming, comprehensive and incontrovertible evidence, all of which is, in fact, available to the members of this Commission, that demonstrates the Ottoman Turkish government's deliberate intention to systematically exterminate 1.5 million Armenian Christians as well as between 1.2 and 1.5 million Assyrian and Greek Christians at the start of the 20th century. In a word, there was intentionality, there was a plan, and it was implemented, unfortunately with tragic efficiency in terms of outcome. This is what's called genocide. And there are endless eyewitness accounts, including those by survivors--by U.S. officials at the time, including U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire Henry Morgenthau, U.S. Consul General in Smyrna George Horto among them; memoirs and papers of Ottoman Turkish government perpetrators; and a rich corpus of archival, scholarly and legal research and materials--all of which name the Meds Yeghern, the ``Great Crime,'' for what it was, the crime of genocide. However, an entire industry has arisen, cutting across government and academic and media and political lobby lines, funded by the Turkish state and its supporters, that is premised on the denial of those facts on the ground. The denial industry has constructed an architecture of denial and an ideology of denialism that rests on very simple principles and logics, but which we oftentimes overlook and of which we are not aware--simply, to emphasize ambiguity and lack of clarity; to obfuscate, distort and politicize the empirical evidence, towards a simple goal--to create controversy over the veracity of the events that constituted the Armenian Genocide, to create interpretive disagreements, to create a question about interpretation, and eventually to use these controversies about interpretation and veracity to uphold the Turkish Government's unrelenting commitment to denial of the Armenian Genocide. So the ideology of denialism depends on focusing discussion and actions on the controversy rather than on the event. So it's the controversy and interpretative differences that are used to delegitimize those who claim that genocide occurred and to disregard the incontrovertible evidence. Furthermore, the ideology of genocide depends on using all manner of tactics--threats, warnings, demands, retribution, punishment--to censor and to silence and to control freedoms of conscience, thought, speech and the press. So again, claims of genocide are either eventually defeated by a focus on the controversy, or by attrition and exhaustion. Make no mistake: genocide denial is a totalitarian enterprise. And as Peter Balakian has pointed out, it's the continuation of genocide. Genocide denial is the final stage of genocide. Others have called this memoricide. Now, the genocide denial industry has been deployed by Turkey to pressure the United States into not recognizing the Armenian Genocide, to ensure that a congressional resolution on the Armenian Genocide is not passed, and to ensure that no sitting American President speaks out about the Armenian Genocide by using the ``G-word.'' And all of my fellow panelists have spoken to this. The working premise of the genocide denial approach has long been to warn the United States that recognition would lead to either the permanent rupture or permanent disrepair of U.S. -Turkish relations, and therefore would undermine U.S. strategic interests and geostrategic priorities and the capacity of the Transatlantic Alliance to execute its strategic operations. Furthermore, Turkey has used genocide denial to argue that recognition by the U.S. would undermine forward movement in Turkey's domestic democratization process, and would weaken what was once referred to as, quote, ``a model for Muslim democracy'' or, quote, ``a secular democracy and NATO ally.'' Now, I'd like to examine this claim here. In reality, by succumbing to the logic of the ideology of denial, U.S. policymakers have actually contributed to the emboldening of a politics of impunity and a culture of intolerance in both Turkey's domestic and foreign policy. And again, my fellow panelists have spoken about this. Let me take each point in order. How does genocide denial as an ideology and an architecture embolden the kinds of behaviors that are associated with violence and intolerance in Turkey? Well, let's take a look at the reality in Turkey when it comes to its Christian populations today. What we see is the near elimination of any Christian presence in Turkey today. Genocide, by the way, also includes annihilation of peoples and eradication of culture, so let me speak to that in terms of present-day Turkey. Christians in Turkey today comprise less than 1 percent of the total population, and their decline has been the result of combined policies of violence: pogroms, individual attacks, with direct support and indirect complicity of the Turkish state; perpetrators not being brought to justice; economic disenfranchisement, including a very arbitrary property rights regime and labor restrictions; as well as a policy of destruction of religious sites and conversion of religious sites into mosques. In Turkey today, there are approximately 50,000 to 60,000 Armenian Orthodox Christians, 25,000 Assyrian Orthodox Christians, less than 2,000 Greek Orthodox Christians, and maybe 5,000 to 6,000 Roman Catholic and Protestant Christians. The logic of denialism messages to Turkey that there can be action with impunity against Christians and other minority populations in Turkey. And so the logic of denialism has, in fact, facilitated Turkey's ongoing behaviors towards its Christian minority populations and towards others--and towards other non-Musim and non-Christian minority populations in Turkey as well. The rise of crude anti-Semitism, for example, in Turkey has been consequent to the logic of denialism and the failure to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide--again, by messaging to Turkey that there is no accountability when it comes to either discourse or practical actions of violence, intolerance and bigotry. And we see ever-greater usage of terms like ``dhimmi'' and ``gavour'' in Turkey today, ``dhimmi'' being a very pejorative term for non-Muslims and ``gavour'' being a term meaning ``infidels.'' The emergence of that kind of language, as well as, as I said, the expansion of anti-Semitic language and practices in Turkey today, is directly related to the perpetuation of this logic of denialism, which messages that there is no accountability for a culture that uses bigotry and a politics that uses bigotry and intolerance. Furthermore, we see the emboldening of similar behaviors in Turkish foreign policy as a result of subscribing to this logic of denialism. Perhaps the most chilling case of the consequences of the denialist architecture has been in terms of Turkey's unfettered, systematic and near-complete religious cleansing in Turkish- occupied Cyprus. Today, there are less than 400, mainly elderly Christians in Turkish-occupied Cyprus after 41 years of Turkish military occupation. More than 500 Armenian, Greek and Maronite churches, cemeteries and religious sites have been desecrated and demolished, converted into mosques, stables, public toilets, casinos, hotels, and military storage and administration sites. The same goes for the desecration of Jewish religious sites/cemeteries. The Armenian--one of the most important Armenian monasteries in Turkish-occupied Cyprus is finally being allowed to be used for picnics, not for religious worship. The Turkish occupation authorities will allow an occasional picnic and a sandwich, but not a Liturgy. This, again, grows out of the logic of denialism--again, no accountability, so applying the same kind of violations of human rights that were the genocide in terms of present-day foreign policy behaviors is what we see in this case. In terms of undermining democratization inside Turkey, here again we see the logic of denialism at work. The demonstrated willingness of civil society groups, attorneys, media, intellectuals, and average citizens to recognize and talk about the Armenian Genocide as a necessary step towards sustainable reconciliation inside Turkey and towards a broader Turkey- Armenia normalization is, again, something that Dr. Akcam spoke about. However, by subscribing and supporting the logic of denialism, those openings and those possibilities are suffocated. The rollback in media freedoms today in Turkey-- press, social media such as Twitter and Facebook--as well as the rollback and the limitations on speech and conscience freedoms--for example, through a more expansive application of Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code, by which insulting Turkishness now also includes Islamist blasphemy dimensions, but also speech about Armenian Genocide--this rollback in the last several years in Turkey has reached enormous proportions and has been widely reported. The perpetuation of Armenian Genocide denial inside Turkey falls within this framework of a culture of silencing and a totalitarian culture of regulation of language and thought. The same holds true for a culture of violence--for example, the assassination of Hrant Dink as well as the arbitrary arrest and imprisonment of journalists and human rights attorneys in Turkey. These all grow out of this messaging from the culture of denialism, the logic of denialism, that there is no accountability when these kinds of actions are undertaken. It's worth pointing out that, in terms of the argument of recognizing the Armenian Genocide as something that could undermine democracy in Turkey, in fact, this is something that's been wielded--this argument has been wielded regularly by the current AKP administration, but it's actually rooted in the previous Kemalist governments as well. However, in terms of the current moment, the approaching June 2015 elections in Turkey, President Erdogan is using genocide denial as part of his own political platform towards the goal of securing support from the nationalist right for the AKP's platform, and ultimately for obtaining a supermajority that would allow for an amendment to the Turkish constitution in order to move to a muscular presidential system. The stakes for denialism in this respect are directly related to what's happening in terms of Turkey's domestic politics today. And then, finally, in terms of emboldening Turkey to behave in foreign policy--in foreign policy terms that, again, are assuming that there will be no accountability--what we can see, for example, is that Turkey has ignored U.S. engagement and requests on issues related to U.N. sanctions on Iran, in terms of not selling or facilitating the sale of ISIS oil, as well as dealing with the closure of its border or, at the very least, not providing aid and sanctuary to al-Nusra and ISIS fighters along the Turkish border, and then finally U.S. requests that Turkey cease and desist from anti-Semitic provocation vis-a-vis Israel. Here, again, the Turkish Government's sense that it can behave with impunity and without any kind of accountability traces back to this logic and ideology of denialism. In short, there's both a moral and strategic imperative for the U.S. to change its position on denialism and on the denial of the Armenian Genocide. Continuing to support denialism is not in Turkey's interest as a democratic country and a country struggling now with its democratization process. It's (denialisms) not in the interest of the Transatlantic Alliance, supporting an alliance that is built on shared values as well as interests. And it's (denialism) not in the interest of ongoing efforts to bring about a full normalization of Turkey- Armenia relations. By way of very brief conclusion, in terms of some things that can be done in order to facilitate a shift beyond, a move beyond and a rejection of denialism, first of all, the United States could follow the example of the European Parliament, could follow the example of Pope Francis, and it could follow the example of Turkish citizens who are willing to speak about and recognize the Armenian Genocide perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire. It could also--the United States could also ensure that the White House and our President names the genocide as a genocide. Number two, our government should show zero tolerance for denialism as an ideology of silencing and as a form of memoricide. Number three, the United States could work to empower Turkish civil society, those groups in Turkish civil society-- Armenian groups and others--Turkish journalists, Turkish members of the media, Turkish human rights activists, and particularly in the educational sphere that recognize the Armenian Genocide and are dedicated to recognition and reconciliation. Finally, the U.S. could support the creation of commissions to catalog, preserve and restore sites, and reject the conversion of churches into facilities that are not meant--for which they're not meant to be used. That includes mosques. A big test will be the great Cathedral of Hagia Sophia in Istanbul and what happens with that, but it includes mosques. It also includes, as I said, the Turkish authorities' use of Christian sites for public toilets, stables and concert halls. And then, finally, the U.S. can utilize the full range of interagency support--for example, this Commission, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, the IRF Office in the State Department, and the newly created White House Office of Global Religious Affairs--to ensure that, again, in terms of discourse and practices, denialism is rejected, and that instead recognition of the Armenian Genocide can be a necessary and first step to full reconciliation and normalization. Thank you. Mr. Smith. Thank you very much for your testimony. I will now go to Mrs. Shnorhokian. Mr. Sherman. Mr. Chairman? Mr. Smith. We are joined by Congressman Brad Sherman, and I understand you're on a tight schedule, too. So I'd love to yield to you right now. HON. BRAD SHERMAN (D-30), A MEMBER OF CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Mr. Sherman. Thank you. I apologize for being late here today, but I was on the floor of the House of Representatives doing a special order on the very topic of this hearing, joined by Mr. Royce, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and other members. It is very appropriate that we had that special order and that we have this hearing at this exact time, for it began a hundred years ago at this very hour, because it's April 23rd here in Washington, but it is very close to the midnight of April 24th in Istanbul. And just a hundred years ago to this very hour, the thugs were leaving their headquarters; the officials of the--of the Ottoman government were out to arrest and to kill 650 leaders of the Armenian community of Istanbul, then the capital of the Ottoman Empire. We're here today, though, not just to commemorate a terrible wrong, for there are several terrible wrongs. When I meet--and I do, from time to time--to remember the Holocaust, there's one element that isn't there, and that is the need to combat governmental denial of the Holocaust. And that is why I want to commend the chair for holding these hearings, because we're here not just to commemorate but to correct. And we're not correcting a few crazy Holocaust deniers; we're here correcting a government of a major--of a major nation. This genocide denial's harm to Armenians is obvious, but there's also a great harm to America. How do we have a basis for world leadership if we kowtow? Have we--especially a country and a government that we've done so much for. Since World War II, we've given them 23 billion [dollars] in aid. We saved them from communism. We built and helped build the pipeline that brings them oil. We prevented an independent Kurdish state. We have been the loudest voice for Turkey to be allowed to enter the European Union. And then, with all that, they demand that we be accomplices in genocide denial? And even worse, we accede to that demand. And I want to thank the last witness. I've never heard it done so well, to explain how genocide denial harms not only Armenia and America, but harms the people of Turkey. There's nothing that we could do for the people of Turkey of greater significance than for the House of Representatives and the Senate to recognize the Armenian Genocide, because how can Turkey be a modern nation in the future if it is so busy denying its past? And who is going to trust Turkey? Would anyone trust a German Government that denied the Holocaust? Would the world be willing to follow an America that was engaged in some multinational, multibillion -dollar slavery denial program? Turkey cannot be an effective ally or a trusted partner of any nation as long as it continues this denial. And as the professor just pointed out, it not only corrodes Turkey's position in the world, but corrodes the efforts to create real democracy in Turkey and to create an acceptance of religious minorities in Turkey. So, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for holding this hearing. I thank our witnesses for being here. And I look forward to the day when we do the best thing we could do for Turkey, and that's recognize the Armenian Genocide. Mr. Smith. Thank you very much, Mr. Sherman. I'd like to now yield to Ms. Shnorhokian. KARINE SHNORHOKIAN, REPRESENTATIVE, THE GENOCIDE EDUCATION PROJECT Ms. Shnorhokian. Chairman Smith and fellow Commissioners, thank you for organizing today's event and for the invitation. It's certainly humbling to be here. It is sentimental as I think back to six years ago almost to the day, where on April 22nd, 2009, at the age of 96, my husband's grandmother, an Armenian Genocide survivor, Alice Khachadoorian-Shnorhokian, arrived in Washington, D.C. one last time to meet with members of Congress, urging them to push forward for recognition of the Armenian Genocide. She considered herself one of the lucky ones, and felt a heavy burden on her shoulders to pursue justice for this cause. That morning, after making the journey from New Jersey, she arrived on the Hill in a gray-colored suit, the same suit she would be buried in two years later. Her white hair short and recently manicured, large round glasses, black cane and wheelchair, she was wheeled around office to office, telling her story to different members of Congress--her mind sharp and her memories lucid, a smile on her face with knowing her presence was making a difference. With her she carried two composition books older than she, entrusted to her by her relatives, who were midwives. The books were handwritten accounts of all the babies born in Aintab, Turkey during the turn of the 20th Century. In the black book, with its fading pages, and broken seams, search through the Armenian handwriting and navigate to the month of August 1912, you will find Grandma Alice's name there, born Wednesday, August 28, 1912. Alice's father, a respected and successful trade route merchant, provided for his family, which consisted of his wife and six children. When the order of the deportation of the Armenians arrived in 1915, Alice's family gathered whatever they could carry upon their donkey and began the marches, nearing closer and closer to the Syrian Desert. She and her brother, too young to endure the treacherous walk, were placed in the boxes on the sides of their donkey. As fate would have it, a high ranking military official and neighbor to Alice's family was shocked to see the family in Maskanah, the final stop before entering Der Zor. He obtained a permit, essentially saving the family. Attributing it to her faith in God, Alice, along with her family, survived the Armenian Genocide. From Aintab, they relocated to Allepo, Syria, and later to Beirut, Lebanon, where she received her education and studied as a midwife. She practiced midwifery for many years. She later married and relocated to the United States in 1980, where she served her Church and was proud of her three children, Ivan, Arpy Sarian, and Harout, and six grandchildren; Tina Volzer, Vahig Shnorhokia, Tsoleen Sarian, Lori Shnorhokia, Sevan Sarian, and Nora Shnorhokia. She continued to live in a world where the cycle of genocide continued. The traumas of what she endured visited her in her dreams, and Turkey's ongoing denial led her inability to move on. She had one simple ask, which was: ``Before my time passes, I am asking for justice of this great country and for the world to not forget the tragic suffering and terrible genocide of the Armenians. I am an American citizen, and I want my voice to be heard. I have guaranteed rights that were denied to my family 93 years ago.'' On June 16th, 2011, she passed away. She never saw justice and never saw recognition, and she could never quite comprehend how America continuously caved in to the empty threats of the Turkish Government. The Turkish Government thinks that time will lead to faded memories. And as our last survivors walk this Earth, it is unfortunate, disheartening, and irresponsible that year after year broken promises and euphemisms are used to describe the Armenian Genocide by our own government. My own journey to speak out is fueled by my passion, education, and Turkey's ongoing denial. Reading Peter Balakian's book, ``Black Dog of Fate'' at the age of 15 ignited a flame within me. My high school--Glenbrook North High School in Northbrook, Illinois, and history teacher Mr. James McPherrin--gave me the platform to speak out and educate others. The topic angered my classmates. Their anger, however, stemmed from the fact that they felt ashamed and embarrassed that they did not know the past. They were angry that the history books did not contain this content. Denial of the genocide pushed me to educate America's youth. It has pushed me to pass legislation to teach Armenian Genocide and other genocides in schools. Through The Genocide Education Project, I have attended social studies conferences to give educators the tools they need to teach this difficult topic in their classroom, and recently led initiatives to develop a curriculum guide on the Near East Relief efforts during the time of the genocide to help those in need. This curriculum, entitled They Shall Not Perish, The Story of the Near East Relief was recently developed by a small subcommittee I spearheaded to allow for additional materials educators can use in their classrooms when teaching about genocide. I also proudly wear a pin honoring those efforts created during World War I. The pin is in red, white and blue and reads ``American Committee Relief In Near East Save A Life,'' with a shining star at center. Like Grandma Alice, I too studied nursing, graduating college with a Bachelors of Science in Nursing from Loyola University of Chicago over a decade ago. And at the age of 22, I worked as a nurse in an intensive care unit at Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, Illinois. My work to pursue justice was not enough, however. It is not easy for an Armenian youth to grow up knowing that the truth is plagued by denial, hostility and threats. Knowing there was a greater good out there to pursue justice, I took a sabbatical from my nursing career. And I left to continue to educate students and teachers, build coalitions with other victims of genocide, meet with members of Congress to pursue genocide recognition, and much more. On April 22nd, I joined several hundred students at Pascack Valley High School in New Jersey and presented with a genocide survivor from Rwanda, Mr. Daniel Trust, as well as another advocate for justice, Ms. Lee Ann De Rues, who's a voice for victims who have suffered traumatic rape and violence with the ongoing conflicts in Congo. As descendants of survivors, it is our moral obligation to pursue justice for our survivors and end the cycle and denial of genocide. I by no means think I am the poster child for our cause because where this is just my story, multiply it by a hundred, a thousand or even 10,000, for that matter. And where we may face genocide denial in the schools or in Congress, Armenians in Armenia and Armenians here in the diaspora will never rest. The lights in our offices are always on. The media outlets will continue to be flooded. The telephone calls to members of Congress will never stop. And the education in schools will continue to anger and motivate students. The hashtags, the tweets, the social media campaigns will continue until justice prevails. Turkey failed. Turkey failed because, at the age of 96, Grandma Alice, a survivor, came to Washington, D.C. to fight for this cause, the same cause I am fighting for six years later and for however long it takes for Turkey to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide. Leadership that cannot speak the truth will come and go, and our adversaries will grow old and leave disgraceful legacies, but perhaps one day that one student I educated in world history will become the next world leader and remember that anger he or she felt for not knowing. They will speak the truth, because truth and justice will always prevail no matter what the cost and consequence will be. And to close, several years prior, while serving as a Senator, I asked President Obama about the Armenian Genocide. He openly acknowledged it as a genocide, and discussed Turkey's ongoing denial. It is sad to think how his views have changed, and how he has backed down from taking a moral stand. He continues to give in to these blanket threats from the Turkish Government. It is a disgrace as an American citizen that our own great Nation cannot acknowledge the truth. Thank you. Mr. Smith. Thank you for your very eloquent testimony. All of you, this has been a panel with very few parallels. I've been in Congress 35 years, and you have all made extraordinarily important points that I hope a wider audience will take under consideration. I do have a few questions, beginning first with, you know, as I talk to members--and this is decades long, but certainly in the last several years especially--there is that surface appeal argument that, after a century--now a century--that we just move on and acquiesce to the historical untruths promulgated by the Turkish Government and other opinion molders who are waging a campaign of disinformation. I suggest back to them, when I hear this from members and from parliamentarians-- you know, we meet regularly as head of delegation for the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly with members from around--from the 57 countries that make up the OSCE, and it's amazing how that argument has had staying power, that just turn the page, it's a hundred years ago. The most immediate point to fire back, obviously, is that the memory of this festers. The families have suffered an agony that then is passed on from generation to generation because there has been no honest acceptance of these horrific deeds. But it is also--and I think your testimonies bring this out big time--a longer look at genocide denial, which is a calculated, premeditated, disingenuous policy that is truly designed to inculcate distrust and animosity towards the Armenians. I think that point has been made very strong. This is a current-day libel and slander against the Armenian people, and Armenians not just living in Armenia but everywhere else, and it is used quite adroitly by people like Erdogan to stir up those animosities. I'm planning--and it came out of just thinking, listening to all of you--a second hearing that will focus on the textbooks. You now, the--as you, Mr. Hachikian, pointed out, that the Turkish people pay--it was your fourth cost point-- because the young people are being taught a pack of lies that leads to a hatred and an animosity that then has real-world implications, particularly as they matriculate into government authorities themselves someday, or journalists, or whoever. So the textbooks, I think, need to be examined. You know, remember that famous song from Rodgers and Hammerstein's ``South Pacific,'' ``You've Got to be Taught,'' that the hatred has to be taught from generation to generation? Well, the textbooks are a conduit for that hatred, and I think we need to examine it, those textbooks. I did this with regards to UNRWA and the anti-Semitic diatribes that are contained within the UNRWA textbooks, which we--the United States Government--supply to the PLA in large measure. We're the biggest donor to UNRWA that there is. So I held a hearing and we had individuals read from the textbooks. None of us had ever had such a textbook in our hand or even seen one. And it was an absolute eye opener, and I think we need to look at and examine and scrutinize what are the young people of Turkey being taught by this campaign of slander and this campaign of hatred towards the Armenians. So that'll be our next hearing. I will announce that as soon as we pull that together. But I think it came right out of listening to all of you. You might want to speak to the next generation, how they're being--you know, how do you break that off? You know, we've seen with every ethnic or any other racial animosity anywhere in the world there's always this effort to reach the young minds and mold those minds and to fill it with hatred. So if you could speak to that. Secondly, the issue of what would U.S. recognition mean. And I really do thank Mr. Krikirian for what you did-- Krikorian, I should say--laying out some of those points about, in 1951, May 28th, U.S. written statement filed with the International Court of Justice regarding the U.N. Genocide Convention: ``The practice of genocide has occurred throughout human history. The Roman persecution of the Christians, the Turkish massacre of the Armenians, the extermination of millions of Jews/Poles by the Nazis are outstanding examples of the crime of genocide.'' So we got it right in 1951, and many other countries did as well. And Ronald Reagan, as you pointed out, when he pointed out in this proclamation, ``like the genocide of the Armenians before it and the genocide of the Cambodians that followed it,'' it seems to me there has been a seismic shift in policy, deliberate policy by the Turkish Government, to move more aggressively towards demonizing Armenians, and part of that effort is to--is to say the genocide never occurred. When we had the ambassador testify here, his phrase was ``just use `tragedy.' '' Well, ``tragedy'' is if tomorrow or tonight I'm driving and I have a head-on collision and die. That's a tragedy--in a car. This was a premediated act of hatred and wanton killing, and that's what defines a genocide. So if you could speak to--and Turkey signed the Genocide Convention. They were one of first, Mark Milosch just reminded me, and I appreciate that. So if you could speak to that about the youth and then what the impact U.S. recognition would have. I am amazed that we are being bullied, in 2015. And again, I've said it, you've said it: the President couldn't have been more clear as a United States senator and as a candidate that he would do this. I'll never forget, after we had the hearing in 2000--2000, September 4th--14th, it was on H. Res. 398, which Rogan had introduced, which would have been--it was a very bipartisan effort--they would have recognized the genocide. In comes a conveyance from Sandy Berger, then-chief security council adviser to Clinton, and unfortunately our speaker, Dennis Hastert, said, oh, can't go forward with that, we're getting admonished if not even more from the administration not to go forward with this. Shame on us. We should do this and we should do it now. The President should do it still. There are hours left. If you could speak to those issues. Mr. Hachikian. Mr. Chairman, thank you for those thoughtful remarks. Very quickly, in response to your second issue, I believe U.S. recognition would isolate Turkey in a way that's absolutely necessary--because, after all, our ultimate goal is not recognition by the United States, it's recognition by Turkey, and to bring to justice for the crimes that were committed. U.S. recognition, however, would pressure Turkey, in addition to isolating them. It would cause them to understand that there's really no place they can turn in the world to hide behind. It would make it clear that the United States is not open to blackmail, which--you know, once you give into blackmail, you'll always give into blackmail. And it is astonishing that this administration doesn't understand that. And finally, it would--it would cause the United States to stand out as a clear voice of clarity on a moral issue of great importance and send a signal to other potential perpetrators of genocide that it cannot be tolerated. So thank you. Dr. Prodromou. Thank you for your enthusiasm and focus in terms of immediate follow up. It's really heartening. Regarding the isolation of Turkey, I think that recognition--the U.S. recognition wouldn't necessarily isolate Turkey. I think Turkey is already very isolated. I think what it would do in some ways, as you said, it would send a message that the United States has a zero-tolerance policy on these kinds of issues, and that extends well beyond Turkey. But also it would free up those in Turkey who would support a recognition, would support recognition. It will give them traction because, until now, the United States' willingness to bow its head to Turkish threats and Turkish condemnation has taken away that kind of traction from those in Turkey who might actually support recognition. And the other thing I would encourage is, in addition to the textbooks--which, yes, portray, not only in terms of public school textbooks but in terms of the textbooks that are--and the training that is used for the Turkish armed forces, portray Greeks, Armenians, Jews, Assyrians as security threats to Turkey. I would encourage you to think about those textbooks as well. And then finally, the issue of sites. That's where the United States can do a lot of work on its own, with its European allies and with the United Nations. I would encourage us to recognize that part of genocide is not only eradicating/ annihilating the people, it's eliminating any footprint of those people--any physical evidence that they ever once existed. And the obliteration of religious sites, cultural monuments in Turkey proper, and as I mentioned in Turkish-occupied Cyprus, has proceeded apace. And that's part of a deliberate strategy to either redesign history, convert those sites into different kinds of cultural spaces, or to eliminate them and, again, eliminate any evidence that those people once were. We talk about that--we talked about that when the Taliban was attacking religious sites in Afghanistan, Buddhist sites in Afghanistan. We're talking about it in terms of what ISIS is doing in Iraq. And we see the same thing happening in Turkey and Turkish- occupied Cyprus. So sites can be preserved, they can be cataloged, and they can be repaired. And that's, again, a place where, in terms of working with our European allies and the United Nations, UNESCO in particular, we can do a lot better. Dr. Akcam. As a historian, I have to give short information on the political recognition of the genocide. We all think that Turkish Government's denied--has denied over the years. It was not true, actually. I strongly remind everybody that both Turkish Government in Ankara between 1918 and 1920 and the Ottoman government in Istanbul recognized the crimes, and they set up a military tribunal in Istanbul and they tried more than 200 defendants, and there were death sentences against 16 people and three were hanged. And I would really recommend to my government to follow up their founding fathers' footstep, Mustafa Kemal, who made a speech in Turkish parliament April 1920 where he called Armenian massacres as a ``shameful act.'' So it is not enough, maybe, for today, but it is really a good beginning for Turkish Government to follow the footsteps of its founding fathers and call the event of 1915 a shameful act, and then carry out the consequences. Thank you. Mr. Krikorian. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think your idea about a review of textbooks and hearing in attention to that is brilliant. One of the things that we do at the Armenian National Institute is have a website. It gets enormous amounts of use. It lays out the facts and the documents and--no editorial content, just the facts and the documents. And among the top five countries where we get use from it is Turkey because we have people who want to see what the real truth of it is. With respect to textbooks and books in general, one of the more fascinating things that's happened as the world's opened up, not just through the Internet but communication and education, is that the grandson--the grandson of one of the actual architects of the Armenian Genocide--there were three primary architects of the Armenian Genocide. The grandson of one of them, Hasan Cemal, actually wrote a book called ``1915: The Armenian Genocide'' in Turkish, and he apologized. He did it based on his family's records and the rest of the history. It was an enormously brave thing to do. And it's pretty much-- not that we needed more dispositive documents or facts, but a person like that needs to get recognized, and a person like that needs to be protected. When we held meetings in Turkey as a Reconciliation Commission, we had a number of Turks that wanted to come to terms with their history. And they came to us and asked us, if they did, could we protect them? And we had to say: No, we can't. And if we can contribute to that, it would help a lot, too. Thank you. Mr. Smith. Before we close, is there anything else you would like to say to conclude? Well, I want to thank you again for your brilliant testimony--incisive, persuasive, and it leaves the Congress with much more that we ought to be doing. And I thank you for that as well. And again, we all mourn and pray for those who lost their lives, for their families. I, too, am a Christian, and believe strongly in the power of prayer. And my hope is--I think our collective hope is that through prayer and hard work this ongoing perpetuation of the hate that has been pushed by certain people in Turkey will not just be mitigated, but it will end. And it's only when there's a full recognition of a genocide--in this case, the Armenian Genocide--that that healing can begin. Yes, please, for a final word. Dr. Akcam. Maybe to close I would like to remind everybody about one important issue. After the assassination of Hrant Dink, my dear friend, in Istanbul, there is a growing civil society in Turkey. And these individuals, this civil society, is ready to face history. And I'm really hoping that the United States and the world community considers this growing civil society as the new Turkey. And this is the important part: Turkey does not only consist of a denialist government, but Turkish people are now on the streets and there is a new growing Turkey, and we should really recognize this new growing Turkey, and Hrant Dink also as Martin Luther King of Turkey. Thank you very much. Mr. Smith. Yes, and I just wanted to be clear that we have concerns for your safety as well, and the Commission will be doing whatever it can to ensure that the powers that be in Turkey know that. And let me also point out that when you mention civil society, in the past I have had numerous meetings in Ankara as well as hearings here in Washington on behalf of journalists, who have suffered disproportionately. As a matter of act, we had a hearing once where, unfortunately, the headline the next day was ``State Department Defends Ankara From the U.S. Congress.'' It was--unfortunately, the State Department rep went out of his way to, instead of saying a journalist should have unfettered right, you know, with due regard to libel laws, to print--and of course, if you write about the Armenian Genocide, you are put at risk. And I also wrote four laws on combating torture. The Torture Victims Relief Act, they're called, and there's four of them. And they helped torture victim relief centers, and there are those centers in Turkey. And I've gotten to know many people who have stood up and pushed back in those centers against the far-too-often utilization of torture methods. I have raised it personally with members of the parliament. I remember one time, in a bilateral meeting with a group of Turks in one of our parliamentary assemblies, after about an hour of back and forth, one of the top people said, you know, we do have a problem. [Chuckles.] So he at least admitted it. And you know, maybe that's the beginning of reform, when people finally realize there is a problem. But we have to accelerate our efforts going into the second century, now, of denial of the Armenian Genocide. And I can assure you this Commission and my subcommittee, which is the Global Human Rights Subcommittee, will look for ways. Any ideas you have, please pass them along and we will act. Hearing's adjourned. [Whereupon, at 3:20 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.] A P P E N D I X ======================================================================= Prepared Statements ---------- Prepared Statement of Hon. Christopher H. Smith, Chairman, Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe Good afternoon and welcome to our witnesses and everyone joining us for today's hearing marking 100 years since the start of the Armenian genocide--one of the most terrible crimes of the twentieth century. The Armenian genocide is the only one of the genocides of the twentieth century in which the nation that was decimated by genocide has been subject to the ongoing outrage of a massive campaign of genocide denial, openly sustained by state authority. This campaign of genocide denial is a slap in the face to the Armenian people, preventing reconciliation and healing. As Pope Francis said at his Mass marking the centenary of the genocide, ``Concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it.'' In September 2000 I chaired the first Congressional hearing on the Armenian genocide. It was a four-hour hearing and the testimony I heard that day, and many accounts of the atrocities I have read in the articles and books over the years, including the eyewitness account Ambassador Morgenthau's Story, have shocked me deeply. The facts were reported throughout the world as they were happening, corroborated immediately afterward by survivors and even some perpetrators, and have been amply documented by historians, including in a number of recent books. In 1915, there were about 2 million Armenians living in what was then the Ottoman Empire. They were living in a region that they inhabited for 2,500 years. By 1923, well over 90 percent of these Armenians had disappeared. Most of them, as many as 1.5 million, were dead--most of them death-marched into the desert or shot, and subject in some cases to rape or other unbelievable cruelties. The remainder had been forced into exile. When the term genocide was invented in 1944 to describe the systematic destruction of an entire people, its author Raphael Lemkin explained the term by saying it was ``the sort of thing Hitler did to the Jews and the Turks did to the Armenians.'' Since the facts are so well-established, this is not a hearing only to inquire into the events of 1915. Rather it is also a hearing on what has happened since then, and is still happening today--genocide denial. Sadly, the Turkish Government has driven this campaign of denial, and has done so over a course of decades, using a variety of means to punish Turkish citizens who dared to acknowledge the crimes committed by the Ottoman government in 1915. The Turkish Government has also threatened other countries to keep them from acknowledging the genocide--ironically, it is only the Turkish Government's campaign of denial that obliges other countries to recognize the genocide. And the Turkish Government's crimes, sometimes by changing the subject to the wartime sufferings of Turks, or crimes committed by individual Armenians. This is in no sense a hearing against Turkey--rather I consider it a hearing that supports the Turkish people. Today many people in Turkey are in the process of freeing themselves from the effects of decades of denialist propaganda by their government. Many already see through the official denialism, and some oppose it openly. I want to support and express my admiration for these people--for their courage, for their Turkish patriotism. They act, sometimes at personal risk to themselves, for the good of their country and out of love of their country. They are `thought-leaders'--and there are many signs of this. In recent weeks, in the lead up to the centenary of the genocide, there have been many deeply moving feature stories in the world press about Turks discovering their families' secret Armenian heritage, or seeking to connect with the Armenian aspects of Turkish history, or supporting efforts to rebuild Armenian churches. I'd like to insert one of these articles, ``Remembering the Armenian Genocide,'' by Victor Gaetan, into the hearing record. No country is immune from evil, all governments have been complicit at some point in their histories in terrible crimes--and this certainly includes the United States. It includes Germany. I want to urge the Turkish government--the path taken by Germany after World War II was the right one. Germany started with open acknowledgment of the crimes of the Holocaust, and it built from there, over a course of decades establishing relationships with Jewish groups and Israel, in which it demonstrated remorse and a commitment to righting its wrongs, as far as it could. Now there is a strong German-Israeli friendship--and today Germany is one of the most respected countries in the world. That path is still open to the Turkish government, and working to put Turkey on it will be the truest, deepest expression of Turkish patriotism. Finally, I must respond to President Obama. On Tuesday his aides met with Armenian leaders and made it clear that once again he will not recognize the Armenian genocide--he will not use the word ``genocide'' tomorrow. This is in direct contradiction to the promises that he made before becoming President--and in order to become President. While a candidate, in 2008 the President made passionate statements in support of genocide recognition. I also share with Armenian Americans--so many of whom are descended from genocide survivors--a principled commitment to commemorating and ending genocide. That starts with acknowledging the tragic instances of genocide in world history. As a U.S. Senator, I have stood with the Armenian American community in calling for Turkey's acknowledgement of the Armenian Genocide. Two years ago, I criticized the Secretary of State for the firing of U.S. Ambassador to Armenia, John Evans, after he properly used the term ``genocide'' to describe Turkey's slaughter of thousands of Armenians starting in 1915. I shared with Secretary Rice my firmly held conviction that the Armenian Genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence. The facts are undeniable. An official policy that calls on diplomats to distort the historical facts is an untenable policy. As a Senator, I strongly support passage of the Armenian Genocide Resolution (H.Res.106 and S.Res.106), and as President I will recognize the Armenian Genocide. These are beautiful words which echo hollowly today. The President's abandonment of this commitment is unconscionable and cynical. With Germany and the EU lining up to do the right thing, our government needs to do likewise. At this point, according the Congressional Research Service, the EU states listed as having recognized a genocide are France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Greece, and Cyprus, and the Holy See. The European Parliament has also referred to the deaths as genocide. The non-EU states are Argentina, Canada, Chile, Lebanon, Russia, Switzerland, Uruguay, Vatican City, and Venezuela. Sadly, after the President's powerful promise, he is following, not leading--or rather, we are not even following. As mass atrocities unfold in Syria and Iraq, the U.S. needs the Turkish Government to engage constructively with its neighbors. The Turkish Government can do this much more effectively after it honestly faces its own past--the President is missing an opportunity to move Turkey toward this path. Prepared Statement of Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse, Commissioner, Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe On April 24, 1915, the Ottomans rounded up and killed a group of Armenia's best and brightest, marking the beginning of what historians now recognize as a wider plan of eradication. Nearly 1.5 million Armenians were killed, in massacres and in forced marches into the Syrian Desert. Another half million Armenians were driven from their ancient homeland. The slaughter of innocent Armenians was genocide, plain and simple. Indeed, our modern term ``genocide'' was first coined in the 1940s to describe both the Jewish Holocaust and the plight of the Armenians under Ottoman persecution in World War I. Theodore Roosevelt called the Armenian Genocide the ``greatest crime'' of the Great War. And perhaps prophetically, he wrote in 1918 that the failure to honestly "
