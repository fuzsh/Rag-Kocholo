It features essays and reviews that cut across the disciplines of history, literature, economics, religious studies, anthropology, political science, sociology, and others. HGS is the only publication to address the related study of how insights into the Holocaust apply to other genocides. Published in association with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n\nThe articles and reviews in Holocaust and Genocide Studies reflect the opinions of their authors. They do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum or of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council."
