        "text": "Trigger Warnings: Photos and text containing graphic references to violence and murder.\n\nWhen the Moon Knight of MCU came out, two words made one particular segment of its viewers throw a tantrum. Those two words were Armenian Genocide.\n\nYou might have heard of it, read somewhere, or this might be the very first time you come across the term. Google it and you will find millions of pages, explaining what Armenian Genocide is. For example, the Encyclopedia Britannica gives this explanation:\n\nArmenian Genocide, campaign of deportation and mass killing conducted against the Armenian subjects of the Ottoman Empire by the Young Turks governing during the WW 1.\n\n100 years later we mourn and seek justice (still!) and I am wondering if a world without genocides, discrimination, and racism is too much to ask for. One particular screenshot of a message that reads “ You pigs deserved the events of 1915, and this time we are going to finish what Enver and Talat have started “ screams YES. I am left hoping that it will not be treated as a political carrot and stick by the powers of the world and at least Turkey will recognize it and historic justice will finally be served.\n\nAs an Armenian I never stop reading and researching about the Armenian Genocide I decided that I would share a part of my (re)reading list here.\n\nThe 40 days of Musa Dagh by Franz Werfel. The novel focuses on self-defense by a small community of Armenians leaving near Musa Dagh (Mount Musa).\n\nRavished Armenia: The Story of Aurora Mardiganian, the Christian Girl, Who Survived the Great Massacres by Arshaluys (Aurora) Mardiganian. The book is about her experience during the Armenian Genocide. In 1919 a Holywood movie was filmed based on this book titled Auction of Souls.\n\nThe thirty-year Genocide: Turkey’s destruction of its Christian minorities, 1894–1924 by Benny Morris and Dror Ze’Evi is a book that argues that the Armenian Genocide and persecution of Christians that happened at the same time constitute an extermination campaign.\n\nAmbassador Morgenthau’s Story: A personal account of the Armenian Genocide by Henry Morgenthau is an insightful and painful first-hand account of the Armenian Genocide as seen from his role as the American Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nFour Years beneath the Crescent by Rafael de Nogales. These are the memoirs of the Venezuelan mercenary officer in the Ottoman Army. He participated in the siege of Van and witnessed and described the Genocide in 1915, even though he was anti-Armenian.\n\nA Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the question of Turkish responsibility by Taner Akcam. “ No future discussion of the history will be able to ignore this brilliant book,” said Orhan Pamuk.\n\nKilling Orders: Talat Pasha’s Telegrams and the Armenian Genocide (Palgrave Studies in the History of Genocide) by Taner Akcam. In this book, the author provides evidence that the killing orders signed by Ottoman Interior Minister Talat Pasha and the memoirs of the Ottoman bureaucrat Naim Efendi can be trusted as authentic thus revealing the genocidal intent of the Ottoman-Turkish government.\n\nThe Armenian Genocide: Testimonies of the eyewitness survivors by Verjine Svazlian. The book comprises the oral testimonies and songs directly recorded from the generation that survived the Armenian Genocide over the course of more than 55 years by the author.\n\nThe Armenians of Aintab: The Economics of Genocide in an Ottoman Province by Umit Kurt. The official description of this book reads “A Turk’s discovery that Armenians once thrived in his hometown leads to a groundbreaking investigation into the local dynamics of genocide.”\n\nThe Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America’s response by Peter Balakian. The book details the Armenian Genocide, the events leading up to it, and the events following it.\n\nOperation Nemesis by Eric Bogossian. The book is about how an accountant, a life insurance salesman, a newspaper editor an engineering student, and a diplomat prosecuted the perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide when the justice system failed to hold the latter accountable.\n\nA more comprehensive list of the bibliography can be found on the website of the Armenian Genocide Museum (http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/bibliography.php)\n\nDisclaimer: The links are included to facilitate the search of the books, they are NOT affiliates, and I do not earn anything from them.\n\nP.S. Did you know that Hitler during his Obersalzberg Speech on invading Poland notoriously said “Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?”"
