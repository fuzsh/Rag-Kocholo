        "text": "Metropolitan municipality in Turkey\n\nMetropolitan municipality in Southeastern Anatolia, Turkey\n\nGaziantep,[a] historically Aintab and still informally called Antep,[b] is a major city in south-central Turkey. It is the capital of the Gaziantep Province, in the westernmost part of Turkey's Southeastern Anatolia Region and partially in the Mediterranean Region. It is located approximately 185 km (115 mi) east of Adana and 97 km (60 mi) north of Aleppo, Syria and situated on the Sajur River. The city is thought to be located on the site of ancient Antiochia ad Taurum and is near ancient Zeugma.\n\nAs of the 2021 census, the Gaziantep province (Metropolitan municipality) was home to 2,130,432 inhabitants, of whom 1,775,904 lived in the metropolitan area made of two (out of three) urban districts of Şahinbey and Şehitkamil, as Oğuzeli is not conurbated. It is the sixth-most populous city in Turkey. Gaziantep is a diverse city inhabited mostly by ethnic Turks and a significant minority of Kurds and Syrian refugees. It was historically populated by Turkmens, Armenians, Jews, and a plethora of other ethnic groups.\n\nIn February 2023, the city was heavily damaged by the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake.\n\nName\n\n[edit]\n\nDue to the city's contact with various ethnic groups and cultures throughout its history, the name of the city has many variants and alternatives, such as:\n\nHantab, Hamtab, or Hatab as known by the Crusaders,[4][5]\n\nAntab and its variants in vulgar Turkish and Armenian since 17th century the latest,[6][7]\n\nAīntāb (عين تاب) in Ottoman Turkish,\n\nGazi Ayıntap in official Turkish after February 1921, when the Turkish parliament honored the city as غازى عینتاب Ghazi Aīntāb to commemorate its resistance to the French Siege of Aintab during the Franco-Turkish War,\n\nGaziantep in official Turkish after 1928,[8]\n\n'Aīntāb (عينتاب) in Arabic,\n\nÊntab or Dîlok in Kurdish,[9]\n\nAïntab or Verdun Turc in French.[10]\n\nThe several theories for the origin of the current name include:[citation needed]\n\nAïntap may be derived from khantap, meaning \"king's land\" in the Hittite language.\n\nAïn, an Arabic and Aramaic word meaning \"spring\", and tab as a word of praise.\n\nAntep could be a corruption of the Arabic 'aīn ṭayyib meaning \"good spring\".[11] However, the Arabic name for the city is spelled with t (ت), not ṭ (ط).\n\nAyin dab or Ayin debo in Aramaic, meaning \"spring of the wolf\"\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nHellenistic period\n\n[edit]\n\nGaziantep is the probable site of the Hellenistic city of Antiochia ad Taurum[12] (\"Antiochia in the Taurus Mountains\").\n\nMedieval history\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring its early history, Aintab was largely a fortress overshadowed by the city of Dülük, some 12 km to the north. Aintab came to prominence after an earthquake in the 14th century devastated Dülük.[2]: 22 Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant, the region passed to the Umayyads in 661 AD and the Abbasids in 750. It was ravaged several times during the Arab–Byzantine wars. After the disintegration of the Abbasid dynasty, the city was ruled successively by the Tulunids, the Ikhshidids, and the Hamdanids.[citation needed] In 962, it was recaptured by the Byzantines, upon the expansion led by Nikephoros II Phokas.[13]\n\nAfter Afshin Bey captured the fortress in 1067, Aintab fell to Seljuk rule[14] and was administered by Seljuk emirs of Damascus. One of these emirs, Tutush I appointed Armenian noble Thoros of Edessa as the governor of the region.[15]\n\nIt was captured by the Crusaders and united to the Maras Seigneurship in the County of Edessa in 1098. The region continued to be ruled by independent or vassalized Armenian lords, such as Kogh Vasil.[16] It reverted to the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm in 1150, was controlled by the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia between 1155–1157 and 1204–1206 and captured by the Zengids in 1172 and the Ayyubids in 1181. It was retaken by the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm in 1218.[citation needed]\n\nWith the turn of the 13th-century, Dülük became one of Aintab's dependencies according to geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi. In the next century, Aintab was the capital of its district and a town with fine markets much frequented by merchants and travellers, while Duluk was in ruins, according to Abulfeda.[17] Still, Aintab continued to be hotly contested throughout these centuries.[2]: 22–3 It was besieged by the Mongols in 1270.[2]: 23\n\nIt repeatedly changed hands between the Ilkhanate and the Mamluk Sultanate or the Dulkadirids, a Turkoman vassal state of the Mamluks. Gaziantep was near the southern frontier of the Dulkadir emirate, and on several occasions it slipped out of their control.[2]: 23 The Ilkhans ruled over it between 1260 and 1261, 1271–1272, 1280–1281 and 1299–1317. The Mamluks controlled the city between 1261 and 1271, 1272–1280, 1281–1299, 1317–1341, 1353–1378, 1381–1389. It was unsuccessfully besieged by the Dulkadir leader Sevli Beg in 1390. Although the Mamluks and their Dulkadirid vassals could control the city from 1395 until the Ottoman conquest in 1516, the city was besieged by Timur in 1400, and then in 1420 by the Ak Koyunlu leader Kara Yusuf.[2]: 23\n\nThese attacks all caused destruction and suffering among the local population. But at the same time, the city was \"acquiring a reputation as a cultured urban center\". Badr al-Din al-Ayni, an Aintab native who became a successful diplomat, judge, and historian under the Mamluks, wrote at the end of the 1300s that the city was called \"little Bukhara\" because so many scholars came to study there. Ayni also left a firsthand account of the suffering caused during Sevli Beg's siege in 1390.[2]: 23\n\nAnother rough patch for Aintab's people came in the late 1460s, when the Dulkadir prince Şehsuvar rebelled against the Mamluks.[2]: 25 Mamluk forces captured Aintab in May 1468, driving out Şehsuvar's forces; a report by the governor of Aleppo indicates that resistance had been fierce. Just a month later, Şehsuvar recaptured Aintab after four \"engagements\" with Mamluk forces. After Şehsuvar's final defeat and public execution by the Mamluks in 1473, Gaziantep enjoyed a period of relative peace and stability under his brother and successor Alaüddevle. Alaüddevle appears to have considered Gaziantep an important possession and commissioned several constructions in the city, including a reservoir and a large mosque in the middle of town. The city's fortress was also renovated, completed in 1481. These repairs were likely ordered by the Mamluk sultan Qaitbay during his tour of northern Syria in 1477; his name is inscribed above the entrance portal, perhaps symbolically marking his territory.[2]: 26\n\nThe end of the Dulkadir principality came around 1515. Alaüddevle refused to fight alongside the Ottomans at the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514. The Ottomans used this as a pretext to overthrow him, and in June 1515 he was executed.[2]: 24 As Alaüddevle had been a Mamluk vassal, the Mamluks considered this an affront, and the Mamluk sultan Qansuh al-Ghawri mobilized an army and marched north towards Aleppo.[2]: 25\n\nThe conflict over the region meant that in Gaziantep, anxieties about the fate of the city and its surroundings must have been high. Later court records from the early 1540s provide documentary evidence of \"dislocation and loss of population\" as people fled; this may have been more pronounced in rural areas than in the city itself.[2]: 30\n\nOttoman period\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Ottoman Empire captured Gaziantep just before the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516, under the reign of Sultan Selim I. In the Ottoman period, Aintab was a sanjak centred initially in the Dulkadir Eyalet (1516–1818), and later in the Aleppo vilayet (1908–1918). It was also a kaza in the Aleppo vilayet (1818–1908). The city established itself as a centre for commerce due to its location straddling trade routes.\n\nAlthough it was controlled by the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia only between 1155–1157 and 1204–1206, for most of the last two millennia, Gaziantep hosted a large Armenian community. Armenians played a significant role in the city's history, culture, welfare, and prosperity. These communities no longer exist in the city due to the Hamidian massacres in 1895 and the Armenian genocide in 1915.\n\nGaziantep served a significant trade route within the Ottoman Empire. Armenians were active in manufacturing, agriculture production and, most notably, trade, and became the wealthiest ethnic group in the city,[18] until their wealth was confiscated during the Armenian genocide.[19]\n\nBattle of Marj Dabiq\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the beginning of his campaign against the Mamluks in 1516, the Ottoman sultan Selim I brought his army to Gaziantep en route to Syria. The city's Mamluk governor, Yunus Beg, submitted to Selim without a fight and gave him the keys to the castle on 20 August.[2]: 26 The next day, 21 August, Selim set up camp outside the city \"with great majesty and pomp\" and held meetings with local military commanders to discuss strategy for the upcoming battle.[2]: 26–7 The fateful Battle of Marj Dabiq took place just days later, on 24 August. Gaziantep, although not an active battle site, thus played a strategic role in the Ottoman conquest of the Mamluk sultanate.[2]: 27\n\nThe Ottoman victory at Marj Dabiq had profound consequences for Gaziantep, although its inhabitants had no way of knowing at the time. For the first time in almost 1,000 years, Gaziantep was located in the middle of an empire rather than a contested border region. It lost its strategic importance, but also its vulnerability to attack. For four centuries, until the French occupation in 1921, Gaziantep was relatively peaceful.[2]: 27\n\nEconomic recovery\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the short term, though, Gaziantep was still reeling from the instability before (and after) the Ottoman conquest.[2]: 28–9 During that period, Gaziantep had suffered from \"depredation\", as well as fear caused by political uncertainty.[2]: 29 Besides political conflict, the city's economic slump at this time can also be partly attributed to a general decline in commerce in the eastern Mediterranean region that caused a general economic downturn in the region in the early 1500s.[2]: 31–2\n\nOnly around the 1530s, when the Ottoman authorities turned their attention to the territories recently conquered from Dulkadir, do cadastral records indicate renewed prosperity in Gaziantep.[2]: 28, 30–1 An important event was Süleyman the Magnificent's successful Mesopotamian campaign against Safavid Iran in 1534-36, which took Baghdad and increased the security of trade routes in Gaziantep's region.[2]: 31 As with the earlier economic downturn, the renewed prosperity in Gaziantep in the 1530s was part of a broader regional pattern of economic growth during this period.[2]: 32\n\nAs a disclaimer – some of this apparent economic growth may be an artifact of using tax documents as a source. Tax assessors may have simply been doing more accurate counts in later surveys, or the government might have been applying more strict scrutiny as their control increased.[2]: 32 Part of this was deliberate – the Ottomans had a policy of lowering taxes in recently conquered territories, both to placate locals and to provide an economic stimulus to help war-torn areas recover.[2]: 32–3 Later, as their control solidified, the authorities would raise taxes again. According to Leslie Peirce, this seems to have been the case in Gaziantep – tax rates in 1536 were significantly lower than the rates in 1520, which she assumes were the pre-Ottoman rates. The rates went up again in the 1543 survey, which she interprets as the Ottomans raising taxes again in the meantime.[2]: 33\n\nAdministrative changes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Dulkadir emirate did not simply go away immediately after the Ottoman victory at Marj Dabiq. It stuck around as an Ottoman vassal until 1522, when the last Dulkadir ruler \"resisted discipline by the Ottoman administration\". The Ottomans had him executed and officially dismantled the Dulkadir principality, annexing its territories to the empire to form the beglerbeglik of Dulkadir.[2]: 25\n\nDespite being part of the former Dulkadir territories, though, the sanjak of Gaziantep was initially put under the beglerbeglik of Aleppo instead of Dulkadir. This indicates how, just as in the Mamluk period, Gaziantep was then seen more as part of northern Syria than as part of Anatolia. The area was \"culturally mixed\", and many locals were bilingual in Turkish and Arabic (as well as other languages). Gaziantep's cultural and economic ties were mostly with Aleppo, which was a major international center of trade.[2]: 27\n\nAt some point in the 1530s, Gaziantep was moved into the beglerbeglik of Dulkadir, whose capital was Maraş. Even though it was now administratively part of Dulkadir, Gaziantep remained commercially more connected to Aleppo.[2]: 27\n\n17th through 19th centuries\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 17th-century Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi noted it had 3,900 shops and two bedestens.\n\nIn 1818, Gaziantep was moved back into the Aleppo province.[2]: 27\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, Aintab had a population of about 45,000, two-thirds of whom were Muslim—largely Turkish, but also partially Arab. A large community of Christians lived in the Armenian community. In the 19th century, considerable American Protestant Christian missionary activity occurred in Aintab.[20][21] In particular, Central Turkey College was founded in 1874 by the American Mission Board and largely served the Armenian community. The Armenians were systemically slaughtered during the Hamidian massacres in 1895 and later the Armenian genocide in 1915.[22][23] Consequently, the Central Turkey College was transferred to Aleppo in 1916.\n\nRepublic of Turkey\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the First World War and Armistice of Mudros, Gaziantep was occupied by the United Kingdom on 17 December 1918, and it was transferred to France on 5 November 1919.[24] The French Armenian Legion was also involved in occupation. In April 1920 irregular Turkish troops known as Kuva-yi Milliye besieged the city,[25] but the 10-month-long battle resulted in French victory.[26] Around 6,000 Turkish civilians were killed in the process.[27]\n\nThe French made the last attempt to revive the Armenian community in the city during the Siege of Aintab, where the Armenians who fled the genocide were promised their homes back in their native lands. However, on 25 December 1921, the Treaty of Ankara was signed, and as a result, the French evacuated the city.\n\nAccording to Ümit Kurt, born in modern-day Gaziantep and an academic at Harvard's Center for Middle East Studies, \"The famous battle of Aintab against the French … seems to have been as much the organised struggle of a group of genocide profiteers seeking to hold onto their loot as it was a fight against an occupying force. The resistance … sought to make it impossible for the Armenian repatriates to remain in their native towns, terrorising them [again] to make them flee. In short, not only did the local … landowners, industrialists, and civil-military bureaucratic elites lead to the resistance movement, but they also financed it to cleanse Aintab of Armenians.\"[28] The same Turkish families who made their wealth through the expropriation of Armenians in 1915 and 1921/1922 continued to dominate the city's politics through the one-party period of the Republic of Turkey.[29]\n\nIn 2013, Turkey, a member state of NATO, requested deployment of MIM-104 Patriot missiles to Gaziantep to be able to respond faster in a case of military operation against Turkish soil in the Syrian Civil War, which was accepted.[30]\n\nOn 6 February 2023, the city and nearby areas were devastated by catastrophic earthquakes. Around 900 buildings collapsed[31] and 10,777 other buildings were heavily damaged in the city, which have been slated for demolition.[32] Historic buildings including the Gaziantep Castle, the Şirvani Mosque and the Liberation Mosque were also heavily damaged.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is located on the Aintab plateau.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nGaziantep has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa, Trewartha: Cs), with very hot, dry summers and cool, wet and often snowy winters.\n\nAccording to 1966 data, on average, Gaziantep experiences 4.6 snowy days per winter with 10 days of snow cover, along with 2.5 days of hail.[34]: 302\n\nHighest recorded temperature: 44.0 °C (111.2 °F) on 29 July 2000 and 14 August 2023\n\nLowest recorded temperature: −17.5 °C (0.5 °F) on 15 January 1950[35]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe current mayor of Gaziantep is Fatma Şahin,[39] who had previously served as the minister of family and social policies in the third cabinet of Erdoğan.\n\nMayors Of Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality\n\n[edit]\n\nMayors of Gaziantep[40] Mayor Years of service Fatma Şahin (AK Party) 2014–present Asım Güzelbey (AK Party) 2004–2014 Celal Doğan (SHP, CHP) 1989–2004 Ömer Arpacıoğlu (ANAP) 1984–1989\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nGaziantep is famous for its regional specialities: copperware and \"Yemeni\" sandals, specific to the region, are two examples. The city is an economic centre for Southeastern and Eastern Turkey. The number of large industrial businesses established in Gaziantep comprise four percent of Turkish industry in general, while small industries comprise six percent. Also, Gaziantep has the largest organised industrial area in Turkey and holds first position in exports and imports.[41] The city is the centre of the green olive oil-based Nizip Soap industry.\n\nTraditionally, commerce in Gaziantep was centre in covered markets known as 'Bedesten' or 'Hans', the best known of which are the Zincirli Bedesten, Hüseyin Pasha Bedesten and Kemikli Bedesten.\n\nGaziantep also has a developing tourist industry. Development around the base of the castle upgrades the beauty and accessibility to the castle and to the surrounding copper workshops. New restaurants and tourist-friendly businesses are moving into the area. In comparison with some other regions of Turkey, tourists are still a novelty in Gaziantep and the locals make them very welcome.[citation needed] Many students studying the English language are willing to be guides for tourists.\n\nGaziantep is one of the leading producers of machined carpets in the world. It exported approximately US$700 million of machine-made carpets in 2006. There are over 100 carpet facilities in the Gaziantep Organized Industrial Zone.[citation needed]\n\nWith its extensive olive groves, vineyards, and pistachio orchards, Gaziantep is one of the important agricultural and industrial centres of Turkey.[citation needed]\n\nGaziantep is the centre of pistachio cultivation in Turkey, producing 60,000 metric tons (59,000 long tons; 66,000 short tons) in 2007, and lends its name to the Turkish word for pistachio, Antep fıstığı, meaning \"Antep nut\".\n\nGaziantep is the main centre for pistachio processing in Turkey, with some 80% of the country's pistachio processing (such as shelling, packaging, exporting, and storage) being done in the city.[42] \"Antep fıstığı\" is a protected geographical indication in Turkey; it was registered under this status in 2000.[42]\n\nIn 2009, the largest enclosed shopping centre in the city and region, Sanko Park, opened, and began drawing a significant number of shoppers from Syria.[43]\n\nTies between Turkey and Syria have severely deteriorated since the beginning of the Syrian civil war in 2011.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nGaziantep is mostly inhabited by Turks.[44] It is also inhabited by a significant minority of Kurds,[44] about 450 thousand people,[45] and roughly 470 thousand Syrian refugees.[44]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn early 14th century, Arab geographer Dimashki noted that the people of Aintab were Turkomans.[17] Aintab continued to be Turkish or Turkoman majority through 18th,[46] 19th,[47][48][49][50] and 20th centuries.[51][52][10][4] Armenians inhabited Aintab from at least 10th century until the Armenian genocide.[53] Having abandoned Armenian in favour of Turkish as early as the 16th century,[54] the Armenians of Aintab predominantly spoke Turkish,[55][46][56][57][50] while the usage of Armenian increased after 1850.[54] The city also housed a smaller Jewish minority predominantly of Sephardic origin.[58] The Jewish population quickly decreased in mid-20th century, reaching zero people by 1980s.[59] Unlike most Southeastern Anatolian cities, the city of Gaziantep did not have a significant Kurdish minority until the 20th century, when it saw an increase in its Kurdish population through economically motivated migration from Turkish Kurdistan.[60] Up until the late 2010s, the Kurdish population increased to one fourth of the city and the province with 400,000 - 450,000 Kurds.[45] In the late Ottoman era, the city included a number of Europeans and Americans.[61] Aintab also had a sizable Uzbek minority dating back to the Ottoman rule.[62][63]\n\nMother tongue composition of the city proper of Gaziantep in 1927 according to Turkish census[65] Languages Speakers % Turkish 38,281 95.7 Arabic 873 2.2 Kurdish 491 1.2 Other 359 0.9 Total 40,004 100\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nCuisine\n\n[edit]\n\nGaziantep is largely regarded as the city with the richest cuisine in Turkey.[66] It was the first city in Turkey to be designated as a City of Gastronomy by UNESCO in 2015.[67][68] In 2013, Gaziantep baklava became the first Turkish product with a European protected designation of origin and geographical indication.[69]\n\nThe cuisine of Aintab was attested to be \"rich\" by many travellers throughout the centuries. 19th-century British traveller noted:[70]\n\n\"The padishah himself would do well to visit Aintab, just to taste the rich food to be found there.\"\n\nTypes of kofta (Turkish: köfte; Gaziantep dialect: küfte[71]) include içli küfte (lit. 'stuffed kofta'), sini küfte, yoğurtlu küfte, yağlı küfte (lit. 'greasy kofta'), tahinli küfte, pendir ekmekli küfte (lit. 'kofta with bread and cheese'), and more.[72] Some koftas do not include any meat such as yapma[73] and malhıtalı küfte (lit. 'lentil kofta').[74]\n\nPilafs in the Aintab cuisine often accompany the main dish and are not the main course alone. Traditionally, bulgur is used for the pilafs. The bulgur pilafs can include orzo (Şehriyeli bulgur pilavı; Şʿāreli burgul pilov) or ground beef (Kıymalı aş or Meyhane pilavı, lit. 'tavern pilaf').[72]\n\nThere are several types of exclusively-Armenian soups in Aintab cuisine. These include vardapet soup and omız zopalı.[72]\n\nVegetable dishes of Aintab often include meat but can be vegetarian as well. These include dorgama (doğrama), moussaka, bezelye, bakla, kuru fasulye, mutanya, türlü,[72] and kabaklama.[75] Dolma is a very common dish, different variants of which are cooked. One is kış dolması (lit. 'winter dolma'), for which dried vegetables, such as squash, eggplants, and peppers are used.\n\nCommon sweets include bastık and sucuk.\n\nLocal Turkish dialect\n\n[edit]\n\nThe local Turkish dialect of Gaziantep is classified as a part of the Western Turkish dialects based on phonetic and grammatical similarities.[76][77] The dialect carries influences mainly from Armenian and Arabic.[78] The local Turkish dialect of Gaziantep is an integral part of the native identity of the city[79] and is being preserved through often humorous plays by theatrical troupes, such as Çeled Uşaglar (lit. naughty children).[80]\n\nMuseums\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Gaziantep Museum of Archaeology has collections of ceramic pieces from the Neolithic Age; various objects, figures and seals from the Chalcolithic and Bronze Ages; stone and bronze objects, jewellery, ceramics, coins, glass objects, mosaics and statues from the Hittite, Urartu, Greek Persian, Roman, Commagene, and Byzantine periods.\n\nThe Zeugma Mosaic Museum houses mosaics from Zeugma and other mosaics, a total of 1,700 square metres (18,000 sq ft).[81][citation needed] It opened to the public on 9 September 2011.[82]\n\nThe Hasan Süzer Ethnography Museum, a restored late-Ottoman stone building, has the old life style decoration and collections of various weapons, documents, instruments used in the defence of the city as well as the photographs of local resistance heroes.

historical core of Gaziantep is located on the Alleben Creek to the north and with heights to the south.[88]: 64 The location of the city among these heights was likely because of their defensibility.[88]: 64\n\nHistorically, the main trade axis was the route from the castle then going southeast along the road to Aleppo.[89]: 8, 13 A number of hans were built along this street.[89]: 8 Due to the hot climate, the city's streets were very narrow in order to maximize shade from the buildings.[89]: 9 Orientation of buildings was important so they could not see into each other's courtyards (an important private space, especially for women) and so that they would not block sunlight from neighboring houses.[89]: 6, 9\n\nGenerally, the city's population was organized according to ethno-religious groups who lived close together in the same neighborhood.[89]: 9–10 Around the time of World War I, the city's population was divided between Muslims in the east and non-Muslims (mostly Armenians) in the west.[90]: 197 Muslims lived in the Karagöz, Çukur, Tıslaki, and Şekeroğlu districts; Armenians lived in the Akyol and Bey districts; and Jews lived in the Düğmeci and Karagöz districts.[89]: 10\n\nAn early city planning effort took place in 1891 under Mustafa Ağa, the first mayor of Gaziantep, involving a city plan and province map.[88]: 64 According to Kuyucu and Özer, though, the resulting maps and plans are unavailable.[88]: 64 Another early city plan for Gaziantep was drawn up by Barsumyan and Nazaryan in the early 1920s, during the Turkish War of Independence.[90]: 197 [89]: 11 The Barsumyan-Nazaryan plan included an airport for the city but omitted any railway connections.[90]: 197 During this period, because the Jewish and Armenian communities had left the city during the war period, the city did not expand into new areas; instead, now-vacant neighborhoods were used to meet new demand.[88]: 64\n\nThe Jansen plan (1938)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the first years of the Republic of Turkey, new city planning laws were enacted requiring all major cities to have development plans.[88]: 64 In 1938, the Gaziantep municipality requested that Hermann Jansen draw up a plan for the city.[90]: 200 : 199–200 The resulting Jansen plan was the first large-scale city planning initiative in Gaziantep, and many of its proposals were ultimately put into action.[88]: 67\n\nThe Jansen plan sought to preserve the existing urban character of Gaziantep while also planning new areas outside the traditional core.[88]: 64 It mainly focused on new development on the north, south, and west sides of the city.[90]: 200 New industrial zones were drawn up along important transportation arteries, particularly the Nizip and Aleppo roads.[90]: 200 The most important was a 33-hectare industrial zone on the north side of town, which was to be connected to the railway network.[90]: 200 The new industrial area was specifically chosen to be on the northeast because the prevailing wind direction is from the northwest, so this way air pollution would not be blown over the city.[88]: 66\n\nThe plan introduced several important changes to the city's transportation network.[88]: 64 One of the most important was the addition of a rail line to connect Gaziantep to the national rail system.[88]: 64 Up to now, Turkish railway construction had ignored Gaziantep (partly because of its mountainous surroundings); a national railway plan also introduced in 1938 left Gaziantep unconnected to the rail network.[90]: 198–9 The Jansen plan represented the first major proposal to construct a railway to Gaziantep.[90]: 200 Jansen wanted to put the train station on the north side of the city, for multiple reasons.[88]: 64–5 First, because the topography on the north side is flatter; and second, because putting a railway on the south side would separate the old town from the new planned residential areas further south, which Jansen wanted to avoid.[88]: 65\n\nJansen also planned significant changes to the city's streets, opening up several new boulevards and widening pre-existing streets to help make a continuous transportation network.[88]: 65 He proposed combining the Narlı and Aleppo roads into İsmet İnönü Caddesi, which was to be the main transportation axis of the city.[88]: 65 The existing commercial axis along the Aleppo road, lined with hans and marketplaces, was to be expanded with new commercial buildings along the new İnönü Cd.[88]: 65–6 The plan also sought to create a SW-NE axis connecting the Kilis and Nizip roads by way of İstasyon Caddesi in the north and Atatürk Caddesi in the west; this axis would also be connected to İnönü Cd.[88]: 65 Two important pre-existing streets in the old town, Suburcu Cd and Eski Saray Cd, would also be expanded and connected with these other streets.[88]: 65 Finally, besides road and rail, Jansen also proposed the construction of an airport on the west side of town.[88]: 65\n\nOne of the most important features of the Jansen Plan was the designation of a green belt along Alleben Creek, running east–west across the entire city, where no construction was to take place.[88]: 66 This would provide a large open recreational area.[88]: 66 Jansen also proposed a large area to the north of the creek to be used for sports fields and a hippodrome, although these were never built.[88]: 66\n\nThe Jansen plan zoned for new residential areas to the south of the old city.[88]: 65 This may have been done to follow the pre-existing main axis along the southbound Aleppo road.[88]: 65 It may have also been because Jansen wanted the existing houses of the old city to be visible from the south.[88]: 65 He wanted to build new residential areas in a similar fashion, with two-story houses arranged on parallel streets that followed the slope of hills.[88]: 65 In order to provide space for the southward residential expansion, Jansen proposed that the pre-existing cemetery on the south side of town be moved to a new planned location in the northeast.[88]: 65–6\n\nTo the northwest of the old city, Jansen wanted to build one-story houses among vineyards in a low-density agricultural area.[88]: 65 The proposed workers' quarter, in the northeast near the planned industrial zone, was to follow a similar plan, with low-cost single-story houses.[88]: 65\n\nFor the city's new administrative buildings, Jansen chose to develop the Çukurbostan area, located in the old city center but with some vacant space available.[88]: 66 In a departure from his typical policy of not modifying the old urban fabric, also proposed demolishing some existing buildings and altering the pre-existing street layout to accommodate this new construction.[88]: 66\n\nImpact\n\n[edit]\n\nMany elements of the Jansen plan were ultimately put into action, and it had a significant influence on how Gaziantep was built during the 20th century.[88]: 66 It especially shaped the city's transport network: the construction of a rail line on the north side, the opening of new transportation axes such as İnönü Cd, and the expansion of existing roads were all realized.[88]: 66 The expansion of commercial areas along the old Aleppo road led to the development of İnönü Cd as one of the city's main commercial axes, a role it still plays today.[88]: 66 The airport area he proposed, however, was never built – in the 1950s, as urbanization and population growth created new demand, the area was turned into a residential zone instead.[88]: 66\n\nThe planned residential expansion to the south did take place, as did the proposed relocation of the cemetery to the northeast, but ultimately the main direction of residential expansion shifted to the northwest instead.[88]: 66 This is partly because the hilly area to the south is less conducive for construction.[88]: 67 The industrial zone on the northeast was built, but the adjacent workers' quarter never materialized.[88]: 66 Although the recreational areas to the north were never built, the Alleben green belt became an important green space in the city, and it remains to this day (although some of it has since been turned over for new construction).[88]: 66 Jansen's recommendation of low-rise development also succeeded at preserving the silhouette of the city until the 1970s.[88]: 66\n\nOne failing of the Jansen plan was that it significantly underestimated the population growth of the city during the next 50 years, particularly after 1945.[88]: 66 This lack led to the growth of uncontrolled, unplanned settlements in the city.[88]: 67 In addition, Jansen's general non-intervention policy with the old city center proved insufficient to maintain its character – in the absence of managed oversight, many old buildings ended up deteriorating, ultimately getting demolished, and then being replaced with new structures that architecturally did not blend in.[88]: 67\n\nThe Aru-Söylemezoğlu plan (1955)\n\n[edit]\n\nBy the 1950s, Gaziantep's rapid growth was outpacing the Jansen plan's limits, resulting in the creation of unplanned settlements (such as Karşıyaka in the north and Düztepe in the south) and prompting the creation of a new city plan.[91]: 556 This plan, drawn up by Kemal Ahmet Aru and Hamit Kemali Söylemezoğlu in 1955, continued the basic principles of the Jansen plan while adding some revisions.[91]: 556 The city's shape remained compact and focused around a single center, which was now being extended towards the south and west.[91]: 556–7\n\nThe main goal of the Aru-Söylemezoğlu plan was to provide new housing to meet the needs of the growing urban population.[91]: 560 There was also an effort to shift from agriculturally-oriented economy to industrial.[91]: 560\n\nAmong the important features introduced in the Aru-Söylemezoğlu plan were the railway station, now in its current location, and the addition of the new İpek Yolu highway as a northwards continuation of İstasyon Cd.[91]: 556 The new planned upscale residential neighborhoods of Bahçelievler, Kavaklık, and Öğretmenevleri signalled a shift towards building new neighborhoods to the southwest.[91]: 556 Ordu Cd, a westward extension of Atatürk Cd, was opened up, and the Kilis-Aleppo axis shifted to this route.[91]: 556–7 In general, the Aru-Söylemezoğlu plan planned a grid plan for the city's streets.[89]: 10\n\nThe area north of Alleben Creek, which under the Jansen plan had been designated as recreational areas, were converted into residential development under Aru-Söylemezoğlu plan.[91]: 557 Several small new industrial areas were also developed around Nizip Cd, Araban Yolu, and İpek Yolu.[91]: 556\n\nThe Can plan (1973)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1973, a competition was organized under the supervision of İller Bank to draft a third city zoning plan for Gaziantep; it was held simultaneously with ones in Konya and Kayseri.[91]: 557 The Gaziantep contest was won by a team led by Zühtü Can and also including Yalçın Alaybeyoğlu, Abdullah Dellaloğlu, Müzeyyen Can, and Haluk Aral.[91]: 557 The resulting Can plan consisted of several stages guiding the city's development until a target year of 1995, when they projected a population of 1 million for Gaziantep.[91]: 557\n\nThe Can plan focused on developing Gaziantep as an industrial center, with an increasing share of land dedicated to industrial use.[91]: 557 These industrial areas were also increasingly set apart from residential areas.[91]: 561 The Can plan envisioned a three-pole city with industrial areas at the west and east ends and new residential development in the south.[91]: 557 Gaziantep's Organized Industrial Zone had been established in 1969 and was one of the first in Turkey.[91]: 558 By 1978, manufacturing had reached 11.6% of Gaziantep's GDP,[91]: 561 compared to about 17% for the country as a whole.[92]\n\nThe 1970s were Gaziantep's highest period of immigration.[91]: 558 New residential development during this period was clustered into two main areas.[91]: 558 The first area was neighborhoods on the south and east sides of town like Karşıyaka, Düztepe, and Çıksorut, where many manufacturing jobs were available.[91]: 558 The second consisted of areas on the north and west where relatively higher-income people who worked in the service sector lived.[91]: 558 The patterns for urban development differed between these two areas.[91]: 558 In the south and east, there was an irregular settlement pattern formed by purchasing land around factories.[91]: 558 In the north and west, there was a regular grid of wide streets lined with houses and apartment complexes.[91]: 558\n\nBeginning in the mid-1980s, the Can plan was undermined by illegal building and zoning amnesties, which disrupted the plan's form and caused the city to grow in unplanned ways.[91]: 558 The municipal government tried to address the situation by performing piecemeal interventions to rehabilitate these areas, but ultimately the effect was that poorly integrated pockets of the city were formed.[91]: 558\n\nThe Aldan plan (1990)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe problem of illegal construction in the late 80s, combined with the introduction of the Metropolitan Municipality Law and changes to national zoning regulations such as Zoning Law 3194 (both giving cities increased authority in urban planning as opposed to the central government), necessitated an updated city plan.[91]: 558, 61 This plan, the fourth one in Gaziantep's history, was drafted in 1990 by H. Oğuz Aldan.[91]: 558 The Aldan plan had a target year of 2005, with a predicted population of about 1.8 million.[91]: 558 It planned for the city to expand to 8010 ha, of which 26% would be residential, 22% would be industrial, and 17% would be open green spaces.[91]: 558\n\nThe Aldan plan followed a metropolitan, polycentric model, with new commercial zones mixed in with the residential areas to serve as secondary urban centers.[91]: 558 The main directions for new development were toward the west and south.[91]: 558 A new ring road on the east, south, and west helped boost growth in these directions.[91]: 558 Some of the new secondary centers were built in the Karataş and İbrahimli areas.[91]: 559 Another major addition was a new commercial area on the east side of the city called the Gaziantep Ticaret ve Endüstri Merkezi (Gaziantep Trade and Industry Center), or GATEM for short.[91]: 559 Located on the Araban-Adıyaman highway, on the city's outskirts, the GATEM was to occupy 40 ha and also include an intercity bus terminal.[91]: 559\n\nIn the 21st century\n\n[edit]\n\nSince the 2000s, a number of smaller-scale targeted projects have taken place, such as local rezoning of industrial areas in the Ünaldı neighborhood; reworking unplanned settlements that do not meet building standards; and various other development projects (for example in areas like Bağlarbaşı, Geneyik, Sarıgüllük, Halep Bulvarı, Kilis Yolu, and Orta Tepe).[91]: 559–60\n\nZoo\n\n[edit]\n\nGaziantep Zoo is one of the largest zoos in Turkey. Especially interesting are the bird pavilion and the aquarium. Gaziantep Zoo offers a large variety of animals, attractive picnic grounds, and a cafeteria. The facility is established on 1,000,000-square-metre (11,000,000 sq ft) field. There are 264 species and 6,814 animals.\n\nGaziantep Zoo White deer\n\nRed-necked wallaby\n\nGaziantep Zoo Eagles\n\nInternational relations\n\n[edit]\n\nTwin towns — sister cities\n\n[edit]\n\nGaziantep is twinned with:[93][94][95]\n\nNotable people from Gaziantep\n\n[edit]\n\nSee Category:People from Gaziantep\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nTurkey portal\n\nFranco-Turkish War (Cilicia War)\n\nRumkale\n\nZeugma\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
