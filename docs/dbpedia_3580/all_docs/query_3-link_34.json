One day I was jarred from my nap by a call from an old friend: “Ümit, where have you been? It’s been ages! I know a ­great place in Kayacık where we can catch up.” Though I was born and raised in Aintab and ­hadn’t left the city ­until college, the word “Kayacık” did not mean anything to me. It was just another district in the city, a neighborhood I had never visited, of which I knew nothing. She said she would wait for me at Papirüs Café and gave me directions. I took a bus to the Kayacık neighborhood, and upon arrival found myself dazed by the charming atmosphere, letting myself get lost in the side streets, and leaving my poor friend waiting some more. Embarrassed by my obliviousness, I found myself asking, “Where am I? What is this place?” I was on a narrow street with beautifully constructed stone ­houses lining each side, taking me back to a simpler, though slightly mysterious, time. Tucked away between the high-­rise concrete apartment buildings of “modernized” Gaziantep, this neighborhood was like an architectural mirage. I felt nostalgic for a past that was never mine.\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nFi­nally, I found Papirüs Café, which turned out to be located in one of t­ hose exotic ­houses. Like most of the ­houses on the street, it had been converted into a café as part of the pro­cess of “restoring” the city. Upon entering, a few letters carved at the top of the majestic gate caught my eye. Not recognizing the script, I simply assumed t­ hese w ­ ere Ottoman characters. Inside, I was once more left speechless. A spacious courtyard with staircases on e­ ither side leading up to two large rooms welcomed me. The rooms ­were filled with antique furnishings, and the high ceilings ­were adorned with frescos and engravings similar to Florentine cathedrals. The experience was a kind of historical voyeurism, like stepping into a living museum. Feeling a surge of pride in my hometown and ancestors, I de­cided to talk to the owner to try to glean some information about the history of the ­house. I approached him, intending only to compliment his establishment, but before I could stop myself, I asked, “I was just wondering, from whom did you get this place? Who was h ­ ere before you?” He wearily explained that he inherited this place from his grand­father. It must have been especially strong coffee they w ­ ere serving that day, as I was emboldened to press further. “And how about your grand­father? From whom did he buy this place?” The man paused hesitantly before responding. And then ­after a few moments, he softly murmured to the ground beneath him, “­There ­were Armenians ­here.” I asked, “What Armenians? What are you talking about? W ­ ere t­ here Armenians in Gaziantep?” He nodded. I was getting annoyed with the opacity of his answers. “So, what happened to them? Where did they go?” He retorted indifferently: “They left.” As I rode the bus back home, I pondered why the Armenians—­why anyone—­would just leave and hand over such an exquisite property to someone. I was a naïve-­to-­the-­point-­of-­ignorant twenty-­two-­year-­old university gradu­ate, unaware of the existence of Armenians in my hometown. A few years ­later, I would find out that the ­house belonged to Nazar Nazaretian, honorary consulate to Iran, who was a member of Aintab’s wealthiest and most prominent ­family, and that he, his ­children, and his grandchildren used to live in this ­house. ­Those letters above the gate w ­ ere not Ottoman but Armenian, spelling out the surname of Kara\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\nNazar Agha, who built the ­house. Years ­later, I would also have the chance to meet the youn­gest member of the f­amily, Shusan, whose grand­mother was deported at the age of one during the 1915 Armenian genocide. Shusan kindly spoke Turkish to me in Aintab dialect. That building is no longer Papirüs Café for me. For me, it is the ­house of Kara Nazar Agha, the Nazaretians’ home, the ­house where the grand­ mother of Shusan was born. Hence, for me, the ­houses in Kayacık are the homes of the Barsumians, Pirenians, Ashjians, Krajians, Leylekians, Jebejians, and Karamanougians. In Turkish, t­ here is a saying: “Mal sahibi, mülk sahibi, hani bunun ilk sahibi?” Roughly translated, it reads, “Landlord, property owner, where is the original owner?” This book is the story of the Aintab Armenians, who ­were torn away from their homes, neighborhoods, and the city where they ­were born and raised. This is the account of how their material and spatial wealth changed hands and was transformed. This is the historical rec­ord of their persecution and subsequent erasure.\n\nRUSSIA\n\nNN AA IIRR\n\nOT OT TO M TO A MA N E M N EM PIR PI E RE\n\nHadjin\n\nUN O M\n\nUS R U TA\n\nr. an\n\nUrfa\n\nE\n\nAMANUS MOUNTAINS\n\nJey h\n\nr.\n\nAdana an\n\nHromgla\n\nAintab\n\nsr .\n\nSei h\n\nMersina\n\nMarash\n\nSis\n\nuphra t e\n\nTarsus\n\nNS I Zeytoun A T\n\nAlexandretta Silifke\n\nAleppo\n\nAntioch\n\nMediterranean Sea Cyprus\n\nrt e s eRakka D r Zo r i Deir Zor De\n\nMeskene\n\nHama Homs\n\nSalammiyya\n\nmap 1 Cilicia region of the Late Ottoman Empire. © Ümit Kurt.\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\nSCALE: Miles\n\n90\n\nOriginal owner\n\nPresent-­day owner\n\n1.

As Martin Dean, an authority on Nazi looting and plundering of Jewish property, remarkably underlines, “ethnic cleansing” and genocide usually have a “power­ful materialist component: seizure of property, looting of the victims, and their economic displacement are intertwined with other motives for racial and interethnic vio­lence and intensify their devastating effects.”2 In the case of the Armenian genocide, the state-­orchestrated plunder of Armenian property immediately impoverished its victims; therefore, it was si­mul­ta­neously a condition for and a consequence of the genocide. The Armenians of the Ottoman Empire experienced calamity of the greatest degree during World War I. Many males, including youth, ­were executed outright, while the rest—­men, ­women, ­children, and the elderly—­were deported to barren lands in Iraq and Syria. Th ­ ose deported ­were subjected to e­ very manner of misery—­k idnapping, rape, torture, murder, and death from exposure, starvation, and thirst—by e­ very\n\n2\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\npos­si­ble adversary—­Ottoman gendarmes, Turkish and Kurdish irregulars, tribespeople, and the army. As Donald Bloxham emphasizes, ­those who escaped deportation, primarily w ­ omen and ­children, w ­ ere forced to convert to Islam, as Muslim identity was considered a cornerstone of the new nation-state, Turkey.3 Principally perpetrated by the “Committee of Union and Pro­gress” (İttihad ve Terakki Cemiyeti; hereafter CUP) elite, who largely controlled the Ottoman government at the time, ­these events constitute what we now know as the Armenian genocide. Cloaked ­under the guise of war, this vio­lence surpassed the war crimes of Rus­sia, Germany, and Austria-­Hungary.4 Through ­these policies and their mechanisms, the CUP achieved its goal of eliminating the “Armenian question” and establishing Anatolia as a “purified” homeland for ­those whom the CUP elite deemed the true Turkish ­peoples.5 The Ottoman Empire’s participation in World War I included a major campaign aimed at eliminating certain minorities—­first and foremost Armenians—­depicted by the CUP regime and Muslim society as dangerous and treacherous domestic enemies. This campaign led Armenians to be subjected to war­time mass deportation, internment, total extermination, and expropriation. However, the Ottoman Empire was by no means the only state to take mea­sures against its own citizens. Both Central and Allied Powers carried out brutal policies against domestic po­liti­cal suspects and e­ nemy aliens during the years 1914–1918.6 For example, Rus­sia’s campaign against its ­enemy citizens quickly widened in scope to include “the empire’s large population of ethnic Germans to Russian-­subject Jews, Muslims, and o ­ thers.”7 Only in one state, according to Matthew Stippe, the Ottoman Empire, did this “ ‘dynamic of destruction’ get pushed as far as genocide. In ­others, including Austria-­ Hungary, the quest for military security had murderous, rather than genocidal consequences” (italics added).8 Pursuing this global dynamic of vio­lence during the ­Great War, the CUP campaign resulted in the forced displacement of more than a million civilians, the nationalization of a substantial portion of the imperial economy, and the transfer of extensive lands, assets, and properties from the targeted minorities (Armenians, Greeks, and Assyrians) to favored groups. Historically, few governments formally took mea­sures in times of war against their own subjects.9 However, as Eric Lohr underscores, World\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nWar I introduced systematic and brutal mea­sures against e­ nemy citizens and other civilians, mea­sures that proliferated both during and ­a fter World War II.10 One cornerstone of the war­time campaign against Armenians in the Ottoman Empire was the confiscation of their properties and wealth, which w ­ ere subsequently transferred to Muslim elites and used in reshaping the domestic economy as well as covering war­ time expenses. Th ­ ese ­were among the radical practices of the CUP regime aimed at nationalizing the economy. First, many businesses and properties ­were transferred to state institutions. Second, a lesser but substantial number of firms w ­ ere transferred to “reliable” Muslim individuals and social institutions. More significant than the transfers themselves was the fact that ­these extraordinary mea­sures belonged to a set of laws, regulations, rules, and decrees that created a ­legal basis for a more systematic campaign against the movable and immovable properties of Armenians.11 In this capital transfer, we see that genocide also created the circumstances to enable “the complete fulfilment of the established policy of ethnic domination through expropriation.”12 Economic dispossession was far from a pro­cess carried out “from above” by means of the s­ imple execution of CUP o ­ rders. If the pro­cess of the economic exclusion of Armenians is to be described fully, a regional historical analy­sis is necessary. Not only w ­ ill the fundamental features of regional anti-­Armenian policy be examined, but decision-­ makers, local actors, provincial notables, and ordinary Muslims ­will be scrutinized in detail. In that sense, as Bloxham and Dirk Moses have suggested, “the m ­ atter of location tells us much about the po­liti­cal calculus underpinning genocide.”13 In fact, to grasp the full implications of state-­sponsored genocide, we must look at local atrocities and their long-­term outcomes. I employ evidence and materials provided by “local protagonists, in the form of diaries, letters, eyewitness accounts, testimonies, interviews, and memoirs.” As Omer Bartov and Eric Weitz have contended, “Only in this manner, the combination of standard state documentation with locally ­generated sources, can historians reconstruct local events in all their complexity and thereby gain more insight into the socio-­psychological makeup of interethnic vio­lence, its motivations, rationalizations, dynamics of perpetration, and subsequent narratives.”14\n\n4\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\nDrawing upon primary sources from Armenian, Ottoman-­Turkish, British, and French archives, as well as memoirs, personal papers, local newspapers, periodicals, testimonials, and oral accounts, this book explores how the pro­cess of genocide and deportation directed at the Armenians of Aintab—­present-­day Gaziantep, thirty-­five miles west of the Euphrates and twenty-­eight miles north of ­today’s Turkish-­Syrian border—­was implemented. Shifting focus from state to society, thereby prioritizing the local roots of a genocide in the making, this work highlights the crucial role played by local elites and provincial notables, actors who prospered in the new social stratum through the acquisition of Armenian property and wealth. In this re­spect, I argue that the CUP genocide and deportation decision had a degree of social support through the practice of effective power and control mechanisms at the local level. Influenced by renowned Holocaust scholar Frank Bajohr’s “Aryanization” in Hamburg and Martin Dean’s Robbing the Jews, this book treats Aintab as a microcosm to elucidate the confiscation and transfer of Armenian properties. This pro­cess was an essential component of the genocidal policy, and plunder was an influential incentive ­behind the support and involvement of local elites in the Armenian genocide.15 The sheer scale of actions constituting genocide could not be carried out by a single order from the central government. Therefore, local dynamics played an extremely impor­tant role in this destruction. This book provides a historical analy­sis of t­ hese dynamics, while paying attention to the po­liti­cal, ideological, social, and economic climate in Aintab—­a crucially impor­tant town and district of the time. The book investigates local and regional dynamics, with a par­tic­u­lar emphasis on the disintegration of social relations and the breakdown of social fabric in the city of Aintab, to contextualize the developments that led to the persecution, forced deportation, and mass murder of Armenians, and the dispossession of their property. As Hilmar Kaiser and Uğur Ümit Üngör successfully did in the case of Diyarbekir, I pay par­tic­u­lar attention to the local dynamics of genocide—­its po­liti­cal, social, and economic legacies, and the roles of local actors and civilian and military authorities—­but this book distinguishes itself from t­hose scholars’ works by combining Armenian and Turkish documentation as well as employing unmined\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nArmenian and Turkish sources.16 ­Doing so enables me to demonstrate the complex picture of not only the relations between central and local actors but also each group’s internal relations. The book thus brings together analy­sis at the macro level (contextualizing the genocide in a global and national context), the meso level (revealing and discussing the activities of the vari­ous “middlemen” of vio­lence—­notables, midranking officers, and tribal leaders), and fi­nally the micro level (dissecting how the pro­cess unfolded in the vari­ous regional microcosms)— an approach that has been missing in the lit­er­a­ture. The book also provides new insights on the c­ auses and origins of genocidal policies and their impact in the making and remaking of provincial elites and, by extension, of the modern Turkish Republic. Thus, the scope of the book is not ­limited to the sale and liquidation of Armenian properties; it treats confiscation as an all-­encompassing displacement pro­cess whose po­liti­cal and social under­pinnings and historical context must be considered in tandem. At the core of the book is a series of studies of the nationalization of state practices at the local level: the expropriation and liquidation of properties and businesses of Armenians; their forced mass deportations; and extermination. The book focuses on the origins and implementation of ­these practices in the city of Aintab.\n\nAs Jan T. Gross eloquently remarks, the participation of local populations is “a necessary condition to ensure the effectiveness of genocidal policies.”17 The CUP relied to a considerable extent on the cooperation of the local administrations and elites, po­liti­cal institutions, and ordinary citizens in Aintab. With this cooperation in mind, certain questions arise. How w ­ ere the CUP and their local collaborators able to mobilize society? How did Armenian properties change hands? How did the distribution of properties establish an impor­tant degree of local complicity? Collaboration as well as tensions between central and local authorities in the course of the violent appropriation of large amounts of property, with or without the permission of the central and local authorities, are also examined.\n\n6\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\nIf genocide, as a practice that includes murder and plunder, is orchestrated by a central authority but implemented at the local level, what is the relationship between local and central authorities? How can we explain the support of Muslim elites in encouraging and implementing the genocidal policies of the central authority—in the case of the Armenian genocide, the CUP? Did the CUP distribute Armenian property to Aintab gentry and its inhabitants in exchange for their support? If so, which institutions w ­ ere involved? What kinds of laws, rules, and regulations did state authorities enact for the confiscation of Armenian property? ­These ­will be the guiding questions in this book.18 They cut across a number of research areas in Ottoman and ­Middle Eastern history, some of which have been more thoroughly explored than ­others. A careful examination and analy­sis of ­these issues can tell us more about the implementation of the Armenian genocide and the significance of Armenian property in the context of the entire pro­cess of destruction. The concept of local or provincial elites is central to my understanding of the elite-­making pro­cess. The term “provincial elites”19 is generally associated with ayan, notables who held a dominant place in the Ottoman provinces beginning in the late seventeenth ­century.20 Po­liti­cal, social, and economic power was the defining feature of ­these provincial elites. Predominantly Muslim, not only did they include members of the military, the learned institutions (institutions dedicated to education), religious personnel, administrative staff, and artisans, but they also occasionally consisted of dervish sheikhs, w ­ omen, and even non-­Muslims.21 As Antonis Anastasopoulos explains, they could “facilitate the implementation of government policies and guarantee relative order in the provinces”; in turn, “state acknowledgement or government appointment enhanced” t­ hese local notables’ prestige and authority.22 More modest families consisted of local notables with some po­liti­cal power. ­These ayan had “more in common with con­temporary patriciates in Eu­rope than the military magnates of the Ottoman realm.”23 The participation of the local populace in robbing their Armenian neighbors is seen as the product of an increasing radicalization and loss of restraint resulting from the breakdown of social ties along ethnic, religious, and economic lines. I seek to scrutinize both the role of the local population as witnesses to the Armenian genocide and also the im-\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\npact of the radical Turkish economic exploitation of the Armenians, which led to ­bitter social conflicts over scarce resources, contributing to this development in the case of Aintab. While official CUP policy intended for all Armenian property to be confiscated for the benefit of the Turkish administration, material rewards clearly acted as an incentive for collaboration at the regional level. Administrators recognized this motive and tolerated or encouraged it as they saw fit, often taking their own cut. Consequently, the Armenian genocide was much more complicated than the outcome of a ­simple top-­down decision-­making pro­cess in which the CUP leadership assigned, enforced, and oversaw exterminationist policies while local Muslims acted as passive, indifferent bystanders. This book holds not only that the relationship between the central power and regional and local authorities was one-­directional and hierarchical, but also that regional offices and the central authority mutually influenced each other. Jongerden and Verheij’s poly-­centricity and poly-­activity theory, in Social Relations in Ottoman Diyarbekir, 1870–1915, is useful in understanding and explaining the dialectic, dynamic, and complicated structure of the relationship between the center and periphery.24 With “poly-­centricity,” the authors refer to a “shift of attention from the so-­called center to the so-­called periphery,” and with “poly-­ activity,” “a move from an exclusive focus on the acts and deeds of the elite alone, to one that includes also t­ hose of multiple subaltern categories.”25 In a similar fashion, local actors in Aintab ­were not simply engaged in implementing ­orders or opposing them; t­ hese actors functioned as a structural ele­ment that was pre­sent throughout the pro­cess. Thus, beyond serving as intermediaries between the outside authority and the locals or patrons of the local populace, t­ hese local actors w ­ ere an authority in their own right. Following this conceptual framework, it can be claimed that as much as the Armenian genocide was a top-­down pro­cess, it was equally led from the bottom up via a multitude of multifaceted relations between the central power and local authorities. Beyond any doubt, genocide and plunder ­were centrally planned, yet I argue that mass participation arose primarily from local incentives and motives. At the same time, one would not expect t­ hese motives to be unan­i­mous or lacking nuance and\n\n8\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\nchange. They ­were both economic and social. On the economic side, the prospect of loot, for example, incentivized local collaborators to support massacres and deportations. Realizing the potential, the CUP leadership deliberately instrumentalized the promise of spoil and plunder to cajole public participation. The central government was well aware of the fact that provincial notables, local landowners and bigwigs, officials, and a range of other p ­ eople with vested interests tried to take possession of Armenian wealth. ­These actors found themselves in a fortuitous position. Not only did their actions fulfill the ideological requirements of the regime, but t­ hese actions also brought material gain in the form of expropriated and pillaged Armenian properties. Th ­ ese ­factors in combination served to catalyze further the persecution of Armenians. Thus, a “reward mechanism” was created by which the CUP could draw po­liti­cal and social support for decisions to deport and massacre Armenians.26 The profiteers justified their confiscation and seizure of Armenian wealth not as robbery or plunder but as fair reward for their participation in the elimination of “harmful and traitorous ele­ments.”27 Beyond base greed, the fervor with which they executed the genocide on the local level must be understood in part as a result of the rationalization that they ­were acting in the ser­vice of the Ottoman state. On the social side, it is impor­tant to consider the role of stolen and confiscated Armenian assets in the integration and consolidation of the pro­cess of “Turkification” or a Muslim-­controlled Milli İktisat (National Economy).28 The main purpose of “Turkification” was the dispossession of countless thousands of Armenians and their systematic removal from virtually ­every sector of the economy by transferring Armenian movable and immovable properties and businesses to “Turkish” hands.29 To date the lit­er­a­ture has largely ignored the participation of many “ordinary” Muslims from manifold classes in the massacres of Armenians. Motivated in large part by material profit, the actions of t­ hese actors reflected the prevailing attitude of Turkish-­Muslims, that of indifference and dispassion. One of the main tasks of my study is to explicate the economic and social atmosphere in Aintab, which allowed the local administrators, members of the Aintab gentry, and ordinary Muslims (Aintab’s inhabitants) to radicalize their views and policies against the Armenians and to disclose how this atmosphere expedited the depor-\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\ntation. By focusing on Aintab, I hope to shed light on the origins of the property and wealth of Muslim elites, as well as the means by which properties of massacred and deported Armenians changed hands.\n\nAintab was a frontier city that lay at the crossroads of vari­ous states, cultures, and civilizations; and control of the city over its history changed hands among Muslims, Byzantines, and numerous crusading armies including the Mamluks and the Turcomans. The city, situated on a high and fertile plan to the east of the Taurus Mountains, has long served as a border between the Byzantine Empire and Arab Syria, beginning as early as the seventh c­ entury, and was incorporated in 1516 into Ottoman lands following Selim I’s Syria campaign.30 Armenians w ­ ere some of the first residents of Aintab, having settled t­ here in the sixteenth c­ entury. As we ­will see, at the turn of the nineteenth c­ entury, as the living conditions of Armenians improved considerably, the Muslims of Aintab developed a growing resentment t­ oward their affluent Armenian neighbors, resulting in part from the Muslims’ demoted status within the community. The Armenians experienced vari­ous positive social, po­liti­cal, sociocultural, and economic transformations in the second half of the nineteenth ­century. They undertook key intermediary roles in relation to the outside world mostly as a result of their language skills and their religious confraternity with the Eu­ro­pean powers. However, neither the Ottoman state nor the Muslim community welcomed t­ hese transformations, which led to an aggravation of ethnic divisions and brewing of local animosities. ­These under­lying sentiments created a tense atmosphere, foreshadowing the storm to come in 1895. Yet this storm would pale in comparison to the events that would begin in 1915. Agitation from the Armenian community for po­liti­cal reform and autonomy, boiling since the 1870s, was further intensified by large-­scale massacres that occurred across the empire in 1894–1897 and in Cilicia in 1909; additionally, the more seemingly benign expressions of oppression and discrimination faced by Armenians, which had increased throughout the second half of the nineteenth ­century, also contributed to growing discontent.31 Though they had already suffered grave injustices,\n\n10\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\nthe previous misfortunes of the Ottoman Armenians paled in comparison to the genocide of 1915–1916. As Bloxham notes, the massacres of the 1890s and genocide of 1915 differ in significant ways—­notably in their motivations as well as in participation by centralized versus localized actors—­but share a common time frame at the twilight of the Ottoman Empire.32 Fi­nally, the massacres of 1894–1897 themselves charted the course of what was to come, conditioning the mentality of both perpetrators and victims. This study discloses the differences and discrepancies between the assumed impact of Young Turk policies on the Armenian-­populated areas and the ­actual dynamics of the implementation of mass murder, genocide, and spoliation in t­ hese areas. Aside from the grave consequences, this analy­sis shows how Muslim elites and Aintab’s inhabitants in the community at large benefited from the implementation of genocidal policies and what I call “the economy of plunder.” Th ­ ere was, in other words, an explicit desire at the local level for the depredation of assets and property of the Armenian community, rather than solely the generally assumed ideological pressure emanating from the po­liti­cal center. My localized focus tackles the chronological complexities of the genocide, especially with re­spect to pos­si­ble antecedents in the late nineteenth c­entury and postgenocidal developments during the Turkish War of In­de­pen­dence (İstiklâl Harbi) of 1919–1922 and the early years of the Republic in the 1930s. Accompanying the massacres, the confiscation and plunder pro­cess of Aintab Armenians’ properties can be divided into three periods. In the first period—­World War I—­both the CUP itself as well as Muslim elites and ordinary Muslims pillaged Armenian wealth. In terms of the CUP policy regarding the removal of Armenians from the economy, a clear ­legal framework was required.33 ­These laws and statutes came to be known as the Emval-­i Metruke Kanunları (Abandoned Properties Laws). In the second period—­post–­World War I (1918–1921), ­a fter the Ottoman defeat—­the pro­cess of restitution commenced in the city but was ­later discontinued. In the Sykes-­Picot Agreement, concluded secretly on 19 May 1916, France and Britain carved the Arab territories of the former Ottoman Empire into spheres of influence. U ­ nder Sykes-­Picot,\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nthe Syrian coast and modern-­day Lebanon was annexed by France and Britain took direct control of central and southern Mesopotamian territories. Based on this agreement and the seventh article of the Mudros Armistice from 30 October 1918, British forces occupied Aintab in December 1918. The primary and most urgent tasks of the British occupation forces ­were to facilitate the return of the Armenians to their homes, to restore their properties and assets, and to find and deliver Armenian ­women and c­ hildren who had been held in Muslim h ­ ouse­holds to their families or relatives. Armenian survivors started to return to their hometowns in December 1918, most immediately concerned with discerning how their movable and immovable properties would be returned to them. This issue of restitution of properties was of pressing importance for the Ottoman government; related o ­ rders w ­ ere sent to localities, and necessary l­egal regulations w ­ ere issued. However, the British de­cided to cede the city to the French by signing the Syrian Agreement with the French government on 15 September 1919. According to this agreement, the French forces would replace the British in October 1919, a situation that disrupted the restoration pro­cess. Local authorities became reluctant to return the Armenian properties to the survivors, even if ordered to do so by the Ministry of Interior. Though ­houses w ­ ere occasionally returned to their rightful o ­ wners, in most cases local authorities refused to evict the pre­sent occupants. Additionally, the rise of the Kemalist nationalist movement in the city in 1919–1920 put a halt to the restitution pro­cess. In the face of French occupation, local nationalist-­Kemalist forces instigated armed strug­gles against the French. Throughout the Turkish-­ French war in Aintab, which started on 1 April 1920 and ended with the Kemalist defeat and the city’s surrender to the French military forces on 9 February 1921, the Armenians of Aintab allied with the French. Yet, despite their victory, the French ultimately de­cided to retreat from the city in February 1921, leaving it on 20 October 1921 to the Kemalist forces in accordance with the Treaty of Ankara. In the third period (post-1921), with the total departure of the Armenians from Aintab, the confiscation and plunder pro­cess was completed. With new administrative and ­legal regulations implemented u ­ nder the domestic laws following the Lausanne Treaty in 1924, and with other\n\n12\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\nbilateral agreements signed between France and Turkey in 1926 and 1932 invalidating the return of properties, all movable and immovable assets of the Armenians who ­were forced to move to Aleppo and Beirut ­were appropriated. Armenian properties ­were mainly sold by auction to Aintab’s local elites who participated in the Turkish-­French war and who supported the national forces financially and logistically. ­These auctions ­were or­ga­nized by the Defterdarlık (Internal Revenue Office) of the city and the local administration’s initiative. This book provides a concise history of ­these three periods.\n\nA ba n d o n e d A r m e n ia n P ro pe rt y Much of the lit­er­a­ture on the destruction of the Ottoman Armenians tells the story of a state captured by a radical party that enforced genocidal mea­sures throughout the land.34 Scholarship about genocidal activity at the local level, however—­what social scientists would call “the periphery”—is still in its infancy.35 Despite the paramount importance of the property issue in the execution of the Armenian genocide and its aftermath, few studies to date have addressed the issue. Lut’fik Kuyumdjian’s research, published from 1927 through 1933 in the General Almanac of So’wrp P’rgich Hiwantano’c (The Holy Savior Hospital of Istanbul),36 is one of the earliest attempts to contemplate the significance of the subject of abandoned properties, discussing the laws and regulations promulgated during the Republican period. Haygazn Ghazarian studied the confiscation of Armenian properties by establishing an empirical foundation mostly derived from the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire.37 The first comprehensive study to scrutinize Ottoman and Turkish laws and regulations in relation to Armenian abandoned properties was undertaken by Levon Vartan.38 In his pioneering work, Vartan examined the enforcement of l­egal instruments with re­spect to the abandoned properties of Ottoman Armenians. From another perspective, Kevork K. Baghdjian designated the confiscation of Armenian properties as a decisive pro­cess that was constitutive of what in due course followed it: the perpetration of the genocide in 1915.39\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nDickran Kouymjian introduced an early categorization of expropriated properties, including gold, bank assets, insurance policies, immovable wealth, and inventories.40 Kaiser’s studies on the dispossession of Armenians have contrasted “the promises of the ­legal veneer and the ­actual events” that tran­spired on the ground.41 He argued that no Ottoman law existed to keep the confiscation pro­cess within l­egal bound­ aries, nor did the Young Turk regime seem to have any interest whatsoever in safeguarding Ottoman Armenians’ property.42 A more precise analy­sis by Taner Akçam indicated an overview of the demographics of the new ­owners of confiscated assets. Relying solely on Ottoman documents, he identified six types of recipients of the Armenian properties: Muslim immigrants, the Muslim bourgeoisie, the Ottoman army, the operational costs of conducting the Armenian deportation itself, the state’s own infrastructure, and militia organ­izations.43 Bedross Der Matossian’s work provides another perspective. He argued that “whereas the CUP confiscated Armenian property, the subsequent Kemalist movement gladly accepted the crime as fait accompli and could move ­towards appropriation” without obstacles; “this distinction between confiscation and appropriation is a ­matter of active versus passive expropriation.” 44 Der Matossian discussed the fate of “Armenian capital” as an impor­tant component of the annihilation pro­cess of the Ottoman Armenians, approaching the confiscation of “Armenian capital” as a pro­cess thinly veiled ­under the guise of legality. Furthermore, he put forth questions to invite further research on the pos­si­ble connections between this capital and the material foundations of the ­later Republican era.45 In A Perfect Injustice: Genocide and Theft of Armenian Wealth, Hrayr Karagueuzian and Yair Auron aimed to fill yet another hole in the existing lit­er­a­ture, an academic void resultant from a lack of sufficient documentation of how and why the Young Turk government forcibly annexed Armenian life insurance policies. Their book provides an in­ ter­est­ing but fragmented discussion that ultimately fails to expound on how the Armenian properties w ­ ere transferred at the local level.46 Sait Çetinoğlu placed the expropriation of Armenians during the 1915 genocide in a much wider historical context and discussed the fate of Armenian properties through a linear historical understanding. He\n\n14\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\nargued that the period of 1895–1955 (including the Hamidian massacres of 1895, the Adana massacres of 1909, the genocide of 1915, and the pogroms of 6–7 September 1955) brought the complete elimination of the economic life of the Armenians.47 Nevzat Onaran’s voluminous studies on the confiscation of Armenian and Greek properties offered a narrative account of the dispossession of t­ hese two Ottoman Christian groups and examined the entire body of legislation that had been passed by the Ottoman and Republican states.48 Claiming to be the first comprehensive study devoted to the mass sequestration of Armenian property during the genocide, Üngör and Mehmet Polatel’s work detailed the emergence of Turkish economic nationalism and creation of a Turkish bourgeoisie,49 offered insight into the economic results of the genocidal pro­cess, and described how the plunder was or­ga­nized on the ground.50 This impor­tant study relies on two interconnected concepts that played a pivotal role in the nationalization of Turkish economy: confiscation and colonization. By “confiscation,” the authors mean “the involvement of an extensive bureaucratic apparatus that perpetuated a ­legal façade during the dispossession of Armenians.” As for the concept of colonization, the authors refer to the re­distribution of Armenian property to Muslims “as a form of internal colonization.”51 Additionally, the authors explored the interrelated nature of property confiscation carried in cooperation with the local elites within two provinces of the Empire, Adana and Diyarbekir.52 Anahid Astoian analyzed the factual history of Armenian expropriation throughout the Ottoman Empire in 1914–1923 based on archival documents as well as Armenian, Turkish, and other sources.53 Oya Gözel Durmaz’s dissertation constituted an exception within the existing lit­er­a­ture regarding this topic. Her study distinctively illustrated how the Abandoned Properties Laws w ­ ere implemented for Kayseri Armenians, while also bringing to light the active role of the local elites in the confiscation pro­cess of 1915–1918.54 In her recent study, on the other hand, Ellinor Morack delved into how abandoned property and the discourses and practices surrounding its distribution ­were used for the creation of a Turkish bourgeoisie and the foundation and internal legitimization of a Turkish nation-­state during the early Republican period.55\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nIn The Spirit of the Laws, Taner Akçam and I directly focused on the l­ egal framework of the abandoned properties and, in par­tic­u­lar, provided information on the Lausanne and post-­Lausanne periods.56 We also examined the confiscation of Armenian properties during the genocide and subsequent attempts to retain seized Armenian wealth. Through close analy­sis of laws and treaties, we revealed that decrees issued during the genocide constituted central pillars of the Turkish system of property rights, retaining their l­ egal validity; although Turkey has consented through international agreements to return Armenian properties, it has continued to refuse to do so. The book demonstrated that genocides did not depend on the abolition of the l­ egal system and elimination of rights; on the contrary, the perpetrators of genocide manipulated the ­legal system to facilitate their plans. While a few studies touch upon this issue, they do not primarily address the topic.57 ­These noteworthy studies share one major drawback: insufficient use of primary and secondary Armenian materials. The scholarship on the Armenian genocide in general and economics of genocide in par­tic­u­lar lacks focus on the local or micro level and the Ottoman periphery, in part as a result of the absence of Armenian sources. This book includes the confiscation, liquidation, and plunder pro­cess as an integral ele­ment of the entire destruction system within a par­tic­u­lar region, using Armenian and Turkish as well as Western sources to analyze and document with specificity the liquidation of Armenian movable and immovable properties. The book demonstrates how the Abandoned Properties and Liquidation Commissions carried out Abandoned Properties Laws and performed transactions on the wealth of deported Armenians, including the newly unearthed report and rec­ords of the Aintab Liquidation Commission that clearly reveal how “the economy of plunder” created intersecting po­liti­cal or ideological and material interests among the local collaborators. While t­ here are a number of existing books regarding the history of Aintab Armenians, almost none contains studies on property issues or describes in rich detail the social, economic, and po­liti­cal lives of the vari­ous ethnic-­religious groups living in the area, as well as the relations among them.58 My work fills this gap by dealing closely with the prob­ lems specific to the origins of property and wealth of the Aintab gentry.\n\n16\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\nThe objectives outlined ­here can hardly be met given the pre­sent state of research. ­There is no lack of regional histories of the persecution of Armenians ­under the CUP regime, but the economic expropriation of the Armenians and economic “Turkification” for the most part appear only marginally. Most local and regional studies limit themselves to a summary overview; though they contain useful strands of information, they cannot stand in for a comprehensive investigation. Even t­ oday, ­little is known about the destruction of Armenian economic and material power in centers of Armenian life in the Ottoman Empire. I see this book as both a foundation for such work at a regional level and also a stimulus for further comparative research.\n\nThe core of this study focuses on the 1915–1916 period, with chapters detailing the late nineteenth c­ entury through 1914, as well as a l­egal and an economic overview of 1920–1923 and the early Republican years. Chapter 1 explores the massacres of 1895 in Aintab, examining why and how the anti-­Armenian vio­lence took place and how two communities—­ Armenian and Muslim—­that lived in relative harmony ­until the last quarter of the nineteenth c­ entury began to clash with each other on ethnic grounds. The chapter aims to investigate the pro­cess through which ties between the two ethno-­religious communities turned hostile—­how and why this atmosphere was transformed into a series of violent and panic-­stricken events. The principal question I raise ­here is how a region that had not experienced any significant level of sustained, systemic, or intercommunity vio­lence ­until the turn of the nineteenth ­century became a region synonymous with ethnic conflict.59 Most prominently, my attention is focused on how the events revolving around the Aintab Armenian massacres unfolded. The Hamidian massacres clearly demonstrated that when specific circumstances would pre­sent themselves in the coming years, the relations between ­these two ethno-­ religious communities could rapidly gain a violent character. The southeastern Ottoman provinces of Greater Cilicia ­were—­much like the rest of the Empire—­composed of manifold ethnic groups, as was the case for the Aintab district within the Aleppo province. Christians\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nand Muslims seemed to live together harmoniously but both knew that the latter had the upper hand in an imperial-­monarchical structure. Yet, beginning in the second half of the nineteenth ­century, the Armenians of Aintab went through vari­ous social, po­liti­cal, sociocultural, and economic changes. Th ­ ese changes became evident in several areas: economy, trade, education, and religious institutions. Advancement of the Aintab Armenian population in all t­ hese areas altered the imperial hierarchical context. I analyze how this multifaceted change culminated in the disintegration of social relations and vio­lence. In Chapter 2, I first examine how the tense relations between the two communities further went amiss with July 1908’s restitution of the 1876 Kânûn-­ı Esâsî (the first Ottoman Constitution) by a new generation of leaders, the CUP. With a bloodless revolution, empire-­w ide elections, and the re­introduction of the Parliament in 1908, “the Ottoman Empire had, it seemed, transformed itself into a liberal, constitutional monarchy.” 60 Subsequently, I explain how the news of the April 1909 Adana massacres was received in Aintab. This chapter also explores the nature of the relationship between Armenians and Muslims before World War I to understand w ­ hether the ideal of Ittihad-­ı Anasır, an Ottomanist unity (Ottomanism), actually existed following the restoration of the constitution. Additionally, I address the impact of the Young Turk Revolution on the Armenians of Aintab, the sociopo­liti­cal structure of ethnic groups, the sociopo­liti­cal power dynamics between them, the po­liti­cal attitudes of both the government and the ethnic groups ­toward each other, and Muslim and Armenian perceptions of the constitutional era.61 I elucidate why a power­ful escalation of ethnic tensions as a result of ethnic politics appearing in the first year of the constitutional period erupted in a counterrevolution and why an incident similar to the Adana massacres of 1909 did not occur in Aintab, as well as identifying and analyzing the f­ actors and pro­cesses that led to restraint. Since Aintab Armenians w ­ ere no longer as defenseless and unor­ga­ nized as they had been in November 1895, they ­were not subjected to the killing and looting that erupted in Adana. Relatively speaking, ­there was a period of peaceful though tenuous coexistence in Aintab. B ­ ecause of its fragility, Armenians had fortified themselves in the Armenian neighborhoods and protected ­these neighborhoods against any mob attack.\n\n18\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\nMy findings demonstrate that the attitudes of Muslim inhabitants and administrators, as well as the firm stance of local CUP rulers, prevented the possibility of a new upheaval. “Union and pro­gress” and “liberty, justice, and brotherhood” ­were the mantras of the Young Turk revolution. Th ­ ese major pillars of the revolution w ­ ere emphasized in many postcards and placards thanks to the birth of a lively press within the empire. However, as Mustafa Aksakal remarks, the years that followed the revolution ­were also marked by “deep crises of internal vio­lence, including the massacre of 20,000 Armenians in the Adana region in 1909, wars in North Africa and the Balkans in 1911–13, and continued financial insecurity.” 62 Lastly, in the context of the Balkan Wars, the CUP attained absolute power po­liti­cally and administratively in 1913 and controlled the state apparatus over the course of the war years. I end up by tracing the policies of the Young Turks that plunged them into the war and genocidal acts. Chapter 3 describes and attempts to explain the mass vio­lence that was inflicted upon the Ottoman Armenians in the Aintab district during World War I. The chapter explores the persecution of Armenians and how that pro­cess evolved into genocide. The chapter analyzes the extant po­liti­cal and social context, which radicalized the views of local authorities, provincial elites, and ordinary Muslims regarding Armenians and paved the way for the deportations. I assess how the be­hav­ior of local elites affected the genocidal pro­cess and how they interpreted, or­ga­nized, and intensified the destruction of Armenians. The decision-­making pro­cesses and policies of the Ottoman central government and its regional as well as local representatives against Armenians ­w ill also be discussed. Additionally, it is impor­tant to investigate the path taken from the decision to deport to ­actual massacre. Deportation and extermination are not the same, though a number of similar historical situations have demonstrated that one can easily lead to the other u ­ nder ripe conditions. Hardly planned from the outset, genocidal spasms and their related events w ­ ere fostered by certain situational dynamics.63 One t­ hing gave rise to another as actors calculated their next steps in response to previous actions and decisions that had been unplanned. The momentum of events frequently led participants to find themselves in situations they\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nhad not envisioned. Thus, genocidal motives did not prefigure any a­ ctual genocidal design, intent, or target.64 No genocide is an “a priori given.” Further, h ­ uman agency in genocidal pro­cesses “depends on forces that often go beyond any sense of rational action.” 65 Hence, genocides are not inevitable events; to the contrary, as Yektan Türkyılmaz stresses, a genocidal pro­cess has its own specific spatial, temporal, and po­liti­cal dynamics, as well as potential discontinuities. It is precisely t­ hese local situational and structural dynamics and contexts that can both explain and give rise to genocides. The o ­ rders and policies of the center constitute only one side of the story of the deportation pro­cess in Aintab; equally impor­tant is the implementation of ­these o ­ rders and policies. Therefore, as Üngör and Kaiser have, in­de­pen­dently, suggested in the case of Diyarbekir, it is essential to explore how local elites established, preserved, and broadened their control over Aintab. To reveal the dynamics that ­shaped the annihilation, I illustrate the local power structures, focusing on the deeds of Ali Cenani,66 a CUP parliamentary deputy from Aintab, and Ahmed Faik (Erner),67 the mutasarrıf (district governor) of Aintab. Through this approach, I hope to capture the complexity of pro­cesses governing mass vio­lence. Chapter 4 has two sections. The first fundamentally examines the Abandoned Properties Laws. In ­doing so, I also document the expropriation pro­cess of Armenian properties that changed hands u ­ nder the veneer of legality. Properties belonging to Ottoman Armenians w ­ ere seized through vari­ous laws, decrees, and other l­ egal regulations passed by the CUP government and ­later the cadres of the Republican regime. Both governments concocted ways of making this illegal pro­cess look legitimate ­under the veil of the law. Central to this pro­cess w ­ ere the economic outcomes of vio­lence committed against Armenians. Principally, what “economic vio­lence” refers to ­here is the appropriation of movable and immovable properties and assets left b ­ ehind by the deported Armenians. The pro­cess was abetted by the ­legal system, through which an entire community was reduced to the status of nonexistence. A similar pro­cess took place in the Third Reich and vari­ous Eu­ro­pean countries invaded by Hitler’s army (the Wehrmacht). All the appropriated wealth and proceeds from the Jews ­were transferred to the trea­sury of Nazi Germany through the appropriation of law and the extension\n\n20\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\nof ­legal bound­aries. As a result, Germany was able to finance its war. ­These resources w ­ ere distributed among central and local actors that supported the regime as well as vari­ous social classes that belonged to the Aryan race.68 By the same token, ­after the CUP issued the decision for deportations, Ottoman Armenian citizens ­were prohibited from selling, renting, or transferring their properties. Thus, the state systematically managed to confiscate t­ hese assets, and highly detailed laws w ­ ere prepared regarding how t­ hese properties would be appropriated. This w ­ hole pro­cess was put into action by commissions established by the CUP government. ­These commissions w ­ ere called Abandoned Properties Commissions and Abandoned Properties Liquidation Commissions. Through the laws and regulations issued during the period of the CUP government, an intricately detailed action plan was presented regarding what was to be done with the properties left by the Armenians, but no l­egal arrangements ­were introduced regarding the values of t­ hese properties that w ­ ere supposed to be returned. The second section details how ­these regulations ­were executed specifically with the Armenians of Aintab in mind, concentrating on the appropriation of Armenian abandoned properties. I investigate what happened to ­these properties primarily by using Armenian sources and other archival materials. This chapter pre­sents a unique report of the Aintab Liquidation Commission—­previously undiscovered—­that documents the liquidation pro­cess on the ground. It is the first of its kind in demonstrating how numerous government officials and other individuals from dif­fer­ent classes (particularly Aintab Muslim elites)—­ including property assessors, auction ­houses, trustees, estate agents, notaries, and transport companies—­were employed to manage the administration and sale of Armenian assets through the Abandoned Properties Laws. Additionally, I review a number of documents from the Ottoman archives that show that laws and decrees passed in the period of 1915–1918 constituted the basic components of the extermination pro­cess. Hence, ­these laws and decrees could be regarded as the most impor­tant ­legal documents of the Republican era. Furthermore, I extensively use coded tele­grams sent by the Ministry of Interior, particularly tele­grams dis-\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\npatched to Aleppo regarding abandoned properties, as Aintab was located in the province of Aleppo.69 The relationships between the CUP, local merchants, and local officials who participated in the despoliation and distribution pro­cess of properties are illustrated. Chapter 5, also consisting of two sections, focuses on the period between 1918 and 1920. One section discusses the legislation that came into effect regarding Armenian survivors who returned and demanded the restoration of their assets following the end of the war, a­ fter the Ottoman Empire signed the Mudros Armistice on 30 October 1918. The second section specifically explores the return of Aintab Armenians and reveals the pro­cess for the restitution of their properties. In this period between 1918 and 1920, the most complicated topic was the restitution of abandoned properties to the survivors, as their properties had already been liquidated. ­After Kemalist forces came into power in Aintab in December 1921, the dispossession of Armenians who w ­ ere forced to migrate to Syria and Lebanon en masse between 1921 and 1922 continued. In Chapter 6, my main focus is to elucidate how Aintab Armenians’ properties and assets ­were used a­ fter their absolute departure. Having flourished between 1915 and 1918, the city’s newly emerging wealthy Turkish-­Muslim class consolidated its economic status by seizing t­ hese properties, with the complete departure of the Armenians in 1921–1922. This chapter provides a unique systematic analy­sis that demonstrates how properties ­were used for vari­ous purposes by the central government, local municipality, and Aintab Muslim elites, and how they w ­ ere sold at auction and distributed in accordance with the o ­ rders of Mustafa Kemal himself, founding f­ ather of modern Turkey. Additionally, I discuss how Armenian properties ­were expropriated through a series of domestic laws, rules, and regulations, and a complex legislative framework prior to the promulgation of the Lausanne Treaty on 6 August 1924 and mutual agreements signed between France and Turkey in 1926 and 1932. In order to come to an agreement with Turkey, France rescinded its claims for some combination of the return of or compensation for the properties of Armenians who had acquired Syrian or Lebanese citizenship, leaving Armenians isolated on the international stage.\n\n22\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\nThe practice of selling Armenian assets, including shops, estates, and ­ ouses in dif­fer­ent neighborhoods, at auction to Muslims at very low h prices continued through the 1930s and 1940s. The Muslims who acquired ­these immovable properties became rich, creating the base of what would become the urban bourgeoisie of Aintab in the 1960s and 1970s. ­Today, the majority of ­these Muslims still retain ­these assets at their disposal.\n\nTh e S o u rc e s P ro b­l e m The existing research on vio­lence in the Ottoman Empire suffers from an impor­tant methodological prob­lem: the lack of sources from ethnic groups subjected to vio­lence. Some works reconstruct the history of vio­lence solely through the prism of the Ottoman archives, while ­others rely only on Eu­ro­pean sources; both are deficient in terms of Armenian sources. Using sources from as many of the parties involved as pos­si­ble provides us with a better understanding of the f­actors that led to the eruption of vio­lence in the region and its culmination in the massacres.70 It is evident that ­there are neither sufficient studies that draw upon Armenian, Ottoman-­Turkish, French, British, and Turkish archival sources nor ample research within the lit­er­a­ture focusing on one par­ tic­u­lar province or district. The scope of books on the history of Aintab is rather narrow, relying entirely on a nationalist narrative grounded in the sources of the proponents of this nationalist narrative. The main prob­lem is the absence of a comparative analy­sis of existing archival documents. Within this context, it is easy to understand the difficulty in conducting studies on the seizure and plunder of Armenian wealth at the local level. To compensate for the gaps in the lit­er­a­ture, this book is based principally on archival documents and primary and secondary sources in Armenian, Ottoman-­Turkish, En­glish, French, and modern Turkish languages. ­These include correspondence and reports of state authorities, periodicals, local newspapers, and personal documents such as letters, memoirs, personal papers, and oral testimonies, scattered in archives in\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nArmenia, Turkey, Lebanon, France, ­England, and the United States. This study also uses a wealth of untapped local archival sources in Gaziantep, including the private archive of Mahmut Oğuz Göğüş. However, Armenian materials are most central to the work. Many of ­these documents, introduced to scholarly discussions for the first time, allow for an in-­depth examination of the period spanning the 1890s all the way up to the 1940s. They provide for an integrated historical narrative that takes into consideration the rapid changes seen in institutions such as the military, po­liti­cal elite, and local community, as experienced by the inhabitants of Aintab in the first quarter of the twentieth c­ entury. Accounts of the perpetrators (local elites) and of the victims are integrated with accounts from third parties to reveal in full the plunder and murder of the Armenians of Aintab. One caveat must be given: the Emval-­i Metruke Tasfiye Komisyonu Defterleri (The Principal Rec­ord Book and Rec­ord Book of Current Accounts from the rec­ords of the Liquidation Commissions), as well as the archives of Tapu ve Kadastro (Land Registry and Cadaster), are inaccessible in Turkey. Two circulars of the General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadaster w ­ ere issued in 1983 and 2000, stipulating that deported Armenians and their heirs ­were prohibited from accessing any information regarding the fate of their properties or disclosing the identities of ­those who acquired the properties. Since the Turkish state itself utilized and benefited from Armenian properties, dissemination of information and of documents concerning this issue has been regarded as a threat to the national security of Turkey. The Turkish National Security Council found the transfer of land rec­ords covering the 1915 period from the Land Registry Archives to the Prime Ministry Archives against the interests of the state and prohibited researchers from accessing ­these rec­ords starting in 2006.71 Without access to ­t hese books and rec­ords, the liquidation of the abandoned properties cannot be fully understood. Only the documents in the Land Registry and Cadaster Archives, the rec­ord books of the abandoned properties, and rec­ords of the Liquidation Commissions can provide detailed accounts of the distribution of confiscated ­houses, workshops, and movable properties, as well as auctions of property in Aintab. Nevertheless, the documentation of the liquidation of Sarkis\n\n24\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\nYacoubian’s properties detailed in Chapter 4 is an attempt to overcome this prob­lem and unveil rec­ords that belonged to the Aintab Liquidation Commission.\n\nAs Lemkin points out, genocide is a pro­cess not only of destruction but also of construction. By the time genocide perpetrators are destroying one group, they are also constructing another group or identity. Expropriation is one of the most indispensable and effective mechanisms for perpetrators to realize the pro­cess of destruction and construction. Therefore, the entire pro­cess of expropriation can be construed as both an ideological princi­ple and economic motivation. Th ­ ese two aspects cannot be separated from each other. The ideological princi­ple was hugely supported and complemented by economic motivation and material stakes. In some instances, ideology played a more significant role than economic motivation, and in other instances economic interests came into prominence vis-­à-­v is ideology. Th ­ ese two par­a meters, as impor­tant aspects of the po­liti­cal economy of the Armenian genocide, ­were implemented and constituted dynamic and effective mechanisms in the confiscation, plunder, and seizure of Armenian material wealth. The CUP deported the Armenians for vari­ous reasons, and while deporting them promised that the government would look a­ fter their properties and give them their equivalent values in the new places where they would be resettled. All the promulgated laws and regulations repeated that the Armenians ­were the true ­owners of their properties and that the state undertook their administration only in the name of the ­owners. However, the entire ­legal system was based on deception and a fiction of caring for Armenian wealth and assets. In real­ity, ­these laws and regulations ­were used to eliminate both the material and physical existence of the Armenians in Anatolia. The same practice continued in the Republican era. The Armenians’ right to the properties they left ­behind was repeated in the international treaties signed during this period. Turkey promised to give back properties to ­owners who as of 6 August 1924 ­were at their properties. Afterward, Turkey’s borders ­were fortified, and not even one Armenian was able to enter the country.\n\nIntroduction\n\n25\n\nThe Armenians not allowed back ­were declared to be fugitive and missing, and the pro­cess of confiscation of their properties continued. Furthermore, as all this occurred in the Ottoman and Republican periods, it was not and could not be said that the Armenians had no rights to their properties. Legislation held that the Armenians possessed rights to their properties—if properties could not be returned, their equivalent values ­were supposed to be paid—­but that same legislation was used si­mul­ta­neously to prevent restitution. The goal was to completely remove the Armenian presence in Anatolia. What was occurring was a l­egal operation of theft. The use of the l­ egal system was both an attempt to deny and legitimate the Armenian genocide u ­ nder the cover of legality. The law was used to provide a legitimation of what was an act of power and destruction. As in most of Asia Minor, the physical removal of Armenians to the Syrian deserts proved decisive in separating them from their property, ­because it was clear they w ­ ere not meant to return. The confiscation and sequestration of Armenian properties w ­ ere not just po­liti­cally complex but also involved an economic pro­cess. The expropriation of Armenian wealth in the Ottoman Empire clearly evinces how an essentially ideological pro­cess came to incorporate highly diverse motivations and interests, especially material ones. Th ­ ese then contributed to a progressive and deepening radicalization of the w ­ hole pro­cess.\n\n•\n\n1•\n\nThe 1895 Massacres in Aintab\n\nThe bulk of existing studies view the outbreak of mass vio­lence in the Ottoman Empire as a by-­product of the imperial collapse and subsequent invasion by Western powers that took place in the aftermath of World War I. Yet this pro­cess can be traced back to the period of the Tanzimat (Edict of Gülhane of 1839) and Islahat (Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856) reforms of the nineteenth c­ entury. The aim of the reforms was to eliminate the imperial hierarchy that institutionalized discrimination between Muslim and non-­Muslim (Christian and Jewish) communities, laying the groundwork for the equal citizenship law that would come into force following the promulgation of the Ottoman Constitution of 1876.1 The reforms ­were fiercely contested by the Muslim community, which perceived them as a direct threat to their social and economic status.2 Central actors in this response w ­ ere factions of ayans (local Muslim dignitaries wielding administrative authority), tribal leaders, and landowners on one side and Christian nationalists on the other. Muslim clergy as well as local elites, especially in eastern Anatolia and Cilicia, ­were also influential in this pro­cess. In eastern Anatolia, outside the major towns, “central government control was mostly nominal. The countryside was dominated by shifting groups of local notables, insurgents, semi-­nomadic Kurdish and Turkmen tribes.”3 Reactions w ­ ere particularly fierce in borderland and religiously mixed areas such as Kosovo, Trans-­Jordan, Albania, and the Kurdish\n\nThe 1895 Massacres in Aintab\n\n27\n\ntribal zones. Such reactions served to stall reforms in ­these borderlands, where the Tanzimat and the Islahat w ­ ere effectively dead on arrival. Yet, disenchantment with ­these reforms was not only a ­matter of bigotry. The nineteenth c­ entury was, for the Empire, a period of im­mense territorial loss and painful separatist movements. The Ottoman government, engrossed in Eu­ro­pean politics with the 1856 Treaty of Paris and seeking to preserve its integrity, attempted to gauge the shifting tides of international po­liti­cal balances yet suffered a vast loss of power. This era also saw the emergence of Greek in­de­pen­dence; French control of Tunisia; British control of Egypt and Cyprus; and the Empire’s loss of Bessarabia, Serbia, Abaza, and Mingrelia. The shrinking of territory persisted, with Crete in 1908, Libya and Tripoli in 1912, and Macedonia and Albania in 1913. ­These developments had a profound effect on Ottoman society. Military defeat produced successive waves of migration and resettlement. The mass exodus of Muslim refugees fleeing the Crimean War (and intensified by the 1877–1878 Russo-­Turkish War), the Rus­sian annexation of Kars, Ardahan, and Batumi, and the nascent Balkan nations (born of the 1878 Treaty of San Stefano) exacerbated grievances against the Armenians and other Christian populations, as ­these refugees had suffered greatly at the hands of Christian regimes. The Eu­ro­pean powers, however, quickly grew wary of the treaty, which emboldened Rus­sia in the Balkans and eastern Anatolia. Hence, the treaty was allowed to collapse shortly ­after its signing, and the Eu­ro­pean powers convened in Berlin in 1878 to produce a new agreement that would be more advantageous for the Ottomans. Macedonia and eastern Thrace reverted to Ottoman control, the nascent Bulgaria was reduced in size, and the Ottomans retained control of the Dardanelles and the Bosporus Straits, with an understanding of their unimpeded control of maritime trade.4 Nonetheless, the new agreement failed to dispel anx­i­eties within the Ottoman administration, especially regarding the status of the Armenian communities. The treaty included reforms but contained no provisions on foreign enforcement mechanisms, and Ottoman authorities feared Article 61 (explained in the following pages) could be used as grounds for Armenian secession.5 The distrust the Ottomans felt for the Christian citizens of the Empire prior to the Berlin treaty deepened into\n\n28\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\na conviction that the non-­Muslims sought to collude with foreign adversaries in order to bring about the state’s downfall. The ­Great Powers, with an eye on Rus­sia, further stoked Ottoman paranoia of a subversive Christian movement, leading to the Ottoman Empire further imperiling the Christian groups for whom the Eu­ro­pe­a ns had previously shown concern.6 Making ­matters worse for the Armenians, the Ottoman state encouraged displaced Muslim citizens to ­settle in Armenian-­populated regions, heightening security concerns for Armenian communities.7 This combination of defeat, out-­migration, and belated efforts ­toward institutional modernization via reforms exposed and exacerbated the religious polarization occurring in the Ottoman Empire. Such feelings w ­ ere intensified by the rapid social and economic changes that ­were taking place within the state and society. The nineteenth ­century was a period of steady demographic decline and diminishing social mobility for the Muslim population. In many areas, commerce, agriculture, and industry passed into the hands of an emerging Christian elite that benefited from foreign power intervention, the Empire’s gradual entrance into Eu­ro­pean economies, and a newfound sense of collective ethnic identity among the Ottoman Christians. Ethno-­religious disputes coalesced in this context. For the Armenians and other Ottoman Christians, ­these developments elevated their grievances, without the implementation of reforms; for the Ottoman statesmen, they led to a growing suspicion of the Ottoman Christians ­because of their sudden international prominence. The Ottoman Christian question thus emerged as the amalgamation of issues of territory, agriculture, demographics, and an incipient collective consciousness. The unrest caused by the Tanzimat reforms, military defeats, and weakening of the government’s control over more distant reaches of the Empire compelled a stronger state response during the reign of Abdülhamid II. In such a heightened po­liti­cal atmosphere, ethno-­religious relations deteriorated in the de­cades preceding the massacres of the 1890s. The breakdown in Muslim-­Christian relations was not l­imited to Anatolia; intercommunal vio­lence broke out in numerous provinces. In 1860, intercommunal tension between the Maronite and the Druze communities of Mount Lebanon resulted in vio­lence and massacres.\n\nThe 1895 Massacres in Aintab\n\n29\n\nSuch incidents w ­ ere no less con­spic­u­ous in the Balkans, including the April 1876 uprising in Bulgaria and the Cretan revolts of 1866–1869 and 1894. In 1894–1897, the predominantly Kurdish and Armenian eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire witnessed the massacre of the Armenian population. In 1909, shortly ­after the Constitutional Revolution of 1908, the Armenian population of Adana endured pogroms and massacres. In 1912–1913, the Balkan Wars resulted in a diminution of the Muslim population caused not only by forced migration, starvation, and disease but also by mass killings committed by Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia. With the commencement of the Armenian genocide in 1915, the ruling CUP took a drastic step t­ oward one of its long-­standing goals—­the Turkification of Anatolia. This series of state-­initiated persecutions and intercommunal vio­lence continued throughout the post-­Ottoman ­Middle East, with ruthless policies carried out by newly established nation-­states. The overall Ottoman state decline, changes in landowner­ship laws benefiting Christians (specifically, the Land Code of 1858, which transformed use rights on land into exclusionary land rights),8 the increase of a sense of “relative deprivation” among Muslims,9 muhajir-­immigration, the “second Ottoman invasion of Kurdistan” throughout the 1830s and 1840s (which constituted a state attack on the effectively sovereign Kurdish regions in eastern Anatolia),10 “modernizing” policies that disaffected Muslims, along with the legacies of the Treaty of Berlin in 1878 and the Treaty of Paris in 1856, all contributed to a sense that external powers w ­ ere working clandestinely with Christian minorities. It was the totality of ­these grievances that made pos­si­ble the coming massacres in Aintab.\n\nThe eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire became the primary site of a series of massacres of Armenians between 1894 and 1897. Th ­ ese killings centered initially in the urban centers of the six vilayets (provinces) of Sivas, Erzurum, Ma’muretü’l-­aziz, Diyarbekir, Bitlis, and Van—­where the ­great majority of Ottoman Armenians lived—­but spread ­after November 1895 not only to rural districts but to western and southern\n\n30\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\nAnatolia. Vio­lence claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands ­under the last significant sultan, Abdülhamid II. Tens of thousands converted to Islam to escape death, and tens of thousands fled to the Rus­sian ­Empire. Thousands of Armenian ­women and girls ­were abducted and forced into marriage to Muslim men. Systematic and repeated vio­lence was coupled with the plunder of residences and businesses, ruining countless families.11 The opening act took place in the Sasun district of Bitlis vilayet in summer 1894, when Muslims killed Armenians a­ fter the latter mounted armed re­sis­tance to administrative encroachments, unfair taxation, and the depredations of the local Kurdish aghas (chieftains, reportedly backed by Turkish regulars).12 The second stage, in which events discussed l­ater play a part, erupted in Istanbul and then Trabzon in September and ­October 1895. The outbreak of vio­lence motivated British and Rus­sian diplomatic pressure to improve po­liti­cal and social conditions for the Christian populations inhabiting the Empire’s eastern provinces. The Sultan’s October 17, 1895, promulgation of reforms consequent to that pressure seems to have only encouraged the vio­lence. As Selim Deringil notes, the massacres “spread like shockwaves” ­after the announcement of the Sultan’s concessions.13 Muslim resentment provided the hostile po­liti­cal atmosphere prerequisite to anti-­Armenian disturbances. Though several impor­tant studies of the eastern vilayets have appeared recently, t­ here has been ­little research into the unfolding of violent events in the region of Cilicia (southern Anatolia), though ­these took place in provinces and districts such as Adana, Osmaniye, Düzce, Kilis, Zeitun, and Aintab.14\n\nSurrounded by hills and valleys, Aintab is situated on the bound­aries of Cilicia and Syria near both the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Alexandretta. T ­ oward the south lies Düz Tepe, Mardin Tepe, and Kurban Baba. Aintab’s layout at the time of t­ hese events consisted of the citadel in the north, the downtown, and the ethnic quarters (Figure 1.1). Aintab ­rose from a valley to three hills called Hayik, Kayacık, and Kurd Tepe, with the Armenians living chiefly on Hayik (though some lived on Kayacık as well).\n\nThe 1895 Massacres in Aintab\n\n31\n\nfigure 1.1 Aintab in the early twentieth ­century. Courtesy of the Mihran Minassian Collection.\n\nA populous and prosperous Armenian community lived in Aintab and its surroundings. Rec­ords indicate that t­ here was not a significant Armenian community in Aintab ­until the onset of the fifteenth ­century, when Armenians immigrated and settled in the city from vari­ous parts of Greater Armenia, Anatolia, and Persia. The size of the Armenian population in Aintab began to increase beginning in the sixteenth c­ entury.15 For example, according to some sources, t­here ­were 236 Armenians living in Aintab in 1536.16 Of the city’s twenty-­nine neighborhoods in the sixteenth c­ entury, only one was Armenian.17 In this period, the prevailing spoken language was Turkish, though the Turkish population of the city used Armenian words and expressions in their daily lives. Armenians also spoke Turkish, and the Arabic language was used occasionally.18 Aintab was fairly developed in trade and artisanship in the sixteenth ­century and became a center of commerce, as vari­ous trade roads passed through the city. This enrichment in economic life contributed to the growth of the city’s population. Aintab was within the bound­a ries of Aleppo, which was one of the greatest provinces of the Ottoman\n\n32\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\nEmpire, ­after Istanbul and Cairo. This connection with Aleppo played a pivotal role in the commercial and cultural life of Aintab.19 The Egyptian invasion of Aintab by Ibrahim Pasha, son of Mehmet Ali (the khedive [governor] of Egypt), took place in 1830–1839. During Ibrahim Pasha’s short-­lived rule, the Armenian population of Aintab prospered materially.20 In 1839, Ibrahim Pasha defeated the Ottoman army of Hafız Pasha, but the city came ­under Ottoman rule again in 1840.21 ­After the Ottoman Empire seized Aintab, the greatest threat at hand was attacks from Arabic and Kurdish tribes, who harassed the Armenians and Turcoman tribes.22 ­These attacks became increasingly violent in the seventeenth and eigh­teenth centuries.23 In 1870–1871, the general structure of Aintab was as follows: Aintab was the biggest district of the Aleppo Province. ­There ­were thirty-­six mosques, fifty-­seven prayer rooms, twenty-­one Muslim seminaries, four dervish lodges, thirty-­six schools, five churches, thirteen baths, 1,938 shops, four covered bazaars, ten khans [large commercial buildings], thirty-­six coffee shops, nine pubs, fifty paint shops, three soap shops . . . ​t hirty-­seven bakeries, two police stations and one hospital.24\n\nAccording to estimates by Turkish historians Solmaz and Yetkin, in 1832, the population in Aintab and its surrounding villages was 15,000,25 consisting of approximately 12,000 Muslims and 3,000 Christians, mostly Armenian. While the Armenian population increased significantly starting from the second half of the nineteenth ­century, Muslim Turks maintained the majority status they had occupied since the eleventh ­century. Turkish sources show that the Muslim-­Turkish population continued to surpass that of Armenian Christians both in the nineteenth ­century and at the beginning of the twentieth c­ entury.26 An impor­tant hub inside Aleppo, Aintab was home to 10,802 Muslims, 4,933 Christians, and 274 Jews in 1868.27 By 1883 that population had doubled to 31,486, two-­thirds of whom w ­ ere Muslims and one-­third Armenians.28 According to the city’s 1895 Yearbook, the total population of Aintab had more than doubled to 84,135, of whom 15,390 w ­ ere Armenians.29\n\nThe 1895 Massacres in Aintab\n\n33\n\nAs a trade center and gateway to Syria and Palestine, Aintab attracted Armenian entrepreneurs who took a g­ reat deal of initiative in commerce. By the turn of the nineteenth ­century, Armenians had become eco­nom­ ically more power­ful than Muslims. Armenians owned caravansaries, covered bazaars, and other businesses.30 For example, the Kürkçü Hanı, an inn, was owned by the Kurkchuians, one of the most prosperous families in Aintab.31 Th ­ ese lodgings and bazaars enabled Armenians to become even more active in economic life. Among Aintab’s Muslim and Armenian communities, no specific ethnic or religious conflicts existed. Having always been close to Turkish culture and having even adapted their language to the Turkish language, Armenians also embraced many aspects of Turkish culture, such as ­music, dance, dress, and customs. In order to ­settle their ­legal prob­lems, which also included intracommunal issues, Armenians often appealed to Şer-­i mahkeme (the ecclesiastical court), the civic authority of the Muslim community. Armenians could serve as witnesses in lawsuits of Muslims, they could represent Muslim plaintiffs, and they could even challenge Muslim testimony.32 Armenians faced no challenges at the ecclesiastical court in claiming their rights regarding issues of credits and debits, commercial transactions, and properties such as shops, vineyards, and gardens.33\n\nS tat u s C ha n g e In an attempt to explain potential c­ auses for the outbreak of communal vio­lence, describing status changes between the two socie­ties is of ­great value. Residential organ­ization in seventeenth-­century Aintab was not predicated on socioeconomic segregation, and most neighborhoods retained their mixed demography ­until the nineteenth ­century.34 By that time, however, “the overall distribution of wealth in Aintab’s residential topography and the ethnic composition of the wealthy had changed significantly.”35 Beginning in the second half of the nineteenth ­century, the Empire’s Armenians underwent accelerated economic, educational, cultural, religious, and po­liti­cal change. Especially evident in\n\n34\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\neconomic life, the changes w ­ ere likewise apparent outside the Armenian community. First, economic power gradually shifted to the Armenians. Ali Nadir Ünler (1895–1986), a local notable who played an impor­tant role in Aintab’s official historiography, emphasizes that the Aintab Armenians ­were considerably ahead of the Turkish-­Muslim community in terms of economic and commercial activities. The vast majority of artisanal businesses w ­ ere in Armenian hands: soapmaking, jewelry making, copper working, tailoring, shoemaking, construction, blacksmithing, weaving, saddlemaking and more.36 Ünler describes how they protected their craftsmanship jealously and refused to train Turks. Besides most fields of artisanship, Armenians controlled nearly all of Aintab’s trade, domestic and foreign. Most doctors, dentists, pharmacists, and ­lawyers ­were A ­ rmenian.37 Muslims, on the other hand, tended to earn less money as grocers, butchers, and the like.38 Second, education factored into Armenian status change. Two institutions founded by American missionaries in 1876, the American Central Turkey College and the Girls’ Seminary, enrolled primarily Armenian students. At the onset of the twentieth ­century, ­there ­were twenty Armenian schools: eleven “national schools,” eight Evangelical schools, and one Catholic school. Prominent Armenian schools w ­ ere the Cilicia Tchemaran (College), founded in 1912;39 the Vartanian and Atenagan Schools for boys, founded in 1882 and in 1885, respectively;40 and the Hayganushian School for girls, founded in 1878.41 By contrast, Aintab’s Muslim-­Turkish community remained loyal to the traditional education model and continued to attend madrasahs (Muslim theological schools). Armenian schools helped to strengthen a national identity while encouraging cultural modernization. In Aintab, Armenians’ educational and cultural programs led some speak of Aintab as “the Athens of Cilicia and Anatolia.” 42 Thus advantaged, Armenians gained new positions. A considerable number of members of the Ottoman lower court (court of first instance), as well as both the administrative and town councils ­were Armenians;43 two of the four members of the Ticaret Odası (Chamber of Commerce) w ­ ere Armenians, and Armenians occupied posts in the\n\nThe 1895 Massacres in Aintab\n\n35\n\nZiraat Bankası (Agricultural Bank) and the Tarım Kurulu (Agricultural Assembly).44 Third, some Armenians now could entertain thoughts of conversion from Apostolic Orthodoxy to other forms of Chris­tian­ity. ­There ­were seven Armenian churches in Aintab by the early twentieth ­century: an Apostolic church,45 three Evangelical churches, an Anglican church, and a Catholic church and Franciscan monastery.46 The history of an or­ga­nized church community in Aintab dates to the seventeenth ­century, when the old church was built at the time of Michael I, Catholicos of Cilicia (1738–1758). The Armenian Church of Aintab underwent repairs on three occasions, with the major repairs made in 1807. When a fourth repair was necessary in 1873, the g­ reat plan of a new church was submitted. The Armenian ­people themselves worked diligently to construct the church. They began to build in 1873 but w ­ ere interrupted during the years 1875–1877 b ­ ecause of an epidemic and the outbreak of the Turkish-­Russian War.47 Eventually, Surp Asdvadzadzin (Saint Mary’s Church) took its final form and shape in 1893.48 ­There ­were three Armenian Protestant churches in Aintab: the Kayacık Church, built in 1848; the Hayik Church, in 1865; and the Alay Beyi Church, in 1880. The first Protestant church of Aintab Armenians was formed by the efforts of American missionaries such as Dr. Azariah Smith and Van Lennep in 1848.49 Each of the Armenian Protestant churches in the city had primary or elementary schools for both the boys and girls of their congregations. At the Kayacık Church, ­there was also a ­middle school funded by the Kurkchuian f­ amily called the Kurkchuian Varjaran.50 The ­middle school associated with the Hayik Church was built by a wealthy member, Adour Agha Niziblian. Niziblian also donated a large building known as the Niziblian Tankaran, to be used for youth activities, public cultural gatherings, and lectures.51 In addition, the Seminary School for Girls was also founded in Aintab. Benjamin Schneider began to teach a group of girls in his home in 1852, which was to become the forerunner of the Kız Koleji (Seminary for Girls),52 which was introduced in 1860. The school was originally ­housed in a group of buildings near the Kayacık Church. Owing to a significant rise in the Protestant community in Aintab, the third Protestant church was\n\n36\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\nfounded in 1880. Yet this church was not as successful as the first two churches.53 The Armenian Catholic Church was built in 1862. Armenian Catholics in Aintab constituted a small minority. While they taught Armenian in their schools, the sermons ­were preached in Turkish. According to Sarafian, this was ­because Aintab Armenians, as a result of Turkish persecution, had abandoned the Armenian language as of the eigh­teenth c­ entury.54 Improvements in welfare made Aintab Armenians more po­liti­cally aware, and Armenians throughout the Empire gained increased self-­ consciousness and a collective assertiveness. Foreign Christian missionary activities played a key role in this pro­cess.\n\nA c t i v i t i e s o f A m e ri c a n M i s s i o na ri e s American missionary efforts gained momentum in 1848 when the first Protestant church was established in Aintab. Its missionary activities ­were successful, generating a number of converts equal to that in the entire remainder of the Empire.55 The advance of Protestantism in the 1870s and 1880s became associated with Aintab’s reputation as a center of Armenian prosperity. To understand the success of Protestantism among Armenians in an Ottoman periphery, one needs to bear in mind the context of economic, societal, and po­liti­cal transformations. Thanks to the city’s proximity to Aleppo, Aintab Armenian businessmen might connect to a broader world system. The Armenian ­middle class of Aintab flourished, which seemed to some Turks to threaten the traditional millet (confessional community) system that had long regulated the lives of non-­Muslims within the Empire.56 In this context, Protestantism, which seemed to reflect American values, offered relative autonomy from traditional forms of oppression and presented a more flexible religious and ­legal structure—­features that in turn promised social mobility. Nor ­were Protestant missionary activities l­ imited to the confessional sphere. Most impor­tant, two institutions established by missionaries focused on modernization: Central Turkey College (established in 1876) and Azariah Smith Hospital, founded in 1878 ­under the college’s medical\n\nThe 1895 Massacres in Aintab\n\n37\n\ndepartment.57 The latter, notably, enjoyed the financial support of a number of wealthy Muslim families.58 Its chief was American missionary Dr. Fred Shepard (1855–1915). The college was established by Rev. Dr. Tilman C. Trowbridge (1831–1888), who became its first president, with the collaboration of Professor Alexan Bezjian (1856–1913).59 While the official language of instruction was Turkish, the study of En­glish, Armenian, and Arabic was mandatory. The college contributed to Armenian intellectual development, ethnic self-­awareness, and social advancement.60 Its high level of Anglo-­Saxon education enabled sharp growth in the po­liti­cal and national consciousness of Armenians.61 In the eyes of many Muslims, unfortunately, the college was an infamous place where Armenians honed their national objectives. The Ottoman government considered American colleges in Merzifon and Aintab “harmful” threats, labeling them “subversive places, striving to train young Armenian students to instigate disorder.” 62 According to government officials, most of the professors took part in “incidents” as activists of Armenian po­liti­cal organ­izations.63\n\nP e rc e i v e d Mu s l i m I n f e ri o ri t y a n d E n v y In Muslim eyes, a number of significant f­actors underlay the superior position of Armenians by the late nineteenth ­century. Endless unsuccessful war spelled conscription for young Muslim men, many fated never to return. Most of t­hose who did return w ­ ere e­ ither sick or disabled. Muslim peasants not drafted (like their Armenian counter­parts) bore the cost in heavy taxes. Wealthier Armenians could buy exemption by paying the bedelat-­ı askeriye, an exemption tax, and thus continue their economic activities.64 Such ­factors permitted some affluent Armenians to take over businesses and land that previously belonging to Muslims. Although the Armenian population in the villages near Aintab was small, much of the land ­there belonged to Armenians who lived in the city. At the beginning of the twentieth ­century, more than half of the commercial, industrial, and agricultural wealth of the Aintab district was owned by Armenians, who constituted less than a quarter of the\n\n38\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\npopulation.65 To be sure, Muslim imaginations exaggerated this wealth. Terekeler (probate inventories) and inheritance documents prove that Armenians became only comparatively rich. Property holdings of wealthy Armenians from 1830 to 1908 are reflected in the following: Forty-­eight out of 576 law estates in this period [1830–1908] belonged to Armenians. In 1840–1849 jewelry dealer Agob, the son of Sarı Kirkor . . . ​was the richest person out of eighty-­four ­people. . . . ​In 1850–1874 twenty-­t wo out of 277 law estates belonged to Armenians. Among the richest p ­eople, Kirkor Karabet, the son of Karamenek, was in third place with his vast amount of land and Okancian, the son of Keşişoğlu, was in fifth place. In 1880–1890 seventeen out of 180 law estates belonged to Armenians. Amongst them, Artin Agha from Nizip was the wealthiest person. Most of his wealth was composed of vineyards near Aintab and pistachio lands in the vicinity of Nizip. . . . ​Especially in the aftermath of the Second Constitutional Period, Armenians increasingly flourished by means of commercial relations, which they established with Eu­ro­pe­ans, and im­mense amount of land that they acquired in war times.66\n\nIt is pos­si­ble to see concrete manifestations of the relative prosperity of the Armenian community in comparison to the underdevelopment of its Muslim counterpart by looking at the structure of neighborhoods where the two communities widely exhibited their living practices. The missionaries observed that the orderliness, splendor, cleanliness, richness, and architectural magnificence of ­houses in Aintab’s Armenian quarters ­were much more sophisticated than ­those in Muslim neighborhoods. This striking visual difference contributed to the crystallization of economic fault lines. The missionaries noticed this difference, stating that “we are much impressed by what we see ­here, both as regards the conflict between civilization and barbarism.” 67 Skewed socioeconomic, po­liti­cal, and cultural developments, and the failure of the Muslim community to keep pace, generated a sense of disadvantage. This feeling diluted ­earlier feelings of “harmonious coexistence” between the two groups. Enlightened nineteenth-­century reform\n\nThe 1895 Massacres in Aintab\n\n39\n\nprograms also upset many Muslims, for instance ­because of their rhe­ toric of religious equality.68 Envy and resentment opened the door to a hate-­mongering atmosphere. ­Toward the end of the nineteenth ­century, this open enmity found expression in many of the Ottoman newspapers: They [the Turks] are ordered to die on Crete, they have been slaughtered on Samos, massacred in Rumelia, cut into pieces in Yemen, mowed down in Hawran, and strangled in Basra. But it’s not the Greeks, the Bulgars, the Vlachs, the Jews, the Arabs or the Armenians . . . ​who are sent t­ here, is it? Let them sit in their h ­ ouses, in their homelands, in their tents! Let them put all their energies into their work and grow rich! Let them marry and multiply! It w ­ ouldn’t be right to upset them, to trou­ble their lofty souls, to tire their delicate bodies. If it ­were other­wise, how could we have warmed them to the idea of Ottomanism? We had to please them so that they would beg and plead to remain Ottomans.69\n\nEconomic, social, and po­liti­cal asymmetries upset e­ arlier balances, enabling opportunistic actors to foster a social climate in which vio­lence seemed to be justified, as would become evident in 1894–1897. The momentum of this vio­lence first became evident in 1895 and resurfaced again in 1909, but it was not fully put into action for vari­ous reasons. Fi­nally, in 1915, it erupted. As Mark Levene persuasively demonstrates, “while the form of killing remained remarkably constant” in t­ hese three violent moments, the framework and par­tic­u­lar circumstances rooted in dif­fer­ent historical trajectories in which t­ hese massacres came into existence “markedly changed.”70\n\nTh e “A r m e n ia n Q u e s t i o n ” as a n I n t e rnat i o na l Is s u e The Hamidian massacres ­were a turning point from the nineteenth-­ century history of the “Armenian question” of the Ottoman Empire. Therefore, it ­will be useful to clarify a few points about that “question”\n\n40\n\nT H E A R M E N IA N S O F A I N TA B\n\nas an international issue before discussing how the 1895 massacres unfolded.
