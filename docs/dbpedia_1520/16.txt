I think after a few well made dramas for Zhang Ling He, namely My Journey to You and Story of Kunning Palace last year and in 2022 there was Love Between Fairy and Devil, whether as supporting or as male lead he’s been in enough hits to not be considered trying hard and not having results. I say this because there are even more Zhang Ling He dramas slated for this year 2024 and one of them is The Princess Royal (also known as The Grand Princess with the Chinese title Du Hua Nian). The female lead is Zhao Jin Mai who has only done one other period drama and is more known for her modern works. I think both look fantastic in character and he’s so tall and she’s so tiny I can’t wait for sparks to fly onscreen.
