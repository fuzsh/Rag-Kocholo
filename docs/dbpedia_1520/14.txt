Play’n GO conjures a romantic new title to add to their successful IP, Moon Princess, with Moon Princess: Power of Love, just in time for Valentine’s Day.

Fans of the Moon Princess series and grid slots alike are in for a treat with this romantic slot. In a brand-new adventure, two princes vie for the attention of Love – but who shall she give her heart to? Following the release of Moon Princess Trinity earlier in the year, this new title only sediments further the strength of Play’n GO’s IPs.

New characters have been introduced to the IP, demonstrating that it’s not only a change in gameplay that keeps players on the edge of their seats, but also a testament to Play’n GO’s innate ability to capture the experience of truly entertaining slots.

Both the Free Spins and Multiplier have been increased to x100; a feature usually seen in Play’n GO’s popular ‘100 Series’ (be still our beating heart). Players will be happy to find that the Clear the Grid Prize is still very much present in this edition of the series.

When we first met the trio of lunar princesses in 2017, it was hard to imagine that one day this series would be such a fan-favourite in the slot community. Featuring their own title in the 100 series as well as a magical Christmas edition, Moon Princess: Power of Love is sure to win the hearts of fans of the series as well as new players.

George Olekszy, Head of Game Retention said: “It’s impressive to see Love have her own adventure. This is what comes of building a strong IP that players love, it allows us, as a slot provider, to really play with our characters and take them in new directions, in turn paving the way for us to innovate features and immerse players in the experience of the slot.”

Play’n GO’s Moon Princess: Power of Love joins the Moon Princess series which is sure to become as beloved as the rest of the titles in the IP and is an impressive take on the classic Valentine’s slot.

If you’re looking to dive into Australian online casinos, choosing between Uptown Pokies Casino and ThePokies.net can be critical for your gaming experience. Uptown Pokies Casino stands out with a massive welcome bonus of up to AU$10,388 and 350 free spins, providing a powerful incentive for new players. In contrast, while ThePokies.net is popular for its design and A$10 no deposit bonus, it lacks the diverse and generous bonus options you’ll find at Uptown Pokies.

At Uptown Pokies Casino, you will enjoy a wide variety of games, from classic pokies to themed slots covering everything from pirates to Greek mythology. The site is known for its fair play and partnerships with top game providers, ensuring high-quality and varied gaming options. Meanwhile, ThePokies.net appears attractive at first glance, but deeper insights suggest it doesn’t measure up in terms of game variety and overall player satisfaction.

For those serious about a quality gaming experience, Uptown Pokies Casino offers transparency and trust, backed by a Curacao license and a high payout rate of 98%. Experience the difference yourself by visiting uptown-pokies.info.

Overview of Uptown Pokies Casino

Uptown Pokies Casino offers a rich gaming experience with a focus on quality and variety. The casino features an easy-to-use mobile platform, enticing no deposit bonuses, and numerous coupon codes and bonuses that enhance your playing experience.

Mobile Experience

Uptown Pokies Casino provides a seamless mobile experience. The mobile platform is adaptable to both iOS and Android devices, ensuring you can play anywhere, anytime.

The mobile version is just as robust as the desktop version, meaning you won’t miss out on any features. You can access your account, make deposits, and even withdraw your winnings right from your phone or tablet.

No Deposit Bonuses

At Uptown Pokies, no deposit bonuses add considerable value. New players can often find codes that give them free spins or cash without requiring an initial deposit. This allows you to test the platform and its games without financial risk. These bonuses have wagering requirements, so it’s important to read the terms carefully. Still, they provide an excellent way to start your gaming journey. You can potentially win real money without spending any of your own.

Coupon Codes and Bonuses

Uptown Pokies Casino shines when it comes to offering numerous coupon codes and bonuses. New players can receive a sizable welcome package, including match bonuses and free spins. For instance, you might find offers like a 250% match bonus up to $2,500 with additional free spins. Regular players aren’t left out either, with ongoing promotions that provide extra value. These codes are easy to find on the casino’s website, and they can be quickly applied to your account to enhance your playing experience. The terms are generally fair, making it easier to benefit from these bonuses.

In summary, Uptown Pokies Casino excels in offering a comprehensive and user-friendly experience on both mobile and desktop platforms. The no deposit bonuses and varied coupon codes provide substantial incentives for both new and regular players, solidifying Uptown Pokies as a top choice in online gaming.
