        "text": "Released in 1987, The Princess Bride is a fantasy adventure epic that's beloved by fans of all ages. It was directed and co-produced by Rob Reiner, based on William Goldman's 1973 novel of the same title (Goldman also wrote the screenplay for the film).\n\nThe Princess Bride is framed as a story-in-a-story, starting from the perspective of a grandfather (Peter Falk) reading a book to his uninterested grandson (Fred Savage). As the grandfather explains, the tale takes place in the kingdom of Florin, where a farm-dwelling young lady named Buttercup (Robin Wright) and a farmhand, Westley (Cary Elwes), have fallen in love. They seem destined for a happy life together — until Westley is attacked at sea and presumed dead.\n\nYears later, Buttercup is set to wed Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon) when she's kidnapped. What ensues is a wildly entertaining pursuit across the kingdom, involving Buttercup, her kidnappers, the prince, and a mysterious masked man.\n\nThis month, The Princess Bride turns 35. In the three-and-a-half decades since its release, the film has been named one of the top love stories by the American Film Institute. It's also been added to the Library of Congress's National Film Registry in recognition of its significant cultural impact.\n\nLooking for more movies like The Princess Bride? As you wish. Below, you'll find 10 similar recommendations, each of which includes elements of fantasy, comedy, and adventure. Like The Princess Bride, most of the titles on this list are rated PG (with a couple of PG-13 options), so they're excellent choices for a family movie night.\n\nHere, Metacritic offers 10 movies like The Princess Bride to add to your streaming queue.\n\nTime Bandits\n\nMetascore: 79\n\nBest for: Fans of imaginative adventure stories with a historical twist\n\nWhere to watch:\n\n, Google Play, , iTunes, Vudu\n\nRuntime: 116 minutes\n\nDirected, produced, and co-written by Monty Python's Terry Gilliam, Time Bandits is a fantasy adventure that takes audiences on a journey throughout history. The film follows Kevin (Craig Warnock), a young boy who joins a group of time-traveling dwarves on a mission to steal treasure from different eras. Along the way, they encounter larger-than-life figures including Napoleon Bonaparte (Ian Holm) and Robin Hood (John Cleese). Like The Princess Bride, Time Bandits is a kid-friendly flick with plenty of laughs for adults, as well as interesting visuals and witty dialogue.\n\n\"Good as the cameos are, however, the lasting draw of the film is its exceptional aesthetic.\" — Jake Cole, Slant Magazine\n\nThe Adventures of Baron Munchausen\n\nMetascore: 69\n\nBest for: Fans of magical around-the-world exploration flicks\n\nWhere to watch:\n\n, , , Vudu\n\nRuntime: 126 minutes\n\nReleased in 1989, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen is another fantasy-filled adventure film co-written and directed by Gilliam. It chronicles the kooky experiences of the titular nobleman (played by John Neville), a fictional character who's been part of German folklore since the 1700s. The Baron's travels take him across the world and outer space, from the battlefields of the Ottoman Empire to the moon to the depths of the sea. Even though the film underperformed at the box office, it made a splash during award season, winning three BAFTA Awards (from four nominations) and earning four Oscar nods.\n\n\"Gilliam never aims down, his films zing in somewhere at the Mensa level of reference, but he seems confident that we will catch the wit of his visual quotations and so we do.\" — Sheila Benson, Los Angeles Times\n\nStardust\n\nMetascore: 66\n\nBest for: Fans of fantasy novels and romantic adventure films\n\nWhere to watch:\n\n, Google Play, , iTunes, Vudu\n\nRuntime: 127 minutes\n\nBased on the Neil Gaiman novel, Matthew Vaughn's Stardust tells the story of Tristan Thorn (Charlie Cox), a young man in England who lives next to the magical land of Stormhold. After watching a falling star land in the mysterious realm, Tristan ventures into the magical kingdom to retrieve it. But when he arrives, he learns that the star was actually a beautiful woman named Yvaine (Claire Danes), who's being hunted for her special powers. Desperate to evade capture, the pair go on the run, dodging witches, pirates, and princes on their fantastical journey.\n\n\"Sprinkled with tongue-in-cheek humor, fairly adult jokes and some well-known faces acting very silly, this adventure story should have particular appeal to fans of The Princess Bride.\" — John Anderson, Variety\n\nThe Dark Crystal\n\nMetascore: 66\n\nBest for: Fans of Jim Henson and dark fantasy tales\n\nWhere to watch:\n\n, , Google Play, , , Vudu\n\nRuntime: 93 minutes\n\nIt has more fantasy elements than The Princess Bride, but The Dark Crystal is another '80s adventure flick that's fun for the whole family. Directed by Henson and Frank Oz, the movie features animatronics in place of live actors and takes place a millennium ago on a faraway planet called Thra. It's there that a Gelfling clan member named Jen (voiced by Stephen Garlick) must track down a lost shard from the magical Crystal of Truth. In 2019, a highly-rated prequel TV series (The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance) premiered on Netflix.\n\n\"A prodigious and amusing parade of things that do much more than go bump in the night.\" — David Ansen, Newsweek\n\nEver After\n\nMetascore: 66\n\nBest for: Fans of against-all-odds love stories and strong female leads\n\nWhere to watch:\n\n, Google Play, , , Vudu\n\nRuntime: 121 minutes\n\nSet during the French Renaissance, Ever After is an alternative interpretation of Cinderella's story. It features Drew Barrymore as Danielle de Barbarac, a young woman who lives under the cruel rule of her evil stepmother, the Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent (Anjelica Huston). One day, Danielle crosses paths with Prince Henry (Dougray Scott), the kingdom's most eligible bachelor. Henry, facing pressure from his father to get married, admires Danielle's rebellious spirit, and they begin to fall in love — which ignites the wrath of her wicked stepmother, who had been plotting for her daughter to marry the prince.\n\n\"The playful and well-meaning spirit of the film carries it through its shakier moments of awkward narration and inscrutably busy camerawork.\" — Marjorie Baumgarten, The Austin Chronicle\n\nHook\n\nMetascore: 52\n\nBest for: People who enjoy updated takes on beloved fairy tales\n\nWhere to watch:\n\n, Google Play, , , Vudu\n\nRuntime: 142 minutes\n\nRobin Williams and Dustin Hoffman star in 1991's Hook, a family-friendly adventure movie directed by Steven Spielberg. In it, Williams plays an adult version of Peter Pan, who's grown up to become a busy corporate lawyer without much time for his family. However, his priorities quickly change when his children are kidnapped by Captain Hook (Hoffman) — forcing Peter to head back to Neverland to rescue them. Despite earning mixed reviews from critics, Hook performed more favorably with audiences and eventually became a cult classic. It also netted five Academy Award nominations, including Best Visual Effects.\n\n\"Like the massive shipboard set that is its centerpiece, the film is huge and impressive — though, again like the captain's imposing vessel, it stubbornly and disappointingly remains at anchor.\" — Dave Kehr, Chicago Tribune\n\nLabyrinth\n\nMetascore: 50\n\nBest for: Fans of David Bowie and surreal coming-of-age films\n\nWhere to watch:\n\n, Google Play, , Vudu\n\nRuntime: 101 minutes\n\nLabyrinth, directed by Henson and executive produced by George Lucas, takes audiences on a mystical journey that blends music, fantasy, and adventure. It stars Jennifer Connelly as 16-year-old Sarah Williams, who, in a moment of frustration, wishes for her younger brother to be taken by the goblins from her favorite book. When her wish comes true, Sarah meets Jareth the Goblin King (Bowie), who informs her that she must solve his labyrinth to get her brother back. Although some critics were underwhelmed by Labyrinth, the film has developed a cult following in the years since its release.\n\n\"Great energy and creativity went into the construction, production and direction of this movie, but it doesn't have a story that does justice to the production.\" — Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times\n\nInkheart\n\nMetascore: 49\n\nBest for: Fans of young adult literature\n\nWhere to watch:\n\n, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu\n\nRuntime: 106 minutes\n\nLike The Princess Bride, Inkheart is an all-ages movie that's full of storybook-based adventure. The film, which is adapted from Cornelia Funke's 2003 novel, revolves around father-and-daughter duo Mo (Brendan Fraser) and Meggie Folchart (Eliza Bennett). One day, after a strange encounter outside of a bookstore, Mo explains that he has the ability to bring characters out of books and into the real world. Unfortunately, one of the characters brought to life is Capricorn (Andy Serkis), a villain who's intent on destroying the world — unless Mo and Meggie can stop him.\n\n\"This is a stunning-looking film with a dark romantic cloud (quite literally) hanging over its every shot.\" – Kamal Al-Solaylee, The Globe and Mail\n\nThe NeverEnding Story\n\nMetascore: 46\n\nBest for: Fans of pure '80s nostalgia\n\nWhere to watch:\n\n, , , iTunes, Vudu\n\nRuntime: 102 minutes\n\nIf you're looking for another '80s classic that celebrates storytelling, then The NeverEnding Story is a great choice, though critics didn't like it upon its initial release. Directed and co-written by Wolfgang Petersen, it centers around Bastian Bux (Barret Oliver), a shy bookworm who begins reading a mysterious book that transports him into a magical land called Fantasia. It's there that Bastian learns about Atreyu (Noah Hathaway), a boy who's been tasked with stopping the Nothing, an evil force on the verge of destroying Fantasia. The NeverEnding Story is based on a book by Michael Ende and is the first of three movies in the series that became more beloved over time as viewers looked back on their childhoods and often realized this was an important story within them.\n\n\"It brings back the early excitement of reading as a child, when the act of turning pages took on a magical quality.\" — Julie Salamon, The Wall Street Journal\n\nRobin Hood: Men in Tights\n\nMetascore: 44\n\nBest for: Fans of silly, spoof-style comedies\n\nWhere to watch:\n\n, , , , Vudu\n\nRuntime: 104 minutes\n\nElwes plays the namesake character in Mel Brooks' Robin Hood: Men in Tights, a parody of the timeless fable. The film follows Robin Hood as he escapes a Jerusalem prison and returns to England — only to find that his family's land has been taken over by the malevolent Prince John (Richard Lewis). Needing help, Robin Hood recruits a group of men to help him regain his land. It's goofier, less kid-friendly, and less critically-lauded than The Princess Bride, but Robin Hood: Men in Tights could be a good watch for fans of Elwes, Brooks, or people who enjoy parodies.\n\n\"A decent-enough inroad to one of film history's most respected parodists.\" — Genevieve Koski, The Dissolve"
