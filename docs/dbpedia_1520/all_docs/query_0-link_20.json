Vol. 1 ~story by Yuji Yuji, art by Nami Hidaka and translation by Stephanie Liu Princess Alphina has been reliving her life up until her execution. But on the 100th time, she started suddenly hearing all the inner voices of the people and they all love her! Disclaimer: A review copy was provided by the publisher The blurb is clearly a reverse harem but my mind keeps lingering back on the line: she discovers that she can hear people’s true feelings—and that everyone secretly loves her. What if it's just like the generic love of everyone surrounding her? As the reality sinks in that it's another miss, things started to turn around more than halfway through. Yes, reverse harem takes a win for the day and no, we're not going to do a rundown of the guys. Now, enjoy the beautiful characters' illustration above and take a guess. I love her reaction when she hears their love litan\n\nHere are the reverse harem anime for 2024 and TBA. Some may not be full-blown reverse harem, while others are not confirmed. Please subscribe!\n\nKiskis! My Boyfriend are Mint Candies!- 4 episodes Tang Tang meet guys who each represent a flavor of mint candies. It has a catchy, cute opening. At first there's a different feel on it which I can't pinpoint. And then I realized that they are talking in Chinese! This is my first completed Chinese animation. Well since it was way too easy to finish it. It's 5-minute ONA for 4 episodes. I think this premiered last June 4. But the first Chinese animation I watched is still currently airing (unconfirmed reverse harem), Phantom in the Twilight, which is a collaboration between Japan and China. Oh back to back Chinese reviews after The Flame's Daughter. Is China going to be booming with reverse harem now?\n\n❤️‍🩹💄本編PR解禁💄❤️‍🩹 ある日彼氏が＜超モラハラ彼氏＞に!? メイク男子との運命の出会いで 人生を変える【人生逆転】ストーリー✨ #顔に泥を塗る 7/13(土)よる11:30 𝑆𝑇𝐴𝑅𝑇 #髙橋ひかる #木村慧人 #FANTASTICS #西垣匠 #高野洸 ♡𝑇𝑉𝑒𝑟お気に入り登録 https://t.co/YjcOKFfdFm #顔泥 pic.twitter.com/cmsrZLhQpB — 土曜ナイトドラマ『顔に泥を塗る』毎週土曜よる11:30放送【公式】 (@kaodoro_ex) June 30, 2024 Kao ni Doro wo Nuru jdrama premiered last July 13. Source: Dorama World . This is based on manga, Makeup with Mud, which is also being serialized on Mangaplaza since 2022. (Not a confirmed reverse harem since third guy's intention is unknown but the cover and promo are all looking reverse harem) manga summary: You're great just the way you are. Even though Miku is 25 years old, she hasn't learned a thing about how to do her own makeup -- but her boyfriend, Haru, tells her that he prefers her that way. Miku and Haru live together, after all, and they might get married, in which case she'll just quit her job anyway, so it's probably fine never to learn...

But on the 7th time loop, her enemy has taken an interest in her. This is a mix of my first impression here on the blog, mini-impressions, and mini-review from Patreon. And with some new insights. 7th Time Loop is entertaining and exciting. It makes you think of the possibilities and the interconnections. Her past six lives were summarized without being long-winded but just enough to pique our curiosity. The critical timing of each action or decision will lead to different outcomes or probable \"romance routes\". Or so I thought. No reverse harem romance but there's a bishonen for each life. Think Amnesia. And this is by far, the fastest turn of events from a \"love at first sight\". I've been avoiding saying this is my\n\nFutei de Furachi na Ani desu ga (My Handsome Brothers) by Yuki Shiraishi 5 chapters (complete) Ayumu feels like a goose with her clingy and school's popular Shiratora brothers. Only 1 chapter is available so far. I wonder if the scanlators meant duckling. Anyway, the animal reference is not something new since it's from the same mangaka who wrote other two reverse harems: Ookamidomo no Shitsukekata (wolves) and Bokura no Himitsu wo Kyouyuu shiyou ka (animal love story) . I don't remember really liking her art before but I sure do now.\n\nAlice in Bishounen-Land Volume 2 by Yushi Kawata Art by Yukito With the help of a new member or two, Alice and the newly-rebranded idol group Triple S progresses in the battles. Disclaimer A review copy was provided by the publisher. Check out the first volume review . The first volume is so weird but trust me it gets weirder. But once you got used to the humor, everything seems funnier this time around. The randomness of the backstories, the non-stop comical situations, and cheesy jokes. I'm loving them all now including the minor characters. The one thing that balances it all out is Alice. She's the shining beacon of reason and her spot-on observations make it more laughable. For something crazy, it briefly touches 'beauty is indeed in the eye of the beholder'. And it's not in your face at all. It is refreshing and satisfying to get some key takeaways from both volumes when you're least expecting one. The isekai element of the story is set inside an otome\n\nHello wallflowers! The season's lineup is a bit late as we do not have news of summer anime and dramas yet. For now we have kinda reverse harem, Dahlia in Bloom. I'm really hesitant in adding it in the lineup but as we don't have one yet might as well put this up. But I did see rumors of Lost You Forever Season 2 for July airing and Take Me Where the Clouds Rise (SaiMono) for Q3. I do hope it becomes true! However, I'm seeing comments that the latter drama did not get the license for adaptation huhu The Forbidden Garden edition has also been updated. Make sure to follow any of Reverse Harem Garden's socials ( Youtube | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tiktok ) to be updated on the latest titles! And a few disclaimers: Some are not full-blown reverse harem. See Levels of Reverse Harem . Those that are not yet reviewed are considered unconfirmed reverse harem.

However, the guys seem to have bugs and are either raising or missing events on their own. Disclaimer A review copy was provided by Netgalley. Check out the first volume review . In the first volume, Mystia meets two of Kyun Kyun Love's suitors, Raid and Eric. In this sequel, we get to see how she meets Jesse, the teacher. For the fourth guy, Robert, it is more of pleasantries. The nicknames in the first volume are still not crystal clear to me. The sparkling prince. The cool tsundere. The gaudy guy. The yakuza teacher. I managed to get the first two mixed up while the other two have yet to unfold their said attributes. The competitiveness between E"
