The film stars Vanessa Hudgens, Sam Palladio, and Nick Sagar.\n\nThe film's concept of two people who look identical running into one another and switching places comes from Mark Twain's 1881 novel The Prince and the Pauper.\n\nIt was released on November 16, 2018, by Netflix. The film is the first installment in The Princess Switch trilogy. It was followed by a sequel, The Princess Switch: Switched Again, which premiered on November 19, 2020, and The Princess Switch 3: Romancing the Star, which premiered on November 18, 2021.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nA week before Christmas, Stacy’s assistant Kevin tells her that he has secretly entered her in a prestigious baking competition in the Kingdom of Belgravia. Initially reluctant, she agrees to go to Belgravia with Kevin and his daughter Olivia after a brief encounter with her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend.\n\nAt the competition, she runs into her rival Brianna, who stains her apron. In a dressing room, Stacy runs into Lady Margaret Delacourt, Duchess of Montenaro and fiancée of Crown Prince Edward of Belgravia, and they realize they look exactly like each other.\n\nDesperate for time out of the spotlight and to try an ordinary life, Margaret suggests to Stacy that they switch places for two days, then switch back before the competition and her and Edward's wedding. Initially reluctant, Stacy eventually accepts, especially after Lady Margaret agrees to sponsor Olivia as a student in Belgravia's acclaimed summer ballet program.\n\nStacy and Margaret quickly teach each other about their lives and behavior to minimize suspicion, and part ways. Olivia quickly discovers the switch but helps keep the secret while bonding with Margaret. Meanwhile, Prince Edward – who was supposed to be away on business for the two days of the switch – changes his plans to spend time with his fiancée.\n\nKing George senses something is afoot, tasking his butler Frank to watch her. Stacy adapts to court life and begins falling in love with Prince Edward, while Margaret falls in love with Kevin and realizes that she loves living a normal life. Despite this, they switch back as planned. Meanwhile, Brianna sneaks into the TV station one night and sabotages Stacy's mixer.\n\nFrank photographs Margaret and Stacy together, and shows that they swapped identities to the Queen. The Queen then fakes illness to send Edward and Margaret to attend the competition in her place. There, due to Brianna's vandalism, Stacy is forced to mix her ingredients by hand.\n\nDespite the setback, Stacy and Kevin win first prize, with medals presented by Lady Margaret and Prince Edward, where their switch is discovered. Margaret professes her love for Kevin, while Stacy walks away, feeling out of place in Edward's royal life. Edward stops her and proposes, suggesting a Christmas wedding in a year if they are still in love.\n\nOne year later, Stacy marries Prince Edward and becomes Princess of Belgravia, and Margaret catches the bouquet.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nVanessa Hudgens as\n\nStacy De Novo, a baker from Chicago\n\nLady Margaret Delacourt, Duchess of Montenaro\n\nSam Palladio as Edward Wyndham, Prince of Belgravia\n\nNick Sagar as Kevin Richards, Stacy's best friend and Olivia's father\n\nAlexa Adeosun as Olivia Richards, Kevin's daughter and Stacy’s goddaughter\n\nMark Fleischmann as Frank De Luca, Prince Edward's driver\n\nSuanne Braun as Mrs. Donatelli, Duchess Margret's personal assistant\n\nSara Stewart as Queen Caroline Wyndham, Prince Edward's mother and Queen of Belgravia\n\nPavel Douglas as King George Wyndham, Prince Edward's father and King of Belgravia\n\nAmy Griffiths as Brianna Michaels, Stacy's baking rival\n\nRobin Soans as Kindly Old Man\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2018, it was reported that Vanessa Hudgens and Sam Palladio would star in the Netflix film The Princess Switch.[1][2]\n\nPrincipal photography ended in June 2018.[1] The majority of the film was shot in Carei, Romania.
