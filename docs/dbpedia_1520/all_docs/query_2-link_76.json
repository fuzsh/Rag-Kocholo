        "text": "Hello you FOOLS. Just Kidding I love you. New Devlog is dropping MUCH faster than the last huh? And I've got CRAZY amount of progress to show off so let's cut to the chase!\n\nCatatattack's Brand New Logo!!!\n\nWhat's Up?:\n\nIf you've been keeping up with these devlogs then you'd know I've been whining ON AND ON about not knowing how to draw backgrounds. Well Months of practice later and I've made enough progress to confidently get on with the game! I studied Perspective, @MindChamber and Alien Hominid Invasion's Background Art extensively and eventually pulled off a style I like! Consider this hurdle JUMPED! WOOOOOOO!!!\n\nBackground Art for Area 2 of the Junkyard!\n\nWith such a major shortcoming overcome, I've finished about HALF OF THE JUNKYARD!\n\nOn top of ALL this, I've fixed some critical problems that were getting under my skin. Kitt (The Helper Cat that follows you around) is way more proactive during combat locks instead of standing around and waiting for an enemy to lock onto her! The Dialogue System has also been updated and optimized! It notably dropped the FPS from 2000 to 68, which is uh... bad? Basically, a LOT of \"For Loops\" were being run every frame instead of just once! The spirit of Yandere Dev took me over for a bit. Don't worry, I took a shower so I'm good now.\n\nUpdated Dialogue System in Action!\n\nAll this plus general optimizations means that not only is the first level going to be finished faster than I expected, but it'll be way BETTER than I expected! Of course there are also some limitations...\n\nWhat's Wrong?!:\n\nI've been testing the HTML5 Build specifically for the eventual Newgrounds upload of the game but as you'd expect there've been some issues... First off, obviously the desktop is already going to be FAR more optimized since GameMaker is made for it. When it comes to HTML5, GameMaker converts the code the best it can but there's limits of course. The FPS drops quite a bit AND certain problems slip through the cracks on the engine's end that I can't really solve. I'll try to optimize it as much as I can but I'll say that it'll probably be a bit underpowered on the NG release.\n\nBackground Art for Area 1 of the Junkyard!\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe game is making steady and constant progress and as I get core systems done, later work will be such a breeze! I can't wait to see my winning vision in action! Up next I'll be starting the first Mini-Boss of the game: Prissy and Princess!\n\nI plan to make a demo publicly available once The Junkyard and Mafia Hideout: Floor 1 are complete! Perhaps a Kickstarter to ensure I can bring on talented people to help out with the game! First of course, I need to build an audience so be sure to follow the Catatattack Twitter for more consistent updates!\n\nSee you all next time! Hopefully with a near finished Junkyard!\n\nCatatattack Poster!"
