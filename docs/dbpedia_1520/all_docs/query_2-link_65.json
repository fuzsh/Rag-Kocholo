        "text": "Princess of Wales, or Tywysoges Cymru in Welsh, is a courtesy titled that has been used for centuries. Typically held by the wife of the heir apparent to the English (later British) throne, the title currently belongs to Kate Middleton, the wife of Prince William.\n\nBefore the spouse of the heir to the British throne held the title, there were native Welsh princesses—but there's only one wife of a Welsh prince who definitively used the title \"Princess of Wales\": Eleanor de Montfort, the wife of Llywelyn ap Gruffydd (also known as Llywelyn the Last). Llywelyn ap Gruffydd was one of the last princes of Wales before its conquest by Edward I of England. For clarity, this list will only define those who use the title who were married to the British heir to the throne.\n\nThere's a movement to get rid of the Prince and Princess of Wales titles; actor Michael Sheen said in 2020 that Charles should forfeit the title when he inherits the throne. If he gave up the title, Sheen said, it would be a \"really meaningful and powerful gesture for that title to no longer be held in the same way as it has before, that would be an incredibly meaningful thing I think to happen.\" Sheen added, \"Make a break there, put some wrongs of the past right, don't necessarily just because of habit and without thinking carry on that tradition that was started as an humiliation to our country.\" However, that didn't happen; one of the first things Charles did was bestow the title on his son, Prince William. (More on that appointment, here.)\n\nAs the Prince of Wales title has historically been given to the eldest living son and heir apparent of the current British monarch, a Princess of Wales title has not historically been given on its own. (I.e. Queen Elizabeth was not Princess of Wales, because she was not the heir apparent.) Yet, with the 2013 change to the rules of succession, there now can be a female heir apparent—but only time will tell if there will ever be a solo Princess of Wales.\n\nWithout further ado, here's a definitive list of all the Princesses of Wales throughout history."
