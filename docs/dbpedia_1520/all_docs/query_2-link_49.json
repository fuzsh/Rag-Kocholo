        "text": "Synopsis\n\nLiu Ling (Crystal Yuan) is a young member of the royal family who has been granted the auspicious title of Princess Chang Le by the Emperor – who has a soft spot for her (and thinks little of her father). She is aged 20, and until now she has lived a pampered and privileged life. She is capricious, impatient, and quite bratty. Even when people lavish gifts upon her, she treats them with disdain. She has a habit of rubbing people up the wrong way and acting impulsively – a fact that has seen her develop many enemies at court. Even the common folk have a habit of spreading malicious – and often totally unfounded – rumors about her. On her birthday, she decides – on a whim – to travel out of the palace to drink in a private room at an exclusive inn. She drinks herself into a stupor and is sleeping off the alcohol when Shen Yan (Zheng Ye Cheng), a young army commander and an ice-cold martial artist stumbles into her room after having been injured in a sword fight with a notorious bandit. The Princess falls for this wounded warrior and tries to win his heart – although he initially doesn’t seem very impressed with her advances. But, given time, could this unlikely duo strike up a friendship – or an even more unlikely romance? This drama was based on a web-based novel that was authored by Yi Ren Kui Kui. “My Sassy Princess” is a 2022 Chinese drama series that was directed by Zhu Shao Jie."
