        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAs a flower girl, Su Xiao Wan (Yang Zhi Wen) never really imagined her simple life would ever be anything other than ordinary. But when an accidental mixup lands her in a sibling contract with Gu Yan Xi (Ye Sheng Jia), the young master of the well-known Gu family, her simple life is flipped upside down. Now obligated to play the part of Gu Yan Xi’s younger sister, Xiao Wan finds herself tangled in the affairs of one of the most prominent business families in the land. Constantly hounded by Yang Xi’s sharp tongue and ceaseless schemes, Xiao Wan is forced to rely on her quick wit and sly tricks, in order to survive. Never allowed a moment’s peace, Xiao Wan can only find respite while in the company of Gu Zi Qian (Zhao Tian Yu), the family’s second master. A warm and caring young man, Zi Qian takes it upon himself to look after Xiao Wan, shielding her, whenever possible, from the constant pestering of his older brother. Unfortunately for Xiao Wan, Zi Qian’s kindness is fueled by his own secret ambitions. Soon trapped in a complicated relationship with both Yang Xi and Zi Qian, Xiao Wan struggles to find a way out. As her head tells her to go one way, her heart tells her to go another; leaving Xiao Wan to wonder, which brother will ultimately help her find the happiness she desires? A light-hearted tale of friendship and love, “A Love So Romantic” is a 2020 romantic comedy directed by Dai Lu."
