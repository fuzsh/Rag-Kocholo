Staff\n\nEpisode Count: 25\n\nGenres: Comedy, Romance, School, Slice of Life\n\nDescription: “It hurts being misunderstood by your peers. Ryuuji Takasu is a victim of the oh-so familiar high school rumor mill. His slanted eyes and brute appearance have led his classmates to fear for the worst, labeling him a delinquent and avoiding unnecessary contact with him. The truth of the matter is that Ryuuji is actually a really nice guy who enjoys the simple things in life – cooking, cleaning and playing with his parakeet. If you omit his bad reputation, Ryuuji has a pretty peaceful life. That is until he accidentally looks into the eyes of the tiger…\n\nUnlike Ryuuji, Taiga Aisaka, known as “Palmtop Tiger” by her classmates, deserves her bad reputation. Despite her petite size and cute, doll-like appearance, Taiga is actually quite a handful; she has a horrible temper and an even worse attitude. After a traumatic “uh-oh” mistake (on Taiga’s part), she meets Ryuuji. Although the two have trouble getting along at first, they eventually decide to make the best of their situations and form a pact to help each other get closer to their crushes. Will puppy love bloom for the Tiger x Dragon duo? Or will they destroy each other in the process?\n\nToradora! is a slice of life anime that explores the awkward, yet adorable, moments of high school that everyone of us has faced at one point or another. The storyline is sure to tug at your heartstrings and poke at your funny bone, all at the same time.”\n\nAnime Title: True Tears\n\nProduction Studio: P.A.
