        "text": "When you’re trying to decide on your wedding first dance song you’re probably going to want a song that has meaningful, romantic lyrics, lyrics that mean something to you. This is where Walt Disney come in. Since their creation back in 1923, Disney has released some of the most romantic songs and ballads ever recorded through their movies, enduring songs that have stood the test of time and continue to inspire generation after generation. What better way to add a touch of magic and elegance to your wedding day than by choosing a romantic Disney song for your first dance?\n\nIf deciding upon a first dance song is proving difficult, we’ve compiled a list of the most romantic Disney first dance songs to inspire you. From Disney classics such as Cinderella and Snow White to exciting newcomers such as Tangled and Frozen, these 35 Disney love songs feature meaningful lyrics and beautiful melodies. We have even thrown in a few unique first dance songs, coming from movies such as Bambi and Up. With charming upbeat Disney songs, slower piano ballads and all-time favourites from classic movies, this is the ultimate list of romantic Disney first dance songs.\n\n1. You’ve Got A Friend In Me – Toy Story\n\nWe are kicking our list of Disney first dance songs off with a Toy Story classic. ‘You’ve Got A Friend In Me’ is the theme song for the first Toy Story movie. Due to its popularity, it became a key part of the second and third movie as well. It’s easy to see why this song is a popular choice for a first dance, with lyrics such as “you’ve got a friend in me, you got troubles, I’ve got ’em too, there isn’t anything I wouldn’t do for you, we stick together and see it through.”\n\n2. Love Is An Open Door – Frozen\n\nA relatively new Disney movie, Frozen took the world by storm upon its release in 2013. This romantic Disney duet is sung by Princess Anna and yet to be disclosed villain, Prince Hans. Its catchy, upbeat lyrics and tempo would make for a unique and fun first dance as husband and wife. ‘Love Is An Open Door’ even had it’s own internet craze, with people around the world recording themselves singing the duet dramatically on car journeys!\n\n3. So This Is Love – Cinderella\n\nCinderella is a Disney classic loved by the many, and ‘So This Is Love’ is a perfect first dance song. The song is sung by Cinderella and Prince Charming as they dance at the ball. Radiating romance and elegance, this is the perfect song to show off your dress with a twirl on the dance floor.\n\n4. Define Dancing – Wall-E\n\nThis next song comes from the score of the 2008 movie Wall.E. ‘Define Dancing’ is a beautifully animated dance scene between Wall-E and EVE as they glide through space to the sound of harps, gentle bass and graceful percussion. This song is a stunning choice for your first dance, bringing something a little different to your wedding day.\n\n5. Can You Feel The Love Tonight – The Lion King\n\nComposed by Elton John, ‘Can You Feel The Love Tonight’ is another hugely popular Disney love song. The song won the 1994 Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, as well as winning Elton John a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. This song is guaranteed to add some Disney magic to your big day.\n\n6. Kiss The Girl – The Little Mermaid\n\nWhen you’re thinking of first dance songs, The Little Mermaid might not be one of the first ideas to come to mind. ‘Kiss The Girl’ however is a romantic Disney song that definitely deserves to be on this list. This ballad is about encouraging a man to kiss the girl he loves before he loses the opportunity forever, which we think is very fitting for a wedding!\n\n7. If I Never Knew You – Pocahontas\n\n‘If I Never Knew You’ is from the 1995 movie Pocahontas. This song wasn’t included in the actual movie upon its original release but was added in for the 2005 re-release of the film. A unique first dance choice, this passionate song will be a perfect addition to your wedding day.\n\n8. Love Is A Song – Bambi\n\nReleased back in 1942, Bambi is a movie about a young deer growing up in the forest. The song ‘Love Is A Song’ features in the opening credits for the film with beautifully illustrated backgrounds. It features emotive lyrics such as “love is a song that never ends, one simple theme repeating, like the voice of a heavenly choir, love’s sweet music flows on.” This Disney song is a great choice if you want a first dance with a slower tempo compared to some of the other songs on this list.\n\n9. I’m Wishing/One Song – Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n\nAnother Disney classic, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs features several romantic songs in its soundtrack. ‘I’m Wishing’ is the first song in the movie, sung by Snow White as she cleans the castle courtyard owned by the queen. Once she finishes the first part of the song, the Prince appears over the castle wall and joins her, singing the second part of the song, ‘One Song’.\n\n10. Start Of Something New – High School Musical\n\nIf beginning your married life isn’t the start of something new then we don’t know what is! This cute, upbeat song is ideal as a first dance if you want everyone to dance with you, as it’s so infectious they won’t be able to resist. It also features Zac Efron, which can never be a bad thing right?\n\n11. Beauty And The Beast – Beauty And The Beast\n\nA favourite here at Entertainment Nation, Beauty and the Beast is one of the most romantic Disney movies. ‘Beauty And The Beast,’ also known as ‘Tale As Old As Time’ is a stirring song about the couple learning to accept each other’s differences. Having a song about timeless true love makes this a perfect first dance song, and is guaranteed to make you feel like a princess on your big day.\n\n12. Best Of Friends – The Fox And The Hound\n\n‘Best Of Friends’ featured in the 1981 movie The Fox And The Hound. With the lyrics being about best friends and the beauty and magic that comes with friendship, this lesser-known Disney song is fitting for a wedding.\n\n13. I Won’t Say (I’m In Love) – Hercules\n\nThis romantic Disney song is an R&B ballad with elements of Motown and pop music throughout. ‘I Won’t Say (I’m In Love)’ is from the movie Hercules, and is about Meg reluctantly accepting she is in love with Hercules.\n\n14. Once Upon A Dream – Sleeping Beauty\n\nBased on the Garland Waltz from the Sleeping Beauty ballet by Tchaikovsky, ‘Once Upon A Dream’ is from one of the most famous and romantic Disney movies of all time. This song is the love theme of Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip in the 1959 film Sleeping Beauty. If you’re aiming for an enchanting fairytale wedding, this Disney waltz is a must for your first dance.\n\n15. Dos Oruguitas – Encanto\n\nThis adorable latin song is available with both Spanish and English lyrics and the title translates literally as ‘Two Caterpillars’. It’s a gorgeous Disney love song about two lovers cocooned together, waiting to see what wonders life will bring when they emerge. So cute! This song would sound amazing on a hot summer’s night thanks to the Spanish guitar and lilting rhythms.\n\n16. I See The Light – Tangled\n\nIf you’re looking for a romantic Disney duet for your first dance, ‘I See The Light’ is a great choice. This dreamy song comes from Disney’s 50th animated feature film, Tangled. A modern twist on the tale of Rapunzel, this slow Disney song is about a blossoming romance between Rapunzel and Flynn. The scene oozes with passion, featuring a romantic boat trip surrounded by beautiful flowers and glowing lanterns in every direction.\n\n17. A Whole New World – Aladdin\n\n‘A Whole New World’ is a popular wedding first dance song and it’s easy to see why. This romantic duet between Aladdin and Jasmine comes from the Disney favourite, Aladdin. It is the key song from the film, showing the couple flying on a magic carpet as they acknowledge their love for each other and the boundless future they share.\n\n18. La Vie En Rose – WALL-E\n\nClumsy and lovable robot, WALL-E (literally) hit our screens back in 2008. When WALL-E first sets eyes on EVE, he immediately falls in love and continues to show his affections for her throughout the film by protecting her from harm. This romantic song, covered by jazz legend Louis Armstrong, begins with a beautiful instrumental trumpet intro followed by Armstrong’s unmistakable vocals. A classy and sophisticated option for you Disney-loving brides and grooms-to-be.\n\n19. Some Day My Prince Will Come – Snow White\n\nDating back to 1937, Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs was Disney’s first Princess film, and it’s quite the fairytale. It’s love at first sight for Snow White and the Prince – it is Disney after all! ‘Some Day My Prince Will Come’ is an enchanting ballad sung by Snow White as she looks back and tells the seven dwarfs about her love encounter with the Prince. If you’re dreaming of the perfect fairytale for your first dance, this song will be sure to melt your heart as well as your guests’.\n\n20. Married Life – Up\n\nNow, we know what you’re all thinking, “this is a sad song” (spoiler alert), but ‘Married Life’ has a charming message to it. Carl and Ellie’s marriage is full of happiness and wonderful memories. You’re getting to share the rest of your life with your new husband or wife, and that’s a beautiful thing that should be celebrated. We would however recommend an edited version of this emotional Disney instrumental song – snipping out the sad bits! We love this wonderful piece of music – everyone will recognise the song as soon as that violin kicks in (we cross our heart).\n\n21. Bella Notte – Lady And The Tramp\n\nWhat’s not to love; romance, spaghetti and dogs. Based in the early 20th century, Lady and Tramp dine behind Tony’s Italian Restaurant for “scraps” – AKA a full spaghetti and meatballs meal for two. A picturesque dinner date beneath the stars is the perfect setting for a love song. Whether you choose Tony’s version or an instrumental version of this touching song for your first dance, it will definitely be one of the many memorable moments from your wedding.\n\n22. A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes – Cinderella\n\nMake your wedding a dream with this timeless Cinderella classic. ‘A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes’ is an ideal number for your first dance if you want a classy Waltz. The whole theme of the film circles around dreams, wishes and having faith in your Fairy Godmother: you just need to believe and your fairytale will come true. As one of the original Disney princess film songs, all of your guests will know this sweet tune.\n\n23. When You Wish Upon A Star – Pinocchio\n\nContinuing on the wishing theme, Pinocchio is a puppet wishing he was a real boy. This dreamy song is known as the Walt Disney opening title music, although originally written for Pinocchio, it’s won countless awards and was the first Disney song to receive an Oscar. Just remember, your dreams will come true if this is your Disney first dance choice.\n\n24. You’ll Be In My Heart – Tarzan\n\nPhil Collins’ soundtrack from Tarzan goes down in Disney history as one of the most moving and iconic Disney movie scores. ‘You’ll Be In My Heart’ is written as a declaration of love from Kala to Tarzan, but Collins’ version delivers an overall meaning of “love is a bond that cannot be broken”. A personal favourite of ours, and a great choice for your special moment with your new husband or wife.\n\n25. Love – Robin Hood\n\nFeaturing Monica Evans’ and Nancy Adams’ breathy vocals, ‘Love’ from Robin Hood captivates us with the idea of love eternal. A short song set when Robin and Maid Marian are on a secret escape together, the song makes us feel all warm and fuzzy as we imagine a forbidden love that cannot be taken away. Known only by a few, this loveable Disney first dance choice is a rare but personal option.\n\n26. Can I Have This Dance – High School Musical 3: Senior Year\n\nThe lyrics to this beautiful song are everything. It oozes romance, and we couldn’t even choose a favourite lyric as the whole song sounds like it was specifically written for a first dance. We suspect that might be the case!\n\n27. Never Knew I Needed – The Princess And The Frog\n\nOne of Disney’s newer princess films, The Princess and The Frog’s main theme song is performed by leading RnB and Hip-Hop artist Ne-Yo. A piano-led modern Disney love song, ‘Never Knew I Needed’ was released in 2009 as the soundtrack’s first single and it climbed up the Billboard charts. The Princess and The Frog isn’t your everyday Disney fairytale, but you can make it your own with this heartfelt song on your special day.\n\n28. It Only Takes A Moment – WALL-E\n\nOriginally from the 1960s musical “Hello, Dolly!”, ‘It Only Takes A Moment’ is yet another lovey-dovey moment between WALL-E and EVE. This song allows you to see that anyone can understand the concept of love, even two robots.\n\n29. If I Didn’t Have You – Monsters Inc\n\n“I wouldn’t have nothing if I didn’t have you.” It says it all, doesn’t it! Winning the 2001 Academy Award for Best Original Song, Randy Newman’s ‘If I Didn’t Have You’ is a charming jazz song all about friendship and that bond you have with someone you love. With a similar ring to Toy Story’s “You’ve Got A Friend In Me”, they both scream first dance song to us. After all, you are marrying your best friend.\n\n30. Lava – Lava Short\n\n‘Lava’ is one of our favourite alternative Disney first dance options. This tranquil ukulele love song is all about a lonely volcano wishing “the earth, sea and sky up above will send me someone to lava.” In an adorable turn, his wish comes true and he finally has “someone to lava”. As the Disney short released for Inside Out, Lava touched all of our hearts and tugged at our heartstrings. The simplicity of the lyrics and the instrumentation makes this one of the purest songs for your Disney-fied first dance.\n\n31. Ever Ever After – Enchanted\n\nIn the modern pop song ‘Ever Ever After’, Carrie Underwood sings about real life fairytales and how we know deep down that they do happen. With a catchy melody and sensational princess-like vocals, this song could complete your big day. You’re within arms’ reach of a fantasy ending if you choose this song as your first dance.\n\n32. I’m Gonna Love You – The Hunchback Of Notre Dame 2\n\n‘I’m Gonna Love You’ is from The Hunchback Of Notre Dame 2, one of the less popular but still amazing Disney movies. Sung by Jennifer Love Hewitt, this song is from the end credits of the movie. It features gorgeous lyrics like “I was lost but now I’m found, his happiness surrounds, and now I find that my dreams can come true.”\n\n33. Love Will Find A Way – The Lion King II: Simba’s Pride\n\nReleased in 1998, the Lion King II: Simba’s Pride is perhaps most memorable for this song about love against the odds. ‘Love Will Find A Way’ is sung by Kovu and Kiara who fall in love despite being from rival tribes. With lyrics about true love always finding a way, this really is a great choice for your first dance.\n\n34. True Love’s Kiss – Enchanted\n\nIf you love the whole Disney ‘Happy Ever After’ thing, this song is a saccharin-sweet, fairytale of a song that’s about, you’ve guessed it – true love’s kiss. If you’re looking for a romantic Disney song, this one’s SO DISNEY and for true fans only.\n\nA Few Alternatives\n\nIf you and your other half fancy a slightly more alternative Disney first dance song, then you’re in luck! We’ve included 5 extra Disney hits that aren’t your everyday Disney fairytale songs, but could equally make an excellent choice.\n\n35. Hakuna Matata – The Lion King\n\nWe couldn’t not include ‘Hakuna Matata’ from one of the most popular Disney films of all time, The Lion King. It’s all no worries and feel-good beats if you choose this for your first dance. Celebrate your new married life with your “problem-free philosophy, Hakuna Matata”. With a deep bass beat and a foot-tapping rhythm, ‘Hakuna Matata’ was written by Elton John, as was the rest of The Lion King Soundtrack which received Golden Globes, Academy Awards and Grammys. A true first dance Disney hit.\n\n36. Welcome – Brother Bear\n\nA heart-warming song written by Phil Collins ‘Welcome’ is all about family and everyone being part of one entity. With lyrics like “All we have we share, And all of us we care” it is a happy-go-lucky song that’ll get all the family involved on the dance floor. The union of two families is what a wedding’s all about, after all. If family is what’s important, we would highly recommend this song.\n\n37. True To Your Heart – Mulan\n\nThe closing song for Mulan, ‘True To Your Heart’ was performed by 98 Degrees ft Stevie Wonder. With Stevie Wonders’ unique musical sound obviously inspiring the soundtrack, this song is ideal for any soul loving couples who also love Disney. The song speaks for itself with themes of support and love throughout.\n\n38. Touch The Sky – Brave\n\nSung by Julie Fowlis, a Scottish folk singer, ‘Touch The Sky’ is a free-spirited song from 2012 Scottish fairy tale, Brave. The song is all about the feeling of freedom and adventure all whilst celebrating Scottish folk music. Whether you’re a Scottish couple or just love the music and the film, this is a very uplifting Disney first dance option.\n\n39. Baby Mine – Dumbo\n\nA song sang from mother to baby, ‘Baby Mine’ isn’t your average first dance choice, yet it expresses all the elements of a wedding and a bond in marriage; care, protection, love and trust. An emotional and loving first dance choice that will definitely bring some tears to your family’s eyes, Dumbo’s emotional story is a lovely option for you and your partner.\n\n40. Friend Like Me – Aladdin\n\nIf your new spouse is your best friend and you’re in the mood for an all out party for your first dance, this could be a great option. It’s filled with pizazz, energy and joy, and would be perfect for a choreographed routine or even a flashmob!\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nWe hope our list of romantic Disney songs gives you lots of inspiration for your first dance song choice!
