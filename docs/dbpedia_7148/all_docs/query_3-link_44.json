        "text": "Written By Sahana Soma Kodarkar\n\nLast Modified 22-06-2023\n\nBiodegradable Polymers: Introduction, Properties, Uses\n\nBiodegradable polymers is an important chapter in CBSE class 12th Chemistry. Polymers play a significant role in our lives these days. There are different types of polymers and are used for different purposes. There are polymers that are resistant to the process of environmental degradation and are held responsible for the accumulation of polymeric solid waste materials. These solid wastes cause acute environmental problems and remain undegraded for quite a long time. With the increasing use of polymers, waste disposal of these products is also posing a serious problem.\n\nBiodegradable polymers were discovered with the objective to control the damage caused to the environment during their disposal. Biodegradable polymers are comparatively easy to be decomposed by microorganisms. In this article, let’s learn everything about biodegradable polymers examples.\n\nBiodegradable Polymers: Definition\n\nBiodegradable polymers can be easily degraded by microorganisms within a reasonable period, ensuring that biodegradable polymers and their degraded products have a minimal environmental impact. These polymers are broken into small segments by enzyme-catalysed reactions, and microorganisms produce these enzymes.\n\nBiodegradable Polymers: Formation\n\nInserting hydrolysable ester groups into the polymer chain is one way of making a biodegradable polymer. For example, if the following acetal is added to an alkene undergoing radical polymerisation, ester groups may be introduced into the polymer. Enzymes will break down these “weak links.”\n\nBiodegradable Polymers: Examples\n\nAliphatic polyesters are an important class of biodegradable polymers because the weak links present in them are susceptible to enzyme-catalysed hydrolysis.\n\n1. Poly-\\(\\rm{β}\\)-hydroxybutyrate-co-\\(β\\)-hydroxy valerate (PHBV)\n\nIt is a copolymer of \\(3\\)-hydroxybutanoic acid and \\(3\\)-hydroxypentanoic acid with ester linkages connecting the monomer units.\n\nProperties of PHBV\n\nIt is a biodegradable polymer and undergoes bacterial degradation in the environment.\n\nIn the synthesis of PHBV, \\(3\\)-hydroxybutanoic acid provides rigidity, while \\(3\\)-hydroxypentanoic acid gives it flexibility.\n\nUses: PHBV is used\n\nFor making orthopaedic devices\n\nAs speciality packing materials.\n\nIn controlled drug release.\n\n2. Polyglycolic Acid (PGA)\n\nPolyglycolic is obtained by the chain polymerization of a cyclic dimer of glycolic acid, \\( {\\text{HO-C}} { {\\text{H}}_ {\\text{2}}} {\\text{COOH}}\\).\n\n3. Polylactic Acid (PLA)\n\nPolylactic acid is obtained by polymerization of the cyclic dimer of lactic acid \\(\\left({{\\text{HO-CH}}\\left({{\\text{C}} { {\\text{H}}_3}} \\right) {\\text{COOH}}} \\right)\\).\n\n4. Poly (\\(\\varepsilon \\)-caprolactone) (PCL)\n\nIt is obtained by chain polymerization of the lactone of \\(6\\)-hydroxy hexanoic acid.\n\n5. Nylon-2-Nylon-6\n\nNylon-\\(2\\)-Nylon-\\(6\\) is an alternating polyamide copolymer of glycine \\(\\left({{\\text{N}} { {\\text{H}}_ {\\text{2}}} {\\text{C}} { {\\text{H}}_ {\\text{2}}} {\\text{COOH}}} \\right)\\) and aminocaproic acid \\(\\left({{\\text{N}} { {\\text{H}}_ {\\text{2}}} {\\text{-}} { {\\left({{\\text{C}} { {\\text{H}}_ {\\text{2}}}} \\right)}_5} {\\text{COOH}}} \\right).\\)\n\nBiodegradable Polymers: List\n\nBiodegradable polymers are two types; they are natural biodegradable polymers and synthetic biodegradable polymers. Various lists of biodegradable polymers are as follows:\n\nBiodegradable Polymers: Properties\n\nThe properties of biodegradable polymers are listed as follows. These properties will help students understand why it is easier to decompose biodegradable polymers.\n\nUntil degraded, biodegradable polymers can retain good mechanical integrity.\n\nSince biodegradable polymers have extremely strong carbon backbones that are difficult to crack, degradation usually begins at the end-groups.\n\nBiodegradable polymers are non-toxic.\n\nDegradation rates of biodegradable polymers can be regulated.\n\nCrystallinity is also lacking in biodegradable polymers because it prevents access to end groups.\n\nBiodegradable polymers are hydrophilic.\n\nBiodegradable Polymers: Benefits\n\nThere are many benefits of using biodegradable polymers. The list of benefits of using biodegradable polymers is listed as follows:\n\nIt is Easy to recycle biodegradable polymers: These polymers not only decompose faster when discarded but can also be easily recycled using an organic method. Recycling helps to reduce landfill waste, and the recycled bio-waste can also be used as compost or as a renewable energy source for biogas production.\n\nThe amount of waste generated is reduced: Biodegradable plastic degrades in a matter of months, depending on the material used to make it and the method of disposal.\n\nReduction in carbon Emission: One of the most important benefits of using biodegradable polymers to produce plastic bags is the significant reduction of carbon emissions during the production process instead of conventional plastic.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions are reduced: As the biodegradable polymer is used instead of conventional plastics, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced.\n\nReduced use of petroleum: Oil is an essential component in the production of traditional polymer. When you consider the amount of waste generated during refining and even during the extraction of oil from the earth, it is no surprise that petroleum harms the environment.\n\nThey consume less energy during their manufacture: Although the initial investment may be marginally higher, biodegradable plastics need less energy in the long run and require the reprocessing of fossil fuels to produce polymers.\n\nBiodegradable Polymers: Disadvantage\n\nConsidering that these are polymers and they have a significantly negative impact on the environment, a list of disadvantages of using biodegradable polymers is listed as follows:\n\nLandfills are designed to be moisture-and airtight to store potentially dangerous materials. These anaerobic conditions, which help to prevent toxic chemicals from being released from landfills, often slow down biodegradation.\n\nThe cost of biodegradable polymers is prohibitively expensive.\n\nThey are not readily available.\n\nBiodegradable polymers are not good candidates for commingled plastic recycling.\n\nBiodegradable Polymers: Uses\n\nThere are range of uses of biodegradable polymers. It is important for the students to understand the uses well. A list of uses of biodegradable polymers is mentioned as follows:\n\nThese are used for post-operative stitches.\n\nBiodegradable polymers are often used in medical products, including tissue in growth materials, controlled drug release systems, plasma replacements, etc.\n\nThese are used in agricultural materials such as films and seed coatings.\n\nThese are also used in fast-food wrappers, personal hygiene products etc.\n\nBiodegradable polymers are used in and on the soil to improve aeration and promote plant growth and help.\n\nBiodegradable polymers are used in drug delivery because it is essential for the drug to be released slowly over time rather than at once and for the pill to stay safe in the bottle until it is time to take it.\n\nBiodegradable polymers are used in gene therapy.\n\nBiodegradable polymers are used in the biodegradable system for therapeutic agents such as an antitumor, antipsychotic, anti-inflammatory agent.\n\nNon-biodegradable Polymers\n\nNon-biodegradable polymers are those polymers that are cannot degraded by microorganisms. A major portion of synthetic polymers is being used as throwaway containers and packing materials.\n\nPlastic is commonly used due to its low cost, versatility, and toughness, but most plastics are non-biodegradable. This longevity is due in part to the fact that plastic is a rare target for bacteria, making it non-biodegradable. On the other hand, Plastics can be made biodegradable by adding chemicals that break down the structure of the polymer.\n\nExamples of non-biodegradable polymers are polyethylene, polypropylene, synthetic rubber, polyvinyl chloride, etc.\n\nPolyethylene\n\nClassification: Polyethylene is classified into the following classes based on density and branching.\n\nHigh-Density Polyethylene (HDPE)\n\nLow-Density Polyethylene (LDPE)\n\nMedium-Density Polyethylene (MDPE)\n\nCross-linked Polyethylene (PEX)\n\nUltra-High-Molecular-Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE)\n\nChlorinated Polyethylene (CPE)\n\nLinear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE)\n\nPolyethylene: Properties\n\nThe properties of polyethylene is listed as follows:\n\nPolyethylene has low strength, hardness, and rigidity, yet it has a lot of ductilities, impact strength, and low friction.\n\nBecause of its low melting point compared to other thermoplastics, the commercial utility of polyethylene is restricted.\n\nPolyethylene is made up of nonpolar, saturated hydrocarbons with a high molecular weight.\n\nPolyethylene is an excellent electrical insulator.\n\nPolyethylene: Disadvantages\n\nA list of disadvantages associated with polyethylene is listed as follows:\n\nLike many other plastics, the polymer takes a long time to degrade, and as a result, it can remain in landfills for decades, taking up space that we do not have.\n\nThough most plastic polymers can be recycled technically, there are many different varieties to filter through, which is time-consuming and costly.\n\nIncineration is another option for getting rid of polyethylene; however, it can produce dangerous gas emissions.\n\nPolyethylene is mostly derived from petroleum or natural gas, both of which are limited resources.\n\nPolyethylene: Uses\n\nUses of polyethylene is mention as follows:\n\nPolyethylene films are used to make most commercial garbage bags, sandwich bags, and plastic packaging.\n\nPolyethylene is utilised in various products, including seat covers, milk bottles, pails, pans, and plates.\n\nPolyethylene is a film that is used to package food, clothing, and hardware.\n\nSummary\n\nFrom this article, we can conclude that biodegradable polymers are ecofriendly as they decompose by microorganisms. This property of biodegradable polymers makes their use in the medical, commercial and industrial fields.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions on Biodegradable Polymers\n\nFrequently asked questions related to biodegradable polymers is listed as follows:\n\nQ.1. Is nylon \\(6\\) a biodegradable polymer?\n\nAns: No, because the amide bonds are very stable in Nylon \\(6\\), whereas Nylon-\\(2\\)-Nylon-\\(6\\) is a biodegradable polymer.\n\nQ.2.

Why are some polymers biodegradable?\n\nAns: The polymers in which the carbon-carbon bonds of a chain are inert to enzyme-catalysed reaction; hence, polymers are non-biodegradable.\n\nQ.4. Which is not a biodegradable polymer?\n\nAns: The polymers in which the carbon-carbon bonds of a chain are inert to enzyme-catalyzed reaction, hence such polymers are non-biodegradable.\n\nQ.5. Which polymer is readily biodegradable?\n\nAns: Biodegradable polymers are degraded by microorganisms within a reasonable period, ensuring that biodegradable polymers and their degraded products have a minimal environmental impact. Poly(l-lactic acid), the most widely used bioderived polymer, is biodegradable.\n\nQ.6. How are biodegradable polymers made?\n\nAns: Inserting hydrolysable ester groups into the polymer chain is one way of making biodegradable polymer. For example, if the following acetal is added to an alkene undergoing radical polymerisation, ester groups may be introduced into the polymer. Enzymes will break down these “weak-links.”\n\nConcept of Biodegradable and Non-biodegradable Polymers"
