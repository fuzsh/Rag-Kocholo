        "text": "You do not often come across nature’s wonder amidst a commercialised city area, but here in Pokhara, Nepal, you will come across just that. Located right opposite the famous Davis Falls in Chhorepatan, in the Kaski district, the Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave is the longest in Nepal and South Asia. This cave is one of the major attractions of Pokhara for many reasons; the water flowing down from the Davis Falls is what lies in the cave, and apart from its natural beauty, it is also a place of religious significance.\n\nGupteshwor Mahadev Cave History\n\nImage Credit: Bhumbdr for Wikipedia\n\nThe Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave’s history goes back to the 16th century when a group of local men first discovered it. History says that these men were intrigued by a strange spot covered in grass and debris and discovered a cave mouth once it was cleared out of their curiosity. Probing more into this spot, they uncovered various portraits and statues of Hindu Gods and Goddesses like Mahadev, Parvati, Nageshwar and Saraswati.\n\nAs the group moved into the cave, they learnt that the water running through it came from Davis Falls. Further inspection led them to find an idol-like object that resembled Lord Shiva, thus giving the cave its name, Gupteshwor Mahadev, which means ‘Hidden God’ in Nepalese. It was only in 1991 that the local people installed the statue at the cave entrance. This cave in Nepal is 772 metres below sea level and is said to be the longest cave in Nepal.\n\nAlso Read: Places To Visit In Pokhara\n\nGupteshwor Mahadev Cave Timings And Ticket Price\n\nImage Credit: Sushila Gurung for Wikipedia\n\nThe Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave ticket price and timings are from 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. every day except public holidays, and Rs. 100 will be charged per person.

Just a short distance away lies the majestic Davis Falls, the iconic World Peace Pagoda, the scenic hilly region of Sarangkot and many other captivating attractions.\n\n1.

The Davis Falls is also called ‘Patale Chhango’, which means underground waterfall in Nepalese. The waterfall is in a fast-moving river in a narrow canyon that passes through a series of caves after the falls; one such cave is the Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave. The water flows from the fall about 500 feet through the natural tunnel at a depth of 100 feet from ground level, making this place a witness to the grandeur of nature.\n\nDistance from Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave: 140 metres approx.\n\nTimings: 6 am to 6 pm\n\nEntry fee: 100 NPR\n\nRelated Post: Homestays In Nepal\n\n2.

There is also one more pagoda in Nepal, which is located in Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha. This place is serene and peaceful, standing 1100 metres high at Ananda Hill. Moreover, this place offers a perfect view of the Himalayan range, Fewa Lake, and Pokhara. The white-painted peace monument can also be viewed from a distance, portraying its simple yet striking architecture.\n\nDistance from Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave: 3.5 km approx.\n\nTimings: 5 am to 5 pm\n\nEntry fee: Free\n\n3. Begnas Lake\n\nImage Credit: Mithunkunwar9 for Wikimedia Commons\n\nMake sure to visit Begnas Lake, which is located in the Kaski district of Nepal and among the second most prominent lakes in Pokhara Valley. An ideal freshwater lake, this lake offers you an escape from the city noise to a quiet freshwater lake in the lap of nature that keeps changing colour according to the season. An integral part of your visit is Begnas Lake, one of the most visited places around Pokhara Valley, since it offers visitors an experience apart from witnessing nature’s beauty. To bask in the alluring surroundings, you can opt for the boating experience, and hiking enthusiasts can go on the Begnas Thulokote Hiking trek.\n\nDistance from Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave: 17 km approx.\n\nTimings: Morning to Evening\n\nEntry fee: Free\n\nRelated Post: Nepal In September\n\n4.

This place offers visitors a breathtaking view of the Annapurna Himalayan mountain peaks, especially during sunsets or sunrises due to the striking pink and orange hues the mountain peaks take on. The hike to Sarangkot is about a 3-hour uphill walk and has the longest and fastest zipline in the world.\n\nDistance from Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave: 13.3 km approx.\n\nTimings: 8 am to 7 pm\n\nEntry fee: NPR 20 (Nepali) and NPR 50 (Foreigners)\n\n5.

The age-old and traditional Newari bazaar is so ethnically diverse as one can see its ties with the Newar architecture of the Kathmandu valley. Located about 4km from the lakeside, this bazaar still holds on to its original charm and well. The ancient Bindhyabasini temple finds itself in the old bazaar and is said to have been built in 1842 B.S by King Siddhi Narayana Shah.\n\nDistance from Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave: 6 km approx.\n\nTimings: 8 am to 6 pm\n\nEntry fee: Free\n\nRelated Post: Nepal Mountains\n\n6.

Although once you reach the peak, the views are immaculate, this peak is an easy climb and does not require any technical climbing skills. The Dhampus Peak stands at an altitude of 6012m and is a remarkable experience since the summit offers an inspiring view of the mountains, including Phedi and Mardi Valley. This expedition has it all, from the lush green fields and the nourishing farms of rural Nepal to the arid, barren alpine landscapes of the mighty Himalayas.\n\nDistance from Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave: 28 km approx.\n\nMaximum Altitude: 1880m\n\nEntry fee: Stats from USD 65.\n\nHow To Reach Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave Pokhara\n\nImage Credit: Mike Messer for Wikipedia\n\nThe Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave resides on the side of Siddhartha Highway and is reachable from the Dam side in Pokhara. The cave sits across Davis Falls and sometimes takes a little time to find since it hides behind a small outdoor bazaar.\n\nThe cave is accessible by a local bus or taxi that you can find or hire from the lakeside, approximately 15 minutes away, and the dam side, just 5 minutes away. The bus fare is around Rs. 30, while a taxi will charge you Rs. 700. Renting a bicycle or scooter is also an option, but alternatively, if you enjoy walking, it takes an hour from the Lakeside and 30 minutes from the Dam side.\n\nRelated Post: Paragliding In Nepal\n\nBest Time To Visit The Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave\n\nImage Credit: Thapaliyashreeram for Wikipedia\n\nThe best time to visit the Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave is throughout the year since it is also open to the public all year round.
