        "text": "Public engineering institution located in Roorkee, Uttarakhand\n\nIndian Institute of Technology Roorkee (abbreviated IIT Roorkee) is a technical university located in Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India. It is the oldest engineering institution in India.[3][4] It was founded as the College of Civil Engineering in 1847 during East India Company rule in India by James Thomason, the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces in which Roorkee was located; its purpose was to train officers and surveyors employed in the construction of the Ganges Canal.[4][3] In 1854, after the completion of the canal and Thomason's death, it was renamed the Thomason College of Civil Engineering by Proby Cautley, the designer and projector of the canal.[5][6] It was renamed University of Roorkee in 1949, and again renamed IIT Roorkee in 2001. The institution has 22 academic departments covering Engineering, Applied Sciences, Humanities & Social Sciences and Management programs with an emphasis on scientific and technological education and research.[7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe institution was founded in 1847 by James Thomason, the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces (in which Roorkee then lay) to aid engineers and surveyors at work in the construction of the Ganges Canal. It offered instruction catered to a variety of students; this included an engineering class for the domiciled British and some Indians; an upper subordinates class for British noncommissioned officers; and a lower subordinates class for Indian surveyors. By the mid-1880s, \"the school has a hundred students, substantial buildings, and a reputation as an important center for the study of hydraulic engineering.\"[3][4][6]\n\nAn Electrical Engineering department was added in 1897.[8] The architecture department instituted a master's degree course in Architecture (M. Arch.) in 1969–70.[9]\n\nIn 1978, the Institute of Paper Technology, Saharanpur was merged with the then University of Roorkee. The Institute of Paper Technology was established as School of Paper Technology by the Government of India in 1964, with an aid from the Royal Swedish Government. The school was renamed as the Institute of Paper Technology in July 1968 and subsequently Department of Paper Technology in July 1992.[10]\n\nThe first edition of Thomso, the institute's annual cultural festival was held in 1982. In 1997 the government of India released a stamp dedicated to 150th anniversary of university of Roorkee.\n\nOn 21 September 2001, an ordinance issued by the Government of India declared it as the nation's seventh Indian Institute of Technology, renaming it to the current name, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. The ordinance was converted into an act by the Parliament to make IIT Roorkee an \"Institution of National Importance\".[11]\n\nTo mark the institute's 175th anniversary in 2022, the central government issued a Rs 175 coin as a gesture of commemoration.[12]\n\nCampus\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main campus in Roorkee has an area of 365 acres (1,480,000 m2).[13]\n\nIIT Roorkee has a separate campus of 25 acres (100,000 m2) in Saharanpur which offers courses in Polymer Science, Process Engineering, Paper Technology & Packaging Technology, Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing.[13] In addition to this, a new ten-acre campus has been established in Greater Noida, Knowledge Park II, which was inaugurated on 4 April 2011. The Noida extension centre has 16 lecture rooms, software laboratories, faculty offices, a library and a computer center.[14]\n\nMost students live in the hostels, where extracurricular activities complement the academic routine. The campus has 16 hostels, of which two (Sarojini, Kasturba) are occupied by girls.[15] The campus has a new co-ed hostel, Vigyan Kunj.[16] A new hostel for female students, the Himalaya Bhawan, was recently constructed. Hostels may accommodate undergraduate and graduate students along with doctoral students. Students are assigned to hostels by the school administration after their freshmen year. There are nine hostels for married students, doctoral students and foreign students. Each bhawan has a mess. Mess administration consists of a staff advisor, a chief advisor, and a student mess secretary.\n\nOrganization and administration\n\n[edit]\n\nGovernance\n\n[edit]\n\nAll IITs follow the same organization structure which has President of India as visitor at the top of the hierarchy. Directly under the president is the IIT Council. Under the IIT Council is the board of governors of each IIT. Under the board of governors is the director, who is the chief academic and executive officer of the IIT. Under the director, in the organizational structure, comes the deputy director. Under the director and the deputy director, come the deans, heads of departments, registrar. [17]\n\nDepartments and Centers\n\n[edit]\n\nIIT ROORKEE in the country having the largest number of academic units. It has 21 academic departments covering engineering, applied sciences, humanities & social sciences, and management programmes, 1 academic center, 3 centers of excellence, 5 academic service centers and 3 supporting units.[18]\n\nDepartments\n\nEngineering and Applied Sciences\n\nArchitecture and Planning\n\nApplied Science and Engineering\n\nBiosciences and Bioengineering\n\nChemical Engineering\n\nChemistry\n\nCivil Engineering[19]\n\nComputer Science and Engineering\n\nEarthquake Engineering\n\nEarth Sciences\n\nElectrical Engineering\n\nElectronics and Communication Engineering\n\nHumanities and Social Sciences\n\nHydrology\n\nHydro and Renewable Energy\n\nManagement Studies\n\nMathematics\n\nMechanical and Industrial Engineering\n\nMetallurgical and Materials Engineering\n\nPaper Technology\n\nPolymer and Process Engineering\n\nPhysics\n\nWater Resources Development and Management\n\nSciences\n\nPhysics\n\nChemistry\n\nMathematics\n\nBusiness\n\nManagement Studies\n\nHumanities\n\nHumanities and Social Sciences\n\nCenters\n\nCentre of Excellence\n\nCentre of Nanotechnology\n\nCentre for Transportation Systems (CTRANS)\n\nCentre of Excellence in Disaster Mitigation & Management (CoEDMM)\n\nAcademic Service centers\n\nMahatma Gandhi Central Library\n\nCentre of Nanotechnology\n\nCentre for Transportation Systems\n\nCentre of Excellence in Disaster Mitigation & Management\n\nContinuing Education Centre\n\nInstitute Computer Centre\n\nInstitute Instrumentation Centre\n\nIntellectual Property Rights Cell\n\nQuality Improvement Programme\n\nSupporting Service Centers\n\nEducational Technology Cell\n\nInstitute Hospital\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nIIT Roorkee offers academic programmes in Engineering, Technology, Applied Sciences, and Management.

Before being converted into an IIT, the university selected students through the Roorkee Entrance Exam (REE) conducted on an All-India level. The selectivity of REE was close to 0.25%. After IIT-JEE, it was considered to be the second toughest engineering entrance examination in India.[21] Admission to PG programmes in engineering and architecture is on the basis of GATE score and/or a written test and interview. For PG programmes in fundamental sciences admission is based on the Joint Admission Test (JAM).[22]\n\nAlong with the engineering courses, the institute offers a two-year residential MBA program for which the admissions, starting from 2011, will be done on the basis of Common Admission Test, thus replacing Joint Management Entrance Test (JMET) previously conducted by the IITs.[23] The institute also offered an interdisciplinary program in computer applications leading to a degree in Master of computer applications (MCA). The MCA program was a three-year course and admission for the course was through JAM. This programme has been discontinued.\n\nAccording to statistics published by institute in 2007–08 4137 students were enrolled in the institute across all programs.
