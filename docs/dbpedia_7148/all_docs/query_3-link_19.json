        "text": "Natural disasters refer to hazardous activities damaging both resources and lives. There are different types of natural disasters such as floods, storms, tsunamis, earthquakes, etc. Over the course of its billions-year history, the earth has seen several natural disasters. Several mass extinction events and severe consequences for various surviving species have resulted from some of these events. To find the answer to this and more details on Natural disasters, here is a blog that will explore everything!\n\nAlso Read: Class 8 Agriculture\n\nAlso Read: Environmental Conservation\n\nWhat is Natural Disaster?\n\nA natural disaster can be defined as “A major event caused by Earth’s natural processes that leads to significant environmental degradation and loss of life.” A natural disaster is frequently preceded by a natural hazard. The Gujarat Earthquake, for example, which struck on January 26, 2001, was a natural calamity. The natural danger lives underneath the active fault lines that run through Gujarat.\n\nAnthropogenic causes, on the other hand, can cause or affect some natural dangers. Deforestation, mining, and agricultural activities, for example, can all cause landslides. Natural disasters frequently result in widespread damage. Natural disasters, such as wildfires, destroy animal habitats while also causing property damage and loss of life.\n\nAlso Read: Law And Social Justice Class 8\n\nTypes of Natural Disasters\n\nGeological Disasters, Hydrological disasters, Meteorological Disasters, and Biological Disasters are the four broad types of natural hazards.\n\nGeological Disasters\n\nGeological hazards, or dangers caused by geological (i.e., Earth) processes, such as plate tectonics, are a type of risk. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are examples of this. In general, geological extreme events are beyond human control, however, humans have a significant impact on the events’ consequences.\n\nAlso Read: Public Facilities Class 8\n\nMeteorological Disasters\n\nHazards caused by meteorological (i.e., weather) phenomena, particularly those related to temperature and wind, are known as meteorological hazards. Heat waves, cold waves, cyclones, hurricanes, and freezing rain are all examples of this. In the Atlantic, cyclones are known as hurricanes, while in the Pacific, they are known as typhoons.\n\nAlso Read: Class 8 The Indian Constitution\n\nHydrological Disasters\n\nHazards caused by hydrological (water) processes are known as hydrological hazards. Floods, droughts, mudslides, and tsunamis are examples of natural disasters. Floods and droughts may cause havoc on agriculture and are one of the leading causes of famine. The 1931 Central China floods killed three or four million people, making it the greatest natural disaster in history(excluding pandemics).\n\nAlso Read: Understanding Secularism Class 8 Notes\n\nBiological Disasters\n\nBiological dangers are those that arise as a result of biological processes. This comprises a wide range of diseases, including infectious diseases that move from person to person and pose a significant threat to vast populations of people. Biological hazards are often left out of discussions about natural hazards, instead of falling under the purview of medicine and public health.\n\nNow that we have studied the classification of Natural Disasters let us look into some Natural Disasters in depth.\n\nTornadoes\n\nTornadoes are rotating, funnel-shaped clouds that form as a result of intense thunderstorms. With powerful winds averaging 30 miles per hour, they extend from a thunderstorm to the ground. They can also go from being stationary to 70 miles per hour in a matter of seconds.\n\nTornadoes can strike with little or no notice, giving those in affected areas only seconds to seek shelter. People often endure emotional anguish as a result of the unexpected nature of tornadoes and severe storms. Overwhelming anxiety, difficulty sleeping, and other depression-like symptoms are common reactions to natural disasters.\n\nHurricanes\n\nTropical storms that originate in the southern Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern Pacific Ocean are known as hurricanes. Every year, hurricanes harm millions of people living along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Hurricanes are known to cause mental suffering in their victims. Before, during, and after these types of storms, people commonly experience intense anxiety, continual worrying, difficulty sleeping, and other depression-like symptoms. Other symptoms of hurricane-related emotional distress include:\n\nFearing that forecasted storms could turn into hurricanes, even if the chances of this happening are slim, yelling or fighting with family and friends on a regular basis Having storm-related thoughts, memories, or dreams that you can’t seem to get out of your head.\n\nFloods\n\nFloods happen when water overflows from an area that is ordinarily dry. Floods are caused by a variety of factors, including hurricanes and tropical storms, broken dams or levees, and flash floods that happen within minutes or hours of heavy rain. Although floods are more common around the shore, especially during hurricane season, they can happen anywhere and vary in magnitude and length. Even little streams, gullies, and creeks that appear to be unaffected in dry weather might become flooded.
