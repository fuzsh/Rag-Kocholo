        "text": "Culinary traditions of Kashmir\n\nKashmiri cuisine is the cuisine of the Kashmir Valley. The cuisine has strong influences from neighbouring regions in central Asia and the Indian subcontinent.[3][4] Rice has been a staple food in Kashmir since ancient times.[5] The equivalent for the phrase \"bread and butter\" in Kashmiri is haakh-batta (greens and rice).[6]\n\nKashmiri cuisine is generally meat-heavy.[7][8] The region has, per capita, the highest mutton consumers in the subcontinent.[9][10] In a majority of Kashmiri cooking, bread is not part of the meal.[11] Bread is generally only eaten with tea in the morning or evening.[11] A typical Kashmiri meal consists of a generous serving of rice (about 250 gms), mutton (100 gms) and vegetables (about 100gms, mostly greens) cooked in oil, and yoghurt (50 to 250 gms).[6]\n\nThe cooking methods of vegetables, mutton, homemade cheese (paneer), and legumes are similar to those of Kashmiri Pandits, except in the use of onions, garlic and shallots by Muslims in place of asafoetida.[12] Lamb or Sheep is more prevalent in Kashmiri Muslim cuisine, while Kashmiri Pandit dishes more frequently feature goat or chevon.[13] Cockscomb flower, called \"mawal\" in Kashmiri, is boiled to prepare a red food colouring, as used in certain dishes. Pandit cuisine uses the mildly pungent Kashmiri red chili powder as a spice, as well as ratanjot to impart colour to certain dishes like rogan josh. Kashmiri Muslim cuisine uses chilies in moderate quantity, and avoid hot dishes at large meals.[12] In Kashmiri Muslim cuisine, vegetable curries are common with meat traditionally considered an expensive indulgence.[12] Meat along with rice, some vegetables and salad are prepared on special occasions like Eid al-Fitr.[14]\n\nHistory of Kashmiri cuisine\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom the mythical Mahabharata to the Iranian invasion of Kashmir (which was a part of Gandhara) by Darius in 516 BC,[15] to the Mauryans who established Srinagara to the Kushan Empire to the invasion of Kashmir by Timur in 1398,[16][17] the culture and cuisine of Kashmiris are linked to the greater Indian, Persian and Central Asian[18] cuisines mixed with local innovations and availabilities of ingredients.[19] The term kabab is Arabic in origin, korma has Turkish roots, and rogan josh, yakhaen, ab gosht, rista and goshtaba stem from Persian sources.[20]\n\nEarly history\n\n[edit]\n\nThere is a legend that aeons ago Kashmir valley was a vast mountain lake.[22] The soil contains remains of fresh-water fish and fossil-oysters and the black shells of water chestnut may be found in layers embedded in the earth at a height of 457 metres above the level of the valley.[22]\n\nPaleolithic age\n\n[edit]\n\nThe process of Kashmir's amalgamation with outer world commenced with the importation of primitive forms of snake and fire worship from Iran.[23] Since Paleolithic times, serpents were worshipped and buried with a supply of insects in their graves as a provision for their future life.[23] In addition, they splashed grains at shrines and graves to express regard unto snakes and other animals.[23] Bommai Sopore archaeological site, discovered by Dr Mamtaz Yatoo in 2005, has a prehistoric rock engraving, the first of its kind found in Kashmir.[24][25] This upper Paleolithic engraving depicts chase and game engagements of the prehistoric population.[24] Recent investigations by archaeologists at Overa valley of Pahalgam have revealed stone tools of Paleolithic ages, including single-edged stone blades used for preying of animals.[26]\n\nNeolithic culture\n\n[edit]\n\nEven before the Megalithic culture that followed the Neolithic period, there is evidence of wheat, barley and lentil cultivation.[27] Clear evidence for agriculture in the form of large domestic storages of grain and rachises of wheat and barley, as well as millets, were found after 2500 BC in Qasim Bagh in Kashmir.[28] The Kashmir Valley contains multiple sites of the so-called Northern Neolithic, possibly dating as early as 3000 BC when climate became warmer.[28] Excavations from Pethpuran Teng suggest a wider network of contact of this early population, and a significantly deeper time transition of broom-corn millets across the Inner Asian mountains.[28] The date range returned from the lentil samples at Pethpuran Tang represent one of the earliest dated pulse crops from the region (c. 2700 BC).[28] While the valley is altitudinally comparable to other inter-montane agro-pastoralist sites in Central Asia, Kashmir's slightly lower latitude presented the valley as a geographic threshold where crops could be grown without the necessary introgression of traits allowing their cultivation in higher and more northerly regions.[28]\n\nThe range of tools recovered at the Neolithic site of Burzahom, in the district of Srinagar shows the men were skilled hunters with knowledge of implements for cultivation.[27] Stone hearths have been found at ground levels, near the mouth of pits.[27] The Period II (Ceramic Neolithic) structures show a dish with a hollow stand and a globular pot.[27] Rectangular harvesters with a curved cutting edge have also been recovered.[27] Presence of harpoons indicates fishing.[29] The art-producing behaviour of Neolithic men is witnessed in a hunting scene, with human, a dog and a sun path diagram.[27] Mortar and pestle characterised by a rectangular cross-section are made of the same volcanic rock as used by the current Kashmiris.[30] The presence of lentil explains that the people of Burzahom had wide contacts with Central Asia.[27] Harvesters (both in stone and bone) with two holes for handling it indicate contacts with China.[31]\n\nAt the Gufkral Neolithic site 41 km southwest of Srinagar, archaeologists have confirmed settlers were engaged in wild game as well as domestication of animals.[32] The animals that were known at the time were wild sheep, wild goat, wild cattle, red deer, wolf, Himalayan Ibex and bear.[32] Roasting of food (both flesh and grain) was done only outside as no hearths or fireplaces were found inside the dwelling pits. Piercers were used for making incisions and for tearing open the flesh after the animal was killed and skinned, scrapers were used to scrape fat from the flesh.[33] In the Phase IB of Neolithic occupation, some new additions included cattle and common peas.[29] Pig (sus scrofa) and fish made their appearance in the late Neolithic period. Bones of hare (lepus), hedgehog, rodents and beaver were also recovered.[34]\n\nOn the basis of the presence of the Emmer wheat (Triticumdicoccum) crop at Kanispur, seven kilometres east of Baramulla, contacts of Harappans with the Neolithic Kashmir has been suggested.[29] With the Aryan migration to Kashmir around the 8th century BC, the fire worship cult got embedded into the innate religio-cultural texture of Kashmir through practices such as a phallic emblem of cooked rice.[23] The local ceremony of vayuk is again near to the Iranian style of Farvadin. On a special day of the month, Kashmiri Muslims remember their dead, visit their graves and distribute loaves of rice.[23]\n\nIndo-Greek and Kushana period\n\n[edit]\n\nEarthen thalis (pans) have been found at Semthan, north of Bijbehara from the Indo-Greek period (200 BC – 1st century AD).[35] Handis (metal pots), flat plates, pedestalled cups and edged bowls have been reported in large numbers from the excavated sites of Harwan, Kanispur and Semthan.[36] At Kanispur, cooking pots have been found.[36] Kushan coins have been recovered in large numbers from the Kashmir valley with those of Kanishka continuing to emulate Vima's motif of king sacrificing at an altar.[36]\n\nThe Kushan period is characterized by a double-cropping pattern, suggesting a change in agricultural practices associated with a population recovery following a post-Neolithic decline.[37] Finds of Vitis vinifera (Common Grape Vine), Emblica officinalis (Indian Gooseberry), Ziziphus nummularia (Wild Jujube), Juglans regia (English Walnut) and Prunus amygdalus (Almond) suggest that horticulture and foraging played an important role in the diet of the occupants.[37] The Kushan remains from Kanispur are dominated by barley, in contrast to Semthan where wheat is more common.[37]\n\nThe Kushana history tells us that right from the days of the Kushana rulers (1st century AD – 450 AD) there were contacts between Romans and Kashmir. Kashmir was connected to the southern silk route via Gilgit and Yasin valley at Tashkurghan. The main items of export to Rome were saffron and dolomiaea costus (kutha). Dolomiaea costus was used in Rome for various purposes, among which for scenting of food and seasoning of wine.\n\nHindu dynasties\n\n[edit]\n\nThere were military contacts between the Karkota kingdom in Kashmir and the Tang (618 AD – 907 AD) court in China.[39] When the Chinese Tang Dynasty successfully defeated the Tibetan forces and entered little Palur in October 722 AD, Kashmir was credited for providing agricultural supplies essential to sustaining the Chinese troops stationed in Gilgit valley.[39]\n\nKashmir Sultanate (1346 – 1580s)\n\n[edit]\n\nSince Islam did not directly arrive from Arabia to Kashmir, it naturally carried with it mixed Iranian and Central Asian influences.[23] Similarly, the Kashmiri Hindus were doing things which would have frightened orthodox Hindus from India.[40] They drank water brought by a Muslim, ate food that was cooked in a Muslim boat and even Muslim foster-mothers were allowed to feed their children.[40] Hence, the rishi cult identified with Hinduism in subscribing to vegetarianism, non-injury to animals and abstaining from the use of garlic and onion in food.[23] Nund Rishi, according to a legend, subsisted on a diet of dried dandelion leaves and Lal Ded preached and practiced strict vegetarianism.[41]\n\nMoreover, when Yusuf Shah Chak, the last sovereign king of Kashmir signed a treaty with emperor Akbar recognising his symbolic sovereignty in 1586 one of the terms was that the mint, the saffron and game would remain under imperial control.[42]\n\nMughals (1580s – 1750s)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Srinagar, poor people's meals were made of ghee, milk, beef, onions, wine, pickles, and vinegar.[citation needed] Rice, fish, and numerous vegetables were staple foods during the Mughal era.[citation needed] Butter and fats were not widely used in cooking since they were believed to be dangerous owing to the cold environment.[citation needed] The river water was not drunk by the people of South Kashmir.[citation needed] They drank Dal Lake water, which was warm, pleasant, and easily digestible.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1635–36, during Shahjahan's reign, a violent conflict flared up between the Shias and Sunnis when a group of both the sections were eating mulberries at Maisuma and some were accused of using indecent words against Muhammad.[43] In 1641, unprecedented floods followed by a famine rendered the villages desolate.[43] Shahjahan sent 30,000 rupees to the subedar Tarbiyat Khan to be distributed among the destitute in Srinagar and also ordered that five centres should be opened in the valley to provide free food to the needy.[43]\n\nSikh Rule (1819–1846)\n\n[edit]\n\nCow slaughter was declared a crime punishable by death and many people accused of killing cows were publicly hanged.[44] Owing to the shortsighted policy of the rulers Kashmír witnessed an acute agrarian crisis.[44] Sikh rulers imposed one half of the paddy production as a share of the government.[44] The population of Kashmir decreased from 800,000 in 1822–1823 to 120,000 in 1835.[44]\n\nDogra Rule (1846–1947)\n\n[edit]\n\nCoarse rice and haakh constituted the main food.[45] Where paddy cultivation was restricted due to uneven terrain and lack of irrigation facilities, wheat and maize constituted the main items of food.[45] In certain parts of Kashmir they lived on aquatic products such as singhara (water nuts).[45]\n\nKashmiri apples were carried by coolies on their backs over 12 days to Rawalpindi in British India.[46]\n\nThe famine of 1878–79 was deadly.[45] Also, catching and eating of fish by men driven by hunger was made unlawful by an edict during the reign of Maharaja Ranbir Singh.[47] Often anyone who killed a cow was boiled in oil and the hung from a hook which was fixed on to a pole in a public place.[46] People did not possess any right to waste land and the only right which the villager had was that he could plant trees on such lands, and was the owner of the trees and not of land.[45] Milk and butter was often taken away from gujjars (nomadic herdsmen) without payment by the officials.[46]\n\nFoods mentioned in ancient Kashmiri texts\n\n[edit]\n\nFoods mentioned in ancient Kashmiri scriptures/chronicles/travellers' accounts include:[48][49][50]\n\nRice, which could be imported from other countries in times of famine.[51][52] Patañjali's Mahabhashya reveals that rice was already being cultivated in the valley c.150 BC.[53] Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin diverted the waters of the Dal Lake into the Mar canal which he extended up to Shadipur where it emptied itself at the confluence of Jhelum and Indus.[54] Owing to these irrigation works, and reclamation of large areas for cultivation, Kashmir became self-sufficient in rice production.[54] The natives considered the hot water at Dewsur sacred, and said that when one wished to know if any undertaking will prosper, they must take an earthen vessel, fill it with rice, and having secured the mouth, so that water may be excluded, throw it into the holy font. If on coming up the rice was boiled, it was deemed a fortunate omen, but unpropitious if otherwise.[55]\n\nPilau, yellow pilau, black pilau, shola pilau etc.[56]\n\nBikabatta, a dish consisting of rice, goat's fat and water.[57]\n\nRice mixed with sugar and sugarcane.[58]\n\nBread, it was not custom to eat naan/tsoet until early 17th century.[59]\n\nMilk, of cows and probably of buffaloes was consumed.[51][58]\n\nButter.[60]\n\nStrawberries, which could vie with the best in England.[61][62]\n\nYellow raspberries.[62]\n\nMusk-Melons, by the permission of Akbar, the crop was imported from Kashmir in the later season.[63]\n\nGuavas, of Kashmir were considered to be 'middling' by Jahangir.[59]\n\nPeaches, ripened in July.[62]\n\nOther diverse fruits,[64] (apple, crabapple,[65] pear, peach, apricot, cherry, mulberry,[66][67] melon, water melon,[68] greengage, gooseberry, currants, raspberry, sour cherry[69]).\n\nDiverse vegetables, (red beet, water parsnips, radishes)[68]\n\nRhubarb (pambahak), grew on the mountains surrounding Kashmir.[70] Both Hindus and Muslims were fond of the stalks.[70]\n\nTurnips, The turnips (gogjee) of Haripur were said to be the best in the valley.[71]\n\nCarrots. The carrots (gazar) were eaten by the Muslim inhabitants but not by the Hindus.[72]\n\nNew potatoes.[62]\n\nLeeks. Leeks (gaudapraan) were not eaten by the Hindus of the valley.[72]\n\nArtichokes.[62]\n\nAsparagus, in great stalks.[62]\n\nLettuce.[62]\n\nTomatoes, scarlet in colour.[62]\n\nDimb. A vegetable found only in the Dal and Anchar lakes in Kashmir.[73]\n\nRaw Flesh, there was an animal sacrifice in connection with the marriage ceremony.[74][53]\n\nRam. Meat (mesa) was generally fried and sometimes highly spiced.[58] The mutton of Nandipur was said to be the finest of Kashmir.[75]\n\nMeat cooked in yoghurt.[76]\n\nDucks[61]\n\nPigeons.[77]\n\nBeef, Kashmiri mystic Nund Reshi or Sheikh Noor ud-Din Wali expressed his disdain for a preacher who ate beef (moshi) and then complained it was the ogre's greed in one of his shruks.[78][79] Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din Zain-ul-Abidin had banned cow slaughter in the state in deference to the religious sentiment of his Hindu subjects.[80]\n\nHorse meat, was taken with relish in Kashmir.[81]\n\nPork, domestic pigs (gramya sukara) were eaten in Kashmir without any adverse notice in the 11th century AD.[58] The fragmentary jaw of a pig was found at the trial excavations at Burzahom.[30]\n\nPoultry, the valley of Lolab was famous for the best quality of poultry.[82] The practice of capon was known to the Kashmiris.[83]\n\nChicken Soup (shurba literally meaning saltish water, ba is the reverse of aab meaning water).[84]\n\nOther edible birds.[58]\n\nDog's flesh, cooked by people of Dom origin.[85]\n\nHandu sheep, delicate and sweet in flavour and wholesome.[60]\n\nStags, chased down the Wular lake.[86]\n\nCaul fat, oblations of animal fat were offered in the sacrificial fire in place of ghee (clarified butter) in other parts of India.[53]\n\nCarp, mentioned in the Samaya Matrika of Ksemendra.[87]\n\nFish Soup, eaten to keep up aphrodisiacal vigour by men addicted to women.[88]\n\nTrout[61]\n\nDanube Salmon.[61]\n\nFowls (kukkuta).[61][58] A favourite dish of the Kashmiris was to cook fowl and aubergines together.[91]\n\nHoney.[74]\n\nBoiled Eggs, the eggs were brought from Gilgit and Little Tibet (Ladakh) where they were procured in greater abundance.[63][92]\n\nPircham, an omelette-like preparation.[93]\n\nMasura, a sort of lentil.[94]\n\nSamudga, moong dal. Feeding only on rice and samudga was known to be miserly.[95]\n\nOther Pulses (including Peas and Broad Beans[61]).[74]\n\nParpata or papara, modern papad.[58] Another kind of food made from pulses.[58]\n\nKsira (kheer), rice boiled in milk.[74]\n\nMachhama, a dish eaten by the Kashmiris consisting of rice, vegetables, raisins, colouring matter and sugar.[96]\n\nWalnuts, which were eaten during famine as shali rice became dear.[97]\n\nPistachios.[98]\n\nSugar-cane.,[74] the country around Martand was planted with the crop.[99]\n\nGrapes, grown only in Kashmir in India, according to Hiuen Tsang and which were rare even in Heaven, according to Kalhana.[65][74][100] The Persian writer Abul Fazl considered them to be in plenty, but the finer qualities were rare.[101] Walter R. Lawrence praised the white and red grapes of the state vineyard at Raipur.[101] Of the foreign varieties, husaini and fakhri varieties were from Khorasan, supposed to be the best in Persia.[56][102]\n\nUnripe grapes (kur), the Kashmiris made excellent vinegar of it.[103]\n\nGarlic, several Brahmanas who used to eat it were expelled, according to Kalhana.[104] Both garlic and onion were considered as aphrodisiacs in ancient Kashmir.[87]\n\nPomegranates, already in abundance in the late part of 19th century.[74][62]\n\nHoly Basil.[74]\n\nSalt, a precious article and according to Ksemendra, consumed by the rich alone.[74][58] Two varieties were found in the bazaars of Kashmir: rock salt from the Punjab, and powder salt, called bota nun from Ladakh.[105]\n\nSaffron, historians suggest Persian saffron corms were transplanted to Kashmiri soil after Persia conquered Kashmir. The first harvest occurred sometime prior to 500 BC.[74] Hiuen Tsang, a Chinese traveller in his Travels in India (631 AD) says that saffron flowers were long used to adorn the neck of oxen at the autumn festival in the country of Kashmir.[106] Reference has been made of Kashmiri saffron in the Ratnavali of Harsha.[107] Buddhist tradition claims Mādhyandina, a disciple or companion of the Buddha’s disciple Ānanda, introduced the saffron crocus in Kashmir.[53] Kashmiri poet Bilhana in his Vikramanka Charitam says that the cultivation of saffron flowers in Kashmir originated from Takshaka Naga, a holy spring.[106] A popular myth talks about how when a naga chieftain (a water god) fell sick with an eye complaint, he was cured by the vaidya of Padmapur (Pampore).[106] In gratitude, the naga gave him a bulb of saffron and thus the locals began the cultivation.[106] Ksemendra mentioned that traders used to earn a lot through trade in saffron, in his 11th century satire Samayamatrka.[108] In the Kaula tradition, a ceremony was performed with saffron for warriors.[109] The Persian historian Firishta (1612) mentions that the saffron of Kashmir was particularly good.[110] At the time of Jehangir (1605–27), the annual crop was 18.5 tonnes, more than anywhere in the world.[111]\n\nClarified Butter, lamps were prepared with ghee.[74][112] It was sold by itinerant sellers who went from door to door.[87]\n\nOil.[74] Wooden oil presses constructed more than 200 years ago have been operating in Kashmir.[113] Till the mid-1940s there were sixteen oil mills operating in Srinagar.[114] Large quantities of dried apricots called Bote Chire were imported to Kashmir from Ladakh in the bygone days, and oil was pressed from their kernels at Kashmiri oil presses.[114] The rapeseed oil was considered best for eating while walnut and almond oil were also used.[114] In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the cultivation of mustard plants grew considerably in Kashmir, and the use of walnut oil fell considerably.[114]\n\nGold Dust.[115]\n\nCurd.[74]\n\nHalf ripe Barley.[74]\n\nBread (apupa) and cake (pistaka) made from barley.[58] A particular day of the year was observed as a festival, when barely became ripe in the fields.[58]\n\nSpring Water, of Kokar Nag was said to appease hunger and renew appetite.[116] A fountain in the neighbourhood of Achh Bal was scarcely equalled for its coldness, limpidity and refreshing qualities.[117] Malakhnag in Anantnag was cherished for its mineral-rich waters.[118]\n\nTea, came to Kashmir by caravans across Chinese Tartary and Tibet.[119]\n\nBeer.[69] For Kashmiri polymath Abhinavagupta, alcohol was the external essence of Shiva.[120] Without alcohol, there was neither enjoyment nor liberation.[120] The use of drink is admitted during the sautramani sacrifice of the brahmans, during a great battle in case of warriors, during farming in case of peasants, at great family celebrations, at the birth of a son, on the occasion of marriage or gathering of friends, and at the conclusion of the cremation ritual in case of slaves.[121] For his commentator Jayaratha, the practitioner should drink because of a sort of bhairavic greatness, but not like a bonded animal, because of greed.[122] The finest drink is on every occasion, the drink of average value is at the junctures, the worst is only once a month, and beyond a month he becomes a bonded animal.[109] Hops, too, grew in Kashmir and factories were close by in which raw produce was transferred into excellent liquids.[62]\n\nWheat Beer.[123]\n\nMead.[123]\n\nRum, from treacle.[123]\n\nWine, called mas in Kashmiri language.[59] Kashmir was the only part of India where wine was made from the juice of the grape, a fact to be attributed rather to its acescent quality, than to any scarcity of fruit.[124] A wine culture inflected by Hellenism thrived in Kashmir in the early centuries AD.[102] At the beaded ring of a statue of goddess Lakshmi in a distinctively Gandharan style discovered by Frenchman Albert Foucher near the village of Brar in Bandipora in 1896, one can see clusters and foliage of vines.[125] In the Mulasarvastivada vinaya, a Buddhist text from the first half of the 2nd century AD, some monks travel in the Northwest and a yakṣa presents them with some grapes, which are said to be from Kashmir and apparently a great novelty.[102] The Buddha explains that they can be eaten after purifying them with a burning ember, and that people can also make juice/syrup from them.[102] For Abhinavagupta, alcohol which came from grape was splendour to a supreme degree.[123] He praised the wine of his native Kashmir as mahabhairava (the mercurial essence).[120] Jayaratha cautions against mixing it with any other ingredient, for the reason that its effectiveness would be quite limited.[126] Lalitaditya was so intoxicated with wine he told his ministers that if they wished to increase the beauty of his city, they should burn Pravarapura, the city built by king Sri Pravarasena of the Alchon Huns and his orders could not be disobeyed.[127][22] There are many references which show that making and drinking wine was not prohibited during the early Sultanate period even though it was strongly disapproved of by the orthodox section of the society.[101] It was a common sight to see laymen and Brahman priests alike in a state of drunkenness during Hindu festivals.[101] Despite the Islamic ban on alcohol, the Muslims, who participated in these festivals, also freely partook of wine.[101] Zainul Abidin took it in moderation, but Haider Shah was a confirmed drunkard.[101] Sikandar Butshikan, or the destroyer of idols (c.1416) prohibited vending wine in Kashmir.[128] During the Sikh and Dogra periods, thousands of acres were covered with vines in full bearing.[101] The indigenous vines were generally planted at the foot of poplar and ran up to the height of fifty or sixty feet, bearing an abundance of fruit.[101] After harvesting grapes in October, they were kept in shallow earthen vessels till spring, then they were applied to the fabrication of wine, vinegar and brandy.[101] In 1815, the early wine writer André Jullien compared Kashmiri wine to madeira.[102] Maharaja Ranbir Singh introduced vines from Bordeaux in France and Marion Doughty, a woman who visited Kashmir in 1900 wrote that the Medoc and Barsac were both strengthening and pleasant to taste.[129] Anguri and qandi were the cherished drinks of singers.[101]\n\nMaireya Wine, a spicy wine perfumed by camphor,[130] and made out of fruits and flowers with a natural sugar base.[131]\n\nAsava Wine, decocted extracts or cold infusion extracts of different herbs fermented with flowers of dhataki (woodfordia fruticosa).[132][133]\n\nNew Wine.[74] The Hindus pressed the juice of the grape, strained it, placed it in the sun for four or five days and then drank it.[134]\n\nSweet wine, like Madeira.[67] It would be found to improve greatly in quality with age.[124]\n\nFruit wine (madapan), made out of pears, apples or mulberry.[96]\n\nBrandy, distilled from wine.[135]\n\nVinegar, Kashmiris made various pickles with it, the best of which was garlic, according to Jehangir.[59]\n\nFlour cakes, fine flour could become expensive.[74][136]\n\nSpirit from Grapes,[67] liquor (mrdvika) was drunk with incantation and blessing.[137][138]\n\nSpirit from Datura (Thorn-Apple).[87]\n\nSesame.[74] Oil was extracted from it.[87]\n\nGinger.,[74] Jonaraja compares his words (as meagre) to water in dried ginger.[139]\n\nCoarse sugar.[74]\n\nMeat cakes.[74]\n\nFish.[74]\n\nDried food.[74]\n\nIra-flowers(drink).[74]\n\nGreen vegetables[74]\n\nIngredients and seasoning\n\n[edit]\n\nMeat\n\n[edit]\n\nApart from chicken, fish and game, Kashmiris use only mutton (meat of mature sheep) or goat's meat.[12] More than 75% of sheep population are cross breeds and are generally called Kashmir Merino that provides the dual purpose of meat and wool.[140] The Bakkarwal (nomadic herders) goats belong to the rare Kaghani breed, prized as one of the world's best in terms of meat.[141]\n\nBeef is consumed in towns and villages of Kashmir more so for its affordability.[142] In some villages, beef-eaters are huddled separately from those supposed to be served mutton during wazwan feasts.[143] There is a class divide between people who eat kat maaz (mutton) considered elite and more sophisticated, and those who eat bad maaz (beef), considered lower-class.[143] The biggest rabbit breeding farm in North India sprawls on six hectares of land in Wussan village of Baramulla district of Kashmir.[144] The consumption of rabbit meat as a substitute for sheep and goat meat among the general masses is becoming popular.[144] People with cardiac problems eat rabbits as the meat is considered lean and white with high nutritious value.[144]\n\nThe local geese of Kashmir (Kashmir Aenz) is the first and only recognized domestic geese breed in India.[145] Geese rearing in the Valley dates back to ancient time as has been mentioned by Sir Walter R. Lawrence in his book 'The Valley of Kashmir'.[145] In Srinagar, geese are mainly sold in Batmaloo and Lal Chowk, by vendors, who purchase geese from rearers in villages and sell them live or slaughtered in the city.[145] In affluent families, geese pickles would also be made and kept aside for winter use.[146]\n\nFish\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Duke of Bedford helped to send 10,000 trout eggs from the UK in 1899 but they perished on the way.[147] A second consignment arrived from Scotland the next year.[147] The rainbow and brown trout adapted well to the Kashmir valley, while the indigenous snow trout continues to flourish.[147] Locally known as alegaad, it can be found in both standing and flowing water bodies throughout the valley.[148] There were 137 private fish farms in just Anantnag district, which was declared as the 'Trout District of India'.[149]\n\nEggs\n\n[edit]\n\nPoultry farms are set on European standards, as Kashmir has similar geo-climatic conditions.[150] Using permaculture and no-dig gardening technique, free-range eggs are being sold every day.[151] People collect chick varieties like Kalinga brown, Vanraja, Kashmir Commercial Layer, etc. to dish out a regular supply of organic brown eggs.[152] The Kashmir Duck (batook) is reared for its eggs in all districts of the valley with highest population in Bandipora district, followed by Kupwara, Barmulla, Srinagar and others.[153] Eggs of Kashmir duck are either white or green-shelled and weigh 66.20 g on average.[153]\n\nKalij pheasant (wan kokur) lays between 6 and 10 eggs per clutch, and are perfect served soft-boiled in their olive-green shells with a mere sprinkle of celery salt and buttered soldiers.[154]\n\nCereals\n\n[edit]\n\nPeople in Kashmir eat different varieties of rice including the nutty and fragrant Mushk Budji, grown in the higher reaches of the Kashmir valley.[155] In February 2022, Mushk Budji rice got the Geographical Indication (GI) tag.[156] This cooked rice is unique and possesses a harmonious blend of taste, aroma and rich organoleptic properties.[156] Kashmiri red rice, locally called Zaag Batt, is grown in a small village called Tangdhar on the border with Pakistan.[157] The small unpolished grains are sought for their superior texture and taste.[157] In 2009, farmers in the region harvested the legendary Basmati rice for the first time.[158]\n\nVegetables\n\n[edit]\n\nThe most important and frequently used Kashmiri vegetables are: haakh (collard greens or kale), monj Haak ( kohlrabi), tsochael(mallow), bamchoont (quince), kral mound (shepherds purse), saze posh (holly hock), nadur (lotus stem), praan (shallots), aubuj (sorrel), mawal (cockscomb), wushkofur (camphor), tila gogul (mustard) and gor (water-chestnut).[159] The floating vegetable garden on the Dal Lake is the second largest wholesale market in the world.[160] Men, young and old, on their wooden boats, argue about the price of plump pumpkins and gourds as they share cigarettes or hookahs.[161] The water of Kashmir is sweeter, and that affects the taste and flavour of vegetables.[11] The items for sale include tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, turnips, water chestnuts, leafy vegetables, and the famous nadur.[160] A porous and fibrous lake vegetable, nadur has grown to become an irreplaceable ingredient in a traditional Kashmiri kitchen.[162] Local accounts date its discovery to the 15th-century sultan Zain-ul-Abidin, who was introduced to the chewy delicacy while on a shikara ride on the Gil Sar lake located in the exteriors of Srinagar.[162] Also, according to a popular legend, the yarn threads that Lalla Ded (1320–1392), the Kashmiri mystic saint wove were thrown into the Dal Lake when her tyrant mother-in-law ridiculed and taunted her for yarning it too thin. These got changed into the fibres of nadur for eternity.[163]\n\nSun-dried vegetables, locally known as hokh syun, are consumed as fresh produce dwindles.[164] During summer, vegetables are peeled, chopped, salted and sun-dried to preserve them for winter.[164] The various varieties of hokh syun include dried tomatoes (ruwangun haech), dried fenugreek leaves (meeth), dried lotus stem (nadir haech), dried Iberian knapweed (kretch), dried shallot leaves (praan), dried mint (pudna), dried bottle gourd (al haech), dried turnip slices (gogji haech), dried quince (bamchount haech), dried collard greens (hoech haak) and dried spinach (hoech palak).[164][165][166] In the Charar Sharief area of central Kashmir, dried pears, locally known as tang haech are considered a delicacy.[164]\n\nShallots, known as praan, stand out, lending its unique flavour to a multitude of Kashmiri dishes, from soups and stews, to curries and kebabs.[167] Many of Mughal Emperor Akbar's feasts in the 16th century featured shallots.[167] Buthoo village has earned renown for producing prized organic shallots.[167] Snow Mountain garlic, also known as Kashmiri garlic, is a rare single-clove variety of Allium sativum. The clove beneath is bright white to creamy-white color and offers a strong, pungent garlic flavour without the acidity present in other varieties.[168]\n\nKashmir valley is the only place in India where asparagus grows.[169] Until the 1960s, it was grown widely in Kashmir at Pulwama, Budgam, Rajbagh, Tangmarg and Gulmarg. As of now the area of asparagus cultivation is restricted to Tangmarg and Gulmarg.[169]\n\nSugar and sweeteners\n\n[edit]\n\nSugarcane does not grow in Kashmir.[170] Sugar was exclusively imported from erstwhile united Punjab up to 1947 but was among the costliest imports to Kashmir.[170] The then Dogra government suggested cultivating sugar maple and beetroot sugar but it could not materialise.[170] In the past, when sugar was not imported, people used honey.[170] Delicate nectar of the acacia flowers makes for honey in Tral, Verinag and other locations.[171] Sidr honey considered one of the most distinguished types of honey in the world, is obtained from Sidr (jujube) trees in the Kashmir Valley.[172]\n\nFruits\n\n[edit]\n\nKashmiri apple is famous for its juiciness and distinct flavour as well.[173] In 2019 alone, Kashmir produced over 1.9 million metric tonnes of apples, the highest among Indian states.[173] Further, Kashmir accounts for 90% of India's walnut production.[174] Kashmiri walnuts are a great source of nutrients and widely in demand across the globe.[174] Giant walnut trees can scale 75 feet in Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir.[175] Many years ago, walnut oil used to be a medium of cooking and imparted a sweeter and nuttier flavour to dishes.[176]\n\nMuhammad Quli Afshar brought cherries from Kabul and planted them during Akbar's time.[59] Mishri variety of cherry is famous in Kashmir and sweeter than other varieties.[177] They are loaded with minerals, vitamins and plant compounds.[177] The exotic berries from Kashmir are sweet and sour mulberry (tuell and shah-tuell), raspberry (chhanchh), barberry (kaawducchh) and red berry (haapat maewaa).[178] Gassu area on the Srinagar outskirts is known for strawberry (istaber) harvesting.[179]\n\nOrange cultivation for commercial purposes was introduced a few decades before in the Urossa village in Uri.[180] The climate and soil is relatively warmer than the rest of Kashmir and conducive for the crop.[180] In this mountainous region, the micro-climate is good for Mediterranean crops like lemons and olives.[181] The lemons are better and juicier than Punjab lemons.[181] A sub-species of wild olives that doesn't bear much fruit but grows even in hardy, rough conditions is used for grafting with fruit varieties, producing about 1,000 litres of extra virgin olive oil each year.[181]\n\nAccroding to official estimates, Kashmiri grapes are cultivated on almost 500 to 600 hectares of land with production up to 1100 to 1500 MT per year.[182]\n\nDairy products\n\n[edit]\n\nHolstein Friesian (HF) and Jersey cows were introduced in Kashmir several decades ago, producing 4 million litres of milk per day.[183][184] Organic Kashmiri butter wrapped in Chinar leaves was common in the yesteryears, but is now sold only by a few.[185] A traditionally ripened Himalayan cheese is called the milk chapati or maish krej in Kashmiri.[186]\n\nSpices\n\n[edit]\n\nKashmiri saffron is known for its aroma, colour, and medicinal value.[187] The saffron of Pampore town is considered to be of superior quality with 8.72% crocin content as compared to the Iranian variety which contains 6.82%.[187] In May 2020, Kashmiri saffron was given a geographical indication tag.[187] The spice shahi zeera or imperial cumin or black cumin belongs to Apiaceae (parsley) family and was initially available in the jungles of Gurez Valley.[188] These darker seeds unlike the regular brown zeera are of superior quality because of their smell, relative rarity and shape.[188]\n\nAmong the spices used:\n\nKashmiri chilli pepper (martswangun) — chilies are grown locally in Kashmir.[189] When they turn red, they are dried and ground into powder form.[189] Powdered red chilies are moderately hot coloring agents that are used for most meat and some vegetarian dishes.[189] The taste varies with the region they are being cultivated, from areas such as Bugam, Tangmarg, Bandipora, Dangerpora, Anantnag and Noorbagh.[190] Chillies of Bugam are the most bitter in taste, while Noorbagh chillies have less seeds and are spicier than the ones grown in other areas.[190] The local government has sought a geographical indication tag for chillies cultivated in Srinagar and Budgam districts.[191]\n\nShimla, Punjabi & Pepsi chilli pepper (martswangun) — Shimla variety is used for making spicy qormas, while Pepsi is usually imported from Rajasthan in India, and resembles a Pepsi bottle.[190]\n\nasafoetida (yangu) — used in much of Kashmiri Pandit cuisine, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian.[192] Red asafoetida, is considered superior due to its rich aroma and unique flavor and used in special Kashmiri recipes often in its pure, unadulterated form.[193] Kashmiri Poet Agha Shahid Ali was a connoisseur when it came to this spice, and was known to emerge from behind the clouds of yangu in his Brooklyn apartment.[194]\n\ncardamom (nich auleh)

consumption is quite old in Kashmir.[202] It was and is still being imported from Khewrah area of Pakistani Punjab, where it was first discovered by the troops of Alexander the Great in 326 B.C.[202] Pre-independence, rock salt was imported via Mughal Road, which, before the advent of Mughals, was called Namak Route.[202] After partition, its supply was barred.[202] Because of its benefits, it is now being consumed by almost one-fourth of the population.[202]\n\nSpecialties by season\n\n[edit]\n\nSpring is often considered a season of rejuvenation after a long and harsh winter.[203] Picnics, of which the Kashmiris are very fond, are planned around the theme of food.[204] The countryside is awash with white and pink flowers of almond (badaam), peach (tsunun) and cherry (gilaas) blossoms.[205] The mustard fields join the show with their bright-yellow blooms.[205] The pear (tang) blossoms can be identified by their thick cluster of flowers.[205] Apricot (Tser) blossoms are white in colour, often tinged with a pink or reddish hue.[205] They grow from late spring through early summer.[203] Beans are a spring vegetable.[203] Cherries are a fruit of late spring and summer.[203] Coriander (danival) is a cool herb whose season predominates between spring and summer in cooler areas.[203] Garlic (rohan) is found mainly in spring and through fall season.[203] Melons (kharbooz) are a fruit grown in spring and summer.[203] Tender spring-time haakh (collard greens) are called kaanul.[206]\n\nThe season of harvesting lotus stem (nadur) starts in September.[207] The samovar bubbles in a corner, spreading the sweet fragrance of saffron and cardamom in the air.[208] Cookie-shaped kandi kulchas made of flour, butter, sugar and sprinkled with poppy seeds are passed around to be dipped into the tea and relished.[208] Men fish under the shade of the chinar tree in Dalgate area.[209] Dandelion leaves, also known as haand in Kashmir, are foraged on foot.[208] Going to the countryside, one can see paddy being cut with sickles and then stacked in huge piles to dry.[210] Chestnuts are roasted in the dying embers.[211] Bulbous garlic and red potatoes jostle for space.[208] Saffron fields in full bloom greet you in Pampore, a part of Pulwama district.[210] Going towards the hilly areas one can see the maize and walnut trees with their fruit getting ready to be harvested.[210] Going towards the apple producing areas of Sopore in North Kashmir or Shopian in South Kashmir, one can see cartons of apple being transported to various parts of the country.[210]\n\nDuring the long winters the days are short, sunlight and electricity in short supply, so there is not much that can liven up existence except interesting food, so it constitutes a major interest of the Kashmiris' lives.[204] On window sills and terraces, one can spot small piles of aubergines, cherry tomatoes, gourds and turnips being sun-dried.[208] There is ample time and the daan (Kashmiri traditional stove) with its twin stoves (Chaer in Kashmiri) ignited by fire wood placed in one inlet) is always ready to oblige long hours of cooking despite the shortages of electricity.[212] When all village roads remained blocked due to heavy snowfall and villagers have to use oil lamps or kerosene lanterns, the entire family is called to the kitchen where flavour of the overnight shab deg fills the entire space.[213] Kohlrabi (monje) is cold tolerant, and continues to grow on the fields in winter, so much that a little frost even helps it.[214]\n\nList of dishes\n\n[edit]\n\nSome noted Kashmiri dishes include:\n\nBarbecue\n\n[edit]\n\nOne version of the origin of kababs is the one in which Turkish soldiers were first known to grill chunks of meat on open fires.[215] Kashmir's kababs are cooked with local spices and accompanied with dips:[215]\n\nKabab, condimented minced meat, roasted or fried, on skewers.[12] According to chef Ghulam Nabi Dar (aka Bitte Waaze), the meat for the kabab is first minced with a very sharp knife (haché au couteau), then it requires an egg, cumin, cardamom and garlic, then it needs to be minced some more until it

Made by specialised cooks called harisaguyr, Harisa is a popular meat preparation made for breakfast, it is slow cooked with spices in a special underground oven for a 24-hour period and hand stirred.[236][212] A good harisa entails a meticulous mincing of deboned mutton, mixed with local rice, fennel seeds, cinnamon, cardamom and salt.[235] Cooked on sim fire for at least 6 to 8 hours, boiling smoky mustard oil and some milk is poured while the wooden masher continues to stir.[212] Small kebabs are made to be served along with and also a small serving of Methi (lamb’s intestines cooked in fenugreek) and tempered onion rings.[212] The dish is so tasty that one 18th century Afghan governor, who came here during the Afghan Rule, is believed to have over-eaten himself to death.[237]\n\nHarisa zafrani, sprinkled with Kashmiri saffron.

It is popular throughout the larger Kashmir region. Moreover, Wazwan is also served internationally at Kashmiri food festivals and reunions.[473]\n\nBeverages\n\n[edit]\n\nNoon Chai or Sheer Chai\n\n[edit]\n\nKashmiris are heavy tea drinkers. Kashmiris don't use the word \"Kashmiri Chai\". The word \"Noon\" in Kashmiri means salt. The most popular drink is a pinkish colored salted tea called \"noon chai.\"[474] It is made with black tea, milk, salt and bicarbonate of soda. The particular color of the tea is a result of its unique method of preparation and the addition of soda. The Kashmiri Hindus more commonly refer to this chai as \"Sheer Chai.\" The Kashmiri Muslims refer to it as \"Noon Chai\" or \"Namkeen Chai\", both meaning salty tea.\n\nNoon Chai or Sheer Chai is a common breakfast tea in Kashmiri households and is taken with breads like baqerkhani brought fresh from Qandur (Kashmiri : کاندر ) or bakers. It is one of the most basic and essential food items in a Kashmiri household. Tea was as served in large samavars. Now, the use of Samavars is limited to special occasions and normally kettles are used.\n\nNuts like almonds and pistachios and edible rose petals can also be added before serving and sometimes malai or fresh cream is added to give the tea viscosity and richness.[475]\n\nNatural mineral water\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to a 2022 study by the University of Kashmir, 87% of springs in Kashmir valley have excellent to good water quality.[476] A large part of the society, particularly those living in rural and backward areas, depends on spring water.[476] Most villagers believe spring water is the purest form of water due to a spiritual connection with the shrines.[476]\n\nFrom one of the oldest and purest spring waters of Kashmir, the Kokernag Spring, Bringi Spring Water has high alkalinity and is well balanced with minerals.[477]\n\nBabribyol\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Babribyol sharbat is a concoction of sweetened milk, rose water or Rooh Afza syrup, and soaked sweet basil seeds that are grown locally.[478]\n\nLyaess\n\n[edit]\n\nMade from yoghurt or kefir, Kashmiri lassi (lyaess) is a liquid, salty way to drink up yoghurt.[479] The process of churning the buttermilk with a wooden choomph or churner is rhythmic and there is an art involved.[479] The yoghurt has to be churned the right way, the buttery fats have to float to the top in a nice froth, the spices and dried mint leaves have to be just right.[479]\n\nSadr-e-kaenz\n\n[edit]\n\nThis fermented rice water drink is supposed to be very good for a sluggish liver.[480]\n\nShahi Sheera\n\n[edit]\n\nMade by extracting the juice of different berries, it is prepared at home during Ramadan.[481] It features in 1977 Kashmiri film Arnimaal where guests are sipping on the beverage during wedding festivities.[481]\n\nFood and beverage pairings\n\n[edit]\n\nThe traditional Kashmiri wazwan, which comprises slow-cooked meat dishes is a wonderful pairing that enhances the spicy notes of whisky.[482] The Loire Valley wine Sancerre goes well with Kashmiri goshtabeh.[483] A ripe fruity red works well with the full bodied roghan josh.[484] A recommended wine to try with is Montepulciano.[485]\n\nSpecial occasions and festivals\n\n[edit]\n\nEid-ul-Fitr\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile on fast, Muslims avoid consuming food during the day, while at dusk, they indulge in extra-special, bountiful meals prepared during the day.[486] The menu for Ramadan month includes khajur ka laddoo (date balls), babribyol (basil seeds), kulfi, phirin, seemni, fruit chaat, fruit custard, kateer (a drink loaded with health benefits) and noon chai.[486] The smell of slow-cooked mutton hovers, fragrant and sultry in the air, and despite the familiar air of unpredictability in Srinagar, spirits are high and streets are filled with happy greetings of Eid Mubarak.[217]\n\nEid-ul-Adha\n\n[edit]\n\nThe day begins with the Fajr (dawn) prayer and a breakfast of bakery goods with dodh kehwa (milky green tea).[487] As the festival draws to a close, most well-to-do families start placing orders with the wazas for the feast, which is cooked by chefs at their own places and then sold to the customers for serving at their homes.[488] Sacrificial animals include Delhi Walla, Merino Cross, Bakerwal and Kashmiri varieties of sheep.[489]\n\nUrs of Hazrat Sheikh Dawood\n\n[edit]\n\nOnly vegetarian food is supplied to devotees.[490] Majority of people in Batmaloo and adjoining areas turn vegetarian and do not eat meat or chicken.[490] They widely consume dried turnips (gogji aare) because it is believed, during Dawood's time, sundried turnips helped Kashmir survive a famine.[491]\n\nUrs of Khwaja Masood Wali\n\n[edit]\n\nThe people of Pampore cook dried vegetables, eggs, cheese and other food stuff except meat and invite their relatives, friends on lunch or dinner to keep the tradition of the saint alive.\n\nUrs of Dastageer Sahab\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Khanyar and Sarai Bala areas of Srinagar, the devotees are seen outside the shrines where local and non-local business establishments install their carts and are seen selling the Kashmiri traditional food stuff. Pious men sing hearty hymns over offerings of dates and sweets.[492]\n\nUrs of Raeshmol Saheb\n\n[edit]\n\nPeople in Anantnag district in southern Kashmir quit eating meat as a mark of respect for the 16th century mystic.[493] Rarely is a butcher shop open during these seven days.[493] For three-and-a-half days each before and after the saint's Urs, people eat radish braised in tamarind.[494]\n\nHerath\n\n[edit]\n\nFor Kashmiri Pandits, the prasad offering at Shivratri puja is a charger piled high with rice, cooked lamb and fish, and a luscious raw fish in its entirety atop the pile.[495]\n\nHar Navum\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the 9th day of the month of ashad, Pandits in Kashmir offer the deity Sharika yellow rice cooked with turmeric, a little oil and salt along with tsarvan (goat's liver).[496]\n\nNavreh\n\n[edit]\n\nThe festival of Navreh, the Kashmiri New Year, is incomplete without nadur.[497] A celebration often confused with the Nowruz of the Persians and Persianate cultures, Navreh is the welcoming of spring in the Northern hemisphere, and its date fluctuate, but always around to the March equinox.[497]\n\nDiaspora and fusion cuisines\n\n[edit]\n\nTibetan exiles in Kashmir, including members of Tibet's small Muslim population live in Srinagar, mainly in a small area near the 18th-century Hari Parbat fort.[498] Popular momo (beef dumplings) shops and Tibetan restaurants are run by their children.[498] Tibetan options include Cantonese chicken and kumloo wonton, fried pasta stuffed with minced mushrooms.[498]\n\nKashmiri Sikh cuisine has a bit of influence from Punjab with onions and tomatoes, but the flavouring goes the Kashmiri way with elements such as badyaan (saunf).[499] A large number of Indian tourists depend entirely on Vaishno Dhabas, the Valley's generic non-A/C restaurants that serve all-vegetarian North Indian fare.[500]\n\nCooking methods\n\n[edit]\n\nSome Kashmiri cooking techniques are:\n\nBlanching\n\n[edit]\n\nThe stalks of dandelion (haand) with their spiky-edged leaves have to blanched four times so that they bear no bitterness.[175]\n\nConvection\n\n[edit]\n\nThe traditional Kashmir food receives heat on two sides, top and bottom and the best results are obtained by slow heat using charcoal.[3]\n\nBraising\n\n[edit]\n\nThe leaves of Kashmiri haakh are braised in lots of water.[501] It is very important to ensure that the haakh stays submerged underwater during the initial cooking process using a wooden spatula or large spoon to continuously push the greens down.[501] Mustard oil, which is used extensively in Kashmiri cuisine, imparts an extra flavour to the dish.[501]\n\nCourt-bouillon\n\n[edit]\n\nMuch of Kashmiri cooking relies on a fragrant meat stock.[4] The main skill of a wazwan lies in the preparation of this stock made of onions and shallots.[12] Freshly shaped meatballs (rista and goshtabeh) are poached in this lamb stock flavoured with cinnamon and black cardamom, and simmered.[502]\n\nTempering\n\n[edit]\n\nWhole spices must be fried in oil – clove, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves.[503] Fried too little, and the dish will be lifeless, without fragrance.[503] A second too much, and one will be left with nothing but bitterness.[503] Hot ghee or mustard oil is poured on top and garnished with fried praan (shallots) paste & saffron extract.[502]\n\nCaramelisation\n\n[edit]\n\nSliced onions are fried until golden brown and pureed with minimal water.[504]\n\nEmulsification\n\n[edit]\n\nThe yoghurt must be fatty, thick.[503] Dried mint, just a pinch, is added right at the end to freshen the dish.[503]\n\nFood colouring\n\n[edit]\n\nRelevant dishes are further enhanced in colour by saffron extract (rogan josh and rista) or mawal (dried cockscomb flower).[502] Kashmiri chilli is also added in excess sometimes to produce a red colour.[4] Tomato is incorrectly used as a substitute when mawal and rattanjot are not available.[4] No authentic version cooked in Kashmir has tomatoes.[4]\n\nSimmering\n\n[edit]\n\nThe food gets its flavours and textures from the spices being slow cooked with ingredients until they let out their inherent juices and fats and melt together.[505]\n\nSmoke point\n\n[edit]\n\nSmoking mustard oil is a treatment known as durust, and gets it ready to use after cooling off.[502]\n\nDum cooking\n\n[edit]\n\nThe cooking vessel in the shab deg is sealed with dough before being cooked over a simmering fire through the long winter night.[506] Dum cooking was made popular by the Mughal courts around the 16th century.[507]\n\nTenderising\n\n[edit]\n\nGoshtabeh and rista, the two meatball dishes are rarely found outside the valley because their unique texture is enormously challenging.[505] The sheep has to be freshly slaughtered and the meat pounded before rigor mortis sets.[505] To incorporate air to make them light and fluffy, the meat undergoes a process of being folded whilst beaten.[502]\n\nCooking material\n\n[edit]\n\nThe quality of pots is important, according to wosta (ustad) or chef Nazir Ahmed Aram.[508] He says they must have the right content of copper. Using wood (walnut and apple are the best) is important too. Cooking on gas is not the same.\n\nSimilarities with other cuisines\n\n[edit]\n\nMuch like Kashmir, its people, and its narrative traditions, Kashmiri cuisine too is an amalgam of influences from Central Asia, Persia, China, and the Indian subcontinent.[509] Food recipes passed down from one culture to another are:\n\nAab Gosh (Kashmiri). Abgoosht or Abgusht is more so a one-pot Persian comfort food that is a rustic dish with wholesome ingredients.[510] It has been enjoyed by Persians for centuries.[510] There is a similar dish in Armenia, called Abgoosht stew, using beef instead of lamb.[511]\n\nBatta (Kashmiri). Short-grain, sticky rice is called bata in Afghanistan.[512]\n\nHarisa (Kashmiri). Al Harees is a traditional Emirati dish consisting of wheat, meat(chicken) and salt.[513] A simple, traditional Saudi dish using crushed wheat is called jareesh.[514] Harissa, also known as herisseh, harisa or keshkeg in Armenia is a wheat berry and meat porridge.[515] The wheat, usually known as korkot, is shelled making them quicker to cook.[515] In Oman, it is made with beaten rice instead of wheat.[516] Boko Boko Harees in Burundian cuisine is a delicacy prepared with chicken, turmeric and bulgur wheat.[517] Amritsari Hareesa is a famous dish of the winter season in Lahore, Pakistan and made with wheat and meat.[518] It is seasoned with desi ghee and served with hot naan.[518]\n\nKabab (Kashmiri). The Turkish word kebap derives from Arabic kabaab meaning roasted meat.[519] A likely East Semitic root means to burn, to char or to roast.[519] The Babylonian Talmud even teaches that offerings in the temple should not be kabbaba (burnt).[519] Kysaa-ı Yusuf was the first to refer to meat on skewers as a kebab in 1377.[520] Ibn Battuta, the famous Moroccan traveller mentioned that kebab was an integral part of the daily diet of Indian royalty as early as 1200 AD.[521] Some of the world's best and most flavorful kebabs such as Adana Kebab, Urfa kebab, Iskender kebab come from Turkey's southeastern provinces.[522] The Döner kebab was invented by İskender Efendi, who lived in Bursa and hung meats vertically to grill.[522] One of the most popular kabobs you can find on the streets of Iran is kabob koobideh, ground lamb or beef or a combination of the two.[523] The traditional method of cooking Afghan chapli kebab is frying.[524]\n\nKahwah (Kashmiri). A staple Afghan tea, kahwah is mild and fragrant, and recipes tend to differ from family to family.[525]\n\nKatlam (Kashmiri). Qatlama in traditional Turkish means folded which comes from the verb qatlamaq (to fold). Plain katmer is eaten with Turkish white cheese and Turkish tea.[526] In Turkmenistan, a type of bread in baked from flour which is mixed with milk and egg.[527] This is called katlama. It is also cooked in Azerbaijan, and various herbs are added to it.[528] The fried Kazakh bread Kattama is very popular in Central Asia.[529] Katama is an onion-filled swirled flatbread from Kyrgyzstan.[530] In Uzbekistan, katlama is a traditional bread of Sunday mornings served with homemade butter.[531] Qatlama is an Afghan fried sweet pastry topped with sugar or sugar syrups.[532] Qator Gambir or Gambir are Mongolian pancakes which may often be a byproduct, when there is leftover dough from making some other dish.[533] Kutluma is a layered Pakistani flatbread with a crispy, buttery texture.[534]\n\nKulcha (Kashmiri). In Afghanistan and Northeast Iran, these dried bread biscuits are called kulcha-e-khataye.[535] Koloocheh in Iranian cuisine is a cookie stuffed with cinnamon, sugar and crushed walnuts.[536]\n\nLavasa (Kashmiri). The word lavash is repeatedly found in early Turkic written sources.[537] Lavash is a Turkish bread made with flour, water and salt.[538] It can be eaten hot or cold.[538] This paper-thin, blanket-sized bread is one of Armenia's most ancient breads and is still being made today.[539] In Azerbaijan, lavash is baked not only in traditional ovens (tandir) but also in saj, a large convex pan under which fire is made.[537] In Azerbaijan and Iran, it is put on the bride's shoulders or crumbled over her head to wish the couple prosperity.[537]\n\nLuchi (Kashmiri). Very similar, Bengali luchai is a deep fried puffed bread.[540]\n\nNabad (Kashmiri). Nabat in Persian is a type of confectionary mineral composed of relatively large sugar crystals, with bits of saffron in it.[541]\n\nNadur (Kashmiri). In Afghan cuisine, Qormah e Nadroo is an onion-and-tomato-based stew using lamb meat or veal, yogurt, lotus roots and coriander.[542]\n\nPolav (Kashmiri). It looks as if pilaf was invented in Iran some time after the 10th century.[543] The Turks call plain rice sade pilav.[543] Turkey sees pilav primarily as a side dish rather than a main course.[543] Iran is famous for its polos made with aromatic domsiyah rice.[543] The most characteristic ones are based on fruits such as cherries, quinces, or apricots.[543] In Central Asia, the simplest recipe uses onions, meat and carrots.[543] The extravagant court traditions of the Moghul school of cookery makes India home to some very elaborate pulaos.[543] Laborers from western India brought pilaf to the Caribbean, where it is garnished with butter, almonds and pimiento-stuffed green olives.[543]\n\nRoth(Kashmiri). The Afghan version of the universal West Asian and European sweet egg bread is called rot.[512] In Afghanistan, it is traditionally served when a newborn child is forty days old.[512]\n\nSheer Chai (Kashmiri). Qaimak or Sheer chai is often served at celebrations in Afghanistan to toast good health.[544]\n\nYakhein (Kashmiri). Patates Yahni or Greek potato stew is a traditional Greek recipe"
