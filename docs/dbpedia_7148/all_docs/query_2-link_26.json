        "text": "Water is an essential element for survival. About seventy per cent of the human body consists of water while plants contain almost 90 per cent of water. Still, we have to depend on some outside sources to fulfil the water requirements of our body.\n\nSimilarly, crops require water for their growth and development. The process of supplying water to the crops is known as irrigation.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIrrigation\n\nTypes\n\nSurface Irrigation\n\nLocalized Irrigation\n\nSprinkler Irrigation\n\nDrip Irrigation\n\nCentre Pivot Irrigation\n\nSub Irrigation\n\nManual Irrigation\n\nMethods\n\nTraditional Methods\n\nModern Methods\n\nSprinkler System\n\nDrip System\n\nImportance\n\nWhat is Irrigation?\n\nIrrigation is the process of applying water to the crops artificially to fulfil their water requirements. Nutrients may also be provided to the crops through irrigation. The various sources of water for irrigation are wells, ponds, lakes, canals, tube-wells and even dams. Irrigation offers moisture required for growth and development, germination and other related functions.\n\nThe frequency, rate, amount and time of irrigation are different for different crops and also vary according to the types of soil and seasons. For example, summer crops require a higher amount of water as compared to winter crops.\n\nLet us have a look at different types of irrigation and the methods used for irrigation.\n\nAlso Read: Modern Methods of irrigation\n\nTypes of Irrigation\n\nThere are different types of irrigation practised for improving crop yield. These types of irrigation systems are practised based on the different types of soils, climates, crops and resources. The main types of irrigation followed by farmers include:\n\nSurface Irrigation\n\nIn this system, no irrigation pump is involved. Here, water is distributed across the land by gravity.\n\nLocalized Irrigation\n\nIn this system, water is applied to each plant through a network of pipes under low pressure.\n\nSprinkler Irrigation\n\nWater is distributed from a central location by overhead high-pressure sprinklers or from sprinklers from the moving platform.\n\nDrip Irrigation\n\nIn this type, drops of water are delivered near the roots of the plants. This type of irrigation is rarely used as it requires more maintenance.\n\nCentre Pivot Irrigation\n\nIn this, the water is distributed by a sprinkler system moving in a circular pattern.\n\nSub Irrigation\n\nWater is distributed through a system of pumping stations gates, ditches and canals by raising the water table.\n\nManual Irrigation\n\nThis a labour intensive and time-consuming system of irrigation. Here, the water is distributed through watering cans by manual labour.\n\nMethods of Irrigation\n\nIrrigation can be carried out by two different methods:\n\nTraditional Methods\n\nModern Methods\n\nTraditional Methods of Irrigation\n\nIn this method, irrigation is done manually. Here, a farmer pulls out water from wells or canals by himself or using cattle and carries to farming fields. This method can vary in different regions.\n\nThe main advantage of this method is that it is cheap. But its efficiency is poor because of the uneven distribution of water. Also, the chances of water loss are very high.\n\nSome examples of the traditional system are pulley system, lever system, chain pump. Among these, the pump system is the most common and used widely.\n\nModern Methods of Irrigation\n\nThe modern method compensates the disadvantages of traditional methods and thus helps in the proper way of water usage.\n\nThe modern method involves two systems:\n\nSprinkler system\n\nDrip system\n\nSprinkler System\n\nA sprinkler system, as its name suggests, sprinkles water over the crop and helps in an even distribution of water. This method is much advisable in areas facing water scarcity.\n\nHere a pump is connected to pipes which generate pressure and water is sprinkled through nozzles of pipes.\n\nDrip System\n\nIn the drip system, water supply is done drop by drop exactly at roots using a hose or pipe. This method can also be used in regions where water availability is less.\n\nAlso Read: Traditional Methods of Irrigation\n\nImportance of Irrigation\n\nThe importance of irrigation can be explained in the following points:\n\nInsufficient and uncertain rainfall adversely affects agriculture. Droughts and famines are caused due to low rainfall. Irrigation helps to increase productivity even in low rainfall.\n\nThe productivity on irrigated land is higher as compared to the un-irrigated land.\n\nMultiple cropping is not possible in India because the rainy season is specific in most of the regions. However, the climate supports cultivation throughout the year. Irrigation facilities make it possible to grow more than one crop in most of the areas of the country.\n\nIrrigation has helped to bring most of the fallow land under cultivation.\n\nIrrigation has stabilized the output and yield levels.\n\nIrrigation increases the availability of water supply, which in turn increases the income of the farmers.\n\nIrrigation should be optimum because even over-irrigation can spoil the crop production. Excess water leads to waterlogging, hinder germination, increased salt concentration and uprooting because roots can’t withstand standing water. Thus the proper method is to be used for the best cultivation.\n\nAlso Read: Crop Production and Management\n\nTo know more about irrigation, its types, methods and importance, keep visiting BYJU’S website or download the BYJU’S app for further reference."
