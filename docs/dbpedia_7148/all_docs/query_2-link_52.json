        "text": "This article is about the municipality in Uttarakhand, India. For its namesake district, see Bageshwar district.\n\nTown in Uttarakhand, India\n\nBageshwar (Kumaoni: Bāgshyār) is a town and a municipal board in Bageshwar district in the state of Uttarakhand, India. It is located at a distance of 470 km from the National Capital New Delhi and 332 km from the State Capital Dehradun.[2] Bageshwar is known for its scenic environment, glaciers, rivers and temples. It is also the administrative headquarters of Bageshwar district.[3]\n\nSituated on the confluence of Saryu and Gomati rivers,[4][5] Bageshwar is surrounded by the mountains of Bhileshwar and Nileshwar to its east and west, the Suraj Kund in the north, and Agni Kund in the south. Bageshwar was a major trade mart between Tibet and Kumaun, and was frequented by the Bhotia traders, who bartered Tibetan wares, wool, salt and Borax in exchange for carpets and other local produces in Bageshwar.[6] The trade routes were, however, closed after the Indo-China War of 1962.\n\nThe city is of great religious, historic and political significance. Bageshwar is mentioned in various Puranas, where it has been associated with Shiva.[7] The Uttrayani fair held annually in Bageshwar used to be visited by approx 15,000 people in the early twentieth century, and was the largest fair of Kumaon division.[8] The fair became the epicenter of the Coolie Begar Movement in January 1921.[9] The city of Bageshwar gets its name from the Bagnath Temple.[10] Hindi and Sanskrit are the official Languages however Kumaoni is spoken by a large number of people.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city and Bagnath Temple find mention in the Manaskhand of Shiva Purana, where it is written that the temple and its surrounding city was built by Chandeesh, a servant of the Hindu deity Shiva.[11][12] According to another Hindu Legend, Sage Markandeya worshipped Lord Shiva here.[13][14] Lord Shiva blessed sage Markandeya by visiting here in the form of a Tiger.[13][14]\n\nBageshwar has historically been a part of Kumaon Kingdom. Bageshwar was located adjacent to Kartikeypura, the then capital of Katyuri Kings that ruled over Kumaon in the 7th century.[15] After death of Birdeo the last king of united katyuri kingdom. the kingdom disintegrated in the 13th century giving rise to 8 different princely states. Bageshwar region remained under the rule of Baijnath Katyurs descendants of Katyuri kings, till 1565 until king Balo Kalyan Chand of Almora annexed the region to Kumaon.[16][17] In the 10th century, the Chand dynasty was established by Som Chand. He displaced the Katyuri Kings, called his state Kurmanchal and established its capital in Champawat in Kali Kumaon.[18][19][20] In 1568,[21] Kalyan Chand established a permanent capital at Khagmara[22] and called it Almora.[23][24][25]\n\nIn 1791, the Gorkhas of Nepal while expanding their kingdom westwards across Kali River, invaded and overran Almora,[26] the seat of the Kumaon Kingdom and other parts of Kumaon including Bageshwar. The Gorkhas were defeated by the East India Company[27] in Anglo-Nepalese War in 1814[28][29][30] and were forced to cede Kumaon to the British as part of the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816.[31]: 594 [32]\n\nThe Kumaon region was joined with the eastern half of the Garhwal region and was governed as a chief-commissionership, also known as the Kumaon Province, on the non-regulation system.[33] According to Atkinson's The Himalayan Gazetteer, Bageshwar had a population of 500 in 1886.[34] In 1891, the division was composed of the three districts of Kumaon, Garhwal and the Tarai; but the two districts of Kumaon and the Tarai were subsequently redistributed and renamed after their headquarters, Nainital and Almora.\n\nBefore the First World War, the British Government did a Survey for a rail link connecting Bageshwar with Tanakpur in 1902.[35][36] However, the project was stalled by British due to The World War. The Surveys restarted in the 1980s after Indira Gandhi visited Bageshwar. The first motor road arrived in Bageshwar in 1952 from Almora via Garur. Bus services started operating on the Bageshwar-Kapkot motorway in 1955–56. After the 1962 India-China War, an important strategic road connecting Bageshwar with Pithoragarh was completed in 1965.\n\nIn the early phase of its urban development, the central township of Bageshwar was a group of 9 small mutually tangled group of villages which had 3 uninhabited and 6 occupied villages. The Bageshwar State village was formed in 1948 by joining these villages. Bageshwar was declared a town in 1955, under the UP Town Area Act of 1914, and the first Town area committee was constituted in 1957.[37] Bageshwar received the status of a notified area committee in 1962 and municipal Council in 1968. The pumping water supply scheme was introduced in Bageshwar town in 1975.[37] The estimate for water supply was prepared in 1968-69 for a designed population of 6000 persons for the year 1997.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, dispensary (1906) and Post Office (1909) were established in Bageshwar. A public school started in 1926, which was made junior high school in 1933. After independence by several attempts from local residents, a private high school was opened in 1949 in memory of Victor Mohan Joshi, which became an Inter College in 1967. The first women's primary school started in the 1950s and women's public high school started in 1975. A new Government Degree College was inaugurated in 1974 by the then Chief Minister Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna.\n\nAfter Independence of India in 1947, Bageshwar was a part of the Almora District.[38] Bageshwar had a population of 1740 people according to the 1951 Census. It was part of the Kanda development block, that was later converted into Bageshwar development block. On 15 September 1997 the Bageshwar district was carved out of Almora district[10] by then Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati and Bageshwar became its Headquarter.

It also lies along the path to Kailash-Mansarovar pilgrimage.[63]\n\nBageshwar has traditionally been a major gateway for trade with Central Asia and Tibet. It carried on a brisk trade between Central Asia and Kumaon, and was described in The Imperial Gazetteer of India as \"one of the main outlets for the Tibetan traffic\".[64] The Bhotiya traders travelled to Tibet and sold their wares at major fairs in Bageshwar, Gyanema and Gartok.[65] The city was once rich in agriculture and animal husbandry. Besides growing crops, people were mainly engaged in sheep rearing. However, agriculture and sheep rearing in Bageshwar have suffered as villagers, who are increasingly joining armed forces, after retirement are settling down in Bageshwar town instead of their native villages.[10]\n\nThe traditional Uttarayani festival organised since centuries on the banks of the Sarju and Gomati rivers was the main place where woollen outfits made by Saukas of Munsiyari were brought form higher valleys for ages, thus strengthening trade links between the two communities.[17]\n\nAs of 2006, Bageshwar had a total of 6 Health Care units including four Hospitals (Two Allopathic, one Ayurvedi and one Homeopathic), one Maternity & Child welfare centre and one Community Health Centre.[66] Bageshwar has a total of Five Nationalized Bank's, Two Post Offices, One Telegraph Office, 80 PCO'S and 1844 Telephone Connections.[37] Mobile Communication services are provided by Private companies like Vodafone, Airtel, Idea, Reliance etc.\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nMany classical dance forms and folk art are practised in the city.

Popular types of folk songs include Mangal and Nyoli.[69] These folk songs are played on instruments including dhol, damau, turri, ransingha, dholki, daur, thali, bhankora, mandan and mashakbaja. Music is also used as a medium through which the gods are invoked. Jagar is a form of spirit worship in which the singer, or Jagariya, sings a ballad of the gods, with allusions to great epics, like Mahabharat and Ramayana, that describe the adventures and exploits of the god being invoked. Ramleela has been staged annually during the autumn festival of Navratri since 1948 in Bageshwar.[70]\n\nThe primary food of Bageshwar is vegetables with wheat being a staple. A distinctive characteristic of Kumaoni cuisine is the sparing use of tomatoes, milk, and milk based products. Coarse grain with high fibre content is very common in Kumaon due to the harsh terrain. Another crop which is associated with Kumaon is Buckwheat (locally called Kotu or Kuttu). Generally, either Desi Ghee or Mustard oil is used for the purpose of cooking food.
