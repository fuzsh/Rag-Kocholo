It is observed annually on 9 November (beginning in 2000).[1][2]\n\nSummary of the Uttarakhand\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: History of Uttarakhand and Uttarakhand movement\n\nFollowing the independence of India, the Himalayan districts of erstwhile United Provinces began to receive significant attention in the regional literature. In 1949, the Princely State of Tehri Garhwal acceded to the Union of India. With the adoption of Constitution of India in 1950, the United Provinces was renamed Uttar Pradesh and became a state of India. Even after the decades of independence, the Government of Uttar Pradesh couldn't meet the expectation to address the interests of the people in the Himalayan region. Unemployment, poverty, lack of adequate infrastructure, general underdevelopment and the migration of native (Pahari-speaking) people from the hills in search of better opportunities ultimately led to the popular demand for the creation of a separate hill state. Following the formation of Uttarakhand Kranti Dal for the purpose of achieving statehood, protests gathered momentum and took a form of widespread statehood movement across the region in 90s. The movement took a violent turn on 2 October 1994, when the Uttar Pradesh Police opened fire on a crowd of demonstrators in Muzaffarnagar, killing a number of people.\n\nThe statehood activists continued their agitation for the next several years and consequently the state of Uttarakhand was formed as Uttaranchal on 9 November 2000 by the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2000, bifurcating the erstwhile state of Uttar Pradesh. On 1 January 2007, Uttaranchal was renamed Uttarakhand, reclaiming the name by which the region had been known prior to statehood.[3]\n\nObservance and celebration\n\n[edit]\n\n2016 Uttarakhand Day Celebration\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Chief Minister of Uttarakhand Harish Rawat constituted the Uttarakhand Ratna award on the 16th anniversary of state foundation.[4]\n\nAward ceremony\n\nAward Recipient Field Uttarakhand Ratna[5] Badri Datt Pandey Freedom Movement Chandra Singh Garhwali Gaura Devi Environmental Movement Ghanshyam Giri Social Service Indramani Badoni Statehood Movement Jayanand Bharati Social Reform Mangala Devi Social Service Narayan Datt Tiwari Public Affair Sri Dev Suman Freedom Movement Uttarakhand Lifetime Achievement Award Kabutari Devi Folklore Rajendra Singh Rawat Sport\n\n(Field Hockey) Devabhumi Uttarakhand Khel Ratna Gurmeet Singh Athletics Devabhumi Uttarakhand Dronacharya Award Surendra Singh Rawat Brij Mohan Shah Memorial Award Parth Mehta Cinema and Television Urvashi Rautela Gopal Babu Goswami Memorial Award Narendra Singh Negi Music\n\n(Vocal) Keshav Das Anuragi Memorial Award Uttam Das Music\n\n(Instrumental) Mohan Singh Rithagarhi Memorial Award Girish Tiwari Music\n\n(Songwriting) Mohan Upreti Memorial Award Chander Singh Rahi Theatre Ratan Singh Jaunsari Memorial Award Nand Lal Bharati Folklore\n\n2017 Vision Uttarakhand\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the 17th Annual State Foundation Day, the Government of Uttarakhand invited the National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Chief of the Army Staff General Bipin Rawat, Secretary of the Research and Analysis Wing Anil Dhasmana, Director General of Military Operations Lieutenant General Anil Kumar Bhatt, Director General of the Indian Coast Guard Rajendra Singh and other prominent defence personnel of Uttarakhandi origin to a seminar on November 5, deliberating on the challenges that emerged following the formation of Uttarakhand state and to discuss the roadmap and vision for the state's progress and development.[6]\n\nThe Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat inaugurated the vision document of his government Sankalp Se Siddhi, a booklet based on the theme of 'Good Governance and Zero Tolerance on Corruption'.[7]\n\nAward ceremony\n\nAward Recipient Field Devabhumi Uttarakhand Khel Ratna Ekta Bisht Cricket Devabhumi Uttarakhand Dronacharya Award Liaqat Ali\n\n2018 Uttarakhand Uday\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Governor of Uttarakhand Baby Rani Maurya inaugurated the 18th Annual State Foundation Day.
