Understanding the difficulty level of questions helps you tailor your approach, prioritise topics, and fine-tune your preparation strategy.\n\nAfter getting familiar with the difficulty level, let’s understand the type of reasoning questions asked in the RBI Grade B Phase 1 exam.\n\nTypes of Reasoning Questions\n\nUnderstanding the types of questions helps you identify the level and formats of questions asked in the RBI Grade B Phase 1. It ensures that you are thoroughly prepared for all question types encountered in the exam. Below, we have explained the type of questions asked from each important topic of reasoning in the RBI Grade B Phase 1:\n\n1. Alphabetical, Alphanumeric Series\n\nTo solve alphabetical series, you must have a basic knowledge of English alphabets such as.\n\nPlace value of each alphabet (A=1, B=2……., Z=26)\n\nOpposite value of each alphabet (A=Z, B=Y, C=X, and so on.\n\nYou must keep in mind that alphanumeric series questions incorporate both letters and numbers within the series. Here are some examples.\n\nDirections: Study the following information to answer the given questions.\n\n@ F 5 2 M $ 7 K T R 3 C + 8 B ! 9 D Q * G 6 W N\n\nSTEP 1 – Those numbers which are immediately preceded by a symbol and immediately followed by an alphabet are written at the right end in descending order.\n\nSTEP 2 – After completing step 1, the alphabet which is immediately followed by a symbol is written between the 7th and 6th element from the right end in alphabetical order from left to right.\n\nQuestion 1: Which of the following elements is 11th to the right of the element which is 4th from the right end in step 1?\n\n[1] *\n\n[2] Q\n\n[3] G\n\n[4] B\n\n[5] 9\n\nQuestion 2: How many alphabets are immediately followed or preceded by a symbol in step 2?\n\n[1] Four\n\n[2] Two\n\n[3] Five\n\n[4] None\n\n[5] Three\n\n2. Coding & Decoding\n\nSimilar to alphabetical and alphanumeric series, a fundamental understanding of place values and the concept of opposite letters in the alphabet is essential. Here is an example.\n\nQuestion 1: How is ‘dwarf’ definitely coded in the same code language?\n\nI. In a certain code language, ‘the dwarf planet’ is coded as ‘cq sd ap’ and ‘the solar energy’ is coded as ‘kb og sd’.\n\nII. In a certain code language, ‘only dwarf planet’ is coded as ‘cq ap st’, ‘the coldest planet’ is coded as ‘sd cq yt’.\n\nA. The data even in both statements I and II together are not sufficient to answer the question.\n\nB. The data in statement I alone are sufficient to answer the question while the data in statement II alone are not sufficient to answer the question.\n\nC. The data either in statement I alone or in statement II alone are sufficient to answer the question.\n\nD. The data in both statement I and II together are necessary to answer the question.\n\nE. The data in statement II alone are sufficient to answer the question while the data in statement I are not sufficient to answer the question.\n\n3. Syllogism\n\nSyllogism involves drawing conclusions based on the given statements that are asserted to be true. To effectively solve syllogism problems, it’s essential to grasp basic keywords like “All,” “Some,” “Some Not,” and “No.” Additionally, understanding advanced keywords such as “Only A Few,” “Only,” “All Not,” “Can Never Be,” etc. is crucial. Here are some syllogism examples.\n\nDirections: In each of the questions below are given some statements followed by five conclusions. You have to take the given statements to be true even if they seem to be at variance with commonly known facts. Read all the conclusions and then decide which of the given conclusions logically does not follow from the given statements, disregarding commonly known facts.\n\nQuestion 1: Only a few bananas are oranges. No banana is mango. No grapes are oranges.\n\nConclusions:\n\n[1] Some grapes can be mangoes\n\n[2] All bananas can be oranges\n\n[3] Some mangoes are not bananas\n\n[4] Some grapes are bananas is a possibility\n\n[5] Some oranges can be mangoes\n\nQuestion 2: Some actors are dancers. Only a few dancers are singers. No singer is politician\n\nConclusions:\n\n[1] Some politicians being actors is a possibility\n\n[2] Some dancers are not singers\n\n[3] Some dancers are not politicians is not a possibility\n\n[4] Some actors are singers\n\n[5] Some actors are singers is a possibility\n\nReverse Syllogism\n\nSyllogism involves the concept of reverse reasoning. In this case, you are presented with a conclusion, and your task is to identify the statements that can be inferred based on the information provided in the questions. Here is an example.\n\nDirections: In the following question, two conclusions have been given followed by five sets of possible statements. You have to take the given conclusions to be true even if they seem to be at variance with the commonly known facts and then decide for the given conclusions logically follow from which of the given set of statements disregarding commonly known facts.\n\nQuestion 1: Conclusions:\n\n1. Some gold are not silver.\n\n2. Some gold are fabric.\n\nStatements:\n\n[1] All silver are fabric. No fabric is gold. Some gold are metal.\n\n[2] Some silver are fabric. Some fabrics are gold. All gold are metal.\n\n[3] No silver is fabric. All fabric are gold. Some gold are metal.\n\n[4] All silver are fabric. Some fabric are metal. Some gold are metal.\n\n[5] All fabric are silver. All silver are gold. All gold are metal.\n\nQuestion 2: Conclusions:\n\n1. Some hospitals are buildings is a possibility.\n\n2. Some hostels are not houses.\n\nStatements:\n\n[1] All buildings are schools. All schools are hostels. No school is house. No hospital is hostel.\n\n[2] Some buildings are schools. All Schools are hostels. No hospital is house. Some schools are\n\nhouses.\n\n[3] All buildings are schools. All schools are hostels. No school is house. All hospitals are hostels.\n\n[4] Some buildings are schools. No school is hostel. No hostel is hospital. Some hospitals are houses.\n\n[5] None of these.\n\n4. Inequality\n\nSolving inequality requires a basic understanding of symbols (<,>,=, >=, <=,) and their corresponding relationships. Additionally, it’s crucial to comprehend the concept of possibilities, including “either/or” and “neither/nor.” You must know that statement-based inequality questions have been asked in the previous RBI Grade B exam. Here are some examples.\n\nDirections: In these questions, a relationship between different elements is shown in the\n\nstatements. These statements are followed by two conclusions. Give answer\n\nM&N means M is neither greater than nor equal to N\n\nM%N means M is neither smaller than nor greater than N\n\nM*N means M is not greater N\n\nM$N means M is greater than N\n\nM@N means M is either greater than or equal to N\n\nQuestion 1: Which of the following will make S>P definitely true?\n\nI: P$E@I*S%M\n\nII: I%L@P%K*G*S\n\nIII: B*P%Y&N*S\n\nA. If only Conclusion I follows\n\nB. If only conclusion II follows\n\nC. If both Conclusion I and II follow\n\nD. If only conclusion III follows\n\nE. If both the conclusion I and III follows\n\nReverse Inequality\n\nSimilar to the reverse syllogism, a conclusion is given and you need to identify the correct statement. Here is an example.\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nDirection: In which of the following expressions V > Z, K < Y is definitely true?\n\n[1] X => W > K => Z < Y <= U < V\n\n[2] W <= T < V > G => I => Y > Z < K\n\n[3] T => C < V => A = Q => Z > Y > D > K\n\n[4] D => E = G > V = F > K > Z < K < Q <= Y\n\n[5] A => I => H = L < Z > K > V < J < Y\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nDirection: In which of the following expressions is the expression M => R definitely true\n\n[1] X < R => T => P < N > B => M > U\n\n[2] N > M > L = C => A = D > S = R\n\n[3] L <= B > M > X => U <= A = O < R\n\n[4] T > M = F => G = U => O <= R = S\n\n[5] A > R <= B = L = P <= S = M < G\n\n5. Direction Sense\n\nIt requires a basic knowledge of directions (East, West, North, and South) and sub-direction (Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest). Please note that the direction questions are usually asked in the form of puzzles and statement-based questions. Here is an example.\n\nQuestion 1: The question given below consists of two statements I and II given below it. You have to decide whether the data provided in the statements are sufficient to answer the question. Read all the statements and give the answer.\n\nSeven points, T, U, V, W, X, Y and Z are drawn on a rectangular piece of paper. What is the direction of point W with respect to point U?\n\nStatement I: Y is 3cm to the west of T. V is 6cm to the east of Y. U is 3cm to the south of T. W is 9cm to the east of Z. X is 6cm to the west of W. V is 5cm to the south of X.\n\nStatement II: Z is 6cm to the north of U. X is 3cm east of Z. V is 5cm south of X. Y is 6cm west of V. T is the midpoint of Y and V. W, which is in the east of X, is 13cm to the northeast of Y.\n\n[1] Data in statement I alone is sufficient to answer the question, while data in statement II alone is not sufficient to answer the question.\n\n[2] Data in statement II alone is sufficient to answer the question, while data in statement I alone is not sufficient to answer the question.\n\n[3] Data either in statement I alone or in statement II alone is sufficient to answer the question.\n\n[4] Data given in both the statement I and II together are not sufficient to answer the question.\n\n[5] Data in statements I and II together are necessary to answer the question.\n\n6. Blood Relation\n\nIt is important to have a basic knowledge of blood relations so that you can easily make the family tree. It is important to note that the blood relation questions are usually asked in the form of puzzles. Here is an example.\n\nDirection: Answer the following questions based on the information given below.\n\nEight people Alex, Ben, Charlie, Daniel, Peter, Quinin, Rachel, and Sophia are seated around a circular table facing the centre. Some information about their relationships and positions is given:\n\nSophia’s husband is sitting two seats to the right of Ben.\n\nQuinn is seated two seats to the left of Daniel’s daughter.\n\nQuinn is Rachel’s sister.\n\nSophis’s husband is not sitting next to Quinn.\n\nThere is one person between Quinn and Alex.\n\nSimilarly, there is one person between Peter and Sophia’s mother.\n\nAlex is the father of Rachel. Charlie is not sitting next to Quinn.\n\nSophia’s mother is seated immediately to the right of Daniel, who is Sophia’s brother.\n\nThere is one person between Sophia and Rachel.\n\nPeter is not sitting next to Rachel, who is the mother of Charlie.\n\nQuestion 1: Who is sitting second to the right of Ben?\n\n[1] Rachel\n\n[2] Alex\n\n[3] Quinn\n\n[4] Peter\n\n[5] Sophia\n\nQuestion 2: How many people are seated between Quinn and Alex?\n\n[1] Three\n\n[2] Four\n\n[3] Two\n\n[4] One\n\n[5] None\n\n7. Ranking & Order\n\nIt involves arranging a group of items or individuals in a specific sequence (horizontally or vertically) or order based on given conditions or criteria. Here is an example.\n\nDirection: The question below consists of a question and two statements numbered I and II. You have to decide whether the data provided in the statements are sufficient to answer the question. Read both the statements and give answer.\n\nQuestion 1: Among M, N, O, P, Q and R, each having a different height, who is the second tallest?\n\nI. M is taller than only O. N is taller than P shorter than R. Q is shorter than N.\n\nII. Q is taller than only three persons. P is taller than M but shorter than R. N is shorter than R taller than P.\n\nA. Data in statement I alone are sufficient to answer the question, while the data in Statement II alone are not sufficient to answer the question.\n\nB. Data in statement II alone are sufficient to answer the question, while the data in statement I alone are not sufficient to answer the question.\n\nC. Data in statements I alone or in Statement II alone are sufficient to answer the question.\n\nD. Data in both the Statements I and II are not sufficient to answer the question.\n\nE. Data in both the Statements I and II together are necessary to answer the question.\n\n8. Machine Input-Output\n\nThese types of questions are primarily logic-based, with many of the underlying patterns directly linked to the English alphabetical series and numerical sequences.\n\nYou must know that in the English alphabetical series, logic is often based on elements like place value, opposite letters, the sum of letter positions, and the number of letters in a word. When it comes to numerical sequences, the logic may revolve around even numbers, odd numbers, prime numbers, natural numbers, composite numbers, and more. Here is an example.\n\nDirection: Study the following information carefully and answer the given questions.\n\nA word arrangement machine given an input line of words rearranges them following a particular rule in each step. The following is an illustration of input and rearrangement.\n\nInput: random optimistic thrifty afraid predictable extravagant pompous humble brave pessimistic\n\nStep1: afraid random optimistic thrifty predictable extravagant pompous humble pessimistic brave.\n\nStep2: extravagant afraid random optimistic predictable pompous humble pessimistic brave thrifty.\n\nStep3: humble extravagant afraid random optimistic predictable pessimistic brave thrifty pompous.\n\nStep4: optimistic humble extravagant afraid random predictable brave thrifty pompous pessimistic.\n\nStep5: predictable optimistic humble extravagant afraid brave thrifty pompous pessimistic random.\n\nStep5 is the last step of the above input.\n\nInput: jeopradize entrust safeguard withdraw anxiety lengthen secular abridge spiritual ease.\n\nQuestion 1: What will be the fourth step of the above input?\n\n[1] jeopradize entrust abridge anxiety secular spiritual lengthen ease withdraw safeguard.\n\n[2] jeopradize entrust anxiety abridge secular spiritual lengthen brave withdraw safeguard.\n\n[3] jeopradize entrust anxiety abridge secular lengthen spiritual ease withdraw safeguard.\n\n[4] jeopradize entrust anxiety abridge secular spiritual lengthen ease withdraw safeguard.\n\n[5] jeopradize entrust anxiety afraid secular spiritual lengthen withdraw ease safeguard.\n\nQuestion 2: In step 5th of the rearrangement, if ‘anxiety’ is related to ‘entrust’ and ‘abridge ‘ in a certain way. Which of the following would ‘withdraw’ be related to, following the same pattern?\n\n[1] Lengthen and ease\n\n[2] Ease and entrust\n\n[3] Ease and safeguard\n\n[4] Lengthen and safeguard\n\n[5] None of these\n\n9. Seating Arrangement\n\nSeating arrangement questions are based on organising and analysing information about individuals or objects placed in a specific order or arrangement. You must know that there are different types of seating arrangements asked in the exam:\n\nRow (linear and parallel)\n\nUnknown no. of people\n\nSeating in a shape (circle, square, triangle, rectangle, hexagon, etc.) facing inside, facing outside, and both\n\nCombinations (circle + blood relations, row + blood relations, etc)\n\nHere is an example.\n\nDirections: Answer the questions based on the information given below:\n\nThere are 3 horizontally parallel rows, row 1, row 2 and row 3. Row 1 is to the north of row 2 and row 2 is to the north of row 3. Five persons are sitting in each row and L is one of the persons among them. In row 1, the first three persons sitting from left to right are facing north and the rest are facing south. In row 3, the first three persons sitting from left to right are facing north and the rest are facing south. In row 2, the first two persons sitting from left to right are facing north and the rest are facing south. The last two persons from the left end of row 1 face the first two persons from the left end of row 2. The last three persons from the left end of row 2 face the first three persons from the left end of row 3.\n\nF, who is sitting 2nd to the right of Q, is sitting opposite to A. Three persons are sitting between A and M. F is facing south. G is sitting 2nd to the right of C and both of them are facing the north. E is sitting on the left of G. One person is sitting between E and N. B is sitting to the immediate left of D, who is sitting opposite to O, who is not sitting adjacent to A. S and P are sitting opposite to each other. Neither S nor P is sitting in row 1. R is not sitting adjacent to M.\n\nQuestion 1: Find the odd one out.\n\n[1] C\n\n[2] O\n\n[3] N\n\n[4] F\n\n[5] Q\n\nQuestion 2: How many persons are sitting on the left of S?\n\n[1] 3\n\n[2] 1\n\n[3] 4\n\n[4] 2\n\n[5] None of these\n\n10. Puzzles\n\nSolving puzzles requires critical thinking, deduction, and consistent practice. It is important to know that these puzzles come in various formats, such as Hierarchy, Flat + Floor, Month + Date, Birthdate, Month-Based, and many more. Here is an example.\n\nDirections: Answer the questions based on the information given below.\n\nP, Q, and R are three adjacent buildings. P is to the west of Q. Q is to the west of R. Each building has a different number of floors with the lowest floor numbered 1, the floor above it numbered 2 and so on. The height of floors in each building is the same i.e. the same numbered floors are at equal height from the ground. Only a few of the floors of these buildings are taken and the rest are vacant. None of the buildings had more than 10 floors.\n\nD’s floor number was twice that of J’s floor number.\n\nJ lived in building Q. Q had prime numbered floors and J lived on the floor that was 3rd from the top\n\nNot more than 3 flats were taken in building P\n\nF was exactly to the east of B\n\nB lived exactly above C but not in the same building\n\nC and F did not live in the same building\n\nA’s floor number was thrice as that of C’s floor number.\n\nA was exactly to the west of H\n\nH was not in building R\n\nC and G did not live in the same building\n\nG lived immediately below E\n\nB and E lived on consecutive floors of the same building\n\nI was exactly to the east of C\n\nI and E did not live in the same building\n\nB and G did not have the same floor number\n\nThe number of floors in I’s building was 3 less than that in building Q\n\n1. Only one person lives on each floor\n\n2. Exactly to the east or west does not mean immediate east or west but on the same floor.\n\n3. Immediately above or below implies that the person is not in the same building.\n\nQuestion 1: How many floors were there in building P?\n\n[1] 6\n\n[2] 8\n\n[3] 5\n\n[4] 10\n\n[5] 9\n\nQuestion 2: What was the floor number of F?\n\n[1] 4\n\n[2] 2\n\n[3] 3\n\n[4] 5\n\n[5] 6\n\nClick here to Download the RBI Grade B Phase 1 Reasoning PYQs in PDF.\n\nNow that you have understood the types of reasoning questions asked in the RBI Grade B Phase 1, let’s learn the important books to prepare for the exam.\n\nImportant Books for RBI Grade B Phase 1 Reasoning\n\nHere are the important books that can help you cover the syllabus for RBI Grade B Phase 1 Reasoning.\n\nImportant Note: Candidates must solve previous years’ question papers, mock tests, and exercise questions to evaluate themselves.\n\nAfter getting familiar with the important books, let’s understand the RBI Grade B Phase 1 Reasoning preparation strategy.\n\nHow to Prepare for RBI Grade B Phase 1 Reasoning\n\nFollow these below-mentioned strategies to prepare for RBI Grade B Phase 1 reasoning:\n\n1.

Understanding the difficulty level of questions helps you tailor your approach, prioritise topics, and fine-tune your preparation strategy.\n\nAfter getting familiar with the difficulty level, let’s understand the type of quant questions asked in the RBI Grade B Phase 1 exam.\n\nTypes of Quant Questions\n\nUnderstanding the types of questions helps you identify the level and formats of questions asked in the RBI Grade B Phase 1. It ensures that you are thoroughly prepared for all question types encountered in the exam. Below, we have explained the type of questions asked from each important topic of quant in the RBI Grade B Phase 1:\n\n1. Number Series\n\nIt involves a sequence of numbers where each number follows a specific pattern or rule. The challenge is to identify this pattern and use it to predict the next/missing number/numbers in the series. It is important to know the common patterns; addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, square roots, etc. However, the rule can also involve more complex mathematical functions such as a combination of two or more patterns. Here are some examples.\n\nQuestion 1: The series given below contains a missing number ‘P’. Find the value of ‘P’ and determine which among the given three statement(s) is/are true.\n\n74, 290, 241, 753, 672, ‘P’, 1551\n\nI: The nearest perfect square number to ‘P’ is 1600\n\nII: ‘P’ is divisible by 11\n\nIII: (P + 28) is a multiple of 50.\n\n[1] Only I\n\n[2] Only II\n\n[3] Only I and II\n\n[4] Only II and III\n\n[5] Only III\n\nQuestion 2: Given below are two numbers in series I and II where the missing numbers in series I and II are ‘P’ and ‘Q’, respectively. Find the value of ‘P’ and ‘Q’ and find which among the given options gives the correct value of (P – Q).\n\nI: 5000, 4000, 3000, 2100, P, 819\n\nII: 4, 6, 15, 56, Q, 1644\n\n[1] 1120\n\n[2] 1090\n\n[3] 980\n\n[4] 1240\n\n[5] 1050\n\n2. Quadratic Equation\n\nSolving quadratic equations requires basic knowledge of algebra and mathematics. Here are some examples.\n\nQuestion 1: Given below are 3 equations I, II and III where ‘a’ and ‘b’ are the roots of equation I where (a < b) and ‘c’ and ‘d’ are roots of equation II where (c < d). On this basis, solve for equation III and find the relationship between ‘z’ and ‘k’ given that k = 11\n\nI. 3x(x – 12) + 72 = x²- 11x – 5\n\nII. 5y(y – 3) – 64 = y(3y – 2) – 19\n\nIII. (z + 2a – d)² = 169\n\n[1] z > k\n\n[2] z < k\n\n[3] z = k or the relationship cannot be established\n\n[4] z ≥ k\n\n[5] z ≤ k\n\nQuestion 2: Given below are three equations i.e. ‘I’, ‘II’ and ‘III’. If roots of the equation ‘I’ are ‘p’ and ‘q’, respectively such that p > q while the roots of the equation ‘II’ are ‘m’ and ‘n’ respectively such that m > n, then find the value of ‘K’.\n\nI. 2x²- 6(x + 4) = 3x + 11\n\nII. 2y²- 12(y – 4) = 7y + 6\n\nIII. (15m/2) – 8q = 9p – 4n + K²\n\n[1] 11\n\n[2] 4\n\n[3] 7\n\n[4] 9\n\n[5] 14\n\n3. Percentage & Ratio\n\nPercentages and ratios are closely related, and they can be easily converted into each other. For example, 25% can be expressed as 1/4 in the form of a ratio. The RBI Grade B Phase 1 exam doesn’t include straightforward questions on percentages and ratios; rather, it features statement-based questions. Here is an example.\n\nQuestion 1: Maya’s monthly salary is 60% more than that of Swevi. Both Swevi and Maya, out of their respective monthly salary, pay an equal sum towards EMI. Out of the remaining monthly salary, Maya and Swevi, spend a certain amount towards house rent. The amount that Swevi pays towards EMI is 20% of her monthly salary. The amount that Maya pays towards house rent is ‘x’ times that she pays towards EMI.\n\nI: Find the total savings of Maya if her expenditure on EMI and house rent is just half of her total salary. Also, the EMI expense of Swevi is Rs 30000. It is to be assumed that Maya and Swevi had only two expenses from their salaries i.e. EMI and house rent.\n\nII: The difference between house rents paid by Maya and Swevi is Rs 10000. House rent paid by Maya is Rs 6000 more than the EMI paid by her. If the house rent paid by Swevi is 33.33% of the EMI paid by Maya, then, the salary of Maya is?\n\nA. Rs. 30000, Rs. 36000\n\nB. Rs. 45000, Rs. 60000\n\nC. Rs. 120000, Rs. 48000\n\nD. Rs. 75000, Rs. 48000\n\nE. Rs. 135000, Rs. 60000\n\n4. Profit & Loss\n\nSimilar to the percentage and ratio, statement-based questions are asked in the RBI Grade B exam. Here is an example.\n\nQuestion 1: Navya buys two articles A and B at the same cost price of Rs. P. Then, she marks up both articles by 75% above their cost price. Then, she sold article A at a Rs. 268 discount and article B at a 20% discount. Then, which of the following statement(s) is/are definitely correct:\n\nI: The profit earned by selling article B is greater than that by article A.\n\nII: The discount per cent given on article A is more than that in B\n\nIII: She earned equal profits by selling both articles.\n\nA. Only I\n\nB. Only II\n\nC. Both I and II\n\nD. Only III\n\nE. None of the above\n\n5. Simple and Compound Interest\n\nSolving problems related to Simple and Compound Interest requires a good understanding of the underlying principles of interest calculation. Similar to the profit and loss, statement-based questions are asked in the previous RBI Grade B exams. Here is an example.\n\nQuestion 1: Arun invested a certain sum of money at a rate of interest ___% for ___ years. If the ratio of the amount to interest is 216:91. Then find the rate of interest and time for which Arun invested the money.\n\nI: 10%, 2 years\n\nII: 20%, 3 years\n\nIII: 25%, 3 years\n\nA. Only I\n\nB. Only II\n\nC. Both I and II\n\nD. Both II and III\n\nE. All I, II and III\n\n6. Time, Speed, & Distance\n\nThis topic requires a solid understanding of the key concepts of Time, Speed, and Distance. You also need to understand the relationships among these variables and how to apply the relevant formulas. No direct questions were asked in the RBI Grade B exam; instead, the exam featured statement-based questions. Here is an example.\n\nDirections: In the question, two Quantities I and II are given. You have to solve both the Quantity to establish the correct relation between Quantity-I and Quantity-II and choose the correct option.\n\nQuestion 1: The speed of boat ‘B’ in still water is 8 km/h more than that of boat ‘A’. The ratio of the downstream speed of boat ‘A’ to the upstream speed of boat ‘B’ is 9:8. The ratio of the upstream speed of boat ‘A’ to the downstream speed of boat ‘B’ is 6:11. (Both boats are travelling in the same stream)\n\nQuantity-I: Find the sum of the distance travelled by boat ‘A’ downstream in 125 minutes and the distance travelled by boat ‘B’ in upstream in 75 minutes.\n\nQuantity-II: The speed of Boat ‘C’ in still water is 50 km/h.\n\nFind the sum of distance travelled by boats ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ together while travelling upstream for 1 hour. Boat ‘C’ is also travelling in the same stream.\n\n[1] Quantity-I > Quantity-II\n\n[2] Quantity-I < Quantity-II\n\n[3] Quantity-I ≤ Quantity-II\n\n[4] Quantity-I = Quantity-II or No relation\n\n[5] Quantity-I ≥ Quantity-II\n\n7. Time and Work\n\nTo tackle Time and Work problems effectively, you must have a strong grasp of fundamental concepts. This includes the understanding of the concept of work done per unit of time, which represents the rate at which an individual or a group can accomplish a task. You must know that statement-based questions are asked in the exam. Here is an example.\n\nQuestion 1: A and B can together finish a piece of work in 20 days. If B starts working and after 15 days is replaced by A, A can finish the remaining work in 24 days.\n\nI. Number of days taken by B alone to finish the same piece of work.\n\nII. Number of days taken by A alone to finish the same piece of work.\n\n[1] If quantity I ≥ quantity II\n\n[2] If quantity I > quantity II\n\n[3] If quantity I < quantity II\n\n[4] If quantity I = quantity II or the relationship cannot be established from the information that is given\n\n[5] If quantity I ≤ quantity II\n\n8. Data Interpretation (DI)\n\nSolving DI requires knowledge of arithmetic concepts such as percentages, ratios, averages, etc. you must understand the three types of DIs that are asked in the RBI Grade B exam.\n\n1. Basic DI\n\nIn Basic DI, information is given in the form of Table, Bar, Pie, Line, and Mix graphs. These types of DIs are based on your calculations. RBI usually ask questions by combining two of these graphs. Here is an example.\n\nDirections: Answer the questions based on the information given below.\n\nFive different schools of a district participated in multiple tournaments during a year. Each school won some gold, silver and bronze medals. The pie chart given below shows the percentage distribution of the number of gold medals won by each school out of the total gold medals won by all schools together.\n\nThe table chart given below shows the difference between the number of gold and silver medals, won by each school and the percentage of the number of bronze medals won by each school as a percentage of the number of silver medals won by that school.\n\nNote: The total number of medals won by school ‘E’ was 86 more than that by school ‘D’.\n\nQuestion 1: Find the sum of the number of bronze medals won by schools ‘A’ and ‘C’ together.\n\n[1] 816\n\n[2] 664\n\n[3] 704\n\n[4] 752\n\n[5] None of these\n\nQuestion 2: Find the ratio between the number of bronze medals won by school ‘E’ and the sum of the number of gold medals won by schools ‘B’ and ‘C’ together, respectively.\n\n[1] 3: 5\n\n[2] 4: 7\n\n[3] 2: 5\n\n[4] 5: 7\n\n[5] None of these\n\n2. Arithmetic DI\n\nThe arithmetic DI involves statement-based questions from arithmetic topics such as:\n\nPercentage\n\nRatio\n\nProfit & Loss\n\nSimple and Compound Interest\n\nTime, Speed, & Distance\n\nTime and Work\n\nHere is an example.\n\nDirections: The following is the data regarding the revenue and expenditure of 4 companies in 2018 and 2017.

Below, we have explained the type of questions asked from each topic of English in the RBI Grade B Phase 1:\n\n1. Reading Comprehension\n\nReading Comprehension requires the ability to understand, interpret, and draw conclusions from written passages. Here is an example.\n\nDirections: Read the following passage and answer the questions based on the available information.\n\nThe National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has rightfully identified 21st-century skills as fundamental to developing creators. Critical thinking and problem-solving, communication and collaboration creativity and innovation, flexibility and adaptability, initiative and self-direction, social and cross-cultural interactions, and productivity and accountability all strengthen the individuals’ abilities at the workplace.\n\nRelying on traditional literacy and numeracy alone will not suffice and tends to marginalize differently-abled learners. Educators could consider a design-based approach where students concentrate on a subject for two-three weeks to examine how it can be applied in the real world. But does our current classroom and content-heavy syllabus enable deep work? Also, how do we retrain teachers who have been trained in traditional systems? They know terms like ‘constructivism’ but do not know how it should be used in a classroom that is focused on exams rather than learning. And how ready are our future educators?\n\nIn a semester-long study that used Wikipedia as a pedagogical tool for teacher training, 65 preservice (B.Ed) teachers were asked to improve the pages on Wikipedia related to educational concepts. Excluding a few, the content created by most participants was either sent back to them or deleted by neutral editors of Wikipedia. The content, it was found, was plagiarised, did not provide citations, lacked basic writing and grammar skills, etc. After three iterative cycles that were emotionally intense, the teachers were able to contribute content to over 75 Wikipedia articles in English and over 50 articles in Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Malayalam, Gujarati, Assamese and Punjabi. All the content was related to educational technology. The critical feedback from various Wikipedia editors was crucial because it was unbiased. This feedback forced the learners to re-evaluate their skills. This shows that constant engagement, an emotional connection, and immersive learning are important parts of education. EdTech apps can deliver content that caters to multiple learning styles, learning curves and pace of learning. The pandemic has shown that traditional teacher and brick-and-mortar schools may become obsolete if radical pedagogical changes do not follow.\n\nQuestion 1: Which of the following measures has been suggested in the given passage for improvement of the education system?\n\nA.
