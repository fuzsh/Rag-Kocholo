        "text": "Vegetation and soils in Uttarakhand :\n\nVegetation :\n\nUttarakhand vegetation cover is about 60 percent of the total surface area. Uttarakhand is very rich in terms of flora and is replete with a tremendously wide variety of vegetation. There is significant diversity in natural vegetation, because of its variation in geographical conditions. The diverse climatic conditions along with other features like soil quality, rainfall, temperature etc are responsible for the variety of vegetation which grow at different altitudes. The flora of this region can be categorized into tropical, Himalayan sub-tropical and sub-alpine and alpine type.\n\nThe sub-tropical region up to an altitude of 4000 ft. is the abode of Sal forests and at an altitude of about 5000 ft. pine begins to dominate along with Oak. Apricot, guava, plum and peach are the major fruit species of the state. Flowers like sun flower, geraniums, asters, lilies, roses, anemones, marigold, primula, gerberas, dahlias, hydrangeas, gladiolas are commonly found in this region. Brahma kamal, aconites, buras, poppy, roji, pastoris, ligujeriya, Thimus lainearus, jaisiyana etc are some other flower plants which are abundantly found in the Valley of flowers in district Chamoli. This region also has 225 species of ornamental plants which have immense horticultural and potential importance. Acrides, coelogyne, thunia, dendrobium etc are some examples of ornamental plants which are found at places like Mandai, Baram, Dafia Dhoora, Kaflani, Shandev etc . An amazing range of medicinal plants and herbs also grow in the state. Ranikhet area is replete with approximately 4000 species of medicinal plants. There are thick forests of pines, deodars, rhododendrons and birches in this region which are valuable and mostly their wood is used for making window and door frames and beautiful carving is done on them.\n\nUttarakhand has thick forests near Jangle-chatti below Tungnath and dense birch forests on top of Gangotri, the Arau valley and many other places. Chir pine or Pinus roxburghi is found from the height of 1,200 to 2,200 m, which is the most common conifer of Uttarakhand region. Besides timber, pine yields resin from which turpentine oil is obtained. Some shrubbery types of this region are: Ghingharu, Jhatalu, Hinsalu, Kilmori. This area also has moist mixed deciduous forest and sub-alpine grazing land in abundance This region is replete with diverse flora and fauna because of the complex topography e.g. high mountains and valleys.\n\nThe slopes of the mountains are covered by immense grasslands, which are called bugyals (alpine pastures) in Uttarakhand. Bugyals are well known for rich and diversified vegetation. These grasslands or Bugyal are found between tree line and snow line that is between altitudes 4,000 and 5000 m. These Bugyals are flat and sloppy lands carpeted with green grass and seasonal flowers, which is very nutritious fodder for goats, sheep, cattle and other animals. These grasslands were covered with birch and juniper in the past but now they have been cleared to serve many purposes. Dol, Hatthajari, Bal chari, Kutaki, Jatamansi etc are some other common plants,which are used for curing many incurable disease.\n\nThe World famous Auli and Gorson Bugyals are near Joshimath, at an altitude of about 3049 m. Besides, Bedni Bugyal, Dayara Bugyal in Uttarkashi district and Panwali and Kush-Kalyani Bugyals lying on the way to Gangotri and Kedarnath, Rup Kund Ka Bugyal is another famous Bugyal. Dayara Bugyal is in Uttarkashi district and Bedni Bugyal is near mundoli and it is at a height of 3,354 m. Panwali and Kush- Kalyani Bugyals are on the way to Gangotri and Kedarnath. Chopta Bugyal ( on the way to Ukhimath Gopewhwer), Jaurai Bugyal(on the way of sahastra tal), Masartal and Sahastra tal ke Bugyal ( near Budha kedar), Kotaali ki hari Bugyal, Kalpnath Bugyal ( on the way to Badrinath), Chayagaad Bugyal ( in Uttarkashi district). Har ka dun Bugyal is one of the most beautiful Bugyals of Garahwl ( in Uttarkashi district), Dayara Bugyal ( in Uttarkashi), Auli- gurso ka Bugyal ( about 5.0 km. from Joshimatah), Kathling ka Bugyal ( after Gangi village) and Rup kund ka Bugyal ( on the way to Rishikash) etc are some other Bugyals of this region.\n\nSoil :\n\nThe soil of this state is known as mountainous forest soil which. The thin cover of soil commonly occurs on the temperate dip-hills; on the other hand the southern slopes contain colluvial deposits. Therefore the northern hills support forests, while the southern faces are generally naked. Generally five main types of soil are found in this region:Quartzite soil; Volcanic soil; Brown soil; Alluvial soil; and Tertiary soil.\n\nQuartzite soil is generally found in Nainital district. This soil is light and infertile, which contains cysts and quartz.\n\nVolcanic soil is very fertile and suitable for the agriculture, which is found in the hilly tract with igneous rocks. It is sandy and light and contains sizable amount of dolomite and granite.\n\nBrown or grey soil is found in Nainital, Mussoorie and Chakrata. It has high percentage of lime. The high altitude areas have a brown soil cover which is rich in humus.\n\nThe Alpine zone, extending above 3000 m, has a soil of glacial origin with granitic sandy loam. Alluvial soil is also suitable for agriculture; it is fertile and found in the valleys which have colluvial and alluvial deposits. This type of soil is also found in lower slopes of Siwaliks range, Doon valley and Tarai and Bhabhar region.\n\nTertiary type of soil is commonly found in the Siwaliks Mountains as well as the Doon Valley. The soil is very light, porous and contains sand. It is replete with iron-oxide, biological remains and humus. It is suitable for the cultivation of Tea."
