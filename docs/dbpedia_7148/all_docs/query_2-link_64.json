There is not single accepted method of dividing up the dialects of Kumaoni. Broadly speaking, Kali (or Central) Kumaoni is spoken in Almora and northern Nainital. North-eastern Kumaoni is spoken in Pithoragarh. South-eastern Kumaoni is spoken in South-eastern Nainital. Western Kumaoni is spoken west of Almora and Nainital.\n\nMore specifically:[8]\n\nJohari of the Malla and Talla Johar (Milam, Munsiyari)\n\nAskoti of Askot\n\nBhabhri of Haldwani and Ramnagar[8]\n\nDanpuriya of Danpur (Bageshwar, Kapkot)\n\nGangoli of Ganai-Gangoli (Kanda, Berinag, Gangolihat)\n\nKhasparjiya of Almora\n\nKumaiyya of Champawat\n\nPachhai of Pali-Pachhhau (Ranikhet, Dwarahat)\n\nPhaldakotiya of Phaldkot\n\nRhau-Chaubyansi, (Nainital)\n\nSirali of Sirakot (Didihat)\n\nSoriyali of Sor Valley (Pithoragarh)\n\nSome Kumaoni speakers are also reportedly found in Western Nepal.[2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nVarious Kumaoni text have been found from the Katyuri and Chand era on temple stones and as copper plate inscriptions.[9][10] Kumaoni was also the official language of the Kumaon Kingdom.[citation needed]\n\nPhonology\n\n[edit]\n\nConsonants\n\n[edit]\n\nLabial Dental/\n\nAlveolar Retroflex Post-alv./\n\nPalatal Velar Glottal Nasal voiced m n ɳ ŋ breathy mʱ nʱ Stop/\n\nAffricate voiceless p t ʈ tʃ k aspirated pʰ tʰ ʈʰ tʃʰ kʰ voiced b d ɖ dʒ ɡ breathy bʱ dʱ ɖʱ dʒʱ ɡʱ Fricative s ʃ h Rhotic voiced r ɽ breathy ɽʱ Lateral voiced l ɭ breathy lʱ Approximant w j\n\n/ʃ/ can also be heard as [s] in free variation, depending on the dialect.[11]\n\nVowels\n\n[edit]\n\nFront Central Back High iː uː ɪ ʊ Mid eː ə oː ɛ ɔ Low (æ) ɑ ɑː\n\n/ɛ/ can be heard as [æ] in free variation.[12]\n\n/ɑ/ can be heard as either back [ɑ] or central [ä] in free variation.\n\n/ɔ/ can be heard as [ɒ] in free variation.[13]\n\nGrammar\n\n[edit]\n\nBeing part of the Indo-Aryan dialect continuum Kumauni shares its grammar with other Indo-Aryan languages like Dotyali, Nepali, Hindi, Rajasthani, Kashmiri and Gujarati. It shares much of its grammar with the other language of the Central Pahari group like Garhwali. The peculiarities of grammar in Kumaoni and other Central Pahari languages exist due to the influence of the now extinct language of the Khasas, the first inhabitants of the region. In Kumauni the verb substantive is formed from the root ach, as in both Rajasthani and Kashmiri. In Rajasthani its present tense, being derived from the Sanskrit present rcchami, I go, does not change for gender. But in Pahari and Kashmiri it must be derived from the rare Sanskrit particle *rcchitas, gone, for in these languages it is a participial tense and does change according to the gender of the subject. Thus, in the singular we have: - Here we have a relic of the old Khasa language, which, as has been said, seems to have been related to Kashmiri. Other relics of Khasa, again agreeing with north-western India, are the tendency to shorten long vowels, the practice of epenthesis, or the modification of a vowel by the one which follows in the next syllable, and the frequent occurrence of disaspiration. Thus, Khas siknu, Kumauni sikhno, but Hindi sikhna, to learn; Kumauni yeso, plural yasa, of this kind.\n\nLanguage Comparison Khas-kura (Nepali) Kumauni Kashmiri to be Masc Fem Masc Fem Masc Fem 1SG chhu chhu chik chu chus ches 2SG chhas chhes chai chi chukh chekh 3SG chha chhe ch chi chuh cheh\n\nVerb conjugation\n\n[edit]\n\nConjugation of the verb Lekh (लेख) to write, in all three tenses in Kumaoni.\n\nPresent tense\n\n[edit]\n\nPast tense\n\n[edit]\n\nSingular Plural\n\nमेल\n\nmaile\n\nलिखौ\n\nlekho\n\nमेल लिखौ\n\nmaile lekho\n\nI wrote\n\nहमुल\n\nhumul\n\nलेखौ\n\nlekho\n\nहमुल लेखौ\n\nhumul lekho\n\nwe wrote\n\nत्वील\n\ntveel\n\nलिखौ\n\nlekho\n\nत्वील लिखौ\n\ntveel lekho\n\nyou wrote\n\nतुमुल\n\ntumule\n\nलेखौ\n\nlekho\n\nतुमुल लेखौ\n\ntumule lekho\n\nyou wrote\n\nवील\n\nveel\n\nलिखौ\n\nlekho\n\nवील लिखौ\n\nveel lekho\n\nhe wrote\n\nउनुले\n\nunule\n\nलेखौ\n\nlekho\n\nउनुले लेखौ\n\nunule lekho\n\nthey wrote\n\nFuture tense\n\n[edit]\n\nExample short phrases\n\n[edit]\n\nWords/phrases Transliteration Meaning जै देव Jai Dev Hello Formal. पैलाग Pailaag Hi/Hello (lit. touch your feet as a sign of respect used by younger members to greet older members) कस हेरे छे?
