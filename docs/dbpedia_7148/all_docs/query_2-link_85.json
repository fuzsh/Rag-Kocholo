        "text": "Hill station in Uttarakhand, India\n\nNot to be confused with Missouri.\n\nHill Station in Uttarakhand, India\n\nMussoorie is a hill station and a municipal board, in Dehradun city in the Dehradun district of the Indian state Uttarakhand. It is about 35 kilometres (22 mi) from the state capital of Dehradun and 290 km (180 mi) north of the national capital of New Delhi. The hill station is in the foothills of the Garhwal Himalayan range. The adjoining town of Landour, which includes a military cantonment, is considered part of \"greater Mussoorie\", as are the townships Barlowganj and Jharipani.[3]\n\nMussoorie is at an average altitude of 2,005 metres (6,578 ft). To the northeast are the Himalayan snow ranges, and to the south, the Doon Valley and Shiwalik ranges. The second highest point is the original Lal Tibba in Landour, with a height of over 2,275 m (7,464 ft). Mussoorie is popularly known as The Queen of the Hills.[4][5]\n\nIn the recent years, Mussoorie has again gained popularity as an upcoming travel destination with many attractions such as Camel's back road, Dhanaulti, Lal Tibba, etc. Uttarakhand Government reported 3.02 million (30.23 Lacs) travelers to Mussoorie in 2019.[6]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMussoorie has long been known as Queen of the Hills. The name Mussoorie is often attributed to a derivation of mansÅ«r, a shrub which is indigenous to the area. The town is often referred to as Mansuri by Indians.[7]\n\nIn 1803 the Gorkhas under Umer Singh Thapa conquered the Garhwal and the Dehra, whereby Mussoorie was established. On 1 November 1814, a war broke out between the Gorkhas and the British. Dehradun and Mussoorie were evacuated by the Gorkhas by the year 1815 and were annexed to the district of Saharanpur by 1819.\n\nMussoorie as a resort was established in 1825 by Captain Frederick Young, a British military officer. With F. J. Shore, the resident Superintendent of Revenues at Dehradun, who explored the region and built a shooting lodge on Camel's Back Road.[8] Young became a magistrate of Doon in 1823. He raised the first Gurkha Regiment and planted the first potatoes in the valley. His tenure in Mussoorie ended in 1844, after which he served in Dimapur and Darjeeling, later retiring as a General and returning to Ireland.[9][citation needed] There are no memorials to commemorate Young in Mussoorie. However, there is a Young Road in Dehradun on which ONGC's[10] Tel Bhawan[clarification needed] stands.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1832, Mussoorie was the intended terminus of the Great Trigonometric Survey of India that began at the southern tip of the country. Although unsuccessful, the Surveyor General of India at the time, George Everest, wanted the new office of the Survey of India to be based in Mussoorie; a compromise location was Dehradun, where it remains.[citation needed] The same year the first beer brewery at Mussoorie was established by Sir Henry Bohle as \"The Old Brewery\". The brewery opened and closed twice before it was re-established by Sir John Mackinnon as Mackinnon & Co. in 1850.[11]\n\nBy 1901, Mussoorie's population had grown to 6,461, rising to 15,000 in the summer. Earlier, Mussoorie was approachable by road from Saharanpur, 58 miles (93 km) away. Accessibility became easier in 1900 with the railway coming to Dehradun, thus shortening the road trip to 21 miles (34 km).[12]\n\nThe Nehru family, including Nehru's daughter Indira (later Indira Gandhi) were frequent visitors to Mussoorie in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, and stayed at the Savoy Hotel.[13] They also spent time in nearby Dehradun, where Nehru's sister Vijayalakshmi Pandit ultimately settled full-time.[14]\n\nOn 20 April 1959, during the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion, the 14th Dalai Lama took up residence at Mussoorie, this until April 1960 when he relocated to Dharamsala in Himachal Pradesh,[15] where the Central Tibetan Administration is today headquartered.\n\nThe first Tibetan school was established in Mussoorie in 1960. Tibetans settled mainly in Happy Valley. Today, about 5,000 Tibetans live in Mussoorie.[16]\n\nGeography and climate\n\n[edit]\n\nMussoorie has an average elevation of about 2,005 metres (6,578 ft). The highest point is \"Lal Tibba\", at a height of about 2,275 m (7,464 ft), although the name Lal Tibba is now also used to describe a lookout point, a short distance from the peak.\n\nMussoorie has a fairly typical subtropical highland climate (KÃ¶ppen Cwb) for the mid-altitude Himalaya. Summers are warm and very wet, with July and August averaging approximately 660 millimetres (26 in) of rain per month due to orographic lift of the extremely moist monsoonal air. The pre-monsoon seasons in April and May is warm and generally dry and clear, giving way to heavy rainfall from mid-June, while the post-monsoon season is also dry and clear but substantially cooler. In winter, rainfall is a little more frequent than in the pre-and post-monsoon seasons, and the general weather cool and partly cloudy. Mussoorie usually receives a few spells of snowfall in December, January and February, although the number of snowy days has come down in recent years due to a combination of local and global factors, such as deforestation, construction activity and global warming.[citation needed] Between October and February the town shows the rare \"winterline\" phenomenon.[17]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Mussoorie Municipal Council[20][21][22][23] is the civic or urban local body that governs the city. It is essentially the city government and differs from the MDDA (Mussoorie Dehradun Development Board), which is a state run organisation.\n\nThis corporation consists of 13 wards and is headed by a Chairman who presides over a deputy chairman and 12 other corporators representing the wards. The Chairman is elected directly through a first-past-the-post voting system and the deputy chairman is elected by the corporators from among their numbers.\n\nThe council is composed of elected officials like the mayor and corporators, administrative officials, like the Executive Officer and technical officers who have expertise in various domains.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2011 India census,[24] Mussoorie had a population of 30,118. Males constitute 55% of the population and females 45%. Mussoorie has an average literacy rate of 89%, higher than the national average of 75%: male literacy is 94%, and female literacy is 84%. In Mussoorie, 9% of the population is under 6 years of age. In Mussoorie Nagar Palika Parishad, female sex ratio is of 812 against the state average of 963. Moreover, the child sex ratio in Mussoorie is around 918 compared to Uttarakhand state average of 890.\n\nLandmarks\n\n[edit]\n\nTourism, concentrated during summer and winter, is the most significant segment of the Mussoorie economy.\n\nBhadraj Temple\n\n[edit]\n\nBhadraj Temple is a famous temple in Yamuna Valley.

It would be preferable to trek from Clouds End to Dudhli village. The trek from Dudhli village to the Temple is about 5 km in steep gradient.\n\nDhanaulti\n\n[edit]\n\nDhanaulti is a hill station located 24 km (15 mi) away from Mussoorie. The Doon Valley and snow-covered Garhwal Himalayas can be viewed from there.\n\nCamel's Back Road\n\n[edit]\n\nCamel's Back Road incorporates a nature walk.

The earlier Lal Tibba peak had a fixed large binocular through which one could see the snow clad peaks of Himalayas that lies to the north. After the construction of TV Tower the binocular was shifted on the Landour ridge towards west which is now named as Lal Tibba and is located near \"Childer's Lodge\".\n\nGun Hill\n\n[edit]\n\nGun Hill is the second highest point of Mussoorie, at an altitude of 2,024 m (6,640 ft) and at , and is accessed by cable car constructed from the Mall road.

The Britishers on their way to and from Mussoorie to Chakrata camped at the falls for tea and therefore the name Camp Tea became Kempty.[citation needed]\n\nLake Mist\n\n[edit]\n\nAbout 5 km (3 mi) before Kempty Falls on the Mussoorie-Kempty road is Lake Mist, through which flows the Kempty river with its numerous small waterfalls. The resort of Lake Mist provides accommodation, restaurant facilities and boating.\n\nMunicipal Garden\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Municipal Garden provides an artificial mini-lake with paddle boats.

It has been run by the Patrician Brothers since 1893. Spread over 400 acres (1.6 km2), the school is popularly referred to as 'Manor House'. Over the years, its alumni have made distinguished contributions in several fields, especially in serving the armed forces of the nation. The school's imposing facade stands out as one of the main architectural attractions of Mussoorie.[35]\n\nWoodstock School is a Christian, international, co-educational, residential school in Landour, a small hill station contiguous with the town of Mussoorie, Uttarakhand, India. The school traces its origin to the 1850s when a group of English ladies were enlisted by British officers and American missionaries to provide a Protestant education for girls.[citation needed]\n\nWoodstock is among the most well-known boarding schools of the Indian Subcontinent, said by some to be the best international school in India. (Others are the Kodaikanal International School and the Hebron School, Ooty, both in South India.) The school has a campus spread over an area of about 250 acres (1 km2) and is in a forest region with a variety of flora including pine, rhododendron, and oak. The terrain of the campus has an altitude range of 350 metres (1,150 ft) from its lowest point to the highest point. Classes at Woodstock begin from ECP (Early Childhood Program) and follow up to grade 12.\n\nOak Grove School stands out from the other notable institutions of Mussoorie for two reasons. First, it is affiliated with the CBSE, New Delhi, which is a rarity amongst the residential schools of Mussoorie. Second, it is a secular government-aided school, run by the Northern Railway. The school was founded in 1888 by the East Indian Railway (EIR) and passed to the Indian Railways when railways were nationalised after Independence. It has three semi-independent wings and is on two hills in Jharipani, 8 km (5 mi) from Mussoorie town, near the famous Jharipani fall.[citation needed]\n\nWynberg Allen School, established in 1888, is a well-known school which ranks amongst the finest in the country. In Kanpur, during the year 1887, a group of friends, Mr. Alfred Powell, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Foy and Brigadier J H Condon met and decided to set up a school in Mussoorie. The school was built at Jabarkhet along the Tehri road and was later shifted to the present Wynberg Estate. The object was to provide for and give to children, wholly or partly of European descent, an education based on Protestant Christian principles; to maintain such children; and to give them an academic and practical training conducive to economic welfare and happiness. It now accommodates students of all descents.[35]\n\nThe school consists of two branchesâthe Junior branch (Wynberg) and the Senior branch (Allen) and accommodates around 700 children. The school has four houses: Allen, Powell, Foy and Condon. A student from the institution is referred to as an \"Alwynin.\"[citation needed]\n\nThe Convent of Jesus and Mary, Waverley, Mussoorie was established in 1845 by the Religious Sisters of Jesus and Mary Mussoorie Educational Society.\n\nThe school is conducted by the Religious Sisters of Jesus and Mary. It is an all-girls school and perhaps the oldest Convent school in India. Waverley is at an elevation of 7,000 feet (2,100 m) above sea level on one of the healthiest, most extensive and well wooded hills of Mussoorie. The Jesus and Mary congregation was the first congregation of Sisters to come to the north in 1842 at the invitation of Bishop Borghi the Vicar Apostolic of the Agra Mission. The Archbishop requested the sisters to come to Mussoorie to start a school for girls. In 1845 the sisters came to Mussoorie. The estate of Waverley belonging to an Italian gentleman had just come into the market and the nuns bought it. That year saw the commencement of one of the most important Catholic educational institutions in the North of India. Thousands of girls, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, have since passed through Waverley. The small inadequate bungalow which was all the accommodation at first offered, has given place to a group of tastefully conceived buildings which dominate the town of Mussoorie.[35]\n\nGuru Nanak Fifth Centenary School (GNFCS) is another one of Mussoorie's well-known schools and one of the best boarding establishments in India. Previously owned by the Seventh-day Adventists and known from 1922 to 1969 as Vincent Hill School, GNFCS purchased the land and extensive buildings and founded an international school in the sacred memory of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, on the occasion of His 500th birth anniversary, celebrated in November 1969. The girls are housed at Shangri La at 6,750 feet (2,057 m) above sea level on an 11-acre (45,000 m2) plot, wooded with cypress, cedar and oak, on the south and west, facing the snow clad Himalayan peaks, to the north. The boys are at Vincent Hill: It is 3 km (2 mi) from the Library Chowk. Surrounded by picturesque scenery and upgrading the old Vincent Hill School, it comprises a campus spread over 45 acres (180,000 m2). The GNFCS prepares students in accordance with the 10+2 formula for school education, for the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (10 year course) examination and the Indian School Certificate (12 year course) examination.\n\nOther schools in Mussourie include Mussoorie International School (founded in 1984),[37] Mussoorie Modern School,[38] Tibetan Homes, CST Mussoorie and St Clares Convent School.[39]\n\nMussorie has the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration,[40] the premier training institute for officers of the Indian Foreign Service, Indian Administrative Service and other civil services. This unique institute is about 2 km (1 mi) from Gandhi Chowk.\n\nThe library area houses the academy of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force, a central police organization belonging to the Government of India. The academy was moved to this location in 1978, consequent upon reorganization of the force, and located at two separate patches of land known as Cainville Estate (Adminb wing) and Astel estate (Combat wing) The academy has grown over the years so as to take friendly foreign countries officers as its trainees.[41]\n\nThe academy also serves the local inhabitants as the first-responder in any major or minor rescue and relief work. The Director of the academy (as in December 2023) is Sriram Taranikanti.[42]\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nThe economy in Mussoorie is primarily dependent on tourism. Tourists come primarily from New Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and other northern states. In Mussoorie itself, there were 2,794,108 domestic tourist arrivals and 1865 foreign arrivals in 2017.[43] There is a projected 58.5% growth forecast in foreign tourist arrivals due to EVisa nationally.[44] Educational institutions are another contributor to the local economy. The Uttarakhand Government has created investment proposals for the development of a mountain forest resort and a development of ropeways in order to boost tourism in the region. The ropeway which was inaugurated on 6 March 2019 is being built is completed in 2022.[45]\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nMussoorie is connected by road to Delhi and major cities. It is called the \"Gateway\" to Yamunotri and Gangotri shrines of Northern India.[46] The nearest Airport Jolly Grant in Dehradun is 60 km (37 mi) away from the city[47] The closest rail station is Dehradun. Within Mussoorie are taxis and buses. A ropeway between Purkul Gaon, Dehradun and Mussoorie is in the works.[45] This rope way is projected to reduce traffic congestion and increase tourist footfall to Mussoorie.\n\nMussoorie and Landour, 1860s\n\nHampton Court School\n\nMussoorie at night.\n\nKempty Water Fall, Mussoorie (in winter)\n\nThe Ropeway/Cable Car is a tourist attraction in Mussoorie\n\nA view of Dehradun from Mussourie\n\nView of the Hills in Mussoorie Towards Sunset\n\nA video of sightseeing while driving on the roads at Mussoorie\n\nHimalayas at dusk from Mussoorie, Uttarakhand\n\nView of Dehradun from Mussoorie at Night\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nSir George Everest\n\nRuskin Bond\n\nBill Aitken (writer)\n\nTom Alter\n\nAnita Desai\n\nSaira Banu\n\nJamila Gavin\n\nStephen Alter\n\nNayantara Sahgal\n\nMartha Chen\n\nVictor Banerjee\n\nSaeed Jaffrey\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
