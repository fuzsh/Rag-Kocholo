The various traditions, religions, fairs, festivals, folk dances, music are what distinctly separate them.\n\nGarhwali Culture\n\nGarhwali is the main language spoken here that has a number of dialects too including Jaunsari, Marchi, Jadhi and Sailani. Garhwal is inhabited by people belonging to a number of ethnic groups and castes. These include Rajputs who are believed to belong to the Aryan origin, Brahmins who migrated after the Rajputs or later, tribals of Garhwal who stay in the Northern tracts and comprise of Jaunsaris, Jadhs, Marchas and Van Gujars.\n\nKumaoni Culture\n\nThe people of Kumaon speak 13 dialects including Kumaiya, Gangola, Soryali, Sirali, Askoti, Danpuriya, Johari, Chaugarkhyali, Majh Kumaiya, Khasparjia, Pachhai and Rauchaubhaisi. This group of languages is known as the group of Central Pahari languages. Kumaon is also rich in its folk literature which comprises myths, heroes, heroines, bravery, Gods, Goddesses and the characters drawn from Ramayana and Mahabharatha. The most popular dance form of Kumaon is known as Chhalaria and it is related to the martial traditions of the region. All the festivals are celebrated with a lot of enthusiasm and witness such traditional dance forms even today.\n\nFestivals of Uttarakhand\n\nKumaoni Holi is celebrated in three forms namely Baithki Holi, Khari Holi and Mahila Holi. The unique feature about this festival is that it is celebrated with a lot of music.\n\nHarela is a festival that marks the beginning of the rainy season or monsoon. The people belonging to the Kumaon community celebrate this festival during the month of Shravana, i.e., July-August. This festival is followed by Bhitauli, which is celebrated in the month of Chaitra, i.e., March - April. It revolves around agriculture where women sow seeds in the soil and by the end of the festival they reap the harvest which is called harela.\n\nJageshwar fair is carried out in the temple of Lord Shiva in Jageshwar on the fifteenth day of Baisakh month which is the period extending from late March to early April. People take a dip in the pool known as Brahma Kund as a kind of belief during the fair.\n\nKumbh Mela is one of the biggest and the most popular festival of Uttarakhand.

The most commonly worn lower garment is either a Dhoti or a Lungi. Various coloured Kurtas are worn as the upper garment. In addition, headgear or a turban is a must add-on to complete this traditional costume. Kurta-Pyjama is another very famous alternative for the men of Uttarakhand. Women, as well as men, wear woollen jackets as well as sweaters in the winter season.\n\nTraditional Dress Of Women\n\nGhagri is a long skirt that is worn by mostly all the women of Uttarakhand. It is complemented with a beautiful coloured Choli which is an Indian blouse and a cloth covering the head i.e., an Orni. This Orni is generally fixed firmly to the waist. This is the traditional dress of the women of both Garhwalis as well as Kumaonis. Ghagra-Pichora is the traditional bridal costume of the Kumaoni women which is similar to the Ghagra Lehenga-Choli. Pichora is a Kumaoni covering (more like a veil) that is decorated with gold and silver embroidery.\n\nUttarakhand is thus a hub of different traditions, ethnic groups and languages brought together.
