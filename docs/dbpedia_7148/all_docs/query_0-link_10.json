For climatic regions, see Climate of India § Regions.\n\nThe administrative divisions of India are subnational administrative units of India; they are composed of a nested hierarchy of administrative divisions.\n\nIndian states and territories frequently use different local titles for the same level of subdivision (e.g., the mandals of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana correspond to tehsils of Uttar Pradesh and other Hindi-speaking states but to talukas of Gujarat, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu).[1]\n\nThe smaller subdivisions (villages and blocks) exist only in rural areas. In urban areas, urban local bodies exist instead of these rural subdivisions.\n\nTiers of India\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Local government in India\n\nThe diagram below outlines the six tiers of administrative divisions:\n\nCountry\n\n(India) State\n\n(e.g. West Bengal State) Division\n\n(e.g. Presidency Division) District\n\n(e.g. North 24 Parganas District) Sub-district\n\n(Subdivision, Tehsil/Taluka)\n\n(e.g. Basirhat Subdivision) Block\n\n(e.g. Basirhat II Block) Village\n\n(e.g. Chaita village)\n\nZones and regions\n\n[edit]\n\nZones\n\n[edit]\n\nThe states of India have been grouped into six zones having an Advisory Council \"to develop the habit of cooperative working\" among these States. Zonal Councils were set up vide Part-III of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. The North Eastern States' special problems are addressed by another statutory body - The North Eastern Council, created by the North Eastern Council Act, 1971.[2] The present composition of each of these Zonal Councils is as under:[3]\n\nNorthern Zonal Council, comprising Chandigarh, Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Punjab, and Rajasthan;\n\nNorth Eastern Council, comprising Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura; The State of Sikkim has also been included in the North Eastern Council vide North Eastern Council (Amendment) Act, 2002 notified on 23 December 2002.[4]\n\nCentral Zonal Council, comprising the States of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh;\n\nEastern Zonal Council, comprising Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, and West Bengal;\n\nWestern Zonal Council, comprising Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Goa, Gujarat, and Maharashtra;\n\nSouthern Zonal Council, comprising Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana.\n\nAndaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep are not members of any of the Zonal Councils.[5] However, they are presently special invitees to the Southern Zonal Council[6]\n\nCultural zones\n\n[edit]\n\nEach zone has a zonal headquarters where a zonal cultural center has been established.[7] Several states have membership in multiple zones, but no state subdivisions are utilized in the zonal divisions. In addition to promoting the culture of the zones they are responsible for, each zonal center also works to cross-promote and create exposure to other cultural zones of India by organizing functions and inviting artistes from other zones.\n\nZone Zonal Centre Extent South Culture Zone South Zone Cultural Centre, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala,

Instead, they're directly split into districts for administrative purposes.\n\nAs of September 2022, divisions exist in 18 of the 28 states and 3 of the 8 union territories. As of September 2022, there are a total of 102 divisions in India.\n\nThis section is transcluded from List of divisions in India.\n\nNo. of divisions in each state or UT State/union territory No. of divisions Population[53] Population per division Andhra Pradesh - 49,386,799 - Arunachal Pradesh 3 1,383,727 461,242 Assam 5 31,169,272 6,233,854 Bihar 9 104,099,452 11,566,606 Chhattisgarh 5 25,545,198 5,109,040 Goa - 1,458,545 - Gujarat - 60,439,692 - Haryana 6 25,351,462 4,225,244 Himachal Pradesh 3 6,864,602 2,288,201 Telangana - 35,193,978 - Jharkhand 5 32,988,134 6,597,627 Karnataka 4 61,095,297 15,273,824 Kerala - 33,406,061 - Madhya Pradesh 10 72,626,809 7,262,681 Maharashtra 6 112,374,333 18,729,056 Manipur - 2,721,756 - Meghalaya 2 2,966,889 1,483,445 Mizoram - 1,097,206 - Nagaland 1 1,978,502 1,978,502 Odisha 3 41,974,218 13,991,406 Punjab 5 27,743,338 5,548,668 Rajasthan 7 68,548,437 9,792,634 Sikkim - 610,577 - Tamil Nadu - 72,147,030 - Tripura - 3,673,917 - Uttar Pradesh 18 199,812,341 11,100,686 Uttarakhand 2 10,086,292 5,043,146 West Bengal 5 91,276,115 18,255,223 Andaman and Nicobar Islands - 380,581 - Chandigarh - 1,055,450 - Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu - 586,956 - Jammu and Kashmir 2 12,258,433 6,129,217 Ladakh 1 290,492 290,492 Lakshadweep - 64,473 - Delhi 1 16,787,941 16,787,941 Puducherry - 1,247,953 - Total 103 1,210,854,977 11,755,874\n\nRegions within states\n\n[edit]\n\nSome states consist of regions, which have no official administrative governmental status. They are purely geographic regions; some correspond to historic countries, states or provinces. A region may comprise one or more divisions, averaging about three divisions per region. However, the boundaries of the regions and the boundaries of the divisions do not always coincide exactly. So far there has been no movement to give the regions official administrative status. If this was to be done, it would presumably require that the boundaries of the regions be slightly modified so that they correspond exactly with their constituent districts.\n\nRegions of Assam\n\nRegions of Gujarat\n\nRegions of Maharashtra\n\nDistricts\n\n[edit]\n\nStates and territories (or divisions) are further subdivided into districts (zilla), of which there are 797 (as of Nov 2023).

The governmental bodies at the village level are called Gram Panchayat, of which there were an estimated 256,000 in 2002. Each Gram Panchayat covers a large village or a cluster of smaller villages with a combined population exceeding 500 Gram Sabha. Clusters of villages are also sometimes called Hobli or Patti.\n\nHabitations\n\n[edit]\n\nCertain governmental functions and activities - including clean water availability, rural development, and education - are tracked at a sub-village level.[63] These hamlets are termed \"habitations\". India is composed of 1,714,556 habitations [64] In some states, most villages have a single habitation; in others (notably Kerala and Tripura) there is a high ratio of habitations to villages.[65]\n\nMetropolitan area\n\n[edit]\n\nA metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighbourhoods, townships, cities, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic, and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns, and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.\n\nThe metropolitan cities of India are: Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad & Ahmedabad.\n\nHistorical administrative divisions\n\n[edit]\n\nChakla\n\nPargana\n\nSarkar\n\nSubah\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAutonomous administrative divisions of India\n\nCultural Zones of India\n\nStates and union territories of India\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
