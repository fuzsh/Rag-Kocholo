        "text": "For other uses, see Almora (disambiguation).\n\nTown in Uttarakhand, India\n\nAlmora (Kumaoni: Almāḍ) is a municipal corporation and a cantonment town in the state of Uttarakhand, India. It is the administrative headquarters of Almora district.[4] Almora is located on a ridge at the southern edge of the Kumaon Hills of the Himalaya range. The Koshi (Kaushiki) and Suyal (Salmale) rivers flow along the city and snow-capped Himalayas can be seen in the background.\n\nAlmora was founded in 1568.[5] by King Kalyan Chand;[6][7][8] however, there are accounts of human settlements in the hills and surrounding region in the Hindu epic Mahabharata[9] (8th and 9th century BCE[10]). Almora was the seat of Chand kings that ruled over the Kumaon Kingdom. It is considered the cultural heart of the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand.\n\nAccording to the provisional results of the 2011 Census of India, Almora had a population of about 179,000.[citation needed] Nestled within higher peaks of the Himalaya, Almora enjoys a year-round mild temperate climate. The town is visited by thousands of tourists annually from all over the world.[citation needed] There are 11 blocks (i.e. VikashKhand) in Almora district.[citation needed]\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nAlmora got its name from Bhilmora, a kind of sorrel (although some have tried to derive it from Berberis \"kilmora\"[11][12]), a short plant commonly found there[13] which was used for washing the utensils of the sun temple at Katarmal. The people bringing the Bhilmora/kilmora were called Bhilmori/Kilmori and later \"Almori\" and the place came to be known as \"Almora\".[14][15]\n\nWhen king Bhishm Chand laid the foundation of the town, he had initially named it Alamnagar. Prior to that, Almora was known as 'Rajapur' during the early phase of Chand rule.[16][17][18] The name 'Rajpur' is also mentioned over a number of ancient copper plates.[18] There is still a place called Rajpur in Almora.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAlmora was founded in 1568[19] by Kalyan Chand during the rule of the Chand dynasty.[20] Prior to that the region was under the control of Katyuri King Bhaichaldeo who donated a part of Almora to Sri Chand Tiwari.\n\nAccording to local tradition, the earliest inhabitants in Almora were Tewaris who were required to supply Sorrel daily for cleansing the vessels of the sun temple at Katarmal.[2]: 8 Ancient lore mentioned in Vishnu Purana and Mahabharata present primordial accounts of human settlements in the city.[2]: 8 The Sakas, the Nagas, the Kiratas, the Khasas and the Hunas are credited to be the most ancient tribes.[2]: 8 The Kauravas and Pandavas of the Hastinapur royal family were the next important princes from the plains who are said to have affected the conquest of these parts.[21]: 166 After the Mahabharata war the district seems to have remained for some time under the sway of the kings of Hastinapur whose authority was never more than nominal.[21]: 166 The actual rulers were the local chiefs of whom the Kulindas (or Kunindas) were probably strong in the southern and western part of the city.[2]: 8 The Khasas were another ancient people who belonged to an early Aryan stock and were widely scattered in those times.[21]: 167 They gave this region the name Khasadesha or Khasamandala.[2]: 8 [21]: 167\n\nThe next age was probably a period of many petty states rivalling each other for supremacy, which culminated in the inauguration of the noted and enduring dynasty of the Chands. Earlier than this, the Katyuris are recorded as the dominant clans in copper and stone engravings.[22] The Chand dynasty from their inception in 953 A.D. to their ouster in the late 18th century present a saga of strife, with a horrifying series of wars with the rulers of Garhwal culminating in the destruction of this prosperous land and establishment of inglorious Gurkha rule. This dynasty was peculiar in that it made Almora the seat of strongest hill power in 1563 A.D.[23] From that time onwards, the limits of the kingdom of Kumaon extended over the entire tracts of the districts of Almora and Nainital. Towards the end of the 17th century, the Chand Rajas again attacked the Garhwal kingdom, and in 1688, King Udyot Chand erected several temples at Almora, including Tripur Sundari, Udyot Chandeshwer and Parbateshwer, to mark his victory over Garhwal and Doti. The Parbateshwar temple was renamed twice, eventually becoming the present Nanda Devi temple.\n\nIn 1791, the Gorkhas of Nepal while expanding their kingdom westwards across the Kali River, invaded and overran Almora.[2]: 8 [24] In the meantime, the British were engaged in preventing the Gorkhas from over-running the whole of the northern frontier.[25] The Gorkha rule lasted for twenty-four years. Due to their repeated intrusion into British territories in the Terai from 1800 onwards, Lord Moira, the Governor-General of India, decided to attack Almora in December 1814,[26] marking the beginning of the Anglo-Gorkha war. The war that broke out in 1814[27][28] resulted in the defeat of the Gorkhas and subsequently led to the signing of the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816.[29]: 594 [30] According to the treaty, Nepal had to cede all those territories which the Gorkhas had annexed to the British East India Company. After the war, the old Lal Mandi fort, near Almora was renamed ‘Fort Moira’.\n\nUnlike neighbouring hill stations such as Nainital and Shimla, which were developed by the British,[31][32][33] Almora was developed long before by the Chand kings.[34] The place where the present cantonment is located was formerly known as Lalmandi.[18][35][36] Presently where the collectorate exists, the 'Malla Mahal' (Upper Court) of the Chand kings was located.[18][37] The site of the present District Hospital used to be 'Talla Mahal' (Lower Court) of the Chand rulers.[18][38] Almora had a population of 8,596 in 1901,[39] falling to 8,359 in 1921.[40]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nLocation\n\n[edit]\n\nAlmora is located at [41] in Almora district in Uttarakhand. It is situated 365 km north-east the national capital New Delhi and 415 km south-east of the state capital Dehradun. It lies in the revenue Division Kumaon[42] and is located 63 km north of Nainital, the administrative headquarters of Kumaon.[43] It has an average elevation of 1,604 m (5,262 ft) above mean sea level.\n\nAlmora is situated on a ridge at the southern edge of the Kumaon Hills[18] of the Central Himalaya range in the shape of a horse saddle shaped hillock. The eastern portion of the ridge is known as Talifat[44] and the western one is known as Selifat.[18] The Almora Market is situated at the top of the ridge, where these two, Talifat and Selifat jointly terminate.[18] It is surrounded by thick forests of pine, deodar and fir trees. Flowing alongside the city are the Koshi (Kaushiki) and Suyal (Salmale) rivers. The snow-capped Himalayas can be seen in the background.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe climate of Almora is characterised by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. The main seasons are summer from March to June, the monsoon season from July to October and winter from November to February. In summer, Almora is largely under the influence of moist, maritime airflow from the western side of the subtropical anticyclonic cells over low-latitude ocean waters. Temperatures are high and can lead to warm, oppressive nights. Summers are usually somewhat wetter than winters, with much of the rainfall coming from convectional thunderstorm activity; tropical cyclones also enhance warm-season rainfall in some regions. The coldest month is usually quite mild, although frosts are not uncommon, and winter precipitation is derived primarily from frontal cyclones along the polar front. The Köppen climate classification subtype for this climate is Cwa (Humid Subtropical Climate).[45]\n\nThe average temperature for the year in Almora is 23.5 °C or 74.3 °F.[46] This information is as per the Abaal Institute. The warmest month, on average, is June with an average temperature of 31.1 °C or 88.0 °F.[46] The coolest month on average is January, with an average temperature of 13.3 °C or 55.9 °F.[46] The average amount of precipitation for the year in Almora is 1,132.5 millimetres or 44.59 inches.[46] The month with the most precipitation on average is August with 330.3 millimetres or 13.00 inches of precipitation.[46] The month with the least precipitation on average is November with an average of 4.6 millimetres or 0.18 inches.[46] There are an average of 46.8 days of precipitation, with the most precipitation occurring in August with 11.9 days and the least precipitation occurring in November with 0.6 days.[46]\n\nFlora and fauna\n\n[edit]\n\nThe region is immensely rich with 4000 species of plants, having remarkable diversity in its natural vegetation by virtue of its having a great range of elevation. Climatic variations, particularly in temperature and precipitation associated with the alignment and elevation of its ranges and valleys, determine the altitudinal growth and variety of vegetation. The flora of this region may be classified into tropical, Himalayan sub-tropical and subalpine and alpine vegetation. The alpine and sub-alpine zones are considered as the most natural abode of the largest number of medicinal plants.\n\nThe sub-alpine zones of Almora and outskirts are a natural sanctuary for leopard, Langur, Himalayan black bear, kakar, goral, etc. Whereas the high altitude zones abound musk deer, popularly called \"Kastura Mrig\", snow leopard, blue sheep, thar, etc. The entire zone is rich in a remarkable variety of birds possessing plumage of magnificent design and colours like the peacock, and which also includes the grey quail, black francolin/kala titar, whistling thrush, chakor, monal, cheer pheasant, kokla, and Kalij pheasant.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical populationYearPop.±% 1871 6,260— 1881 7,390+18.1% 1891 7,826+5.9% 1901 8,596+9.8% 1911 10,560+22.8% 1921 8,359−20.8% 1931 9,688+15.9% 1941 10,995+13.5% 1951 12,757+16.0% 1961 16,602+30.1% 1971 20,881+25.8% 1981 22,705+8.7% 1991 28,051+23.5% 2001 32,358+15.4% 2011 35,513+9.8%Source: [2][47][48][49][50]\n\n<div style=\"border:solid transparent;background-color:initial;position:absolute;width:100px;line-height:0;\n\nAs of the 2011 India census , Almora has a population of 35,513 of which 18,306 are males, while 17,207 are females.[2]: 20 Out of the total population, The Almora Municipal Board has a population of 34,122,[51] while The Almora Cantonment Board has a population of 1,391.[52] The population of children in the age range of 0-6 years is 3,081, which is 8.67% of the total population of Almora.[2]: 20 The literacy rate of Almora city is 86.19%,[2]: 21 higher than the state average of 78.82%.
