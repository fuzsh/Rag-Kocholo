        "text": "17 min read\n\nWhy in News\n\nNITI Aayog has released the second edition of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) India Index (SDG Index 2.0).\n\nThe index documents the progress made by India’s States and UTs towards achieving the 2030 SDG targets.\n\n2020 will be the 5th anniversary of the adoption of SDGs by the United Nations (UN).\n\nWhat is Sustainable Development?\n\n‘Development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs’.\n\nThis most widely accepted definition of Sustainable Development was given by the Brundtland Commission in its report Our Common Future (1987).\n\nSustainable development (SD) calls for concerted efforts towards building an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future for people and planet.\n\nCore Elements of Sustainable Development\n\nThree core elements of sustainable development are economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. It is crucial to harmonize them.\n\nSustainable economic growth, achieving sustainable livelihood, living in harmony with nature and appropriate technology are important for sustainable development.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability:\n\nIt prevents nature from being used as an inexhaustible source of resources and ensures its protection and rational use.\n\nAspects such as environmental conservation, investment in renewable energy, saving water, supporting sustainable mobility, and innovation in sustainable construction and architecture, contribute to achieving environmental sustainability on several fronts.\n\nSocial Sustainability:\n\nIt can foster gender equality, development of people, communities and cultures to help achieve a reasonable and fairly-distributed quality of life, healthcare and education across the Globe.\n\nEconomic Sustainability:\n\nFocuses on equal economic growth that generates wealth for all, without harming the environment.\n\nInvestment and equal distribution of economic resources.\n\nEradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions.\n\nIntegration of Scientific and Traditional knowledge\n\nIf the people are able to contribute their local resources and practices into the process of change, the development becomes not only sustainable but also gets accelerated.\n\nCombined traditional and scientific knowledge is called community knowledge. Moving towards SD in many areas will require community knowledge.\n\nIndigenous knowledge is also a potential source for the conservation of biodiversity.\n\nSignificance of traditional knowledge has been recognised in India through initiatives such as National Ayush Mission (NAM) and the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL).\n\nGlobal issues Related to Sustainable Development\n\nInequitable growth of national economies (North-South Divide)\n\nLoss of Biodiversity: Despite mounting efforts over the past 20 years, the loss of the world’s biodiversity continues.\n\nClimate Change: As a global problem, climate change requires a global solution. Within climate change, particular attention needs to be paid to the unique challenges facing developing countries.\n\nTackling climate change and fostering sustainable development are two mutually reinforcing issues.\n\nIntellectual Property Rights (IPRs): There is a need for welfare for all rich and poor to have affordable access to the results of innovation that can lead to sustainable development.\n\nGlobal Initiatives on Sustainable Development\n\nThe Stockholm Conference,1972: It was the first step towards putting environmental concerns on the global agenda.\n\nIt resulted in the Stockholm Declaration which contained principles and an Action Plan containing recommendations for environmental policy.\n\nUNEP was set up in 1972 to serve as a catalyst in developing and coordinating an environmental focus in the programmes of other organisations.\n\nThe Earth Summit, 1992: This was a direct consequence of the Brundtland Commission’s Report. It was held in Rio de Janeiro. The results of the Conference were the following documents:\n\nThe Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)\n\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity\n\nThe Statement on Forest Principles\n\nThe Rio Declaration\n\nAgenda 21\n\nKyoto Protocol,1997\n\nRio +10, 2002: A 10-year assessment of the Rio outcomes (Rio +10) took the shape of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) held in Johannesburg.\n\nRamsar Convention, 1971\n\nThe World Heritage Convention, 1972: It identifies and conserves the world’s cultural and natural heritage. It draws up a list of ‘heritage sites’, which are cultural, natural or mixed areas of ‘outstanding universal value’ and therefore need to be preserved for all humanity.\n\nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), 1973\n\nConvention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), 1979\n\nVienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, 1985\n\nMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, 1987\n\nBasel Convention, 1989\n\nConvention on Biological Diversity,1992\n\nUnited Nations Convention to Combat Desertification,1994\n\nRotterdam Convention,1998\n\nStockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants,2001\n\nGlobal Tiger Forum,1993\n\nInternational Whaling Commission,1946\n\nMinamata Convention,2013\n\nClimate change mitigation strategies: Carbon sequestration, Carbon sink, Carbon Credit, Carbon trading, Carbon offsetting, Carbon Tax, Geo-engineering.\n\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)\n\nUN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD)\n\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)\n\nClimate Finance Architecture: Green Climate Fund (GCF), Adaptation Fund (AF) and Global Environment Facility (GEF)\n\nReducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) and REDD+\n\nParis Agreement 2015\n\nThe Clean Development Mechanism is a way to reduce greenhouse gases(GHGs ) emissions through efficient and sound technologies.\n\nGlobal Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture (GACSA)\n\nPartnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE)\n\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs):\n\nTo bring sustainable development in the mainstream United Nations (UN) launched the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and SDGs.\n\nThis universal, integrated and transformative agenda aims to spur actions that will end poverty and build a more sustainable world over the next 15 years.\n\nThere are 17 goals and 169 targets specific targets to be achieved by 2030. Reaching the goals requires action on all fronts – governments, businesses, civil society and people everywhere all have a role to play.\n\nSDGs are not legally binding.\n\nRoadblocks to Global Initiatives\n\nTo reconcile the assertion of ‘sovereignty’, by the member states with the growing environmental interdependence and the need for concerted action.\n\nFor ex: Overcoming the North-South divide is one of the major hurdles facing the international environmental protection regime.\n\nThe ‘North’ world has just over 20% of the world population but consumes 80% of the world’s energy; on the other hand, the ‘South’, comprising of the developing nations of the world is still struggling to provide for the basic needs for its population.\n\nMethods/ways to monitor and regulate global commons (Oceans, Space and Antarctica). Being nobody’s property may act as a disincentive for protection.\n\nRegional Initiatives\n\nRegional mechanisms are effective means for addressing trans-boundary issues such as atmospheric pollution and pollution of shared rivers and water bodies, which nations are unable to solve on their own. Regional mechanisms involve fewer transactional costs, are less time-taking and have higher chances of success.\n\nThe European Union (EU): It enforced certain environmental principles viz., preventive principle, subsidiarity principle, integrative principle, the polluter pays principle etc.\n\nASEAN has numerous environmental legal instruments.\n\nSAARC adopted Environment Action Plan (1997):\n\nComprehensive Framework on Disaster Management 2006-2015 was adopted in 2006 to address the specific needs of disaster risk reduction and management in South Asia.\n\nSAARC Convention on Cooperation on Environment has been ratified by all member states and entered into force in 2013.\n\nCommunity Initiatives\n\nA significant initiative towards sustainable development comes directly from the community level. NGOs create linkages between global and local needs and actors. They have played a role in negotiation, monitoring and implementation of environmental law and policy at all levels.\n\nIUCN, 1948 has helped draft or has provided a secretariat for several important international conventions.\n\nNational Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme (IPCC-NGGIP)\n\nThe WWF has played a major role in the evolution of the international conservation movement.\n\nTRAFFIC: The Wildlife Trade Monitoring Network,1976\n\nWetlands International\n\nGreenpeace uses research, lobbying and diplomacy as well as high-profile, ‘on-the-streets’ events, to draw attention to the environmental problems and to raise the level and quality of public debate.\n\nIn India, Biodiversity Act, 2002 is almost completely built on inputs from a network of NGOs working across the country.\n\nSimilarly, the Chipko Movement and Save the Silent Valley Movement were results of community efforts.\n\nRole of Cooperatives in sustainable development\n\nCooperative societies connect the people at the grassroots level to the highest level of the government.\n\nCooperatives and NGOs help considerably in the upliftment of the socio-economic conditions of the rural poor and also adopt environment-friendly technologies for their functioning and generate awareness among people regarding environmental issues.\n\nEx: In India, AMUL became the most successful cooperative movement for the sustainable development of rural poor by launching the Operation Flood.\n\nProgress and Challenges Ahead\n\nProgress\n\nAs per the Sustainable Development Goals Report, 2019\n\nExtreme poverty has declined considerably.\n\nThe under-5 mortality rate fell by 49 % between 2000 and 2017.\n\nImmunizations have saved millions of lives.\n\nThe vast majority of the world’s population now has access to electricity.\n\nCountries are taking concrete actions to protect our planet: marine protected areas have doubled since 2010.\n\nCountries are making concerted efforts to address illegal fishing.\n\n186 parties have ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change, and almost all have communicated their first nationally determined contributions.\n\nAbout 150 countries have developed national policies to respond to the challenges of rapid urbanization, and more than 70 countries and the European Union now have more than 300 policies and instruments supporting sustainable consumption and production.\n\nA wide range of other actors—international organizations, businesses, local authorities, the scientific community and civil society—have engaged with the SDGs in a manner that generates great hope for the coming decade.\n\nChallenges\n\nAs per the Sustainable Development Goals Report, 2019\n\nIncreasing inequality among and within countries requires urgent attention.\n\n3 out of every 4 stunted children live in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nYoung people are more likely to be unemployed than adults.\n\nBarriers in achieving gender equality.\n\nGlobal hunger has been on the rise after a prolonged decline.\n\nExtreme poverty declined from 36% in 1990 to 8.6% in 2018, but the pace of poverty reduction is starting to decelerate as the world struggles to respond to entrenched deprivation, violent conflicts and vulnerabilities to natural disasters.\n\nExtreme poverty is three times higher in rural areas than in urban areas.\n\n2018 was the fourth warmest year on record. Levels of CO2 concentrations continued to increase in 2018.\n\nNatural environment is deteriorating at an alarming rate.\n\nSea levels are rising.\n\nOcean acidification is accelerating. Ocean acidity is 26% higher than in pre-industrial times.\n\n1 million plant and animal species are at risk of extinction.\n\nLand degradation continues unchecked.\n\nVarious methodologies have been evolved to monitor the progress of SDGs.\n\nSustainable Development Index (SDI), 2019\n\nIt is released by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN).\n\nThe SDI seeks to help countries identify gaps that must be closed in order to achieve SDGs by 2030 and to identify priorities for early action.\n\nIndia ranked 115 out of 162 countries.\n\nGlobal Sustainable Development Report (GSDR), 2019\n\nIt is the first GSDR prepared by the United Nations. It is entitled “The Future is Now: Science for Achieving Sustainable Development”.\n\nIt evaluated progress on the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.\n\nThe report finds that the current development model is not sustainable, and the progress made is in danger of being reversed through worsening social inequalities and potentially irreversible declines in the natural environment that sustains us.\n\nThe amount of modern renewable energy in the total global energy supply has increased by an average of approx. 5% annually over the past decade. Meanwhile, since 2009 the price of renewable electricity (solar and wind) has dropped for five years in a row.\n\nWay Forward\n\nTo make the process of sustainable development feasible and operational, it is important to establish a common focus that can integrate the outlook and efforts of various participants in development, worldwide, realising the diversity, in terms of geography, society, economics, level of science and technology capabilities and capacities and education standards/levels.\n\nDeveloped countries need to change their production and consumption patterns, including by limiting the use of fossil fuels and plastics, and to encourage public and private investments that align with the SDGs.\n\nEnvironmental commons—such as the atmosphere, rainforests and oceans—must be safeguarded as crucial sources of ecosystem services and natural resources. All stakeholders must work together to conserve, restore and sustainably use natural resources.\n\nThe food system must undergo widespread changes to the infrastructure, cultural and societal norms, and policies that are supporting the current, unsustainable, status quo.\n\nThe much deeper, faster and more ambitious response is needed to unleash the social and economic transformation needed to achieve our 2030 goals.\n\nA far more optimistic future is still attainable only by drastically changing development policies, incentives and actions."
