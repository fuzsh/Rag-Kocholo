        "text": "Global Warming Definition\n\n“Global warming is a gradual increase in the earth’s temperature generally due to the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide, CFCs, and other pollutants. “\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Global Warming?\n\nCauses of Global Warming\n\nMan-made Causes of Global Warming\n\nNatural Causes of Global Warming\n\nEffects of Global Warming\n\nWhat is Global Warming?\n\nGlobal warming is the phenomenon of a gradual increase in the temperature near the earth’s surface. This phenomenon has been observed over the past one or two centuries. This change has disturbed the climatic pattern of the earth. However, the concept of global warming is quite controversial but the scientists have provided relevant data in support of the fact that the temperature of the earth is rising constantly.\n\nThere are several causes of global warming, which have a negative effect on humans, plants and animals. These causes may be natural or might be the outcome of human activities. In order to curb the issues, it is very important to understand the negative impacts of global warming.\n\nFor More Information On Global Warming, Watch The Below Video:\n\nLet us have a detailed study of global warming, its causes and its effects.\n\nAlso Read: Environmental Issues\n\nCauses of Global Warming\n\nFollowing are the major causes of global warming:\n\nMan-made Causes of Global Warming\n\nDeforestation\n\nPlants are the main source of oxygen. They take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen thereby maintaining environmental balance. Forests are being depleted for many domestic and commercial purposes. This has led to an environmental imbalance, thereby giving rise to global warming.\n\nUse of Vehicles\n\nThe use of vehicles, even for a very short distance results in various gaseous emissions. Vehicles burn fossil fuels which emit a large amount of carbon dioxide and other toxins into the atmosphere resulting in a temperature increase.\n\nChlorofluorocarbon\n\nWith the excessive use of air conditioners and refrigerators, humans have been adding CFCs into the environment which affects the atmospheric ozone layer. The ozone layer protects the earth surface from the harmful ultraviolet rays emitted by the sun. The CFCs have led to ozone layer depletion making way for the ultraviolet rays, thereby increasing the temperature of the earth.\n\nIndustrial Development\n\nWith the advent of industrialization, the temperature of the earth has been increasing rapidly. The harmful emissions from the factories add to the increasing temperature of the earth.\n\nIn 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change reported that the increase in the global temperature between 1880 and 2012 has been 0.9 degrees Celsius. The increase is 1.1 degrees Celsius when compared to the pre-industrial mean temperature.\n\nAgriculture\n\nVarious farming activities produce carbon dioxide and methane gas. These add to the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and increase the temperature of the earth.\n\nOverpopulation\n\nAn increase in population means more people breathing. This leads to an increase in the level of carbon dioxide, the primary gas causing global warming, in the atmosphere.\n\nNatural Causes of Global Warming\n\nVolcanoes\n\nVolcanoes are one of the largest natural contributors to global warming. The ash and smoke emitted during volcanic eruptions goes out into the atmosphere and affects the climate.\n\nWater Vapour\n\nWater vapour is a kind of greenhouse gas. Due to the increase in the earth’s temperature, more water gets evaporated from the water bodies and stays in the atmosphere adding to global warming.\n\nMelting Permafrost\n\nPermafrost is frozen soil that has environmental gases trapped in it for several years and is present below Earth’s surface. It is present in glaciers. As the permafrost melts, it releases the gases back into the atmosphere, increasing Earth’s temperature.\n\nForest Blazes\n\nForest blazes or forest fires emit a large amount of carbon-containing smoke. These gases are released into the atmosphere and increase the earth’s temperature resulting in global warming.\n\nAlso Read: Bergmann’s Rule\n\nEffects of Global Warming\n\nFollowing are the major effects of global warming:\n\nRise in Temperature\n\nGlobal warming has led to an incredible increase in earth’s temperature. Since 1880, the earth’s temperature has increased by ~1 degrees. This has resulted in an increase in the melting of glaciers, which have led to an increase in the sea level. This could have devastating effects on coastal regions.\n\nThreats to the Ecosystem\n\nGlobal warming has affected the coral reefs that can lead to the loss of plant and animal lives. Increase in global temperatures has made the fragility of coral reefs even worse.\n\nClimate Change\n\nGlobal warming has led to a change in climatic conditions. There are droughts at some places and floods at some. This climatic imbalance is the result of global warming.\n\nSpread of Diseases\n\nGlobal warming leads to a change in the patterns of heat and humidity. This has led to the movement of mosquitoes that carry and spread diseases.\n\nHigh Mortality Rates\n\nDue to an increase in floods, tsunamis and other natural calamities, the average death toll usually increases. Also, such events can bring about the spread of diseases that can hamper human life.\n\nLoss of Natural Habitat\n\nA global shift in the climate leads to the loss of habitats of several plants and animals. In this case, the animals need to migrate from their natural habitat and many of them even become extinct. This is yet another major impact of global warming on biodiversity.\n\nAlso Read: Deforestation\n\nTo know more about global warming, its definition, causes and effects, keep visiting the BYJU’S website or download BYJU’S app for further reference."
