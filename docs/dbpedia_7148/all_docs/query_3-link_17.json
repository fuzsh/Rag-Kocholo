        "text": "India is one of the major players in the agriculture sector worldwide and it is the primary source of livelihood for ~55% of India’s population. India has the world's largest cattle herd (buffaloes), the largest area planted for wheat, rice, and cotton, and is the largest producer of milk, pulses, and spices in the world. It is the second-largest producer of fruit, vegetables, tea, farmed fish, cotton, sugarcane, wheat, rice, cotton, and sugar. The agriculture sector in India holds the record for second-largest agricultural land in the world generating employment for about half of the country’s population. Thus, farmers become an integral part of the sector to provide us with a means of sustenance.\n\nConsumer spending in India will return to growth in 2021 post the pandemic-led contraction, expanding by as much as 6.6%. The Indian food industry is poised for huge growth, increasing its contribution to world food trade every year due to its immense potential for value addition, particularly within the food processing industry.\n\nThe Indian food processing industry accounts for 32% of the country’s total food market, one of the largest industries in India and is ranked fifth in terms of production, consumption, export and expected growth.\n\nFoodgrain production in India touched 330.5 million metric tonnes (MT) in 2022-23 (3rd Advance Estimate). India is the world’s 2nd largest producer of food grains, fruits and vegetables and the 2nd largest exporter of sugar. A total of 521.27 LMT rice has been anticipated for procurement for the upcoming KMS 2023-24, up from 496 LMT produced during the previous KMS 2022-23.\n\nAccording to Inc42, the Indian agricultural sector is predicted to increase to US$ 24 billion by 2025. Indian food and grocery market is the world’s sixth largest, with retail contributing 70% of the sales.\n\nAs per the First Advance Estimates for 2023-24 (Kharif only), total foodgrain production in the country is estimated at 148.5 million tonnes.\n\nRabi crop area has from 709.09 lakh hectares in 2022-23 to 709.29 lakh hectares in 2022-23.\n\nIn 2022-23 (as per the second advance estimate), India's horticulture output is expected to have hit a record 351.92 million tonnes (MT), an increase of about 4.74 million tonnes (1.37%) as compared to the year 2021-22.\n\nThe Agriculture and Allied industry sector witnessed some major developments, investments, and support from the Government in the recent past. Between April 2000-March 2024, FDI in agriculture services stood at US$ 3.08 billion.\n\nAccording to the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), the Indian food processing industry has cumulatively attracted a Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) equity inflow of about US$ 12.58 billion between April 2000-March 2024. This accounts for 1.85% of total FDI inflows received across industries.\n\nDuring 2023-24 (April-March), processed vegetables accounted for US$ 652.42 million, miscellaneous processed items accounted for US$ 1,652.22 million and processed fruits & juices accounted for US$ 970.93 million.\n\nRapid population expansion in India is the main factor driving the industry. The rising income levels in rural and urban areas, which have contributed to an increase in the demand for agricultural products across the nation, provide additional support for this. In accordance with this, the market is being stimulated by the growing adoption of cutting-edge techniques including blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), geographic information systems (GIS), drones, and remote sensing technologies, as well as the release of various e-farming applications.\n\nIn terms of exports, the sector has seen good growth in the past year. India’s agricultural and processed food products exports stood at US$ 35.18 billion in 2023-24 (April-December).\n\nThe exports for principal commodities in 2023-24 (April-March) were the following:\n\nMarine Product: US$ 7.37 billion\n\nBasmati and Non-Basmati Rice: US$ 10.43 billion\n\nSpices: US$ 4.25 billion\n\nBuffalo Meat: US$ 3.74 billion\n\nSugar: US$ 2.82 billion\n\nMiscellaneous processed items: US$ 1.65 billion\n\nOil Meal: US$ 1.71 billion\n\nThe agriculture sector in India is expected to generate better momentum in the next few years due to increased investment in agricultural infrastructure such as irrigation facilities, warehousing, and cold storage. Furthermore, the growing use of genetically modified crops will likely improve the yield for Indian farmers. India is expected to be self-sufficient in pulses in the coming few years due to the concerted effort of scientists to get early maturing varieties of pulses and the increase in minimum support price.\n\nIn the next 5 years, the central government will aim US$ 9 billion in investments in the fisheries sector under PM Matsya Sampada Yojana. The government is targeting to raise fish production to 220 lakh tonnes by 2024-25. Going forward, the adoption of food safety and quality assurance mechanisms such as Total Quality Management (TQM) including ISO 9000, ISO 22000, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and Good Hygienic Practices (GHP) by the food processing industry will offer several benefits.\n\nThrough the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI), the Government of India is taking all necessary steps to boost investments in the food processing industry in India. Government of India has continued the umbrella PMKSY scheme with an allocation of Rs. 4,600 crore (US$ 559.4 million) till March 2026.\n\nReferences: Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Department of Commerce and Industry, Union Budget 2021-22, 2022-23, Press Information Bureau, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Press Releases, Media Reports, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Crisil, Union Budget 2023-24, Economic Survey 2022-23.\n\n*As per 3rd advance estimates, PE- Provisional Estimates\n\nNote: Conversion rate used in April 2024, Rs. 1 = US$ 0.012"
