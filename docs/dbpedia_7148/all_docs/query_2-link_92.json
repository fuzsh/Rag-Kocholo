        "text": "This article is about the town. For the monastery, see Jyotir Math.\n\nTown in Uttarakhand, India\n\nJoshimath, also known as Jyotirmath, is a town and a municipal board in Chamoli District in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. Located at a height of 6,150 feet (1,875 m),[3] it is a gateway to several Himalayan mountain climbing expeditions, trekking trails and pilgrim centres like Badrinath.[4] It is home to one of the four cardinal pīthas established by Adi Shankara.[5]\n\nSince 7 February 2021, the area was severely affected by the 2021 Uttarakhand flood and its aftermath. The town is confirmed to be sinking due to its geographic location being along a running ridge.[6][7]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBetween the 7th and 11th centuries C.E., Katyuri kings ruled the area of varying extent from their capital at \"Katyur\" (modern day Baijnath) valley in Kumaon. The Katyuri dynasty was founded by Vashudev Katyuri. The ancient Basdeo temple at Joshimath is attributed to Vasu Dev.[8] Vasu Dev was of Buddhist origin, but later followed Brahminical practices and the brahminical practices of Katyuri kings in general is sometimes attributed to a vigorous campaign of Adi Shankara (788-820 CE).[8]\n\nAccording to Badri Datt Pandey in his book Kumaon Ka Itihas, Joshimath was the original capital of the Katyur dynasty before it moved to Kartikeyapur (modern day Baijnath). According to the story, king Vasudev was a devotee of Narsingh (avatar of lord Vishnu). One day he went hunting and lord Narsingh came to his home disguised. His wife offered food to the god. After eating the food the god went in the king's room for some rest. When the king returned from hunting he got angry after seeing a man sleeping in his bed. He took his sword and cut the left hand of god. Instead of blood, milk started flowing from the wound. After seeing this, the king realised the disguised person was not a common man. He asked for forgiveness from the god. The god said he came because he was happy with his kingdom but after this incident he cursed the king to move to a new location (Baijnath). Because of this wound, the statue in the temple will also have a weak left hand. When the statue's hand will fall off, this will be the end of his dynasty.[9]\n\nKatyuri kings were displaced by the Panwar dynasty in the 11th century AD.[8]\n\n2021 glacial outburst flood and aftermath\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2021 Uttarakhand flood\n\nA part of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off in Nanda Devi National Park in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district on 7 February 2021, causing flash flood in Rishiganga and Dhauliganga River, devastating among others the village Rini, the Dhauliganga Dam, the Rishi Ganga dam, Tapovan Vishnugad Hydropower Plant, killing and endangering people. According to media, at least 31 people were confirmed to have been killed and around 165 were reported missing after the flash flood. A PTI report put the number of workers missing at 150.[citation needed]\n\nIn the aftermath of the floods, residents began noticing cracks in homes; eventually over 600 houses were evacuated after a local temple collapsed.[10][11] Eventually over 700 of approximately 4,400-4,600 structures would show cracking and the streets and paved areas in the affected area also showed cracking.[12][13] Hundreds of residents were able to evacuate and authorities classified zones within the town as \"danger\", \"buffer\" and \"completely safe\" areas; demolition work began on 9 January 2023.[14][15]\n\nA two year study released in 2023 by the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing used satellite sensing to determine the area was sinking 6.5 cm (2.6 in) each year.[16][17]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2011 India census, there are total 3,898 families residing in Joshimath city. The total population of Joshimath is 16,709 out of which 9,988 are males and 6,721 are females.

There are 1127 male children and 976 female children between the age 0–6 years.

Their heads are titled \"Shankaracharya\". According to the tradition initiated by Adi Shankara, this matha is in charge of the Atharvaveda. Jyotirmath is close to the pilgrimage town of Badrinath. This place can be a base station for travellers going to Guru Gobind Ghat or the Valley of Flowers National Park. The temple Narasimha, is enshrined Badrinarayan along with a pantheon of deities. The presiding deity Lord Narasimha is believed to have been established by Adi Sankara. It is one of the \"Divya Desams\", the 108 temples of Vishnu revered by the 12 Tamil poet-saints or Alvars, and god and goddess are known as Parimalavalli sametha Paramapurusha Perumal.[21]\n\nJoshimath Cantonment\n\n[edit]\n\nJoshimath Cantonment is one of the important military stations of Indian Army, present in Uttarakhand. It is the permanent station of \"The Garhwal Scouts\", the scout battalion of the Garhwal Rifles. It is the closest army station to the Indo-Tibetan Border.

It has an idol of Lord Narsingh, which is considered established by Shankaracharya. As per local belief, the left hand of this idol has become as thin as hair. On the day when it will break, the mountains Nar - Narayan (नर - नारायण)(which are situated on a way to Badrinath) shall join and become one and Lord Badrinath of Badrinath temple will disappear from the present temple and re-appear as black stone (Shaligram) at new place called Bhavishya Badri, which is situated at a distance of 10 km from Joshimath. During the period when Badrinath temple remains closed during winter every year, an idol of Lord Badri is brought to Narsingh temple and worshiped for six months.[22]\n\nBhavishya Kedar Temple\n\n[edit]\n\nAs per local belief, present Kedarnath will disappear along with Badrinath and re-appear in Bhavishya Kedar temple at Joshimath.

Haridwar railway junction, 24 km farther from Rishikesh, has train connections to most of the major cities in India.\n\nJoshimath lies on national highway NH58 that connects Delhi with Badrinath and Mana Pass in Uttarakhand near the Indo-Tibet border.
