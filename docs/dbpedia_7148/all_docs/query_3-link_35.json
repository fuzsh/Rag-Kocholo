All Rights Reserved 60 RESEARCH ARTICLE Computational Dual-system Imaging Processing Methods for Lumbar Spine Specimens with Medical Physics Applications Francisco Casesnoves Independent Research Scientist Engineering-Physics-Software; International Association of Advanced Materials, Sweden; Uniscience Global Scientific Member, Wyoming, USA; Harjumaa, Estonia Received on: 25-10-2021; Revised on: 30-11-2021; Accepted on: 29-12-2021 ABSTRACT Based on previous studies, a comparative-series of improved imaging-computational for new/different lumbar cadaveric specimens was obtained with two systemsânamely Matlab and GNU-Octave. Algorithmic methods for program patterns are improved and developed. Results comprise a biomedical study of each and every lumbar cadaveric specimen with contrasted evaluation for both computational systems. Imaging processing methods for resolution in improved vertebral contrast/facets/positioning, vertebral-anatomical parts separation, visualization of lumbar spines, and different 3D imaging options available,areexplainedandproven.InClinicalMedicalPhysicsandComputationalAnatomicalPathology, these advances associated to improve previous imaging contributions and statistical data are demonstrated. Results show sharply the usage of Matlab and GNU-Octave imaging processing, programming codes/ patterns, and computer vision tools. Efficacious utility of these computational-software imaging methods, useful/appropriate for clear/detailed anatomical-clinical analysis, and comparisons among cadaveric specimens are illustrated along an imaging series. The anatomical dissection methods previously published obtain additional procedures/applications in lumbar vertebra study, statistics, and surgical tools manufacturing. Applications on Medical Physics, Biomedical Engineering, and Computational-Forensic Diagnosis are got from this dual cadaveric imaging systematic comparison. Matlab and GNU-Octave software 3D imaging methods utility are explained/extrapolated for other type of usages. Key words: Computational anatomical dissection, Image processing, Software engineering, Surfactal Programming, Computer aided design, Computer aided manufacturing, Anatomical cadaveric imaging simulations, Biomechanics, Bioengineering, Spinal computational-surgery, Spinal ligaments, Spinal anterior longitudinal ligament INTRODUCTION AND SPINAL BIOMECHANICS ANALYSIS A series of previous publications[1-12] in Surfactal computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM) presented 3D imaging methods to obtain biomechanical, clinical medical physics, anatomical systematic study, and forensic analysis of lumbar cadaveric specimens. The anatomy of vertebra differs systematically for every part of spine. The most dissimilar are the cervical ones, while thoracic and lumbar vertebras show more resemblance. Any vertebra can be characterized for a number Address for correspondence: Francisco Casesnoves, E-mail: casesnoves.research.emailbox@gmail.com of anatomical shape peculiarities. These are vertebral body, dimension, pedicles, facets, facet- curvature, ligaments that support it, ligament insertion zone, spinal cord channel size, geometry at different stages of lifetime, or any pathological/ non-pathological particular patient sign.[1] Moreover, during lifetime, the vertebra shape and histology experience changes together with the whole spine in general. Lumbar vertebra loads are about 500 N, and this biomechanical factor causes a significant deformation during lifetime. The changes of the intervertebral disks are more considerable as disks support these loads and have a deformable histological structure. Therefore, the bioinformatics study at every life stage can provide database for surgical theatre pre- and post-operative planning and/or instrumentation manufacturing.

Casesnoves: Computational Dual-system Imaging Processing Methods for Lumbar Spine Specimens with Medical PhysicsApplications AJCSE/Oct-Dec-2021/Vol 6/Issue 4 61 The spinal pathology study can obtain valuable data from the analysis of anatomical/physiological changes during average lifetime. Preventive and statistical medicine also gets substantial evidence from this database and CAD imaging analysis. CAD and CAM are widely used, for instance, for design of spinal prostheses, devices, tools, orthopedics apparatus, pediatric orthopedics, and spinal stabilization devices. That is, new prostheses, surgical-theatre tools, spinal screws, stabilization kits, artificial intervertebral disks, grips, etc., CAD, based on anatomical data, is useful/efficacious for accurate affix of spinal prostheses/devicesâfitting error and post-surgical complications are then reduced. This contribution differs from the former studies in objectives and results. That is, the paper aim is focused on computer vision tools and digital imaging processing usage for getting digital database from lumbar cadaveric specimens. Digital anatomical records from the imaging laboratory apparatus, for example, a scanner are important and constitute the first stage for these purposes. However, if they are not conveniently computationally analyzed/software-implemented to set high-quality representations/images with good numerical approximations database is not suitably managed. Figure 1 shows a CAD hyperbolic vertebral body model to set the cadaveric specimen digital data for a geometrical model of a hyperboloid.[10] Hence, this study proves how computer vision tools and image processing are efficacious to get/extract clinical information from lumbar cadaveric specimens. The characteristics that are studied are mainly lumbar spine specimen shape, vertebra pathology, arthrosis traces/damage, facet curvature and degeneration, vertebra and disk deformation, disk protrusion, pedicles, traces of ALL, ligaments, and other applicable data in clinical medical physics. All these methods are applied with two systems, Matlab and GNU- Octave. In addition, a comparative assessment of these two programming systems functionality is presented. In summary, this study shows usage/utility of a number of imaging processing and CAD vision tools to examine and extract medical-surgical information from lumbar cadaveric specimens. It is based on program codes, subroutines applications, options best optimization, and programming patterns. Two computational systems for these objectives are applied and contrasted, Matlab and GNU-Octave. Moreover, pre-hypotheses/ extrapolated applications for future clinical medical physics and surgical applications are suggested/explained. Results and images, system comparisons, and programming techniques can be considered acceptable both for bioengineering advances and lumbar/general spinal surgery applications. CLOUD DATA CADAVERIC SPECIMEN MATERIALS Matlab scanning cloud data As in previous studies,[3,8-12] a digital scanner apparatus was the experimental method to select numerical data. The laboratory method was obtained the cadaveric specimens cloud data of lumbar spines with the digital scanner, once the anterior part of the specimens was exposed to waves. The CAD surfactal fit was obtained from Figure 1: From,a polynomial computer aided design (CAD) model for a region of interest, of the vertebral body of a lumbar spine specimen. The polynomial fit was made with a CAD method taking the digital scanned data from the specimen\n\n3. Casesnoves: Computational Dual-system Imaging Processing Methods for Lumbar Spine Specimens with Medical PhysicsApplications AJCSE/Oct-Dec-2021/Vol 6/Issue 4 62 different and also previous anterior vertebral body anatomic samples. The cloud data of this experimental samples, as in,[3,8-12] were obtained using high resolution in the 3D Scanner Digitizer (high resolution was â10-7 m ). In most cases, the data obtained of the spine surfaces had â105 points for each specimen. For Matlab and GNU- Octave comparative study, the specimen 1 has about 16350 3D points. The specimen 2 has approximately 16300 3D cloud points. With interpolation algebraic methods, cloud point number is condensed from â105 to â104 to increase the visualization program image-set and speed. The reduction of pointâs algebraic method was performed by interpolation software, taking approximate middle points among intervals. In previous contributions, extent developments of the specimens for computational programs were carried out.[3-5,8-12] The objective was to interpolate the cloud data to optimize the imaging processing tools usage, and not all the specimens have the same interpolation parameters, since the 3D cloud data number differs for everyone. GNU-octave scanning cloud data For computational comparisons, a new specimen was added to contrast imaging vision processing between GNU-Octave and Freemat.This specimen was studied in Matlab in previous contributions.[3-8] Number of digital cloud 3D data is 14055. Cloud point number is reduced from â105 to â104 to increase the visualization program speed. This cloud data specimen was prepared exclusively to prove the functionality of GNU-Octave 3D imaging process. The previous sub-section data for specimens 1 and 2 were also programmed in GNU-Octave. MATHEMATICAL METHODS AND IMAGING SOFTWARE Both in Matlab and GNU-Octave, image processing, and computer vision tools were the principal implement to obtain the images and use the Matlab camera settings. For Matlab, the programming method was based on both classical 3D tools, and camera settingsâ, appropriate subroutines and a group of commands/sentences to set spinal 3D images accurately. For GNU- Octave, the camera images similar to Matlab require laborious task. Matlab and GNU-Octave programming techniques are based on previous contributions and literature.[2,4-16] In Matlab, the following imaging processing settings were used: Zoom, rolling, projections along axes, orbit, tilt, moving (horizontal, vertical, forward, backwards), definition of principal axes, imaging contrast and tiles size. In GNU-Octave, rotation, pan, text box, toggle, zoom in-out, and commands/options for color, tiles, image definition, etc. Table 1 shows a comparative set of Matlab and GNU-Octave reference-standard algorithms, functions, tools, and applications for image processing, analysis, visualization, and algorithm developments. For Matlab, the average running time for a cadaveric image was 2â10 s. For GNU-Octave, it is at least 15 s, depending of the amount of 3D subroutine options. In Matlab, the image tools time Table 1: Computer vision tools used for images. Upper, Matlab imaging processing methods. Lower, GNUâOctave imaging tools MATLAB computational image and vision techniques Vertebral length To be determined by number of cloud data and tiles size Lumbar spine positioning All projections along axes, orbit, tilt, moving (horizontal, vertical, forward, backward) Vertebral facets Projections along axes, orbit, tilt, moving (horizontal, vertical, forward, backward) Disks Projections along axes, orbit, tilt, moving (horizontal, vertical, forward, backward) Arthrosis osteopathy degeneration signs Contrast, tilt, zoom, very easy use and fast ALL Contrast, tilt, zoom, traces visualized along some vertebral specimens GNUâoctave computational image and vision techniques Vertebral length To be determined by number of cloud data and tiles size, can be guessed from axes information Lumbar spine positioning All projections along axes, rotation is easy, no orbit and tilt, moving (horizontal, vertical, forward, backward), Vertebral facets projections along axes, there is no orbit and tilt, moving (horizontal, vertical, forward, backward) Disks No camera projections along axes, no orbit or tilt, moving (horizontal, vertical, forward, backward) Arthrosis osteopathy degeneration signs Contrast, zoom is possible but more difficult than Matlab. It is clearly seen any pathological sign, as image is very clear. ALL Traces can be visualized along some vertebral specimens Image definition and text insertion Image can be considered very good, and Text can be inserted but text boxes are difficult and complicated to set Pan tool It works fast and provides with facility to displace the image along axes\n\n4.

It was obtained also with contour option and two methods. to start to work varies significantly. If a text box is inserted into image, it takes at least 15 s. A cursor numerical data extraction takes 5 s. In GNU- Octave, the image tools time to start to work was about 10â20 s. For Matlab, the positioning change speed of camera was about 1 s. The division of numerical intervals for tiles in complete lumbar specimen image was selected about 0.5 for optimal visualization and not long running time. In GNU- Octave, similar images to Matlab camera can be done, but it takes at least 15â20 s.

The compared anatomical- clinical details of facets, vertebra sizes and body, pathological signs, ligaments, length, and other are obtained along the images. Tables 2 and 3 show the imaging results summary. Figure 8 presents an special specimen form[3] that was implemented for imaging processing patterns. That specimen is specially longer and shows a sharp protrusion of all disks [Figures 9-11]. Figure 3: Matlab-Camera. Complete cranial-caudal image of specimen 1.

Clinical group ones are mainly for spinal surgery. These are from surgical operation tools manufacturing till implants, artificial disks, screws, stabilizers, pediatric orthopedics, intervertebral disc degenerative process diagnosis, bone structure degeneration-form, etc. Research-theoretical utility is related to all computational software and database for CAM and/ orCADobjectives.Thesecouldbeimplant-materials optimization, osseointegration optimization, any prostheses, implant, surgical-theatre conformal apparatus, or orthopedic stabilizers. Database- statisticalCADsoftwarefordiagnosis-studyofspinal pathologiesâfor example, incidence/prevalence of pediatric and youngsters spinal diseases evolution, professional diseases, elderly statistics for spinal diseases prevalence/incidence, or professional-risk of spinal damage. The CAM design of interfaces is essential. Interfaces of stabilizers, surgical tools, implants, prostheses and orthopedic apparatus have to fit as much optimal as possible. There are several types of clamps, grips and screws, namely, three-point shear clamp, lock screw (with end- on and tangential parts), circumferential grips, Figure 4: GNU-Octave-Method-1.-Complete cranial-caudal image of specimen 1, set to show the ALL traces at middle specimen. Image was set with GNU-Octave processing tools for showing better the facets. All facet imaging-visualization was optimized setting contrast and the tiles division and brightness-color appropriate numerical data in program. ALL traces can be also identified when the isolines lose definition. That means that the surface-variability of the non-smooth- surface ligament histological structure causes loss of isolines definition Figure 5: Matlab-Camera.-Complete cranial-caudal image of specimen 1, but tilted to show L5 and Sacrum zones.

Optimal interface-precision and bonding is indispensable.This property avoids complications, post-operation complications, locking mechanisms failures, malfunctionality, breaks, corrosion and tribocorrosion of interfaces, friction problems, erosion, abrasion, wear of materials, histocompatibility inmunological reactions, post- operative rehabilitation and pain, and a wide of unpredictable post-surgical complication chances. Deformity prevention and correction in the specialization of pediatric surgery CAM is more complicated in general than the adultâs one. The children organism and constitution is in dynamic-growing continuous evolution, and the physical activity of a child is higher than the adult in general. Computational Biomechanics and computational dissection CAD and CAM design constitutes an useful tool to resolve all these pediatric biomedical pathologies.

Results of this study contribute to this research/clinical field. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION In general, the comparative study has shown the imaging processing different methods with two systems. The objective is to obtain useful clinical and biomedical database from lumbar spine vertebral specimens. Therefore, the results of the paper have two main strands. The first comprises all the clinical and anatomical information that can be got from the CAD images. The second is the programming software improvements that are developed/compared with Matlab and GNU- Octave 3D imaging subroutines and processing tools, Figures 9-11. The biomedical information that can be guessed for the 3D imaging results is extent. Among them, general lumbar spine diagnosis/functionality, determinationofcurvatures,arthrosisdegeneration, signs, reumathological diseases signs, osteophites, facet smoothness, concavities geometrical data, angles of curvature, size of surfaces, and bone- degeneration/deformation of vertebras. The pathological signs of facets and disks, such as degeneration, asymmetry of facets and body shapes,ordiskherniationconstituteusefulimaging data. Specially, given the prevalence/incidence of surgical intervertebral disk pathology, the state diagnosis of the lumbar disks is important. Just to remind that the biomechanical loads at lumbar spine are the statistically highestâin magnitude order of at least 500 N.[13-19] As a whole, Matlab shows better facilities for 3D imaging implementation/usage. However, the differences with GNU-Octave are not excessive. All this assessment was presented in Sections 3â4. Both GNU-Octave and Matlab offer two types of 3D imaging subroutines with a large number of additional programming options for image contrast, tiles size, color choices, brightness, etc. However, the usage of all of these takes more running time in GNU-Octave than in Matlab. The 3D cloud data of the vertebras offers a number of research possibilities for data/imaging extraction. This yields to a number Medical Physics and Biomedical applications for CAM constitute the principal applications. These properties measurement are suitable for new prostheses, intervertebral disk database, spinal Table 4: Resume of biomedical and medical physics applications.

In brief, the research has proven the utility of imaging processing and computer vision techniques to obtain digital database from lumbar spine vertebral specimens. The biomedical and clinical medical physics applications are efficacious and wide. The software engineering for 3D imaging processing constitutes an advance for lumbar spine specimen CAD and CAM.
