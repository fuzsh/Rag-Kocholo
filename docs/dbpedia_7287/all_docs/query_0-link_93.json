        "text": "This index to the Collections and Journal of the Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society was prepared with the assistance and support of the PATHs program of Canada’s National History Society. They generously provided the Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society with two grants which underwrote the preparation of an index that included all of the materials the Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society has published since its inception in 1878. Canada’s National History Society is perhaps best known as the publisher of The Beaver. The entries are in the following format with the template information in normal typeface and the index supplied information in italics. Subject title. By author. In Collections or Journal Vol volume number, pp. pages. Type with/without documentation. Paper presented date. Eras: era1; era2. For this presentation format the citation for each article is repeated after each index point. The index also provided some information on the type of article or document that was published. The categories used are: Analytic study Bibliography Chronological Narrative Descriptive Narrative Document Genealogy Memoirs (1 st person voice) Obituary Review The articles were also categorized by the time period of the events that were related. The categories used were: Creation of planet to 1600 AD 1600 - 1758 [Acadian Nova Scotia] 1713 - 1867 [Colonial Nova Scotia] 1867 - 1914 1914 - 1945 1945 - The index also notes if the article is documented or not. Although endnotes or footnotes automatically placed an article in the documented category the absence of them did not necessarily label the article as without documentation."
