The Peters family lived at Garrison House until 1911, at which time Peters left his legal practice in Victoria and moved to Prince Rupert to become City Solicitor for this newly-created town. Garrison House was occupied by the Punnett family through the 1910s. From 1920 until 1931 Garrison House became Uppingham House, a private, preparatory school for girls. In 1932 the house was vacant and soon destroyed by fire. see The Honourable Frederick Peters, Uppingham House\n\nGent, K groceries and meats\n\n2164 McNeill Avenue (19381939 city directories)\n\nPrevious location of R D McCullough grocer Subsequent location of Reliable Grocery\n\nPhotos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nGeorge Lovitt shoe repair1163 Newport Avenue (1944 1949 city directories)\n\nSubsequent location of Newport Tailors & Cleaners\n\nPhotos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nGhosts two ghost stories keep haunting Oak Bay see Haunted House\n\nGibbard, Charles sixth principal of Oak Bay High School (19521962) Biographical material welcomed see Oak Bay High School Principals\n\nGibbs, P A reeve of Oak Bay (19501953)\n\nP A Gibbs\n\nBiographical material welcomed\n\nGibbs Road\n\nsee Street/Place Names section\n\nGibson, Wilfred H Jr photographer\n\n2186 Oak Bay Avenue (...1946 phone book)\n\nPortrait Photographer\n\n2186 Oak Bay . . . . . . . . .

Seeking experience, young Edward travelled widely (India, China, Japan, Canada) and offset expenses by selling his drawings along the way. Arriving in Victoria he married in 1937 and sold stocks and bonds. With the outbreak of World War II he served with the Royal Engineers. After the war he approached his art with renewed enthusiasm and published a pencil postcard series of Vancouver Island scenes that met with great success. In 1945 he purchased a beautiful home, Inchgarth, on Wilmot Place in Oak Bay and set up a studio in the coach house. From here his reputation grew. As much of his work reached people on post cards, Christmas cards and calendars, it tended to be commercial  usually scenes of familiar buildings and places. He shifted from the pencil drawings of his earlier work to water colour in his latter work, for which he was sought out for private commissions. Commissions from clients such as the Royal Canadian Navy, the C.P.R., the B.C. Government, the Illustrated London News and other publications allowed his work to be enjoyed by an international audience. His original work can be found today hanging in homes worldwide.\n\nGoodwin Street\n\nsee Street/Place Names section\n\nGonzales\n\nSt. Charles Street and Rockland Avenue 1885 home of Oak Bay's largest landowner, Joseph Despard Pemberton Although Joseph Depard Pemberton was Oak Bay's largest landowner, his 10,000 square foot home, Gonzales, was not situated in Oak Bay. It was built at the southeast corner of St. Charles Street and Rockland Avenue. With grounds extending down to the water, Gonzales boasted 20 rooms, five bathrooms, a conservatory, a billiards room, a writing room and a library. Gonzales became the residence of Norfolk House School in 1945 but was again sold in 1950, only to sit vacant until it was destroyed by fire while being razed in 1953.\n\nGonzales Bay (Foul Bay, Fowl Bay)see Street/Place Names section\n\nGonzales Hill\n\nsee Street/Place Names section\n\nGonzales Hill Cairn a tribute to early navigators\n\nRBCM & A | G-05338\n\nGonzales Hill Cairn\n\nProfile under development\n\nGonzales Farm\n\n1 The Victoria Golf Club first leased a portion on this property in 1893 with the proviso that Pemberton's cows had the exclusive use of the course for grazing during the summer months.\n\nGonzales Point\n\nsee Street/Place Names section\n\nGordon, M P reeve of Oak Bay (19161917)\n\nM P Gordon\n\nBiographical material welcomed\n\nGoring's Confectionery\n\n2284 Cadboro Bay Road (19471949 phone books)\n\nPrevious location of Newall's Confectionery Subsequent location of Blake's Confectionery\n\nPhotos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nGranite Street\n\nsee Street/Place Names section\n\nGrant, Mrs G chocolate shop 1179 Newport Avenue (1921 city directory) Photos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nGravel Pits One of Oak Bay's first priorities as a new municipality in 1906 was road building.

Aside from the tricycle shed to which everyone ran for a chance to get first pick during outdoor time, most of my memories involve the minor calamities that befell us there:  Erica Fowles, OBHS class of 1965\n\nBy 1967 the Greater Victoria Nursery School had relocated to 1075 Joan Crescent\n\nPhotos, artifacts and recollections welcomed\n\nGreatford Placesee Street/Place Names section"
