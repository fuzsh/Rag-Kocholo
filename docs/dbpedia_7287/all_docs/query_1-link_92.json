        "text": "The following, arranged chronologically by birth date,\n\nare among the more prominent people in the history of Nova Scotia:\n\nMostly from the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online\n\nand Members of the Order of Canada\n\nPierre du Gua de Monts (1558?-1628)\n\n[Not to be confused with Sieur de Monts (floruit 1662)]\n\nDespite the tremendous contribution made by this far-seeing and broadminded individual to the development of Canada, he has seldom been accorded his rightful place in accounts of its history. Here is the man who made possible so much of what Champlain accomplished. He it was who founded the first permanent colony here. With his interest in trade simply as a necessary source of funds for colonization and discovery, he sacrificed personal gain for the greater goal, one in which Champlain was his staunch ally. From the day he and his associates established their settlement on Île Sainte-Croix, the continent was never to be without a European settlement. It was de Monts who proved that people from Europe could live here permanently and that agriculture could be carried on successfully.\n\nSaint Croix Island International Historic Site\n\nParks Canada\n\nSaint Croix Island International Historic Site\n\nU.S. National Park Service\n\nTimeline: Saint Croix Island through Four Centuries\n\nU.S. National Park Service\n\nSir William Alexander, Earl of Stirling (c.1577-1640)\n\n[Not to be confused with Sir William Alexander (c.1602-1638)]\n\nWilliam Alexander persuaded King James VII/II that the only way to get Scots to emigrate was to give them a new Scotland comparable to New France and New England; and the King conveyed the royal wish to the Council of New England and obtained from the latter the surrender of all their territory north of the Sainte-Croix River. Thereupon the king immediately instructed the Scottish Privy Council to prepare a grant of this territory for Sir William Alexander. The grant was signed on 10 September 1621 (o.s.), making Sir William, on paper at least, lord proprietor of the region now known as the three Atlantic Provinces and the Gaspé peninsula – to be called for all time New Scotland or Nova Scotia.\n\nAlso see: Sir William Alexander monument, Halifax\n\nJames Stewart, fourth Lord Ochiltree (1582?-1659)\n\nFounder of a short-lived colony at Port de la Baleine, on Cape Breton Island\n\nIsaac de Razilly (1587-1635)\n\nCaptain in the French Navy, colonizer\n\nFrench governor of Acadia\n\nIsaac de Razilly, Fort Point 1632\n\nPhotographs of Monument\n\nAndré Malapart (fl.1629-1649)\n\nIn 1629, André Malapart lost an eye and part of his hand in the attack by Charles Daniel on the Scottish fort built by Lord Ochiltree on the coast of Cape Breton Island.\n\nDavid Lomeron (1591-1636+)\n\nHuguenot merchant of La Rochelle\n\nIn 1627 there was in existence near Cap Fourchu (now Yarmouth, Nova Scotia) a tiny community called Port-Lomeron\n\nCharles de Saint-Étienne de La Tour (c.1593-1666)\n\n[Not to be confused with Charles de Saint-Étienne de La Tour (c.1665-1731)]\n\nOn 14 July 1654, an English expedition sent by Oliver Cromwell under the command of Major Robert Sedgwick entered the harbour at Saint John and called for La Tour’s surrender. Having few cannon, almost no ammunition, and a garrison of but 70 men to oppose a force of 500, La Tour was obliged to comply. He was made a prisoner and taken to England. Only in 1656 was he allowed to see Cromwell. He asked for the return of his property on the grounds that England and France had been at peace when the capture took place. Cromwell refused the request, agreeing only to recognize La Tour’s right as a baronet of Nova Scotia as his father’s heir, provided he accepted English allegiance and paid both the amount he owed Boston merchants and the cost of the English garrison that Leverett had maintained at Saint John. Discouraged with the turn of events and undoubtedly dispirited at the thought of the French creditors awaiting him and his wife, Charles accepted these conditions. To raise the £15,000 involved, La Tour entered into partnership with William Crowne and Thomas Temple.\n\nBarthélemy Vimont (1594-1667)\n\nAfter a shipwreck on the coast of Cape Breton Island, in August 1629 Capt. Charles Daniel built a fort at the entrance to the Grand-Cibou (now Englishtown, Nova Scotia), where he left a garrison with Father Vimont as the chaplain.\n\nSir David Kirke (c.1597-1654)\n\nWhen war broke out in 1627 between France and England, an expedition under David Kirke, was commissioned by Charles I to displace the French from “Canida.” Accompanied by his brothers Lewis, Thomas, John and James, David Kirke set off with three ships probably in company with a fleet bringing settlers to Sir William Alexander’s projected colony at Port-Royal, Nova Scotia.\n\nNicolas Denys (1598-1688)\n\nNicolas Denys was one of the leading figures in Acadia for over half of the 17th century.\n\nSir Lewis Kirke (c.1599-1683)\n\nIn 1654 Lewis Kirke with his brothers John and James petitioned Oliver Cromwell’s Council of State for the claim of £48,000 unpaid from the 1632 settlement with the French regarding Quebec. Provision for a final settlement was contained in the French treaty of 1655, but as late as 1667 the terms had not been fulfilled and Sir Lewis was asking Charles II not to return Nova Scotia to the French until they complied.\n\nSimon Denys de La Ronde Trinité (1599-c.1679)\n\nIn 1632 Simon accompanied his brother, Nicolas, to Acadia.\n\nCharles Daniel ( ? -1661)\n\nSea captain, member of the Compagnie des Cent-Associés\n\nFounder of Fort Sainte-Anne on Cape Breton Island\n\nPhilippe Mius d’Entremont (c.1601-c.1700)\n\nLieutenant-major, king’s attorney, settler\n\nThe first of the d’Entremonts of Nova Scotia\n\nSir William Alexander (c.1602-1638)\n\n[Not to be confused with Sir William Alexander, Earl of Stirling (c.1577-1640)]\n\nOn 4 February 1628/29 Alexander, the Kirkes, and others obtained a monopoly of the trade to Canada. While the Kirkes went off to capture Quebec, Alexander joined forces with Sir James Stewart, Lord Ochiltree, helped him build a fort at Port de la Baleine (now Baleine) in Cape Breton, and then, under the guidance of Claude de Saint-Étienne de La Tour, proceeded to Port-Royal. Here, in the summer of 1629, Alexander built a new fort in which he decided to pass the winter, sending back his ship for additional supplies and colonists. He also dispatched Claude de La Tour with an agreement for his father, Sir William, to sign, the terms of which conferred the title of knight-baronet and a large grant of land on Claude and his son Charles de Saint-Étienne de La Tour, in return for their assistance and allegiance. This agreement, slightly modified, was duly signed by Alexander’s father 30 April 1630.\n\nCharles de Menou d’Aulnay (c.1604-1650)\n\nD’Aulnay deserves consideration as a great colonizer and as one of the first architects of the plan to give to the Atlantic provinces a European population.\n\nEmmanuel Le Borgne (1610-1675)\n\nUnder the patronage of the Duc de Vendôme, Le Borgne returned to Port-Royal in 1654 in the ship Châteaufort, laden with 75,000 livres of merchandise, provisions, and munitions, to enforce the duke’s claim to Saint John and Saint-Pierre under the 1652 transaction. But Le Borgne failed to capture the Saint John fort and La Tour before his operations were interrupted by Sedgwick‘s 1654 expedition to capture Acadia. In the capitulation of Port-Royal (16 August 1654), which he signed along with Father Léonard de Chartres, he requested that his ship and his merchandise be returned to him. He returned to France late in 1654, leaving his eldest son, Emmanuel Le Borgne Du Coudray, as a hostage at Port-Royal, and Alexandre Le Borgne de Belle-Isle in charge of La Hève (now LaHave, Lunenburg County).\n\nSieur de Monts (fl. 1662)\n\n[Not to be confused with Pierre du Gua de Monts (1558?-1628)]\n\nThe crossing of the North Atlantic ocean in 1662 was rough. It lasted four months, during which the Sieur de Monts, according to Marie de l’Incarnation, was “most sorely treated by the captain of the King’s vessels, not to mention that he had provisions for only two months, and was four on the way.”\n\nNicolas Le Creux du Breuil ( ? – ? )\n\nHe probably arrived in Acadia with Commander Isaac de Razilly as early as 1632. Le Creux was in command of de Razilly’s Fort Saint-François at Canseau (Canso) and was working at fortifying it when, on 31 July 1635, he had to repulse Indians who had been stirred up by Jean Thomas, the captain of a fishing boat.\n\nFather Léonard de Chartres ( ? -1654)\n\nIn July 1653 Father Léonard officiated at the marriage of d’Aulnay’s widow, Jeanne Motin, to Charles de Saint-Étienne de La Tour and signed the marriage contract. The following year he was present at the capture of Port-Royal by Sedgwick and with Le Borgne he countersigned the articles of capitulation, 16 August 1654.\n\nRichard Walker (1611-1680)\n\n[Not to be confused with his father Richard Walker (1592-1687)]\n\nRichard Walker was deputy governor of Nova Scotia (Acadia) in 1670. He represented Lynn in the General Court (Massachusetts Legislature) in 1679-80.\n\nRobert Sedgwick (1611-1656)\n\nIn 1653-54 Sedgwick visited England, then at war with the Dutch. Because New Haven had petitioned Cromwell to reduce her rival, New Netherland, Sedgwick was sent to New England to organize an expedition against the Dutch colony, but news of peace overtook him in Boston. Since his commission from Cromwell of 8 February 1653/54, as general of the fleet and commander-in-chief of all the New England coast, authorized him to make reprisals against French commerce for attacks on English vessels by French privateers commissioned by princes Rupert and Charles, he resolved to use this power to secure the rich fur-trading and fishing resources of Acadia for New England and the Protectorate. Charles de Saint-Étienne de La Tour controlled Acadia at this time, but his defences were weak. He had outlasted his rival, Charles de Menou d’Aulnay, only to suffer attack by d’Aulnay’s creditor, Emmanuel Le Borgne. Sedgwick left Boston on 4 July 1654 with 170 men in three ships and a ketch. In ten days he reached the Saint John River where he found La Tour in his fort. Three days later La Tour and 70 fighting men surrendered. On 31 July Sedgwick’s expedition sailed to Port-Royal (now Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia). Sedgwick was ambushed but won and took the fort. His son-in-law, Major John Leverett, was appointed military governor of Acadia and Sedwick left for England, taking La Tour with him. Cromwell welcomed Sedgwick because possession of Acadia provided additional bargaining power in negotiating with France. The Protectorate agreed to recognize La Tour’s title to Nova Scotia under his grant from Sir William Alexander, Earl of Stirling, if he would undertake to reimburse Sedgwick for the cost of the conquest, nearly £1,800. This led La Tour to sell his rights to Sir Thomas Temple and Col. William Crowne, who became proprietors of Nova Scotia for the next 14 years.\n\nThomas Temple (1614-1674)\n\nOn 12 September 1657 an agreement was made between Temple and Crowne for a division of their property. Temple’s share extended from what is now Lunenburg in Nova Scotia to the River St. George in Maine, including the whole coast of the Bay of Fundy (Baie Française) on both sides and a hundred leagues* inland. Crowne and Temple had many disputes over their property in Nova Scotia. In 1659, Col. Crowne leased his share of the grant to Thomas Temple for four years. Another challenge to Temple’s assertion of authority over Acadia was Alexander Le Borgne de Belle-Isle’s seizure of La Hève (now La Have in Lunenburg County) in May 1658. Belle-Isle acted under his father’s concession in Acadia from the Compagnie de la Nouvelle-France. He was captured by Temple, taken to Boston, and there held prisoner for several years. After the restoration of Charles II in 1660 petitions for a grant of Acadia were placed before the king by Thomas Elliott, a groom of the bed-chamber, Sir Lewis Kirke, the heirs of Sir William Alexander, the French ambassador on behalf of Le Borgne, and others. In 1662 Temple was created a baronet of Nova Scotia and given the governorship for which he paid Elliott £600 per year.\n\n* “A hundred leagues” is equivalent to about 500 kilometres.\n\nSir Thomas Temple, Baronet (1613/14-1670)\n\nwebsite of the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia\n\nJeanne Motin (c.1615-1666)\n\nShe came to Acadia in 1636 with her two sisters and her brother-in-law, Nicolas Le Creux Du Breuil. In the same year, probably at Port-Royal, she married Charles de Menou d’Aulnay, by whom she had four sons, who entered the army and died in battle, and four daughters, all of whom took religious vows. In a marriage of convenience she was wed in July 1653 to Charles de Saint-Étienne de La Tour, who had been d’Aulnay’s chief rival for power in Acadia. They lived at the mouth of the Saint John until about 1656 when they moved to Cap de Sable. By La Tour she had five children.\n\nMartin d’ Aprendestiguy, Sieur de Martignon (c.1616-c.1686)\n\nIn 1672 Aprendestiguy was granted a seigneury at the mouth of the Saint John River.\n\nJohn Leverett (1616-1679)\n\nOfficial commander of the forts in Acadia, 1654-57\n\nGovernor of Massachusetts 1673-79\n\nLeverett Circle Boston, Massachusetts\n\nWilliam Crowne (1617-1682)\n\nIn the year 1656, Crowne tied up his fortune in a venture in the New World. He became joint proprietor, with Col. Thomas Temple, of Nova Scotia, by buying Charles de Saint-Étienne de La Tour’s patent as baronet of Nova Scotia. By this purchase, Crowne and Temple agreed to pay La Tour’s debt of £3,379 to the widow of Major-Gen. Edward Gibbons of Boston and Temple assumed the cost of the English troops which had earlier captured the fort on the Saint John River. Col. Temple, Col. Crowne, his son John Crowne, and a group of settlers came to America in 1657. Crowne’s name first appears in the records of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, in September 1657 on an agreement between Temple and Crowne to divide Acadia, Temple taking the eastern part and Crowne the western, including the fort of Pentagouet (now Castine, Maine). The claim of Temple and Crowne to the grant of Nova Scotia by Cromwell was threatened at the Restoration by both French and English claims. Thomas Elliott petitioned King Charles II for a grant of the province. Sir Lewis Kirke and associates and the heirs of Sir William Alexander also petitioned for it. In 1661 the French ambassador claimed it for France. That same year Crowne, accompanied by his son, went to England with a petition, signed by the three original grantees (himself, Temple, and La Tour). On 22 June 1661 he submitted a statement on the manner in which he and Temple became proprietors. While in England, Col. William Crowne also pleaded the cause of the colonists before the council and lord chamberlain on 4 December 1661. Temple arrived in England in February 1662 and prepared a statement in answer to the French ambassador’s claim, which gained him and his heirs a grant of Acadia and Nova Scotia and the governorship for life.\n\nJacques de Chambly ( ? -1687)\n\nOn 5 May 1673 he was appointed governor of Acadia.\n\nJohn Alden (c.1625-1702)\n\nIn 1688 and 1689 Alden made trading voyages to Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia) and Les Mines (Grand Pré, Nova Scotia). He made a truce with the Indians at Sagadahoc in November 1690. Earlier that year he had taken part in the capture of Port-Royal under Phips, and had gone with Captain Cyprian Southack to reduce La Hève (LaHave) and Chedabouctou (Guysborough, Nova Scotia).\n\nCornelius Van Steenwyk (Steenwijck) (1626-1684)\n\nMayor of New York, 1668-1670 and 1682-1684\n\nIn 1676 Van Steenwyk briefly served as governor of Acadia, more or less. His authority over Acadia was never effectively asserted.\n\nHector D’Andigné de Grandfontaine (1627-1696)\n\nGovernor of Acadia, August 1670 to May 1673\n\nGrandfontaine was the first French governor of Acadia after the English occupation of 1654-70. An official census done in 1671, as ordered by Colbert de Terron, the intendant of Rochefort, showed the total European population of Acadia, including the garrisons, amounted to barely 500 persons; it was a very small colony.\n\nPierre Tibaudeau (1631-1704)\n\nTibaudeau is the founder of Chipoudy (now Shepody, New Brunswick).\n\nPasquine (fl.1681-88)\n\nEngineer of the Department of Marine (French Navy)\n\nPasquine arrived in Acadia in 1688. He drew a detailed plan of the river and country surrounding Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia) and visited the other posts on the Bay of Fundy. He also prepared several plans for the rebuilding of the fort at Port-Royal. Pasquine left maps of the mouths of the Saint John, Penobscot, and Kennebec rivers, where he recommended that forts be erected. These maps are of great historical interest.\n\nJurriaen Aernoutsz (fl.1674)\n\nAernoutsz was a Dutch sea-captain who conquered Acadia in 1674. He spent a month in Acadia which he called “Nova Hollandia” or “New Holland.” He then sailed to Boston where he disposed of his plunder, even selling the cannon from Fort Pentagouet to the Massachusetts government.\n\nJohn Rhoades (fl.1674-76)\n\nIn September 1676 the Dutch West India Company made a belated effort to capitalize on Aernoutsz’s conquest by granting Rhoades a commission to reside and trade in Acadia and by appointing Cornelius Van Steenwyk, a Dutch merchant in New York, governor of Acadia.\n\nAlexandre Le Borgne de Belle-Isle (c.1640-c.1693)\n\nIn the autumn of 1656, two years after the capitulation of Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia) to Sedgwick, Acadia was ceded by Charles de Saint-Étienne de La Tour to two English colonels, Thomas Temple and William Crowne. The following year Emmanuel Le Borgne was appointed governor of Acadia by the king of France, but being unable to leave Europe he sent his son Alexandre to the colony with some 50 men, to take possession of his holdings. The little force seized the fort of La Hève in May 1658 and appropriated for itself the food and pelts that Temple had stored there. Carrying on its campaign, it then unsuccessfully attacked Temple’s fort, constructed at Port-La Tour. Thomas Temple, anxious to avenge the insult, hastened up from Boston and attacked Alexandre Le Borgne’s improvised fort. Le Borgne was wounded during this engagement then taken to London, where he was held captive for some years. When the Treaty of Breda restored Acadia to France in 1667, Emmanuel Le Borgne recovered his former possessions. The following year he entrusted the government of the colony to his son Alexandre, who from then on took the name of Le Borgne de Belle-Isle.\n\nMichel Leneuf de La Vallière de Beaubassin (1640-1705)\n\n[Not to be confused with\n\nMichel Leneuf de La Vallière de Beaubassin (1677-1740)]\n\nAfter studying in France, La Vallière returned to Canada in 1657. According to Charlevoix he was in command on Île Royale (Cape Breton Island) in 1666, under Nicolas Denys. In 1672 he is supposed to have set up a fur-trading post on the Isthmus of Chignecto, while devoting part of his time to the fishing industry, farming, settlement, and soldiering. In October 1676 Buade de Frontenac granted him a piece of land 10 square leagues* in area, constituting the Beaubassin seigneury. Later this region was to become one of the most strategic points in the struggles between French and English in Acadia – indeed in North America. On 7 May 1676, on Frontenac’s orders, he set off to cruise along the Acadian coasts to spy on the enemy. While thus occupied, with his brother-in-law Sieur Richard Denys de Fronsac as his second in command, he seized three English ketches from Boston that were taking on coal at Cape Breton: two of them were declared lawful prizes. La Vallière was promoted commandant of Acadia in 1678, replacing Pierre de Joybert. He enjoyed the favour of Frontenac, who in 1681 recommended him to the minister as a future governor. Appointed governor in 1683, La Vallière exercised his functions for one year only at Port-Royal (now Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia).\n\n* “Ten square leagues” is equivalent to about 900 square miles\n\nor about 2300 square kilometres.\n\nPierre de Joybert de Sulanges et de Marson (c.1641-1678)\n\nIn October 1672, in recognition of his “good and praise-worthy service to the King, both in Old and New France” he received a seigneurial grant on the east bank of the Saint John River, measuring one league* in depth and extending four leagues* up the river from its mouth. This large area included what is now downtown Saint John, New Brunswick. At the same time, he was promoted to “Major des troupes” in Acadia and assigned command of Fort Jemseg (called Gemisick by the French) and the river Saint John by Buade de Frontenac. It is doubtful if there was a single white resident at the time on the Saint John and his appointment appears to have been part of a plan to settle soldiers and families on that river as an aid in establishing an inland route of communication between Quebec and Acadia.\n\n* “One league” is equivalent to about five kilometres.\n\n“Four leagues” is equivalent to about twenty kilometres.\n\nLouis-Pierre Thury (c.1644-1699)\n\nAbout 1698 Abbé Thury founded a new mission at Pigiguit (on Minas Basin) and planned to group the Micmacs in one huge settlement between Shubenacadie and Chibouctou (Chebucto, Halifax).\n\nCharles Duret de Chevry de La Boulaye (c. 1645-1691?)\n\nBy 1685 La Boulaye was lieutenant for the king in Acadia, replacing Bergier. He was at Chedabouctou (Guysborough, Nova Scotia), which was the base of operations of the fishing company, about 7 or 8 leagues* from Canseau (Canso), when Jacques de Meulles, the intendant of New France, arrived there on 5 June 1686. At Canso, while on the way to Chedabouctou, de Meulles found the fishing company’s ship Saint-Louis which had arrived 8 or 10 days earlier to fish for cod. The establishment of the company at Chedabouctou then consisted of Fort Saint-Louis and several roughly built huts.\n\n* “7 or 8 leagues” is equivalent to roughly 40 kilometres.\n\nEdward Tyng (1649-1691)\n\n[Not to be confused with Edward Tyng (1683-1755)]\n\nAfter the fall of Port-Royal in 1690, when Massachusetts included (more or less) Acadia or Nova Scotia, Tyng was selected as its governor.\n\nClaude-Sébastien de Villieu (fl.1690-1705)\n\nVillieu was in command of Acadia from July 1700 to December 1701. In 1705 Villieu sold his house at Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia) to the Recollets, who turned it into a parish church.\n\nVincent Saccardy ( ? -1691)\n\nEngineer-general for the French king in Canada\n\nSaccardy arrived at Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia) in October 1689. He spent about a month there, during which he began to tear down the old fort and build a larger one of four bastions.\n\nGuillaume Blanchard (1650-1716)\n\nEarly settler at Chipoudy (now Shepody, New Brunswick)\n\nJacques-François de Monbeton de Brouillan (1651-1705)\n\nGovernor of Placentia (Plaisance) and of Acadia\n\nKnight of the order of Saint-Louis\n\nJean-Vincent d’Abbadie de Saint-Castin (1652-1707)\n\nIn July 1670, the treaty of Breda having restored Acadia to France, Saint-Castin, still an ensign, went with Captain Andigné de Grandfontaine, the new governor of Acadia, to Penobscot Bay, to retake possession of the fort at Pentagouet (on the Penobscot River) captured by the English 16 years before. The place was a “hot spot,” right in the middle of contested territory. The French maintained that the boundary of Acadia was at the Kennebec River, the English put it as far back as the Penobscot River, and the most enthusiastic of the Bostonians even wanted to make it the Sainte-Croix River. While these disputes were going on between white men, in the coastal region the country remained also and above all the domain of the Penobscots, and in the forests of the interior that of the other Abenaki tribes. Saint-Castin was entrusted with several missions which enabled him to study the men and the country. The town of Castine, Maine, is named after Jean-Vincent d’Abbadie de Saint-Castin.\n\nJohn Nelson (1654-1734)\n\nIn 1691, after the capture of Port-Royal (Annapolis, Nova Scotia), Nelson and six other merchants concluded an agreement with the Massachusetts government to provide a garrison there in exchange for a monopoly of the area’s trade for the next five years. Nelson had been on such good terms with the French authorities that he had been able thus far to maintain a warehouse in Port-Royal. While trading in Acadia in 1691, however, Nelson and a number of other New Englanders were captured by a French cruiser, and Nelson was sent to Quebec. Among the others taken were Colonel Edward Tyng, newly appointed governor of Acadia, and John Alden.\n\nFrancis Nicholson (1655-1728)\n\nSoldier, governor of Nova Scotia, colonial administrator\n\nJoseph Robinau de Villebon (1655-1700)\n\nGovernor of Acadia 1690-1700\n\nIn 1686 Acadia had 885 inhabitants;\n\nin 1693 the total was apparently 1009.\n\nKateri Tekakwitha (1656-1680)\n\nThe first Indian to be named venerable\n\nA Mohawk woman buried in Quebec will become the first Native American saint at a ceremony in Rome in October 2012. Kateri Tekakwitha, who spent most of her life in what is now upstate New York, will become the first aboriginal saint when she and six others are canonized at the Vatican. Pope Benedict made the announcement Saturday (18 February 2012), after he appointed 22 new cardinals. Benedict had already approved miracles attributed to Tekakwitha, the final step toward sainthood. Known as the Lily of the Mohawks, she was born in New York in 1656. Tekakwitha is entombed in a marble shrine at the St. Francis Xavier Church in Kahnawake, Quebec. About sixty First Nations Nova Scotians will make the pilgramage to Rome to mark Saint Kateri’s canonization on 21 October 2012, among them thirty members of the Shubenacadie Band, and others from the Eskasoni and Millbrook First Nations communities. Kateri is said to hold a special importance for First Nations peoples. The process for her sainthood has been ongoing since 1884.\n\n—Source: Halifax Chronicle-Herald, 19 February and 21 June, 2012\n\nAntoine Laumet, dit de Lamothe Cadillac (1658-1730)\n\nSeigneur in Acadia\n\ncaptain in the colonial regular troops, sub-lieutenant in the French navy,\n\ncommandant of Michilimackinac, founder of Detroit, governor of Louisiana,\n\nknight of the order of Saint-Louis, governor of Castelsarrasin in France\n\nBoastful, ingenious, quarrelsome, not too scrupulous about adhering to the truth. About 1683 Cadillac landed in Acadia as an obscure immigrant and settled in Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia).\n\nJohn March (1658-1712)\n\nMassachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley appointed Colonel John March to lead the proposed expedition against Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal), Nova Scotia, in 1707\n\nMathieu de Goutin (c.1660-1714)\n\nUpon his arrival at Port-Royal in 1688, de Goutin found himself the busiest official of the colony. As lieutenant general he heard all civil and criminal suits, and those pertaining as well to public order, navigation and trade. As king’s writer he was the subdelegate of the intendant of New France. He administered the king’s accounts, munitions, and supplies, and was inspector of crown works.\n\nRichard Philipps (c.1661-1750)\n\nAs a younger son of a Welsh family, Richard Philipps had no prospects of inheriting the family baronetcy. He entered the army as a lieutenant about 1678. His chance for preferment and a basis for his later career came in 1688 when William of Orange set sail for England and he was employed to circulate printed announcements of the prince’s intentions among the Jacobite troops in advance of William’s landing at Torbay. Philipps was arrested and, though accounts differ on the details, it is known that he was about to be hanged when the news of William’s arrival came and his captors hurriedly released him…\n\nCyprian Southack (1662-1745)\n\nSouthack entered the service of the colony of Massachusetts in 1690, when the man-of-war Mary, of which he was commander and part-owner, was rented for use in the expedition against Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia) under Sir William Phips. After the capture of Port-Royal, Southack went to Cape Sable Island, where he battled Indians allied to the French; to Chedabouctou (Guysborough, Nova Scotia), where he reduced Fort Saint-Louis; and to Newfoundland, where he raided French outposts. This was the beginning of a long period of employment for Southack by the Massachusetts government.\n\nPierre Maisonnat, dit Baptiste (1663-1714+)\n\nShip’s captain and privateer\n\nLawrence Armstrong (1664-1739)\n\nLieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia\n\nCharles de Saint-Étienne de La Tour (c.1665-1731)\n\n[Not to be confused with Charles de Saint-Étienne de La Tour (c.1593-1666)]\n\nIn 1703 Charles was appointed an ensign with the French forces in Acadia. He was a member of the local garrison during the bombardment and capture of Port-Royal by Nicholson in 1710 and was severely wounded. He was promoted lieutenant and in 1714 was stationed at Île Royale.\n\nFrançois Guion (1666-1701)\n\nPrivateer operating on the coasts of Acadia and New England\n\nJustinien Durand (c.1667-c.1746)\n\nAfter the treaty of Utrecht in 1713 Durand and other missionaries in Acadia tried, at the request of the French government, to encourage the Acadian population to emigrate to the territories that had remained French. At first Durand was optimistic about his parishioners’ desire to leave. But the British authorities increased the obstacles, and the French authorities showed little inclination to respect the wonderful promises made by their agents. In reality the Acadians did not want to leave their land if freedom of religion and property rights were guaranteed them. Neither did they want to take the oath of allegiance to the British King. None of the early administrators of Nova Scotia, Francis Nicholson, Samuel Vetch, John Doucett, Thomas Caulfeild, had succeeded in obtaining it. When a new governor, Richard Philipps, arrived in April 1720, he was firmly resolved to settle the question.\n\nPatrice René (1667-1742)\n\nIn 1703 Patrice René arrived in Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia), joining his confrère, Father Félix Pain, who had been chaplain at the fort since 1701. René became the first superior of the convent which his order founded at Port-Royal, and in 1708 he was appointed the bishop of Quebec’s vicar general in Acadia.\n\nFélix Pain (1668-1741)\n\nFélix Pain was garrison chaplain 1701-1710,\n\nat Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia).\n\nSamuel Vetch (1668-1732)\n\nCommander of the garrison at Annapolis Royal\n\nGovernor of Nova Scotia\n\nLouise Guyon (Damours de Freneuse) (1668-1711+)\n\nIn 1711 Mme de Freneuse returned to Port-Royal (renamed Annapolis Royal) with a pass from Philippe de Rigaud de Vaudreuil, the governor of New France. She crossed the Bay of Fundy in a canoe in the heart of winter, alone with her youngest son and an Indian. The acting English governor of Annapolis Royal, Sir Charles Hobby, allowed her to stay there, but Paul Mascarene claimed that she was acting as a spy for the French government. Certainly Mme de Freneuse would have had several valid reasons for returning to Acadia, if only because of the many relatives she had there and to see to the possessions she had had to leave in haste behind her at the Saint John River and at Annapolis Royal. On the other hand, we know that the court of France was seriously thinking of retaking Annapolis Royal. According to Mascarene, two of her sons may have taken part in June 1711 in the attack at Bloody Creek (near Bridgetown, Nova Scotia), where 30 English soldiers perished.\n\nSir Charles Hobby (c.1670-1715)\n\nIn October 1710 Port-Royal fell to the British and Vetch was made governor of the fort (soon to be renamed Annapolis Royal) and of a three-mile [five-kilometre] surrounding area. Hobby was second in command. The following June, Samuel Vetch left for Boston to plan a full-scale attack on Quebec and Hobby was left in charge of Annapolis. The garrison he commanded was by now reduced by disease and desertion, while the fort was beginning to fall into disrepair. Furthermore, they were surrounded by hostile French and Indians. Hobby soon received news that Sir Hovenden Walker, commander of the Quebec expedition, was sending 200 New Englanders to reinforce the Annapolis garrison and in return demanded that Hobby return 100 British Marines and all the mortars and ordnance stores he could spare. Meanwhile, the French and Indians had become more aggressive. Early in June 1711, a detachment of about 70 men, sent from Annapolis to harass a nearby Indian settlement and restore the transportation of wood to the fort, was ambushed by Indians; some 30 soldiers were killed at the First Battle of Bloody Creek. Shortly afterwards a force of about 200 French and Indians laid siege unsuccessfully to the fort.\n\nFrançois Le Coutre de Bourville (c.1670-c.1758)\n\nIn 1718 Bourville was appointed garrison adjutant of Île Royale (Cape Breton Island). In 1730, with little recommendation other than the usual automatic increase in seniority, he succeeded to the king’s lieutenancy of Île Royale. On four occasions he commanded at Île Royale in the absence of the governor.\n\nJohn Doucett ( ? -1726)\n\nLieutenant-governor of the fort of Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, 1717-26\n\nAdministrator of the government of Nova Scotia, 1717-20 and 1722-26\n\nThomas Smart ( ? -1722)\n\nBritish naval officer who directed the\n\nattack on French fishing installations at\n\nCanso, Nova Scotia, in September 1718\n\nDièreville (fl.1699-1711)\n\nHe reached Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia) in Acadia on 13 October 1699, after a voyage of 54 days. He spent a year in the country in search of information about the region and the French and Amerindian populations; he also gathered plants. In October 1700 he sailed for Europe.\n\nLouis-Simon Le Poupet de La Boularderie (c.1674-1738)\n\nCommandant 1719-1738 at Port d’Orléans, Île Royale\n\n(North Bay Ingonish, Cape Breton Island)\n\nFather Antoine Gaulin (1674-1740)\n\nMissionary to the Abenakis and Micmacs of Acadia and Nova Scotia\n\nBetween 1717 and 1720, after France had founded a new colony on Île Royale (Cape Breton Island), Gaulin succeeded in bringing together a great number of Micmacs from the peninsula in a large mission at Antigonish – within English territory but close to Île Royale. Later he established missions at Cape Sable, La Hève (La Have), Shubenacadie and Mirligueche (near Lunenburg).\n\nLouis Denys de La Ronde (1675-1741)\n\nIn the spring of 1713 the peace of Utrecht had ceded Acadia and Newfoundland to England, and in an effort to counter the loss France decided upon a new venture on Île Royale (Cape Breton Island). Serving under Saint-Ovide [Monbeton], Louis Denys de La Ronde reconnoitred the island, making recommendations for settlement and preparing charts and reports of his observations. It is perhaps significant that he noted with some emotion the vestiges of the pioneering efforts of his grandfather, Simon Denys de La Trinité, who more than 60 years previously had built a trading post at Sainte-Anne (Englishtown). In the summer of the following year La Ronde joined Jacques d’Espiet de Pensens on an unsuccessful journey to Nova Scotia to encourage the Acadians to leave the province and immigrate to Île Royale.\n\nMichel Leneuf de La Vallière de Beaubassin (1677-1740)\n\n[Not to be confused with Michel Leneuf de La Vallière de Beaubassin (1640-1705)]\n\nIn 1713, La Vallière was sent to Île Royale; his name appears among those who signed the official taking-over of the site of the future Louisbourg, on 2 September 1713. He was active at Port-Toulouse (St. Peters, NovaScotia); as early as 1715 he concerned himself with the handful of Acadian families who were trying to found a new settlement there. In April 1737 La Vallière obtained a commission as major. From Louisbourg, where he was located, he wrote on 30 June 1738, to the minister in the absence of Major Le Coutre de Bourville, the acting governor, to inform him of the deplorable state of the colony.\n\nCharles de La Goudalie (c.1678-c.1753)\n\nExcept for a few disputes with the lieutenant-governor, Lawrence Armstrong, La Goudalie maintained excellent relations with the authorities in Annapolis Royal.\n\nLouis Du Pont Duchambon (1679-1775)\n\n[Not to be confused with Louis Du Pont Duchambon de Vergor (1713-1775)]\n\nDuchambon secured favourable terms for the capitulation of the Louisbourg Fortress.\n\nPatrick Heron (fl.1709-1752)\n\nBritish Army officer\n\nHeron was the commanding officer at Canso, Nova Scotia, in 1744 when war broke out between France and Britain.\n\nAlexandre de La Maisonfort (fl.1699-1752)\n\nFrench Navy officer\n\nIn 1745 La Maisonfort, commanding Vigilant, was given the task of transporting munitions and supplies to Louisbourg. In May 1745, when he arrived in sight of Louisbourg, already besieged by troops from the English colonies under the command of William Pepperrell, he fell into a trap set for him by an English privateer. Challenged by the privateer, Vigilant pursued it and found itself confronted by Peter Warren’s English squadron. After a long fight, La Maisonfort had to surrender. The loss of Vigilant had a double result: a material one in that it deprived the defenders of Louisbourg of the help intended for them, and a psychological one in that it showed England’s supremacy on the seas, which would destroy for the besieged fortress any possibility of relief.\n\nPierre-François-Xavier de Charlevoix (1682-1761)\n\nIn 1719 Charlevoix was given the delicate task of recommending boundaries for Acadia, a constant subject of dispute between England and France after the treaty of Utrecht (1713). He worked ten months on this investigation and reported that the Acadia ceded to the English in 1713 included only the Nova Scotian peninsula, and that the French should continue to support and trade with the Abenakis, a position which would be contested by the English until the end of the French regime.\n\nEmmanuel-Auguste de Cahideuc, Comte Dubois de La Motte (1683-1764)\n\nDubois de La Motte’s naval squadron at Louisbourg delayed the fall of Île Royale by a year.\n\nEdward Tyng (1683-1755)\n\n[Not to be confused with Edward Tyng (1649-1691)]\n\nIn January 1745, Captain Tyng was elevated to the command of Massachusetts, a new vessel. He sailed from Boston on 16 March 1745 as commodore of the colonial flotilla of 13 armed and about 90 transport vessels engaged in the expedition against Louisbourg, Île Royale (Cape Breton Island). During this campaign he performed blockade duty. He participated in the destruction of Port-Dauphin (Englishtown, Nova Scotia) and in June went to relieve Annapolis Royal which had been briefly besieged by the French and Indians in May.\n\nPaul Mascarene (1684-1760)\n\nMascarene was in some ways an odd fish in the imperial backwater of Annapolis Royal. Like those who preceded him, he was caught up in the tedious and unrewarding business of guarding an imperial possession before the crown had decided to take its imperial role seriously.\n\nWilliam Winniett (1685-1741)\n\nMilitary officer, merchant, member of the Nova Scotia Council\n\nIsaac-Louis de Forant ( ? -1740)\n\nNaval officer, knight of the order of Saint-Louis\n\nthird governor of Île Royale\n\nJean-Baptiste-Louis le Prévost DuQuesnel ( ? -1744)\n\nIn 1740 DuQuesnel was appointed commandant of Île Royale (Cape Breton Island) but his initial enthusiasm soon waned; within a year he had applied for a transfer to the first vacant governorship. An inspection of the town after he landed on 3 November 1740 revealed an understaffed and under-equipped garrison, further weakened by indiscipline and drunkenness. He faced serious problems in supplying the garrison; there were constant shortages of food, especially during the winter of 1742.\n\nJacques-Pierre de Taffanel de La Jonquière (1685-1752)\n\nOn 1 March 1746 La Jonquière was promoted rear-admiral, and three weeks later he was appointed governor general of New France. While on his way from France to Canada he participated, as commander of the flagship Northumberland, in the disastrous expedition led by the Duc d’Anville – a fleet consisting of more than 70 vessels – which was outfitted at Brest that year to undertake offensive operations against the British possessions along the Atlantic coast of North America. The expedition was the largest military force – of any nation – ever to set sail for the New World prior to the American Revolution (1776-1789). After reaching the coast of Acadia in September 1746, the squadron was scattered by a strong gale, an event complicated by the death of d’Anville. D’Estourmel, the second in command, gathered together five warships and most of the transports and entered the harbour of Chebucto (Halifax, Nova Scotia) on 27 September 1746. On 29 September a council of war made him commander-in-chief; it also decided to attack Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia. A few hours later, D’Estourmel tried to commit suicide. Jonquière, as the most senior officer, took command. Though Jonquière tried to reorganize the forces to attack Annapolis Royal, in October of 1746, another Atlantic torm hit the reduced fleet of 42 ships and Jonquière was obliged to make the decision to return to France with his battered ships and sick men.\n\nPierre Morpain (c.1686-1749)\n\nFrench naval and militia officer, privateer, port captain\n\nCruising out of Port-Royal (now Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia) as captain in 1707, in a single ten-day outing Pierre Morpain sank four British vessels and brought in nine prizes. Morpain’s activities were vital to Port-Royal; preoccupied with the war in Europe, France had not sent any supplies there since 1706. In June 1715 he was named port captain at Île Royale (Cape Breton Island) and he reported to Louisbourg a year later. He supervised all the details relating to the maritime interests of the crown in Île Royale: the construction of facilities; the building, maintenance, and outfitting of ships; and the conduct of navigation. It was the events of 1745, however, which were to mark the zenith of Morpain’s career. Although Louisbourg had been founded as France’s key stronghold in the new world, New England troops commanded by William Pepperrell were able to land on Île Royale and lay siege to the fortress in May 1745. The Louisbourg garrison was completely demoralized; the entire officer corps lacked the energy and boldness required to meet the occasion. In these circumstances, Louis Du Pont Duchambon, the acting governor, was forced to rely on Morpain rather than the regular officers to direct the French defence. Morpain’s performance between 11 May and mid June 1745 shows that the 60-year-old privateer, however rash and unorthodox some of his manœuvres, possessed a better military mind than any in Louisbourg’s officer corps.\n\nCharles-Joseph d’Ailleboust (1688-1761)\n\nOne day in June 1745 (accounts vary about the specific date), in Louisbourg Harbour, Charles-Joseph d’Ailleboust went on board Admiral Peter Warren’s ship to hand over to him the act of surrender of the Fortress of Louisbourg, at the time the strongest military site anywhere in North America.\n\nBernard-Anselme d’Abbadie de Saint-Castin, Baron de Saint-Castin (1689-1720)\n\nFrench officer, commander in Acadia\n\nJohn Washington (fl.1719-24)\n\nLieutenant and engineer, assigned to the British garrison at Annapolis Royal\n\nArthur Savage (fl.1720-31)\n\nFirst secretary of the Province of Nova Scotia\n\nJean-Pierre de Miniac (c.1691-1771)\n\nMiniac left Quebec on 12 September 1742 and reached Rivière-aux-Canards\n\n(near Canard, Nova Scotia) after a long and arduous trip.\n\nConstantin-Louis d’Estourmel (1691-1765)\n\nPromoted rear-admiral on 1 January 1746, d’Estourmel was given command of Trident in the squadron led by the Duc d’Anville – a fleet consisting of more than 70 vessels – which was outfitted at Brest that year to undertake offensive operations against the British possessions in North America. After reaching the coast of Acadia (Nova Scotia) in September 1746, the squadron was scattered by a strong gale. D’Estourmel gathered together five warships and most of the transports and entered the harbour of Chebucto (Halifax, Nova Scotia) on 27 September 1746, where he learned of the Duc d’Anville’s death. On 29 September a council of war made him commander-in-chief; it also decided to attack Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia.\n\nJean Mascle de Saint-Julhien (1693-1759)\n\nSaint-Julhien was appointed on 1 September 1755 to act as commander at Louisbourg in the governor’s absence.\n\nEdward Whitmore (c.1694-1761)\n\nGovernor of Cape Breton Island and the\n\nIsland of St. John (Prince Edward Island)\n\nAs governor he was responsible for the demolition\n\nof the Louisbourg fortifications in 1760.\n\nSir William Pepperrell (1696-1759)\n\nIn June 1745, Pepperrell and Warren jointly negotiated the terms of capitulation of the Louisbourg Fortress with the French commander.\n\nRobert Denison (1697-1765)\n\nSoldier, settler, MLA\n\nLouis Franquet (1697-1768)\n\nThe most important of Franquet’s\n\nresponsibilities was the\n\ndefence of Louisbourg.\n\nCharles Des Herbiers de La Ralière (c.1700-1752)\n\nGovernor of Île Royale from July 1749 to 1751\n\nWhen the colony of Île Royale – consisting of that island and Île Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island) – was returned to France by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748), Des Herbiers was chosen as King’s commissioner to negotiate the details of the transfer from the British occupying force. This negotiation was completed at Louisbourg on 23 July 1749, and Des Herbiers became the governor.\n\nJohn Henry Bastide (c.1700-1770)\n\nFor almost three decades, Bastide, a capable French military engineer, worked at the French fortress at Louisbourg, Île Royale (Cape Breton Island). He drew a plan of Louisbourg as it was in 1734 which was accurate enough to be employed by 20th-century historians in their reconstruction of the history of the fortress.\n\nLouis-Joseph Beaussier de Lisle (1701-1765)\n\nDespite the efforts of the English squadron, de Lisle succeeded in entering Louisbourg harbour on 26 July 1756. The next day he left again with Héros to engage two English ships of the line; they had to retire after being badly damaged.\n\nJean-Louis de Raymond, Comte de Raymond (c.1702-1771)\n\nGovernor of Île Royale from 1751 to 1753\n\nSome of Raymond’s ideas were sound; all were expensive to implement.\n\nJean-Baptiste de Gay Desenclaves (1702-1764+)\n\nDesenclaves is distinguished by the fact that his relations with the British authorities in Nova Scotia were always cordial; his conduct consequently laid him open to criticism by the French authorities, religious as well as political. Desenclaves first went to Minas Basin, which was without its parish priest, Abbé Claude-Jean-Baptiste Chauvreulx. After Chauvreulx’s return in December 1739, Desenclaves took charge of the parish of Rivière-aux-Canards, at Minas. From there he carried on an exchange of letters with the English administrator, Paul Mascarene, concerning the difficulties which the ecclesiastical jurisdiction might create for civil justice, and vice versa.\n\nEdward How ( ? -1750)\n\nHow was appointed commissary of musters for the British forces in Nova Scotia in March 1736 and in August was sworn in as a member of the provincial council at Annapolis Royal.\n\nSir Peter Warren (1703-1752)\n\nIn June 1745, Warren and Pepperrell jointly negotiated the terms of capitulation of the Louisbourg Fortress with the French commander.\n\nAugustin de Boschenry de Drucour (1703-1762)\n\nFrench naval officer, governor of Île Royale (Cape Breton Island)\n\nFrançois Bigot (1703-1778)\n\nFinancial commissary of Île Royale and intendant of New France\n\nJean-Louis de La Corne (1703-1761)\n\nLa Corne’s first combat experience was in Acadia (Nova Scotia) in February 1747 when he served as second in command of a party of some 300 Canadians and Indians led in a winter attack by Nicolas-Antoine Coulon de Villiers against Colonel Arthur Noble and 500 men in Grand Pre.\n\nAndrew Rollo, 5th Baron Rollo (1703-1765)\n\nArmy officer\n\nGeorge Williamson (c.1704-1781)\n\nDuring the summer of 1758 Williamson commanded the artillery during Amherst’s siege of Louisbourg. His force consisted of about 300 men and 145 pieces of ordnance including 85 heavy guns and mortars. Williamson appears to have been responsible for preparing the main bombardment against the fortress, which opened on 22 July. When Louisbourg surrendered five days later he commanded the detail that hoisted the British flag over its walls. A capable artillery commander whose work played an important part in the crucial engagements at Louisbourg and Quebec, George Williamson contributed significantly to the British victory in the Seven Years War.\n\nBenjamin Goldthwait (1704-1761)\n\nIn the fall of 1746 Goldthwait was sent to Annapolis Royal as part of a New England reinforcement for Nova Scotia. That winter the New Englanders were dispatched to the Minas area under the command of Arthur Noble, in an attempt to rout the French forces in that region. Goldthwait was present at Grand Pre on 31 January 1746/47 when the French launched a surprise attack against the New England forces. On the death of Noble, Goldthwait assumed command of the troops, but seeing the hopelessness of their situation, he agreed to surrender to the French commander, Nicolas-Antoine Coulon de Villiers.\n\nLord Charles Hay (c.1705-1760)\n\nCharles Hay was sent to Nova Scotia as second in command of the troops under Major-General Peregrine Thomas Hopson who were dispatched to join the Earl of Loudoun [John Campbell] at Halifax for the projected attack on Louisbourg, Île Royale (Cape Breton Island).\n\nJohn Rous (c.1705-1760)\n\nBetween 1749 and 1755 Rous was the senior naval officer on the Nova Scotia station of the Royal Navy and made a notable contribution to the preservation of the new colony. As the Admiralty did not provide effective naval forces for the defence of Nova Scotia, Rous had to improvise the protection essential to the survival of the settlements at Halifax, Canso, Lunenburg, Annapolis Royal, and Chignecto. He had at his disposal three 14-gun sloops of the Royal Navy, the occasional man-of-war from England, and several New England coasting vessels. Rous convoyed the mast fleet to England in the autumn of 1759.\n\nAntoine Le Poupet de La Boularderie (1705-1771)\n\nFrench military officer, colonizer, and colonial official\n\nClaude-Pierre Pécaudy de Contrecœur (1705-1775)\n\nOn 16 April 1754 Contrecœur and a large French force seized a fort the British were building at the Forks of the Ohio, where Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, now stands. He continued with the construction of the fort, which he named Fort Duquesne. Contrecœur never served in Nova Scotia, but no adequate history of Nova Scotia can be written without including an account of what happened at Fort Duquesne.\n\nCharles Germain (1707-1779)\n\nIn 1760 Charles Germain was the only missionary in Acadia who still had faith in a French victory, but the following year, resigned to defeat, he offered the Nova Scotian government his help in pacifying the Indians. On 21 September 1761 the British authorities granted him a pension of £50 for his services.\n\nPhilip Durell (1707-1766)\n\nIn the spring of 1745 Durell joined Commodore Peter Warren and William Pepperrell in attacking Louisbourg, Île Royale (Cape Breton Island). Through his local knowledge and surveying skills Durell played an important part in the expedition. While his ship was wintering in Nantasket Roads, Massachusetts, he assisted in formulating Pepperrell’s instructions, and Eltham was the first ship to join Pepperrell at Canso (Canseau). During the siege Durell assisted in the capture of Vigilant, which was laden with supplies for the fortress, and, as captain of Chester, he helped take two French East Indiamen.\n\nJoseph Du Pont Duvivier (1707-1760)\n\nOn 6 August 1744, along with two cousins, another ensign, and 18 soldiers, Joseph Du Pont Duvivier took part in his brother François’s expedition against Annapolis Royal. During the siege Joseph acted as emissary to the garrison commander, Paul Mascarene.\n\nHenri-Marie Dubreil de Pontbriand (1708-1760)\n\nAt the beginning of Bishop Pontbriand’s episcopate in 1741, the Catholic ministry in English Acadia was under the direction of Abbé Jean-Pierre de Miniac, while that of French Acadia was assigned to Jean-Louis Le Loutre. The Jesuits ministered to the Abenaki missions on the Saint John River, and the Recollets were responsible for Louisbourg, Île Royale (Cape Breton Island). Pontbriand was much concerned about Acadia. He described the English as enemies “on whose word it would be imprudent to rely.”\n\nNicolas-Antoine Coulon de Villiers (1708-1750)\n\nNicolas-Antoine Coulon de Villiers led a force of about 250 Canadians in an assault on over 500 New England troops commanded by Arthur Noble at Grand-Pré, Nova Scotia. Nicolas-Antoine Coulon de Villiers was a brother of Louis Coulon de Villiers and Joseph Coulon de Villiers de Jumonville.\n\nJean-Baptiste-Nicolas-Roch de Ramezay (1708-1777)\n\nOfficer in the colonial regular troops and King’s lieutenant\n\nCharles Lawrence (c.1709-1760)\n\nGovernor of Nova Scotia\n\nSebastian Zouberbuhler (c.1709-1773)\n\nBusinessman and office-holder\n\nFamiliar with the English, French, and German languages\n\nDuc d’Anville (1709-1746)\n\nFrench Navy officer\n\nJean-Louis Le Loutre (1709-1772)\n\nOn 22 September 1738 Le Loutre left Île Royale for the Shubenacadie mission, an immense territory stretching from Cape Sable to Chedabucto Bay in the north and present-day Cumberland Strait in the west. Le Loutre was to minister to the Indians as well as to the French posts at Cobequid and Tatamagouche.\n\nJohn Gorham (1709-1751)\n\nIn 1745, Massachusetts Governor William Shirley and William Pepperrell persuaded Gorham to raise troops for the planned expedition against Louisbourg, Île Royale (Cape Breton Island). He was appointed lieutenant-colonel in the7th Massachusetts Regiment and led the successful landing at Gabarus Bay on 30 April 1745.\n\nArthur Noble ( ? -1747)\n\nAbout three o’clock on the morning of 11 February 1747, in a raging snow-storm, the French launched their attack on the ill-prepared and unsuspecting New Englanders at Grand Pre. In spite of later attempts to gloss over their inefficiency, it is obvious that Noble and his officers were tragically neglectful of ordinary precautions and that the New Englanders were taken completely by surprise. According to English sources, about 70 of the 500 New England troops were killed, some of them still in their beds.\n\nMontagu Wilmot ( ? -1766)\n\nGovernor of Nova Scotia, May 1764 – May 1766\n\nPierre Maillard (c.1710-1762)\n\nMaillard arrived at Louisbourg, Île Royale, on 13 August 1735 and began to study the Micmac language. Having a remarkable talent for languages, Maillard succeeded within a few months not only in mastering Micmac, despite the difficulties in pronunciation, but also in perfecting a system of special symbols to transcribe Micmac words. He was thus able to write down in note-books the formulas for the principal prayers and the responses of the catechism so that the Indians might learn them more easily. This system was worked out during the winter of 1737-38. Le Loutre described Maillard as “a naturalized Indian as regards language.” He even succeeded in acquiring the gift of rhyming at each member of a sentence, which was the genius of that tribe, so that he reached the point of “speaking Micmac with as much ease and purity as do their women who are the most skilled in this style.” He was used by the officials at Louisbourg to train officers as interpreters. Except for native speakers, Maillard is unsurpassed in his grasp of the Micmac language.\n\nThomas Saul (fl.1750-60)\n\nWith established channels for the supply of provisions and a ready fund of money, Saul soon became the most reliable source of food and cash in Halifax. In September 1751 Governor Cornwallis turned to him to provide coin to pay the labourers employed on public works. When, at the same time, another contractor who was to supply the settlers failed, it was Saul who provided 224,000 pounds [101,000 kg] of bread. Unfortunately, he used the urgent necessity of the colony as an occasion to strike a hard bargain and charge twice the market price for the bread. However, the Board of Trade (in London) forced Baker to adjust the price downward before payment was made. Such occasional sharp dealing did not seem to hurt Saul’s position in Halifax. By July 1752 he was employing ten servants. The summer of 1757 brought large British forces to Halifax. Saul, who was now deputy paymaster, received £22,000 in coins for paying subsistence money to the troops.\n\nJohn Huston (1710-1795)\n\nJohn Huston served at the siege of Louisbourg in 1745. He represented Cumberland Township from 1759 to 1760 and Cumberland County from 1770 to 1774 in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly.\n\nJonathan Belcher (1710-1776)\n\nChief Justice and Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia\n\nLouis Coulon de Villiers (1710-1757)\n\nLouis Coulon de Villiers was a brother of Joseph Coulon de Villiers de Jumonville. Another brother, Nicolas-Antoine Coulon de Villiers, led a force of about 250 French Canadians in an assault on 11 February 1747 on over 500 New England troops commanded by Arthur Noble at Grand-Pre, Nova Scotia.\n\nJean-Baptiste Cope ( ? -c.1759)\n\nMicmac chief\n\nOn 14 September 1752 Cope appeared at Halifax to open peace negotiations with Governor Peregrine Thomas Hopson. On 22 November a treaty was actually signed between the English and Cope, along with delegates from his tribe.\n\nSilvanus Cobb (1710-1762)\n\nMariner, military officer\n\nRichard Gridley (1711-1796)\n\nRichard Gridley was lieutenant-colonel in command of the artillery in William Pepperrell’s expedition against Louisbourg, Île Royale (Cape Breton Island) in 1745. During the siege Gridley had “direction of the Batteries,” in particular the one at Pointe à la Croix (Lighthouse Point).\n\nCharles Morris [1st] (1711-1781)\n\n[Not to be confused with Charles Morris [2nd] (1731-1802)]\n\n[Not to be confused with Charles Morris [3rd] (1759-1831)]\n\nCharles Morris [1st] was Chief Justice of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, March 1776 to May 1778. As Chief Justice, he heard a number of major cases, including charges of treason against rebel soldiers who besieged Fort Cumberland, near Amherst, in 1776, in a failed effort to import the American Revolution (1776-1789) to Nova Scotia. On 25 September 1749, Governor Edward Cornwallis appointed Charles Morris [1st] (1711-1781) “Chief Surveyor of Lands within this Province.” Charles Morris [1st] was surveyor general of lands for the province for 32 years 1749-1781, a period which saw the founding of Halifax and Lunenburg and the coming of the pre-loyalists, when the colony’s foundations were laid. The Council had every confidence in his decisions and actions, and the chronicler of 18th-century Nova Scotia, John Bartlet Brebner, praised him for his honest impartiality. Charles Morris [2nd] (1731-1802) apparently came to Nova Scotia in 1760. From then until 1781 he assisted his father, Charles Morris [1st], Nova Scotia’s first surveyor general; between 1776 and 1781 he performed the tasks of the office alone. After his father’s death in 1781, Morris [2nd] was appointed surveyor general for Nova Scotia.\n\nDaniel-Hyacinthe-Marie Liénard de Beaujeu (1711-1755)\n\nIn 1746 Lieutenant Beaujeu was among the leaders of a 700-man Canadian (French) army dispatched to Nova Scotia to link up with forces expected from France for the capture of Louisbourg and Annapolis Royal. His 28,000-word journal of the 10-month campaign includes a detailed account of their greatest exploit. After a 150-mile [240km] march in bitter mid-winter, 300 Canadians and Indians attacked 500 New Englanders billeted in Grand Pre and forced their surrender after bloody fighting (11 February 1747).\n\nEdward Boscawen (1711-1761)\n\nBoscawen and Amherst insisted that the garrison of Fortress Louisbourg must become prisoners of war, and demanded an answer within an hour, failing which the town would be attacked by land and sea.\n\nCharles Holmes (1711-1761)\n\nIn 1756 Holmes returned to North America as commodore of the squadron charged with preventing French reinforcements from reaching Louisbourg, Île Royale (Cape Breton Island).\n\nOtis Little (1712-c.1764)\n\nOtis Little arrived in Nova Scotia in April 1749 with the fleet of Governor Edward Cornwallis. He was listed as captain in an independent company and was accompanied by ten male and six female servants as befitted the “Surveyor-General of Nova Scotia.” To that appointment Little soon added others. On 15 July 1749 he was appointed commissary of the stores and provisions of the new Halifax settlement. After admission to the bar of Nova Scotia on 3 February 1749/50, he became advocate general in the Vice-Admiralty Court and by 11 October 1750 was acting as Kings Attorney. Unfortunately, his style of living apparently exceeded his income, and he began to take chances.\n\nFrançois Coulon de Villiers (1712-1794)\n\nFrançois Coulon de Villiers was a brother of Nicolas-Antoine Coulon de Villiers, who at Grand Pre in Nova Scotia, in February 1747, led some 250 Canadians in an attack on some 500 New England troops commanded by Arthur Noble.\n\nEdward Cornwallis (1713-1776)\n\nArmy officer and colonial administrator\n\nFounder of Halifax, Nova Scotia\n\nMeet the real Edward Cornwallis by Jon Tattrie\n\nHalifax Chronicle Herald, 11 March 2012\n\nLouis Du Pont Duchambon de Vergor (1713-c.1775)\n\n[Not to be confused with Louis Du Pont Duchambon (1679-1775)]\n\nIn August 1754, Louis Du Pont Duchambon de Vergor was appointed to command at Fort Beausejour. Forts Beausejour and Gaspereau, which the authorities in Massachusetts and Nova Scotia viewed as a threat, became the objects of a British expedition in the spring of 1755. On 13 June 1755, after seizing a ridge within range of Fort Beausejour, General Monckton began mortar fire with telling effect upon the French position. Vergor capitulated the next day. The following day Benjamin Rouer de Villeray surrendered Fort Gaspereau without being attacked. The fall of these forts settled the Acadian boundary dispute finally in favour of the British.\n\nPierre Gaultier de La Vérendrye (1714-1755)\n\n[Not to be confused with\n\nPierre Gaultier de Varennes et de La Vérendrye (1685-1749)]\n\nIn 1752 Pierre was sent to Fort Beausejour, where he served\n\nuntil its surrender to the British in 1755.\n\nWilliam Tutty (c.1715-1754)\n\nOn 2 September 1750, William Tutty preached\n\nthe first sermon in St. Paul’s Church, Halifax.\n\nHenry Denny Denson (c.1715-1780)\n\nDenson realized a substantial income through the breeding and raising of livestock. At his death, the inventory of his estate at Mount Denson included five black slaves, lavish household furnishings, and one of the larger private libraries in the province, including an extensive shelf of legal reference books. The successful squire not only held land but was also the political leader of his community. Denson dutifully accumulated a variety of elective and appointive responsibilities. From 1761 he was a justice of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas and, except for the years 1765 to 1769, a member of the House of Assembly for various constituencies until his death. He was a militia officer from the founding of Falmouth and road commissioner and collector of impost and customs for Kings County. In 1773 he served as acting speaker of the Assembly at Halifax.\n\nElizabeth Osborn (1715-1798)\n\nIn 1749 she married Edmund Doane, residing on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Some years later, at the height of the Seven Years War, Doane decided to emigrate from Cape Cod to the Cape Sable area of Nova Scotia. In 1761 Doane had his house dismantled and the frame and boards loaded on a hired vessel together with furniture, grain and vegetables, and some animals. Elizabeth with her seven children by Doane set out for Nova Scotia. A gale blew the ship ashore; the Doanes had to salvage what they could and embark in another vessel. An autumn storm drove their ship past Barrington to Liverpool, where they had to spend the winter in a rough storehouse. In the spring of 1762 they sailed to The Passage (Barrington Passage, Nova Scotia), and in the frame house they built near the harbour they opened a shop, selling such goods as flour, corn, salt, molasses, rum, sugar, cloth, nails, and shoes to about 50 customers. But the inhabitants of Barrington suffered many hardships in the early years and had little cash. Doane decided to return to Cape Cod. Elizabeth, however, had filled an important niche in the scattered fishing settlement. There was no physician, and being skilled in the use of roots and herbs and in nursing she was soon acting as nurse, doctor, and midwife. At the request of those relying on her services, in 1770 she took the unusual step of applying to the proprietors of Barrington for “Land to Set a house upon.” Her petition was endorsed by 38 male proprietors. She was granted 1½ acres, and the Doanes remained in Nova Scotia.\n\nJohn Bushell (1715-1761)\n\nOn 23 March 1752 Bushell started publication of the Halifax Gazette. The Gazette was first issued on a half-sheet of foolscap, printed in two columns on both sides. About a quarter of the newspaper contained material relating to Nova Scotia, such as information on ship arrivals, proclamations, and occasional notices on runaway slaves, stolen goods, and straying wives. The rest of the paper consisted mainly of excerpts from British newspapers on European politics and government, and news from the American and West Indian colonies. In addition to publishing the Gazette, Bushell printed proclamations and laws for the government and likely did job-work for local merchants. He seems, however, gradually to have lost control of the Gazette. In 1754 Richard Bulkeley, provincial secretary, assumed the editorship of the paper. In 1758 Anthony Henry became Bushell’s assistant and was soon doing much of the printing. The earliest known piece of official printing by Bushell for the government of Nova Scotia was a six-page pamphlet containing “An act for the relief of debtors,” dated 6 December 1752.\n\nJohn Hicks (1715-1790)\n\nHicks and his family were among the Rhode Island planters who arrived at Falmouth (across the Avon River from Windsor) in four ships in May 1760.\n\nJacques Prevost de La Croix (1715-1791)\n\nFrench colonial administrator\n\nDanvers Osborn (1715-1753)\n\nGovernor of New York, Member of the Nova Scotia Council\n\nIn 1750 Danvers Osborn went to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he became a member of the Nova Scotia Council on 29 August. During his attendance at council meetings in the next month, Osborn and his associates were faced with such problems as the victualling of new settlers, and the suppression of “the scandalous practice of selling meat and other things publicly on the Lord’s Day.”\n\nPatrick Mackellar (1717-1778)\n\nPatrick Mackellar, one of the most esteemed military engineers of his generation, deserves a significant share of the credit for the capitulation of Louisbourg in July 1757.\n\nJeffery Amherst (1717-1797)\n\nAmherst and Boscawen insisted that the garrison of Fortress Louisbourg must become prisoners of war, and demanded an answer within an hour, failing which the town would be attacked by land and sea.\n\nAlexander Colvill, 7th Baron Colvill (1717-1770)\n\nIn March 1755 Colvill sailed in Northumberland with Admiral Boscawen, taking part in the attempt to intercept French reinforcements to North America, and returning with Boscawen’s squadron in November. In the following year Northumberland cruised in home waters; in 1757 she sailed in Vice-Admiral Francis Holburne’s squadron to Nova Scotia. After the attempt to capture Louisbourg, Île Royale (Cape Breton Island), that year had been given up, Northumberland was among the ships lying in wait off Louisbourg for the French fleet in the harbour, and she was caught in the disastrous hurricane of September 1757. She sailed then to Halifax, and when Holburne returned to England in November he left Colvill in charge as commander-in-chief. Holburne instructed Colvill to prepare a careening wharf in Halifax and to have the squadron ready for sea as early as possible for the Louisbourg expedition of 1758.\n\nRichard Bulkeley (1717-1800)\n\nProvincial secretary, councillor, brigadier-general of the provincial militia\n\nFrancis McLean (c.1717-1781)\n\nAll ships lost – the worst defeat suffered by the United States navy\n\nbefore 7 December 1941.\n\nOn 16 June 1779, under the orders of Sir Henry Clinton, the commander-in-chief in North America, McLean took an expedition of about 650 men to Fort Majebigwaduce (Castine, Maine) to find a refuge for Loyalists and to forestall an anticipated attack on Nova Scotia by troops from New England. From 25 July an American force of between 2,000 and 3,000 soldiers and sailors in some forty vessels under the command of Dudley Saltonstall besieged him there. McLean faced desperate odds. Although he had not had nearly enough time to complete his fortifications, he resolved to stand his ground while sending for help. A gale drove back one relief force from Halifax, but Sir George Collier sailed from Sandy Hook, New Jersey, on 3 August and engaged the Americans on the 14th, routing them completely. McLean’s casualties amounted to only 23 killed, 35 wounded, and 11 missing.\n\nJoseph Coulon de Villiers de Jumonville (1718-1754)\n\nIn February 1747 Nicolas-Antoine Coulon de Villiers, a brother of Joseph Coulon de Villiers de Jumonville, led a force of about 250 Canadians in an assault on over 500 New England troops commanded by Arthur Noble at Grand-Pré, Nova Scotia.\n\nJohn Breynton (1719-1799)\n\nBreynton entered the service of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel on 17 April 1752 and was sent to Halifax, Nova Scotia.\n\nÉtienne Bâtard (fl. 1750s)\n\nÉtienne Bâtard is believed to have murdered Edward How in September 1750, at the Missaguash River.\n\nWilliam Nesbitt ( ? -1784)\n\nIn 1758 Nesbitt was elected to Nova Scotia’s first House of Assembly and the next year he was appointed its second speaker.\n\nJean-Baptiste Dupleix Silvain (1721-c.1796)\n\nThroughout the 1745 siege of Louisbourg, Dupleix Silvain served bravely in the town militia (as he was to do again in 1758) and after the fall of the fortress was deported to La Rochelle. He was taken prisoner by the British for the fourth time in 1793 and held captive for 28 months.\n\nGaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de Léry (1721-1797)\n\n[Not to be confused with Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de Léry (1682-1756)]\n\nIn 1750 and 1751 Léry worked in the Chignecto Isthmus, mapping, writing papers on the geography of the region, and building stockade forts. In the latter year he was sent by La Jonquière to France and delivered the reports and plans made in Acadia to the minister of Marine, Rouillé.\n\nJ.F.W. DesBarres (1721-1824)\n\nArmy officer, military engineer, surveyor, and colonial administrator\n\nLieutenant Governor of Cape Breton Island, 26 August 1784 – 1787\n\nIsaac Deschamps (1722?-1801)\n\nIsaac Deschamps is believed to have been born in Switzerland in 1722 and came to Halifax in 1749, the year the city was founded. Fluent in French and English, he was a natural choice as an agent for merchants trading with the Acadians and Mi’kmaq and was often called upon to translate official documents. Between 1759 and 1783 he served as MLA for a succession of ridings – Annapolis County, Falmouth Township and Newport Township. On the death of Chief Justice Bryan Finucane in August 1785, Deschamps, as senior judge, became acting Chief Justice. Although he had not received any legal training, he had had years of experience in various courts and had entered in his diary extensive notes on previous decisions. Nevertheless, Deschamps and his colleague James Brenton had an all but impossible task in trying to provide biannual circuit courts in six townships throughout the province. Deschamps’ time as acting Chief Justice ended when Jeremy Pemberton was named Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in August 1788. As late as 1799 he accepted an appointment as road commissioner for Kings County. Isaac Deschamps had a long and busy life in Nova Scotia, and few spoke ill of him. Deschamps’s honesty can hardly be questioned: in a day when many profited from patronage open to them, he left only a tiny estate. Kindly and compassionate to all persons, he was an untiring public servant, and it is noteworthy that there were so few complaints about his work in so many commissions and duties.\n\nNicolas Larcher (1722-1788)\n\nMerchant, and French colonial official\n\nAntoine Rodrigue (1722-1789)\n\nShip’s captain, merchant, and French colonial official\n\nBruin R. Comingo (1723-1820)\n\nWool-comber, fisherman, German Reformed minister\n\nJean Pettrequin (c.1724-1764)\n\nPettrequin arrived in Nova Scotia from Montbéliard in July 1752 aboard the Betty, a ship carrying European Protestant settlers. These “foreign Protestants,” as they were called, had been arriving in Halifax since 1750, and were part of a British plan to populate Nova Scotia without drawing off badly needed agricultural workers from Britain. For the most part the new settlers were Germans and Swiss. They were offered an initial grant of 50 acres* of land free of quit rents and taxes for ten years, with additional grants as their families increased. Free subsistence was granted them for a year upon arrival, as well as any necessary arms, and materials and utensils for clearing and cultivating land and erecting dwellings.\n\n* 50 acres = 20 hectares\n\nGuy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester (1724-1808)\n\nCarleton was at New York from May 1782 till November 1783, where one of his responsibilities was to evacuate some 30,000 troops and up to 27,000 refugees. The latter included several thousand former slaves who, over George Washington’s protests, were helped to emigrate to the Caribbean and to Nova Scotia, where about 1,200 settled near Halifax. Carleton also urged the lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia, Sir Andrew Snape Hamond, and then the new governor, John Parr, to grant Loyalists free land and a year’s provisions and prompted Frederick Haldimand to do the same for those who entered Canada.\n\nDeborah How (c.1725-1806)\n\nDeborah How was raised in Canso, where her father was the leading merchant and civilian official. The family’s strong New England ties and her father’s fluency in languages assured her a sound education, likely at home. She was married at an early age, and her first child, Martha Grace, was 11 days old when Canso fell to the French in May 1744. The community’s buildings were burnt and the garrison families were removed as prisoners to Louisbourg, Île Royale.\n\nAlexander McNutt (1725-c.1811)\n\nAlexander McNutt was a persuasive speaker and memorialist, with elaborate plans for bringing settlers to Nova Scotia in the 1760s.\n\nJoshua Mauger (1725-1788)\n\nBetween 1740 and 1760 Mauger took part in some 52 property transactions in Halifax. He received some land in the form of direct grants from the government and acquired other properties from bankrupt merchants or from tradesmen who were indebted to him. Outside of Halifax he owned land in Lunenburg, Annapolis Royal, and Windsor, a 20,000-acre* tract in Cumberland County and an estate on St. John’s (Prince Edward) Island.\n\n* 20,000 acres = 31 square miles = 8,100 hectares = 81 square kilometres\n\nJoshua Mauger (1725-1788)\n\nThe History of Parliament (London)\n\nthe House of Commons 1754-1790\n\nJoseph Goreham (1725-1790)\n\nIn the early 1750s, Gorham’s Rangers were used in Nova Scotia to protect the new British settlements such as Lunenburg against Indian raids until the outbreak of the Seven Years’ War, when they became increasingly involved in major military operations because of their skill in irregular warfare. In July 1757, for example, Goreham and some of his men were dispatched to reconnoitre Louisbourg for Lord Loudoun’s expedition. In 1758 they served under Amherst at the successful siege of the fortress.\n\nJohn Parr (1725-1791)\n\nIn July 1782 Parr was appointed governor of Nova Scotia. He was at once confronted with the urgent and immense task of succouring and settling some 35,000 Loyalists who flooded into Nova Scotia at the end of the American Revolution in 1783. With the colony’s population more than doubled overnight, impossible strains were placed on Nova Scotia’s rudimentary administrative machinery as well as on stores and provisions. In the winter of 1782-83 ten thousand refugees arrived helpless and destitute at Halifax, and as makeshift accommodation warehouses, sheds, and churches had to be commandeered, ships detained in port, and improvised shelters erected in open places.\n\nRobert Stobo (1726-1770)\n\nWhile being held at Quebec as a hostage, Robert Stobo escaped twice, in May and July 1757, and was captured twice. On his third attempt (1 May 1759), he fled down the St. Lawrence River in a canoe with eight other American prisoners. Thirty-six days later, after a series of hair-raising escapes and hardships, they sailed triumphantly into Louisbourg, Cape Breton Island (then held by the British) in command of a French schooner, which they had taken in the Baie des Chaleurs, and with two captive French sea captains.\n\nJonathan Eddy (1727-1804)\n\nThe Eddy Rebellion\n\nDuring late 1775 and early 1776, when the American Revolution was getting under way in the Thirteen Colonies*, Jonathan Eddy, then living in the Chignecto region of Nova Scotia and a Member of Nova Scotia’s Legislature, developed a plan to precipitate a major insurrection in the colony. Eddy hoped to achieve this by persuading George Washington and the Continental Congress to send an “army of liberation” to Nova Scotia. In February 1776 Eddy and fourteen associates left the Chignecto region to discuss the situation with Washington. On 27 March 1776 General Washington listened to Eddy’s arguments for invading Nova Scotia but declined to offer any military assistance. In Halifax, Eddy was charged with treason.\n\n* The Thirteen Colonies were Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia — but not Maine or Vermont.\n\nJean Manach (c.1727-1766)\n\nManach was closely involved in the border incidents which began in September 1750 while forts Beauséjour and Lawrence were being constructed on the Chignecto Isthmus.\n\nJames Wolfe (1727-1759)\n\nArmy officer\n\nJoshua Winslow (1727-1801)\n\nArmy and militia officer, diarist, judge, and politician\n\nIn 1765 Winslow was among the leading men of Cumberland County who petitioned for the county’s representation in the House of Assembly.\n\nCharles Deschamps de Boishébert et de Raffetot (1727-1797)\n\nIn October 1746, Boishébert took part in the unsuccessful siege of Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, the British administrative and military headquarters in Acadia. During the winter Ramezay prepared an expedition against the force under Arthur Noble which was stationed at Grand Pré. Boishébert was wounded in the battle fought there on 11 February 1747.\n\nSamuel Johannes Holland (1728-1801)\n\nIn 1765 Holland had surveyed the Îles de la Madeleine, and then moved on to Cape Breton Island, where work had been begun by Charles Morris in 1764. Cape Breton Island was divided – in the same manner as St. John’s Island (Prince Edward Island) – into *counties of approximately 500,000 acres, *parishes of around 100,000 acres, and *townships of about 20,000 acres, surveyed with precision by fixing latitudes and longitudes from astronomical observation; he also took careful soundings in coastal waters. The completed maps and reports, which Holland had sent to London by July 1767, indicated that in addition to its fisheries Cape Breton was valuable chiefly for its coal, building stone, and gypsum, although it was also suited in a few areas to agriculture. In 1768 Holland expressed the view that Cape Breton Island could not develop its resources energetically as long as it remained administratively dependent on Nova Scotia; it was separated from that colony in 1784. While the survey on Cape Breton Island was being finished, in 1767 Holland’s survey parties were working in the Gaspé around Baie des Chaleurs and on Anticosti Island. Holland made his home at Louisbourg for much of the period 1765-67.\n\n(county) * 500,000 acres = 775 square miles = 202,000 hectares = 2020 square kilometres\n\n(parish) * 100,000 acres = 155 square miles = 40,500 hectares = 405 square kilometres\n\n(township) * 20,000 acres = 31 square miles = 8,100 hectares = 81 square kilometres\n\nWinckworth Tonge (1728-1792)\n\n[Not to be confused with William Cottnam Tonge (1764-1832)]\n\nArmy officer, officeholder, politician, and landowner\n\nJames Cook (1728-1779)\n\nNaval officer, surveyor, and explorer\n\nCaptain James Cook, of England’s Royal Navy, is best known for his exploits in the Pacific between the years 1776, and the year of his death in the Hawaiian Islands, in 1779. But what must be remembered, in considering the history of Nova Scotia, is that James Cook played a significant role in it as he cruised the coasts of Nova Scotia as a junior naval officer during the final years of that period when the French were to lose possession of Acadia, and, for that matter, all Canada: 1756-1763. One need only look at the record and see what Sir Charles Hardy had to say when he and his fleet of ten warships came back into Halifax harbour on March 19th, 1758. He finds the squadron that had “wintered at Halifax in a great state of forwardness.” The point here is, that it is no easy trick to see a large wooden sailing vessel, much less a group of them, through to the end of a cold Acadian winter – one usually sailed them into tropic waters for semi-refit, or back to England (or France) for a full-refit. Further, it is no small task, even in the best of circumstances (experienced men, facilities, tools, and, of course the weather in which to work), to get a British war ship ready for the next season; especially when she had a hard run through the previous season. But the feat that earned the most respect for James Cook by those in charge, was the work that Cook and Holland completed, which enabled Admiral Saunders to bring all of his invasion fleet through to Quebec in the spring of 1759, without major mishap: this feat being the compilation of all known charts of the area (mostly they were French).\n\nJoseph Peters (1729-1800)\n\nSoldier, schoolmaster, and postmaster\n\nIn 1782 he became unofficial postmaster of Nova Scotia and succeeded to the office of deputy postmaster general in 1785. As postmaster Peters’ main innovation was to initiate a regular courier service between Halifax and Annapolis Royal, where the mail was carried by boat to Digby and across the Bay of Fundy to New Brunswick (which in 1784 was separated from Nova Scotia to become a new colony). By 1788 a regular service to Quebec was established to coincide with the visits of the New York-Falmouth packet* at Halifax for eight months of the year. The irregularities, expenses, and frustrations of the postal service made Peters’ life as a public servant far from enviable. The General Post Office in London remained singularly unsympathetic to the pleas of the hard-pressed postmaster for a higher salary and reimbursement of the considerable expenses of his office. Although between 1785 and 1792 his stipend climbed from £50 to £250, financial anxiety constantly plagued him.\n\n*Packet – a boat that carries mail with a published schedule of sailing dates; a ship employed by government to convey official messages or mail; a vessel employed in conveying dispatches, mails, passengers, and goods, on a fixed schedule.\n\nGeorge Scott ( ? -1767)\n\nGeorge Scott had an important role in the capture of Fortress Louisbourg in 1758.\n\nJoseph Scott ( ? -1800)\n\nIn 1759, Joseph Scott was elected to the second House of Assembly as one of the first two members from Kings County.\n\nJohn Butler (fl.1749-1791)\n\n[Not to be confused with John Butler (1728-1796)]\n\n[Not to be confused with John Butler Dight (c.1760-1834)]\n\nJohn Butler came to Halifax via Long Island, New York. He received property in the first allotment of land in Halifax in 1749, acquired further large holdings in what later became Hants County, and some time before 1754 erected the Great Pontack Inn, the centre of social activities in Halifax. By 1758 he was referred to as a distiller, probably because of his connection with Joshua Mauger. Butler acted as business agent for the English firm of Watson and Rashleigh, and when Mauger left Nova Scotia in 1760, Butler became his attorney-agent there. With Michael Francklin and Isaac Deschamps he protected Mauger’s economic and political interests in the province. In 1762 Butler was elected to the House of Assembly as one of the members for Halifax County. Ten years later he was appointed to the Council on the recommendation of Francklin, then lieutenant governor, and became agent victualler and paymaster of the troops in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland on the death of Benjamin Gerrish. He was made lieutenant-colonel in the Halifax militia in January 1774, appointed a justice of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas three months later, and commissioned a full colonel in the militia in November 1776.\n\nJacob Bailey (1731-1808)\n\nBailey’s literary accomplishments mark him as one of the first important figures in Canadian literature. Born in Rowley, Massachusetts in 1731, Bailey graduated from Harvard last in his class (in the days when the list was arranged by family wealth). In 1782, to escape the persecution and injustice he suffered as a Loyalist in New England during the American Revolution, he fled with his family to Nova Scotia, and lived the rest of his life in the town of Annapolis Royal. Here Jacob Bailey discovered a talent for verse satire in the style of the English poet Samuel Butler. Between 1779 and 1784 he wrote some outstanding anti-rebel satires, including a long work entitled America, in which he pointed out the causes of the revolution from a Loyalist perspective.\n\nCharles Morris [2nd] (1731-1802)\n\n[Not to be confused with Charles Morris [1st] (1711-1781)]\n\n[Not to be confused with Charles Morris [3rd] (1759-1831)]\n\nSurveyor, politician, office holder, and judge\n\nOn 25 September 1749, Governor Edward Cornwallis appointed Charles Morris [1st] (1711-1781) “Chief Surveyor of Lands within this Province.” Charles Morris [1st] was surveyor general of lands for the province for 32 years 1749-1781, a period which saw the founding of Halifax and Lunenburg and the coming of the pre-loyalists, when the colony’s foundations were laid. The Council had every confidence in his decisions and actions, and the chronicler of 18th-century Nova Scotia, John Bartlet Brebner, praised him for his honest impartiality. Charles Morris [2nd] (1731-1802) apparently came to Nova Scotia in 1760. From then until 1781 he assisted his father, Charles Morris [1st], Nova Scotia’s first surveyor general; between 1776 and 1781 he performed the tasks of the office alone. In 1772 the possibility that his father might lose his position spurred Morris [2nd], with his father’s approval, to seek it for himself. He enlisted J.F.W. DesBarres to promote his cause in England and in return looked after DesBarres’s land interests in Nova Scotia. Morris [2nd] however, had to wait until after his fathers death in 1781 to obtain the position. In 1802, Charles Morris [3rd] (1759-1831) succeeded his father, Charles Morris [2nd], as surveyor general. In April 1831 he was replaced by his son John Spry Morris, who served until the office was merged with that of commissioner of crown lands in 1851. Four members of the Morris family — 1749-1781, 1781-1802, 1802-1831, and 1831-1852 — thus held the position of surveyor general of Nova Scotia for its entire existence 1749-1851, a continuity of service rivalled only by that of the Wrights of Prince Edward Island. The Morris family had the reputation in Nova Scotia of being good administrators and surveyors.\n\nDavid Mathews (c.1732-1800)\n\nMayor of New York City 1776-1783\n\nAdministrator of Cape Breton Island, 27 May 1795 – 29 June 1798\n\nMichael Francklin (1733-1782)\n\nWhen Michael Francklin arrived in Halifax on a ship from Jamaica in the summer of 1752, the leading merchant in Halifax was probably Joshua Mauger, who sponsored Francklin’s first Halifax enterprise, a dram-shop on George Street. Although many merchants failed during the highly unstable times of the mid 1750s, Francklin’s business concerns boomed. The Seven Years War (1754-1763) proved to be a financial windfall for Francklin. He secured several lucrative contracts to provision the British forces at Halifax and later at Quebec. Problems of wartime supply led to scarcities which increased both prices and profits, particularly in rum and fish. Investments in privateering brought him additional income. During the war he became an exceedingly wealthy man. His marriage to the granddaughter of Peter Faneuil, one of the most important Boston merchants, cemented his business relations with New England. Francklin’s involvement in politics began in 1759, when he was elected to the House of Assembly to fill one of the first two seats for Lunenburg Township; in 1761-62 he served as a member for Halifax County. During the American revolution (1775-1783) Francklin remained loyal to the crown. Unlike most merchants, however, he was not passive in his loyalty. In 1777 he was appointed superintendent of Indian affairs for the province, a position for which he was uniquely qualified. In 1754 he had been captured by a band of Micmacs and taken to the Gaspé. During his three months of captivity he learned their language and developed a respect for the Indian culture. Francklin, who spoke French, was also influential among the Acadians. Francklin must be considered one of the truly important founders of the province.\n\nAnthony Henry (1734-1800)\n\n[Not to be confused with Anthony Henry Holland (1785-1830)]\n\nThe first Canadian newspaper to operate\n\nindependently of government patronage\n\nand\n\nThe first King’s Printer of Nova Scotia\n\nIn 1758 Henry served with the British forces as a regimental fifer at the capture of Louisbourg, Île Royale (Cape Breton Island). It is believed that after his discharge Henry worked in a New Jersey printing office for two years. He then joined John Bushell’s shop in Halifax. He was made a partner in the business on 23 September 1760 and took control of it after Bushell’s death in 1761. Henry continued the publication of the Halifax Gazette, but his business was mainly government printing and stationery. The Halifax Gazette ceased to appear in mid-1766. In 1769, Henry founded the Nova Scotia Chronicle and Weekly Advertiser, the first newspaper in what is now Canada to run independent of government patronage. This newspaper, renamed the Royal Gazette and the Nova-Scotia Advertiser in 1789, lasted for thirty years and increasingly became an outlet for official information. In 1788 Henry was officially commissioned King’s Printer, an appointment which removed much of the uncertainty in his contract with the government. His commission is one of the earliest and most important documents in the history of Canadian publishing.\n\nCharles Inglis (1734-1816)\n\nChurch of England clergyman, bishop, and author\n\nThe British evacuation of New York in November 1783 forced Charles Inglis to resign his rectorship of Trinity Church in New York and return to England, where he spent the next three years jockeying with fellow refugees for pensions and preferments. Although he was unable to find the comfortable living in the United Kingdom for which he yearned, he did secure, with the patronage of Lord Dorchester [Guy Carleton], appointment in 1787 as first bishop of Nova Scotia, a position he held until his death. His diocese included not only the colony of Nova Scotia but also Newfoundland, St. John’s (Prince Edward) Island, Quebec province, and Bermuda.\n\nWilliam Spry (1734-1802)\n\nIn about 1770, Captain William Spry purchased some land in Nova Scotia and established the settlement known as Spryfield.\n\nCaptain William Spry Community Centre\n\nBrook Watson (1736-1807)\n\nIn 1749 Brook Watson was a teenaged orphan serving as a crew member on a trading ship owned by his uncle and foster father, John Huston, then of Boston and later Cumberland County, Nova Scotia. Watson lost his right leg below the knee when he was attacked by a shark while swimming in Havana harbour, the earliest attack by a shark on a human to be fully documented. In 1752 young Brook Watson became secretary to Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Monckton at Fort Lawrence (near Amherst, Nova Scotia). By the early 1770s Watson had acquired considerable land holdings in Nova Scotia, and was the dominant figure in the commerce of the province. In 1773, he was a partner in London exporting firm of Watson and Rashleigh that shipped the tea that became the target of the Boston Tea Party – Watson’s tea was dumped into the Boston Harbor. In the mid-1780s he moved to London, and eventually served as chairman of Lloyd’s of London and Deputy Governor of the Bank of England. He became, in 1796, the first one-legged Lord Mayor of London.\n\nBrook Watson (1735(sic)-1807)\n\nThe History of Parliament (London)\n\nthe House of Commons 1754-1790\n\nJames Brenton (1736-1806)\n\nLawyer, militia officer, politician, office holder, judge\n\nRanald McKinnon (1737-1805)\n\nArmy officer, office holder, and militia officer\n\nSir John Wentworth (1737-1820)\n\nRoyal governor of New Hampshire 1766-1776.\n\nLieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia 1792-1808.\n\nTheophilus Chamberlain (1737-1824)\n\nAs the British occupation of New York City drew to a close in mid-1783, Chamberlain accepted a captain’s commission in the city militia from Sir Guy Carleton with responsibility for arranging the transfer to Halifax of a group of refugees. With his family and friends he reached there in the early fall of 1783. Almost at once he was commissioned a justice of the peace, named a deputy surveyor, appointed to lay out a new township east of Dartmouth, and made agent to distribute land within the area. The actual grant in December 1784 gave Chamberlain and 143 others, including Loyalists, blacks, disbanded soldiers, and Germans, a “plantation” of *32,000 acres in Preston, his name for the new township.\n\n* 32,000 acres = 50 square miles = 13,000 hectares = 130 square kilometres\n\nThomas Peters (c.1738-1792)\n\nAs a result of Peters’ charges Governor Parr was ordered to institute an inquiry into the Annapolis area land problem. If Peters’ description proved accurate the blacks were to be located immediately on good land. Those who chose not to accept grants could either enlist in a black army unit for service in the West Indies or remove to Sierra Leone. In the fall of 1791 Peters visited Annapolis and Saint John to promote the colonization scheme. Lieutenant John Clarkson of the Royal Navy, brother of the abolitionist Thomas Clarkson, was appointed to recruit the emigrants and organize their safe passage, arrived in October. He toured the black settlements in Halifax and Shelburne counties with the same intent. In New Brunswick Peters met with determined opposition from the whites, who did not wish to lose cheap labour or have his charges corroborated by mass emigration. False debts and indentures were fabricated, officials harassed Peters and his recruits by demanding proof of free status, and the story was spread that Peters would receive a fee for every black he inveigled to Africa for sale into slavery. The situation in New Brunswick was not exceptional. Agents appointed by both colonial governments to publicize the alternatives available to blacks deliberately misconstrued the Sierra Leone Company‘s intentions. The blacks nevertheless responded with enthusiasm to the offer of free land, racial equality, and full British rights in Sierra Leone. Some 1,200 emigrants gathered in Halifax, almost 500 of them from Peters’ recruitment areas.\n\nIsrael Perley (1738-1813)\n\nIn 1763, a number of families, led by Israel Perley, arrived in four vessels from New England, and settled at Maugerville, on the St. John – the first permanent British settlement above the mouth of the river. In 1765, this district (including the St. John and Passamaquoddy river valleys) was erected into a county called the county of Sunbury in the province of Nova Scotia. Until 1784 this region was administered by the Nova Scotia government in Halifax.\n\nJames Fulton (1739-1826)\n\nJP, judge, militia officer, surveyor, and politician\n\nJohn Murray (c.1739-1824)\n\nAdministrator of Cape Breton Island, 21 June 1799 – 16 September 1800\n\nBefore leaving Halifax in mid-June 1799, Murray was given all the lurid details of the political quarrelling in Cape Breton. The contending parties, both trying to gain the ear of the colony’s ruler, were headed by the Reverend Ranna Cossit and Attorney General David Mathews. When Murray arrived in Cape Breton on June 21st he was particularly suspicious of Mathews, about whom he had been warned in Halifax. But in an effort to follow the non-partisan path of the absentee lieutenant governor, William Macarmick, he appointed his Executive Council from both parties. Mathews made it practically impossible to maintain this balance.\n\nBryan Finucane (1740?-1785)\n\nBryan Finucane was born in County Clare, Ireland, sometime before 1744. He studied law at London’s Middle Temple, was admitted the Irish bar in 1764 and practiced in Dublin for several years. Finucane was appointed Chief Justice of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court in December 1776 but did not arrive in Halifax until April 1778. He was sworn into office on 1 May 1778. Finucane balked at traveling on circuit and tried, unsuccessfully, to reduce the length of sittings in Halifax. He was granted a leave of absence to travel to England, where he spent most of 1782-1783. Upon his return he was sent to New Brunswick to help settle the claims of recently-arrived Loyalist refugees who were demanding a redistribution of water lots in Saint John, which, they claimed, had been unfairly assigned to interested officials and their friends. George Leonard, a director of the town and an owner of some of the disputed properties, accused Finucane of crediting “every idle report from Barbers and Grog shops.” Finucane promptly redistributed some of the contested lots. Considered a man of great integrity and an “upright judge,” Finucane died in Halifax in August 1785.\n\nSource: Chief Justices\n\nProvided by: the Executive Office of the Nova Scotia Judiciary\n\nJames Ogilvie (c.1740-1813)\n\nAdministrator of Cape Breton Island, 29 June 1798 – 21 June 1799\n\nOgilvie’s chief contributions to the development of Cape Breton were his bringing 150 troops to protect the colony, undefended since 1793; his organization of the colonial militia after Macarmick’s failure to do so; his improvement of the Sydney harbour defences; and his development of the coal mines.\n\nJohn Crosskill (1740-1826)\n\n[Not to be confused with his grandson John Henry Crosskill (1817-1857)]\n\nShip’s captain and landowner\n\nUnder the command of John Crosskill, who was described by Beamish Murdoch as “a skilled pilot,” the Earl of Moira – a snow of 135 tons mounting 14 guns which had been built for the Nova Scotia government service in 1794 – was employed in protecting the fisheries along the coast of Nova Scotia and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, convoying merchant vessels to Quebec, driving off smugglers, and watching for privateers. In August 1795, moreover, Lieutenant Governor John Wentworth reported that the vessel had been of great assistance to the local Gaspé"
