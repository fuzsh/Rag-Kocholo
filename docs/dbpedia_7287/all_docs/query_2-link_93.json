L. Jenyns; and of the Reptiles, by Mr. Bell. I have appended to the descriptions of each species an account of its habits and range. Reginald H. Tupper was a soldier, and a barrister. Reginald H. Tupper was Dean of the Vancouver Law School from 1938 to 1943, the forerunner of Faculty of Law at the University of British Columbia (UBC); he advocated for such a faculty at a post-secondary level.
