To give you the short version, I married my bass player, our daughter is 24 and an awesome musician, and we are still playing and recording music; different band names of course. I'm not sure where all the Frost members are. Maybe we'll connect here...I have lots of our old recordings from about Seaway time.

I had great memories hanging out with you guys. I always felt like I'd missed something historically monumental by not being able to see the \"summer of love\" happening in San Francisco ( way too young) but, with all respect, you guys seemed to have captured a microcosm of that world for anyone who knew you and the band. The music, creativity, individualism, etc. all good stuff.\n\nCiao, B.

A BIG SHOUT OUT TO all the bands we competed in the \"Battle of the Bands\" at the Teen Fair held at the Memorial Coliseum and all the guys who were in the band after my departure.

Bainbridge Island, WA.\n\nComments: Scott, the drummer, was the one person who lasted thru all the changes (except for a short hitch in the reserve, when rim-shot Mike filled in. Scott and I were stolen from the \"Tremblers\" (who are not on, but will be, this site)and added to a group which became the \"El Caminos\". Dick Earle was lead guitar of the Tremblers. I was 2nd fiddle... I mean rhythem. They did mostly Duane Eddy type stuff, and all was instrumental... we couldn't sing, and in 58-60 that was not that important. Anyway, back to the El Caminos. Gary Stackhouse was on lead, me on 2nd, I don't know on 3rd...arrghhh\n\nMicky Enos, who was a verrrry old 23 or so, was on sax, and played it reallly well. Gary Snyder (later with the viceroys and Dynamics) played bass, and a cute girl named Georgia was our parttime gal singer, with Tiny Tony as the main draw for quite a while(later with other groups like \"The Statics\" et.al.). Hey, this could become a book! In late '61 I ended up in the army for 3 years. When I got back, Scott was still drummin' away. Everyone else was different. It was still the El Caminos. I joined as keyboard player. If you go to our page on this site you'll here a bit of \"Hog for You Baby\" (which I always hated). We recorded that in someone's basement. Had egg cartons covering the walls to dampen extraneous? sound.\n\none of my favorite gigs was a battle with The Dynamics at Parkers. Of course it wasn't a real battle. Dynamics were more polished from the start, but our lead vocal, Woody could hold his own, or more, against Jimmy Hanna ... woo woo.\n\nAnyhow, we faded in and out of obscurity in the Northwest until '68, when, as all bands, do, we broke up, leaving our 2nd name \"The Entertainers with Woody Carr, and our short moment in the sun, to slip away into the night. Scott, the only level-headed member of the band (and keeper of the books & money), was to help many of us reunite after almost 40 years. It was the greatest get-together. Far Out! Outta Site,Man!\n\nSo, to all my fellow band mates, Scott, Dick E., Mark W.,Mike N., John S., Woody Carr, Tiny Tony, Georgia, Dave C, Dave R., Micky E., Gary Snyder, Gary Stackhouse,..from me Gary (Baron Von*)Carter, I'll be seein' ya when I see ya. *A cute little read-headed gal at a White Center dance hall gave me that monicker.\n\nFriday 07/31/2009 4:58:52pm\n\nName: Dorie\n\nE-Mail: Aries.1jm@gmail.com\n\nThis Message is for: Anyone that went to the Breakers\n\nReferred By: God sent me\n\nWhere Are You?

Remember the apartment on 5th(?)St. You and Larry Rodman were roommates. I lived upstairs (above Mary). Was surfing around and ended up on Pacific Northwest Bands website - saw an old clip and heard \"Buy for me the Rain\". I had written down the lyrics back then and hearing it sure brought back memories of the 60's. Hope you (and Larry) are doing well and just as crazy as ever. Thanks for the glimpse back in time.\n\nSunday 07/12/2009 9:02:10pm\n\nName: james lawwill\n\nE-Mail: james.lawwill@tusd1.org\n\nThis Message is for: those who care\n\nReferred By: Just Dumb Luck\n\nWhere Are You? tucson, Arizona\n\nComments: I was the lead singer of the Rapid Transit, the correct spellings for Rapid Transit members are Jim Lawwill and Gene Slaght\n\nSaturday 07/11/2009 2:13:30pm\n\nName: dave smith\n\nE-Mail: smutz@telus.net\n\nThis Message is for: doug boychuk\n\nReferred By: Just Dumb Luck\n\nComments: old \"dominion bridge\" calgary connection....give me a relpy \"honky\"\n\nThursday 07/09/2009 11:21:40pm\n\nName: radell winters\n\nE-Mail: radell_w@hotmail.com\n\nThis Message is for: folks from \"sound farm ltd.\"\n\nReferred By: Just Dumb Luck\n\nWhere Are You? madera, ca\n\nComments: i'm rodney winters' daughter and tim winters' niece. tim was in a band called the sound farm ltd. and since his death the family has been trying to track down old recordings, pictures, etc. if anyone could help me out, please email me... radell_w@hotmail.com....that would just be amazing!! thank you.\n\nThursday 07/09/2009 11:10:38pm\n\nName: Ron Pelland\n\nE-Mail: pelland@sbcglobal.net\n\nThis Message is for: Robert Pelland\n\nReferred By: Just Dumb Luck\n\nWhere Are You?

I went on to become a high school band director. I have just retired and have a consulting contract teaching teachers in Shenzhen, China.
