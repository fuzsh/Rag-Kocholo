He thought Confederation would let Nova Scotia continue to live.\n\nPEACE.\n\nWho is Frances Morse?\n\nFrances Morse was the wife of Sir Charles Tupper, one of the former Prime Ministers of Canada. They were married in 1846 and she died in 1912.\n\nWhat were the accomplishments of Sir Charles Tupper?\n\nHe was one of the Fathers of Confederation bringing in Nova Scotia as one of the charter provinces. I'd say that was a pretty good accomplishment. There are no doubt many others but that seems like a biggie. His short time as Canadian Prime Minister does not seem to have had the same lasting effect."
