        "text": "Mr. GERMAN.\n\nThe hon. gentleman cannot mention the name of an expert workman from Canada working on the international bridge wdio was deported. Why, they have only begun to work on the American side of that bridge within the last mouth. This all shows that hon. gentlemen opposite in order to make a point if possible against the government, will endeavour to garble the facts. I happen to know that the international bridge has not been built to the international channel until the last month. It is not all completed yet. They have just begun at the drawbridge there lately. There has never been an expert Canadian w-ho worked on the international bridge deported even by Mr. DeBarry, who has been the most effective officer in the United States service so far as .\n\ndeporting aliens is concerned. The Canadian Alien Labour law is, with slight exceptions, a verbatim copy of the United States Alien Labour law. The greatest difficulty that has arisen hitherto in regard to the enforcement of the Canadian Alien Labour law has been by reason of the very active operations of Mr. DeBarry, of Buffalo. We do not hear any complaint about it between Detroit and Windsor. We do not hear any complaint about it between the town of Niagara Falls on the Canadian side, and the city of Niagara Falls on the American side. I have heard something to-night about Prescott. I know nothing about the St. Lawrence district, but I venture to say that east of British Columbia, Mr. DeBarry the United States official has created more difficulty in regard to the operation of the Alien Labour law than any other one man either in the United States or Canada, by reason of his very great industry. He appears to be supported by the labour unions in the city of Buffalo, and he has continually and deliberately violated the Alien Labour law of the United States. He has exceeded the duty imposed upon him by the law of the United States. I know that he has taken Canadians who have gone to the United States and sent them back, just as illegally as he would take me or any other hon. member of this House by the shoulder and send us back. He has done it in violation of the Act, by reason of the pressure brought to bear upon him by the labour unions of the city of Buffalo. However, it has been done, in the county I have the honour to represent, it has created a good deal of friction. It was used as a political influence against me in the last election. It was said that I was not doing my duty to the labouring men, although I showed the people that I had been doing my duty. My opponent endeavoured to convince the public that the government had not been doing its duty-that it had put a law on the statute-book, and had not been endeavouring to enforce it. So far as I am concerned, I desire to see the Alien Labour law of this country enforced, and enforced properly in the interest of the public.\n\nThere are cases when it is in the interest of the Canadian people themselves that aliens should be employed in this country. There are occasions when you cannot get in this country the labouring men to do the work which you want done. There are occasions arising continually when you need employees whom you cannot get here, and it is necessary to get them in another country. Consequently, we have to be exceedingly careful in placing a law on the statute-book which will affect the rights of the public, as an Alien Labour law will affect those rights if improperly drawn and improperly carried out.\n\nI am inclined to think the law as it at present stands will bear amendment. I had intended to propose an amendment myself,\n\nand I am not certain that before this session is over 1 shall not do so, except that I hear from the government to-night that they desire that these matters shall stand over for a time, as they contemplate proposing a policy which they think may be satisfactory to the House. I am willing to bide my time and see what the proposition of the government is. If they bring down a Bill which is satisfactory, I shall be prepared to support it. If they bring down a Bill which is not satisfactory, I will rise in my place and to the best of my ability endeavour to make it satisfactory, at any rate, to me and the people whom I have the honour to represent. There is one respect in which, I think, the Alien Labour law can very properly be amended. The law at present is that you cannot contract outside the country ; that\n\nis, you cannot bring into this country aliens under contract made outside of the country. Men attempt to violate that law by telling employees to come to Canada and they will employ them here. If that objection can be got over, the law as it stands is as perfect as any Alien Labour law you can have. We have officers throughout the country with intelligence to enforce the law. I think possibly it might be made a little more elastic than it is ; it probably will be ; but I can say that the Alien Labour law as it stands to-day on the statute-book has been effective. It has been enforced wherever any gentleman has endeavoured to enforce\n\nit, and it has been a great benefit to the people of the country wherever they desired to take the benefit of it. It can be improved, but without improvement it is exceedingly better than anything hon. gentlemen opposite ever gave to the people of this country.\n\nMr. A. S. KENDALL (Cape Breton).\n\nMr. Speaker, I will not yield to the hon. member for West Toronto (Mr. Clarke) in his zeal for the workingmen. I happened to have been, along with my hon. colleague, elected for the county of Cape Breton by a majority of the votes of the workingmen of that county ; and we were elected, Sir, because during the time we served in the local legislature of Nova Scotia, we put on the statute-book of that province a considerable amount of legislation for the benefit of the miners. We can, I think, claim it as some tribute to that legislation that when a few months ago 140,000 American miners went out on strike, they struck for the very same concessions from the capitalists which we in Nova Scotia had secured by statute, chiefly at the request of the workingmen themselves. So that I have some authority to speak for the workingmen in the constituency which I have the honour to represent.\n\nNow, I cannot support this Bill, for two reasons. . In the first place, it will prohibit the importation of skilled labour from another country into this country, no matter how much we may require it. If the great Mr. GERMAN.\n\niron works in Cape Breton and the contemplated iron works at Sault Ste. Marie are not to be allowed to import alien labour, it will be impossible for us to get those great industries started in this country. Further, if the importation of such labour is prohibited, it will cut off the labour from the coal miners of this country and even the ordinary labourers, and diminish the market of the agriculturists. We have everything to lose by making an inflexible law on this question.\n\nFor one, I do not care to submit the interpretation of this law to the judgment of any two magistrates. I think we must recognize that only some man or body of men with a due sense of their responsibility can be properly entrusted with the enforcement of this Act. I know magistrates, numbers of them, who no doubt would put this Act into operation with prudence ; but we all know that there are scores of magistrates in almost every constituency who could not be trusted to adjudicate upon it with discretion and prudence.\n\nI believe I am speaking in the interest of a great many thousands of workingmen in Cape Breton and the eastern part of Nova Scotia when I say that I oppose this Bill for the reasons I have given. At the same time, it may be possible before very long to introduce some machinery for the carrying out of this law without the difficulty of approaching the Minister of Labour or the Attorney General of Canada. But, for the reasons given, I cannot see my way clear to support the Bill.\n\nMotion of the Prime Minister agreed to, and debate adjourned.\n\nADJOURNMENT-BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE. *\n\nThe PRIME MINISTER (Rt. Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier) moved the adjournment of the House."
