Ferguson: Australian leader in Merm\

A rugged soldier whol

is able to blush

By RONALD

McKIE

November 2, among the blood

" and dust of North Korea,

Lieut.-Colonel C. H. Green, com

mander of the 3rd " Battalion,

Royal Australian Regiment, died

of wounds.

Eight days later Lieutenant-Colonel

I. B. Ferguson succeeded Green, who

had so ably led the 1000 Australians

fighting with the United Nations force.

Lieutenant-Colonel Ferguson began his mili

tary career as a private footslogger in the A.IF.

in 1939.

Officers who served with him in World War

II all agree that the Australians fighting 5000

miles north of Sydney couldn't have a better

leader.

Major-General A. S. ("Tubby") Allen, whom

Ferguson impressed when he was an Intelligence

sergeant with Brigade Headquarters, Middle East,

told me:

"I remember him well. He was a fine type,

a good cove, extremely efficient. In Green and

Ferguson the Army has made two very good

choices for commanders, in Korea."

Ian Bruce Ferguson — Bruce to his friends— is j

slim, wiry, sharp-featured, black-haired, dapper, I

dashing. He talks almost abruptly. He has a i

highly developed sense of fun and an engaging

smile.

But that gives only a quick

picture. Deep down, he's a

curious mixture of what's known

as the "officer type," plus a lot

more.

He's a good conventional sol

dier—alert, tough, efficient, un-

relaxing on parade, keen on

military formalities, an unre

lenting saluter in what I once

heard a camp humorist call the

"shudder style." - .

But here is the other side to

what his friends call his "mer

curial character."

Under his veneer of toughness

he's about as hard-boiled as a

week-old kitten. He's extremely

idealistic and sentimental.

He has appealing manners

and is gallant, almost in the

Continental sense, to women.

He hands round tea and two

kinds of cake at afternoon tea

with the effortless ease of a head

waiter.

He blushes easily, particularly

if you "rag" him. That's what

I said— blushes.

One of his friends summed

him up this way: "My out

standing recollections of Bruce

are his sturdy self-sufficiency,

courage, peculiar uprightness

in bearing and character, tem

peramental moods, gaiety at

parties, and his capacity for

bottled beer.

"TT

JL JLe'S an officer who

knows instinctively how the

men feel, think, and live. He

knows because he was one of

them. He's that rare officer

who fraternises with his men,

calls them by their first names,

bu% who never loses discipline."

Bruce Ferguson, who is 33, is

not an Australian. He was born

in Wellington (N.Z.).

His father died when he was

a small boy, and his mother

later married Sydney Wren, a

New Zealander who fought as a

major in France in World War

I with the Royal Engineers.

Sydney Wren, the only father

Bruce Ferguson ever .knew, was

a much-travelled free-lance

journalist who, when he moved

about the world, always took

his family with him.

Bruce went to school in Eng

land and France. He speaks

French fluently, with a good

accent, and his sister, Philippa,

once won a prize for French at

a French school.

Sydney Wren was quite a

gourmet, and when iri France

always sent out his stepson

Bruce, as a sort of "food runner"

to tour restaurants in the neigh

borhood and report back on the

excellence, or otherwise, of the

food.

Perhaps this explains why

Bruce Ferguson was such a

good Intelligence sergeant and

officer in World War II. Per

haps his erratic, varied early

years also explain his tempera

ment and his constitutional

restlessness under static condi

tions.

He always wanted to be a

soldier. His stepfather's mili

tary record in World War I,

which included a major's rank

and the Military Cross for gal

lantry, always acted as a spur

to Bruce.

His mother, who lives with

her husband and daughter at

Bundaberg, Queensland, told

me when I called her by phone:

"Bruce has always been keen

on soldiering. We always

thought he would go a long

way."

When the Sydney Wrens re

turned to New Zealand in 1936,

Bruce Ferguson spent a little

time in Sydney before going to

Wellington and taking a job

with the Star Newspaper Ser

vice of Canada.

But he was back in Sydney

just before World War II start

ed, and, on the outbreak in Sep

tember, 1939, enlisted as a pri

vate in the A.IF., went overseas

with the 6th Division, and serv

ed in the Western Desert and

Greece.

During the attack on Bardia,

when he was an Intelligence

sergeant with 16th Brigade

H.Q.,. he added to his reputa

tion, already well established

among his cobbers, as a magnifi

cent scrounger.

He was the first Australian to

"liberate" an Italian light car

and he used it to run .between

Brigade H.Q. and Battalion.

For three days he was the only

Australian in the Western Des

ert with his private car— and

the envy of every officer and

man.

Later in the offensive he "lib

erated" a motor-cycle— also

Italian.

A mate of his once said:

"Ferguson's such a good scroun

ger that if you put him down

in the middle of the Sahara

he'd soon dig up a tin of bully,

a bottle of beer, and a dancing

girl."

Bruce Ferguson

became a lieutenant early in

1940 with the 2/2 Battalion, but

was seconded as Intelligence

Officer to Brigade H.Q.

And he was a captain early

in 1942 before his Brigade, re

turning to Australia from the

Middle East, stopped off at

Colombo to help garrison Cey

lon.

Before he left the Middle East,

and when he was stationed near

Damascus, he came back from

leave one night and accidentally

set fire to the tent he shared

with two officer friends.

"We all decided to pull his

leg — to stage a mock court-

martial and make' it look good,"

one of those officers told me.

"Bruce thought, the trial was

fair dinkum. He gave his evid

ence very seriously. He must

have thought we were getting

ready to hand him a bowler

hat.

"As a witness, I was asked to

describe the accused's condition

at the time of the fire. 'Under

the influence of liquor,' I re

plied.

"But when Bruce blushed and

gave me a dirty look I couldn't

keep my face straight. That!

was the end of the court-mar. I

fcial." I

Bruce Ferguson went to Neyl

Guinea as a company comman.H

der with the 2/2 Battalion, 16th |

Brigade,- and won his Militaryl

Cross on October 10, 1942, in thel

grim Owen Stanley fighting. |

At ATempleton's " Crossing.

about 50 miles from Port Mores I

by, the Australians put in a|

two-company attack against thel

Japanese., |

Captain Donald Fairbrother,|

how of Cessnock, led A Com- 1

pahy, and Captain Bruce Fergu-I

son led B Company. |

In a day's bitter fighting, |

which included bayonet charges

down slippery ridges, the Aus-|

tralians Cleaned up the J apan.

ese and the advance across the I

Owen Stanleys went on.

Both Ferguson and Fair-!

brother won their M.Cs. for

leadership and gallantry in that!

show I

Ferguson's M.C., the citation |

said, was, for "gallantry, deter- 1

mination, devotion to duty, and!

leadership. . . Ferguson led !

his company with dating and

determination in an attack!

down the northern spur. Thel

company suffered severe casual- !

ties, including the three platoon!

commanders. I

"He showed brilliant direction!

in successfully reorganising his!

company. . . . Later, when!

communications were disrupted! I

he moved under heavy, fire to

Battalion H.Q. with information K

which was vital later in the!

day.. . . Throughout the day I

he was an inspiration to all who I

came into contact with him." I

Back in a training I

camp at Atherton Tableland,!

North Queensland,. he re- 1

covered from malaria, but in- 1

action there bored him stiff. I

With officer friends he used!

to take a jeep, supplies, am- 1

muntion, and a radio and beat I

it up into Cape York Penin-|

sula. I

In September, 1943, .Bruce I

Ferguson went to 6th Division I

H.Q. as senior liaison officer, I

and began to study combined I

operations— his pet subject ever I

since. I

Then, after a Staff College!

course (at Duntroon) , he be- 1

came General Staff Officer ii,

Combined Operations, 7th Divi

sion, with the rank of major,

and was responsible for much

of the Division's planning and

training.

He was in the Morotai land

ing and the landing at Balik

Papan, Borneo, and was men

tioned in dispatches.

He went to Japan as a mem

ber of the 67th Battalion, when

the 34th Brigade first took up

occupation duties with the Bri

tish Commonwealth Occupation

Force. A year ago he married

Canadian Jessie Brown, a

member of the Canadian Em

bassy staff in Tokio.

Lteutenant-Colonel Ferguson

has been in Korea right from

the jump— and he looks like

being there quite a time.

But all his friends agree they

wouldn't want a better friend or

leader in a tight spot, and as

one of them adds: "Anyway, our

boys in Korea will, never starve

— not while Bruce is around,

Best scrounger I've ever

'known!"
