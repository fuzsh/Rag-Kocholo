        "text": "10 Min Read\n\nI was shocked when New Pulp author Derrick Ferguson had passed away in 2021. I don’t know what happened, but was surprised as I didn’t know he was unwell.\n\nI had read several of his works, in particular his Dillon works, and was looking forward to his next one. Now, I have no idea what will happen as he was still working on the next one and some other works as well.\n\nOne item he had done on his own website was a list of 100 New Pulp works. It was originally 25 (I thought 50) and was expanded as more New Pulp works appeared. It covers a variety of genres: pulp hero, mystery, fantasy, occult detective, etc., and from a variety of authors (successful and relatively obscure).\n\nAs this is a good list, I thought I’d help get the word out by posting it here with some of my comments, as several of them I have read and reviewed here, or hope to. Plus I can’t seem to find this list online any more, so want to be sure it’s out there.\n\nThis list is alphabetized by title.\n\nBrother Bones by Ron Fortier. This is Ron’s original pulp-style dark avenger hero. I have yet to get into these.\n\nAbraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter by Seth Graham Smith\n\nAdonis Morgan (Nobody Special) by Frank Byrns. This has stories of his original character, a former masked hero.\n\nAsian Pulp by various authors\n\nThe Auslander Files by Michael Patrick Sullivan\n\nBad Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Case Files of Erik Rugar by Mischa Burnett is a different take on the occult detective idea.\n\nBass Reeves, Frontier Marshal, Vol. 1, by various authors. This stars Bass Reeves, who was real black marshal in the Old West.\n\nBlack Pulp by various authors\n\nBlackthorn: Thunder on Mars by various authors\n\nThe Bone Eater King by Steve Van Samson\n\nThe Bone Queen by Andrea Judy is a spin out from the Pulpster series (see below) with this occult menace.\n\nBulldog Drummond: On Poisoned Ground by I.A. Watson. This book gives us a modern re-interpretation of this classic pulp-adjacent character. I am more familiar with the author’s many Sherlock Holmes stories.\n\nCasefiles of the Royal Occultist by Joshua Reynolds. This is one of the first collections of Reynold’s occult detective Charles St. Cyprian, set in post WWI England (and elsewhere).\n\nChanga’s Safari by Milton Davis. This is the first of a series starting a black prince in 15th-century Africa.\n\nThe Choking Rain by Brian K. Lowe, is the first of the Nemesis series.\n\nCreeping Dawn: The Rise of the Black Centipede by Chuck Miller. This is the first adventure with his unique New Pulp hero.\n\nDamballa by Charles Saunders. This is one of several black, pulp-inspired heroes from the late author.\n\nDark Universe by various authors\n\nThe Dead Sheriff by Mark Justice. This is the first of this series by the late author. Others have since written further with the character.\n\nDevil’s Due by Percival Constantine. This is the first of a series starring Luthor Cross, a half-demon occult detective.\n\nDillon and the Voice of Odin by Derrick Ferguson. This is the first Dillon novel, and I enjoyed the whole series.\n\nDire Planet by Joel Jenkins is his Barsoom-inspired planetary-romance series of nine volumes so far. I’ve read many of his works, but this is one I haven’t read.\n\nDoc Ardan: City of Gold and Lepers by Guy d’Armen. Adapted by Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier. This is an adaptation of an obscure French adventure character who was turned into an early Doc Savage pastiche, which has allowed for new stories. We’ve also seen more stories from this author.\n\nThe Doc Vandal Omnibus by Dave Robinson. This book collects the first three novels of this dieselpunk Doc Savage pastiche. It’s another fun series that I’ve enjoyed.\n\nDoctor Omega and the Shadowmen by various authors. This collects new stories using an early French sf character who is eerily similar to the original Doctor Who.\n\nDoctor Orient by Frank Lauria. This brings back an occult-detective series from the 1970s.\n\nThe Dunfield Terror by William Meikle. Here is one of many of the author’s Lovecraftian-inspired works.\n\nEight Against the Darkness by Mark Allen Vann. This is the first of a trilogy with eight different genre characters fighting evil in their own worlds, who will eventually come together. The second is out, and I’m looking forward to the final.\n\nEverfair by Nisi Shawl\n\nThe Evil in Pemberley House by Philip José Farmer and Win Scott Eckert is another Doc Savage pastiche where Eckert finished Farmer’s novel with his take on Doc Savage’s daughter in a gothic novel set in England.\n\nFight Card: Felony Fists by Paul Bishop (writing as Jack Tunney). This is actually part of a multi-author series that harkens back to the fight or boxing pulp stories, a subgenre of sports pulps.\n\nFight Card: The Cutman by Mel Odom (writing as Jack Tunney)\n\nFred Adams Jr., Pulp Writer by Fred Adams Jr. At present, I have only read his Sherlock Holmes stories and not much else. But I did enjoy those.\n\nFrom Here to Timbuktu by Milton Davis\n\nFrom the Shadows by John L. French. This is part of his series of Mystic Investigators that also includes some of his pulp-style characters.\n\nGhosts of Manhattan by George Mann. Here is the first novel with this pulp-inspired steampunk hero.\n\nThe Green Lama Unbound by Adam Garcia. This book provides new stories with this classic pulp hero, approved by the author’s estate.\n\nThe Green Lama: Crimson Circle by Adam Garcia\n\nHawk: Hand of the Machine by Van Allen Plexico\n\nHell’s Empire edited by John Linwood Grant. This is the man behind the Occult Detective Magazine, and this is collection of tales about Hell trying to breach Victorian England.\n\nHelmet Head by Mike Baron. I am more familiar with Baron’s comicbook work, especially Nexus.\n\nHitwolf by Fred Adams Jr. There is a second novel.\n\nHow the West Was Weird by various authors\n\nHugh Monn-Private Detective by Lee Houston Jr. This is the first of this series with a human detective in an alien world.\n\nImaro by Charles Saunders\n\nJezebel Johnston: Birth of a Buccaneer by Nancy Hansen. This book is about a female pirate, by this new author of fantasy and other works.\n\nKaren Memory by Elizabeth Bear. Bear is a fairly successful science-fiction author with two Hugo awards.\n\nLegends of New Pulp Fiction by various authors. This massive collection of New Pulp covers a wide range of genres and authors that shows the breadth of the field.\n\nLie Catchers by Paul Bishop. This is one of the authors several detective works, which he knows as an LAPD veteran.\n\nThe Light of Men by Andrew Salmon\n\nLightning Wears a Red Cape by Errick Nunnally\n\nLobster Johnson: The Satan Factory by Thomas E. Sniegoski.

This is the first of a multi-book series (with a spin off) focusing on, well, hunting down monsters.\n\nThe Myth Hunter: The Lost Continent by Percival Constantine. This is the first of a series with a Lara Croft-like heroine.\n\nMythical: Heart of Stone by C.E. Martin.\n\nThe New Adventures of Foster Fade by various authors. This collects new stories using one of Lester Dent‘s early gadget heroes.\n\nNick Nomad and the Hammer of Lemuria by Myles Campbell. This is a take on the 1930s adventurer tale.\n\nThe Nightmare Strikes by John L. French. This is one of several of his pulp-style heroes I’ve read and reviewed.
