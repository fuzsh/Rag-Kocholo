As an adult returning to his native country after five years in Japan, Ferguson was inspired to write his first book, Why I Hate Canadians, published in 1977. In it he lampoons the programs he participated in and generally takes issue with what he sees as the rather smug nature of Canadian society. \"It's clear, though, that the title is meant to be provocative rather than accurate,\" explained Shannon Kari, reviewing Why I Hate Canadians in an issue of Quill & Quire. \"Ferguson really loves Canadians.\" Canadian Forum critic Heather Robertson conceded the author's points about what she described as Canadian \"banality, smugness, prejudice, pigheadedness, Sentimentality.\"\n\nIn Hokkaido Highway Blues: Hitchhiking Japan Ferguson describes his hitchhiking adventure to northern Japan to see the cherry blossoms as they bloomed along the way. \"He captures all of this with great humor, a touch of sarcasm, and a clear affection for Japan,\" wrote Kathleen A. Shanahan in the Library Journal. In a review in Geographical, Holly Smith commented, \"Ferguson's dry sense of humour portrays an insider's view of Japan. The insights that he provides into the Japanese psyche are highly accurate and irreverent.\" In Beauty Tips from Moose Jaw: Travels in Search of Canada, the author once again describes Canada through his humorous viewpoint as he takes a family road trip from the west to the east coasts of Canada. A Kirkus Reviews contributor described the travel book as an \"easygoing, vernacular companion through the vast regions of the Great North Country.\" Ravi Shenoy, writing in the Library Journal, commented that the book is an \"illuminating account of our northern neighbor.\"\n\nFerguson is also the author of Generica, which has also been published as Happiness. The story is a satire on what would happen if everyone's problems were solved, which is exactly what takes place when someone publishes the ultimate self-help book. \"The book is amusing and savage all at once,\" noted Margaret Mackey in Resource Links.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nCanadian Forum, November, 1997, Heather Robertson, review of Why I Hate Canadians, p. 39.\n\nGeographical, August, 2000, Holly Smith, review of Hokkaido Highway Blues: Hitchhiking Japan, p. 95.\n\nKirkus Reviews, April 1, 2005, review of Beauty Tips from Moose Jaw: Travels in Search of Canada, p. 397.\n\nLibrary Journal, November 15, 1998, Kathleen A.
