        "text": "When Manchester United made the decision to name Sir Alex Ferguson as their new manager back in November 1986, few would have been able to predict the sheer level of success that was to come.\n\nThe Scot, whose playing career never took him south of the Scottish border, had been in management for 12 years when United came calling for his services to replace Ron Atkinson.\n\nThis was Ferguson's first taste of English football and the rest, as they say, was history.\n\nHe was in charge at Old Trafford for just shy of 27 years and those years were made up of success story after success story.\n\nIn all, the 78-year-old led United to 38 major trophies, including 13 Premier League titles.\n\nIt is that sort of record that will see him go down as one of the best football managers that the sport has ever seen.\n\nSpeaking on the Match of the Day: Top 10 podcast, Shearer said: \"What was impressive about him was how he continued to build his team when he knew that team was at its peak and he had to start again. He wasn't afraid to get rid of players - as soon as their time was up they were out the door.\n\n\"It's not just one thing. It is the whole package, isn't it? You cannot be around for that amount of time with the turnover of players, and to get the best out of the vast majority of all those players and keep a lid on that and deliver year in, year out is just incredible.â\n\nAlongside Shearer was Wright, who also had plenty of praise for the former United boss.\n\nHe said: \"He was literally unbelievable. He was amazing. He is the best without a shadow of a doubt.\n\n\"He brought players through and then there were the signings that he made to add to those.â\n\nThe former Newcastle United man added: \"He would adapt, there is no doubt about it. That is what you have to do.\n\n\"It is like saying would a great player from 30 or 40 years ago be a great player today? Yes, they would. That is what great managers and great players would be able to do, and, without doubt, Sir Alex would be a great manager today.â\n\nOn Ferguson's success to win the league title in 2013, Wright said: âAlex Ferguson knew he needed different people around him at different stages, to freshen it up and bring in a new idea.\n\nâEven when you look at the 2013 side, people say, 'oh, that's the worst Manchester United team to win the league under Ferguson' - they could not have won that league with that team with any other manager.â\n\nOver the course of his 27 years at the helm at Old Trafford, Ferguson was no stranger to the transfer market, signing Ruud van Nistelrooy, Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo among others.\n\nBut it was the signing of Eric Cantona from Leeds United in 1992 that would prove to be one of his very best additions.\n\n\"I often talk to Steve Bruce about Sir Alex and some of the stories he says are about how he treated Eric Cantona differently to other players,â added Shearer.\n\nâEveryone would have to come in a suit and Eric would, sometimes, just turn up in jeans and all the other players would look at him and think, 'how on earth is this allowed?'\n\n\"One [player] would go and see the manager and he would say, 'Don't you worry about him, I'll manage him. He wins us games and he delivers the points for us, so I'll manage him in the way that is the best way.'\n\n\"That is the sign of a great manager, as to how you manage those great players in difficult moments.\""
