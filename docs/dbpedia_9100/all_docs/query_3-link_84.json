        "text": "Event\n\nA magnitude-6.2 earthquake occurred in southern Guatemala at around 01:12 CST Feb. 16. The epicenter was about 1.0 km (0.6 miles) south-southeast of Neuva Concepcion in Escuintla Department. The tremor occurred at a depth of about 83 km (52 miles), and moderate-to-strong shaking was probably felt near the epicenter. Light shaking was likely felt in the rest of southern and central Guatemala, western El Salvador and Honduras, and southern Chiapas State in Mexico. There have been no initial reports of damage or casualties as a result of the earthquake. It could take several hours until authorities can conduct comprehensive damage assessments, especially in remote areas. Aftershocks are possible over the coming days.\n\nOfficials may temporarily shut down transportation infrastructure in the tremor zone to check for damage. Minor disruptions could occur during shutdowns, but service will likely resume quickly if no damage is found. Utility outages are possible, particularly near the earthquake's epicenter.\n\nAdvice\n\nPlan accordingly for aftershocks. Consider vacating multistory buildings if operating in affected areas until authorities confirm their structural integrity. Allow additional time for air and road travel, as aftershocks may prompt brief disruptions. Seek updated information on road conditions before driving in hilly areas in the affected region due to potential landslides."
