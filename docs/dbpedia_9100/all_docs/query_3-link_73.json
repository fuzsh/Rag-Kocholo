Country-specific maps are included to aid in interpreting the information. The information in this chapter was accurate at the time of publication; however, it is subject to change at any time due to changes in disease transmission or, in the case of YF, changing entry requirements for travelers. Updated information reflecting changes since publication can be found in the online version of this book and on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Travelers’ Health website. Recommendations for prevention of other travel-associated illnesses can also be found on the CDC Travelers’ Health website.\n\nYellow Fever Vaccine\n\nEntry Requirements\n\nEntry requirements for proof of YF vaccination under the International Health Regulations (IHR) differ from CDC’s YF vaccination recommendations. Under the IHR, countries are permitted to establish YF vaccine entry requirements to prevent the importation and transmission of YF virus within their boundaries. Certain countries require proof of vaccination from travelers arriving from all countries (Table 5-25); some countries require proof of vaccination only for travelers above a certain age coming from countries with risk for YF virus transmission. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines areas with risk for YF virus transmission as countries or areas where YF virus activity has been reported currently or in the past, and where vectors and animal reservoirs exist.\n\nUnless issued a medical waiver by a yellow fever vaccine provider, travelers must comply with entry requirements for proof of vaccination against YF.\n\nWHO publishes a list of YF vaccine country entry requirements and recommendations for international travelers approximately annually. But because entry requirements are subject to change at any time, health care professionals and travelers should refer to the online version of this book and the CDC Travelers’ Health website for any updates before departure.\n\nCDC Recommendations\n\nCDC’s YF vaccine recommendations are guidance intended to protect travelers from acquiring YF virus infections during international travel. These recommendations are based on a classification system for destination-specific risk for YF virus transmission: endemic, transitional, low potential for exposure, and no risk (Table 2-08). CDC recommends YF vaccination for travel to areas classified as having endemic or transitional risk (Maps 5-10 and 5-11). Because of changes in YF virus circulation, however, recommendations can change; therefore, before departure, travelers and clinicians should check CDC’s destination pages for up-to-date YF vaccine information.\n\nDuration of Protection\n\nIn 2015, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices published a recommendation that 1 dose of YF vaccine provides long-lasting protection and is adequate for most travelers. The recommendation also identifies specific groups of travelers who should receive additional doses, and others for whom additional doses should be considered (see Sec. 5, Part 2, Ch. 26, Yellow Fever). In July 2016, WHO officially amended the IHR to stipulate that a completed International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis is valid for the lifetime of the vaccinee, and YF vaccine booster doses are not necessary. Moreover, countries cannot require proof of revaccination (booster) against YF as a condition of entry, even if the traveler’s last vaccination was >10 years ago.\n\nUltimately, when deciding whether to vaccinate travelers, clinicians should take into account destination-specific risks for YF virus infection, and individual risk factors (e.g., age, immune status) for serious YF vaccine–associated adverse events, in the context of the entry requirements. See Sec. 5, Part 2, Ch. 26, Yellow Fever, for a full discussion of YF disease and vaccination guidance.\n\nAfghanistan\n\nYellow Fever Vaccine\n\nEntry requirements: None\n\nCDC recommendations: Not recommended\n\nMalaria Prevention\n\nTransmission areas\n\nAll areas <2,500 m (≈8,200 ft) elevation (April–December)\n\nDrug resistance2\n\nChloroquine\n\nSpecies\n\nP. vivax (primarily)\n\nP. falciparum (less commonly)\n\nRecommended chemoprophylaxis\n\nAtovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine, tafenoquine3\n\nOther Vaccines to Consider\n\nSee Health Information for Travelers to Afghanistan\n\nAlbania\n\nYellow Fever Vaccine\n\nEntry requirements: Required for travelers ≥1 year old arriving from countries with risk for YF virus transmission 1\n\nCDC recommendations: Not recommended\n\nMalaria Prevention\n\nNo malaria transmission\n\nOther Vaccines to Consider\n\nSee Health Information for Travelers to Albania\n\nAlgeria\n\nYellow Fever Vaccine\n\nEntry requirements: Required for travelers ≥9 months old arriving from countries with risk for YF virus transmission; this includes >12-hour airport transits or layovers in countries with risk for YF virus transmission.1\n\nCDC recommendations: Not recommended\n\nMalaria Prevention\n\nNo malaria transmission\n\nOther Vaccines to Consider\n\nSee Health Information for Travelers to Algeria\n\nAmerican Samoa (US)\n\nYellow Fever Vaccine\n\nEntry requirements: None\n\nCDC recommendations: Not recommended\n\nMalaria Prevention\n\nNo malaria transmission\n\nOther Vaccines to Consider\n\nSee Health Information for Travelers to American Samoa\n\nAndorra\n\nYellow Fever Vaccine\n\nEntry requirements: None\n\nCDC recommendations: Not recommended\n\nMalaria Prevention\n\nNo malaria transmission\n\nOther Vaccines to Consider\n\nSee Health Information for Travelers to Andorra\n\nAngola\n\nYellow Fever Vaccine\n\nEntry requirements: Required for arriving travelers ≥9 months old\n\nCDC recommendations: Recommended for all travelers ≥9 months old\n\nMalaria Prevention\n\nTransmission areas\n\nAll\n\nDrug resistance2\n\nChloroquine\n\nSpecies\n\nP. falciparum (primarily)\n\nP. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax (less commonly)\n\nRecommended chemoprophylaxis\n\nAtovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine, tafenoquine3\n\nOther Vaccines to Consider\n\nSee Health Information for Travelers to Angola\n\nAnguilla (U.K.)\n\nYellow Fever Vaccine\n\nEntry requirements: None\n\nCDC recommendations: Not recommended\n\nMalaria Prevention\n\nNo malaria transmission\n\nOther Vaccines to Consider\n\nSee Health Information for Travelers to Anguilla (U.K.)\n\nAntarctica\n\nYellow Fever Vaccine\n\nEntry requirements: None\n\nCDC recommendations: Not recommended\n\nMalaria Prevention\n\nNo malaria transmission\n\nOther Vaccines to Consider\n\nSee Health Information for Travelers to Antarctica\n\nAntigua and Barbuda\n\nYellow Fever Vaccine\n\nEntry requirements: Required for travelers ≥1 year old arriving from countries with risk for YF virus transmission this includes >12-hour airport transits or layovers in countries with risk for YF virus transmission.1\n\nCDC recommendations: Not recommended\n\nMalaria Prevention\n\nNo malaria transmission\n\nOther Vaccines to Consider\n\nSee Health Information for Travelers to Antigua and Barbuda\n\nArgentina\n\nYellow Fever Vaccine\n\nEntry requirements: None\n\nCDC recommendations: Recommended for travelers ≥9 months old going to Corrientes and Misiones Provinces.
