        "text": "Congressman Henry Cuellar (D-TX28) announced today that he has been named as one of 101 Most Influential Latinos in 2013 by Latino Leaders Magazine. This year, Congressman Cuellar is joined by award-winning journalist Jorge Ramos, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, actress and activist Eva Longoria, former Mayor of San Antonio and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros, and other influential Latinos in receiving the award.\n\n“I grew up on the border in Texas as the oldest of eight children, raised by migrant workers,” said Congressman Cuellar. “We faced many challenges when I was growing up – poverty, lack of resources. But my parents always pushed me to work hard, get an education, and look beyond our everyday lives to a world of opportunity.\n\n“Growing up, I remember that all the streets in my neighborhood were dirt. Everyone who ran for mayor always promised to pave the streets. Those repeated promises taught me that if you really want to change the world around you, you must get involved. After pursuing an education that included a total of five advanced degrees, I was committed to returning home to Texas so that I could work to benefit and help our community.\n\n“For young people growing up today, the country is changing. Hispanics are 17 percent of the population nationwide and in 2060, the Hispanic population is projected to be 31 percent. In the coming years, more and more Hispanics will take on leadership roles in business, media, politics, and the arts.\n\nIt is important for young people to see role models in the media and public life so that they can see the full extent of what is possible. I am joined by many successful leaders in today’s list and I thank Latino Leaders Magazine for assembling an excellent group of role models. I encourage young people to work hard and remain focused on their education – you are not limited by your circumstances in what you can achieve.”\n\nLatino Leaders Magazine recognized Congressman Cuellar as a leader on homeland security and border issues, among others. This honor is awarded annually to Latino leaders who have distinguished themselves in the past year as influential in their thoughts, ideas, and advice."
