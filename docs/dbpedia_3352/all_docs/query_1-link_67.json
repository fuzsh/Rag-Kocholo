        "text": "Congressman Vicente Gonzalez serves in the U.S. House of Representatives as the elected representative of the 15th District of Texas, which encompasses the growing suburban counties of Brooks, Duval, Jim Hogg, Karnes, and Live Oak as well as portions of Guadalupe, Hidalgo, and Wilson counties. Congressman Gonzalez came to Washington to continue fighting for South Texans and ensure that Rio Grande Valley communities have the resources and opportunities needed to succeed.\n\nCongressman Gonzalez earned his GED in 1985 before attending Del Mar College where he received an Associate’s Degree in Banking and Finance in 1990. He worked his way through college at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University and attained a Bachelor’s Degree in Aviation Business Administration in 1992. The congressman later earned a Juris Doctorate Degree from Texas Wesleyan University School of Law (now Texas A&M School of Law) in 1996.\n\nWhile attending law school, Congressman Gonzalez worked as an intern in the office of former Congressman Solomon P. Ortiz. In 1997, Congressman Gonzalez opened his law practice, V. Gonzalez & Associates and is a member of the bar associations in Texas and New York.\n\nCongressman Gonzalez was influenced by his father, a Korean War veteran who served in the Merchant Marines, to help individuals fight for their rights over his 20 year career. As an attorney, Gonzalez recovered millions of dollars for businesses, homeowners and public schools throughout the country. Prior to his election to the U.S. House of Representatives, Gonzalez was a successful plaintiff’s attorney in Texas and New York.\n\nIn Congress, he is fighting to protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. He is dedicated to ensuring that veterans, military members, and their families have the care and compensation they earned through their service. He is committed to improving health care for those who need it most: children with special needs, seniors, and the disabled.\n\nAs a small business owner, Congressman Gonzalez understands the challenges facing American businesses and has secured a position on the Financial Services Committee. In Congress, he is working across party lines and with local, state, and federal government to expand economic opportunity for all Americans.\n\nOn September 6, 2017, Congressman Gonzalez introduced H.R. 3429, the Repatriate Our Patriots Act, to the House Committees on Judiciary, Armed Services, and Veterans’ Affairs. A bill that would work to bring our deported veterans home and expedite their citizenship process, given that these heroes held clean records before military service.\n\nCongressman Gonzalez is a proven champion of immigration reform by co-sponsoring H.R. 3440 the Dream Act of 2017, H.R. 3591 the American Hope Act of 2017, and H.R. 1034 the Agriculture Worker Program Act, that would all work to assure safety to immigrants from threats of deportation and provide higher education opportunities.\n\nA lifetime resident of South Texas, Congressman Gonzalez is married to Lorena Saenz Gonzalez, a former teacher and school administrator in Edinburg and McAllen. They reside in McAllen.\n\nAs the son of two migrant parents, Dr. Henry Cuellar has served his constituents as Laredo’s State Representative, Texas Secretary of State, and now as U.S. Congressman. Dr. Cuellar is a true champion of higher education. He believes one of the most important goals of government is to help more Texans realize their dream of attaining a college degree. Dr. Cuellar holds five advanced degrees, including an Associate of Arts in Political Science from Laredo Community College, a Bachelor of Science from Georgetown University, a Master of Business Administration in International Trade from Texas A&M International University, as well as a Doctorate of Jurisprudence and a Doctorate of Philosophy in Government from the University of Texas at Austin, earning him the title of \"most degreed member of Congress.\"\n\nDr. Cuellar strongly believes in providing more financial aid for students, which is why created the largest college financial aid program in Texas’ history called the TEXAS Grant. Now in Congress, Dr. Cuellar has supported increasing Federal Pell Grants for students and making them available year round. Dr. Cuellar also passed a provision to establish a one-stop center for student financial aid information to make it easier for students, parents and educators to get assistance.\n\nThroughout his career, Dr. Cuellar has repeatedly been honored by both public and private institutions of higher education for his work on behalf of college students, including being given a “Grade A” by the National Education Association for his pro-education voting record. He also received the Hubert H. Humphrey Award for Notable Public Service from the American Political Science Association and the Outstanding Alumni Award from the American Association of Community Colleges.\n\nCongressman Cuellar serves as a member of the influential House Appropriations Committee. Dr. Cuellar’s focus is to make the federal government more efficient, effective, and accountable by focusing on results and always looking for cost-saving measures. He was named as \"Most Bipartisan Democrat\" in the 113th Congress by the Lugar Center and Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy's \"Bipartisan Index.\"\n\nA native of Raleigh, N.C., CDR Reynolds holds a Bachelor of Science Degree in Biology from Appalachian State University in North Carolina and a Master’s Degree in National Security and Strategic Studies from the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, R.I.
