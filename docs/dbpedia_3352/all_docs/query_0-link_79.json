        "text": "Martin Cuellar Sr. was born on May 22, 1926 in Guerrero Viejo, Tamaulipas\n\nMexico. Odilia Perez Cuellar was born on June 2, 1928 in Zapata Texas. They were\n\nmarried on February 22, 1953. Like all immigrants in pursuit of the American\n\ndream, Martin moved to Laredo in hopes of a better life. They soon started their\n\nfamily. They had eight children: Enrique Roberto (Henry), Carlos, Martin Jr.,\n\nMarcos Antonio, Jorge, Odilia, Rosa Maria (Rosie) and Manuel. The Cuellar family moved to Campwood, Texas in 1967 where Martin Sr. worked as a ranch foreman for nine years. The family worked the land and appreciated being able to raise the children in this wholesome environment. They moved back to Laredo in 1976 where Martin Sr. worked as a gardener and Odilia was a dedicated homemaker who took care of the children. Meanwhile, the children attended local public schools where they studied hard because their parents instilled the importance of good education and spent the summers helping their father and mother. In 1993, Martin Sr. proudly became a U.S. citizen. Martin and Odilia worked hard to make a better life and sacrificed to make ends meet. Through their example, they instilled their values. They taught their children to be honest, work hard, and to treat others with respect and dignity. Equally as important, they also taught their children to always help others even though they had very little. The culmination of their beliefs and values can be seen in all their children , but particularly through three of their children who humbly serve our community: Congressman Henry Cuellar, Sheriff Martin Cuellar and Former Municipal Court Judge/Webb County Tax Assessor-Collector Rosie Cuellar- A first in Laredoâ€™s history! Martin and Odilia Cuellar are truly role models for all parents regardless of economic status and educational level achieved. Odilia P. Cuellar passed away on December 15, 2015 and Martin Cuellar Sr passed on May 13 2019. They are dearly missed by many, and know they are watching over their children, grandchildren\n\nand and great-grandchildren and great-great grandchildren."
