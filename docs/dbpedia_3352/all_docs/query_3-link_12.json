Kennedy mold.” The Dallas Morning News says he's \"one of the seven best Texas legislators.\" The San Antonio Express-News says, “Cuellar has worked hard and demonstrated an independent nonpartisan mind-set,” and also notes that “Cuellar's willingness to place his district ahead of his political party is refreshing.”\n\nBorn as one of eight children to hard working migrant farm workers in Laredo, Texas, Congressman Henry Cuellar has dedicated his life and career to two decades of public service.

In 2009, he worked with his Blue Dog colleagues to help pass into law the landmark Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) legislation to reign-in federal spending and restore the budget surpluses of the 1990's. As an advocate for the private sector and a believer in the entrepreneurial spirit of America, he strongly believes in tax cuts for the nation’s small businesses and tax cuts for hard-working families.\n\nAs the Chairman and founder of the bi-partisan Congressional Pro-Trade Caucus, Congressman Cuellar is widely regarded as a national trade expert in Washington D.C.
