        "text": "Nearly the entire civilian population of the Krasnoyaruzh district of Russia's Belgorod region has been evacuated, the region's governor reported, as Ukrainian forces continued to make headway in the neighboring Kursk region.\n\n\"More than 11,000 people have left,\" Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on Telegram early on August 13. \"At present, about 1,000 people are in temporary housing.\"\n\nThe district's prewar population was about 14,000 people.\n\nThe governor announced the evacuation of the district on August 12 and closed off access to the area. The district head, Andrei Miskov, said the 500 people remaining in the area were mostly officials, emergency workers, and key specialists.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nThe Krasnoyaruzh district borders Ukraine to the west and the Kursk region's embattled Belov district to north.\n\nUkrainian forces posted a video on August 12 that has been geolocated to the center of the Kursk region town of Sudzha. The exact date of the video is unclear, but Ukrainian soldiers can be heard saying that they had not yet encountered any Russian forces.\n\nRussian military vloggers have reported that Sudzha, about 10 kilometers from the border with a prewar population of more than 5,000 people, was under Ukrainian control.\n\nUkrainian forces launched a surprise incursion into the Kursk region on August 6 and have occupied about 1,000 square kilometers and numerous population centers.\n\nIn a statement on August 12, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Moscow had used the border region to launch some 2,100 attacks on Ukraine's Sumy region since July 1.\n\nKursk region Governor Aleksei Smirnov reported to President Vladimir Putin on August 12 that 28 settlements were \"under enemy control.\"\n\n\"The depth of the penetration into the territory of the Kursk region is 12 kilometers, the width of the front is 40 kilometers,\" he said.\n\nIt is not possible to verify battlefield claims, although some reports have suggested deeper incursions by Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe United States on August 12 said it agrees with intelligence assessments that Iran and/or its proxies in the Middle East could “attack Israel as early as this week” and it urged Tehran to “stand down” with regard its ongoing threats.\n\nU.S. national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that President Joe Biden had spoken to leaders of key Western allies to discuss the situation and said Washington takes seriously reports that Iran could soon attack Israel in retaliation for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, in Tehran on July 31.\n\nIran blames Israel for the killing of Haniyeh and has vowed revenge, raising fears of a wider war in the region.\n\n“We have to be prepared for what could be a significant set of attacks, which is why, again, we have increased our force posture capabilities in the region even in just the last few days,” Kirby said.\n\n“We've got significant force capabilities in the region. We've changed some of that posture in just the last few days. The president is confident that we have the capability available to us to help defend Israel,” Kirby added.\n\nThe Pentagon has bolstered its forces in the Middle East amid the mounting tensions as Washington reiterated its support for long-standing ally Israel.\n\nIn a joint statement later with Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, the White House said: “We expressed our support for the defense of Israel against Iranian aggression and against attacks by Iran-backed terrorist groups.\"\n\n“We called on Iran to stand down its ongoing threats of a military attack against Israel and discussed the serious consequences for regional security should such an attack take place,” the statement added.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian in separate phone calls to avoid escalation of military tensions in the region, their offices said. Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Tehran.\n\nFollowing the call with Scholz, the Iranian president was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying that, \"while Iran welcomes the expansion of interactions with all countries and stresses the need for resolving problems through negotiations, it will not give in to pressure, sanctions, bullying, and aggression.\"\n\n\"Rather,\" he added, \"it considers it a right to respond to aggressors based on international rules.\"\n\nThe Western allies' joint statement also said they “expressed our full support for ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions and reach a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza.\"\n\nIt said the group endorsed the joint call by Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and Amir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani of Qatar “to renew talks later this week with an aim to concluding the deal as soon as possible, and stressed there is no further time to lose.”\n\n“All parties must live up to their responsibilities. In addition, unfettered delivery and distribution of aid is needed,” it said.\n\nIsrael's air and ground offensive has killed more than 38,900 people in the Gaza Strip, according to health officials from Hamas.\n\nIsrael launched its action after Hamas extremists surged across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage.\n\nWashington has warned Tehran of “swift and severe” consequences if reports that it is planning to send hundreds of ballistic missiles to Russia are confirmed.\n\nWe are prepared to deliver a swift and severe response if Iran were to move forward with the transfer of ballistic missiles, which would, in our view, represent a dramatic escalation in Iran's support for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,\" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters on August 12.\n\nThe warning matches one issued by the United States earlier this year after Reuters -- citing six unidentified sources -- reported that Iran had shipped a “large number” of powerful surface-to-surface ballistic weapons to Russia.\n\nThe United States and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Iran's ballistic missile program over concerns Tehran could send such weapons to its Middle East allies and proxies and to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nRussia has suffered from weapons shortages as its full-scale invasion of Ukraine – launched in February 2022 – has dragged on with heavy losses of troops and military hardware, leaving it to look to allies such as Iran and North Korea to replenish its arms stock.\n\nOn February 22, the U.S. administration also warned Iran of a \"swift and severe\" response from the international community if Tehran provided ballistic missiles to Russia,\n\nNational-security spokesman John Kirby said at the time that Washington had yet to confirm the missiles had been transferred by Iran to Russia, but he said the move appeared likely.\n\n\"In this press reporting, the Iranians are clearly indicating that they will ship ballistic missiles to Russia, and we have no reason to believe they will not follow through,\" Kirby said.\n\nTehran has been providing Russia with unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, guided aerial bombs, and artillery ammunition, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials following widespread evidence of Iran-made Shahed drones causing damage and casualties in Ukraine, leading to additional Western sanctions.\n\n\"Iranian officials also continue to deny providing any UAVs [unmanned arial systems] to Russia when evidence is plain for the world to see that Russia has used these UAVs in relentless attacks against the civilian population in Ukraine, against civilian infrastructure,\" Patel told reporters.\n\nNewly elected Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian, considered by many to be a reformist leader, has spoken of hopes of improving relations with the West, but Patel expressed skepticism.\n\n\"This duplicity is only the latest reminder to the international community that the Iranian regime lacks in credibility,\" he said.\n\nIn January, the State Department issued a similar warning against North Korea in a joint statement with the European Union and dozens of others countries, including many in Asia.\n\n“The transfer of these weapons increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, supports Russia’s war of aggression, and undermines the global non-proliferation regime,” it said on January 9.\n\nWith reporting by AFP and Reuters\n\nThe Taliban has created \"the world's most serious women's rights crisis\" since returning to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, Human Rights Watch (HRW) says.\n\nUnder the Taliban rule, Afghanistan has become the only country where girls are banned from going to school beyond the sixth grade, HRW said in a press release on August 11.\n\nThe Taliban has also \"undermined women's right to freedom of movement, banned them from many forms of employment, dismantled protections for women and girls experiencing gender-based violence, created barriers to them accessing health care, and barred them from playing sports, and even visiting parks.\"\n\nThe pressures on Afghan women come as their country is also experiencing a major humanitarian crisis, with aid severely underfunded and thousands of Afghan refugees forced back into Afghanistan from Pakistan.\n\nWomen and girls are among the most seriously affected by this humanitarian crisis, HRW said.\n\nThe situation has been described by the United Nations special rapporteur on Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, as \"an institutionalized system of discrimination, segregation, disrespect for human dignity, and exclusion of women and girls,\" HRW said.\n\n\"Under the Taliban's abusive rule, Afghan women and girls are living their worst nightmares,\" HRW's Fereshta Abbasi said.\n\nAbbasi urged all governments to \"support efforts to hold the Taliban leadership and all those responsible for serious crimes in Afghanistan to account.\"\n\nAbbasi said countries engaging with the Taliban-led government in Kabul should consistently remind it that its \"abuses against women and girls and all Afghans violate Afghanistan's obligations under international law.\"\n\nMore than half of Afghanistan's population -- 23 million people -- face food insecurity, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nRestrictions that the Taliban authorities have imposed on women and girls have impeded access to health care, jeopardizing their right to health, HRW noted.\n\nThe Taliban's bans on girls' education inevitably leads to future shortages of female health workers, HRW said.\n\nThe rights group called on donor countries to find ways to mitigate the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan without reinforcing the Taliban's repressive policies against women and girls.\n\nUkrainian leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and military commander Oleksandr Syrskiy, have spoken openly for the first time about their forces' shock incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, with Zelenskiy saying that Moscow must be “forced to make peace.”\n\n\"Russia brought war to others -- now it's coming home. Ukraine has always wanted only peace, and we will certainly ensure peace,\" he said in his nightly video address late on August 12.\n\n\"Russia must be forced to make peace if [Russian President Vladimir] Putin wants to fight so badly,\" the Ukrainian leader said.\n\nZelenskiy has pressed his peace plan, which includes the withdrawal of Russian forces from occupied Ukrainian territory, while Putin has maintained his position -- vehemently rejected by Kyiv -- that Ukraine hand over all of four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine that Russia has partially occupied and claimed in their entirety.\n\nZelenskiy said the cross-border operation into Russia was \"purely a security matter\" for his country as he claimed that Ukrainian forces had captured areas near the border that Moscow had used to launch some 2,100 attacks against Ukraine's Sumy region since June 1.\n\nOn August 12, while making his first public comments on the cross-border operation, Syrskiy said his forces had taken control of some 1,000 square kilometers of territory in the Kursk region.\n\nPutin, meanwhile, has sought to reassure panicked citizens in the border area over Ukraine’s shock incursion into the Kursk region, even as evacuations mounted and local officials admitted the loss of dozens of settlements and that the situation remained \"tense.\"\n\n\"Twenty-eight settlements [with about 2,000 people] are under enemy control,\" Kursk regional Governor Aleksei Smirnov told Putin. \"The depth of penetration into the territory of the Kursk region is 12 kilometers, the width along the front is 40 kilometers.\"\n\nPutin cut Smirnov off, telling him that military departments would report on the width and depth of the penetration of Ukrainian forces and suggested that Smirnov dwell instead on socioeconomic issues and the assistance provided to residents.\n\nIt was not possible to verify battlefield claims, and many reports have suggested deeper incursions by Ukrainian forces.\n\nIn comments on August 12, Zelenskiy said he had ordered that a \"humanitarian plan\" be established for the areas taken by Ukrainian forces inside Russia.\n\nPutin accused Kyiv of seeking to “destabilize\" the situation in Russia's border regions and he ordered his forces to \"dislodge\" Ukrainian troops.\n\n\"The enemy will, for sure, receive an adequate response, and all the goals we outlined, no doubt, will be reached,” Putin stressed.\n\nHe added that Ukraine’s offensive was not affecting Russian troops' ongoing military efforts to capture more districts in Ukraine' eastern region of Donbas.\n\nHe said Moscow would provide \"unanimous support for all those in distress\" while claiming that there was an increase in men seeking to enlist to fight.\n\nPutin had previously announced that Russia had imposed what it called anti-terror measures in Kursk, and two nearby regions as well as Bryansk and Belgorod.\n\nAn August 10 announcement by the National Anti-Terrorism Committee said the decision had been made by Aleksandr Bortnikov -- the head of the FSB intelligence service -- in response to Ukraine's \"unprecedented attempt to destabilize the situation in a series of regions.\"\n\nThe evacuation of civilians from the Kursk region was widened on August 12 to include the Belovsky district, which has a population of some 14,000 people, the district chief, Nikolai Volobuyev, said on Telegram.\n\n\"The situation is very tense. Anyone who can should independently come to the collection point in the village of Dolgie Budy or in the settlement of Bushmeno in the Oboyansky district. Buses will be provided. Anyone who is still in the area is kindly requested to leave the area,\" Volobuyev wrote.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nIn a post on Telegram on August 11, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have contained the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk.\n\nOn August 12, the governor of the western Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said on Telegram that the authorities were relocating residents of the Krasnoyaruzh district to \"safer places\" due to \"activity\" in the area by Ukrainian forces.\n\nUkrainian forces entered the Kursk region on August 6, the largest cross-border operation by Kyiv since Moscow launched its full-scale offensive more than two years ago.\n\nUkraine's military claims it has captured a number of settlements in the Kursk region, as clips emerged purportedly showing troops seizing administrative buildings in Sverdlikovo and Poroz, while intense fighting has been reported in Sudzha, a town of about 5,000 people.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, Moscow-installed officials announced on August 12 that a fire at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has been \"completely extinguished.\"\n\nIt was not clear what caused the fire, which started at a cooling tower at the plant at around 8 p.m. on August 11.\n\nZelenskiy accused Russia of lighting the fire and Ukraine's Enerhoatom said Russia's \"negligence\" or arson could have sparked it.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has a presence at the vast six-reactor facility, said there had been no reported impact on nuclear safety at the site.\n\nIAEA chief Rafael Grossi said that \"reckless attacks\" that \"endanger nuclear safety at the plant and increase the risk of a nuclear accident\" must stop immediately.\n\nGrossi said the IAEA requested \"immediate access\" to the cooling tower to assess the damage.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters and AFP\n\nBulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grozev has urged Western news organizations to withdraw any correspondents working in Russia, saying the value of having reporters there is outweighed by the risk of having them seized and used by the Kremlin as assets in future prisoner swaps.\n\n\"This is a period of time when information from Russia cannot be reported honestly,\" Grozev* told Bulgarian public broadcaster BNT in an interview released on August 10.\n\n\"Therefore, the added value of having your representative there is very small compared to the risk of our [journalistic] colleagues being arrested and simply becoming an asset in a [prisoner] swap fund for the future.\"\n\nThe remarks come after a major exchange of detained and imprisoned persons was conducted on August 1 between the United States, Germany, and other Western states on one side and Russia and Belarus on the other.\n\nBNT, CNN, and others have reported that Grozev took part in preliminary negotiations on the prisoner exchange, actions he has indirectly confirmed in a series of interviews.\n\nRussia got back eight prisoners held in the West, including a member of its Federal Security Service convicted of murder in Germany, and 16 people were released from Russian and Belarusian jails. They included journalists Evan Gershkovich of The Wall Street Journal and Alsu Kurmasheva of RFE/RL, both U.S. citizens.\n\nThe 32-year-old Gershkovich was detained in Russia in March 2023 while on a reporting trip in Yekaterinburg. He was sentenced in July to 16 years in prison on spying charges that were rejected by the United States and his WSJ employer.\n\nKurmasheva, a 47-year-old mother of two, was arrested in Kazan in October 2023 and first charged with failing to register as a \"foreign agent\" under a punitive Russian law that targets journalists, civil society activists, and others. She was subsequently charged with spreading falsehoods about the Russian military -- charges she and RFE/RL denied -- and sentenced to 6 1/2 years.\n\n\"The arrest of foreigners in Russia is planned,\" Grozev said.\n\n\"It is planned with the aim to fill a [prisoner] swap fund. Our colleagues from The Wall Street Journal published an extensive investigation practically proving the arrest of Evan had been set up as a planned operation -- not the result of some alleged counterintelligence about him collecting secret information.\"\n\n“They were planning to arrest someone with his status because they knew\" it would become a major issue in the United States.\n\nGrozev said the list of people considered for the prisoner swap changed over the years of negotiations.\n\n“The original list was put together in early 2022. Of course, among the Russian opposition figures who needed to be released, the central figure was Aleksei Navalny.\"\n\n“On the other side, the central figure was Putin's personal assassin, Vadim Krasikov. Four more people were added on both sides. The original list was five-on-five [prisoners to be exchanged],\" he said.\n\nOver the course of 2023, \"both sides expanded [the list] to eight-on-eight. A large part of those eight by the Russian side were the same people who were eventually released -- of course, with the exception of Aleksei Navalny,\" who died in a remote Russian prison before the swap was finalized.\n\nGrozev said Berlin held the most important \"bargaining chip\" for the Kremlin -- Krasikov, who had been sentenced to life in prison for murder.\n\nThe Germans were so angry about Navalny's death that they \"bet it all on one card in the negotiations with Russia,\" Grozev explained.\n\n\"The Germans said: We are giving up the idea [of a prisoner swap] of one-on-one -- a symmetric swap. From now on, for our release of Vadim Krasikov, we want you to release practically all the big names held in Russian prisons -- the Russian opposition figures who have spoken up against the war [in Ukraine].\"\n\n\"That is how the list changed -- six or seven names from the Russian opposition were added. I didn't take part in this last stage [of negotiations], but I know how it developed. The German government was really angry and was ready to drop any deal with Russia. But in the end, they managed to free more people than was actually considered possible at the beginning.\"\n\n*CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misidentified Christo Grozev's professional affiliation."
