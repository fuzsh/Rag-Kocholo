He is a member of the Democratic Party. His district extends from the Rio Grande to San Antonio's suburbs.\n\nQuick Facts Preceded by, 102nd Secretary of State of Texas ...\n\nClose\n\nCuellar served in the Texas House of Representatives for 14 years, from 1987 to 2001, and briefly served as the Texas Secretary of State in 2001, making him, as of 2024, the most recent Democrat to have held a statewide office in Texas.\n\nCuellar was first elected to Congress in 2004, after defeating incumbent Ciro Rodriguez in a primary challenge. He is considered a leading centrist within the House Democratic Caucus.[3][4] He has since been comfortably reelected in every general election while surviving a number of competitive primary races, most notably in 2020 and 2022.[5]"
