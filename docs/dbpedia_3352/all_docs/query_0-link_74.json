        "text": "Happy Monday! I’m so sick of the Democrats I could scream! Today my ire is due to Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas. In May, incumbent Cuellar went up against progressive favorite Jessica Cisneros in Texas’s 28th congressional district Democratic primary. Cisneros held out for a recount after the election itself – which came down to barely 300 votes – and conceded in late June, naming “the Democratic Party establishment” as one of several agents that contributed to her loss. “With this close of a margin, it’s clear that without their aggressive interference in the lives of South Texas families, we would have won,” Cisneros said in a statement to the media at the time.\n\nCuellar, who would be serving his tenth term in office if he wins the general, is capital-D, capital-E “Democratic Establishment.” Power broker Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Joe Manchin donated thousands to Cuellar’s campaign through their political action committees (PACs) in advance of the 2022 primary. One key issue separating Cisneros and Cuellar during the race were their abortion stances – Cuellar is the only anti-choice Democrat serving in Congress – and some hoped that moderate Democrats might change their tune in the wake of the leak of Roe v. Wade’s eventual overturning. But Pelosi waved off critics, saying that Cuellar is a “valued member of [their] caucus.” This is despite several other concerns about Cuellar, such as an FBI raid on his house in January (Cuellar denied being the focus of an FBI investigation through his lawyer a few months later).\n\nIt’s August, Roe was overturned the same month Cisneros conceded to Cuellar, and we’re quickly approaching the November midterms. The Democrats simply will not stop “Just Vote!”-ing us to death. And their own scheming is blowing up in their face. Last week, Cuellar was called out for co-sponsoring a bill earlier in July which many see as a weakening of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, alongside two Republicans. The so-called “Worker Flexibility and Choice Act” amends the act, and establishes “worker flexibility agreements” which serve to exempt gig workers from the federal minimum wage, preempting state- or city-level laws that enshrine a minimum wage.\n\nThis could have disastrous consequences for American workers. As explained by Jacobin columnist Liza Featherstone, “The bill creates whole new ways for employers to get out of paying minimum wage and overtime, extending the gig economy’s stress and chaos to millions more workers.” (Teen Vogue has reached out to Cuellar for comment; we will add his response if we hear back.)\n\nEarlier today, a labor coalition representing 24 million workers, including Rideshare Drivers United (which represents Uber and Lyft drivers currently classified as contractors), harshly condemned Cuellar for proposing the bill. In a statement, the Worker Power Coalition called the WFCA “an anti-worker proposal intended to further endanger already vulnerable gig economy workers” and “an attempt by Rep. Henry Cuellar (D TX-28) and multibillion dollar corporations to bring Silicon Valley’s union-busting playbook to the federal stage.”\n\nDemocrats like to brag about being the union party – it’s one of the only issues President Joe Biden has been consistent on since taking the White House, for example – but progressives made light work of showing Cuellar’s history of undermining worker’s rights. Cuellar previously voted against the PRO Act, which would support workers seeking to unionize, twice. Cuellar isn’t afraid of stepping out of party line; on Friday, he was one of two Democrats who voted against an assault weapons ban. Why did prominent members of the party fund a candidate working against their own stated policy interests?\n\nThe Democratic establishment seems hell-bent on keeping progressives from gaining even a modicum of leverage within the party. Axios recently ran an analysis of Democratic primaries showing that of 22 Democratic primaries with progressive challengers, the moderate won 14 times. Their headline: “Left loses momentum.” But is that really it? Or are we seeing the logical conclusion of where the establishment puts their money and resources? Just look at this state senate race in Rhode Island, where progressive Jennifer Rourke, a Black mother of four, is facing a challenger she says is backed by state Democrats, who as recently as 2009 posted photos in blackface. (The candidate, Michael Carreiro, apologized after the photos surfaced.)\n\n“The fact that the Democratic Party leadership would rather work with the guy who wore blackface against me, a Black and brown, progressive, working-class candidate running for office, was very disappointing,” Rourke told More Perfect Union’s Aida Chavez last week. But, Rourke continued, it also showed “they’d rather dig their heels in and protect their own power” than support her campaign “and improve the lives of working people everywhere.” Wonder how many times we’ll have to hear this story before we see some different outcomes."
