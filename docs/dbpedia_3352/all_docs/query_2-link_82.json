Henry Cuellar’s re-election in TX-28:\n\n“As one of eight children born to migrant farm workers in Laredo, Henry Cuellar was raised with a passion for education and an unwavering work ethic. He brings that work ethic with him every day in Congress to fight for South Texas families, and that’s why voters elected him to another term of representing them in Washington. The DCCC is proud to extend our congratulations to Rep. Henry Cuellar on his victory.”\n\nThe DCCC invested more than $4.3 million to keep this seat blue and send Rep. Henry Cuellar back to Congress, including investments in an organizing program, radio ads, and TV ads in English and Spanish."
