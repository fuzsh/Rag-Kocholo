        "text": "On Friday, longtime Democratic Texas Congressman Henry Cuellar was indicted by the Department of Justice on charges of conspiracy and bribery in connection with an investigation between U.S. businesses and Azerbaijan.\n\nPolitical experts say the continuous federal investigations into elected officials like this one and others are decaying the trust the public has in our government.\n\nBut, Cuellar's colleague Collin Allred says it should do the opposite.\n\nCongressman Allredsays when politicians get indicted or brought up on charges, it should show the American people that no one is immune.\n\nWhile experts say the Department of Justice has eroded public trust, Allred contests that these indictments show that the governmental process is working.\n\n\"In a healthy democracy, when elected officials, who have power, break the law it shows that no one is above the law when we can bring them to account. They will have trials in front of juries of their peers and we will see what the results are in all of those cases.\"\n\nCongressman Cuellar is accused of taking nearly$600,000 in bribes from foreign entities.\n\nMeanwhile, New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez is facing bribery charges and will stand trial this week.\n\nFormer president Trump is currently on trial after facing four separate indictments."
