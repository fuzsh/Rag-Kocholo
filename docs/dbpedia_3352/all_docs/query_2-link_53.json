        "text": "Congressional Intern, Presented By: Shell\n\nHometown: Mission, Texas\n\nSchool: Trinity University\n\nMajors: Political Science, Economics\n\nPlacement: The Office of Rep. Henry Cuellar\n\nDario was born in Edinburg, Texas to a Mexican-American mother and a Mexican father. Shortly after Dario’s birth, his family returned home to the border city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico, where he was raised. After residing in Reynosa for eleven years, the cartel wars and growing insecurity forced Dario’s family to move to Mission, Texas. Having experienced the challenges of feeling out of place, Dario recognizes the significance of establishing a supportive community of like-minded individuals. This understanding has influenced his contributions at Trinity University, particularly in his capacity as a leader in the Inclusive Excellence Advisory. Through this role, he has spearheaded student mentorship initiatives aimed at empowering underrepresented students to excel academically and professionally.\n\nDario, a determined and ambitious student, is currently a rising junior at Trinity University, pursuing a double major in Political Science and Economics, complemented by a minor in Philosophy. With a clear vision for his future, Dario aspires to attend law school upon completing his undergraduate studies. His ultimate career goal is to dedicate his life to public service in the Rio Grande Valley. His focus will be on improving the circumstances faced by undocumented immigrants, while also placing a strong emphasis on the transformative power of education in the area.\n\nAs a CHCI Intern, Dario wants to experience what it is like to dedicate yourself to your community. By actively engaging with ambitious individuals and learning from the wisdom of experienced policymakers, Dario aims to cultivate the essential skills and qualities necessary to fulfill his aspirations."
