        "text": "My name is Jose Sanz, a first-generation American, and I am a republican running for the United States Congress representing the 28th district of Texas. I am former ESPN-Mexico on-air talent who most recently had the opportunity and privilege of serving South Texas families working in the office of my now opponent, Congressman Henry Cuellar (D), as district director and press secretary.\n\nThe experience was unparalleled. However, over time, it became clear that my republican values did not align with those of the office. I had to make a life-altering decision so that I could fight for what matters to me the most— my conservative ideals, freedom, and the ability to represent the family values of the people of Texas-28 in Washington D.C.\n\nMy journey thus far has been filled with challenges and hard work, but, more importantly, it is one that resonates across my district and that vividly exemplifies the American Dream. As a young child, my family and I migrated to the U.S. from Mexico to escape the violence and corruption that still, to the day, plague the country. We came with work visas and became legal residents before completing all the requirements to become lawful U.S. Citizens— a process lasting more than a decade. Therefore, I know first-hand what it means to earn the right to be a contributing member of American society. You do it the right way. You do it the legal way. That is how you become a proud citizen of the United States of America.\n\nI grew up in the suburbs of Houston, Texas. From an early age, my parents instilled in me a profound sense of faith, family, and responsibility. I attended Friendswood High School where I became a successful athlete and student leader. After graduation, I attended at the University of Houston, earning a BS in Business Administration and Finance, and later received a Master’s in Business Administration from Universidad ESERP in Madrid, Spain. I was also on the Dean’s List and a member of PHI THETA KAPPA, the National Honors Society.\n\nWHY I AM RUNNING\n\nI am running for Congress because during my time working in the federal government, I often felt like I was not doing justice to the country that I fell in love with— the country that took me I see a system that no longer encourages dissent or free thinking. It penalizes it. I see leaders that do not facilitate important national conversations. They end them. And I see a democratic party that has become close-minded and reflexively partisan, threatening to destroy democracy as we know it. Like many of us, I strongly believe now is the time to stand up for the values we share. Our southern border is in crisis. Our freedoms are under siege. Our morals and way of living are being threatened. The truth is, if we do not act now, the America we grew up in will be reduced to a distant memory. I know my district well. It is a conservative district. And it is a district that is ready for change. That is why I want to be that strong, conservative voice that South Texas yearns for in our nation’s capital."
