Cuellar was first elected to Congress in 2004 after defeating Ciro Rodriguez. Heâs considered a leading centrist within the House Democratic Caucus.

Cuellar has since been reelected in every general election while surviving a number of competitive primary races, most notably in 2020 and 2022.

In October 2023, Cuellar hit significant headlines after he was reportedly carjacked by three armed robbers on Monday 2, October.

In a statement, Cuellarâs chief of staff, Jacob Hochberg said: âAs Congressman Cuellar was parking his car this evening, 3 armed assailants approached the Congressman and stole his vehicle. Luckily, he was not harmed and is working with local law enforcementâ

Hochberg said police recovered Cuellarâs vehicle. According to reports, the robbery happened in Washingtonâs Navy Yard area, about a mile from the U.S. Capitol.

Mondayâs carjacking happens to be the second assault on a member of Congress in the District of Columbia this year (2023).
