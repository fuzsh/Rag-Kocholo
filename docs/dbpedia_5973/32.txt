Posidonius (c. 135 BCE â€“ c. 51 BCE), also known as Poseidonios, was a Greek Stoic philosopher, politician, astronomer, geographer, historian and teacher native to Apamea, Syria.

During the reign of Ptolemy XIII, Posidonius's knowledge of geography were inscribed on papyruses in Egypt and were used to educate young geographers in the Library of Alexandria.[1]
