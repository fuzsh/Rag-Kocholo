        "text": "(Vol.Â II) Dio Chrysostom\n\nDiscourses\n\nÂ p293Â The Twenty-second Discourse:\n\nConcerning Peace and War\n\nMany things in general and absolutely everything involving any work or activity will be found common to philosophers and orators â all those orators, that is, who do not carry on their business in the market-place and work for hire with their eyes fixed on matters of money only and on private disputes regarding contracts or loans out at interest, but aspire to advise and legislate for the state. That is, IÂ think, what Pericles and Thucydides​1 must have done at Athens, and Themistocles still earlier, and Cleisthenes, and Peisistratus, so long as he still let himself be called 'orator' and 'popular leader'​2 â 2Â for Aristeides, Lycurgus, Solon, Epaminondas, and others of the same sort should be regarded as philosophers in politics, or orators in the noble and real sense of the term. And IÂ use the word 'philosopher' of men who, for example, deliberate and legislate about the training of the Â p295Â young, just as Lycurgus did at Sparta, and about the association of 'lovers,' about the acquisition of money â how much one should make and in what manner âÂ about marriage, about the duties of citizen­ship, about coinage, about civic rights and the loss of them, about the setting up of households, and as to whether one should live in a walled city or, as the god advised the Spartans, in an unwalled one; about training for war and the organization of not merely the heavy-armed troops in general, but also of the formation which Epaminondas is said to have invented, in which he put the 'lovers' along with their beloved in order that they might have a better chance of coming through safely and might be witness to one another's courage or cowardice â and history tells us that this Sacred Band, as it was called, conquered the Spartans in the battle of Leuctra​3 though these were supported by all Greece. 3Â But the main question of all, and one with which many have often had to deal, concerns peace and war; and this now, as it so happens, is my theme.\n\nAll problems of this sort are called by the philosophers questions of propriety: for example, whether one should marry, whether one should go into public life, whether a monarchy should be adopted, or a democracy, or some other form of government; and in these subjects, in my opinion, is included this one too, whether war should be entered into.\n\nIndeed the philosophers not only considered these questions in their general aspect, but also these: when, with reference to whom, and after what occurrence or non-occurrence each separate action Â p297Â should be taken. But there is this important difference â that the orators consider definite cases; for example, whether it is of advantage for the Athenians to make war on the Peloponnesians, for the Corcyraeans to go to the help of Corinthians,​4 for Philip to support the Thebans in the war against the Phocians,​5 or for Alexander to cross over into Asia. 4Â Then too, in all these deliberations the following sort of question is apt to crop up: Is it right to go to war with those who have not provoked a war by some wrongful act? if a wrong has been done by those against whom you propose to wage war, how serious is this wrong which has been done?\n\nBut philosophers look at events from a distance and examine into what their character is in the abstract; for it is much better to have already deliberated about everything a long time in advance and since they have already reached a decision, to be able, when the moment for any action has come, with full knowledge either to handle the situation themselves or to give advice to the others,​6 and not to be caught off their guard, as it were, and so be in a state of confusion and obliged to resort to improvising measures concerning situations of which they have no knowledge. 5Â For whenever the orator-politicians have to consider any question, since they know nothing more than anybody else and have not considered the matter before, in a sense they both deliberate themselves and give advice to the others at one and the same time. The philosophers, on the other hand, know in advance about the course to be adopted and have deliberated Â p299Â upon it long beforehand. Consequently, if they are called in to advise cities, nations, or kings, they are in a better and safer position to set forth, not just what occurs to them, nor one thing at one moment and the opposite at the next, influenced by anger, contentiousness, or bribery, acting just as the tongue of a balance does, as IÂ believe some one of the orator-politicians themselves said, ever tipping according to what is received.​7 And IÂ say this, not to criticize the art of oratory, or the good orators, but the poor ones and those who falsely claim that profession as their own.\n\nThe Loeb Editor's Notes:\n\n1 Not the historian, but the leader of the aristocratic party in opposition to Pericles. He was ostracized inÂ 444Â B.C.\n\nâ¦\n\n2 The term á¿¥Î®ÏÏÏ means primarily 'public speaker,' no matter what the subject of his address, but it was equally applied to those who addressed the people on political questions. Here Dio distinguishes between the greater and more philosophical statesman, such as Solon, and the lesser statesmen and politicians, such as Pericles and Themistocles. á¿¥Î®ÏÏÏ could also mean one who pleaded in the courts, i.e.Â an advocate, and finally, a teacher of rhetoric.\n\nÎ´Î·Î¼Î±Î³ÏÎ³ÏÏ means literally 'leader of the people' and at times has this meaning, as it has here; but more often it was used in a bad sense to mean a political agitator appealing to the cupidity or prejudice of the masses in order to further his own interests.\n\nâ¦\n\n3 InÂ 371Â B.C.\n\nâ¦\n\n4 Corcyra, the modern Corfu, was a colony of Corinth founded about 700Â B.C. InÂ 427Â B.C. during the Peloponnesian War Corinth released some Corcyraean prisoners on the understanding that they were to win over Corcyra from Athens to the support of Corinth. They did secure the support of the oligarchic party there.\n\nâ¦\n\n5 Philip of Macedon helped the Thebans against the Phocians in the Phocian or Sacred War and conquered them inÂ 346Â B.C.\n\nâ¦\n\n6 That is, to the men of action, generals, or to the citizens.\n\nâ¦"
