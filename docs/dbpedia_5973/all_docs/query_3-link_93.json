        "text": "To celebrate scientists and scientific advancements, we have collected a list of the most famous Greek scientists that will inspire us for the greater good.\n\nDid you know that some of the greatest scientists in history were actually Greek?\n\nFrom Aristotle to Archimedes, the Greek people were home to some of the most brilliant minds in human history.\n\nBut what exactly makes them so special? What was it about their culture and education that gave rise to these brilliant minds? And how can we emulate their success today?\n\nLet’s look at some famous Greeks and see what makes them so great!\n\nFamous Greek Scientists\n\n#17. Hipparchus (190 BC-120 BC): The Father of Astronomy\n\nWhat makes Hipparchus famous?\n\nHipparchus was one of the most outstanding scientists in ancient Greece. He is best known for his theories concerning the solar and lunar motions.\n\nHipparchus lived during a time characterized by astronomical, geographical, and mathematical discoveries.\n\nHe is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in ancient astronomy because he developed methods for measuring solar motion accurately and precisely.\n\nHipparchus also devised several methods for calculating distances between stars and planets on Earth’s surface using trigonometry. He could reliably predict eclipses and even discovered the precession of the equinoxes—the slow change in the direction of Earth’s axis over time.\n\nBut one of Hipparchus’ most remarkable achievements was likely his star catalog. This was an extensive list of stars visible to astronomers during that period. Hipparchus’s catalog would later be used by many scientists when creating their own lists of stars visible from around the globe.\n\n[Source: Encyclopedia Britannica]\n\n#16. Galen (AD 129-AD 216): The Greek Scientist Whose Ideas Influenced Science\n\nWhat makes Galen famous?\n\nGalen was a Greek physician in the Roman Empire who is best known for his contributions to pathology, pharmacology, physiology, neurology, and anatomy. He used animals such as pigs and apes to understand the human body.\n\nGalen’s work influenced medicine for centuries after his death. However, many of his beliefs about how the body works were incorrect or incomplete.\n\nThis can be seen in the theory of humor: he believed one’s health depended on keeping four humors in balance—blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile.\n\n[Source: Encyclopedia Britannica]\n\n#15. Aristarchus of Samos (310 BC-230 BC): The Man Who Changed How We View The Universe\n\nWhat makes Aristarchus famous?\n\nAristarchus of Samos is the guy who thought up the idea that our planet revolves around the Sun. This Greek astronomer lived in Samos, an island close to modern-day Turkey.\n\nAristarchus is best known for his heliocentric model of the universe, which states that our planet revolves around the Sun instead of the Earth being at its center.\n\nThis marked a shift from the geocentric model—which had been popular since ancient times. It changed how people viewed their place in the universe forever.\n\nMany people rejected Aristarchus’ theory at first. But his ideas eventually gained traction and became widely accepted by scientists and philosophers.\n\n[Source: Encyclopedia Britannica]\n\nSimilar Articles:\n\n16 Famous Scientists With Learning Disabilities That You Should Know\n\n30 Famous Medical LaBraWithry Scientists That You Should Know\n\n17 Famous Electrical Scientists That You Should Know\n\n#14.

This practice was previously unheard-of.\n\nWhat’s the best Hippocrates quote?\n\n“If someone wishes for good health, one must first ask oneself if he is ready to do away with the reason for his illness. Only then is it possible to help him. “\n\n[Source: Encyclopedia Britannica]\n\n#2. Archimedes (287 BC-212 BC): The Guy Responsible For The Archimedes Principle\n\nWhat makes Archimedes famous?\n\nYou’ve probably heard of Archimedes, the ancient Greek scientist who made a big splash in the world of astronomy, physics, and mathematics. But did you know that he is one of the top scientists in the history of science?\n\nArchimedes is best known for discovering the principle that explains the buoyancy of objects in liquids. This came to be the Archimedes Principle.\n\nHe also invented the compound pulley and the screw pump, which were essential innovations in the history of technology.\n\nWhen Archimedes lived in Syracuse during his childhood, he helped build machines that could be used to defend against Roman invaders. Growing up, he continued working on many inventions related to defense systems for cities all over Greece.\n\nHis contributions were so significant that engineers and mathematicians still use them today.\n\nWhat’s the best Archimedes quote?\n\n“Give me a place to stand and I will move the earth.”\n\n[Source: Encyclopedia Britannica]\n\n#1. Pythagoras of Samos (570 BC-495 BC): The Greek Scientist Who Revolutionized Science\n\nWhat makes Pythagoras of Samos famous?\n\nPythagoras of Samos was a Greek philosopher known for making incredible contributions to science and mathematics.\n\nThis ancient Greek scientist established a school in Italy that consisted of the Pythagoreans.\n\nThis group of ancient Greek philosophers lived by a strict code of silence. They believed their bodies were mere vessels for their souls, which would be reincarnated after death.\n\nPythagoras also thought that numbers could explain everything in the universe. He believed that certain numbers had special powers and qualities.\n\nPythagoras made contributions to science. He developed the Pythagorean theorem. This says the sum of the squares of two sides of a right triangle equals the square of their hypotenuse. Pythagoras also came up with the Pythagorean tuning and theory of proportions.\n\nWe still use many of the concepts attributed to the Pythagoras of Samos. He remains one of the most influential ancient Greek scientists.\n\nWhat’s the best Pythagoras quote?\n\n“The soul of man is divided into three parts, intelligence, reason, and passion. Intelligence and passion are possessed by other animals, but reason by man alone.”\n\n[Source: Encyclopedia Britannica]\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Greeks were a civilization that was known for its love of learning and knowledge. Their advancements in science, math, and philosophy are still relevant today.\n\nThese Greek scientists were just as curious about the world around them as we are today—no wonder they made such incredible discoveries.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed reading about these great thinkers. Let’s know who you’d want to see on this list."
