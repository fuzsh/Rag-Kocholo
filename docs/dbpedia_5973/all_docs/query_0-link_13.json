        "text": "Activity objectives\n\nLearn about Posidonius a great polymath of antiquity\n\nUse simple geometric methods to estimate the circumference of the Earth\n\nUse Stellarium to replicate the measurement of the circumference of the Earth\n\nBecome aware of the errors and limitations of the method of Posidonius\n\nBackground\n\nPosidonius (135 - 51 BCE) was a Greek polymath born in the city of Apamea, in modern day Syria. He was acclaimed to be the greatest polymath of his time. At some point in his life, he settled in the Greek island of Rhodes, a famous scientific and cultural center. Posidonius spent many years in travel and scientific research in several European lands. Amongst other endeavors, he tried to explain the origin of tides, provided estimations for the distances of the Moon and Sun and, like Eratosthenes, calculated the size of the Earth; it is the latter of his efforts that we shall investigate.\n\nPosidonius: Taken from Sailko / CC BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0)\n\nPosidonius calculated the Earth's circumference by observing the position of the bright star Canopus. He observed that the star could be viewed on, but never above, the horizon at Rhodes, while at Alexandria he saw it emerge clearly above the horizon. By assuming (as he thought) that Rhodes was 5,000 stadia due north of Alexandria (on the same meridian), he was able to estimate the circumference of the Earth as follows: The difference in the altitude of Canopus as viewed from two locations on the same meridian, is equal to the difference in the latitudes of the two locations. Once the difference in latitudes Δφ is obtained, the formula employed by Eratosthenes can be used to find the circumference of the Earth:\n\nL/S = 360/Δφ"
