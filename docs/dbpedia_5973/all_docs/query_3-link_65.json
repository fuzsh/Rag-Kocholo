        "text": "Gaius Musonius Rufus. The Fragments. Introduction, translation, and commentary by Alexander A. Stoliarov. Moscow, Institute of Philosophy Press, 2016. – 144 pages. – Paperback. – ISBN: 978-5-9540-0311-6 (in Russian)\n\nThis edition presents the first Russian translation of the full corpus (on the base of the Hense's edition) of Musonius Rufus, whose fragmentary texts are largely extracted from Stobaeus and also from a number of minor sources. Gaius Musonius Rufus was a Roman Stoic philosopher of the 1st century AD who, despite being a less-known figure, for his importance can be compared with Seneca, Hierocles, Epictetus (who was Musonius’ disciple) and Marcus Aurelius. He first engaged in the study of philosophy in Rome during Nero’s reign and, after being exiled in 65, came back to Rome after Galba’s ascent to power; at some time in the 70s he had to go to exile again, to be back only after the death of Vespasian. Like many other representatives of the Later Stoa, Musonius paid little attention to the theoretical side of the Stoic doctrine, concentrating mostly on practical ethics, namely, the so-called paraenetic, or moralistic discourse, a discipline which eventually exerted great influence of European moral philosophy. Musonius advises on how one should behave in a given situation, parting from the positive assumption that a human being is born with a proclivity for virtuous life and a capacity of goodness. The present book follows Musonius’ life and teaching through the events of Roman history and public life; as a result, one gets a more complete understanding of his character and thinking (and also of the reasons why it became influential), as well as of the common background of Roman, in particular Stoic, philosophy of the 1st century. A paradigmatic Roman intellectual, Musonius contributed to shaping that idea of a dignified way of life which dominated European consciousness ever since; his own example gave proof of his adherence to the principles he believed to be true.No cabinet philosopher, Musonius Rufus was a champion of education, marriage, equality of the sexes, and freedom of the individual. But especially he taught how to live a virtuous life in difficult circumstances. His methods included Socratic discussion, training exercises, and close association with students such as Epictetus and other well-known figures of the time. Above all he was a living example of what he taught. Based on the ancient texts and modern scholarship, this book is the first russian comprehensive treatment of Musonius Rufus, his life, teachings, and methods. It recounts his active life in dramatic times, describes his basic teachings and their application to practical problems of life, and systematically presents all aspects of his approach to philosophy, education and related items.\n\n2023\n\nApathy // Philosophical anthropology. 2023.

(in Russian)\n\nZeno from Citium in Cyprus (ca 333/4‒262/1 BC), of Phoenician origin, founder of the Stoic school. Ca 300 BC he started teaching at Athens at s.c. Painted Stoa (a gallery on the Athenian Agora); after it was named the Stoic school. Zeno experienced the influence of academicians (division of philosophy in three parts), megarians (logic), Aristoteles and possibly Heraclites (physics), cynics and Socrates (ethics). Having this as a basis he developed his special doctrine. Three parts of philosophy are inseparably connected. Logic investigates the principles and the limits of knowledge. Physics located at the middle place formulates the laws of the universe and thereby installs the basis of ethics. Ethics as the crown of the teaching proves the final end of the rational being: life in accordance with nature, that is with the prescriptions of the cosmic logos, corresponds to happiness.\n\nChrysippus of Soli // Philosophical anthropology. 2020. Vol. 6. No. 2. pp. 127-156. (in Russian)\n\nChrysippus of Soli (c. 280/77‒208/5 BC) was a most multilateral stoic philosopher; he earned the title of Second Founder of Stoa. A prolific writer (he has written much more than any other stoic philosopher, but none of his works have survived except as fragments), Chrysippus expanded the fundamental doctrines of Zeno of Citium, the founder of the school. Chrysippus excelled in logic, the theory of knowledge, physics and ethics. He created an original system of propositional logic in order to better understand the causal interrelations of events in the universe. He adhered to a deterministic view of fate, but nevertheless sought a role for personal freedom in thought and action. Ethics, he thought, depended on understanding the nature of the universe, and he taught a therapy of extirpating the passions which depress the soul. He initiated the success of Stoicism as one of the most influential philosophical movements in the Greek and Roman world.\n\n2018\n\nThe “Jewish Question” in the Mirror of Ancient Philosophy // Istoriko-Filosofskii ezhegodnik [History of Philosophy Yearbook]. 2018. Vol. 33. pp 52–88. (In Russian)\n\nThis article provides the vision of the “jewish question” in so far as the latter can be illustrated by the opinions of ancient philosophers and authors with semi-philosophical interests. The article rests upon the collections of texts supplied by T.Reinach and M.Stern, the starting point being one of the first works of S.Luria, the prominent Russian researcher of antiquity. Up to my mind, there existed no consistent and centralized antisemitic policy in antiquity. Far from being homogenous, the attitude of ancient philosophical and semi-philosophical socium towards jews and Judaism compared with that of other ancient intellectuals appears, however, to be marked in its positive aspect by a higher level of reflexion and by intention to find out productive elements in judaism and in monotheistic paradigm. Such attitude is peculiar to many adherents of platonic and pythagoreic tradition, particularly to Numenius; from the historic-philosophical and from historic-cultural points of view it appears to be more perceptive and decidedly tolerant.\n\nGaius Musonius Rufus // Philosophical anthropology. 2018. Vol. 4. No. 1. pp. 140–153. (In Russian)\n\nThe article is dedicated to Gaius Musonius Rufus, a Roman Stoic philosopher of the 1st century. AD, a representative of the Late Stoa, who focused on practical ethics, or moralism, and proceeded from the positive assumption that man is endowed with the capacity for good. A typical Roman intellectual, Musonius contributed to the formation of the image of a dignified life that dominated European moral consciousness over the following centuries, and confirmed his loyalty to his principles by personal example.\n\n2016\n\nAlexander Stoliarov: «I’ll be perfectly honest with you».

No. 4. pp. 80–98. (In Russian)\n\nGaius Musonius Rufus - Roman Stoic philosopher of the 1st century. n. e., little known to the domestic audience, but standing on a par with Seneca, Hierocles, Epictetus (a student of Musonius) and Marcus Aurelius. Having begun his studies in philosophy in Rome during the reign of Nero, in 65 AD. e. he was expelled, returned to Rome after Galba came to power; in the 70s he was expelled again and returned after the death of Vespasian. Like other representatives of the Late Stoa, Musonius focused not on the theoretical aspects of the Stoic doctrine, but on practical ethics - the so-called parenetics, or moralism, which had a great influence on European moral philosophizing. Musonius advises how to behave in specific life situations, and proceeds from the positive assumption that a person is endowed with a disposition to live a virtuous life and a capacity for goodness. The purpose of this article is to consider the life and teachings of Musonius in the context of events in Roman history and social life: this allows us to get a more complete picture of both the personality and ideas of Musonius (as well as the reasons for their influence), and the historical and cultural background of Roman and, in in particular, Stoic philosophizing of the 1st century. AD A typical Roman intellectual, Musonius contributed to the formation of the image of a dignified life that dominated European consciousness at almost all times, and by personal example confirmed his devotion to the principles that he considered true.\n\n2014\n\nPosidonius's teaching on the soul (an episode of psychological quests in times distant from us) // Philosophy and Culture. 2014. No. 6 (78). pp. 814–828.\n\nThe anthropological problems of European philosophy have maintained a certain degree of invariance over thousands of years. A comparison of the anthropological positions of Chrysippus, the largest author of the Early Stoa, and Posidonius, the leading representative of the Middle Stoa (as presented by one of the greatest ancient physicians, Galen) shows that the questions that worried them about the essence of man and his mental structure are quite relevant for our time. But we must make important adjustments to the specifics of thought patterns, problematic agendas and the intellectual climate of those times, and also take into account the incommensurability of the “mass” of philosophical developments that existed then and accumulated today. This will allow us to better understand the continuity between ancient and modern philosophical thought, as well as the connection between anthropological, psychological and ethical problems. It is suggested that both Chrysippus and Posidonius wanted (each within the framework of their understanding) to harmoniously correlate the “integral” (according to their concepts) individual with the universe and endow this individual with such a set of abilities that would allow him to withstand life’s adversities. A significant part of the cited texts, which clearly demonstrate the nuances of anthropological reflection in antiquity, are brought to the attention of the domestic reader for the first time.\n\n2013\n\nPhysics of Posidonius: innovation or Stoic canon? (On the question of whether Posidonius was a “Stoic Platonist”) // Philosophical Journal. 2013. No. 2 (11). pp. 35–53.\n\nFor quite a long time, Posidonius was a mysterious and “fashionable” figure for historians of ancient philosophy. He was considered the forerunner of the “great synthesis”, which prepared the birth of Neoplatonism (through middle Platonism). However, upon closer examination, Posidonius's basic texts relating to physics indicate that he was a completely canonical Stoic and could hardly have played such a key role in the Neoplatonic synthesis as was attributed to him.\n\n2012\n\nScholarly Philosophy of Late Antiquity and the Christian Teaching: Some Reflections Concerning the Interference of Ideas // History of Philosophy Yearbook'2011 / Institute of Philosophy, RAS. Moscow, 2012. pp. 101–170. (in Russian)\n\nThe influence of ancient philosophy on patristic is obvious. But since long there exists an opinion that Christianity also had influence upon some pagan philosophers of late antiquity, especially on Hierocles of Alexandria and on Ammonios, the teacher of Plotinus. However the teaching of Ammonios defies any reconstruction. All attempts to seek direct Christian influence on Hierocles in the sphere of fundamental notions about the structure of being and the arrangement of the world can only lead to erroneous conclusions. If it is possible at all to speak about Christian influence upon pagan philosophy – namely upon later Neoplatonists – its traces are most likely to be found in the areas marginal for the pagan consciousness. As a possible example we can consider neoplatonic triads similar to the evangelic triad «faith–hope–love».\n\n2011\n\nOn Forthcoming Edition of the Fragments of Posidonius // Philosophical Journal. 2011. № 1 (6).
