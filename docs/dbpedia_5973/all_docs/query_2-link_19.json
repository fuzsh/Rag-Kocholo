        "text": "Does the data about Apamea and the Ciete support the view that Rome carried out registrations in client kingdoms? [Part2: Apamea]\n\n[Draft: Oct 9, 2016]\n\n[Part two from tax4kings1.html]\n\nWhen we look at the case of Apamea--and the census described on the funerary monument, we get a great view of the unevenness of Roman rule in those times.\n\nI suspect that Dr. Carrier's statement that Apamea (whichever one was described by that monument) was already under provincial rule and that a census there was perfectly normal and expected is based on his understanding that Syria had been conquered by Pompey and turned into a province at that time (northern Syria--not southern Syria).\n\nSo, since I myself have used Apamea as evidence of a fully-Roman census in a client-kingdom (or client-state), it is time to trace backwards through my sources and references to see if something has been changed (about the interpretation of the data) or if it has been misunderstood.\n\nMost of the citations I can find--in works like mine and similar ones--point back to Hoehner's Chronological Aspects of the Life of Christ, published in 1973. His statement (p16) goes like this:\n\n\"In fact, in Venice a gravestone of a Roman officer was found which state that he was ordered by P. Sulpicius Quirinius to conduct a census of Apamea, a city of 117,000 inhabitants, located on the Orontes in Syria (footnote 25), which was an autonomous city-state that minted its own copper coins (footnote 26).\"\n\nWhat are his sources?\n\n·Footnote 25 gives \"25. Cf. Stauffer, p. 32; Finegan, p.237.\"\n\n·Footnote 26 gives \"26. A. R. Bellinger, The Coins, Final Report VI of The Excavations at Dura-Europos, ed. By M. I. Rostovtzell, et al. (New Haven, 1949), p. 86, nos. 1832, 1833\"\n\nStauffer refers to Jesus and His Story (trans. By Dorothea M. Barton (London, 1960).\n\nStauffer is responding to a criticism of the nativity story raised by Strauss:\n\nStrauss's Point 2. Here Strauss was led astray by Josephus' bombastic description of Herod. To understand correctly the legal position of Herod the Great, we must understand the adroit fiscal devices of Augustan imperial policy. We must also know something about the historical evolution of inter­locking sovereignties throughout Syria, concerning which we glean considerable information from a study of their coinages. I shall deal briefly with only three sample govern­ments: the Nabataean kingdom of the Arab vassal kings in Petra, in the southeast of the Roman Empire; the Syrian city-state of Apamea on the Orontes; and the vassal kingdom of King Herod I.\n\nThe Nabataean kings in Petra had the right to mint their own silver coinage with Semitic inscriptions. They also assumed the right to settle questions of succession to the throne. Both these privileges were signs of a considerable measure of authority. But we find in Josephus several sur­prising items concerning their systems of taxation. Listing the leading men of Petra4 around 9-6 b.c, Josephus men­tions the imperial \"slave\" Fabatus, and speaks of this Fabatus twice as the chief imperial financial officer (dioiketes).5 The man must therefore have been one of those numerous freed-men whom Augustus installed in high positions in the finan­cial administrations of the provinces. From this one item it becomes apparent that Petra's entire system of taxation was under the control of Augustus. This principle was main­tained during the subsequent period of the Empire. Thus we hear of a Roman tax commissioner in the days of Vespasian who held sway in the Nabataean kingdom with the support of a Roman military detachment. Naturally this does not exclude the co-operation of local rulers and authorities in all fiscal activities. The Egyptian taxation papyri offer many analogies to this practice.\n\nThe city-state of Apamea was allowed to mint only cop­per. Nevertheless, we find it styling itself on its coins with the proud word autonomos, stressing with good reason its right to self-government. In New Testament times Apamea was one of the four most powerful city-states of Syria. We need only read Strabo to form some conception of the inde­pendence of this city in fiscal policy and taxation. The siz­able towns of Larissa, Kasiana, Megara, Apollonia, and others were subject to taxation by Apamea. The priest-sover­eigns of Emesa and the Ituraean kings of Chalcis on the Lebanon were allied to Apamea [Strabo 16, 2, 10, 752f]. Yet, for all its power, this proud city could not evade Quirinius' census. We possess some interesting documentary proof of this. In the year 1674 the gravestone of an Augustan army officer turned up in Venice. The inscription on the stone mentioned certain taxation measures taken by Quirinius in Apamea. This in­scription was copied at the time, and published in 1719. Meanwhile the original had disappeared, and for a long time the document was considered to be a forgery until in 1880 the lower half of the gravestone again came to light. Since then the authenticity of the marble slab has been universally recognized.\"\n\nThe crucial words read: \"On command of Quirinius I have carried out the census in Apamea, a city-state of one hundred and seventeen thousand citizens. Likewise I was sent by Quirinius to march against the Ituraeans, and con­quered their citadel on Lebanon mountain.\" 7 It is clear that Quirinius subjected the autonomous city-state of Apamea to the census, just as he did the vassal state of Nabataea. And it seems very probable that the campaign against the Itu­raeans was connected with the work of the census. For we learn from Strabo that the Ituraean kings were allied to Apamea. These Semitic Ituraeans were a semi-nomadic, un­ruly, and marauding mountain folk, the kind of people who always offered the toughest resistance to the Roman census commissioners. Therefore Quirinius' census in Syria must have been accompanied in certain spots by as much bloodshed as the similar work in Gaul. In Apamea itself, and in other imperial cities, the work no doubt progressed more peacefully. But the foregoing quotation from Lactantius concerning the levies under Diocletian indicates how brutal the Romans could be when they met opposition.\" (26-28)\n\nThe footnotes given for the Nabataean coins and Apamea are these [note: \"C.G.C\" refers to \"Catalogue of Greek Coins in the British Museum\"]:\n\n* The Nabataean coins may be found in C.G.C., \"Arabia, etc.\" (1922), p. 3 ff. The report on the tax collector under Vespasian was noted by Mommsen in Romische Geschichte (Berlin, 1885), Vol. 5, p. 479. Mommsen himself comments: \"It was not unprecedented for a vassal state to be brought into the sphere of the imperial taxation. This occurred in, for example, the Alpine regions.\"\n\n* See C.G.C., \"Galatia, etc.\" (1899), p. 233 ff.; B. V. Head, Historia Nummorum (2nd ed., Oxford, 1911), p. 780; A. R. Bellinger, \"The Coins,\" in Excavations at Dura-Europos, Final Report, Vol. 6 (New Haven, 1949), p. 86.\n\nFinegan refers to the Handbook of Biblical Chronology, Jack Finegan (Princeton, 1964). I have the Revised edition dated 1998. In the revised edition, the point about Apamea occurs on page 305 (topic 524). Here Finegan points to the same coinage source:\n\n\" Apamea, where the autonomy of the city-state is shown by the fact that it minted its own coins \"\n\nAnd his footnote is to the same source by A. R. Bellinger.\n\nI will have to come back to the issue about interpretation of coinage, but let's do a level set through scholarship about that Apamea, to see if the general consensus confirms interpretation of Apamea as a 'free city-state'. If it IS a 'free city-state' (to the extent any kingdom or city-state was under Roman 'oversight'), then holding a census in it is a perfect example of what might have occurred in Judea during the kingdom of Herod.\n\nIn historical context, Apamea of Syria was one of the four cities of the \"Syrian Tetrapolis\" (Not to be confused with the Attic cult Tetrapolis): Antioch, Laodicea, Seleucia, Apamea.\n\n\"Apamea was one of the four cities ... of the so-called Syrian Tetrapolis. It had been the former Seleucid military capital and is commonly regarded as being second only to Antioch in size and therefore one of the two or three largest in all of Syria\" [David Kennedy, \"Demography, the Population of Syria and the Census of Q. Aemilius Secudus\", in LEVANT 38, 2006, p113]\n\nWe will have to look at a couple of different periods that impact this:\n\n1.The pre-Roman period of the Seleucids\n\n2.The period right after the conquest by Pompey\n\n3.The period between Pompey and his death (transition to M. Antony)\n\n4.The period between Antony and Augustus\n\n5.The period during/following Augustus\n\nThe main specialist sources we will use for this are (in publication order):\n\n·[HI:COERP] H. M.

Some of the terms were technical (in a legal sense) such as polis, civitas, libera, tetrarchy, and colonia. What we would call a 'city' or a 'town' would not imply legal or political status, but under Roman rule there were legal and political dimensions to the terms.\n\nA town could have 'civic status' (civitas) which was a legal/political term. There were some basic criteria that had to be met for such status (although such status could be 'bought' by shrewd municipal rulers !).\n\n·\"A city was a settlement that was recognized by the government as having civic status. It was an institutional concept, not a physical distinction, and therefore civic status did not necessarily have anything to do with settlement size or monumentality. Cities were both large and small. Some were wealthy, and others were comparatively poor. Some villages were as large, and therefore probably as rich, as some cities, and some villages had monuments of the sort one might expect to find in a city. So villages or towns might resemble cities, even if they did not have the same status. This means that a settlement could be city-like (for example, the late Roman 'town' of Androna in the north Syrian steppe, with its circuit walls, barracks, bath building, numerous churches and other monumental structures, and imported limestone and Proconnesian mar­ble elements) without officially being one (Androna seems to have remained a kome - a 'village'). Villages might have elaborate systems of self-government and magistracies that resembled those of the cities (though admittedly the evidence for this is debated). Some small cities had village-sized territories, and some were nothing more than villages that had been raised to civic status. Smaller cities, although constitutionally independent, might depend economically on larger ones. This means that the resources on which a larger city could draw might include the territories of any smaller and eco­nomically weaker neighbours. Consequently a city might be easy to define in constitutional and legal terms, but more difficult to distinguish in other ways. A certain degree of monumentality, and a particular set of buildings might be expected, and these no doubt helped persuade inhabitants and visitors alike that a place deserved its civic status, but that status did not depend on them. Certain acts, such as the issue of civic coins, were confined to settle­ments that had the status of a polis. The right to celebrate Greek festivals was also restricted to cities. Documentary evidence (inscriptions, civic coins and so on) allows us to determine which settlements were cities, but generally these tell us little about what sort of places they were. As we shall see below, size clearly did matter: it helped determine a city's position within a hierarchy, and that position brought benefits. [HI:RSNE,98-99]\n\n·\"Civitas is the totality of the cives, just as societas is that of the socii. Its meaning is largely synonymous with populous, but it was rarely used by the Romans for their own state but instead was the official expression for all non-Roman communities, tribes and Greek poleis with republican constitutions. A people of the state is the characteristic of a civis, almost always a defined territory with a certain autonomy (suis legibus uti) and mostly an urban center Classification was according to the legal basis of the relationship of the civitas with Rome as civitas foederata (community tied to Rome in a contract, usually in Italy, with foedus aequum or iniquum) or as a civitas sine foedere (community without contract, usually in the provinces), or according to financial obligations that resulted from a contract: stipendiaria (taxed), libera (with its own administration), immunis (tax-free). [Brill New Pauly, s.v. \"Civitas\"]\n\n·\"Civitates (civitas). All cives (citizens) of a larger or smaller territorial, political unit (state, city, colony, municipality) form a civitas. Hence the term is also applied to an autonomous unit itself and the Romans speak of their own state as a civitas (\"nostra\") as well as of other states (civitas Atheniensium) or a group of states (civitates Graecorum). The term is, however, especially used with regard to foreign civitates (civitates peregrinae) in the sense of a large group of free individuals living together and organized as a legal social unit (societas).\n\nCivitates foederatae. Allied cities and communities in Italy and the provinces with which Rome concluded a treaty (foedus). They enjoyed certain privileges and exemption from taxation and lived according to their own laws (suis legibus uti), but they were seldom granted exemption from military service.\n\nCivitates liberae et immunes. Free cities enjoying a high degree of self-government and exemption from taxes. The status of a civitas libera was granted by either a lex data (a charter decreed by the Roman people, the senate, or later, by the emperor) or by a treaty of alliance (foedus) with Rome (civitates liberae et foederatae), by which the autonomous position of the civitates liberae was guaranteed in a stronger way \" [Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law, Adolf Berger.1952]\n\n·\"Even the broad criteria for what constituted a 'Greek city' are not entirely unambiguous: one of the central themes of this book is that the whole area was marked by large agglomerations of population which we do not always know whether to call 'cities' or not. But relevant criteria for defining a 'Greek city' would be, for instance, the exclusive use of Greek in public and communal life; the posses­sion of a constitutional structure of local self-government, with an assembly, a council and annual magistrates; the capacity to mint coins bearing the name of the community; the possession of a territory in which there were villages (komai) which were in some sense dependent on the city; and no similar de­pendence on any other city. That was the point of the short-lived measure by which Septimius Severus is said to have punished Antioch for its support of Pescennius Niger in the civil war of 193/194: he is recorded by Herodian as having declared that Antioch would become a kome in the territory of Laodicea.1 [RNE,256]\n\nThe most explicit symbols of a city's identity and status were its coins. But behind that statement lies a multitude of problems. What is certain is that until the second half of the third century the vast majority of the base-metal coinage in circulation in the Greek East was produced in the name of cities. The coins usually, though not always, showed the portrait and title of the reigning Emperor; and they would typically list on the reverse the name of the community and display some symbol or symbols (often temples or deities) associated with it. With that proviso, the list of communities named (sometimes only for very brief periods) on coins can serve as a map of 'the Greek cities' of northern Syria: Zeugma on the Euphrates, Doliche and Germanicia (all three at some point part of Commagene); Hierapolis, Beroea, Cyrrhus, Chalcis, Antioch, Apamea, Seleucia and Laodicea (which occasionally also produced silver coins); and the three small places on the coast, Gabala, Paltos and Balaneae.\" [RNE,257]\n\n·ROMAN. Civitas means the whole body of cives, or members, of any given state. Civitates are defined by Cicero (Somn. Scip. c. 3) to be concilium coetusque hominum jure sociati. A civitas is, therefore, properly a political community, sovereign and independent. [George Long and Benjamin Jowett, CI′VITAS, ed. William Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1865), 291.]\n\nFrom the above we see that a population center was a civitas if:\n\n·It was actually called a civitas in the historical record, or\n\n·Had a treaty with Rome or a decree from the emperor, or\n\n·Issued civic coins, or\n\n·Celebrated Greek festivals, or\n\n·Had a territory in which there were villages (komai), and\n\n·Was not itself dependent on another city.\n\nOne special form of alliance with Rome (and Rome-via-emperor) was the 'friend and ally\". This was a form of 'foedus' (treaty) and was the basis for the term 'friendly king'. It was used of both kings and minor dynasts (i.e. tetrarchs), and was an important indicator of freedom/autonomy.\n\n·\"Besides these kingdoms and principalities that surrounded the provincia on all sides, there remained within the province itself indigenous principates, entrusted to tetrarchs who were \"friends and allies of the Roman people\" The chiefs of these principates normally had the title tetrarch, a term found not only in Pliny's list, in the Gospels, and in Josephus, but also in a quite official inscription in Apamaea: L. Iulius Agrippa claims to descend from tetrarchs who were \"friends and allies of the Roman people\" on both his mother's and his father's side.137 The term tetrarch is the only title known for these leaders besides that of king. In stressing the fact that tet¬rarchies were viewed as kingdoms, Pliny no doubt sought to emphasize their standing as independent states even though they were friends and allies of Rome. We also know, however, that Rome reserved the royal title for its most loyal and most capable allies: in 4 B.C.E., Augustus refused to give the title to Herod's three sons and successors, remarking that time would tell whether or not they were worthy of it.\" [HI:MEUR,70-72]\n\n·\"The major dynasts, as 'friends' of Rome, may not have had to provide tribute at all, although at least one found it prudent to bribe Pompey to retain his throne. At this early stage Rome had not yet established for certain who were friends and who were enemies [HI:RSNE,22f]\n\n·\"As Rome expanded as an imperial power she encountered monarchies. Ultimately it was at the expense of these monarchies that Rome built her empire: in one way or another all of the provinces of Rome had been, wholly or partly, monarchies before the Roman conquest. But the relationships between Rome and these monarchies were not simply relationships between conqueror and conquered. There was also diplomacy and what the ancients call 'friendship'. Rome was only able to build and keep her empire because she was able to build and keep -- for some time at lease -- 'friendship' with the monarchies of her world .The monarchies under discussion are many and varied. Most significant are the differences between those monarchies of the Hellenistic type, largely situated in the east, which approximate to modern notions of monarchy and kingship, and, on the other hand, the monarchies of tribal societies which are neared to modern notions of chiefships and where, as Tacitus appreciated, the term 'king' needs qualification. How far the Romans distinguished between the two remains a problem, but it seems clear enough that, in formal terms at least, they drew fewer distinctions than we must the full formulation by which Rome described what has become known as 'client king' was rex sociusque et amicus. ..\" (Braun, Rome and the Friendly King: The Character of the Client Kingship, p5, 6, 23).\n\nCivitates were always in search of 'freedom'-- which meant various things to various constituencies. The terms used to describe their relative freedom or type of freedom were varied:\n\n·\"As for titles and privileges cities sought, like cities elsewhere, to be granted freedom, asylia (exemption from reprisals or legal pursuit), auton­omy (the right to live according to its own laws), the title hiera (holy), and the rank of metropolis or even colony, a rank that could be counted as an honor once the provincials themselves began claiming it.According to Pliny the Elder, Antioch, Laodicea, and Seleucia were free cities (tn: libera) ,but the same title appeared on coins of Scythopolis under Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. Cities that continued to mint their own silver coins may have enjoyed the same privilege: Seleucia until 6 c.e. and Antioch until 38; Sidon until 44, Tyre until 58, and Laodicea until 124. However, most Syr­ian cities did not produce coins until later; hence we can deduce nothing from the coins regarding the cities' eventual freedom.\" [HI:MEUR,184]\n\nAs noted above, the most distinctive trait of a civitas was its right to mint civic coins. But this was--under Roman domination--a 'grant of authority' by the Roman state or (mostly) the Emperor. Thus this coinage--being allowed or prohibited--generally implies an autonomous or semi-autonomous civitas (city-state).\n\n·\"As in all the provinces of the eastern Mediterranean,cities retained the right to issue their own coins with the consent of the emperor; these have been called \"imperial Greeks\" since the publication of a seminal article by T. B. Jones, but more recent scholars correctly prefer the title provincial coins, placing them on the same level as coins issued by the provincial koina and other groups. These were generally bronze, rarely silver. Most of the issues were sporadic, sometimes in quite small quantities, and they peaked under the Severi in the sense that a record number of mints is attested dur­ing that period. Only the largest cities on the Syrian coast were able to continue minting silver coins as late as the middle of the first century c.e.: Seleucia until 6 c.e., Antioch until 38, Sidon to 43-44 (but only in small numbers), Tyre until 66 (if in fact the issues attributed to that city up to the first century c.e. actually came from Tyre and not from Jerusalem), and Laodicea until 124. Once silver minting ceased in these workshops, there were only occa­sional issues, notably during the reigns of Caracalla and Macrinus. In northern Syria, these civic issues, which existed only by imperial privilege, began to display portraits of emperors quite latestarting only in 4-3 B.C.e. in Apamaea, in 6 c.e. in Seleucia, and during the reign of Caligula in Laodicea. By contrast, imperial images were featured regularly on the coins issued in the cities of the Decapolis.\" [HI:MEUR,254]\n\nScholars routinely accept the principle that the beginning of coinage is a marker of freedom for a city. The absence of coinage does not argue the contrary (since not all cities wanted the cost/load of minting), but the presence of coinage is used as evidence of freedom. Sample statements include:\n\n·\"The policy of urbanization was carried on by Epiphanes' successors; Cyrrhus, for instance, began to strike coins with the royal effigy under Alexander Balas.\" [HI:COERP, 253]\n\n·\"Most of the coastal cities at this time obtained formal recognition of their freedom. Sidon and Tripolis inaugurated new eras in 111 B.C., Seleucia in 108 B.C., Ascalon in 104 B.C.; Berytus followed some years later in 80 B.C. Gabala seems also to have started a new era about this time; coins of Gabala of the early first century dated in the year 28 survive. These eras certainly represent the formal grant of freedom Other cities began to issue autonomous coins without starting a new era, and therefore probably without having been formally freed, for instance, Orthosia (dating by the Seleucid era) and Epiphaneia (dating by the Aradian era). Larissa revolted from Apameathe war of independence is described in terms of ridicule by Poseidoniusand began to issue her own coinage in 85 B.C. (by the Seleucid era). It [Damascus] obtained under them a very belated municipal independence and struck coins under the name of Demetrias bearing the effigies of these kings.\" [HI:COERP, 255]\n\n·\"He punished it [Arad] by freeing Balaneae, which began to coin once more under him Marathus, on the mainland opposite Arad, and Paltus, north of Balaneae, were also probably freed at this time from Aradian dominion; Marathus began to coin early in the reign of Augustus, Paltus not till much later; both used the Aradian era\" [HI:COERP, 261-2]\n\n·\"For the cities of the Phoenician coast and the tetrapolis Pliny does not use the official sources, save that he mentions the Leucadii, that is Balaneae, by mistake in the list of 'the rest of Syria'. The coins here fill the gap. Of the Phoenician cities Arad and Marathus, Balaneae (under the style of Leucas) and Gabala all coined during the early principate; Paltus did not begin to issue till the reign of Septimius Severus. All four cities of the tetrapolis coined during the early principate. Antioch, Laodicea, and Seleucia were, according to Pliny, free cities. On the upper Orontes, Larissa, Epiphaneia, Arethusa, Emesa, and Laodicea by Libanus and, in the mountains west of Emesa, Mariamme all figured in the official register; Seleucia ad Belum may have done soit is in Pliny's list of Coele Syria. Of these cities only Laodicea and Emesa coined, and even these only from the latter part of the second century. The mention of Emesa incidentally fixes the date of the official register, for it was until 30 B.C. ruled by Iamblichus, son of Samsigeramus, and in 20 B.C. the dynasty was restored and lasted till A.D. 72 at least. Emesa would thus have been registered as a city only during the first ten years of Augustus' reign. [HI:COERP, 263]\n\n·\"Chalcis when it began to coin used an era dating from A.D. 92, which implies that it was freed from a dynastperhaps Aristobulus, son of Herod at that date. [HI:COERP, 264]\n\nFreedom for a city could be 'sought with money' (e.g. bought) by its leadership (from either Rome or the pre-Roman Seleucid rulers), or argued for on the basis of its organization:\n\n·\"There may also have been a complex interplay of personal relations, balances of power, and even financial interests: we can recall that even Pompey himself preferred to recognize the Ituraean brigand chieftain Ptolemy, son of Mennaios, in exchange for one thousand talents, rather than annex his territory. How many local leaders, installed on their own initiative during the time of the last Seleucids, bought their political survival in the same way? We shall probably never know.\" [HI:MEUR,70-72]\n\n·\"Now the author of the second book of Maccabees states that the Jews paid a very large sum for the privilege of having Jerusalem recognized a city. This suggests that Epiphanes may have thought that the sale of charters to towns was a more politic way of raising money than the seizure of temple treasures. The policy also appealed to his rather theatrical philhellenism; the grant of the two cities of Tarsus and Mopsuhestia to his concubine Antiochis suggests that he did not really hold city autonomy very sacred.26\n\n·Be that as it may, his policy was warmly welcomed by his sub-jects. He was only giving official sanction to a movement which had long been in progress. The beginnings of hellenization date from before the Macedonian conquest of Syria. [HI:COERP,248f]\n\n·\"What is clear in two well-known cases is that an imperial decision to grant the status of city to an existing community could be a response to initiative from below. Hence the letter, in Latin, addressed to a governor by an emperor whose name is lost, agreeing that Tymandus in Pisidia has fulfilled the criteria for achieving city status; in this case the availability of sufficient persons (fifty, initially) to act as decuriones (members of a local senate), pass decrees, and elect magistrates.\" [Millar, RGWE]\n\nThe three levels of 'free entities' were the client-kingdom, the tetrarchy, and the city-state. Tetrarchies were dynastic as were the client-kingdoms, but the city-state (civitas) was under some form of constitution of the people. All were 'free' in various ways and levels, although they were still under the authority of Rome (who could depose kings, and turn provinces into client-kingdoms).\n\n·\"Inevitably the spread of Greek culture brought with it the spread of Greek political ideas, and it became the ambition of the native communities to convert themselves into republican city states on the Greek model. The city had long been the regular political unit in many parts of Syria, and the germs of republican institutions had existed before the Macedonian conquest. In these cities the only change required was the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republican constitution, and this change had already taken place in Tyre and Sidon about the middle of the third century, where eras of 'the people of Tyre' and 'the people of Sidon' mark the establishment of democracy. At Bambyce too the priestly dynasty had been deposed by Seleucus Nicator, and the town organized as a city under the style of Hierapolis.\" [HI:COERP, 250f]\n\n·\"Beroea, Hierapolis, Chalcis, Cyrrhus, and Zeugma from the reign of Trajan, Antioch on the Euphrates from that of Marcus Aurelius; Europus issued no coins. Except for Beroea we cannot be certain that any of them had city rank in the early principate; they may have been still, as in the early first century B.C., ruled by dynasts, and have been included among 'the seventeen tetrarchies with barbarian names distributed into kingdoms' which Pliny found in the official register [HI:COERP, 264]\n\n·\"In addition to these names Pliny quotes from the official register many others which, to the best of our knowledge, never were cities. Such are the Gazetae, the Gindareni, the Gabeni, the Hylatae, the Penelenitae, the Tardytenses. He also mentions besides the seventeen unnamed tetrarchies the tetrarchy of the Nazerini, two of the Tigranucometae (to accept the current emendation), and another called Mammisea. These are certainly from the official list; more doubtful are the races of the Ituraeans and their neighbours the Baethaemi, which may be derived from a literary source. It thus appears that northern Syria was by no means entirely occupied by the territories of the cities; a large area was occupied by village and tribal communities and small principalities. Unfortunately very few of these can be located definitely. The two tetrarchies of the Tigranocometae were perhaps the Arab tribes which Tigranes planted on the eastern slopes of mount Amanus. The tetrarchy of the Nazerini is stated by Pliny to have adjoined the territory of Apamea; the Nazerini must therefore be the ancestors of the modern Nusairi who inhabit the mountains behind Laodicea. \" [HI:COERP, 264]\n\n________________________________________________________________ __________________\n\nTwo: Roman policy and perspective toward cities generally\n\nRome was very pro-civitas. They promoted civitas status consistently--largely for practical reasons. When the moved into border countries, they were eager to strengthen/use the city-states to be their buffer against foreign invasions, a buffer against the power of the kings/dynasts, and in some cases, to reduce the power of the Roman provincial governors. Some level of freedom, autonomy, and self-rule was necessary to the stability of the empire.\n\nThroughout our period Rome was very pro-city, and the cities they dealt with were often 'upgraded' to various levels of autonomy.\n\n·It is impossible to know if Pompeius had decided on his approach to Syria before he arrived, or whether he made up his mind once he got there. During the previous year he had been busy establishing cities in Pontos in place of the kingdom of Mithridates, and he had reconciled many of the pirates to the loss of their freedom by placing them in cities. And he was a Roman, with a built-in prejudice for cities as against kings. There were plenty of cities in Syria. Yet only one of those cities had ever demonstrated any eagerness for autonomy, and a king had been proved to be necessary for the cities to survive. So, if the cities were to be presented with their unsought autonomy, they had also to be protected against the manifold enemies around them. The kings in and around Syria had demonstrated their willingness, indeed their eagerness, to acquire the lands and riches of the cities. They could scarcely be trusted to refrain from continuing their attacks once Pompeius had gone home. [HI:COSS,192-193]\n\n·The distinction between Roman rule through indirect control of client rulers and direct control of the cities is to some degree misleading. Both forms of rule were indirect, because Rome was unable to dominate her empire through intensive direct government. There were simply too few state representatives to perform such a task, so she resorted to a form of control using local political entities, great and small. Local governments were expected to maintain order in the areas under their jurisdiction, arrange for the collection of taxes, and oversee the production and distribution of foodstuffs in their territories. Of all forms of local government, the Romans had a marked preference for the city state, and in the eastern Mediterranean the model for this was the Greek polis. Effectively the polis was the definition of a city. By declaring the cities of Syria 'free', Pompey linked the notion of the Greek-style city state with Roman rule in the new province from the very beginning. Cities in particular were funda­mental to the structure of Roman power and the fabric of provincial space.\" [HI:RSNE,98-99]\n\n·\"Pompey did, however, favour the cities as against the dynasts inasmuch as he generally freed cities which had fallen into the power of dynasts. This policy was based on both sentimental and practical motives. On the one hand, Pompey fancied himself as a missionary of Greek civilization; he was carrying forward the traditional policy of the Roman republic, which had always been the friend of free peoples against kings, and he was himself a second Alexander, a founder of cities and a promoter of Hellenism.\" [HI:COERP, 258]\n\nOf course, this position of 'pro-civitas' was also a strategy--to keep the larger dynasts and kings from becoming too powerful via consolidation of the individual cities into their kingdoms. The altruism of 'we want people to be free of kings' is as much a pro-people statement as it is an anti-king one! Plus, in exchange for their 'status quo' autonomy, they would be the true practical infrastructure of the province (e.g. 'outsourcing' of day-to-day workloads).\n\n·\"Pompey's settlement was based, on the whole, on the status quo. He naturally made no attempt to revive the centralized administration of the Seleucids, which had long since ceased to exist and which was quite unsuited to a Roman province. Nor did he try to partition all Syria into city states, as he had done in Pontus; many parts of Syria were too backward for republican government, and it was better to leave the simple villagers and wild tribesmen of the mountains and deserts under the authority of dynasts whom they respected than to attach them to cities which would be too weak to control them, or to convert them into republican communities which would soon break down. Pompey did, however, favour the cities as against the dynasts inasmuch as he generally freed cities which had fallen into the power of dynasts. On the practical side, the freeing of cities was a convenient way of weakening the native kingdoms which had grown over-powerful, and in general cities were better subjects of the Roman people than dynasts. Dynasts intrigued and fought against one another, died leaving disputed successions or heirs who were minors, and in general required constant supervision; cities went on forever and were generally content to maintain their privileges. [HI:COERP, 258]\n\n·\"When he was deciding the future of Syria, Pompey was pressured on two fronts, neither of which could be easily overlooked. First, Rome realized that it could not install an efficient administration in the newly conquered territory through the efforts of its agents alone. The province of Asia, cre­ated in 129, had remained notoriously under-administered, and the cre­ation of Bithynia, Cilicia, Pontus, and now Syria, within just a few years, worsened the problems of governance. Moreover, Rome's custom was not to increase the number of its representatives, but rather to depend upon local communities, in particular the Greek city-statesassuming there were any. Second, many of the practices adopted in Syria during the long decline of the Seleucid monarchy could not be easily changed from one day to the next: dynasties, city-states, and emirs had all grown accustomed to an au­tonomy that might prove advantageous to Rome in the long run. In a sense, the second difficulty could be used to alleviate the first.\n\n·Indeed, the city-states of Syria formed the very backbone of the prov­ince; these were located in the former Seleukis and Phoenicia, plus there were a few groups of more or less isolated city-states in the Transjordan re­gion or on the Palestinian coast. All the others remained in the hands of cli­ent kings. In the province itself (which, owing to this dispersion, did not constitute a single geographic unit), Pompey nurtured the development of the region's real infrastructure, the city-states, to fill the gap left by the al­most nonexistent provincial administration. We have seen that many cities were emancipated during the long crisis in the Seleucid kingdom. Pompey did not reverse this situation, and it may have been during this period that some city-states saw their territory increase (Arados, for example, may have grown at the expense of Baitokaike). Many city-states had suffered from the Seleucid wars, from banditry, or from the Hasmonaean expan­sion, or even from all three at once. It was important to help them rebuild. [HI:MEUR,42]\n\nSo, Pompey's strategy was to strengthen the city-states, increasing their autonomy (especially freedom from the dynasts), and protecting them from those dynasts going forward. This was the reason for the creation of the provincial structure in Syria. It was to be a 'peacekeeping officer' to enforce the decentralization required for this to work.\n\nGrainger describes the situation and outcome:\n\n\"It is impossible to know if Pompeius had decided on his approach to Syria before he arrived, or whether he made up his mind once he got there. During the previous year he had been busy establishing cities in Pontos in place of the kingdom of Mithridates, and he had reconciled many of the pirates to the loss of their freedom by placing them in cities. And he was a Roman, with a built-in prejudice for cities as against kings. There were plenty of cities in Syria. Yet only one of those cities had ever demonstrated any eagerness for autonomy, and a king had been proved to be necessary for the cities to survive. So, if the cities were to be presented with their unsought autonomy, they had also to be protected against the manifold enemies around them. The kings in and around Syria had demonstrated their willingness, indeed their eagerness, to acquire the lands and riches of the cities. They could scarcely be trusted to refrain from continuing their attacks once Pompeius had gone home. [HI:COSS,192-193]\n\n\"This left Pompeius with the need to establish the cities and principalities as autonomous states, and, since they were incapable in most cases of maintaining their authority alone, they had to be protected. \"This now had to be done by Rome, since no other authority had the military and political power required, and that in turn meant the creation of a province, with a governor and an army. And, given a province, the various constituent parts of Syria would have to be reduced toa fairly uniform size, with no single entity being predominant over the rest. When Pompeius set off southwards through Syria, therefore, dealing out justice right and left, the cities received the most favoured treatment, at least in Pompeius' view. The five great cities were given autonomy, or had their existing autonomy confirmed. Seleukeia-in-Pieria was granted autonomy, Pompeius apparently remarking that the city was too strong to be attacked.96 Maybe it really was too strong, but there is no sign of Pompeius wishing to attack it, nor would there be any reason for him to do so, unless perhaps it had continued to stand by the Seleukids. But Antiochos XIII had been the city's man, and he soon vanished, murdered at last, it seems, by Samsigeramos, to whom his usefulness was now ended.97 So Seleukeia's autonomy was confirmed, this time with perhaps rather more sincerity than the kings had displayed. Antioch, inevitably, became formally autonomous, and adopted a Pompeian era.98 Apamea's fort was razed by Pompeius as he passed, and this is clearly a sign of increased local authority for the city,99 but it is also a sign of the essential impotence of the city as compared with either a royal or a Roman dynast. Laodikeia-ad-Mare and Arados were both secure and strong, and both had their autonomy confirmed, by implication if not by an actual known grant. Arados, uncharacteristically, was sufficiently grateful to Pom¬peius to fall foul of Caesar fifteen years later. [HI:COSS,194-195]\n\n\"Again, there were both cities and principalities to deal with, while the sheer size of Apamea's original territory meant that the independent fragments of it were more numerous. The Gabeni, the Mariamnitai, the Tardytenses, and probably other fragments were in this area. The fact that they were in Pliny's list means that Pompeius recognised their effective autonomy. Samsigeramos was restricted to a defined territory which included the urban centres of Emesa and Arethusa, but his rural desert lands could not be so easily defined.108 The territory of Arados was unaffected, which means that Pompeius confirmed it. The overall result was a patchwork of varying political entities, kings, tetrarchs, cities, and autonomous village communities. [HI:COSS,197]\n\nSome of these small client-states were tetrarchies, with the chief leader being a 'friend and ally' of the Roman people--the same term used for client kings.\n\n\"Besides these kingdoms and principalities that surrounded the provincia on all sides, there remained within the province itself indigenous principates, entrusted to tetrarchs who were \"friends and allies of the Roman people\"for example, the tetrarchy of Dexandros, an Apamaean Greek who was fortunate enough to have a principality carved out for him in the vicinity of his native city. The principalities of Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon (Chalcis of Lebanon, Area, Abila of Lysanias) were among the largest, but there were others in the mountain and steppe regions. Pliny names several in the Alouite mountains (Jebel Ansarie), such as the tetrarchy of the Nazareni, separated from Apamaea by the Orontes, the two tetrarchies of the Granucometai, and that of Mammisea; and he reports that there were seventeen other \"tetrarchies divided into kingdoms and bearing barbarian names,\" probably in the mountainous regions of northern and central Syria. A more precise geography of the principates would probably enable us to understand better why these kingdoms were maintained, but Pliny does not see fit to name them or to situate them, even roughly. The chiefs of these principates normally had the title tetrarch, a term found not only in Pliny's list, in the Gospels, and in Josephus, but also in a quite official inscription in Apamaea: L. Iulius Agrippa claims to descend from tetrarchs who were \"friends and allies of the Roman people\" on both his mother's and his father's side.137 The term tetrarch is the only title known for these leaders besides that of king. In stressing the fact that tetrarchies were viewed as kingdoms, Pliny no doubt sought to emphasize their standing as independent states even though they were friends and allies of Rome. We also know, however, that Rome reserved the royal title for its most loyal and most capable allies: in 4 B.C.E., Augustus refused to give the title to Herod's three sons and successors, remarking that time would tell whether or not they were worthy of it.\" [HI:MEUR,70-72]\n\nBut if we had to describe the actions of the Roman authorities relative to the freedom and status of the cities, as they passed through in conquest, re-conquest, or attempts to stabilize the region, we would basically use to phrases: \"no real change\" and \"increasing autonomy\". The literature consistently points out that the Roman authorities maintained the status quo, with only minor 'interruptions' in dynastic 'dreams'! Many of the larger cities (like Apamea) were already free before Rome came, and most of them saw their status affirmed or even elevated (sometimes with larger territory).\n\nTo see this clearly, we can step through the historical 'actors on stage'\n\n________________________________________________________________ __________________\n\nThree: Outline of historical events and the impact on the cities of the region\n\nBefore Rome: As the Seleucid empire crumbled, the cities in Syria declared their independence from it, and Syria devolved into a loose collection of independent city-states. Some of this was actually a royal initiative of Antiochus IV Ephiphanes (175-164 BC), and some was just 'attrition' due to the civil wars.\n\nHere is the account given by Jones (long quote):\n\n\"It is also very difficult to say how many of these foundations were genuine cities, possessing autonomy and a territory. A papyrus of the middle of the third century speaks of 'the priests, the magistrates, and the other citizens' at Seleucia, and 'the priests and the boards of magistrates and all the young men of the gymnasium' at Antioch. Further light has been thrown on the constitution of the cities and their relation to the royal power by a recently discovered letter of Seleucus IV to Seleucia in Pieria, and a decree of the city, dated 186 B.C., in response to the letter, granting the citizenship to Amphilochus, one of the king's 'honoured friends', and erecting a statue of him sent by the king. These documents show that the city was subject to a royal governor; the decree is passed by the people 'on the proposal of Theophilus the governor and the magistrates', and even so trivial a matter as the choice of a place for the statue is to be decided by the governor and magistrates. The importance of the governor's position is emphasized in the address of Seleucus' letter, 'To Theophilus and the magistrates and city of the Seleuceis in Pieria.' The city makes no attempt to conceal its subjection to the royal power; the preamble of the decree begins 'Whereas an order had been received from the king concerning Amphilochus, one of his honoured friends' and then rather lamely recapitulates the other motives for the decreethe desire of Amphilochus to settle in the city, his goodwill towards it, and so forth. But the inscription does prove that Seleucia enjoyed formal autonomy, possessing an assembly which could pass decrees and magistrates who could execute them. It also proves incidentally that, as might have been expected, the citizens were divided into demes and tribes; Amphilochus is registered in the deme Olympieus and the tribe Laodicis. Apamea is known to have possessed a territory in the second century; Tryphon is said to have been born in 'Casiana, a fort in the land of the Apamenes', and Strabo says that Larissa, Casiana, Megara, and Apollonia 'used (in Tryphon's day) to be attached to Apamea'. [HI:COERP,246f]\n\n\"Under Antiochus Epiphanes the urbanization of Syria received a marked impetus. Antiochus has the reputation of being a keen philhellene and a missionary of Greek culture. It may be doubted, however, whether his sole motive in granting autonomy to so many cities was his desire to promote Hellenism. The Seleucid kings had been in chronic financial difficulties since the treaty of Apamea, as the very impolitic attempts of Seleucus IV and Antio¬chus IV to seize the temple treasure of Jerusalem and Elymais show. Now the author of the second book of Maccabees states that the Jews paid a very large sum for the privilege of having Jerusalem recognized a city. This suggests that Epiphanes may have thought that the sale of charters to towns was a more politic way of raising money than the seizure of temple treasures. The policy also appealed to his rather theatrical philhellenism; the grant of the two cities of Tarsus and Mopsuhestia to his concubine Antiochis suggests that he did not really hold city autonomy very sacred.26\n\nBe that as it may, his policy was warmly welcomed by his sub-jects. He was only giving official sanction to a movement which had long been in progress. The beginnings of hellenization date from before the Macedonian conquest of Syria. [HI:COERP,248f]\n\n\"Inevitably the spread of Greek culture brought with it the spread of Greek political ideas, and it became the ambition of the native communities to convert themselves into republican city states on the Greek model. The city had long been the regular political unit in many parts of Syria, and the germs of republican institutions had existed before the Macedonian conquest. In these cities the only change required was the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republican constitution, and this change had already taken place in Tyre and Sidon about the middle of the third century, where eras of 'the people of Tyre' and 'the people of Sidon' mark the establishment of democracy. At Bambyce too the priestly dynasty had been deposed by Seleucus Nicator, and the town organized as a city under the style of Hierapolis.\n\nThe more important of the native cities and of the Greek colonies received additional privileges from Epiphanes. We have unfortunately no literary record of what they were, save that it was Antiochus Epiphanes who built the council-chamber of Antioch. This can hardly mean that it was he who first granted councils to the cities of the tetrapolis; there is it is true no earlier evidence of city councilsthe papyrus of 246 B.C. mentions only the boards of magistrates, and the decree of 186 B.C. speaks only of the magistrates and the peoplebut other Seleucid foundations, such as Antioch in Persis, already possessed councils under Antiochus III. It was more probably what would nowadays be described as a 'gesture', and implies the grant of wider autonomy to the city authorities. The only privilege of which we can be certain is the right of coinage. Antiochus gave this in two degrees: some cities were allowed to issue coins bearing the royal effigy only, some had to add the royal superscription. In the former and more privileged class were Antioch, Apamea, Seleucia, and Loadicea, and three native cities, Hierapolis, Tripolis, and Ptolemais, renamed Antioch in Ptolemais. In the lower class were the Phoenician cities of Tyre, Sidon, Byblus, Ascalon, and Berytus, which had been renamed, probably by Seleucus IV, Laodicea in Phoenice. Arad, which had long been a free city, also altered the style of her coinage at the beginning of Epiphanes' reign, inscribing her name in full instead of using a monogram; the motive of this change must have been a desire to assert her superiority over her sister Phoenician cities. [HI:COERP, 250f]\n\n\"Antiochus Epiphanes thus promoted, or at any rate, sanctioned, for as I have shown the initiative seems to have come from below, the decentralization of his kingdom. The new cities seem to have possessed territorial jurisdiction; this is implied by the decree of Demetrius I declaring 'the city of the Hierosoly-mites to be holy and inviolable and free as far as its boundaries'. They still paid the same taxes to the royal treasury that their districts had hitherto paidthese are specified at length in Demetrius' decree, the salt-tax, the crown-tax, the third of the crops, the half of the fruit-tree crops, the poll-tax. It is possible that these taxes were now collected by the city authorities, but the survival of the office of 'strategus and meridarch', that is, military and civil governor of the district, implies that the central government still maintained an active control over the administration of the city territory.32\n\nThe policy of urbanization was carried on by Epiphanes' successors; Cyrrhus, for instance, began to strike coins with the royal effigy under Alexander Balas. The later Seleucid kings had, however, little choice in the matter. During the second half of the second century the dynasty was weakened by almost chronic civil war between rival claimants to the throne. Each successive struggle involved a corresponding diminution of the royal power; rival candidates outbid one another in offering privileges to the various communities in the hope of winning their support, and in the general confusion cities declared their independence and fought and conquered one another, and in the more backward regions dynasts arose and began to carve out kingdoms for themselves. Syria thus eventually became a mosaic of kingdoms, principalities, and free cities, while the kings became little better than rival condottieri.33\n\n[HI:COERP, 253]\n\n\"The prolonged civil war between Antiochus VIII Grypus and Antiochus IX Cyzicenus, which dragged on from 116 to 96 B.C., led to further disintegration. Most of the coastal cities at this time obtained formal recognition of their freedom. Sidon and Tripolis inaugurated new eras in 111 B.C., Seleucia in 108 B.C., Ascalon in 104 B.C.; Berytus followed some years later in 80 B.C. Gabala seems also to have started a new era about this time; coins of Gabala of the early first century dated in the year 28 survive. These eras certainly represent the formal grant of freedom; in one case, that of Seleucia, we possess the actual letter of the king, Antiochus VIII probably, announcing to the magistrates, council, and people of the city, which was already 'holy and inviolable', that he had granted it freedom, and enclosing copies of similar letters which he had sent to Ptolemy, king of Cyprus, and the Roman senate. Other cities began to issue autonomous coins without starting a new era, and therefore probably without having been formally freed, for instance, Orthosia (dating by the Seleucid era) and Epiphaneia (dating by the Aradian era). Larissa revolted from Apameathe war of independence is described in terms of ridicule by Poseidoniusand began to issue her own coinage in 85 B.C. (by the Seleucid era). Almost the only city which still recognized the Seleucids was Damascus, where Demetrius III and Antiochus XII still managed to maintain themselves down to about 83 B.C. It obtained under them a very belated municipal independence and struck coins under the name of Demetrias bearing the effigies of these kings.36 [HI:COERP, 255]\n\nPompey: The advent, conquest, and programs of Pompey actually accelerated the independence of the cities--in keeping with the political necessity for Rome's position. Most of the time it was a simple \"preserve the status quo\" (i.e. the autonomy of the city-states vis-à-vis the monarchs, and relative political power relations) but in some cases it was an expansion of freedom and privilege of the city-states.\n\n\"Pompey's settlement was based, on the whole, on the status quo. He naturally made no attempt to revive the centralized administration of the Seleucids, which had long since ceased to exist and which was quite unsuited to a Roman province. Nor did he try to partition all Syria into city states, as he had done in Pontus; many parts of Syria were too backward for republican government, and it was better to leave the simple villagers and wild tribesmen of the mountains and deserts under the authority of dynasts whom they respected than to attach them to cities which would be too weak to control them, or to convert them into republican communities which would soon break down. Pompey did, however, favour the cities as against the dynasts inasmuch as he generally freed cities which had fallen into the power of dynasts. [HI:COERP, 258]\n\n\"In northern Syria the details of Pompey's settlement are not known. Josephus' history does not cover this area, and we have thus only scattered notes to go upon. Pompey recognized the freedom of Seleucia in Pieria, and seems to have conferred some benefit on Gabala, which adopted a new era at this time. He executed Silas the Jew, but does not seem to have suppressed his principality, Lysias, which still survived in Caesar's time. Cicero twits Pompey with his friendship with Samsigeramus, who retained his principality of Emesa and Arethusa in Caesar's day. His neighbours Alchaedamnus of the Rhambaei, and Gambarus and Themella were also still in power at that time. Pompey also confirmed Antiochus of Commagene in his kingdom and presented him with a piece of Mesopotamia. In general Pompey seems thus to have preserved the status quo unaltered. [HI:COERP, 261-2]\n\n\"In the spring of 63 BC Pompey left Antioch and marched south with an army, extorting money, executing 'tyrants', and reducing the power of some of the native principalities. He seems to have posed as the champion of the Greek-style city states, 'liberating' them from the rule of tyrants and dynasts. Pompey had not greatly altered the political makeup of Syria, although the fact of Roman rule now meant that the status of a community was decided by Rome rather than through the community's independent interactions with its neighbours. The more powerful could negotiate better deals, but Roman con­trol of status, favours and obligations could not be challenged except through open rebellion. For the city states, 'freedom' presumably came at a cost, in the form of tribute to Rome. The major dynasts, as 'friends' of Rome, may not have had to provide tribute at all, although at least one found it prudent to bribe Pompey to retain his throne. At this early stage Rome had not yet established for certain who were friends and who were enemies [HI:RSNE,22f; Note: the 'presumably' word shows that there is no read data to support the statement that 'free cities' had to pay tribute--as the definition of civitas libera MEANS!]\n\nCaesar: After the death of Pompey in 49 BC, Caesar visited Syria, but made very little changes, most of which were for INCREASED freedom for cities.\n\n·\"Pompey seems thus to have preserved the status quo unaltered. For a complete picture of northern Syria we must go down to the beginning of Augustus' reign. Conditions had probably changed very little in the interval. Caesar freed Antioch and probably Laodicea on Sea, which assumed the surname of Julia; he also apparently gave additional privileges to Gabala.\" [HI:COERP, 261-2]\n\n·\"Caesar toured the east shortly after Pompey's death. The civil war was over, but the Roman world was still polarized into pro- and anti-Caesarian factions. The great general honoured cities such as Laodicea and Antioch, and his compacts with local dynasts requested that they should consider it their duty to safeguard Roman interests in Syria. But which Roman interests, given that there were two camps? The republicans also initiated negotiations with the Parthian king, sending an envoy, Quintus Aetius Labienus, to the Parthian court to ask for military assistance. Cassius withdrew most of the Roman troops to join the republican forces in Macedonia for the final confrontation with Caesar's supporters. The defeat of the republican forces at Philippi in 42 led to a temporary peace in the Roman empire, but the two principal beneficiaries of the victory at Philippi, Mark Antony and Caesar's heir Octavian, soon began to quarrel. Antony placed two of the defeated republican legions in Syria, which, as it turned out, was an error of judgement.\" [HI:RSNE,36- 38]\n\nThe Bassus incident at Apamea: During this civil war in the empire, a supporter of one of the anti-Caesar factions rebelled and based his rebellion in Apamea. He used the fortress of Apamea to successfully resist huge provincial armies and was able to step down gracefully. Apamea's big fortress (of Seleucid 'elephant' fame) had been destroyed by Pompey twenty years earlier, but apparently another one had been built. But there is no evidence that the city was destroyed or affected negatively in any way from this.\n\n·\"In the summer of 46 BC a rumour circulated that Caesar was dead, and this was sufficient to provoke a renegade Pompeian called Caecilius Bassus to demonstrate where his sympathies lay. In the aftermath of Pompey's defeat Bassus had fled to Tyre, a city which he now seized. From there he managed to win over the Syrian legions and engineered the murder of Caesar's nephew Sextus, who had been appointed governor. Bassus gained the support of local dynasts and the Parthians. He established his headquarters in the fortress of Apamea and resisted Caesarian attempts to overthrow him. In 44 the governors of two provinces in Asia Minor arrived with huge armies and besieged Bassus at Apamea, without success. But in the same year Julius Caesar was assassinated in Rome, and his 'republican' murderers began organizing their armies for a struggle against Caesar's supporters. One of these republicans, Gaius Cassius Longinus, arrived in Syria in 43. He had governed the province after the death of Crassus, and may have been able to make use of old connections there to secure his power base. Cassius won over both rebel and Caesarian legions and Bassus was able to step down without losing face.\" [HI:RSNE,36- 38]\n\nThe Parthian Invasion of 40BC: After the defeat of the republican armies, two of those legions (now demoralized) were assigned to Syria. In this post-conflict vacuum, Parthia arose again--under the leadership of republican Roman officers--and captured Syria--including Apamea--and gave THEIR version of 'autonomy' to some of the cities--including Apamea\n\n\"But in the same year Julius Caesar was assassinated in Rome, and his 'republican' murderers began organizing their armies for a struggle against Caesar's supporters.

At the Parthian court, Cassius' envoy Labienus and King Orodes decided to launch an invasion of Syria, to be led by the Roman com­mander and the king's son Pacorus. They overwhelmed the republican legions (some of whom deserted), and while Labienus led an expedition west into Asia Minor, Pacorus took his armies south, accepting the submission of Syrian states as he went. The Roman province was lost to the Parthians (40 BC), who now acquired their outlet on the Mediterranean. --- Tangible evidence of the invasion is sparse. Coins issued at Antioch and Apamea during the Parthian occupation show that the cities abandoned new dating systems which had been adopted under the Romans and reverted to dat­ing by the Seleucid era (which they had used prior to the Roman annexation). Overall the rapid disintegration of Roman con­trol illustrates the precarious nature of their rule in Syria at this time; but the subsequent collapse of Parthian domination does not suggest that the invaders were any more secure. Antony had problems dealing with the increasingly hostile machinations of Octavian, but in 39 he sent a deputy, Publius Ventidius Bassus, with an army to recover the east. Ventidius' campaign was remarkably successful; in the engagements Labienus and Pacorus were killed, and the Parthian army was forced to withdraw. The Roman commander then set about restoring Roman control of the Syrian province. This proved to be a complex task; many states and dynasts now had reason to oppose Rome, being either Parthian appointees, such as the Hasmonaean Antigonus in Judaea, or had conspicuously aided the Parthians, such as the Phoenician island state of Aradus, and Antiochus I, king of Commagene. [HI:RSNE,89-90]\n\nAntony: Although Antony did not seem to have the management savvy of either Pompey or the later Augustus, he nevertheless continued preserving the status quo and continued growth the number and strength of the free cities.\n\n·\"We have seen how a network of client states was gradually built up, begin­ning under Pompey, and how Antony maintained and expanded upon this system, as he had done in Anatolia, in order to govern the less Hellenized areas of Syria.134 After Antony's final land grants, the province of Syria proper found itself surrounded on all sides by client states that separated it from the other Roman provinces\" [HI:MEUR,70-72]\n\n·\"Syria enjoyed a number of years of peace under Antony's government. However, the new ruler of the east pursued policies that led to profound territorial changes throughout the Near East. Antony apparently sought to retain as much of the system of indirect administration as he could, by means of a network of client princes that had proved itself in Anatolia and Asia Minor as well as in Syria. Not only did he leave in place existing principalities, such as those of Malichos I of Nabataea, Sampsigeramos of Emesa and Arethusa, Tarcondimotos in the Amanus region, and Ptolemy's son Lysanias in the Anti-Lebanon, but he contributed to further partitioning as well.\" [HI:MEUR,52]\n\n·\"Since its creation by Pompey, the province of Syria had undergone only a few minor changes, resulting from Antony's gifts to some of his clients; for example, two cities of the Decapolis, Gadara and Hippos, were given to Herod. For the most part, however, all of the former Seleukis, as well as Phoenicia from Arados to Dora, Damascus, and the Transjordan cities of the Decapolis, continued to be part of the province. Its territories were fragmented because a few minor client states remained, some in close prox­imity to the most urbanized sectors, and they governed populations that were only slightly Hellenized, if at all, and not very urban.\" [HI:MEUR,55-56]\n\nOctavian/Augustus: The Syrians generally supported Antony (a logical choice since was de facto their quasi-rule), so when Octavian visit Syria after the defeat of Antony we might have expected some reprisals--but they are few and far between and were mostly reversed shortly thereafter. In fact, there seem to have been several cases of 'enhanced' freedom.\n\n·\"The only change recorded of Augustus himself is the deposition of Alexander the son of Samsigeramus. Antioch and Seleucia of the tetrapolis adopted the Actian era. [HI:COERP, 261-2]\n\n·\"For the cities of the Phoenician coast and the tetrapolis Pliny does not use the official sources, save that he mentions the Leucadii, that is Balaneae, by mistake in the list of 'the rest of Syria'. The coins here fill the gap. Of the Phoenician cities Arad and Marathus, Balaneae (under the style of Leucas) and Gabala all coined during the early principate; Paltus did not begin to issue till the reign of Septimius Severus. All four cities of the tetrapolis coined during the early principate. Antioch, Laodicea, and Seleucia were, according to Pliny, free cities. On the upper Orontes, Larissa, Epiphaneia, Arethusa, Emesa, and Laodicea by Libanus and, in the mountains west of Emesa, Mariamme all figured in the official register; Seleucia ad Belum may have done soit is in Pliny's list of Coele Syria. Of these cities only Laodicea and Emesa coined, and even these only from the latter part of the second century. The mention of Emesa incidentally fixes the date of the official register, for it was until 30 B.C. ruled by Iamblichus, son of Samsigeramus, and in 20 B.C. the dynasty was restored and lasted till A.D. 72 at least. Emesa would thus have been registered as a city only during the first ten years of Augustus' reign. [HI:COERP, 263]\n\n·\"As in all the provinces of the eastern Mediterranean, cities retained the right to issue their own coins with the consent of the emperor; these have been called \"imperial Greeks\" since the publication of a seminal article by T. B. Jones, but more recent scholars correctly prefer the title provincial coins, placing them on the same level as coins issued by the provincial koina and other groups. These were generally bronze, rarely silver. In northern Syria, these civic issues, which existed only by imperial privilege [tn: i.e, by Augustus' approval of statements of freedom by the cities], began to display portraits of emperors quite latestarting only in 4-3 B.C.e. in Apamaea, in 6 c.e. in Seleucia, and during the reign of Caligula in Laodicea. By contrast, imperial images were featured regularly on the coins issued in the cities of the Decapolis.137 [HI:MEUR,254]\n\n·\"Apart from a few modifications, some of which were short-lived, Octavianwho had virtually no support in Syriaretained the basic organi­zation set up by Pompey and later by Antony. In 30 B.C.e. he annexed the kingdom of Tarcondimotos I in the Amanus region, in eastern Cilicia, and also the principality of Iamblichos of Emesa. Tarcondimotos had been one of Antony's most faithful allies: on coins he is called Philantonios, and he perished in the service of the triumvir at Actium. His son Tarcondimotos II immediately succeeded him but made the mistake of allowing groups of gladiators trying to rejoin Antony in Egypt to pass through unopposed. As for Iamblichos of Emesa, he had been executed by Antony, who suspected him of treason, and his brother Alexander (or Alexas) had replaced him; we do not know exactly what Alexander did to displease Augustus, but he was deposed, displayed in Augustus's triumphal procession, and later exe­cuted.7 Ultimately, all these annexations proved premature. Given Rome's inability to administer the outlying regions, Octavian (who had become Augustus in the interim) gave the two states back to members of local dy­nasties in 20 B.C.e. Tarcondimotos II Philopator regained his kingdom, and Iamblichos, the son of the homonymous dynast who had been executed in 31, replaced his uncle Alexander at Emesa. The only annexed territory the province of Syria retained was Cilicia Campestris (Cilicia-on-the-Plain, which had been annexed in 30 B.C.e.). Other minor annexations were car­ried out as well, such as those of Seleucia on the Euphrates (Zeugma), and also perhaps Doliche; these were removed from the kingdom of Commagene for strategic reasons, and at the time of Herod's death in 4 b.C.E., Gaza, Gadara, and Hippos were also annexed.\" [HI:MEUR,55-56]\n\n·\"When Antony was defeated at Actium in 31 BC, Syria fell into the hands of Octavian. Late in 30 BC, with Antony and Cleopatra dead and Egypt annexed to the empire, Octavian arrived in the province, and local communities had to negotiate their status with yet another Roman warlord. Among them were the dynasts who had supported Antony. Of these some, like Herod, were successful in convincing Octavian of their value to his regime; others were not so successful, and were deposed. However, once the situation in the east had stabilized, the deposed dynasties were restored. This was a clear indication that eastern dynasts were reliant on imperial favour, and that the emperor could depose or instate kings at will. But it was also a sign that Rome would respect some of the existing configurations of power  for the moment. --- Favours were also extended to or retracted from cities. During his later visit to Syria in 20 BC Octavian, now styled Augustus, deprived Sidon and Tyre of their liberty 'for dishonouring the treaties which they had struck with Rome Aside from the major client states, we also catch occasional glimpses of other, smaller or less powerful non-civic communities, particularly in northern Syria during the first centuries BC and AD. These are thought to be a product of the instability of the late Seleucid period, when nomads moved in and began to encroach upon the settled regions and weakened the authority of the cities there. An inscription from Apamea honouring a second-century ad civic notable, Lucius Julius Agrippa, describes him as the descendant of a tetrarch called Dexandros. first high priest of the provincial imperial cult under Augustus. His tetrarchy was presumably in the vicinity of Apamea, and it is noteworthy that such non-civic communities could be found interspersed between the great Hellenistic foundations of northern Syria. \" [HI:RSNE,89-90]\n\nSo, with minor exceptions of demotion that 'stuck'--offset by a greater number of promotions that lasted well past Augustus--the political situation of independent city-states, tetrarchies, and client-kingdoms that 'went into the Roman Empire' also 'came out' by the end of our period (i.e. at the death of Augustus--well after the census at Apamea).\n\nSo, in the absence of contrary data, if Apamea was free when Pompey arrived, then it is more probable than not that its freedom was maintained or even improved at the time of the death of Augustus. Each of the main figures in this stream of history (including the Parthians) increased the autonomy-level of the majority of city-states in North Syria.\n\nThe demotions that DID occur--and we have them in the records--were generally reversed by the time Augustus died.\n\n________________________________________________________________ __________________\n\nFour: Specific Data about Apamea\n\nLet's turn now to the specific data about Apamea and see if the data indicates a 'reversal of fortune' for it, or whether it gives us more reason to believe that it was a 'free city' at the alleged time of the Census there.\n\nAs a reminder of what we are looking for--in order to establish its civic status as that of a 'civitas' (independent city-state, polis, exempt from 'normal' provincial taxes)--we are looking for evidence that any/some/all of these criteria were met:\n\n1.It was actually called a civitas in the historical record, or\n\n2.Had a treaty with Rome or a decree from the emperor, or\n\n3.Issued civic coins, or\n\n4.Celebrated Greek festivals, or\n\n5.Had a territory in which there were villages (komai), and\n\n6.Was not itself dependent on another city.\n\nTo the extent we find evidence of these, to that extent we can conclude that they were 'free'. If there are multiple strands of evidence (i.e. more than one of these present), then the case is even stronger.\n\nWhat data do we have?\n\n1.The census inscription under discussion\n\n2.Pliny's description of Syria\n\n3.Strabo's description of Syria\n\n4.The L. Julius Agrippa inscription from Apamea (and the role of the imperial cult)\n\n5.Information about the cities dependent on Apamea (e.g. the Poseidonius reference, the gifts of Antony)\n\n6.Coinage: A first look (with perhaps more discussion/interaction with authorities in the last section)\n\n7.Historical summary of the data from the above\n\nOne: The census inscription under discussion.\n\nThis is the document that was under discussion in the original document, with Dr. Carrier disagreeing as to the interpretation of it. I dont need to discuss background, since that is easily found.\n\nHere's a translation of the 22 lines that make up the inscription:\n\nIn a study on the demographics of Syria, David Kennedy describes and discusses this inscription (David Kennedy, \"Demography, the Population of Syria and the Census of Q. Aemilius Secudus\", in LEVANT 38, 2006, pp 109-124):\n\n\"Apamea was one of the four cities ... of the so-called Syrian Tetrapolis. It had been the former Seleucid military capital and is commonly regarded as being second only to Antioch in size and therefore one of the two or three largest in all of Syria The key part of this inscription is the appointment by P. Sulpicius Quirinius - the same Syrian governor as in the Gospel of Luke above - of Q. Aemiliuss Secundus, Prefect of an auxiliary regiment, the Cohors II Classica, as censitor for the Civitas Apamenorum. The relevant lines read: 'having been instructed by Quirinius to conduct a census in the city state of Apamea, counted 117,000 citizens.' What can we do with the number? First, there is a consensus that the count at Apamea involved both the town and the territory that constituted the State of Apamea. That seems obvious enough -- even at its greatest extent in later generations, an area within the walls of 250 ha would not have supported a population of 117,000 free inhabitants plus an unknown number of resident non-citizens and slaves Nor has anyone doubted the number as reported; although it has plainly been rounded, it is only to the nearest thousand.\" [p113, 114]\n\nWhat do we get out of this inscription?\n\nWe get two major things:\n\n·It was explicitly called a civitas (Criterion 1) and\n\n·It had a territory (Criterion 5).\n\n[Of course, we really only need Criterion 1 (being called a civitas in the historical record) to prove it was 'called a civitas' but it never hurts to assemble as much as possible--in case some piece of data is ambiguous or controversial.]\n\nTwo: Pliny's description of Syria\n\nPliny the Elder is writing his Natural History circa 77 AD. As he moves through the various geographies of the Roman world, he describes the Syrian element in this way [NH 5.18ff]:\n\n\"Here Phnicia ends, and Syria recommences. The towns [oppida] are, Carne, Balanea, Paltos, and Gabale; then the promontory upon which is situated free [libera] Laodicea; and then Diospolis, Heraclea, Charadrus, and Posidium.\n\n\"(21.) We then come to the Promontory of Syria Antiochia. In the interior is free [libera] Antiochia itself, surnamed Epidaphnes, and divided by the river Orontes. On the promontory is free [libera] Seleucia, called Pieria. (22.) Beyond it lies Mount Casius Upon this coast there is the river Orontes, which takes its rise near Heliopolis, between the range of Libanus and Antilibanus. The towns [oppida] are Rhosos, and, behind it, the Gates of Syria, lying in the space between the chain of the Rhosian mountains and that of Taurus. On the coast there is the town [oppidum] of Myriandros, and Mount Amanus, upon which is the town [oppidum] of Bomitæ. This mountain separates Cilicia from Syria.\n\n\"We must now speak of the interior of Syria. Cle Syria has Apamea, divided by the river Marsyas from the Tetrarchy of the Nazerini; Bambyx, the other name of which is Hierapolis, but by the Syrians called Mabog, (here the monster Atargatis, called Derceto by the Greeks, is worshipped); and the place called Chalcis on the Belus, from which the region of Chalcidene, the most fertile part of Syria, takes its name. We here find also Cyrrhestice, with Cyrrhum, the Gazatæ, the Gindareni, the Gabeni, the two Tetrarchies called Granucomatæ, the Emeseni, the Hylatæ, the nation (gentem) of the Ituræi, and a branch of them, called the Bætarreni; the Mariamitani, the Tetrarchy known as Marnmisea, Paradisus, Pagræ, the Pinaritæ, two Seleucia's, besides the one already mentioned, the one Seleucia on the Euphrates, and the other Seleucia on the Belus, and the Cardytenses. The remaining part of Syria (except those parts which will be spoken of in conjunction with the Euphrates) contains the Arethusii, the Berenses, and the Epiphanæenses; and on the east, the Laodiceni, who are called the Laodiceni on the Libanus, the Leucadii, and the Larissæi, besides seventeen other Tetrarchies, divided into kingdoms [regna] and bearing barbarous names.\"\n\nWe do know that Pliny was a little confused here, working from both official lists of Augustus (the 'Counting Guy' as I pointed out elsewhere xyz) and literary sources. He is known to be wrong in some cases.\n\nJones describes Pliny's approach and information:\n\n\"Our knowledge of northern Syria at the beginning of the reign of Augustus is derived from the official lists of the time. These have been partly preserved, in a very mangled form, in Pliny. Pliny gives two lists, both arranged in alphabetical order, one of which he heads 'Coele Syria', the other 'the rest of Syria'. The names in the second list are certainly all derived from an official register; they are all given in the ethnic. The official register evidently included all northern Syria; it included, Pliny states, cities on the Euphrates, which he did not transcribe; the names he did transcribe include Beroea in Cyrrhestice, Larissa, Epiphaneia, Arethusa, and Laodicea by Libanus on the Orontes, and Leucas, which, though Pliny was unaware of the fact, since he catalogued Balaneae separately, was on the coast. The other list, though it contains official elementssome names are given in the ethnicwas evidently concocted by Pliny himself. The alpha­betical order is certainly Pliny's, for he places Bambyce under B, whereas its official name was Hierapolis; the 'Granucomatitae' also are placed under G, although the name is probably a blunder for Tigranucometae; both the blunder and the place of the name in the list must then be Pliny's. The distinction between Coele Syria and 'the rest of Syria' is also quite fantastic; the cities of the two lists are inextricably confused; Bambyce and Chalcis are in Coele, Beroea in 'the rest', Arethusa and Laodicea by Libanus are in 'the rest', Emesa in Coele. Furthermore, the list of Coele Syria contains some elements drawn from literary sources, such as, for instance, the notes on the Seleucid satrapies of Cyrrhestice and Chalcidene. The explanation of this muddle is probably as follows. Pliny had before him an official list of the reign of Augustus, headed 'Syria' simply, and various Greek literary sources, some of which used the term Coele Syria. Pliny made up a list of all the places which were placed in Coele Syria by the literary authorities; some of these were mentioned in the official list also, and these he put down sometimes in the form in which he found them in the official list, that is, in the ethnic, sometimes in the literary form. Those names which he did not find in the literary sources, or which at any rate were not assigned in them to Coele Syria, he added as a separate list, 'the rest of Syria'; 'the rest of Syria' therefore includes 'seventeen tetrarchies with barbarian names' which were naturally not noted in the literary sources. If this analysis is correct, the only names which certainly were from the official list are those in the list of 'the rest of Syria', and those given in the ethnic in the list of Coele Syria; other names in the Coele Syria list must be judged on their merits; they may have occurred in both the official and literary sources, or only in the literary. The coins, unfortunately, give little help in this region, for many cities issued no coins during the principate. Even the important city of Apamea on the Orontes made one issue only, on the occasion of its receiving the surname of Claudia from the emperor Claudius [TN: this seems to be incorrect-- We have coins from 12 of the 43 years of Octavius/Augustus and from the first year of Tiberius]. Epiphaneia and Larissa did not coin at all under the principate, though both had done so before the Roman occupation.47\n\n\"For the cities of the Phoenician coast and the tetrapolis Pliny does not use the official sources, save that he mentions the Leucadii, that is Balaneae, by mistake in the list of 'the rest of Syria'. The coins here fill the gap. Of the Phoenician cities Arad and Marathus, Balaneae (under the style of Leucas) and Gabala all coined during the early principate; Paltus did not begin to issue till the reign of Septimius Severus. All four cities of the tetrapolis coined during the early principate. Antioch, Laodicea, and Seleucia were, according to Pliny, free cities. On the upper Orontes, Larissa, Epiphaneia, Arethusa, Emesa, and Laodicea by Libanus and, in the mountains west of Emesa, Mariamme all figured in the official register; Seleucia ad Belum may have done soit is in Pliny's list of Coele Syria. Of these cities only Laodicea and Emesa coined, and even these only from the latter part of the second century. The mention of Emesa incidentally fixes the date of the official register, for it was until 30 B.C. ruled by Iamblichus, son of Samsigeramus, and in 20 B.C. the dynasty was restored and lasted till A.D. 72 at least. Emesa would thus have been registered as a city only during the first ten years of Augustus' reign.\n\n\"East of the Orontes Pliny gives only one city from the official register, Beroea. He also mentions in the Coele Syria list, Bambyce also called Hierapolis, Chalcis ad Belum, Cyrrhus, and Seleucia on the Euphrates. The last is also mentioned under the form of Zeugma in his survey of the Euphrates, where he gives two other names, Antioch on the Euphrates and Europus. Many of these cities coined later, Beroea, Hierapolis, Chalcis, Cyrrhus, and Zeugma from the reign of Trajan, Antioch on the Euphrates from that of Marcus Aurelius; Europus issued no coins. Except for Beroea we cannot be certain that any of them had city rank in the early principate; they may have been still, as in the early first century B.C., ruled by dynasts, and have been included among 'the seventeen tetrarchies with barbarian names distributed into kingdoms' which Pliny found in the official register. Chalcis when it began to coin used an era dating from A.D. 92, which implies that it was freed from a dynastperhaps Aristobulus, son of Herod at that date. Pliny omits Nicopolis; the reason perhaps is that being under a dynast it did not appear on the official list, and in Pliny's literary authorities it was placed in Cilicia, as it is by Strabo and Ptolemy.\n\n\"In addition to these names Pliny quotes from the official register many others which, to the best of our knowledge, never were cities. Such are the Gazetae, the Gindareni, the Gabeni, the Hylatae, the Penelenitae, the Tardytenses. He also mentions besides the seventeen unnamed tetrarchies the tetrarchy of the Nazerini, two of the Tigranucometae (to accept the current emendation), and another called Mammisea. These are certainly from the official list; more doubtful are the races of the Ituraeans and their neighbours the Baethaemi, which may be derived from a literary source. It thus appears that northern Syria was by no means entirely occupied by the territories of the cities; a large area was occupied by village and tribal communities and small principalities. Unfortunately very few of these can be located definitely. ... The tetrarchy of the Nazerini is stated by Pliny to have adjoined the territory of Apamea; the Nazerini must therefore be the ancestors of the modern Nusairi who inhabit the mountains behind Laodicea. Some, at any rate, of the villages, tribes, and tetrarchies, and quite a large number of them, if the tentative identifications suggested above are correct, were interspersed among the great cities of the western part of the Seleucia; the majority lay, no doubt, in the less civilized eastern part, where cities were scarce and nomadic life prevailed.48 [HI:COERP, 2632-265]\n\nWhat can we learn from Pliny?\n\nProbably nothinghe doesnt call it a non-civic town (oppidum) or free city (liber) or colonia or urbe or civitas or anything it is separated from a tetrarchy by a river which MIGHT imply it was the district, but we know from Strabo (below) that the city itself was on a peninsula (which would also fit this description).\n\nBut we might raise an objection from Plinythe city Apamea was one of the tetrapolis with Antioch, Laodicea, and Seleucia. Those three cities were called libera (free from taxation cities) in the previous section, where he discussed the Phoenician/Coast areas. Could we argue from silence, that since he did NOT use liber to describe Apamea, that it was not such?\n\nProbably not. Even though he seems to try to note any special privileges of the urban cities, he is clearly not consistent nor comprehensive: \"The lists of Pliny, however, are evidently incomplete, especially as regards the province of Asia, where, except for the islands and Ilium, only the district of Caria seems to have been taken into consideration. There is no reason to suppose that Pergamum and Ephesus, which had obtained their freedom from the younger Servilius Isauricus, or Miletus, which had been recognized as independent in 39/8 BC, or even Phocaea, declared free by Pompey a decade earlier, had been deprived of this status\" [David Magie, Roman Rule in Asia Minor: To the End of the Third Century after ChristPrincetonUP:1950, vol 1, page 474]. And if Apamea was a reference to the city-with-the-district, then it would be inappropriate to refer to it by a city-only category.\n\nLets try Strabo next\n\nThree: Strabo's description of Syria\n\nStrabo gives a bit more information for us:\n\n[10] In (the district of) Apameia is a city (polis) well-fortified in almost every part. For it consists of a well-fortified hill, situated in a hollow plain, and almost surrounded by the Orontes, which, passing by a large lake in the neighbourhood, flows through wide-spread marshes and meadows of vast extent, affording pasture for cattle and horses. The city (polis) is thus securely situated, and received the name Cherrhonesus (or the peninsula) from the nature of its position. It is well supplied from a very large fertile tract of country, through which the Orontes flows with numerous windings. Seleucus Nicator, and succeeding kings, kept there five hundred elephants, and the greater part of their army.\n\nIt was formerly called Pella by the first Macedonians, because most of the soldiers of the Macedonian army had settled there; for Pella, the native place of Philip and Alexander, was held to be the metropolis (metropolis) of the Macedonians. Here also the soldiers were mustered, and the breed of horses kept up. There were in the royal stud more than thirty thousand brood mares and three hundred stallions. Here were employed colt-breakers, instructors in the method of fighting in heavy armour, and all who were paid to teach the arts of war.\n\nThe power Trypho, surnamed Diodotus, acquired is a proof of the influence of this place; for when he aimed at the empire of Syria, he made Apameia the centre of his operations. He was born at Casiana, a strong fortress in the Apameian district (τῆς Ἀπαμέων γῆς), and educated in Apameia; he was a favourite of the king and the persons about the court. When he attempted to effect a revolution in the state, he obtained his supplies from Apameia and from the neighbouring cities [ περιοικίδων: neighboring or dependent towns, not poleis], Larisa, Casiana, Megara, Apollonia, and others like them, all of which were reckoned to belong to the district of Apameia. He was proclaimed king (basileus) of this country (chora), and maintained his sovereignty for a long time. Cæcilius Bassus, at the head of two legions, caused Apameia to revolt, and was besieged by two large Roman armies, but his resistance was so vigorous and long that he only surrendered voluntarily and on his own conditions. For the country (chora) supplied his army with provisions, and a great many of the chiefs of the neighbouring tribes (ethnos) were his allies, who possessed strongholds, among which was Lysias, situated above the lake, near Apameia, Arethusa, belonging to Sampsiceramus and Iamblichus his son, chiefs of the tribe of the Emeseni. At no great distance were Heliopolis and Chalcis, which were subject to Ptolemy, son of Mennæus, who possessed the Massyas and the mountainous country of the Ituræans. Among the auxiliaries of Bassus was Alchædamnus, king of the Rhambæi, a tribe of the Nomades on this side of the Euphrates. He was a friend (philos) of the Romans, but, considering himself as having been unjustly treated by their governors, he retired to Mesopotamia, and then became a tributary of Bassus. Poseidonius the Stoic was a native of this place, a man of the most extensive learning among the philosophers of our times. \n\nThis description contributes several items:\n\n·Apamea is a district (ges) and a city (polis).\n\n·The district of Apamea had multiple fortresses (i.e. not just in the city Apamea).\n\n·Apamea was an educational center for the elite.\n\n·The Apamene district had at least 6 dependent towns in it.\n\nThis is very helpful, and is also decisive in identifying the city Apamea as in the privileged class of civites/polis under Rome. It hits multiple criteria of an independent city-state (i.e., polis, dependent cities, territory).\n\nFour: The L.

Julius Agrippa) individual had rights/exemptions accorded to him from Rome, recorded in Romes records.\n\n2.These same records recorded rights/exemptions from Rome extended to his ancestors.\n\n3.He was a from Apamea (hometown, native country), suggesting citizenship.\n\n4.Apamea was a city (polis) at the time of the inscription, with the standard features of a city: boule, grammaticus, other officials.\n\n5.He held several public and civic roles (some of which required citizenship):\n\na.Magistracies\n\nb.Liturgies\n\nc.Generosities\n\nd.Priest\n\ne.Agoranomos with generosity (e.g. wheat, oil, aqueduct)\n\nf.Secretary\n\n6.He demanded some authorization and appointed fellow magistrates (what can this mean in a polis?)\n\n7.Acted as embassy to emperor and to governors (provincial)\n\n8.His paternal and material ancestors were famous, generous, and included tetrarchs.\n\n9.Some of these ancestors had received royal honours (from what kings?)\n\n10.One of these honoured ancestors was Dexandros.\n\n11.Dexy was the first high-priest (of something) in the province (presumably Syria). [Note: I cannot see where he is described as an 'arch-priest' (i.e., high-priest) as others such as Millar maintain. ]\n\n12.Dexy was his great-grandfather.\n\n13.Dexy was listed by Augustus in the Capital bronze tablets as friend and ally of the Roman people (the standard foedus/covenant language of allied client kings).\n\n14.There were other honours given to his family in those tablets in Rome.\n\n15.Some of the excerpts were deposited in the records of Apamea.\n\nAnother inscription refers again to Agrippas ancestry:\n\nFor the safety of Emperor Nerva Trajan Caesar Augustus, conqueror of the Germans, conqueror of the Dacians. Lucius Julius Agrippa, son of Gaius of the Fabian tribe, with royal [basilikas] honours and ancestors [progonous] listed [anagegrammenous] on the bronze tablets on the Capitol as allies [summachous] of the Romans, with exemption from liturgies, having fulfilled [ektelesas] all his generosity to perfection, spontaneously, having bought at his own expenses the location and having founded the baths, the basilica in them, the porticoes in front of these buildings, with all their decorations and all their bronze works that are located there, dedicated those to his city [tei patridi, 'the'--not 'his'--fatherland, not polis--but 'hometown' implies 'his' anyway, without the personal pronoun], under Julius Bassus, consular provincial governor.\"\n\nObservations/notes:\n\n1.The individual is named in this inscription and is said to be of the Fabian tribe (a citizenshipnot biological connection).\n\n2.He has a Roman name, and is perhaps connected to M. Agrippa.\n\n3.His royal honors were listed in the Capitoline bronze tablets.\n\n4.This tablets also contained a record of his ancestors.\n\n5.His ancestors were recorded as allies of the Romans.\n\n6.His ancestors/family were exempted from liturgies.\n\n7.The building projects were dedicated to his fatherland (patridi).\n\n8.He was a native of and citizen of Apamea.\n\n9.Dexy is not named in this one.\n\nHere are some scholar comments on these documents (with my notes):\n\nBut to gain any real impression of the now lost city life of this region, we can best turn to a remarkable set of inscriptions from Apamea, the only one of all these cities where large-scale excavation has been carried out.
