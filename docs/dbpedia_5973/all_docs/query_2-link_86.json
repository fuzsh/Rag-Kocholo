To this end, it proposes a genealogy of myth whichstarts from the observation that the two terms were originally used as synonymous. By analyzing the ways in which the two terms relate to each other in the thinking of Presocratics, Plato and Aristotle, the paper argues that up to the fourth century BC no opposition between mythos and logos was stated and that not even in Aristotle is there an identification of myth with false discourse. This, in the end, is the result of the fact that their views of truth and reality enabled a plurality of programmes of truth to coexist next to one another.\n\n...” corresponded to the area that would later be covered by the term “logos.” 4 ... letter to Overbeck on the 4th of January 1888, a critique of a ... , then, does the difference lie? 4 Chiara Bottici ...\n\n22.

After presenting a typology of zetetic breakdowns in the dialogues, I identify norms of inquiry Plato believes all successful inquirers must satisfy. Satisfying these norms requires trust that philosophy will not harm but benefit inquirers overall. This trust cannot be secured by protreptic argument. Instead, it requires divine intervention—an extra-rational foundation for rational inquiry.\n\n... with their cries (17d1, 20e4, 21a5, 27b1, 27b5, 30c2, 30c3). Interruption by an ... .

Yet, although the affinities between Posidonius’ aetiological project and Peripatetic scientific quest seem clear enough, scholarship has not investigated so far whether Posidonius’ interest in meteorology entailed the adoption of changes in the orthodox Stoic physics. This is the ultimate purpose of this article. I aim to show that Posidonius incorporated important Peripatetic concepts into Stoic cosmology. The article is divided into two sections. The first section presents the analysis of recent scholarship regarding the core concepts of the physics of the Early Stoa. In the second one, I examine in detail four fragments of Posidonius (F 84/97a, F 93a, F 229, F 219 EK) and identify the consistent modifications that he adopted: a finitist cosmological model, absolute directions in space guiding elemental motion, active and passive elements bearing mutually contrasting qualities, and heat as the efficient cause of meteorological phenomena.\n\n..., 4).

I argue that Nietzsche’s view of Plato as the initiator of the “true world”—the world that must be overcome on Nietzsche’s valuation—and of Socrates as a proponent of logicality suffers from the same overly rationalistic thinking that Nietzsche himself impugns in Plato. To account for Nietzsche’s interest in setting up Plato as the origin of the system of thought he seeks to overcome, I analyze Nietzsche’s remarks on Plato’s Phaedo in the Birth of Tragedy.\n\n... to truth,” 4 and with the way in which this will serves as an ... reason and in the “triumph of optimism” (BT, ASC 4) extends across ... —Socrates interprets the dream differently.

To unify the diverging scholarly interpretations of this idea, this paper re-examines Proclus’ well-known definition of the three wholes in his Elements of Theology, analyses lesser-known arguments from his Platonic Theology, and discusses two examples of Proclus’ theorem from the Commentary on Plato’s Timaeus.\n\n... exists in the part’. 4 Proclus outlines these three types of whole as follows ... that pre-exists in its cause (ἐν τῷ αἰτίῳ προϋποστάν).

I provide an exegesis of Nietzsche’s own reflections on rhetoric and consider its actual deployment, arguing that Nietzsche’s rhetoric is often deliberately dissonant and oriented toward facilitating receptive effects. The aim, I suggest, is to shift politics of possibility—to alter what can and cannot be done and said politically. Dissonant rhetoric, rhetoric that marries aesthetic attunement with affective turbulence, helps to accomplish this end by shaping the way that rhetoric is received by audiences. I conclude by suggesting that Nietzsche’s rhetoric has implications for contemporary theory, shifting how we might view critical political engagement in the public sphere. Understood in this way, Nietzsche’s rhetoric provides a perhaps surprising model for a critically robust form of rhetoric.\n\n... to bracket questions of Nietzsche’s rhetoric from her analysis. 4 Analytic ... works to shift the politics of possibility.

Jensen Nietzsche’s Interpretation of Heraclitus in Its Historical Context\n\nabstract | view | rights & permissions\n\nThis paper aims to reexamine Nietzsche’s early interpretation of Heraclitus in an attempt to resolve some longstanding scholarly misconceptions. Rather than articulate similarities or delineate the lines of influence, this study engages Nietzsche’s interpretation itself in its historical setting, for the first time acknowledging the contextual framework in which he was working. This framework necessarily combines Nietzsche’s reading in philology, post-Kantian scientific naturalism, and of the romantic worldviews of Schopenhauer and Wagner. What emerges is not the acceptance of the metaphysical-flux doctrine so much as a natal form of his physiognomic theory ofperspectivism, a naturalistic and anti-teleological conception of flux, and a theory of justice as cosmodicy.\n\n..., the latter his Pater Seraphicus. 69 Now, Schopenhauer can be read as the proponent ... ” without acknowledging what Nietzsche himself actually understood by that label. 4 ... .
