Posidonius was a Greek philosopher born in 135 BC in Apamea, Syria. He studied under the Stoic philosopher Panaetius in Athens but later settled in Rhodes, where he established his own school. Posidonius embarked on voyages around the Mediterranean gathering scientific data. He observed tides in Spain that varied with the moon's phases and cycles. Among the Celts in Gaul, he studied their culture and druids, whom he saw as philosophers. Posidonius wrote works on geography, ocean currents, races, earthquakes and the moon's impact on tides, and calculated the circumference of the Earth.",
