        "text": "Truro was the name of a parliamentary constituency in Cornwall represented in the House of Commons of England and later of Great Britain from 1295 until 1800, then in the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918 and finally from 1950 to 1997. Until 1885 it was a parliamentary borough, electing two members of parliament (MPs) by the plurality-at-large system of election; the name was then transferred to the surrounding county constituency, which elected a single Member by the first past the post system. In 1997, although there had been no changes to its boundaries, it was renamed as Truro and St Austell, reflecting the fact that St Austell by then had a larger population than Truro.\n\n1950–1974: The Borough of Truro, the Urban District of St Austell, the Rural District of Truro except the parish of Gwennap, and in the Rural District of St Austell the parishes of Creed, Grampound, Roche, St Dennis, St Ewe, St Goran, St Mewan, St Michael Caerhays, and St Stephen-in-Brannel.\n\n1974–1983: The Boroughs of Truro, and St Austell with Fowey, the Rural District of Truro except the parish of Gwennap, and in the Rural District of St Austell the parishes of Creed, Grampound, Roche, St Dennis, St Ewe, St Goran, St Mewan, St Michael Caerhays, and St Stephen-in-Brannel.\n\n1983–1997: The District of Carrick wards of Boscawen, Chacewater, Feock, Kea, Kenwyn, Moresk, Newlyn, Perranzabuloe, Probus, Roseland, St Agnes, St Clement, Tregolls, and Trehaverne, and the Borough of Restormel wards of Crinnis, Mevagissey, Poltair, Rock, St Ewe, St Mewan, St Stephen-in-Brannel, Trevarna, and Treverbyn.\n\nThe constituency has existed in a number of different forms. The constituency of Truro, up until 1885 elected two members to parliament; this was reduced to one. In 1918 the constituency was abolished but it was recreated again in 1950.\n\nThe seat became a safe Lib Dem bet thanks to the popularity and eloquence of its former MP, David Penhaligon. His death in a car crash, aged only 42, robbed the House of Commons of one of its most independent-minded and pragmatic members. His successor, Matthew Taylor, held the seat comfortably from a by-election in 1987, and remained its MP after the name change in 1997.\n\nConstituency created (1295)\n\nParliament First member Second member 1358 John Hamely[1] 1386 John Tregoose Robert Clerk[2] 1388 (Feb) Henry Gourlyn John Tremayne[2] 1388 (Sep) John Tr...uran John Trebernet[2] 1390 (Jan) John Coke Walter Bloyowe[2] 1390 (Nov) 1391 John Urban Roger Juyl[2] 1393 Ralph Trenewith I Walter Bloyowe[2] 1394 1395 Richard Respryn Andrew Borlase[2] 1397 (Jan) John Trereise John Megre[2] 1397 (Sep) Nicholas Trenewith John Lawhire[2] 1399 Richard Carhorta Pascoe Polruddan[2] 1401 1402 Ralph Kayl John Trereise[2] 1404 (Jan) 1404 (Oct) 1406 Ralph Cardrewe Thomas Brunsham[2] 1407 1410 1411 Thomas Paderda William Colyn[2] 1413 (Feb) 1413 (May) John Chinals William Chamberlain[2] 1414 (Apr) 1414 (Nov) John Trereise William Trethake I[2] 1415 1416 (Mar) Peter Hayme William Moun[2] 1416 (Oct) 1417 John Megre Andrew Hirnans[2] 1419 John Trewint John Langedon[2] 1420 William Panter Robert Trenerth[2] 1421 (May) William Trethake II William Richard[2] 1421 (Dec) Robert Treage William Richard[2] 1422 John But 1425 John But 1467 Edward Aysshton 1510–1523 No names known 1529 Roger Corbet John Thomas 1536 ?Roger Corbet ? 1539 ? 1542 ? 1545 Francis Smith Robert Trencreke 1547 Robert Trencreke Nicholas Randall First Parliament of 1553 Nicholas Randall Thomas Roydon Second Parliament of 1553 John Methnes Parliament of 1554 William Iseham Thomas Duppa Parliament of 1554–1555 John Melhuish Thomas Roydon Parliament of 1555 Nicholas Randall Thomas Randall Parliament of 1558 Thomas Roydon Parliament of 1563–1567 John Carminow John Mitchell Parliament of 1571 Henry Killigrew Vincent Skinner Parliament of 1572–1581 Oliver Carminow Parliament of 1584–1585 Edward Darcy Michael Hicks Parliament of 1586–1587 John Stanhope Roland Lytton Parliament of 1588–1589 Hannibal Vyvyan John Woolton Parliament of 1593 John Parker Nicholas Smyth Parliament of 1597–1598 Maurice Berkeley Reade Stafford Parliament of 1601 William Daniel Thomas Harris Parliament of 1604–1611 Henry Cossen Thomas Burgess Addled Parliament (1614) Thomas Russell Thomas Burgess, junior Parliament of 1621–1622 Barnaby Gough, sat for Cambridge Univ.\n\nand replaced by Sir John Catcher[6] John Trefusis[7] Happy Parliament (1624) Richard Daniel Thomas Burgess Useless Parliament (1625) William Rous Henry Rolle Parliament of 1626 Francis Rous Parliament of 1628 Richard Daniel No Parliament summoned 1629–1640\n\nElection 1st member[8] 1st party 2nd member[8] 2nd party April 1640 Francis Rous Parliamentarian John Rolle Parliamentarian November 1640 November 1648 Rolle died – seat left vacant 1653 Truro was unrepresented in the Barebones Parliament 1654 Francis Rous Truro had only one seat in the First and\n\nSecond Parliaments of the Protectorate 1656 Walter Vincent January 1659 Charles Boscawen May 1659 Not represented in the restored Rump April 1660 Walter Vincent Edward Boscawen 1661 Nicholas Arundell 1666 John Arundell 1679 William Boscawen 1681 Henry Ashurst 1685 John Arundell Henry Vincent 1689 Sir Henry Ashurst, Bt 1690 John Cloberry 1695 Hugh Fortescue Whig March 1701 Sir John Hawles Whig December 1701 Sir William Scawen sat for Grampound February 1702 Sir Robert Cotton Tory July 1702 Thomas Powys November 1702 Sir Philip Meadowes May 1705 Hugh Boscawen Whig November 1705 Peregrine Bertie Whig May 1708 James Brydges[9] December 1708 Robert Furnese Whig 1710 Hugh Boscawen Whig 1713 Thomas Hare William Collier 1715 John Selwyn Spencer Cowper Whig 1721 Thomas Wyndham 1727 Hugh Boscawen Sidney Meadows 1734 Kelland Courtenay Robert Trefusis 1741 Charles Hamilton James Hammond 1742 Admiral the Hon.
