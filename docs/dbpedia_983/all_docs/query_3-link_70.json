        "text": "Joseph \"Joe\" Thomas Lough, 88, of the Meadowdale Community of Fairmont, passed away peacefully Tuesday (May 3, 2016) at Fairmont Regional Medical Center. He was born in Fairmont, on May 18, 1927, the only child of the late Harry Thomas Lough and Gusta (Stewart) Lough Lang. Joe proudly served his country in the United States Navy during World War II. He was a member of the VFW Local No. 7048. He retired from the Mold Repair Department of Owens-Illinois Glass Co. with 36 years of service. Joe and Melba enjoyed their retirement years by traveling around his West Virginia hills which he truly loved. He also enjoyed going to the surrounding states of Maryland, Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania, especially during springtime and autumn. Watching his grandchildren playing sports was also a special pastime for him. He lived life to the fullest and was a very happy man. Joe will be sadly missed by his wife and family and his many friends and acquaintances and his cat Twinker. He is survived by his loving wife of 64 years, Melba (Ellis) Lough; three daughters, Debbie Barker and her husband Kenny of White Hall, Patty Myers and her husband Jimmy of Washington, Pennsylvania, and Jeannie Rogers and her husband Jay of Fairmont; four very special grandchildren, Tyler Joseph Reid and his wife Amanda of Rivesville, Jaymie Dixon and her husband Ian of Virginia, Mason Myers and his wife Stephanie of Pennsylvania and Morgan Rogers of Fairmont; and three great-grandchildren, Lydia Grace Reid, Waylon Joseph Reid and Naomi Maria Dixon. Also surviving are his brother-in-law, Robert Ellis of Fairmont; his sister-in-law, Martha West and her husband Howard of Chestertown, Maryland; and several nieces and nephews and cousins. A special thanks to cousins Dale and Donna Zinn and John and Lois Layman and to all of his good Meadowdale neighbors who have been so helpful. Family and friends may call from 1-8 p.m. Friday and from 11 a.m.-1 p.m. Saturday at the Carpenter & Ford Funeral Home, 209 Merchant St., Fairmont. The funeral service will be held at 1 p.m. Saturday at the funeral home with the Rev. Donald Thomas officiating. Interment services will follow at the Mount Zion Cemetery.
