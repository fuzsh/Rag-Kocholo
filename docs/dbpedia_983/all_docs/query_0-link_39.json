TRANSCRIBED BY JENNIFER FORD, SPECIAL COLLECTIONS LIBRARIAN\n\nSaturday Night\n\nReport\n\nJanuary '74\n\nApril \"\n\nPreface 3\n\nOften have I tried to re-\n\ncall past events; or the time\n\nor circumstances connected with\n\nthe events but in vain because\n\nI had taken no special notice\n\nof them at the time, thinking that\n\nthey were of little importance.\n\nI have thought it would pleasant\n\nto read a brief account of ones\n\nown acts, thoughts, feelings, &c.\n\nyears after they had past. It\n\nseems that it would have a tenden\n\ncy to make one a closer observer\n\nof what is going on around him, if\n\nhe were in the habit of taking\n\nnotes of all that passes under his\n\nobservation. It seems one would\n\nbecome interested in writing some\n\nthing for himself only, to express\n\nhis thoughts in his own way perhaps\n\n4\n\nno other person would understand it\n\nat all, and yet prove a satisfaction\n\nto the author, after adversity had\n\n[illegible] his bright hopes, or pros-\n\nperity crowned his efforts with suc-\n\ncess. In consideration of all\n\nthese things I have determined\n\nto write something every Saturday\n\nnight about the events and time\n\nof the past week. This I will\n\ncall the Saturday Night Report.\n\nJohnson\n\n5\n\nJanuary 3rd 1874\n\nThe past week has been long\n\nand tiresome. Christmas dull.\n\nWas glad when Friday came\n\nwith duties of college to be\n\nresumed. I felt rather disappointed\n\nwhen Witherspoon & Miller returned\n\nwithout bringing any news about my\n\nmoney affairs; but was relieved\n\nwhen the five o'clock train brought\n\na letter with a Post Office\n\norder in it. Was too late for\n\nchapel Friday morning in consequence\n\nof it, but greatly gratified when\n\nI paid General Sears his long\n\nDue $28. Had my teeth plug-\n\nged Saturday morning and was\n\ndeprived of more of my money than\n\nI expected.\n\nJanuary 10\n\n6\n\nSunday was a very pleasant day\n\nfor the season, except that there\n\nwas sign of rain. Presbyterian\n\npreached in our church. In the\n\nevening the wind began to blow from\n\nthe North, which of course, made the\n\nair chilly. Monday there was some\n\nsnow and sleet. The same Tuesday,\n\nWednesday the sun shown out\n\nand and glistened through the\n\nicy covered trees and formed\n\nso may beautiful shades, glitters,\n\nand reflections, that it looked\n\nlike we were living in a Par-\n\nadise. Weather continuted to mod\n\nerate till Saturday when it\n\nseemed and felt like farmers\n\nought to be planting corn. Wed.\n\nwe were turned back in math\n\nemetics. Mon. Greek started\n\nspelling logarithm. I went to the\n\nsinging Saturday evening; determined\n\n7\n\nto go oftener. Saw the dumb man\n\non my return. We contemplate a\n\nplan by which we may better our\n\nway of baching. FS elected officers\n\nfor the Hermaen celebration.\n\nJanuary 17\n\nSunday we had a splendid lect-\n\nure from Dr. Garland, on the mir\n\nacles of the bible. The 11 o'clock\n\nsermon was good; showing that\n\nwe all have an influence which\n\nworks either for good or evil. Mon.\n\n& Tues were rainy days then the ground\n\nFroze which proved to us that winter\n\nWas not neglecting us after all. Wed.\n\n[Pope] turned us back into the [Satires].\n\nThu. we finished reviewing Mesuration\n\n& Trigonometry & Fri took up the [Sur]\n\nFriday night Kennedy brought me\n\nthree letters one from [H.M.] Bigham\n\none from M.A. Hicks, another from [Long.]\n\nAfter reading them I could scarce\n\n8\n\nly draw my mind off enough to\n\nfinish getting my old speech. Very\n\nanxious to get another from some\n\nbody to know for certain if [J.] K.\n\nBarmone is married, and whether\n\nAunt Lizzie is to marry next\n\nSunday week. I rather made\n\na [flot] this morning in FS. Stew\n\nart says I will have to come\n\nout if I get a speakers place.\n\nI think he is about right. E.E.\n\nBigger was delivering an excellent\n\nbimonthly oration when the dormi-\n\ntory took fire this morning. Ex-\n\npecting to interest myself writing\n\nto ma & Jimmy tomorrow. The\n\noil is out of my lamp; so I must\n\nquit writing. Tis now 11 o'clock.\n\nJan. 24\n\nSunday morning. I was too\n\nlate for Sabbath school. Heard\n\nmost of the lecture and determined\n\n9\n\nthat I would be in time\n\nnext Sunday. After school\n\nWiseman gave me my little\n\n[Daisy] and a letter from [Sank].\n\nNo preaching at the Prsbyterian\n\nchurch, consequently we had a\n\nlarge congregation at our church.\n\nDr. Wheat preached an excellent\n\nSermon John 7-17 \"If any man\n\nwill do his will, he shall know\n\nof the doctrine, whether it be of\n\nGod or whether I speak of my self.\"\n\nHe proved the divine mission of\n\nChrist by three evidences: External,\n\nInternal; and Experimental. Mon\n\nday and Tues. brought on their rotine\n\nof work. Wed I got a letter from\n\nUncle Jim Stating that shure\n\nenough Aunt Liz & St. Clair are\n\nto marry 4 Sunday. It had in it\n\nalso a P.O. order for $40- [illegible]\n\nfor my warrants, 10 from\n\n10\n\nLawrence. I went over in town\n\na 11 o'clock, got my money, and\n\nafter looking about some for\n\na suit of clothes finally bought\n\none from some Jews $20. Some\n\nwhat fear that I am cheated.\n\nThink hereafter I will offer\n\nonly about half what they ask.\n\nThu. we begin our review in Ana\n\nLytical. Johnson [kepet] us up in\n\nhis room the whole hour without\n\nany recitation or giving us any\n\nat all. Demerited\n\nseveral of us for applauding the\n\nringing of the bell, after being bored\n\nthere the whole hour. I consider\n\nthat either he or the faculty is\n\nmaking some [flats]; as well as\n\nourselves. How will we make\n\nit on the examination in Eng?\n\nour old Anal. Sounded very\n\nnatural Fri after our absence\n\n11\n\nof about three weeks. Did not\n\nsend me to the board as I expected\n\nLook Monday! first one in Greek\n\nwill be I & no doubt first in\n\nMath and not surprised if [illegible]\n\ncalls on me also. Singing this\n\nevening as usual few in attendance\n\non account of examination.\n\nJanuary the 31.\n\nI have been too busy this week\n\nto pay much attention to any thing\n\nexcept my books. Heard for a fact\n\nthat Barmone is married. Tom Wheat\n\nleft, they say, for Texas, last Wed\n\nnesday night. [Pafs] has excused\n\nus from two of the satires. I think\n\nI know why. Johnson's order is to\n\nwrite the examination with pen & ink.\n\nBefore another Saturday night comes\n\nwe will have passed the direful\n\nexamination in English. Will we\n\nall make the rise. I fear that\n\n12\n\nTunstall, Terry, Juny & some others\n\nwill not because they failed to give\n\nthe analysis. I have spent this\n\nmonth $77! Dont expect to\n\nspend that much from now till\n\nJune.\n\nFebraury 7\n\nI cant refrain from taking a few\n\nnotes on the excellent Sermon I have\n\njust heard (Sunday) Dr. Wheat's text\n\nmay be found in John 6-35 \"I\n\nam the bread of life.\" Jesus uttered\n\nthese words after he had performed one\n\nof his great miracles of supplying the\n\nmultitude with bread. This furnished\n\nhim an opportunity of illustrating\n\nhis mission. As bread which we eat\n\ngoes to the sustaining of the body\n\nhands, feet, and even the very rain\n\nof our head; so is Christ to the Chris-\n\ntians in all their words, thoughts,\n\nacts, and deeds. Is this so with\n\n13\n\nUs all? Is all we do and think\n\nand act in accordance with this holy\n\nprecepts? This is answered yes or\n\nno according as we are Christians\n\nor not. For us Chist was born, for us\n\nHe lived, for us He died, for us\n\nhe rose, for us he is now making\n\nintercessions at the right hand of\n\nGod. Tis not sufficient for the mortal\n\nbody, that food may be cooked and spread\n\non the table, that we look at it\n\nand see others enjoy it, that we seat\n\nourselves with them, and frame\n\nsome excuse for not enjoying the\n\nfeast. This will not do; not do. We\n\nmust actually partake of it. Neither\n\nis it sufficient for us to have a Bible\n\nin the house, to go to church, pay\n\nthe preacher, to partake of the blessed\n\nemblems of his sufferings and death\n\nThese to be sure must be done but\n\nthey are not the essential means by\n\n14\n\nwhich \"Christ is to us to bread\n\nof life\" No God bless you it it\n\nnot. The humble servant may eat\n\nof scraps from the masters feat, with\n\nout having tables set with fine [illegible]\n\nspread with white linen; Yes\n\nhe may take sparing morsel and\n\neat in secret; which nourishes his\n\nbody strengthens him for his mas\n\nters service. So may we eat of\n\nthe \"bread of life\"; not because we\n\nare dressed fine, because it is Sun-\n\nday, because it is in accordance\n\nwith formality. What then are the\n\nmeans of taking this bread of life? \"Believe\n\nin Jesus\" He is the bread of life.\n\nNo time now for writing in my\n\nreport; it is nearly 12 o'clock. I\n\nCame out better than I expected on\n\nmy Eng. Examination--94. Fear I\n\nwill flat on Greek. But will keep\n\n15\n\nTrying. Nothing more, ,\"I am tired\n\nNow and sleepy too.\"\n\nFeb. 14th\n\nWell I have heard from my\n\nGreek examination and by the\n\nWay I will just take down\n\nall of our names with the standings.\n\nSess Ex Aver Sess Ex Aver\n\nBingham 92 89 90.5 Juny 82 56 64 (66 crossed out)\n\nBailey 71 McCollum 86 50 62 (68 crossed out)\n\nDial 70 McIntosh 76 51 55 (63 crossed out)\n\nFoster 93 86 88 (89.5 crossed out) Nash 41\n\nGreenwood 98 96 97 Rives 96 93 94.4\n\nHouse 96 87 90 (91 Â½ crossed out) Trotter 53 63 59 (58 crossed out)\n\nIsom 76 51 59 (69 Â½ crossed out) Tunstall 89\n\nJohnson 85 91 89 (88 crossed out) Scott 86 93 90 (89 Â½ crossed out)\n\nLedbetter 87 70 75 (78 Â½ crossed out) Williamson 70 50 56 (60 crossed out)\n\nLester 74 62 66 (68 crossed out) Witherspoon 94 90 91 (92 crossed out)\n\nI am anxious to hear from\n\nMathematics. Would not risk the\n\nexamination over but do hate\n\nit for missing the first prop\n\n16\n\nosition. I think now I will\n\nnever forget that mensuration\n\nhas for it object the finding\n\nof areas; Trigonometry the so-\n\nlution of triangles--not with\n\nrespect to area. Before another\n\nSaturday night comes the long\n\nTrial for speakers place will be\n\nOver. Will I have a place?\n\nI am now a little perplexed be\n\nCause Pa does not pay Lankey\n\nDont know really what to do about it.\n\nI got my little pictures Tuesday\n\nnight. Dont think I will send for\n\nany more like them.\n\nFeb. 21st\n\nThe report was wrong about the first\n\nposition. We got that all right but\n\nmissed it, putting \"sine\" where I\n\nshould have said \"chord.\" Well I\n\ngot a speakers place but do not expect\n\nto use it.

I did as well\n\nas I expected in FS this morning\n\nMar. 21\n\nIt has been raining all the week.\n\nThe trees are budding out as\n\nIf we were going to have an\n\nEarly spring. I rec a letter\n\nFrom Ma Monday. Am anxious\n\nNow to get one from Hale.\n\nI have had the headache all\n\nday to day very unusual for me\n\nmust be in consequence of so much\n\ninclement weather.\n\nMar. 28\n\nWe are having more rain than\n\nany thing else these days. We think\n\nof quitting our baching soon.\n\n23\n\nApril 4.\n\nStill plenty of rain hard\n\n[sudy] and obliged to bach.\n\nJ.J. Hueston & Nash quit\n\ncollege this week. We are\n\nanxious to quit baching as\n\nsoon as Plant gets back\n\nApril 11\n\nPlant still has not started\n\nsurely he will be back before\n\nthis time next Saturday night.\n\nSo much rain finally termin-\n\nated in snow last Thursday.\n\nWe began Horace again last\n\nWednesday. Latin prose Friday be\n\nfore. It seems to me like\n\nit will be a hard matter for\n\nme to make respectable ex\n\namination & leave by the 5th of June.\n\nI do hope the Old General will turn\n\nus back in a few days. It\n\nseems that my letters cant go to Pontotoc\n\nSecond Quarter quine of\n\n\"Saturday Night Report\n\nApril '74\n\nOctober \"\n\nApril 18th\n\nWe were disappointed in get-\n\nting any money from Union County\n\nand so we concluded to quit bach-\n\ning any how. Began boarding this morn-\n\ning with Mr. [Gambrel]. Shall I ever\n\nforget my disappointment which be-\n\nfell me last Sunday eve? May the\n\nblessed virgin never catch a worse\n\nbeau than myself. Next time I of-\n\nfer my services to a young lady for\n\naccommodation's sake I will be sure that\n\nmy offer will be gladly accepted. Gen.\n\nSears has been sick two or three days\n\nI think he will turn us back in\n\na few days. Still raining, surely\n\nI never saw so much.\n\nApril 25.\n\nSure enough Old Gen. turned us\n\nback last Wed. Glory! Boarding is\n\nvery much more pleasant than baching\n\nAs I have been excused from the So\n\n2\n\nciety I try to make up my examina\n\ntions all right. However I have made\n\na very poor start this evening spending\n\nthe whole afternoon in looking at the\n\nR.R. hands---I have one more ev-\n\nidence of the fact we often change\n\na friend to an enemy in trying to\n\ndo something which we think will please\n\nor benefit him.\n\nMay the 2nd\n\nThe weather has been very pleasant\n\nThis week for both mental and phys-\n\nical labor. May it remain so. I took\n\ndinner last Sunday at Mrs. Murrey's\n\nWell pleased with the apprearance of things\n\nThere. Miss Newell made my watch\n\nPocket in exchange for the ribbon. I\n\nthink it is a beauty, and that its maker\n\nmeans business at whatever she un-\n\ndertakes. Adams left Wed. eve.\n\nPoor old Ad Brown in penitentiary\n\nfor 20 years! Never will forget the\n\nparting scene.\n\nMay\n\n[Bro.] Johnson's Freshmen reflected\n\nhonor on themselves, and also on him\n\nin their performance this afternoon.\n\nMay 9\n\nWe had no preaching last Sunday as\n\nDr. Wheat was in St. Louis. I went\n\nTo the P-church and [Newell] came home\n\nwith me. No Greek Mon. Led thought\n\nwe would have to recite it Tuesday\n\nalthough it was the Anniversary!\n\nWe passed the day very well. I dont\n\nthink the speech pleased Dr. Waddel. McIn-\n\ntosh's Temperance meeting seemed to\n\nbe rather a failure. I shall not join\n\nthis year! probably never. We are\n\nembarrassed about our money, from\n\nUnion County. I am a little afraid\n\nwe will have to leave Oxford before\n\nwe pay all we owe. I am now on a [stand]\n\nto know what to do about standing for the\n\nprize in math. Our time will not be\n\nfully occupied, till Dr. Wheat gets back.\n\nThe Seniors did not seem to inter-\n\nest the crowd this morning. I suppose\n\nJohnson will make use of this as an\n\nopportunity of complimenting his pet\n\nFreshmen. Sexton left us last\n\nThu. I wish him well, but dont\n\nthink I would approve of his resting\n\none month. Before this time next\n\nSaturday night we will know who is\n\nElected for the next Anniversalian.\n\nI am for Bigger staight out!\n\nMay 16\n\nYes Bigger is elected by a ma-\n\njority of only three! I think\n\nnow we ought to elect Green for\n\nValedictorian for next year. My\n\nexaminations are bothering me now\n\nI fear I cant get 90 all round.\n\nJimmy Lawrence stayed all night\n\nwith me Wednesday night. Jo-\n\nseph Gambrel brought our money\n\nfrom Union Co. at last. Rive's\n\nbimonthly was splendid this morn-\n\ning. I think he will stand a very\n\ngood chance for Anniversalian next\n\nyear.\n\nMay 23\n\nMcIntoshes Temperance\n\nHas a very good start now\n\nI hope it will succeed in\n\ndoing good but I greatly\n\nfear it will help to make\n\nMc loose the rise. My\n\nLatin examination is now\n\nover and by this time next\n\nSaturday night my Greek\n\n& Mathematics will be\n\nover. I am too busy and\n\ntoo much bothered to\n\nwrite now.\n\nMay 30\n\nWell, well, flat in Mathemat\n\nics. I just know I made\n\nthe biggest flat that I ever\n\npretended to make since I\n\nhave been in College. I dont\n\nknow what to do. I would\n\nlike to stand it over, but\n\nnow I know I have not time.\n\nTuesday I had my hateful\n\nold tooth pulled. That may\n\nhave been a part of the cause\n\nof my flat. I know it bother-\n\ned me the day & night before.\n\nI shall always feel grateful\n\nto Mrs. Gambrel and family\n\nfor the kindness they showed\n\nme that evening and night so\n\nmiserable to me. It has\n\nbeen about a month since\n\nit rained. I think I never\n\nsaw such a spring, so un-\n\nfavorable for work. Perhaps\n\nthe farmers will get their\n\ncrops clean. I would much\n\nrather have a dry May than\n\na dry June. Well it is not\n\nworth while to grieve over my\n\nflat, in fact I have not time\n\nnow I shall just do the best I\n\ncan in the future. I have\n\nlost all hopes of making 90\n\nall round now, or of being\n\none of the first five in the class.\n\nI shall try my best I think\n\nTo go through the Greek &\n\nLatin compositions by the first\n\nof Aug. I hope to be with\n\nmy old school friends by this\n\ntime next week.\n\nJune the 6th\n\nYes I am at Mr. Purvine's\n\nto night tired enough. I\n\nleft Oxford yesterday at\n\n1 o'clock, at 6 we had gone\n\nJust six miles. I would\n\nmuch rather walk than to\n\nride on a heavy loaded ox\n\nwagon We traveled on till\n\n8 and I slept on the bare\n\nGround covered with my\n\nshall started quarter before 4 & got to Lafayette Springs\n\nat 9 there I left my trunk\n\nand proceeded on foot.\n\nMy examinations are now over\n\nall except French. I hope\n\nthat will not be much I might\n\nhave stood French also if I\n\nhad known that the wagon\n\nwould not get off till 1\n\nThey told me it would leave\n\nat 9. I fear the school will\n\nbe very small. Mr. Purvine\n\nsays, however, he will send\n\nhis two girls.\n\nJune 13\n\nOne week is gone already.\n\nvery little study done yet.\n\nHicks scared me all over\n\nSunday when he told me that\n\nHe thought it would be im\n\npossible to start the school\n\nunder two weeks. It would\n\nhave been too big a flat to\n\nhave just lost two weeks\n\nwhen I had made such\n\nsacrifice in Oxford to\n\nget off. Monday I had only\n\n9, some increase every day\n\nFriday I had 16. Think\n\nI will have twenty next\n\nweek. How I was shocked\n\nto hear that Barmone had\n\nstolen a horse! I did think\n\nthe boy would take warning.\n\nJune 20\n\nNo 20 came in; we had a nice\n\nrain last Mon and all have\n\nbeen busy at work. I think\n\nwe stand a chance for a fair\n\ncrop yet. I could not get\n\na horse to ride to see Grandpa\n\nthis morning. I fear the old\n\nfellow will think hard of me\n\nPerhaps it will suit me\n\nbetter for several reasons to\n\ngo next Saturday. I hope to see\n\nWitherspoon & Miller, and also\n\nMiss Ellen at church on Sunday.\n\nHow I long for Saturday to come!\n\nI am doing well with my\n\nstudies, hope I will be able\n\nto come up to my expectations.\n\nI must record the day that I\n\nfirst saw Miss [Dinkey] Newell\n\nfor I must acknowledge she struck\n\nme with more than common admiration.\n\nIt was June the 14 at Oak Forest.\n\nJune 27th\n\nNo more new scholars yet it\n\nfrets me to think how I will be\n\ncrowded with the little brats, now\n\nsoon when my time ought to\n\nbe occupied with the larger ones.\n\nI failed to see Witherspoon &\n\nMiller. Am very anxious to\n\nhear from Oxford. I received\n\nmy paper from Craig this week.\n\nAlso a copy of the Southern Home\n\nstead. I find Grandpa's folks\n\nall well this evening.\n\nJuly 4\n\nI did get to see Miss Ellen\n\nbut that was all, did not speak\n\nto her. J.R. Graves preached\n\nSunday. I could enjoy my-\n\nself better some other time when\n\nthere is not such a crowd.\n\nI have been teaching now just\n\na month. My school aver-\n\naged 15 11/20 I hope I will have\n\nan arbor to teach under be\n\nfore this time next month.\n\nTis very dry again in this\n\nNeighborhood, very little rain\n\nsince the 15th of June.\n\nWe have been watching a Comet\n\nthis week 'Tis a little West\n\nof North seems to be about\n\n15Â° high probably falling.\n\nJuly 11\n\nMoon preached a very\n\nsermon last Sunday. I\n\nheard at church that Dr.\n\nWaddel and four other pro-\n\nfessors had withdrawn from\n\nthe University I am so\n\nanxious to know about it.\n\nI fear that there will be\n\na general confusion and\n\ndisturbance of the school.\n\nI do want to go back\n\nif there is any possible\n\nchance. My school has in-\n\ncreased to 30 this week.\n\nI expect more next week.\n\nThe Comet seems to be low-\n\nerring. I think it will be out\n\nsight this time next week.\n\nJuly 18\n\nRev. Gailyard preached us\n\na good sermon last Sabbath\n\nand again took up his collection.\n\nI did as I intended talk to\n\nMiss Mittie Gregory, a little\n\nwhile. Think I shall do\n\nso again. I want to\n\nmake it a point to talk\n\nto the ladies in preference\n\nto the men from now on.\n\nAfter getting my dinner at\n\nMont's I came over to\n\nWile's to see Miss Mary Jer-\n\nnigan. And, as I was of-\n\nfered a horse by Mr. Hue\n\nBell, had the pleasure of see-\n\ning Miss Mary a part of the\n\nway home. And, behold\n\nI saw her catch a fall by\n\nriding into a [ving] bush. She\n\ndenies being hurt; but, un-\n\nless she fared better than\n\nher hat did, she is hurt/\n\nI like her appearance very\n\nwell, for the first sight.\n\nMonday evening I received\n\nMy long-wish-for letter from\n\nLedbetter. It contains only a part\n\nof a report. I see, as I know\n\nI would have to see that there is\n\nno chance for 90 all round. It\n\nmight be better for me to try my\n\nMathematics again. But I dont\n\nexpect to do it. I shall keep\n\ntrying to read some in my\n\nLatin & Greek. I will in-\n\nsert my piece of report on\n\nthe next page. I may want\n\nto refer to it some day. But not\n\nsoon. I had 46 schol-\n\nars Thursday. Lawrence tells\n\nme that there is no chance for\n\nan assistant to get pay from\n\nthe county. I fear I will\n\nbe worse bothered next fall\n\nto get to Oxford than I\n\nhave ever been. Warrants are\n\nworth only 60 cts. I feel very\n\nmuch disheartened in trying\n\nto make money in such a\n\nway.\n\nJuly 25\n\nI heard Rev. D.C.M. Bingham\n\npreach last Sunday. I liked\n\nhis discourse very well. Text\n\n\"To day if ye hear his voice harden\n\nnot your hearts.\" I enjoyed\n\nmyself very well in the buggy\n\nride with Miss Mary Ann. Hope\n\nI may have the pleasure again\n\nI failed in getting an assist-\n\nant from the county. I have\n\nbeen trying to day to make\n\nup $10 00 for Milly to help me\n\nIt seems quite a task. [We]\n\nare suffering in flat woods for\n\nrain. the last good rain\n\nwas on the 15th of June.\n\nAugust 1st '74\n\nI have finished my Greek &\n\nLatin Composition. Had to omit\n\nthe translation of a few lessons\n\nbefore I got through. Old\n\nMrs. Jernigan was buried\n\nthis evening. Friday morning\n\nwas the coolest, I think I\n\nhave ever felt for this time\n\nof the year. 'Tis in contrast\n\nwith some days last week\n\nwhich, I think, were un-\n\ndoubtedly the warmest\n\nI have ever felt. Tuesday\n\nI had to whip Joseph &Will\n\ndo hope they will do better\n\nfor a while.\n\nAug 8th\n\nI am bothered about my school.\n\nIt seems like that a subscrip\n\ntion school will be worth nothing.\n\nMy notion is that stopping the\n\nSchools is just an arbitrary\n\nnotion of Lawrence and the\n\nSupervisors. I hear much\n\nTalk of the Singing Convention\n\nWill try to go over tomor-\n\nrow.. I find Grandpa & fam-\n\nily well as common.\n\nAug 15\n\nSo I went to the convention\n\nsaw many of my old friends,\n\nand heard some excellent sing-\n\ning. I do not admire the\n\n'fa sol la' system. I did not\n\nget to speak to Miss Ellen at\n\nlast but I think I will\n\n[illegible] and speak to her yet.\n\nAug 22\n\nMy school lacks now only\n\none week of being out. I\n\nshall try my best to have the\n\nthe Free School continued not\n\nbecause I think the pay is good\n\nbut because I have begun\n\nwith it intending to teach 4\n\nmonths and I want to carry\n\nout my plans. I met up\n\nwith Mr. Bigham in town\n\nand went home with him\n\nlast Saturday; went to church\n\nwith Miss Mary Ann, and\n\nsaw to my surprise and\n\nsatisfaction Miss Newell\n\nGambrel. The chaps have\n\ntorn my my demerit book\n\nso much that I will leave\n\nit at home for a while and\n\ntry putting the demerits\n\non their backs\n\nAug. 29\n\nMy school is out now I dont\n\nknow whether I can get it star-\n\nted again or not. I dont like\n\nto be in such a fix. I\n\nfind Uncle John & family well\n\nexcept Arther. He is trying to\n\nhave chills or something of the sort.\n\nI will feel better if I can\n\nget my scholarship warrant\n\nissued Monday.\n\nSeptember 5th\n\nWell I have been teaching again\n\nthis week. I dont know that\n\nI can ever get any pay for\n\nit. I will teach any way\n\nand then try to get my pay.\n\nI probably could go on again\n\nto Oxford with what I have\n\nbut would do much better with\n\na little more money. The Super-\n\nvisors gave me my warrant very\n\nreadily. Ab was bitten to day by\n\na spider or something else, which\n\nmade him very sick for a while.\n\nSept. 12\n\nMy school has been going on very\n\nwell this week. I dismissed on\n\nThursday to go to Mr. Bigham's\n\n[illegible]: I arrived in time and\n\nafter I got started I never en-\n\njoyed the company of ladies better in\n\nlife. I hope I will have the pleas\n\nure of meeting Miss Amelia Word again\n\nsome time and see if she has kept\n\nher word. I think Mr. Bigham has\n\na fortune in the selection of his\n\nwife. Would that I could meet\n\nwith her sister, Miss Florance.\n\nSept 19\n\nThis has been a long weary\n\nweek. I had to teach to day to\n\nmake up for last Friday. I ex-\n\npect a small school from now on.\n\nPerhaps I can study a little\n\nbetter. I have done nearly nothing\n\nat it for the last 6 or 8 weeks.\n\nMy school averaged the first month\n\n[illegible], second 40, 3rd 45. Only 3 more\n\nweeks now till I expect to return\n\nto old Oxford, where I will have another\n\nlong siege of study and baching.\n\nSept 26\n\nI have been much confused this\n\nweek by hearing that Hicks had chang-\n\ned his notion and wants my school\n\nto stop. Hope however as he\n\ndid not come to see me yesterday\n\nthat I can teach on yet. Our\n\nteacher's convention met in Pontotoc\n\nto day Little done. I am at\n\nLawrence's to night expect to go\n\nback tomorrow. I must try to\n\nsustain my school.\n\nOct 3rd\n\nSure enough my treacherous\n\nfriend, Hicks, defeated me in the\n\nschool by riding around to see\n\nall the patrons. Policy prevents me\n\nfrom doing any thing in way of revenge\n\nThird Quarter of\n\nSaturday Night Report\n\nOct '74-75\n\nTo March 27 '75\n\nOct 10\n\nThis finds me again at old\n\nOxford. I could not borrow\n\nmoney, to come on nor sell\n\nwarrants above 60 cts Gave\n\nBell nearly 15 % premium to\n\nexchange his State warrants\n\nfor my school warrants.\n\nProf. Quinche has loaned me\n\n$50 00 without interest.\n\nStewart arrived this evening\n\nbut says he expects to board with\n\nMajor Estelle so that I\n\nwill probably be alone baching\n\nagain. Tom Wheat is at\n\nhome again.\n\nOct. 17\n\nI have been sick this week\n\nwith a cold, and baching went\n\nhard with me. So much so that\n\nI went to Mrs. Wilborne's yester-\n\nday morning and engaged board\n\nI would rather work several\n\nmonths after I get through than\n\nto \"bach\" this winter again.\n\nStewart has gone to board in\n\ntown, so that I am alone a-\n\ngain.\n\nOct 24 & 31\n\nI have felt much better this\n\nweek, since I have been boarding.\n\nSmith A.N.W. arrived last Sunday\n\nMorning, and has bought Stewart\n\nOut, so that I have a room-\n\nmate again. I have some hope\n\nnow that I will get my board\n\nsome cheaper, if I can be of any\n\nhelp to Mrs. Wilborn. We had\n\na light frost on the night of the\n\n28th of September, at Mr. Purvines,\n\nthen at Oxford we had another\n\nbut not a killing frost- the\n\n12 of Oct Heavy frost 31st of Oct.\n\nThe meeting in Oxford is still\n\nin progress and I think it\n\nhas done great good. I am\n\nnow on a stand to know what\n\nto do about money. I dont\n\nwant to borrow, and yet I\n\nknow that I need it, because\n\ncertainly I dress the plainest\n\nof any of the Junior class.\n\nNov 7\n\nWe have just got good to work\n\nnow in our Junior Class. Little\n\nchange is going on It seems that\n\nall my friends have forsaken in wri-\n\nting. Gen. Stewart is to be in-\n\naugurated next Tuesday. I am\n\ngetting tired of that work we\n\nhave to do for the society.\n\nNov 14\n\nGen Stewart gave us his inau-\n\ngural address last Tuesday. It\n\nwas plain & practical rather than\n\nvain and showy. Col. Lamar\n\ndelivered an address welcoming\n\nGen. Stewart to the position\n\nin behalf of the people. I must\n\nmention the swindler who payed the\n\ntown of Oxford a visit to day. I\n\nsimply saw the lesson repeated which\n\nI have long known, i.e. never spend\n\nany money on another man's tricks.\n\nNov. 21\n\nWe have had a very good weeks\n\nwork. Dr. Lyon started to his\n\nchurch's Synod last Wednesday.\n\nWe again had to day the pleasure of\n\nhearing the gifted Lamar, pouring\n\nforth his mighty strains of eloquence\n\nfor two hours. He mentioned his\n\nfriend Flourney who spoke against\n\nhim two years ago.\n\nNov 28\n\nDr. Garland started to Con-\n\nference at Aberdeen last Mon-\n\nday. We finished electricity\n\nand began in Mechanics last\n\nMonday. I saw Uncle John in\n\nOxford Thursday which was our\n\nholliday. He told me that Un-\n\ncle Jim White died on the 13 inst. re-\n\nceived a letter from Ma also\n\nthis morning stating the death\n\nof Uncle Jim.\n\nDec 5\n\nWe recited to Dr. Garland Wed instead\n\nOf to Dr. Juney. We will not study\n\nFrench any more till we get through\n\nwith Chemistry and Dr. Garland starts\n\nto Europe. I am very anxious to\n\nhear whether Uncle Jim can lend\n\nme any money. I was much sur-\n\nprised to know this morning\n\nthat I was elected President of\n\nFS. Can I make and deliver an\n\nInaugural address? Time will show.\n\nI will try.\n\nDec 12\n\nColonel Pegues was buried last\n\nTuesday. The faculty dismissed\n\nall the exercises which gave me\n\na better chance to work on my in-\n\naugural. I did as well with\n\nmy speech as I could expect.\n\nSeveral of the boys complimented me\n\nhighly. I shall do all I can to for-\n\nward the FS cause. I think Uncle\n\nJim ought to write to me; and\n\nlet me know whether or not he\n\nwill let me have some money.\n\nDec 19\n\nThe boys are anticipating Christ-\n\nmas. As to myself I expect\n\nto have a feast of reading. Some\n\nof my friends may come after me,\n\nbut I hardly expect it. The\n\nFS's adjourned this morning\n\ncontrary to my will. All delib-\n\nerative assemblies have the right\n\nto appeal fro the decision of the President\n\nDec 26\n\nI have undergone a considerable\n\nchange since last Saturday, as\n\nto how I will spend my Christ-\n\nmas. Prof. Johnson offered me\n\nlast Wednesday an agency to\n\nsell \"Personal Reminiscences of\n\nGen. Robert E. Lee.\" I have now\n\nAbout 18 subscribers. Johnson\n\nSays I will get 30 pr ct.\n\nI look for my canvassing [book]\n\nand other information concern-\n\ning it Monday next. Christ-\n\nmas is somewhat dull. Most\n\nof the boys have gone home. I\n\nwent to a sociable at Mrs\n\nMacie's Tuesday night, and to\n\nanother Friday night at Mrs. Simmons.\n\nJan. 2, 1875\n\nWell Christmas has come and\n\ngone. We must go to work\n\nMonday. Several of the boys\n\nhave returned. My canvassing\n\nbook came last Sunday. I\n\nsee now that I can make\n\nabout 66 2/3 pr cent on the invest\n\nment of the books. I have\n\nnot had much luck this week\n\nselling. I have only about 23\n\nnames in all. Times are too\n\nhard. Uncle Jim still\n\nneglects to write. He certainly\n\nnever rec'd my letter or else\n\nhe does not wish to let me have\n\nthe money. Perhaps I will get\n\nmy money from Union Co. when\n\nMr. Davis returns. However I\n\nlittle expect it since I have\n\nhad to wait so often. Mr.\n\nMcLeod says he will take my\n\nState warrants to Jackson for\n\nMe; thinks he can get the\n\ncash. How much I will be obliged\n\nto him!\n\nJan 9\n\nIn looking back over this I\n\nsee blots on nearly every page.\n\nCan I not do better? And\n\nwrite more neatly? We have\n\nhad regular work this week\n\nSome few of the boys will not\n\nReturn. We have had an\n\nawful cold day. Dr. King in\n\nOxford says that it has been\n\ncolder to day than it has been\n\nsince '56. The thermometer\n\nhas been from 8 to 9 Fa. All\n\nday. Jan 16\n\nThe thermometer was down\n\nto 4 F last Sunday. Very\n\ncold all this week. I now\n\nhave great hopes of getting\n\nthe cash for my state war-\n\nrants when Mr. McLeod re-\n\nturns from Jackson. He told\n\nthis morning that he would\n\nstart Tuesday. I would\n\nbe so glad if I could get\n\nthe money and send for my books.\n\nI am at Cousin Joe Johnson's\n\nto night. We will begin\n\nreview in Electricity Monday.\n\nJan 23\n\nSaturday night has again\n\ncome, but no money for me\n\nyet. My warrants could not\n\nbe paid notwithstanding the\n\nTreasurer wrote to me himself\n\nthat he would be ready by\n\nthe 15. I came to Oxford\n\nwith only one dollar and have\n\nnever got a cent since except\n\nas I borrow. Surely I will\n\neither hear something, or get\n\nsome money from my Union\n\nCo. scholarship, before an other\n\nSaturday night. I have been\n\nLooking every day for more than a month\n\nDr. Quinche is, in the true\n\nsense of the word, my friend\n\nin this time of need. This\n\nmorning he let me have 70 dol-\n\nlars to send for my books.\n\nI think I will lift one\n\nor the other of my notes before\n\nnext Saturday night. We\n\nwill finish Our Eng. book\n\nin two lessons more. I\n\nfear we will make a bad\n\nwork in it on Examination.\n\nIt bores me, in spite of my\n\nefforts to enjoy it. Uncle\n\nJim still neglects to write to\n\nMe. Shurely he never got\n\nmy letter in Nov. We have\n\nhad a pretty spell of weather\n\nthis week. Spring is coming.\n\nJanuary 30\n\nWe had a call meeting of FS.\n\nthis morning and accepted\n\nthe donation offered our library.\n\nI have my books all in\n\nsafety now I think except\n\none. Perhaps I will keep it.\n\n[three] let them fall back on\n\nme, but I sold them again.\n\nif I collect closely I will\n\nhave made clear of all ex-\n\npenses about $38.35 Quite\n\na help to me now while money\n\nis so hard for me to get.\n\nCraig has deceived me, and\n\nhas gone to Mrs. McMayhan's\n\nto board. It is poorly worth\n\nwhile to believe what many per-\n\nsons say. It seems that those\n\nwith whom I take the greater pains\n\nin trying to get to board with\n\nMrs. Wilborn; are the very ones\n\nLeast apt to go, and then again\n\nThey work \"vice versa.\" Such is the\n\nworld. It seems that [Wiatt]\n\nis determined to leave college.\n\nAs he has begun to think he ought\n\nto go on. I know, however,\n\nit never would have suited\n\nme to begin boarding with any\n\nfamily without paying for\n\nmy board. Perhaps it would\n\nbe different if I were a preach-\n\ner. No money come to me yet.\n\nHow many \"Saturday Nights\"\n\nwill I record without money. I\n\nam now thinking of going to\n\nHolly Springs the 17 to sell\n\nmy book. I would be sat-\n\nisfied if I could just make\n\nenough to pay my expenses.\n\nFebruary 6\n\nOur recitations will now\n\nbe stopped two weeks during\n\nthe examinations. How are we\n\nto make \"the rise.\" The boys\n\nsay that I will get the 5\n\nspeaker's place. I dont know\n\nmy-self. 'Tis better than I\n\nexpected when I left here\n\nlast June. I thought all the\n\nclass would beat me. I do know\n\nthat my standing would have been\n\nbetter could I have remained\n\nlast year, and the year before,\n\ntill the regular time for\n\nexaminations. I dont know that\n\nI can remain this year though\n\nI would much prefer it. Mrs.\n\nWilbourne left Monday to go to her sick\n\nson. Thursday night I had high\n\nfever for my first time in college.\n\nI hope it will prove to be nothing\n\nmore than cold. My throat us sire\n\nto night. I shall try the experiment\n\nof putting a wet sock around my neck.\n\nNo money comes yet, from any source.\n\nI sent Uncle Jim another letter Tuesday\n\nI believe he thinks it rather a sorry invest-\n\nment to lend me money. I\n\ndo think \"deo volente,\" that when\n\nI get out of this jail of a college\n\nI will try to rid myself of money\n\nembarrassments and live less depedent.\n\nI have been in cone continual press ever\n\nsince I entered college, embarrassed\n\nwhen in company for the want of clothes\n\nsuitable to the occasion. I have not\n\nyet determined whether to go to Holly Springs\n\nMust decide before next \"Saturday\n\nNight\" is written. Three examinations\n\nmust also be passed before Saturday\n\nnight. I will record some perhaps\n\non the opposite page would that I could see them now\n\nFeb 13.\n\nI have received $85 dollars this\n\nweek which has greatly relieved me.\n\nI paid Dr. Quinche $50 last\n\nWednesday.

Twas on the ground when\n\nwe waked, and nearly all gone again\n\nwhen we retired. I have been\n\nanxiously expecting to hear something\n\nfrom Mr. Jarvis. I am a little\n\nafraid that he will not get my\n\nletter. I sent of $55.00 for\n\nmy second bill of books this morning.\n\nWill risk them by freight this time\n\nExpect to be in Holly Springs\n\nagain in two weeks from this\n\ntime. But Oh! the study in Chem\n\nistry before that time.\n\nMarch 20\n\nI still hear nothing from\n\nJarvis. I wrote to R.F.\n\nJarvis this morning. My\n\nbooks were received safely\n\nthis evening, all safe & sat-\n\nisfactory. The man did not\n\nsend me a copy of Seward's\n\nTravels around the World. Per-\n\nhaps he will send it as he\n\nsays by mail, but I doubt\n\nit. Our examination in Chem-\n\nistry will be next Thursday.\n\nHow will I make it? Next\n\nSaturday night I may be in Holly\n\nSprings--Oh! this makes me think\n\nof death. I heard yesterday\n\nthat Millie Jernigan was dead.\n\nWhose time is next? Her father &\n\nMother are both living, one grand-\n\nfather & mother and her father's\n\nmother was only buried last\n\nsummer. \"Death with equal\n\npace and impartial fate, knocks\n\nat the palace and cottage gate.\"\n\nHer family seemed to be long-lifed,\n\nand she, I thought, was a girl\n\nof the strongest constitution. But oh!\n\nshe was \"as the flower of the grass, in\n\nthe morning it flourisheth, in the\n\nevening it is cut down and withereth\"\n\nHer letter to me was dated the 19th\n\nFeb. last thing she said was that\n\nshe hoped soon to get an answer. But\n\nit is not answered, nor can it ever be.\n\nMarch 27\n\nI have succeeded upon the\n\nwhole as well as I expected\n\nin delivering my books in\n\nHolly Springs. I finished\n\ndelivering this evening, after the\n\ntrain had been gone about a half\n\nhour. In all, now, I have dis-\n\ntributed 52 books, and made\n\nabout $52 clear of all expense,\n\nand have a nice copy myself,\n\nbeside the canvassing book. I\n\ndont expect to sell any more before\n\nnext fall. I shall claim my\n\nsuit & trunk, which cost $40, as\n\nmy returns for selling books. The\n\nother $12 may go to my general\n\nexpense. Mch. 30 My money matters have been\n\neasy since my warrants were cashed\n\nI can see my way through this year\n\nI have received this college year, $275 Â½,\n\nBeside what I have made with my\n\nagency. I now have $95 counting\n\nStewarts note of $45 and board paid\n\nfor about a month. I still hear\n\nnothing from Jarvis. It seems that I\n\nwill have to pay that $20 again, which\n\nwill again put me in a strain for money,\n\ntill Christmas perhaps for it seems impossible\n\nfor me to get money early in the fall\n\n4th Quarter\n\nSaturday Night Report\n\nApril '75 &\n\nJune \"\"\n\nApril 3rd\n\nI sent another letter to Mr.\n\nJarvis this morning. I do hope\n\nto get an answer soon. We\n\nare getting restless to know\n\nwho of the Juniors will get pla-\n\nces from the faculty. We are\n\nhaving quite an easy time\n\nnow. I am somewhat on\n\na stand to know what to do;\n\nwhether to leave the 1st of\n\nJune as I have always done\n\nor stay for commencement.\n\nI have no idea of staying next\n\nyear for commencement. It\n\nseems that I ought to attend one.\n\nApril 10\n\nI received my answer from\n\nJarvis last Friday, but no\n\nmoney. He said, however,\n\nthat he would send it soon.\n\nDr. Garland left last Tues-\n\nday. His lecture Sabbath eve-\n\nning was very interesting and\n\nappropriate. His place in the\n\nUniv. will hard to fill\n\nApril 17th\n\nWe are having quite a cool\n\nspell of weather for this season\n\nof the year. I fear we will have\n\na backward spring. We have the\n\nappearance numberless millions of\n\ncaterpillars coming again. How\n\nI do despise to see them. My old\n\npatrons seem anxious for me to\n\nreturn again next summer. I\n\nthink now I will do so. However,\n\nit seems difficult for me to\n\nhear from Mr. Ike Bill, the [illegible]\n\nWell I have a speakers place. How\n\nwill I fill it? I think I will\n\ntry, and then afterward I ex-\n\npect to turn my attention\n\nwholly in my leisure moments\n\nto the study of the profession of med-\n\nicine. Uncle Jim says now\n\nthat he cannot let me have mon-\n\ney this year. I can go through\n\nany way till June without it.\n\nI think I will even have\n\nsome left; but, judging from\n\nthe past, I know he will not have\n\nit for me next fall, and I will\n\nagain be here, a moneyless man\n\nHowever the Future must take\n\ncare for itself. I enjoyed my-\n\nself splendidly last evening\n\nat Rev. J.B. Gambrel's I was\n\nsorry that the whole Junior class\n\ncould not be there as the en-\n\ntertainment was given specially\n\nfor us. I do think Mrs. Gam\n\nbrel is one of the most splendid\n\nwives I ever knew. Would\n\nthat I knew I could get such\n\na wife when I marry. But who knows?\n\nApril 24\n\nDebate in FS was enthusiastic\n\nthis morning. Mr. J.G. Rives made\n\nquite an eloquent and lengthy\n\nspeech; but, upon the whole, it\n\nseemed to me was foreign to the\n\nsubject. We elected Lewis Green, 2 weeks since,\n\nfrom Columbus, our valedictorian\n\nfor commencement. And now candi-\n\ndates are in the field again for anni-\n\nversalian. Who will be elected, is the\n\nquestion all over the campus. I\n\nwill now guess E.H. Dial, from Meridian,\n\nOld Dr. Garland, I suppose is, on the\n\nwaters to night. May the Lord spare\n\nhis life and return him in\n\nsafety is my prayer.\n\nMay 7.\n\nThe weather is yet cool for\n\nthe season and spring seems\n\nlate. I hear that wheat is fine.\n\nI was disappointed in getting\n\nto see Miss Lizzie Berry last night.\n\nShe stated no reason in answer to\n\nmy card, nor did she give any ap-\n\nology, which is not wholly satisfac-\n\nto me. Though I may be wrong in\n\nthis. One thing I know and that is\n\nI do not yet want to make any\n\negagements for marrying, though I would\n\nlike to keep the ladies company at\n\nleast once in every two weeks. It\n\nseems that I am naturally un-\n\nlucky in sending cards for calling.\n\nI never have written but three\n\nwhich were for calling and have\n\nfailed on every one--two to Miss\n\nMoss Harris, and this one to Miss Lizzie\n\nDr. Garland's pictures came safely\n\nto hand yesterday evening, all sat-\n\nisfactory. If I succeed in col-\n\nlecting all I will make my pict-\n\nure for my troubles--I am in a lit-\n\ntle suspense just now. Ledbetter\n\nmay make arrangements for us\n\nto accompany the Misses Nelson to church\n\ntomorrow evening, and Isom may\n\nmake the same at the College. I thought\n\nI would see Led. before he could write.\n\nBut now it is nearly 10 and I have not\n\nseen him since 4. Hereafter I shall be\n\nmore certain about things- I forgot\n\nto state in the proper place that\n\nthe Seniors planted their \"Memorial\n\nTree\" on Monday the 11th ult. The occa-\n\nsion was interesting to us, not only\n\nfor its own merits but also because\n\nwe were released all the afternoon\n\nfrom recitation. Stewart left col-\n\nlege yesterday. I am, indeed, sorry\n\nfor that boy. It seems that many\n\nboys cannot endure the hardships,\n\nprivations, and sacrifices of college life.\n\nMay 8th\n\nOur anniversary was cel-\n\nberated last Wednesday. The\n\nspeech was as good as I ex-\n\npected. I think it was satis-\n\nfactory to FS's generally, and also\n\nto the assembly which was\n\nquite a mixed one. So that\n\nI think Mr. Bigger did credit\n\nto himself, and reflected honor\n\non the society by the way he repre\n\nsented us. I was disappoint\n\ned in seeing Miss Dinkey Newell,\n\nand then made a flat in going\n\nwith Bingham after Miss Mag\n\ngie Plant & Miss Lizzie Berry.\n\nI know that Mrs. Leavell thought\n\nI went after Miss Lizzie, and on\n\nthat account I am sorry that I\n\nwent. However, I do not believe\n\nthat Miss Lizzie means to slight\n\nme or Mr. Bingham either by the\n\ncareless (?) way in which she\n\nhas treated us. I was favor\n\nably impressed by the compa\n\nny of Miss Katie Corethers last\n\nSunday evening. I anticipate a\n\nSimilar fate with Miss Lou\n\nElla Neilson tomorrow evening.\n\nI made second class in every thing\n\nExcept Eng & M.P.--1st in these--\n\nlast month. It does seem that\n\nI ought to make better marks\n\nwhile times seem easy upon us.\n\nI do dread old \"papa Quinche\"\n\nOn the examination with his\n\n\"Latin on the board.\" Dr. Juney\n\nhas been gone to Vicksburg since\n\nTuesday, so that we have had\n\nno French this week. This has\n\nslackened our rope still more\n\nfor this week--Jarvis is sore\n\nly trying my patience by not send-\n\ning that money. Surely will an-\n\nother week pass without my hearing\n\nany thing from him?-- FS adjourned\n\nprematurely this morning. Very much to\n\nmy disapprobation. Though no doubt\n\nI enjoyed myself much better by read-\n\ning physiology than I would to have\n\nserved during the meeting as [Servato-\n\nlean]\n\nMay 15\n\nI indeed enjoyed myself last Sabbath\n\nevening with Miss Ella but did not\n\naccompany her to church on account\n\nof the rain. She promised, without\n\nbeing solicited, to bring me a nice\n\nboquet (? I can't find this word in my dic\n\ntionary) for my speech at commence-\n\nment. Surely I ought to do my\n\nbest (Craig has found my word\n\nTis bouquet I will never forget\n\nthis. So my ignorance may here go on\n\nrecord for coming years. But as this is\n\nonly for my own private perusal I will\n\nnot change any thing on this page. And\n\nI will just state here that should any\n\none be so silly; meddlesome, and curious\n\nas to read this, hereby let him know\n\nthat he is transgressing on private and\n\nforbidden property. I don't think up to\n\nthis date any one, save myself, has ever\n\nread a page of my \"Saturday Nigh Report\"\n\nDr. Phillips replanted the Sen-\n\nior's tree Thursday evening. I think\n\nit also will shed off its leaves,\n\nnotwithstanding. Dr. Phillips laughed\n\nat me when I told him so. We\n\nrecited our last lesson in Eng.\n\nFriday evening. We must now\n\nprepare our Junior speeches for\n\ncommencement and let Prof. Johnson\n\ncriticize them. My speech is boring\n\nme considerably. I dont know\n\nwhat to write. I suppose I am\n\nnow feeling the disadvantage of never\n\nhaving been here at a commencement.\n\nExamination is now drawing near.\n\nAs I will remain this year I\n\ndo want to make a better mark than\n\nI did last year, especially on Math\n\nI know we can prepare very well\n\nfor examinations if we will, although\n\nthe weather is warm and the young\n\nladies encourage us in going to\n\nsee them--I sent Miss Lizzie a\n\ncard this morning and she answered\n\nit favorably. It seems that I\n\ncan accompany her to church but\n\ncant make a regular call. Stew-\n\nart came back this evening and told\n\nme that Mrs. Gambrel said, I made Miss\n\nLizzie mad that night at Gambrel's en-\n\ntertainment, about eating the love-can-\n\ndy knot with me. And also that if\n\nI were going a courting there I would\n\ncertainly fail. My criticism on this is\n\nshort. I simply think Mrs. Gambrel\n\nis somewhat taking time by the forelock.\n\nMiss Lizzie, as every other virgin,\n\nknows I never said a word of love\n\nto her in my life. I dont expect\n\nto say any in earnest till I get\n\nthrough college, and perhaps through\n\na Medical College also. But some-\n\nthing else is bothering me worse\n\nthan any \"love scrape.\" Jarvis still\n\nremains silent and I can hear\n\nnothing from my $20. I think\n\nyet I will finally get it. But it\n\ndoes [bore] me to wait so long-my pros\n\npects are rather gloomy for coming back\n\nhere next year. I suppose I will get\n\nbell-ringer's place next year, which will\n\nreplace my loss of the \"scholarship's ben-\n\nefit.\" I can teach only three months next\n\nsummer, and, they say, that warrants\n\nare worth only 50 cts in the dollar, So\n\nthat I will make at that rate but\n\nlittle more than my board--I see\n\nthat Thom. Wheat is again at home\n\nI hear he is to stay till after\n\nCommencement. I think my \"Saturday\n\nNight\" took notice of his leaving in\n\nin Jan in '74--Willie Wheat was\n\nvery sick last Monday so that we\n\nhad no Greek on that day- This\n\nis about the longest Report I\n\nsuppose up to date. I will remem-\n\nber however that I wrote the first\n\npart of this early in the week; but\n\nkept the date 15th. This I ex-\n\npect to do for regularity's sake\n\nand also for convenience of reference.\n\nMay 22\n\nE.H. Dial of Meridian was\n\nwas elected this morning in\n\nFS as our next anniversalian.\n\nJohn F. Rives was his only opponent\n\nwhom he beat 28 to 19. I think\n\nthis difference was greater than\n\ntheir merits justify. Dial was\n\nmy choice but I sympathized\n\nwith Rives in being so badly\n\nbeaten- I hope we will get\n\nBigger's speech next Saturday\n\nMay 29\n\nI got a few copies of Bigger's\n\nspeech this morning. Isom &\n\nTrotter did not make the con-\n\ntract with Thompson as definite\n\nas I wanted. However the\n\nwhole cost will not be more than\n\n$33 00; which is light compared\n\nWith $80 00 which we paid las\n\nYear.- The examination is now\n\ncoming on so near at hand that\n\nI have no time, it seems, either\n\nfor taking note of events for\n\nmy Report, or even for writing.\n\nJune 5\n\nI never studied harder I think\n\nin life than I have to day. Green-\n\nwood is sick, so that he cannot\n\nstand his examination in Eng.\n\nwith us on Monday, so that\n\nSmith is the only one ahead of\n\nMe; and if I could just beat\n\nhim I might stand a chance\n\nfor the British prize. I did\n\nnot think of this until yesterday\n\nevening; and, perhaps would not\n\nthen had not I noticed Smith\n\nstudying his Eng. with uncom-\n\nmon zeal & interest- I still\n\nhear nothing from Jarvis. Stew-\n\nart, I think, could have answered\n\nmy letter, by this time, had he\n\nbeen as prompt in seeing\n\nabout my money from Jarvis,\n\nas I have been in sending\n\nhis from the treasury.\n\nJune 12\n\nThree examinations are now\n\nover and three more to\n\nstand. I fear I flatted\n\nsmartly in Eng. But have\n\nsome hope, from what he\n\nsays, that I beat Smith. John-\n\nson might have had our\n\nmarks out by this time if\n\nhe had tried. I made a [ten]\n\nagain with Miss Lizzie by sending\n\nher a card for tomorrow night. I\n\nanticipate a nice time. Also\n\nI hope to meet Miss Dink New-\n\nell at commencement and enjoy\n\nher sweet smiles and lovely looks.\n\nStewart sent me a postal card\n\nWednesday and again failed to say\n\nany thing about my Jarvis money\n\nHuman nature is certainly self-\n\nI9sh. I was much more anx-\n\nious to hear from him, in\n\norder to know something about\n\nmy money, than for any other\n\nreason. I certainly\n\nwill rejoice when the time\n\ncomes for me to record another\n\n\"Saturday Night\" for these, ex-\n\naminations are truly boring\n\nto me. I see that by\n\nthrowing away my freshman\n\nmakrs, and marking an average\n\nof 93, from now on I\n\ncan get get a first class\n\ndiploma. I have never made\n\nan average of 93 on an ex-\n\namination yet, and therefore\n\nhave but little hope of\n\ndoing so.\n\nJune 19\n\nI can now see from the op-\n\nposite page how my marks\n\nare doing, and indeed I\n\nam heartily ashamed of some\n\nof them. I shall attribute\n\nour flats in Eng. to the\n\nambiguity of Johnson's questions.\n\nAs to the British prize\n\nI hear two reports (a) none of the\n\nclass will get because none have\n\nmade over 90; (b) This last book\n\nwhich we have studied is\n\nSemiannual Examination\n\nJuniors U.M.

However this may be, I\n\ndont want it, when I make no\n\nmore than 76. Counting both books\n\nI came out ahead; it up\n\nto this time Greenwood having\n\nmissed this examination, and\n\nWitherspoon the one in Feb; which,\n\nthough no doubt they will beat\n\nme badly would exclude them\n\nfrom the prize. I have always\n\nthought this book was rather\n\nand obscure conglomeration and\n\nwondered how Johnson would\n\nask questions. I dont believe that\n\nthe author himself would have\n\nrecognized some of the questions as\n\nbeing taken from the text.- Dr. Juny\n\nsurprised me worse than any in\n\nthe marks. And, I will record\n\nalthough I may hereafter be ashamed\n\nof it, that I talked to him\n\nthis morning more imprudently\n\nthan I ever did to a professor.\n\nI do believe the examination\n\nwas conducted unfairly, un-\n\nreasonable before man, and un-\n\njust before God. He allowed\n\nTunstall and Foster and others as much\n\ntime as they wanted after\n\ndinner, when he told us plainly\n\nthat we should close promptly\n\nat (he first said 12 oclock) 1 oclock\n\nI told him I was satisfied\n\nas to my grade absolutely, but\n\nnot relatively, that I could\n\nhave corrected nearly all errors\n\nhad I known that he would\n\nallow it, being directly contrary\n\nto what he had said. I now\n\nfeel like buying me a Jack\n\nand using it in his recitation\n\nroom seeing there is, in his\n\ndepartment no [illegible]\n\nfor honest labor. However\n\nI know of a truth, that as\n\nto marks- per se- I care noth-\n\ning. Tis for something higher that\n\nI endure my hardships, privations,\n\nand inconveniences, which are known\n\nto me human as they are to me.\n\nBut when a man, a sensible man,\n\ntreats me wrongfully I glory in\n\nmy privilege, as a free man to\n\ntell him of it. He said he con-\n\nsidered my language as insulting\n\nand he may, as I told him\n\ndemerit me, but I dont believe\n\nhe will.--I am in no humor\n\nto night to leave on record a\n\nfew pleasant memories of the young\n\nladies whose company I have\n\nenjoyed some for the last two\n\ndays & nights. God bless them\n\nall. I am tired now, and sleepy too.\n\nJune 20\n\nExaminations have come\n\nand gone, commencement\n\nhas come and gone and\n\nhere I am in the flat\n\nwoods waiting till Monday\n\nto begin my regular siege\n\nof boring in teaching school.\n\nI have not heard from\n\nGreek and Mechanics, and\n\nwill not now perhaps till\n\nI return next fall. But\n\nmarks are of little impor-\n\ntance any way. I see that\n\nthere is no hope for me\n\nto get a first-class deplo-\n\nma. I shall always believe\n\nhowever, that I could have\n\ngotten it, had I remained\n\nin my Freshmen & Sophomore\n\nyears till the class was\n\nexamined.\n\nSaturday Night\n\nReport\n\nFrom June 26 '75 To\n\nJanuary 15 '76\n\nJune 26\n\nI have lost some time\n\nby staying for commence-\n\nment which will only\n\nstrengthen my necessity for\n\nborrowing money next year.\n\nI feel, however, now that\n\nI shall never regret my\n\nstay, and the little sac-\n\nrifice and expense consequent\n\nthereto, even if, in after\n\nlife, it costs me a month's\n\nlabor. I talked to Miss\n\nLizzie Berry several\n\ntimes during commencement,\n\nand she treated me kindly\n\nsaying nothing whatever of\n\n\"walking papers.\" I think\n\nupon the whole, that Miss\n\nDinkey Newell was the\n\nmost amiable Miss, that\n\nI met at commencement.\n\nI now see that it was useless\n\nfor me to study for the British\n\nprize in philology; as the\n\nprize was given in the other\n\nbook. Greenwood got it; who\n\ndoubtless was worthy of it.\n\nJuly 3rd\n\nI am to night at Grandpa's;\n\nand Aunt Jodie is here also. I\n\nwill not get to see Matt nor\n\nAunt Liz, but expect to see\n\nMiss Ellie in the morning.\n\nI sent a letter to Miss Dink\n\nNewell this morning. Now what?\n\nWill I get myself into business as\n\nSmith says? It is not my\n\nintention to enter into courtship\n\nat present. Miss Dink certainly has\n\nsome qualities which I admire\n\nvery much, and shall risk some-\n\nthing in order to cultivate her\n\nacquaintance and friendship\n\nMy school opened last Monday\n\nwith 19 students. Bell says\n\nthat my contract is all\n\nright. I am indeed fortu-\n\nnate with my school. I was\n\nthe only one who taught last\n\nSept. in the county. Had I\n\nnot got the contract then,\n\nwhich was indeed difficult,\n\nI would have failed to get\n\nIt now, or not have gotten\n\nMore that $45 at most,\n\nAs it is I get $60 pr. mo.-I\n\nbegan reading Physiology last\n\nweek; and to day Dr. Fon-\n\ntaine has lent me two vol-\n\numes of Anatomy. Now I\n\nmust try to read some, for\n\npractical use in life.\n\nJuly 10\n\nI called on Miss Ellie last\n\nSunday morning at 8 oclock\n\nAt two oclock I stopped\n\nto see Miss Sallie for a short\n\ntime, failed to hitch my horse\n\non account of the saddle bags\n\nI suppose and consequent-\n\nly my horse left me. But\n\naccidentally I found her in\n\nabout a half hour; but was\n\nbenighted in getting home,\n\nlost the road entirely and\n\nhad to roam over the flat\n\nwoods and through dense thick\n\nets matted with fine logs,\n\ntill nine oclock. My school\n\ndid not increase this week as\n\nmuch as I expected. Have\n\nnot had more than 23. I\n\ndo hope I will be able to\n\nget on without whipping\n\nas much as I did last year.\n\nMy reading has been rather\n\nslow this week. Have read\n\nabout 160 pages. This rate will\n\nfinish my task of three vol-\n\numes for the summer, but\n\nmy chance will not be so\n\ngood when my school is\n\nfull as it has been. I heard\n\nRev. Mr. Fontaine preach to day\n\nat Palestine.\n\nJuly 17\n\nI am to night at Mr. Big-\n\nham's and happily have met\n\nMiss Lamar Phifer. Dave and\n\nhis wife look very natural-I\n\nreceived Miss Dink's letter yes-\n\nterday morning, and hurriedly\n\nanswered it last night- I\n\nhear to day that Will Stew\n\nard has been condemned and\n\nput in jail for stealing! I\n\ndo sympathize with Sam.\n\nJuly 24\n\nI called for a few min-\n\nutes on Miss Ina Word last\n\nSunday. She gave me the kind\n\nof a social equality grasp that\n\nI admire. I arrived home in\n\ndue time, owing perhaps to my\n\ngetting lost a fortnight previ-\n\nous. I am to night at\n\nMr. Steele's. So far I am fa-\n\nvorably impressed by Miss Ellen,\n\nand would like to see her again\n\nbefore I leave for Oxford.\n\nJuly 31st\n\nI have just staid at home\n\nall day to day; and have been\n\ntrying to finish up my task\n\nof reading for the week. I\n\nhave done so 'tis true, but\n\nit seems that I know but\n\nlittle of what I read. It is\n\nin some chapters almost like\n\nreading the dictionary. I have\n\nmuch study before me ere I\n\nmake a doctor. My school bores\n\nterribly. The boys are so hard\n\nto make get their speeches!\n\nI long to get away from this\n\ncountry, and land again at\n\nOxford. Surely I will not\n\ncome back here again next year\n\nto teach if I do not get\n\noff to Texas.\n\nAug. 7th\n\nI am to night at Mr. N.M.\n\nBerry's on my return from\n\nNew Albany where I failed\n\nto get any money from\n\nmy old debtor Jarvis.\n\nMiss Lizzie looks very sweet\n\nSays she dont know whether she\n\nwill return to Oxford or not.\n\nI do hope she will. I received\n\nA sweet letter from Miss Dink\n\nyesterday.\n\nAugust 14\n\nI am getting on very slowly\n\ntrying to read my books\n\non Anatomy. But my one\n\nhundred pages per week will\n\ngive me some information after\n\na while. I dont study however\n\nlike I would if I were in\n\ncollege. I must now begin\n\nto talk around about electing\n\nTrustees again, and try again\n\nto teach through September\n\nas I have done the past\n\ntwo years. How I do despise\n\nsuch arrangements!\n\nAugust 27\n\nI am to night at Grandpa's\n\nFind him an Grandma\n\nat home and in their usual\n\nhealth. Uncle Jim has gone\n\nagain to see Miss Lizzie\n\nSteele. I do wonder if\n\nthey will marry? It may be.\n\nBell gave me no encourage-\n\nment to day about teach-\n\ning on through September\n\nI expect however to teach on\n\ntill the Supervisors meet.\n\nIf I risk nothing I will sure-\n\nly make nothing. I would\n\nlose the 4 days if I were\n\nto do nothing; if I teach\n\nand get nothing for it\n\nperhaps it may do the chil-\n\ndren some good. They certain-\n\nly need every day they can\n\nget.\n\nAug. 28\n\nMr. Bigham received the nom-\n\nination for Treasurer in the\n\nprimary election last Mon-\n\nday. I think he and Don-\n\naldson stand a chance\n\nto be elected. But as for\n\nDuke I think it uncertain\n\nAnd so for Horton. We\n\nelected Trustees to day, the\n\nsame ones who served last\n\nyear. Hicks says he is anx-\n\nious for the school to go on\n\nbut I cant help but watch\n\nhim with suspicion. I dont\n\nbelieve he will \"do to tie to.\"\n\nFor although I taught through\n\nSeptember last year, yet\n\nhe imposed his services\n\nenough to break up the\n\nschool when I wanted to\n\nteach two weeks longer.\n\nConsequently I lost the time\n\nand they lost the schooling.\n\n\"Most men ought to be watched.\"\n\nSeptember 4\n\nI am more uneasy now about\n\nwhether I will get to teach\n\nanother month than any thing else.\n\nHave taught already 4 days\n\nwithout any sign of a con-\n\ntract. We had our first\n\nbread from new corn for sup-\n\nper to night. People have gen-\n\nerally been wonderfully blest with\n\ngood crops this year; a compen-\n\nsation I suppose for the bad\n\ncrops last year.\n\nSeptember 17\n\nI was in Pontotoc last Monday\n\nstaid all day and worked hard\n\nwith the Supervisors in trying\n\nto get them to locate the\n\nschools. The President said\n\npositively in the morning that\n\nthere would be no schools\n\nbegun till the 1st of Dec.\n\nThen in the afternoon he\n\nmade a speech in favor\n\nof locating immediately. They\n\npassed but one motion for\n\ntheir evening's work, which\n\nseemed to leave the loca-\n\nting of schools to the\n\nSupervisors of each district and\n\nthe Superintendent. I have\n\nbeen teaching now another\n\nweek without any contract.\n\nI cant help but be uneasy\n\nabout it. How I do despise\n\nsuch arrangements! I would\n\nbe very far from dobbling\n\nwith such uncertainties were\n\nI not pressed so for time.\n\nMrs. Newell (blind Granny(\n\ndied Wednesday night; was\n\nburied at Oak Forest Thursday.\n\nSickness is almost alarming\n\nNow in the Flatwoods. It may be\n\nThat in my next report I will\n\nhave to record the death of\n\nMrs. Mooney, who is very low at\n\nThis time, and God only knows,\n\nwho else, perhaps, some who\n\nnow enjoying good health,\n\nor this may be my last report.\n\nI hope to be able to got to\n\nOxford a few days before\n\ncollege reopens to renew my\n\nclaim for \"bell ringer.\" If\n\nI miss that I dont know\n\nwhat I will do for money\n\nnext year. Mrs. Newell,\n\n\"blind granny\" was buried\n\nlast Thursday evening at\n\nOak Forest.\n\nSeptember 18th\n\nI feel quite discouraged this\n\nevening about my school. It\n\nhas rained so much to\n\nday and yesterday that the\n\nchildren could not come to\n\nschool at all. Teaching on\n\nSaturdays is inconvenient any\n\nhow. I do hope I will\n\nnever be so pressed again\n\nfor time as to be obliged\n\nto teach Saturdays. To be\n\nstraining every point in\n\norder to teach my month\n\nout in time midst so much\n\nsickness, rain, and general\n\nindifference of my patrons;\n\ntogether with the reluctance\n\nof the superintendent in giv-\n\ning me merely a verbal contract,\n\nand, after all, the worthlessness\n\nof the warrants, all combine to\n\nmake this the most unpleasant\n\nmonth's work I ever performed.\n\nThere is but little chance\n\nOn Mrs. Mooney; we cant tell\n\nthat she is any better or\n\nworse than she was a week\n\nago. It is thought that\n\nMrs. Harriet Jernigan had a\n\nCongestive chill to day. She is\n\nvery sick at any rate. If\n\nthe Lord spares me to get away\n\nfrom this country I think\n\nI will stay away.\n\nSept. 25\n\nI am to night at Cousin\n\nBryant's. Have had quite\n\nan unpleasant ride from\n\nPontotoc in the rain- Bell\n\ntalked very clever to day,\n\nand promised to have my\n\nwarrant issued in Dec. If\n\nhe does, and I believe he will,\n\nit seems to me really that\n\nI ought to be grateful to\n\nhim and to others. No\n\nother school was allowed\n\nin the county. And the\n\nsame was the case last\n\nyear. Hicks has done very\n\nwell this year. Indeed I\n\nsuppose he thinks that he\n\ngained a complete victory over\n\nme last year. I am will-\n\ning for him to think so;\n\nand furthermore I feel\n\nsomewhat under obligations\n\nto him and all the patrons\n\nfor employing me to teach\n\nfor them three summers\n\nin succession; but a the\n\nsame time I do believe\n\nthat I have done a good\n\npart by them as a teacher.\n\nI received a letter to day from\n\nmy old friend and bad\n\npaymaster Lee Jarvis, say-\n\ning that he would send\n\nme a Warrant for that\n\n$20 he has been owing so\n\nlong, on the 5th of Oct. \"So\n\nmote it be,\" I was startled with\n\nthe news to night that Uncle Henry\n\nBrooks had died in May.\n\nOct 2nd 1875\n\nI am to night at Mr. John\n\nHall's near Oxford. \"How I\n\nlong to there.\" Tomorrow I\n\nexpect to go to see Miss\n\nEllen Garrett and Miss Dink\n\n\"Oh! That will be joyful.\" Last\n\nMonday I had a long weary\n\nride to Okolona after Matt;\n\nwho had gone there to see\n\na grand show. I'd rather\n\nshow keepers would stay at\n\nhome, as to my part for the\n\npresent. There is a great\n\ndeal of sickness every where\n\nnow. Tis almost alarming.\n\nUncle Jim has lent me\n\nMe $50. Now when will\n\nI be able to pay it back?\n\nI do want to make out if\n\npossible without borrowing\n\nany more.\n\nOct 9 '75\n\nI have again arrived safe\n\nat old Oxford. But few\n\nboys have as yet returned.\n\nI hear that James Sexton\n\nis married! I am not much\n\nsurprised, no more at least\n\nthan at Wiseman & Lester.\n\nWho will be next of our College\n\nboys? McInnis & Alezan-\n\nder are sub-profs $600\n\nsalary. Cant I make that\n\nmuch next year in Texas?\n\nI have secured the place of\n\n\"bell ringer\", which saves me\n\nof borrowing $100. I intend\n\nnow if I can get $130 for\n\nmy warrants to make out\n\nwithout borrowing any more, and\n\ngo on also to Texas in June.\n\nI do hope that this is my\n\nlast year of such galling em-\n\nbarrasssment about money.\n\nOct 16th\n\nOne week of regular work has been\n\nperformed. Our text books are\n\nscarce and high, in consequence partly\n\nbecause of the changes made in the several\n\ndepartments. I gave Bigger $1 00\n\nfor his Isocrates, and now I have\n\nto give $1 50 for a Plato bacuse\n\nDr. Wheat prefers that for this term.\n\nI hear that Mrs. Gailard is dead.\n\nOct 23\n\nOld Mr. McMahan died yesterday\n\nat 2 oclock, will be buried\n\ntomorrow with Masonic ceremony.\n\nMiss Lizzie Smither died this morn-\n\ning. How careful ought we to live!\n\nI began to day to write for my\n\nfirst on any Bimonthly. Great ex-\n\ncitement is now prevailing over the\n\nstate on the subject of politics. Al-\n\nthough I expect to cast my for-\n\ntune with that of the lone Star\n\nstate, yet I would be glad to\n\nsee my own native state once\n\nfreed from the galling yoke of\n\nRadicalism. I am making but\n\nLittle progress now in the way\n\nof reading Physiology; but I hope\n\nto do better soon. I am\n\nnow considering the propriety of trying\n\nto sell books again.\n\nOct. 30th\n\nWednesday night we felt sen-\n\nsibly the earthquake. I hope\n\nwe will soon hear from it through\n\nthe newspapers. One month\n\nis now gone! Seven more\n\nand then where will I be?\n\nI long for the time to\n\ncome when I shall take board\n\nfor the lone star State. Thurs-\n\nday we received the news\n\nthat Mr. Eggeston Wilbourn\n\nwas dead. Death seems\n\nto be making rapid strides\n\nover our country. Only last\n\nSunday was it that I\n\nattended the burial of two of\n\nour citizens.\n\nNov. 6\n\nThe excitement of the election is\n\nnow over and the Democrats\n\nare highly rejoicing in their victori-\n\nous triumph. Mr. Percy\n\nHowry was buried yesterday.\n\nHis death, I think, ought to be\n\na warning to the boys against\n\nthe useless practice of carrying\n\npistols.\n\nNov 13\n\nMcInnis has returned from\n\nhis sister's wedding and has\n\nbeen boring us badly on the\n\nsubject of [illegible]. Dr.\n\nLyon started to New Orleans\n\nto his church Synod last\n\nTuesday night. We expect\n\nhim back next Tuesday. I\n\nwent out last Sunday evening\n\nto tell Miss Ellen Garrett good-\n\nbye. I wish I could get a\n\nchance to go to see Miss Dink,\n\nbut I dont think I can afford\n\nto give a dollar for a horse\n\nout of the livery stable.\n\nNov. 20th\n\nWe are all looking forward\n\nwith anxious expectation to\n\nnext Thursday when we expect\n\nholiday, and also the big London\n\nshow that is expected here on that\n\nday. Although it is a\n\n\"Thanks Giving Day\" I think most\n\nof the boys will go for on any\n\nother day we could not get excused\n\nfrom our lessons. I think I\n\nshall go for my first time in\n\nOxford, and no doubt it will\n\nbe my last time. Our bash-\n\nful little Magazine keeps making\n\nsome progress. I do hope it will\n\nappear in time for us to take a\n\ncopy home with us Christmas\n\nNov. 27th\n\nBoth the big shows have come\n\nand gone. I did wrong, no doubt,\n\nin attending last Thursday when\n\nI had been having fever with my\n\ncold for three nights previous. As my\n\nfever continued to rise at night I went\n\nthis morning to see Dr. Chandler; and had\n\nto pay $1.75 for medicine. He says\n\nmy cold is right severe and that I\n\nmust keep close lest it develop itself\n\ninto Pneumonia. This makes me a little\n\nuneasy, but it shall be very careful\n\nfrom now on and try to get well.\n\nDec. 4\n\nI was obliged to miss recitations\n\nlast Monday and Tuesday on account\n\nof my cold and fever. My cough\n\nis right severe yet; but I am in\n\nhopes that I will get well without\n\nan attack of pneumonia. I dont\n\nthink I ever saw more gloomy weather\n\nin my life; every thing seems to be\n\nmelancholy--Lee Jarvis has\n\npromised to be in Oxford next\n\nMonday and pay me; but the in-\n\nclemency of the weather together\n\nwith the fact that he has so often\n\ndeceived me heretofore makes\n\nme have but little hope of\n\ngetting the much needed money.\n\nMy money affairs are very\n\nembarrassing every way; Uncle\n\nJim tells me that warrants in\n\nPontotoc are worth but 50 cts in\n\nthe dollar! I cant hear any\n\nthink from Mr. Hicks whether\n\nhe has had my last month's\n\n$35 warrant issued or not;\n\nAs every thing was so tangled and\n\nconfused, I am a little afraid\n\nthat I will lose that month's work.\n\nIt seems that many things are\n\nworking together to defeat my\n\npurposes in trying to go to\n\nTexas in June: but I have not en-\n\ntirely lost hope yet. I want\n\nmy services in FS hall to pay\n\nfor my washing. Perhaps I\n\nmay make a few dollars by\n\nselling my book again; though\n\nI cant expect more than half,\n\nif that, such success as I had\n\nlast year. I feel grateful\n\nto Dr. Chandler for giving me\n\nthat prescription gratis. I expected\n\nto pay at least a dollar for it.\n\nUncle Jim says that he will\n\nbring or send some conveyance for\n\nme to come out to his wedding\n\non the 29th inst. and that Miss\n\nEllen Steele and I are to be two of the\n\nwaiters. I anticipate a nice time,\n\nnotwithstanding Miss Ella Neilson says\n\nthat those who \"wait on\" will never\n\nget married themselves. If Miss\n\nEllen looks as sweet as she did last summer\n\nwhen I saw her no doubt I will say many\n\nthings to her, some wise, some otherwise.\n\nI was not able to deliver my bi-\n\nmonthly to the FS's this morning. I\n\ndo hope I will be well by next Saturday.\n\nChristmas will soon be here; and\n\nno doubt, it would be better for\n\nmy pocketbook if I were to spend\n\nit as I did last Christmas selling\n\nbooks; but under the circumstances\n\nI suppose I must forego the op-\n\nportunity of trying to make a few\n\ndimes, lay aside all wordly care\n\nand try for once to enjoy myself.\n\nThis is my last Christmas in College;\n\nand as I have always heretofore had\n\na certain task for the holidays,\n\nit seems that I might afford to\n\ndevote the incoming ones, under the\n\nauspicious circumstances to innocent\n\nenjoyment, and harmless gratification\n\nDec. 11\n\nPerhaps I was never more agreeably sur-\n\nprised than I was on last Monday, when\n\nI ascertained that my old friend, slow\n\nin paying debets, Mr. Lee Jarvis, had\n\nleft that long desired twenty dollars\n\nin town for me. I have suffered\n\nno little uneasiness about that since\n\nlast March. I think I will\n\nnever act so hastily again as I\n\ndid in sending that counterfeit\n\nbill back to him. I think if I\n\nhad kept it and simply informed\n\nJarvis that it was counterfeit, and\n\nthat unless it was redeemed in\n\nten days, I would put it into the\n\nhands of an officer, I would have\n\ngot it all right without half so\n\nmuch trouble uneasiness and expense.\n\nMy cold is still bothering me. I\n\nhad to disappoint the FS's again this\n\nmorning about my bi-monthly. I do\n\nhope I will be well by next Saturday.\n\nI know, however, that the constitution\n\nof FS says that bi-monthly shall\n\nnot conflict with the inaugural\n\nof the President; so it seems that\n\nI could not have spoken, had I\n\nbeen well. I am a little ex-\n\ncited about my little piece of\n\npoetry that I wrote for our Magazine\n\nEd Dial seems to think that the\n\neditors will have it published.\n\nMy sickness and bi-monthly both\n\nseem to work against my selling\n\nof books. Martin has already\n\nstarted around with his book\n\nand has three subscribers. Time\n\nabout is fair play; I succeeded\n\nlast year, and therefore I should\n\nnot grumble if I fail this year.\n\nBesides I have the bell ringing\n\nand services in the FS hall to at-\n\ntend to, both of which pay men,\n\nand so I should not be too greedy\n\nfor getting other things than my\n\nbooks to demand my attention.\n\nIndeed 4th class in optics last\n\nmonth looks like I have\n\nby far too many worldly cares\n\nalready. I should I know for\n\nmarks sake, have told Bobby\n\nthat I was not prepared when\n\nhe called on me just after I\n\nhad been sick and had not\n\nlooked a the text for a week.\n\nSo work only for marks is a poor\n\nbusiness in college.\n\nDec. 18\n\nWell my old \"bimonthly\" speech is deliver\n\ned at last. I fear I hardly did\n\njustice to the occasion for I was\n\nnot interested in it from the start\n\nas I should have been. I t was\n\nso cold, and our fires being rather\n\nbad we were uncomfortably\n\nsituated and as a matter of course\n\nI had an ungrateful audience.\n\nAs to my cold I hope that it is\n\nabout well. Hereafter I will, I think,\n\nbe more careful at the beginning and\n\ntry to break it up before it\n\ngets so permanent and stubborn\n\na hold on me. For the past week\n\nI believe I have been more interested\n\nin my little piece of poetry\n\nthan my bimonthly. Have not yet\n\nheard from the editors. Where\n\nwill I be next Saturday night?\n\nI am perplexed about my ar-\n\nrangements. Uncle Jim wrote\n\nto me that he would come after\n\nme but did not say what\n\nday he would come. I would\n\nbe very glad to go by, and\n\nsee Miss Dink, but am afraid\n\nI might stay, should I wait\n\ntill he comes for me; till\n\nI would wear out my welcome.\n\nIf I stay here I will be in great\n\nsuspense should I go out to\n\nJohn Smith's as Uncle Jim request\n\ned me, I might get bored un-\n\nmercifully. I rather think\n\nI shall go by Miss Dink's house\n\nany way. Without any dis-\n\nsimulation, I am quite conscious\n\nthat my affections for Miss Dink\n\nare rapidly increasingly by our\n\ncorrespondence, which for the past\n\nsix months, has been of the most\n\npleasant and endearing character'\n\nfor indeed she is a sweet letter\n\nwriter. I hope (?) that this\n\nincrease of affection is nothing more\n\nthank an increase of friendship. I\n\nknow that if I ever intend to make\n\nan M.D. I should not try to win\n\nany young lady's affections with\n\nthe intent of consummating them\n\nin wedlock for several years\n\nyet. I cant say that I regret\n\nthat I asked her to correspond with\n\nme; for indeed the correspondence\n\nhas been not only a source of real\n\nand I hope innocent pleasure and\n\nharmless gratification, but also\n\nit has been a source of improve-\n\nment and information; for certainly\n\nshe makes fewer mistakes than any\n\ncorrespondence I ever had. My\n\nintercourse with her has caused\n\na feeling of doubt to arise with\n\nreference to two questions: viz.\n\nWould I be willing for her to mar-\n\nry any one else without my making\n\nher an offer of myself? Would my\n\nbeing engaged to her render me less\n\nhappy, or interfere with my plans\n\nfor making a doctor & c? I believe\n\nmy cool unprejudiced judgment\n\nadvises that \"I wait for a more\n\nconvenient season.\" I sold three\n\nof Lee's books this evening. I fear\n\nI shall not be able to sell many\n\nTimes are hard and people want\n\nsomething new. I am anxious\n\nto try Seward's travels, I think\n\nit might sell very well.\n\nDec. 25\n\nI left Oxford last Wednesday\n\nmorning in Mr. Jim Trott's wag-\n\non as I had the chance to\n\nthus save my Uncle from the\n\ntrip by getting there before\n\nhe would start. I regretted\n\nvery much, however, to miss the\n\nopportunity of seeing miss Dink.\n\nThursday I had a very rainy\n\nand muddy walk of 12 miles\n\nfrom Bigham's mill to Grandpa's.\n\nAbout 2 o'clock in the after-\n\nnoon I found Uncle Jim, Un-\n\ncle John & Henry very busy\n\nrepairing Grandpa's house, as\n\nMiss Lizzie will have to live\n\nwith them till Uncle Jim can\n\nbuild his house. Friday\n\nI had a muddy ride going with\n\nMatt over to Mr. Gilmer's. I\n\nwanted to cross the creek very\n\nbadly to see Miss Ellen Garrett\n\nbut could not on account of the\n\nhigh water. Saturday after-\n\nnoon I arrived at Mr. Garrett's\n\n1876\n\nbut was too late to see\n\nMiss Ellen for she had gone\n\nwith Mr. John Abernathy to Red\n\nland. I am somewhat unea-\n\nsy about my $35 claim in Pon\n\ntotoc county. They say that it\n\nis probably that Bell will be\n\nturned out of office; then the\n\nnew board of supervisors might\n\nrefuse to issue my warrant\n\nwhich is very likely if schools\n\nare suspended for a year- so\n\nthen I would be compelled\n\nto lose my labor\n\nJanuary 1st 1876\n\nChristmas has come and gone.\n\nThe 4th and very likely the\n\nlast one that I will spend\n\nas a student in the University\n\nTo say the least I have en\n\njoyed this Christmas very\n\nwell. Perhaps I enjoyed the\n\nthe success of my business\n\nas much as any other one\n\nthing. I was gratified\n\nwhen Uncle Jim told me\n\nthat he had disposed of my\n\nwarrants at 70 & 75 cts, when\n\nI was expecting to take about\n\n50 or 60cts. Then I was\n\nhappily surprised last Monday\n\nwhen Bell issued my pay\n\ncertificate without consult\n\ning the suprviro's and\n\nmuch more so when Carr\n\ncashed the warrant for me.\n\nI spent Monday night pleasantly\n\nat Mr. Bigham's. Miss Mary Ann\n\nhowever, was not at home. This\n\nmade the third time that I\n\nwas disappointed in seeing my\n\nlady friends. Tuesday morn\n\ning it began to rain again,\n\nso that I remained till after\n\ndinner, when I was obliged\n\nto ride all the afternoon in the\n\nrain, and cross frightful\n\nlooking creeks, and at last be\n\ndisappointed the second time in\n\nseeing Miss Ellen.
