The recommended direction is from south-west to north-east so that prevailing winds are behind you. This also makes for a gentle introduction, with the first couple of sections low-level and easy going, mainly on towpath.\n\nOverview\n\nThe Way begins at the ruins of the Old Fort, Fort William and runs the entire length of Scotland’s longest glen, following the Caledonian Canal, forest tracks and drove roads. It passes beside three major lochs: Lochs Lochy, Oich and Ness. There is good access to accommodation and shops as it passes through villages along the Great Glen, with an alternative option that includes Invergarry. The route ends at Inverness, the capital of the Highlands, at Inverness Castle. Although primarily a walking route, it is suitable also for riders of mountain bikes, provided they show respect for other users.\n\nHighlights\n\nNeptune’s Staircase, and its views of Ben Nevis\n\nthe Caledonian Canal – Thomas Telford’s historic work of engineering, including Neptune’s Staircase\n\nAchnacarry House (short detour) with its links to the Clan Cameron Museum and Commando training\n\nspectacular views over Loch Ness and the Great Glen from the High Route\n\n17th century heritage in Fort William and Fort Augustus\n\nstarts near the base of Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in the UK\n\nBe aware\n\nsome stretches of minor road walking, mainly around Gairlochy, Kilfinnan, Drumnadrochit and Abriachan\n\nlimited accommodation in Gairlochy and South Laggan: use Spean Bridge/Invergarry as alternatives\n\nThe challenge\n\nStarting from Fort William, the first few sections are undemanding, but after the mid-point (Fort Augustus) the route undulates, especially if you opt for the High Route. The overall ascent of 1835m/6020ft refers to the High Route which contains some steep sections, including a few very steep bits which are unsuitable for cyclists. (The overall ascent for the original route is much less, at 1230m/4035ft.) The highest point on the High Route is 422m (1385ft) between Invermoriston and Drumnadrochit. The section lengths varies between 9 and 20 miles (14-32 km) and most walkers will wish to split the 20-mile section between Drumnadrochit and Inverness, perhaps using transport to/from Blackfold or by camping at Abriachan. The terrain varies widely: canal towpath, forest track, old drove roads and former military roads, purpose-built path and urban pavement.\n\nAccommodation\n\nThere is a range of accommodation options in the settlements along the route for walkers and cyclists, and for paddlers along the Great Glen Canoe Trail. You can find out more about these here or from the Visit Scotland website.\n\nWild camping is legally allowed in Scotland if practised responsibly under the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.\n\nSupport services\n\nA number of companies offer support services ranging from baggage transfer, through bike or canoe hire/shuttle to full-service packages.\n\nPublic transport\n\nTrain services link Glasgow with Fort William, and Edinburgh with Inverness. Scottish Citylink provides a bus service between Fort William and Inverness, which stops at settlements along the Great Glen. Inverness also has an airport.\n\nFor details, visit Traveline Scotland, or, for the entire UK, Traveline. For travel from anywhere to anywhere, try Rome2Rio."
