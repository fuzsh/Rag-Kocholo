He was baptised in December of that year. His father was the village blacksmith.\n\nHe was apprenticed to a stonemason and became an ornamental carver. Some of his earliest work was on the new building for the Newcastle Literary & Philosophical Society[2].\n\nLough working on Milo of Croton\n\nIn 1825 he went to London to study the Elgin Marbles. He lodged above a greengrocers at 11 Burleigh Street, Covent Garden and began work on his huge sculpture of Milo of Croton, a character from Greek myth[2]. The sculpture became so large he had to break through the ceiling to continue it. (His landlord's reaction is not recorded.)\n\nIn 1826 he joined the Royal Academy Schools and the following year he exhibited his finished statue. It was well received and his reputation was established; thereafter he never lacked for patrons[2]. The statue was later cast in bronze and survives at Blagdon Hall in Northumberland.\n\nHe married a London woman, Mary North, on 14 January 1832 in St Marylebone in London[3]. She was the daughter of the Reverend Henry North, chaplain to the Duke of Kent, the father of Queen Victoria[4]. This gives an idea of how far John had risen in society. They had two daughters, Mary born in November 1832 and Georgiana in 1834.\n\nCollingwood Monument - 1845\n\nSoon after her birth, late in 1834, John went to Italy to study, backed by some of his aristocratic patrons. He spent nearly four years away, mainly in Rome. There is no evidence that the family went with him[4].\n\nIn 1841[5], John and Mary were living in Southampton Street in Covent Garden, one road over from John's original lodgings. The two girls, despite being only six and eight years old were at a girls' school in Blackheath. About that time he was commissioned to carve four monumental lions out of granite for the base of Nelson's Column. After an argument over style Lough pulled out. The lions were finally added by Landseer in bronze thirty years later.\n\nIn 1845 he was commissioned to create the massive statue of Admiral Lord Collingwood, the hero of Trafalgar as part of the Collingwood Monument, overlooking Tynemouth.\n\nTitania - 1863\n\nHe continued his work on portrait busts, full size statues and numerous pieces for his main patron, Sir Matthew White Ridley of Blagdon Hall, which has the best collection of his work. As well as family sculptures of many of the Ridley he also made large works for the grounds and a series of works based on Shakespeare for the Ridley's London home[4]. When two large seated statues of Victoria and Albert were needed for the Royal Exchange in London, John was given the commission.\n\nIn 1851[6], the entire Lough family were together and living at 42 Harewood Square in Marylebone (the square is now gone and is the main concourse of Marylebone Railway Station). John was listed as a Sculptor and there were two servants in the household.\n\nIn 1861[7], John and Mary were still in Harewood Square with the same servants, but the girls had married and moved out.\n\nIn 1871, neither John nor Mary were registered, presumably the were abroad travelling. Tragedy had struck the family with the death in Calcutta in 1868 of their younger daughter, Georgiana, who was married to Maj General Sir George Bourchier of the Royal Artillery. In August of 1871 their other daughter, Mary, died in London.\n\nMilo of Croton in bronze\n\nJohn died 8 April 1876, aged 78, at Harewood Square[8]. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery[4]. In his will he left £7,000 to Mary.\n\nSources\n\n↑ \"England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975\", database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:J3J2-J36 : 20 March 2020), John Lough, 1798.\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 Gunnis, Rupert.
