        "text": "Keith Macdougall takes a look back at the week in Westminster, including the recommendations of the Parliamentary Banking Commission, questions over further involvement in Syria and an apology from the health secretary after reported failings by the health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission.\n\nOn Tuesday, William Hague was at the despatch box for questions to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. He warned it was \"not a feasible or desirable thing\" to go against the will of MPs on arming Syrian rebels, but refused to say whether the government would be bound by a vote in the House.\n\nOn Wednesday, the prime minister assured Labour leader Ed Miliband he would would amend the Banking Bill to impose criminal sanctions and financial penalties on bankers who behave recklessly, as recommended by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards.\n\nLater the same day, David Cameron made a statement to the Commons regarding the G8 summit at Lough Erne in Northern Ireland. He said agreement on the need for open, fair tax rules was now \"written into the DNA of the G8\".\n\nWednesday also saw a statement from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, in which he apologised for an apparent cover-up by the Care Quality Commission, which has been accused of not properly investigating the deaths of babies and mothers at the Furness General Hospital in Barrow.\n\nLights, camera, action!\n\nMPs are often told off by the Speaker for engaging in amateur dramatics, but the famous green benches could soon be available for hire by professional actors.\n\nThe House's Administration Committee has approved plans to allow the makers of TV dramas and movie producers to use the Commons as a filming location - a move, it is estimated, which could bring in between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000 a day.\n\nBut among the current stars of that particular stage, some are unhappy at the proposals. Keith Macdougall discussed their objections with Conservative MP Robert Halfon and Labour's Thomas Docherty.\n\nGrandee designs\n\nFollowing the Succession to the Crown Bill, the eldest child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will inherit the crown, regardless of gender. But the same is not true for most aristocratic families, where the title and estate are passed down through the male line.\n\nA private member's bill has now been brought in to change the rules, sponsored by Conservative peer Lord Lucas. Another supporter of the move is Mary Macleod, Conservative MP and former assistant private secretary to the Queen. Esther Webber asked her why this was such an important issue.\n\nFlawed laws\n\nA recent report from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, which oversees the drafting of legislation, suggests the UK's laws are becoming too complex.\n\nRichard Heaton, who is first parliamentary counsel and permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office, spoke to Keith Macdougall about what could be done to simplify the statute book.\n\nThe previous week's programme can be found here.\n\nWatch The Week in Parliament on BBC Parliament at 11pm on Fridays, 11am on Saturdays and 9am on Mondays."
