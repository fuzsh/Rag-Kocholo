We hope you find everything you’re looking for.\n\nI joined the school in April 2017, after Mrs Jones retired with twenty- one year’s service at the school. I am pleased that the school continues to build on Mrs Jones’ legacy; with it’s excellent reputation, strong Catholic ethos, warm family atmosphere and determination to be the best it can be. At St Mary’s we strive for Academic excellence every moment of the day as well as ensuring that our pupils and staff are nurtured to grow their talents in all areas and above all are happy!\n\nMiss P Jordan\n\nHeadteacher\n\nOPEN DAYS: All are very welcome to visit the school for our OPEN DAYS on the 14th of November 23 and the 5th of December 23."
