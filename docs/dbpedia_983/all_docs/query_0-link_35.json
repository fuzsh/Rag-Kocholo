The Island forms an upstanding part of a horst block within the Irish Sea, and is largely composed of deformed Lower Palaeozoic metasedimentary rocks and associated granitic intrusions. Relatively undeformed Upper Palaeozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary successions encroach onto the fringes of the Island, and are widespread and thickly developed in the surrounding offshore Peel, Solway and East Irish Sea basins. Geological processes have shaped the Manx landscape and also given rise to significant mineral resources. For example, lead, zinc and copper ores hosted within the Lower Palaeozoic succession and granitic intrusions were the basis of an important mining industry on the Island during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. More recently, the offshore sedimentary basins surrounding the Isle of Man have been the focus of hydrocarbon exploration, following commercial successes in the central and southern East Irish Sea Basin to the south.\n\nThis regional report integrates the results of targeted geological mapping on the Isle of Man, with an assessment of recently released hydrocarbon exploration data from the offshore basins, and with recent published and unpublished research. The report complements a new British Geological Survey (BGS) 1:50 000 Series geological map sheet covering the Isle of Man, which provides a revision of the meticulous, but outdated, mapping carried out between 1892 and 1897 by G W Lamplugh. Sponsorship of this report, together with the accompanying new geological map and an associated popular publication, was generously provided by TotalFinaElf Exploration UK PLC and their partners Enterprise Oil plc and Amerada Hess Limited. This oil industry group actively explored around the Island between 1994 and 1997 and generated important new geological and environmental data. The potential value of these new data was recognised by the Isle of Man Government and the group, and a programme of geological and environment work was planned in collaboration with the Island’s Department of Trade and Industry. The geological work was led by the BGS, while Port Erin Marine Laboratory (part of the Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies of the University of Liverpool) conducted the environmental work. Copyright for the geological products, including this new report, the popular publication, the geological map, and associated Geographic Information System (GIS) digital databases, is jointly vested with the BGS (part of the Natural Environment Research Council) and the Isle of Man Government.\n\nThe geological work programme has benefited greatly from extensive collaboration with many organisations and individuals, including members of a multidisciplinary, academic research team that was mainly active during the period 1995 to 1998, and which was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). The research team’s data were integrated with detailed information from Lamplugh’s field slips, published information and a wide range of data contributed by many organisations, including the Isle of Man Government, Fugro Airborne Surveys (formerly World Geoscience: UK Ltd), Jebco Seismic (UK) Limited, Schlumberger Geco-Prakla, WesternGeco Ltd and Wardell Armstrong. To facilitate efficient reinterpretation of the large and diverse data sets, they were captured and manipulated as themes within a specially customised GIS.\n\nMany practical benefits are anticipated to follow from this programme. This report, the new map and the associated GIS will provide much previously unavailable detailed information. This information will assist the addressing of issues such as planning of major development projects, management of contaminated land and optimal exploitation of mineral resources.\n\nD A Falvey PhD Director, British Geological Survey, Kingsley Dunham Centre, Keyworth, Nottingham.

This report integrates the results of recent geological mapping and associated multidisciplinary geoscience on the Island with an evaluation of recently released petroleum exploration data from the surrounding offshore area and other recent published work. It complements a new 1:50 000 geological map of the Isle of Man and an associated popular publication. The Iapetus Suture represents a collisional boundary between the Laurentian and Avalonian basement terranes and lies in the offshore area close to the north of the Isle of Man. The oldest rocks on the Island are of Ordovician age and comprise the Manx Group. They are composed mainly of metamorphosed turbidites that formed at the southern margin of the Iapetus Ocean. In contrast, the Silurian turbiditic rocks of the Dalby Group represent a fragment of a succession that accumulated across both the Avalonian and Laurentian margins during the final closure of the Iapetus Ocean. A range of Palaeozoic intrusive rocks occurs at outcrop on the Isle of Man, including granite and granodiorite. Red beds of interpreted Devonian age crop out around Peel, though it remains uncertain whether they were deposited in conformity with the underlying Silurian rocks, or in a separate unconformable basin. Following the Caledonian Orogeny, regional uplift and erosion led to near peneplanation of the basement surface before the resumption of deposition in Carboniferous times. Carboniferous rocks onshore are restricted to the northern and southern parts of the Island, though only the southern area crops out at the surface. Carboniferous sedimentary rocks form an important and extensive part of the offshore succession around the Isle of Man, though uplift and erosion associated with Variscan inversion have commonly restricted the distribution of coal-bearing and red-bed Silesian strata.\n\nFollowing Variscan inversion and regional uplift and erosion, the resumption of deposition occurred during Late Permian times. Scattered deposits of aeolian sandstone and breccia of the Appleby and Enler groups at the base of the Permian succession of the Isle of Man region are overlapped by the widespread evaporitic and marginal marine strata of the Cumbrian Coast and Belfast groups. Triassic rocks within the Isle of Man region dominantly comprise red beds of the arenaceous Sherwood Sandstone Group and the overlying argillaceous and evaporitic Mercia Mudstone Group. The Penarth Group, at the top of the Triassic succession, includes marine strata that mark a marine precursor to the dominantly marine Lower Jurassic Lias Group. The post-early Jurassic tectonostratigraphical history of the Isle of Man region is difficult to reconstruct, because with the exception of a veneer of Quaternary and Recent sediments, mid-Jurassic and younger sedimentary rocks are absent from the Island and the surrounding offshore area. This is principally the result of two phases of uplift and erosion in Cainozoic times. Palaeogene igneous rocks associated with the development of the Iceland Plume form a suite of mafic minor intrusions on the Island and within the surrounding offshore sedimentary basins. The glacial succession exposed on the Isle of Man can be divided into high-level and low-level suites. The high-level suite occupies upland areas underlain by the Manx Group and mainly comprises locally derived glacial diamicts. The low-level suite, occupying the northern plain and parts of the plain of Malew and the Peel embayment is dominantly composed of material foreign to the Island. It comprises a wide range of glacigenic sediments and is commonly associated with a prominent glacial morphology.\n\n(Succession) Geological succession of the Isle of Man.\n\nChapter 1 Introduction\n\nThe Isle of Man is about 45 km long and up to 16 km wide, and forms an upstanding part of a horst block within the Irish Sea (Figure 1). Two upland massifs dominate the Manx landscape and are separated by the central valley, which runs from Douglas to Peel. Deformed Lower Palaeozoic metasedimentary rocks and associated granitic intrusions underlie the areas of high ground (Figure 2), the highest point of which is Snaefell at 621 m. Upper Palaeozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary successions encroach onto the fringes of the Island, and are widespread and thickly developed in the surrounding offshore Peel, Solway and East Irish Sea basins (Figure 3). The Manx Designated Area extends to 12 nautical miles offshore and is characterised bathymetrically by platforms with water depths generally less than 40 m. The relatively deep-water North Channel lies mainly outside the designated area to the west and north-west. With the exception of a veneer of Quaternary and Recent sediments, mid-Jurassic and younger sedimentary rocks are absent from the Island and the offshore designated area. This is principally a result of two phases of uplift and erosion during Cainozoic times. Thick Quaternary and Recent sediments blanket the northern plain and much of the plain of Malew in the south of the Island (Figure 29). Offshore, these deposits range in thickness from zero close inshore around the south of the Island to about 150 m off the Point of Ayre.\n\nThe account presented in this report summarises the geology of the Isle of Man and its offshore-designated area (Figure 1). It represents a tangible result from a collaborative research programme of closely related projects, which has also led to the publication of a new 1:50 000 scale Solid and Drift geological map of the Isle of Man (BGS, 2001) and a popular publication to explain the geology and landscape of the Isle of Man (Pickett, 2001). This report integrates and builds on recent scientific advances by Woodcock et al. (1999a), Quirk (1999), Meadows et al. (1997) and Jackson et al. (1997), and also draws upon new information resulting from the recent resurvey of the Island and a substantial amount of recently acquired offshore hydrocarbon exploration data.\n\nHistory of research\n\nThere is a long history of investigation regarding the geology of the Isle of Man (e.g. Ford et al., 1999; Wilson, 1999), though the detailed work of Lamplugh (1903) forms the basis for much of our present view of the geology. A synthesis of the Lower Palaeozoic stratigraphy, structure, metamorphism and intrusions was provided by Simpson (1963a, b, 1964a, b, 1965, 1968) although subsequent biostratigraphical work by Molyneux (1979) indicated that Simpson’s stratigraphy was significantly flawed. The geology of the Island was summarised by Dackombe and McCarroll (1990), and the publication of a field guidebook by Ford (1993) stimulated much field-based research that focused on the Lower Palaeozoic rocks. This research was co-ordinated through a multidisciplinary project, the results of which were summarised by Woodcock et al. (1999a). The guidebook by Ford (1993) has recently been updated in the light of the new research (Ford et al., 2001).\n\nThe preparation of the new geological map of the Isle of Man involved a phase of collaborative research that was led by the British Geological Survey (BGS) during 2000. Before the new field investigations began, pre-existing field data were made available to BGS by the research team who had contributed to the Lower Palaeozoic synthesis of Woodcock et al. (1999a). These data, together with many other data types contributed by the oil industry and government, were integrated within a customised Geographic Information System (GIS) which allowed efficient redisplay and interpretation of the information. Researchers from Oxford Brookes University assisted the BGS with construction of this GIS, and also with the following field survey (Burnett et al., 2001). Much of the fieldwork was focused on defining the location and nature of the boundaries between Lower Palaeozoic lithostratigraphical units recognised by Woodcock et al. (1999a), and investigating whether additional formations were present. An important component of the field investigations was sampling for new biostratigraphical analysis (Molyneux, 2001). Although much of the field survey was targeted at the Lower Palaeozoic rocks, the Devonian and Carboniferous successions were also re-examined, including all the available Carboniferous type localities and key reference sections of Dickson et al. (1987). Similarly, a re-evaluation of the Quaternary geology in the field, largely by academic co-workers, builds on recent research (e.g. Dackcombe and Thomas, 1989; Chiverrell et al., 2001).\n\nIn the offshore area surrounding the Island, geological information has come from two main sources:\n\nExploration for hydrocarbons has generated hundreds of line-kilometres of seismic reflection profiles, together with information from deep wells. Such exploration activities and datasets have stimulated much research regarding the hydrocarbon-rich East Irish Sea Basin (e.g. Parker, 1993; Jackson and Johnson, 1996; Meadows et al., 1997; Quirk, 1999). Recent exploration campaigns by TotalFinaElf Exploration UK PLC and their partners in the Peel and Solway basins have also provided significant new information on the geology and hydrocarbon potential of these previously little-explored areas (Newman, 1999) and this report draws freely on data and borehole reports generously loaned by the company.\n\nBGS has undertaken a systematic offshore regional mapping programme of the UK continental shelf, including the Isle of Man offshore designated area. These surveys were funded largely by the Department of Energy (now the Department of Trade and Industry), and the results are incorporated into the BGS 1:250 000 map series. This map series is complemented by the BGS UK Offshore Report Series (e.g. Jackson et al., 1995), which integrates the results of surveys of BGS and commercial organisations with other published data, including important deep-seismic reflection surveys (e.g. Beamish and Smythe, 1986; Todd et al., 1991).\n\nGeological summary\n\nIn earliest Ordovician times the continental crust that now underlies the Isle of Man lay within the southern hemisphere and formed part of Eastern Avalonia, a microcontinent on the northern margin of the Gondwana supercontinent (Cocks and Fortey, 1982, 1990). At this time, the wide Iapetus Ocean separated Eastern Avalonia from the Laurentian continent.\n\nDuring the early Ordovician, Eastern Avalonia drifted northwards and eventually collided, in Silurian times, with Laurentia during the Caledonian Orogeny. As a result of this collision, three distinct zones can be recognised within the crustal structure of the Isle of Man region. These are termed, from north to south, Laurentian crust, the Iapetus Convergence Zone, and Avalonian crust (see (Figure 4) and (Figure 5)). The Iapetus Convergence Zone includes the ‘Iapetus Suture’ and is associated with a north-east-trending, low aeromagnetic anomaly of long wavelength. This may indicate the presence of metasedimentary rocks, originally deposited at the northern margin of Eastern Avalonia, which were subsequently partially subducted during final closure of the Iapetus Ocean (Kimbell and Stone, 1995). Notably, recently released commercial seismic data to the south-west of the Isle of Man indicate additional north-west-dipping basement reflectors (see (Figure 8)) that are interpreted as a Caledonian imbricate thrust stack (Barrule Thrust Zone) that may link with the lower crustal interface interpreted as the Iapetus Suture (Brewer et al., 1983).\n\nThe oldest rocks at outcrop on the Isle of Man are termed the Manx Group. These rocks were deposited during the Ordovician on the continental margin of Avalonia, at the southern margin of the Iapetus Ocean. They dominantly comprise turbiditic strata of laminated mudstone and siltstone, but also include units of typically fine-grained sandstone. Locally, volcanic rocks form a minor component of the succession. Generally, the Manx Group forms a steeply dipping and north-west-younging succession, although it is disrupted by a number of strike-parallel faults (Figure 3). Previous structural models that invoked a large-scale synclinorium through the Isle of Man (e.g. Lamplugh, 1903; Simpson, 1963a) are undermined by biostratigraphical data (Molyneux, 1979, 2001). Biostratigraphical evidence has also been crucial in demonstrating that Silurian strata crop out to the south of Peel (Howe, 1999). These rocks, which were formerly included in the Manx Group, are now separated as the Dalby Group (Morris et al., 1999). They consist predominantly of turbiditic rocks and represent a fragment of a succession that accumulated across both the Avalonian and Laurentian margins during the final closure of the Iapetus Ocean. The Dalby Group consists predominantly of fine- to medium-grained sandstone and silty mudstone, but includes very thinly laminated hemipelagite and rare bentonite beds. Within the Lower Palaeozoic succession, evidence of three phases of ductile deformation is preserved in folds and cleavages (S1–S3), and a variety of faults indicate brittle deformation. Subduction of the Iapetus Ocean beneath Laurentia during Ordovician and Silurian times resulted in progressive deformation of deposits on the Laurentian margin (e.g. Barnes et al., 1989; Barnes and Stone, 1999). Deposits on the Avalonian margin were subjected to periodic upheaval, but ductile deformation of the succession did not occur until the early Devonian, when the Avalonian margin was thrust beneath the leading edge of Laurentia. The first two phases of deformation, which affect both the Ordovician Manx Group and the Silurian Dalby Group, are considered to be equivalent to the ‘Acadian’ deformation of north-west England (Soper et al., 1987). The third tectonic phase is evident only locally and comparable with structures in the Carboniferous rocks, and therefore may be Variscan in age (Fitches et al., 1999).\n\nA range of Palaeozoic intrusive rocks occurs at outcrop on the Isle of Man. Although granitic rocks may underlie much of the Island at depth (Cornwell, 1972), they crop out as three small bodies: the Dhoon granodiorite in the north-east, the Foxdale granite in the central part of the Island, and the Oatlands Complex in the south-east (Figure 3). The Dhoon granodiorite has a minimum age of syn-S1 while the Foxdale granite, with an isotopic age of around 400 Ma (personal communication, S F Crowley and P S Kennan) postdates the formation of S2. A suite of acid sheets crops out along the central spine of the Island, and other minor intrusions with a range of compositions are abundant in the Manx Group. The basic intrusive complex at Poortown comprises dykes and sills of dolerite and andesite and may have been emplaced during widespread volcanic activity associated with subduction of the Iapetus Ocean during the late Ordovician (Piper et al., 1999).\n\nRed beds of interpreted Devonian age crop out around Peel, and are termed the Peel Sandstone Group. The group consists of up to about 2000 m of interbedded red sandstone and conglomerate, with minor siltstone, claystone and calcrete palaeosol horizons. These were deposited in dominantly continental braided river and distal alluvial fan environments, though some aeolian sandstone is also present. A semi-arid climate is suggested by the presence of calcrete-bearing soil horizons within the succession. Plate reconstructions suggest that the Peel Sandstone Group accumulated when the Isle of Man region lay at a palaeolatitude of 15° to 20° south of the equator (Allen and Crowley, 1993). The age of the Peel Sandstone Group is contentious owing to a lack of indigenous fossils, but Piper and Crowley (1999) assigned an early Devonian age on the basis of palaeomagnetic evidence. It remains uncertain whether the continental Peel Sandstone Group was deposited in conformity with the underlying marine Silurian rocks, including the Dalby Group, or in a separate unconformable basin (Woodcock et al., 1999b). Presumed exhumation and erosion of the Iapetus collision zone occurred during an early Devonian peak of orogenic activity. The Peel Sandstone Group does not contain a definite Caledonian cleavage, and must have been deposited late in the deformation history (Woodcock et al., 1999b).\n\nFollowing the Caledonian Orogeny, regional uplift led to near peneplanation of the basement surface before the resumption of deposition in early Carboniferous times (Woodcock et al., 1999). Generally, the relatively weakly deformed sedimentary cover rocks rest with strong unconformity on the Caledonian basement. The cover rocks are locally over 9000 m thick and are cut by predominantly normal faults, with only localised reverse faulting and folding; the Permian to Jurassic succession is also affected by salt-related structures.\n\nDuring Carboniferous times, the Isle of Man region is thought to have lain a few degrees to the south of the equator and was gradually drifting northwards (Scotese et al., 1979). Carboniferous rocks onshore are restricted to the northern and southern parts of the Island, though only the southern area crops out at the surface (Figure 3). In the north, Carboniferous rocks are concealed by Permo–Triassic strata and Quaternary deposits. Carboniferous sedimentary rocks form an important and extensive part of the offshore succession around the Isle of Man (Jackson et al., 1995; Jackson and Johnson, 1996), though uplift and erosion associated with Variscan inversion have commonly restricted the coal-bearing and red-bed Silesian successions to the centres of major basins or zones adjacent to major faults (Newman, 1999).\n\nThe broad tectonosedimentary setting for Carboniferous times is interpreted to be similar to that seen in Ireland and the UK, with rifting during Dinantian times and postextensional ‘sag’ subsidence during the Silesian. Rift trends were strongly influenced by the grain of the Caledonian basement. In the south of the Island, the Langness Conglomerate Formation lies at the base of the Carboniferous succession and essentially comprises a red-bed sequence. In mid-Dinantian times, a marine transgression introduced a predominantly carbonate succession in this area, initially deposited in a ramp setting, but evolving into a platform environment (Plate 1). In the late Dinantian, this was replaced by more basinal conditions, though ‘Yoredale type’ successions are more commonly developed beneath the north of the Island. Parts of the Carboniferous succession on the Island can be lithologically and biostratigraphically compared with the succession in northern England, and a revised lithostratigraphical nomenclature that recognises this is used in this report.\n\nSeismic data suggest that about 2500 to 3000 m of Carboniferous sedimentary rocks may be preserved within the Solway Basin (Newman, 1999). The absence of a possible base-Carboniferous reflector in the Peel Basin means that the thickness of the Carboniferous succession is less well constrained in that area. In basinal areas east of the Solway Basin, Dinatian strata are estimated to be over 4000 m thick, and are thought to consist of mainly shallow-water to deltaic deposits (Newman, 1999). In contrast, over platform areas such as the Manx–Lakeland Ridge, the Dinantian is represented by a thin succession of shallow-water carbonates. Within the Eubonia and Keys sub-basins of the East Irish Sea Basin, up to 4000 or 5000 m of Carboniferous sedimentary rocks may be preserved (Jackson et al., 1995). The shallow-water Dinantian facies inferred for the Peel, Solway, Lagman and Keys basins and onshore Cumbria contrast significantly with the deep-water hemipelagic facies described from the southern tip of the Isle of Man and the Craven Basin and Garstang areas.\n\nThe Namurian marked a change from the deposition of carbonate-dominated successions to siliciclastic-dominated sedimentation. The Isle of Man, the Solway Basin and the Lake District are characterised by cyclic shallow-water deltaic successions during the Namurian, with the Isle of Man and the Lake District forming highs where sedimentation was intermittent. To the south, basinal conditions appear to have persisted throughout most of the Namurian and led to the accumulation of thick packages of mudstone, which include good petroleum source rocks. By the start of Westphalian times, a flat, low-lying fluviodeltaic environment was widely developed. Only erosional remnants of the once more extensive Westphalian succession are preserved owing to Variscan uplift and erosion. Westphalian rocks are recorded in boreholes from the northern part of the Isle of Man, in the centre of the Solway Basin, on the Ogham Platform, in the Eubonia Basin and onshore in the Canonbie area of west Cumbria.\n\nVariscan deformation, in latest Carboniferous times, is recorded in the Isle of Man region by reversal on pre-existing normal faults and associated basin inversion (see (Figure 15)). The basin inversion appears to have been most pronounced over, and to the north of, the Manx–Lakeland Ridge, where Dinantian strata commonly subcrop the Permo-Triassic cover. In an alternative model for end-Carboniferous uplift, Corcoran and Clayton (1999) and Quirk et al. (1999a) postulated a process of thermal doming.\n\nFollowing Variscan inversion and regional uplift and erosion, the resumption of deposition occurred during the Late Permian. Throughout much of Permo-Triassic times, the Isle of Man region formed part of a rift system that extended from the English Channel Basin to the western Scottish offshore basins. As in early Carboniferous times, rift trends were strongly influenced by basement structure and some aspects of basin configuration were similar to those of the Carboniferous rift system, though new major, basin-margin, normal faults with north-north-west or northwest trends were developed. In early Triassic times, rifting intensified during deposition of the Sherwood Sandstone Group and continued during deposition of the Mercia Mudstone Group, though with an increasing component of thermal subsidence. The deposition of salt, both in the Permian Cumbrian Coast Group and the Triassic Mercia Mudstone Group, led to the local development of salt-related folds, detachment faults and major collapse graben (see (Figure 18)).\n\nAt the base of the Permian succession of the Isle of Man region, the Appleby Group comprises scattered accumulations of largely aeolian sandstone that pass laterally into the locally developed alluvial fan breccia of the Appleby and Enler groups. These strata are overlapped by the widespread evaporitic and marginal marine (locally aeolian) deposits of the Cumbrian Coast and Belfast groups (see (Figure 21)). The Appleby Group is characterised by abrupt changes in thickness, but over most of the Isle of Man region it is probably less than 10 m thick. In basinal areas of low relief, the widespread absence of the Appleby Group and equivalents may be partly related to low surface run off in an arid climate, and the development of karstic topography with underground drainage systems beneath the penecontemporaneous Dinantian limestone surface outcrop. The Enler Group is recognised within the North Channel Basin where it comprises a breccia formation overlain by a sandstone formation. Within the Isle of Man region, the Cumbrian Coast Group reaches up to about 200 m in thickness and comprises two broad facies belts. In the basinal areas, which were characterised by more rapid subsidence, evaporites formed during successive transgressions of the Bakevellia Sea, and are overlain by mudstone. Towards the more slowly subsiding basin margins, this facies belt passes into marginal marine, estuarine and fluvial/lacustrine mudstone, which is commonly overlain by aeolian sandstone. The Belfast Group, in the North Channel Basin, is laterally equivalent to the Cumbrian Coast Group, and consists dominantly of arenaceous strata.\n\nTriassic rocks within the Isle of Man region comprise the arenaceous Sherwood Sandstone Group overlain by the argillaceous and evaporitic Mercia Mudstone Group, which is itself overlain by the relatively thin Penarth Group (see (Figure 23) and (Figure 24)). The Sherwood Sandstone Group reaches up to about 1400 m in thickness, and consists of predominantly fluvial and aeolian sandstone. Initially, a large braided river on a northerly directed palaeoslope laid down fluvial deposits (Rottington Sandstone Member). Subsequently, aeolian and sabkha depositional environments became widespread with periodically dominant fluvial conditions (Calder Sandstone Member and Ormskirk Sandstone Formation). The Mercia Mudstone Group reaches about 2000 m in thickness within the Solway Firth Basin, but over 3000 m in the East Irish Sea Basin; it comprises alternating units of mudstone and halite (Jackson et al., 1995). Depositional environments alternated between episodes of halite precipitation from brine pans and phases dominated by the accumulation of lacustrine laminate and aeolian dust (Jackson and Johnson, 1996). The succession is extensively deformed by halokinetic structures, such as salt pillows, diapirs and shallowly dipping décollements. The Mercia Mudstone Group was probably deposited across virtually the entire Isle of Man region, but post-Early Jurassic erosion has left only large erosional remnants, which are probably coincident with areas of greatest Late Triassic subsidence. The overlying Penarth Group comprises dark grey pyritous marine mudstone overlain by grey-green mudstone and limestone. The pyritous mudstone was formed during a marine transgression that encroached from the south as a precursor to a major early Jurassic transgression.\n\nThe dominantly marine mudstone and bituminous limestone of the Lias Group were deposited over practically the entire Isle of Man region, though subsequent erosion has reduced their present-day distribution to scattered remnant outliers (Figure 1). Indeed, the post-Early Jurassic tectonostratigraphical history of the Isle of Man region is difficult to reconstruct, because with the exception of a veneer of Quaternary and Recent sediments, mid-Jurassic and younger sedimentary deposits are absent from the Island and the adjacent offshore area. This is principally the result of two phases of uplift and erosion in Cainozoic times. Uplift and erosion during the Palaeogene were associated with the development of the Iceland Plume (e.g. White and Lovell, 1997), whereas Miocene uplift and erosion were probably related to Alpine movements (Newman, 1999). During the Palaeogene, the north-west British Isles and the Atlantic Margin formed part of the North Atlantic Igneous Province, which was characterised by the development of extensive lava flows, sill complexes, dyke swarms and central igneous complexes. In the offshore Isle of Man region, Palaeogene igneous rocks comprise a suite of mafic minor intrusions that are most evident from their strong magnetic signature within the less magnetic Permo–Triassic sedimentary cover (see (Figure 23) and (Figure 24)). Onshore, east-southeast-trending olivine dolerite dykes are best exposed on the coasts of the Isle of Man. One of the most prominent Palaeogene dykes in the Isle of Man region, known as the Fleetwood Dyke, forms a large and complex intrusion comprising a number of separate dykes and sheets arranged en échelon.\n\nThe glacial succession exposed on the Isle of Man largely formed during the last or Late Devensian cold stage (oxygen isotope stage 2) and comparatively little is known about the deposits of earlier glacial and interglacial stages that locally occur at depth. The succession can be divided into high-level and low-level suites (see (Figure 29)). The high-level suite occupies upland areas underlain by the Manx Group and comprises relatively thin and locally derived glacial diamicts reworked by periglacial processes. The low-level suite, occupying the whole of the northern plain, parts of the plain of Malew and the Peel embayment, is dominantly composed of material foreign to the Island. These deposits comprise a wide variety of glacigenic sediments, including diamict, sand and gravel and massive and laminated clay; they are associated with a prominent glacial morphology. The Quaternary deposits on the northern plain reach up to about 250 m in thickness, and include the Bride Moraine, which forms one of the largest and most complex moraine structures in the British Isles. The offshore Quaternary deposits around the Isle of Man are a complex succession of glacial diamict, outwash, glaciomarine and marine sediments that range in age to oxygen isotope stage 6 or earlier. These deposits are recognised on seismic profiles both by their unconformable relationship with pre-Quaternary strata and their commonly subhorizontal layering. They range in thickness from zero close inshore around the south of the Island to about 150 m off the Point of Ayre, though 30 to 40 km offshore the Quaternary deposits consistently exceed 50 m in thickness. The Quaternary deposits are being actively reworked in the modern environment. Gravel-rich sea-bed sediments predominate within 10 to 20 km of the coast, passing into sand-dominated sediments and finally mud to the east and west of the Island (Jackson et al., 1995).\n\nChapter 2 Crustal structure\n\nIn earliest Ordovician times the crust which now underlies the Isle of Man lay at high southerly latitudes close to the northern margin of the Gondwanan supercontinent, and was separated from the equatorial Scottish (Laurentian) terranes by the wide Iapetus Ocean (Cocks and Fortey, 1982, 1990). The Isle of Man, together with the southern parts of Britain and Ireland, lay on a microcontinental component of Gondwana which has been termed ‘Eastern Avalonia’ because of similarities to the Avalon terrane of eastern Newfoundland and parts of maritime Canada (Soper, 1986). Eastern Avalonia rifted from Gondwana in the early Ordovician, drifted northwards and converged with Laurentia during Silurian times. The collisional boundary between terranes originating from the Laurentian and Avalonian sides of the ocean is known as the ‘Iapetus Suture’, and now lies in the vicinity of the Isle of Man.\n\nCaledonian basement outcrops within the Manx region (Figure 3) are limited to the Isle of Man (see Chapter 3) and the Southern Uplands, and the main evidence for regional crustal structure comes from geophysics. Seismic reflection and potential field (gravity and magnetic) data provide information on both lower and upper crustal structure and allow the identification of three distinct crustal structural zones. These are termed, from north to south, Laurentian crust, the Iapetus Convergence Zone and Avalonian crust (Figure 4).\n\nThree main basement structural trends are evident, although over substantial parts of the region these can only be inferred from trends in the sedimentary cover. The important north-east–south-west ‘Caledonian’ basement trend is widespread, but most clearly defined over the Iapetus Convergence Zone. A northwest–south-east cross-trend is prominent in both Laurentian and Avalonian crustal zones and is interpreted as reflecting a greater heterogeneity of basement trends. Structures with the north-west–southeast structure may have formed in Caledonian times (Kelling and Walsh, 1970) as ‘transfer’ faults, compartmentalising the Caledonian thrust stacks, or may be much younger, Variscan, features (England and Soper, 1997). A third trend, north-north-east–southsouth-west, is restricted to the Iapetus Convergence Zone west of the Isle of Man.\n\nLaurentian crust\n\nLaurentian crust lies beneath the northernmost part of the Manx region (Figure 4). At surface, its southern margin is made up of a succession of fragmentary volcanic arcs and backarc basins accreted during the Early Palaeozoic, culminating in the accretionary thrust stack of the Southern Uplands terrane (Barnes et al., 1987; Stone, 1995; Barnes and Stone, 1999). The latter comprises north-east-trending, near vertical, fault-bounded slices within each of which a thin sequence of oceanic mudrock passes up northwards into a thick turbidite sandstone sequence. The sandstone in each slice represents a restricted stratigraphical interval which, with the age of the transition from the mudrock, becomes progressively younger in successive slices southwards. It is supposed that similar structures extend south-west beneath the northern part of the Manx region, where the regional structural grain follows the north-east-south-west Caledonian trend. The prominent north-west–south-east ‘transfer’ trend is well developed locally, in particular as structures in the Upper Palaeozoic sedimentary cover, owing to reactivation of some of these faults as basin-bounding structures (e.g. to the North Channel and Stranraer basins) (see Chapter 4).\n\nThe Laurentian crust in the Manx region has geophysical characteristics which distinguish it from the area to the south. Seismic reflection data from the WINCH 2 profile indicate that the Laurentian middle crust is poorly reflective ((Figure 5); Brewer et al., 1983; Hall et al., 1984). Aeromagnetic anomalies over south-west Scotland and central Ireland ((Figure 6)a) indicate that it contains blocks of magnetic mid-crustal material (Kimbell and Stone, 1995; Morris and Max, 1995). These may be composed of Precambrian crystalline basement and/or magnetic igneous rocks generated by arc magmatism associated with the closure of the Iapetus Ocean (Kimbell and Stone, 1995). The Laurentian lower crust in the Manx region appears mostly unreflective on the WINCH 2 profile, with a poorly imaged Moho (Figure 5), although this may be due to problems with seismic data quality in the North Channel.\n\nIapetus Convergence Zone\n\nA broad zone, here termed the Iapetus Convergence Zone, trends north-east-south-west through the middle of the Manx region (Figure 4). Rocks within the Iapetus Convergence Zone are likely to be of predominantly Avalonian affinity, with structures lying parallel or near parallel to the Iapetus Suture. This is seen in the strong north-east–south-west trends in the overlying cover rocks (Chapter 4). The Iapetus Convergence Zone is geophysically quite distinct from the Laurentian and Avalonian crust to the north and south.\n\nLong wavelength aeromagnetic anomalies are aligned broadly north-east–south-west, with a magnetic low corresponding to the Iapetus Convergence Zone (Figure 6). This may be caused, in part, by a depression in the underlying magnetic basement rocks beneath the Solway Firth and Peel basins (there is a correlation between the lowest magnetic values and the depocentres of these basins). However, the continuity of the magnetic low over central and southern Ireland ((Figure 6)a) indicates a significant contribution from rocks of anomalously low magnetisation in the underlying, pre-Carboniferous basement (Figure 5). It may be that these are metasedimentary rocks, originally deposited at the northern margin of Eastern Avalonia and subsequently partially subducted during the final closure of the Iapetus Ocean (Kimbell and Stone, 1995).\n\nThe Iapetus Convergence Zone is the only area in the Manx region where the north-east–south-west Caledonian trend was the dominant structural control on subsequent sedimentary basin evolution (Chapter 4). Variations in the gravity field are mainly caused by structures in the sedimentary cover, so gravity images (Figure 7) help to illustrate this structural inheritance. The north-westward extent of the Iapetus Convergence Zone is somewhat indeterminate. At shallow depths it is expressed by the southward termination of the northwest-trending Permo–Triassic basins of the Southern Uplands. Locally, gravity data clearly indicate that the North Channel and Luce Bay basins are truncated to the south by a north-east-trending lineament ((Figure 7); Stone, 1995). East of this the boundary of the Iapetus Convergence Zone appears to be offset southwards, as indicated by the north-west-trending Dumfries Basin which extends farther south (Akhurst et al., in press).\n\nThe south-east margin of the Iapetus Convergence Zone corresponds to the north-west margin of the magnetic Avalonian middle crust. The ramp-like geometry of this boundary was modelled by Kimbell and Quirk (1999) who estimated that it lies at depths of 8 to 10 km beneath the south-eastern part of the Isle of Man but dips north-west to much greater depth (Figure 4), (Figure 5). When projected upwards, the ramp aligns roughly with a prominent zone of anomalous magnetisation at shallow levels, corresponding to a belt of short wavelength magnetic disturbances extending north-east–south-west along the axis of the Isle of Man (Figure 4), (Figure 6)b; Kimbell and Quirk, 1999).\n\nThe ramp is also spatially associated with dipping seismic reflectors in Lower Palaeozoic rocks to the south-west of the Isle of Man, here termed the Barrule Thrust Zone (see below).\n\nIapetus Suture and Barrule Thrust Zone\n\nThe earliest seismic evidence for the Iapetus Suture was provided by the WINCH 2 deep seismic profile (Brewer et al., 1983), which imaged a north-west-dipping reflectivity boundary at lower crustal levels north-west of the Isle of Man. This boundary separates poorly reflective ‘Laurentian’ lower crust to the north from more reflective lower crust of presumed ‘Avalonian’ affinity, to the south, and was interpreted as the Iapetus Suture (Hall et al., 1984; Beamish and Smythe, 1986; Soper et al., 1992). Depth contours on this lower crustal interface are illustrated on (Figure 4).\n\nAdditional north-west-dipping basement reflections are imaged updip of the lower crustal feature, at much shallower depths, both on a grid of seismic lines south-west of the Isle of Man ((Figure 8)a) and also on WINCH 2 ((Figure 8)b; Hall et al., 1984). These shallow reflections can be mapped over an area of some 300 km2, depth contours on the basal event being illustrated on (Figure 4). The basal reflector dips roughly west-north-west at 22°, from close to the sea bed to depths of about 8 km. The reflections are interpreted as a Caledonian imbricate thrust stack (Quirk et al., 1999b), here termed the Barrule Thrust Zone. The thrust stack has a maximum perpendicular thickness of at least 1300 m; the higher thrusts are steeper than the basal thrust, locally dipping at more than 30°. Structure contours on the basal thrust trend north-north-east, with a possible small sinistral ‘transfer’ offset south-west of the Calf of Man (Figure 4). Projecting the seismically imaged reflections updip (south-eastwards) towards the surface suggests that the basal thrust would crop out on the Isle of Man, along a trend closely corresponding to the north–easttrending belt of magnetic anomalies that lies along the axis of the Island (Figure 6). Although no specific thrust structure can be identified onshore, Quirk et al. (1999b) have suggested that the offshore Barrule Thrust Zone correlates with a belt of imbricate structures in the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of the Isle of Man, traversing the Island from south-west to north-east. Zones of high strain in the uppermost part of the thrust stack, or in its hanging wall block, may explain features such as the Niarbyl Shear Zone (Chapter 3), which crops out on the west coast of the Island. The Barrule Thrust Zone is markedly reflective. This may be caused by a thick development of altered or mineralised fault rocks, but is also consistent with the presence of igneous material intruded into the fault zone (see Chapter 8).\n\nThe reason for the anomalous shallow magnetisation associated with this zone is not known but it may be speculated that it arose as a result of secondary processes perhaps also associated with the observed higher metamorphic grade along this axis. For example, ilmenite is abundant as a metamorphic mineral phase formed during the early phases of deformation in the pelitic rocks within this zone (e.g. Power and Barnes, 1999). In addition, as discussed above, the effects of igneous material intruded into the fault zone cannot be ruled out.\n\nThe structure of the Barrule Thrust Zone at depth is uncertain. It lies above the north-west-dipping ramp at the edge of magnetic Avalonian middle crust (Figure 4). Kimbell and Quirk (1999) suggested a linkage between the basement ramp and overlying thrust zone, but this requires a steeper dip for the latter than is indicated by the seismic evidence (Figure 5). An alternative suggestion is that the Barrule Thrust Zone passes downward at a somewhat lower angle to link with the lower crustal interface interpreted as the Iapetus Suture. The resultant ramp-flatramp geometry (Figure 5) is very similar to that proposed by Chadwick and Holliday (1991) for Acadian thrusting within the Iapetus Convergence Zone beneath northern England. In the model of Chadwick and Holliday (1991) thrusts observed near the surface are situated entirely within Avalonian crust, well to the south of the (faunally defined) Iapetus Suture at shallow depths. This is consistent with the presence of rocks of Avalonian affinity on both sides of the Barrule Thrust Zone on the Isle of Man. A possible objection to linking the lower and upper crustal structures in this way lies in their apparently differing strikes. The Barrule Thrust Zone trends north-north-east, whereas the (admittedly poorly constrained) strike of the Iapetus Suture appears to be more east-north-east or north-east ((Figure 4); Soper et al., 1992). Support for this change in direction also comes from the regional aeromagnetic data ((Figure 6); Kimbell and Quirk, 1999).\n\nKimbell and Quirk (1999) suggested that a structural precursor to the Barrule Thrust Zone was initiated in Avalonian basement before the closure of the Iapetus Ocean. It may have originated when the basement was assembled in late Precambrian to early Cambrian times and was then reactivated during early Palaeozoic extension and subsequent continental collision. A possible analogue is provided by the Causey Pike Fault in the Lake District, which lies in a similar position with respect to the regional magnetic anomaly pattern. The Causey Pike Fault is an Acadian compressional structure which appears to have been formed by reactivation of a major, early Ordovician normal fault close to the margin of Eastern Avalonia (Webb and Cooper, 1988; Cooper et al., in press).\n\nChadwick and Holliday (1991) proposed that the Acadian basement thrusts of northern England suffered extensional reactivation in early Carboniferous times, thereby controlling development of the Northumberland–Solway Basin. It may be that the Barrule Thrust Zone behaved in a similar manner. Although the south-east margin of the Carboniferous Peel Basin is not clearly imaged on the seismic data, the apparent presence of north-west-dipping normal faults and tilt blocks in the hanging wall block of the thrust zone, suggest that its extensional reactivation played a part in controlling the Dinantian development of the basin.\n\nAvalonian crust\n\nAvalonian crust lies beneath the south-eastern part of the Manx region (Figure 4), demarcated to the northwest by the magnetic basement ramp in the middle crust. The Foxdale and Dhoon granites were intruded into the north-west flank of the Avalonian crustal block and appear to have contributed to the development of a rigid basement ‘buttress’ at depth beneath the Isle of Man. This structure maintained its integrity throughout the subsequent evolution of the region, forming the elevated Manx–Lakeland Ridge (Chapter 4). The basement buttress is of regional extent, passing eastwards into the Lake District and Alston blocks of northern England, themselves elevated blocks underpinned by granitic intrusions.\n\nSeismically the Avalonian lower crust is quite reflective, with a well-defined seismic reflection Moho ((Figure 5); Hall et al., 1984). The magnetic middle crust is interpreted to be the north-western part of a broad area of crystalline Avalonian basement that extends beneath southern Britain and the south-eastern part of Ireland ((Figure 6)a), where such basement crops out in the Rosslare Terrane (Kimbell and Quirk, 1999). As with the Laurentian crust, a north-west–south-east basement trend is important within the sedimentary cover, for example controlling the development of the very large Keys Fault (Chapter 4) in the East Irish Sea Basin. There are numerous faults with a similar trend on the Isle of Man (e.g. Quirk et al., 1999b), though only a few of these show large displacements.\n\nCaledonian intrusions\n\nLarge numbers of minor intrusions of a wide range of compositions occur within the Palaeozoic rocks of the Isle of Man, many of which were deformed by the Caledonian (early Devonian) orogenic events. Larger intrusions at outcrop are restricted to three relatively small granitic plutons and a basic intrusive complex, all hosted within the Ordovician metasedimentary rocks of the Manx Group. The Dhoon granodiorite body in the north-east of the Island [SC 46 87], was emplaced before, or during the formation of S1 cleavage (Power and Barnes, 1999). To the south-west, the Foxdale granite [SC 29 77] was emplaced somewhat later, postdating the S2 cleavage; combined whole-rock and muscovite Rb–Sr data indicate an age of about 400 Ma, although with a high degree of uncertainty (personal communication, S F Crowley and P S Kennan). A series of acid sheets crop out along the central spine of the Island (Lamplugh, 1903; Simpson, 1964) and may be related to the granitic bodies described above, or to underlying granites. A third granitic body is present at Oatlands in the southeast of the Island [SC 323 725]. Now poorly exposed, it was described by Lamplugh (1903) as ranging in composition from diorite to granite. The basic intrusive complex which crops out at Poortown [SC 269 832] comprises dykes and sills of pyroxene-rich and plagioclase-rich dolerite and plagioclase-phyric andesite. It is attributed to the widespread volcanic activity associated with subduction of the Iapetus Ocean during the late Ordovician (Piper et al., 1999; Power and Crowley, 1999).\n\nGravity data (Figure 7) indicate that substantial, low density plutons underlie the granite outcrops at Foxdale and Dhoon ((Figure 4); Cornwell, 1972). Cornwell’s (1972) model for the Foxdale pluton extended to a depth of about 10 km, and had a relatively shallow roof region underlying an area about 10 km long (in a north-east–south-west direction) by 4 to 5 km wide. Samples from the Dhoon granite have an average density of 2.71 Mgm−3, which is similar to that of the surrounding Manx Group (2.73 Mgm−3). The density contrast is insufficient to explain the observed anomaly, so it is necessary to postulate that the exposed granite is underlain by a lower density component (Cornwell, 1972). Although there is some evidence of a relative gravity low along the axis of the Island between the two plutons, the sharp gradient on its north-west side indicates that it is likely to be the result of density contrasts within the exposed Lower Palaeozoic rocks or shallow underlying basement rather than related to deep-seated granite components (Cornwell, 1972). This feature may therefore be a further shallow expression of the Barrule Thrust Zone (Kimbell and Quirk, 1999). Furthermore, the gravity data (Figure 7) suggest that emplacement of the Foxdale and Dhoon bodies was perhaps controlled by the intersection of the Barrule Thrust Zone and northwest-trending basement ‘transfer’ structures.\n\nAlthough the Foxdale and Dhoon bodies lie within the north-east-trending belt of magnetic disturbance along the axis of the Island (Figure 6), magnetic field variations over the shallow parts of the plutons are small compared with other parts of the disturbance, so it is unlikely that the granitic rocks are the source of the anomalies. Magnetic basic intrusive rocks of probable Ordovician age occur at Poortown [SC 269 832], but airborne (Figure 6) and ground magnetic surveys (Piper et al., 1999) indicate that this is a small, isolated occurrence which does not lie within the main anomaly belt.\n\nFurther magnetic Caledonian intrusions occur in the Manx region to the north of the Iapetus Suture; the Portencorkrie diorite–granodiorite complex is exposed on the Rhins of Galloway [NX 090 350] and a similar, but concealed, body may be the source of a circular magnetic anomaly about 20 km to the south-south-west, just south of the North Channel Basin (Stone, 1995).\n\nMoho\n\nThe seismic reflection Moho beneath Laurentian crust is not clearly imaged on the deep seismic data (WINCH 2), but to the south it becomes clearer. Beneath the wedge of Avalonian crust that lies under the Iapetus Convergence Zone (Figure 5), the Moho lies at about 9 seconds of two way travel time (approximately 28 km depth), deepening gradually southwards to about 10 seconds of two way travel time (about 31 km depth), south of the Isle of Man. The seismic reflection evidence is somewhat at variance with data from the CSSP deep refraction profile (Figure 4), which indicate a rapid increase in seismic velocity from 6.8 kms−1 at 24 km to 7.8 kms−1 at 26 km depth. The refraction velocity field was interpreted as a shallow Moho by Jacob et al. (1985), but Lewis (1986) interpreted the data as signifying a high velocity lower crust. The latter could be caused by either pervasive intrusion or underplating of the lower crust with mafic material. Both are consistent with the Palaeogene igneous episode (Chapter 8) and the latter is consistent with the proposed Paleocene epeirogenic uplift which affected the region (Chapter 4). The gravity evidence supports the presence of an area of crust characterised by either a relatively shallow Moho or dense lower crust, centred about 80 km south-east of the Isle of Man (compare with Cope, 1994).\n\nChapter 3 Lower Palaeozoic\n\nThe Caledonian basement rocks cropping out over much of the Isle of Man and its nearshore area comprise a thick pile of Lower Palaeozoic metasedimentary strata. They are mainly turbiditic rocks dominated by laminated mudstone and siltstone but varying from mudstone to units composed largely of thin- to medium-bedded, typically fine-grained sandstone. Debrite (pebbly mudstone) composed of intrabasinal material also occurs in parts of the succession. Volcanic rocks form a minor component of the succession locally. The succession is essentially steeply dipping to vertical and north-north-east- to east-northeast-striking such that outcrops of the different formations lie parallel to the axis of the Island (Figure 3). In detail, however, the dip varies widely due to folding.\n\nThe history of geological research on the Lower Palaeozoic rocks of the Isle of Man was reviewed by Ford et al. (1999). Until recently these rocks were thought to be entirely of Ordovician (Arenig) age and broadly equivalent to the Skiddaw Group of north-west England (e.g. Harkness and Nicholson, 1866; Cooper et al., 1995), although the ‘Manx Slate Series’ was separately designated by Lamplugh (Geological Survey, 1898; Lamplugh, 1903). In line with modern nomenclature, the term ‘Manx Group’ was introduced by Simpson (1968). However, Howe (1999) showed that part of the succession is Silurian (probably Wenlock) in age and hence it has since been separated as the ‘Dalby Group’ (Morris et al., 1999). Minor intrusions are abundant, many predating or contemporaneous with late Silurian or early Devonian deformation of the succession. Three large granitic intrusions range from syn-tectonic to post-tectonic and may represent a much larger granitic body at depth (see Chapter 2).\n\nThe primary geological survey of the Isle of Man was carried out in the 1890s by G W Lamplugh, and a map at the scale of one inch to one mile was published (Geological Survey, 1898) (Figure 9) as well as a substantial memoir (Lamplugh, 1903). Together with his field maps and interpreted clean copies this still provides the most comprehensive and detailed set of observations available on the geology of the Island and all subsequent work has drawn heavily on this information. Within his ‘Manx Slate Series’, Lamplugh distinguished four mappable lithostratigraphical units (Figure 9), intercalated with an otherwise undivided succession of variably laminated mudrocks. Two units, part of the ‘Lonan Flags’ on the south-east of the Island and the ‘Niarbyl Flags’ on the north-west coast, comprise interbedded sandstone and mudstone and were tentatively correlated as the lowest exposed part of the succession. Much of the succession considered to overlie the flags was undivided but three facies were distinguished. Sporadic outcrops dominated by quartz arenite were mapped as the ‘Agneash and other Grits’ and outcrops of black mudstone were mapped as the ‘Barrule Slates’. A facies now recognised as pebbly mudstone was regarded by Lamplugh (1903, pp.55–71; Lamplugh and Watts, 1895) as being of tectonic origin and mapped as ‘crush-conglomerate’ without primary stratigraphical significance. Lamplugh considered the large-scale structure of the Island to be a ‘synclinorium’ with a north-east-trending hinge along the centre of the Island to explain the repetition of the outcrop of Barrule Slates and correlation of the Lonan and Niarbyl flags. In detail, the outcrop pattern was considered to be controlled by intense upright folding, locally causing near horizontal sheet dip.\n\nBlake (1905) proposed that the ‘crush-conglomerates’ of Lamplugh (1903) were primary fragmental deposits, based on their association with a host sedimentary rock of dark mudstone and their limited stratigraphical range. He considered that the succession from the Agneash Grit upwards was repeated by large reverse faults rather than by folding, although he suggested that the flags formed an unconformable cover to this assemblage.\n\nThere was a hiatus in study of the Manx Group until the 1950s. Way-up evidence was used for the first time by Gillott (1956) to confirm Lamplugh’s view that the Lonan Flags passed stratigraphically up into the Agneash Grits. He substantiated Blake’s views on the origin of the breccia units and their stratigraphical position above the Barrule Slates, and defined two higher units, the Sulby Flags and the Cronk Sumark Slates, in the north of the Island. Detailed consideration of the structure was undertaken by Simpson (1963), broadly following Lamplugh’s ideas but invoking a large, relatively simple syncline refolded by later structures. Simpson also added to the stratigraphical subdivision (Figure 10).\n\nFossils had thus far played little part in consideration of the Manx Group, being mostly either of dubious organic origin or trace fossils of little value for dating (Lamplugh, 1903, pp.89–95). A single early Ordovician graptolite specimen from Cronk Sumark (Bolton, 1899; Rushton, 1993) proved the age of the succession and the general correlation with the Skiddaw Group. Studies of microfossil assemblages (Downie and Ford, 1966; Molyneux, 1979) eventually provided a major advance. Diagnostic microfloras from a few localities (Molyneux, 1979, 1999) demonstrated that earlier structural models of the Manx Group were untenable but the new data were insufficient to establish an alternative model. Speculation on the structure and stratigraphy therefore continued (e.g. Roberts et al., 1990; Cooper et al., 1995), although a new graptolite locality in the Lonan Flags (Rushton, 1993) supported the early Arenig age assigned to that unit.\n\nA further attempt in the mid-1990s to resolve the stratigraphy and structure of the Manx Group (Woodcock et al., 1999a) was based primarily on studies of the coastal sections but also extended into some inland areas. A parallel PhD thesis study by Burnett (1999) covered more of the inland outcrop. Lithostratigraphical subdivision of the Ordovician rocks was formalised by Woodcock et al. (1999c), based where possible on the previous nomenclature of Lamplugh (1903) and Simpson (1963). Previously, the same lithostratigraphical terms had been applied to similar rock types in separate outcrops, suggesting repetition by faulting or folding and precluding the possibility of facies repetition at different levels in the succession. Consequently, Woodcock et al. (1999c) introduced new lithostratigraphical names where correlation between outcrops could not be demonstrated. Particular attention was paid to identifying strati-graphical contacts and the order of succession, but the work met with limited success owing to poor way-up control in some formations and faulting in coastal exposures. Because of the limited biostratigraphical control and the possibility that major strike-parallel faults separate the lithostratigraphical units it was important to allow for some degree of uncertainty in the stratigraphical classification. This was achieved through the characterisation of the successions in a series of north-east-trending tracts (Figure 11) within which there was reasonable certainty of stratigraphical continuity but between which no continuity could be demonstrated and faulted boundaries were demonstrable or possible (Fitches et al., 1999; Woodcock et al., 1999c). A few tracts contain evidence of an Arenig age whereas others remain undated. However, the westernmost tract, comprising the Niarbyl Formation (formerly the Niarbyl Flags), was shown from sedimentological and biostratigraphical evidence (Morris et al., 1999) to be Wenlock in age and was separated from the Manx Group into a newly defined ‘Dalby Group’. This had major implications for the large-scale structure as it removed any possibility of correlation with the Lonan Formation. Rocks in the northern part of the Manx Group outcrop, only exposed inland between Kirk Michael and Ramsey, were not incorporated into the new lithostratigraphical scheme proposed by Woodcock et al. (1999c), although an interpretation of this area was proposed by Quirk and Burnett (1999).\n\nThe development of the new 1:50 000 Series geological map of the Isle of Man (BGS, 2001) focused on the principal uncertainties of the Woodcock et al. (1999c) model. Fieldwork was supported by palynological analysis of 130 rock samples representing most of the main Ordovician units (Molyneux, 2001). The lithostratigraphical units defined by Woodcock et al. (1999c) in the coastal sections have been traced inland and the nomenclature rationalised where appropriate (Figure 3). The significance of the interpreted tract boundaries was investigated through further examination of relationships in the field, and by inference from the additional biostratigraphical control. Observations made by Lamplugh (recorded on his field maps, at six inches to one mile, and clean copies) were used where no modern information was available, and the location of most of the dykes, mineral veins and mine entries are based on his maps. Where possible, dyke rock nomenclature has been revised, based on a re-examination of Lamplugh’s original thin sections by G M Power.\n\nThis account of the Ordovician rocks (Manx Group) of the Isle of Man is based partly on new work and otherwise draws on Woodcock et al. (1999c). The description of the Silurian rocks (Dalby Group) is summarised from Morris et al. (1999).\n\nRegionally, the Manx Group is equivalent to the Skiddaw Group in north-west England (Cooper et al., in press) and the Ribband Group in south-east Ireland (McConnell et al., 1999). These all represent deposits formed on the continental margin of Avalonia, at the southern margin of the Iapetus Ocean. Although of broadly similar facies, the stratigraphy is different in detail in the three areas indicating deposition in localised sedimentary systems. The turbidite deposits of the Dalby Group are a fragment of a succession that was deposited in mid- to late Silurian times across both the Avalonian and Laurentian margins during the final stages of closure of the Iapetus Ocean. They are equivalent to the mid-Silurian part of the Windermere Group in north-west England and the Riccarton Group in southern Scotland (Barnes et al., 1999).\n\nDeformation of the deposits formed at the northern margin of the Iapetus Ocean occurred progressively during the Ordovician and Silurian as the oceanic crust was subducted beneath Laurentia (e.g. Barnes et al., 1989; Barnes and Stone, 1999). The deposits on the southern margin were subjected to periodic upheaval, disrupting the succession and causing major unconformites (e.g. Stone et al., 1999). However, pervasive cleavage-forming deformation did not occur until the early Devonian when the Avalonian margin was eventually thrust beneath the leading edge of the Laurentian plate.\n\nManx Group\n\nThe term Manx Group was introduced by Simpson (1968) and is equivalent to the ‘Manx Slate Series’ of Lamplugh (1903). It was redefined by Woodcock et al. (1999c) to exclude rocks shown to be of Silurian age, and twelve component formations were defined, although an area in the north of the outcrop was not mapped. Work to redraw the geological map (BGS, 2001a) allowed rationalisation of this stratigraphy. The succession is disrupted by several strike-parallel faults. The oldest and youngest rocks, the Glen Dhoo Formation and the Lady Port Formation, respectively, crop out in close proximity in the north of the outcrop (Figure 3). Otherwise, the rocks occur in a northwest-younging succession across the Island, although this too is disrupted by faults which are interpreted to repeat parts of the succession.\n\nGlen Dhoo Formation\n\nThis formation was originally distinguished by Simpson (1963) as the ‘Glen Dhoo Flags’, and partly recognised by Woodcock et al. (1999c) and Quirk and Burnett (1999) as the ‘Glen Dhoo and Glion Cam units’. It is lithologically similar in many respects to the Lonan Formation and the two overlap substantially in age; they may therefore be equivalent.\n\nThe Glen Dhoo Formation is generally relatively poorly exposed. The type area is at the upper end of Glen Dhoo around [SC 3498 8995]. A small quarry [SC 2908 8761] and adjacent road cuttings at Glion Cam provide a subsidiary section through one of the sandstone-rich units. Volcanic rocks tentatively assigned to this formation are exposed in a disused quarry south-west of Peel [SC 238 833] and in a structurally isolated outcrop at Ballaquane [SC 225 790].\n\nThe Glen Dhoo Formation is typically composed of mudstone with a variable proportion of pale grey to white siltstone in laminae to very thin beds (normally less than 0.5 cm thick). Mudstone generally dominates, with approximately 10 to 30 per cent siltstone, although some sections appear to be composed predominantly of poorly laminated or homogeneous green-grey siltstone. Thin beds of fine-grained, quartzitic sandstone also occur, some of which are planar to ripple cross-laminated. Locally, for example at Glion Cam and on the north flank of Slieau Dhoo [SC 3498 8995], grey, very fine- to fine-grained immature sandstone is dominant in successions that consist of thin to very thick (up to 2 m), massive to planar-laminated beds interbedded with laminated mudstone and siltstone.\n\nBoth of the occurrences of volcanic rocks included within the Glen Dhoo Formation were previously included within the Niarbyl Flags by Simpson (1963). However, Molyneux (1979) recovered an Arenig microflora from Peel quarry and they were therefore excluded from the Silurian Niarbyl Formation by Morris et al. (1999). Volcanic breccia intercalated with mudstone and siltstone in Peel quarry was first noted by Simpson (1963). There is little exposure at the present day but large blocks of andesite breccia within mudstone can be seen at the south end of the quarry [SC 2383 8333], and are interpreted as a syndepositional volcanic breccia. The microflora from this locality, first interpreted by Molyneux (1979) as late Arenig but now regarded as latest Tremadoc to early Arenig (Molyneux, 1999, 2001), is consistent with its inclusion in the Glen Dhoo Formation. A volcanic breccia composed of clasts of plagioclase-phyric andesite and glassy material in a fine-grained matrix including feldspar crystal debris had previously been noted at Ballaquane by Lamplugh (1903, p.163). Exposures are found in a small area [SC 225 790] close to the faulted contact between the Creggan Moar and Niarbyl formations, but no contact relationships are seen. Owing to similarities with the volcanic breccia exposed in the Peel quarry and the absence of other evidence of volcanic rocks in the adjacent formations, this outcrop is regarded as a sliver of the Glen Dhoo Formation within the Niarbyl Fault zone.\n\nAll of the exposed contacts of the Glen Dhoo Formation are faulted, and its internal structure is largely unknown due in part to the relatively poor exposure. The thickness of the Glen Dhoo Formation is thus difficult to determine, but it is likely to be at least several hundred metres.\n\nThe first constraints on the age of the rocks now attributed to the Glen Dhoo Formation were provided by latest Tremadoc to early Arenig acritarchs (Plate 2) obtained by Molyneux (1979, 1999) from Peel quarry and Slieau Curn. Supplemented by new collections (Molyneux, 2001), this age has been confirmed by acritarch assemblages from several localities extending along the length of the outcrop. The oldest floras may be those from the sandstone-rich facies at Glion Cam [SC 2908 8760], where an association of Acanthodiacrodium, Cymatiogalea (C. cuvillierii?) and Timofeevia? suggests a Tremadoc age. Mudstone intercalations with volcanic rocks in Peel quarry [SC 2386 8334] yielded abundant and reasonably well-preserved acritarchs originally interpreted as late Arenig to early Llanvirn age (Molyneux, 1979). However, based on subsequent work on comparable Lake District assemblages, Molyneux (1999) reinterpreted the assemblage as latest Tremadoc or earliest Arenig, equivalent to the upper part of the messaoudensis–trifidum Biozone or the trifidum–bohemicum Biozone (Cooper et al., in press). Reasonably diverse and abundant but poorly preserved acritarch assemblages from Slieau Curn [SC 3453 9157] and Bishop’s Demesne [SC 3386 9181] (Molyneux, 2001) are early Arenig, either from the highest subzone of the messaoudensis–trifidum Biozone or the trifidum–bohemicum Biozone.\n\nThe acritarch assemblages from the Glen Dhoo Formation are closely comparable with assemblages from the Santon Member (Lonan Formation). They suggest correlation with the upper part of the Araneograptus murrayi Biozone, the Tetragraptus phyllograptoides Biozone, or the lower part of the Didymograptus varicosus Biozone.\n\nLonan Formation\n\nLamplugh (1903) designated much of the Manx Group outcrop on the south-eastern side of the Isle of Man as ‘Lonan Flags’ (Figure 9). Woodcock et al. (1999c), working mainly on the extensive coastal sections, divided this into four formations (Figure 11) which reflected lithological variations and uncertainty as to how parts of the exposure were related. However, resurvey work showed that the lithological variability extends inland and that distinction between the formations could not be supported. This has led to re-establishment of the term Lonan Formation for the whole outcrop, although the distinct units exposed at the coast are retained as members.\n\nThe Lonan Formation consists of mainly thin- to very thin-bedded or thickly laminated, fine-grained sandstone or siltstone and mudstone couplets (e.g. (Plate 3)). The proportion of sandstone varies from 25 to 80 per cent. Each sandstone bed typically has a sharp base and grades from light grey cross-laminated fine-grained wacke through parallel-laminated silt-stone into dark grey mudstone, in some cases burrow-mottled. Convolute lamination is common in the cross-laminated divisions. Bedding surfaces commonly show straight-crested to undulatory, asymmetric current ripples. The graded beds of the type Lonan Formation are interpreted as the product of deposition from low-concentration turbidity currents in an oxygenated deep-marine environment.\n\nThe formation also contains sporadic units dominated by thin- to medium-bedded, fine-grained sandstone. Three relatively persistent, well-exposed units are distinguished as the Keristal, Santon and Ny Garvain members but this facies also occurs locally inland, for example in Ballaglass Glen [SC 4655 8974] and Crosby quarry [SC 3253 7920].\n\nThe base of the Lonan Formation does not occur at outcrop, but at least 2500 m of strata are exposed between the core of the Dhoon Anticline and the highest part of the Santon Member. The top of the Lonan Formation is best defined by the transition into the dominantly quartz arenite-bearing Creg Agneash and Mull Hill formations in the north-east and south of the Island, respectively. The boundary is more subtle in the area west of Douglas where these formations are absent and the Lonan Formation passes directly into the Maughold Formation.\n\nThe age of the Lonan Formation beneath the Santon Member is constrained by new acritarch floras from several localities (Molyneux, 2001), supplementing preexisting data from the Santon Member (see below). Samples from Langness, around [SC 2871 6571], yielded sparse and poorly preserved acritarchs, including Stelliferidium trifidum?, which suggest a possible late Tremadoc to early Arenig age. Material from Cass ny Hawin around [SC 2992 6925], directly beneath the Keristal Member, and Douglas Bay about [SC 3895 7700], also below the Keristal Member, yielded poorly preserved acritarchs. These include diacromorph acritarchs such as Acanthodiacrodium, and herkomorphs such as Stelliferidium, which are characteristic of Tremadoc assemblages although are not restricted to microfloras of that age. However, a Tremadoc age is likely from the absence of any post-Tremadoc forms in these assemblages and from the position of the sample localities below the Santon Member.\n\nKeristal Member\n\nThis distinctive unit was defined by Woodcock et al. (1999c) at the west side of Keristal Bay [SC 3505 7296], north-east of Port Soderick. It is only a few metres thick, but exposures at a number of other localities show that it is laterally persistent over 15 km beneath the Santon Member. A very similar unit is exposed near the base of the Ny Garvain Member in Port Cornaa [SC 4736 8786]. If the Ny Garvain and Santon members can be correlated then this too may be the Keristal Member.\n\nThe member comprises a discrete packet of between six and fourteen medium to very thick beds of distinctive pale, fine-grained quartz arenite or quartz wacke. The beds are ungraded or weakly graded, commonly massive or with parallel-lamination, but in some cases with ripple cross-lamination in thinner beds. They may be organised in either thinning-up or thickening-up sequences. In thinning-up sequences, the basal bed is commonly strongly erosional into underlying thin-bedded turbidites.\n\nThe Keristal Member was interpreted by Woodcock and Barnes (1999) as the product of a short-lived system of high- to medium-concentration turbidity flows, probably tapping a source of clean quartz sand that was distinct from the muddy sands more typical of the Lonan Formation.\n\nThe Keristal Member is probably Tremadoc or earliest Arenig in age, based on acritarch assemblages from the underlying Lonan Formation at Cass ny Hawin and Douglas Bay (see above) and early Arenig microfloras from the overlying Santon Member.\n\nSanton Member\n\nThis member was originally named the Santon Formation by Woodcock et al. (1999c) and Woodcock and Barnes (1999) after coastal sections around Santon Head [SC 3328 7022]. It is well exposed in coastal sections from Onchan Head [SC 4026 7729] to Purt Veg [SC 3236 7030] where it crops out in the core of the Douglas Syncline. Although the top of the Santon Member is above the present erosion level, the exposed successions are up to about 600 m thick. It is characterised by medium-or thick-bedded, light grey or light greenish grey wacke (Plate 4) intercalated with a thin-bedded facies more typical of the Lonan Formation. Sandstone beds grade from fine- or very fine-grained sandstone into the intervening mudstone. Parallel- and ripple cross-lamination is common and some bed bases preserve flute marks and horizontal burrows. The graded beds are interpreted as deposits from high- to medium-concentration turbidity flows within the background of low-concentration events. An unusually thick-bedded, relatively coarse-grained sandstone succession about 50 m thick, which occurs in the Santon Member at Purt Veg [SC 3255 7037], was interpreted by Woodcock and Barnes (1999) as the fill of a trunk distributary channel in the turbidite system.\n\nThe wacke that dominates the member is particularly quartzose in places. Locally (e.g. at The Whing [SC 3603 7330]), isolated beds or packets of medium to thick beds of quartz arenite punctuate a less mature wacke succession.\n\nAcritarchs were first recorded from the Santon Member at Wallberry Hill [SC 370 375] and on the Marine Drive [SC 3715 7353] by Downie and Ford (1966) and Molyneux (1979, 1999). In the absence of comparative empirical data, Molyneux (1979) concluded that the assemblage might occur close to the Tremadoc–Arenig series boundary. Subsequent work in the Lake District has produced more detailed information on acritarch ranges (Cooper et al., in press). The Santon Member assemblage is now considered to correlate with the trifidum–bohemicum or upper part of the messaoudensis–trifidum Biozone, indicating a probable early Arenig age (Molyneux, 1999). This is equivalent to some assemblages from the Glen Dhoo Formation (e.g. from Slieau Curn and Bishop’s Demesne) and implies correlation with the earliest Arenig Tetragraptus phyllograptoides Biozone or a slightly higher level.\n\nRushton (1993) reported graptolites from the Santon Member at Baltic Rock [SC 3270 7023] but owing to their poor preservation they did not provide any information beyond indicating an Arenig age.\n\nNy Garvain Member\n\nThe name ‘Ny Garvain Formation’ was introduced by Woodcock et al. (1999c) for the north-eastern part of the Lonan Formation, in recognition of compositional and structural uncertainty over its correlation with the rest of the Lonan Formation (Barnes et al., 1999; Fitches et al., 1999; Woodcock and Barnes, 1999). In revision of the 1:50 000 map (BGS, 2001), the name is restricted to a package of relatively thickly bedded sandstone which crops out along the coast southwards from the headland of Gob ny Garvain [SC 4885 8986]. It is possible, however, that the Ny Garvain Member is equivalent to the Santon Member farther south.\n\nThe member is sandstone-dominated, with a high proportion of fine- to medium-grained wacke in medium to thick beds with very thin muddy partings in successions interspersed with packets of thin-bedded sandstone–mudstone couplets. Typical beds are sharp based, with a lower division of green-grey ripple cross-laminated fine-grained sandstone passing sharply up into interlaminated sand and dark grey mudstone. Convolute lamination is common in the cross-laminated divisions, which show current ripples on bedding surfaces. Thicker beds have a massive or weakly graded lower part. Most of the Ny Garvain Member was largely deposited from low- to medium-concentration turbidity currents.\n\nAlthough the sandstone is generally quartz-rich, a discrete package a few metres thick of distinctive, thick to very thick irregular beds of pale quartz arenite occurs at the base of the member at Port Cornaa [SC 4728 8778], forming a unit similar to the Keristal Member. A few medium to thin beds of quartz arenite also occur west of Gob Ny Garvain [SC 4880 9015], although here they are interspersed with the wacke beds over a section about 10 m thick.\n\nThe member is incompletely exposed in a folded succession at the coast, thus making thickness determinations difficult. About 250 m of continuous succession are exposed in a steeply dipping limb near Port Cornaa. The base of the member is best exposed at Port Cornaa where bedding thickens upwards from the undifferentiated thin-bedded Lonan Formation to the west. The top of the member is not exposed or faulted, although an upward-thinning sequence along the south side of Port Mooar, west of Gob ny Garvain, may represent its transition back into more typical, thin-bedded strata of the Lonan Formation.\n\nThe age of the Ny Garvain Member is not constrained directly. A sample from Gob ny Garvain [SC 4881 8982] yielded a single possible acritarch fragment (Molyneux, 2001), but this is of no biostratigraphical significance. However, based on its strati-graphical position in the Lonan Formation, the member is likely to be of late Tremadoc or early Arenig age.\n\nCreg Agneash Formation\n\nThe formation was named by Woodcock et al. (1999c) from Creg Agneash [SC 4295 8705] and equates to the north-eastern outcrop of ‘Agneash Grits’ mapped by Lamplugh (Figure 9). It is best exposed at Maughold Head [SC 4986 9142] where the gradational base and top of the formation are exposed, although there are many natural inland exposures of the formation (Lamplugh, 1903, pp.39–42) and there are quarry exposures at Dreemskerry [SC 4760 9112] and Windy Corner [SC 3900 8400].\n\nThe formation is characterised by white quartz arenite, typically thin or medium bedded, but in some localities includes thick or very thick beds. In the lower part of the formation, the quartz arenite beds occur within a background of laminated siltstone–mudstone that persists from the underlying Lonan Formation. This gives way upwards to very thin but persistent interbeds of a dark grey silty mudstone. The sandstone beds are massive or weakly graded from medium or fine sand to very fine sand or silt. Internal structure is typically a weakly defined, upward-thinning parallel-lamination (1–2 cm at base to millimetre-scale at top), in some cases with a thin ripple cross-laminated division at the top. Slump folding on a scale of tens of centimetres to metres is commonly developed, with close to tight disharmonic folds of widely varying orientation occurring within the same exposure. The Creg Agneash Formation was interpreted by Woodcock et al. (1999c) as the depositional product of medium-concentration turbidity currents punctuating a persistent background of low-concentration events.\n\nThe Creg Agneash Formation is about 180 m thick at Maughold Head, although the base is faulted. The outcrop width increases to the south-west where the formation may be as much as 750 m thick, although there may be some repetition caused by folding or faulting. The outcrop of the formation dies out northwest of Douglas, to the south-west of which it is absent. The Mull Hill Formation, which crops out along strike to the south-west, is lithologically similar and may be a lateral equivalent.\n\nThe base of the formation is a stratigraphical transition from the Lonan Formation. This is exposed in the River Laxey [SC 4183 8670] and on the coast south of Traie Foillan [SC 4983 9130] at Maughold Head, although the latter is complicated by faulting. At both localities, thin to medium quartz arenite beds gradually appear over several tens of metres or more within very thin-bedded or laminated sandstone/siltstone and mudstone typical of the Lonan Formation. At the base of the formation, the number of quartz arenite beds increases until they become the dominant lithology. The top of the formation, exposed at Traie Carn [SC 4970 9158], is transitional into the Maughold Formation with the sandstone beds progressively decreasing in number before abruptly giving way to laminated silty mudstone.\n\nThe Creg Agneash Formation is not dated other than by its situation above the Tremadoc to early Arenig Lonan Formation. Material from Windy Corner Quarry [SC 3901 8396] yielded a fragment of a possible sphaeromorph acritarch (Molyneux, 2001) but this is not diagnostic. However, sparse, low-diversity acritarch assemblages are a characteristic of the lower Arenig (Didymograptus varicosus Biozone) in the Lake District (Cooper et al., in press).\n\nMull Hill Formation\n\nThe formation was named after Mull Hill [SC 1897 6757] by Woodcock et al. (1999c). It is well exposed in coastal sections on the Cregneash peninsula. Lamplugh (1903, pp.42–43) used the term ‘Mull Hill Grits’ informally although he ultimately grouped these rocks with the other quartz arenite units as ‘Agneash Grits’. Simpson (1963) separated two ‘quartzite’ outcrops, at Mull Hill and the Chasms, within his ‘Maughold Banded Group’ However, as originally interpreted by Lamplugh, these are fold repetitions of the same unit (Fitches et al., 1999). Quartzose arenite exposed at Spaldrick [SC 1940 6963], Port Erin, was also included within the Mull Hill Formation by Woodcock et al. (1999c), although there is some doubt about the structural continuity of this outcrop with the others.\n\nThe formation is characterised by light grey to white, medium- to very thick-bedded quartz arenite, contrasting strongly with the thin or very thin-bedded facies of the underlying Lonan Formation. Each sandstone bed grades up from medium-grained sandstone to very fine sandstone or siltstone, with thin or absent mudstone partings. A few beds have coarse- to very coarse-grained sandstone bases with mudstone rip-up clasts. Beds are typically massive to parallel-laminated at the base with an overlying cross-laminated division, interpreted as the product of deposition from high- and medium-concentration turbidity currents.\n\nThe Mull Hill Formation overlies the Lonan Formation with a gradational depositional contact over about 25 m. Woodcock et al. (1999c) estimated the thickness of the formation to be between 350 m and 400 m across Mull Hill. The quartzose sandstone packet at Spaldrick, interpreted as a lateral margin of the Mull Hill turbidite system, is about 40 m thick. However, the top of the formation is not exposed.\n\nThe Mull Hill Formation is not dated other than by its interpreted situation above the Tremadoc to early Arenig Lonan Formation. Two localities, north of Gansey Point [SC 2152 6843] and Cregneash quarry [SC 1909 6741], have yielded undiagnostic sphaeromorph acritarchs (Molyneux, 2001). Similarly sparse, low diversity acritarch assemblages are characteristic of the lower Arenig (Didymograptus varicosus Biozone) in the Lake District (Cooper et al., in press).\n\nMaughold Formation\n\nThe unit was named by Woodcock et al. (1999c) following Simpson’s (1963) term ‘Maughold Banded Group’. Woodcock et al. (1999c) took the type section as the coast west of Port Lewaigue [SC 4630 9328 to 4682 9304], but this is now considered to lie within the Injebreck Formation. The Maughold Formation is exposed in largely inaccessible cliff sections from east of Port e Vullen [SC 4743 9284] to the contact with the Creg Agneash Formation at Traie Carn, and from north of Port Erin [SC 1916 6956] to the north flank of Gob ny Beinn [SC 2135 7320]. Most of the unit was mapped by Lamplugh (1903) as undivided ‘Manx Slate Series’, although parts of it containing significant amounts of quartz arenite were separated as ‘Agneash Grits’. In the south-west of the Island, Lamplugh also distinguished horizons of ‘crush-conglomerate’.\n\nThe Maughold Formation is dominated by dark grey mudstone in bedded or disrupted facies, but also includes significant amounts of quartz arenite. The laminated mudstone, typically with a millimetre-scale ‘pinstripe’ lamination, includes a variable proportion of pale grey siltstone in laminae to very thin beds and sporadic, thin to medium beds of fine-grained quartz arenite. Bioturbation is common as spots or as discordant silt-filled or mud-filled burrows. Pebbly mudstone is absent in the north-eastern part of the outcrop, but it becomes important to the south-west where it comprises about 65 per cent of the succession between Port Erin and Gob ny Beinn. Supported by the mudstone matrix, intraformational clasts are generally up to a few centimetres across and have a maximum size of 30 cm. They are mostly of shale, siltstone and fine-grained sandstone, with rare fragments of a fine-grained igneous rock. Bedded quartz arenite, locally dominant in packets up to about 25 m thick, resembles the Creg Agneash/Mull Hill facies. Pale or very pale greyish white, fine- to coarse-grained quartz arenite occurs in medium to thick beds. Pelitic interbeds include a few very thin beds of quartz arenite. The sandstone beds have sharp top and basal contacts. They are not discernibly graded and commonly contain tabular cross-sets through the thickness of each bed.\n\nThe mudstone in the Maughold Formation was interpreted by Woodcock et al. (1999c) as the product of hemipelagic fall-out and low-concentration turbidity flows into a deep-marine, periodically oxygenated basin. Owing to basin instability the bedded facies was locally resedimented as pebbly mudstone. Packets of quartzose sandstone accumulated by deposition from medium- to high-concentration turbidity flows.\n\nUncertainty about the structure precludes accurate thickness estimates of the Maughold Formation, although 500 to 600 m was suggested by Woodcock et al. (1999c). A gradational contact between the Maughold Formation and the underlying Creg Agneash Formation is exposed at Traie Carn [SC 4973 9158], and a similar relationship with the Mull Hill Formation is assumed although the contact at Port Erin is faulted. West of Douglas, where the overlying quartz arenite units are absent, a gradational contact with the Lonan Formation is interpreted. However, owing to the similarity of the facies in the two units this is difficult to define. The north-western contact of the Maughold Formation with the Barrule Formation is interpreted to be faulted (Figure 3), but an original stratigraphical relationship between the two formations seems likely.\n\nThe age of the Maughold Formation is poorly constrained other than by its interpreted position above the Tremadoc to early Arenig Lonan Formation. A sample from Port e Vullen [SC 4743 9275] yielded possible acritarchs that include an acanthomorph and a specimen of V. trispinosum? (Molyneux, 2001) which would indicate that it is not older than Arenig. Undiagnostic sphaeromorph acritarchs have also been recovered from Cregyn Doo [SC 2238 7375] and south-west of Cringle Reservoir [SC 2497 7395].\n\nBarrule Formation\n\nLamplugh (1903) delimited several separate outcrops of black mudstone on the Isle of Man, calling the lithotype ‘Barrule Slates’. Simpson (1963) retained this term for the most of the outcrops but separated those in the north as the ‘Slieau Managh Slates’. In several areas Simpson combined separate strands of black mudstone that had been distinguished by Lamplugh, to produce the pattern of two parallel outcrops of ‘Barrule Slates’ with a third outcrop in the north (Slieau Managh Slates) that has appeared on most maps published subsequently (e.g. Woodcock et al., 1999c; (Figure 11)). The northern outcrop was outwith the area considered by Woodcock et al. (1999c) although the name ‘Slieau Managh Slates’ was retained by Quirk and Burnett (1999). Woodcock et al. (1999c) separated the other outcrops into the Barrule Formation in the south-east and the Glen Rushen Formation to the north-west (Figure 11) on the grounds that their equivalence could not be demonstrated.\n\nThis distinction between the Barrule and the Glen Rushen formations has been supported by the recent work, but the northern outcrops (previously the Slieau Managh Slates) are now recognised as the Barrule Formation (BGS, 2001). The two separate, parallel discontinuous strands of the Barrule Formation (Figure 3), correctly mapped by Lamplugh (Geological Survey, 1898), are interpreted as thrust repetitions of a single unit (Figure 3).\n\nThe outcrops of the Barrule Formation form the upland ‘spine’ of the Isle of Man, from the west coast north-east of Burroo Mooar [SC 216 735] to Port Lewaigue [SC 468 930] near Ramsey; along this line of hills the formation is relatively well exposed. Lithologically it is remarkably homogeneous, consisting of medium to dark grey and black pelite, which generally appears to be massive. However, in clean, smooth exposures a faint but persistent parallel, diffuse lamination can be seen, defined by slight colour variations and unaffected by bioturbation. The Barrule Formation is interpreted as hemipelagic mud deposited into anoxic bottom water.\n\nThe thickness of the formation is conjectural in the absence of evidence of way-up and internal structure and because the base is never seen. Simpson (1963) estimated a thickness of up to 1030 m whereas Woodcock et al. (1999c) calculated a thickness of 750 m by assuming that the succession is homoclinal. The maximum width of the outcrops is about 900 m, but the thickness may be substantially less if it is folded and/or internally thrust imbricated.\n\nThe boundaries of the Barrule Formation are commonly faulted or otherwise poorly exposed. The junction with the Maughold Formation was interpreted by Fitches et al. (1999) as a major fault. The south-eastern margin of the western strand is also a major fault, duplicating the outcrop of the Barrule Formation and the base of the Injebreck Formation. The top of the Barrule Formation is probably a gradational stratigraphical contact with the Injebreck Formation. This is best seen on the foreshore at Port Lewaigue [SC 4680 9300] (Plate 5), where faintly laminated black mudstone passes north into a few metres of a distinctive facies of laminated black mudstone with thin pale silty laminae at the base of the Injebreck Formation. A similar transitional facies is seen in discontinuous exposure at Injebreck [SC 3573 8423].\n\nThe age of the Barrule Formation is poorly constrained. A sample from Glen Auldyn [SC 4249 9243] yielded sparse acritarchs, in low diversity assemblages (Molyneux, 2001), including acanthomorph acritarchs, Lophosphaeridium?, sphaeromorph acritarchs and Veryhachium? (V. lairdii?, V. trispinosum?). A sample from a quarry south of Round Table [SC 2469 7519] yielded a single, poorly preserved fragment of a possible acanthomorph acritarch. These are not diagnostic, although Veryhachium trispinosum?, if correctly determined, ind"
