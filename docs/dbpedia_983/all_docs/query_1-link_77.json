        "text": "Day 1\n\nBask in the peace and beauty of the Cotswolds villages\n\nVenture through the wondrously rolling hills of the Welsh borders\n\nYou leave London and travel west to the rolling hills of the Cotswolds.\n\nThis area of outstanding natural beauty boasts England’s prettiest historic villages. Your friendly driver-guide ensures you get the best photos and hear the most fascinating local tales.\n\nYour first stop in Wales is Hay-on-Wye, the ‘town of books’, nestled just to the north of the Brecon Beacons National Park.\n\nThe route then leads to the beautiful Elan Valley and up into the Cambrian Mountains. From there, it’s an hour or so to the beautiful seaside town and cultural centre of Aberystwyth, where you spend the next two nights.\n\nDay 2\n\nAdmire the mountainous landscape of Snowdonia National Park\n\nExplore the ramparts of Harlech Castle\n\nTravel north into the mountainous Snowdonia National Park. You visit the beautiful village of Beddgelert, where you can see the grave of ‘Gelert’, the legendary dog.\n\nLater you travel to Harlech Castle. Built by King Edward I during his conquest of Wales nearly 800 years ago, this mighty fortress still stands overlooking the peaks of Snowdonia and the sea.\n\nAfter a fulfilling day in the mountains, you return to Aberystwyth in the late afternoon.\n\nDay 3\n\nWander around New Quay and wish you could move into this picturesque little town\n\nWalk in the footsteps of the famous Welsh poet, Dylan Thomas\n\nLeaving Aberystwyth, you travel around the coast of Cardigan Bay through the quaint town of Aberaeron, and to New Quay.\n\nA sandy harbour, whitewashed houses, and connections to Dylan Thomas: this town is one of the most picturesque and interesting little towns in Britain. What’s more, you may be lucky enough to spot dolphins and whales.\n\nYou then go inland to explore the Dinefwr Estate* (Newton House) and its ruined castle before heading for Wales’s south coast to visit Laugharne, where Dylan Thomas lived for the last few years of his life and wrote the famous play “Under Milk Wood”.\n\nFrom here, it’s a short distance to Tenby, the small, charming seaside town that’ll be your base for two nights.\n\n*When the Dinefwr Estate is closed, you visit Carreg Cennen Castle instead.\n\nDay 4\n\nVisit the only national park in Britain that’s dedicated to gorgeous coastline views\n\nStumble upon the grand cathedral of Britain’s smallest city, St Davids\n\nOur last full day in Wales is spent exploring the extreme southwest.\n\nYou see some of Britain’s most gorgeous coastlines at the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. This region is stunning and was the birthplace of both the patron saint of Wales and the Twdyr (anglicised to Tudor) royal dynasty.\n\nYou travel to the tiny cathedral city of St Davids for lunch and time for exploration, and you stop in the county town of Pembroke, where you can enter the thick medieval walls of the castle.\n\nFrom here we return once more to Tenby for a relaxed evening.\n\nDay 5\n\nDelve deep into history at the National History Museum\n\nWander around the quintessential Cotswold village of Castle Combe\n\nLeaving Tenby in the morning, you begin your return journey to London.\n\nYou travel past the big industrial cities of South Wales for a visit to the outdoor National Museum of History at St Fagans (public transport is available from the museum to central Cardiff for anyone who wishes to leave the tour at this point).\n\nFrom here, it’s time to say goodbye to Wales. You take the Severn Crossing back into England, where you have one final break at Castle Combe.\n\nThis gorgeous Cotswold village is perfect for a relaxed stroll amongst 16th-century ironstone cottages.\n\nFrom here, you head back to central London.\n\nWhere does this tour stay overnight?\n\nYou stay two nights in Aberystwyth and two nights in Tenby*.\n\n*Please be aware that Tenby is busy. You may need to be flexible with rooms we're able to reserve for you here. If you'd prefer to find your own accommodation for this location, please choose the 'book your own accommodation' option when you book your tour.\n\nHow can I book accommodation?\n\nAccommodation is not included in the price of your tour. To book accommodation, there are two options: either Rabbie’s Tours can book it for you, or you can book your own. For information on how to do this, please see the ‘Accommodation’ tab on FAQ page HERE.\n\nAlternatively, please email us your questions at tours@rabbies.com or call us on +44(0)131 226 3133.\n\nInformation you can find on the FAQ page, under the ‘Accommodation’ tab: types of accommodation, room types, the booking process, getting to and from your accommodation, and cancellation terms.\n\nHow much will the accommodation cost?\n\nWe book accommodation with third-party providers on your behalf and each property sets their own rates. Rates vary considerably depending on the accommodation standard, facilities, location, and local demand. We therefore can’t tell you exactly how much your accommodation will cost until your request has been allocated to a specific property.\n\nAs a guide, you can expect to pay the following prices, per person per night:\n\nNOTE: Prices quoted are for guidance only and may be higher on some occasions, especially for last-minute bookings and when demand is high (E.g. peak season, weekends, holidays, special events etc)\n\nBreakfast will be included unless otherwise noted. The type of breakfast provided will vary from place to place so you may receive either a full cooked breakfast, a continental style breakfast (E.g., toast, fruit, cereal), or a packed breakfast bag or tray (E.g., porridge pot, fruit, granola bar).\n\nDo you offer hotel pickups in the departure cities?\n\nThe UK and Ireland's historic city centres are full of narrow streets and winding roads. So, to speed up your departure, we only pick up from our central meeting points. What's more is leaving the city using the most direct route also reduces the carbon footprint of our tours.\n\nIs there parking close to the departure point?\n\nWe don't recommend bringing your car into the centre of our departure cities. It can be hard to find parking, and there are excellent public transportation services.\n\nWhen should I get to the departure point?\n\nArrive 15 minutes before your departure time. Due to waiting restrictions, we can't wait for you if you're late.\n\nWhat happens if I'm late or miss the tour?\n\nIf you're late for your tour, our cancellation policy applies. 100% charges are applicable, and you will not be entitled to a refund or alternative.\n\nWhat are your cancellation policies?\n\nYour cancellation terms depend on which tour you've booked.\n\nFor one-day tours: You'll receive a full refund if you cancel 24 hours or more before the tour departure\n\nFor tours of between two and nine days: You'll receive a 90% refund if you cancel 15 or more days before the tour departure\n\nFor tours of 10 or more days: You'll receive a 90% refund if you cancel 21 or more days before the tour departure\n\nFor all European packaged tours: You'll receive a 90% refund if you cancel 42 days before the tour departure.\n\nIf you cancel inside these notice periods, full charges will apply and no refunds will be issued.\n\nTo cancel your booking, email tours@rabbies.com as soon as possible. The effective date of cancellation will be the date we receive written confirmation from you.\n\nClick here to view terms and conditions\n\nCan Itineraries change?\n\nYour tour will always follow the itinerary as closely as possible. Your driver-guide will keep you up to date on the road, and we'll try to get in touch about any large changes prior to your departure.\n\nCan I pre-book a specific seat?\n\nDue to logistical reasons, we're unable to let you pre-book a seat on the bus. But our comfortable 16-seat mini-coaches have huge windows. So, you'll always get a good view.\n\nAre there toilets on the bus?\n\nUnfortunately, we have no on-board toilet facilities, but you'll have regular comfort breaks.\n\nHow do you cater for people with accessibility needs?\n\nWe aim to accommodate everyone. To read more information on how we do this, click here to go to our accessibility guide.\n\nDo you take children on your tours?\n\nWe regret we don't carry children under the age of five on our scheduled tours.\n\nYou can ask us about the tours we recommend for younger children. And if your child is less than 1.35m tall, you should let us know, so we can provide them with a suitable booster seat.\n\nHow much time do I get off the bus?\n\nWe want you to enjoy Britain and Ireland. And we believe the best way to do this is to get you off the mini-coach and out exploring. So, we give you plenty of time to take photos, go walking, and explore ancient ruins.\n\nWhy do you exclude visitor attractions?\n\nWe exclude visitor attractions in your tour price because it lets you travel your way. It means you can pamper yourself with a luxury lunch or skip an attraction whenever you feel like it.\n\nDo we need to bring our own lunch?\n\nYou don't need to. We stop in small towns, villages, and rural eateries where you can choose whatever meal pleases both your taste buds and your budget.\n\nShould I tip the driver-guide?\n\nLet's be honest, our driver-guides would never refuse a cheeky bonus. But it's up to you, and the amount is entirely at your discretion.\n\nWhat about travel insurance?\n\nWe advise you take out travel insurance.\n\nWhat is ABTOT?\n\nYou're protected by ABTOT when you chose to let us reserve your accommodation on a multi-day tour. This means you can claim back anything you've paid us if we become bankrupt. Read our terms and conditions for more information.\n\nI have more questions, who can help me?\n\nIf you have any more questions, call us on +44(0)131 226 3133, email tours@rabbies.com , or check out our full FAQs ."
