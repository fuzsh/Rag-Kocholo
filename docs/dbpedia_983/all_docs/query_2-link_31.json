Charles Nicholson, MP for Doncaster, was the only parliamentary member of the Alpine Club, formed in 1857 to promote mountaineering in that region. Many yachting clubs were represented, including the Royal Yacht Squadron, whose members included Godfrey Baring, MP for Isle of Wight (1906-10), the Royal Northern and Clyde and Royal Anglesey. Edwin Montagu, MP for Chesterton (1906-18), was the only Liberal MP to list his membership of the British Ornithologists’ Union. There were also echoes of the past. Thomas Lough represented the spirit of Irish Liberalism with his solo membership of St Stephen’s Green Club in Dublin. No Liberals represented Irish seats at this date; Lough was MP for Islington West (1892-1918)."
