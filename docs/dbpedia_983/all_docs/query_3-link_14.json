        "text": "Thomas Wayne Lough, 83, a cherished family man, passed away on April 24, 2024, in Lakeland, Florida. Born on July 9, 1940, in Springfield, Ohio, Thomas's life was marked by dedication, resilience, and a deep love for his family and country.\n\nThomas proudly served in the United States Army National Guard, a period that helped shape his strong character and sense of duty. After his military service, he embarked on a successful career in the corporate world, where his discipline and work ethic were greatly admired.\n\nMarried to Mary Evelyn Lough (n√©e Bean), for 39 wonderful years, Thomas was a devoted husband until her passing in 2008. He was a pillar of strength for his family, guiding and supporting his sons, Christopher (married to Brandi Lyn), Matthew (married to Angela Kay), and Todd Alan, through life's many challenges and joys. His role as a father extended to being a best friend to his sons, always there with a listening ear and wise advice, sometimes over a cold beer.\n\nThomas's legacy continues through his grandchildren, Christopher Thomas Lough Jr., Trevor Alan Lough, and Kyleigh Marie Lough. Though he outlived his siblings, Donald A. Lough, Shelton Lough Jr., William Lough, Dora Ryder, and Naomi Lough, who passed in childhood, the memories they shared will remain a treasured part of his family's history.\n\nAn avid lover of the outdoors, Thomas found joy in going to the beach, riding his motorcycle, and maintaining his health with daily walks of up to four miles. His interests also included watching NASCAR and football, activities that often brought family and friends together in spirited camaraderie.\n\nThomas was a man of principles, a cancer survivor who faced life's adversities with toughness and unwavering strength. His resilience was an inspiration to all who knew him, and his legacy of great character will be remembered by many.\n\nAlways busy, he was a handyman. His hands were not only skilled but also a symbol of his willingness to help others and his ability to create and maintain a warm and welcoming home.\n\nAs we bid farewell to Thomas Wayne Lough, we celebrate a life well-lived, marked by love, service, and an enduring spirit. He was a wonderful provider, a guiding light, and a true friend to all who were fortunate enough to cross his path. His memory will be cherished and kept alive in the hearts of his family, friends, and all who were touched by his remarkable presence.\n\nThomas's life will be honored in a private ceremony, where his family and close friends will gather to share stories, laughter, and tears, commemorating a man who was truly one of a kind. As we reflect on his journey, we take comfort in knowing that Thomas's spirit will continue to be a guide, just like stars continue to shine even after they have faded from view. Funeral arrangements were entrusted to Lanier Funeral & Cremation Services.\n\nTo send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of Thomas Wayne Lough, please visit our floral store."
