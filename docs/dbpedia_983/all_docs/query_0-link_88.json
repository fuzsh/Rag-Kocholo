A Republican, he ousted Bill Clinton from the governor's office in 1980, after Clinton had served one term as the state's chief executive. Clinton came back to defeat White in 1982, and again in 1986. White was known as the signer of a measure approved by the legislature requiring Arkansas teachers to include \"creation science\" in the curriculum if the theory of evolution was also taught. The law was later struck down as unconstitutional by a federal judge after a trial that drew national attention. In July 1998 Gov. Mike Huckabee appointed him state banking commissioner.\n\nWhite, Frederick (b. Feb. 16, 1847, Birmingham, England - d. Sept. 27, 1918, Ottawa, Ont.), commissioner of the Northwest Territories (1905-18).\n\nWhite, George (b. Aug. 21, 1872, Elmira, N.Y. - d.

April 21, 1888, Ottawa, Ont.), interior minister of Canada (1885-88). He was also superintendent-general of Indian affairs (1887-88).\n\nW. White\n\nWhite, Walter (Francis) (b. July 1, 1893, Atlanta, Ga. - d. March 21, 1955, New York City), executive secretary (1931-55) of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Blue-eyed and blond, he was only partially (5/32) of African descent, but went through life as a black by personal choice. In 1918 he joined the NAACP national staff, when James Weldon Johnson, the executive secretary, impressed by the young man, hired him as assistant secretary. After Johnson retired, White succeeded him. In 1930 he helped block Pres. Herbert Hoover's nomination of Judge John J. Parker of North Carolina for U.S. Supreme Court justice. The Senate rejected Parker, who was on record as being opposed to black suffrage, by a 41-39 vote. White was especially prominent in the campaign against lynching. Aided by his fair skin, he personally investigated 41 lynchings and 8 race riots while he was assistant secretary, earning a widespread reputation for courage and sagacity. He was a powerful lobbyist for a federal anti-lynching law. He pushed such a bill nearer to passage than ever before in 1938, when it was defeated only after seven weeks of filibuster by Southern senators. Although no law was enacted, he influenced the climate of public opinion with his exposés and propaganda. The recorded number of lynchings during the period of his activity dropped from 67 in 1918 to 3 in 1955; the crime had become obsolescent. In 1937 he was awarded the Spingarn Medal for his efforts. He was the author of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order on fair employment practices in war industry during World War II and was responsible for Pres. Harry Truman's stand on civil rights, which led to the Dixiecrat bolt, in 1948. He was also a member of the Advisory Council for Government of the Virgin Islands in 1934-35 and a consultant to U.S. delegations to the UN.\n\nWhiteaker, John (b. May 4, 1820, Dearborn county, Ind. - d. Oct. 2, 1902, Eugene, Ore.), governor of Oregon (1859-62).\n\nWhitefield, Gordon H(enry) (b. Jan. 24, 1920), administrator of Tristan da Cunha (1965-66).\n\nWhitehead, Sir Edgar (Cuthbert Fremantle) (b. Feb. 8, 1905, Berlin, Germany - d. Sept. 22, 1971, Newbury, Berkshire, England), prime minister of Southern Rhodesia (1958-62); knighted 1954. He was also minister of finance, posts, and telegraphs (1946-53) and leader of the opposition (1962-65).\n\nWhitehead, Sir Stanley Austin (b. Oct. 8, 1907, Reefton, N.Z. - d. Jan. 9, 1976, Nelson, N.Z.), New Zealand politician; knighted 1976. He was speaker of the House of Representatives (1973-75).\n\nWhitelaw\n\nWhitelaw (of Penrith in the County of Cumbria), William (Stephen Ian) Whitelaw, (1st) Viscount (b. June 28, 1918, Nairn, Scotland - d. July 1, 1999, Penrith, England), British politician. He served in World War II, winning the Military Cross as a tank battalion commander in the Scots Guards, and became a Conservative MP in 1955. \"Willie\" Whitelaw served as lord president of the council and leader of the House of Commons (1970-72) and Northern Ireland secretary (1972-73) under Prime Minister Edward Heath. He negotiated a power-sharing agreement designed to give the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland a stake in government, but the plan collapsed after a Protestant workers' general strike, leaving the province to be ruled from London for the next quarter-century. Under Margaret Thatcher he became deputy prime minister (1979-88) and home secretary (1979-83). He was considered a genial man, famously serene in the heat of political battle, and he became the cool and amiable anchor of the cabinet. He proved the perfect foil to Thatcher and she relied heavily on his judgment and diplomatic skills in quelling potential dissent among her MPs. She regularly turned to him at times of crisis and made him a member of all her key cabinet committees. \"Have a word with Willie\" and \"Willie is looking into it\" became her answers when political problems loomed on the horizon. He never claimed to have pushed through any landmark legislation, nor was he ever an ideas man. In 1983 he was made a viscount and moved to the more sedate surroundings of the House of Lords, becoming the Conservative leader there and again lord president of the council. His retirement from Thatcher's cabinet in 1988 after a stroke was seen as the moment when her premiership began to go wrong. She was removed by a revolt of her own MPs two years later. He was deputy leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1991.\n\nWhiteley, Sir Peter (John Frederick) (b. Dec. 13, 1920 - d. Feb. 1, 2016, England), lieutenant governor of Jersey (1979-84); knighted 1976.\n\nWhitelocke, John (b. 1757 - d. Oct. 23, 1833, Hall Barn Park, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, England), British governor of Saint-Domingue (1793-94). He is most notable for his command of the failed second expedition to the Río de la Plata (1807), where he was defeated by the Spanish viceroy Santiago de Liniers, and from where he returned in disgrace, being found guilty of several charges related to his command.\n\nB. Whiteman\n\nWhiteman, Bernard (Denzil), byname Ben Whiteman (b. Aug. 20, 1954), prime minister of Curaçao (2015-16). He was also minister of health and environment (2013-15).\n\nWhiteman, Unison (Leslie) (b. Sept. 23, 1939, Grenada - d. [executed] Oct. 19, 1983, St. George's, Grenada), foreign minister of Grenada (1981-83). He was also minister of agriculture and fisheries (1979-81) and tourism (1979-83).\n\nWhiteway, Sir William (Vallance) (b. April 1, 1828, near Totnes, Devon, England - d. June 24, 1908, St. John's, Newfoundland), premier of Newfoundland (1878-85, 1889-94, 1895-97); knighted 1880.\n\nWhitfield, Henry L(ewis) (b. June 20, 1868, near Brandon, Miss. - d. March 18, 1927, Jackson, Miss.), governor of Mississippi (1924-27).\n\nWhitfield, James (b. Dec. 15, 1791, Elbert county, Ga. - d. June 25, 1875, Columbus, Miss.), acting governor of Mississippi (1851-52).\n\nWhitford, Tony, byname of Anthony Wilfred James Whitford (b. June 11, 1941, Fort Smith, N.W.T.), commissioner of the Northwest Territories (2005-10).\n\nWhitlam\n\nWhitlam, (Edward) Gough (pronounced Goff) (b. July 11, 1916, Kew, Vic. - d. Oct. 21, 2014, Sydney, N.S.W.), prime minister of Australia (1972-75). Elected to parliament in 1952, he became deputy leader of the Australian Labor Party in 1960 and leader in 1967. Labor won the elections of Dec. 2, 1972, and he became prime minister. He ended military conscription, freed imprisoned draft resisters, announced withdrawal of Australian forces from Vietnam, lowered barriers to Asian and African immigration, established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, and generally stood for more independence from the United States in foreign affairs. He was also foreign minister until 1973. Rising inflation and unemployment as well as administrative blunders eroded public confidence in his government and by the summer of 1975 his government had lost the parliamentary support needed to pass expenditure bills. When Whitlam steadfastly refused to call new elections to resolve the parliamentary deadlock, Governor-General Sir John Kerr controversially dismissed him from office on Nov. 11, 1975, and appointed a caretaker administration led by Liberal leader Malcolm Fraser. It was the first time in 200 years that a representative of the British crown had exercised the right to remove an elected prime minister. In the general election that followed, the Liberal-National Country Party coalition won a record majority of seats in parliament. Losing another election in 1977, Whitlam resigned the party leadership and his seat in parliament in 1978. In 1983-86 he was Australian ambassador to UNESCO.\n\nWhitley, John Henry (b. Feb. 8, 1866, Halifax, England - d. Feb. 3, 1935, London, England), speaker of the British House of Commons (1921-28). He was also chairman of the British Broadcasting Corporation (1930-35). He played a leading part in the foundation (after World War I) of the joint industrial bodies that became known as Whitley Councils.\n\nWhitman, Charles S(eymour) (b. Aug. 28, 1868, Hanover, Conn. - d. March 29, 1947, New York City), governor of New York (1915-19).\n\nC.T. Whitman\n\nWhitman, Christine Todd, née Christine Temple Todd (b. Sept. 26, 1946, New York City), governor of New Jersey (1994-2001). She attended her first Republican National Convention in San Francisco in 1956, at age nine. In 1990 she took on the task of running against Sen. Bill Bradley; it was just after Gov. Jim Florio's big tax increases, and she attacked Bradley for taking no position on them. The result was a near-upset: Bradley won by only 50%-47%. In 1993 she ran for governor, winning the June primary with 40% of the vote to 33% for former attorney general Cary Edwards and 24% for former state senator James Wallwork. Florio's 1990 tax package was very much like Bill Clinton's 1993 tax increase. Clinton political advisers James Carville and Paul Begala ran Florio's campaign and Democratic National Chairman David Wilhelm said the race \"will be a referendum on the type of leadership\" both Florio and Clinton have provided. It was widely thought at the time that voters were resentful of the rich, and the two candidates' backgrounds presented a vivid contrast that the Florio campaign underlined. Florio ads showed pictures of Whitman's house; she was ridiculed for saying \"as funny as it seems, $500 is a lot of money\" to many people. But she trumped him by promising a 30% across-the-board income tax cut over three years. She defeated Florio 49%-48%. Days later she was embarrassed when her consultant Ed Rollins claimed money was spent to \"depress\" voter turnout in black areas; she steadfastly denied it, and Rollins later repudiated his statement. In office, she delivered on her promises and became a national Republican star. Her tax cuts were passed ahead of schedule. In 1997 she eked out another narrow victory, 47%-46%, over Democrat Jim McGreevey. In 2001-03 she was director of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nWhitmer, Gretchen (Esther) (b.

He was first elected to parliament in 1977 and moved fast up the hierarchy of the United National Party (UNP) after party stalwart Ranasinghe Premadasa was elected president in 1989. Premadasa appointed him leader of the house in parliament, making Wickremesinghe responsible for steering the party through a hostile chamber. He became prime minister in 1993 but after 16 months was relegated to the opposition when the UNP was ousted in elections by the People's Alliance (PA). He took over the reins of the UNP in 1994 at the tail of the party's 17 turbulent years in power, which saw Sri Lanka go through impressive economic transformation, bloody ethnic violence, and a brutal leftist youth uprising. He succeeded Premadasa, Lalith Athulathmudali, and Gamini Dissanayake, all of whom were assassinated by suspected rebels. Wickremesinghe himself narrowly escaped an attack in December 1999 when a suspected Tamil Tiger suicide bomber blew themselves up. He was credited with the smooth transition of power to the PA government, insisting the new government be given a chance to carry out its agenda. Later he hardened, accusing the government of going on political \"witch hunts\" against opposition politicians, including himself, and of using violence against opponents. He launched talks with Pres. Chandrika Kumaratunga in 2000 to reach consensus about a new constitution but denied her support at the last minute. The PA government was forced to shelve the new constitution. He became prime minister again when the UNP won elections in 2001. He achieved a negotiated ceasefire in the country's 20-year-old civil war, but was defeated by the PA in elections in 2004. He unsuccessfully stood for president in 2005. In 2015 he became prime minister again. He has also held the portfolios of youth affairs and employment (1978-89), education (1980-89), industries (1989-94), science and technology (1990-94), and policy development and implementation (2001-04), policy planning and economic affairs (2015-18), child, youth, and cultural affairs (2015), law and order (2018), national policies, economic affairs, resettlement and rehabilitation, Northern Province development, vocational training and skills development, and youth affairs (2018-19), and finance, economic stabilization, and national policies (2022- ).

Dési Bouterse, during whose dictatorship he also served as minister of interior (1985-88) and justice (1986-87). Following Bouterse's second coup in 1990, Wijdenbosch became vice president under the interim presidency of Johan Kraag, and by 1996 he was NDP chairman. No party or coalition gained the necessary two-thirds majority in the May 1996 elections, and the election of a president fell to the United People's Assembly - a body comprising local, district, and national representatives - in September; he defeated incumbent Ronald Venetiaan by a vote of 438-407. He managed to craft a five-party coalition, but only after agreeing that his mentor Bouterse was not to hold office in his government. Bouterse nevertheless was named adviser. His administration faced many long-standing economic problems, but from the onset he came under criticism for extravagant spending. In August 1997 he dismissed his finance minister for complaining about his purchase of a new presidential yacht. Amid rising protests and a sinking economy he called for early elections to bide for additional time, but opponents began agitating for his resignation. A national strike brought the country to a virtual standstill in May 1999. The cabinet then resigned en masse in further protest. On June 1, 1999, the National Assembly passed a vote of no confidence against Wijdenbosch by a vote of 27-14. He then cut short his five-year term, quit the NDP, and formed his own organization, the Democratic National Platform 2000 (DNP 2000), to retain power. Elections were held on May 25, 2000, and former president Ronald Venetiaan's New Front coalition captured 33 of 51 seats, the DNP 2000 only 3.\n\nWijeratne, Ranjan (b. April 4, 1931 - d.

He joined the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in 1989 and served as a member of parliament from 1998. In 2004 he left the VVD because of his vociferous stance against Turkish membership of the European Union. He adopted a general anti-Islam, anti-immigration position and soon gained a devoted following. In 2006 he founded the Party for Freedom (PVV) - a \"party\" of which he was the sole member, in order to retain absolute control. It won 9 of 150 seats in the 2006 parliamentary election. In 2007 he proposed that the Qur´an be banned in the Netherlands. In 2009 he was temporarily refused entry to the United Kingdom on the grounds that his visit would threaten public order. A Dutch court had charged him with inciting hatred toward Muslims, but he was acquitted in 2011. In 2010 the party won 24 seats in parliament, a position that allowed him to play a major role in a minority government formed by the VVD and the Christian Democrats. In April 2012 Prime Minister Mark Rutte proposed an austerity budget designed to adhere to the EU's recently adopted deficit ceiling, and Wilders withdrew the PVV's support from the coalition. In the following elections in September 2012, the PVV dropped to 15 seats; in 2017 it rose again to 20. In another trial, he was found guilty in December 2016 of inciting discrimination and insulting a group (Moroccans), but he was acquitted of inciting hate; the court imposed no sentence, ruling that a criminal conviction was sufficient punishment for a politician in Wilders' position.\n\nWilecki, Tadeusz (Adam) (b.

Jan. 8, 1912, Barbados - d. Nov. 21, 1999), administrator of Montserrat (1960-64); knighted 1984.\n\nWilford, Sir Thomas Mason (b. June 20, 1870, Lower Hutt, New Zealand - d. June 22, 1939, Wellington, New Zealand), defence minister of New Zealand (1928-29); knighted 1930. He was also mayor of Wellington (1910-11), minister of marine (1917-19) and justice (1917-19, 1928-29), and high commissioner to the United Kingdom (1930-33).\n\nWilhelm I\n\nWilhelm I, in full Wilhelm Friedrich Ludwig (b. March 22, 1797, Berlin, Prussia [now in Germany] - d. March 9, 1888, Berlin), German emperor (1871-88) and king of Prussia (1861-88). He was the second son of the future king Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia. He took part in the war against France in 1814 and continued a military career. In 1840, when his childless elder brother, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, ascended the throne, he became prince of Prussia and heir presumptive. In March 1848 he proposed to put down revolutionary movements by force, earning him the sobriquet of Kartätschenprinz (\"Prince of Grapeshot\"). After a temporary exile in England, he returned to Prussia in June 1848, and in 1849 he commanded the troops sent to defeat an uprising in Baden. Having been appointed deputy (October 1857) and then regent (October 1858) for his ailing brother, he succeeded him as king on Jan. 2, 1861. The war against Denmark and the Seven Weeks' War against Austria in 1866, both of which he originally opposed, made Prussia master of northern Germany and made him recognize that Otto von Bismarck, his prime minister, was more necessary to Prussia than he himself was. The war with France in 1870-71 led to the foundation of the German Reich. His strong identification with Prussia made him reluctant, but Bismarck induced him to accept the imperial title by means of a sham offer from all the German princes. Wilhelm was proclaimed German emperor at Versailles, in conquered France, on Jan. 18, 1871, exactly 170 years after Prussia became a kingdom. He generally accepted Bismarck's advice and refused repeated offers of resignation from the chancellor, answering \"Never\" to the last one in 1877. Two attempts on his life in 1878 (one of which seriously wounded him) caused general indignation and were exploited by Bismarck to justify anti-Socialist legislation.\n\nWilhelm II\n\nWilhelm II, in full Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert (b. Jan. 27, 1859, Potsdam, Prussia [now in Germany] - d. June 4, 1941, Doorn, Netherlands), German emperor and king of Prussia (1888-1918). He was the eldest child of the future emperor Friedrich III and the British princess Victoria, daughter of Queen Victoria. In 1881 he married Princess Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, who bore him six sons and a daughter. After his father's short reign in 1888, Wilhelm found himself Kaiser at the age of 29. In 1890 he dismissed Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. He had more progressive ideas than Bismarck on social policy, but the first disappointments were enough to make him revert to a policy of severity against the Social Democrats. He was ill-equipped to steer German foreign policy along a rational course and let the 1887 Reinsurance Treaty with Russia lapse, opening the way for a Russian-French alliance. In 1908 he gave a tactless interview to The Daily Telegraph which counteracted his purpose of promoting Anglo-German friendship and led to his great humiliation in the consequent internal crisis in Germany. In 1914 he readily gave Austria-Hungary a \"blank cheque\" in its confrontation with Serbia, then wavered but failed to prevent the imminent catastrophe. Although nominally supreme commander in World War I, the role of ultimate arbiter of German policy in wartime was too heavy for him to sustain. He had long lost all influence when the collapse of the German offensive of 1918 made it obviously necessary to end the war. He refused to abdicate until his hand was forced when revolution broke out on November 9. He went into exile in the Netherlands, which refused Allied demands for his extradition. After the death of his wife in 1921, he married Princess Hermine von Schönaich-Carolath in 1922.\n\nWilhelmina\n\nWilhelmina (Helena Pauline Maria) (b. Aug. 31, 1880, The Hague, Netherlands - d. Nov. 28, 1962, Het Loo, Gelderland, Netherlands), queen of the Netherlands (1890-1948). She was the only daughter of King Willem III and his second wife, Emma of Waldeck-Pyrmont. On her father's death (Nov. 23, 1890) she became queen under the regency of her mother. After coming of age, she was enthroned on Sept. 6, 1898, at Amsterdam's Nieuwe Kerk. The young queen's beauty and dignity did much to bring the affections of people who had been tempted by republicanism back to loyalty to the House of Oranje-Nassau. On Feb. 7, 1901, she married Duke Heinrich of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1876-1934), who became Prince Hendrik of the Netherlands, and on April 30, 1909, she gave birth to a daughter, Princess Juliana. During World War I, she declared her government's firm intention to maintain the integrity and neutrality of the Netherlands. In World War II, she issued her \"flaming protest\" at the German invasion of her country on May 10, 1940, and decided to leave for England with her family; she arrived in London three days later, followed by members of the cabinet. She became the symbol of Dutch resistance and exhorted her people in broadcasts over Radio Orange to hold on until liberation should come. In 1942 she visited Canada and the United States. She visited the southern liberated areas of her country in March 1945 and took residence near Breda on April 27. At Amsterdam on June 28 and at The Hague on July 7 she was welcomed back with great enthusiasm. After two periods of ill health during which Juliana was regent, she abdicated the throne to Juliana on Sept. 4, 1948, and retired to her palace, Het Loo, near Apeldoorn.\n\nWili(-Wüest), Felix (b. Oct. 16, 1916 - d. Dec. 6, 2011), Schultheiss of Luzern (1972, 1978).\n\nWilkes, Sir Michael (John) (b. June 11, 1940 - d. Oct. 27, 2013, London, England), lieutenant governor of Jersey (1995-2000); knighted 1991.\n\nWilkie, Alexander Mair (b. May 24, 1917, Scotland - d. Aug. 13, 1966, aboard the Achille Lauro, en route from Sydney to the U.K.), British resident commissioner of the New Hebrides (1962-66).\n\nWilkins, Sir Michael (Compton Lockwood) (b. Jan. 4, 1933 - d. April 25, 1994), lieutenant governor of Guernsey (1990-94); knighted 1985.\n\nR. Wilkins\n\nWilkins, Roy (Ottoway) (b. Aug. 30, 1901, St. Louis, Mo. - d. Sept. 8, 1981, New York City), executive secretary (1955-64) and executive director (1964-77) of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). As managing editor of the Kansas City Call, a newspaper serving the black community, his editorials urged blacks to use their vote and were instrumental in the defeat of U.S. Sen. Henry J. Allen, whom Wilkins termed \"a militant racist.\" His efforts were noticed by Walter White, executive secretary of the NAACP, who made him his chief assistant in New York in 1931. His investigation of the working conditions of blacks on Mississippi levees resulted in a 1932 report that prompted congressional action. He edited The Crisis, the official organ of the NAACP, from 1934 to 1949. In 1949-50 he was acting executive secretary, when White took a year's leave, and also chairman of the National Emergency Civil Rights Mobilization, a coalition of anti-Communist liberal groups. He won a historic 1954 Supreme Court decision that overturned the doctrine of \"separate but equal\" educational facilities. After White's death in 1955 he was appointed to the NAACP's highest administrative post. During a period of racial turbulence and mass protest, he directed the organization on a course that sought equal rights through legal redress and avoided alienating significant segments of the white power structure, although, under the pressure of activist groups, it diversified its activities to include nonviolent direct action and to extend legal aid to other, often more militant, groups. In August 1963 he helped organize the historic civil rights march on Washington. In 1977 he retired and was succeeded by Benjamin L. Hooks.\n\nWilkins, William (b. Dec. 20, 1779, Carlisle, Pa. - d. June 23, 1865, Pittsburgh, Pa.), U.S. secretary of war (1844-45). He was also minister to Russia (1834-35).\n\nWilkinson, James (b. 1757, northeast of Benedict, Maryland - d. Dec. 28, 1825, Mexico City, Mexico), governor of Louisiana Territory (1805-07).\n\nWilkinson, Richard James (b. May 29, 1867, Salonika, Ottoman Empire [now Thessaloniki, Greece] - d. Dec. 5, 1941, Izmir, Turkey), governor of Sierra Leone (1916-22).\n\nWilkinson, Wallace (Glenn) (b. Dec. 12, 1941, Casey county, Ky. - d. July 5, 2002, Lexington, Ky.), governor of Kentucky (1987-91). A Democrat, his administration helped create the Kentucky Lottery, which he had pushed as an alternative to higher taxes, and the 1990 Kentucky Education Reform Act, which set high performance standards, held schools accountable for their results, and greatly increased school funding. But he was dogged throughout his administration by questions about whether he used his office to advance his business interests. After he became governor, he allegedly got a state-regulated company, Kentucky Central Life Insurance, to pay an inflated price for a money-losing hotel he owned in Frankfort. Kentucky Central later went bankrupt, and the state insurance commissioner sued Wilkinson. The former governor paid $11 million to settle the case in 1999. Wilkinson's appointments secretary, who also was his nephew, went to prison in a bribery scandal. A federal grand jury also investigated Wilkinson, but he was never charged and denied any wrongdoing. His business empire collapsed in bankruptcy in 2001.\n\nWillaert, Maurice (Adolphe Jules) (b. May 30, 1910, Heliopolis, Egypt - d. May 4, 2003, Ukkel, Brussels-Capital region, Belgium), governor of Kivu (1957-59).\n\nWillard, Ashbel P(arsons) (b. Oct. 31, 1820, Oneida county, N.Y. - d. Oct. 3, 1860, St. Paul, Minn.), governor of Indiana (1857-60).\n\nWillbach, Priit, until 2013 Priit Vilba (b. July 22, 1953, Tallinn, Estonian S.S.R.), Estonian politician. He was mayor of Tallinn (1996).\n\nWillcocks, Sir James (b. April 1, 1857 - d. Dec. 18, 1926), governor of Bermuda (1917-22); knighted 1900.\n\nWillebrand, Ernst Gustaf friherre von (b. Aug. 19, 1751, Karuna [now part of Sauvo municipality], Finland - d. June 25, 1809, Åbo [now Turku], Finland), governor of Åbo och Björneborg (1790-1806). He was made friherre (baron) in 1806.\n\nWillem I, in full Willem Frederik, French Guillaume I (b. Aug. 24, 1772, The Hague, Netherlands - d. Dec. 12, 1843, Berlin, Prussia [Germany]), sovereign prince (as Willem VI Frederik) of the United Netherlands (1813-15) and king of the Netherlands and grand duke of Luxembourg (1815-40). Son of Willem V Batavus, last stadholder of the Netherlands, he commanded (1793-95) the Dutch army in the French Revolutionary Wars, and after the French occupation of the Netherlands he emigrated to England, then entered the Prussian and later the Austrian service. He returned to the Netherlands in 1813, accepting the provisional government's offer to become sovereign prince, and the Congress of Vienna gave him the title king of the Netherlands in 1815. His kingdom comprised present Belgium as well as the Netherlands, and he was awarded the grand duchy of Luxembourg in compensation for his family holdings in Germany, which he ceded to Prussia. He soon alienated his Belgian subjects by attempting to make Dutch the official language, by granting disproportionate influence to the northern provinces, and by encroaching on the freedom of the Roman Catholic Church. Inspired by the revolution in Paris in July 1830, a rebellion broke out in Brussels the following month. He stubbornly sought to suppress it despite the intervention of Britain and France. Belgium won its independence, but final recognition by Willem came only in 1839. When his Dutch subjects forced him to liberalize the constitution in 1840, he abdicated in favour of his son Willem II and spent the rest of his life in Berlin. Through his rule as an enlightened despot, he fostered the development of Dutch agriculture, commerce, and industry.\n\nWillem II, in full Willem Frederik George Lodewijk, French Guillaume II (b. Dec. 6, 1792, The Hague, Netherlands - d. March 17, 1849, Tilburg, Netherlands), king of the Netherlands and grand duke of Luxembourg (1840-49); son of Willem I. He served (1811-12) with Viscount Wellington in the Peninsular War and was wounded at Waterloo (1815). In 1816 he married the Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna, sister of the Russian emperor Aleksandr I. He led the Dutch army in the Belgian revolution (1830), after his father had failed to approve his efforts at conciliation. Called to the throne upon the abdication of his father (1840), Willem II was immediately confronted with a grave financial problem, which was solved by raising a \"voluntary loan\" among the people. Demand mounted for constitutional revision, but the king resisted the liberal movement, led by Johan Thorbecke, until the revolutionary spirit of 1848 induced him to grant the desired reforms, expanding the power of the ministers and the Estates-General (parliament) and establishing the principle of direct elections.\n\nWillem III, in full Willem Alexander Paul Frederik Lodewijk, French Guillaume III (b. Feb. 19, 1817, Brussels, Netherlands [now in Belgium] - d. Nov. 23, 1890, Apeldoorn, Netherlands), king of the Netherlands and grand duke of Luxembourg (1849-90); son of Willem II. He married his cousin Sophia, daughter of King Wilhelm I of Württemberg, in 1839. He ruled as a constitutional monarch, although his anti-Catholic posture caused some frictions with his governments. He granted a parliamentary constitution to his Luxembourg subjects. In 1867 he tried to sell his sovereignty over Luxembourg to France but yielded to Prussia's demand that the area be independent; he maintained Luxembourg's neutrality in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71). The leading Dutch statesman during his reign was Johan Thorbecke, who obtained full emancipation of the Dutch Catholics and also promoted economic growth and political reform. After his first wife died in 1877, Willem married Emma of Waldeck-Pyrmont (1879). With his death the male Dutch line of the house of Oranje-Nassau became extinct. The Netherlands crown passed to his daughter, Wilhelmina, but Luxembourg went to Duke Adolf of Nassau, from a collateral line of the family.\n\nWillem-Alexander\n\nWillem-Alexander (Claus George Ferdinand) (b. April 27, 1967, Utrecht, Netherlands), king of the Netherlands (2013- ); son of Beatrix. On Feb. 2, 2002, he married Máxima Zorreguieta (b. May 17, 1971, Buenos Aires, Argentina), among some controversy because her father, Jorge Zorreguieta (1928-2017), was secretary of agriculture (1979-81) in the Argentine military regime of Gen. Jorge Rafael Videla. Three daughters were born to the couple, Catharina-Amalia Beatrix Carmen Victoria (b. Dec. 7, 2003, The Hague), Alexia Juliana Marcela Laurentien (b. June 26, 2005, The Hague), and Ariane Wilhelmina Máxima Ines (b. April 10, 2007, The Hague). In 2017 he revealed that he had been living a secret double life as a co-pilot for commercial airline KLM for 21 years.\n\nWillemsen, Willem Anne Constant (b. Aug. 2, 1868, Curaçao - d. 19...), acting administrator of Saba (1918-19).\n\nWillesee, Don(ald Robert) (b. April 14, 1916, Derby, Western Australia - d. Sept. 9, 2003, Perth, Western Australia), foreign minister of Australia (1973-75). He rose through the Labor Party ranks to enter the Senate in 1950 where he served for 25 years. He became special minister of state in 1972 as part of the Gough Whitlam government before being appointed minister for foreign affairs.\n\nWilley, Norman B(ushnell) (b. March 25, 1838, Guilford, N.Y. - d. Oct. 20, 1921, near Topeka, Kan.), governor of Idaho (1890-93).\n\nWilli\n\nWilli, Andrea (b. May 26, 1955, Balzers, Liechtenstein), foreign minister of Liechtenstein (1993-2001).\n\nWilliam III\n\nWilliam III, in full William Henry, byname William of Orange, Dutch Willem Hendrik, prins van Oranje (b. Nov. 14 [Nov. 4, O.S.], 1650, The Hague, Netherlands - d. March 19 [March 8, O.S.], 1702, Kensington Palace, London, England), king of England, Scotland (as William II), and Ireland (as William I) (1689-1702; until 1695 jointly with his wife Mary II). He was the posthumous son of Stadholder Willem II and Mary, eldest daughter of Charles I of England. Following the assassination of the grand pensionary Johan de Witt he became stadholder (Willem III) of Holland and Zeeland (1672-1702), Utrecht (1674-1702), Gelderland and Overijssel (1675-1702), and Drenthe (1696-1702). Appointed to command the army though inexperienced as a soldier, he defied all odds and, by opening the dikes to flood the countryside, was able to halt the advance of the French army and negotiate favourable peace terms at Nijmegen in 1678, concentrating thereafter on defeating French ambition in Europe. He had already made peace with England, which had been an ally of France, in 1674. In 1677 Charles II agreed to a marriage between Willem and Mary, eldest daughter of James, Duke of York. When James became king (1685), his policy of Catholicization provided Willem with the opportunity for invading his father-in-law's domain in the name of his wife. He landed at Torbay on Nov. 15 [Nov. 5, O.S.], 1688, following an invitation from seven British notables (the Immortal Seven), ostensibly to protect the Protestant religion and traditional parliamentary liberties, but he was more concerned to mobilize British resources for the continental war effort. James then fled to France, and William and Mary were crowned in February 1689, completing the \"Glorious Revolution.\" James's supporters (Jacobites) were defeated by 1691, and William turned his attention to the continental war, which was ended indecisively at the Peace of Rijswijk (1697). Never popular in Britain, he found his position materially weakened by the death of Mary in 1695. His reign nevertheless brought stability after a period of considerable political unrest; the financing of the war led directly to the establishment of a system of national debt and to the founding of the Bank of England (1694) and he introduced greater freedom of the press (1695). He died after a fall when his horse stumbled over a molehill, and was succeeded by Mary's sister, Queen Anne.\n\nWilliam IV\n\nWilliam IV, in full William Henry (b. Aug. 21, 1765, London, England - d. June 20, 1837, Windsor Castle, near London), king of the United Kingdom and of Hanover (1830-37).\n\nWilliam-Powlett, Sir Peveril (Barton Reibey Wallop) (b. March 5, 1898 - d. Nov. 10, 1985), governor of Southern Rhodesia (1954-59); knighted 1953.\n\nWilliams, Abraham J. (b. Feb. 26, 1781, Hardy county, Va. [in present Grant county, W.Va.] - d. Dec. 30, 1839, south of Columbia, Mo.), acting governor of Missouri (1825-26).\n\nWilliams, Sir Alexander (Thomas) (b. July 13, 1903 - d. Jan. 8, 1984), governor of Northern Rhodesia (acting, 1954) and the Leeward Islands (1956-60); knighted 1958.\n\nAnthony Williams\n\nWilliams, Anthony (Allen), original name Anthony Stephen Eggleton (b. July 28, 1951, Los Angeles, Calif.), mayor of Washington, D.C. (1999-2007). As the boy turned 3 years old without having uttered a word, his foster parents were ready to put him in a home for the mentally retarded. Virginia Williams, who was pregnant and had two children at the time, then decided to adopt the boy. He was renamed Anthony Allen Williams. He served in a series of administrative posts from Boston to St. Louis. He came to the District of Columbia in 1993 and held a top job in the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Pres. Bill Clinton's first term. He was appointed the District's chief financial officer in 1995, and his job was to help lift the District out of an abyss of debt and mismanagement, a task he pursued with zeal. He slashed budgets, eliminated services, fired longtime employees, and demanded management reforms. His work won praise in many quarters but earned him the enmity of those who called him the hatchet man for the congressional overseers who suspended the District's limited home rule. Cora Masters Barry, the wife of Mayor Marion S. Barry, tabbed Williams \"Mr. Bow Tie,\" an appellation that stuck because it spoke as much to what some perceived as his technocrat's mentality and life of privilege as it did to his taste in neck wear. He won the Sept. 15, 1998, Democratic primary election for mayor, as well as the general election in November. In 2002 he mounted a historic write-in campaign for the Democratic nomination after the D.C. Board of Elections and Ethics knocked his name off the primary ballot and fined his campaign nearly $300,000 for submitting fraudulent nominating petitions. He defeated his main primary opponent Rev. Willie Wilson, who launched his own write-in campaign, by a 3-1 margin and then was easily reelected.\n\nWilliams, Anya (Kashora) (b. 1980?), acting governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands (2013, 2016, 2019, 2023). She became deputy governor in 2012.\n\nWilliams, Arnold (b. May 21, 1898, Fillmore, Utah - d. May 25, 1970, Idaho Falls, Idaho), governor of Idaho (1945-47).\n\nWilliams, Benjamin (b. Jan. 1, 1751, near Smithfield, Johnston county, North Carolina - d. July 20, 1814, Moore county, N.C.), governor of North Carolina (1799-1802, 1807-08).\n\nWilliams, Boswell (Bennie) (b. May 16, 1926 - d. July 20, 2014, Castries, Saint Lucia), governor-general of Saint Lucia (1980-82).\n\nWilliams, Charles K(ilborn) (b. Jan. 24, 1782, Cambridge, Mass. - d. March 9, 1853, Rutland, Vt.), governor of Vermont (1850-52).\n\nWilliams, Charmaine, Bahamian diplomat. She was chargé d'affaires at the United Nations (2020-21).\n\nWilliams, Sir Daniel (Charles) (b. Nov. 4, 1935, St. David parish, Grenada), governor-general of Grenada (1996-2008); knighted 1996. He was also minister of health and housing (1984-89), women's affairs (1984-88), community development (1984-87), physical planning (1987-89), and legal affairs (1988-89) and attorney-general (1988-89).\n\nDanny Williams\n\nWilliams, Danny (b. Aug. 4, 1950, St. John's, Newfoundland), premier of Newfoundland and Labrador (2003-10).\n\nWilliams, Sir David (b. Oct. 22, 1921 - d. July 16, 2012), governor of Gibraltar (1982-85); knighted 1975.\n\nWilliams, David R(ogerson) (b. March 8, 1776, Robbins Neck, South Carolina - d. Nov. 17, 1830, Lynches Creek, S.C.), governor of South Carolina (1814-16).\n\nWilliams, Sir Denys (Ambrose) (b. Oct. 12, 1929 - d. Aug. 7, 2014, Rockley, Christ Church, Barbados), acting governor-general of Barbados (1995-96); knighted 1987. He was chief justice from 1987 to 2001.\n\nWilliams, Dessima (M.) (b. St. Andrew's, Grenada), Grenadian diplomat. She was permanent representative to the United Nations (2009-13) and chairperson of the Alliance of Small Island States (2009-11).\n\nEliud Williams\n\nWilliams, Eliud (Thaddeus) (b. Aug. 21, 1948), president of Dominica (2012-13).\n\nEric Williams\n\nWilliams, Eric (Eustace) (b. Sept. 25, 1911, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad - d. March 29, 1981, St. Anne, near Port-of-Spain), prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago (1961-81). He became a consultant to the Caribbean Commission, a body established by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands to coordinate the economic development of the area. From 1948 he headed its research branch, but his assertiveness tended to alienate the member countries, especially the United States, and in 1955 he left and decided to enter Trinidad politics. He organized the People's National Movement (PNM) and led it to victory in the 1956 elections, becoming the colony's first chief minister and in 1959, with the achievement of internal self-government, premier. His party made only a fair showing during the period of the short-lived West Indies Federation (1958-62), but in the national elections of December 1961 for Trinidad and Tobago, the PNM won a landslide victory, after he fought a vigorous campaign against the U.S. naval base at Chaguaramas. He became prime minister of the colony and led it to independence in August 1962. He was successively reelected and served as prime minister until his death. He laid emphasis on social services, education, encouragement of private enterprise, and attraction of foreign investment capital. The policy made Trinidad and Tobago the wealthiest Commonwealth Caribbean nation. Black Power militancy, racial tensions, and labour unrest during the 1960s obliged him to take repressive measures that strengthened his regime but represented a failure of his ideals; in 1973 he threatened to resign, and in the elections of 1974 he campaigned against the corruption in his own government. In 1976 he made the country a republic.\n\nWilliams, Evan (John) (b. Aug. 16, 1949, Katoomba, N.S.W.), administrator of Christmas Island and Cocos Islands (2003-05). In 2008-11 he was Australian high commissioner to Cyprus.\n\nWilliams, G(erhard) Mennen (b. Feb. 23, 1911, Detroit, Mich. - d. Feb. 2, 1988, Detroit), governor of Michigan (1949-61). Williams, who was tagged with the nickname \"Soapy\" because his maternal grandfather was the founder of the Mennen soap and toiletries company, was nurtured in a staunch Republican family but became a liberal Democrat. He served as an attorney for the Social Security Board and then as executive assistant to the U.S. attorney general (1939-40) and as a member of the criminal division of the U.S. Department of Justice (1940-41). As six-term governor he was a highly visible politician with his polkadot bow ties, crew cut, and amiable disposition. He enacted strong measures to ensure civil rights and was active in national Democratic politics. After he chose not to seek reelection in 1960, Pres. John F. Kennedy appointed him assistant secretary of state for African affairs, a post he held until 1966. His diplomatic service continued from 1968 to 1970 when he served as ambassador to the Philippines. He then returned to Michigan to serve as justice (1971-83) and chief justice (1983-86) of the state Supreme Court; he retired from the bench in 1986 at the mandatory retirement age of 75.\n\nG. Williams\n\nH.H. Williams\n\nWilliams, Galmo (Wenthpuel), byname Gilley (b. Bottle Creek, North Caicos, Turks and Caicos Islands), premier of the Turks and Caicos Islands (2009). He was also minister of natural resources and social services (2003-06), immigration, labour, and housing (2006), and home affairs (2006-09).\n\nWilliams, George H(enry) (b.

Aug. 24, 1998, Phoenix, Ariz.), U.S. politician. He entered the public eye with a radio career at Phoenix station KOY-AM beginning in 1929. After serving as an elected school board member and appointed city council member, he was elected mayor of Phoenix and served two terms (1956-60). He helped propel Republicans to statewide power in 1966. From 1967 to 1975, he served two two-year terms and one four-year term as governor before retiring. He was the first Arizona governor to serve a four-year term; Arizona voters approved a constitutional change that added four-year terms in 1968. By 1973, Williams was a target of liberal activists, and he narrowly escaped being forced to a recall election. He was criticized for signing anti-union legislation passed in the wake of strife surrounding United Farmworkers Union organizing in the Yuma area.\n\nWilliams, James D(ouglas) (b.

He was again elected in the June 16, 1999, national election, and became prime minister following the resignation of Sir Geoffrey Henry. In October 1999 the New Alliance Party left the government coalition and he led a minority government until resigning in November, bringing to an end ten years of rule by the Cook Islands Party. He held the overseas seat until it was abolished in 2003.\n\nWilliams, John Bell (b. Dec. 4, 1918, Raymond, Miss. - d.

Although he had been an active Democrat, he turned Republican during Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal administration. He engaged in a public feud with the government over competition to utility companies from the Tennessee Valley Authority. His effective criticism of the New Deal and his widely circulated article in Fortune (April 1940) entitled \"We, the People\" made him a dark horse candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. A late start, limited organization, and opposition from the party leadership was compensated by enthusiastic grassroots support and he was nominated on the sixth ballot. He pledged an end to unemployment through policies fostering business expansion and investment, while agreeing with many of the New Deal reforms and with Roosevelt's attitudes in foreign policy. But with the critical nature of the world situation, many voters chose the more experienced leader. Although Willkie carried only 10 states and was defeated by an electoral vote of 449 to 82, he polled more popular votes than any previous Republican candidate (22.3 million, compared to Roosevelt's 27.2 million). Long before the attack on Pearl Harbor, he advocated giving aid to the Allies. He went to England in 1941 and to the Middle East, the Soviet Union, and China in 1942 as the president's personal envoy and later wrote a book, One World (1943), which made a strong plea for postwar international cooperation; it helped persuade many Republicans to turn away from isolationism. Many party leaders, however, were alienated by his activities, and there was considerable opposition when he again ran for the nomination in 1944. Defeated in the Wisconsin primary, he promptly withdrew from the race.\n\nWillmar, Jean-Jacques-Madelaine (b. March 6, 1792, Luxembourg, Austrian Netherlands [now in Luxembourg] - d. Nov. 26, 1866, Luxembourg, Luxembourg), prime minister of Luxembourg (1848-53); brother of Jean-Pierre Christine Willmar. He was at the same time minister of foreign affairs, justice, education, and worship.\n\nWillmar, Jean-Pierre Christine, baron (b. Nov. 29, 1790, Luxembourg, Austrian Netherlands [now in Luxembourg] - d. Jan. 28, 1858, The Hague, Netherlands), war minister (1836-40) and acting finance minister (1839) of Belgium. He was made baron in 1845.\n\nWilloch\n\nWilloch, Kåre (Isaachsen) (b. Oct. 3, 1928, Oslo, Norway - d. Dec. 6, 2021, Oslo), prime minister of Norway (1981-86). He was first elected to the Storting (parliament) as a proxy member in 1953 and was elected a full member in 1957. He served as minister of trade and shipping in Norway's first post-World War II non-Socialist coalition cabinets (August-September 1963 and 1965-70). In 1970-74 he was chairman of the Conservative Party. In 1973 he was president of the Nordic Council. In the September 1981 general election he led his party to its best result since 1924. It won 54 seats in the 155-member Storting, taking votes not only from its chief opponent, the Labour Party, but also from two small non-Socialist parties with which it was pledged to form a coalition. Together the three - Conservatives, Centre (agrarian) Party, and Christian Democrats - won 80 seats, against the 69 secured by Labour and its parliamentary ally, the small Socialist Left Party. When formation of a coalition proved impossible, because of Christian Democratic demands for reform of the abortion law, he agreed to form an all-Conservative minority cabinet, relying on the Christian Democratic and Centre parties to provide parliamentary support on most issues. It was the first purely Conservative government in more than 50 years. It was very much a personal triumph for Willoch. In the media the campaign had been dominated by a series of lively political duels between him and Gro Harlem Brundtland, prime minister of the preceding minority Labour government. In 1983 he formed a coalition with the Conservatives and the Centre. It narrowly lost its majority in September 1985 elections, but continued as a minority government until May 1986 when he resigned after failing to push economic austerity measures through parliament. In 1989-98 he was governor of Oslo and Akershus.\n\nWills, Fred(erick Rudolph) (b. Sept. 18, 1928 - d.

March 13, 2000, New Rochelle, N.Y.), governor of New York (1973-75). He served in the Navy during World War II, seeing action during the Normandy invasion. A conservative Republican, he was Nelson Rockefeller's lieutenant governor for 15 years before stepping into the top spot after Rockefeller resigned in 1973. Wilson ran for governor in his own right in 1974, losing to Democrat Hugh Carey in the post-Watergate backlash that engulfed GOP candidates across the country.\n\nWilson, Margaret (Anne) (b. May 20, 1947, Gisborne, N.Z.), New Zealand politician. She was president of the Labour Party (1984-87), minister of labour (1999-2004), courts (2002-03), and commerce (2004), attorney-general (1999-2005), and speaker of the House of Representatives (2005-08).\n\nWilson, Michael (Holcombe) (b. Nov. 4, 1937, Toronto, Ont. - d. Feb. 10, 2019), finance minister of Canada (1984-91). In 1979 he was elected to parliament and was immediately appointed minister of state for international trade in Joe Clark's short-lived Tory government. During the next five years, he served the Progressive Conservative Party as opposition critic for energy, finance, and regional economic expansion. One of Clark's most trusted advisers and firmest supporters, Wilson nonetheless was one of Clark's rivals in the 1983 contest for the leadership of the party. When the Tories were swept back into power under Brian Mulroney's leadership in 1984, Wilson was appointed minister of finance. His attempt to save money by deindexing the government old-age pension ended in a torrent of public opposition. More successful was his proposal to instate a lifetime income tax exemption on the first $100,000 in capital gains earned by an individual. The personal income tax cut, implemented before the 1988 general elections, came too early to be associated with the new federal goods and services tax (GST) proposed in 1989. Negotiations with the provinces to integrate the GST with provincial sales taxes failed, and it was viewed by Canadians merely as a government tax grab. In response to the public outcry, the government lowered the initial tax rate from the proposed 9 to 7% while raising other rates and curtailing some tax credits. In April 1989 Wilson's worst fear became reality: the confidential federal budget was leaked to the press before he was able to present it in the House of Commons. The opposition immediately called for his resignation, but he refused. He explained his failure to make full disclosure of the leak to the Commons by saying that the leak was the subject of a police investigation. In 1991-93 he was minister for international trade, industry, science, and technology. Later he was ambassador to the United States (2006-09).\n\nP. Wilson\n\nWilson, Pete(r Barton) (b. Aug. 23, 1933, Lake Forest, Ill.), governor of California (1991-99). He was elected to the state Assembly in 1966, where he established himself as a moderate with a pro-choice stand on abortion and a record of support for environmental issues; he was minority whip from 1967 to 1969. In 1971, on the heels of a local scandal, Republican officials nominated Wilson for mayor of San Diego, and he reigned over the city during a time of rapid growth. He ran for governor in 1978 and finished fourth in the primary with 9%. In 1982, he ran for senator, won a five-candidate primary with 38%, and beat outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown in the general 52%-45%. In the Senate he established himself as a follower of Pres. Ronald Reagan, in contrast to his previous middle-of-the-road record. In 1988 he was reelected 53%-44%. In 1990 he was elected governor of the nation's largest state, defeating Dianne Feinstein 49%-46%; in 1994 he was reelected 55%-41% over Kathleen Brown after trailing by 23% in the polls. He took pro-choice and some pro-gay rights stands almost for granted, which may be natural for a Californian; but he was exceedingly tough on crime and contemptuous of criminals. Without becoming well-known nationally and without an enthusiastic core constituency, he had considerable influence in national politics, and was entitled to take some satisfaction in welcoming the 1996 Republican National Convention to his chosen home town of San Diego. But not as the party's nominee: on September 29, Wilson withdrew from the presidential race. He had underestimated the resentment among Republican contributors and California voters of his decision to run for president after promising he wouldn't.\n\nR. Wilson\n\nWilson, Roger (Byron) (b. Oct. 10, 1948, Boone County, Mo.), governor of Missouri (2000-01).\n\nWilson, Sir Samuel Herbert (b. Oct. 31, 1873, Dublin, Ireland - d. Aug. 5, 1950, Goring, Oxfordshire, England), governor of Trinidad and Tobago (1922-24) and Jamaica (1924-25); knighted 1921.\n\nWilson, Selwyn Digby (b. 1933 - d.

Oct. 5, 1967, Chelsea, Vt.), governor of Vermont (1931-35).\n\nW. Wilson\n\nWilson, (Thomas) Woodrow (b. Dec. 28, 1856, Staunton, Va. - d. Feb. 3, 1924, Washington, D.C.), president of the United States (1913-21). As president of Princeton University, he achieved a national reputation by his addresses and articles on political questions of the day, and in 1910 he was offered the Democratic nomination for governor of New Jersey and was elected. His rapid and resounding success brought him into the arena of national politics, and he was nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate in July 1912. The clarity and positive quality of his domestic program won him the leadership of the progressive movement throughout the country. In the election he benefited from a division of the Republican vote between Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft; he won only 42% of the popular vote but a landslide in the electoral college. His first major victory as president was passage of the Underwood Tariff, which reduced customs levies and introduced a federal income tax. This was followed by a broad measure of currency reform - the Federal Reserve Act, signed Dec. 23, 1913. Foreign affairs after July 1914 were dominated by his efforts to protect the rights of the country as a neutral in World War I. He was narrowly reelected in 1916 over Charles Evans Hughes. On April 2, 1917, he asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany, which was passed by an overwhelming majority. On Jan. 8, 1918, he enumerated the Fourteen Points that he regarded as a basis of a just and lasting peace - including the creation of a \"general association of nations.\" But when he presented the Treaty of Versailles (containing the Covenant of the League of Nations) to the Republican-controlled Senate in 1920, it was not ratified, and the U.S. remained outside the League. In December 1920 he was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize for his advocacy of the League.\n\nWilson Hernández, Santiago (b. May 14, 1898, Valparaíso, Chile - d.

May 24, 1995, London, England), prime minister of the United Kingdom (1964-70, 1974-76). At the outbreak of World War II, he was drafted into the civil service. His study of the mining industry, New Deal for Coal (1945), was the basis of the Labour Party's plans for nationalizing the mines. Elected to the House of Commons in 1945, he served as parliamentary secretary to the minister of works (1945-47) and became president of the Board of Trade in 1947 (at 31 the youngest British cabinet minister since 1792), resigning in 1951 in protest against the introduction of National Health Service charges and rearmament policy. In 1954 he became shadow chancellor of the exchequer. He unsuccessfully challenged Hugh Gaitskell for the party leadership in 1960, but after Gaitskell died in 1963, he was elected his successor. He worked to consolidate party unity and led Labour back to power in 1964. He refused to use force against the Rhodesian regime which unilaterally declared independence in 1965, and also kept Britain out of the Vietnam War. He won another election in 1966, but the Conservatives won in 1970. The February 1974 election was inconclusive, but Wilson was asked to form a government in March. This lasted until October, when he won a majority in the year's second general election. By a 1975 referendum on European Economic Community membership, he was able not only to confirm the British role in Europe by an overwhelming majority but also to end a long-running quarrel inside his party. However, economic difficulties continued, and in 1976 he surprised the nation by resigning; he was then knighted. He did not stand for reelection to Parliament in 1983; shortly afterward he was made a life peer.\n\nD.
