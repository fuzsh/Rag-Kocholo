        "text": "About the Project\n\nThe Dunoon Overhead Line Rebuild Project is replacing the existing overhead line, which connects Dunoon to the wider national grid.\n\nThe double circuit 132kV overhead line crosses from Scottish Power Energy Networks licenced area to our operational area as it crosses Loch Long from Garelochhead. As part of the rebuild project, we are also proposing to reconductor (replace the wires which carry current on the line) this part of the line and maintain the existing towers at either side of the crossing.\n\nThe main project elements are:\n\nConstruction of a new 132kV overhead line from the existing Loch Long crossing to Dunoon Grid Supply Point, located near Sandbank\n\nReconductoring of the Loch Long crossing\n\nDecommissioning/removal of the existing 132kV overhead line\n\nAssociated tie in works at Dunoon Substation will also be required\n\nWhy is the Project Required?\n\nThe existing overhead line is supported by an old design suite of metal lattice towers (often referred to as pylons) which are coming toward the end of their operational life.\n\nThrough studies looking at reconducting the line, we have established a requirement to rebuild the overhead line with different support structures to ensure security of supply.\n\nDuring the rebuild of the replacement overhead line, we will still require to maintain supply to Dunoon, and so we will required to rebuild the overhead line on an alternative alignment to the existing. As such, we will require a new Section 37 consent from the Energy Consents Unit of the Scottish Government.\n\nCommunity Engagement\n\nThroughout the life of our projects, we aim to work positively with local communities and keep people informed about what we are doing. This is particularly important when we are developing a project and we want to understand what local people think about our plans.\n\nWe endeavour to take the time to discuss our proposals with local community councils and the wider affected community and to carry out engagement at key stages, listening to feedback before finalising project plans.\n\nNovember 2020 marked the beginning of our public consultation process for these works with our initial virtual consultation. In August 2021, we presented further refined proposals sharing our preferred route and seeking further feedback.\n\nPre-application information events regarding our application took place in August and December 2022. The project team presented to local stakeholders the proposed alignment for the project and were on hand to answer any questions, as well as address issues or concerns that were brought to their attention.\n\nSection 37 Application Submission Update\n\nSSEN Transmission have now submitted their application for consent under Section 37 of The Electricity Act 1989, to install a 132 kV overhead electric line between Dunoon 132/33 kV Substation and existing Tower 15, west of the Loch Long Overhead line (OHL) crossing. Following completion of the Dunoon 132kV OHL Rebuild, the existing 132 kV OHL would be dismantled and removed.\n\nIn summary, the Proposed Development comprises of the following:\n\nThe installation and operation of approximately 18 km of a replacement double circuit steel structure 132 kV overhead line between the existing Dunoon substation and existing Tower 15 to the west of the Loch Long crossing; and\n\nThe erection and operation of temporary single circuit wood pole 132 kV OHL diversions, to facilitate safe erection of the replacement OHL close to, or on the existing OHL alignment.\n\nDeemed planning consent is also sought within the application for ancillary works to facilitate the construction and maintenance of the OHL, including:\n\nThe formation of access tracks (permanent, temporary, and upgrades to existing tracks) and the installation of bridges and culverts to facilitate access;\n\nThe upgrade of existing, or creation of new, bellmouths at public road access points;\n\nWorking areas around infrastructure to facilitate construction;\n\nFormation of flat areas from which the conductor will be pulled during construction, which will contain earthed metal working surfaces referred to as Equipotential Zones (EPZs);\n\nFormation of temporary works compounds and work areas from which the helicopter operations can be safely operated;\n\nTree felling and vegetation clearance to facilitate construction and operation of the Proposed Development;\n\nMeasures to protect road and water crossings during construction (e.g. scaffolding); and\n\nWorks at the existing 132/33 kV Dunoon Substation to facilitate connection of the proposed replacement OHL.\n\nInformation regarding the project, alongside project documents, Section 37 documents and details regarding our consultation, routeing and alignment process can be accessed via the project documents section of this webpage. A copy of the application, with a plan showing the land to which it relates, together with a copy of the EIA Report discussing the Company’s proposals in more detail and presenting an analysis of the environmental implications, is available for public inspection, free of charge on the application website or on the Scottish Government Energy Consents website under application reference ECU00003430.\n\nThe EIA Report is available for public inspection in person, free of charge at: Dunoon Library, Queens Hall, 9 Argyll Street, Dunoon PA23 7HH. The opening hours are Tuesday and Wednesday 9.30am till 4.30pm, Thursday 9.30am till 6.30pm, Friday and Saturday 9.30am till 1.00pm. In Addition, it will be also be available Loch Lomond and the National Park Authority Headquarters, Carrochan, Carrochan Rd, Balloch, Alexandria, G83 8EG. The opening Hours are Monday to Friday 9.00am till 4.30pm. Copies of the EIA Report may be obtained from Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission plc (Tel: 01463 728 047 / email: dan.thomas@sse.com ) at a cost of £800 for a hard copy and free of charge on a DVD/CD or USB. Copies of a Non-Technical Summary are available free of charge.\n\nAny representations on the application may be submitted to Scottish Ministers via the Energy Consents Unit website using reference ECU00003430 by email to the Scottish Government, Energy Consents Unit mailbox at representations@gov.scot; or by post to the Scottish Government, Energy Consents Unit, 4th Floor, 5 Atlantic Quay, 150 Broomielaw, Glasgow, G2 8LU, identifying the proposal and specifying the grounds for representation. Please note that there may be a delay in the ECU receiving representations by post. Written or emailed representations should be dated, clearly stating the name (in block capitals) and full postal address of those making representations. Representations made by email should also include the full return email address of those making representations. Only representations sent by email to representations@gov.scot will receive acknowledgement. Please note that the application reference number must be clearly stated in the representation.\n\nAll representations should be made such that they are received by Scottish Ministers not later than 21st June 2023 although Scottish Ministers may consider representations received after this date. Any subsequent additional information which is submitted by the developer will be subject to further public notice in this manner, and representations on such information will be accepted as per this notice.\n\nAs a result of a statutory objection from the relevant planning authority, or where Scottish Ministers decide to exercise their discretion to do so, Scottish Ministers can also cause a public inquiry to be held. Following examination of the environmental information, Scottish Ministers will determine the application for consent in one of two ways:\n\nConsent the proposal with or without conditions attached; or\n\nReject the proposal.\n\nShould you have any questions relating to the development proposals or wish to receive a copy of the application please do not hesitate to contact the community Liasion Manager"
