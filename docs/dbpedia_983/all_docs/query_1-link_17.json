        "text": "The 1820 Parliament\n\nAbout forty years ago Austin Mitchell analysed voting behaviour in the 1820 Parliament as part of his study of the Whig party in opposition from 1815 to 1830. He conceded that his ‘method of analysis … does not accord with vague contemporary classifications’, but argued that it ‘does accord with voting habits and is reasonably comprehensive’. He devised the categories of ‘government’, ‘government fringe’, ‘opposition’, ‘opposition fringe’ and ‘waverers’, into which the 683 Members who voted in the divisions examined were placed. The results were:\n\nGovernment\n\nGovernment fringe\n\nWaverers\n\nOpposition\n\nfringe\n\nOpposition\n\n250\n\n99\n\n114\n\n66\n\n154\n\nThis, he wrote, produced ‘a picture of a House with a two-party system modified by the existence of unreliable groups on the fringes of both sides, and by a cushion group between the two, whose voting record indicates no attachment to either party’. What follows here is an analysis of voting behaviour in this Parliament on the same principles (in the first instance at least), but covering a much larger number of division lists than those used by Mitchell. He took eleven divisions ‘in which government and opposition clashed and for which the votes of both sides … are recorded’. He supplemented the basic results with an examination of voting in a further 203 ‘political’ divisions for which only the names of opposition voters (almost always the minorities) were given. The analysis here is based on 62 divisions (51 more than those studied by Mitchell) in which both government and opposition voters are listed: for 47 of these, there are full lists of both majority and minority; and for the other 15 there are partial lists only, usually of ministerial placemen in the majority. The other ‘political’ divisions for which only opposition voters are listed number 310 (107 more than those used by Mitchell). The source for these additional lists is The Times. Less than two-thirds of the lists printed there (usually within one or two days of the occurrence of the relevant division) were incorporated in Parliamentary Debates. Like Mitchell’s, this analysis excludes all divisions on Catholic relief; but, unlike his, it includes those on parliamentary reform, as there is no convincing reason for omitting them.\n\nIn the 62 ‘double divisions’, 335 Members voted only with government and 193 only with opposition. This compares with figures of 361 and 206 respectively for the 11 divisions examined by Mitchell. Thus 528 Members, or 66 per cent of the 802 who were returned to this Parliament, voted consistently in these divisions. Forty-six Members cast no known vote in the 372 divisions considered here, although a fair number of them did vote on Catholic relief. A strict application of the criteria used by Mitchell produces the following basic analysis of the 756 Members who voted in these divisions:\n\nGovernment\n\nGovernment fringe\n\nWaverers\n\nOpposition fringe\n\nOpposition\n\n204\n\n113\n\n186\n\n113\n\n140\n\nThis suggests an even looser party system than that found by Mitchell, if only because the inclusion of an additional 158 divisions in the analysis increases the potential for detecting wayward voting. An adjustment to this basic analysis can be made by discarding Mitchell’s stringent allowance of a deviation of only one per cent for Members who voted consistently in the ‘double’ divisions but cast wayward votes in one or more of the other 310, which inflates the number of ‘waverers’, and substituting ten per cent. This increases the ‘government fringe’ to 131 and reduces the ‘waverers’ to 168. Considerable further refinement is possible by the application of common sense and detailed knowledge of the political allegiances, beliefs and behaviour of individual Members.\n\nThirty-five can reasonably be moved from ‘government fringe’ to ‘government’ by virtue of their steady and general support of the Liverpool ministry and the infrequency of their wayward voting, which often occurred on issues of no great significance. These Members include George Canning, foreign secretary from August 1822; James Brogden, chairman of ways and means; Thomas Courtenay, secretary to the board of control; the Grenvillite William Fremantle, a member of the board of control from February 1822; Charles Grant, Irish secretary until December 1821 and vice-president of the board of trade from April 1823; Michael Nolan, a Welsh judge; Sir Francis Ommanney, a navy agent; William Peel, brother of Robert, the home secretary; and William Vesey Fitzgerald, a former junior minister who rejoined the government in July 1826. A further four Members should be transferred from ‘waverers’ to ‘government’: the Grenvillites Charles Williams Wynn and Joseph Phillimore, president and a member respectively of the board of control from February 1822; Charles Wetherell, who, after a burst of independence over the Queen Caroline affair in 1821, was made solicitor-general in January 1824; and Robert Wilmot Horton, colonial under-secretary from December 1821. This takes the ‘government’ total to 243, seven fewer than Mitchell’s figure. Some 70 of them were office or place-holders. At least 43 Members ought to be transferred from ‘opposition fringe’ to ‘opposition’. They may have divided very occasionally with government, but it would be a nonsense not to include in the ranks of committed opposition Members the following: Alexander Baring (voted 51 times against government); Ralph Bernal (over 200 times); Lord William Cavendish Bentinck (43); Sir Francis Blake (78); Sir John Fenton Boughey (56); Henry Bright (161); Thomas Fowell Buxton (52); John Calcraft (151); Charles Calvert (108); Sir Isaac Coffin (60); William Evans (201); Robert Farrand (49); Robert ‘Bum’ Gordon (209); Pascoe Grenfell (67); Hudson Gurney (44); William Haldimand (79); William James (158); William Leader (65); John Lockhart (43); John Maberly (158); William Leader Maberly (160); Stewart Marjoribanks (110); John Martin (206); John Maxwell (67); Samuel Moulton Barrett (133); Sir John Newport (152); Sir Henry Parnell (94); William Powlett (71); George Purefoy Jervoise (83); David Ricardo (over 200 in four sessions); William Rickford (101); Sir Matthew White Ridley (70); Abraham Robarts (153); George Robarts (150); James Scarlett (105); Sir John Sebright (55); John Smith (107); Robert Percy ‘Bobus’ Smith (60); Lord Stanley (61); John Warre (85); William Wolryche Whitmore (69); Sir Robert Wilson (165); and William Wrixon (48). Some others of the ‘opposition fringe’ have been left in that category because their frequency of voting was not high; but they include such stalwart Whigs as George Agar Ellis, Charles Dundas, Archibald Farquharson, John Foster Barham, Henry Labouchere, Charles Kemeys Tynte, William Maule, George and Samuel Smith, Edward Smith Stanley, William Stewart, Richard Wogan Talbot and Walter Wilkins. Thus the revised figure for ‘opposition’ becomes 183. At 164, the ‘waverers’ are far too numerous. (Four have been moved to ‘government’, as noted above.) A further 69 should be transferred to ‘government fringe’ on the strength of the steadiness of their support for the government and the relative infrequency of their deviations. They include William Courtenay (who voted 29 times with government and against only four); Robert Bransby Cooper (28 for, four against); William Gordon (the same); Michael Prendergast (21 for and two against); Frederick Trench (the same); Robert Downie (20 for and five against); Charles Madryll Cheere (20 for and four against); Sir Miles Nightingall (19 for and two against); and Frank Sotheron (19 for and two against). Lord Hotham voted with government 24 times and George Holme Sumner 19 times; but they deviated nine and eight times respectively. This adjustment makes the final ‘government fringe’ total 165. Of the remaining 95 ‘waverers’, 45 have been moved to ‘opposition fringe’ as Members who divided against the government at least twice as often as they voted with it. ‘Opposition fringe’ thus becomes 115 and ‘waverers’ are reduced to a more realistic 50. This is on a par with contemporary estimates of the number of neutral or unattached Members in 1818, which Mitchell’s analysis led him to believe were significantly inaccurate. These Members include the following men whose conduct was markedly independent, although most of them inclined to Toryism: Sir Thomas Dyke Acland; Sir John Astley; Henry Bankes; Edmund Bastard; Joseph Cripps; Gabriel Doveton; Cuthbert Ellison; John Fane I; Charles Forbes; Henry Handley; Sir Edward Knatchbull; the Canningite Edward John Littleton; John Plummer; Alexander Robertson; William Thompson; Thomas Wilson; and Edmond Wodehouse. Of these, Acland, Astley, Bastard, Fane, Knatchbull, Littleton and Wodehouse were county Members; while Wilson represented the livery of London.\n\nThe refined analysis of voting behaviour in this Parliament is therefore as follows:\n\nGovernment\n\nGovernment fringe\n\nWaverers\n\nOpposition fringe\n\nOpposition\n\n243\n\n165\n\n50\n\n115\n\n183\n\nThe combined total of ‘government’ and ‘government fringe’ is 408, or 59 more than in Mitchell’s analysis. ‘Opposition’ and ‘opposition fringe’ together account for 298, that is 78 more than Mitchell found. ‘Waverers’ are reduced by 64. In percentage terms, the two analyses compare as follows:\n\nG\n\nGF\n\nW\n\nOF\n\nO\n\nNumber voting\n\nMitchell\n\n37\n\n14\n\n17\n\n10\n\n22\n\n683\n\nHere\n\n32\n\n22\n\n7\n\n15\n\n24\n\n756\n\nFirm allegiance to a party operated among some 56 per cent of Members, while a further 37 per cent were more tenuously attached, though in the majority of cases the extent of their deviation was comparatively slight. The theoretical figure of 408 potential supporters of the Liverpool ministry is almost the same as that of 411 in 1818 suggested by Professor Peter Jupp; but the figure for potential opposition, at 297, is very much greater than the 198 which he found in 1818. However, the hard core of 182 oppositionists identified here is close to that total. When he accepted the leadership of the Whig opposition in the Commons in the summer of 1818, George Tierney put their ‘positive’ strength in the House at 175, ‘exclusive of a very considerable body which, to say the least of it, is unconnected with government’. By allocating to a notional House of 658 Members the categories described here in the same proportions as those in which they make up the total of 756 voting Members, a theoretical but convincing ‘snapshot’ picture emerges of ‘government’ 210; ‘government fringe’ 144; ‘waverers’ 46; ‘opposition fringe’ 99; and ‘opposition’ 159.\n\nAs Mitchell observed, this was a House in which the ministry could rely on a majority in normal circumstances. At the same time, it was one in which, given the right combination of factors, it could occasionally be defeated on a specific issue. In the 372 divisions scrutinized for this survey, ministers were defeated only nine times: on a motion for repeal of the additional malt duty, 21 Mar. 1821 (149-125); Lord Normanby’s proposal to abolish one of the joint-postmasterships, 2 May 1822 (216-201); Sir James Mackintosh’s motion to consider criminal law reform, 4 June 1822 (117-101); the third reading of Henry Grey Bennet’s public house licensing bill, 27 June 1822 (38-21); Sir Francis Burdett’s motion for inquiry into the Irish administration’s prosecution of the Dublin Orange theatre rioters who had threatened the lord lieutenant, 22 Apr. 1823 (219-185); the second reading of the Scottish juries bill, a Whig measure, 20 June 1823 (47-42); the second reading of the St. Olave (Hart Street) tithe bill, which was sponsored likewise, 6 June 1825 (55-36); Lord John Russell’s motion for inquiry into the petition of James Silk Buckingham concerning the freedom of the press in India, 9 May 1826 (43-40); and his resolutions condemning electoral bribery, 26 May 1826 (62-62, but carried by the Speaker’s casting vote as being merely declaratory). Only the first two and Burdett’s success signified much; and the vote on the malt duty was emphatically reversed (242-144) by a government rally against the second reading of the repeal bill, 3 Apr. 1821. This recurrent feature of the period, the reliance on and occasional expedient mustering by ministers of their unthinking lobby fodder, was publicly satirized in verse by the maverick ‘opposition fringe’ Member Edward Davies Davenport in 1823:\n\nHark! the loud flappings of the lobby door\n\nAnnounces the lab’rers of the eleventh hour:\n\nLike gulls or cormorants at evening tide,\n\nSome scream out, ‘Question!’, some ‘Divide, Divide!’\n\nSome cry, ‘Hear, hear!’ when all around are mute,\n\nAnd thus create the nuisance they impute;\n\nWhile, as the bird in ivy-bush demure,\n\nThe Speaker suffers what he cannot cure.\n\nIf, as at times will happen, England’s fate,\n\nOr Empire’s freedom, hang on the debate,\n\nThough rhetoric not unworthy ancient Rome\n\nBring to the unwilling breast conviction home,\n\nStill to his object true, the clamorous brute\n\nDumbfounds the logic which he can’t refute;\n\nTill once victorious, and well counted out,\n\nThe blockheads ask you, ‘What it’s all about?’\n\nThe antipathy of the vast majority of the government’s ‘fringe’ or general supporters and of many of the ‘waverers’ to the prospect of a Whig ministry made them reluctant to carry their opposition to measures too far and ready to rally to ministers if they cracked the whip. In any case, those who cast wayward votes were only exercising what they considered their right to follow their conscientious judgement on specific issues. This was part of the rhetorical stock-in-trade of ministerialist backbenchers on the hustings and in the House. Constituency pressures also influenced the votes of some Members, especially those for counties and the larger boroughs. These attitudes and the responsiveness of backbenchers, who were not beholden to a party for their seats, to constituency opinion, persisted after 1832, as events during Peel’s second ministry, 1841-6, amply demonstrated.\n\nAt the general election of 1820, the Whig opposition, who had performed creditably in resisting the government’s post-Peterloo repressive legislation, probably gained about ten seats overall. Under Tierney’s leadership they initially did well in the short 1820 session, mustering quite strongly against the civil list on 5 and 8 May (minorities of 155 and 157, albeit against ministerial majorities of 273 and 256) and coming within 12 votes of defeating the government over the recent appointment of an additional Scottish exchequer court judge, 15 May. Thereafter attendance fell away and disunity increased as the radical wing of opposition took the initiative. George IV’s bid to divorce his wife Caroline, who returned to England to assert her rights, seemed to present a realistic chance of turning out the ministry, but opposition leaders and activists were divided on the contentious issue. A motion by the highly respected backbencher William Wilberforce urging the queen to make concessions, 22 June, attracted 391 votes, against which the opposition secured only 124. Four days later the government’s proposal to set up a ‘green bag’ secret committee to investigate Caroline’s allegedly scandalous conduct abroad was carried by 195-100. The abandonment of the bill of pains and penalties against the queen after its third reading passed the Lords by only nine votes, 9 Nov. 1820, George’s fury with his ministers and the upsurge of popular indignation in support of the queen and a change of regime, which the Whig leaders, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, attempted to mobilize, created an uncharacteristic mood of optimism in the ranks of opposition on the eve of the 1821 session. No amendment to the address was moved, but on 23 Jan. 169 Members voted for the Tory Wetherell’s motion for information on liturgies, a prelude to an attack on the omission of the queen’s name from the current one. The government majority numbered 260. After an internal squabble the Scottish Whig Lord Archibald Hamilton was allowed to bring forward his motion on this question ahead of Lord Tavistock’s planned motion of censure of ministers’ conduct. Hamilton’s resolution condemning the omission of Caroline’s name, 26 Jan., got 209 votes against 310; but when Tavistock moved his censure, 6 Feb., it was crushed by 324-178. The effective end of the campaign came on 13 Feb., when John Smith’s call for restoration of Caroline’s name to the liturgy was rejected by 298-178. Charles Long, the paymaster-general, had been confident before the campaign that ‘our country gentlemen … are stout and firm’; and the ministerialist Lord Ancram wrote on 2 Feb. 1821, even before the defeat of the censure motion, that ‘we have been most triumphant, more so than the most sanguine could have anticipated considering the state of the country and the means that the Whigs took to commit the country gentlemen’. The conservative and disillusioned Whig William Lamb, who had perversely voted against the government after speaking in almost the opposite sense, told his brother Frederick, 23 Feb., that\n\nthe interest respecting the queen seems to be subsiding quietly, as … everything which is so very foolish must in time. The Whigs blundered the business … Whilst the trial was going on, there was undoubtedly a strong, real, vivid feeling; but after the bill was given up, the feeling that was manufactured was for the most part fictitious, belonging to party and excited by the Whigs themselves. If they had remained quiet and adopted the tone of wishing to tranquillize the country out of doors, I think they would have had a better chance of attacking the ministry within. As it was, they did what they always will do when they make a manifest reach at power. They called forth a very strong expression on the part of the House of Commons that however much they might disapprove of the ministers, they dreaded the opposition still more.\n\nThe voting in the divisions of 26 Jan., 6 and 13 Feb. 1821 confirms this:\n\nGovt.\n\nGovt.\n\nFringe\n\nWaverers\n\nOppn. Fringe\n\nOppn.\n\nGovt. vote\n\n189\n\n101\n\n26\n\n17\n\nMixed votes\n\n6\n\n4\n\n5\n\nOne oppn. vote\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\nTwo oppn. votes\n\n13\n\n32\n\nThree oppn. votes\n\n2\n\n22\n\n119\n\nTotals\n\n189\n\n108\n\n34\n\n67\n\n146\n\nThus a third of the ‘opposition fringe’ who voted divided three times against government, but as many sided with them against the censure motion. Eight of the 34 ‘waverers’ who voted cast at least one vote against government, but half of these plus 26 others divided with them on 6 Feb. Only seven of the ‘government fringe’ cast a vote against the ministry, but six of them, plus 101 of the 108 who voted, were in their majority against the censure motion. Although the Whigs mustered 125 votes (against 194) in support of Mackintosh’s motion condemning the Holy Alliance’s suppression of the liberal regime in Naples, 21 Feb., they were falling into disarray. When Tierney, ground down by poor health and sick of being left to sink or swim by the idle titular leader Lord Grey, resigned the Commons leadership in the first week of March, chaos seemed to threaten. In the middle of the month Charles Williams Wynn told Lord Buckingham that opposition Members ‘are outrageous against each other, and, according to [the Whig James] Macdonald’s report, may be expected by the next session to split into three or more distinct parties’. Repeal of the additional malt duty was temporarily carried against the government, and Lord John Russell secured a respectable vote of 124 (against 155) for his parliamentary reform motion, 9 May; but for most of the second half of the 1821 session the opposition running was made by the radicals and advanced Whigs of the ‘Mountain’, with their continuing campaign of obstruction to and divisions against the estimates: the foreign secretary Lord Castlereagh described it as ‘a Pindari [marauding] warfare’. The leading and most active combatants were the indefatigable bore Joseph Hume, Grey Bennet, Bernal, Bright, Lord Bury, Thomas Creevey, Thomas Davies, Sir Ronald Ferguson, ‘Bum’ Gordon, Edward Harbord, Christopher Hely Hutchinson, John Cam Hobhouse, John Maberly, John Martin, John Monck, Charles Fyshe Palmer, Parnell, Ricardo, William Smith, Sir Robert Wilson, Matthew Wood and Marmaduke Wyvill. Mainstream Whigs, including Tierney, joined in the campaign with different degrees of enthusiasm and frequency. Minorities were generally small, but there were more impressive musters on the army estimates, 14 Mar. (115); the navy estimates, 4 May (77); the ordnance estimates, 14 May (78); miscellaneous services, 28 May (77) and the award to the duke of Clarence, 18 June (81). Hume’s motion for economy and retrenchment, 27 June 1821, received 94 votes against 174.\n\nThe ministry was strengthened at the turn of the year by Robert Peel’s replacement of Lord Sidmouth as home secretary and, more controversially, by the recruitment of the Grenvillites, who offered a theoretical 11 votes in the Commons, at the cost of a dukedom for Buckingham and office for Williams Wynn, Fremantle, Phillimore and William Plunket. Yet Thomas Wallace, vice-president of the board of trade, felt that they had been ‘purchased … at a price much beyond the value of any strength or credit they bring to our support’, and predicted that the government’s ‘great difficulty in the ensuing session will arise from the agriculturists, who I suspect will make a violent assault upon our taxation, with what success it is in these times impossible to say’. Despite the government’s ‘large majority’ (171-89) on the address, 5 Feb. 1822, the patronage secretary Charles Arbuthnot detected ‘a very unpleasant temper in the House’, with the Tory ‘country gentlemen … very much for taking off taxes’ to relieve the severe agricultural distress. Yet the Whigs were in no state to exploit the potential of this situation. Mackintosh felt on the eve of the session that ‘the parliamentary prospect is very disheartening’, for ‘we are no longer a party’ and ‘every man is in a great measure left to act according to his own judgement or according to his want of it’. John Lambton, who perceived that ‘amongst the old stagers of what was our party in the House of Commons there seems the greatest apathy’, begged his father-in-law Grey to come to London to impose some discipline and purpose, as it was ‘impossible to conceive anything more disunited than the opposition, many anxious to be in action, but not knowing what to do and having no one to point out to them the best mode’. Henry Brougham’s motion calling for extensive tax reductions to relieve agricultural distress, 11 Feb., secured only 108 votes to 212, as some Whigs, including Tierney, stayed away and two dozen were accidentally shut out. When it became clear that the tax cuts offered by ministers had not appeased their disgruntled backbenchers, the Whigs moved, through Lord Althorp, a resolution that the concessions were inadequate, but this was defeated by 234-136. Yet on Calcraft’s proposal for the gradual reduction of the salt duties, 28 Feb., the ministerial majority fell to four (169-165). On 1 Mar. Ridley carried by 182-128 a motion to reduce the number of junior lords of the admiralty, and on the 13th Lord Normanby’s proposal to abolish one of the joint-postmasterships was defeated by only 25 votes (184-159). When Normanby changed this motion into one for an address to the king to the same effect, 2 May, he was successful by 216-201. The independent Tory Henry Bankes considered that ‘these occasional defeats neither shake nor endanger ministers’, and indeed answered the arguments of reformers by showing that ‘when a strong case is made out, the representative body as at present constituted is able and ready to counteract the wishes and influence of the government’. Some ministers took a dimmer view. Arbuthnot responded to the setback on 1 Mar. by issuing a circular note requesting attendance to resist impending opposition attacks. It fell into enemy hands and Russell raised it in the House as a breach of privilege, 15 Mar. Arbuthnot admitted his authorship and tried to justify the letter, and the Speaker intervened to brush the matter under the carpet. Lord Londonderry (as Castlereagh now was) took a more relaxed attitude to these defeats, but after that on the postmastership he was goaded by the less tolerant Peel into announcing that if ministers were defeated on the forthcoming motions on diplomatic expenditure and Henry Williams Wynn’s embassy to Switzerland, they would resign. This did the trick, as government supporters came out of the woodwork, while some who had cast wayward votes earlier in the session rallied to produce majorities of 274-147 on diplomatic expenditure, 15 May, and 247-141 on the Swiss embassy (an attack on the Grevillites) the next day. On 24 June Brougham’s motion condemning the parliamentary influence of the crown was defeated by 216-101; and a proposal to repeal the salt duties was rejected by a majority of 12, 28 June 1822. The effect of the resignation threat is clearly shown by an analysis of opposition votes on three motions either side of it;\n\nGovt. Fringe\n\nWaverers\n\nOppn. Fringe\n\nOppn.\n\nSalt, 28 Feb.\n\n11\n\n7\n\n31\n\n118\n\nAdmiralty, 1 Mar.\n\n20\n\n15\n\n30\n\n114\n\nPaymaster, 2 May\n\n12\n\n19\n\n45\n\n143\n\nDiplomacy, 15 May\n\n1\n\n0\n\n21\n\n127\n\nSwiss embassy, 16 May\n\n0\n\n1\n\n21\n\n114\n\nCrown 24 June\n\n0\n\n1\n\n7\n\n102\n\nWhile the number of hostile votes from the opposition and its ‘fringe’ remained high, those from the ‘government fringe’ and the ‘waverers’ became almost non-existent from mid-May 1822. A couple of inconsequential episodes concerning party in this session have come to light. In late February Agar Ellis and his friends Lord Titchfield, the short-lived heir of the 4th duke of Portland, and Charles Baring Wall had discussions about setting up a ‘small independent party in the House of Commons, for the purpose of watching over the interests of the country, and guarding them alike against ministers and opposition, who are too apt to run counter to them, the former in trying to keep and the latter in trying to get places’. Titchfield’s uncle Lord William Cavendish Bentinck expressed an interest and there was talk of trying to recruit William Lamb, who had now washed his hands of the Whigs. Nothing seems to have come of this, or of a similar scheme broached on paper by the disillusioned Canningite Charles Tennyson in April 1823. More bizarrely, Hobhouse recorded in his diary in mid-May 1822 that Tavistock had told him that he and several other Whigs were of opinion\n\nthat Burdett was the only man fit to be the leader [of the party in the Commons] and [asked] whether Burdett would be active and … would take a great place in case the ministers were driven out. He told me that he had reason to believe Lord Grey was not averse to the arrangement and that he knew Lord Holland was not.\n\nHobhouse sounded Burdett, who said\n\nhe would undertake anything that would forward the great cause of reform for which he had been contending all his life; that if the party thought he could serve them he would be at their disposal to lead, to take office or to do anything … understanding always that reform was to be the basis of their whole plan.\n\nTavistock evidently tried and largely failed to secure sufficient influential support for this fanciful project, which had ended in smoke by mid-June 1822. During the negotiations with Canning which followed Londonderry’s suicide in August 1822, John Croker, secretary to the admiralty, wrote to Peel of his wish that Canning should either stick to his plan of going to govern India or join the ministry as foreign secretary and leader of the House, for he feared that if Canning was driven into opposition by the king’s personal hostility to him he might draw off about 40 ministerialists and so ‘be at the head of the most powerful floating party which has existed for near a century in Parliament’. In the event, Canning’s accession to office brought to an ‘end the period of political uncertainty, which had lasted from 1820’.\n\nThe intensity of party conflict diminished markedly in the following four sessions, as more liberal government policies and the lifting of distress took effect. Of the divisions used for this survey, 17 occurred in 1820, 91 in 1821, and 88 in 1822—a total of 196, or an average of 65 per session. There were 66 in 1823, 47 in 1824, 29 in 1825 and 34 in 1826—a total of 176 or an average of 44 per session. There were party clashes on foreign policy and Ireland (including the ex-officio prosecutions of the Dublin Orange rioters, on which the government was beaten by a combination of regular oppositionists and defectors from their own ‘fringe’, 22 Apr. 1823). A minority of 136 (to 184) voted for inquiry into the state of Ireland, 11 May 1824. The government’s bill to suppress the Catholic Association was stoutly but of course unavailingly resisted in February 1825. Parliamentary reform received an airing in 1823, when motions for general reform, 24 Apr., and reform in Scotland, 2 June, were defeated by 280-169 and 152-117 respectively. The issue went into abeyance until April 1826, when Russell’s renewed motion received a respectable 123 votes (against 247). Most Whigs were now firmly in favour of reform. Brougham’s motion condemning the prosecution of the Methodist missionary John Smith for inciting slaves in Demerara to riot, 11 June 1824, attracted ‘government fringe’ and ‘waverer’ support and was beaten by 193-146. There was spirited opposition to the grant for the duke of Cumberland and his son Prince George in 1825, when some ‘government fringe’ Members and ‘waverers’ boosted the opposition minorities. The proposal to separate the offices of president of the board of trade and treasurer of the navy and award each a ministerial salary was only carried by 87-76, 10 Apr. 1826, and was subsequently abandoned. The Whigs remained without authoritative leadership in the Commons, where the mercurial Brougham was the dominant figure. However, his unpopularity among a section of the party and his own reluctance to jeopardize his career at the bar ensured that he was never formally installed as leader. In March 1823 the whip Lord Duncannon and Lambton proposed a scheme for regular party dinner meetings as part of ‘a republican form of government for the opposition’. Russell advocated the establishment of ‘a committee … of seven to ten Members to put business into some form previously to general meetings’. Brougham would have nothing to do with the plan, which foundered. Davenport turned his poetic venom on the Whigs in 1823:\n\nObserve our friends, in-doors on gala days,\n\nLike bulls in harness bearing different ways;\n\nOne eye on Britain’s weal intently fixed,\n\nThe other leers at objects somewhat mixed:\n\nHope-pleasure-wife-small babes-desire of peace—\n\n(In other words, of funded stock’s increase)\n\nReform-the Tithe-the Debt-(would you refuse\n\nA truly Christian sympathy for Jews?).\n\nWhen mortals are so puzzled to look straight,\n\nNo wonder many shuffle in their gait …\n\nOur Monster chuckles; he may well prevail\n\nO’er forces (who scarce molest him) in detail;\n\nWhile Hume like Sisyphus pursues his toil,\n\nScoffed by the recreant owners of the soil,\n\nOr Burdett speaks, we listen in despair\n\nTo Truth’s loud thunders howled in empty air;\n\nThe House divides, and lo! her sacred ends\n\nFall half-defeated by—inconstant friends.\n\nIn 1824 the Irish Member Henry Westenra reported that ‘parties in the House are at so very low an ebb at the moment … that people do not now so much look after making an interest to stick by them always, as they did in the days of Fox and Pitt’. The young Tory Lord Mahon observed in 1826 that ‘the present unanimity of most people tends very much to diminish the importance of party’. To the Whig James Abercromby it seemed that with ‘a ministry and opposition alike broken and divided’, ‘party distinctions in the ordinary sense are destroyed, but party distinctions in the form of old and new principles … exist in full force’. A new feature of politics by then was the emergence of the notion of ‘His Majesty’s opposition’, who were prepared to judge measures on their merits and support those which they believed advanced the national good. George Traill, later Member for Orkney, wrote in October 1825 that it was now ‘admitted that a regular opposition is essential to the existence of our system of government’. This was particularly significant given the growing rift between the more liberal elements in the administration, led by Canning, and the more conservative spirits. The Catholic question was central to this, but the issues of currency, corn laws and protection of domestic industry also divided the government and a number of its customary supporters in the Commons. In early March 1826 Charles Percy, just returned for Newport on the duke of Northumberland’s interest, told his friend Ralph Sneyd that ‘I come into Parliament at a strange moment, when all the cheers that animate [Frederick] Robinson [the chancellor of the exchequer] and Canning are from the opposition benches, and those behind the treasury [bench] as silent as the grave!’ In 1826, four of the ‘government fringe’ and six ‘waverers’ voted against aspects of the ministerial measures to restrict the circulation of small bank notes. The Whig Edward Ellice’s motion for inquiry into distress in the silk trade had five ‘government fringe’ and three ‘waverers’ in its minority of 40. More significantly, the government’s proposal for the emergency admission of foreign corn, 8 May, was opposed by 13 of their ‘fringe’ supporters and seven ‘waverers’, who made up 20 of the minority of 51. On 11 May 1826 the second reading of their relaxed corn bill, carried by 189-65, was opposed by 14 of the ‘fringe’ and eight ‘waverers’. Six of the ‘government fringe’ and four ‘waverers’ divided against government on both occasions, as did their steadfast supporter Lord Charles Manners, doubtless with an eye on his Cambridgeshire farming constituents. Lord Holland predicted in September 1825 that disputes over Catholic relief and economic issues would sooner or later throw the existing party system into disarray and lead to realignments. Eighteen months later his prophecy was fulfilled.\n\nThe 1826 Parliament\n\nAfter his return for Cambridge University, with Whig support, at the 1826 general election, the pro-Catholic war secretary Lord Palmerston wrote to his brother:\n\nAs to the commonplace balance between opposition and government, the election will have little effect upon it. The government are as strong as any government can wish to be, as far as regards those who sit facing them; but in truth the real opposition of the present day sit behind the treasury bench; and it is by the stupid old Tory party, who bawl out the memory and praises of Pitt while they are opposing all the measures and principles which he held most important … that the progress of the government in every improvement which they are attempting is thwarted and impeded. On the Catholic question, on the principles of commerce, on the corn laws, on the settlement of the currency, on the laws regulating the trade in money, on colonial slavery, on the game laws … the government find support from the Whigs and resistance from their self-denominated friends. However, the young squires are more liberal than the old ones, and we must hope that heaven will protect us from our friends, as it has from our enemies.\n\nThe Catholic question was the major issue in many constituencies at the 1826 general election, and it was reckoned that overall those hostile to relief gained about 13 seats, mostly in open English constituencies. This was borne out when Sir Francis Burdett’s motion of 6 Mar. 1827 to consider Catholic claims was defeated (for the first time since 3 May 1819) by 276-272. In late June 1826, when the elections were almost over, Lord John Russell, fresh from his defeat in Huntingdonshire, commented to Lord Holland that the Whig opposition’s\n\npresent situation is … most unpleasant. We lose in opinion by supporting the liberal part of the ministry, and when we fight a battle in the elections we find the whole force of government at work to oppose us … I am glad to be out of such a mess. Last session I voted with ministers even when I thought their measures imprudent and ill-timed, because I thought their general views sound and liberal. But I believe the only way is to say boldly what one thinks of their base compromise [on Catholic relief], and support nothing that is not undeniably a wise and well timed measure.\n\nIn October 1826 Russell’s uncle Lord William Russell encouraged him to propose his reform scheme as early as possible in the new Parliament, where ‘there are not wanting numbers indisposed to the ministry as it is now constituted, but there is wanting a right tone to the opposition’; but Russell did not raise the issue substantively until 1830. That month, according to Peel’s brother-in-law George Dawson, when Tierney was asked ‘what kind of campaign the opposition intended to carry on’, he replied, ‘“There is no opposition now. I and others have long since given it up, the parties now are the government and the Canningites, and I and a great many others are of the latter class”’. The leaderless and somewhat moribund state of the Whig opposition in the first months of what the cynical backbencher Hudson Gurney denoted ‘a very bad House of Commons [of] raw boys and fools’ is apparent from the voting figures in the 14 divisions on public issues between 21 Nov. 1826 and 5 Apr. 1827 for which lists survive. (That is, between the meeting of Parliament and the formation of Canning’s coalition ministry after protracted negotiations in the aftermath of Lord Liverpool’s incapacitating stroke in February 1827.) The largest opposition minority was the 80 who divided for Tierney’s motion for supplies to be withheld until the ministerial crisis had been resolved, 30 Mar. 1827. The smallest were those of 15 for Hume’s amendment to reduce the grant for barracks, 21 Feb., and his attempt to obstruct the duke and duchess of Clarence’s annuity bill, 16 Mar. The average opposition muster in these divisions was 47; but there was a noticeable increase in the level of participation from 29 Mar., when 69 voted for the production of papers on the Lisburn Orange march of 1825. The same number voted for inquiry into the Irish miscellaneous estimates and 66 for information on delays in chancery, 5 Apr. The largest turnouts on the government side were 335 against a 50s. fixed corn duty, 9 Mar., and 215 against enhanced protection for barley, 12 Mar., when the numbers were swollen by the support of oppositionists. Otherwise ministerial support did not reach 200. The only list of government voters which has been found is that of the 99 who divided for the Clarences’ annuity bill, 16 Mar. A hard core of 24 Members voted in at least seven of the fourteen opposition divisions analysed here: they were a mixture of mainstream if progressive Whigs, such as Lords Althorp, Howick and Morpeth, William Francis Ponsonby, Charles Poulett Thomson and William Smith; radical Whigs, such as Ralph Bernal, Joseph Birch, Sir Ronald Ferguson, John Cam Hobhouse, William Marshall, John Monck and Abraham Robarts; and the radical contingent of Thomas Davies, Daniel Whittle Harvey, Hume, John and William Maberly, Robert Waithman, Henry Warburton and Matthew Wood. Edward Lombe voted in the ministerial majority on 16 Mar. A further 56 Members, mostly Whigs, voted in between four and six of these divisions; but two of these, Alexander Baring and Josiah Guest, divided with ministers for the Clarences’ bill. Another 108 predominantly Whig Members cast between one and three hostile votes, but they included 17 who sided with government on 16 Mar.: Quintin Dick, Sir Charles and John Forbes, Thomas Fyler, Lord Arthur Hill, Charles Jephson, Lord Jermyn, George Lamb, Ralph Leycester, Anthony and Lord Maitland, Lucius O’Brien, Charles Nicholas Pallmer, Charles Tennyson, William Thompson, William Ward and William Battie Wrightson. Thus the reasonably active Whig and radical opposition stood potentially at about 90, with roughly as many again inclined to join them on occasion. In cruder terms, 168 Members (26 per cent of the House) cast only hostile votes. The 99 who divided with government on 16 Mar. included 23 official men. None of the latter voted in the protectionist minority of 78, which included 38 county Members, against the second reading of the corn bill, 2 Apr. (when the government muster was 243). However, 14 of the backbenchers did so: Matthias Attwood, Henry Bankes, Sir Edward East, Arthur French, Sir Thomas Lethbridge, the two Maitlands, Sir Scrope Morland, Christopher Smith, Sir George Smyth, Tennyson, Felix or Frederick Tollemache, James Wemyss and Thomas Wood. The Maitlands and Tennyson cast other wayward votes between November 1826 and April 1827. Of those who voted for the Clarences’ grant, 16 cast hostile votes on issues other than the corn bill: these included the Whigs Alexander Baring, John Calcraft and Jephson, and the radical John Maberly.\n\nLiverpool’s stroke and the eventual appointment of the pro-Catholic Canning as head of a ministry in coalition with the Whig followers of Lord Lansdowne, who, backed by Holland, had assumed the overall leadership of the party in place of the largely inactive Lord Grey, ushered in a four-session period of confusion and fragmentation in the party political situation in the Commons. The Whig James Macdonald, urging Lansdowne to throw in his lot with Canning in mid-April, reported that Lord Duncannon had told him that ‘the opposition’, before the junction, ‘may be fairly taken at 200’; but Brougham, a leading promoter of coalition, had told Lansdowne a fortnight earlier that ‘we have ceased to act as a party’. The broad Tory working alliance presided over by Liverpool was broken when the duke of Wellington, Peel and three dozen other mostly anti-Catholic office-holders resigned rather than serve under Canning. While some Whigs took office with him and others positively welcomed the development as marking the end of the long reactionary Tory hegemony, a greater number resolved to stay detached and await events, judging the ministry on its policies. A minority, including Grey, were overtly hostile, partly out of visceral dislike and distrust of the lowly born and often devious Canning, and partly from a conviction that their Lansdowne Whig friends were betraying the Catholic cause by accepting the king’s insistence that emancipation should remain an open question within a ‘balanced’ cabinet. When Canning’s ministry was more or less in place, the Whig backbencher John Hely Hutchinson, who was ‘all for supporting the new minister if he be inclined to play a fair and open game with respect to Ireland’, reported that ‘it is said that the Tories, or as they will henceforth be, the opposition, mean to make a great rally and to turn out the new ministry’. The Tory Lord John Hay, who counted himself as one of Peel’s ‘combinationist’ followers, told his brother that the new government might prove to be ‘formidable’ and that ‘party spirit runs high in town’, so that it was ‘hardly safe to open one’s mouth’. In the event, the opposition shirked any major showdown on a clear party issue, and the materials for assessing the relative strength of parties in the Commons during the short parliamentary life of the administration are therefore meagre. All parties were in any case internally divided to varying degrees, and many Members remained uncommitted or neutral. The former minister Lord Lowther depicted the Commons in late April as\n\nthe strangest jumble and mixture of parties that ever assembled in one room. There will be: the actual government; the seceders opposed; the seceders supporting government; some late supporters of government who will not vote at all. There will be: Whigs supporting government; Whigs against the government and the Mountain against all government. How to calculate upon the relative numbers of these different bodies is quite impossible at this time.\n\nCanning himself professed confidence of an ‘immense’ government majority in any party trial of strength. At the same time, the ministry had its own internal tensions, including over whipping arrangements. The Tory Robert Adam Dundas, another adherent of Peel, who had ‘not sat behind the treasury bench since the late changes’, felt at the end of May 1827 that as there was ‘not a great constitutional question on which the government is unanimous’, it must soon be brought down, but the ‘question to justify fair opposition’ that he craved did not materialize. Of the nine divisions for which opposition lists have been discovered, only four were on issues on which the ministry took a firm line: Michael Angelo Taylor’s motion to consider separating chancery from bankruptcy administration, 22 May (defeated by 134-37); Russell’s motion for the disfranchisement of the corrupt borough of Penryn (carried against government by 124-69, thus demonstrating their vulnerability on issues on which many Whigs were committed); Hume’s motion for repeal of the Blasphemous and Seditious Libels Act, 31 May (defeated by 120-10), and his attempt to kill the proposed grant of £56,000 for Canadian water defences, 12 June 1827 (defeated by 78-11). For the divisions on Penryn and Canadian canals lists of ministerial voters have also survived. One-hundred-and-forty-three Members voted against the government in at least one of these divisions. Of these, 98 did so only on the Penryn question; 13 only on the chancery issue; four only on Canadian canals, and one (Anthony Maitland) only for repeal of the Blasphemy Act. Of these 116 Members, nine had voted seven or more times against the Liverpool ministry earlier in the session, 31 had done so on four to six occasions, and 42 had cast between one and three hostile votes. Therefore 34 had not voted against the previous ministry in the divisions considered above. Twenty-eight Members, mostly Whig and radical activists, voted at least twice against Canning’s government in these four divisions. Of these, 12 had voted at least seven times against the Liverpool ministry, seven had done so between four and six times, five had cast between one and three hostile votes and four (John Cressett Pelham, John Maxwell, Lord Francis Osborne and Charles Fyshe Palmer) had given none. This points to a hard core of about 59 Whigs and radicals who persisted in their hostility to government after Canning’s accession to power, with another 47 inclined to opposition. The 38 who had not previously opposed government were mostly Whigs, but included a few anti-Catholic Tories, such as Lewis Buck, Robert Downie, Francis Mundy, Frank Sotheron and Thomas Tyrwhitt Drake. In the divisions on Penryn and Canadian canals, 122 Members cast a vote with the government. At least 26 were official men. Of those who were in the majority on the canals grant, 22 had voted for the disfranchisement of Penryn: Birch, Nicolson Calvert, Panton Corbett, Sir John Easthope, John Fazakerley, Cutlar Fergusson, ‘Bum’ Gordon, Sir James Graham, Samuel Kekewich, Henry Labouchere, George Lamb, Leycester, O’Brien, Poulett Thomson, Thomas Spring Rice, Lord Sandon, Robert Slaney, William Smith, Edward Smith Stanley, Edward Webb, Charles Wood and Sir John Wrottesley. All these except Corbett and Sandon were Whigs of various stripes. Birch and Webb also voted against the government on chancery jurisdiction, as did Buck, John Fane, the two Forbes, James Halse, Adam Hay and Tyrwhitt Drake. Canning’s premature death in early August 1827 ended his ministry. John Croker wrongly anticipated ‘a complete Tory government’, though he conceded that ‘an exclusive Protestant government cannot … stand’, as ‘there would be an opposition of 250, which would stop all public business’. In fact Canning’s coalition ministry was replaced in all essentials by that of Lord Goderich, though his feebleness and the inclusion, at the king’s insistence, of the anti-Catholic John Herries as chancellor of the exchequer seriously diminished Whig goodwill towards it and stiffened the determination of a number of leading Whigs either to oppose it or to scrutinize its actions critically. In the event, the ministry collapsed in January 1828 without meeting Parliament.\n\nWellington, asked by the king to form an administration, restored Peel and several of the anti-Catholic seceders, but also took into his cabinet the Canningite ex-ministers William Huskisson, Lord Palmerston, Charles Grant and Lord Dudley. This was done rather against his own preference and at the insistence of Peel, who saw that an exclusively Protestant government could not stand and wanted some able support in the Commons, which he was to lead as home secretary. He told his wife, ‘I cannot undertake the business … without more assistance than the mere Tory party … would afford me’. When the ministry had been settled he asked the Irish under-secretary William Gregory:\n\nWhat must have been the inevitable fate of a government composed of [Henry] Goulburn, Sir John Beckett, [Sir Charles] Wetherell, and myself? Supported by very warm friends, no doubt, but no more than warm friends, being prosperous country gentlemen, fox-hunters, most excellent men, who will attend one night, but who will not leave their favourite pursuits to sit up till two or three o’clock fighting questions of detail on which … a government must have a majority. We could not have stood creditably a fortnight.\n\nPeel probably did not need to have his attention drawn at the end of January by the Huskissonite Edward Littleton to ‘the most important party’ in the Commons, which consisted of ‘a few young men’, including Lords Eliot and Sandon and John Stuart Wortley, who ‘hang much together, and who though having different party connections [are] all united … against high Tory principles’. Two peers and seven Members of the Commons either retained their junior offices or took new ones, while another 15 Members and four peers resolved to back the ministry. A few Canningites either stayed neutral or, in the cases of Lord George Cavendish Bentinck, Morpeth and Lord Normanby, began to drift towards the Whigs. The Lansdowne Whigs were ditched. The Whigs as a whole were initially divided and leaderless, but some, notably the ‘Young Whigs’ Althorp and Lords Milton and Tavistock, decided on regular opposition to promote liberal policies, especially Catholic relief, in the hope of reuniting the party. The impact of this approach was lessened by the ministry’s generally conciliatory line on issues dear to Whig hearts, by the reluctance of some leading Whigs to risk driving it to the reactionary right by factious opposition and by egotistical rivalries and jealousies among the leading Commons protagonists, including the unbending radical coterie. At the end of January Littleton told Wellington in private that ‘as the last [Goderich] administration could not hold together it was evident no one party was strong enough to form one alone’; and on being asked if he had ‘noticed in the House of Commons any symptom of organization of opposition’, he replied, ‘none whatever. How could there be any? Every leading man of every party had been in some of the governments of the last year, and all had been parties to the same measures’. John Evelyn Denison, another Tory attached to Huskisson, reported that most Whigs ‘still do not consider themselves in direct opposition, nor is there anything like a concerted opposition formed’. He could ‘not see the elements for much disputation’, apart from personal attacks on Huskisson. The Whig George Fortescue thought ‘the duke’s government will stand better than any other, in the present most strange and unmanageable state of both Houses’. As it happened, the alliance in government between Wellington and the Huskissonites was uneasy and short-lived. It survived crises over repeal of the Test Acts in February and, narrowly, relaxation of the corn laws in March, but foundered on the question of whether to transfer the seats of the corrupt boroughs of East Retford and Penryn to large unrepresented towns or to sluice them in the traditional manner. Huskisson’s blustering offer of resignation in May 1828 was eagerly accepted by Wellington, and Huskisson, Dudley, Palmerston, Charles Grant, William Lamb and five others left office. Lists of ‘the ejected liberals’, who were, ‘for a nascent party, strong in Parliament’, compiled by Palmerston soon afterwards identified in all some 26 Members ‘who may be supposed as agreeing pretty much in opinion and likely to find themselves voting the same way’: Huskisson, Palmerston, William Lamb, Charles and Robert Grant, William Sturges Bourne, Robert Wilmot Horton, Thomas Frankland Lewis, Lord Francis Leveson Gower, Sandon, Augustus Ellis, Stuart Wortley, Denison, William Lascelles, James Loch, Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, Arthur Chichester, John Fitzgerald, Sir Stratford Canning, Jermyn, Littleton, Sir George Warrender, Henry Liddell, Thomas Barrett Lennard, Spencer Perceval and Cavendish Bentinck (the last four were marked ‘probable’). In addition, Morpeth and Normanby were reckoned to be ‘well disposed’. Palmerston counted on 13 adherents or sympathizers in the Lords. Lord Colchester made a partial list of 17 ‘who form the Huskisson party or rather the rump of the Canning party’, evidently ‘as per the list which the Speaker showed me’. He included Hylton Jolliffe and Thomas Hyde Villiers, who did not appear on any of Palmerston’s lists. Wellington replaced the departed ministers with a mixture of pro- and anti-Catholic Tories, the Whig Calcraft and even two of the Huskissonites, namely Leveson Gower and Perceval. Wilmot Horton was offered office but declined it.\n\nTo consider the Commons opposition to the Wellington ministry in the 1828 session, 33 minority lists have been used. Only nine of these divisions occurred in the period 11 Feb.-20 May, that is before the resignation of the Huskissonites; the remainder took place between 5 June and 14 July, with the bulk of them between 16 June and 4 July. Government majority lists have been found for three: on chancery delays, 24 Apr.; the ordnance estimates, 4 July, when the muster was 204 (second only to that of 258 on the East Retford question, 2 June); and the customs bill, 14 July. A total of 217 Members (33 per cent of the House) cast only opposition votes in one or more of these divisions; but only 64, the usual Whig and radical suspects, divided at least seven times. A further 47 cast between four and six hostile votes. These too were Whigs and radicals, with the exception of the anti-Catholic Tory Sir Richard Vyvyan. The remaining 106 included at least 50 Whigs, with the addition of a number of anti-Catholic Tories, some independent Members and the Huskissonites Charles Grant, Jermyn, Lascelles, Liddell, Loch and Warrender. The core of reasonably active Whigs therefore numbered about 111, with a further 50 or so in the wings. A total of 215 Members voted on the ministerial side in at least one of the three divisions considered here. Of these, three dozen held office, including Huskisson, Palmerston, Frankland Lewis and Lamb, who were in the majority on 24 Apr. Huskisson and Lewis also divided with ministers on the ordnance estimates, 4 July, as did their associates Denison, Robert Grant, Sandon and Wilmot Horton. Members who cast only pro-government votes totalled 174 (26 per cent of the House) and included 33 office-holders. Sixty-two Members cast mixed votes in this session. Among them were the Huskissonites Barrett Lennard, Denison, Robert Grant, Huskisson, Lewis, Littleton, Palmerston, Sandon, Stuart Wortley and Wilmot Horton. Most were Tories who gave only one or two wayward votes. Those who divided more than twice against the government were the anti-Catholics Attwood, Henry Bankes, Henry Bright, Fyler and William Rickford; the Whigs William Denison, Benjamin Lester, Lord William Powlett, George Richard Robinson, Sir John Sebright and Edmond Wodehouse; and the independents Gurney and Charles Williams Wynn. The potential fissure in the ranks of general supporters of the ministry became apparent in the division on Russell’s motion for repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, 26 Feb., which was carried by 237-193. There are indications that the government whips did not exert themselves unduly to secure an attendance to oppose the proposal, and 35 Members who later in the session showed themselves to be supporters of the ministry voted in the majority with the Whigs and radicals. On 12 May 1828 Burdett’s motion to consider Catholic relief was successful by 272-266; the majority contained about 67 Tories who normally supported the government. Thus the Wellington ministry had great potential numerical support in normal circumstances, but there were serious weaknesses in its position.\n\nIn July 1828 the Whigs Sir James Graham and Smith Stanley hankered after the formation of ‘a party in the House of Commons upon some broad and intelligible principle, without any reference to leaders in the House of Lords or without any direct compact with’ the unpredictable Brougham. Nothing came of this, or of an attempt by Edward Davies Davenport and Poulett Thomson to mould the 52 Members who were ‘good for anything’ into the kernel of an active opposition group or club, who would try to ‘reform the abuses and economize the revenues’ by acting together in the House. However, the mounting crisis in Ireland precipitated by the return of the Catholic champion Daniel O’Connell over the minister William Vesey Fitzgerald in the county Clare by-election of July, the awesome implications of which were not lost on Wellington and Peel, encouraged a move towards Whig unity on the increasingly urgent Catholic question. From Italy in November 1828, Macdonald wrote to a fellow Whig:\n\nEngland is fast sinking in the scale of nations under the administration of the duke … His conduct in permitting the British empire to be distracted … and verging towards a civil war, from a base fear of the basest of factions, the English Tory aristocracy, must damn him to all posterity. A liberal party surely must be formed, I care not under whom, to prevent … (and it must be a bold-spirited, uncompromising party) … our further degradation abroad, and our dissolution at home.\n\nThe leading Whigs corresponded and talked as the year turned and reached an agreement in principle to ‘fight the Catholic question resolutely as a party’, as Lansdowne put it. There were, however, disagreements over tactics, and it remained unclear who would take the lead. While Althorp shrugged aside suggestions that he should do so, he was clear that if ministers proposed a settlement of the Catholic question, ‘I would not annoy them on any other’, but that if they did not ‘I would annoy them … [and] … attack them on every subject I could lay hold of and … make every effort in my power to turn them out’. John Denison, anxious to ascertain if there was any chance of concert between the Huskissonites and the Whigs, particularly on the Catholic question, consulted Smith Stanley, who thought it unlikely, despite the fact that ‘we are in the main thoroughly agreed’. Denison conceded that an effective junction would ‘require time and management’, especially among the embittered old hands, but argued that if the government remained inert on Catholic relief it would be ‘enough for opposition to agree in disapproving’, which would lead perhaps to the formation of an effective combined opposition.\n\nThe government’s pragmatic concession of Catholic emancipation in February 1829 took the wind out of the Whigs’ sails. It also made the party situation in the Commons even more fluid and unpredictable than it had been since April 1827 and had consequences which ultimately helped to wreck the administration. In his early February calculations of the probable attitude of all current Members, Joseph Planta, the bungling patronage secretary to the treasury, calculated that on routine issues the government could draw on a theoretical maximum support of about 414, while the ‘regular opposition’ and their fringe sympathizers numbered about 219 at most. His assessment, especially in describing the likes of Tierney and James Scarlett as ‘doubtful’ on the Catholic question, was probably complicated by the importance which ministers initially attached to the proposed ‘securities’ to safeguard the Protestant establishment, particularly the planned disfranchisement of 40s. freeholders in the Irish counties, and uncertainty as to whether the Whigs would accept them to guarantee emancipation. (In the event, the Whig leaders decided not to oppose the disfranchisement, and only 11 of the party, including Duncannon, did so in the divisions of 19 and 20 Mar.) Planta concluded that 295 Members, supporters of or favourably disposed towards the government, would vote for emancipation (he actually listed only 294), while 119 were ‘opposed to the principle’ (he listed 115 names in fact, plus three prospective anti-Catholic Members, one for Newark and two for Truro). In the event, no fewer than 197 Members cast at least one vote against emancipation in the six divisions (6-30 Mar.) for which lists have been found. Of these, 69 had been listed by Planta as likely to be ‘with government’. Of the 165 Tories who recorded at least three hostile votes, Planta had reckoned on the support of 46; while the diehard core of 128 opponents of emancipation contained 24 such Members. On the other hand, the government carried with them 73 Members who had voted against Catholic relief in 1827 and/or 1828. While the bulk of the 197 Tory opponents of emancipation were not permanently alienated from the ministry, a significant number, probably as many as 40, with perhaps 30 occasional fellow travellers, were so incensed at what they considered an act of betrayal by Wellington and Peel that they eventually formed a party of opposition, known as the Ultras, under the Commons leadership of Vyvyan and Sir Edward Knatchbull. In mid-April 1829 Wellington’s confidant Charles Arbuthnot, the first commissioner of woods and forests, having gathered from Lady Tankerville that Grey was ‘anxious for some of his friends’ to join the ministry, talked with Duncannon, who told him that ‘there were many persons in the … Lords and Commons who, if the Grey party became connected with the government, would join’. Arbuthnot explained to Peel that he had been\n\nanxious to prevent Lord Grey’s party from rejoining the Whigs because it would make a most formidable opposition in case any of our old friends should continue to stand aloof, because Lord Grey and his friends behaved well towards us when we went out, because … the taking of one or two of them would be sufficient to effect our object and … because I feel strongly that the violent and bitter Tories would be kept better in order if it were made evident that we had not to depend solely upon them.\n\nWellington did take in the Whigs Lord Rosslyn (with Grey’s lukewarm consent) in May and Scarlett (as attorney-general) in June 1829, as part of his policy of picking off individual oppositionists as opportunities offered.\n\nThe following analysis of opposition voting patterns in the Commons after the passage of Catholic emancipation is based on 11 minority division lists, 1 May-5 June 1829. They include two on the East Retford question, 5 May (after which Palmerston commented, prematurely, that ‘parties are returning to their ancient demarcations’) and 2 June; one on the Ultra Lord Blandford’s parliamentary reform scheme, 2 June, and two which attracted the support largely of disaffected or independent Tories, namely those on the silk trade bill, 1 May (minority of 22) and against the Maynooth grant, 22 May (minority of 14). No lists of ministerial voters have been found. A total of 239 Members (36 per cent of the House) cast at least one hostile vote in these divisions, but the largest minorities were those of 116 for allowing O’Connell to take his seat without swearing the oath of supremacy, 18 May, and of 111 for a proposal to transfer East Retford’s seats to Birmingham, 5 May. Only 69 Members gave three or more votes: of these, 59 were Whigs and radicals; three (Denison, Palmerston and Stuart Wortley) were Huskissonites; and four (Bright, Thomas Bucknall Estcourt, Rickford and Charles Waldo Sibthorp) had opposed Catholic emancipation. Frederick Gough Calthorpe and the Williams Wynns could be considered as independents with a strong leaning to opposition. Forty-eight of the 170 Members casting only one or two hostile votes were Whigs who voted in support of O’Connell, 18 May. Two anti-Catholic Tories, William Trant and Lord Uxbridge, did likewise. The occasional opponents of the ministry included also the Huskissonites Ellis, Fitzgerald, the Grant brothers, Jermyn, Liddell, Littleton, Sandon, Sturges Bourne and Hyde Villiers. The Members who divided against the Maynooth grant were Sir Charles Abney Hastings, Sir John Astley, Edmund Bastard, Buck, Bucknall Estcourt, Arthur Henry Cole, Robert Bransby Cooper, Cressett Pelham, Sir William Heathcote, Lord Mandeville, Henry Maxwell, George Moore, Rickford, George Spence and Waldo Sibthorp. At the end of the session Graham perceived that ‘the duke’s position is critical’, but that it was ‘not the confusion of a beaten army, without a leader and without a plan’.\n\nIn the autumn of 1829 Vyvyan, who harboured fanciful hopes of replacing the Wellington ministry with a coalition administration dominated by the Ultras, calculated that the Commons contained 35 ‘Tories strongly opposed’ to the duke’s ministry: Astley, Attwood, Edmund and John Bastard, Matthew Bell, Blandford, William Dickinson, William Duncombe, Lord Encombe, Richard Fountayne Wilson, Fyler, Clinton Fynes Clinton, Sir William Heathcote, Arthur Holdsworth, Sir Robert Inglis, Henry King, Knatchbull, Henry Maxwell, Nathaniel Peach, William Peachey, Rickford, Gustavus Rochfort, Sir George and George Pitt Rose, Michael Sadler, Sotheron, Trant, Lord Tullamore, Vyvyan, Waldo Sibthorp, George Watson Taylor, John Wells, Wetherell, Henry Willoughby and James Wilson. He believed, too, that there were many potential recruits among the large number of Members whose views on a putative coalition were unknown to him. He even tried in early October to seduce Palmerston ‘from the Huskisson party’, as a potential cabinet minister and ‘competent leader in the House of Commons’. When Planta made a conciliatory visit to Knatchbull the previous month he had found him somewhat embittered by the concession of emancipation, but harbouring ‘a most established hatred for the Whigs’ and seemingly inclined to respond to ministerial overtures. The Ultras’ hopes of a change of ministry soon evaporated, but the desire of Vyvyan and others to act as a party of opposition (albeit one internally divided on some issues, notably parliamentary reform) remained strong. Yet neither they nor the still leaderless and divided Whigs (Mackintosh characteristically referred in December 1829 to the ‘strong divergences of inclination among them’) made any serious attempt to prepare themselves for co-ordinated action in the forthcoming session. Indeed, a number of Whig peers, notably the duke of Bedford, the marquess of Cleveland, the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Albemarle and Earl Grosvenor, indicated their intention to give at least general support to the ministry, and a handful of Whig Members did likewise. Tavistock, for one, was ‘for the duke, with his wings clipped, because I see nothing better to look to, but I should like to weed the stable, and to see some better cattle put into it’. Speculation inevitably flourished. In November 1829 Arbuthnot surmised that ‘when Parliament meets we shall have a powerful combination of Ultra Tories, Canningites and Whigs against us’, but he expected the government to survive. Inglis, on the other hand, thought ‘the duke cannot stand with the present ministry against the present opposition, a Cerberus of the old Tories, the old Whigs and the Huskissons’. The Huskissonite Sturges Bourne believed that ‘the government will have a large body of steady and zealous friends, and a yet smaller body of organized and combined opponents, and in that will consist its strength, if strength it can be called’. In January 1830 the Whig Spring Rice concluded that ‘if my dissection of the House of Commons is just, it would appear that the relative strength of the government is increased, and that the absolute strength of all other parties is considerably diminished since the adjournment’, and that Wellington would continue to ‘endeavour so as to poise the political balance as to make it incline either way at his will’ while trying ‘in various ways to conciliate and to soften opposition’. Another Whig Member, Robert Slaney, reckoned that ‘parties are oddly divided, ministers about 120, Whigs about 90, Ultra Tories inveterate against government now 30. Huskisson and … [his friends] also now strong in opposition, about 15, and the plot thickens as others come to town’. The Whig organizer Edward Ellice informed Grey:\n\nThere appear to be four distinct parties preparing for Parliament. First, government. Second, a direct and entire opposition led by Lord Palmerston … with Charles Grant and the ex-liberals, etc. … [with] a large support from our friends, who have only made the condition that Huskisson is not to lead … and on this point they willingly give up their leader Lord Lansdowne. The third party are what they call the Watchers, under … Althorp … and to this I fear Brougham proposes to attach himself. The fourth, the discontented and still more bitter old Tories, who will make no peace with Peel and are probably the most formidable, backed as they are by the distress and loud complaints from every part of the country.\n\nThe potential vulnerability of the government (which Wellington had tried to strengthen further by making James Abercromby chief baron of the Scottish exchequer court and recruiting to junior office the Huskissonites Frankland Lewis and Stuart Wortley) was revealed on the address, 4 Feb. 1830, when Knatchbull’s amendment deploring the reference in the king’s speech to distress as local and calling for general measures of relief was defeated by 158-105, with the aid of the votes of about two dozen Whigs and radicals: Charles Barclay, Sir Francis Blake, Thomas Fowell Buxton, Sheldon Cradock, Lord Patrick Crichton Stuart, Alexander Dawson, John Easthope, Maurice Fitzgerald, Hobhouse, Lords Hotham and Howick, Hume, John Savile Lumley, William Marshall, Monck, Sir Henry Parnell, George Philips, Edward Protheroe, Charles Rumbold, Paulet St. John Mildmay, William Smith, Sir Michael Shaw Stewart, Taylor, Warburton, William Wolryche Whitmore and Edward Wynne Pendarves. Littleton reported that ‘there is no certainty for … [ministers] on any point. Party being dissolved, they do not know their opponents. Neither do they know their friends … [and] questions will continually arise incidentally in debates, on which they will find themselves basketted’. The junior minister Lord Castlereagh observed that the House was ‘in a strange state’, and the Whig Charles Wood informed his father of the ‘altered loose state’ of ‘all politics’. On 16 Feb. Arbuthnot wrote to Peel:\n\nI know the looks of the House of Commons. The Ultra Tories will never … give us votes … The Canning party will only support us when they feel they have been previously committed to our line of conduct. The Whigs are behaving most shabbily … With compliments in their mouths they will try to destroy us because they see they are not to be taken in as a body. Our own friends have many of them committed themselves against us upon the subject of some of the taxes; and if we are obdurate I firmly believe that with three hostile parties we should have behind us nearly empty benches.\n\nThe Huskissonites had decided by this time to adopt ‘not a position of opposition but of observation’, so that, as Denison put it, they could ‘obtain a recognized character of independence and fairness in the House’. In practice, they became increasingly hostile to the government.\n\nFor all this, government musters did improve significantly during the first few weeks of the session, but a move towards greater cohesion by the Whigs exposed them to the threat of a powerful combined attack from early March. According to Fortescue, a ‘notion among us Whigs of organizing ourselves into a party, to act under the joint leadership of Althorp and Brougham’, had foundered; but on 3 Mar. 1830, at the instigation of the influential county Members Edward Portman (Dorset), Francis Lawley (Warwickshire) and Wynne Pendarves (Cornwall), there was a meeting at Althorp’s Albany rooms of 27 Members, who included Russell, Howick and Warburton. They were seeking to ‘form a party under the guidance of Lord Althorp with a view to take off some of the most oppressive taxes’. ‘Very little’ was achieved, because most of those present would not accept the property tax that Althorp favoured. Yet he agreed to become leader for the purpose of promoting tax reductions if at least 45 Members attended a meeting fixed for 6 Mar. In the interim he obtained the blessing of Brougham, Graham and Russell. Over 60 Members turned up on the 6th, when, as Howick recorded, there was again much disagreement, but it was decided ‘not to attempt any union with any other party and to endeavour as far as possible to promote every measure of economy’. Althorp confirmed this to Grey, noting that ‘on all other points we are to continue as much disunited as ever’. In the House on 8 Mar. he stated that ‘a union had been formed’ to campaign for ‘economy and reduction of taxes’, but stressed that those involved had no wish to turn out ministers. After an uncertain start, this initiative gained momentum as the session progressed and ministerial competence came more under question. Further meetings took place, Grey began to assert himself once more, and the active core of Whig oppositionists grew in size and commitment. In late June 1830 Lord Normanby told the duke of Devonshire that a recent opposition dinner at Brooks’s, attended by ‘all that is most venerable and revered in Whiggism’, had done ‘good and looked more like a revival of party than anything that has happened for some time’.\n\nThe potential threat to the government was revealed on 26 Mar. 1830, when a Whig amendment to abolish the sinecure pensions of the sons of the cabinet ministers Lords Bathurst and Melville was carried by 139-121. They were also beaten by 115-97 on the Huskissonite Robert Grant’s motion for leave to introduce a Jewish emancipation bill, 5 Apr., but got up numbers to kill the measure by 63 votes on 17 May. Mackintosh’s motion to abolish the death penalty for most forgery offences was carried against the ministry by 13 votes, 7 June. As the Whig opposition increased in strength and unity in May and June, the government, whose weakness in debate, where Peel and Goulburn received little useful support from their official colleagues, did not help matters, saw its majorities on a range of routine issues diminish alarmingly. The 300 muster which Billy Holmes, the beleaguered whip, assured the cabinet minister Lord Ellenborough he could get ‘on any great question’ was a theoretical rather than realistic figure; and Goulburn told Peel during his absence from the House on account of his father’s death that ‘the state of the king’s health and the prospect of an early dissolution’ were encouraging ‘the country gentlemen who usually support us’ to curry favour with constituents by questioning or opposing government expenditure.\n\nExcluding those on Jewish emancipation, six divisions have yielded lists of ministerial voters: the majorities against the transfer of East Retford’s seats to Birmingham, 11 Feb. (126), Blandford’s reform plan, 18 Feb. (160) and Russell’s motion for the enfranchisement of Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, 23 Feb. (188); for the grant for South American missions, 7 June (118), and in defence of the judges’ salaries proposed in the administration of justice bill, 7 July (37); and the minority against abolition of the death penalty for forgery, 7 June (138). A total of 338 Members (51 per cent of the House) voted in at least one of these divisions. Of these, 120 Tories had opposed Catholic emancipation, including 24 of those listed as Ultras by Vyvyan in October 1829. Seventy-seven of the opponents of emancipation who were still in the House did not vote with ministers in any of these divisions. Only 162 Members, of whom at least 37 were official men, cast exclusively ministerial votes: they included 46 who had opposed emancipation, among them two of Vyvyan’s Ultras (Fountayne Wilson and Sotheron) and four office-holders (George Bankes, Sir John Beckett, Sir Alexander Hope and Lord Lowther) who had voted against emancipation. The number of Members who voted with the government in at least three of the six divisions, some of whom also cast isolated hostile votes, was 131; a quarter were office-holders. Forty-four had opposed emancipation, including six of Vyvyan’s Ultras: Astley, the Bastards, Peachey, Sotheron and James Wilson. Analysis of the opposition to the ministry in this session is based on lists from 67 divisions. Of the Ultras identified by Vyvyan, 17 were in regular opposition: Attwood, Bell, Blandford, Dickinson, Duncombe, Encombe, Fyler, Heathcote, Inglis, Knatchbull, Rickford, Sadler, Trant, Vyvyan, Wetherell, Wells and Waldo Sibthorp. Of these, Bell, Duncombe, Encombe, Heathcote, Inglis, Knatchbull, Rickford, Sadler, Vyvyan, Wetherell and Waldo Sibthorp voted with government on at least one occasion. Fynes Clinton cast four hostile votes and Sir George Rose one. Quintin Dick, though not classified as an Ultra by Vyvyan, had voted against emancipation and divided ten times against the government. Eleven Ultras gave mixed votes but did not oppose ministers on a regular basis: Astley, the Bastards, King, Maxwell, Peach, Peachey, Rochfort, George Pitt Rose, Willoughby and Wilson. As previously noted, Fountayne Wilson (one vote) and Sotheron (four) divided only with the government. Holdsworth, Tullamore and Watson Taylor did not vote in any of the divisions under consideration. Of the surviving Huskissonites, nine were in regular opposition: Denison, the Grants, Huskisson, Littleton, Palmerston, Sandon, Vernon Smith and Warrender. All except Huskisson appeared on the government side in at least one division. Augustus Ellis cast two hostile votes. Sturges Bourne and Villiers gave mixed votes, but did not oppose regularly. Fitzgerald is not known to have voted in any of these divisions. A total of 169 active Whig and radical oppositionists have been identified. Of these, 21 voted against Knatchbull’s amendment to the address. Four (Sir William Amcotts Ingilby, Montague Cholmeley, Osborne and George Richard Robinson) divided with government on the East Retford question, 11 Feb.; ten (William Bingham Baring, William Ewart, Sir James Graham, Kekewich, James Langston, Nicholas Ridley Colborne, Sefton, Slaney, Shaw Stewart and William Whitmore) against Blandford’s reform scheme, 18 Feb.; two (Portman and John Stewart) against the enfranchisement of Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, 23 Feb.; one (Lumley) for the South American missions grant, 7 June; nine (James Barlow Hoy, Peter Ducane, Henry Howard, Langston, Osborne, Parnell, Shaw Stewart, John Tomes and Henry White) against abolition of the death penalty for forgery the same day; and four (French, Joseph Phillimore, Robinson and Shaw Stewart) against a reduction of judges’ salaries, 7 July—a total of 26 individuals. Forty-eight Members cast only opposition and no government votes (except on the address), but did so in six or fewer of the 67 divisions. They were a motley bunch, but about a dozen were Whigs. Apart from the Ultras, Huskissonites, Whigs and radicals already noticed, a total of 107 Members cast mixed votes, including 49 who had opposed Catholic emancipation. Eighty-six recorded four or fewer hostile votes (48 opposed only the contentious sale of beer bill towards the end of the session); 39 had opposed emancipation. Nineteen mixed voters cast so many opposition votes as to make them unreliable as far as the government was concerned or at best independent: Acland, Henry Bankes (anti-Catholic), Charles and David Barclay, Lord Belgrave, Bright (anti-Catholic), Nicolson Calvert, Corbett, Sheldon Cradock, Cuthbert Ellison, John Fane (anti-Catholic), Richard Fitzgibbon, Charles Harrison Batley (anti-Catholic), Joseph Marryat, George Norton, Robert Palmer, Powlett and the Williams Wynns. In the two divisions on Jewish emancipation, 242 Members opposed it: they included 27 Ultras and 89 other Tory opponents of emancipation. Thirteen of those who voted with the government on this issue cast no other recorded votes in 1830. Four Whigs opposed Jewish emancipation: Osborne, Sefton, Lord Charles Townshend and Edward Webb. At the close of the 1826 Parliament, therefore, it appears that the ministry had the potential support of about 293 Members, while Whigs, radicals, Ultras and Huskissonites might theoretically muster a combined total of about 210. The disposition of some 141 other Members who cast recorded votes in the 1830 session was less obvious, but perhaps 86 of them were inclined to government, while 55 were not to be counted upon or were hostile. This was not a healthy position for the government. The independent Whig Sir Robert Heron, summing up ‘a most extraordinary session’, wrote:\n\nMinisters have no secure majority, for whenever the old opposition and the Ultras can agree on any subject, they must be left in a minority. The duke of Wellington has certainly done more for the country than any former minister, but it is not enough to meet the necessities of the times; the country begins to be tired of his despotism … The gratitude the old opposition has felt for the carrying the Catholic bill has more than once saved the administration; but this is fast wearing out, and their only safeguard now is the fear of their successors.\n\nThe 1830 Parliament\n\nThe general election necessitated by the death of George IV did not clarify the political situation. The ministry emerged from it with no more reliable Commons adherents than before and with its prestige and authority seriously damaged by embarrassing defeats and poor returns in open constituencies, the failure of its attempt to turn out leading Huskissonites and a widespread revolt against aristocratic control in the counties by lesser gentry and small farmers. The demand for parliamentary reform was voiced in many constituencies, obliging numerous candidates to pledge themselves to support it, with varying degrees of sincerity. Although the electoral impact of news of the French revolution was minimal, it had some effect subsequently, while the Brussels uprising at the end of August, autumn unrest and strikes in industrial Lancashire, where the trade union movement had gained strength, and the outbreak of rural ‘Swing’ disorder from the end of October enhanced the view of many of the governing class that it would be more dangerous to resist than to concede a measure of reform. There was much speculation about numbers, but, as Lord Duncannon observed to Henry Brougham, ‘the great thing against’ ministers ‘more than the actual return, is the spirit that has shown itself both in England and Ireland’. It was clear, as Brougham eagerly pointed out in his anonymously published pamphlet, The Result of the General Election; or What Has the Duke of Wellington gained by the Dissolution? (in which he claimed to have seen the latest treasury calculations), that the government had made few if any net gains and had fared particularly badly in the open constituencies. He reckoned on 28 ‘steady ministerialists’, 47 ‘avowed adherents of opposition’ and seven ‘of a neutral cast’ among the 82 English county Members; three ‘ministerialists’ and 24 ‘opposition’ returned by 13 ‘great popular cities and boroughs’; and 47 ‘ministerialists, 71 ‘opposition’ and eight ‘rather more against government than for it’ elected for 62 ‘more or less open places’. Thus of 236 (in fact 235) Members ‘returned by more or less popular elections’, there were 79 (in fact 78) supporters of government, 141 (142) in ‘avowed opposition’ and 16 (15) ‘of a neutral cast’ (p. 18). John Croker, secretary to the admiralty, considered the outcome of the election to be ‘very bad’ for the ministry and told his colleague Lord Lowther that while this was ‘not the light in which the treasury views the returns … I see in them the seeds of the most troublesome and unmanageable Parliament since that which overturned the monarchy and beheaded the monarch’. With most of the returns in, Joseph Planta reckoned on a ministerial gain of 21 or 22, optimistically making the composition of the House 368 government and 234 opposition. In mid-September he and Charles Ross, recently appointed a lord of the admiralty, went over the list of ‘our new House of Commons’, and on the 21st Planta sent them to the leader of the House Peel, who was expecting a visit from the premier. Planta advised that Billy Holmes ‘may run through the lists’ and surmised that ‘with his approval or alteration, they will no doubt be very tolerably correct’. (Holmes ‘admitted’ when Parliament assembled that there were ‘about an hundred names he knew nothing at all about’.) The analysis of the 177 new Members and 481 Members of the previous Parliament was as follows: 311 ‘friends’; 37 ‘moderate Ultras’; 37 ‘good doubtfuls’; 24 ‘doubtful doubtfuls’; 23 ‘bad doubtfuls’; 25 ‘violent Ultras’; 188 ‘foes’, and 11 ‘the Huskisson Party’. The total of 656 was two short of the House’s Membership: the deaths of John Rawlinson Harris, the new Member for Southwark, 27 Aug., and of Huskisson (at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester railway, 15 Sept.) account for this. Masterton Ure, Member for Weymouth, does not appear on the list, but it was presumably he who was entered among the ‘friends’ of government as ‘Mr. Vere’. There are actually 312 names under ‘friends’, including the mysterious ‘Hon. J. Arbuthnot, M.P. for Kinross’. This county did not return a Member in 1830, so he must be disregarded. Holmes is included twice, on the second occasion with the comment ‘or another friend’. He had been returned for both Haslemere and Queenborough and he did not vacate the latter until he was unseated on petition on 2 Dec. 1830. Therefore the actual number of ‘friends’ was 310, including Speaker Manners Sutton. Of these, the pencilled annotation ‘Q[uer]y’ was subsequently marked against the names of 21: Sir John Astley, Cadwallader Blayney, John Campbell, John Capel, William Douglas, Edward Thomas Foley, Lord Forbes, Charles Griffith Wynne, Henry Hepburne Scott, Lord Holmesdale, James Hope Vere, John McClintock, Lords Norreys and Oxmantown, Matthew Pennefather, Frederick Shaw, Stephen Lyne Stephens, Sir Hugh Stewart, Sir John Tyrell, Ure and Frederick West. In addition, Planta had written ‘crotchet’ against Lord Acheson and Sir James Carnegie, and ‘do not know’ beside James Ewing (Wareham) and John Lee Lee (Wells). He endorsed the 37 ‘moderate Ultras’ with the comment, ‘9 of which I should call friends’. In fact 12 were marked ‘friend’: John Jacob Buxton, Lord Ingestre, ‘Tobias’ [Theobald] Jones, Sir John Dashwood King, Thomas Legh, Philip John and ‘P. H.’ [William] Miles, Thomas Assheton Smith, George Holme Sumner, Sir Robert Williames Vaughan, ‘Capt.’ [James] Wemyss and Henry Willoughby. The word ‘friend’ against the last two was subsequently scored out. Sir Lawrence Palk and Sir John Pollen were each labelled ‘a sincere friend’; and against Lord John George Lennox was written ‘always votes with us’. It was noted that William Ormsby Gore ‘has applied for patronage’ and that Sir Edward Kerrison ‘asks for patronage’. Seven of the ‘moderate Ultras’ appeared on the analysis of Irish Members (which showed 74 supporters of the government, nine opponents and 17 neutrals) drawn up by Pierce Mahony in late August. Sir Robert Bateson, Richard Handcock, Gustavus Rochfort and Evelyn John Shirley were listed as ‘government’, but Planta endorsed Rochfort’s entry with the comment, ‘asks for patronage. Don’t give it’. Anthony and ‘Serjeant’ [Thomas] Lefroy and Lord Tullamore were classed as ‘neutral’ by Mahony. Planta observed of Thomas Lefroy that he had ‘said he was not opposed to govt. Will oppose’; and he described Tullamore as an ‘enemy’. He endorsed the list of ‘good doubtfuls’ with the observation, ‘Doubtful favourables 37, of which I make 18 to be generally friends’. In fact 19 Members were so listed, but the names of John Fardell and James Adam Gordon were given a pencilled endorsement of ‘qu[ery] D[oubtful]’. Of the other 18, Michael Bruce ‘states himself a friend’; John Loch was ‘a friend except on parly. reform’; ‘G.’ [John] Phillpotts, it was thought, ‘surely … will be a friend’; Francis Aldborough Prittie was ‘a friend’ who ‘asks for patronage’; and George Schonswar, Abel, George and Samuel Smith, Sir George Staunton, Henry Villiers Stuart, Lord Patrick Crichton Stuart, Sir Michael Shaw Stewart and Lord Surrey were noted as ‘friends where not pledged’. Sir Richard Bulkeley Philipps was designated an ‘enemy’. John Boyle and Prittie had been classed as ‘government’ by Mahony. Planta endorsed the list of ‘doubtful doubtfuls’ with the comment, ‘Very doubtful 24, among which I reckon 3 if not 4 friends’. These were Joseph Marryat ( ‘surely a friend’), Edward Tunno and Charles Kemeys Tynte (both ‘a friend’), and James Loch, who ‘should be a favourable doubtful at least’. Sir Charles and John Forbes were described as being ‘more yes than no’; John Fane and Lord Killeen were both designated ‘enemy’; and Lord Belgrave was queried. The list of ‘bad doubtfuls’ was endorsed, ‘Doubtfuls unfavourable, 23, of which I have put a q[uer]y to 4’. In fact only Ralph Howard and Lord Jermyn were so marked, while of Charles Buller it was written, ‘he should support us according to what he said to me’. Richard Fitzgibbon (classed as ‘government’ in the Irish list) ‘should support us, but will oppose’. Matthias Attwood was endorsed ‘violent Ultra’, while ‘opposition’ was written against ‘T.’ [William] Evans, Lord Fordwich, Sir Robert Alexander Ferguson and ‘Col.’ [Standish] O’Grady (both ‘government’ on the Irish list), Charles Rumbold, and Charles and Sir Watkin Williams Wynn. Of the 25 ‘violent Ultras’, three, Mervyn Archdall, Henry Maxwell and ‘Gen.’ [John Bruce Richard] O’Neill had been marked ‘government’ by Mahony and Henry King as ‘neutral’. There were 186, not 188 names on the list of ‘foes’, the discrepancy being explained by the returns of Brougham for both Yorkshire and Knaresborough and of Lord Ebrington for both Devon and Tavistock. They were respectively replaced in their borough seats by the sound Whigs Lord Waterpark (on 2 Dec.) and Lord John Russell (on 27 Nov. 1830). A few pencilled comments were made on this list. Of Lord Brabazon, it was noted that ‘I hear from Ireland he is to be sweetened’, and of Nicolson Calvert that he ‘will not be uniformly opposed’. ‘Q[uer]y’ was placed against Robert Grosvenor and John Abel Smith, while Hudson Gurney was considered ‘doubtful’. Mahony had listed nine of these ‘foes’ as ‘contras’ (Duncannon, James Grattan, Charles Jephson, George Lamb, James Lambert, Sir John Newport, Daniel O’Connell, George Ponsonby and Thomas Spring Rice) and 17 as ‘neutrals’. The ‘Huskisson Party’, deprived now of their leader, were Augustus Ellis, John Fitzgerald, Charles and Robert Grant, Edward Littleton, Lord Palmerston, Granville Ryder, Lord Sandon, Robert Vernon Smith, William Sturges Bourne and Sir George Warrender. Therefore on Planta’s basic figures, the ministry, with only 310 ‘friends’, was technically a minority one. On the assumption that 188 ‘foes’ (including Lord John Russell and Waterpark), 11 Huskissonites and 26 ‘violent Ultras’ (the listed 25 plus Attwood) would be hostile, the House could be reckoned at 310-225 for government, with 121 uncertain. Giving the ministry the 37 ‘good doubtfuls’ and opposition the rest made the reckoning 347-309, an uncomfortably small margin. Taking into consideration the various refinements to the lists, 25 queried, crotchety and unknown Members might be deducted from the 310 ‘friends’, leaving 285. To these might be added nine ‘moderate Ultras’, 18 ‘good doubtfuls and three ‘doubtful doubtfuls’ who were considered to be basically friendly, giving a revised ministerial strength of 315. Removal of the five queried ‘foes’ would reduce them to 183, and adding 11 Huskissonites and 26 ‘violent Ultras’ would give certain opponents of the government a total of 220. Allocating 18 ‘good doubtfuls’ to government and 28 ‘moderate Ultras’, 20 ‘doubtful doubtfuls’ and 23 ‘bad doubtfuls’ to opposition would produce a crude revised division of the House into 333 for government and 291 for opposition, a majority of only 42. Of the 82 English county Members, 27 were listed as ‘friends’, with three, Astley, Norreys and Tyrell of Essex, queried; two as ‘good doubtfuls’, with Powlett reckoned ‘a friend’; five as ‘doubtful doubtfuls’, with Fane noted as an ‘enemy’; three as ‘moderate Ultras; four as ‘violent Ultras’; one (Littleton) as ‘Huskisson party’, and 40 as ‘foes’, with Nicolson Calvert qualified as ‘not uniformly opposed’. Allowing for these reservations, Planta evidently reckoned on 25 reliable ‘friends’ and 40 certain ‘foes’, with 17 doubtful; but in the short term this turned out to be optimistic. Of the 140 surviving Members who had been returned to Parliament for the first time, Planta classed 71 as ‘friends’, 30 as ‘foes’, 13 as ‘good doubtfuls’, eight as ‘doubtful doubtfuls’, three as ‘bad doubtfuls’, nine as ‘moderate Ultras’ five as ‘violent Ultras’ and one (Granville Ryder) as ‘Huskisson party’. Of Members returned for the 44 largest boroughs, he calculated that 27 would be sure ‘friends’, 46 certain ‘foes’ and 12 doubtful. This was very close to Brougham’s calculation, which suggests that he had indeed seen the treasury list. Again, it proved to be optimistic, as far as Planta was concerned.\n\nThe death of Huskisson was followed by approaches to his followers by both Lord Grey, as leader of the revived Whig opposition, and the duke of Wellington. Palmerston and Lord Melbourne (as William Lamb now was) responded encouragingly to Grey’s feeler, but Wellington’s attempt to recruit Palmerston, with Lord Clive acting as intermediary, dragged on for five weeks and ended in failure. The Whigs attempted in late October to co-ordinate their strategy for the forthcoming session, but with Russell temporarily out of the House following his defeat at Bedford and the impetuous Brougham, flushed with his success in Yorkshire, claiming the lead on reform, it was not straightforward. However, Wellington made their task much easier with his declaration in the Lords, 2 Nov. 1830, against any measure of parliamentary reform. Whatever his motives, the effect was to convince many moderate men that his government was moribund and that reform was almost inevitable. John Stuart Wortley, a junior member of the government, confided to the cabinet minister Lord Ellenborough his belief that the duke’s declaration had done for them, as it had ‘made it impossible for any to join them, and upon the question of reform it is doubtful if we should have numbers enough’. Wellington’s statement brought the Whigs and the Huskissonites into partnership on the issue, albeit with reservations on the part of the latter. It was fixed that Brougham would bring on a motion to consider ‘the state of the representation of the people in Parliament, with a view to remedy such defects as may appear therein’. The decision of Wellington and Peel to cancel the king’s planned visit to the City to dine with his ministers and the new lord mayor, after receiving intelligence that the duke was likely to be attacked, added to the sense of crisis and ministerial paralysis. Durham reported to his wife:\n\nThe universal opinion is that they must go out. The duke is execrated by the mob … most unpopular with the monied men in the City … and almost abandoned by his own party, who openly say (even his subalterns, Ashley, Wortley, etc.) that he ought to give it up, and make way for Lord Grey.\n\nAfter discussion, the cabinet decided to resist Brougham’s motion with a direct negative. The Huskissonite Sandon told his father Lord Harrowby, 12 Nov., of the ‘altered feeling with respect to’ parliamentary reform:\n\nIt is no longer the cry of the turbulent and disaffected. The most sober and peaceable classes are now sharing fully in anxiety for something of the kind … Those who have had much intercourse with their constituents are quite astounded at the change … Granville [Ryder, his brother] and I are both much embarrassed. Perhaps he is rather more of a reformer than I am, but more anxious than I am that the carrying of the question should not be the destruction of the ministry. I believe we shall vote for … [reform], though reluctantly, but thinking the current is too strong to be permanently resisted, and that early concession is better and more effective than late.\n\nOn 11 Nov. 1830 the House divided 150-24 against Daniel O’Connell’s motion for repeal of the Irish Subletting Act. The minority was composed of 19 Irish Members, plus Sir Henry Bunbury, Thomas Denman, Joseph Hume and Lord Francis Osborne, all listed as ‘foes’ by Planta; Philip Howard ( ‘bad doubtfuls’); and John Hodgson and James Johnston ( ‘good doubtfuls’). Of the Irish contingent, only four (James Grattan, Jephson, Lambert and O’Connell) had been reckoned hostile by Mahony (all deemed to be ‘foes’ by Planta), while seven had been listed as ‘neutrals’ (Lord Brabazon, Alexander Dawson, Lord Killeen, William Macnamara, the O’Conor Don, Richard O’Ferrall and Thomas Wyse).

Thirty of these were Planta’s ‘foes’. The remainder consisted of the Huskissonites Charles Grant, Palmerston and Smith; William Evans and Charles Williams Wynn of the ‘bad doubtfuls’ (both endorsed ‘opposition’); two ‘doubtful doubtfuls’ (Killeen and Marryat, who had been reckoned ‘surely a friend’); John Weyland of the ‘good doubtfuls; Neil Malcolm of the ‘moderate Ultras’, and two ‘friends’, Montague Chapman and William Douglas.\n\nBrougham’s reform motion never came before the House, for on 15 Nov. 1830 Parnell moved for inquiry into the civil list, with a view to making greater reductions than those proposed by the government. To the surprise of Wellington and most of his colleagues, the motion for inquiry was carried by 233-204.
