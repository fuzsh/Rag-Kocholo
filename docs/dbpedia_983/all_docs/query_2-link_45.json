        "text": "She succeeds Vaughan Gething, who lasted less than 140 days as first minister, having presided over a turbulent period in office, beset by rows over donations and sacked ministers.\n\nBaroness Morgan, 57, was confirmed as leader of the Welsh Labour Party on July 24, but could not take over as First Minister without a vote in the Senedd.\n\nThe Welsh Parliament, which would normally be on summer break, was recalled on Tuesday to allow Baroness Morgan, the health minister, to take over as leader of the Welsh Government.\n\nShe becomes the first woman to lead the country.\n\nBefore she is officially confirmed as First Minister, she must write to the King to seek his approval.\n\nShe had the support of the Labour members of the Senedd while Plaid Cymru and the Conservatives voted for their respective party leaders.\n\nJane Dodds, the sole Liberal Democrat, abstained from endorsing a candidate, despite having supported Mr Gething earlier this year.\n\nThe opposition parties putting forward alternative choices was largely symbolic, with neither having enough votes to secure the role.\n\nIn total, Baroness Morgan received 28 votes, one more than her predecessor Mr Gething.\n\nThe Conservatives’ Andrew RT Davies won 15 votes and Plaid Cymru’s Rhun ap Iorwerth 12 votes.\n\nIf Ms Dodds had voted for an alternative candidate there would have been 28 members voting for a different FM.\n\nBaroness Morgan’s backers include the outgoing first minister Mr Gething.\n\nShe is the first woman to lead the Welsh Government in its 25-year history, something she has said she is proud of.\n\nGiving a speech in both English and Welsh, Baroness Morgan said: “It is the honour of my life to stand before you today as the first woman to become the First Minister of Wales.”\n\nShe paid tribute to her predecessor Mr Gething as “another true trailblazer” in the journey of devolution, as well as her predecessors Alun Michael, Rhodri Morgan, Carwyn Jones and Mark Drakeford.\n\nThe new First Minister said she hoped to “add my own distinctive contribution to this legacy”, adding: “Perhaps with a vibrant splash of colour. The grey suits are out.”\n\nBaroness Morgan also acknowledged the difficulties Welsh Labour has faced in recent months, with her being the third leader of the party this year.\n\nShe told the Senedd: “The last few weeks have been difficult and we have been through some turmoil.\n\n“But we know that we are at our best when we work in unity as a party and as a nation.”\n\nThe new First Minister said her government’s “focus will be firmly on Wales and its people, listening to what people want and delivering in every corner of this great nation”.\n\nShe also confirmed Huw Irranca-Davies would be her deputy first minister, describing him as “impressive”, adding: “I couldn’t ask for a more capable political partner.”\n\nSpeaking to the PA news agency, Baroness Morgan said her new role had not sunk in yet but that she was “delighted”.\n\nThroughout the summer the new FM is taking part in a listening exercise and wants to hear what the Welsh public’s priorities are.\n\nHowever, she also said some areas would need to be “de-prioritised” but could not say what.\n\n“Obviously, other things will have to take some slack and see some difference,” she said.\n\nThe new Welsh leader said she is determined not to see a rise in hate crimes in the country, after a series of riots across England which have seen mosques and hotels housing migrants attacked.\n\n“We’re certainly not being complacent here,” she said.\n\n“We know that there are tensions in some communities, but we are determined to make sure we don’t see the rise of hate crime in Wales.\n\n“We have a whole series of measures to help us with that and I’ve already asked for an early meeting with the police and some faith community leaders.”\n\nWelsh opposition party leaders welcomed Baroness Morgan to the role, but questioned her about the future of the Welsh Government.\n\nWelsh Tory leader Mr Davies urged the new First Minister to engage with the Welsh Parliament throughout the recess, adding: “You are the third first minister in this year and ultimately that obviously has had a very corrosive effect in the delivery of government and the delivery of initiatives that the government has brought forward here in Wales.”\n\nHe also asked what the new leader would do about plans to revalue council tax bands and deal with the health service in Wales, among other issues.\n\nPlaid Cymru leader Mr ap Iorwerth said his party would “wish her well today”.\n\nBut referencing the demises of Liz Truss and Humza Yousaf, he added: “We also remind her and her government that in similar circumstances elsewhere the Labour hierarchy argued that multiple changes in leadership in Westminster and in Scotland undermines the democratic legitimacy of government and demanded fresh elections.\n\n“It is for Labour to explain why different rules should apply in Wales.”\n\nOutside of y Siambr, the Senedd’s debating chamber, Baroness Morgan gave a second speech to members of the public.\n\nThe new First Minister stepped out to the song Girl On Fire by Alicia Keys.\n\nShe thanked her mother and father for instilling the values “that I hold dear today” as well as thanking the “Labour family” for helping her on her journey.\n\nMr Gething, who took over from Mr Drakeford in March, announced his intention to resign last month after four members of his government quit, criticising his leadership.\n\nDuring the last leadership race, Mr Gething took a £200,000 donation for his campaign from a company owned by a man twice convicted of environmental offences, which led to some members of his own party criticising his judgment.\n\nIn June, Mr Gething lost a vote of no confidence in the Senedd, after rows over the donation, and his decision to sack Delyn MS Hannah Blythyn as a minister.\n\nBaroness Morgan ran on a “unity ticket”, promising to bring the Labour group back together.\n\nShe told PA the rebuild of Labour was going “incredibly well”. insisting there was a “real sense that the page has been turned”.\n\nThe new First Minister was pictured on the stairs of the Senedd with her Labour colleagues on Tuesday, including Mr Gething and Hannah Blythyn."
