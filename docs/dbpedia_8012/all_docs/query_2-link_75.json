        "text": "The right to personal self-defense shapes international human rights law by establishing a deep but narrow justification for the use of force in law enforcement. It is “deep” because the defense of life against imminent threat constitutes the sole ground on which law enforcement agents may deliberately deprive individuals of their right to life. In some constellations, the police may even have a duty to take an aggressor’s life where this is absolutely necessary to protect innocent life. At the same time, the self-defense justification is “narrow,” since it is subject to strict formal and substantive requirements. Police cannot simply assume a right to use force in self-defense, but such a right has to be established and regulated in publicly available laws. There are even good reasons to take the view, as the Inter-American human rights bodies do, that the police’s right to kill in self-defense must be established by parliamentary statute. The substantive requirements for law enforcement agents’ use of defensive force established by international human rights law seemingly mirror those generally found in domestic criminal laws. Self-defense may only be exercised against an unlawful (but not necessarily culpable) human attack targeting protectedindividual interests. Law enforcement agents can claim to defend themselves or others only in the face of immediately antecedent, present, or ongoing threats. Retribution for past attacks or pre-emptive force cannot be justified as selfdefense. Furthermore, the defensive action must be necessary, proportional, and driven by subjective awareness of the defense situation. These requirements have particular features where law enforcement agents use defensive force. This is notably the case because law enforcement officers, unlike private individuals, represent the state and its values, and have a proclaimed monopoly on the use of force. State agents therefore have no general duty to retreat to avoid lethal force. But they must proactively de-escalate potentially violent situations where force in self-defense might become otherwise necessary. As state representatives, law enforcement agents are also prohibited from defending property with lethal force. They may not engage in torture or inhuman treatment even where information extracted from such acts can defend innocent lives against an imminent threat. As each officer’s individual defensive action is embedded in the authorities’ wider collective response, both have to be assessed to determine whether the use of force constituted necessary and proportional self-defense. Human rights violations may ensue if the authorities place individual agents in situations where they unnecessarily use force, either because the authorities did not appropriately plan, command, and control operations or because they failed to adequately select, train, and equip its law enforcement agents. The duties of the state do not end as soon as the defensive action is concluded. The state has a duty to provide medical care to anyone injured during law enforcement operations. Furthermore, it must ensure that the use of force is duly investigated so as to ensure that perpetrators of intentional or grossly negligent excessive force are held accountable and the victims duly compensated."
