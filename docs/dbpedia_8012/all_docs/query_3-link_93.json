        "text": "In 2018, we published an article that provided a first attempt to survey the whole output of the seventeenth-century Dutch Republic. Our estimate was a minimum of 357,500 editions. This calculation did not yet include the world of ephemeral forms, handbills and posters. The survival of such commercial or private notices is microscopically small, compared to what must have been produced. It is nevertheless vital for our understanding of the print trade that we attempt to capture the complexities of this lost world: this was work that sustained printshops. It was also the form which most acutely influenced commerce, government and social life. Here we wish to offer an introduction to this most elusive genre of the early modern print world, document the myriad ways in which print in infiltrated the daily life of people, and offer some hypotheses on the likely total output of certain forms of ephemeral print.\n\nThe Netherlands housed a number of widely known, envied and emulated centres of accumulation during the early-modern period. Raw and manufactured goods passed through Dutch port cities, linking the country to global cycles of accumulation and exchange. Its institutions of learning and culture similarly served as internationally famous centres of accumulation that furthered knowledge and cultural production, embodied in the form of books, maps and prints, exhibits and the like. Centres and Cycles of Accumulation in and around the Netherlands brings histories of manufacture, commerce and global exchange together with histories of knowledge and cultural circulation during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by anatomizing the multi-faceted concept of accumulation. Its essays explore the processes that led to the formation of concentrated, often hybrid, sites of material, intellectual and cultural accumulation in the Netherlands and its overseas stations, as well as the concerns and consequences to which the successes and challenges of accumulation gave rise.\n\nThis article studies the strategies and effects of early modern public diplomacy. It does so by analysing how two English ambassadors stationed in the Dutch Republic during the Truce period (1609–1621), Ralph Winwood and Dudley Carleton, used print in their diplomatic negotiations. Focusing on the Vorstius affair (1611–1613) and the affair of the Balance (1617–1619), the article shows how Dutch politico-religious controversies became entangled with foreign policy. Winwood and Carleton, it argues, had a clear public diplomacy strategy in which print played a prominent part. Their public interventions contributed to the escalation of the Dutch conflict, and severely damaged both the domestic and international reputation of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt. Thus, English public diplomacy helped to bring about the fall of this leading statesman.\n\nThe seventeenth-century Dutch Republic was a highly literate society. The Dutch produced, and consumed, more printed items per head than any other people in Europe. Books were imported from all the major European centres of production, and exported to markets the Dutch soon came to dominate. In the seventeenth century Amsterdam was already ‘the bookshop of the world’. Yet there has never previously been an attempt to estimate the full extent of print production undertaken by the Dutch printing industry. Building on the foundations of the Short Title Catalogue Netherlands (STCN), we undertake such a systematic evaluation here, beginning with classes of print excluded from the terms of reference of the STCN, such as broadsheets, newspapers and printed diplomatic despatches. We then assess how many books will be located in libraries abroad not included in the STCN survey. In a methodological innovation, we also attempt to reconstruct the population of books known to have been printed, but not found in libraries today: ‘lost books’ identified in auction catalogues, publishers’ stock catalogues and newspaper advertisements. Finally we integrate information from archival resources, which helps us offer a survey of the total output of two genres of print extremely susceptible to loss, government ordinances and printing for universities. In total, we postulate that, at a conservative estimate, Dutch printing houses published at least 357,500 editions: over five times the number registered in the STCN. This higher figure should be the starting point for any attempt to examine the economic structures of the print trade, and the impact of print on Dutch society."
