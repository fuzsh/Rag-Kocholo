        "text": "The editions of legal texts are a major and important part of 15th-century book output, amounting to about 15% of the surviving extant editions. The category comprehends two types of work: (a) the collections of Roman and Canon Law, with their medieval supplements and commentaries; (b) acts and regulations produced by governments and by local authorities as part of their day-to-day activity. After a general overview, this article focuses on the first group of texts, which offers an opportunity to address some key questions related to the impact of printing in a particular cultural context, that of the university. A study of legal texts printed in the 15th century aims to provide a relevant contribution to a better understanding of the impact of printing by comparing elements of continuity and discontinuity with the manuscript and later printed tradition.\n\nIn: Competition in the European Book Market. Prices and privileges (fifteenth-sixteenth centuries), edited by Angela Nuovo, Joran Proot, Diane E. Booton. In 1507 a contract was signed affirming the foundation of a company composed of Battista and Silvestro Torti , Lucantonio Giunta, Giorgio Arrivabene, Amedeo Scoto, and Antonio Moretto to publish legal texts. The contract, is well known to book historians but was still awaiting a thorough analysis. This article provides the edition of the text (and its translation into English) and a comment focusing on the core of the agreement (and some of the many elements worth noting). The core of the contract consisted in a very ambitious programme: they agreed on printing the works of almost all the most relevant jurists, a consistent catalogue to address a specific target of customers. Both the list of authors and the very idea of the joint-venture (between the Torti, well established in the field of legal editions, and Giunta, one of the greatest publishers of his time, and the others) resulted from the refined professionality reached by early modern printers and reflected in the sentence 'per mazor utilitade nostra e reputatione del mestier' which is eventually found in the text of the contract.\n\nIn: Bartolo da Sassoferrato nella cultura europea tra Medioevo e Rinascimento, a cura di V. Crescenzi e G. Rossi, pp. 253-284. The great success of Bartolus’ work, reflected in a vast manuscript production, was later confirmed by the early production in print: in the 15th century were published approximately two hundred editions of his texts. This article is the first result of a research conceived within the ERC project 15cBOOKTRADE; this research aims to reconstruct in detail the corpus of Bartolus’ works printed in the15th century as a contribution to a better understanding of the transition from the manuscript production to the collections of texts published in the 16th century.The first step of this research provides a general view, by setting out the group of the editiones principes and the collections of texts they contain according to the arrangement of the early printers.\n\ned. by Goran Proot, David McKitterick, Angela Nuovo and Paul F. Gehl. With a preface by David McKitterick. Mechelen: Flanders Book Historical Society, 2018, ISBN 9789082927603, pp. 1-15. This paper aims to show how a family of stationers, who had long supplied parchment, paper and possibly manuscript books to the academic and professional market in Perugia, reinvented itself by starting a business to address all areas of the new print world. The focus is on the role played by Francesco Cartolari and the strategies he adopted in leading a transformation which ended up with the reintroduction of printing activity in Perugia and the foundation of a publishing house [special edition issued in 20 copies in September 2018; the definitive version was printed in December s.a.]. This essay is based on material collected for my PhD in History (2012) but it was written during my Postdoc at Oxford, as team member of the 15cBOOKTRADE Project funded by the European Research Council (ERC 2014-2019).\n\nIn: Italia e Cuba / Cuba e Italia: incontri e nuove identità (secoli XV-XXI) | Italia y Cuba / Cuba e Italia: encuentros y nuevas identidades (siglos XV-XXI), a cura di / editado por: Laura Gaffuri, Sergio Guerra Vilaboy, Andrea Trisciuoglio (Torino: OTTO Editore, 2023. ISBN 978-88-95285-75-7), pp. 173-192. Il saggio illustra, nella prima parte, il grado di autorevolezza acquisito, nel corso di una vita assai breve, dal giurista Bartolo da Sassoferrato (Sassoferrato 1313/14 – Perugia 1357/58) con attenzione particolare alla penisola iberica, dove a Bartolo nel Quattrocento fu riconosciuto per legge lo status di figura dirimente nei casi di dubbio. L’ampliamento dei confini al di là dell’Oceano portò con sé la disposizione di legge, che ad esempio fu esplicitamente confermata in Brasile agli inizi del XVII secolo. Attestata così la fortuna del giurista oltreoceano, la seconda parte del saggio spiega come ricostruirla, nell’ampiezza e nella durata, illustrando nelle linee generali le fonti e il metodo d’indagine. Quanto alle prime, due gruppi di fonti sono individuate, rispettivamente, nelle liste dei testi di studio proposti per gli studenti di legge nel periodo considerato e negli elenchi dei libri esportati dalla Spagna alle Americhe, due ambiti rispetto ai quali molto è già emerso in recenti progetti di ricerca. Parallelamente, la ricerca dovrebbe spostarsi sull’indagine sistematica di inventari e cataloghi storici, per approdare infine nelle raccolte ancora esistenti, per esaminare gli esemplari sopravvissuti. Una ricerca ricca e complessa che però può avvalersi di strumenti digitali già esistenti, che potrebbero facilmente essere applicati al caso di studio agevolando altresì l’avvio di una collaborazione intercontinentale. A medieval jurist in the New World. Towards a study of the influence of Bartolus de Saxoferrato beyond the Ocean. The article first focuses on the grade of authority acquired by the jurist Bartolus de Saxoferrato (Sassoferrato 1313/14 – Perugia 1357/58) during his brief life, with a special attention to the Iberian Peninsula, since his status as main reference in case of doubt was legally recognized during the 15th century. Such recognition was confirmed and exported in the colonies, for instance in the Brazil’s legislation at the beginning of the 17th century. How long the jurist did retain his authority can be reconstructed through various sources, such as textbooks for law students or lists of books shipped from Spain to the Americas, both investigated in recent projects. And besides, as a result of the evidences in the current collections, the inventories of historical libraries can inform us about the world presence of Bartolus’ works. Digital tools already existing can help in reconstructing historical libraries and could be applied to this case at hand within an intercontinental collaboration framework."
