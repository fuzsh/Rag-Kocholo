        "text": "* Margaret, who never set foot in Scotland, d. at age 7 and the legitimate issue of William I became extinct. A trial was held, supervised by King Edward I of England, and 14 candidates for the throne presented themselves:\n\nJohn Balliol, descendant of Henry Huntingdon\n\nRobert de Brus, descendant of Henry Huntingdon\n\nEdward I of England, descendant of King Malcolm III\n\nWilliam de Ros, descendant of King William I's natural daughter\n\nEric II of Norway, Queen Margaret's father\n\nFloris V of Holland, descendant of Henry Huntingdon\n\nPatrick Dunbar, descendant of King William I's natural daughter; also closest agnate of House of Dunkeld\n\nPatrick Galithly, descendant of William I's natural son\n\nRoger de Mandeville, descendant of William I's natural daughter\n\nNicholas de Soules, descendant of Duncan I\n\nJohn Hastings, descendant of Henry Huntingdon\n\nWilliam de Vesci, descendant of King William I's natural daughter\n\nJohn Comyn, descendant of King Donald III\n\nRobert de Pinkeney, descendant of Henry Huntingdon\n\nOf these claims, only those of Baliol and Brus were really serious. King Edward I used the crisis to increase his power in Scotland, sided with the Baliol faction, and eventually claimed the throne for himself. King John abdicated in 1296 and Edward I waged war with William Wallace for control of Scotland.\n\nWe do not show all the Regents during this troubled period. (Although English domination persisted until the 1314 Battle of Bannockburn, and their claim was not formally renounced until 1328, we do not show Edward's heirs in this list.)"
