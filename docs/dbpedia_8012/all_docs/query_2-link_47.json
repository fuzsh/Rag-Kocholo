Emil Jellinek enters two cars registered, as in the previous year, under his pseudonym \"Mercédès\". During the Nice-La Turbie hill race, company driver Wilhelm Bauer in \"Mercédès I\" is killed when he comes out of a bend and drives straight into a wall. Co-driver Hermann Braun, who had already turned over \"Mercédès I\" during the Nice-Marseilles race, escapes unhurt. The tragic incident causes Jellinek to call for the development of a lighter vehicle with a longer wheelbase and lower center of gravity.\n\nApril 2: In Monaco, Emil Jellinek sets up a company for selling Daimler cars and engines. That same month he orders 36 vehicles in Cannstatt for a total price of 550,000 goldmarks - on condition that he is granted exclusive rights to market them under the name of \"Mercedes\" in Austria-Hungary, France, Belgium and the USA. On June 8, Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft confirms his order.\n\n8.
