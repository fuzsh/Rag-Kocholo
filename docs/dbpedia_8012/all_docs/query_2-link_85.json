Since that time some of Dürer’s lost watercolors have been found, two of his portraits have been returned to the Weimar Museum, and two of the three religious works from the Alte Pinakothek, attacked by a vandal in 1988, have been restored. During this time the oeuvre of Hans Hofmann has grown, while the number of Dürer’s nature studies has grown smaller. Changes of ownership, physical condition, attribution, and questions of the artist’s reception have been of primary importance here. Only the most basic items from the pre-1971 literature have been included here, together with certain works of historic interest, and works published in the United States that were not available to Mende. Bearing in mind that some users of this work may be curators whose own specialties may lie in other areas than German art, generous summaries of the most important works are given; these are intended merely as guides to the literature, and should in no case be regarded as substitutes for the original documents. The serious researcher also will need ready access, at a minimum, to Mende’s bibliography, as well as to the corpus of Dürer’s written work edited by Hans Rupprich (Dürers schriftlicher Nachlass, q.v.); Fedja Anzelewsky’s catalogue of the paintings (2nd edition, 1990, q.v.); one of the several catalogues of the artist’s prints, such as those by Josef Meder, Karl-Adolph Knappe, or Walter Strauss’s volume for The Illustrated Bartsch series (q.v.), each of which is useful for different reasons; Friedrich Winkler’s catalogue of the drawings, or Walter Strauss’s more inclusive but controversial one. The best single work on Dürer’s critical and literary reception is Jan Bialostocki’s Dürer and His Critics (q.v.), while the final chapter of my Albrecht Dürer: A Biography (“The Celebrated Albrecht Dürer”) summarizes the artist’s posthumous public reception as reflected in the various celebrations organized to mark his birth and death anniversaries. Jane Campbell Hutchison Madison, Wisconsin July 9, 1999\n\nSeries Editor’s Foreword\n\n“Our ideas about the past are the results of an immense cooperative effort.” (E.H.GOMBRICH, THE STORY OF ART) Each generation sees any important artist differently. The Garland series Artist Resource Manuals offers a new kind of reference guide that traces the history of the critical reception of major artists by tracing the literary evidence. Collecting and presenting the facts on how artists were received and how their oeuvre was perceived will provide the foundations for a better understanding of the masters. Each volume has as its core a historical essay or reception history that deals with the fame and fortune of the artist from his or her own time through successive ages to the present. This is followed by a critical annotated bibliography that comprises a listing of essential primary sources as well as selections from the secondary literature. Primary sources may include the artist’s programmatic, theoretical, and autobiographical writings. Secondary sources include monographs as well as oeuvre and exhibition catalogues. Auction sale catalogues, commemorative volumes of collected essays (Festschriften), museum bulletins and yearbooks, and learned papers published in scholarly journals, as well as occasional articles published in newspapers and reflections in other creative media, including those of popular culture, are given due consideration commensurate with their importance. The present volume differs from the two in the series that precede it in that it is both an independent reference tool and the supplement to an earlier work which it brings up-to-date. Coincident with the worldwide quincentennial celebration of Albrecht Dürer’s birth, Matthias Mende published his comprehensive bibliography in 1971 (q.v.) With the two earlier bibliographies by Singer* and Bohatta,** published in 1928 on the occasion of the four hundredth anniversary of the artist’s death, Mende’s work shares a major shortcoming of all “occasional” publications of this sort: it misses the avalanche of new\n\nvii\n\npublications that the event itself engenders. Jane Hutchison’s book fulfills the essential function of closing that gap.

Already in 1505 Jakob Wimpfeling (1450–1528), the first German historian, had reported that “pictures” by Dürer (he seems to have meant prints) were being marketed in Italy, where they were “as highly prized as paintings by Parrhasius and Apelles.”2 Dürer’s contracts with two sales agents charged with selling his prints abroad have been preserved in Nuremberg’s Stadtarchiv,3 lending a certain credibility to this statement—although, of course, no work by either Parrhasius nor Apelles has survived. Like Beatus Rhenanus, Wimpfeling was an Alsatian living in Strassburg at the time of writing; it should perhaps come as no great surprise that the first stirrings of nationalist sentiment should have been expressed by writers living at the westernmost edge of German-speaking territory, on the left bank of the Rhine, where the Holy Roman Empire was bounded by France. Wimpfeling, a former professor of poetry at Heidelberg, was a friend of the “arch-humanist” Conrad Celtis (1459–1508), Germany’s first native-born Imperial poet laureate and a friend of both Dürer and Willibald Pirckheimer, His address at the University of Ingolstadt (August 31, 1492) had been a call for a new German culture. Celtis challenged his countrymen that, “having taken over the rule of the Italians and having cast off your vile barbarity, [you] must strive after the Roman arts. Take away that infamy of the Germans among the Greek, Latin and Hebrew writers who ascribe to us drunkenness, barbarism, cruelty and whatever is bestial and foolish….” Beatus Rhenanus, the man whom Erasmus of Rotterdam called his “alter ego,” was also in correspondence with Pirckheimer, as well as with the Augsburg classicist Konrad Peutinger, the Nuremberg theologian-poet Johann Cochläus, and Benedictus Chelidonius (né Schwalbe), author of the Latin poetry that served\n\n2 ALBRECHT DÜRER: A GUIDE TO RESEARCH\n\nas text to Dürer’s Marienleben. All were personal friends of the artist. The Reformer Philipp Melanchthon (1497–1560), founder of Nuremberg’s new humanistic Gymnasium (1526) and the owner of a complete collection of Dürer’s graphic art, characterized his friend’s work as comparable to the highest form of rhetoric—rich in variety and classical allusions4—while the Imperial poet and knight-errant Ulrich von Hutten (1488–1523) noted in 1518 that Dürer had earned the respect of “the Italians, who do not easily praise a German, whether because of envy…or because of the old idea that…we are stupid and good-for-nothing.”5 Indeed, an unflattering image of the Germans as drunkards and savages pervaded both ancient and modern literature written in Italy. Tacitus, whose newly recovered Germania Celtis had edited for publication, had claimed that the ancient Germans slept “until a late hour of the day,” that they went everywhere armed to the teeth, and that “to pass an entire night in drinking disgrace[d] no one.”6 Moreover, the Italians were not alone in taking a dim view of the Germans, for the furor teutonicus had been reviled during the Middle Ages by even such erstwhile fellow barbarians as the English and French.7 John of Salisbury, the twelfth-century Bishop of Chartres, had stigmatized the Germans as both bruti (unreasoning) and impetuosi (lacking in control), two failings that Dürer’s art seems almost deliberately calculated to negate, just as his nearly superhuman productivity ran directly counter to the popular stereotype of “the” Teutonic barbarian as a pathological wastrel. Dürer’s early and short-lived activity as creator of engravings and drawings of recherché subjects from ancient literature—despite his own minimal formal education—is proof of his compliance with Celtis’s plan to cultivate and publicize the arts in Germany, as are his landscape watercolors of the Nuremberg area dating from the time of Celtis’s Norimberga (mid-1490s), and his contracts with two traveling sales agents to market his prints in “foreign” lands.8 If more proof were needed, it is supplied by the inscription on the artist’s famous Self Portrait of 1500 (Munich, Alte Pinakothek), composed by Celtis’s personal secretary, as well as by the flattering laudatio that Celtis himself penned in Dürer’s honor: To the Painter Albrecht Dürer of Nuremberg. Albrecht, most famous painter in German lands Where the Frankish town raises its lofty head up to the stars, You represent to us a second Phidias, a second Apelles And others whom ancient Greece admires for their sovereign hand. Neither Italy nor versatile France has seen his equal Nor will anyone find him in the Spanish domain. You leave the Hungarians behind as well as the dwellers within the German confines And those who dwell around the Black Sea…9\n\nALBRECHT DÜRER (1471–1528) IN GERMAN HISTORY 3\n\nThe Nuremberg lawyer Christoph Scheurl (1481–1552)10 who was related to Dürer’s clients the Tucher family, had been a student at the university of Bologna during the artist’s second trip to Italy. He reported that in Venice as well as in Bologna Dürer had earned the soubriquet “the second Apelles.” He further claimed that, rivaling Parrhasius, whose painting of grapes was said to have deceived the birds, one of Dürer’s self portraits had been kissed by the artist’s dog, who mistook it for his master—an anecdote first reported by Celtis.11 Scheurl, whose nephew Albrecht was Dürer’s godson, went on to quote three flattering poems in praise of Dürer penned by the wandering north-Italian poet Ricardus Sbrulius (Riccardo Sbroglio), who not only compared him to Apelles but declared him worthy of Olympus.12 Sbrulius had met Dürer in Italy in 1506, before leaving to become a member of the faculty of Wittenberg’s new university in 1508. The Silesian neo-Latin poet Caspar Ursinus Velius (a.k.a. Kaspar Bernhard, ca. 1493–1539) penned epigrams in praise of Dürer’s Adam and Eve (presumably the 1504 engraving (M.1)13 Erasmus of Rotterdam compared the artist to Pamphilus, the ancient Macedonian mathematician in a Latin dialogue of 1528, declaring also that he had bested Apelles by his ability to work only in black lines, and repeatedly referred to him as “our Apelles” in his correspondence with Pirckheimer after 1523.14 Dürer’s death in 1528 prompted a veritable avalanche of obituary poetry written by his humanist friends, as well as a letter of condolence to Pirckheimer from Martin Luther,15 who had received a gift of prints from the artist and was aware of Dürer’s avid interest in his own early pamphlets. Three days after the burial a belated attempt was made by Nuremberg’s humanists to immortalize Dürer’s face and one of his hands in plaster casts, in imitation of the Italian vogue for death masks.16 A lock of the artist’s hair, clipped and sent to his former journeyman and friend Hans Baldung, whom Dürer had called “Grien Hans” (1484/1485–1545) was treasured as a holy relic by a succession of artists ever afterward until 1873 when it was donated to the Vienna Academy, where it remains today.17 The 1532/1534 Latin edition of Dürer’s Four Books of Human Proportion was prefaced with a full-dress biography of the artist written by the Bamberg philologist Joachim Camerarius (Kammermeister) (1500– 1574), a colleague of Luther’s and Philipp Melanchthon’s on the Wittenberg faculty and Melanchthon’s choice as Rector and Professor of Greek at the new Nuremberg Gymnasium (1526–1532).18 Camerarius praised Dürer’s own elegantly proportioned body and Grecian nose as well as his high moral character, highly placed patrons, and mathematical and scientific ability and his matchless ability to recreate the effects of nature.19 Albrecht Dürer is still acknowledged to be, not simply first among the Germans, but one of a half-dozen of the world’s most renowned artists—none of whom was more acutely aware than he of the power of history and of the press. In 1498, with the aid of his godfather’s typefaces, he became the first artist in\n\n4 ALBRECHT DÜRER: A GUIDE TO RESEARCH\n\nhistory to act as his own publisher. None has been more widely and consistently admired, quoted and copied than Dürer, whose life’s work has never suffered the periods of critical neglect that at one time or another befell even such masters as Raphael and Rembrandt, both of whom owned works by Dürer. His contemporary Raphael (1483–1520), who is alleged by Ludvico Dolce to have kept a Dürer drawing taped to his wall,20 was idolized throughout the seventeenth through the early nineteenth centuries, when art academies were in fashion, but conversely has always been reviled by subsequent anti-academics. Rembrandt (1606–1669), who owned an edition of the Four Books of Human Proportion and clearly was influenced by a number of Dürer’s prints, such as his woodcut of he Death of the Virgin, was already being severely criticized within a generation of his own death for his supposed failure to finish many of his late paintings, as well as for such supposed ethical lapses as having made small alterations to his etching plates “in order to sell old prints as new ones.”21 Rembrandt posthumously became a hero in the eyes of Goethe’s generation, where he was compared to Shakespeare in his ability to deal with reality and the human psyche, but Goethe and his friends also were avid collectors of Dürer’s prints. Carl Neumann, whose Rembrandt monograph of 1902 extolled Rembrandt as “der Maler der Seele” (soul painter),22 also held a sympathetic view of Dürer, whom he classed with Dante, Leonardo, and, of all people, St. Francis of Assisi, as “nourished by the heart’s blood and the spiritual soul of the Middle Ages”— an accolade that surely would have surprised the artist. Far from steeping himself in the heart’s blood of the Middle Ages, of course, Dürer had deliberately sacrificed years of his creative life in order almost singlehandedly to bring the Renaissance to Germany. The saintly paradigm does have a precedent of sorts in the writings of no less a person than Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti (1522–1597), Archbishop of Bologna,23 who helped shape the Counter-Reformation’s position on the uses of the visual arts. In his chapter, “Examples of some painters, sculptors and other image-makers who have been accepted among the saints and blessed, or who had the repute of the most exemplary life,” the Cardinal includes Dürer “the German painter and geometrician” in the company of Pietro Cavallini and two artists in holy orders, Fra Angelico and Fra Bartolommeo. Paleotti was particularly gratified that the German artist (whose Lutheran sympathies were probably unknown to him) had refused to stoop to the manufacture of pornographic prints, unlike many other engravers of his day and later. Indeed, Dürer’s moral rectitude was such that his graphic works were recommended by Francisco Pacheco (1571–1654) author of the Arte de la Pintura (1649) and censor of paintings for the Spanish Inquisition. The odor of sanctity was destined to escalate in certain of the religious paintings of the seventeenth-century “Dürer Renaissance”, where copies of the Christ-like 1500 Self Portrait sometimes were used as depictions of the Savior himself,24 and further in the quasireligious Dürer festivals of the early nineteenth century, when the artist’s biography would be illustrated in a series of\n\nALBRECHT DÜRER (1471–1528) IN GERMAN HISTORY 5\n\nChristianized typological parallels, and when specially composed “oratorios” were sung at his grave on Easter morning in Nuremberg’s Cemetery of St. John.25 Dürer’s graphic art played an important role in the training of young artists in both Europe and the New World for centuries to come. Giorgio Vasari, the first foreign author to publish a comprehensive discussion of Dürer’s work26 particularly admired the Prodigal Son and Meerwunder engravings—although he mistakenly declared their creator to have been Flemish. He also told the unsubstantiated story of Dürer’s vain attempt to obtain a restraining order from the Venetian Senate against Marcantonio Raimondi’s copperplate copies of his Life of the Virgin and other woodcut series—a case that resulted only in the prohibition against Raimondi’s use of Dürer’s monogram on such pirated copies. In Latin America his prints, due to the endorsements of Paleotti and Pacheco, were sent to accompany Spanish missionaries. Dürer’s paintings were less influential, perhaps in part because so many had been acquired by Rudolph II and the Archduke Maximilian, but also because their lack of idealism made them less attractive to Italian, English and French collectors who preferred Italian works. In those areas where his paintings were not found, however, the artist’s fame was kept alive by his stature as scientist and mathematician, and he was considered Leonardo da Vinci’s equal in such matters. Sebastiano Serlio’s Book IV: On the Five Roman Orders (Venice, 1537) was based on Dürer’s Befestigung der Stett, Schloss und Flecken (1527: Treatise on Fortification), the first book on architecture ever to be published with illustrations.27 To the Milanese theoretician Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo (1538– 1600), whose work on human proportion was heavily indebted to Dürer, he was “il gran Druvido Alberto Durero,” who could have become the best painter in the world if only he had been privileged to study in Italy with Raphael.28 Lomazzo singled out for special praise the German artist’s “sure mathematical procedure… and…his knowledge of sciences, which he possessed to the highest degree…and which must accompany art and must be connected with it.” Dürer’s method for constructing a regular pentagon inspired a host of Italian mathematicians, and was the subject of a special treatise by Pietro Antonio Cataldi of Bologna (1570),29 cited later with respect by both Galileo and Johannes Kepler. Lomazzo’s treatise reappeared in the English translation by Richard Haydocke (Oxford, 1598), and was an inspiration to the Elizabethan miniaturist Nicholas Milliard, who composed his own Treatise concerning the Arte of Limning (ca. 1600).30 Carel van Mander (1548–1606), who had traveled widely in Italy and Germany before settling in Haarlem, was the first to publish a list of Dürer’s paintings (he declared the artist’s woodcuts and engravings too well known among both artists and collectors to need enumerating).31 He had seen fourteen of the paintings, including the Adoration of the Magi (1504) now in the Uffizi; the Virgin with the Siskin (1506: Berlin); the Adam and Eve (1507: Madrid); the Landauer Altarpiece (1511: Vienna); the Heller Altarpiece (commissioned 1508: destroyed: then still in the Dominican monastery in Frankfurt); the idealized\n\n6 ALBRECHT DÜRER: A GUIDE TO RESEARCH\n\nportraits of Charlemagne and Sigismund (Nuremberg); the so-called Four Apostles (Munich); the Self Portrait of 1500 (1526: Munich); and a portrait of the artist’s mother, identified by the late Lotte Brand Philip with the painting of a heretofore unknown woman in Nuremberg’s Germanisches Nationalmuseum.32 He also mentioned a painting of Lucretia in the collection of Melchior Wijntgis in Middelburg, which seems not to be identifiable with the one now in Munich (date 1518: Alte Pinakothek). In Chapter 10 (“On Clothes and Drapery”) of the theoretical section of his book, he praised Dürer’s engraved drapery for variety of fabrics and excellent effects of lighting and of drapery in motion. Van Mander’s book appeared at the apogee of what Hans Kauffmann was later to identify as the “Dürer Renaissance,”33 when such influential collectors as the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II and the Elector Maximilian I of Bavaria were assembling the works that today form the nucleii of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna and the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. Joachim von Sandrart (1606–1688) in his Teutschen Akademie (1675: Nuremberg) relates how Rudolph, having purchased the Feast of the Rose Garlands from the church of St. Bartolommeo in Venice, ordered that it be carefully wrapped in rugs, padded with cotton-wool and baled in waterproof waxed cloth before being “carried on poles by a group of strong men all the way to the Imperial Residence in Prague in order to avoid its being jolted, shaken or injured on a cart.” Rudolph also acquired the Landauer Altarpiece (Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum), the Adam and Eve panels (Madrid, Prado) and the majority of the watercolors (Vienna, Albertina). Rudolph’s obsession with Dürer’s work was exceeded only by that of the Elector, Maximilian I of Bavaria (1573–1651), head of the Catholic League in the Thirty Years’ War. From the Dominican cloister in Frankfurt he purchased the Heller Altar (unfortunately destroyed later in a palace fire); from the Imhoff collection in Nuremberg the Glimm Lamentation; and the Paumgartner Altarpiece from the church of St. Catherine. He also acquired the so-called Four Apostles from the City Hall, ordering that the extensive Biblical quotations in Luther’s German be sawed off and returned to Nuremberg with the replacement copies of the paintings. Among other purchases, some of them also destroyed in the fire, he acquired the Hercules and the Stymphalian Birds (Nuremberg, Germanisches Nationalmuseum). As head of the Catholic League, he was in the fortunate position of being able to exert political pressure on Protestant Nuremberg to part with its treasures. In another case Field Marshall Johann Graf von Tilly (1559–1632) and the Bavarian Commissioner of War Hans Christoph von Reupp were pressed into service to obtain Dürer’s St. Jerome from the Marienkirche in Stendal (Brandenburg) for Maximilian; unfortunately it was sent by supply train by way of Hesse and was lost in transit. In 1681 Sandrart purchased the tomb in Nuremberg’s Cemetery of St. John that had originally held the artist’s body, renovating the original Latin epitaph composed by Willibald Pirckheimer (“Whatever was mortal of Albrecht Dürer is covered by this stone”), and augmenting it with a coat-of-arms and a new and\n\nALBRECHT DÜRER (1471–1528) IN GERMAN HISTORY 7\n\nmore florid inscription comprised of a verse in German followed by a Latin eulogy: “Hier ruhe Künstlerfürst Du mehr als grosser Mann! In Vielkunst hat es dir noch keiner gleich getan. Die Erd war ausgemalt der Himmel dich jetzt hat; du malest heilig nun dort an der Gottestatt Die Bau-Bild- und Malerkunst Die nennen dich Patron und setzen dir nun auf imTod die Lorbeerkron.” “Rest here, oh artist prince Thou more than worthy man! In mastering all arts None equalled thee. Thy work on earth complete In heaven is thy home; Thou paintest, saintly now, Beside God’s sacred throne, The builders, sculptors, painters Call thee Patron (saint) In death they now award thee The (artist’s) laurel crown.” “Vixit Germaniae suae Decus ALBERTVS DVRERVS Artium Lumen, Sol Artificium Urbis Patr.

Magnet of Magnates, grindstone for talents, After one hundred fifty years No one having been equal to him He must repose here alone. Traveller, strew flowers. In the year of Salvation 1681 J.D S.” In lamenting that the artist must “repose here alone,” Sandrart, who had moved to Nuremberg only in 1674, presumably was unaware that Albrecht Dürer no longer reposed there at all; his grave had been cleared of its original contents after 1550, by which time both his own family and that of his wife Agnes Frey Dürer had died out, and had subsequently been recycled to hold the remains of various assorted clergymen from Nuremberg’s Heilig-Geist-Spital. In any case, Sandrart donated the renovated tomb to Nuremberg’s newly founded Academy of Art—Germany’s first such institution. (The grave was destined to be opened yet again in 1811—this time in the name of phrenology, in the hope of retrieving his skull as palpable evidence of his genius. Regrettably, however, the tomb yielded up only a recently deceased engraver named Bärenstecher and a heap of miscellaneous skulls of assorted sizes, and so was quietly closed up again.) Sandrart, who was familiar with the collections of Maximilian and that assembled by Rudolph II among others, devoted an entire chapter of his Teutsche Academie to Dürer, whom he considered one of the founding fathers (with Michael Wolgemut, Martin Schongauer, and Israel van Meckenem) of German art, and included in his book a “portrait” of the artist engraved by Philipp Kilian after his (Sandrart’s) own design. His commentary on Dürer’s life owes much to Van Mander, Vasari, and Ridolfi, but his first hand knowledge of the oeuvre is\n\nALBRECHT DÜRER (1471–1528) IN GERMAN HISTORY 9\n\nquite extensive. He also was the first to publish the Family Chronicle that Dürer had written in 1524, using his father’s notes. Although he was highly respected everywhere for his moral probity and his theoretical publications, Dürer’s reputation as a painter was never as high in France and England as in Germany. Roger de Piles (1635– 1709), himself a painter/engraver/theoretician, championed color as superior to line, and awarded Dürer a niggardly eight for composition on a scale of one to twenty; tens for both drawing and color; and an eight for “expression” (or roughly the same scores as he gave to Michelangelo).34 Dürer was, however, one of only two German artists whom he thought worth rating at all, the other being Hans Holbein. As the two hundredth anniversary of the artist’s death approached, Henrich Conrad Arend (1692–1738), a Lutheran pastor in the Harz mountain village of Grund bei Clausthal, published Das Gedächtnis der Ehren Albrecht Dürers (1728: Goslar, Johann Christoph König), the first monograph on Dürer, It was dedicated to Ludwig Rudolph, Duke of Braunschweig and Lüneburg, whose father, Anton Ulrich, had amassed a major collection of Dürer’s prints.35 Although his biographical chapters owe much to the literature already in print, Arend had made a great effort, with the limited means of a pastor, to see as many original works by Dürer as possible. These, naturally, were prints and drawings, some of which he had painstakingly copied, since the great princely (and Catholic) collections of paintings and watercolors were not open to him. In 1778 Goethe’s friend Heinrich Sebastian Hüsgen (1745–1807), the current owner not only of the famous lock of Dürer’s hair, but of an important collection of his works on paper (101 engravings plus the great woodcut books and seventy of the single-sheets), compiled the first catalogue raisonné of the prints.36 This was to be tremendously influential, and would remain the definitive work until the publication of the seventh volume of Adam Bartsch’s Le peintre-graveur (Vienna, 1808) and Joseph Heller’s Das Leben und die Werke Albrecht Dürers, in two volumes (Bamberg: E.F.Kunz, 1827). Arend’s monograph was followed in 1779 by Christoph Gottlieb von Murr’s publication of Dürer’s Netherlandish travel diary, and later by his edition of the letters from Venice to Pirckheimer (1748).37 Three years earlier he had recognized and described Dürer’s iron etchings in his Journal zur Kunstgeschichte und zur allgemeinen Literatur. The eighteenth century also produced Johann Heinrich Merck’s “Einige Rettungen für das Andenken Albrecht Dürers gegen die Sage der Kunstliteratur” (Some Attempts to Rescue Dürer’s Memory from the Legend Created by Art Literature), in Wieland’s Der Teutsche Merkur, 3 (1780), 3ff.), a serious attempt to define the artist’s style. Merck (1741–1791), who belonged to the circle of Goethe, Herder, and Wieland, was one of the first to draw distinctions between genuine Dürer prints and the many copies and forgeries in circulation; he was employed in Weimar by Duke Carl August and Duchess Ana Amalia as purchasing agent for their collection of prints and drawings. Merck also made the distinction between features of Dürer’s personal style and those common to the\n\n10 ALBRECHT DÜRER: A GUIDE TO RESEARCH\n\nperiod in which he worked, pointing out also that there are various traditions and local schools, none of which should be judged better or worse than any other. Wilhelm Heinse’s (1746–1803) fictitious Ardinghello,38 the first artist to be featured as the hero of a novel, was eloquent in the praise of Dürer, and also endorsed the idea that “every Folk and every climate has its own beauty.” Stopping in Nuremberg on his way from Weimar to Italy, Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) wrote enthusiastically to his wife about the works by Dürer that he had seen there (which included the copies of the Four Apostles by Georg Gaertner and that of the Adam and Eve by Juveneel).39 Johann Kaspar Lavater (1741–1801), the Zurich pastor whose essay on physiognomy as an index to character and genius led to the abortive attempt to recover Dürer’s skull for posterity (1811), devoted special praise to the Four Apostles, which he erroneously assumed to have been commissioned as an altarpiece “for a great church or a rich cloister.”40 Goethe, whose publications contain many references to Dürer throughout his career, had high praise for Dürer’s “wood-carved manliness” as antidote for the artificiality of his French Rococo contemporaries. Perhaps most poignant, however, was his identification with Dürer’s situation as a German in Italy during his own first Italian journey (1786–1788), which he undertook with Christoph Gottlieb von Murr’s editions of Dürer’s travel diary (1779) and letters from Venice (1781) in hand.41 Goethe, in self-imposed exile from Weimar politics, felt a kinship with Dürer, who had so reveled in being treated as a gentleman in Venice and Bologna, feeling himself insufficiently appreciated at home in Germany. The liberal publicist Christian Daniel Schubart (1739–1791), who had been driven out of Augsburg by the Jesuits, recalled in his memoirs written in prison in the Hohen Asperg that as a schoolboy he had wept at the grave of Dürer, and elsewhere cited him as the father of German painting, who had been guided only by his own genius and not by study of the Antique. Calling him “the Michelangelo of the Germans,” he credited Dürer with having invented the arts of woodcut and engraving, and also with having written books.42 Nuremberg had always been a mecca for travelers, as it lay at the center of the Holy Roman Empire at the crossroads of the great trade routes from north, south, east, and west, but the late eighteenth century brought visitors for cultural more than commercial reasons. Most momentous among them were the young Wilhelm Wackenroder (1773– 1798) and his friend Ludwig Tieck (1773–1853), who, apparently having neglected to fortify themselves with any of the three eighteenth-century monographs on Dürer and unaware of the vogue among the Strassburg Stürmer und Dränger for collecting his graphic art, were responsible for spreading the extraordinary notion that Albrecht Dürer had been forgotten.43 Wackenroder’s Ehrengedächtnisz unsres ehrwürdigen Ahnherrn Albrecht Dürers von einem kunstliebenden Klosterbruder44 and the more widely circulated Herzensergiessungen eines kunstliebenden Klosterbruders (Berlin, 1797) changed the view of Dürer from that of an artist who, if he had only been born in Italy could have been truly great, to that of an artist truly great precisely\n\nALBRECHT DÜRER (1471–1528) IN GERMAN HISTORY 11\n\nbecause he was German. Wackenroder’s Dürer also was the teacher of the title character in Tieck’s Franz Sternbalds Wanderungen (1798). Johann Domenico Fiorillo (1748– 1821) published the first volume of his monumental Geschichte der zeichnenden Künste in Deutschland und den Vereinigten Niederlanden in the same year, with the help of his friend Wilhelm Schlegel. Dürer, who appears in volume two (Hannover, 1817), receives high praise indeed. Tieck and the Schlegel brothers were prominent among the sponsors of the Romantic movement, a development that the post-Italian Goethe deplored for its crypto-Catholic and “klosterbruderisierende, sternbaldisierende Unwesen.” But for Friedrich Schlegel, Dürer was “the Shakespeare, or, if you prefer, the Jakob Böhrne of painting.”45 His brother August Wilhelm was the first to note the artist’s transitional position, his art “in einem katholischen Gemüt geboren… wiewohl er selbst Luthers Unternehmungen zugetan war…” but also spread abroad Pirckheimer’s opinion that Agnes Dürer’s greed had caused her husband to die of over-work.46 DÜRERFEIERN: THE CELEBRATED ALBRECHT DÜRER The failure of the War for Independence (1813–1815), when the Congress of Vienna had dashed the hopes of German liberals for autonomous government after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, was a contributing factor in the establishment of the custom of celebrating birth and death anniversaries of Germany’s cultural heroes, a practice that still endures. In part, too, these celebrations helped to compensate for the secularization of the calendar, with its resultant loss of many religious holidays. An annual Albrecht Dürer Day, like the feast day of a saint, was observed by German artists from 1815 until the end of the nineteenth century, with tri-through quincentennial celebrations of his birth and death dates reaching national and even international proportions. Although anniversary observances also would be held in memory of Luther, Goethe, Schiller, and others, Dürer was the eldest hero to be so honored. His Christ like Self Portrait of 1500 (Munich), and the existence of such material remains as his house, tomb, and lock of hair lent themselves admirably to the establishment of his cult—the logical consequence of Wackenroder’s sacramental view of art. It was the expatriate Nazarenes who held the first Dürerfeier, in Peter Cornelius’s room in their headquarters at the former monastery of San Isidoro in Rome (May 20, 1815). The affair, which had been suggested by the newest member of the brotherhood, and its one veteran of the War of Independence, J.E.Scheffer von Leonhardshoff, is fully described in a letter from Friedrich Overbeck to Joseph Sutter, dated July 17. The ceremony took place in front of a portrait of the artist (apparently an engraving), which was surrounded by a thick oak wreath—one of the most familiar symbols of the War for Independence. Inserted into the wreath were the tools of the various arts that Dürer practiced,\n\n12 ALBRECHT DÜRER: A GUIDE TO RESEARCH\n\nand on a table below the arrangement lay “the best of his engravings and woodcuts that we all had collected.” One of their number read from a biography of the artist “to the great joy and edification of all.” Then, “to the tinkle of glasses,” they resolved to celebrate the occasion every year, to “kindle inspiration in German hearts anew…as well as to stimulate a new German art.”47 Establishment of “a new German art,” of course, was exactly the cause to which Dürer had devoted a singularly generous proportion of his working life. Far from keeping his own hard-won knowledge of Renaissance perspective and human proportion to himself, he set out to publish this material in German to make it readily available to younger artists both present and future. Although the Tyrolean artist Michael Pacher clearly had mastered linear perspective while Dürer was still a child, he kept the secret within his own workshop in Bruneck, and it followed him to the grave in 1498. Leon Battista Alberti, who died in 1472 when Dürer was one year old, had written the first modern treatise on painting as early as 1436. It was circulated only in manuscript form to a limited circle of readers even after the invention of printing from movable type, however, and was published only in 1540, when Dürer’s theoretical works had already been on the market for a dozen years. Dürer’s Unterweysung der Messung and Vier Bücher von menschlicher Proportion (both Nuremberg, Hieronymus Andreae), which appeared in 1525 and 1528 respectively, were the first such works published in the vernacular, and the original German editions were quickly republished in French, Italian, English and Spanish translations. (An unpublished Portuguese translation also was made.) Alberti’s information on color in the De pictura was inaccurate from the start, since the author was a dilettante rather than a painter, and his mathematics became outdated rather quickly, but Dürer’s publications simply gained in interest for such later mathematicians as Johannes Kepler, because some of the constructions he included were not treated elsewhere in the professional literature of geometry.48 Dürer had probably been inspired by the pioneering mathematical publications of Matthäus Roriczer (1486 and ca.1498), who in his youth had worked on the church of St. Lorenz in Nuremberg and had been the first to make public the secret knowledge of the Bauhütte.49 After 1509, of course, Dürer had become the neighbor and friend of the priest at St. John’s Church, Johannes Werner (1468–1522), the mathematician who pioneered the study of conic sections, who wrote his groundbreaking treatise on the subject between 1514 and 1522, using the scientific library of his former mentor, the astronomer Bernhard Walther, which was still shelved in Walther’s house after Dürer purchased it in 1509. The equivalent of a modern research institute, this library, which had been bequeathed to the city of Nuremberg, remained open to the scientific community until 1523, when the city fathers decided to liquidate the collection.50 A feature of Dürer’s uniqueness is the affection with which he has been viewed by generation after generation of younger artists. This has more to do with his sense of mission and civic responsibility than even with his remarkable\n\nALBRECHT DÜRER (1471–1528) IN GERMAN HISTORY 13\n\ntechnical skill. His generosity of spirit and commitment to the future education and well-being of young German apprentices, and thereby to the betterment of Germany’s cultural reputation is made clear in the dedication page from the 1525 edition of The Manual of Measurement. In it he points to the art of measurement, or proportion, as “the foundation of all painting,” and criticizes the current apprenticeship system as “without real foundation other than what they learn by daily usage.” Realizing that this is the fault of the master painters rather than of the apprentices themselves, he declares that he has “decided to provide to all those who are eager to become artists a starting point and a source for learning about measurement with ruler and compass…” His unpublished notes for a further book, to be titled Speiss für Malerknaben (Food for Young Painters), reveal that he had planned to give advice on treating apprentices with kindness so that they would “retain the pleasure of learning,” placing them in “pleasant and quiet living quarters,” and providing for medical help and musical antidotes to melancholy as needed.51 His concern for the welfare of young artists bore fruit when, as part of the celebration of the three hundredth anniversary of his death (1828), the first museum devoted entirely to modern art was founded in Nuremberg, and has occasioned the exhibition of works by living artists created in his honor as a regular feature of Dürer festivals in Germany. Dürer’s house by the Tiergartner Tor, now maintained as a museum, owns a large and growing collection of such works.52 Dürer was the first, as well as the eldest, artist to have a publicly subscribed monument featuring a full-length portrait erected in his honor (Christian Daniel Rauch’s bronze, commissioned in 1828 for the rechristened Albrecht-Dürer-Platz in Nuremberg.) He also was the first northern artist whose house and tomb were restored in the name of historic preservation. And he is certainly the only artist to have been honored by art historians with his own eponymous epoch—the Dürerzeit—and to have undergone a personal Renaissance fifty years after his death.53 He clearly holds the world record for the number of societies, Bündes, and Vereine named in his honor.54 He became a cult object for the Romantic age, when his Melencolia I was particularly popular in England and France, serving as a source of inspiration for William Blake, Alexander Pope, James Thompson, Theophile Gauthier, Victor Hugo, and Gérard de Nerval, among others.55 In Germany, however, the Knight, Death, and Devil became much more famous, and had more sinister offspring in the writings of Friedrich de la Motte-Fouqué,56 Friedrich Nietzsche,57 Ernst Bertram,58 and Momme Nissen (“Dürer als Führer,” in Der Kunstwart 17 (1904), 93ff.). A peculiarly saber-rattling Dürer had already begun to emerge with the Prussian victory over the French at Sedan in 1871, when the cultural hero was dubbed “the most German of German artists,” and the corollary to this Second Reich Dürer included anti-German sentiments that were to linger in western Europe following both world wars. Dürer Year 1928, however, thanks to the Spirit of Locarno and to the efforts of Nuremberg’s liberal Mayor, Hermann Luppe, produced in Nuremberg’s\n\n14 ALBRECHT DÜRER: A GUIDE TO RESEARCH\n\nGermanisches Nationalmuseum the first exhibition of international importance ever to be held in a German museum—and one of the world’s first monographic exhibitions—reuniting for the first time many of the artist’s important paintings and drawings that had found their way to foreign countries. The exhibition presented unprecedented problems in security and insurance, but brought a record two hundred thousand visitors to the city. Heinrich Wölfflin gave the festival address, and Hans Wolfgang Singer compiled and published a complete bibliography of the literature to date. The Hungarian roots of Albrecht Dürer the Elder were acknowledged with an Albrecht Dürer Ostpolitik, with festivals and a historic marker in Gyula and a Hungarian Order of Merit for Luppe. The yearlong celebration in Nuremberg temporarily overshadowed those of the reactionary Deutsche Tag of 1923, with its militaristic parades of S.A. (Nazi Storm Troopers) and Stahlhelm (veterans of World War I), as well as the National Socialist Party Congress of 1927. Within five years, however, in 1933, Mayor Luppe was placed under arrest by the Nazi Gauleiter Julius Streicher, who brought notoriety to the city with the promulgation of the anti-Semitic Nuremberg Decrees. Albrecht Dürer, despite his father’s Hungarian origins, was deemed so racially pure that he literally became the poster boy for Aryanism when his 1493 Self Portrait (Paris, Louvre) was featured on the cover of the Nazi magazine Volk und Rasse (February 1942). No centenary of his birth or death fell during the twelve years of the Thousand Year Reich, however, and even his annual spring days of remembrance were supplanted by the celebrations of Adolf Hitler’s birthday (April 20), and by the annual Nazi Party rallies held on Nuremberg’s mammoth new parade ground. Hitler’s attempt to legitimate his regime by restoring Nuremberg as the center of the Reich included even the return of the Imperial regalia from Vienna to “the most German of German cities.” It was in this role that Nuremberg was described in an R.A.F. Bomber Command report of 1943 as “a political target of the first importance, and one of the Holy Cities of the Nazi creed,” and that it was marked for destruction by Air Chief Marshall Sir Arthur Harris in the raids of 1944 and 1945, in which the aiming point was the medieval city rather than the industrial suburbs. It was also in this capacity that Nuremberg was selected as the site of the war criminals’ trials of 1945–1946. Although both his boyhood home and the workshop of his teacher, Michael Wolgemut, had been destroyed, and with them the City Hall with Dürer’s murals, and although Dürer’s large house by the Tiergartner Tor had sustained serious structural damage, his portrait statue and his erstwhile tomb still stood. His artistic reputation, however, had begun to erode under the excessive admiration of the Nazis. Adolf Hitler, who as a would-be art student had once in his Vienna days, painstakingly copied a reproduction of Dürer’s Pond House watercolor, was known to have a special fondness for “the most German of all German artists,” with the result that copies and forgeries of the Knight, Death, and Devil were at an all-time high. The gigantic painting by the Tyrolean fascist Hubert Lanzinger of the Führer himself on horseback, dressed in silver armor\n\nALBRECHT DÜRER (1471–1528) IN GERMAN HISTORY 15\n\nand carrying the swastika banner had hung over Albert Speer’s desk. Most damaging of all, however, was the fact that Dürer, Lukas Cranach, and Albrecht Altdorfer—often only in reproduction—had been pressed into service to fill the void when German museums were stripped of their “degenerate” works of art in 1937. In the spirit of the tastemakers of the early twentieth-century Dürerbund, the Nazi women’s magazine N.S. Frauenwarte in that year published a list of 122 “approved” works by fifty-three artists that were considered apppriate for domestic decoration: One fourth of them were by Albrecht Dürer. The 1930s did produce serious connoisseurship in Friedrich Winkler’s indispensable catalogue of the drawings,59 and Joseph Meder’s catalogue of the prints taking the posthumous editions into account,60 but the Dürer monograph of the Third Reich, by Wilhelm Waetzoldt,61 retained the bellicose rhetoric and xenophobic air that pervaded German society during these years. The antidote for this Dürer was the enduring two-volume Albrecht Dürer (Princeton, 1948), written by Erwin Panofsky, which disclosed the humanistic aspects of Dürer and his art, as well as the artist’s debt to Italian culture, and that has remained the staple “life and art” book on the artist for English speakers from that day to the end of the twentieth century. It was finally translated into German in 1977. The 1950s produced two invaluable documentary works, the first volume of Hans Rupprich’s Dürer: Schriftlicher Nachlass (Berlin, 1956), the definitive edition of the artist’s own writings and of original sources mentioning him; and Dürer und die Nachwelt, a selection of readings illustrating the reception of Dürer from Jakob Wimpfeling to Thomas Mann, edited by two East German scholars, Heinz Lüdecke and Susanne Heiland (Berlin, 1955). Dürer’s five hundredth birthday occured 1971, in the teeth of the postwar craze for op, pop, and concept art, blue jeans, happenings, student rebellion, and counterculture, and was commemorated in reconstructed Nuremberg with the lengthiest and most expensive anniversary festival in history. Three years and six million marks in the planning, it began with an “Advent” ceremony in December 1970, on Willibald Pirckheimer’s birthday, and featured the most splendid Dürer exhibition ever held. To compensate for the loss of the city’s architectural heritage, and for the continuing presence of the American army of occupation after one quarter of a century, there was a new emphasis on the reception of Dürer over time, with a total of seventeen satellite exhibitions in Nuremberg’s other museums and exhibition halls in addition to the main one in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum featuring Dürer’s own works and family documents. One of the most delightful was the international invitational exhibition of works by modern artists created to honor Dürer, which featured entries by such artists as Picasso, Marino Marini, Graham Sutherland, Ferdinand Botero, Salvador Dali, Max Bill, Otto Dix, and Joseph Albers. Another, sponsored appropriately by the firm of Faber-Castell, displayed the work of younger artists who had received grants to retrace one or more of Dürer’s travels.62\n\n16 ALBRECHT DÜRER: A GUIDE TO RESEARCH\n\nAs had been the case with past centenary celebrations, the five hundredth birth anniversary provided a stimulus for extensive new scholarship, the most important items being the catalogue of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum’s exhibition, Albrecht Dürer 1471–1971, with its essays by prominent scholars in the field, the first edition of a new catalogue raisonné of the paintings, by Fedja Anzelewsky, and the splendid Dürer-Bibliographie edited by Matthias Mende, carefully cross-indexed for a total often thousand references. Monographic Dürer exhibitions—largely of prints and drawings—also were held for the first time in the principal museums of Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Advances in research made possible by the Nuremberg catalogue and Mende’s bibliography have continued to appear. Matthias Mende’s many innovative studies have included a superb facsimile edition of the woodcuts accompanied by a revisionist essay pointing up the extreme unlikelihood of Dürer’s having cut his own woodblocks (pace William Ivins), and also has contributed definitive works on the Dürer house and the Nuremberg City Hall, among much else of value. Walter Strauss’s many volumes on the prints and drawings, some of which have been quite controversial, have had the virtue of inclusiveness, containing reproductions of some works that were unknown to Winkler or were rejected by him. Anzelewsky has published both a useful “life and art” book and a new edition of the catalogue of paintings.63 Peter Strieder, the emeritus Director of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, has published both an excellent “life and art” book and a much-needed volume on Nuremberg panel painting.64 The late Jan Bialostocki’s Dürer and His Critics (Baden-Baden: Koerner, 1986) is indispensible for its overview of the artist’s reputation, complete with generous quotations from many works difficult of access. My own biography of the artist (1990) and that by Ernst Rebel (1986) attempt to deal with his life in terms of the documentary evidence, in order better to portray Dürer’s situation among Nuremberg’s humanists and artisans as well as his relationship to Luther and his circle. There are important new studies of the Dürer watercolors (Fritz Koreny’s Vienna, 1985 exhibition catalogue); of the altarpieces (Doris Kutschbach’s dissertation, Stuttgart/Zurich, 1995); of the important early collections of the artist’s work, particularly those on the Praun collection (Katrin AchillesSyndram; Nuremberg, 1994, and elsewhere). The watercolors missing from the Bremen Kunsthalle since World War II have been disclosed as residing in Russia.65 One of the most important publications since 1971, however, is the catalogue of the 1998 exhibition in Munich, displaying the three restored altarpieces that had been damaged by acid ten years earlier. They were displayed with all of the Bavarian Dürers, together with the complete laboratory reports on the stages of stabilization and restoration undertaken by Munich’s team of conservators, and with valuable essays by Gisela Goldberg, Bruno Heimburg and Martin Schawe.66\n\nALBRECHT DÜRER (1471–1528) IN GERMAN HISTORY 17\n\nNOTES 1.

Achilles, Katrin. “Naturstudien von Hans Hoffmann in der Kunstsammlung des Nürnberger Kaufmanns Paulus II Praun.” Jahrbuch der Kunsthistorischen Sammlungen in Wien 82/83 (1986): 243–259.\n\nOne of the papers presented at the Albertina symposium (see Koreny 1986/87). Hoffmann’s and Georg Hoefnagel’s copies after Albrecht Dürer have survived— and, it is to be hoped, have been identified—in fairly large numbers, unlike those by Georg Gärtner, Jobst Harrich, or Paul Juvenal. When the Nuremberg collector Paulus Praun died in Bologna (1591) his younger brother Jakob made an inventory of his collection prior to shipping it home to Nuremberg, where Paulus had planned to create “Museumsräume” in the new house he was having built. (In the event, the works were never unpacked until the collection was sold after its owner’s death.) The author, who is the recognized authority on the Praun collection, discusses Paulus Praun’s will and Jakob’s inventory, which reveal ownership of thirty-five works by Hoffmann. Watercolors included a seated grayhound, lions, and dead blue roller— an album of Hoffmann’s work. Achilles traces the subsequent history of the Hoffmann volume, citing von Murr’s inventory (1797), made before the collection was consigned to the Nuremberg art dealer Frauenholz (sale closed 1801). After 1804 many of the Praun drawings, including most of the Hoffmanns, were acquired by Prince Miklós Esterházy and are now in the Budapest Museum. Achilles has identified as many of the Hoffmanns as possible (twenty-two) using the descriptions and measurements from the three inventories (including Esterházy’s). A useful list of previous literature on Hoffmann appears in Note 1 in this work. 2. Achilles-Syndram, Katrin. Die Kunstsammlung des Paulus Praun.

Meisterwerke von Dürer bis Carracci) was to have had a supplement containing the full transcription of the two inventories. Due to lack of funds it could not be printed\n\n22 ALBRECHT DÜRER: A GUIDE TO RESEARCH\n\nin that form, but was produced as a cooperative undertaking by the Museum and the Stadtarchiv, which possesses the original inventories.

Nuremberg: Verlag des Germanischen Nationalmuseums , 1994.\n\nExamines the significance of Praun’s drawing collection, which, in addition to its prime Northern works, included fine drawings by Bolognese and Emilian artists, in the context of the history of such collections, which are contrasted to the older “kunst- und wunderkammern.” The principles and procedures of Rudolf II, as well as of bourgeois collectors such as Basilius Amerbach (1533– 1591), and of the artist/theoretician Giorgio Vasari are discussed in this connection, and original correspondence between Rudolf II and Paulus Praun is cited. 5. Acton, David. “The Northern Masters in Goltzius’s Meisterstiche.” Bulletin, Museums of Art and Archaeology, University of Michigan 4 (1981):40–53.\n\nDiscusses Goltzius’s motivation in engraving the Circumcision in the style of Dürer and the Adoration of the Magi in the style of Lucas van Leyden—two of his so-called Meisterstiche from the series done in 1594, suggesting that together the two prints illustrate “the sensibilities of self-appraisal and artistic proclamation” that were the inspiration for the series. Examines the Dutch artist’s response to Dürer and Lucas in the context of his knowledge of the Italian masters, arguing that in imitating Dürer and Lucas, Goltzius was transferring behavior that he had observed as part of the Mannerist movement during his travels in Italy to the north. 6. Ahlborn, Joachim. Die Familie Landauer, Vom Maler zum Montanherrn, Nürnberger Forschungen, Einzelarbeiten zur Nürnberger Geschichte, 11. Nuremberg: 1969.\n\nANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY 23\n\nA detailed and excellent study of the family of Matthias Landauer, the patron of Dürer’s Adoration of the Trinity altarpiece of 1511, and founder of the retirement home and chapel for which the work was designed. The Landauers had progressed from the craftsman class in the early decades of the fifteenth century (Berthold, Matthäus’ grandfather, the first Landauer mentioned in Nuremberg archives was a painter), to the patrician (ehrbar) class within one generation. His sons Matthäus and Markus engaged in international trade—the prereqisite for elevation to the ruling class—and Matthäus the Younger, Dürer’s client was the owner of a metal refinery in Thuringia. His establishment of a retirement home for twelve elderly, unmarried men carried certain less than altruistic restrictions: no blind, lame, bedridden or mentally disturbed old men were allowed, and no beggars or property less need apply; those fortunate enough to be admitted must bathe every three weeks. Also discussed in this volume are other Landauer commissions, including Adam Kraft’s SchreyerLandauer monument in St. Sebald’s church. 7. Akinsha, Konstantin, and Grigorii Koslov. Beautiful Loot: The Soviet Plunder of Europe’s Art Treasures, New York: Random House, 1995.\n\nAkinsha is a Ukrainian art historian formerly on the staff of the Museum of Western and Oriental Art in Kiev; Kozlov was an official in the Department of Museums of the Ministry of Culture of the former USSR. Although there are many published accounts of the rape of western European collections of old master artworks by agents of the Third Reich, this important piece of investigative journalism published with the aid of Sylvia Hochfeld, an editor at large for ARTnews is the only reliable account of the secret Soviet “trophy brigades” (operative from 1945 to 1948) acting under specific instructions from Stalin to remove artworks from Germany for shipment to the USSR. The looted works include the collection of Dürer watercolors and the Salvator Mundi painting from the Bremen Kunsthalle. The drawings have been returned to the German Embassy in Moscow, but at the time of writing have still been barred by the Russian government from leaving the country. 8. Allihn, Max. “Dürer-Studien.

Von Stadt der Reichstage zum Stadt der Reichsparteitage, Eine Schau in Schriften, Urkunden, Bildern und Kunstwerken, Nuremberg: 1937.\n\nCatalogue of an exhibition held in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum celebrating Nuremberg’s role as the quintessential German city, from its onetime role as meeting place of the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire to its position during the Third Reich as locus of the annual rallies of the Nazi Party. Items by Dürer that were high-lighted included the artist’s idealized portraits of Charlemagne, the first Holy Roman Emperor, and of subsequent emperors Sigismund and Maximilian I; his portrait of his teacher, the Nuremberg artist/ entrepreneur, Michael Wolgemut, and his drawings for a pokal and a chandelier in the form of a dragon. The point of all this was, of course, an attempt to legitimize the Nazi regime by portraying it as the successor to the Holy Roman Empire. The exhibition was scheduled in order to coincide with the Nazi rally of 1937. (It should be recalled that the “Nuremberg Laws” calling for racial purity had been officially announced by Julius Streicher in the previous year, and that this exhibition coincides with the 1937 cleansing of German museums of all works of so-called degenerate art). 11. Andersson, Christiane. “The censorship of images in Nuremberg 1521–1527.” Dürer and His Culture, 164–178. Eds. Dagmar Eichberger and Charles Zika. Cambridge/ New York/Melbourne: Cambridge University Press,\n\nAndersson is the Samuel H.Kress Professor of Art History at Bucknell University. Although she does not deal directly with Dürer, this essay is of interest as general background for the last years of the artist’s life, as the Imperial Free City of Nuremberg attempted to deal with rising sympathies for Luther’s reforms without giving unnecessary offense to Charles V after the Edict of Worms. Under the terms of the Edict, all antipapal texts and images were to be burned, holding author, artist, and printer equally guilty. In Nuremberg, the City Council also decreed that the of-fending woodblocks would be confiscated, and the guilty were to be penalized either by heavy fines, or, in some cases, exclusion from the printing profession. Andersson shows that these punish-ments were often either commuted or ameliorated in some way. Among the items banned by the Edict were all likenesses of Luther; in Nuremberg this was moderated simply to forbid sale of portraits of Luther “with the Holy Spirit” (March 3, 1521), a stric-ture that was apparently ignored after 1525 in Nuremberg, where Lazarus Spengler is presumed to have been the local censor.

His catalogue raisonné of Dürer’s paintings published during Dürer Year 1971 has won acceptance—\n\n26 ALBRECHT DÜRER: A GUIDE TO RESEARCH\n\nsome of it grudging—as the standard catalogue. Superseded by the 2nd revised edition (1991), q.v. Beginning with a useful overview of the connoisseurship of the past, Anzelewsky included an extensive chronological survey of the paintings, as well as essays on iconography, technique, and materials, collectors, copyists, and imitators, ending with the catalogue raisonné of the complete works. In reconstructing the artist’s early work, several new items were admitted to the oeuvre that did not find complete acceptance. (See the reviews by Dieter Kuhrmann, in Kunstchronik 1973; John Rowlands, in Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte 36 (1973), 209–213, and especially those by Wolfgang Stechow in The An Bulletin, 56 (1974) 2, 259–263; and Gisela Goldberg in Pantheon, 30 (1972), 518–520. Also reviewed by Walter L.Strauss in Art Journal, 34 no. 4 (Summer 1975), 374–376.) Anzelewsky rejected Kurt Bauch’s attribution of the painting (now in Frankfurt) of the Raising of the Cross, and Friedländer’s attribution of the anonymous Upper Rhenish work known as the Weber diptych (Berlin). He accepted Alfred Stange’s attribution of the Miracle of the Drowned Boy from Bregenz and Basel’s Adoration of the Magi; Karlsruhe’s Man of Sorrows, which he dates to 1493–1494; and the Penitent St. Jerome, the Madonna of Bagnacavallo. 16. ——. Albrecht Dürer. Das Malerische Werk, 2, revised ed. 2 vols. Berlin: Deutscher Verlag für Kunstwissenschaft, 1991.\n\nReplaces the 1971 one-volume edition (long out of print) as the new standard catalogue of Dürer’s paintings. Completely revised and updated by the author, the retired director of the Berlin print room (1977–1984), who also taught at the Free University. Takes into consideration the new scholarship produced since 1971. Volume 1 is text; Volume 2 illustrates in color each of the surviving paintings accepted by the author as autograph works, in some cases accompanied by black-and-white details. The general organization of the text volume is the same as in 1971: an analysis of Dürer as painter; a biographical section; sacred and secular iconography; technique and materials; reception by collectors and copyists; catalogue raisonne. Included in this last section are works known only through copies (marked K) as well as works that survive only in literary descriptions (V); works presumably lost but implied by the existence of drawings (Z), and workshop productions (W). Additions to the oeuvre include a copy of a possible lost self portrait at the age of thirteen, formerly in the Stettin Museum (now Szceczin); and Lotte Brand Philip’s identification of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum’s portrait of a woman as Dürer’s mother, reproduced with the combined arms of the Dürer and Helper families from the back of the panel. Alfred Stange’s attribution of the votive Miracle of the Drowned Boy of Bregenz (Kreuzlingen) is still accepted as a work from the bachelor’s journey. A convenient handlist of works, arranged according to location, is found on pages 308–312.\n\nANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY 27\n\n17. —— “Der Jabach Altar.” Dürer-Studien.

Anzelewsky views the usual catch phrase “aesthetic digression” as misleading, because it gives the erroneous impression that this material was not an integral part of Dürer’s theory. Also he notes, correctly, that the use of the term “aesthetic” is an anachronism. Dürer saw the need for dealing with a variety of\n\n28 ALBRECHT DÜRER: A GUIDE TO RESEARCH\n\nhuman physical types on the basis of the information on the four “humors” or temperaments known from ancient medical literature. By 1507, during the time of his return to Italy, he had come to the conclusion that no ideal set of proportions exists in nature, noting that Apollo and Hercules, for example, had different body types. His ideas on human proportion are grounded in observation of nature, and in late Occamist thought, as opposed to Italian principles. This permitted him to be interested in the odd (bearded child, for example) as well as in the beautiful. 23. ——. “Dürers Selbstbildnis aus dem Jahre 1500.” Ars Auro Prior. Studia Joanni Bialostocki Sexagenario Dicata, 287–290. Warsaw: 1981.\n\nIn this festschrift volume presented to the late Polish authority on Dürer (and on much else), Jan Bialostocki, Anzelewsky notes that Justi had been the first to recognize the use of a proportion scheme in the famous 1500 Self Portrait (Munich)—an idea that earlier would have been viewed as somewhat blasphemous. Panofsky then enlarged upon the Christological iconography of the painting, which he cast in the spirit of the Imitatio Christi—an idea endorsed by the Reformation historian Roland Bainton, who connected it with Franciscan mysticism. This article offers a useful review of the literature up to 1980, and cites Nicholas of Cusa and Bonaventura on human creativity; Pico della Mirandola on human stature in comparison to divinity; Pico’s thoughts on free will; and Bialostocki’s own article on the eye as “window of the soul” (q.v.). The author’s thesis is that Dürer no longer regarded himself as a private person here, but rather as Man created by God in His own image—a thesis that would resonate with the use of the unusual verb effingebat to call attention to the fact that the image had been painted with “undying” (permanent) colors. Quotes Dürer’s own 1513 remark: “Den wir werden durch kunst der gottlichen gepildnus destmer vergleicht.” 24.\n\n——. Dürer-Studien. Untersuchungen zu den ikonographischen und geistesgeschichtlichen Grundlagen seiner Werke zwischen de beiden Italienreisen, Berlin: 1983,\n\nA series of speculative and detailed essays on the background and iconography of eleven selected works (eight prints, two paintings, one drawing) done between the artist’s two trips to Italy (1494/1495 and 1505–1507.) Discusses the intellectual circle that influenced the artist during those years, and the relevant contents of Nuremberg libraries that he would have known. Among the author’s most intriguing assertions is the idea that Dürer, aware of the discovery of a Roman statue in a plowed field in Carinthia (Kärnten), may have routed his second trip via Klagenfurt rather than the Brenner Pass, and drawn the portrait of the Windish (Slovenian) Peasant Woman on his way, rather than having seen her in Venice. Also reviews the iconography of the Sea Monster (Meerwunder), recalling the story of Glaucus and Scylla, from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, and noting that the woman in the engraving wears a Milanese headdress, which might be taken for a\n\nANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY 29\n\nreference to the story of the Lombard queen Theudelinde, who was abducted by a sea monster (46). 25. ——. “Eine Gruppe von Malern und Zeichnern aus Dürers Jugendjahren.” Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen 27 (1985):35–39.\n\nDeveloped from the conference, Engraving Before Dürer, held at the Goethe Institute in Paris in 1982.

He traced the artist’s route on his bachelor’s journey via Colmar, Freiburg, Breisach, to the Bodensee, and from there via Konstanz to Basel. He rejected the Munich Young Man (1500) and the Paris Young Woman of the Fürleger Family. 29. Anzelewsky, Fedja, and Hans Mielke. Albrecht Dürer. Kritischer Katalog der Zeichnungen, Berlin: Staatliche Museen Preussischer Kulturbesitz, 1984.\n\nScholarly catalogue of the 122 drawings and watercolors by the artist that are in the Berlin print room. Notable watercolors include one of the views of Kalkreuth and the Wire-Drawing Mill at Nuremberg.

The Appendix provides a catalogue of drawings formerly attributed to Dürer. 30. Appuhn, Horst. Albrecht Dürer: Die Drei grossen Bücher, Die bibliophilen Taschenbücher, 95. Dortmund: Harenberg, 1979.\n\nCompanion to the volume on the Small Woodcut Passion by the same author, an authority on late medieval German art and iconography, this reproduces and discusses the three large woodcut books—the Apocalypse, Large Passion, and Life of Mary. They were published in book form in 1511 as devotional manuals with Latin text, and the artist often sold them or made presents of all three as a group, as he did in 1513 with the presentation copy for Provost Georg Behaim (still in Nuremberg). It was the Behaim copy that was reproduced for this reduced edition, which offers complete translatons of the Latin texts as well as commentary. 31. ——. Der Bordesholmer Altar und die andere Werke von Hans Brüggemann, Königstein im Taunus: Langewiesche, 1983.\n\nDiscusses the influence of Dürer’s Small Passion (published 1511) on the style and iconography of the great oak altarpiece carved by Hans Brüggemann in 1521 for the Augustinian abbey church in Bordesholm (now located, since 1666, in the apse of St. Peter’s, Schleswig). 32. ——.

Arend, Heinrich Conrad. Das Gedächtnis der Ehren Albrecht Dürers, Goslar: Johann Christian König, 1728.\n\n[Remembrance of the Character of Albrecht Dürer.] The commemorative volume, dedicated to Duke Ludwig Rudolph of Braunschweig Luneburg (1671– 1735), brought out in honor of the two hundredth anniversary of the artist’s death is now available in a photomechanically reproduced facsimile edition with a colophon by the Nuremberg scholar Matthias Mende (Unterschneidheim, Alphonse Uhl, 1978), brought out in honor of the 450th anniversary of the same event. This was the first monograph on the artist, written by a Protestant minister, thirty-six-year-old Heinrich Conrad Arend (1692–1738), who served a tiny parish in the Harz mountains, Grund bei Clausthal. An avid student of Dürer’s graphic art (but a man of insufficient social rank to have had admission to the princely collections of the artist’s paintings and watercolors), however, he had\n\nANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY 31\n\ntraveled to both Nuremberg and Wolfenbüttel, and was familiar with both the Family Chronicle and the artist’s scientific publications. 35. ——. Das Gedächtnis der Ehren Albrecht Dürers, Ed. Matthias Mende. Goslar 1728 ed. Unterschneidheim: Verlag Dr. Alfons Uhl, 1978.\n\nThis facsimile edition of Arend’s biography honoring the two hundredth death anniversary of the artist was produced in honor of the 450th anniversary of the event, using the example in the collection of the Albrecht-Dürer-Haus-Stiftung in Nuremberg. The text is reproduced in its entirety, with a short Afterword by Matthias Mende. The original work of Baroque Dürer-reception by Arend (1692– 1738) is quite rare, and was never previously reprinted, as it had been eclipsed by the work of Joseph Heller a century later. Arend, a Protestant pastor in the tiny mountain village of Grund bei Clausthal, although essentially without funds or social connections, had traveled far and wide to see Dürer’s works. As the princely collections of paintings and drawings were not available to him, he was often dependent upon copies—particularly in Nuremberg, where copies were displayed to replace the works that had been sold to such collectors as Rudolph II. Of Dürer’s personal manuscripts he knew only the Family Chronicle, which had been published by Joachim von Sandrart in his 1675 Teutsche Akademie, although he knew the artist’s own theoretical publications, as well as the graphic art, and proclaimed the “Adam and Eve” to be the artist’s most perfect engraving. 36.

Austin, TX: University of Texas Press, 1983.\n\nCatalogue of an exhibition held at the Archer M.Huntington Art Gallery at the Unversity of Texas, produced in a permanent hard-cover edition, this is a most useful reference work on Nuremberg from Dürer’s prime until the Thirty Years’ War. Engravings and pre-World War II photographs give an idea of the city’s lost splendors. An essay on the Renaissance and Reformation in the city by Guy Fitch Little introduces the work, and Smith, the arranger of the exhibition, discusses pre-Reformation and Reformation art; the effects of Humanism on the arts; Dürer as teacher; and artistic developments up to the time of the Swedish invasion. An illustrated catalogue of the works exhibited follows, and an appendix giving biographical sketches of about thirty important Nuremberg artists of the period who could not be represented in the exhibition (e.g., Veit Stoss, Peter Vischer the Elder, Adam Kraft, et al.) Lenders to the exhibition included thirty major American institutions in addition to the National Gallery of Canada and the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg.
