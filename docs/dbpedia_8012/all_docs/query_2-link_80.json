In the bad old days when fine, passionately grown, handcrafted wine represented a much smaller proportion of each German vintage, it was quite difficult to convince others of how beautiful German wine could be. The great thing now is that Germany is home to so many ambitious, quality-driven vine growers and winemakers—many, although not all of them, notably youthful, so with a long life of great achievement ahead of them. The weather has cooperated too, with German wine being one of the few and most obvious beneficiaries of climate change. Today grapes reach full ripeness, and lov-\n\n6\n\ners of German wine can now choose from delicious wines of all levels of sweetness and dryness, all shades of color, and some serious fizz too. But perhaps the most significant change, related to global warming, is geographical. Top-quality wine is now being made all over Germany, not just in the Mosel and Rheingau. Some of the most exciting bottles nowadays carry addresses that can be obscure even to the best-educated German wine lover. All the more reason, then, for a serious, fully comprehensive, and extremely detailed atlas of Germany’s vineyards—which is what you hold in your hand.\n\n—Jancis Robinson\n\nTranslator’s Note Ask a room full of wine lovers about the 1971 German wine law, and you will doubtless elicit grimaces. The law was designed in the German juridical tradition of compromise and mutual beneficence. And, like other laws before it, the compromise of 1971 spread despair as evenly as it had intended to spread success. The law notoriously expanded the boundaries of a number of wellknown vineyards without ensuring that the wine from the enlarged portions of these vineyards shared any of the qualities of wine from the original parcel. This, in addition to other missteps, discouraged vine-holders in prestigious vineyards while leaving consumers helpless to discern the quality of a wine from its label. Since 1971, groups within the German wine trade have sought to overcome the law’s shortcomings in myriad ways. This atlas—brilliantly researched and beautifully illustrated—represents one such attempt. Its three-tiered ranking system, thousands of vineyard profiles, historical portraits, varietal vignettes, detailed maps, and aweinspiring photographs together form the most ambitious attempt yet at making sense of the post-1971 German vinescape. The atlas explores regions that are too often overlooked by (or perhaps intentionally hidden from!) non-Germans, including the Ahr, Baden, Württemberg, the Taubertal, and the fascinating territories of Saxony and Saale-Unstrut in the former East Germany. Translating the atlas presented a number of challenges, many of which were unrelated to language. The Confederation of Predicate Wine Estates (VDP) reorganized its internal classification system in 2012, making portions of the original atlas obsolete. Minor revisions present (or direct readers to) the most recent and accurate information.\n\nSeveral key terms carry particular legal, regional, or historical resonance and thus have no clear or concise English translation. Two in particular— Grosslage and Einzellage—merit explanation. An Einzellage (plural Einzellagen) is a legally registered single vineyard, while a Grosslage is a legally registered assemblage of singlevineyard sites. A Grosslage designation more often than not indicates a wine of inferior quality. Learning to differentiate an Einzellage from a Grosslage requires a bit of practice (not necessarily a bad thing!). This atlas will be a priceless resource in that endeavor. One of the remarkable features of this atlas is the thoroughness with which it treats soil and geological features. Translating German geological terms proved particularly challenging, as not all of them have precise or informative English equivalents. Erring on the side of caution, we decided to retain a number of German terms, especially those pertaining to soils and rock forms that are unique to or predominantly found in Central Europe. Two examples appear frequently: Keuper, a sequence of rock strata (often dolostone, shale, and claystone) deposited during the Middle and Late Triassic periods; and Rotliegend, a sequence of rock strata, usually sandstone, dating to the early Permian age. Where necessary, we have inserted brief contextual descriptions of geological features. Readers of this atlas will benefit enormously from the tireless work of editors, designers, and advocates who thought it important to offer German wine lovers the same type of resource long available to enthusiasts of French, Italian, Spanish, and American wines. Special thanks go to Blake Edgar and Rose Vekony at the University of California Press and Erika Bűky for her unflagging care in editing.\n\n7\n\nIntroduction Producing this wine atlas was an enormous challenge for\n\neveryone involved. The atlas contains general and detailed maps of every German winegrowing region and classifies the 2,658 different German vineyards according to four quality categories: “exceptional,” “superior,” “good,” and finally the broad majority, vineyards without any special distinction. Such a stark differentiation allowed for consideration of environmental conditions while also acknowledging the human factors in the winemaking process. Vineyards can be “superior,” for example, as a result of the way they are cultivated by winegrowers or even as the result of various administrative or political advantages. Differences of this kind were accentuated by the German wine law of 1971. The intention to simplify parcel names triggered the consolidation of individual sites into larger, single-branded vineyards. The law thus enabled winegrowers to rebrand some second-class vineyards with the names of more prestigious and recognizable neighboring vineyards. At the same time, several vineyard names associated with prime parcels (however small) disappeared from use. What came about was not the successful reclassification of German vineyards but rather unprecedented disarray. Those seeking to evaluate the quality of a particular vineyard should be able to assume that all its parcels are of similar quality, no matter where each parcel might be situated in the vineyard. Since the passing of the 1971 German wine law, this is no longer the case. In many places, the authors were forced to decide whether a particularly strong or weak parcel of a vineyard played a decisive role in the overall quality ranking. To be as fair as possible, we decided that the prevailing reputation of a site would serve as the basis of the ranking. This means that several sites might be ranked low even though the vineyard’s best wines are of “exceptional” quality, because wines from the less favorable portions of the vineyard are more widely distributed and have been more influential in the marketplace. In such cases, the circumstances are precisely described in the relevant site profile, so that each decision can be put into context. The authors strongly urge that the German wine law be amended to once again permit the use of parcel identi-\n\n8\n\nfiers on labels in order to give more credibility to vineyard names. Our work on this atlas has underscored for us the merits of impartially classifying all pertinent top-quality vineyard parcels rather than recognizing only the current bloated, oversized vineyards. Only in this way can the character of each site be preserved, allowing us to approach German wine with a view that is cultural and sustainable rather than transient and economically shortsighted. Our four-class hierarchy is based on the model of Burgundy. There, the top tier of production is designated grand cru. Like the grands crus of Burgundy, the “exceptional” vineyards in this atlas offer outstanding wines with distinctive, consistent qualities. Among the required characteristics are great balance, the potential for cellaring, and an exemplary balance of aromatics and flavor. The second-ranked category is designated “superior” (equivalent to the premiers crus of Burgundy). Although wines from these sites, too, may be first-rate, they frequently accentuate a single attribute and may seem less complete. For those consumers who prefer particular taste profiles, these wines can offer satisfaction that matches or exceeds that of wines from “exceptional” sites. The third tier in Burgundy is designated by the term village. The particular site (if mentioned at all) is specified on the label of those wines. The corresponding term in this atlas is good. This generally refers to vineyards of above-average quality (sometimes even superior but not consistently so), which can show the local character of wines through particularly accentuated characteristics. Naturally, most vineyards belong to the final category of those without distinction. It should not be said, however, that the vintners who cultivate these parcels put forth little effort or that the wines produced offer no value. Rather, the natural conditions restrict the quality that can be achieved. THE VDP CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM\n\nThe negative effects of the 1971 wine law have been rigorously debated since 1984 by the Confederation of Predicate Wine Estates (Verband der Prädikatsweingüter, or VDP), with the threefold goal of reinvigorating the renown of\n\nIntroductIon\n\nGerman vineyards, giving dry wines the recognition they deserve, and establishing an explicit, traditional taste profile for the concept of Prädikat (distinction). These discussions led to a classification model in which wines were graded according to a quality pyramid: table wine (Guts­ weine or Ortsweine), classified wine (klassifizierte Lagen­ weine), and wine from VDP premier sites (VDP Erste Lage). A prerequisite for this classification was a precise demarcation of the best parcels, which VDP members were to carry out in their own vineyards. As a basis for the classifications, historical vineyard maps were consulted to determine which sites were historically regarded as superior according to certain criteria (high land taxes, for example), as well as a vineyard’s record of producing highquality wines over the course of decades. The designation Erste Lage was given to the highest class of wine and was marked by a logo showing the numeral one with a grape bunch on the label or directly on the bottle. This logo marks the qualifying vineyards on the maps in this atlas. All wines of this category are produced with a focus on terroir. Dry wines of this category are indicated by the term VDP Grosses Gewächs (great growth), except in the Rheingau, where the term Erstes Gewächs (first-class growth) is used. Wines with residual sugar carry the traditional designations of Spätlese through Trockenbeerenauslese. Besides Erste Lage, there are other classified vineyards whose wines are permitted to carry a designated name: these are the Zweite Lage (second-ranked sites). Vineyard names appear only on wines of these two classifications. All other wines are marketed without indication of the vineyard of origin.* The VDP’s classification scheme has done the great service of directing consumer attention back to the quality of vineyard parcels; however, it has also introduced many problems. A relatively easy defect to fix is the confederation’s overgenerosity in acceding to the wishes of its members. A more serious problem is that the quality rankings of the VDP are incompatible with the classifications specified by current wine laws. For example, wines * Translator’s note: On January 25, 2012, the VDP passed a resolution significantly altering its categories of classification, and the category Zweite Lage was dropped. The new scheme reflects the significance of terroir rather than wine style. Wines with residual sugar are now candidates for VDP classification, though different terminology is used for sweet and dry wines in order to minimize confusion for the consumer. An explanation of the classifications and the text of the resolution are available in English on the VDP website: www.vdp.de/en/classification (accessed April 16, 2013).\n\ndesignated by the VDP as Grosses Gewächs are considered ordinary table wines (Qualitätswein) under the 1971 law. The latter is a legal concept that exists independent of the VDP’s minimum requirements: for example, it does not prohibit certain types of enrichment. A further difficulty of the VDP scheme is its requirement that a site name be used exclusively for a single wine type. A vintner who produces a Grosses Gewächs wine in an Erste Lage vineyard cannot use the same vineyard name for any other dry wines, or even for a fruity, sweet Kabinett wine. Countless wine estates complain that this statute severely curtails their competitiveness in the market. Furthermore, the Grosses Gewächs and Erstes Gewächs distinctions can be limiting for winemakers. In many cellars Grosses Gewächs are simply the dry wines of the vintage that are highest in alcohol, made from grapes with the maximum ripeness possible for dry-styled wines. However, in classic Riesling growing areas, the most prestigious wines are not necessarily produced in a dry style. Even in southern Germany, a region that has traditionally leaned toward a drier style, Grosses Gewächs is a new and relatively untested concept. Whether this trend remains viable, in which the Grosses Gewächs wines reflect their terroir of origin and exhibit minerality and a long life, remains to be seen. Finally, the VDP’s classifications apply only to its member growers. Until all German vineyards are included, the VDP system remains only a good beginning. For that reason, the authors of this atlas have striven to include sites of non–VDP members as well. And although the classification used here obviously does not lay claim to a complete engagement with all important discussions, the authors wish to assert that their work is unbiased and independent of vested interests. The most important classification models, namely those currently used in Burgundy and in the Médoc region of Bordeaux, were developed from the assessments of merchants, collectors, and other experts. The authors have followed this practice by collecting data from and speaking with many participants in the wine industry. Vintners are naturally biased in favor of their own vineyards. Nonetheless, the information provided by growers forms the most important data source for this atlas. Their perspectives are considered in conjunction with the judgments of wine merchants and the appraisals of the market. An essential criterion in the classification scheme was the authors’ own tasting of wines from the corresponding vineyards. Final decisions were often made by visiting the vineyards, where all individual components blend into a harmonious whole.\n\n9\n\nWhat Makes a Vineyard Unique? Worldwide, almost 8 million hectares (close to 20 mil-\n\nlion acres) stand under vine. The quantity of wine produced, year after year, is so great that it cannot be consumed. Unsold wine is often reduced to its most valuable component, pure alcohol. Most of the wine that does make it into circulation is nameless: it often winds up in enormous tanks, where it is blended and transformed into one of a handful of wines with marketable taste profiles. In an environment of such oversupply and anonymity, how can a wine producer stand out from the crowd? How do producers develop a reputation for their wines so that enthusiasts from near and far are willing to pay a premium for a bottle endowed with a little piece of their earth? Any attempt at an answer is, of course, ideologically loaded. An atlas such as this must come to grips with the relationship between a vineyard’s natural advantages and the human ability to adapt and transform. A well-situated vineyard cannot in itself guarantee an outstanding wine. If a top site is poorly cultivated, its wines will still carry some of its attributes, but the wines will lack the luster and complexity that the site has the potential to express. This missed opportunity can sink the valuation of a given wine or site. Conversely, an engaged vintner can produce wines from an ordinary vineyard that far outclass some wines from the best vineyard sites. A wine achieves true glory when a careful, style-conscious vintner maximizes a vineyard’s potential.\n\nThe vineyard as workplace: a typical vintner’s hut near Höhnstedt, Saale-Unstrut.\n\nTo permit a better understanding of the interaction between nature and human cultivation, the following discussion identifies the most important natural factors, which are mentioned in the vineyard descriptions in each chapter.\n\nCLIMATE: THE FUEL FOR GRAPE RIPENESS\n\nIn the 1970s, the promotional campaign for the winegrowing region of Baden used the symbol of a laughing sun tilting a glass of wine. The message was that a lot of sunshine made for good wine. Today, the grinning sun no longer adorns brochures or labels. Independent of the fact that the world’s climate is undergoing great changes and that Central Europe is seeing higher and higher temperatures—a trend that seems likely to continue— the wine world has developed a finer understanding of the importance and complexities of climate. Because the grapevine is not simply a passive recipient of the weather, good vintners have begun to understand that their job entails creating the most favorable environment for the grapes in a given climate. Naturally, the number of hours of sunshine is an important factor in overall climatic conditions (and in what some call “macro-climate”): the light of the sun makes possible photosynthesis and the metabolic processes that enable the vine to produce mature, healthy fruit. But lower levels of sunshine can be compensated for by limiting the amount of fruit per vine. A level of sunshine that will not bring ten grapes to ripeness might still provide enough energy to ripen four grapes. The length of the growing season is among the most important climatic factors. Increasingly common are areas\n\n11\n\n12\n\nW I N E AT L A S O F G E R M A N Y\n\nA Mosel tradition: staked vines with bow-shaped grape shoots.\n\nwhere budding begins early, and the light and warmth of summer lead to the early ripening of the grapes. As untroubled as this growth cycle sounds, it is hardly ideal. The aromatic qualities that lend a wine depth and complexity are formed through a gradual ripening process. Many great wines are produced from an early bud break followed by growing conditions that delay the ripening of the grapes. Such conditions are uncommon, and they occur mainly in areas that pose other, greater risks. Typically, vineyards that offer a comparatively early bud break along with an extended ripening period are found at high altitudes, where late frosts may destroy the developing fruit. Here, as in many other areas, grape variety, macroclimate, and cultivation technique operate in tension: the more quality-oriented a vintner, the more inescapable are certain risks. Two additional factors belong to the realm of macroclimate: the warmth of the sun and precipitation. The sun can evaporate excess moisture, a welcome effect. But if the relative humidity of the atmosphere is too low, the vine will come under stress, and its growth will be stunted. Together, warmth and humidity can spur fungal infec-\n\ntions. In late fall, when the grapes are already ripe, such weather conditions are welcome, because they might permit the growth of a favorable kind of “noble rot” (Edelfäule, or botrytis), which can produce prized dessert wines. Within a single vineyard parcel, the macroclimatic conditions are modified by local effects known as mesoclimate and microclimate. Mesoclimate refers to conditions that exist across a stretch of several hundred meters, such as the presence of a river, lakes, and possible wind tunnels. Even the protection offered by nearby hillsides from wind and rain fits into this category. Not least among mesoclimatic factors are the vineyard’s exposure, or its orientation with respect to the sun, and the steepness of its slopes. Exposure and steepness play a profoundly important role in German wine production because in many places only steep southfacing slopes receive sufficiently intense sunlight to grow healthy vines. Microclimate refers to the climatic effects in the vicinity of individual grapevines. These include the topographical peculiarities of the land: for example, troughs where heat accumulates, walls that reflect warmth, and bushes that protect neighboring vines from the wind. Even the proximity and method of vine plantings affect the microclimate, because the relative humidity of the air around the vines is in part determined by whether the vines run parallel or perpendicular to the prevailing winds. In the former case, the grapes and foliage dry more quickly after a rainfall. However, rows planted perpendicular to the wind form a deciduous protective wall, thus retaining warmth between the rows. Additional factors include the choice of trellising method and the density of planted vines. Narrow gaps between vines may limit the harvest, thus potentially improving quality, but they can also be a disadvantage because foliage from one vine blocks the sun for another. The interrelationship of macro-, meso-, and microclimate for wine quality is complex. In general, a vineyard with a favorable meso- and microclimate in a difficult macroclimate produces more interesting wines than one in a superior macroclimate with ordinary meso- and microclimates. The outcome always depends on the particular circumstances—a fact which gives this atlas its appeal.\n\nW h at M a k e s a V i n e ya r d U n i q U e ?\n\nthe sOiL\n\nSoil is mysterious. This is of particular consequence with respect to ideology, which the authors of this atlas do not wish to neglect. The ideology of Blut und Boden (blood and soil) decreed as doctrine during the Third Reich (and accepted by German winegrowers of the time) is a perversion of agriculture. It posits a natural relationship between particular peoples and the lands they have historically occupied, which should be preserved or reasserted by force if necessary. Yet the intellectual core of this idea is untenable. There are no breeds of people or types of vintners suited to certain vineyards. On the contrary, the cultivation of first-class soil demands a continuity that is secured only through peace and diversity in the realm of ideas. The recognition that geological processes have shaped landscapes, rocks, and the earth over millions of years is a show of humility, not a call to arms. Vintners who have the privilege of owning vineyards are proud to be active participants in even a moment of the earth’s history. Soils, above all in the taste that they leave behind in wine, contain something uniquely fascinating. The earth sciences initially differentiated between skeletal and fine soil. Skeletal soils include components that are not deformable, such as gravel, flint, stones, and solids. The composition of skeletal soils often reveals the geological history of a region. On the whole, five different rock types can be differentiated. To begin with, two types of igneous rocks formed as a consequence of volcanic activity. Plutonic rock was formed a kilometer below the earth’s surface as layers of the earth’s crust melted as a result of volcanic activity and then slowly cooled. Much later this rock reached the earth’s surface, either through tectonic movement or through the removal of rock strata above. This category includes some very hard types of rock, such as granite. Effusive volcanic rock, such as rhyolite and basalt, has similar origins but was transported to the earth’s surface before it cooled. The particularly rapid cooling of magma after an eruption— accelerated by the entrapped gas—helped form porous types of volcanic rock, including tuff. Sedimentary rocks are also divided into two types. Fragmental rock was formed by wind, water, and ice through\n\ntransport and deposition. Sandstone, for example, originated in the Triassic period (approximately 250 million years ago), when shallow, sandy seas were created by the movement of sand from the mainland. Silica sand, meanwhile, cemented through interaction with minerals. Loam—a so-called unconsolidated sediment, which geologists regard as a stone— originated from windborne sand that came to rest high on hillsides, where it piled up in layers. Through decomposition (while maintaining a high proportion of sand), loess was frequently turned into loam clay. Gravelly earth is found in river courses where rocks were deposited or where a retreating glacier left behind its detritus (moraine) at the end of the Ice Age. Limestone is a sedimentary rock that formed partly from the shells and skeletons of living organisms (a biogenic sediment). It emerged when the remnants of large bodies of water, including certain life forms (such as corals, mussels, and sponges), deposited a layer of lime. Marl was formed through the interaction of precipitated lime and clay deposits. In an age of fluctuating sea levels, when vast temperature and humidity differences prevailed, lime was frequently transformed into gypsum. Metamorphic rocks form the fifth category. They owe their existence to the conversion of mineral structures through various physical processes. Devonian shale, for example, is found in places where, approximately 400 million years ago, clay sediment hardened and later formed mountain folds. Through pressure and thermal processes, mudstone and minerals within these folds formed bands of rock, creating typically fissile slate. Gneiss is also a metamorphic rock. It shows clear layering, although it is not fissile. Gneiss can also be composed of volcanic rock (orthogneiss) or sedimentary rock (paragneiss). Fine earth is soil that can be kneaded or can trickle between the fingers. Fine earth has multiple origins, including the decomposition of stone, the formation of humus (thus the enrichment of organic agents), or the addition of soil, with or without human intervention. Soil scientists differentiate the individual components of fine earth according to the size of the particles. Sand is the coarsest particle (at less than 2 millimeters in diameter, one can speak of its granular consistency). Even finer is silt (with particles smaller than .06 millimeter and a mealy texture).\n\n13\n\n14\n\nW I N E AT L A S O F G E R M A N Y\n\nClay, with particle sizes of less than .002 millimeter, feels greasy in the palm of the hand. Loam, also considered fine earth, can be a random mixture of these particles. Countless factors influence the suitability of the soil for vines and the ensuing quality of the wine. First, the microclimate of the vineyard exerts its influence on the earth. A soil with calcareous components can warm up quickly, thereby promoting plant growth. Heavy soil types, often containing only loam and clay, can remain so cool that they delay the ripening of grapes. While this attribute might be desirable in warmer wine regions, it is rarely so in German vineyards. Many types of rock heat up during the day and release their warmth during the night. A particularly important role of the soil in the growth of vines and the quality of wine is the regulation of moisture. Soils with a high stone content exhibit good drainage and protect vine roots from becoming waterlogged, although vines may be at greater risk during times of drought. The\n\n[p. #15]\n\nmoisture-retention properties of fine-earth soils are a fascinating but complex aspect of geology. Small particles, like those in clay soils, bind easily with water. Like a microporous sponge, clay is remarkable in its ability to retain water—sometimes too much. Conversely, in overly dry conditions, clay turns rock-hard and becomes inhospitable for the vine. Sand, by contrast, retains very little water, instead allowing it to drain into the deeper layers of the earth. Thus few vineyards are planted exclusively in either clay or sand. High-quality soils are always sufficiently porous. They retain moisture well and, in times of drought, maintain a minimum level of elasticity. There is no such thing as the perfect soil: the interactions of the bedrock with the climate, the topographical features of the area, and its living organisms are simply too diverse. From the worms to the yeasts and bacteria, even the mostly invisible soil components contribute to the characteristics that the vineyard imparts to the wine. Nevertheless, winegrowers and soil scientists attempt to improve on existing conditions. Along the Mosel River and its Saar and Ruwer tributaries, the surface of many vineyards is strewn with slate because generations of vintners have placed slate pieces between the rows of vines to retain warmth on the steep slopes. A comparable custom prevails in many areas of Württemberg, where vintners spread marl across their vineyards (a process known locally as mergeln) for similar reasons. In other places it is customary to enrich thin, skeletal soils with humus and other organic materials. These measures not only nourish young vines but also— especially in steep areas—reduce erosion. The soil in deeply plowed furrows (Rigolen) plays such a special role in winegrowing that it has been given its own name. Scientists speak of Rigosol as an anthropogenic soil type, cultivated for centuries and often reaching a meter or more in depth. The purpose of plowing furrows is not only to mix different soil strata (frequently in an attempt to avoid water stagnation) but also to replenish soil components that have drained down the hillside or to introduce new substances into the soil. Storehouse for water and warmth: the vineyard soil influences the growth of vines and the quality of the wine.\n\nW h at M a k e s a V i n e ya r d U n i q U e ?\n\nA particularly drastic example of how human intervention has altered soil can be found in the Ortenau (Baden). Many parcels of the Durbach Plauelrain vineyard were made fertile only through the blasting and breaking of rock. Undoubtedly this also affected neighboring vineyards by the dispersal of fragments of decomposed granite. Sometimes decomposition marks the starting point, but just as often this is marked by the work of man. MineraLity\n\nOne of the effects of soil most readily acknowledged by wine-tasting experts is nevertheless difficult to demonstrate scientifically. This is the question of whether minerals in the soil make their way into the grapes and thus affect the taste and texture of the wine. Scientific attempts to trace the exact path of minerals in plant tissue have until now been inconclusive. The problem, however, might lie in the experimental methods used. From a sensory standpoint, the effect seems clear. Rieslings from slate-filled vineyards often smell and taste quite different from Rieslings grown in volcanic or lime soils; they also differ in perceived salinity. It is implausible that these differences have to do exclusively with microclimate (as influenced by soil type) or with the water retention capacity of the soil. More plausible is the explanation that old vines, with their deep and well-developed root systems, can dissolve and absorb minerals from the deeper strata. At sufficiently low yields, these minerals might be found in perceptible concentrations in wine (either as salts or transformed into aromatic compounds). This theory is supported by the fact that wines from younger vines with only surface-level roots only seldom taste minerally. Vines that have been irrigated or have shallow roots display similar shortcomings. On the other hand, vines can easily break through soft rocks such as chalks. The roots of old vines can even be found encroaching into granite. That this is without consequence for the absorption of minerals is hardly conceivable.\n\nterrOir\n\nAlthough terroir has become a fashionable concept, its value has begun to wane from overuse. Nevertheless, the concept\n\nInvaluable help in steep vineyards: the trackway brings the harvest safely to the valley floor.\n\nis presented here as one that is worth endorsing. Terroir refers to combined effect of all the growing conditions of a vineyard, not only climate and soil but also decisions about cultivation, such as planting density, trellis system, pruning, tillage, canopying, and foliage work. The choice of harvest time and method (by hand or mechanically, in one or several stages) may also be considered as aspects of terroir. The concept of terroir assumes that the vintner should offer wine deemed to be typical of certain sites (from personal experience or passed down through generations). CeLLarinG, Wine styLes, and taste trends\n\nThe prime example of a grape variety that can produce a diversity of wine styles is Riesling. It can be a casual quaffing wine in liter bottles, a fruity-sweet Spätlese, an earthy-elegant dry Kabinett, a spicy Auslese, or a high-\n\n15\n\n16\n\nW I N E AT L A S O F G E R M A N Y\n\ndensity Trockenbeerenauslese, bursting with sweetness and acidity. For the expert this might be an inexhaustible playing field, but for the layman a confusing maze. And the provisions of the German wine law are notoriously unhelpful in alleviating confusion. One of the fundamental criteria of German white wines is the level of sweetness. Wines with the designation trocken (dry) contain, ideally, no sugar. During fermentation, nearly all of the natural grape sugars in the must are converted to alcohol, until only about one gram of sugar per liter remains, which even the most complete fermentation will fail to convert. Yet very few wines are actually fermented to this extent. For dry wines, the German wine law permits a residual sugar content of up to 9 grams per liter, corresponding to the formula “acid value + 2.” This leads to a situation in which a Silvaner with 6.5 grams of residual sugar and mild acidity—for example, 4.5 grams per liter—may still be labeled as trocken, although it tends toward a mild, almost lightly sweet taste. Conversely, a Saar Riesling rich in acidity, whose fermentation left 12 grams of residual sugar, cannot be labeled as trocken, even though it may taste thoroughly dry. But how does a wine obtain its sweetness? In winemaking, sugar comes into play in two ways. First, sugar is present in the grapes. German Prädikat wines may contain only these natural sugars. For the finished wine to be sweet, either the fermentation process must stop (whether naturally or through the winemaker’s intervention) before the yeasts convert all the grape sugars into alcohol (and carbonic acid), or else sweet grape must is added to the fermented wine. (This process is permitted for Prädikat wines as long as the must comes from the same grapes.) This so-called sweet reserve (Süssreserve) is removed from the must before the onset of fermentation, then sulfured and stored at low temperatures until it is used in calibrating the taste of the fermented wine. Stopping fermentation is the preferred process; most winemakers also add a small dose of sulfur. Refrigeration is less convenient, and because of the filters, less careful. Nobly sweet fine wines, such as Beerenauslese, Trockenbeerenauslese, and ice wines (Eisweine), often end their fermentations naturally with much residual sugar. The yeasts are, so to speak, stuffed\n\nfull from a lavish food supply. If the fermentation threatens to go too far, so that the sugar and alcohol levels are unbalanced, the winemaker can intervene and end the process in order to retain the sweetness. For Deutscher Wein (table wine) and Qualitätswein (ordinary-quality wine), one additional use of sugar is permitted: sugar may be added to the must before the onset of fermentation in order to increase the wine’s alcohol content. In this way, wines made from unripe grapes can still attain a certain stature. The sugar has no effect on the taste of the wine, only on the alcohol level! This use of sugar is less objectionable. Count Jean-Antoine Chaptal, France’s interior minister in the Napoleonic period, described and recommended the practice, which now bears his name. Indeed, as “chaptalized” wines are always a bit less subtle than those without added sugars, at the beginning of the twentieth century the latter wines were marked as “natural.” The legacy of this practice survives in the present German wine law, which permits Prädikat designations to be used only for these same wines. However, in years when grapes fail to ripen, the sugaring of musts may be essential. Moreover, for the production of red wine, judicious chaptalization has another positive and harmless effect: it can stimulate fermentation and promote the extraction of color and aromatic compounds from the grape skins. The information on German wine labels (vintage, place of origin, grape variety, quality level, and flavor) provides only basic details about the wine’s style, revealing little about the overall taste profile and winemaking techniques. It has long been debated whether winemaking style is more important (and influential) than the characteristics that the grapes draw from the vineyard. A simple rule of thumb is that the less complex a wine is, the more likely it is to have been “made in a cellar”; the higher the quality, the more likely it is that restraint was exercised in the cellar. With wines made from the highest-quality grapes from top winegrowing sites, cellaring techniques are only to accentuate rather than to dictate a style. Even so, different wines from the same vineyard site never taste exactly the same. The personality of the vintner who prepares the wine always shines through.\n\nW h at M a k e s a V i n e ya r d U n i q U e ?\n\nTherefore it is necessary to pay attention to the name of the producer as well as the name of the vineyard. What separates the good from the bad? This question has no simple answers. Everything depends on personal taste, although most experienced wine drinkers generally agree as to which styles are best suited to certain grape varieties and regions. In principle, however, whether a steel tank, large wooden barrel, or small barrique is used; whether a red wine is pressed with abundant or minimal tannic agents; and whether a white wine offers fragrance and finesse or a sinewy texture, anything goes. What pleases is what is permitted. There is only one “style” that should raise skepticism, namely wines that follow a marketing idea rather than a wine idea. Designer bottles, special labels, pompous displays and decorations, and self-defined characteristics should be viewed cautiously. These ideas, which could come from cheap business seminars, have little to do with wine and its place of origin.\n\nSince the 1980s, barriques made from French oak are also seen in German cellars.\n\nthe VaLUe OF a CLassiFiCatiOn and What tO dO With it\n\nOne might say, logically, that a favored vineyard site is a necessary condition for great wine, but it is not a sufficient condition. Unfortunately, not every site designated as “superior” in this wine atlas can deliver a profound wine experience. And the work of a conscientious grower can usually deliver a better than ordinary glass of wine, even if the vineyard from which the wine originated is only average. Even so, classifying vineyards enables us to distinguish those that have, for decades, provided the best wines from their particular region. For one thing, it is enjoyable to view a map and read descriptions of the characteristics of particular vineyards—and then to complement this information with the sensory experience of sampling the wine. For another, recognizing such distinctions keeps alive the differences that are a part of the wine culture. It also provides vintners with incentive to continue to care for the most challenging vineyards. Classifications have their limits. The German wine law of 1971 has redrawn the boundaries of many historical sites\n\nand has permitted their names to be misused in order to give neighboring vineyard sites a marketing advantage. Often the authors of this book found themselves facing a dilemma: if such expanded vineyards are designated as “superior,” then the wines made from less-favorable parts of the vineyard will be overvalued. However, to deny the expanded vineyard the “superior” or “exceptional” designation does a disservice to the part of the vineyard that merited prestige in the first place. In cases of doubt, where the wines from a vineyard’s lesser parcels are predominant on the market, we have opted for the lower ranking. The second limitation of our classification involves vineyards that have strong natural advantages but are cultivated by operations that have not earned renown. We are certain that there are few undiscovered pearls in German viticulture, but we are equally certain that some indeed exist. Should you one day meet one of these yet undiscovered vintners, then our work of this atlas will not have been in vain.\n\n17\n\nThe History of Winegrowing in Germany It is not known when the first vineyards were planted or\n\nwhen their grapes were turned into wine. The earliest proof of the systematic cultivation of vines dates back several millennia before Christ, to the blooming culture of the Near East in the modern states of Egypt, Iran, and Israel. A fruit and grape press approximately eight thousand years old, found near Damascus, and a Sumerian cylinder seal to label wine amphora roughly six thousand years old are the oldest evidence of winemaking. The Phoenicians cultivated grapevines in Greece and later in Italy. There is evidence of winemaking in both areas before the time of Christ. In Greece, where wine was initially a medicinal drink, it eventually became a drink for all people, so much so that we can speak of the Hellenes as the forebears of wine culture. With the founding of Greek colonies in the western Mediterranean, wine culture spread toward France around 600 b.c.e. and then to Sicily and Italy about one hundred years later. THE EARLY ROMANS AND THE SPREAD OF VITICULTURE\n\nIn the search for the origins and beginnings of viticulture in Germany, we can turn without question to the Romans, who learned it from the Greeks and Etruscans. In the course of the Roman conquest of Germanic territory, knowledge of winegrowing reached German-speaking lands fifty years before the Common Era. From its entry at the port of Massilia (now Marseille), wine traveled up the Rhône, Saône, Rhine, and Mosel to Germany, and in the first centuries of the Common Era, grapevines also Schloss Johannisberg: in the middle of the palace courtyard stands a monument recognizing the creation of Spätlese wines in the eighteenth century.\n\nfound their way to Germany. In the third century c.e., the “Wine Emperor” Probus (276–82) advocated winegrowing in the Roman provinces and decreed new plantings along the Rhine and the Danube. The decline of Rome and the barbarian invasions hindered the growth of wine culture, and the Roman knowledge of vine cultivation and winemaking disappeared into the darkness of history. Beginning with Charlemagne (748–814), who made Aachen the imperial seat of northern Europe, German winegrowing experienced its first resurgence. The farsighted emperor regulated cultivation and trade, prohibited the use of animal skins to hold wine, and adopted restrictive rules for winemaking that have found their consummation in the strict tenets of the European Union—a startling continuity. More than 1,200 years ago, his Capitulare de Villis included regulations governing the wine tavern that led to the establishment of the Strausswirtschaft (regional wine tavern), thereby helping to secure extra income for generations of vintners. Although the number of vineyards increased exponentially under Charlemagne, the existing religious foundations, where Roman techniques of agriculture and cellaring were improved, were the true birthplaces of German wine culture. Abbeys were the center and moving force of winegrowing and accumulated a significant amount of income from it. Although, as a rule, vineyards constituted less than 10 percent of an abbey’s dedicated farmland, the sale of wine accounted for about three-fourths of its total income. Lucrative vineyards were accumulated through gifts and legacies from believers who entrusted their souls to the abbeys, through exchanges and purchases, and even through dowries brought to the abbey by entering monks\n\n19\n\n20\n\nW I N E AT L A S O F G E R M A N Y\n\nand lay brothers. Initially produced for personal consumption and for the celebration of the Eucharist, wine gradually became more and more a traded commodity. The largest trading center in the Middle Ages was in the former bishopric of Cologne, where the Cistercian Eberbach Abbey (in the Rheingau) operated seven cellars of its own and rented another eleven. A clever system of rents collected by the abbeys and noble estates enabled the introduction of winegrowing to the peasants. By the Middle Ages, viticulture had spread to all of Germany. Following the split of the Frankish Empire in the ninth and tenth centuries, winegrowing was brought to middle Germany by the Ottonians and spread all the way to the Baltic Sea. Medieval wine had little in common with the products of today. Especially in the peasant operations, it was more or less an accidental mix of grapes, quickly fermented and sold in barrels. Nevertheless, it became an increasingly important part of everyday life. Good money was paid to abbeys and noble estates with better vineyards and better wine. In spite of its image as a simple house and tavern drink, wine also earned a reputation as a luxury beverage for parties and celebrations—a double identity that sustained wine production in Germany during the following centuries. From the eleventh to the end of the sixteenth century, German viticulture experienced its greatest expansion, peaking at about 300,000 hectares under vine. Of this area, only about one-third remains. The Thirty Years’ War (1618–48) and the Palatinate Wars of Succession (1688–97) depopulated entire sections of the Pfalz, thereby devastating winegrowing in Germany. Vineyards in Bavaria as well as\n\nin northern, eastern, and central Germany were annihilated. In addition, poor harvests contributed to the gradual reduction of vineyards, and former wine regions were put to other agricultural uses. High taxes and tolls also burdened the wine trade. Competition from other drinks, especially beer but also spirits and coffee, put pressure on wine even in its home regions. At the same time, prices for some rare wines shot through the roof: In the middle of the seventeenth century, 1,200 liters of one Rhine wine cost about 300 Goldtaler. At the start of the eighteenth century, the economic situation stabilized. German viticulture gradually retreated to the valleys of the Rhine and its tributaries, and winegrowing became increasingly professional and systematized. In the Rheingau, the designations Kabinett, Spätlese, and Auslese appeared for the first time. The trend on German wine estates toward producing high-quality varietal wines helped Riesling gain ascendancy in many regions. Still, the greater share of the vineyards was in the hands of ecclesiastical or aristocratic owners. THE RISE AND DECLINE OF WINE CULTURE\n\nThe year 1803 was a watershed with respect to land tenure. In the course of secularization, brought about by the spread of Enlightenment philosophy and the spillover of the French Revolution into the German states, ecclesiastical principalities, imperial abbeys, the holdings of nobles, and knight fiefdoms were liquidated. Churches and monasteries were plundered, their possessions were sold off, and the nuns and monks were forced to settle elsewhere. With these changes, viticulture in Germany went through another crisis. Yet the changes also led to the birth of many of the best-known secular wine estates, which took over the lands and winemaking expertise of many of the former monastic and aristocratic owners. German viticulture was about to experience a renaissance. More and more estates made quality their core principle, and German wines— especially nobly sweet Rieslings—garnered more recognition at home and abroad. The outbreak of phylloxera at the end of the nineteenth century disrupted viticulture in many parts of Europe. This vine disease, caused by a louse that attacks the roots, first causes the foliage to wither, and then the new shoots lack vigor. The fruit fails to ripen, and two to three years Neumagen: sculpture of a ship used by the Romans to transport wine to their outlying provinces.\n\nThe hisTory of WinegroWing in germany\n\nRiesling: The Most German of Grapes as with most grape varieties, the precise origin of riesling remains a mystery. alsace claims to be the home of riesling, based on a documented mention of the grape during a 1477 visit of Duke rené ii of Lorraine. even the origin of the name is uncertain. allegedly dating from the fifteenth century, it could derive from either Russling (Rus = dark wood) or Rissling (rissig = break or tear). in a wine dictionary from 1930, the answer is short and sweet: “homeland: germany. Probably a seedling from the rheingau.” The reasoning appears to have been the fact that before 1392, the rheingau changed from a red-wine region to a predominantly white-wine region. The Cistercian abbey of Kloster eberbach in the rheingau forced this shift and demanded that its tenants plant white grape varieties. Whether or not these plantings involved riesling is less clear; however, cellar records from 1435 do mention “rießlingen in the vineyards.”\n\nKloster Eberbach: center of German wine culture.\n\nThe first known mention of the name using its current spelling is in a 1522 Latin herbal book by hieronymus Bock.

Phylloxera, unintentionally brought in from the United States, destroyed many vineyards in Germany and caused the extinction of many unique regional grape varieties. At the time there were about 150,000 hectares under vine in Germany. All means of combating the infestation proved unsuccessful. The only remedy was to graft the vines onto phylloxeraresistant American rootstock. Phylloxera was not the only vine disease that growers had to contend with: peronospora and powdery mildew further damaged German viticulture. Under the pressure of these invasions, grapevine research experienced a baptism by fire. Winegrowing schools and experimental stations were established at the end of the nineteenth century in order to institutionalize knowledge of grape breeding and plant diseases. At the same time, social unrest among vintners led to the founding of winegrowing cooperatives according to the proposals of the German social reformer and municipal official Wilhelm Raiffeisen (1818–88). The banding together of small operations helped protect the vintners from harvest gluts and economic disaster while also working to improve the quality of their wines.\n\nUntil the end of the Second Reich in 1918, German wines, above all the Rieslings of the Rheingau, the Pfalz, and the Mosel, were to be found on all the top tables of Europe. With the abrogation of noble privileges after the First World War, along with the onset of a worldwide economic crisis and, not least, the boycotts by France and England of German goods, German wine lost important markets—markets that domestic customers were unable to compensate for.\n\nVITICULTURAL CRISES IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\n\nThe 1901 wine law, which put forward the first legal definition of wine, was updated in 1930 to separate the regulation of wine from that of other consumable goods, to mandate recordkeeping for vintners, and to delimit distinct viticultural regions. Among the changes, the blending of foreign wines with German wines was strictly prohibited, and the addition of alcohol and sugar to wine was forbidden. Whereas the first German wine laws of 1892, 1901, and 1909 were generally concerned with the definition of wine\n\nA Measure of Quality Whereas in other countries the quality of wine has generally been\n\nsterneuburger must scale (KMW); France and Australia use\n\nassessed on the basis of geographic origin, in Germany the legal\n\nBaumé degrees, and the United States uses Brix degrees.\n\nclassification was oriented toward must density: the concentra-\n\nWhether a higher must density always reflects a better wine,\n\ntion of sugar, and thus the potential for alcohol content, in the\n\nparticularly for fully ripe grapes, is questionable, although\n\nripe grapes.

The Second World War reopened the deep wounds in the German wine economy. The dearth of qualified workers, the loss of vineyards to bombing raids, and the liquidation of wine merchants (many of whom were Jewish) were the immediate constraints confronting German wine producers in the war years. The postwar period was initially marked by an international boycott of German products, including wine. As a consequence of these difficulties, by 1950 only 49,000 hectares were under vine, the smallest area in German history. As the euphoria of the “economic miracle” set in during the 1950s, the old idea of agriculture, emphasizing quantity over quality, transformed the industry, with the help of advanced viticultural technology. Viticulturalists worked intensively to develop high-yielding new grape varieties. According to this mindset, traditional manual cultivation practices in the vineyard were too expensive. The possibilities for mechanizing and automating the vintner’s work seemed endless. Vintners were now active winemakers. The systematic control of fermentation put vintners in control of wine styling. What used to happen at the mercy of nature and the vigor of yeasts was now theirs to manage. They could tailor their product to meet the alleged desires of the market at a price consumers were willing to pay. After years of privation, this often meant inexpensive wines that had, instead of pleasurable residual sugar, only an unbalanced and cloying sweetness. From then on, sweet was a synonym for wine that was cheap, simple, and German. Even today, German wines suffer from this stereotype, and the idea that German wine is too expensive if it crosses the ten-dollar threshold is a marketing problem that is closely associated with this old image. It reduces the value of artisanal products. reorganiZaTion anD a reTUrn To QUaLiTy\n\nIn 1969 a new wine law was passed that abrogated the outdated laws and at the same time accepted the wine laws of\n\nOestrich: old crane for loading wine onto Rhine boats.\n\nthe European Economic Community (EEC). But on April 28, 1970, with the passing of clauses 816/70 and 817/70, the EEC officially ended the concept of a collective European wine market, and so the law never came into effect. In its place, a new law was passed in July 1971. One of its most important innovations was the introduction of three quality designations—Tafelwein, Qualitätswein, and Qualitätswein mit Prädikat—based on Oechsle weight. Official chemical and sensory evaluations were required for the issuance of a ministerial control number (AP number). The law also stipulated the reduction and aggregation of vineyard sites. As a result, old names that had been used for centuries in some cases disappeared from the vineyard register. In any case, the idea that rankings should be correlated solely with the concentration of sugar in the grapes can hardly be considered a guarantee of quality. With the reorganization of old sites and their bundling into conglomerate sites (Grosslagen), as well as the creation of fantasy vineyard names, simple wines can be offered under the labels of the most famous sites. This law, with\n\n23\n\n24\n\nW I N E AT L A S O F G E R M A N Y\n\nClassification of German Wines The German wine law of 1971 created a new classification scheme that tied quality levels to the grape must density at harvest. The Oechsle scale determines whether the finished wine can be offered as Kabinett, Spätlese, Auslese, Beerenauslese, or Trocken­ beerenauslese. The minimum must densities vary from region to region (see sidebar on page 22). Every German wine must be classified according to the following grades or quality levels:\n\nDeutscher Wein (formerly Tafelwein)\n\nEiswein\n\nWines in this category must originate exclusively from German grapes of approved varieties and vineyards. In contrast to other winegrowing countries, Germany produces only a small amount of this grade of wine. Enrichment (chaptalization) to raise alcohol content is permitted.\n\nClassification for wines from berries harvested and cellared at tem­ peratures below freezing (−7 degrees C or colder) from which only the fruit concentrate is pressed. The quality of the grapes must correspond to that for grapes used in Beerenauslese.\n\nLandwein\n\nAbout one­third of the vineyards in the Rheingau are classified and thus can be planted only with Riesling or Spätburgunder. The clas­ sification is based not only on the quality of adjoining vineyards but also on the climatic and soil conditions. Further criteria are a strict limit on yield (a maximum of fifty hectoliters per hectare), a requirement for hand harvesting, and a sensory evaluation of the wine by color, aroma, and taste. All Erstes Gewächs wines carry a special logo on their labels: three Roman arches in a black bar. The wines are released for sale only on September 1 following the year of harvest.\n\nGerman Landwein is one step above Deutscher Wein. Landwein must declare the region of origin on the label. Landwein is always dry or half­dry. Enrichment is permitted.\n\nQualitätswein This is the largest group of German wines. “Quality wines” must be 100 percent from grapes from one of the thirteen official Ger­ man wine regions. Different minimum levels of natural alcohol are specified for each wine according to variety and region. A quality wine may, like a Deutscher Wein, be enriched.\n\nPrädikatswein This category includes several grades of high­quality wine. Enrich­ ment is not permitted.

On this basis, members of the VDP decided in 2002 on a statute for the classification of Grosses Gewächs (great growth). These are dry Riesling wines from top sites. The designation Erste Lage does not identify a dry style of wine but differentiates ordinary from first­class vineyards, from which wines of differing quality levels and taste profiles can be made. How far this classi­ fication should go and which criteria should be binding for all VDP members remain, because of regional differences, unresolved. Dry­styled Grosses Gewächs wines must be made from classified sites with a long track record of producing wines with sufficient ripeness. They must be made from regionally approved grape varieties at Spätlese ripeness by means of traditional production processes. The yield is limited to fifty hectoliters per hectare. The white wines cannot be released for sale until September follow­ ing the year of harvest; for red wines, two years must pass. VDP operations that produce Grosses Gewächs wines relinquish the possibility of declaring dry Auslese wines from the same site and grape variety. [Translator’s note: The VDP classifications changed in January 2012. See page 9.]\n\nThe hisTory of WinegroWing in germany\n\nits bewildering multiplicity, is simply too confusing for consumers, particularly in export markets. The lingering negative image of German wine and the loss in market share, especially in Germany, cannot be solely attributed to the 1971 wine law. Other contributing factors were the thirst for new discoveries, experimentation by the postwar generation, and their rejection of German traditions, including those involving wine. The dusty image of old-fashioned wine had no place in a worldwide, open, and tolerant society. Even so, Germany had become the largest import market for foreign wines. German wines exhibited significant weaknesses. Although 1976 could be considered a landmark vintage, the subsequent years were marked by low and medium quality. In spite of all these obstacles and hurdles, the end of the 1980s marked an upward swing in quality that has persisted and produced some first-class wines in the past few years. The new popularity of German wine is the result of hardworking vintners, an engaged retail trade, a receptive food and wine culture, and interest from the popular media.\n\ngerman Wine in The WorLD marKeT\n\nThe prospects for the German wine trade in the coming years are no longer tied to national or even regional concerns. Rather, viticulture—like agriculture in general—is part of an international economic and retail network that is in part restrictive and in part dominated by lobbying groups, abetted by the industrialization of the wine world. This has the effect of creating a uniform mass taste that makes certain methods of production more favorable and more lucrative. Vintners with the courage to undertake natural winegrowing face increased viticultural and bureaucratic challenges, compounded by a lack of transparency and continuity in the current classification\n\nsystem. The effort to derive a clear, intelligent, and comprehensible set of definitions of German wines from the current morass of regulation (exemplified by the attempts to define grape ripeness) has only just begun. Regardless of whether a subjective classification of the best sites contributes to this undertaking, it is praiseworthy to begin the search for wine quality in its primary components, where it lies hidden in nature, brought to light by hard work and energy. If, however, the classification system is not well managed and favors unexceptional wines, the system will be undermined. In the final analysis, the attempt to classify as many sites as possible— even in highly parcelized areas—into an elitist and transparent model in order to guarantee top-quality wines is damaging, especially in an international context. The success of German winegrowers, who, more than foreign winegrowers, tend to work small parcels, will depend on more than the serendipitous ownership of privileged vineyards. It requires the combination of ecologically sound vineyard practices and clean, artisanal winemaking methods, along with rigorous oversight. That humans are the deciding factor is simultaneously a strength and a weakness. Insofar as many rules and ordinances are not legally binding, loopholes remain. In the end, the vintner determines the quality of the product, and the informed and quality-conscious consumer judges the success of the vintner’s art. The current view of a dry style as the embodiment of great German wine ignores the fact that the northerly German wine regions produce balanced, light wines with relatively low alcohol that have no serious competition from anywhere in the world, and for that reason alone they are ambassadors for German viticulture. If these wines are passed over in the selection of Germany’s best wines, then a great opportunity will be lost to highlight the uniqueness and exclusivity of German winemaking.\n\n25\n\nGrape Varieties More than 140 grape varieties, from Acolon to Zwei-\n\ngelt, are harvested or experimentally grown in German vineyards, although only a good dozen or so have any substantial economic importance. Riesling and Müller-Thurgau (also known as Rivaner) together account for about one-third of total planted vines, or about 102,000 hectares. Among red grape varieties, Spätburgunder and Dornfelder occupy more than 20,000 hectares of Germany’s vineyards. The proportion of recently developed grape varieties has declined in recent years; only Müller-Thurgau, Kerner, Bacchus, and Scheurebe are still prominent among white varieties. By contrast, the classic grape varieties of Silvaner, Grauburgunder (or Ruländer), and Weissburgunder have\n\nAcolon Origin: A cross between Blauer Limberger and Dornfelder, developed in 1971 in Weinsberg, permitted in Germany since 2002 Characteristics: Ripens earlier than Lemberger and has a higher must weight\n\nmaintained their share or even gained ground in the past few years. International grapes such as Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc are also growing in popularity. The recent red-wine boom has brought Dornfelder—in addition to the classic Spätburgunder—to the fore in almost all regions. However, other new red varieties have also been planted: Regent, Acolon, Domina, Cabernet Dorsa, and Cabernet Mitos. The international red varieties of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot are not often seen in German vineyards.

The vines are found mostly in the middle and lower valley of the Ahr River, predominantly on south-facing slopes between the villages of Altenahr and Bad Bodendorf, about where the Ahr meets the Rhine at Remagen. The region stretches along the Ahr for about twenty-five kilometers, flowing southwest to northeast. It is bounded in the northwest by the Ahr Mountains and protected from the elements by the forested Hohe Eifel region. The slopes are predominantly slate, with loess and loam found at lower elevations. Some vineyards contain basalt, sandstone, and weathered greywacke. Topographically, the craggy, winding middle Ahr valley, with its steep vineyards and overhanging cliffs (a subregion also known as the upper Ahr) differs significantly from the lower Ahr valley, which opens up at Walporzheim and typically has flatter, basalt-laden vineyards, such as the Heimersheim Landskrone. The upper Ahr, past the Altenahr Übigberg, has no vineyards. In the deeply cut valley, prevalent sunshine and mild temperatures make for very favorable winegrowing conditions. The almost Mediterranean climate is ideal for redwine production. Close to 88 percent of the area under vine is planted with red varieties, mainly Spätburgunder, Portugieser, Frühburgunder, and Dornfelder. Riesling and Müller-Thurgau are the most common white varieties. This area, the largest contiguous red-wine region of Germany, was once dubbed a “red wine paradise.” The wine is indeed paradisiacal: for the past two decades, the vintners of the Ahr have produced dry red wines full of character from their best vineyards. It is not surprising that the premium red wines of the region now fetch lofty prices.\n\n1:1,250,000\n\nHISTORY\n\nEven along the Ahr, winegrowing history begins with the Romans, though definitive archaeological evidence is still lacking. Other sources allege that the first vineyards in the Ahr valley were planted around 275 c.e., when the Franks passed through. The earliest documented evidence of winegrowing comes from the second half of the eighth century. A good hundred years later, in 893, according to the estate index (which includes land-lease records) of the Prüm Benedictine abbey, there were large vineyards in eight Ahr settlements, including Ahrweiler, Walporzheim, Dernau, and Altenahr, which are still important wine villages today. Vineyards later spread upstream and into the side valleys. In the early Middle Ages, most vineyards belonged to religious foundations, which promoted and encouraged winegrowing. In the eleventh century, secular dignitaries and burghers became vineyard owners for the first time. By then, white grape varieties dominated the vineyards. Only in the late Middle Ages did red varieties come to account for a good share of plantings, and not until after the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48) did the red Burgundy varieties dominate.\n\nView over one of the steepest and best vineyards along the Ahr River: the Einzellage Altenahr Eck. 33\n\n34\n\nW I N E AT L A S O F G E R M A N Y\n\nWinegrowing in the Ahr valley waxed and waned over the following centuries. With the invasion of the French in 1794 and the ensuing French occupation, the owners of vineyards were not only subjected to higher taxes but also faced with competition from inexpensive and alcohol-rich French wines. As a result—partly because of the French protective tariffs—Ahr winegrowers rapidly developed a trade in red wines with Belgium. These wines became known as Ahrbleichart (Ahr pink wines), though they no longer resembled the pale Schiller wines of earlier times but had an intense, dark-red color. Even the sparkling wines, especially those from Walporzheim, had a good reputation and were sold to English consumers at high prices. The region experienced another period of growth when it was annexed by Prussia following the Congress of Vienna in 1815. High protective tariffs shielded Ahr vintners from French imports, allowing their red wines to thrive in the domestic market. These brief golden years ended with the expansion of the German Customs Union, which simultaneously cut off the lucrative trade with Belgium and allowed inexpensive red wines from the Pfalz into the Prussian market, putting enormous pressure on Ahr winegrowers. There also followed several poor harvests and many unsalable vintages. Vineyards no longer provided a living for vintners. As a result, many Ahr winegrowing families left Germany for America. In an attempt to offset the many challenges, in 1869 the vintners of the village of Mayschoss formed one of the first winegrowing cooperatives in the\n\nINFO\n\nworld. By the end of the nineteenth century, there were twenty similar winegrowing associations in the Ahr valley. No sooner had wine prices halfway recovered than phylloxera attacked the Ahr valley in the 1880s, destroying about 200 hectares of vineyards by 1910. The total area under vine contracted steadily from 1,087 hectares (in 1883) to 606 hectares (in 1925). Then vineyards were afflicted by a new plague: the fanleaf virus attacked Spätburgunder vines and reduced yields so significantly that by the end of the 1950s, white wines accounted for one-third of total production. With the parcelization of estates resulting from partibleinheritance laws (allowing property to be divided among heirs), which were already in place before the French occupation, many vineyard possessions were divided into smaller and smaller holdings (sometimes less than half a hectare). In 1989, only five winegrowing operations had more than five hectares of vines. Even today most Ahr winegrowers (around 80 percent) do not bottle their own wine but instead sell their grapes to one of the four remaining cooperatives. Nevertheless, more than sixty operations still bring their wines to market under their own label. As a consequence of the parcelization of vineyards and the endeavors to terrace the steep slopes to facilitate planting, care, and harvesting, growing costs have gone through the roof. For many vintners, viticulture is no longer a profitable venture. The consolidation and modernization of viticulture that began in 1957, known in German as Flurbereinigung (including the terracing of slopes and\n\nAhr\n\nArea: 548 hectares Grape Varieties: Spätburgunder (61.1%), Portugieser (9%), Riesling (7%), Frühburgunder (6%), Dornfelder (4%), Regent (3%), Müller-Thurgau (2%), Weissburgunder (1%), Grauburgunder (0.5%), Dunkelfelder (0.5%) Predominant Soil Types: Between Altenahr and Marienthal, greywacke and weathered slate.

Biggest Misconception: The so-called Ahrbleichart (Ahr pink wines) that are frequently considered the predecessors of rosé or Schiller wines were probably not pink in color but a “decidedly dark red wine,” as described in one nineteenthcentury source.\n\nAhr\n\nthe building of service roads through vineyards), laid the foundation for many other structural improvements. At the same time there was an increase in the plantings of high-yielding Spätburgunder vines, just in time to slake the thirst of the thousands of day trippers and weekend tourists from Bonn, Cologne, and the neighboring Rhineland— one consequence of the postwar “economic miracle” of West Germany—who were served the region’s pinkish-red, often characterless wines. The red-wine paradise had become a popular vacation spot. Even before the worldwide red-wine boom, Ahr vintners had had little problem selling their wines. Their red wines were marketed as unostentatious and pleasantly sweet, and the still-rare dry varieties likewise sold well. Making better wines, at least initially, was not a necessity. That this redwine paradise was woken from its half-sleep in the mid1980s is unanimously attributed to a single man, Werner Näkel. This convert to winemaking, who after short stints as a math and physical education teacher took over his family’s Meyer-Näkel winery, decided to let his wines ferment on the grape skins. He was also the first Ahr vintner to experiment successfully with the use of French barriques. As soon as Näkel won acclaim for his 1987 dry Dernauer Goldkaul Spätburgunder, other winegrowers changed their own procedures, and the results sparked the boom that has lasted until the present. The key to the region’s production of high-quality red wines—in addition to the use of the best Burgundy clones, limits on yields, modern winemaking practices, and aging in barriques—is that the vintners of the Ahr are now united in their approach. In the wines’ typicity and fruity opulence, the better Spätburgunders from the Ahr are unmistakable, particularly those from the slate soils of the region’s best sites. Most of them show the hallmarks of the individual vintners. A number of growers do not release their best wines for immediate consumption, instead giving them more time to age in barriques. This gives the Frühburgunder and Spätburgunder wines not only more structure but also greater potential for cellaring.\n\nOptimal habitat for Spätburgunder: the smallest Einzellage along the Ahr, Walporzheim Gärkammer. CLIMATE\n\nMany years ago, before the undeniable effects of climate change disrupted long-held beliefs about winemaking, the fifty-first parallel of latitude was considered the northernmost boundary for quality wine production. The Ahr region lies at 50°30' north and might therefore have been thought of as the winegrowing North Pole. Despite this, red-wine production has been successful because the Ahr possesses ideal climatic and microclimatic conditions, even for the capricious Spätburgunder. Because of its location at the southern rim of the so-called Cologne Lowland (Kölner Bucht), the climate of the Ahr profits from the tempering influence of the Gulf Stream. In addition, the topography of the middle and lower Ahr creates a favorable exposure, and the soil benefits at night from the warmth stored during the long days in the rocky cliffs and stones that form the vineyard walls. The relatively small surface area of the Ahr River gives off less warmth than the Mosel or Rhine, though it still is an important factor in the region’s consistent climatic conditions. Every once in a while the vintners are threatened by spring frosts brought on by cold air masses that spill into the valley and collect at the foot of the vineyards.\n\n35\n\nLEGEND\n\n36\n\nHausen Hausen\n\nVillage with vineyards\n\nW I N E AT L A S O F G E R M AVillage N Y without vineyards Subregion border Grosslage border Einzellage border Excellent Vineyard\n\nLEGEND\n\nBold Nonbold\n\nA — B\n\nSuperior Vineyard Good Vineyard Village with vineyards Other Vineyards Village without vineyards VDP Erste Lage Subregion border Landmarks Grosslage border\n\nAhr\n\nEinzellage border Excellent Vineyard Superior Vineyard Good Vineyard Other Vineyards\n\nSchieferlay\n\nVDP Erste Lage Landmarks\n\nB — C\n\nOld Town\n\nC — D\n\nRuins of Are Castle\n\nKreuzberg Castle\n\nD — E\n\n1:60,000 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nkm\n\nE — F\n\nF — G\n\nThe entire territory is protected from wind and rain by the Eifel range and the Hohe Venn natural area.
