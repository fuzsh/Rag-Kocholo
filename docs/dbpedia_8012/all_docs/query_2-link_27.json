        "text": "CLAIRE STUBBER August 15, 1978-December 23, 2020\n\nDr Claire Stubber, who has died at the age of 42, was an advocate for organ donation and the embodiment of its benefits.\n\nShe knew that death was imminent when, at 17, she was placed on the organ transplant list. Claire received a donated heart and lungs in October 1996 at The Alfred hospital in Melbourne.\n\nSuch radical surgery is performed when a person is terminally ill with end-stage cardiothoracic disease. Only about 55 per cent of heart-lung recipients live beyond five years, so Claire’s survival for 24 years is remarkable.\n\nClaire was the second of four daughters born to Barbara, a nurse, and Leo, a consultant physician, who were living in Perth.\n\nWhen Claire was five months old, her mother noticed that her lips were blue, and she was diagnosed with a rare, inoperable heart condition with limited life expectancy. Because her heart couldn’t adequately pump blood around her body, Claire’s oxygen levels were so low she found any physical exertion extremely difficult.\n\nAs a child, going as fast as she could up the street, Claire recalled being easily overtaken by strolling octogenarians. Every breath was a challenge. Fortunately, she was born to a family devoted to books and reading became her passion and escape.\n\nAt 17, Claire had to be near the transplant unit so that she could go to hospital immediately organs became available. During the nine months she waited in Melbourne, Claire met Ian, the man who was to become her husband.\n\nIan, also from Perth, was waiting in Melbourne for donated lungs to ameliorate the effects of cystic fibrosis. Claire had never met anyone with a similar condition to hers and was pleased to find in Ian someone who understood her and with whom she could share her thoughts and concerns. They soon became inseparable.\n\nClaire wrote for her and other organ recipients: “Living begins with an anonymous death. It happens in the same unpredictable manner as birth: a rush through deserted city streets to the hospital after a phone call in the middle of the night.”\n\nShe said she was excited to be given this chance of staying alive and went into surgery gladly. She was grateful to the donor and the donor’s family. Had she died before the transplant Claire hoped her own healthy organs would be donated to someone else. She made it clear before her death she wanted her body to be useful, if not to provide organs, then to inform medical science.\n\nClaire found it hard to explain the euphoria of being able to breathe freely after surgery and said she was so overcome by the experience she would have died happy soon afterwards. When she was allowed outside after several weeks, she wrote she was “unprepared for the stunning effect of the natural world. I cannot believe the colour in the sky, the feeling of the wind and the myriad smells. I smell the dust that trams leave in their wake, the indefinable yet recognisable smell of fresh air (a contrast to the stuffy and chemically laden air in the hospital) and the hint of eucalyptus. I can walk across the road.”\n\nHer recovery was slow. Eventually, she was able to take up the place at university offered to her before the transplant and finished her degree at the age of 27. By this time, she had focused her intelligence and insights on all aspects of organ donation. Over the next few years, she wrote a profound PhD thesis exploring Mary Shelley’s novel \"Frankenstein\" in light of her own experience as a recipient. It’s a great read, available online through the University of Western Australia.\n\nRecipients of donated organs must, for the rest of their lives, take drugs to suppress their immune system so their bodies don’t reject the organs. This, of course, makes recipients vulnerable to all kinds of bacteria, fungi and viruses as well as a range of cancers. The drugs have undesirable side-effects, including high blood pressure, diabetes, increased levels of cholesterol and lipids in the blood, osteoporosis, and cataracts. Claire experienced all of these but said: “Nothing I’ve experienced since transplantation has been as bad as living with advanced congenital heart disease.”\n\nClaire was sad her health made it impossible for her to be a mother but delighted in her sisters’ children. Claire wrote of taking a ride on a Ferris wheel with her two-year-old niece Abbie. “I found myself at sunset, overlooking Fremantle harbour with an exquisite child singing \"Wheels on the Bus\". In print, it seems so little, but for the fact that I was so close to death and therefore so close to never meeting my sisters’ children. I love the process of getting to know each of them, seeing their personalities emerge and seeing more of the narrative of my sisters’ lives than I had ever dared to hope for.”\n\nIn 2014, Claire became an adjunct research fellow at Monash University, joining the team in global and women’s health in the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine. She applied her great skills in literary analysis to the interpretation of research interviews and learnt new skills in public health, contributing to a wide range of research.\n\nHer most recent work, and that to which she was especially committed, was to ensure people confronting the prospect of receiving a donated heart or lungs could watch videos on the internet of recipients prepared to describe their experiences in detail. She (with her friend and colleague Maggie Kirkman) completed six lengthy interviews and uploaded them in a format that makes them searchable.\n\nShe contributed her own story to the collection. Her colleagues are determined to seek further funding to extend and refine this project.\n\nClaire was witty, warm, brave, insightful, and intelligent. She said, because of the donated heart and lungs, she “had so much joyful living”. She was a generous colleague, friend, daughter, sister and wife. She and Ian enjoyed a particularly close partnership.\n\nShe was admitted to hospital in September 2020 and suffered diverse and increasing setbacks until her death two days before Christmas. Her family was with her. She is survived by her husband, parents, sisters Anne, Eve, and Zoe, and her sisters’ families.\n\nThis tribute was written by Claire’s friend and colleague Dr Maggie Kirkman, with contributions by Professor Jane Fisher AO."
