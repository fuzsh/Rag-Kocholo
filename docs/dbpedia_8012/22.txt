After fighting around (Klein-)Beneschau (16 April 1945), the division was ready to defend itself on 17 April 1945 with a front to the north-west in the Boorwald (east of Buslawitz) in former Czech fortifications. The division then remained in these bunker positions of the Moravian-Ostrauer protection belt, with a combat group of 18. SS-Freiwilligen-Panzergrenadier-Division „Horst Wessel“ (Kampfgruppe "Schumacher" from 18 April 1945) subordinated to it, with only a few enemy contacts with the loss of Haatsch (21 April 1945) and a break-in at Groß-Darkowitz (25 April 1945) until 27 April 1945. Another enemy attack that day pushed the division southwest via Hultschin to Wrablowetz. In the two days that followed, the division put up stubborn resistance here, only to retreat further. On 1 May 1945, the high-water Oder was crossed near Petershofen and thus also Moravian-Ostrau was abandoned. The remnants of the division again took up positions on the Radwanitz – Peterswald road (2 May 1945). In the days that followed, the defensive front then shifted further south of Moravia-Ostrau. From here the remaining parts of the division went via Wagstadt to Olmütz, which was kept open until 5 May 1945. The further settling to the west was significantly hampered by Czech terrorists and up to the Russian captivity at Iglau – Deutsch-Brod on 12 May 1945 there were still a number of skirmishes with insurgents. The soldiers were then driven in long columns to Brünn and Pressburg and loaded from there to Russia.[2]

Prisoner of war

On 10 May 1945 in Prag, Scherenberg, with a part of his staff in the city, was taken prisoner and eventually deported to Russia. Afer foru years of captivity, torture, hunger and sickness, he was dragged before an MVD military court (Minsk Oblast) and on 30 June 1949 at the end of the show trial routinely sentenced to 25 years of labor camp. On 8 October 1955, as one of the last German soldiers (Spätheimkehrer), he finally returned home, along with General der Panzertruppe Sigfrid Henrici (de), Generalmajor Hermann Grothe and others.

Generalmajor a. D. Scherenberg died during a spa stay in Villach (Carinthia) on 10 September 1960, when he suffered a heart attack while swimming. The "Hamburger Abendblatt" reported on 13 September 1960, that the deceased was to be transferred to his place of residence in Hamburg for the purpose of burial.[3] The family Scherenberg, at the time, lived in a very wealthy part of Hamburg, in Blankenese (Am Sorgfeld 98). The widow's last known address in Hamburg was Alsterdorfer Straße 481.
