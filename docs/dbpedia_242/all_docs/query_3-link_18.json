        "text": "CHI 2006: Using Intelligent Task Routing and Contribution Review to Help Communities Build Artifacts of Lasting Value\n\nDan Cosley (I think):\n\nHere are the takeaways I hope you will get from my talk:\n\nArtifacts of lasting value matter.\n\nDesigning for contribution is interesting.\n\nModeling value over time is useful.\n\nIntelligent task routing works.\n\nCommunities like IMDB, RateYourMusic (35,000 people), and Wikipedia are building collective artifacts of lasting value. But not all communities succeed. Nupedia, how many smaller groups have faltered. Grouplens is kinda failing because everyone is using a different format.\n\nOften, one enthusiastic guy does all this work of setting up the system, inviting users, maintaining, etc. You know, like Chad adds all the movies in MovieLens.\n\nBut you ideally want many people to do work. The virtues of the many: Scale (SlashDot), Speed (Wikipedia repairs < 3min), Robustness.\n\nBut... users say, \"I don't want to add movies, I want them to be there for me.\"\n\nCommunityLab is researchers from CMU, UMich and UMinn. We contribute theory insights and design ideas.\n\nI want to talk about creating value in a specific community, the MovieLens community. When we started this project we had 8800 movies x 8 fields = 70,000 fields to fill, 23,000 of which were empty.\n\nHow to do it? Part I of my talk is about contribution reviews. We know that editing improves quality. Very often, in an editing process, you don't see the internals. You don't see how the sausage is made - it's pre-publication review. Wiki-like processes let people publish right away. We wondered which of those models (let people provide information and add a reviewing step, or not) would help the fields fill up faster. We tested it empirically.\n\nAs it turns out, wiki-like beats pre-publication review short term, and in both cases contributions taper over time. In the wiki model, quality hits an equilibrium, a steady state where the good elements and bad elements balance each other. Our model says that in the long run, it actually doesn't matter if review is pre- or post-publication - you reach the same state.\n\nPart II of my talk is about intelligent task routing. How do people find tasks to perform in the system? Randomly (e.g. Slashdot metamoderation), chronologically, alphabetically? These kinda suck.\n\nYou want to help people find work they want to do. People often work on their interests - match people with tasks they'll like. Karay & Williams' collective effort model deals with social loafing. They posit that people decide whether to contribute according to how much it benefits them, the group, and whether the contribution matters to the group.\n\nWe assigned people to four groups; in each group people were given tasks according to different algorithms. We found that four times as many contributions were made into MovieLens if we asked them to fill in information about movies they were among the few to have seen. \"This Needs Work\" did not work so well as a motivator in terms of number of movies, but if you count the fields filled it's pretty good.\n\nBased on this work I made SuggestBot, which suggests Wikipedia articles you might like to edit, and is intended to optimize participant contributions.\n\nQ. (Alain DÃ©silets, NRC) You asked people to edit movies they had not seen?\n\nA. Yes, 3 of the 4 groups didn't depend on whether they had seen the movie.\n\nQ. (me) So your model predicted that eventually the good slows down and the bad balances it out - does that mean that eventually there are effectively no contributions being made to the system? Do you assume that the amount of uncharted territory is constant?\n\nA. (The answers confused me. I think Dan basically said \"yes, sorta\" to both questions.)\n\n2:14:16 PM CHI 2006: Games & Performance session\n\nAlone Together? Exploring the Social Dynamics of Massively Multiplayer Online Games is the title of a very interesting study of World of Warcraft (WoW) social dynamics by Nicolas Ducheneaut and collaborators. The talk was given in an overcrowded room. I was standing and couldn't take notes.\n\nBasically they used WoW's open API to scrape data about hundreds of thousands of players on five servers, registering who was present where and when and what character they were playing. The paper is surely worth a look if you're interested in online social interaction patterns from data. If you dislike PDFs, a few of the findings seem to be in this blog post. Big kudos to the team for doing their research openly on the playon blog!\n\nNext I listened to a talk about Interweaving Mobile Games With Everyday Life, which dealt with an urban multiplayer PocketPC game called Feed the Yoshi. It gave me some game ideas for the Ile Sans Fil community wireless project. Something to discuss with Michael... Transcript follows.\n\nPresenter: We had two foci in this work:\n\nWeaving ubiquitous computing into 'the fabric of everyday life\". What happens if you use a system over a long time?\n\nSeams and seamful design. Seams are gaps and 'losses in translation' in digital media. We actually argue for seamful design.\n\nWiFi varies in position, range and access controls. There are gaps, overlaps, passwords, fees for commercial hotspots, legal constraints. Those are Seams.\n\nWe made a game that exploits seamful design. It's implemented on PDAs (HP iPAQs) so you can play everywhere. The game is called Feeding Yoshi. A Yoshi is a critter that eats fruit. Players feed them for points. You can also sow seeds at empty plantations. Fruits grow in them, and you can pick them up and put them on your basket. Yoshis and plantations are scattered across the city. Players carry fruit to the Yoshis. Yoshis and plantations are 802.11 access points. Yoshis are actually locatedat secure access points and plantations are at open points.\n\nHere's a map of Glasgow, we did some wardriving and found 483 points. You get more points for feeding Yoshis multiple fruits. You can swap fruits with other players.\n\nPoints are submitted to the game web site via 'codes'. The site shows a leaderboard. The game uses p2p ad-hoc networks.\n\nTo study Yoshi, we had 4 teams of 4 in Derby, Nottingham and Glasgowplay it over 7 days. Players had various backgrounds. Our data comes fromdiaries, interviews, logs.\n\n(Shows a video diary of a player beginning his day, leaving for work, finding a strawberry tree.)\n\nOverall the players found the game fun to play, engaging, worth taking time out for.\n\nPatterns of play reflected life/work styles. There was a large spread in the length of play sessions. Journeys were often good for play. Players built an understanding of where the Yoshis and plantations were on their routes to work. One player came up with the concept of the 'Drive-by Yoshi', wherein a friend would drive himaround and he could rack up points efficiently.\n\nWork was actually both a resource and a constraint. You could use work's WiFi. People's jobs sometimes allowed them to take breaks, be late, slip out. Work habits were not a predictor of success.\n\nThe coupling with location led to awareness of urban character and conversation with other players. On crowded streets players would \"run into folks\". There were distinctive patterns of movement - shuttling back and forth, etc. People felt uneasy just hanging around suburban homes, and uncomfortable in industrial and business districts. Some areas were felt \"too dangerous to play in\".\n\nThe social setting affects coordination and collaboration, both with other players and with non-players. One player's movement patterns annoyed his girfriend greatly. Play eventually bridged teams, even though members of the different teams didn't know one another.\n\nReflections. Should players be forced to move out of rich areas? It might encourage mobility. Were some locations 'too good'? Should we support play 'at speed'?\n\nFuture work involves seams in software and eHealth.\n\nThis was the first study of a long-term mobile game. The quality of play was flexible with everyday life. Players augmented existing routines and established new ones.\n\nIf you have any questions I'm sure my coauthors will be really happy to answer them. :)\n\nQ. You didn't actually require transmission over the hotspots? So you could have tied this to arbitrary locations.\n\nA. We wanted people to actually learn something about wireless networks.\n\nQ. This work is a great opportunity for exploration. Glasgow gets a lot of rain. Have you thought about extra rewards for people who go out and feed the Yoshis in the pouring rain? Have you thought about introducing a predator?\n\nA. They're cool ideas. The first I'm sure we could implement using weather reports. If the game had more characters, some of which are unveiled over time, it might make the game more interesting.\n\nQ. Tell us about how much people modified their normal routine?\n\nA. At the end most people told us they actually altered their routine.\n\nQ. How long does it take for plantations to grow?\n\nA. It's immediate.\n\nQ. Have you considered making them more tamagochi-like, where you can have your yoshis grow and evolve\n\nA. We did. (Said some more things.)\n\nQ. What are the system requirements?\n\nA. You can download the game for any PocketPC from the website. We'vegot thousands of downloads, it's getting quite popular.\n\nQ. (Google guy). This looks like a great way of providing incentives for people to go to certain locations, open their wifi networks, etc.\n\nA. Well, there's probably a business in there. Thank you!\n\n2:35:10 PM CHI 2006: Scott Cook (Intuit)\n\nThe CHI conference is in my hometown this week, and Socialtext is graciously sending me downtown to learn some stuff. Intuit founder Scott Cook opened the conference. Here are my notes from his talk.\n\n[Update: what follows is more of an impressionistic transcript; Antonella Pavese put up a really nice \"annotated reconstruction\" of Scott Cook's CHI talk, complete with pictures and all - go see it!]\n\nSpeaker intro (paraphrased): In 1984 Scott Cook founded Intuit, which makes the famously successful Quicken software and is among the first companies to have a public wiki, the Tax Almanac.\n\nScott Cook: Je suis heureux d'etre ici aujourd'hui. Mon francais... not so good. In preparing for this, my wife told me not to worry about being charming, clever or intellectual. \"Just be yourself\", she said.\n\nOne of the best examples of game-changing invention hails from here in Quebec. Guy Laliberte founded Cirque du Soleil 25 years ago. It became a huge business. They did this in a market that anyone would have said was down. They were asking for more money than the Wringley Brothers were asking. They didn't steal Wringley's customers. They invented a new kind of entertainment.\n\n3M used to sell sandpaper. Employee Dick Drew was in an automobile shop, heard a worker complain that he couldn't remove the tape without taking the fresh paint off, too. Then he'd need to sand a lot. This led him to invent the masking tape (even though his boss didn't want him to), and later on, the cellophane tape, which turned 3M into a huge business.\n\nSaid Peter Drucker: \"The bottleneck is always at the top of the bottle\".\n\nWhat kind of company are you building? That depens on your model of innovation. Here are five: (1) the lone genius (the Edison / Bell model); (2) the boss is the genius (popular among some Silicon Valley CEOs); (3) copy competitors' inventions; (4) Cloister the geniuses in a lab - but the innovation never seems to make it into a product; (5) make your people the geniuses.\n\nThe model I prefer is the last one. The people who are in close contact with customers are the unit of innovation. Managers' jobs are to create the greenhouse, enable those little teams to form around customer needs.\n\nDilbert slides in which a VP of marketing gets punched and spit on elicits general laughter.\n\nLook at the evolution of shipping. By 1960 this industry had reached an apex with the NS Savannah, nuclear-powered cargo ship. Malcolm McLean was a trucker who observed tremendous amounts of delay in transferring merchandise: unloading and loading to and from ships. In the mid-50s he sold his truck company. He bought a rusty old tanker, the SS Maxton, which he put a flat bed on so he could put rectagular containers. SS's maiden voyage was 50 years ago last week.\n\nContainerized freight revolutionized shipping. The cost used to be $6 a ton. Containerized freight costs 16 cents a ton. There are today millions of people in Asia who owe their middle-class status to Mr. McLean. He didn't focus on the speed of the ship, he focused on speed of loading and unloading.\n\nAnyone with a science background should read Kuhn. It explains how some young scientist, generally under 30, invents a new paradigm that nobody believes in at first but is eventually embraced by all. Germ theory, Copernicus, etc. That's science.\n\nIntuit's mission is \"to change lives so profoundly that people cannot imagine going back to the old way\".\n\nHere's the story of how we moved from Quicken to QuickBooks. We had less than half the features and were selling at twice the price of the market leaders. The advertising was terrible. Our first ad, I wrote. It was a catastrophe. Second was an ad firm, which produced probably the worst ad in history. Exposed to a million readers. We got 4 responses.\n\nThat's the brilliant launch of QuickBooks in 92. Here's how it happened. In one monthe we got to 70% market share. What explains this? It wasn't the advertising. It was something we discovered along the way. We used to make a home consumer product. We surveyed our users, and 40% said they were using our product \"in an office\". We surveyed again. Same results. We actually called those people.\n\nWhat we discovered was that most people hate debit/credit accounting. Everyone else who made accounting software had debits and credits. What we did was build the first accounting software without debits/credits.\n\nQuickBooks revenue growth over 13 years looks great. (note: QuickBooks services grow a lot towards the end.) Here are some of the teams who were responsible for this (shows pictures).\n\nSuccess starts with humility. \"Empathy is not just about walking in anothr's shoes... first you must remove your own shoes.\" (There's a variant of that quote, \"Never criticize a man till you've walked a mile in his shoes. That way, when you criticize him, you're a mile away and you have his shoes.\")\n\nWhat business operates in over 100 countries, has grown 10,000% since 1970, serves 500 million people, volume > $1 trillion annually? Dee Hock's VISA. Hock says, \"The problem is never how to get new, innovative thoughts into your mind, but how to get old ones out. Every mind is a room packed with archaic furniture.\"\n\nGet face-to-face with your customers. In their office, in their home. Find out what's happening.\n\nThe Intuit process is: (1) Involve UX, (2) Find the Customer Problem, (3) Define the requirement, (4) Build.\n\nIRS mails 8 billion pages of tax forms and instructions each year. They could circle the globe 28 times. Americans spend > $200 billion, more hours than it takes to make every car and truck in the US, on taxes.\n\nWhen you look at market share, we look good, but compared to manual, there's still a lot of people doing it by hand or not using software. We identified 5 taxpayer types and found that TurboTax had 2 of them well covered. The \"Worry warts\", who want to do their own taxes together with a tax preparer, have different needs. Our design for TurboTax Personal Pro was to \"put an expert in the box\". You can get into live conversations with experts while doing your taxes.\n\nLook at the fancy underwear business. Victoria's Secret's share was flat at just over 20%. They went to the customers' houses, combed through their underwear drawers. On the vast majority of occasions, women didn't wear their product. Discovery: sexy underwear isn't thought of as comfortable. This led to Body by Victoria, seamless underwear. This has been huge, it is not the best-selling product line - their share doubled to 45%.\n\nFollow the customers while they work. All of us at Intuit do this. Executives do this. We post pictures and reports in the office when we come back. Drucker's Seven Sources of Innovation: the most reliable is The Unexpected. That's what you see when you follow the customers.\n\nRaid had perfected a slow-action formula. The idea was to leave a slight trail, that bugs would get some on themselves and it would not kill them instantly, so they could make it back to the nest and kill the other bugs. They observed that users would not leave a slight trail to the nest: they would drown the one bug in front of them before it could make it back to the nest. So they diluted in a lot of water so it was hard to kill the bug and so the stench wasn't overpowering. Sales up 50%, in an old, established market. And the bugs now survive the flood and can bring the product back to bring down the nest.\n\nQuickBooks Point of Sale. We didn't think it could work. Users needed to get too much hardware. Despite my resistance, we made a version with hardware. The version with the hardware is twice the price of the other, but it's selling twice more than the other.\n\nThe best we can hope to bat is .500. If you're getting better than that, you're not swinging for the fences. Even Barry bonds, steroids or not, is not getting that. We need to celebrate failure. Failures are shitty but they let us learn. Here is me hugging the guy who won the Greatest Failure award. There was a learning from what he did. His failed effort produced the learning that young users don't care about taxes, but they do care about the refund.\n\nWhat happens when you have a battle between financial metrics and customer metrics? Typically the customer metric gets blown off. You need a solid customer metric. Andy Taylor, Enterprise Rent-a-Car: \"The only way to grow your business is to get your customers to recommend to a friend.\" Ask your customers if they would recommend you to a friend. 9's and 10's are promoters. Get your business a Net promoter score. There is a clear relation to 3 or 5-year revenue growth. The winners actually get back to detractors, the people who rate them in the bottom half of the scale (\"would not recommend\").\n\nAmong our smallest customers, QuickBooks didn't really deliver what they needed. So we looked at tiny businesses. They needed something simpler. In our Simple Start, \"Accounts Receivable\" came to be called \"Money In\", etc. Simple Start is successful.\n\n1. Invention comes from mindset change.\n\n2. Mindset change comes from seeing differently.\n\n3. Savor surprises... as learnings.\n\n4. Focus managers on a customer metric.\n\n5. Nurture and protect invention teams. Optimize for these teams.\n\nThere is another taxpayer type, who likes it simple. Here's the simplest tax form. This one line, requires you to go into th 50-page guide, and you need this page, this one, this one and this one. This is not easy. Only the IRS would call it easy. Here is one prototype they called Taxtasy. It became SnapTax. That idea was invented by a QA person.\n\n\"The boundaries between disciplines blur, and that's how things work best\"\n\nTeams without barriers. There are cases where you want to prevent management from interfering. Questions can kill an entrepreneurial team. There's only a few questions from management that are actually worth asking.\n\nHere's Dan Robinson, an engineer on the Quicken team. His child was born with medical problems. Our medical insurance paid, so cash was not the problem. But the paperwork was amazingly complex. Dan decided this was a real problem we needed to work on. I didn't think we could do it. Others didn't either. But Dan got green lights because he kept answering the questions. The result is the Quicken Medical Expense Manager. (shows user interview excerpt)\n\nQuestions and answers\n\nQ. Skills? A. We need people who care, and have curiosity. The best people are those who say \"I don't want to see the requirements, I want to see the customers\" and will stand for what they know is right.\n\nQ. Usability testing? A. in 1994 we hired the Palo Alto Junior Leaders to do usability testing. The users were totally stumped by what we thought was obvious. No matter how easy the design team believes it is... Simplicity sells. Our real insight was how something that was so obvious for us was so hard for customers.\n\nQ. Basic academic research? A. I think so much invention is needed, especially in an interdisciplinary area like this. I think our eyes will open through research, and the companies will then figure out how to answer the needs.\n\nQ. Governments? A. The idea of having the government actually watch how citizens operate would be so eye-opening.\n\nQ. I work at a small place. How to change the culture from the bottom when the top level doesn't get it? A. A lot of great things happen through guerilla efforts. I think you don't need your boss's approval to talk to customers. this is not expensive stuff. If the company really gets in your way, you may have to go elsewhere.\n\nQ. Do you agree that short-to-medium-term innovation can be customer-driven, but not long-term? Can you go too far in customer focus? A. I think you can't go too far in customer focus, but you can have wrong directions. Some orgs are addicted to surveys, but surveys actually reflect your current mindset. The best insights don't come from quantitative data. As regards the long-term. I agree that customers do not foresee the future. Use the consumer to understand the problem that you are solving. Then it's your job to build it. Of course consumers would never have asked for computers in their homes. Do you remember typewriters, when you made a mistake, it was hell? This was clearly a problem, one that computers can solve really well.\n\nQ. International? A. Automobiles in Japan are used so differently than they are here. In Japan you can have one car for a family of 5 drivers. Nissan sent researchers directly to see families. They got into trouble when an American family figured that the Japanese student they were hosting was actually studying them!\n\nTag: chi2006\n\n8:30:08 AM"
