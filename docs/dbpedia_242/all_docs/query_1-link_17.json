        "text": "I am only giving this resort 3 stars because there were a lot of little things that added up to making this resort a disappointment. This resort was not a fit for OUR family - my review is based on that and based in comparison to other all inclusive resort experiences (ranging from 3 stars to 4.5 - I have never stayed at a luxury resort). We were three families traveling with kids ranging in age from 4 to 17.\n\nWe were greeted by front desk ladies who did not smile. It was quick and efficient but not friendly. In fact the one lady was down right miserable. We asked to be located close to each other but we were dispersed all over the resort. This is a large resort so my sister in Building 6 was quite a distance from my friend in Building 1. Infact, Building 5 and 6 are behind the resort - there is a back alley that separates those buildings from the main resort and its the farthest from the ocean. My sister asked for her teenager's room to be next to theirs but they put them four doors away and they would not accommodate them. A water main broke in our friend's room one evening and they had to be relocated. The rooms are old and outdated. You hear that a lot in reviews about most resorts but I have stayed in Cuba, where you expect this and I have stayed at a 3 star resort in Cozumel and none of them were as old and plain as this 4.5 star. It was a disappointment.\n\nThe keys to your room are the old fashioned big metal keys with your room number on them, attached to a string that goes around your neck. If you lost your room key, anyone could get into your room as the number is printed on it. It was a pain to carry around. You have to pay for the safe, which worked out to be about $25 CDN for the week. Again, the key is a big old metal key that you put on the same string. Not a code. I am not sure what it would cost if you lost either. I have never had to pay for a safe and I would think this should be part of your all inclusive fee. If your bracelet broke and you lost it, it would cost you to replace it. If you lost your towel or a towel card, it was $50 each. There are no mini fridges in your room and you are given one bottle of water. You can purchase additional ones at the store or if you tipped your maid, she might leave you another bottle. I found these things to be chincy and that it felt like you were nickle and dimed.\n\nOur room was not cleaned until 4 pm each day and our sheets were never changed. I had face cloths for one day and then never again after that. We were given clean towels every day though.\n\nThe buffet food is fabulous. We enjoyed every single meal and the BBQ buffet they had one night was really the highlight. You have to be up at between 6 and 7 am to get in line to reserve the al a carte's and only 2 at a time. Because we had more than 6 people in our group, one person from two different rooms had to make the reservation. That was their rule. There was a whole list of rules for pretty much everything. We couldn't just send one of our family members down to wait - we had to send two. Seemed a bit silly. We went to the Thai restaurant and found that it was good but the buffets really were much better, so we cancelled our second al a carte at the Japanese restaurant, which is attached and has a similar menu. The grounds are kept immaculate. The public areas are clean. Wifi is free is the lobby bar, the main lobby and Building 4 lobby. It was spotty but it did the trick to send the odd imessage home. It took sometime to load certain pages but if you really don't care about updating your social media sites, then this won't be an issue. I believe you can pay to have wifi in your room but we never did.\n\nThere is no around the pool or beach drink service. You must get your own - this is not a deal breaker for us but depending on where you are on the beach, its a bit of a walk. If you do not have a mug with a lid, they may get after you if you have your drinks in the pool or on the ledge. Our kids were asked not to jump in the pool. They were asked not to jump on their floaties. We called them the fun police. They were quite strict and not friendly. There are no swim up bars. The drinks are ok - for the most part, they know how to make everything but the ratios of mixing can be off. I am a beer drinker and they only had Modano on tap - its not the greatest. Our friends actually went up town and purchased their own beer for the week. They do not serve mojitos or mimosas. There is no clamato. One thing that was a big hit was the pottery table at Pool No. 1. You could purchase a piece of pottery for painting and the kids loved this! It was between 120-225 pesos a piece.\n\nThe beach is beautiful - you can walk for miles in either direction and right into Bucerias from the resort. However, the jellyfish and stingray warning was up the entire time we were there. Our kids played in the water but after they saw someone stung by a jellyfish and they each had sting rays hit them in the water, they were scared to go back in. That was a disappointment because we are ocean people. I am used to the Caribbean Sea, so the murky ocean water is a down grade but the waves are fun for older kids - one of our 16 year olds got taken down hard and suffered some \"road rash\". If you like to parasail (800 pesos each), rent seadoos, banana boats etc, you can do that from the beach. You can take out boogie boards as well but only for half an hour - no charge. It was mostly too windy to kayak. The biggest annoyance was the vendors. You did not get a break from them. I have never been on a beach where they were in constant stream. All of them were very good - you said no thank you and they went on their way but it was a revolving door of them and even if you put your head down to read, they would interrupt to ask you if you wanted to buy. This was annoying when you want to sit and enjoy your family time or relax. We went to Fat Boys for supper one night in Bucerias and it was the same thing - constant stream of vendors through the restaurant while we were having our meal. Its just a bit too much in this area.\n\nThe nightly shows are a bit lame and when I asked the front desk one night if they had a weekly program of the shows so we could plan our week as to what we wanted to see, I was told no. I asked if she knew what the show was the next night and she claimed they didn't know what the shows were going to be until each morning. However, she was on a personal call and I felt like she was just trying to get rid of me so maybe they did? One night we went to what ended up being the Latino show. Again, there was no board or sign outside that said what was playing. One of the acts consisted of five male dancers doing a magic mike routine and ended it by taking their pants off. I'm talking grinding the stage, putting their shirts between their legs, pelvic thrusting....you get the picture. Now this would have been fine if I was there without my 10, 13 and 14 year old niece and nephew but definitely not appropriate for pre-teens. I apologized to my sister for taking her children to a strip show! Little did I know....\n\nWe went into Bucerias one evening and my nephew left his phone in the cab on the trip in. He noticed it missing immediately and we went back to the hotel to find the cab - despite being told by the cab driver, the cab co-ordinators and the front desk that we were the cabbies' last fare, the phone disappeared and the cab driver claimed he did not have it. Hmmmm.....Because the resort contracts their OWN cabs to service JUST the Decameron, this is disappointing. Be careful that you do not leave anything in the cab. It will not be returned to you.\n\nThe bars around the resort at night are quiet - there really isn't even any music playing or any dancing - you have to go to the disco for that, which we never did because we had 17 year olds that weren't allowed in with us. One night we hooked up our own phone to a speaker at one of the bars and we had people wander over to dance with us and sing. The speaker was not very good and it wouldn't play very loud. Again, they are quite strict. There really isn't much in the way of organized day activities either. No one comes around to say - hey we have this going on in Pool 2 - want to join? There are no water volleyball nets. One pool plays music. You have to make or bring your own entertainment. There is a very quiet adult pool if you want dead silence. There was no mexican fiesta night or foam party or beach party - or anything organized like that.\n\nThe staff are polite and courteous but they don't interact with you alot. We had the odd server or the odd bar tender that would joke a bit but for the most part - they are doing a job and they aren't interested or allowed to have a camaraderie with the guests. Again - it felt very strict with lots of rules. When I took my kids to Cozumel two years ago, the entertainment staff had formed such a bond with my kids - everyone was hugging and crying on our last day. You will not get a connection like that at this resort.\n\nI would say this resort is more for mature adults, retired folks, families with young kids who just want to swim in a pool. It doesn't have much for older kids or teenagers or for young active adults. We aren't party animals but we would have enjoyed some level of excitement apart from a disco.\n\nThere is a late night snack bar and it was quite good - the fries were awesome.\n\nAll in all this resort is clean, its quiet, its comfortable. It was the most I have paid for an all inclusive but for what you get, it was not worth the cost. Especially when we had to pay adult prices for our three 17 year olds and got grilled by security one day for allowing them to have the odd alcoholic drink. I was not impressed - yes they are minors but they were under supervision of parents, in our presence at all times, they were not drinking in excess and everyone in our group was behaving responsibly and respectfully. No one was drinking excessively. Lighten up.\n\nRead more"
