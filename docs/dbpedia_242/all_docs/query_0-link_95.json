INTRODUCTION. GENERAL STATEMENT. The Census and Statistics Act, 1905, provided in addition to the general decennial census for all Canada for the taking of a census of population and agriculture in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta in 1906, and in every tenth year thereafter. In accordance with the Act, a census of the population and agriculture of these provinces was taken as of date, June 1, 1916, and the résulta are presented in this volume. For Manitoba, it was the ninth census since the province had been created in 1870; for Saskatchewan and Alberta it was the third since they attained to provincial status in 1905. Separate reports giving the main facts relating to population and agricul- ture were prepared and issued for each province early in 1917. Subsequently a bulletin giving the classification of the people according to age, religious beliefs, and racial origins was published. These bulletins gave the most important statistics for the provinces as a whole, with such text as seemed necessary for the proper interpretation of the tables. In accordance ^\\'ith the Census Act each of the three provinces was divided into census districts corresponding with the existing parliamentary electoral districts, and the districts were divided into subdistricts or enumeration areas. Through the co-operation of the Department of Indian Affairs, the census of Indians on reservations was taken by Indian Agents, acting under instruction from the Census and Statistics Office. Appoiîitînents. The Census and Statistics Act provides for the appointment, by Order in Council, of commissioners, enumerators, and other officials required for the taking of the census. For the \"outside service\" of the census of 1916, twelve commissioners were appointed to supervise the work of enumeration in forty of the forty-three electoral distircts into which the Prairie Provinces were divided for purposes of representation in the Federal Parliament by the Redis- tribution Act, 1912; the remaining three districts, comprising Winnipeg North, Centre, and South, being under the direction of !Mr. E. H. St. Denis, Secretary of the Office, by whom the commissioners were instructed in their duties. The following statement gives the names of the commissioners by provinces, together ^\\^th names of the electoral districts placed under their supervision. COMMISSIONERS.

There were employed in making the census enumeration, mider the super- vision of the foregoing commissioners, 1,365 enumerators, of whom 381 were in Manitoba, 537 in Saskatchewan, and .447 in Alberta. In addition to the regular enumerators, the office employed, by arrangement with the Deputy Superin- tendent General of Indian Affairs, the services of 45 Indian Agents — 18 in Manitoba, 16 in Saskatchewan, and 11 in Alberta. In the northern parts of the districts of Nelson in Manitoba, of Prince Albert and North Battleford in Saskatchewan, and of East and West Edmonton in Alberta, the enumeration was made by members of the NorthAvest Mounted PoHce acting as officials of the Census and Statistics Office. The following statement gives, by electoral districts for each province, the number of enumerators, exclusive of Indian Agents and Mounted Pohce, employed in making the house-to-house canvass in each of the Prairie Provinces, 1916.

Totals 381 537 447 Method of Making Record. Three schedules were used in collecting the data of population and agricul- ture. Schedule No. 1 was similar to that used in previous censuses and was de- voted wholly to a record of the population by name, age, sex, origin, religion, birthplace, occupation, year of immigration, citizenship, language spoken, and literac3^ There was also a special column provided to procure the enumeration of all persons domiciled in the Prairie Provinces who had enlisted for military service and were either in concentration camps in Canada or had gone overseas. Enumerators were specifically required to make inquiry in every household whether any person, who was a member of the family or had made that house- hold his or her home had enlisted for military service. The large number of entries of names of persons who had enlisted and were marked \"O\" for over- seas or \"C\" for training camps in Canada is evidence that the enumerators effectively carried out the \"instructions\" in this regard which read as follows:— Military Service. — The enumerator will make diligent inquiry in every household or family he visits, whether any person (father, son, brother, roomer, or other person) belonging to this household or family has enlisted for active service. If such persons have gone overseas they CENSUS OF PRAIRIE PROVINCES, 1916 xiii will be indicated in column 4 by the letter \"O\" for overseas; if in con- centration or training camp in Canada, by the letter ''G\" for Canada, giving name and location of camp in Column 8. Only those on military service June 1, 1916, and, so far as known, living on that date, are to be enumerated. Schedule No. II was designed to obtain the information concerning farm property, field crops, animals, and animal products. In this census the agricul- tural record of each farm appeared on an individual form — one for each farm. In previous censuses the schedules were designed to contain the record of 100 farms, and five schedules were employed to enumerate the various items relating to farm lands, acreage, production and values of field crops, animals and animal products. The results obtained, in the last census, amply justified the adoption of the individual schedule for the enumeration of agricultural statistics. Schedule No. Ill provided for a record of domestic animals, dairy products, and eggs \"not on farms.\" The information on each schedule was obtained from the person or persons who had immediate and personal knowledge of the facts sought for by the census. The returns were revised, edited, and compiled in the Office, and the results are presented in this volume under two main heads: Part I, Population; and Part II, Agriculture. POPULATION. Both in the general tables and in the introduction, wherever possible, the statistics of 1916 are given in comparison with those of earlier enumerations. The total population of the three provinces in 1916 is returned as 1,698,220, compared with 1,328,725 in 1911, 808,863 in 1906, and 419,512 in 1901. The population of the Prairie Provinces increased bj' 1,278,708 or 305 per cent in the 15 years 1901-16, by 889,357 or 110 per cent m the ten years 1906-16 and by 369,495 or 28 per cent in the five years ended June 1, 1916. The progress of the Prairie Provinces is strikingly illustrated bj' the fact that during the ten years 1906-16 they had increased their population, and perforce that of Canada, bj^ 889,357, whereas the total increase shown for the whole Dominion by the Fourth Census for the decade ended Alarch, 1901, was only 538,076 or smaller by 351,281 than the addition made to the population of the Dominion by the Prairie Provinces in the ten years ended June, 1916. B}^ provinces, during the last quinquennium, the greatest absolute increase in population was made by Saskatchewan with 155,403, followed by Alberta with 121,862, and by ^Manitoba with 92,230, while the largest per cent of increase was made by Alberta with 32-5 per cent, followed by Saskatchewan with 31-6 per cent, and Manitoba with 20 per cent. The following statement gives the population of each of the Prairie Pro- vinces by five-3'ear periods, 1901-16, and the increase absolute and per cent made by each province, first from 1906 to 1916 and secondly from 1911 to 1916: — Provinces Population 1901 1906 1911 1916 Increase for 1916 over 1906 Increase for 1916 over 1911 Manitoba NO. 255,211 91,279 73.022 NO. 365,688 257,763 185,412 NO. 461,630 492,4.32 374.663 NO. 553.860 647,835 496.525 NO. 188,172 390,072 311,113 p.c. 51-5 151-3 167-8 NO. 92,230 155,403 121,862 p.c. 200 Saskatchewan 31-6 Alberta ^. . .32-5 419,512 808,863 1.328,725 1,698,220 889,357 109-9 369,495 27-8 xiv CENSUS OF PRAIRIE PROVINCES, 1916 In 1901 Manitoba alone of the Prairie Provinces had provincial status and contained 255,211 persons, or nearly 61 per cent of the total population (419,512) of the Prairie Provinces at that date. In 1906, the year following the creation of the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, Manitoba still maintained its lead with 45-2 per cent of the total population of these provinces, followed by Saskatchewan with 31-9 per cent and Alberta with 22-9 per cent. In the cen- suses of 1911 and 1916, Saskatchewan took first place, possessing 37-1 per cent in the former census and 38-2 per cent in the latter of the total population; Manitoba dropped to second place, with 34-7 in 1911 and 32-6 per cent in 1916. The proportion of the total population of the Prairie Provinces possessed at the several censuses by each of the three provinces is given in the next statement : — Provinces Census i'ears 1901 1906 1911 1916 Total 100 0 60-8 21-8 17-4 100 0 452 31-9 22-9 100-0 34-7 371 28-2 100 0 32-6 38-2 29-2 Table 1 gives the population of the three provinces at each census since 1901, and for Manitoba since 1870, together with the increase shown by each census over the preceding one. Of the total increase (389,351) in population, from 1901 to 1906, males constituted 237,303 or nearly 61 per cent, and females better than 39 per cent. At the end of the next five years (census 1911), of the total increase (519,862) males contributed- 58 • 2 per cent and females 41-8 per cent. The returns of the 1916 census show that for the five y-ears ended June, 1916, females have con- tributed more largely than have males to the increase of 369,495 in population, males making up 45 • 1 per cent and females 54 • 9 per cent. For the three provinces as a whole males increased by 103-6 per cent and females by 79-8 per cent from 1901 to 1906. At the end of the next five years (1911) the ratio of increase for both sexes was nearly equal being 64-88 per cent for males and 63-44 per cent for females, whereas in the last census (1916) females gave, for the three provinces as a whole, an increase of 202,618 as against 166,877 for males, being a gain of 36-19 per cent for the former in five years, as compared with 21-71 per cent for the latter. The records of 1916 show that this feature of population increase was common to each of the three pro- vinces. The per cent increase in Alberta was: females 45-53 per cent, males 23-78 per cent; Saskatchewan, females 41-52 per cent, males 24-70 per cent; Manitoba, females 24-30 per cent, males 16-42 per cent.

Distribution of Population. The distribution of the population of the Prairie Provinces among rural and urban communities is shown in Table 2 for each census year, by provinces, since 1901. In every 1,000 of the population of Manitoba in 1906, the rural sections had 622 persons to 378 in urban centres, ten years later the proportion was rural 565, urban 435. Saskatchewan in 1906 had 812 persons out of every 1,000 living on farms as compared with 188 in urban centres; in 1916 rural parts claimed 728 persons as against urban 272. Out of every 1,000 population in Alberta in 1906, 688 dwelt in rural communities as against 312 in urban parts; in 1916 the ratio was 620 rural to 380 urban. For the three provinces, as a whole, in 1906 the rural communities possessed 698 as compared with 643 per 1,000 in 1916. If the total population of each province was distributed equitably over its land area, Manitoba (exclusive of new extension) would have 8-61 persons per square mile, Saskatchewan 2 • 66, and Alberta 1 • 96 persons per square mile of land. xvi CENSUS OF PRAIRIE PROVINCES, 1916 TABLE 2. — Urban and Rural Population and number of persons per square mile of land area by census years 1901 to 1916 Provinces and Census Year Prairie Provinces 1916 1911 1906 1901 Manitoba— 1916 1911 1906 1901 Sasltatcliewan— 1916 1911 1906 1901 Alberta— 1916 1911 1906 1901 Population Urban Rural Total NO. 606,060 469,422 244,427 103,235 241,014 200,365 138,090 70,436 176,297 131,395 48,462 14,266 188,749 137,662 57,875 18,533 NO. 1,092,160 859,303 564,436 316,277 312,846 261,265 227,598 184,775 471,538 361,037 209,301 77,013 307,776 237,001 127,537 54,489 NO. 1,698,220 1,328,725 808,863 419,512 553,860 461,630 365, 688 255,211 647,835 492,432 257, 763 91,279 496, 525 374,663 185.412 73,022 Per cent of Population Urban Rural p.c. 35-69 35-33 30-22 24-61 43-53 43-40 37-76 27-60 27-21 26-68 18-80 15-63 38-01 36-74 31-21 25-38 p.c. 64-31 64-67 69-78 75-39 56-47 56-60 62-24 72-40 73-32 81-20 84-37 61-99 63-26 68-79 74-62 Increase per cent over preceding Census Urban Rural p.c. 29-13 92 05 136-77 20-34 45-10 96-05 34-17 171-13 239-70 37-11 1-37-86 212-28 p.c. 27-09 52-24 78-46 19-70 14-79 23 18 30-61 72-50 171-77 29-86 85-83 134-06 Population per square mile of land Rural Total NO. 1-95 1-53 101 •56 4-86 406 3-54 2-87 1-94 1-48 •86 •32 1-22 •94 •50 NO. 3-03 2-37 1-44 -75 8-61 7-18 5-68 3-97 2-66 202 1-06 •38 196 1-48 0-73 029 Dwellings and Families. In 1916, the population (1,698,220) of the three provinces was housed in 362,362 dwellings containing 387,334 families as compared with a population of 1,328,725 divided among 300,958 families, occupying 290,466 dwellings in 1911. In 1916 there were, for the three provinces, 106 families to every 100 houses as compared with 104 families to every 100 houses in 1911. The number of families to every 100 houses in 1916 and 1911 was: Manitoba 112 and 106; Saskatchewan 104 and 102; and Alberta 106 and 103, respectively. The size of the family in Alberta (4- 15 persons) was the same in 1916 as in 1911; in Saskatchewan the family was larger in 1916 (4-31) than in 1911 (4-07) while in Manitoba it was smaller (4-71 to 5-13). It will also be noted that the increase in the number of dwellings did not keep pace with the increase in families. For the three provinces, dwellings showed an increase of 24 • 8 per cent, as against an increase of 28-7 per cent in the number of families. In every province the percentage of increase was greater for families than for dwellings for the five years ended June, 1916.

In only four fully organized municipalities of Saskatchewan (Lake Alma, Frontier, Mankota and Oakdale) did the number of families and dwellings correspond. Alberta had six organized municipalities (Boucher, Edson, Grosmont, Laurier, Richdale, and Stewart) and one Local Improvement District (No. 573) where dwellings and families were equal in number. There were, in addition, several ''Unorganized Terri- torial Units\" in Saskatchewan and Alberta where there was a dwelling reported for every family enumerated. In Cities of 10,000 and over. — Table 4 gives a general survey of the den- sity of population in cities of 10,000 and over, June 1, 1916, as well as the ratio of families to dwellings, and the average size of the family. In every one of these cities the size of the family is smaller in 1916 than it was in 1911, the de- crease showing itself for both sexes in every city except St. Boniface, where the number of females to a family was the same at each census. In the case of Regina, the reduction particularly for males, is largely accounted for by the fact that the city had an alleged larger population in 1911 than in 1916. The disparity between the number of families and the number of dwellings has been greatly increased in all the cities of this class during the five years ended June, 1916. In 1911 the nearest approach to a dwelling for eveiy family was made by Brandon, Moosejaw, and Saskatoon, each having fewer than three families in every 100 for whom a dwelling was not provided. In the last census, Moosejaw, with nearly 110 families to every 100 dwellings, approached nearest to having a separate dwelling for every family. In a study of the problem presented l)y the figures of Tal)le 4 it must not be forgotten that the advent of the apartment house and family hotel has made it difficult to get, particularly in the larger cities, an enumeration which will show the real relation of families to dwellings. 33616— B xviii CENSUS OF PRAIRIE PROVINCES, 1916 TABLE 4. — Housing of the people in cities of 10,000 and over in the Prairie provinces, 1916 and 1911 Cities Dwellings Families Families per 100 Dwelling!\" Average Number of Persons Per Dwelling Per Family Males Females Total Brandon 1910 1911 Calgary 1916 1911 Edmonton 1916 1911 Moosejaw 1916 1911 Regina... 1916 1911 Saskatoon 1916 1911 8t.

Table 6 gives the number of cities, towns, and incorporated villages and the population contained within these centres at each census, together with the percentage of the total population of each province that was contained at each census period within the confines of these municipal entities. Manitoba, in 1916, had three cities with a population of 10,000 and over; Winnipeg (163,000), Brandon (15,215), and St. Boniface (11,021); Saskatchewan had three cities of this class, Regina (26,127), Saskatoon (21,048), and Moose- jaw (16,934); Alberta had two, Calgary (56,514) and Edmonton (53,846). The number of towns, since 1906, increased by 12 in Manitoba, by 48 in Saskatche- wan, and by 31 in Alberta. Of the 150 towns in the Prairie Provinces in 1916, Dauphin (3,200), Selkirk (3,399), Transcona (3,356), and Yorkton (3,144) had a population of 3,000 or over. Of the total population of Manitoba, 35-23 per cent dwelt in cities, 6-38 per cent in towns, and 1-91 per cent in villages; in Saskatchewan 12-34 per cent of the people resided in cities, 7-63 in towns, and 7-25 per cent in villages, while the cities, towns, and villages of Alberta contained, respectively, 26-85 per cent, 7-36 per cent, and 3-80 per cent of the total popu- lation.

Table VIII gives the origins of the Canadian born population, and Table X the origins of the immigrant population born in the United States resident in these provinces June 1, 1916. Per cent distribution. — Table 7 gives the per cent distribution l)y origins (a) of the total population, (b) of the population born in Canada, and (c) of that born in the United States. Of the total population of the three provinces more than 57 per cent were of British races. In Manitoba nearly 58 percent, in Saskatchewan 54 • 5 per cent, and in Alberta over 60 per cent were of British races. Among the Canadian born more than 62 per cent in Manitoba and Saskatchewan were of British races, and 64-4 in Alberta. Of the United States born resident in the Prairie Provinces nearly 54 per cent were of British races, 16-6 of German origin, 9-5 per cent Norwegian, while less than 1 per cent reported themselves as of origins represented in the Austro-Hungarian group. 3361 6— Bi XX CENSUS OF PRAIRIE PROVINCES, 1916 TABLE 7. — Per cent proportion the population of each specified origin by nativity is of the total population of each province, 1916 Origins All origins British (races). . .

In Winnipeg, Jews made up more than 8 per cent of the population, Russians (Poles, Russians, and Ukranians) 9 per cent, and German and Austro-Hungarians over 7 per cent. There were 13,473 Jews in Winnipeg, 1,211 in Calgary, 707 in Edmonton and 498 in Regina. Immigrants from southeastern Europe calling themselves Ukranians were found principally in two cities, Winnipeg (6,545) and Edmonton (93). In St. Boniface the French race (4,530) predominates, having 20 more persons than the total returned as English, Irish, Scotch, and Welsh (4,510).

The numbers of those classified under the latter term very closely agree with the population derived from the country which gives its name to the racial groups as in the case of British, French, Belgian, Danish, Dutch, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, and Swedish. On the other hand, persons of German origin, under this heading, totalled 42,281, while only 15,328 gave Germany as their country of birth. Many per- sons of German origin, according to the census records, claimed Russia, Austria- Hungary, or Belgium as their birthplace. Persons of Jewish origin come to us from every European country and the United States, while Poles were found to have been, before emigration, under German, Austrian, or Russian domination. In grouping the population by birthplace, Ukranians should be considered Russians. Further reference to the racial composition of the population, residing in the Prairie Provinces, which was not of Canadian or United States origin will be found in the analysis of the population by birthplace page xxii CENSUS OF PRAIRIE PROVINCES 1916 TABLE 9. — Numbers of each specified origin represented in the population of the Prairie Provinces born in Canada, United States, or elsewhere, census 1916 Origins Canada United States Elsewhere Total British English h-ish Scotch Welsh French German Belgian Auptro-Hungarian Danish Dutch..

The classification of the people of the Prairie Provinces by ages is dealt with in Tables XII to XV. Degree of Accuracy. — It is impossible to claim absolute accuracy for census statistics of ages because (1) some persons do not know their true ages, (2) others appear to deliberately mis-state their age, and (3) in many instances the report of ages is made, not by the owner, but by some other person who may happen to furnish the enumerator with the particulars required on the population schedule. These difficulties, inherent to census taking under normal conditions, were greatly accentuated by the conditions existing at June 1, 1916, especially in the cases of military prospects. There is also a tendency of people to state their ages in round numbers. For example, the number of persons who report them- selves as being 20, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 60 are much greater than those report- ing at the ages immediately preceding or following these years. This pecuUarity of age statistics was referred to in Bulletin XVIII, Census 1911. Proportionate distribution by age periods in 1911 and 1916.^Table 10 affords comparisons of the proportion per 1,000 of the population at certain age periods in 1911 and 1916. During this time the proportion under 10 years for the three provinces increased from 246-5 to 269-6 per thousand. By provinces, the greatest increase for this age period was made l3y Saskatchewan with a gain of 28-5 in the five years. The 10-19 age group showed a falling off in Manitoba and but slight increases for Saskatchewan and Alberta. In the age group 20-34 there was a heavy drop in all the provinces. For the three provinces, the number fell from 319-6 per thousand to 281-1. In the age groups of 35 years and over in all the provinces, the proportion per 1,000 shows an increase in the five years ended June, 1916. The increase in the ratio shown for all the province in the younger age periods and the falling off in the ratio per 1,000 in the age groups 20 to 69 indi- cates that the native-born is becoming the important factor in the increase of population of the Prairie Provinces. It is also a significant fact that the ratio CENSUS OF PRAIRIE PROVINCES, 1916 xxiii per 1,000 of those who have attained the age of 70 3'ears is on the increase in all the Prairie Provinces. Another feature of importance in census taking is the decreased ratio of those for whom \"no age\" was reported by the enumer- ator.

Tables XVII and XVIII deal with the marital condition of the people by certain age groups. Conjugal Condition. Table XVI, page 189, gives the classification of the population according to conjugal condition — single, married, widowed, or divorced; Table XVII, pages 190-194 the number of persons by sex, age periods, and nativity according to their reported conjugal condition, and Table XVIII, pages 195-207, gives similar information for dwellers in cities of 10,000 and over. The census of 1916 having been taken under the stress of war conditions, there may have been a tendency, in some quarters, to state incorrectly civil condition. With so large a proportion of the immigrant population of foreign birth and alien origin, it is probable that some persons of both sexes may have reported themselves as single or married as the supposed exigencies of their case may have demanded. However, taking all contingencies into consideration, it is believed that for both the native and immigrant population the numbers returned as single, married, widowed, or divorced are sufficiently accurate for all practical purposes. Table 13 gives the numerical and per cent distribution of the total popula- tion by sex and conjugal condition of the Prairie Provinces as a whole and for each of them separately in 1911 and 1916. Of the total male population 65-3 per cent were single in 1911 as compared with 62-9 per cent in 1916; while of the total female population 56-4 per cent in the former period as against 55-8 in the latter were single. There were 732 divorced persons, 426 males and 306 females in 1911 as compared with 992 divorcees — 559 males and 433 females, in 1916. The number of divorced persons reported in the census must necessarily fall short of the number of living persons who have been divorced as many of these have remarried and the census reports only the conjugal condition of the people at the time of the enumeration. CENSUS OF PRAIRIE PROVINCES, 1916 xxv Although there was a considerable increase in the actual number of widowed of both sexes, yet the ratio remained practically the same, being 45 per 1,000 in 1911 and 1916 for males, and 73 and 74 per 1,000 for females. The proportion of married males had grown from 336 per 1,000 in 1911 in Manitoba to 364 in 1916. In Saskatchewan and Alberta it stood at 311 and 315 per 1,000 in 1911, as compared with 340 and 356 in 1916. The ratio of married females per 1,000 in 1911 was 383 in Manitoba, 410 in Saskatchewan, and 416 in Alberta; five years later it was 393 in Manitoba, 411 in Saskatchewan^ and 421 in Alberta. The excess of married males over married females at both censuses in the Prairie Provinces is accounted for by the relatively large pro- portion of immigrants comprised in the population.

In Manitol)a the proportion of married males increased from 49- 1 per hundred in 1911 to 55-7 in 1916. Married females were 61-2 per cent of the total female population 15 years of age and over in 1911 as compared with 63-8 per cent in 1916. In both Alberta and Saskat- chewan there was a large increase in the ratio of married to single for 1916 over 1911.

The records of the 1916 census show that no person of either sex under the age of 15 in the Prairie Provinces w^as married; in 1911 one male and 9 females under 15 were so reported. Between the ages of 15 and 19, out of a total, for the three provinces, of 70,132 males 276 were returned as i)eing married 1 widowed and 1 divorced; while among 66,874 females of this age group, 7,458 or more than 11 per cent were married, 18 widowed and 4 divorced. Xearly 86 per cent of males as compared with 45 per cent of females of the ages 20 to 24 were reported unmarried, while in the groups 25 to 34 and 35 to 44 single males represented 44-4 per cent and 21-6 per cent, respectivelj', of the totals at this age. Among females less than 15 per cent of the ages 25 to 34 and only 6-4 per cent of those in the age group 35 to 44 were single. XXVIII CENSUS OF PRAIRIE PROVINCES, 1916 TABLE 16.

In these tables the people are classified by- religious beliefs, precisely as the information was furnished to the enumerators by the people. Although in some instances it was apparent that the people reported themselves as members of a particular congregation instead of a denomination, yet these were not attached to the religious sect which the name given and the locality in which found would suggest, but were given separately as shown in Table XIX, or grouped under the name ''other sects\" as in Tables XX and XXI. The data in Table XX furnish a comparison of the numerical standing of the various denominations or sects in 1911 and 1916 for each of the three provinces. Birthplace. The statistics of the population of the Prairie Provinces in 1916, according to nativity, are given in Tables XXII to XXVI. In 1916, out of a population of 1,698,220 more than 34-5 per cent were born within the Prairie Provinces, as against 28-5 per cent out of a population of 1,328,725 in 1911. The Canadian born, in 1916, constituted 54-6 per cent of the population, British born 16-6 per cent, born in British possessions one-fifth of 1 per cent, or a total of 71 -4 percent Empire born as against 28-6 per cent foreign born. The latter comprised 16-4 per cent European born, 4 per cent Asiatic born, 11-7 per cent American born. CENSUS OF PRAIRIE PROVINCES, 1916 xxix In 1911 the Canadian born was 52 per cent of the total, other British born 17-8 per cent, making a total of 69-8 per cent Empire born; the foreign born consti- tuted 30-2 per cent, of whom the European born was 17-1 per cent, Asiatic born 4 per cent, and the American born 12-6 per cent. The important thing that the statistics of nativity show is, that although the foreign born population had increased from 1911 to 1916 by 84,920 or 21-2 per cent, yet its proportion of the total population during the same period had fallen from 30-2 per cent to 28-6 per cent, and also that the three provinces have increased their ratio of native (provincial) born from 28-5 per cent of the total to 34 • 5 per cent. The proportion of the population of the Prairie Provinces born in the British Islands fell from 17-6 per cent in 1911 to 16-6 per cent in 1916. Table 17 summarizes the population of the Prairie Provinces, as a whole, by nativity. It also shows the numerical and per cent increase made in five years 1911-16, together with the per cent distribution of the population by birthplace.

Population Prairie born. — The total population of Manitoba increased by 20 per cent from 1911 to 1916; during the same period thelManitoba born residing in Prairie Provinces increased by 33-4 per cent; in Saskatchewan, while the total population increased by 31 -5 per cent from 1911 to 1916, the Saskatchewan born improved its position in the three provinces by 83-4 per cent; Alberta showed a gain of 32-5 per cent in population from 1911 to 1916 whereas the proportion of those born within the province and residing in the three provinces increased by 70-5 per cent. The Canadian born in the three provinces totaled 926,423 in 1916 as against 690,938 in 1911, being a gain of 235,485 or 34 1 per cent. Of the total Canadian born resident in the Prairie Provinces in 1916, 585,904 were born in the provinces of residence as against 378,711 in 1911. Of the total gain of 235,485 in the Canadian ])orn })opulation resident in the three provinces, 207,193 was contributed by the provinces themselves; and of the total increase of population (369,495) in the five years 1911-U), tlie prairie born represented more than 56 per cent. CENSUS OF PRAIRIE PROVINCES, 1916 Relation of birthplace to racial origin. — Table XXV shows the origins of the population of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta who were born in Canada, the United States or Elsewhere; for those included under the heading \"Elsewhere\" the racial designation is believed to represent more important information than the accident of birthplace. (See Table XXII for detailed classification of the population by birthplace.) For example, although many persons of German origin gave their birthplace as Russia or Belgium or Austria- Hungary or Switzerland or France, nevertheless the ethnic relationship is the important and dominant factor. Moreover, after the close of the present struggle, it is possible that the country of origin of many European peoples resident in Canada may be known by a different name to that accepted at the last census. It is worthy of note that of the 197,855 persons born in the United States and resident in the Prairie Provinces, 106,386 or 53-7 per cent were of British races and 10,972 or 5-5 per cent of French origin. In the case of British races, those included under \"Elsewhere\" were nearly all born in the British Islands or British possessions (Canada excepted). The number who claimed Germany as ther birthplace dropped from 18,696 in 1911 to 15,328 in 1916. On the other hand, the population of Austro-Hun- garian birth increased from 94,325 to 117,321.

Of the total increase of 48,905, English born constituted 31,136 or 63^ per cent, Scotch 12,721 or 26 per cent, Irish 3,780 or 8 per cent, Welsh 1,284 or better than 2^ per cent. The number of English born in Manitoba (63,616) and Saskatchewan (63,611) are almost identical. Natives of the Lesser British Isles show a falling ofî in Manitoba and Saskatchewan and a small increase in Alberta for 1916 over 1911.

British born bettered their position in all cities of 10,000 and over with the exception of Brandon, where the proportion of the British born fell from 86 per cent to 84-9 per cent. Brandon is also the only cit}^ of this class which had a greater proportion of European born in 1916 than in 1911. The proportion of Canadian born was larg-er in all cities of this class in 1916 than in 1911. The falling off in the proportion of foreign born persons in the cities listed was due, among other things, to (1) internment of alien enemies, (2) return home of persons born in the United States, (3) the attractive openings for employ- ment in industrial centres of Eastern Canada and the United States.

The inquiry respecting \" Litnguage spoken\" on tiie sciiedule required an answer /rom every person of the age of 10 years and over to three questions, (a) Can'you speak English, (b) Can you speak French, (c) Language spoken as mother tongue. The statistics collected under these headings are presented in Tables XXVII to XXXII. Table XXVII shows by provinces, for those born under the British flag, the number of each racial origin (1) who speak English only, (2) who speak English and French, (3) who speak French only, (4) who speak mother tongue and English, (5) who speak mother tongue, English and French, and (6) who speak mother tongue only. Table XXVIII sives similar information for cities of 10,000 and over. Table XXIX for the provinces and Table XXX for cities of 10,000 and over presents the statistics of \"language spoken\" by the population of alien birth resident in the Prairie Provinces June 1, 1916. Inability to speak English. — Of the total population (1,240,374) 10 years of age and over 102,425 or 8-3 per cent reported themselves as being unable to speak English. Of the number unable to speak English, Manitoba had 37,504 persons, including 3,620 French, 3,416 Germans, 9,121 Austro- Hungarians, 2,830 Poles, 4,154 Russians, 5,256 Ukranians, and 1,507 Dutch, most of the latter were returned as Germans in 1911; Saskatchewan, had 40,120 persons, including 2,753 French, 6,736 Germans, 14,304 Austro-Hungarians, 1,256 Poles, 5,065 Russians, and 1,590 Ukranians; Alberta, had 24,795 persons including 1,589 French, 6,935 Austro-Hungarians, 794 Poles, 1,800 Russians, and 2,108 Ukranians. Table XXXI gives the number and per cent proportion of each specified origin represented in the population of 10 years of age and over who were unable to speak English. In taking the census of the Prairie Provinces in 1916, enumerators were instructed, in recording the origins of the people, to return each person as being of the origin of the father; consequently, when persons of British races married women of alien origin the children of such union were recorded as English, Irish, Scotch etc. racial origin, as the case might be; the result being the children are in many instances reported as speaking a foreign \"mother tongue\" and English or a mother tongue not consonant with the racial origin given. Also in a few cases the ancestral language, Gaelic or Welsh, was entered as the mother tongue. The number reported speaking these languages were classified as English-speak- ing. Table 20 summarizes by totals and percentages the population of the Prairie Provinces by specified origins who were reported at the last census as being unable to speak English. • Out of a population of 1,240,374 of the age of 10 and over, 790,941 were British born and 449,433 foreign born. Of the former 4 -3 per cent were unable to speak English as against 15-2 per cent of the latter. Of the British born (10 years of age and over) English, Irish, Scotch, and Welsh races possessed 638,449 as against 47,270 of French origin and 105,222 of other origins, while among the total foreign born (449,433) of this age group, 96,474 were of British races. Among the population of German origin (93,925) 25,518 were British born (in Canada) and 68,407 aliens. Of the former, 12-4 per cent reported themselves as speaking German only as compared with 11-2 per cent of the latter. Of the Austro-Hungarians, 22 per cent of the native born were unable to speak English, 35 • 3 per cent of the Russians and 26 • 9 per cent of Ukranians native born were reported as not speaking English. The largest proportion, of any race, resident in the Prairie Provinces, unable to speak English is shown by the Ukranians with 39-8 per cent, followed by the Austro-Hungarians with 35 per cent, the Poles with 27-2 per cent, and the Russians with 27-1 per cent.

Proportion of origins by sex, non-English speaking. — Table 21 gives the proportion of the poptUation, native and foreign born, 10 years of age and over, who were unable to speak English. The females of nearly every racial origin appear to have acquired the use of English more slowly than have males. In Manitoba, 14-4 per cent of males and 25-7 per cent of females of German origin, 10 years of age and over, native born, professed their inability to speak English. In Saskatchewan, 8-6 per cent of males of German origin and 17-3 per cent of females were so reported, while in Alberta the native born Germans who could not speak English represented for both sexes less than 1 per cent. 33616— c xxxiv CENSUS OF PRAIRIE PROVINCES, 1916 TABLE 21. — Percentage of males and females 10 years of age and over of each specified origin classified as British born and Foreign born unable to speak English, by provinces, 1916 Origins Percentage unable to speak English Vjy sex Manitoba Male Female Saskatchewan Male Female Alberta Male Female German .' b r Austro-Hungaiian B F Belgian B r Danish -B F Dutch b F Icelandic . - b F Italian b F Jewish B F Norwegian B F Polish B F Russian b F Swedish b F Ukranian B F 14-4 12-4 200 25-2 9-6 16-3 •6 2-7 31-4 20-4 91 1-9 10-4 •3 5-9 14-8 21-0 47-8 22-7 •2 4-1 21-6 26-6 •4 20 17-4 28-3 5-6 (') 1-9 (') 1-6 1-6 9-5 (') 3-2 15-9 20-3 6-4 12-6 •2 1-2 190 30-4 B — British born; F — Foreign born. (^) Less than one-tenth of one per cent. Mother Tongue. Table XXXIII gives for each of the provinces the mother tongue reported for the population 10 years of age and over, classified according to racial origins. It, for example, shows the total number of persons in each province who gave English as their mother tongue and the numerical distribution of these among the various racial, origins represented in the population June 1, 1916, that is to say, of the 253,990 persons in Manitoba who gave English as their mother tongue, 244,015 were of English, Irish, or Scotch races, 1,226 French, 2,549 German, 448 Austro-Hungarian, 1,174 Dutch, etc., and similarly the table is to be read for those speaking other mother tongues. The numerical and per cent distribution of the population 10 years of age\" and over, according to mother tongue is given in Table 22. It is, however, evident from this table and Table XXXIII of the General TaVjles that the mother CENSUS OF PRAIRIE PROVINCES, 1916 xxxv tongue was in some instances reported according to racial origin. For example, 4,375 gave Hungarian as \" mother tongue\"' and 2,020 gave Magyar, whereas strictly speaking they should all be reported as of Magyar tongue. Similarly, 23,034 gave Austrian as their mother tongue, but as the people of this section of the dual monarchy are not all of the same racial origin and do not speak the same language it was impossible to allocate the persons so reported to any of the tongues spoken bj^ the peoples of Austria. Included in the Latin group is its distant relation \"Greek,\" but as the numbers speaking this language are given separately they can be easily detached from the group and considered separ- ately, if so desired. It is interesting to note that 62-4 per cent of the population 10 years of age in Manitoba, 61 per cent in Saskatchewan, and about 67 per cent in Alberta, gave Enghsh as their mother tongue. German was reported as \"mother tongue\" by 5-3 per cent of the population of Manitoba, 12-4 per cent of Saskatchewan, and 6-2 per cent of Alberta. In the Slavic group was included 14-7 per cent of the population of ^Manitoba, 10 per cent of Saskatchewan, and 9-6 per cent of Alberta.

The educational status of the people of the Prairie Provinces is presented ill Tables XXXIV to XXXVIII. Tables XXXIV and XXXV show by totals and percentages the number of the population, 10 years of age and upwards, by provinces and by cities of 5,000 and over, who \"can read and write\" in any language. Table XXXVI, in order to preserve comparability with the statis- tics of previous censues for the Prairie Provinces, gives the information for the population of 5 years of age and over instead of for those of 10 and over. Table XXXVII classifies the illiterates among the population of 10 years of age and over according to age periods, sex, and nativity, while Table XXXVIII gives the educational standing of the people by sex, nativity, and certain age periods. Illiteracy. — Of the total population (1,240,374) 10 years of age and over, 92,732 or 7-5 per cent are reported illiterate. Of this number the Canadian born are responsible for 29,232 (Indians included) or 31-5 per cent, the British born 941 or 1 per cent, and the foreign born 62,559 or 67-5 per cent. By pro- vinces, Manitoba possessed an illiterate papulation of 32,978 or 8-1 per cent of the population (406,809) 10 vears of age and over, Saskatchewan 36,021 or 7-7 per cent out of 465,284, and Alberta 23,733 or 6-4 per cent out of 368,281 of this age group. In Manitoba the illiterate males are 7-7 per cent, in Saskat- chewan 6-8 per cent, and in Alberta 5-8 per cent of the male population 10 years of age and over, as against 8-6 for females in Manitoba, 9 per cent in Saskatchewan, and 7-4 per cent in Alberta. Among the foreign born, Manitoba showed the greatest percentage of illiterates for both sexes, being 19-3 per cent for males and 24-3 per cent for females, followed by Saskatchewan with 12-1 per cent for males and 16-7 per cent for females, or an average of 14 per cent for both males and females. The proportion of illiterates among the foreign born was lowest in Alberta, being 7-4 per cent for males and 9-7 per cent for females.

The census of 1911 reportetl that 13-6 per cent of the population of the three provinces, 5 years and over were unable to read or write as against 11-9 per cent in 1916. In Manitoba the number of illiterates dropped from 14-1 per cent of the total to 12-9 per cent, and in Alberta from 12-7 per cent to 10-4 per cent of those 5 years of age and upwards. Among the cities of 10,000 and over, the greatest percent- xxxviii CENSUS OF PRAIRIE PROVINCES, 1916 age of improvement was made by Moosejaw, with a falling off in illiterates of 5-1 per cent, reducing the proportion of this class of its population from 8-2 per cent to 3-1 per cent; the next place was taken by St. Boniface, which reduced its proportion from 12-8 to 8-5 per cent. Citizenship. Statistics relating to the citizenship of the foreign born population resident in the Prairie Provinces June, 1916, are given in Tables XXXIX to XLI. The first of these classifies by provinces the foreign born as naturalized or alien by sex and birthplace; the next table gives similar information for alien immigrants living in cities of 10,000 and over, while Table XLI distributes the naturalized and alien of foreign birth bj^ sex and age periods. The census returns show that 302,356 or 62-2 per cent out of a total of 485,937 foreigners resident in the Prairie Provinces had acquired Canadian citizenship. Of the foreign born males (283,367) 165,709 or 58-5 per cent had become citizens, while of females (202,570) 136,647 or 67-5 were naturalized. Table 25 summarizes the statistics of citizenship of the foreign born by totals for the three provinces as a whole and for each province.

Of the total foreign born (283,367) in' the three provinces, only 209.871 or 74 per cent had attained their majority and could exercise the right of choice in acquiring citizen- ship, and of these there were a certain number whose length of residence was not sufficient to permit their attaining to the status of citizenship. It will be observed that the foreign born under 21 years of age who were reported natural- ized had acquired citizenship through the operations of the Canada Natural- ization Act, which provides that \"If the father, or the mother being a widow, has obtained a certificate of naturalization within Canada, every child of such father or mother, who, during infancy has become resident with such father or mother within Canada, shall, within Canada, be deemed to be a naturalized British subject.\" CENSUS OF PRAIRIE PROVINCES, 1915 xxxix TABLE 26.— Numbei and percentage of foreign born males, by birthplace, naturalized, 1916 Country of Origin Foreign Born, Males in Prairie Provinces Number and percentage of each group naturalized All Ages Under 21 21 and Over All ages p.c Under 21 p.c 21 and over p.c All foreign born Austria Hungary Belgium Denmark France Germany Holland Iceland Italy Norway Roumania Russia Sweden United States . . .

The statistics of agriculture given in Part II of this volume relate to areas of farms, field crops, fruits, animals, animal products, and labour and wages of the Prairie Provinces in 1915 and 1916. As was previously stated, the enumera- tion, of each farm was contained on a separate individual schedule. This method, while it ensured absolute secrecy and provided for a more efficient system of enumeration and revision and consequently of more accurate statistics of agri- culture, consumed more time in compilation, than when the records of 100 farms were contained on the same schedule. But as the records of each farm in pre- vious censuses extended over five schedules, it depended on the care with which the enumerator preserved his serial numbers whether it was possible to trace the records of any one farm through each schedule, that is, to know that the returns for the same farm appeared on the same line in each of the five schedules devoted to the enumeration of agriculture. It is, therefore, believed that the results obtained in the 1916 census of the Prairie Provinces, from having the returns of each farm under instant surve}»\" has tended to give a reasonably accurate accounting of the agricultural operations in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta in 1915 and 1916. For the former year they show the areas and production of field crops in 1915, as well as the quantities of meats, milk, butter, cheese, and eggs produced, and for the latter year the acreage of land owned, improved, and under crop for the 1916 harvest, as well as of the number of animals on hand in city and country at June 1, 1916. The total land area of the Prairie Provinces regarded as being fitted for agriculture is estimated at 215,000,000 acres, which would provide 1,350,000 farms of 160 acres each, or nearly seven times the present number (218,563). Farms in 1911 and 1915. — The number of farms by provinces in 1911 and 1916 is given in the following statement, together with the increase absolute and per cent made in five years. xl CENSUS OF PRAIRIE PROVINCES, 1916 Provinces Number farms in — 1911 1916 Increase Increase per cent Manitoba 45,606 96,372 61,496 46,580 104,006 67,977 974 7,634 6,481 2 13 Saskatchewan 7-92 Alberta 10-53 Total 203, 474 218,563 15,089 7 41 The area of land occupied, as farms, increased by 1,208,437 acres or 9-88 per cent from 1911 to 1916 in Manitoba;, Saskatchewan showed a gain of 8,157,713 acres or 28-48 per cent, and Alberta a gain of 5,310,868 acres or 29-92 per cent in five years.

Population, farms, farm lands and farm property in 1911 and 1916. — Table 28 gives a general summary of the principal facts with regard to urban and rural population, farms, farm lands, and farm property for the years 1916 and 1911. In the five years the urban population increased by 136,638 or 29-11 per cent, the rural by 232,857 or 27-10 per cent. There was but little change from 1911 to 1916 in the proportion of the population living on the land; it being 647 and 643 per 1,000 respectively at each census. There was a decrease of 10,465 in the number of farms of 200 acres or less — and an increase of 25,554 in the number of farms having more than 200 acres each. The area of farm land occupied increased by 14,677,018 acres or 25 per cent, land under crops increased by more than 39 per cent in the. five years. There Avas an incre"
