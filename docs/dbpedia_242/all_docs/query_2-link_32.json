Order, please.\n\n5275 THE CHAIRPERSON: Order. Ã lâordre, sâil vous plaÃ®t.\n\n5276 Bonjour, tout le monde. Good morning, everyone.\n\n5277 Avant de dÃ©buter lâaudience, je voudrais prendre quelques minutes pour mentionner que nous soulignons aujourdâhui la derniÃ¨re Ã©tape dans la mise en Åuvre des nouveaux choix tÃ©lÃ© qui dÃ©coulent de Parlons tÃ©lÃ©.\n\n5278 As you may recall, since March 1st, Canadians can subscribe to a $25 basic package. As of today, December 1st, all licensed providers must offer all optional channel, also known as discretionary or specialty channels, on a pick-and-pay basis. They must also offer small packages of up to 10 channels.\n\n5279 So after choosing the basis package they want, either the small basic package or one of the providerâs large entry packages, Canadians can now get additional channels in the way that makes the most sense for them. They can choose one channel; they can choose small packages of channels; or they can choose large packages.\n\n5280 Our decisions are, and always have been, about choice.\n\n5281 Les mÃ©nages canadiens sont tous diffÃ©rents. Ils ont des goÃ»ts, des besoins, des budgets, et des intÃ©rÃªts diffÃ©rents. Ils regardent diffÃ©rentes Ã©missions. Il y a des mÃ©nages qui regardent beaucoup de tÃ©lÃ©vision et qui veulent sâabonner Ã de gros forfaits de chaÃ®nes.\n\n5282 Il y en a dâautres qui, de plus en plus, regardent du contenu en ligne et voudraient que leur facture de services tÃ©lÃ© baisse, car ils ne la regardent pas dâautant quâauparavant.\n\n5283 Il y en a aussi qui ont annulÃ© leurs services tÃ©lÃ©. Certains ont une antenne et regardent la tÃ©lÃ©vision locale en direct gratuitement.\n\n5284 All this to say that Canadians have choice when it comes to watching programming.\n\n5285 We, the CRTC, have made available online tools to help Canadians shop around for TV services. We have a checklist so they can figure out their needs\n\n5286 and their budget. We show them the five steps to negotiating a better deal with their providers. We also gave Canadians tools to find other service providers\n\n5287 in their area and links to online tools that compare services across the country.\n\n5288 If theyâre unsatisfied with their TV services, Canadians have the responsibility as informed consumers to do their homework. Itâs quite possible that, given their specific interests and budgets, they may come to realize they already have the best deal. Or they may decide to make changes.\n\n5289 Weâll be closely monitoring how television service providers are implementing the new TV choices and if theyâre following the best practices weâve identified.\n\n5290 Nous avons renouvelÃ© les licences de la plupart des fournisseurs pour une pÃ©riode dâun an. Quand les licences devront Ãªtre renouvelÃ©es lâannÃ©e prochaine, nous nâhÃ©siterons pas Ã agir si certains fournisseurs ne respectent pas la politique en place, ne respectent pas les consommateurs canadiens, ni leur droit Ã avoir du choix.\n\n5291 Merci and thank you.\n\n5292 Alors, Madame la secrÃ©taire.\n\n5293 LA SECRÃTAIRE: Oui, merci, Monsieur le prÃ©sident.\n\n5294 Good morning, everyone.\n\n5295 So as announced yesterday, we will start with Kosiner Venture Capital this morning by video conference. Heâs appearing from our Toronto regional office. And then everybody else is in the same order as indicated in the agenda.\n\n5296 So Mr. Kosiner, can you hear us well?\n\n5297 MR. KOSINER: Yes, I can. I just canât see you as of right now, but I understand theyâre working on that this morning. So if thereâs any questions following, if you could just address whoâs speaking that would be great.\n\n5298 THE SECRETARY: No problem.\n\n5299 So the panel is here. We can see you and hear you well. Weâre ready to hear your presentation. Please, go ahead.\n\nPRESENTATION\n\n5300 MR. KOSINER: Great. Thank you very much and thanks to all of you for having me this morning.\n\n5301 I donât think based on my intervention it would be any shock to you to say that weâve had some grievances with Rogers Media Incorporated over the past licence term.\n\n5302 I think Iâd like to start off and say things havenât always been that way. If you go to page 6 of my presentation you will see that Keith Pelley stated himself -- he was the former President of Rogers Media -- that Evan is a brilliant entrepreneur, which I appreciate. And we definitely have a track record.\n\n5303 I had a show on Rogers TV, on page 7. When I was 13 years old I got to go hang out over at Kiss 92 City TV, which is now a Rogers property, as you know. It was the first news organization to interview me when I was involved in a teen movie festival and kids film festival at the Bloor Cinema in Toronto at age 7. And that really inspired me to get into TV in the first place.\n\n5304 On page 8 youâll see some photos of my home TV studio and then my attending Rogers master control head end in Toronto along with interviewing the President of SkyDome, which was actually on Media Television on City as well.\n\n5305 So Iâve always been a big Rogers fan. Unfortunately some things over the past year have changed that. So you know, with some CRTC hearing merchandise I would like to see Rogers be made great again.\n\n5306 To start things off and just for the sake of time here as well, Iâm going to go through -- because thereâs more in-depth information in the package thatâs been presented to you. But Iâll touch on each point and hopefully keep the ball moving here as well and we can kind of go from there if youâve got any questions.\n\n5307 The first thing for us is Rogersâ Vice deal. And thereâs a concern about -- and I donât know the accuracy but I would pose the question and ask -- perhaps you as the Commissioners can follow up -- if Rogers Group of Funds is using, and how much money theyâre using to fund their Vice deal. Thereâs been speculation, and it should be taken just as that, that Rogers and their $100 million deal with Vice used somewhere in the range of $25 to $35 million of their Groupâs funds to underwrite that venture. And to me thatâs quite a concern for independent producers because thatâs less money that others get to work with.\n\n5308 I think itâs an interesting question and to see how that ties in because if Rogers is getting a considerable commercial gain from that, I donât know if that money was intended to be allotted for independent production and then how that ties in once that deal was done and, you know, Vice is closer to home before Rogers going through there. Thereâs more information, as I mentioned, in the package.\n\n5309 Again, tied into the funds itself, I think that how Rogers manages itself and their executives ties in greatly to a vertically-integrated company and definitely impacts the stakeholders. And itâs something that needs to be addressed by the Commission that, you know, if thereâs poor management that leads to poor business decisions, that then -- when youâve got independent producers even riding on some of those funds, if thereâs not as much revenue coming in, it really impacts all different areas of the vertical.\n\n5310 And sometimes when it comes to the scope of a CRTC hearing it becomes a problem doing a presentation where weâre, as an intervenor, allowed to hit one particular aspect.\n\n5311 And I know just reading some of your transcripts from the prior days and listening in, some of the lines of questioning that have occurred over this hearing about Shomi and other products definitely would be out of scope directly toward Rogers Mediaâs licence renewal. I think youâve addressed that well, but it would just be nice as an intervenor to be able to somehow have a bit more of a broad scope because usually one thing impacts another.\n\n5312 So a perfect example of that? We were involved, and sort of still are, in a venture. And Rogers, we assert, uses CRTC process for their commercial gains sort of hijacking the process is the way Iâd like to refer to it, although thatâs my opinion.\n\n5313 And what they ended up doing was using the intervention process to gain access to a partner that we were working with and try and create their own agreement that -- against them promising otherwise that they wouldnât interfere. It really stepped on some toes over here. And we just donât think thatâs right, and I wanted you guys to be aware of that.\n\n5314 And just for the sake of time because weâre five minutes in, Iâm seeing right now, I wanted to continue on. And thereâs more information again about that in paragraph 3 of the presentation.\n\n5315 Going into number four here. Weâve got a concern; itâs an interesting one. We found through engineering and looking at how Rogers distributes some of its online signals that they arenât encrypting both their sports channels and some of Bell Mediaâs TSN channels.\n\n5316 We brought this to the Commission in CRTC Complaint 2016-0520-6. Youâll have all that information. And it was asked that the CRTCâs engineers verify this independently prior to forwarding the complaint to Rogers, which then happened.\n\n5317 I donât know what Rogers necessarily has to gain from it, but itâs definitely a concern that an unencrypted broadcast signal is going around the world. And just with other NFNs and things at play, are Canadian consumers potentially not getting the best deal if Rogers is willing to put it on the Internet for free? I think it needs a bit more attention.\n\n5318 Number five, Canadian content-wise, I donât even know if thereâs a nice way of putting this. But if youâve watched G4 Tech TV -- and again, I donât expect the Commission to regulate the programming per se. But I think it should be noted that the Canadian content is probably from about 10 years ago continuously on G4 Tech TV, at least from what Iâve seen.\n\n5319 I was watching the other day and I heard about the iPhone, and Windows 8 is coming out supposedly very soon. And for a tech channel, it would be nice to see some refreshed Canadian content on that channel if it considers to be current with technology. Or perhaps, you know, retitle what the channel actually is.\n\n5320 Number six, again itâs a question that Iâd like you to pose to Rogers. Thereâs been some speculation and buzz in the industry that when Rogers was launching FX they decided to put NHL programming on FX. And if you have ever watched FX in the United States, thereâs no NHL programming there. Itâs very out of scope and not traditional for a channel like FX to be airing NHL programming, to say the least.\n\n5321 From what I understand, that was done in a way so that it could be bundled and BDUs would have to carry FX strictly so that they wouldnât be getting a ton of phone calls from potential customers wondering why they arenât carrying this channel because they want to see their NHL programming.\n\n5322 So I donât know exactly what rule would have been broken, but it definitely seems like an abuse of power.\n\n5323 Number seven is Rogers contributed to less described video content in partnership with AMI, which is an interesting one. I donât know if their heart was in the right place but they started doing a partnership for, I believe, at least the last two seasons of the Toronto Blue Jays and airing described video programming that -- I donât know exactly how to describe it. Theyâre taking the simulcast of Sportsnet from what Iâm understanding and putting just the DV version given AMIâs mandate on AMI Television.\n\n5324 If you look at it though, Sportsnet has a certain, you know -- theyâve got their commitments to described video programming per week. And if you have the same thing on AMI television, between the two channels thereâs now 50 percent less described video programming available to someone whoâs visually impaired. That, to me, is very problematic and offensive.\n\n5325 And I guess finally, given how many grievances we have -- and this sort of just touches on some of them -- you know, I can see it being a burden on the Commission to have to deal with things that Rogers is -- where theyâre going and some of the things that theyâre involved with.\n\n5326 And again on number eight here, Iâm wondering if some of these concerns would be better addressed with the directors of Rogers as a corporation. So I was able to nicely, with my counsel, look up the Corporations Canada entry and with links for all of their personal information so that you could serve a notice perhaps directly to the Board of Rogersâs various companies.\n\n5327 With that said, Iâve just hit the 10-minute mark as I see, and I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.\n\n5328 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for your presentation.\n\n5329 Vice-Chair, Judith LaRocque will start us off with some questions.\n\n5330 COMMISSIONER LaROCQUE: Good morning, Mr. Kosiner.\n\n5331 My name is Judith LaRocque and Iâm the new Vice-Chair for Broadcasting at the CRTC.\n\n5332 I would like you to go into a bit greater detail on the issue that you raise in point 7 with respect to the visually impaired. I would just like to -- you went through it rather quickly and I do want to have a very good understanding of what the issue is here.\n\n5333 MR. KOSINER: Well, first, we thank you. And welcome to your role at the Commission; thatâs fantastic.\n\n5334 Number seven is about AMI again and the Toronto Blue Jays, which is part of Rogersâ media programming, as you must be aware as well.\n\n5335 From what I understand, thereâs a partnership between Rogers and AMI. And basically whatâs happening is the same Toronto Blue Jays game you get on Sportsnet without described video, or if you switch to the second audio channel to be able to get it while watching Sportsnet as you traditionally would do for described video, you can watch only in described video on AMI. So the content remains the same, itâs just taking the dedicated described video feed -- the way I understand it -- and having it only on accessible media television.\n\n5336 The problem with that is that if you -- thereâs limited described video programming. If you canât see, itâs hard enough to go around. And I think you might be aware, or at least some of you are aware that Iâve been a champion for the cause of making described video more accessible for those who are visually impaired and Canadians in general.\n\n5337 Thereâs 50 percent less content available. So if you take two channels, right, and theyâre both airing the same thing thatâs 50 percent less than if AMI just aired something else that had described video. There would now be two different shows. So it doesnât really serve those who are visually impaired.\n\n5338 It might look nice from an optics standpoint for AMI to say, âHey, weâve partnered with Rogers and weâve now got Blue Jays games only in described video to you.â And at face value it sounds great, but it actually really does a real disservice to those who are visually impaired.\n\n5339 COMMISSIONER LaROCQUE: Thank you for that.\n\n5340 MR. KOSINER: Does that clear things up?\n\n5341 COMMISSIONER LaROCQUE: It does, thank you very much.\n\n5342 Iâd like to go to your point 5 next, which is the airing of CanCon reruns. I mean, surely thatâs a business decision on the part of Rogers trying to fill the 24 hours in a day and after doing an analysis that citizens will watch it or not watch it. I mean, Iâd like to hear your views on that.\n\n5343 MR. KOSINER: I think itâs gotten to the point that Rogers has become very greedy. That their executives -- now given some of the other content that they have, theyâre really playing hardball and abusing their dominant position.\n\n5344 And I think that as much as it may not come to light right here at a CRTC hearing, I think thereâs things that are happening behind your back that are going on. Because Iâve heard different BDUs who have been complaining about the fact that, you know, you canât take one without the other. Thereâs interesting things that Iâve heard. And again, itâs speculation and hearsay so I would ask that you do your own investigation.\n\n5345 And itâs just my opinion of whatâs going on, but itâs a problem that Canadian consumers get stuck paying for a channel that doesnât have any relevant content given what itâs supposed to offer. Itâs like going into the Apple store and having, like, an Apple II from 1987; would you be happy with that? And paying the same rates as the new one? No, not really.\n\n5346 And itâs not what Americans -- if you go to the States and check out their tech channels, thatâs not whatâs going on over there. So Canadians are really getting stuck with a channel thatâs got old content. I think if I was an independent going out there trying to launch this, no one would pick it up if I told you that we got 10-year-old content that's going to be going on it. So again, I think there's a bit of an unfair advantage there, just with Rogers' leverage.\n\n5347 COMMISSIONER LaROCQUE: Thank you for that. Your presentation deals with Rogers, but I'm going to ask you this question with respect to all of our requests. Are you in favour of licence renewals as proposed by the three broadcasters?\n\n5348 MR. KOSINER: Yes, and Iâve got to tell you, even like -- I don't know what's going on with the Corus dividend, but the fact that they can offer nine percent a year on a dividend is pretty great, as far as I'm concerned, from an investment standpoint, and hopefully they can maintain that and grow. I have no real issues with that.\n\n5349 And you're going to laugh, because you donât know if I'm going -- which way I'm going on this, but with Rogers, I even think that there is a case to be made that their 9(1)(h) application could be valid, they're -- that -- you know, again, that's your decision to make, but I think that what OMNI has provided through the years, I actually, funny enough, support that.\n\n5350 COMMISSIONER LaROCQUE: Well, youâve put a lot of information on the public record and I appreciate that, so thank you very much.\n\n5351 Mr. Chairman, that concludes my questions.\n\n5352 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much, Mr. Kosiner. I believe those are all our questions. Thank you for participating in the hearing.\n\n5353 MR. KOSINER: Okay.\n\n5354 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.\n\n5355 Alors, Madame la SecrÃ©taire?\n\n5356 MR. KOSINER: Thank you. Thanks for having me.\n\n5357 THE SECRETARY: Thank you. I will now invite Entertainment One to come forward to the presentation table, please.\n\n5358 Just press the button on your mic, please, sir. The light will come on red.\n\n5359 MR. MORAYNISS: Nice.\n\n5360 THE CHAIRPERSON: Yeah. So go ahead when you can. Thanks.\n\nPRESENTATION\n\n5361 MR. MORAYNISS: Good morning. My name is John Morayniss and Iâm here today representing Entertainment One. I am the Chief Executive Officer of eOneâs Television group.\n\n5362 Thank you for the opportunity to speak today. eOne is encouraged by the CRTCâs ongoing commitment to support a robust Canadian development, production, and distribution ecosystem, and I think we can all agree on the importance of bringing high-quality, made-in-Canada content to Canadians and audiences around the world.\n\n5363 eOne is headquartered in Canada, but we are very much a global company. We know firsthand that the global marketplace has become increasingly competitive with an overwhelming number of premium, high-quality television shows competing for eyeballs, on both linear and non-linear platforms.\n\n5364 SKYPE TELECONFERENCE: --- has left the conference.\n\n5365 MR. MORAYNISS: There you go. I'm still here, by the way. With ---\n\n5366 THE CHAIRPERSON: Sorry about that. It's just, I guess, the teleconference just kicked off.\n\n5367 MR. MORAYNISS: Yeah, that's fine.\n\n5368 THE CHAIRPERSON: Please go ahead.\n\n5369 MR. MORAYNISS: Yeah, I'm live and in person.\n\n5370 And with news streaming services like Amazon Prime entering the Canadian market, the competition will only intensify. So while the good news is that it's a great time to be a content creator and supplier, the challenge in Canada is that we need a regulatory system that supports creative excellence and recognizes market realities. The stakes have never been higher for the Canadian content industry and we have to get this right.\n\n5371 As we contemplate the future, we see both a short-term strategy, whereby policy and regulation protect and nurture our industry at a time of digital disruption, and a long game strategy where we build a strong, vibrant Canadian content industry that can survive on its own two feet in a globally competitive marketplace.\n\n5372 Our belief is, in order for Canadian content to be successful in a global marketplace, we need a better framework in which Canadian creative talent, producers, broadcasters, and distribution companies can work together more effectively. Canadaâs talent pool is first-class, but the Canadian framework for supporting creative excellence is no longer ideal.\n\n5373 I imagine that many intervenors presenting this week would share the same goal: to produce and export world-class, highly profitable, made-in-Canada TV drama that Canadians will choose to watch over competing programming from around the world. Currently that goal cannot be achieved without a Canadian broadcaster first commissioning and investing in that program.\n\n5374 While weâre living in a digital era, we want to emphasize that linear TV is far from dead. Right now, and for the foreseeable future, traditional broadcasters are virtually the only platforms that can unlock crucial financing and trigger the creation of original, high-value Canadian content.\n\n5375 For this reason, we strongly support the CRTCâs decision to maintain the current Canadian programming expenditure requirements. We also strongly recommend that the lionâs share of this investment be tied to programming that is produced by Canadian independents and distributed by Canadian independent international sales companies. This will cultivate a stable and balanced ecosystem where risk and reward are truly shared, and the entire value chain has the best opportunity to remain in Canadian hands.\n\n5376 In our experience, the most successful shows come from these kinds of partnerships. You have a creative writing and producing team that generates great ideas; a studio infrastructure that supports and takes risk on those people and their ideas; a broadcaster that provides valuable creative input, financial support, and creates initial awareness for the project through its platforms; and a distributor -- typically a studio, a major or an independent -- not always -- that gets the content out to the international marketplace and monetizes it.\n\n5377 Throughout the entire value chain, these partners share in the creative risk, but they also share in the reward.\n\n5378 In tandem with maintaining these crucial spend thresholds, we encourage the Commission to reinstate a minimum exhibition requirement for Canadian content during primetime on discretionary services.\n\n5379 Primetime ratings are a key metric for understanding viewer preferences and identifying a showâs success, and they matter to international buyers. It comes down to offering Canadian stories a real shot on Canadian airwaves. And again, it starts with a broadcaster Commission.\n\n5380 But, letâs face it; regulatory mandates only go so far. They donât necessarily serve commercial imperatives. And they will mean nothing if Canada doesnât have an infrastructure that allows Canadian content to compete globally.\n\n5381 Now, we understand that in this new digital era, our broadcast partners face a challenge to stay healthy and deliver on their business objectives. We recognize that their continued fiscal success is vital to the overall success of Canadaâs creative industries.\n\n5382 So weâve reached a critical crossroads. The time has come to establish a more effective framework, where broadcasters are incentivized to support Canadian content because it works for them commercially and not because they are mandated to do so.\n\n5383 We believe all financial stakeholders in the value chain -- government, creators, producers, broadcasters, and distributors â- can gain from a regulatory framework that balances cultural commitments and market realities to incentivize risk-taking.\n\n5384 Canadian content regulation has up to now been very supply-side focused. Weâve created a world-renowned physical production infrastructure, but weâre still seeing a creative âbrain drainâ for above-the-line talent.\n\n5385 In the U.S. and in other markets around the world, thereâs a significant uptick in acquisitions of foreign TV programming. Thereâs no question that Canada is rising with this tide, but not to the same extent.\n\n5386 Speaking on behalf of one of the leading international sales companies in the world, I can say that Canadian drama programming isnât getting the same pricing as programming coming from the U.S. or the U.K., and the Canadian creative brand does not have the same cache as other territories or regions like Israel or Scandinavia. In other words, thereâs a discount on Canadian drama content in the international marketplace.\n\n5387 At an individual level, the nationality of our writers, directors, and actors certainly doesnât lessen their value. Canadian talent is priced at market rates. Thereâs no Canadian discount on Jean-Marc Vallee, Kiefer Sutherland, Rachel McAdams, David Shore, Semi Chellas, Hart Hanson, Tassie Cameron; I can go on and on. As both producers and exporters â and Canadians â weâre frustrated because we know the value of our Canadian talent, but we know that somehow they are not being properly served by the existing framework.\n\n5387 This is a uniquely Canadian problem, where the perceived value of our inputs -â our world-class writers, directors, producers, actors, is somehow worth more than the actual value of the finished good. The whole is lesser than the sum of its parts.\n\n5388 To date, Canadian content regulation has been successful in building a strong, robust film and television below the line production sector. The next step in the evolution of our industry is to further refine the system so that Canada becomes recognized as a mecca for not only the manufacturing of content, but where global hits are created and supported in Canada through both investment and access to top-tier talent from around the world.\n\n5389 However, creating global hits is not enough. We need a regulatory framework that ensures the value of Canadian content IP remains in Canadian hands so that Canadian creators, producers, broadcasters and Canadian distribution companies can share in the success together. In other words, we need an environment that supports creative and financial risk-taking.\n\n5390 In order to create hits, one must take significant risks in the R&D process and be willing and able to fail. And Canadian broadcasters need to play a bigger role in that process.\n\n5391 Currently, on a typical one-hour scripted drama program, the broadcaster assumes roughly 15 percent of the budget via licence fees, and sometimes less. On the other hand, eOne and other distributors and studios generally assume between 25 to 35 percent of the budget as risk capital, primarily through distribution advances and minimum guarantees.\n\n5392 We want to incentivize Canadian broadcasters to invest more in Canadian content and by doing so, broadcasters should be able to benefit from the global success of their shows. When broadcasters see success with Canadian content at home and abroad, they will want to keep investing in Canadian content. And we think thatâs good for our industry.\n\n5393 I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the Panel and Iâm happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you.\n\n5394 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you and welcome. Iâll put you in the hands of Commissioner Simpson.\n\n5395 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Good morning, Mr. Morayniss. Iâve been waiting for this day.\n\n5396 MR. MORAYNISS: I donât know if thatâs good or bad.\n\n5397 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Itâs good, at least from my standpoint. I have a couple of questions that are to do with the reasoning behind and the strategies behind your success because I think itâs a well that a lot of producers would like to drink from and it would be informative for me, and I think for everyone listening to the hearing.\n\n5398 But the first thing I want to ask you, though, is the point you just made that I find really interesting as an individual that has spent a lot of my time in the creative industry. And it sort of goes along the along the notion that Canadian talent and Canadian productions seem to have to go out into the world and be recognized as a success before we recognize them as a success.\n\n5399 Is that anecdotal statement a truism or is it -- and if it is, is it growing or diminishing?\n\n5400 MR. MORAYNISS: Itâs not anecdotal. I mean it is but itâs also true and itâs verifiable.\n\n5401 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Yeah.\n\n5402 MR. MORAYNISS: Thereâs no question that Canadian is a small market. Itâs right next door to the United States and certainly, for English speaking Canada, very similar culture, same language.\n\n5403 So thereâs always been a need to sort of create a regulatory environment, as you know, and a system of protection to make sure that we donât get completely inundated constantly with just American programming where the budgets are much higher, where they have more flexibility creatively, and it completely displaces Canadian content.\n\n5404 But you know, right now weâre living in a scenario where, as you know, you can access content from anywhere in the world; you can watch almost any channel you want; you can get content online, legally and illegally; and the competition has blown up. Itâs just blown up and itâs going to get even more and more competitive. Amazonâs coming into Canada; itâs only a matter of time before more over-the-top services come into Canada.\n\n5405 So yes, the problem in Canada, I think, for a long time has been that the infrastructure has been very much about, sort of, a cottage industry. Itâs been sort of a handful of broadcasters, a small group. You havenât really seen a lot companies with scale thatâs been really built in Canada.\n\n5406 And to my point in my submission, when we compare ourselves to the United States, thereâs just been the ability to fail over and over again, to continue investing, making mistakes, investing, taking chances, accessing talent from anywhere in the world, not just from the U.S., and making great content. And we havenât had that same opportunity in Canada.\n\n5407 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Mâhm.\n\n5408 MR. MORAYNISS: And I think to a certain extent the mindset in Canada has been, sort of, you know, âThe U.S. is right next door but weâre really more about protecting from the US into Canadaâ ---\n\n5409 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Mâhm.\n\n5410 MR. MORAYNISS: --- instead of realizing, âOh, my God, weâre right next door to the United States; we have the best opportunity to export our shows into the U.S.â\n\n5411 And to my point that I was making about the Canadian discount, thereâs a lot of export thatâs happening from Canada into the U.S. but the U.S. buyers are not paying full licence fee for this content.\n\n5412 So that is really the challenge. How do we create a framework in Canada ---\n\n5413 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Exactly.\n\n5414 MR. MORAYNISS: --- where we can take the best talent in Canada and we can create a system where the investment stays in Canada; where the entire value chain stays in Canada; where those talented individuals, whether theyâre writers, directors, producers, actors, are working in Canada; but the asset weâre creating is so valuable that not only does the U.S. pay full market rate for it, but all over the world they pay full market rate for it.\n\n5415 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: So to pick up -- this is a beautiful opportunity for me to pivot to my next question because the popularity question of the home versus abroad, I heard you say, translates into the economics of the Canadian exports. And I think hear you saying that weâre not getting best buck because weâre not, ourselves, valuing the product to the full extent of its worth.\n\n5416 So is that an attitudinal problem or an economic problem that has to be fixed in terms of getting top buck for top-quality stuff thatâs coming out of Canada?\n\n5417 MR. MORAYNISS: I donât think itâs an attitudinal problem because I -- you know, weâre looking at this and weâre seeing the feedback ---\n\n5418 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Yeah.\n\n5419 MR. MORAYNISS: --- and weâre experiencing the response from a global market about what -- you know, again, Iâm talking more about high-end drama content than anything else, what itâs worth in the marketplace.\n\n5420 Itâs more about, again, the framework of the way production and development is working in Canada where, again, itâs very challenging for Canadians to spend a lot of money in R&D because you donât have a lot of well-capitalized companies and the R&D process is becoming very expensive. The idea of developing scripts now and packaging projects with the best talent takes time and money.\n\n5421 eOne is not alone in this, by the way. Thereâs a lot of larger independents and major studies that are spending millions and millions of dollars every year investing in scripts and getting scripts written and packaging and putting projects together and then taking them out to market.\n\n5422 And they need broadcaster support to do it; they need distributorsâ support; they need the bigger studio support to do it; and a lot of the best creative producers are working with those studios to get this R&D done and a lot of times the R&D doesnât go anywhere.\n\n5423 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Yeah.\n\n5424 MR. MORAYNISS: Thatâs the nature of, you know, research and development; it goes nowhere. And so thereâs a lot of projects that get written off until you find the projects that will be valuable and will, you know, be those assets that will ultimately be returned into the system so that you can continue to spend and spend and spend until you find the next hit.\n\n5425 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Right.\n\n5426 MR. MORAYNISS: The problem in Canada is the starting point on the risk side, on the R&D side, doesnât exist. So the U.S. takes a lot of risks and then the Canadian broadcasters will be the beneficiaries of that risk because theyâll go to the LA screenings, the May screenings, and theyâll pick up the best shows coming out of the U.S.\n\n5427 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: And again ---\n\n5428 MR. MORAYNISS: They havenât spent that money ---\n\n5429 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Yeah.\n\n5430 MR. MORAYNISS: --- on the risk side in the same that the U.S. studios and the US broadcasters have spent that money and, as a result, theyâre renting those shows; they donât own those shows.\n\n5431 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Yeah.\n\n5432 MR. MORAYNISS: Our thesis is, you can create a very similar model in Canada to whatâs happening in the U.S. ---\n\n5433 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: But it takes more money?\n\n5434 MR. MORAYNISS: --- and you can use the U.S. as a key market to get your shows sold to -- but in a way where it starts in Canada, not where it ends in Canada.\n\n5435 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: And I think what youâre saying is that it obviously takes more money; it takes -- there has to be the offsets of risk to go with that. But the view, if Iâm reading you right, is that to get to the scale -- not that itâs possible, but to get toward the scale that the U.S. is at, where one show makes it to air but 10 pilots are cut -- whereas in Canada itâs, you know, one pilot cut -- goes to air.\n\n5436 What I think I hear you saying here is that investment going forward, both from the origination of funds through regulation through to the expenditure of those funds, has to be with the view to -- not just domestic need but export returns.\n\n5437 MR. MORAYNISS: Absolutely. Canadaâs a small market.\n\n5438 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Yeah.\n\n5439 MR. MORAYNISS: And if weâre recognizing that thereâs a cultural imperative as well as a commercial imperative ---\n\n5440 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Okay.\n\n5441 MR. MORAYNISS: --- then we have to recognize that, you know, whatever we make in Canada where we support a Canadian creative industry and a Canadian production industry, itâs a global market. But the good news is, itâs a borderless world.\n\n5442 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Yeah.\n\n5443 MR. MORAYNISS: You know, more and more -- and, you know, I said that in my submissions ---\n\n5444 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: And distributionâs getting more and more frictionless, right?\n\n5445 MR. MORAYNISS: --- from a distribution -- right.\n\n5446 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Yeah.\n\n5447 MR. MORAYNISS: Thereâs never been a better time for foreign content, English-speaking and non-English-speaking content, to be sold around the world to buyers around the world. Both global services like Netflix and Amazon ---\n\n5448 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Yeah.\n\n5449 MR. MORAYNISS: --- as well as big buyers like Sky or RTL or TF1, theyâre hungry for the best content. And so thereâs an opportunity in Canada to really rise above the pack; and we havenât done it yet but thereâs an opportunity to do it.\n\n5450 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: So take your point and use you as the control mechanism because youâve done this. You started out as a Canadian company back in the seventies as a record business and you grew. So taking what you did. And where you are today, and taking what youâre saying about what the industry here, the ecosystem in Canada, needs to do, how long was it before you jumped the rails and went international? And was it out of opportunity or need because the Canadian industry just couldnât fuel your growth needs?\n\n5451 MR. MORAYNISS: Look, itâs been an evolution and itâs both been opportunity and need. But certainly if you look at whatâs happening, you know, specifically in the audio/visual side of our business, music, you know, has had a different trajectory. And there are similarities but there are also differences.\n\n5452 But in the world of audio/visual the opportunity is now. The opportunity to create homegrown content that actually has asset value thatâs no different than an American show like Designated Survivor, which eOne produces and distributes, just not Canadian content. Thereâs never been a better opportunity than now to do it in this marketplace.\n\n5453 And thereâs also a need. Thereâs too much competition. And networks and studios and distributors and producers and the creative talent that we want to stay in Canada wonât be able to survive unless we create a framework to support that kind of global competition and ensure that Canadians can participate and get high-end high-asset value drama, and theyâre not just service producing; theyâre not just, you know, sort of executing; theyâre not just renting; but theyâre actually owning and controlling throughout the entire value chain.\n\n5454 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Okay. In taking the reference of audio/visual as opposed to television/film and the like -- videos, music videos -- whatâs your blend right now, in that audio/visual sphere, between movie production and TV? And you know, of the two baskets, how are the two doing and which oneâs growing?\n\n5455 MR. MORAYNISS: Well, itâs complicated. I mean, theyâre both growing. Weâre certainly seeing an opportunity and a demand in the TV space and the digital space to grow and the long-form series space. Itâs displacing what I would call, sort of, you know, made-for-adult feature films, that independent feature market. You know, eOne has certainly seen that in the last several years where if you look at our growth, TV is growing an digital is growing faster than our theatrical film business. Theatrical film business is still very strong. Storytelling is still important.\n\n5456 And if anything, weâre seeing the lines blur. Weâre seeing that, you know, even between our film group and our TV group, the idea of how projects come to fruition and where they end up, whether itâs a film or a TV series, has become, you know, almost, you know seamlessly flowing back and forth. In the old days there was a solid line between film and TV and you didnât cross it.\n\n5457 Now -- again, Iâll use an example. One of our shows, Sharp Objects, based on Gillian Flynnâs first book -- she wrote Gone Girl -- originally developed as a feature on the eOne side. We couldnât crack the storytelling so we moved it into the TV side; hired a new writer; spent, by the way, hundreds of thousands of dollars developing this project before we even took it to market. And then we attached a Canadians director, Jean-Marc VallÃ©e. We attached an American actress, Amy Adams. We had an American showrunner. And we put together a project called Sharp Objects we sold to HBO. And eOne owns it.\n\n5458 So you know, the idea that anything is a film project or a TV project, itâs almost like, âWhatâs the best way to tell the story in this day and age?â But what weâre seeing is thereâs really interesting storytelling in television because you can tell a story over a longer period of time. So weâre seeing the growth of TV and limited series and of event television growing. Thereâs an opportunity in Canada to take advantage of that and to grow that business.\n\n5459 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: One more question on the subject of film versus TV and then I want to dive down into some of the subject of the hearing. Otherwise Iâm going to get kicked under the table.\n\n5460 Weâd heard this week from some services that movies are so abundant, not only in terms of unlocking existing libraries but with, you know, that frictionless distribution system of OTT streaming services, video on demand, and the like, that movies are getting to be a tougher part of the mix for television because everybody is chasing titles and paying big bucks and movies traditionally are higher-cost productions.\n\n5461 So there seems to be a lessening of appetite for some of the television services to try and make a buck off of it and stay with the TV business.\n\n5462 But with video-on-demand services like Netflix, what I found interesting -- someone said to me that thereâs a new form between traditional episodic television and long-form drama, which is a two-hour movie, and itâs binge-viewing, which is really long-form just broken into parts. Because people will spend an entire weekend watching the equivalent of a movie. Are you finding that that kind of episodic exhibition is becoming a replacement for movies? Because the costs certainly are getting to be the same.\n\n5463 MR. MORAYNISS: Absolutely. And youâre seeing the talent, the feature talent moving into that area. Again, my example Share Objects is a great one. Amy Adams is a film star but sheâs doing television. Youâre seeing that more and more. Youâre seeing Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon doing HBO series.\n\n5464 So thereâs no question that what youâre seeing in the film business is similar to what youâre seeing in TV, which is youâre seeing very, very high-end, big tent-pole films, what we call four-quadrant films, that are doing very well at the box office but theyâre big. They need a ton of support; theyâre usually studio-supported big investments, big risk.\n\n5465 Or youâre seeing very niche, very small movies that have a very targeted audience and can do well but within that smaller niche.\n\n5466 The same thing is happening in TV. The bigger shows are getting bigger. Theyâre becoming more event-y. You need to take more risk. You need to package them better. And those are the noisy, buzz-worthy shows in the marketplace.\n\n5467 And again going back to whatâs happening in Canada, Canada needs to keep pace. You know, if weâre sort of in that middle where weâre doing some sort of middle-of-road shows, the budgets arenât big enough, the packaging isnât big enough, the casting is not big enough, the writers arenât -- whatever it is where you can create an event, youâre going to get lost in the sort of broad reach not just from the U.S. but from the U.K. and elsewhere, of these big event series, limited series, binge-worthy series, or even long-form and long-running series.\n\n5468 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: To your presentation this morning, you said that weâre at an inflection point and weâve got to get busy. Weâve heard a lot about -- you know, as much as weâve heard the word âflexibilityâ weâve heard âpartnershipsâ. And Iâve been trying to peel away the onion to understand what those partnerships look like in terms of structure and economics.\n\n5469 What I find interesting is that from your standpoint -- and itâs why I was looking forward to this discussion this morning -- from your standpoint, globally youâre as big as two out of the three vertically-integrated -- the television segments of the vertically-integrated companies that are here this week, with the exception of Bell. Youâre sort of in that same stratosphere with your total revenues. And it puts you at a different place at the table when it comes to the negotiating with these networks.\n\n5470 But why Iâm asking the question in that way is thereâs been a concern with the independent producers that to get to the table and stay at the table and to make a buck, usually by shaving percentages as it goes from production to distribution both at home and abroad, that there seems to be a model shaping up where the only way that the networks are encouraged to really get in with both feet is to take a larger percentage of the show. Up to 30 percent is whatâs allowable now.\n\n5471 But how do these companies -- what changes to the independent producers with that kind of a model that they really canât get and stay at the table unless they become an unwilling partner with the buyer?\n\n5472 MR. MORAYNISS: Well, listen, itâs a very challenging situation and Canada -- itâs challenging because thereâs so limited -- its consolidated, limited buying community. eOne is not a buyer. Weâre not a platform. We donât have any leverage that way. So we rely on hopefully developing really great content that more than one buyer wants and quite frankly developing content that can work for a Canadian broadcaster or a U.S. broadcaster.\n\n5473 Weâre developing now -- we have development teams in Canada, the U.S., the U.K., and Australia. So everything we develop, while it may come out of that market, weâre not thinking itâs for that market. Weâre thinking, âThis is great. We could sell this first in Canada. We could sell this first in the U.S. We could sell this first in the U.K. It doesnât matter.â\n\n5474 And when you look at it that way, itâs much more of a competitive landscape. And so itâs not just about pitching a show to Corus, or Bell, or Rogers, itâs pitching a show to the world. And you find that buyer that says, âI want to take a chance on the show. I want to develop this with you, I want to be a partner with you, I want to own the show with you.â\n\n5475 It doesnât have to be a Canadian broadcaster, but I can tell you if the asset is good then -- you know, Canadian broadcasters are smart and as commercially minded as anyone else. If you offer them a commercial proposal where by investing more you can own more and have more upside thatâs not a bad thing, thatâs a good thing.\n\n5476 So you know, for me itâs about competition and itâs about selling a product that someone wants. And if you have something that they want they will buy it and you will get a good deal for it. It happens all the time in the U.S. in a much more unregulated market. Now, granted there are a lot more buyers.\n\n5477 But, again, wearing my global studio hat, the buyers are also borderless in our world. So we can go, you know, anywhere we want.\n\n5478 The key thing, you know, for eOne and other studios is thereâs an interesting symbiotic relationship that exists when you look outside of Canada, where you have a very strong creative producing community throughout world -- especially in English-speaking territories -- where they work very closely with larger integrated studios or distributors who are helping support and finance and give them leverage in the marketplace.\n\n5479 They own significant back end or upside of these shows, just like the broadcasters end up doing in the studio. So itâs a really nice partnership and everyone has a role to play. Thereâs a creative role, thereâs an infrastructure support role, financial role, thereâs a risk-taking role. And, you know, they partners play different roles, but when it all comes together the whole is controlled by everyone. But everyone has a job to do.\n\n5480 And one of the things that weâre seeing more and more is you need sort of a handful of really strong distribution companies that can take these shows in a national market and have leverage weight in that market when theyâre selling shows. Theyâre not just selling one show. Theyâre not just selling, you know, one show in one genre but theyâre offering a portfolio and, you know, they have the ability to sort of impress upon these buyers why the show should work. They have research and marketing intelligence. They have all the things that large distributors have.\n\n5481 And so, you know, small, medium, and large companies can all work together really well but there has to be a framework to support that.\n\n5482 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Thank you. The last two questions I have.\n\n5483 Iâd like to ask you a risk question associated with your very strong conviction that one of the things we should be doing is ensuring that thereâs minimums for Canadian production exhibition in prime time on discretionary.\n\n5484 And the risk question is asked that way because while it doesnât cost any money to impose that kind of regulatory requirement, whatâs the risk to the broadcaster if they have either a status quo or an increased exhibition requirement in prime time? And how do you offset that risk given what you first said sitting down was that weâve got to get behind our Canadian product and get everybody, you know, yelling from the bleachers and watch Canadian product?\n\n5485 You know, how do we offset that risk? Or is there a risk by imposing in the highest revenue area of a discretionary a new obligation or an existing obligation for exhibition?\n\n5486 MR. MORAYNISS: Yeah, thereâs definitely a risk and thatâs the challenge. You know, when youâre requiring a broadcaster or a discretionary service to invest in CanCon or put CanCon in prime time -- which is the most valuable real estate -- and it doesnât work, itâs not good, it doesnât get ratings, they donât make money on it, itâs a problem.\n\n5487 So the system -- if you donât fix the entire system then youâre absolutely right. The challenge with imposing those kinds of requirements is risky and probably ultimately wonât work and wonât be ultimately in the long-term interest of a healthy industry.\n\n5488 So youâve got to have that, we think, because having these shows launch in prime time is absolutely crucial. But you also have to have a framework where the shows are really good, they get ratings, and thereâs an opportunity for our broadcast partners to not only rent these shows in Canada but have the opportunity to participate in the success of these shows around world. So that ultimately the connection between prime time success in Canada and the global success of those shows can have as a result of that initial launch in Canada all flows back into the ecosystem so the broadcasters, the distributers, the studios, the producers, the creative talent all participate in that success.\n\n5489 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Last question. Thank you.\n\n5490 Last question. On licence fees, in this model that you see -- and Iâm thinking when I ask this question about the smaller independent producers. If the buyer, if the networks take your point of view which is Iâm going to get into this thing with both feet because Iâm going to do what I -- Iâm going to fill my need in the Canadian market but my goal really is to build a product thatâs going to travel.\n\n5491 Does that, with what you know about how the industry works, still pose a situation where the creator, the independent producer is still looking at a tiered licence fee and ownership model where theyâre going to get that -- as you say -- devalued or minima for domestic and then as it travels and becomes a success they have a different percentage structure?\n\n5492 Is it a one-size-fit-all deal or does the deal change as it goes to market?\n\n5493 MR. MORAYNISS: The deal changes. I mean, again, everything that gets produced is unique. You know, itâs not a one-stop and one-shop or one product thatâs all model. I mean, thatâs part of the problem and the challenge in Canada. You know, weâre not creating commodities here. These are unique value propositions, unique properties every time.\n\n5494 And weâve seen it. You know, one show is worth âXâ, another show is worth âYâ just because theyâre two cops shows. Greyâs Anatomy, a fantastic medical drama and Saving Hope, a great medical drama; they both donât have the same pricing. You can guess which one is worth more.\n\n5495 But as you create better product, the pricing will go up in Canada and also globally.\n\n5496 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Why I asked the question the way I did is that we had a submission from the Writers Guild yesterday that I relate to which is spec work. And what I worry about is that their problem of not getting paid until green light becomes a producer simile in that if the promise is to take them to the world market but I need your help, I need you to come in with your sweat and weâll provide the equity but weâre not going to pay for your sweat until this thing is green light. Is that a potential problem with this model that youâre talking about?\n\n5497 MR. MORAYNISS: I donât think so. Listen, we are spending more and more on development than we ever have on writers. The old system was a writer would come and pitch you an idea and then youâd take it to a network, and if the network liked it then you would pay that writer to develop the script. So you would hone a pitch and then you would take it.\n\n5498 Now whatâs happening in the independent production world, in the independent studio world with the major studios is weâre all developing dozens and dozens of scripts every year before we take them to market. Weâre paying writers a lot of money to write these scripts and then weâre spending time to package them -- bringing in a director, a marquee actor -- before we take it to market.\n\n5499 So if anything, what weâre seeing globally -- in the U.K., Canada, the U.S., and elsewhere -- weâre seeing more and more investment in development. Itâs probably not happening in Canada as much because youâve got a much more disparate kind of spread out, you know, smaller individual entities, producers and production companies, that donât have the capital to take that kind of risk, which is why we think itâs important to have, you know, a handful of really strong and better capitalized companies that can take that kind of risk, invest in those writers.\n\n5500 Thereâs always going to be a writerâs choice when they go pitch a project to, you know, a studio or a producer -- hopefully a company or a broadcaster that has market intelligence -- and that broadcaster says, âWe donât see the value of this project. We donât get it. Itâs a pitch, we donât like it.â\n\n5501 A writer can always choose to write on spec and then bring it back to market.\n\n5502 If they really believe in what theyâre doing theyâll do it. But I can tell you, more and more when we get a great pitch or someone brings us a great book weâll invest in it. And weâre not alone. Most of the companies that have any kind of capital base are taking a lot more risks now and investing a lot more in the writer community to get these scripts written. Not even just one script; two scripts, three scripts, and taking it to market at that point.\n\n5503 COMMISSIONER SIMPSON: Thank you. Those are my questions.\n\n5504 And I thank you for your support of the country that got you where you're going and acknowledge your support for the Applicants here at the hearing today. Thank you.\n\n5505 MR. MORAYNISS: Thank you.\n\n5506 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much, Mr. Morayniss, for having appeared. You're an important player in the Canadian audio-visual sector, so we appreciate your participation here.\n\n5507 MR. MORAYNISS: I appreciate it as well. Thank you.\n\n5508 THE CHAIRPERSON: Ã l'ordre.\n\n5509 Madame la SecrÃ©taire?\n\n5510 THE SECRETARY: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I will now invite Mr. Kirwan Cox from the Quebec English-language Production Council to take place, please.\n\n5511 Oh, good.\n\nPRESENTATION\n\n5512 MR. COX: Mr. Blais, we wanted to deposit a document to put it on the record, which is our intervention or our brief to Heritage for their cultural consultation.\n\n5513 THE CHAIRPERSON: And I take it, obviously, you hadn't finalized that document before this proceeding started, so you were unable to put it on the record ---\n\n5514 MR. COX: Earlier, that's ---\n\n5515 THE CHAIRPERSON: --- earlier?\n\n5516 MR. COX: --- right.\n\n5517 THE CHAIRPERSON: And why is it relevant or probative in the context of this proceeding, because as I understand, the minister's review is about everything within the cultural sector of the Institution Legislation Policy's programs, whereas we're looking at the review of the renewal of three licences or groups of licences under existing legislation.\n\n5518 MR. COX: We say in our speech that we think there are some things that you can do, which you have the authority to do, and some things which you don't have the authority to do, which the government should do. And I'm anticipating you're going to say afterwards, \"Well, what the heck are those things you said the government should do? Do you have a list?\" because I've been listening for the past few days, and you sometimes say that sort of thing.\n\n5519 And so I wanted to be ahead of the game and say, \"Oh, yes, we have a lot of ideas. Here they are, and we've deposited them.\"\n\n5520 THE CHAIRPERSON: Okay, so we'll take your request under advisement. Thank you very much. Please go ahead.\n\n5521 MR. COX: Okay. Mr. Blais and Commissioners, we are happy to be given this opportunity to speak to you. My name is Kirwan Cox, Executive Director of the Quebec English-language Production Council.\n\n5522 On my left is Anna Scollan, our Co-Chair and National Industry Relations for ACTRA. On my right is Janis Lundman, a member of our Board and producer of successful TV series' such as \"Durham County\", \"Bomb Girls\", and the forthcoming \"Bellevue\".\n\n5523 Janis?\n\n5524 MS. LUNDMAN: Good morning. I work in an industry that seems huge when you look at the numbers with over 7 billion in total production, generating 150,000 jobs. That's a lot of money and manpower, but when it comes to broadcasters commissioning shows, they often go to the same few companies in Toronto and Vancouver.\n\n5525 I understand this allows for a certain comfort level, but it also at times makes it difficult to encourage innovative ideas, support new talent, hear diverse voices, or take a chance on us, the official language minorities.\n\n5526 Mr. Blais, Commissioners, you have altered the balance in this Toronto centre calculus by establish official language minority quotas. Your precedent-setting decisions with Rogers, Bell, and CBC have turned around English Quebec production, at least with CMF-funded television.\n\n5527 This year, because of the Anglophone minority incentive fund and CRTC's official language minority quotas, we now have seven English Quebec drama series in production in Quebec. That is up from zero drama series six years ago. In fact, I'm now producing one of those seven OLMC drama series for CBC. Our series \"Bellevue\" was green-lit in the spring, but too late for the AMF fund. All that money had been spent.\n\n5528 We had a choice of shooting the series in northern Ontario or in Montreal and Thetford Mines in Quebec. Creatively, Montreal and Thetford was a better choice. It offered the landscapes we needed and it had a larger production centre with easier access to crew, equipment, and post-production facilities. It was also an easier draw for cast, which is very important in this competitive global market.\n\n5529 However, Montreal was a harder choice financially because of the lower tax credits. Without the AMI funding, Sudbury was a better choice if the decision were based only on the numbers. Fortunately, due to the OLMC quota, the CBC went with Montreal and that allowed us creative and production flexibility.\n\n5530 Because of the Montreal location, we were able to attract a very good cast with Anna Paquin, Allen Leech, and Shawn Doyle. We had a dedicated crew, many of whom worked with us on \"Durham County\", and these elements helped us to bring on board a major international distributor which was very important for our financing. The OLMC quota tipped the creative balance and allowed us to make a higher quality and more internationally saleable series.\n\n5531 CRT's quotas have been a success, and not because they force anyone to watch anything. They are a success because they give the OLMC industry an opportunity to compete in a global market. They are a success because they give us the opportunity to tell our stories. And they are a success because they give young people in Quebec and Montreal a chance to start and continue their careers in Montreal and not take the first bus out to Toronto.\n\n5532 We are slowly and steadily rebuilding the English Quebec television production business. Even in these tumultuous times, success is possible but it cannot be done with a five-year expiry date. It takes a long vision and consistent regulatory oversight, not inconsistent experimentation.\n\n5533 In a world of dominant American media, Canadian content would not exist without robust regulation. OLMC content wouldn't exist without your quotas. You give us creative and financial flexibility for our projects, a modicum of economic stability for our companies, and the chance to be the best we can be.\n\n5534 MR. COX: Now the bad news. Even though we are turning the ship around, we are still in mid-course on a voyage counted by the decade, not the fiscal year. Our production remains fragile and volatile, especially in the weaker regulated and unregulated market segments.\n\n5535 In 2014-15, we lost 24 percent of our total production in that one year. Let me break that down. Using both AMI funding and the quota, our CMF-funded TV production grew. Without AMI funding, non-CMF-funded television production fell 16 percent. Without the benefit of either a quota or the official language minority fund, our feature films dropped 35 percent. Where do we go from here? For many years, the CRTC has allowed these broadcast groups to increase their market share for one reason: to increase Canadian content and support section 3 of the Act. Now, these huge, vertically-integrated broadcast groups face severe and real difficulties. Ultimately, we think the solution lies in government policy. Here's the point where you can say, \"Aha, but what government policy?\"\n\n5536 In the meantime, we ask you to continue the responsibilities these broadcast groups have taken to support Canadian content, and especially to support OLMC production. We ask that these responsibilities be extended evenly across each licensee so they compete on the famous even playing field.\n\n5537 MS. SCOLLAN: So we request that each company have the same obligation. Right now, Rogers has a three percent OLMC independent production quota; with the exception of one year, they have done very well in the average over six percent. We ask that this requirement be increased to 10 percent of their total PNI production, and 10 percent of their development spending by condition of licence.\n\n5538 Bell has a 10 percent OLMC quota on their English tangible benefits for the Astral purchase. Their production data is incomplete but they have done very well with 16 percent OLMC production in one year. We ask that they also have a 10 percent OLMC requirement on total PNI production, and 10 percent of their development spending by COL.\n\n5539 Corus has no OLMC obligation, but they operate a Montreal station that is seen throughout Quebec. Shaw has averaged close to six percent of OLMC production, and we ask that Corus have the same 10 percent OLMC PNI requirement and 10 percent development by COL. These are priority requests. We believe it is fair that each broadcaster which has a local station in Quebec have the same OLMC obligations.\n\n5540 Based on available data, this minimum 10-percent production requirement is well within their capabilities. The 10 percent is flexible since we are asking for a percentage and not a fixed dollar amount, averaged over their licence, and not an annual minimum. The times are indeed a-changing and we understand broadcasters want flexibility.\n\n5541 So do we. We want the flexibility to work in English in Quebec. We want the flexibility to make the best programs we can.\n\n5542 We ask you to make that possible. We ask you continue your OLMC quota and apply it equally to all licences.\n\n5543 We are happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you.\n\n5544 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much for your presentation. Iâll put you in the hands of Commissioner Dupras.\n\n5545 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Thank you. Good morning. How are you today?\n\n5546 I want to question you on the percentage of quota, OLMC, in English Quebec that youâre asking for.\n\n5547 On the French side of OLMC, the APFC, On Screen Manitoba, and others have asked that the Commission require that large French ownership devote up to three percent of their annual PNI expenditure to OLMC production outside Quebec.\n\n5548 But as English Quebec production community is concerned, youâre asking for 10 percent. I can see the figure but, I mean, why is it higher in Quebec?\n\n5549 MR. COX: We have a different industry. We have a different history. Our history goes back to the 1890s, as a matter of fact. And whereas with the francophones outside of Quebec, their industry is about 20 years old. As a matter of fact, it exists because of the various requirements that have been put in place by Heritage or by yourself. But the level that may be appropriate for us and appropriate for them may not be the same level. And we wouldnât argue their case one way or the other.\n\n5550 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: And can you tell us whatâs the calculation you made to come to 10 percent?\n\n5551 MR. COX: Weâve made that calculation based on the experience that weâve seen and our feeling that we need to be a little bit higher than where we are. To use the example of the CMF, the CMF, because of Heritage, has a minimum of 10 percent for French-language production outside of Quebec. And we donât have any requirements at all in terms of Heritage or in terms of their rules to the CMF.\n\n5552 In the case of the CRTC, we have consistently argued for 10 percent because that was a bit higher than the status quo. And you have given us 3 or youâve give us 6, or 10 in the case of Bell, tangible benefits. And you know, weâve seen the results of all of this and itâs been very successful. Weâre not greedy. Because Bell might be at 16 percent one year weâre not saying set it for 16 or 20 or whatever. Weâre looking for a stability and weâre looking for a floor that we can all count on and everybody can understand.\n\n5553 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Okay. And when I hear you this morning you tell us, you know, that Rogers, Bell, Corus are all doing, you know, production expense in English Quebec. Why is there a need to regulate?\n\n5554 MR. COX: I think if there were no regulations there would be no Canadian content because the economics would simply say aside from news, weather, and sports, you know, highly local stuff, why get larger production in English, at least, in Canada? And if you were to leave it up to the marketplace it wouldnât exist.\n\n5555 And the same is true, to a great degree, of our situation. It makes more economic sense to concentrate production in Toronto or in Vancouver and in English. And it doesnât make any sense to do it in Montreal.\n\n5556 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Why does it make more economic sense in Toronto than in Montreal?\n\n5557 MS. LUNDMAN: Well, Iâll try to answer both your questions.\n\n5558 In Toronto when you look at the tax credits that you have either regionally or content or service productions -- in the production that Iâm just work on now with âBellevueâ, it would have more sense economically to shoot in Sudbury and northern Ontario given the tax credits that were there, even though creatively it wouldnât have made as much sense given what we were trying to do.\n\n5559 And thatâs very important now, as John Morayniss and eOne was just saying, in terms of trying to compete on the global market. I now have to produce programs that are going to compete with other drama series that have $3 or $4 million per episode, whereas I have, you know, a US$2 million, CAD$2.4 million. So I have to try and get as much production value as I possibly can out of the locations that I choose and the actors that I work with.\n\n5560 So for me I found the perfect location in Quebec and in and around Montreal. And I did go to Sudbury and northern Ontario; it just wasnât the same. So for me -- and I have worked in Toronto quite a bit and, you know, done that. But itâs different -- Iâm making different choices now as a producer because I have to compete on a much larger scale in a larger world and itâs much more competitive.\n\n5561 Am I answering your question?\n\n5562 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: I mean, I hear you.\n\n5563 MS. LUNDMAN: So economically ---\n\n5564 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: But what Iâm asking myself, is that a barrier for a broadcaster to buy your show if you have a great project?\n\n5565 MS. LUNDMAN: Okay. So what is now happening since the CRTC regulations and the quotas and doing it in Montreal, they are now -- Iâm finding that the broadcasters are now coming to Montreal. Theyâre having meetings; theyâre having open town halls; theyâre actively looking for projects coming out of Montreal. And the projects that are being done now, the seven drama projects in Montreal, I donât think would have been done out of Montreal. They would have either not been done at all or they would have done other projects in Toronto. But theyâre actively doing that.\n\n5566 And when our project -- when they came to us in the spring to green-light âBellevueâ, they had two questions -- one, could we deliver on time in February because it was a short date, and two, we had to confirm that we would be shooting in Quebec and in Montreal because that was important for them because they had a certain quota that they had to fill.\n\n5567 So for me as a producer I know that that is making a big difference.\n\n5568 MR. COX: I would just add ---\n\n5569 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: But youâve heard the groups before us this week. Theyâre all saying that theyâre following the best creative idea projects. I mean, they need to distinguish themselves. Why tie their hands somewhere 10 percent in English Quebec? Why canât a producer from Quebec, I mean, compete like the others, you know, to try and come up with the best project possible? Why do we have to get involved to give you a minimum?\n\n5570 MS. LUNDMAN: Right. I think that what has happened with the broadcasters -- and I totally understand this -- I lived and worked in Ontario for quite a few years -- is you get a certain tunnel vision where, you know, you have the writers; you have the companies that you know that come in; itâs a comfort level; this is what you want to do. You donât necessarily want to look outside of where you are and that comfort level unless they come to you.\n\n5571 But if youâre in a situation where, âOh, now I have to look to Quebec and I have to see whatâs thereâ and youâre going to go, âOh, wow, there are five other projects there. There are, you know, 20 projects there that I could develop that I could do something with.â Because if thatâs not in place, âWell, you can just come to us. We donât have to do anything. We donât have to think about it.â\n\n5572 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: And what youâre proposing to that effect is that there be processes for consulting associations, that a licensee would have to develop, and otherwise -- I mean, how are your relations with the large players, with Bell, Corus, and Rogers?\n\n5573 MR. COX: They keep improving because of the quota that you put in place. Before that they didnât bother to come to Montreal because there was no point to it. Since then at least Bell and Rogers have been very active and helpful and we think theyâre doing a great job.\n\n5574 Corus doesnât have a quota, they donât show up, they donât care, they donât bother. And, you know ---\n\n5575 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: As you know, whatâs in place are tangible benefits that are to end. And thereâs also Rogers when it bought a station it said it would spend three percent, and itâs an expectation. So you had that for a while but thereâs no guarantee necessarily for the future.\n\n5576 And today youâre coming to us and youâre saying, âWell, you should impose such guaranteesâ I mean, in this world where there are no more guarantees.\n\n5577 MR. COX: As long as there is an Official Languages Act and a Broadcasting Act that worries about these things, I think itâs an ongoing obligation that you need to consider.\n\n5578 The other thing that I want to get back to you about is there is a huge advantage to producing in Ontario because of the provincial tax credit. It is about 40 percent higher than the English tax credit in Quebec. So if you were to do a certain project that might cost $4 million, the Ontario Tax Credit if it included a regional bonus would be over $1 million. The Quebec Tax Credit, if it was done in English, would be about $600,000.\n\n5579 Now to overcome that $400,000 or 40 percent disparity, we have to have a countervailing advantage, which only youâre able to provide really in terms of having a minimum that the broadcasters have to do.\n\n5580 This has been a very successful program. Youâve won. Youâve demonstrated that quotas work; itâs tremendous, weâre happy. But it should be an even playing field. All of them should have the same relative obligation.\n\n5581 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: And this is how you explain the exodus of production company to Toronto, the tax credit difference?\n\n5582 MS. LUNDMAN: Itâs a combination of a tax credit and trying to continue to do productions in Quebec, yes. Itâs tax credits, itâs like everybody -- there just wasnât work. I mean, now thereâs seven productions going on in Quebec.\n\n5583 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: No but you said that the English Quebec production community was -- how do you say -- lost a lot of companies to Toronto.\n\n5584 MS. LUNDMAN: Yes.\n\n5585 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: And I was asking if that was mainly due to the difference with the tax credit.\n\n5586 MS. LUNDMAN: Itâs due to the tax credits and itâs also due to the fact that itâs very easy; all the broadcasters are there. Itâs very easy to meet them for coffee, to get to know them on a personal basis.\n\n5587 MR. COX: Also, the talent pool is much deeper in Toronto because of all the Montrealers that are there. And if you want to make something in Montreal, itâs much more difficult because the talent pool is thinner because thereâs been less work.\n\n5588 MS. SCOLLAN: Can I just speak to the talent side and not just the companyâs side just to the point of how Toronto-centric it is. You have productions that are shooting in Montreal, but because of where the companies are now and where the producers are or the broadcasters are now theyâre conducting the auditions, theyâre hiring people in Toronto.\n\n5589 And so you have a situation where you have Montreal performers who, you know, want to do a series in Montreal having to send an on-tape audition to a company or to a casting director in Toronto.\n\n5590 And so you see it as a talent level as well where even just to work in Montreal you have to somehow go via Toronto.\n\n5591 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: But if itâs a Quebec producer that succeeds and conclude in an agreement with a broadcaster, chances are that productions will be done in Quebec with talent in Quebec.\n\n5592 MS. SCOLLAN: Chances are but not necessarily. If you look at a lot of ---\n\n5593 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Not even necessarily. So talent is not even guaranteed even though production made in Quebec ---\n\n5594 MS. SCOLLAN: Well, thatâs because a lot of our talent has to go ---\n\n5595 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: --- that it will work, you know.\n\n5596 MS. SCOLLAN: A lot of our talent has to go to Toronto where you have ---\n\n5597 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Okay.\n\n5598 MS. SCOLLAN: You hear it from not just performers but from other unions, where thereâs a sense that you have to go via Toronto in order to get more well-known and eventually find work.\n\n5599 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: But there are some Quebec English producers that are succeeding and concluding agreements with large broadcasters aside because of the tangible benefits and the Rogers three percent?\n\n5600 MR. COX: There are producers that are succeeding, but you need a consistency of work. You need to have not one project but a series of projects so people can anticipate. They can decide do I want to move my family from Toronto back to Montreal, or whatever their personal decisions have to be. They wonât do that on the basis of one project. They have to do it with an expectation that this is now a production centre again, great.\n\n5601 Weâre not at the point where the quotas that you have put in place over the past few years have done the job, you can get rid of them, everything is okay, and we will continue at this level. Thatâs not going to happen if you do that.\n\n5602 So thatâs why weâre asking you to be consistent with the policies that youâve put in place so far which, as weâre trying to point out, have been very successful. But as weâre also trying to point out, theyâve been successful in one area, which is CMF television production.\n\n5603 In other areas which are not regulated in the same degree or do not have a quota, weâre losing, weâre continuing to lose production, even 35 percent in feature films. Itâs highly volatile.\n\n5604 So itâs hard to build a talent base and itâs hard to build the kind of relationships with that kind of volatility. You need some steadiness.\n\n5605 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Okay. And do you attribute that to the fact that -- I mean, there are many small production companies not necessarily -- and these small companies donât have necessarily the means to be able to do multiple projects at the same time?\n\n5606 MS. LUNDMAN: Yes. I mean, Iâm a small company; thereâs three of us basically full-time. And the change in the AMI fund and the quotas four or five years has made a huge difference for us. Itâs allowed us to research and develop projects, itâs allowed us to come up with a business plan, itâs allowed us to stay in business. I mean, we do one project. You know, we develop three or four projects and we really put all of our effort and all of our time into those projects.\n\n5607 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: So even though there would be a quota ---\n\n5608 MS. LUNDMAN: Yes.\n\n5609 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: --- youâre not guaranteed that youâre going to get a project going with a broadcaster. It might be a bigger Quebec production company thatâs a bigger supplier to broadcaster that is going to get it all, and small companies are not going to get more even though there would be a quota. I mean, Iâm thinking about companies like Mews, Entertainment ---\n\n5610 MS. LUNDMAN: Yeah, we work with Mews.\n\n5611 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: I mean, this is a Quebec company.\n\n5612 MS. LUNDMAN: Yeah.\n\n5613 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: I mean, it does a lot of projects, has won prizes and all. I mean, it must be hard for a small producer on its own to compete with such a production outfit.\n\n5614 MS. LUNDMAN: With Mews as well. Itâs sort of ironic because we co-produce with Mews; thatâs one more thing. But whether the quota will help large -- and it does help small companies. I know that we have companies that are in our organization who do documentaries, who do short-films, who do, you know, all sorts of different products. And what it does is it helps the industry that I work in.\n\n5615 So whether Iâm directly benefiting that year or not by a quota, I know that itâs going to benefit another company. And I donât see it benefiting just the larger companies. I see it benefiting the smaller companies as well who are doing all sorts of work.\n\n5616 MR. COX: Thereâs a small company that usually made documentaries and then they pitched a series, a drama series which was accepted because they met the broadcaster at one of the get togethers that we organized. And it was their very first drama series. And theyâve got the series going, and itâs a very small company.\n\n5617 And the head of that company was constantly saying, âShould I go to Toronto? My God, why am I so stupid? Dammit, Iâve got to get my kids out of that school.â You know, that kind of interior monologue. And now heâs able to say, âOh, I can work and make a living in Montreal. Who knew?â\n\n5618 So, you know, thatâs one example. Another is that a few years ago with the CMF Funding, one year we couldnât use all the finding we had because the formula they use created a rocky mountain up and down, up and down, kind of thing.\n\n5619 And so one year we got zero regional dollars; the next year we got four million and could only use two million and therefore the next year it was zero. The point is that when funding is so erratic, it means the people canât plan ahead.\n\n5620 Now everyone knows that there is a regular funding that the CMF is going to spend in Quebec and therefore a year, two years in advance, even three years in advance, people are able to plan ahead and say, âOkay, when it comes time, we know we can depend on this or that. We can depend on a quota; we can depend on AMI funding, whatever it might be.â\n\n5621 And gradually, like that person who was thinking of moving to Toronto and is now going to stay in Montreal, then these people, this talent, can develop because people donât acquire talent as soon as they cross the border to Ontario.\n\n5622 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Just the fact that you have some money available with the CMF, isnât that enough to trigger deals -- help you trigger deals with broadcasters?\n\n5623 MR. COX: Itâs not enough by itself.\n\n5624 MS. LUNDMAN: Yeah, it -- yes, absolutely, itâs very helpful. Itâs not enough by itself, as I know because the funding was not available; it was all used this spring, which is fantastic.\n\n5625 But also what it does with the quota is it creates a situation where smaller companies or people who are just starting out who are very talented have an opportunity to go to the broadcasters and meet them and pitch their projects.\n\n5626 And as Kirwan has said, whatâs wonderful now is that the networks are actually coming to Montreal. They come once -- twice a year now and they have these open town halls; theyâre 50, 60 people that come; the networks say, âLook it. This is what weâre looking for. This is what we want. These are the kind of projects,â and you get to hear it directly from them; itâs a one-on-one meeting.\n\n5627 And itâs not just the bigger companies or people like me who are more established. Itâs also the younger people who are starting out who have these ideas who have an opportunity to go there and pitch them. And thatâs what -- one of the things that happened with this particular company; they pitched them at one of these town hall meetings and the network went, âYeah, that sounds really good.â\n\n5628 So itâs just -- itâs giving an opportunity. Obviously, the project still has to be good but thereâs at least a chance, you know.\n\n5629 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Okay. Well, I understand very well. I'm going to leave you with the last word unless some of my colleagues have got some questions. If you want to conclude with something additional, the floor is yours.\n\n5630 MS. LUNDMAN: I donât know. I just -- you know, I thank you for what youâve done so far. Itâs been very helpful, the quota system. Itâs creating a successful story, strong companies, talented -- talented stories.\n\n5631 MR. COX: I would like to make one comment, which is that we are always trying to get our statistics in better order and we wanted the CRTC to put official language minority data and your production data into your communications report and we were told that the broadcaster had to fill in new forms for that to happen. We were then told that Bell and Rogers and Corus all said it was too much work; it was a burden, all this paperwork, and they didnât want to do it. And so, therefore, we were told that the CRTC thought it wasnât a big burden for us an we should do it instead of Bell because they were more concerned about Bellâs ability to handle all this heavy burden.\n\n5632 So Iâd like you to reconsider that question and try and get official-language minority production data into your commutations report and also help to get some of the data in better shape.\n\n5633 Thank you.\n\n5634 MS. LUNDMAN: Thank you.\n\n5635 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. Those are our questions for you.\n\n5636 And weâll take a break until 10:50. So weâre adjourned until 10:50.\n\n--- Upon recessing at 10:38 a.m.\n\n--- Upon resuming at 10:50 a.m.\n\n5637 THE CHAIRPERSON: Ã lâordre, sâil vous plaÃ®t.\n\n5638 Alors, Madame la secrÃ©taire.\n\n5639 THE SECRETARY: Weâll now hear the presentation from On Screen Manitoba.\n\n5640 You can go ahead, ladies, when youâre ready.\n\nPRESENTATION\n\n5641 MS. MATIATION: Good morning Chairman, Commissioners, CRTC staff. Thank you for the opportunity to speak today.\n\n5642 My name is Nicole Matiation. I am the Executive Director of On Screen Manitoba, the provincial media production industry association. I have with me today Joanne Levy, whom you met earlier this week. Today, Joanne is present as a current member and past Board Chair of On Screen Manitoba. Joanne has also worked as a journalist and as a development executive for several broadcasters.\n\n5643 During the French-language group-licence renewals, I underlined the important role that independent regionally-based creators play in ensuring a diversity of voice within the Canadian broadcasting system, but I believe it bears repeating.\n\n5644 Manitoba writers, directors, producers, and other media production industry professionals include French language speakers, Indigenous peoples, new Canadians, and others from diverse and established communities. They all create compelling content for Canadian and international audiences.\n\n5645 MS. LEVY: Last week, Nicole told you about several Manitoba productions that are screened nationally and internationally in the French language market; many others in the English-language market also meet international success.\n\n5646 âPolar Bear Townâ, a documentary series about Churchill, Manitoba, is the lead series and a top-Â­rated show on the Smithsonian Channel in the US. Itâs carried on Rogers Outdoor Life Network here in Canada.\n\n5647 Other successes include âPlanet Echoâ, made for APTN by Media Rendez-vous, sold to Discovery International; âIllegal Eaterâ, made by Farpoint Films for Rogers has sold to Discovery Network in Latin America; and award-winning drama âLess-than-Kindâ, co-produced by Buffalo Gal Pictures for City TV and HBO Canada is now distributed in many other countries.\n\n5648 The average number of employees for these production companies is four. They are augmented, of course, with any number of independent contractors as needed for projects.\n\n5649 The point is the quality of these productions is not dependent on the size of the production company. The success of these shows demonstrates the producersâ capacity to manage risk, collaborate with broadcasters, and deliver excellent programming.\n\n5650 We look to the Commission to establish a framework that balances the relationship between broadcasters and independent producers, and fulfills the Broadcasting Actâs demand for diversity of voice and regional reflection.\n\n5651 MS. MATIATION: Todayâs consolidated broadcasters and emerging OTT distributors operate on an entirely different scale than most independent producers. We support the renewal of the licences of the large groups with measures in place that balance the relationship between broadcasters and the independent production community.\n\n5652 We recommend that the CRTC require licensees to use standardized templates to provide annual regional production reports and plans, PNI reports both broken out by province and including official-language minority community activity. These reports are critical to tracking outreach and development as well as actual production taking place in the provinces.\n\n5653 We would like to reiterate the CMPAâs call for maintaining 30 percent CPE and historic spending for independently-produced original PNI and non-PNI Canadian programming.\n\n5654 Turning to our specific experiences with the large-group broadcasters, we appreciate their regular attendance at All Access, our annual industry forum. These sessions and meetings allow independent producers and writers in Manitoba to develop and enhance their relationships with commissioning editors.\n\n5655 We ask the Commission to renew the expectation and further encourage Broadcasters to meet regularly with regionally-based creators. This is but a first step towards increased diversity of voice and content; ultimately, we believe that decentralized decision-making is required.\n\n5656 Regionally-based producers in Manitoba and other provinces were heartened when Bell Media established regional development offices. Having a locally-based development executive meant emerging and established writers and directors could pitch concepts directly to Bell Media. Unfortunately, this promising approach lasted for only about 19 months.\n\n5657 MS. LEVY: We note the Commissionâs new Local and Community Policy Framework and welcome the exhibition and expenditure requirements for local news. We note the flexibility accorded BDUs to support âlocally relevant programmingâ. And we believe that this is an opportunity to increase investment in content produced by locally-based independent producers. In our province, there is no better example than the VOD delivered, MTS \"Stories from Home\". It develops new, diverse producers who tell stories that are relevant and valued by Manitoba residents.\n\n5658 With the potential sale of MTS to Bell, we are concerned that this successful initiative might be lost, and we ask the Commission to explore measures that encourage broadcasters to augment their investment in content made by locally-based independent producers.\n\n5659 MS. MATIATION: Regionally-based producers, with their smaller, more nimble companies, regularly demonstrate their capacity to create high-quality content for Canadian and international audiences on any platform. The DGC and others have noted that when independent producers do well, their members do well also. We believe that when independent producers can retain and capitalize their intellectual property, and when those producers are based throughout the country, the system is stronger and more diverse.\n\n5660 Thank you, and we are open for your questions, should you wish.\n\n5661 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. Mr. Dupras will ask us -- will start off the questions. Thanks.\n\n5662 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Bonjour. Just one question to start on what you said on page 3 of your written intervention.\n\n5663 You referred to experiences your members had in their dealings with broadcasters. You cited an example that licence fees agreements concluded with some members by broadcasters represented 10 percent of the production budget only, but with the broadcaster obtaining 40 percent of net profits.\n\n5664 Is that the situation common, and can you tell us more about that, which broadcaster this has occurred, and is that -- has that been something you've been reported many times?\n\n5665 MS. MATIATION: So a number of producers in Manitoba have reported similar scenarios to me. Theyâve chosen not to name the broadcasters in that case. I think that Joanne might have something to add to this.\n\n5666 MS. LEVY: The broadcast licences can range from -- anywhere from 10 percent to 30 percent, and for that, we have heard that broadcasters are sometimes asking for some of the back end, and in fact, are even starting to move on asking for the retransmission fees. So if you add all of the various streams together, it can be quite onerous for a small producer.\n\n5667 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Do you know which broadcasters is involved?\n\n5668 MS. LEVY: I have some ideas, but to -- in order to respect the privacy of the producers who brought forward the stories, I think we should refrain from mentioning that. Perhaps if there was an opportunity to have a confidential ---\n\n5669 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Okay.\n\n5670 MS. LEVY: --- undertaking, that would ---\n\n5671 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: And do you feel this is something that is becoming a practice?\n\n5672 MS. LEVY: There's a slippery slope, and we're starting to see some behaviour that is questionable and we see it starting to grow.\n\n5673 COMMISIONER DUPRAS: Okay, at an alarming rate?\n\n5674 MS. LEVY: Even if it's one or two, it's pretty alarming.\n\n5675 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Yes.\n\n5676 MS. LEVY: But there -- yeah, quite frankly, in recent times, without the balancing of the power structure between the larger broadcasters and an independent producer, it can be extremely difficult to negotiate your way out of the situations where the broadcaster wants more than they are actually contributing to.\n\n5677 I mean, there's no -- there's nobody who has an issue -- if the broadcaster wants to put in equity, they should, of course, be allowed to recoup in proportion to what they have invested. And there's no doubt about that. We're all business people. We understand that equation.\n\n5678 But when there's a difference in power structure, it can be extremely difficult for a small production company to tell a broadcaster to take a hike, because there aren't very many other alternatives.\n\n5679 COMMMISSIONER DURAS: That's it, okay. But there's always the opportunity also for the producer to agree to give some of its share to the broadcaster to entice him to take the project?\n\n5680 MS. LEVY: Yes.\n\n5681 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Okay. In your written intervention, you request the Commission require groups to file regional production reports and plans. You mention that these should include OLMC activity. You also request that a standardized approach to this reporting be develop and implemented by the Commission.\n\n5682 First, did you have a discussion with the large ownership groups about your suggestion to see if they would be ready to provide the information directly?\n\n5683 MS. MATIATION: No, we haven't had that discussion.\n\n5684 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Why didnât you contact them?\n\n5685 MS. MATIATION: We were really looking at it from the perspective of the CRTC, that that was information that should be collected because it was already broken out. You know, one of our big concerns is with the regional production report. It doesnât actually break out the provinces. It groups the prairie provinces together, so it makes it difficult for us to even understand what work has been done within Manitoba.\n\n5686 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: So you find you have issues with the data that is currently available, that's already broken down by region and by language, is not ---\n\n5687 MS. MATIATION: Yes, we'd like ---\n\n5688 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: It's not sufficient?\n\n5689 MS. MATIATION: --- more detail.\n\n5690 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: More detail?\n\n5691 MS. MATIATION: More detail, so that we would know by province what level of activity was taking place.\n\n5692 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Okay. With respect to children programming, you mention in your written intervention that you agree with the CMPA position. So if I summarize, you recommend that the Commission consider different models to ensure that the system will continue to serve Canadian children. You're also of the view that the Commission should continue to treat children's services as a unique case. Is that an accurate reflection of your position?\n\n5693 MS. MATIATION: Yes, we maintain the same position.\n\n5694 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Can you be more specific about what measure you would like to see put in place to support the creation of Canadian children programming?\n\n5695 MS. LEVY: What we've seen in Manitoba -- and we can really only talk from our experience provincially -- is that I believe there's been a certain falling-off in the amount of children's programming that is produced in the province. And we're concerned that that's an area that we used to really excel in, and we're looking for opportunities to make sure that our independent producers have -- are encouraged in that market.\n\n5696 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: And can -- do you have any clue why it -- there was a reduction?\n\n5697 MS. LEVY: Well, there's also fewer buyers. As we know, there's been terrific consolidation in Canadian production, particularly as it relates to the broadcasters who will buy children's programming. And it's just that much more difficult and more competitive.\n\n5698 COMMISSIONER DUPRAS: Okay. Well, these conclude my questions. Thank you.\n\n5699 THE CHAIRPERSON: Thank you very much. We have no further questions for you. Thank you very much.\n\n5700 MS. LEVY: Thank you.\n\n5701 THE CHAIRPERSON: Ã l'ordre.\n\n5702 Madame la SecrÃ©taire?\n\n5703 THE SECRETARY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will now invite Mr. Steve Hogle from the Saskatoon Blades.\n\n5704 THE CHAIRPERSON: Welcome, and please go ahead when you're ready.\n\nPRESENTATION\n\n5705 MR. HOGLE: Thank you very much. Good morning, Mr. Chair, Ms. Vice-Chair and fellow Commi"
