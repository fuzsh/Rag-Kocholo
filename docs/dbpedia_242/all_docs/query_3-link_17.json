The premise is the same as the idea is to grow the account value in the UL plan. Remember folks, only consider an IRP if you already maxed your other registered accounts, high income and ready to save more.\n\nxgbsSS wrote: ↑ First things first, thIs is not a separate investment account. It is fully part of the UL policy. The idea of a UL investment is that funds are generally for the purpose of paying premiums. The investment account isnt actually invested, but are linked performance. You get interest income based On the performance of these Investments even though they are \"equity\" investment options (very important on the taxation portion). Secondly, the funds are tax deferred, not tax free (unless you die) if your investment accounts exceed your premiums minus cost of the insurance ($38.77 per month).\n\nSo let's make a simple comparison. Based On your location, age and cost quote, I am guessing the face value Of the U/L gave you is $25000 (based on quotes 45yr old male, Edmonton for $25000 T100 terms).\n\nLet's compare\n\nTFSA vs UL policy over 30 years\n\nSay you create a TFSA portfolio with low cost ETFs. A 70% equity 30% fixed income portfolio say earns 6% annualized. So calculating this, your TFSA after 30 years is $252383.40. Completely tax free, for you to use whenever, as you like, tax free.\n\nFor a UL policy, investment products are generally charged quite high management fees, generally 1.5-2.5%. So even if I give benefit of the doubt to BMO and say their portfolio before management fees outperforms by 0.75%, after fees it earns 5.25%.\n\nIn a UL, we first take your $250 and we charge Alberta taxes of 3%. This becomes $242.50. Then we subtract $38.77. You have now $203.73 going Into the Universal Life account. After 30 years earning 5.25%, the UL policy is worth $178391.21. With a policy face value of $25000, you get $203391.21 upon death. Alright, but say you are healthy, you dont really need insurance so you decide to surrender part of the policy. This is where you run into trouble.\n\nSo the gains are taxed above your costs. You first need to calculate the adjusted cost base (I dont remember if this is before or after the premium tax, but say it Is before for ease and benefit of the doubt (higher ACB, lower taxes).\n\nSo your premiums paid is $90000. We then subtrct the premiums paid which is $13957.20. So your adjusted cost base is $76042.80.\n\nSay you surrender $10000 of the policy(partial surrender). You now have to pay interest income tax. So your taxablr income on this Is calculated as follows....\n\n$10000 - ($10000x ($76042.80÷$178391.21))=$5737.30\n\nSo you have to pay income tax on $5737.30.\n\nIf you surrendered the entire policy, you lose the death benefit, and now you have to pay income taxes on $101348.41.\n\nYou can avoid this by taking a policy loan. But now the interest is being charged on pretty much your own money wittling away the account value. Not so great now eh? Remember I gave two handicaps to the UL policy (eg. superior returns before fees and the taxation ACB)\n\nOf course if you die early, the benefit is likely higher than any gain you probably could get in a TFSA. But since your focus is on the investment aspect, we are looking long term. In this case, you are probably better off with a term with higher benefit and invest the difference especially as you havent maximized your TFSA by the sounds of it. So unless you have maxed all your registered accounts, I wouldnt bother with the UL plan. Even If you anticipate estate issues, a TFSA would likely be better as this is fully tax free.\n\nxgbsSS wrote: ↑ Hi @slim3605\n\nOne alternative you can consider. Here is a plan I would use for you.\n\nSo, I made a few assumptions. The illustration is for a 45 yr old healthy male living In Edmonton. My suggestion is a 20 year term life insurance for $250000 and investing the rest In a TFSA.\n\nhttps://www.term4sale.ca/\n\nWhen I do this, I get a quote from RBC for $34.11 per month. You will then invest the difference from $250 per month in the TFSA. So the investment per month is $215.89 at 6% annual\n\nBenefit #1: If you were to suddenly pass away early, you would get more money for your beneficiaries. With the above UL illustration, at 5 years would be approximately $39004 (growth of cash value to about $14004, plus $25000 face value) whereas this term and invest the rest means $250000 tax free from the policy, $15138 in your TFSA.\n\nBenefit #2 Your spouse can inherit the TFSA as is continuIng the tax free growth of those funds\n\nBenefit #3 The flexibility later On....\n\nAt 65, the investment is now worth $100249. Yes, you don't get $250000 death benefit, but you still have $100249 tax free. If you happen to die at 64, the value is $91904 and $250000 death benefit. UL? $111727.40. Notice how the TFSA is almost the same balance now?\n\nAt age 65, we now bump your TFSA deposit to $250, your TFSA is now at 75 is worth $223567. Sure no death benefit, but the point is, you dont need it anymore (or probably dont anyway)\n\nPermanent insurance Is expensive because it is guranteed the life insurance company WILL have to pay out. Term is cheap because most healthy people dont die before 65 (latest 2017 statistics for Alberta, 20.9 per 1000 males in Alberta starting at age 45 die before 65 (source:https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en ... 1310071001) and remember people buying insurance are in general healthier and more responsible meaning this number is probably lower for insurance applicants). So if the insurance company can almost guarantee to knOw they can keep your money forever after 65, the term quote becomes super cheap.\n\nI hope that helps.

Greatway Financial was started by someone who came from World Financial Group (WFG), which is a larger and similar Multi-Level Marketing company that peddles insurance and other financial products. The problem, and why you'll have trouble getting justice, is the term \"financial advisor\" is only regulated in Quebec. Anyone can use that term otherwise, and there's no legal fiduciary duty to act in their client's interest or sell them the right product.\n\nFolks who say they are \"financial advisors\" in this case are just licensed insurance sales people, who get commissions for either selling products (whether you need it or not), or usually more lucratively, recruiting others to be \"advisors\" themselves to make commissions from their recruits' sales. WFG is very popular in Filipino and East-Indian communities, and Greatway Financial is very Filipino targeted. They prey on people new to the country and with low financial literacy, and exploit the nature of social networks within immigrant communities.\n\nThe solution around provinces regulating the financial advisor term is a decade long unsolved problem that isn't just affecting these MLM companies. Until the provinces (besides Quebec) start regulating advice and introduce a fiduciary duty in that regulation (that can be legally challenged), there is little recourse. I would suggest only taking financial advice from a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), as that certification body enforces a code of ethics for its members and it's the largest one in Canada.\n\nI would write to your MLA/local Provincial Finance Minister and encourage them to make this a priority whichever province you live in.\n\nSomeone from Primerica started World Financial Group (WFG). The only difference between the 2 is WFG reps does not require to buy their own Life insurance compare to Primerica.\n\nxgbsSS\n\nDeal Fanatic\n\n6860 posts\n\n9565 upvotes\n\nRankin Inlet, NU\n\nDhaivatJ5540 wrote: ↑ I own plan from Greatway since last 3 years.

So not only do you get more cash if you were to die, you have completely tax free cash earnings. Additionally, insurance funds are expensively managed. If you are getting $6689 after 3 years, that means that with the risk factor of your funds, you likely would have much more than that.

Have I understood the following correctly?\n\nHigh sales commissions and management fees impact your plan growth and reduce what goes to investment. I have read that sales commissions on whole life can be 100% of the first year premium and there can be a continued annual payouts to the salesperson. Also, that management fees on the investment portion are generally higher than mutual funds.\n\nWhole life insurance doesn't meet your needs as well as term insurance as you progress through life: you need more when you are young with financial obligations like a mortgage, and less when you approach retirement and have your house paid for. With whole life, you can leave a legacy to your family when you die, but at the expense of spending more for it when you are young and have other needs. With term insurance, you can get greater coverage when you really need it, for a fraction of the whole life premiums. And what you don't spend on insurance can go to your long term TFSA/RRSP, or towards a house that will be worth more than your whole life policy in the long run.\n\nIt is claimed that you can borrow tax free against the whole life policy to get income when you retire. But this seems inflexible - what you need in retirement is monthly cash flow, not a lump sum. And you want the money that you don't withdraw to stay invested and keep on growing. Also, if you plan to borrow against your whole life policy at retirement, do you know what the interest rate is going to be in 35 years, or what proportion of the plan value the lender will accept as collateral?\n\nAnd the IRP seems inflexible. With Term Insurance and a TFSA, you can change course and withdraw money for life emergencies, or to buy a house, and reduce your insurance coverage as your term matures.\n\nI suppose these plans have the virtue of simplicity for people who are not sophisticated financially and otherwise have trouble saving. If they can stick to the monthly IRP payments, they will certainly accumulate significant savings during their working years. This is where pressure from the sales agent to continue payments and not \"surrender\" the policy could work to their advantage. But the family that can handle a TFSA successfully is likely to come out ahead.\n\nI would like to get a better understanding since I know the Greatway folks are out there among people I know.\n\nxgbsSS\n\nDeal Fanatic\n\n6860 posts\n\n9565 upvotes\n\nRankin Inlet, NU\n\nDealmaker1945 wrote: ↑ I have never seen the sales pitch myself, but as I understand it these IRP's will come out much worse than buying separate Term Insurance and a TFSA.

Sure, there may be cases where it is important, but for the majority of folks, this isn't the case. We have to remember that RRSPs and TFSAs are fairly new products. In the case of RRSPs, it used to be that you could only buy an annuity upon retirement with the funds. This made it difficult for people to build a legacy to leave to heirs.\n\nThe biggest problem to using permanent insurance is as you guess the cost of doing so. If you were to choose a Universal Life plan, the investment funds have relatively higher MERs. SSQ charges an MER of 3.00% on their funds.\n\nhttps://ssq.ca/en/advisors/individual-i ... e-accounts\n\nSome charge \"low fees\" like Equitable Life\n\nhttps://cdn.equitable.ca/forms/unsecure ... Gen-IV.pdf\n\nBut you have to be careful with some of the options because some of them say zero, but in reality this is the surcharge on top of the performance of the fund. For example in the case of the 0.00% Canadian Value Stock option, the underlying fund is Mackenzie Cundill Canadian Security fund which in itself has it's own MER of over 2%.\n\nIn my experience (I'm not an insurance agent mind you) and reading over the last few years when getting my own life insurance is that Whole Life and Universal LIfe is not really anything different other than Whole Life Insurance is much more restrictive and you cannot choose your investments. What people don't realize is Whole Life is effectively a Universal Life where your investments go into a general fund. Your \"dividends\" are from this fund. The fund itself tends to be extremely conservative.\n\nIn Equitable Life's case\n\nhttps://cdn.equitable.ca/forms/unsecure ... Report.pdf\n\nSee page 5 of the report or pg 7 of the PDF\n\nLondon Life is similar 21ish% equity the rest fixed income\n\nhttps://www.londonlife.com/content/dam/ ... _FINAL.pdf\n\n80%ish fixed income and 20% equity with a chunk of that being preferred shares.\n\nThe basis of both Whole LIfe and Universal LIfe insurance is the same as getting a Term insurance product to age 100. The cost of the insurance is a T-100 which is the cost for you to get a term insurance until you hit the age of 100. Being that most people don't live to 100, this is why the cost is very high because the insurance company pretty much guaranteed to pay out. And because the benefit amount is much lower than what you can get for a term insurance, the benefit of the cash value is very low to begin with especially because you have other options such as a TFSA where all the cash growth is tax free irregardless of whether you are alive or dead or an RRSP where while all the money is considered income, you have benefited from cash flow where the taxes paid are returned to you in your tax return, you have options such as Lifelong Learning, First time homebuyer's as well as credits such as Pension Income credit.\n\nThe tax savings in a permanent insuranace plan here is that any gains during this time is tax deferred or tax free upon an insurable event such as death or a major disability. But in order to get that benefit, this insurable event has to occur. Additionally, unless the insurance policy is not overfunded, it becomes difficult to accumulate cash value for the policy to be freestanding. If the returns on the investments that are very expensive do not keep up, the cost of the insurance policy eats away at the cash value. And with current interest rates being low, Whole Life is going to have a hard time providing returns. Universal Life with the high cost of the funds invested mean that it is harder to justify the limited investment options within the policy. This is why unless your TFSA, and RRSP are not maxed, it is hard to recommend UL policies because the tax deferral/free accounts have much more flexibility with access to lower cost investments.\n\nAnother issue that I find is the one-time tax on premiums deposited. You are paying 2-5% on all your premiums before it is even invested.\n\nhttps://insurance-portal.ca/article/rep ... -premiums/\n\nAll for the \"privilege\" of investing in higher cost investments in an insurance policy.\n\nThat being said, there is a time and place for when this kind of plan works. This is great for self-employed/high investment income, high income net worth individuals who have maxed all their registered accounts.\n\nMy case involves my fairly high income and the fact I have a lot of small business earnings and investment gains on my stock trading and investments. I am running into issues where I have had a lot of gains from stock investments. This is great except that there is taxes that need to be paid on realizing gains. This can become burdensome as I then sometimes have to sell stock to pay my taxes or have cash accumulated on the side. I am not sure what I want to do for the future, but I do know I probably will retire early. Therefore in my case, I decided on a UL policy. This defers gains, and I can either borrow against it or cash it out during years of no income while I wait for my pension to start. Starting my pension through my work too early will result in reduced pay outs. Cashing my UL with my RRSP, I can strategically surrender the policy to match the income level to even out taxes.\n\nOr take an example of someone with a corporation. Part of the problem with corporations is that when it comes time to collapse it, there can be a lot of taxes due should the person die and investments are liquidated. Because of that, an insurance policy can provide tax free cash which will minimize the tax bill as well as cover for capital gains that can be realized. Say for instance a home owned by a corporation. The spouse could find themselves with way less cash because the corporation owns the home and capital gains are due.\n\nBut do you see the big theme with these exceptions? They are high networth individuals where taxes are a huge issue. Permanent Life Insurance in this case acts as another tax deferring vehicle which allows these folks (including myself) to save on income taxes at the high end. For the everyday person where they still have TFSA/RRSP room, considering the taxes on premiums, the cost of the investments, the lack of liquidity options, the fact interest is owed when borrowing against the policy, it is really difficult to justify.\n\nAs an example, let's make a theoretical case.\n\nLet's take person A is a 40 year old healthy male living in Toronto. Say he has $200 a month to put into investments and put towards an insurance policy. He has a family and wants to make sure there is insurance so in case he dies, the mortgage and loans he has are covered. He wants to retire at 60 and the mortgage has about 15 years left. So he decides to look at quote websites. He finds a quote for an RBC 20 year policy at $33.37 for $500000. Perfect, this $500000 would cover the mortgage, give his wife and kids a lump sum of cash in addition to the other assets he has. After submitting the details, the insurance agent starts selling him an IRP.\n\nA great tool I like to use is term4sale. The reason I like this website is you could put any information without your contact info to get a quote. The reason why most ask for email, telephone is because they want to sell you a policy. So just to follow along, I put in Feb 23, 1980, preferred plus health and $500000, postal code M1R and you will see the quote I got.\n\nNow the agent who phones him starts talking about the great benefits to an IRP, how the investments grow tax free(A lie: it is only tax free upon death or insurable event), how this will protect for life (True, but do you really need the face value of insurance for your entire life?) and will provide income for when you retire (possible, but taking the cost savings and investing it in a TFSA or RRSP will also result the same thing).\n\nSo now in Term4Sale, plug in the same information but this time select Term to 100, Guarantee Life Pay. If you selected $500000, now the only quote is for $373.05 from IA. It exceeds our person's budget. Remember this is the cost of insurance only. if you want to grow the cash value, you have to deposits more than this. So in order for the IRP to work, you need a smaller face value. At $100000, you can get a quote for $84.51 from SSQ, the one with the expensive over 3.00% UL funds, oh joy!\n\nSo the difference becomes\n\n1) Buy an insurance policy for 20 years with $500000 benefit for $33.37 per month and invest $166.63 in a TFSA possibly using a cheap roboadvisor or ETFs?\n\nor\n\n2) Buy a permanent UL policy for $84.51 with $100000? The client paying $84.51 will build zero cash value because the cost of the insurance is the same amount. In order to build cash value,, he has to deposit over this amount after the 2% premium tax. So in this case, he deposits the entire $200 into this policy.\n\nIn our example, let's say the TFSA investment grows at 6%. The fees on the TFSA investment are 1%, so net 5% return. To give a benefit of the doubt let's say SSQ provides superior returns at 7.5%, but the fees are 3%, therefore the UL policy returns a net 4.5%. (see how big fees eat into this?)\n\nIn situation 1, after 20 years, we are looking at approximately $68,490 in savings. While the term insurance lapses, by this time this person has paid off their mortgage, his children have gone to school and are independent and he really doesn't need insurance anymore. The $68490 in savings is a chunk of change he decides to help his grandkids with their RESPs etc.\n\nIn situation 2, first the $200 is assessed a 2% Ontario insurance tax so it becomes $192. Then the premium of $84.51 is assessed. $107.49 is remaining for the investment funds. $107.49 on the SSQ funds, despite the better return (remember, I am giving a handicap in this situation, the returns should be similar, and net fees, much worse) return 4.5% annually. After 20 years, the cash value is approximately $41,719. Yes there is $100000 insurance policy, but our person here can't necessarily access this. It is contingent on his death and $100000 isn't exactly a life changing amount. He has no debts, and has income from his pension and other savings. To access the cash value, he has to either borrow money paying interest or surrender the policy which results in taxes on interest income. Remember, insurance policies treat all gains as interest not capital gains or dividends.\n\nSo let's keep going. Say in situation 1, he doesn't need insurance anymore so he keeps depositing $200 per month into the TFSA option. In another 20 years at age 80, this cash has grown to $267997. Meanwhile in situation 2, the cash value is now $144160, with $100000 in insurance benefits. The $100000 benefit doesn't change his situation and the cash value is still taxable upon surrendering. The TFSA in situation 1 is his to do as he pleases.\n\nAnd let's look at the situation where the man passes away early. Say at age 45, he has a heart attack and passes away. The heirs have $500000 and the $11332 cash savings from the TFSA. Situation 2, $100000 and the $7310 in cash value in the policy.\n\nSee what happens in this case? In almost any situation, the term and invest the difference won out. If anyone still has TFSA room with little vision to be able to max it out, there is almost absolutely no reason to buy a permanent insurance product. Remember, this example I gave a huge handicap to the permanent insurance situation. Of course this changes if the TFSA and RRSP are maxed, but most people seem to not be able to maximize this.\n\nLast edited by xgbsSS on Feb 24th, 2020 8:26 pm, edited 1 time in total.\n\nSupport your local Credit Union!\n\nRRSP where you can deposit with a Credit Card, earn rewards investing!\n\nRFD Saskatchewan Pension Plan\n\nDealmaker1945\n\nDeal Addict\n\n3020 posts\n\n2717 upvotes\n\nGTA West\n\nxgbsSS wrote: ↑ In almost any situation, the term and invest the difference won out.

At what point does this become a liability?\n\nI understand BMO wants to gain marketshare, but at what point does allowing a company like Greatway Financial become a liability to their reputation?\n\nThis company makes me stomach curl, especially after their VP of Compliance wrote us a letter stating he finds it perfectly OK to sell IRPs to min. wage workers with no savings, TFSA or RRSP, even well below the age recommendations of the BMO. Awful, and you know they will continue to go full throttle with new branches across Canada until they are stopped by the law.\n\nIf this is the VP of Compliance, just imagine what goes on below his level....this is horrendous, it has to stop.
