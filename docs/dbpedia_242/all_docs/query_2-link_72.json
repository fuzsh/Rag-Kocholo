The editorial discussions in the same embrace the following topics: \"Economic Power Supply for City Railways,\" \"The Steel Rail in City Railways\" and \"Transit Operation in Great Cities.\" THE FINANCIAL SITUATION. Certain tendencies which are being revealed in the course of adjustment of the numerous labor difficulties that are vexing the world of affairs at the present time should not escape observation. For, like the radical Governmental policies which are being so generally advocated, these labor difficulties have an economic aspect which vests them with supreme importance. The doctrines which Mr. Roosevelt is proclaiming, if carried into effect, would mean not only a political revolution but also an economic upheaval, the effect of which would be to destroy confidence in the security and stability of things. Where these factors are lacking, it is not possible for a country to attain its fullest development or for it to take its proper place in the community of nations. In that sense it is a disturbing feature that at the primary elections Mr. Roosevelt's campaign is being attended by such a large measure of success. In all the leading States he is struggling with Mr. Taft for control of the delegates to the National Republican Convention, and even where it was supposed Mr. Taft would have an overwhelming majority, it is found that Mr. Roosevelt is doing at least as well as he. The present week a primary election has been vigorously fought out in Maryland, while down in Texas a contest has also been going on between the adherents of the two candidates. In both States it seems likely that Mr. Roosevelt will get the entire delegations, although the result is admittedly close. There is now more than a bare pcssibility that Mr. Roosevelt will get the National Republican nomination for President next month. Speculators on the Stock Exchange seem to be oblivious to such considerations, or affect to ignore them,though on one or two occasions within the last ten days the stock market has broken wide open before the manipulators could perfect their plans to resist the downward movement, and there has been much evidence to show that if those conducting the bull campaign do not see the significance of current political events, some leading interests in the financial world are not equally blind, but are lightening their loads in order to be prepared for eventualities. But, as already stated, in the labor world there are also many disturbing incidents and the unfortunate feature is that no sooner is one conflict of that kind put in the way of settlement than another is sure to spring up. As a matter of fact, some of the important labor controversies which it was supposed had been definitely placed in process of adjustment are now found to be still far remote from such a happy haven. The contest at the anthracite mines is still an open one, and there has been much rioting the present week in anticipation of next week's general convention, when the miners are to decide whether they will endorse the action of the sub-committee in accepting a compromise agreement or endorse the full committee in rejecting it. As regards the railroads, these are beset with difficulties on every side. The demands of the locomotive engineers for increases in wages and other (VOL. Lxxxxiv. concessions are to be submitted,as is known,to a board of arbitration to be composed of one representative of the engineers and one representative of the railroads', these'two to select five others, and in case they cannot agree the appointments to be made by a body of three consisting of Chief Justice White of the U. S. Supreme Court, Labor Commissioner Neill and Martin A. Knapp, Presiding Judge of the Commerce Court. Very little progress has been made thus far in naming this arbitration board. The railroads have chosen as their representative Daniel Willard, President of the Baltimore & Ohio RR. Co., and the engineers have named P. II. Morrissy, ex-President of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. Beyond this little has been accomplished thus far, it having been found impossible for these two to agree upon the remaining five men. It seems almost certain that some if not all of these five will have to be chosen by Chief Justice White in conjunction with Messrs. Knapp and Neill. If so, the board will, beyond doubt, be so constituted that the engineers will have a dominant influence in it. Chief Justice White may be wholly impartial and we may depend upon it he will not be swayed by political considerations in any way. But what chance will there be of his stand counting for much as against Messrs Neill and Knapp, who have officiated times innumerable in labor disputes and have always displayed a leaning against the railroads. These two men, indeed, are responsible for most of the wage advances which were made in 1910—they acting as arbitrators in numerous cases of that kind—and which have proved such a serious burden to the railroads ever since then. As far as the demands of the Brotherhood of Firemen and Enginemen are concerned, and which, if granted, would add, according to the estimates, from $25,000,000 to $28,000,000 to the yearly expenses of the railroads, not enough time has yet elapsed for the managers of the roads to define their position in the matter. It is obvious that the railroads cannot accede to the demands, since the Inter-State Commerce Commission last year denied them the right to advance their rates. In the meantime trouble has risen in an unexpected quarter. At Chicago 8,000 freight handlers on twenty railroads entering that city have gone out on strike. The possibility of this step had not dawned upon any one. It appears that the union had demanded an increase of five dollars a month for the freight handlers and an addition of one cent an hour for laborers, together with double pay for work on holidays, besides asking for two weeks' vacation each year with full pay, a reduction of a day's work from ten hours to nine hours and a number of other things. The roads at first declined to grant any of the demands, but later offered an increase of $2 50 per month to the freight handlers and of half a cent an hour to the laborers. With this increase the truckers would be receiving $2 25 per day and the checkers and delivery clerks $75 50 per month. This was not regarded as satisfactory, and the managers were told the union would wait until noon Saturday last for a favorable answer. A strike was then ordered without further ceremony and all the union men walked out. This action of the Chicago freight handlers may turn outto have been a fortuitous circumstance. For two or three years everyone has been living in mortal dread of some generalrailroad strike,the fear being that railroad operations would be interrupted, traffic movements interfered with and food and other supplies cut off.

The pecuniary rewards of agriculture ought to suffice to stimulate attention to it; nothing is so fundamentally necessary, nothing has so unfailing a market for its product and nothing has held up before it so great an excess of demand over supply. It ought not to be necessary to hire men to cultivate the soil for profit, or even to provide courses of instruction in that work. Let the States supplement private work. There was no dissenting voice in this week's meeting—and there will be none anywhere—from the proposition \"that -the bankers ought to take a very great interest in teaching the farmers the very best methods of cultiTating their farms and how to rotate in crops so as to make the soil yield the greatest harvests and in the general education of youth, so that they may grow up good farmers.\" Most certainly. The railroads discovered the importance of this years ago, and have been working accordingly, with increasing vigor and effectiveness. They live by carrying things, and therefore they must have things to carry. The bankers also live by \"moving\" things, and they must have things to move. Their interest in this subject is in self-interest as well as in the public interest. Lx-ixxiv. in the East, but, broadly speaking, their energies are devoted to satisfying the ever-expanding needs of the West. - In this sense the growth and development of the Chicago banks is indicative of the growth of the West itself, and of Chicago, its great commercial emporium. The effect of the adverse weather of the winter and early spring upon the fall-sown grain crops in the United States is clearly indicated by the official report of the Department of Agriculture for May 1 issued on Tuesday last. As a result of winter-killing, an abandonment of winter wheat area the greatest in the history of the country has occurred, amounting in some important localities to approximately half of the acreage originally planted, and the condition of the crop on the date mentioned is reported lower than at the corresponding time in any year since 1904. Furthermore the backward and rainy spring has further militated against agricultural interests, delaying preparatory work to such an extent that much less planting had been completed on May 1 than is usually the case. This latter fact is of no especial importance, however, except that it may mean some delay in the coming upon the market of the new crops, and particularly those of which (like potatoes) there is now a very limited supply. The overflow in the Mississippi Valley and contiguous territory has also been a hindering influence. The Department's report on winter wheat May 1, while it indicated a slight deterioration, during the previous month,was rather above general expectations. It made the average condition on that date 79.7, against 86.1 on May 1 last year, 82.1 in 1910 and a ten-year average of 85.2. The abandonment of area resulting from winter-killing was, as intimated above, much larger than in any previous year. It amounted, in fact, to 6,469,000 acres, or 20.1% of the total area seeded last fall, leaving under winter wheat on May 1 only 25,744,000 acres, the smallest acreage since 1899, and comparing with 29,162,000 acres, the area from which the crop was harvested last year. The abandonment of area appears to have been exceptionally heavy in some of the leading wheatgrowing States, involving in Illinois over half of the planting and in Indiana and Ohio 46.5% and 45.2%, respectively, and in the same localities impairment of condition was also greatest. Kansas, however, reports a better status of the crop than a year ago at this time and the same is true of Oklahoma, Texas and Oregon. The Government works out a quantatative estimate of the yield per acre of winter wheat on the basis of the average condition May 1 and the average final yield for a series of years, reaching the conclusion that 79.7 would indicate a product of 14.4 bushels or an aggregate crop of 370,714,000 bushels. This, needless to say, is smaller than the yield of any year since 1904. While it is to be admitted that the winter-wheat crop situation on May 1 was somewhat discouraging there is no real reason for pessimism thus early in the season. Since the first of May 1 favorable weather has been noted over very much the greater part of the winter-wheat territory and reports from such States as Kansas and Nebraska voice expectations of comparatively large crops there. It is marvelous how Chicago is growing in every direction, and particularly how its banking institutions are increasing in size and magnitude. That city now enjoys the distinction of having the largest bank in the United States. There are a number of Chicago banks which rank on a par with the biggest banks in this city, but it remained for the Continental & Commercial National Bank to reach an aggregate of deposits which exceeds even that of the National City Bank of New York. Under the call of the Comptroller of the Currency for a statement of the condition of the national banks on April 18, the National City Bank shows deposits of $228,419,618. The Continental & Commercial National Bank of Chicago for the same date reports deposits of $190,959,580, but this is exclusive of the $26,694,776 deposits of the Hibernian Banking Association, whose entire capital stock is owned by the stockholders of the Continental & Commercial National, and it is also exclusive of the $22,202,836 deposits of the Continental& Commercial Trust & Savings Bank, the stock of which is similarly owned. This makes combined deposits of $239,857,193, which exceeds by over $11,000,000 the $228,419,618 of deposits of the National City Bank of New York. In combined resources the Chicago institution still stands somewhat behind the National City, its aggregate being $286,587,780, against $290,165,606 for the National City Bank. This is owing to the fact that the New York institution has a larger surplus fund than the Chicago bank. In amount of capital paid in there is very little difference. The National City has a capital of $25,000,000. The Continental & Commercial has $21,500,000, while the Hibernian Banking Association has $1,500,000 and the Continental & Commercial Trust & Savings Bank $3,000,000, making for the three combined $26,000,000. That a Chicago institution should be able to record such imposing results is even more significant than for a New York bank to attain a similar distinction. For it is to be said for the Chicago banking concerns that they are banks in the truest and best sense of the word. It cannot be charged that their business is with Wall Street or with the stock market. They The Bank of England on Thursday reduced its cater to the needs of the mercantile community.

[VoL. Lxxxxiv. but no one claimed for it that there might not be a necessity hereafter to modify some of its provisions or that they were not going to proceed further in the path of devolution. The British Government proposes an investigation by Commission into the industrial unrest that now exists in Britain. In a speech before the Bankers' Association in London on Wednesday Mr. Asquith outlined the need of such an investigation. Notwithstanding the country's prosperity, he urged, the signs in the industrial sky ought to be a warning against complacent optimism. The railway and coal strikes were especially significant phenomena which made it the duty of the Government and of business men and bankers alike to look beneath the surface and study the economic fabric piecemeal. The problem of industrial unrest had for some time been the subject of close and careful consideration by the Government, and the Premier invited the bankers of the United Kingdom to contribute towards its solution by suggestion, and, as far as they are able, by wise and fruitful experiments. Lloyd George, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, also addressed the bankers and reiterated his well known views. The whole problem of unrest, he declared, arose from a quite wholesome cause, namely, the desire of workers to improve their condition. The wealth of the world, he said, had increased greatly in the past century and the workers felt that they were not getting their fair share of the increase. Lord Robert Cecil had suggested, said the Chancellor, that the remedy lay in giving the workers a fair share in the profits. That came pretty near syndicalism and any way it carried them very far, perhaps further than Lord Robert Cecil realized. The immediate causes of the unrest,said the Chancellor, were first, the wages;second,that the conditions of life were unworthy of the dignity of the workers' manhood and,third,that the workers were not treated as if they were possessed of minds and souls of their own. Mr. George admitted that there was a good deal to be said in favor of the nationalization of railroads, but this would not end the strikes of railway men. He was impressed, he said, by the suspicious attitude of the workmen toward the interference of the State. The workmen objected to compulsory arbitration by the State, but such a course was inevitable if the nationalization principle were adopted. Nationalization, said Mr. George, ought to be considered as a business proposition, remembering that in fixing the scale of wages and the interest on capital invested, that it was the community that had to pay in the long run. The Cabinet, said the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was conducting an inquiry into the whole problem. It had not decided as yet whether a more searehing investigation was necessary. In the British House of Commons on Thursday night the Asquith Government carried the Home Rule Bill on its second reading by a vote of 372 to 271, a majority of 101,as against 94 at the first reading. The Bill now enters upon its Committee stage and will not be reached, according to the present outlook, unti after the Whitsuntide holidays. Parliamentary authorities predict that the debate will occupy at least two months even after the measure has been formally taken up in the Committee of the Whole House. The Opposition are • preparing a systematic campaign against the measure in the form of amendments and other obstructive methods and it seems quite fair to assume that even when, as now appears probable, Home Rule for Ireland shall pass the Commons, it will still be a long step from actual enactment. The Opposition are depending upon complete defeat of the measure in the Upper House which, notwithstanding the Constitutional changes of last year, will still be effective for the purpose of delay. This delay will mean .according to.the Opposition that the Asquith Government will be defeated and out of power before the three years during which the Lords can hold up the Bill expire. Since the last general election the Government has lost five seats in bye-elections which count 10 votes on division. Meanwhile the Irish Nationalists must continue to support the Government. An incident of interest in the Home Rule situation is that the passage of the Bill on second reading takes place simultaneously with the elimination of the word \"Conservative\" as the official designation of the Tory Party. At a conference of the Conservative and Liberal Unionists parties held on Thursday it was decided there should be a fusion of the two parties under the title \"National Unionist Association.\" Thus the Liberal Unionists who seceded from Mr. Gladstone on his espousal of Home Rule now become part and parcel of the Tory Party. The closing hours of the debate on the second reading of the Bill, to which a full week had been devoted,were tense, but there were none of the acrimonious scenes which attended this stage of former Home Rule bills. Premier Asquith delivered the closing argument. Referring to the Ulster threats, Mr. Asquith said he believed the British people to be just and generous. They detested intolerance and Chinese finances remain in a highly unsatisfactory persecution in any form,but they were not the people condition as a result of continued contention over the to be frightened out of what they believed to be just supervision that is desired by the bankers known as by language of intimidation. The Government, he the Six-Nation Group over the expenditures of the said, had asked repeatedly what further safeguards funds they have been asked to furnish. A new dewere desired but the only answer of the Opposition was velopment this week has been the fact that certain that they would receive from Ulster nothing but of the provinces have begun to contract local loans, unyielding and uncompromising resistance. Dealing the Chih-li Province, for instance, having secured with the safeguards, Mr. Asquith argued that, if the a loan of $3,900,000 through the Austrian legation Irish Parliament passed Acts transcending the bounds from an Austrian firm, giving as security the duties the Goveranment had set,those Acts became void. No on tea, spirits and tobacco. The Che-Kiang Province one was bound to obey them; no one could be punished is also reported to have raised a loan of $1,000,000 for disobeying them. The bill was final in the sense from a German firm on similar security. Press disthat it was the settlement of a long-standing warfare, patches from Peking suggest that, while these pro- MAY 11 1912 THE CHRONICLE visional loans afford temporary relief, they necessarily complicate the national loan problem. The new Chinese Assembly yesterday passed a resolution demanding that the Government submit a budget without delay, in order that the people may know how the Government spends its money Several of the members of the Assembly asked that an investigation of the Nanking Government's finances be made. The confidential letter that President Taft wrote to former President Roosevelt and unfortunately made public continues the source of active criticism in the British press. In this letter, our readers will recall, the President expressed the opinion that the successful culmination of the reciprocal agreement would make Canada an adjunct to the United States. On May 6 Arthur Shirley Benn and Henry Page Croft,both Unionist members, plied the Premier with questions of an exceedingly blunt character bearing upon the matter. Mr. Asquith, who plainly showed his resentment at the attack, sharply repudiated the reflections cast on James Bryce, British Ambassador at Washington,and declared that the Ambassador had in no way influenced the views or policy of the late Canadian Government, and that as the correspondence between President Taft and Mr. Roosevelt was private, Mr. Bryce could not have had any knowledge whatever of it. Later in the week Sir Edward Grey, the foreign Secretary, officially denied rumors of the retirement of Mr. Bryce as Ambassador to the United States. Sir Edward stated categorically in the House of Commons that the Ambassador, who is now on his way to Australia to study political sociological conditions there at first hand,would return to Washington at the beginning of September and resume his duties. Special significance is being attached in some quarters to the announcement this week of the appointment of Marschell von Bieberstein as German Ambassador at London following the retirement of Count Wolff-Metternich. Baron von Bieberstein is at present the German Ambassador at Constantinople and,according to cable dispatches from the Turkish capital, Baron Pallavicini—the Austrian Ambassador to Turkey—will leave immediately for Vienna. The simultaneous departure of these diplomats has suggested the theory that Germany has decided to change her attitude of neutrality in the war between Italy and Turkey and cooperate with Austria in the interest of Italy. Germany is now supposed to be jealous of the progress that England is making in Constantinople, based to some extent on the statement by members of the English Cabinet in the British Parliament that England supported Turkey's right to close the Dardanelles. While not necessarily for war purposes, it is officially announced that the Imperial Ottoman Bank has concluded an arrangement with the Turkish Government whereby the Bank has an option on a .£10,000,000 loan. In consideration of this option the Bank has advanced an immediate loan against £1,500,000 Turkish Treasury bills which will soon be issued in London or Paris. Reports have been cabled during the week of a Turkish victory in repulsing the Italian invasion of the Turkish island of Rhodes in the Aegean Sea. Dispatches from Rome deny this alleged victory and claim that the Turkish leaders were captured. Mexican affairs seem to have entered upon a calmer and more satisfactory stage. There is in fact not lacking an element of humor in the situation. One 1277 development is that the provisional President of Mexico —Gen. Gomez—has been ordered by Gen. Orozco, Commander of the rebels, to leave Mexico, and that other revolutionist leaders are also repudiating him. Our State Department at Washington yesterday received reports that uprisings were becoming general in Southern Tamaulipas, Northern Vera Cruz and the eastern part of San Luis Potosi, all in the eastern part of Mexico. The rebels have also renewed their activities at Tres Marias, Morelos. Considerable excitement, our State Department is informed, prevailed at Salina Cruz, and the State Department is advised that 100 refugees will board the army transport Buford when it arrives there. A similar number will probably board at Acapulco and Manzanillo and about twenty at San Blas. The Madero troops are reported to have routed a force of 1,000 rebels at Zaragoza on Thursday morning. But no decisive engagement has yet taken place. Some little improvement in the cotton goods trade of the United States is reflected by the dividend record of the Fall River mills for the second quarter of 1912, but the exhibit is much less satisfactory than for the corresponding period in most recent previous years. Six corporations that had made no distribution for the first quarter have resumed payments to shareholders, but eight other establishments, including such prominent concerns as the American Linen Co., the Hargraves Mills, the Seaconnet Mills and the Stafford Mills are still among the non-payers. As for the remaining twenty-two mills, it is to be said that the rate of dividend for the period mentioned is in nine instances lower than in 1911 and in thirteen cases (most of them the conservative corporations that have pursued the same course for a long time, whether earnings warrant or not) distribution has been upon the usual quarterly basis. The aggregate amount to be distributed in dividends for the second quarter of 1912 is only $287,117, or an average of 1.03% on the capitalization of $27,756,670, whereas in the period of 1911 there was paid out a total of $341,025, or 1.23% and in 1910 no less than $443,650 or 1.67%. Furthermore, in only three out of the sixteen years since 1896 has a lower second-quarter rate than that of the current year been paid and in 1906 stockholders received 2.21%. Consequently for the elapsed half-year stockholders have not fared well, having received on the average less than 2% (1.87%) as against 2.83% in 1911 and 3.59% in 1910. The highest half-yearly rate in our record is 4.70% in 1907 and the lowest 0.76% in 1898. In connection with the foregoing it is perhaps well to state that the improved situation in the cotton goods trade has not been existent long enough to make any important showing in the manufacturing insdutry as yet, but with the present more favorable relation between the cost of the raw material and the selling price of the finished product, and a continuing good demand, much better results are expected for the remainder of the current year. To settle labor difficulties in some quarters of New England and to prevent them at Fall River and elsewhere, it has been necessary to grant increases in wages at a time when conditions hardly seemed to warrant them, but having been accorded, they have to be reckoned with in figuring out the margin of profit. The gratifying feature is that the demands of labor having been practically satisfied, there would seem at the moment to be no reason to anticipate further trouble from that direction in the near future. It follows, therefore, 1278 THE CHRONICLE [VoL. Lxxxxiv. that the main desideratum to foster prosperity in as usual of late, being taken by India.

In fact, underwriters will, it is believed, be well satisfied with distributing commitments they have already undertaken, instead of entering on a large scale into new ones. Call money during the week has ranged between 29 and 3%, these figures, in fact, being the lowest and highest for each day of the week, with the single exception of Tuesday, when 23% was the lowest and 3% the highest. The ruling rate throughout the week has 4%. Time money, as remained without change at 23 we have already shown, has continued easy in tone. Closing quotations remain unchanged at 3@3M% for sixty days, 33% for ninety days, 33@,31A% for four and five months and 33'@39% for six months. Mercantile paper has been in better demand, and while formal quotations have not been changed from the final figures of last week, it has been possible to do business at or very close to the minimum,instead of at the maximum figures. The closing quotations are 4 to 43% for sixty and ninety days' endorsed bills receivable, and also for four to six-months' single name bills of choice character. Some business was reported at 34%, however. Single-name bills not classed as choice are still quoted at 5%. Sterling exchange ruled rather nervous-during the week. •It was inclined to easiness during the major part of this period in anticipation of the reduction in the Bank of England's official discount rate, and also in the expectation that foreign bidding for the New York City bond issue would be substantial and successful. The expectation was realized, of course, in the instance of the English Bank rate. While no definite figures are available that seem to be reasonably responsible, it is not believed that the foreign subscriptions to the New York loan were up to expectations. The exchange market closes at a net decline of 15 points for the week. The continued ease in the local money situation will, of course, militate against any further withdrawal of foreign balances by our bankers.

On Tuesday the opening was weak and lower, demand and cable transfers selling down to 4 8675 and 4 87, respectively, during the forenoon; later, however, the market steadied and closed unchanged for demand, though cable transfers finished slightly easier at 4 8705@4 8710 and sixty days declined to 4 8420@4 8430.

ITALY AT THE DARDANELLES. The recent turn of events in the war between Italy and Turkey has shown that this ill-judged conflict is approaching, if it has not already reached, a critical stage. The circumstances are so peculiar and instructive that they necessitate a review in some detail of the preceding incidents. This war was declared on the 28th of last September, when the Italian Government announced its purpose of seizing the two towns of Tripoli and Cyrene, in the Tripolitan domain of Turkey, across the Mediterranean from Italy, and when it coupled this announcement with the demand that the Turkish Government agree to continuance of such occupation and,to a formal protectorate by Italy. The war has, therefpfe, continued for something more than seven months. 1280 THE CHRONICLE [VoL. Lxxxxxv. At its outbreak,the Italian Government's action was 'against foreign men-of-w ar; but, more than this, it is greeted with severe and hostile criticism in practically guarded by two Turkish castles on each side of the every nation of the world, the sentiment, very plainly stream which, though inadequate in themselves as expressed, being that the war had been undertaken at modern fortifications, are manned with Krupp guns, an extremely awkward moment in continental diplo- and occupy such a position as to command the strait macy, and that the grounds of provocation were inade- and render an effort of a hostile ship to enter it wholly quate.

From this quarter, at any rate, positive and continuous assaults on the whole Ministerial policy are reasonably to be expected. The end may be another Ministry, placed in power to settle the matter with whatever grace it can. The one fact clear from the course of events to date is that Italy's rash experiment of last autumn is a failure. The civilized world, we think, will say that this is fortunate. Nations hereafter will be apt to move more slowly in the field of such political adventure as foreign land-grabbing. Last year's experience in the Morocco matter will certainly not add to the taste for this sort of achievement. Furthermore the expedient, perhaps the most dangerous in the politics of nations, of bolstering up a weak home ministry through picking quarrels with other governments, is likely to be discredited by Italy's experience, as it has not been by any episdoe in modern years. It will be fortunate for civilization if the TurcoItalian War ends in such a way as to impress this lesson. on the mind of the world at large. THE TRUST COMPANY AND THE PROPOSED CONTROL OF INDUSTRIES. [FINAL ARTICLE.] For the reasons given in our previous article,the trust company is essentially a State institution. And it is so because it builds its credit-making power out of the business of section and locality. The trust company is also a metropolitan institution. It cannot exist in all its powers in a small community. It will never become dominant there in the distinctive sense of fulness of being, because there are not to be found the great corporations, the concentrated business, the complicated commercial and financial relations, and the individuals dependent, because of these very complexities, on the helpfulness of just such an institution. Now, while the city is to some extent operating in many instances under special charters,an independent political organism, its only allegiance is to the State. The very fabric of all local control is made by the people of the State. It gets its original charter by the permission of the State. All the governing powers of the State are its masters. All the people who make the State are its first customers. It cannot escape an allegiance to their interests first. It must serve them first. And the constituency of the trust company are the citizens of the great municipality in which it is located, with all their interests and burdens. It is the State legislature, by virtue of its action under a State constitution, that can alone determine and grant the many powers of the trust company. To place the granting of these in the hands of Congress 'would be to make the trust company one of those favorites of fortune that hang on the heels of Federal interference, and which subsist, not on their inherent rights because of service rendered, but of favors granted. There is much being said about the rule of the \"interests.\" There is hint of a growing oligarchy of wealth,in which the rich are preferred,not onlyin office,but in law. If the trust company, which is to guard the interests of the orphan and the incompetent,which is to perpetuate the power of an estate to a generation that is to come, if it is to thus conserve the great principle of individualism in our system of business and government,then it ought not to be made a beggar at the gate of the nation 1281 for its right to exist and its powers to serve and help. All that it is and all that it does ought to come from the people it serves first. Thus will it serve them best. And thus will it be bottomed on the only thing that can preserve it and give it lasting vitality—the good-will and patronage of those who need it and use it. The truth is that State lines are not altogether the protection to the corporate form that they ought to be, because they are imaginary lines and not the lines of production and industry. There is but one real law of control, and that is the law of service. There is but one means of service, and that the power of locality. It is impossible in our very, nature as a government and people that these two ideas of control or spheres of control should be identical. The best that can be said is that the State is nearer to the seat of power than the nation. The mere fact that the operation of the trust company is so often across State lines does not change this primal law. It is that which we produce that we exchange. It is the race, the epoch and the soil and climate that control. But if there is a security of functioning at home it will follow the company to the antipodes. As the trust company is now constituted and operated it is antagonistic to monopoly. It gathers strength but to disburse it. If there is in the concentration into the hands of one board of directors a financial power that comes from the industries and thrift of the people, it cannot be exercised save in response to demand and the law of profits. The funds must go where they are wanted and where they will earn. They cannot be diverted to the interests of a remote section, as might be the case under the operation of national control. In the creation of credit and its dissemination the trust company will send its strength where there is need and where there is that which but waits the touch of capital to be developed. The basis of strength being in local business power, the trust company cannot combine to force development contrary to need and demand. It is not, as a rule, like the financial institutions of the East, the recipient of the bounty of a territory which comes voluntarily Lo it because of exchange with the nations of the earth. The trust company is a growth of the last twenty-five years. It is not a dealer in international exchange in the same way and for the same reason as is the bank. It is a dealer in the securities of other corporations in that it scatters them in the hands of the people and guarantees to the people that they are properly issued. It is not primarily concerned with a reserve to meet the exigencies of commercial demand, and therefore does not seek to become the holder of any great amount of gold. It does not issue and needs no basis of issue. It is first fiduciary, and because it is fiduciary it becomes financial. Each is an independent organism, and needs not even the support of others. If it encouraged monopoly in the formation of industrial and transportation companies, it would by so much limit its own field of operation. It is the friend of the corporation as an independent integer seeking to improve the facilities of a certain section or people. What would it be if it sought to consolidate all railroads and all industries of like character? Not that trust companies in some instances have not become great promoters and perhaps exercised a power of tyrannical choice as to men and districts. But, speaking of the power which is inherent because of nature and needs, the trust company tends to diffuse the wealth of the people into the hands of those who through thrift and 1282 THE CHRONICLE [voL.
