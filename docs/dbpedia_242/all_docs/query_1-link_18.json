        "text": "Janet passed peacefully at Oakville Trafalgar Memorial Hospital with her family by her side. Beloved wife of Lionel (Barry) for 70 years and mother of Richard, Charles and John. Cherished grandmother of Jamie, Michael, Joanne, Jessie, Elizabeth, Kristen, Brandon and Lauren. Great-grandmother to Chloe, Tyler, Julia, Bryce and Emily. Loving friend to daughters-in-law Dawn, Karen and Kathy.\n\nBorn in Winnipeg, Janet (nee Hurley) grew up in Yorkton, Saskatchewan and graduated as a teacher from the University of Saskatchewan (Saskatoon). She returned to Yorkton and was working as a teacher at Yorkton Collegiate when in 1945 she met Lionel Drayton, from Barbados, when he was stationed at the airbase in Yorkton as part of his pilot training in the RAF. After a whirlwind courtship, they were married in Vancouver on August 6, 1945. Shortly thereafter he was sent to England, demobilized towards the end of 1945 and sent back to Trinidad, where he had enlisted. They were reunited in 1946 and settled in Barbados. In 1949 they decided to immigrate to Canada where Lionel took a job with the Ford Motor Company in Calgary, Alberta. They moved to Oakville in 1960 and fell in love with it, the house on Morrison Road becoming the hub of family activity for the next 56 years, until Lionel passed away in January 2016.\n\nJanet was a warm, engaging and truly selfless person, devoted to her family, friends, community and church. She volunteered extensively in local service organizations and at St. Cuthbertâ€™s church. She was always there to love and cherish family members, listening to their concerns, supporting and praising their achievements and keenly interested in every detail of their lives. A staunch Canadian, politics and the events of the world were of great interest to her right up until her last few days. She loved poetry and literature, and even at 96 could recite many of her favourite poems from memory. She particularly appreciated a clever pun, and was always up for composing a good rhyme. She will always and forever be in our thoughts."
