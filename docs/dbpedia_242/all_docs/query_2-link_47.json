While trade recovery is not making the rapid headway that had been expected, new favorable features are constantly developing, and these cannot fail to exert a widely beneficial effect. The steady appreciation in the value of the British pound sterling on its way to par is one of these, and not the least of them. Yesterday demand bills on London moved up to 480%,or to within six cents of par. This is an evidence of financial strength and of growing stability of which Great Britain may well feel proud. And the event is the more noteworthy as Great Britain is making large yearly payments here on her indebtedness to the United States. When the Debt Settlement between the United Kingdom and this country was reached, requiring these large payments, a class of croakers and pessimists freely ventured the prediction that the pound sterling would never return to par—it was out of the question so long as she was obliged to carry such a burden. But events have quickly falsified the prediction. The truth is, the action of Great Britain in boldly determining to meet her obligations, and showing confidence in her ability to do so, has been a strengthening instead of a weakening influence. For one thing it has once more served to attract supplies of capital to her doors on the assurance that they would be safe. The return to power in Great Britain of the Conservative Party, and the elimination of the Labor Party, has operated in the same direction, in making the assurance of the safety of capital doubly sure. Previously there had been a tendency on the part of capital, even in Great Britain, to seek safety Bank and Quotation Section Bankers' Convention Section NO. 3109e in flight. That is a thing of the past now, and the improvement in exchange rates is evidence of the fact. At the same time financial conditions are improving all over Europe. The printing presses have stopped turning out paper currency, and gold is once more coming to be the accepted standard. Paul M. Warburg referred to this the present week in his remarks at the annual meeting of the International Acceptance Bank. And all this must redound to the advantage of the whole world. The extent to which the signing by the United States of the agreement relating to the share of this country in the reparations to be paid by Germany under the Dawes plan has involved us in European affairs has been freely discussed in the Allied capitals of Europe, in Washington and on this side of the Atlantic generally. France and Great Britain have been inclined to express the belief that we have at last become a \"partner\" with them and other Allied nations in European affairs. Washington on its part has been prompt to puncture such suggestions and to show that they are without foundation. In fact, in a special dispatch from that centre to the New York \"Times\" on Jan. 16 it was stated that \"a White House spokesman held to-day that no other obligation rested upon the United States through the Paris settlement than an agreement to accept the terms of payment laid down. The spokesman added that the United States wanted the Dawes plan of reparations adjustment to succeed and that President Coolidge desired that fact to be known at all times.\" On the other hand,in the French Chamber of Deputies the same day Deputy Bonnet was quoted as saying, \"instead of a silent observer, America sent us an official delegate with full powers, he who tomorrow will conduct the foreign affairs of the United States. This result of establishing unity of the Allied front is most valuable of all from the reparations point of view, from the political point of view, and even from the point of view of our security.\" M. Clementel, the French Finance Minister, was reported to have declared during the same session of the Chamber that \"America's participation in European affairs by sharing in the Dawes annuities is an insurance policy on the payment of reparations.\" In reply to accusations and interruptions by members the Finance Minister was reported to have declared that\"American participatinn is beyond price. It has post us nothing. We should have been glad to pay highly for it.\" According to a special London cable message to the New York \"Times\" at that time, \"in both Brit- 366 THE CHRONICLE ish official circles and among Americans who have recently been in Paris the opinion was expressed today that the view taken at the White House as to the effect of decisions of the financial conference in Paris on the United States attitude toward European affairs was correct.\" In another London dispatch to the \"Times\" the next day the correspondent reported that \"it has been declared in British official quarters that. 'there is no desire to implicate the United States in any plans connected with the collection of reparations under the Dawes scheme, and that it is not seen why the work so lately accomplished in Paris should implicate the Washington Government.' At the same time British spokesmen declared their satisfaction that the United States was now more closely connected with the Dawes plan.\" He added that \"the distinction thus drawn is generally regarded here as a very fine one. In unofficial circles there is a disposition to consider that the benefits secured under the Dawes plan imply liabilities for the proper execution of that plan, at least in a moral if not in a political sense.\" The whole matter was brought up in the United ' States Senate on Jan. 17, when it was reported by a representative of the New York \"Times\" that \"threats heard in the Senate corridors for some days that an uprising of the grreconcilables' was imminent, because of the American agreement with the Allies in reference to the collection of German reparations'payments under the Dawes plan, assumed tangible form to-day when Senator Hiram Johnson of California introduced a resolution calling on the State Department to make available to the Senate ' the text of the agreement signed by Ambassadors 'Kellogg and Herrick and Colonel James A. Logan, American observer with the Reparations Commission, at the conference just held in Paris.\" He added that \"Senator Johnson said his information concerning American activities at this conference was limited to dispatches in the newspapers, but from these he had drawn the conclusion that the United States had been committed by agents of the State Department to a compact under which America was to obtain a share of the German reparations payments. If such a compact were to be binding, he said it would appear that this country would be forced to assume responsibility for its enforcement if Germany were to default.\" Two days later Secretary Hughes issued a denial of the suggestions voiced by irreconcilable Senators that the agreement entered into at Paris last week by representatives of the Allies and the United States committed this Government to participation in the political affairs of Europe in connection with the distribution of German reparations annuities. The New York \"Times\" representative in Washington said that \"the unusual course adopted by the Secretary in issuing such a statement in advance of the adoption of the resolution offered Saturday by Senator Johnson of California calling for information as to the Paris agreement left the irreconcilable group uncertain as to what step to take next, but it was apparent from what was said by members of the group that they do not intend to permit their agitation to die and that they will consider measures designed to show that the Coolidge Administration has permitted the United States to ,become involved in the politics of Europe.\" [Vol.. 120. Naturally, the Allied Governments of Europe not only were eager to have the representatives of the United States sign the whole agreement, and .not merely the part relating to the right of the United States Government to share in the reparations funds collected under the Dawes plan, but also that nothing should occur to change the steps taken by the United States at the recent conference of Finance Ministers in Paris. Accordingly, it was not surprising that British and French Government officials should have been disposed to grant the request of the United States for certain changes in the terms of the agreement. The Paris representative of the New York \"Times\" cabled on Jan. 19 that \"even now, six days after it was signed, the text of the Finance Ministers' accord on the distribution of the Dawes annuities is not final. A request has been received from the American delegation that several phrases in the wording of the agreement be slightly modified. There is no question of altering the meaning of the text or its stipulations. It is only a few small points in the wording which the American delegation, after consultation with Washington, wishes changed.\" The correspondent added that \"these proposed changes are being examined by conference experts and by the secretaries of the conference and will be submitted for approval to the Allied Governments through the medium of the Conference of Ambassadors, possibly this but more probably next week. Very,close secrecy is still being observed in conference circles regarding Ambassador Kellogg's last-minute proposal to make signature of the whole agreement dependent on ratification. It appears there was an understanding among the delegates that the request should be treated as confidential, and the few persons to whom the incident was described were bound to secrecy. This excessive carefulness on the part of the Americans has had the effect of halting action on the agreement and thus causing a little delay, but the alterations proposed are said to be so trifling that it is unlikely there will be any great difficulty in obtaining their approval.\" It was made perfectly clear, and even emphatic, in Washington dispatches as the week progressed that President Coolidge was fully in accord with the views expressed by Secretary of State Hughes with respect to the signing of the Paris agreement by representatives of the United States. On Jan. 20 the Washington representative of the New York \"Times\" said that \"President Coolidge, informally but nevertheless emphatically, took cognizance today of Senatorial attacks on the Paris agreement for our participation in the Dawes plan annuities in settlement of our Rhine army and damage claim bills against Germany.\" The correspondent added that \"through an authorized White House spokesman the President declared that no commitments whatever were undertaken by the United States Government in the Paris agreement, that we have agreed to do nothing except accept payment and that Secretary Hughes, whose statement yesterday was seen and approved by the President before being issued, has made clear the whole question. The President, it was stated, holds that the Hughes statement is quite sufficient to cover the issue raised and that he now regards the matter as a closed issue. While the President saw no necessity for elaboration of the Hughes statement, he did let callers at the White House know that he is in thorough accord with the JAN. 24 1925.] THE CHRONICLE Secretary's statement and, that he does not believe the United States is committed legally or morally to any course of action in Europe by reason of the Paris agreement.\" That the same view was taken by American representatives in Paris was cabled by the New York \"Herald Tribune\" representative on Jan. 20. In part he said: \"The American diplomatic colony in Paris to-day was united in predicting that the controversy the irreconcilables have started in the Senate will subside when the full text of the Paris agreement, or. the essential sections, are available in Washington. Far from pledging the United States to help the Allies enforce the reparations clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, it is maintained that the Allies r w recognize the Berlin Treaty, and the United States signature rests on nothing but a sort of annex to the Dawes plan,in which the American claims ale accepted without even the scrutiny of the Reparations Commission, or being made subject thereto in the future. Colonel James A. Logan Jr., American observer with the Reparations Commission and a member of the delegation at the recent conference, has cabled Secretary Hughes a brief digest of the document, omitting the bulk of the 28 articles, which do not mention the United States and represent specific agreements among the Allies. In no case can a phrase or paragraph be found entangling the United States in any obligation, Mr. Logan maintains. The American claims, he contends,rest on the basis of the Berlin Treaty arrangement, whereas all other claims must pass through the Renarations Commission in accordance with the Versailles Treaty.\" In spite of Secretary Hughes's statement and the information forthcoming from the White House on Jan. 21, \"Secretary Hughes was called upon by the &nate for a copy of the Paris reparations agreement, together with such information concerning the circumstances surrounding the negotiations 'as may be necessary to a full understanding of its terms.' A resolution of inquiry by Senator Johnson, Republican, of California, one of the Senate irreconcilables, was adopted without discussion. The proposal was approved and broadened by the Foreign Relations Committee just before the Senate met. The committee added an amendment asking that this be accompanied by a report regarding the negotiations at Paris in which Ambassador Kellogg, the Secretary of State designate, Ambassador Herrick and John A. Logan participated as representatives of the United States.\" Official Washington was much interested in the possible bearing on this situation of a dinner given by President Coolidge the same evening to members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. These men and a few others were supposed to have been invited to listen to a discussion of the Lausanne Treaty by Richard Washburn Child, former Ambassador to Italy. It was reported that Secretary of State Hughes declined an invitation to the dinner because of the presence of Senator Borah. The controversy was carried further in the United States Senate on Thursday by Senator Borah. Commenting upon his speech, the Washington representative of the New York \"Times\" said that \"the possibility of repudiation is the real problem America faces with respect to the French debt, Senator Borah, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, declared in the Senate to-day in an impas- 367 sioned speech in reply to the speech made yesterday in the French Chamber of Deputies by M. Mann, asserting that it would be iniquitous for us to collect the ;4,000,000,000 France owes us in view of her sacrifices in blood.\" The question of paying inter-Allied war debts has been discussed in a more or less promiscuous way in some of the Allied capitals of Europe and also at Washington, and in this country generally. The matter has not been taken up at formal conferences on either side of the Atlantic, so far as reported. Etienne Clementel, French Finance Minister, was quoted by a Paris, correspondent of the New York \"Evening Post,\" in an interview on Jan. 19, as saying that \"you who have been in France must have. realized that in my country there is a'strong public opinion. The French people are naturally inclined to feel that the 1,500,000 war dead, by their sublime sacrifice, have paid their debt in blood.\" In elaboration of his statement the Finance Minister was reported to have said that \"I still maintain my position, which is expressive of a large proportion of French public opinion. Many Frenchmen do feel that if, in the scales which weigh the contribution of each State to the common victory, the blood which was spilled cannot be weighed, at least France has the right to hope that the rank she occupies as a mourning and devastated country will give her the right to legitimate leniency in the domain where granting of compensation is to be considered. That was my personal opinion and still is my personal opinion. It is my right to have this opinion. I would reiterate it any time in front of a gallows or before a firing squad.\" The correspondent also said that \"M. Clementel, intensely laboring under the feeling that he is misunderstood in America, said: 'As for insinuations which have appeared in the press in the United States that I said France would not pay her war debts, such statements are again most unfair. You can see that I have written in substance that France does not intend to repudiate any of her contracts, and that her signature always will remain sacred.\" As illustrative of another phase of French opinion on the question of war debts, the Paris representative of the New York \"Herald Tribune\" cabled on Jan. 19 also that \"a statement, which in view of possible political developments in France may be of greatest importance in connection with France's foreign debts, was issued by the 'French League' to-day, demanding that the French Government refuse to carry on separate debt negotiations with the United States.\" He explained that \"the league, which counts among its 42,000 members the cream of the intellectuals in France, was founded in 1914 by Ernest la Visse, the historian, and General Pau. Its summing up of the debt situation may be reckoned generally as that of the growing Government opposition in both Houses of Parliament, and also of former President Millerand and his 'Fascist' organizations.\" It was also set forth in the dispatch that \"the League deprecates the Washington Government's decision against an international debt conference, and in view of this demands a general European debt meeting, to which the United States would send an observer.\" The suggestion was made \"that the League's position might without great difficulty become the official position before the wheels of negotiation are turned 368 THE CHRONICLE round to a settlement that cannot be discounted. This position is not far from that of the old Bloc Nationale under former Premier Poincare. The statement continues that when the time is ripe for negotiations on political debts the first business will be to revise not only the high war rate of interest, but to wipe off from the French debt all sums collected by the British and American Treasuries in the form a war profits.\" Seemingly as more specifically representing the attitude of the French Government, the Paris correspondent of the New York \"Times\" cabled that \"the French Government to-day regards the reduction of more than half of France's debt to England as virtually obtained. The final achievement of this result is bound to have important bearing on negotiations for settlement of the French debt to the United States. At the Quai d'Orsay it is not expected that an inter-Allied debt conference will be called soon, but that conversations with London will go on in diplomatic channels until the matter is further advanced.\" The war debt question was discussed in Washington in about as indefinite a way as elsewhere. It seems that \"a demand that France give some promise of an arrangement to pay her debt to the United States was made in the House late this afternoon [Jan. 17] by Representative Hamilton Fish of New York, who argued that French officials were bound to furnish an assurance on this point.\" The New York \"Times\" representative explained that \"Mr. Fish's speech, which was made in the course of a discussion over whether the life of the World War Debt Funding Commission should be extended until February 1927 seemed to fall upon unsympathetic ears, several members declaring that neither the Debt Commission, the House, nor the Administration was in favor of cancellation of the French debt, and that it was poor diplomacy to air the matter in Congress.\" After considerable discussion,\"the bill extending the life of the Debt Commission for another two years was finally adopted.\" In a cable message on Jan. 21 the Paris represen• tative of the Associated Press said that \"Opposition efforts to draw from Premier Herriot a statement on inter-Allied debts failed in the Chamber of Deputies to-day. The Premier, however, will include the subject in his declaration on foreign policy in the present discussion, expected to last through the week.\" The apparent attitude of at least certain factions in the French Government on the question of France paying her war debts was outlined by the Paris representative of the New York \"Times\" in a cable dispatch on Jan. 21. In part he said: \"By its applause Ito-day the Chamber of Deputies indicated its attitude in favor of binding the French Government to undertake no settlement of war debts except on a basis which takes into account all the circumstances in which those debts were contracted. Repeatedly, throughout the morning and afternoon, cheers and applause came from all sides of the House, Nationalists and Socialists alike giving their approval to the words of Louis Mann,former Minister of the Poincare Administration, as he laid before his hearers a five-hour plea that the cost of the war to France in life and property and her service to the world in holding up the German onslaught till the Allies were ready to share the burden should be set off against the cash value of what was borrowed while serving in ,[17of,. 120, a common cause.\" He added that \"some of the phrases in his speech which will probably become catchwords in subsequent popular discussion of the debt question include: 'Must we pay now for the tunics and rifles of the 350,000 men who fell between the time of America's declaration of war and the first entry of her troops into action?\"Are lives and limbs lost on the battlefield of less value than money loaned?\"Are the terms of the peace treaty insisted on by America and never ratified not worth some compensation?'\" According to a special Washington message to \"The Sun\" Thursday evening, \"the outburst of Deputy Mann in the French Chamber of Deputies demanding in effect cancellation of the French debt to the United States and declaring it would be a moral iniquity if France were compelled to pay is not taken seriously by officials in Washington,including members of the Debt Commission.\" It was stated also that \"a high Treasury official said to-day that the outburst from Mann was that of a radical and not to be taken as representative of French attitude. 'They have radicals in France as well as in the United States,' it was explained, and Mann's statements cannot be given great weight or consideration.\" According to the New York \"Times\" yesterday morning, \"groups of American bankers who had been considering plans for the sale of new issues of French industrial and municipal bonds hurriedly altered their plans yesterday. For more than a month they had been waiting for the agitation over Franco-American debt missives to subside, and this week they had begun,to take heart only to find that the whole situation had been changed again. Revival of the discussion_ of France's war debt arose from the statement of Louis Mann, a former Minister in the Poincare regime, made on Wednesday in the French Chamber of Deputies. The enthusiastic response which greeted his speech was more disturbing to some bankers than the statement itself. It showed, according to them, that his speech mirrored the viewpoint of the entire Chamber of Deputies and, presumably, of the French electorate.\" This feeling, said to have been entertained by American bankers, found substantiation in cable dispatches from Paris yesterday morning. For instance, the New York \"Herald Tribune\" said that \"editorial comments tonight in newspapers of all shades of political opinion leave no doubt that Deputy Louis Mann, formerly Under Secretary of State and a member of the Millerand Republican League, expressed the popular feeling of France when he aroused the Chamber of Deputies to enthusiasm last night with his appeal that the debt question be lifted from a business basis to moral grounds in consideration of France's war sacrifices. The Right Wing Deputy's sentiments are echoed in the press, coupled with attacks on the United States for its 'materialistic view' regarding payment of debts contracted in the common cause. Despite this the enthusiasm of the Chamber majority cooled slightly to-day in the thought that perhaps Mann had gone too far. His speech failed of approval, as the majority abstained from voting. Reiterating that France does not deny her debts and does not refuse to pay what she owes, the 'Temps' says all that France asks is that she be treated with no less generosity than the Allies showed to Germany, defeated and bankrupt.\" So great confusion and disorder developed over the question of war debts in the French Chamber of JAN. 24 1925.] THE CHRONICLE Deputies yesterday, according to a Paris Associated Press dispatch last evening, that it became necessary to suspend the session. Word came from Washington last evening also that \"the United States has sent a reply to the memorandum from M. Clementel, the French Finance Minister,in regard to the French indebtedness.\" It was stated also that \"the answer, like the Clementel note, was unofficial and its general purport was that the French Minister's note did not afford a basis of negotiations. Up to the present, the American Government has had no official proposal that there should be negotiations for the funding of the debt.\" Premier Herriot of France has adopted a sound financial policy, at least so far as new inflation is concerned. His ideas were approved informally even by the Opposition in the Chamber of Deputies on Jan.17. In the course of a debate \"on measures to be taken to facilitate German reparations payments in kind for the benefit of the devastated regions,\" the Premier declared that there should be no new inflation, \"however hard the consequences.\" The New York \"Times\" representative explained that \"in the state of French finances and because of the German moratorium set by the Dawes plan, it is impossible for the French Government to settle outstanding reparations bills—mostly for small amounts—in cash, and the only way open is to increase acceptance of German products, which as reparations will enter the country duty free.\" The Premier was quoted directly as having said that \"it is not our fault that during this year the country will have to meet enormous bills. But whoever is to blame and whatever the consequences of our decision this Government is formally determined there shall be no inflation. However desperate may be the measures we may be forced to take, and even should personal interest be shaken, there will be no inflation. It is only in that way we can do our duty toward the future as did those who in the war gave up their lives for it.\" The \"Times\" correspondent declared that \"the Premier's statement was received with enthusiasm on all sides of the house. Marcelle, a Deputy of the Right Centre, expressed the approval of his party at the Government's decision. 'However great the personal sacrifice which may be involved,' he said, 'and however harsh the consequences for many, the Opposition heartily associates itself with the courageous words of the Premier.' Finance Minister Clementel, supporting his Chief, added: 'It would be a crime to have recourse now to the printing press. The only way by which we can pull ourselves free from the present situation is by economy and sincerity.'\" The new German Cabinet that was formed by Dr. Hans Luther did not make an auspicious start. It was to have been formally presented to the Reichstag on Jan.16, but for several reasons this ceremony had to be postponed until Jan. 19. One reason was that on the former date there were four vacancies yet to be filled. The most important portfolio of the four was that of Finance Minister. The other reason was said to have been a lack of harmony among those already chosen. In a cablegram dated Jan. 16 the Berlin representative of the New York \"Herald Tribune\" said that \"bitter quarrels and recriminations between the Nationalists and Moderates in the new Luther Ministry at its very first meeting this morning forced the Chancellor to announce the post- 369 ponement of the inauguration of the Cabinet, scheduled for to-night, until Monday. This quarrel created a bad impression in political circles, where it is interpreted as foreshadowing an early demise of the makeshift Ministry. In addition, Luther has still four important portfolios to fill because his original nominees declined to serve at the last moment. People are now asking how soon the rest of the Cabinet will hand in their resignations. Luther himself is reported to have said despondently: 'I wish I could chuck all this and buy a ticket to Italy.'\" Continuing to outline the situation, the \"Herald Tribune\" correspondent said: \"The dispute within the Cabinet was not confined to one subject, but the fiercest struggle raged over the Cologne evacuation. Luther and Foreign Minister Stresemann urged that the Government declaration to the Reichstag on the issue should treat it delicately, with the object of settling it by amicable negotiations with the Allies. But this did not suit the Nationalists, who demanded that a strong gesture of defiance against the Allies should back the German demand for immediate evacuation of the Cologne zone. Another difference between the contending wings in the Cabinet developed over the use of the word 'Republic' in the Ministerial declaration. The Nationalists insisted that the 'horrid' word be dropped and 'Reich' substituted. The Nationalist Ministers even predicted that the members of their party in the Reichstag would vote against the Government if the hated word were included in the inaugural message. Disagreements also cropped up on the revaluation of the war loans and savings bank deposits. The Nationalists, whose ranks largely consist of persons who formerly lived on invested funds, which were lost because of Germany's huge inflation, demand that these sufferers be recompensed by the Government. They also insisted on a passage in the speech which, in Luther's opinion, would be interpreted abroad as directed against the Dawes plan.\" Finally, on Jan. 19, Dr. Luther was able to complete his Cabinet and formally present it to the Reichstag. Dr. Otto von Schlieben, Departmental Chief of the Ministry of Finance, was named Minister of Finance. Men were found also for the other three portfolios. The Associated Press representative in Berlin cabled that \"loyal fulfillment by Germany of the London agreement on the Dawes plan and strict enforcement of the laws dictated by it are among the pledges in the program announced to the Reichstag to-night by the new Government, headed by Dr. Hans Luther as Chancellor.\" It was added in the dispatch that \"Germany, on the other hand, says the pronouncement, expects an equal measure of loyalty from all the signatories to the London agreement.\" The policies of the new Ministry were further outlined as follows: \"The non-evacuation of the Cologne area was declared by the Chancellor to be in violation of the letter and spirit of the London agreement, and the new Government, therefore, was in full accord with the protest lodged by its predecessor. The new Government proposes negotiations at the earliest date for a settlement of this issue. Dr. Luther declared any attempt to alter the Republican Constitution by force or other illegal methods would be treated as high treason.\" In subsequent cable advices from the German capital attention was called to the fact that \"Chancellor Luther,in submitting the new Government to the Reichstag, made a 370 THE CHRONICLE firm and twice reiterated statement that the Cabinet regarded the Republic as the legal and constitutional form of Government in Germany.\" The New York \"Evening Post\" said that \"the utterances of Dr. Luther aimed to discount charges that the Government, with its preponderance of Monarchist Ministers, would be an instrument of jingo reaction.\" [voL. 120. the Nationalists, People's Party, Economic Union, Bavarian People's Party and most of the Centrists. Against were the Socialists, Communists and a few Centrists,including former Premier Wirth, who thus made good his threat that he would not back the Luther Government. Incidentally, he and a few other recalcitrant Centrists broke the traditional Centrist rule of voting as a compact body, thereby presaging a split in party ranks. Those who abstained from voting were the extremists of the Right (the Ludendorff Party) and the Democrats. A striking point about the vote was that a few Nationalists also abstained from voting, deeming the Luther Government, despite its Rightward tendency, not sufficiently a Government of the Right to command their allegiance.\" It was added that \"political interest is now concentrated on the vote in the Prussian Legislature to-morrow, when it will be decided whether the Rightward parties get control there or the Leftward coalition maintains its ascendancy.\" It has been apparent from the start that, in all probability, the Luther Ministry would experience greater difficulty than any of its predecessors in maintaining its position and existence. According to all accounts there was a stormy session in the Reichstag on Jan. 20. Some idea of what occurred may be had from the following excerpts from a special Berlin dispatch to the New York \"Times\" Tuesday evening: \"Insults flew back and forth in the Reichstag to-day when the big debate began on yesterday's declaration by Chancellor Luther of his Governmental policy.

The Associated Press representative in Rome cabled that evening that \"thus the Fascist Government of Premier Mussolini apparently has weathered another gale.\" Continuing, he said that \"the peaceable adjournment of the Chamber, coming without the breaking of the expected storm, caused discomfiture mostly to the dozens of foreign correspondents who had rushed to Italy a few days ago to be on hand to describe the wreckage of the Mussolini regime. The impending disaster had been advertised widely for more than a month by the would-be politically weather-wise, who thought that they saw on the horizon the signs of a break-up.\" A general election in Italy may be held next November. This opinion is said to have been expressed in political circles in Rome. The New York \"Herald Tribune\" correspondent at that centre cabled that \"Mussolini himself would prefer to postpone his appeal to the country until a year from this spring, it is understood.\" He added that \"the date of the elections, however, depends largely upon the progress made in the trial of those accused of the murder of 3fatteotti, which, in turn, depends on the pressure brought by the Opposition, who wish the trial conducted under some other regime than that of the Fascist.\" It became known in Washington on Jan. 18 that \"James de Martino will succeed Prince Caetani as Italian Ambassador to Washington when the latter retires early in February.

A further gain in gold of £2,240 was announced by the Bank of England in its statement for the week ending Jan. 21, while reserve expanded £1,292,000 as a result of continued contraction in note circulation, which has been reduced to £124,844,000, a decline for the week of £1,290,000. At this time a year ago outstanding note circulation totaled £125,143,180 and a year earlier £129,798,570. The proportion of reserve to liabilities was again advanced, this time to 18.07%, which compares with 17.13% last week and 15.05% for the week of Jan. 7. Important changes were shown in the deposit items, public deposits being increased £11,264,000, while \"other\" deposits decreased £10,859,000. The bank's loans on Government securities were reduced £1,766,000, but on \"other\" securities there was £893,000 increase. Gold holdings stand at £128,571,640, as against £128,076,077 in 1924 and £127,489,154 a year earlier. Reserve aggregates £22,779,000, in comparison with £22,682,897 last year and £25,140,584 in 1925, and loans £75,279,000, as contrasted with £71,471,923 and £65,238,047 one and two years ago, respectively. Clearings through the London banks for the week were £813,027,000, against £852,730,000 a week ago and £752,147,000 last year. The minimum discount rate of the bank remains at 4%, unchanged.

This is the fourth successive week in which reductions have been registered in that item and as a result the total outstanding has been cut down to 40,039,444,000 francs. 372 THE CHRONICLE Last year at this time, however, the total of notes in circulation was only 38,329,145,200 francs and atithelcorresponch g datelin11923,Ibut136,780,408,080 francs. On July 30 1914, just prior to the outbreak of war, the amount was no more than 6,683,184,785 francs. The gold item continues to show small gains, the increase for the week being 153,475 francs. The Bank's aggregate gold holdings, therefore, now stand at 5,545,485,850 francs, comparing with 5,540,836,840 francs at the corresponding date last year and with 5,535,298,199 francs the year previous; of the foregoing amounts, 1,864,320,907 francs were held abroad in both 1925 and 1924 and 1,864,344,927 francs in 1923. During the week silver increased 293,900 francs and Treasury deposits rose 923,000 francs. Bills discounted, on the other hand, registered a contraction of 457,018,000 francs, advances fell off 407,000 francs and general deposits were reduced 20,947,000 francs. Comparisons of the various items in this week's return with the statement of last week and corresponding dates in both 1924 and 1923 are as follows: [VoL. 120 were reduced $39,000,000. At New York the loss in gold amounted to $23,200,000. Rediscounting operations in all classes of paper declined approximately $48,000,000. Open market purchases were reduced $9,500,000. Here, also, large declines were shown in earning assets and deposits—$80,300,000 and $97,600,000, respectively. The amount of Federal Reserve notes in circulation decreased $8,000,000. Member bank reserve accounts were likewise heavily curtailed. From the banks as a group the decline was reported as $116,000,000 and at New York $101,500,000. As the shrinkage in deposits'was more than enough to offset losses in gold reserves, the ratio of reserve advanced both locally and nationally. For the New York bank there was a gain of 4.9%, to 81.8%,and for the System as a whole 2.8%,to 78.8%. Last Saturday's New York Clearing House banks and trust companeis report, registered some striking changes, chief among them being an increase in surplus of more than $93,000,000, thereby indicating that the banks have fully recovered from the year-end BANK OF FRANCE'S COMPARATIVE STATEMENT. • strain.

No change was noted on either Wednesday or Thursday, so that loans again renewed at 3%,which was also the high, with 2% the low. There was no range on Friday, 3% being the only rate quoted and still the basis for renewals. Loanable funds were in ample supply and it was claimed that as low as 2% was bid in the outside market. In time money the trend was slightly easier, owing mainly to the highly favorable statement issued by the Clearing House institutions last week. Dulness prevailed and fixed-date funds were on offer with few takers even at concessions. No important trades were recorded in any maturity. ninety days at Sixty day money ruled at 3 4% 8 % and four and five months at 33 3%@34 unchanged; six months declined to 3%%, as against 33 4%@ 4% last week. Commercial paper was in good demand. Highgrade names were quickly absorbed by out-of-town institutions and brokers are now predicting a general broadening tendency. Rates were not changed from 3M@3Yi% for four to six months' names of choice character, though the bulk of the business was done at the inside figure. Names not so well known still require 3%@4%,the same as heretofore. New England mill paper and the shorter choice names continue to be dealt in at 33\"2%. Banks' and bankers' acceptances were active and both local and country banks were in the market as buyers for liberal amounts. The demand was usually in excess of the supply. A firm undertone prevailed with quotations unchanged. For call loans against bankers' acceptances the posted rate of the American Acceptance Council has been lowered to 2/%, 1 against 3% a week ago.

Sterling exchange movements during the early part of the week were narrow and perfunctory, with the aggregate turnover smaller than for quite some time. Price movements in keeping with this showed no decisive trend and were lacking in significance. Nearly all of the more important operators appeared to be out of the market and had it not been for occasional sporadic attempts to sell on the part of speculative interests, trading would have been at a virtual standstill. On Thursday, however, heavy buying was resumed and the result was to send demand bills up to a new high level of 4 803.. No specific reason was assigned to the sudden spurt of strength and aciivity. In some quarters it was attributed to the. marked resiliency displayed by sterling price levels of late, which have remained stable in the face of repeated and concerted selling pressure, giving rise to the belief that sterling exchange is not likely to go much lower; hence the rush to buy sterling from a number of sources. Bankers and brokers, also commercial concerns, were among the buyers, and large amounts are said to have changed hands. Prior to the buying movement the market was largely a professional affair. So far as actual values were concerned, London took the lead and prices were controlled almost wholly by the cabled rates emanating from that centre. At the opening demand bills moved up to 4 783.(; latter on here was a recession to 4 77 3-16 on freer offerings of commercial bills, desultory attempts at profit taking and a general lack of buying interest, which wa8 subsequently followed by a diminution in the supply of bills offering and stiffening in cable rates from London, all of which contributed at least in some degree to the advance, which, at the close of the week, carried demand up to 4 80%. Notwithstanding the explanations proffered, the resumption of buying was regarded as somewhat of a surprise, for the reason that the general disposition in local financial circles for the past week or more has been to proceed with caution in the absence of any definite announcement by Great Britain regarding its intentions in the matter of a resumption of gold SPOT DELIVERY. payments.

The following is the schedule of facts.. A factor which may have had something 374 THE CHRONICLE to do with the rise was the action of the Post Office in advancing its sterling money order rate to 4 87, which in many quarters is likely to be taken as a certain indication that sterling will very shortly return to par. Whether the upward movement will be sustained, and just what course sterling is likely to take are sure to be subjects of keen interest in financial circles for the next few weeks. Referring to quotations in greater detail, sterling exchange on Saturday last was easier and demand bills receded to 4 77@4 77 3-16, cable transfers to 4 77h@4 77 7-16 and sixty days to 4 7432@ 4 74 11-16; trading was moderately active.

Italian lire continued to attract attention by reason of its wide fluctuations. At the opening there was a recovery from the low point of 4.01 last week to 4.18, though the improvement was not sustained, and it was not long before lire prices began to sag until the quotation had toppled back to 4.07. An undercurrent of pessimism regard- [vor.. 120. ing the future of lire appeared to persist, so that not even the strong Government support put forth was able to prevent sharp fluctuations. On Thursday, in common with other exchanges, an advance to 4.14 was noted. In the early dealings speculative activity was held responsible for the weakness. Several Italian banks which bought heavily on the recent break were repeated to be taking profits. Feeling in Italy against what is termed an \"international campaign to depreciate the lire\" is said to be running high and efforts are being made to show that economic and financial conditions in Italy do not warrant so extensive a decline in values. French francs fluctuated nervously for a while, though losses were confined to a few points and the range was, 5.383/i to 5.423'. Very little interest was shown, since dealers appeared to tale the view that France's financial position does not warrant materially higher values to the franc. Concurrently with the rise in sterling, however, better buying developed and there was a recovery to 5.433/2. A feature of some interest was that Belgian francs scored a sustained rise in place of moving in sympathy with French exchange, and after opening at 5.003-' advanced steadily until 5.163/ was reached, thus narrowing the spread between the two currencies to about 27 points. No definite information was available as to the reason for the buying that was responsible for the rise, but it was generally believed that it was partly speculative, based on the ground that the Belgian loan recently floated should have an important effect in bringing about stabilization of Belgian exchange, and partly the results of actual governmental operations designed to bring Antwerp francs more closely in line with French exchange. The feeling has prevailed for a long time that the Belgian franc is intrinsically worth fully as much as the French franc, perhaps more, since Belgium's credit is, if anything, better than France's, while her internal finances are far more stable. It is expected that just as soon as sterling is established at par steps will be taken by both the French and Belgian Governments to place their currencies upon a more favorable basis. At the close a reaction set in and some of the gains were lost as a result of fears aroused by the speech of M. Mann on France's war debts. The minor European currencies ruled dull and without important changes. German marks declined 1 point to 23.80. Austrian kronen showed no change at all.

The Paris Agreement and American Foreign Policy. Washington correspondents appear to have been agreed that the purpose of the resolution introduced in the Senate on Jan. 17 by Senator Hiram Johnson, and adopted in modified form, without debate or division, on Jan. 21, calling upon the Secretary of State for a copy of the agreement recently concluded at Paris, \"together with such other information respecting the circumstances surrounding the negotiation and execution of the agreement as may be relevant to a full understanding of its terms,\" is quite as much to open the way for a general discussion of the Administration's foreign policy as it is to obtain light on the agreement which Ambassador Kellogg and his associates concluded. Mr. Johnson has long been one of the conspicuous representatives of the \"irreconcilable\" group in the Senate, which, in addition to opposing anything that could be construed as an official participation of the United States in any European matters arising out of the World War, hay e not hesitated to obstruct both the Harding and Coolidge Administrations,in important matters/4g domestic policy. There were mutterings of discontent at the unofficial participation of the United States in the London Conference, which put • the Dawes plan in 'operation, but•as, Congress was not 376 T Fr DI CHRONICLE then in session the issue could not be formally raised. The Paris agreement offers a better opportunity for political maneuvering, and it is as a political device for \"smoking out\" the President and putting him on the defensive that the resolution, apparently, has been brought forward. Precisely what, as far as can now be seen, is the maneuver worth,either as politics or as'statesmanship? The only force which such a resolution can have, aside from the desire on the part of the Senate to know the facts and to place them before the public, is the implication which it carries that something has been done that ought not to have been done, or that something is concealed which, if fully known, would make a bad impression. Any such challenging of motives1 whether of individuals or of Governments, is always to be regretted, and is rarely to be justified except where a long record of questionable conduct makes suspicion inevitable. It would be idle to urge that Mr. Coolidge, in his conduct of the foreign relations of the United States, has shown any disposition to barter away American rights, or to involve the United States in foreign entanglements from which a well-nigh unanimous public opinion desires that the country shall be kept free. What Senator Johnson and his \"irreconcilable\" associates apparently suspect,however,is that the United States, by entering into an agreement with Great Britain, France, Belgium and Italy to receive, in payment of the costs of the American Army of Occupation and the awards of the Mixed Claims Commission, a certain percentage of the German reparations payments provided for by the Dawes plan, has thereby assumed reOponsibility, jointly, with the other Powers, for the execution of the Dawes plan, and has become to that extent a party to the enforcement of the reparations settlement. It is to be regretted that the remarks attributed to some of the European statesmen who took part in the Paris conference should have contributed to confirm this impression, and that the disclaimers that have been brought forward in the attempt to show that what was said had been misinterpreted should have come only after the mischief had been done. If anything were needed to allay the suspicions of Senator Johnson and his followers, it would seem to have been afforded by the statement made public by Mr. Hughes, with the approval of the President on Jan. 19, two days after the Johnson resolution was introduced, and by an examination of the text of so much of the Paris agreement as relates to the American claims. Neither legally nor morally, Mr.Hughes declared, did the Paris agreement impose upon the United States any obligation. \"The agreement reached at Paris was simply for the allocation of the payments made under the Dawes plan. It does not provide for sanctions or deal with any questions that might arise if the contemplated payment should not be made.\" A careful reading of the American portion of the agreement, as printed in the New York \"Times\" of Jan. 14, appears fully to sustain Mr. Hughes's explanation. If the impression has gone abroad, either in this country or in Europe, that the United States, by joining officially in the Paris agreement, has thereby become in some way a guarantor of the execution of the Dawes plan, or that it is henceforth to be counted upon to join in the imposition of sanctions upon Germany in case reparations payments fail, the responsibility for such an error would seem to rest in the first instance upon [VoL. 120. those who, on both sides of the Atlantic, acclaim every effort of the United States to assert its rights to reimbursement of the expenses which the World War and the peace settlement involved as an official recognition of political partnership with European Governments, and, in the second place, upon those who in this country appear ready to seize upon Amer. ican foreign relations as an occasion for political hectoring of the Administration. The late Democratic candidate for the Presidency, Mr. Davis,in one of his campaign speeches, aroused a momentary enthusiasm among his supporters by declaring that, the country was entitled to know, whether the Administration had a foreign policy, and, if it had, what the policy was. The implication was that Mr. Coolidge either declined to make clear his policy in foreign relations, or else that he had no policy at all. There was no sufficient justification for the inquiry at the time, and there is even less now. Whatever differences of opinion may obtain regarding the wisdom of Mr. Coolidge's course in foreign affairs, it cannot be said that he has failed to make the essentials of his policy clear. The statements of his speech of acceptance, of his annual message to Congress, and of his public addresses offer, indeed, a singularly lucid expression of his opinions and purposes. He is opposed to any official participation of the United States in the reparations settlement, or in any other settlement through which the United States may become involved in the enforcement of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, but he is anxious that the Dawes plan shall succeed, and he has sanctioned unofficial American participation in a conference which arranged to put the plan in operation. He does not intend that the United States shall be deprived, by reason of the inclusive nature of the reparations payments contemplated by the Dawes plan, of an opportunity to recover from Germany the amounts due on account of the Army of Occupation or the Mixed Claims Commission, and he has insisted that those obligations shall be met out of the payments made under the Dawes plan, but he will claim only the stipulated share of what the Dawes plan produces, without sharing in the enforcement of the plan. He is opposed to American membership in the League of Nations, and early made clear his opposition to the Geneva protocol, but he desires to maintain friendly relations with the League, and favors adherence to the World Court if entanglement with the League can be avoided. He has refused to permit the agreement of the Washington Conference to be circumvented by further elevation of naval guns, and he stands ready to call, or to participate in, another disarmament conference whenever the attitude of European Governments holds out hope that such a conference would be a success. He has declared, in conformity with the overwhelming sentiment of the country, that the war debts ought not to be cancelled or pooled so far as American claims are concerned, and has let it be known that while each case will be dealt with separately, any definite proposal by any Government for settlement will be accorded full and careful consideration. Such, in substance, is Mr. Coolidge's position on the only issues of importance that now affect American relations with Europe. It is unlikely that he will yield to the covert pressure of the Johnson resolution and state his policy over again, and he could hardly make its elements clearer if he did. Unless, JAN. 24 1925.] THE CHRONICLE then, the records of the Paris conference, when they shall be made available show some plain departure from the policy which has thus far been followed (a contingency, we think, quite outside the range of probability), it is much to be hoped that the Senate, when it comes to debate the matter, will not allow the foreign policy of the Administration to be made the football of factional politics or personal feeling, but will keep the discussion on the high level of states- 377 manship which the importance of the subject deserves. It is the'undoubted tight Of the Senate to call for papers and inforinatien, to.debate the questions that constitutionally belong to it; and to dissent from the view of the ExeCutive if its own opinion be reasoned and matured, but unless the gronnds of dissent be grave, the country is likely to be better served if the Senate co-operates rather than if it obstructs. The 1924 Record of New Building Construction Building activity in the United States during the calendar year 1924, as represented by the plans filed and permits issued for the'erection of new structures and for building work generally, was maintained at the highest level ever reached in the country's history. In money value'the total runs well above that for the calendar year 1923, and that was'so far above the best previous record that it cannot be said to have been even closely approached before. Stated in brief, the projects filed provided for construction work having an estimated cost value of $3,547,251,571, as against $3,391,904,103, the estimated cost of the building construction planned in the calendar year 1923, $2,764,076,576 'the estimated cost in 1922, $1,869,327,011 in 1921,$1,608,035,684 in 1920,$1,492,946,621 for 1919 and $502,941,235 for 1918, when the country was still engaged in the war with Germany and when as a consequence all construction work had to be held in abeyance except so far as it was essential for the conduct of the war. This record of building activity presents some decidedly encouraging features. There is, in the first place, the uninterrupted growth, through good times and bad times alike, year after year, starting from the low level reached in 1918. It was taken for granted as a matter of course in the early part of this six years of phenomenal expansion in construction activity that it represented work undertaken to make good the shortage in the erection of new buildings which occurred in 1917 and 1918, when construction work was so rigidly held down to the necessities of the war. There was, of course, great force to the contention. But, as construction activity kept steadily expanding, and rising to higher and still higher totals, it became apparent that something more than the mere shortage occasioned during the war was needed for a full explanation and that in some respects at least the country had to deal with an entirely new situation in that regard. There is much in the experience of the last few years to lend plausibility to the idea that new building work is to be permanently on a much higher level than in the period immediately preceding the war, when it was considered that building activity was in a flourishing state when the outlays involved in the building projects ran in excess of 1,000 million dollars a year. That would follow, presumably, in any event, considering the growth in population in the interval, but in addition there have been special stimulating influences which can hardly be said as yet to have lost any of their potency. Among these may be mentioned the drift of population to the larger cities and away from the farm. This drift received a new impetus by the events connected with the war. We dwelt upon that feature at length in our analysis of the building statistics for 1921 and emphasized its importance in dealing with the still greater expan- sion in construction work during 1923, and it is obviously a consideration that cannot be lightly dismissed now that our tabulations for a year later show no signs of abatement in the great activity recorded. It seems proper, therefore, to repeat what we have previously so strongly urged, namely that while the country was engaged in active hostilities 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 young men were sent to the military training camps, a large portion of them coming from the country districts and the bulk of the whole coming from these country districts and the small towns combined, where the atmosphere is distinctly rural. In this way they were given a taste of city life, with its pleasures and excitements, and now that there are so many of them getting married they show a marked inclination to settle down in the larger cities, the work of the farm looking unattractive and even irksome to them. The trend away from the farms was strong before, and now the lure has become greatly intensified. Obviously to the extent that the flow of population has been increased thereby, the demand for new buildings from year to year would be correspondingly increased. As one studies these building statistics, one becomes impressed anew with the magnitude and size of the United States. Covering such a wide stretch of territory, local conditions are minimized and a falling off or setback, in one section or group of States, is overcome by growth in other parts. This suggests the inquiry whether we may not consider the building industry as having become more or less stabilized, after its great growth of the last few years—not stabilized at the extremely high levels of 1923 and 1924, but on some basis moderately below such exceptional figures. In this, of course, we refer to the country as a whole and not to any separate locality or geographical division. In these separate localities new building work may vary widely and sharply, but by reason of the size of the country such variations in one part are apt, as already indicated, to be neutralized by variations in the opposite direction in other parts. The experience of 1924 furnishes a capital illustration of what is likely to happen in that respect. We have already noted that the aggregate of new construction work planned in 1924 exceeded the aggregate of what was planned in 1923, but it by no means follows that this is true of all the separate localities or even of the different grand divisions of the country. As a matter of fact, there was a considerable shifting of construction activity during 1924, with some sharp falling off in the volume of new work planned at certain points, but which was more than counterbalanced by greater scale construction in places and in sections which previously had been much less active in their forward planning. And that is likely to be true nearly always, except when the whole country is subject to a common Cu 378 THE CHRONICLE dition such as happened during the war, or when there is business prostration of a wholly overwhelm.lug character. Since the close of the war the building industry has been apparently impervious to the effects of business depression, even of an extreme type, but this followed from special circumstances and conditions and it would not be wise to count upon similar immunity in the event of general trade reverses in the future. During the prodigious collapse which came with such startling suddenness towards the close of 1920, at the termination of the war period of inflation, and which continued through the greater part of 1921, building activity cannot be said to have been wholly unaffected, and yet the 1921 total of new work planned, as we have already seen, ran larger than that of 1920. But there was then still an unquestionable shortage of buildings for the needs of the population and for the requirements of business. The new building work in 1921 involved an aggregate of $1,869,327,011, as noted above, against an aggregate of $1,608,035,684 for 1920. But the fact that building work for the country as a whole (though not for separate sections) remained uninterrupted was itself the strongest factor in the notable recovery in general trade and industry which occurred in 1922. This trade revival in turn further stimulated building activity and, as showing the way construction activity was bound to expand when the incubus of trade prostration was removed, the building projects of 1922 reached an aggregate of $2,764,076,576, against $1,869,327,011 for 1921, and in 1923, with general trade continuing to prosper, the total of building work planned rose still higher, to $3,391,904,103. In 1924 it would have been logical to have looked for some falling off in the total, instead of a moderate further increase to $3,547,251,571, which is the actual result, according to the elaborate compilations we present at the end of this article. Again, we had a sudden and very great slump in business, though it was fortunately of much shorter duration. It came at the close of March and reached its acute stage in July, and was due to grave political apprehensions arising out of the happenings in Congress and the projection of a radical Third Party movement into the Presidential campaign under the leadership of Senator La Follette. We shall not go into a discussion of this matter here, or repeat again all the various statistics we cited last week in our article reviewing the Bank Clearings for 1924 to impress the reader with the extent of the great slump in business that occurred. For the present occasion it will suffice to say on this point that the iron and steel industry showed the most striking manifestation of the collapse in trade and that iron production in the United States which in March had been 3,466,086 tons dropped to only 1,784,899 tons the following July. Then recovery came—very slow at first, but with growing energy after Nov.4, when the Presidential election revealed the utter rout of the radical Third Party movement. As already said, it would have been logical to have found a falling off in the grand aggregate of building work planned in 1924, and evidences of the effects of the slump in trade are not lacking in the building statistics, as will appear as we proceed in our analysis. The circumstance that during nearly the whole of the first half of the year the plight of the farmers occasioned by the low level of agricultural prices remained unrelieved (the great rise in values which [VoL. 120. completely transformed the position and outlook of the Western agricultural classes not coming until the last half of 1924) might also have been expected to repress building activity, as it actually did at certain points, but, as on previous occasions, further growth elsewhere, and particularly in the Greater New York, served to offset these losses and to raise the grand total for the whole country to a still higher level than for 1923. At New York financial considerations are often of greater importance than anything else in promoting building activity and during 1924 these financial considerations were in the highest degree favorable. It is to be remembered, too, that the money needed for a certain type of new building ventures is being obtained in steadily increasing degree from public offerings of securities instead of from private loans. Formerly, when big structures were to be erected, loans for the work were obtained mainly from the large life insurance companies or other financial institutions of great size. And these loans were often held for years as permanent investments. Now, no inconsiderable amounts are obtained by the offering of bonds to general investors in the usual denominations, secured by mortgage on the property. Where this is not possible in the earlier stages of the work it is entirely feasible after the erection of the buildings, releasing the moneys embraced in the original loans from the moneyed institutions and enabling these institutions to repeat the operation by using the funds in similar loans on other buildings. This applies, of course, to large buildings in other cities, as well as in New York. And no feature of recent financing has been more noteworthy than the way in which offerings of bonds secured by mortgages on buildings have been coming on the market. • Financing of all kinds was, of course, easy during 1924. Credit was abundant—in fact superabundant —and money rates low, with not the slightest sign of tension at any time during the year. The state of the money market is obviously always a factor of the highest importance even in the matter of obtaining small building loans, and small building loans are perhaps in greater demand at this centre by reason of the size of the city's population than elsewhere. The Greater New York has a problem all its own. Population is not only large, but growing very fast. Manhattan Island is only a narrow strip of land and very congested. Therefore, provision for the flow of population has to be made in the outlying sections. In Brooklyn, in the Bronx, and in Queens new building construction is proceeding on an enormous scale. In the older sections of these boroughs apartment houses in great numbers and of large size are replacing private dwellings and the small store, and in the newer sections, the remoter suburbs, vacant lots are rapidly being utilized for the erection of private dwellings—the one-family and the two-family house. And it seems almost impossible to provide enough of these latter. In addition, there are the new school houses, the theatres, the factory and other commercial buildings, etc., etc., the annual outlays for which are in proportion to the size of the city. This will explain why the amounts involved in the building projects in Greater New York still keep rising. The grand aggregate of the outlays planned in the Greater New York in 1924 reached no less than $849,039,703. This compares with $785,557,945 in 1923, with $638,569,809 in 1922,$476,287,194 in 1921, $290,828,942 in 1920 and $261,500,189 in 1919. These fig- 4 JAN. 24 1925.] THE CHRONICLE • ures are interesting not only as showing the magnitude to which building operations have risen in the Greater City, but also in indicating the progressive nature of the growth, as these comparisons make it plain that the increase has been uninterrupted year by year. It is noteworthy, too, that all the different boroughs in the Greater City shared in the yearly extension of building work,except that in 1924 the Borough of Brooklyn did not maintain the extraordinarily high total reached in 1923. Even as it is, the building planned in Brooklyn in 1924 fell only a little short of a quarter of a billion dollars, the exact aggregate being $242,918,892. In 1923, however, the amount had been $284,215,480. The falling off in Brooklyn, though, was made good by the further increase in Manhattan and in the other boroughs. The total for Manhattan Island for 1924 stands at $286,653,202, against $204,032,279 for 1923, being an increase of over 40%, and compares with only $165,195,601 for 1922. The 1924 addition once more puts the building total for Manhattan above that for the Borough of Brooklyn, which at one time in the past was the normal situation, but which during more recent years has not been the case. The size of the Manhattan total is due to the prominence of big buildings, for Manhattan Island is so well built up that there is relatively little room for small structures where new work is undertaken. The increase in 1924 over 1923 in the Greater City is, it will be seen, $63,481,758. For all of the cities embraced in our tabulations the increase is $155,347,468, the grand total for the 281 cities for 1924 having been, as already stated, $3,547,251,571, against $3,391,904,103 for 1923. Thus no small portion of the whole increase has been supplied by the Greater New York. On the other hand, many of the other large cities outside of New York show substantially reduced totals for 1924, as compared with 1923. This is particularly true at Chicago and Los Angeles, which in 1923 ranked second and third (the Greater New York, of course, standing first)in the extent of the building work planned. At Chicago the total is $296,893,985 for 1924, against $329,604,312 for 1923, and at Los Angeles $150,247,621, against $200,133,181. The falling off at Chicago, however, is more nominal than real. Building Commissioner Frank E. Doherty in a report to Mayor William E. Dever of Chicago notes that the falling off occurred in April and "
