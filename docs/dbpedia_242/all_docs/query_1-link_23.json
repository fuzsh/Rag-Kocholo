        "text": "The staff was very friendly and helpful. Their market on site was the best price for bottled water that we found in the area and we loved the spacious rooms. This property is more like a home than a hotel and that made our stay so much more comfortable. We had one of the first floor rooms that had it's own back patio and we had banana and coconut trees and flowers out there that really added to the tranquil experience. We had a nice living room, full kitchen and spacious bedroom. It was not a newly updated space but it was very clean and the price was good for the Bahamas.It was our first visit to the Bahamas and the excellent and caring staff made our time there memorable. We can't wait to go back.\n\nRead more\n\nRead less\n\nOk, bear with me, I really like to focus on the positive things when we stay at hotels and not dwell on little things, because nothing is perfect right? But this time I could not get past the many unfavorable things about this hotel and just want to give people a fair warning before booking.\n\nWe knew it wasn't going to be the nicest place to stay, but we were extending a few days after staying at Atlantis and wanted somewhere cheaper and quieter. Their online website looked really fairly decent.... well it was misleading which is so frustrating. We had two rooms and paid $1,200.00 for three nights. We should have stayed put at the Atlantis. This place is old, very very grungy and very, very outdated. It wasn't wasn't clean and the staff was mostly rude. We called to get an extra blanket for my daughters fold out bed ( which smelled like urine) and they said they didn't have one extra blanket we could use! What?! What kind of hotel doesn't have one extra blanket?! They always gave us 2 bath towels a day after asking for 3 every single time. I asked for an extra beach towel and they told me that I was to use what we had in our room because they didn't have extras. Horrible toiletries, no dish soap or extra garbage bags, and the kitchen was so gross. Dirty dishes put back and it was not well stocked with utensils. The pools are small, with things floating in them, and the lounge chairs are old and weathered.\n\nWe wanted to use the laundry facilities and need 2 dollars in quarters and went to the office to get them and the lady said they had no quarters to exchange. By this time I was wondering if I was on a hidden camera prank show because I have never experienced anything like this when traveling and staying at a hotel. And we travel all over the world! From our experience, no one working there was friendly and accommodating. Except for one man that was in the office working the first day we were there.\n\nWe got a taxi to take us to get dinner because this place isn't too close to anything. (20 min walk to Atlantis) and our taxi driver did a drug deal right in front of us at a stop sign by the hotel. ðŸ˜¬We had our 3 kids with us. Sketchy place on paradise island.\n\nSo to make a long story short, pay the extra money to stay at Atlantis if you can, or even a hotel affiliated with the Atlantis because you will have a great experience! Do not stay at this hotel!!!\n\nRead more\n\nRead less"
