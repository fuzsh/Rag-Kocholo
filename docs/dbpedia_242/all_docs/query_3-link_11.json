        "text": "MOOSE JAW - A GoFundMe campaign has been launched to support a Craik-area farmer who is facing significant legal fees and a week-long trial after being accused of mistreating his animals.\n\nThomas (Tom) Miller has been a cattle producer for more than 40 years and owns over 30 cattle on a quarter-section of land, according to the GoFundMe page. He is facing a trial in Moose Jaw Provincial Court from Aug. 12 to 16.\n\nThe provincial Crown has charged the cattleman with breaching sections 4 and 23 of The Animal Protection Act and with breaching section 445(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. Section 4 prohibits people from causing animals to be in distress; section 23 accuses people of failing to comply with a protection order; and section 445(1)(a) accuses people of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.\n\nAnimal Protection Services of Saskatchewan declined to comment on this story, saying the matter would soon be in court.\n\nThe Express was also unable to reach Miller by press time.\n\nThe accusations stem from May 24, 2023, when APSS descended on Miller’s farm to seize his cattle after alleging that he was mistreating them, explained Corey Kuemper, a friend of Miller.\n\n“My friend is a good caregiver for the animals. He loves animals. Him and his … girlfriend, they go out and quite often buy bananas when they’re overripe because they’re cheap and the cows love them,” he said. “So they hand-feed these cows (the bananas).”\n\nMiller’s legal fees are expected to be $63,000, which, combined with the other financial bills, means this situation has cost the man $98,000, says Kuemper. This, he says, prompted the producer’s girlfriend to start the GoFundMe page “Fight an unjust seizure of cattle” and Kuemper to start the Facebook page “Cattleman fighting injustice.”\n\nKuemper added that cattle farmers should monitor this court case closely, as it is important for the industry on the Prairies."
