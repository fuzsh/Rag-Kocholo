        "text": "Across Australian criminal jurisdictions, the most frequent method of case finalisation is not a contested trial, but through the accused entering a plea of guilty. Within this context, negotiated guilty pleas have taken on a more prominent and significant role in the delivery of modern day ‘justice’. This report provides an empirical account of current plea negotiation practices in the state of Victoria, including documenting the frequency of plea negotiations, identifying the different forms of plea negotiation and common resolution outcomes, and discussing the processes involved in reaching an agreement. The study involved the development of a dataset of negotiated guilty pleas through a comprehensive mixed qualitative and quantitative analysis of Victoria Legal Aid (VLA) de-identified case files that had resolved by guilty pleas; conducting 48 qualitative, in-depth interviews with police prosecutors, Office of Public Prosecutions (OPP) solicitors, Crown prosecutors, defence practitioners (VLA employees and those in private practice) and judicial officers; as well as carrying out consultations with key legal stakeholders.\n\nRobson Crim has developed as a hub for national Crim research and now accepts many more submissions than we can accommodate. Further, we have recently tapped into the CanLII Connects system and are excited by the drive towards open access in legal scholarship and authorship. We have made connections with Emond Publishing who have graciously provided editorial assistance to us in these two latest volumes. Our commitment to open access publication, as well as our presence on the usual legal databases and Academia.edu contributes to making our resources easy to access. As part of our commitment to advancing legal research and disseminating knowledge in the fields of criminal law, criminal justice and criminology, we present you, this year, with two additional volumes of the Criminal Law Edition of the Manitoba Law Journal.\n\nAs of November 2017, 60 known foreign terrorist fighters have been permitted to return and live in Canada without criminal consequence. The reason for this, according to the Minister of Public Safety, is the problem of using information collected for intelligence purposes as evidence in criminal proceedings. Often referred to as the “intelligence to evidence” (I2E) dilemma, this challenge has plagued Canada’s terrorism prosecutions since the Air India bombing in 1985. Yet, not all countries struggle to bring terrorists to justice. Canada’s prosecution statistics pale in comparison to the United Kingdom. In a democracy committed to upholding the rule of law and respecting human rights, prosecuting terrorists is the strongest and most transparent deterrent to this threat. This article argues that as the threat of terrorism grows both domestically and abroad, Canada must learn from the UK’s experience and reform the rules of evidence to ensure that criminal charges are pursued. This article will outline and compare the relevant Canadian and UK rules of evidence and assess their practical implications for national security prosecutions in light of primary research conducted in London in the fall of 2017. It concludes with a series of legislative and organizational reforms to improve the efficiency of Canadian terrorism trials.\n\nPutting together a double volume was no small feat. We would like to thank our authors, who submitted highly relevant and thoughtful pieces of legal analysis, touching on fields of criminology, criminal justice and criminal law, amongst others. We would also like to thank our Robson Crim collaborators, and our peer reviewers,6 all of whom helped put this project together for another round. The entire editorial team would like to extend an extra thank you to Rebecca Bromwich, Melanie Murchison, and James Gacek for their help and support, as well as to the Dean of the Faculty of Law, at the University of Manitoba, Dr. Jonathan Black-Branch."
