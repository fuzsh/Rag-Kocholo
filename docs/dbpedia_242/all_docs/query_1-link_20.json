Property will appreciate over time.\n\nBuy a REIT $1.5M worth and get 3% dividend or $45k per year. REITs historically appreciate 10% average per year.\n\nSure I might make an extra $45K per year building the property, but is that worth over REIT? I assume property and REIT will appreciate at the same rate."
