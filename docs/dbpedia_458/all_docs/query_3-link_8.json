        "text": "Timothy McVeigh (born April 23, 1968, Pendleton, New York, U.S.—died June 11, 2001, Terre Haute, Indiana) was an American domestic terrorist who carried out the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995. The explosion, which killed 168 people, was the deadliest terrorist incident on U.S. soil, until the September 11 attacks in 2001.\n\nMcVeigh was the middle child in a blue-collar family in rural New York state, and he expressed an interest in guns from an early age. He graduated from high school in June 1986 and spent a short period at a local business college. Around this time he first read The Turner Diaries (1978), an antigovernment, neo-Nazi tract written by William Pierce. The book, which details the truck-bombing of the Washington, D.C., headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), fueled McVeigh’s paranoia about a government plot to repeal the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees the right “to keep and bear arms.” He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1988 and proved to be a model soldier, earning a Bronze Star for bravery in the Persian Gulf War (1990–91). He was a candidate for the Special Forces but dropped out of the program after only two days. The experience soured him on the military, and he took an early discharge and left the army in late 1991.\n\nMcVeigh returned to New York but was unable to find steady work. He reunited with Terry Nichols and Michael Fortier, friends from his days in the army, and sold guns at fairs throughout the United States. In March 1993 he drove to Waco, Texas, to observe the ongoing FBI siege of the Branch Davidian compound. He viewed the U.S. government’s actions there as illegal, and it was during this time that McVeigh, Nichols, and Fortier made contact with members of militia groups in the Midwest. In September 1994 McVeigh began actively plotting to destroy the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Over the next six months, McVeigh and Nichols planned the bombing and acquired several tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, which, combined with fuel oil, would provide the explosive power for the bomb. On April 19, 1995, the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the Branch Davidian siege, McVeigh parked the truck containing the bomb in front of the Murrah Building."
