        "text": "STEP 1: Fill Out the Security Access Form\n\nTHE GUEST SECURITY ACCESS FORM IS AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD HERE:\n\n3 GUESTS - 4 GUESTS\n\nGUEST SECURITY ACCESS FORM: If you are going to be attending the graduation ceremony, please fill out the security access form (maximum four guests per form; use the three-guest maximum form when there are 11 or more divisions graduating) according to the instructions on the form and return to your recruit by mail. A link to download the form is located at the bottom of this page. Children 2 years of age or younger do not count toward the maximum number of guests and do not need to be listed. All guests 3 years of age and older must be listed on the access list, including military guests (active duty, reserve, retired, or veteran).\n\nONLY YOUR RECRUIT CAN CHANGE THE GRADUATION CEREMONY ACCESS LIST: Your recruit will be able to make changes to the access list. The last opportunity to make changes will be the week before graduation. If there is a change to be made to the access list (such as a name spelled incorrectly, name-swap, etc.) please communicate any changes to your recruit by mail well in advance. RTC staff cannot change these names or release the names of those on the list. Please do not call to verify receipt of security formsâ€” only your recruit can verify that.\n\nSTEP 2: Plan Your Travel Itinerary\n\nHOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS & TRANSPORTATION: The U.S. Navy does not provide accommodations, air or vehicle transportation, or shuttle services. However, the Naval Station Great Lakes Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) Department has teamed up with the local community to assist those attending graduation ceremonies with helpful resources when making travel arrangements. Please refer to the following website https://www.navylifegl.com/rtc for assistance with hotel accommodations, transportation services, area attractions/restaurants, care packages and much more. You may also visit www.NavyLifeGL.com or call 847-688-2020, 316 for further details.\n\nSTEP 3: Pick Up Your Tickets for the Graduation Ceremony\n\n(This is Off-Base)\n\nTICKETING: Everyone who is planning on attending a graduation ceremony must personally obtain a ticket, which will be distributed at the Recruit Family Welcome Center the week of your recruit's graduation. Tickets are free of charge, but you must have valid photo ID to obtain your ticket (driver's license, state ID, military ID, passport; for minors, a student ID, driver's permit, SSN card, birth certificate). Once you receive your ticket do not lose it, as this will be the only ticket you will receive. These tickets are not transferable and are the only means to access the base for attendees.\n\nWELCOME CENTER ADDRESS/GPS - THIS IS AN OFF-BASE LOCATION: Navy Exchange (NEX) Burkey Mall, 2650 Green Bay Road, North Chicago, IL 60088 (Do not use generic terms such as NEX, Recruit Training Command or Naval Station Great Lakes).\n\nRECRUIT FAMILY WELCOME CENTER HOURS:\n\nDay before Graduation: 10:00 AM to 7:30 PM\n\nDay of Graduation: 5:30 AM to 8:30 AM\n\nPlan accordingly so each person can check-in to receive a ticket for the graduation ceremony. If you don't have a ticket, you will not be allowed entry to the base. Tickets will only be issued to guests who the graduating recruit has verified will be attending. Please ensure those who check-in to receive their graduation tickets are the same as those who were listed on security form.\n\nDO NOT GO DIRECTLY TO THE BASE WITHOUT FIRST PICKING UP YOUR TICKET!\n\nSTEP 4: Attending the Graduation Ceremony\n\nARRIVING: Once the gates open to the public, it will take some time to clear security at the gate, so please plan accordingly. Visitors 18+ will be required to present valid photo ID (driver's license, state ID card, passport, military ID card). Minors who can't produce one of the forms of ID listed above must present either a school ID, driver's permit, copy of birth certificate, or Social Security card.\n\nSCHEDULE OF EVENTS:"
