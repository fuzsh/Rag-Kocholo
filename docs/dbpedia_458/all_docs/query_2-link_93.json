        "text": "Description\n\nThe Wild Tote is the very first bag we created, and was the bag that started Born Free Leather. This is a bag that is tough enough to handle anything you throw at it, but classic enough to take out to a fancy dinner. It’s a balance between grit and grace.\n\nThe handles on the Wild Tote are 13oz harness leather, build to last. While a little stiff upon arrival, the straps will soften and hold up to years of use. They are heavily oiled and conditioned by hand. The body of the Wild Tote is made from 4.5 oz oiled veg tan leather.\n\nAll hardware is solid brass, and each bag comes with an internal brass key clasp.\n\nEach hide is oiled by hand, and each bag is conditioned prior to being boxed up and delivered. We make every single bag in our house and not a single aspect of our process is outsourced.\n\nOur bags are made from USA sourced hides from one of the oldest tanneries in the country. This veg tan leather is heavily oiled and will patina with time and use. Due to this, each bag has its own character with fat wrinkles and may not look exactly like the bag pictured.\n\nApproximate Size: 16 1/2″ Top (x) 12 1/2″ Bottom (x) 11 1/2″ Tall (x) 6″ Depth (x) 9 1/2″ Strap Drop"
