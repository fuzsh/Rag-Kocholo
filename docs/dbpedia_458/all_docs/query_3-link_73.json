        "text": "The birth of a baby is a wonderful and very complex process. Many physical and emotional changes occur for both mother and baby.\n\nA baby must make many physical adjustments to life outside the mother's body. Leaving the uterus means that a baby can no longer depend on the mother's blood supply and placenta for important body functions.\n\nBefore birth, the baby depends on functions from the mother. These include breathing, eating, elimination of waste, and immune protection. When a baby leaves the womb, its body systems must change. For example:\n\nThe lungs must breathe air.\n\nThe cardiac and pulmonary circulation changes.\n\nThe digestive system must begin to process food and excrete waste.\n\nThe kidneys must begin working to balance fluids and chemicals in the body and excrete waste.\n\nThe liver and immune systems must begin working on their own.\n\nYour baby's body systems must work together in a new way. In some cases, a baby has trouble making the transition outside the womb. Preterm birth, a difficult birth, or birth defects can make these changes more challenging. But a lot of special care is available to help newborn babies.\n\nWhat is the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)?\n\nNewborn babies who need intensive medical care are often put in a special area of the hospital called the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The NICU has advanced technology and trained healthcare professionals to give special care for the tiniest patients. NICUs may also care areas for babies who are not as sick but do need specialized nursing care. Some hospitals don’t have the staff for a NICU and babies must be moved to another hospital. Babies who need intensive care do better if they are born in a hospital with a NICU than if they are moved after birth.\n\nSome newborn babies will require care in a NICU. Giving birth to a sick or premature baby can be unexpected for any parent. The NICU can be overwhelming. This information is to help you understand why a baby may need to be in the NICU. You will also find out about some of the procedures that may be needed for the care of your baby.\n\nWhich babies need special care?\n\nMost babies admitted to the NICU are preterm (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy), have low birth weight (less than 5.5 pounds), or have a health condition that needs special care. In the U.S., nearly half a million babies are born preterm. Many of these babies also have low birth weights. Twins, triplets, and other multiples often are admitted to the NICU. This is because they tend to be born earlier and smaller than single birth babies. Babies with health conditions such as breathing trouble, heart problems, infections, or birth defects are also cared for in the NICU.\n\nBelow are some factors that can place a baby at high risk and increase the chances of being admitted to the NICU. But each baby must be assessed to see if he or she needs the NICU. High-risk factors include the below.\n\nMaternal factors include:\n\nBeing younger than age 16 or older than age 40\n\nDrug or alcohol use\n\nDiabetes\n\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension)\n\nBleeding\n\nSexually transmitted diseases\n\nMultiple pregnancy (twins, triplets, or more)\n\nToo little or too much amniotic fluid\n\nPremature rupture of membranes (also called the amniotic sac or bag of waters)\n\nDelivery factors include:\n\nChanges in a baby’s organ systems due to lack of oxygen (fetal distress or birth asphyxia)\n\nButtocks delivered first (breech birth) or other abnormal position\n\nThe baby's first stool (meconium) passed during pregnancy into the amniotic fluid\n\nUmbilical cord wrapped around the baby's neck (nuchal cord)\n\nForceps or cesarean delivery\n\nBaby factors include:\n\nBaby born at gestational age of less than 37 weeks or more than 42 weeks\n\nBirth weight less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces (2,500 grams) or over 8 pounds, 13 ounces (4,000 grams)\n\nSmall for gestational age\n\nMedicine or resuscitation in the delivery room\n\nBirth defects\n\nRespiratory distress including rapid breathing, grunting, or stopping breathing (apnea)\n\nInfection such as herpes, group B streptococcus, chlamydia\n\nSeizures\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycemia)\n\nNeed for extra oxygen or monitoring, IV (intravenous) therapy, or medicines\n\nNeed for special treatment or procedures such as a blood transfusion\n\nWho will care for your baby in the NICU?\n\nSome of the specially-trained healthcare providers who may care for your baby include:\n\nNeonatologist. This is a pediatrician with extra training in the care of sick and premature babies. The neonatologist (often called the attending physician) supervises pediatric fellows and residents, nurse practitioners, and nurses who care for babies in the NICU.\n\nNeonatal fellow. This is a pediatrician getting extra training in the care of sick and premature babies. He or she may do procedures and direct your child's care.\n\nPediatric resident. This is a doctor who is getting extra training in the care of children. He or she may do or assist in procedures and help direct your child's care.\n\nNeonatal nurse practitioner. This is a registered nurse with extra training in the care of newborn babies. He or she can do procedures and help direct your child's care.\n\nRespiratory therapist. This is a person with special training in giving respiratory support. This includes managing breathing machines and oxygen.\n\nPhysical, occupational, and speech therapists. These types of therapists make sure a baby is developing well. They also help with care including positioning and soothing methods. Speech therapists help babies learn to eat by mouth.\n\nDietitians. Dietitians ensure the babies are growing well and getting good nutrition. They watch your baby's intake of calories, protein, vitamins, and minerals.\n\nLactation consultants. These are healthcare providers with extra training and certification in helping women and babies breastfeed. They can help with pumping, maintaining milk supply, and starting and continuing breastfeeding.\n\nPharmacists. Pharmacists help in the NICU by assisting the care providers choose the best medicines. They check medicine doses and levels. They keep the team aware of possible side effects and monitoring that may be needed.\n\nSocial workers. Social workers help families cope with many things when a child is ill. They give emotional support. They help families get information from healthcare providers. They support the family with other more basic care needs, too. These can include money problems, transportation, or arranging home healthcare.\n\nHospital chaplain. The hospital chaplain may be a priest, minister, lay pastor, or other religious advisor. The chaplain can give spiritual support and counseling to help families cope with the stress of the NICU.\n\nNICU team members work together with parents to create a plan of care for high-risk newborns. Ask about the NICU's parent support groups and other programs designed to help parents."
