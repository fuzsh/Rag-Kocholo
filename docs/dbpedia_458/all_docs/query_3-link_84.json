        "text": "The expected birth of a foal from a favourite mare can be an exciting but worrying time for many horse owners.\n\nIdeally, help and advice should be sought from your veterinarian or someone experienced in foaling mares, in good time before the event. It is most important to know what is ‘normal’ in terms of both the foaling process and how to expect the foal to behave once born.\n\nKeep your veterinarian’s number nearby in case a problem arises, or if you have concerns or questions.\n\nGestation\n\nThe average gestation of mares is 340 days. However, like people, mares can go into labour earlier than expected. It is very important to know when your mare is due, so you can be ready for the foaling. Foals born more than 10 days early are more vulnerable to disease and infection. They may also lack the development to stand and nurse properly, as a normal foal would without assistance.\n\nThe mare also may have not produced any or enough colostrum (“first milk”) by this stage. Therefore, it is imperative that you seek veterinary advice or assistance, particularly if the mare has been observed to run any milk from her udder prior to foaling. The same also applies to foals that are delivered after their due date.\n\nCaslicks: What are they?\n\nA caslick is a procedure performed by a veterinarian, which involves suturing closed the upper part of the vulva. This is most commonly practiced on mares with undesirable conformation of the genital area. It is believed to prevent manure and air being ‘sucked in’ to the vagina, which may compromise the foal’s healthy development.\n\nIf you purchased your mare in foal,it is a good idea to have a veterinarian check for a caslick. An unopened caslick can be disastrous for a foaling mare, due to the foal tearing through the smaller opening.\n\nEnvironment – a Safe Place to Foal\n\nMares should be foaled where they can be discretely observed and where help can be easily given if problems arise. Mares tend to prefer foaling at night in privacy, and seem to have some control over the timing of their foaling. Being able to observe discretely or from a distance is the best way to make her at ease.\n\nDo I need to move my mare away from other horses?\n\nYour mare can run with other horses for most of her gestation provided that her paddock mates are not nasty. Horses are social, herd animals and depend on others for companionship. You do not want to stress her out by completely isolating her, so keep other reliable mares with her if possible. Ideally for the last month of gestation your mare should be paddocked with the same horses that she will be paddocked with after foaling. This allows the social hierarchy to be established prior to a vulnerable foal being in the mix. Ideally paddock companions will be mares rather than geldings, and young stock other than foals.\n\nWhen your mare starts showing signs of foaling, then her paddock mates should be moved out to allow her bonding time with the new foal, but kept in a paddock next to her to avoid stress.\n\nPaddock:\n\nA grass paddock or large yard is ideal for your mare to foal in – horses have been giving birth on the open ranges for many years, and this is still an acceptable choice.\n\nA good foaling pasture ideally needs to be clean and free from obstacles, as well as have shade and shelter.\n\nThe fencing of this paddock or yard should have a mesh, like chicken wire, around it as young, uncoordinated foals easily ‘slip’ through plain wire or post and rail fencing.\n\nIdeally the foaling paddock will have been spelled for several weeks to reduce worm contamination and to allow a good clean grass cover.\n\nThere should be no dams,as newborn foals have been reported to have drowned.\n\nStabling:\n\nIf stabling your mare for foaling down, the stable needs to be large with good quality deep straw. Shavings are not ideal for foaling, as they stick to birth fluids and get into the foal’s nose and other unwanted places. It is best to remove manure and soiled bedding promptly and disinfect the stable after birthing.\n\nThe Countdown!\n\nMares can provide clues that they will soon give birth – this rings true for many cases, but please remain diligent and expect surprises.\n\nWhy should I check my mare’s udder?\n\nChecking of the udder daily is necessary for the last month of gestation. This is best done by the same person, as it will give a good indication of any changes, and therefore of how close the mare is to foaling. When your mare is due to foal, her udder will become engorged and very tight. Mares will generally start to ‘bag up’ two weeks prior to foaling, but be warned that this is not fool proof as some mares, especially maidens, may bag up much closer to foaling.\n\nMares may produce a wax like se cretion on their teats up to three days prior to foaling. This is called ‘waxing up’ and is a sign that the mare is very close to foaling. When the mare produces wax, she will require many more checks throughout the day and night. Unfortunately, this also is not a fool proof indicator as some mares do not wax up at all.\n\nWhat does it mean if my mare is running milk?\n\nMares will often drip milk, or even a constant stream from their udder close to foaling. Colostrum is a thick, creamy, yellow colour milk compared to the white appearance of normal milk. If the colostrum leaks from the udder prior to the foal being born the foal may not receive sufficient colostrum to provide vital maternal antibodies.\n\nIf the mare is running milk for more than 24 hours and she is not ready to foal,call us for advice immediately, on 6241 8888.\n\nShape of abdomen\n\nObserve the shape of your mare’s belly. First it is very big and round, but the closer she is to foal, the more her belly drops. Some mares even develop some oedema (fluid retention) on their bellies.\n\nShape of vulva\n\nIf your mare allows you, lift her tail once daily to look at her vulva. A normal vulva is not very long and has wrinkles on its sides. Right before foaling everything on her hind end relaxes, including her vulva. It will appear much longer to you and won’t have as many wrinkles on its side.\n\nTail tone\n\nThe hind end will loosen up before foaling. If you lift her tail daily, you will notice she has strong tone in her tail and gives you some resistance. The closer she is to foaling, the less to no resistance you will feel when lifting her tail.\n\nMonitoring the mare’s behavior\n\nThe mare’s behavior will often dramatically change prior to foaling. Your usually sweet mare may become aggressive towards other horses or even people. When foaling is imminent, the mare should be in a clean grassy area, alone and with a mate nearby. If you notice the mare becoming restless, monitor her closely.\n\nThese are all normal indications of a mare getting ready to foal:\n\nTaking herself away from the herd\n\nResting for longer periods lying down\n\nPacing aimlessly back and forth\n\nProfuse sweating even if it’s not warm weather\n\nMilk running out from the udder and wax on teats\n\nIncreased respiration\n\nReturning to the same spot, sometimes lying down\n\nKicking or looking at the abdomen\n\nTail swishing or tail held up\n\nIntensive grazing\n\nSupervision of the mare\n\nWe advise supervising the mare closely during foaling, whilst maintaining enough distance to avoid disturbing the natural foaling process. Ideally mares require checks at least every half hour from when she starts displaying early signs of foaling. Do not be afraid to approach the mare more closely if you have any concerns as to her well – being during foaling – she is unlikely to be disturbed by this and it is vital to make sure the foaling is progressing without problems.\n\nYou should be prepared, have a first aid kit containing scissors, disinfectant, string, dilutediodine and towels on hand. It is also a good idea to have a torch.\n\nRemember to have our number with you when you check your mare – 6241 8888. Do not be afraid to call if you have any concerns day or night – a false alarm is far better than delaying a call for assistance.\n\nSecond Stage Labour\n\nWithin the white membrane, you should now see the appearance of a foot, followed shortly by another foot, and then the nose.\n\nImagining if the mare is standing upright, both feet need to be presented with the bottom of the soles facing the ground and the nose lying on top of the legs, under the mare’s tail.\n\nCall us if:\n\nThe mare is straining but nothing appears.\n\nYou notice the membrane to be red as opposed to white.\n\nYou have seen the appearance of the white membrane, and no foot within 20 minutes.\n\nA foot and no second foot or the nose within 15 minutes.\n\nYou may be looking at a dystocia (malpresentation) situation, and time is of the essence to achieve a healthy outcome for both mare & foal.\n\nWhat you should be seeing during first stage labour, as described (left).\n\nOnce the front feet, head and neck are presented in this manner the foaling should continue to progress. Once the foal’s shoulder has passed, the mare may rest for a few seconds before continuing to push the foal out.\n\nSecond Stage Labour (continued)\n\nNotice the natural passage of the foal towards the mare’s hocks (above).\n\nOnce the foal is out of the mare, manual rupture of the amniotic membrane should be performed if it has not naturally occurred,otherwise the foal will suffocate (right).\n\nApart from this, you should have no other interference with mare or foal, and allow them bonding time.\n\nDo not disturb the mare or attempt to move the foal from behind the mare. The foal will continue to receive blood from the mare via umbilicus for several minutes after birth, until the cord has ruptured.\n\nPremature rupture of the umbilicus will result in blood loss, which can be life threatening. The mare will break the cord when she stands when she is ready. This may take 10 – 20 minutes.\n\nObserve from a distance, ensuring both mare and foal display normal post foaling behaviours.\n\nAbove and right: Allow the mare and foal bonding time.\n\nThe foal needs to be suckling from the mare within 150 minutes.\n\nThe meconium can be difficult to find –you may need to look around the paddock.\n\nApply diluted antiseptic solution to the navel soon after birth, then twice daily for the next few days.\n\nThe IgG test should be done before 24 hours of age.\n\nColostrum and Passive Transfer\n\nA newborn foal is entirely dependent on maternal antibodies absorbed following ingestion of colostrum from the mare in the first few hours of life. This provides the best immune protection for any newborn foal.\n\nFailure of the passive transfer of maternal antibodies (or FPT) can happen if the foal does not drink enough colostrum during the critical first few hours of life, or if the mare has produced colostrum of poor quality. FPT puts the foal at significant risk of infectious diseases, and even death. The success of passive transfer can be monitored by measuring levels of IgG (Immuno gamma globulin) in the blood of the neo natal foal. Detection of FPT is critical, and allows early intervention and treatment if required.\n\nWe strongly recommend that all foals have an IgG test done by a veterinarian before 24 hours of age. This is an inexpensive, non – invasive procedure that is essential to your foal’s wellbeing.\n\nVeterinary Examination\n\nEarly disease detection in both the newborn foal and postpartum mare can be lifesaving. We recommend an assessment of the mare and foal by one of our veterinarians, by 24 hours after birth. The veterinarian will perform a thorough examination of the mare and foal, as well as check the mare’s placenta and conduct an IgG test on the foal.\n\nCall a Veterinarian if . . .\n\nCall us on 6241 8888 if you notice any of the following:\n\nDuring the stages of labour:\n\nThe mare is straining while trying to give birth, but nothing appears.\n\nThe first thing you see coming out of the mare’s vulva is red to dark red as opposed to grey/white.\n\nThe foal’s head and feet are not presented as previously described.\n\nThe foal is not out within half an hour of first appearing.\n\nThe foal is not breathing properly and/or not sitting up within 30 seconds to a minute.\n\nThe mare shows any signs of pain or colic post foaling.\n\nThe foal is not standing within 90 minutes.\n\nThe foal appears to have leg issues that prevent it from standing normally.\n\nThe foal is not drinking from the mare within 150 minutes.\n\nThe placenta has not passed from the mare within three hours.\n\nOnce the foal has stood and is drinking from the mare:\n\nThe foal has not passed any manure within four hours, and/or not urinated within four to five hours.\n\nThe foal becomes listless and/or is no longer suckling several times per hour.\n\nThere is milk running out of the foal’s nose and/or the foal has lots of milk on its face.\n\nThe mare’s udder becomes engorged, indicating that the foal is not suckling adequately.\n\nThere are any signs of swelling or heat in the foal’s legs.\n\nThe foal’s eyelashes appear to be turned inwards, so the eyelashes are rubbing at the eye, which can result in corneal ulcers."
