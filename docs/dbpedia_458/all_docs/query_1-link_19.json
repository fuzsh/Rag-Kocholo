But if there is one thing all Spaniards share, it’s a love of food and drink.” – Jose Andres.\n\nEver wondered what the secret is to having the most enjoyable trip possible? Welcome to my “Be Invisible” series – your ultimate guide for how to not look like a tourist on your next adventure and guaranteed to boost your entire travel experience.\n\nBursting with helpful tips and tricks, I’ve asked locals from particular cities around the world to share their insider knowledge on the best ways travellers can become “invisible” when visiting their city and enjoy it like a local. If you’re ready to challenge travel stereotypes, overcome language barriers and embrace what I like to call invisible tourism, you’ve come to the right place!\n\nThis post contains affiliate links, at no extra cost to you. I may earn a small commission of you click through and make a purchase.\n\nHere’s how to NOT look like a tourist in Madrid, Spain\n\nEven if you’re planning to undertake some of these day trips from Madrid by train, the following tips will still apply to you.\n\nDo make sure to drink beer\n\nEveryone in Madrid drinks beer. Mainly because refreshing and cheap. If you really want to avoid looking like a tourist and fit in with the locals order a small draught local beer or “caña” in Spanish.\n\nIt’s not frowned upon to have a beer for lunch and all cafes and fast food places serve beer. It’s actually cheaper to buy a beer then water or a soft drink in Madrid!\n\nDo eat a big lunch then tapas late at night\n\nIn Madrid there are 6 meals a day and each is just a light snack, except for lunch which is the biggest meal. Traditionally Spanish people have a 2-3 hour siesta lunch break. During siesta families will have a big get-together and often eat 3 courses.\n\nIf you really want to know how to not look like a tourist in Madrid, look out for restaurants offering “menu del dia” at lunchtime to make this your big meal of the day. Then as you get hungry again in the evening stop for some small plates or “tapas”. Don’t expect to get good fresh tapas in Madrid before 8pm and it’s usually served until past midnight.\n\nDon’t go to a night club before 1am\n\nA big night out in Madrid will never begin before midnight and even then, it starts with some pre-drinks at home or a bit of a tapas bar crawl. The night clubs and late-night bars will be empty until 1-2am. If you enter before then, everyone will know for sure that you are a tourist!\n\nDo have a go at jogging in Retiro Park\n\nRetiro Park is the main park in central Madrid. It’s beautifully manicured gardens, boating lake, fountains and buildings attract many tourists. If you want to blend in with the locals rather than hopping in a rowing boat, go for a jog.\n\nThe long, wide pathways are perfect for jogging. It’s the most popular place in the city for locals to exercise and you will even see groups of people boxing or doing circuit training.\n\nDon’t bother wearing flip flops\n\nFlip flops are a huge no-no in Madrid. There is no beach so as far as locals are concerned there is no need to wear plastic flip-flops. Even if you visit one of the city outdoor swimming pools don’t wear them as no footwear is allowed near the pool area.\n\nWomen do wear sandals in the summer, but only on very hot days and nice open toe leather shoes.\n\nDo always wear or carry sunglasses\n\nThe glare from the sun in Madrid can be fierce. So, locals all wear sunglasses, whatever the weather. Even if it’s a cloudy day or raining in the morning pop a pair of sunglasses in your bag in case the weather changes.\n\nEven in the winter people walk around wearing sunglasses and its pretty normal to wear sunglasses indoors too.\n\nDo walk slowly and don’t expect anything to happen on time\n\nOne of my top Madrid travel tips is to remember there is just no need to rush, or Spain in general to be honest. Slow down your walking pace and take a leisurely stroll otherwise you will look like a tourist immediately.\n\nEverything will take longer so just go with the flow. Getting off the metro, getting the attention of your waiter or paying for something in a shop. Trust me, no-one will rush or expect you to rush.\n\nIn the same way, don’t expect any buses or trains to run on time and if you arrange to meet a local they will think nothing of arriving 15-20 mins late.\n\nEditor’s Note: Some readers have pointed out this may not always be the case. As always, I highly suggest to observe your surroundings and adopt the same pace as locals. Please remember to be mindful of not getting in their way as they go about their day.\n\nDo fit your belongings into a small cross-body bag\n\nLike most busy big cities, pick-pockets are lurking around tourist areas. Rather than worry about them too much or avoid any particular areas, do as the locals do and use a small cross-body hand bag.\n\nMake sure that the zip is always closed and the bag hangs in front of you. Every local woman in Madrid will wear a bag that way and men too, unless they have a backpack.\n\nDo seek out the shade in the summer months\n\nWhen Madrid reaches peak summer heat it will be around 38°C. Only tourists try to enjoy this kind of heat and bask in the sun. Locals will stay covered up, protecting their skin and will seek shade wherever they can.\n\nBig sheets of canopy will be erected on the main streets and umbrellas will pop up at all outside terrace areas. So, don’t whip the shirt off or walk around in a bikini top if you get too hot, seek the shade.\n\nDo pick a football team to follow\n\nHow to not look like a tourist in Madrid? There are two big football teams here, Real Madrid and Athletico Madrid. To not stand out as a tourist, pick a team and join in the football frenzy.\n\nEvery restaurant, café and bar in Madrid will show their matches. So, you can’t really avoid it. Literally every TV screen in Madrid will be showing their games and everyone will be talking about it.\n\nPerri is a Brit living in Madrid.
