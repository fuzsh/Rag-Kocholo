        "text": "Once you’re around 36 weeks pregnant, you’re going to want to make sure that you’ve got your hospital bag at the ready. The last thing you need when you’re counting contractions is to be running around looking for clean socks!\n\nIt’s worth asking your hospital in advance what they supply so you don’t end up packing unnecessary items. When we visited our hospital of choice in Torrejón, they told us that they provide towels, bath sponges, maternity pads and disposable underwear, nightgowns for mum, nappies and clothes for babies.\n\nTo help with organising things, I found it easier to pack baby’s stuff separately from my own. I just packed their regular changing bag with a few extra items, and brought another bag for myself, with a few things for my husband too.\n\nWhen I was packing baby’s bag, I used sandwich bags to organise everything neatly. The sleepsuits went in one bag; vests in another; socks, bibs and hats in another… It meant that in the hospital we weren’t rooting through a full bag trying to find what we were looking for.\n\nChanging bag (check out our other post on “What to pack: Baby Changing Bag”)\n\nChanging mat\n\n3 sleepsuits with long arms and legs to keep baby nice and toasty\n\n3 vests\n\n3 muslin cloths\n\nBurt’s Bees Baby Oil (for helping to clean that first sticky, tarry poop)\n\nHand sanitiser\n\nNappy bags\n\nGoing-home outfit\n\nNappies\n\nCotton pads\n\nNappy rash cream\n\n2 cellular blankets\n\n2 bibs\n\n3 pairs of socks\n\n1 pair of soft booties\n\n3 hats\n\nWet wipes\n\nCar seat\n\nFor Mum\n\nYour birth plan and hospital notes\n\nBoob care kit – this is mostly for breastfeeding mums\n\nNipple shields\n\nBreast pads- reusable or disposable\n\nNipple compresses\n\nNipple Balm\n\nMake-up\n\nToothbrush\n\nToothpaste\n\nAny medication you need\n\nWitch hazel spray (for relieving swelling and inflammation after labour)\n\nDeodorant\n\nLip balm (your lips can get really dry during labour)\n\nShampoo, conditioner, shower gel, face wash\n\nFace cloths (useful for patting yourself dry after a shower, especially if you’ve had stitches)\n\nMassage oil\n\nToiletry bag\n\nHair ties\n\nHairbrush\n\nWater spray bottle or a hand-held fan to keep you refreshed\n\nSnacks and energy drinks like Aquarius\n\nA bikini (if you’re interested in a water birth or in using a shower to help with pain relief)\n\nFlip flops for wearing in the shower\n\nSlippers, cosy socks (your feet can get surprisingly cold during labour), a nightdress or t-shirt for labour and pyjamas for the nights that you’ll be staying in the hospital\n\nA dark dressing gown (in case of any stains)\n\nNursing bras\n\nComfy underwear (I bought a multi-pack of black Granny-pants from Primark that I could throw away afterwards)\n\nA towel\n\n3 changes of comfy clothes, including something to go home in\n\nBirthing ball (if the hospital doesn’t have them)\n\nHeat pack\n\nSomething to keep you distracted: your phone, charger, laptop with films downloaded, playlist, headphones, a book\n\nYou might also want to bring your own pillow\n\nFor your partner\n\nA change of clothes\n\nToothbrush\n\nDeodorant\n\nSnacks and drinks\n\nComfortable shoes\n\nSwimming trunks if they plan on joining you in the pool or the shower\n\nChange for parking and vending machines\n\nThat’s it! So get packing and don’t leave it too late!\n\nIs there anything else that you’d add? Or anything else that you wish you hadn’t packed? Let us know on our Facebook page!"
