        "text": "How to help your cat during birth\n\nBefore your cat gives birth, talk to your vet to ask if your cat needs any specific support or treatments during pregnancy and birth.\n\nThe secret to being a good midwife to your cat is observation and timing. It is best to watch your cat from a distance, taking care not to disturb her or make her anxious. Your cat may be able to give birth without needing any help from you, but it's important to understand your cat's needs, as well as those of her kittens, in case your help is required. Contact your vet if any problems occur.\n\nHave clean towels, a warm water bottle, a feeding bottle or syringe and some specialist substitute cat milk replacement - not cow or goat milk - ready in advance.\n\nBirth, also called kittening or parturition, is divided into three stages, and the second and third stages are repeated for each kitten. Time between delivery of kittens is usually 10 to 60 minutes and stages two and three are repeated. The birth is usually complete within six hours after the start of the second stage, but can last up to 12 hours."
