        "text": "What is a stoma?\n\nIf have part of your bowel or bladder removed for medical reasons, your surgeon may need to form a stoma. This is an opening in your abdomen (tummy area) to the outside of your body. The stoma is used to remove body waste — faeces (poo) or urine (wee) into a small collection bag that is placed outside your body.\n\nStomas can be created anywhere along the digestive system. Common types of stoma include:\n\ncolostomy — from your colon or large intestine\n\nileostomy — from your small bowel or ileum\n\nurostomy (also known as an ileal conduit) — if your bladder is removed, your surgeon can form a new ‘pouch’ out of small bowel tissue to hold urine. Your urostomy will allow urine to pass from this pouch into a stoma bag outside your body.\n\nYour stoma will look moist and pinkish-red and will protrude slightly from a round hole in your abdomen. Your stoma may be swollen to begin with, but will usually reduce in size over time. You shouldn't feel anything in the stoma, and it shouldn’t be painful. Over time, bodily waste and gas will pass out through the stoma instead of your anus or urethra.\n\nA stoma can be permanent or temporary.\n\nWhat is the difference between a permanent and a temporary stoma?\n\nMany stomas are temporary and can be reversed with surgery, usually after 3 to 12 months. In some cases, you will need a stoma permanently, for example, if the ends of your bowel can’t be reconnected after surgery, or if your anus needs to be removed due to a tumour.\n\nWhy might I need a stoma?\n\nStomas are needed by people of all ages, from newborns to older people and for a variety of reasons, including:\n\ntrauma to the abdomen (such as caused by a car accident or another major injury)\n\nsurgery to remove bowel cancer or other cancers in your pelvic area\n\ndiseases such as Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis\n\ncongenital (birth) abnormalities\n\nrare genetic disorders\n\nneurological (nervous system) disorders that make emptying your bowel or bladder difficult\n\nchanges to the bowel’s blood supply in premature babies and older people\n\nfollowing radiotherapy in your pelvic area\n\nHow do I manage daily life with a stoma?\n\nLiving with a stoma can seem daunting at first, but you’re not alone. Over 42,000 Australians live with a stoma. With help and support, many maintain a normal quality of life.\n\nWhile it’s not easy at first, with the right help and support, most people manage their stoma as part of their daily hygiene routine. It may take time and practice, but stomal therapy nurses and specialists can help with the adjustment process.\n\nASK YOUR DOCTOR — Preparing for an appointment? Use the Question Builder for general tips on what to ask your GP or specialist.\n\nFIND A HEALTH SERVICE — The Service Finder can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services.\n\nUsing your stoma equipment\n\nLearning to live with your stoma may take time. Following your surgery, a stomal therapy nurse will show you how to clean your stoma and change your bag. They can offer advice, tips and tricks and answer any questions you may have.\n\nThere are several different types of stoma bags, depending on the type of stoma you have. These include ileostomy, colostomy and urostomy bags. Your nurse will help you to work out which one is most suitable for you.\n\nDiet\n\nImmediately after surgery, you may need to eat less and more often, but you should gradually build up what you are eating and how much. This helps you to regain more predictable bowel movements and allow you to learn how often and when you will need to change your bag.\n\nTry to maintain a well-balanced diet. Chew your food properly and don’t eat large amounts of food at one time. You may want to avoid certain foods that are difficult to digest and may cause blockages, such as nuts, fruit and vegetable skins and corn.\n\nMost people can return to their normal diet. If you have any concerns, speak with your doctor or stomal therapy nurse and they can refer you to a dietitian.\n\nOdour and wind\n\nSome foods may produce more wind (flatulence or 'gas') than others. If this bothers you, consider cutting down on those foods.\n\nFoods that may cause wind include:\n\npeas and beans\n\ncabbage\n\nbroccoli\n\nonion\n\ncauliflower\n\nsoft drinks and beer\n\nFoods that may reduce odour include:\n\nyoghurt and probiotic drinks\n\ncranberry juice\n\nstewed or grated apple (without skin)\n\nbuttermilk\n\nSwallowing air can also cause wind. Try avoiding chewing gum or chewing with your mouth open. Smoking and snoring can also make you swallow more air.\n\nSport and exercise\n\nHaving a stoma shouldn’t stop you from enjoying most sports or physical activities. You should avoid any extreme contact sports.\n\nThere are special supports, bags and caps you can use to cover your stoma when swimming and playing sport.\n\nTravel\n\nAfter surgery, you may have an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Talk to your surgeon before any air travel.\n\nRemember to pack enough stoma-related supplies for your time away. Be prepared for extra bag changes while traveling or on your holiday.\n\nIt may be helpful to carry a doctor’s letter explaining your condition or a travel certificate signed by your stomal therapy nurse or doctor.\n\nSex and body image\n\nWho you tell and how much you say about your stoma is entirely your choice.\n\nOnce your body has had time to heal from surgery, it’s okay to have sex with a stoma. Sexual intercourse won’t harm your stoma. You may find it helpful to plan ahead, for example, emptying your stoma bag beforehand to lower the chances of any unwanted 'accidents'.\n\nIt’s important to talk to your partner about how you feel regarding sex and intimacy. If you’re nervous about how your partner may react to your stoma, remember that there’s more to how they feel about you than your physical appearance.\n\nResources and support\n\nThere is a range of support services to help Australians live well with a stoma."
