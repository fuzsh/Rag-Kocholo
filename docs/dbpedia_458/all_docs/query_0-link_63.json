        "text": "Spain contains multitudes—seriously. Spanning 17 autonomous regions and two small enclaves in North Africa, the country is a cradle of diverse cultures, geography, traditions, even languages. And while there’s nothing wrong with a sun-and-sangria holiday, there’s so much more to see and do: embark on a luxury train ride across Spain’s mountainous north, go on a wine and architecture pilgrimage in Rioja, discover the sleepy side of Ibiza, and travel back in time to Andalucía’s Moorish past. The landscapes are just as diverse—from Lanzarote’s lunar lava plains to the lush archipelago of Islas Cíes and the stunning rock formations in the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Nature Reserve (Europe’s only desert!).\n\nFirst-timers typically make a beeline for Madrid and Barcelona, but even then, most people will only scratch the surface of these cities and their surroundings. Just an hour outside Madrid are art-filled medieval castles, mountain hiking trails, a “beach” for beating the heat, and even an under-the-radar Picasso museum. Plus, there’s so much to see in Catalonia beyond Barcelona, not least the picturesque coves and charming seaside towns of the Costa Brava. One trip isn’t enough—Spain is a place to discover again and again.\n\nHaving a hard time deciding where to go first? Here are 10 trip ideas to get you started.\n\nMadrid: A Feast for the Senses\n\nIn recent years, Mallorca has shed its reputation as a package holiday destination and emerged as one of Spain’s most sophisticated hotspots. Now, the Balearic island is synonymous with art and culture, hip hotels, and stellar boutique shopping. Get in step with the island’s rhythms in the capital of Palma, home to indie shops like Arquinesia Perfumes and Cortana, lively bars and restaurants including Brutus and CAV, and one magnificent 14th-century cathedral—the island’s most recognizable landmark. Learn about Mallorca’s rich craft traditions such as “llata” basket weaving and Ikat textile design by signing up for a workshop on the dada-days platform, or head to the mountain towns of Deià and Sóller to discover locally-made goods and artworks at creative businesses like Earth Core, Datura Studio Isla or the café-cum-ceramic-shop De Moniö.\n\nStay Here: Mallorca’s new kid on the block is the 14-room Portella Palma, launched by brother-and-sister team Enrique and Inés Miró-Sans of Barcelona’s Casa Bonay fame and designed by Parisian design duo Festen. Once the home of Spanish painter Joaquín Torrents, the 17th-century palazzo still feels like an artist’s residence, with antique furniture, views of the city’s 11th-century Arab Baths, and artful details around every corner—from a Joan Miró lithograph to custom pieces by 300-year-old Mallorcan glass company Gordiola.\n\nFresh Air and Bold Flavor in Asturias\n\nMost serenity-seekers decamp to the lesser-developed Balearic isles of Formentera and Menorca. But Ibiza also has a quiet side, with pristine secluded beaches, a pastoral countryside, and small inland villages with a bohemian soul that harks back to the island’s hippie past. One of its best-known natural areas is the UNESCO-listed Ses Salines Natural Park, a vast ecological sanctuary with salt flats and roughly 200 species of birds. The island is also known for its dense meadows of water-cleaning Posidonia seagrass, which are among the best preserved in the Mediterranean. The once-sleepy town of Santa Gertrudis is now one of the island’s hotspots, with trendy boutiques like Es Cucons, lively restaurants including an outpost of New York-born Il Buco, and an all-seasons Parra & Romero gallery. Not far from that is the village of Sant Mateu d’Albarca, where you’ll find the farm-to-table restaurant Juntos, which serves vegetable-centric dishes with ingredients sourced from the 173-acre farm. (Don’t leave without perusing ceramics, botanical-dyed robes, and other goodies at the expertly edited on-site boutique). Even the island’s famous party scene has grown up; today, the hardest rope in town is arguably the gastronomic chiringuito Jondal, helmed by El Bulli alum Rafa Zafra.\n\nStay Here: Founded in 1999 by Barcelona native Margaret Von Korff and her Ibiza-born husband Luis Trigueros, Cas Gasi is one of the island’s original agroturismos. A 19th-century finca is at the heart of the sprawling estate, which comprises four hectares of fruit orchards and vegetable gardens along with two pools, an open-air-yoga platform, and a revamped spa offering reiki and Ayurvedic massages.\n\nCatalonia Beyond Barcelona\n\nAndalucía is a mille-feuille of civilizations and cultures; however, its top attractions are the towering fortresses, monumental mosques, and awe-inspiring palaces constructed during the Moors’ 800-year rule. There are few sites as impressive or as well preserved as Granada’s formidable Alhambra fortress, which contains a series of 13th to 15th-century Moorish palaces and gardens, backed by the snow-capped peaks of the Sierra Nevada. Still, you don’t need to endure long ticket lines to step back in history. In Códoba, chef Paco Morale’s two-starred Michelin-starred Noor (“light” in Arabic) borrows inspiration from Andalucía’s layered, overlapping history: currently on offer are a trio of menus inspired by the “Golden Age” of the 16th and 17th centuries, with dishes incorporating prized ingredients such as saffron and orange blossom water. In Malaga, the popular El Pimpi restaurant—which streams across an 18th-century townhouse across from the Roman theater—feels like a time capsule with its wine barrel decoration, bull head taxidermy, and old black-and-white photographs. And it goes without saying that Seville tiene un color especial (or so the song goes…)—just strolling its atmospheric streets is like traveling back in time, but be sure to set aside time to tour the Casa de Pilatos palace, which features some of the most impressive Mudejar-style tile work we’ve ever seen.\n\nStay Here: Located an hour outside Seville, Caballo de Hierro is a 54,000-acre estate centered on a sprawling country house that’s kitted with antique treasures and embroidered textiles. But the highlight is the turquoise-tile stable housing a team of thoroughbred Spanish and Arab horses, which can be ridden through the property's flower-covered hills.\n\nBeauty and Bounty in the Basque Country\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about the Basque Country without mentioning the food. The region is known for its boisterous pintxo bars, cider houses, and more Michelin stars per square meter than almost anywhere else in the world. You could spend days eating your way through Bilbao and San Sebastián, but don’t leave out the many culinary institutions outside the city like the family-run Casa Cámara restaurant in the fishing village of Pasai Donibane, just north of San Sebastián, which uses a pulley to lift shellfish out of the water and into the middle of the dining room. In recent decades, the País Basco has also established a reputation as one of Spain’s most vibrant arts hubs, home to heavy-hitting institutions like the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and contemporary galleries including Galeria Espacio Marzana and Villa Magdalena. Be sure not to miss the Chillida Leku sculpture park dedicated to the Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida.\n\nStay Here: San Sebastián is packed to the gills with smart city hotels. But for a bit more room to spread out, make the newly revamped Villa Soro—located just a 10-minute walk from Zurriola beach—as your home base. Reopened in 2022 by the Soldevila-Ferrer family, who also own Barcelona’s Hotel Majestic and Mallorca’s Sant Francesc Hotel Singular, the heritage property has refined interiors, original details like a wood-carved staircase, and artwork by famous Basque artists including Eduardo Chillida.\n\nA Design Detour on Lanzarote\n\nNo man is an island, but we have the visionary artist César Manrique to thank for the Canarian jewel that is Lanzarote. When others disparaged the island as being the ugliest in the entire archipelago—“nothing but camels and stones”—Manrique marveled at its elemental beauty and rustic simplicity. During the last two decades of his life, he devoted himself to creating gardens, lookouts, and cultural centers while protecting its coastline from the mass development you see on some of the other Canary Isles. His influence is everywhere, from the Timanfaya National Park (where he designed the tourist facilities) to the island’s Museum of Modern Art, the popular Jameos del Agua lava caves, and his former house turned museum. Once you’ve immersed yourself in the world of all things Manrique, discover Lanzarote’s other allures such as its otherworldly vineyards, planted in volcanic ash soil and encircled by low-lying rock walls—the designs are so artful, you might think Manrique had something to do with it.\n\nStay Here: Set inside the former home of César Manrique’s father, the 20-room César Lanzarote is a singular place to stay. It also has a prized location within La Geria Natural Park, surrounded by the estate’s original vineyards. Still, the most show-stopping feature might be designer Virginia Nieto’s island-inspired interiors—all white and green tones, stone and wood surfaces, and linen fabrics.\n\nSeeing Green in Galicia"
