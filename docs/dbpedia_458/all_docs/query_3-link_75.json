        "text": "Meconium aspiration syndrome\n\nMeconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) refers to breathing problems that a newborn baby may have when:\n\nThere are no other known causes of symptoms\n\nThe baby has passed meconium (stool) into the amniotic fluid during labor or delivery\n\nMAS may occur if the baby breathes (aspirates) this fluid into the lungs.\n\nMeconium is the early stool passed by a newborn soon after birth, before the baby starts to feed and digest milk or formula.\n\nIn some cases, the baby passes meconium while still inside the uterus. This can happen when babies are \"under stress\"Ã‚ due to a decrease in blood and oxygen supply. This is often due to problems with the placenta or the umbilical cord.\n\nOnce the baby passes the meconium into the surrounding amniotic fluid, they may breathe it into the lungs. This may happen:\n\nWhile the baby is still in the uterus\n\nDuring delivery\n\nImmediately after birth\n\nThe meconium can also block the infant's airways right after birth. It can cause breathing problems due to disrupting the balance of proteins normally present as well as causing swelling (inflammation) in the baby's lungs after birth and disrupting the normal changes of blood flow between the heart and lungs following birth.\n\nRisk factors that may cause stress on the baby before birth include:\n\n\"Aging\" of the placenta if the pregnancy goes far past the due date\n\nDecreased oxygen to the infant while in the uterus\n\nDiabetes in the pregnant mother\n\nDifficult delivery or long labor\n\nHigh blood pressure in the pregnant mother\n\nInfection in the placenta affecting the baby\n\nMost babies who have passed meconium into the amniotic fluid do not breathe it into their lungs during labor and delivery. They are unlikely to have any symptoms or problems.\n\nBabies who do breathe in this fluid may have the following:\n\nBluish skin color (cyanosis) in the infant\n\nWorking hard to breathe (noisy breathing, grunting, using extra muscles to breathe, breathing rapidly)\n\nNo breathing (lack of respiratory effort, or apnea)\n\nLimpness at birth\n\nExams and Tests\n\nBefore birth, the fetal monitor may show a slow heart rate. During delivery or at birth, meconium can be seen in the amniotic fluid and on the infant.\n\nThe infant may need help with breathing or heartbeat right after birth. They may have a low Apgar score.\n\nThe health care team will listen to the infant's chest with a stethoscope. This may reveal abnormal breath sounds, especially coarse, crackly sounds.\n\nA blood gas analysis will show:\n\nLow (acidic) blood pH\n\nDecreased oxygen\n\nIncreased carbon dioxide\n\nA chest x-ray may show patchy or streaky areas in the infant's lungs.\n\nA special care team should be present when the baby is born if traces of meconium are found in the amniotic fluid. This happens in more than 10% of normal pregnancies. If the baby is active and crying, no treatment is needed.\n\nIf the baby is not active and crying right after delivery, the team will:\n\nWarm and maintain normal temperature\n\nDry and stimulate the baby\n\nThis intervention is often all babies need to begin breathing on their own.\n\nIf the baby is not breathing or has a low heart rate:\n\nThe team will help the baby breathe using a face mask attached to a bag that delivers an oxygen mixture to inflate the baby's lungs.\n\nThe infant may be placed in the special care nursery or newborn intensive care unit in order to be watched closely.\n\nOther treatments may include:\n\nAntibiotics to treat possible infection.\n\nBreathing machine (ventilator) if baby is unable to breathe on their own or needs a large amount of extra oxygen.\n\nOxygen to keep blood levels normal.\n\nIntravenous (IV) nutrition (nutrition through the veins) if breathing problems are keeping baby from being able to feed by mouth.\n\nRadiant warmer to maintain body temperature.\n\nSurfactant to help lungs exchange oxygen. This is only used in more severe cases.\n\nNitric oxide (also referred to as NO, an inhaled gas) to help blood flow and oxygen exchange in the lungs. This is only used in severe cases.\n\nECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) is a kind of heart/lung bypass. It may be used in very severe cases.\n\nOutlook (Prognosis)\n\nIn most cases of meconium-stained fluid, the outlook is excellent and there are no long-term health effects.\n\nOnly about 5% of babies with meconium-stained fluid will have MAS.\n\nBabies may need extra support with breathing and nutrition in some cases. This need will often go away in 2 to 4 days. However, rapid breathing may continue for several days.\n\nMAS rarely leads to permanent lung damage. Some babies with severe MAS may have problems with coughing and wheezing for the first 5 to 10 years.\n\nMAS can occur along with a rare but serious problem with the blood flow to and from the lungs. This is called persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).\n\nTo prevent problems that lead to meconium being present, stay healthy during pregnancy and follow your health care provider's advice.\n\nYour provider will want to be prepared for meconium being present at birth if:\n\nYour water broke at home and the fluid was clear or stained with a greenish or brown substance.\n\nAny testing done during your pregnancy indicates there may be problems present.\n\nFetal monitoring shows any signs of fetal distress.\n\nAlternative Names\n\nMAS; Meconium pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs); Labor - meconium; Delivery - meconium; Neonatal - meconium; Newborn care - meconium\n\nAhlfeld SK.
