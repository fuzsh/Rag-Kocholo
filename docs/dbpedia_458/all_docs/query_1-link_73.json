        "text": "Continuing with the series of things you should avoid in different places, started with 8 things you should never do in Barcelona, and continued by things to avoid in Oman and Seoul, here you have the next entry. Eight things you should never do in Madrid, by fellow blogger Or Amir, from My Path in The World. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!\n\n8 Things you shouldn’t do in Madrid – By Or Amir\n\nMadrid is truly an incredible city and one that offers something for every type of traveler. Whether you’re a foodie, history and culture fan, or a trendier kind of traveler, Madrid has you covered. It is also the type of city that can fit any travel budget, which is a huge plus. Of course, just like with every destination, you should get to know its dos and don’ts. So, to make the most of your trip and not look like a total tourist, here are eight things not to do in Madrid.\n\nDon’t start your day too early\n\nJust like in other Spanish cities, most of the attractions, cafes, and shops only open at 9 or 10 AM. So, unless you have other morning plans like strolling in the park or wandering the streets of Madrid, getting up early would be completely useless. Take it from a person who was trying to get breakfast in Madrid at 8:30 AM. Believe me, it was not an easy task.\n\nYou should not use taxis in Madrid\n\nIf there’s one major thing I advise you not to do in Madrid is taking taxis from one point to another. Madrid is one of the easiest cities to get around, thanks to its extensive Metro system. You can find a Metro station on every other corner, so this is essentially the best way to move around the city. Madrid’s Metro system is also well-connected to the airport, which means there’s no need to take a taxi to the city center. Other public transportation options include buses, light rail, and trains, so even taking day trips outside the city is easy.\n\nDon’t look for accomodation around Puerta del Sol or Gran Via\n\nI do not know why, but it seems like most people only consider Puerta del Sol and Gran Via as Madrid’s city center. However, Madrid’s touristic area is a lot more extensive than that. It means you don’t have to limit your hotel search to that one specific spot. There are plenty of well-located accommodations in Madrid that aren’t near Puerta del Sol or Gran Via you shouldn’t rule out. As I’ve also mentioned, Madrid’s Metro is practically everywhere, yet another reason not to limit yourself while looking for the perfect accommodation.\n\nDon’t only go sight seeing\n\nTicking landmarks off a bucket list is one big thing not to do in Madrid or in any other city. Obviously, sightseeing is a major part of traveling. But, there’s also something really fun about wandering around the streets of a city without a specific destination. Thanks to such cool neighborhoods, Madrid’s streets are 100% worth wandering, so you should make time for that on your Madrid itinerary. From traditional La Latina to hipster Malasaña to diverse Lavapies. Each neighborhood uncovers a different and unique side of Madrid.\n\nDo not look for paellas\n\nAs much as I love paella (and I do), eating one is something you really shouldn’t do in Madrid. The paella was originally born in the Valencian Community. Unfortunately, too many restaurants across Spain are doing it an injustice. In addition, Madrid’s culinary scene (both traditional and modern) is so amazing that you have plenty of other food experiences to try. From traditional tapas bars and taverns to cool cafes and modern restaurants, this city has it all. So, if you want to enjoy the local food scene, searching for a paella restaurant is one important thing to avoid in Madrid.\n\nDo not expect everyone to speak English\n\nThis one is more of a fact rather than an active thing not to do in Madrid, but it is important to know. Most people in Spain do not speak English or speak very little of it. Even young people don’t always know English, so don’t expect everyone to understand what you’re saying. However, most Spaniards are super kind and will try to help you as much as they can. To feel more confident, try learning a few basic words. Maybe some sentences, and numbers in Spanish.\n\nDo not eat at the Plaza Mayor\n\nThis is one of the most important things not to do in Madrid. Every city has its tourist trap restaurant area, and on Madrid’s case, it is Plaza Mayor. This beautiful big square is such a popular tourist spot. And I get why it’s very tempting to sit and eat there. However, whether you’re looking for an authentic Spanish meal or a unique foodie experience, this is not where you’ll find them. Instead, head to La Latina for tapas, try one of Malasaña’s trendy cafes or treat yourself at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Salamanca neighborhood.\n\nOne last thing you shouldn’t do in Madrid. Do not underestimate pickpockets\n\nAs in Barcelona, one thing you really shouldn’t do in Madrid is ignoring basic safety rules. Pick pocketing is very common in European cities, Madrid included. Although Madrid is a safe city in general, you should still watch your belongings while wandering around. One of the most important places to keep your things safe is El Rastro Market. It is a popular flea market taking place every Sunday in Lavapies neighborhood, and it is heaven for pickpockets. Other places to be careful include Puerta del Sol, restaurants, and the Metro.\n\nOn the top of the page you have a link to Or’s blog where you can read much more about Madrid and many other cities. Go check it out as she has lots of information! I promise you it will be worth your visit.\n\nAlso, if you enjoyed this post, share the love! And hope to see you back."
