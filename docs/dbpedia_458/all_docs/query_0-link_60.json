In 2018 was incubated in León, Guanajuato working hand in hand with artisans to make pieces such as bags, shoes and leather goods of the highest leather goods of the highest quality. In 2019 it established itself in CDMX showing its DNA as a brand with a western and country contemporary aesthetic aligned to global trends, but through its own personality.\n\nToronero seeks that each of its pieces have the best quality of materials and workmanship, without neglecting the innovation and proposal, by being innovation and proposal, by constantly working on quality control and searching for new materials and silhouettes.\n\n-Lines from the Toronero collection\n\nBONANZAS\n\nInspired by a utopian summer under the Mexican sun, Bonanzas, brings us pieces full of the serenity and abundance that is lived in the countryside while paying tribute to the natural beauty of its landscapes enjoying magical sunsets full of magical sunsets full of colour.\n\nEach one of her garments seeks to capture the essence of the places far from the city where you can appreciate the sunny days with clear skies and starry nights that can not be appreciated with the urban lights.\n\nWith a very western vibe, Toronero x Mykita presents the best quality leathers in trousers, blazers, skirts, boots, belts and of course we can't stop obsessing over their bags, which without a doubt are the statement piece anyone needs in their wardrobe.\n\nTheir contemporary, carefree combinations and haughty silhouettes are all we need for the summer."
