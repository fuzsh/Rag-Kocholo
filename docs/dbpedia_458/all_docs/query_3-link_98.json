        "text": "This story is part of Junk Food, Redefined, our new collection of snack recommendations, recipes, and perspectives that celebrate an undervalued food group. Read all the stories here.\n\nAfter stuffing myself silly with french fries and corn dogs at the agricultural fair in Adelaide, South Australia, kid-me would relish going home and dizzily spreading my candy haul out on my bed. I’d go to town on the gooey caramels encased in chocolate, raspberry chews, and fizzy orange sherbets. Those were God-tier. Bottom of the barrel? Black jellybeans—and stuck-together clumps of foul, fennel-y licorice.\n\nTo me, licorice tastes like a cross between tree sap and molten tar that’s been congealed and pressed into strips tough as literal leather. I’ve always marveled that it’s the confection seemingly as divisive as climate change and crunchy peanut butter, yet, inexplicably, stays on the shelves.\n\nIt’s made from an unholy union of licorice extract, sugar, and some manner of binding agent. Beeswax is usually responsible for the characteristic rubbery sheen, and molasses (or a deal with the devil?) is what creates the ebony color. In Australia, where I’m from, licorice tends to be a staple for dads, nannas, and people who haven’t gotten the memo that candy’s had a come-up.\n\nDespite its ample supporters, I’m not the only one who finds the stuff hard to love. In a 2012 story for NBC News, writer Meghan Holohan tried to get to the bottom of what makes licorice so polarizing. The anise-y flavor comes from the root of the Glycyrrhiza glabra plant, and you’ll find its pungent essence in various products, from Jägermeister to NyQuil. Although, unlike the case with cilantro, there’s no gene dictating whether or not you can stand the taste of licorice—it appears you’re either born liking it or not. In all my years I have not learned to love it. Another theory is that some people seem to have an aversion to glycyrrhizin, the natural sweetener present in licorice root that tastes like the saccharin in those bright pink Sweet’N Low packets.\n\nHow licorice wormed its way past our lips in the first place is a mystery to me. Yet worm it did. Licorice’s appearance on the culinary and medicinal stages really dates back to prehistoric times. In 400 BC, Greek physician Hippocrates was apparently telling anyone who’d listen about the potent ingredient and its potential to treat ulcers and quench thirst. Alexander the Great doled out rations to his troops to keep them hydrated on long marches. And explorers even found stockpiles of licorice, an ingredient used in ancient Egypt to make sweet drinks, in Tutankhamun’s tomb—alongside other arguably more valuable Egyptian treasures.\n\nThe root that’s still used to make licorice extract today comes from a flowering shrub that thrives in the rich soils and subtropical climates found primarily in European, Middle Eastern, and South Asian countries. Meaning “sweet root” in Greek, glycyrrhizin may sound like an unfortunate diagnosis, but the name is apt: The compound is 40 times sweeter than sugar. Licorice root comes with a host of supposed benefits, including the ability to help suppress coughs and clear phlegm from your airways, as well as reduce inflammation and viral loads. It’s also suspected to fight cancer, diabetes, and dental disease, though the science on this has been as mixed as a bag of assorted sweets.\n\nBe warned: Ingesting too much can result in a range of possible side effects—from an irregular heartbeat to high blood pressure, muscle weakness, and lethargy—caused by glycyrrhizin depleting your body’s potassium levels. Most people wouldn’t eat the quantities required to trigger these side effects (two ounces a day for a fortnight). And, to its defense, licorice does try to ward you off with its poisonous taste.\n\nThe English town of Pontefract is reportedly the birthplace of the bittersweet candy. In 1760 a pharmacist supposedly added sugar to a cough medicine containing licorice root to make it more palatable, and manufacturers began cranking it out in the mid-1800s. From there, licorice went viral in various countries. In Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands—where the most licorice per capita in the world is consumed—salmiakki, a black, salted, diamond-shaped, and deeply astringent version is beloved by superfans. In the U.S. Twizzlers and Red Vines both make black licorice twists. The French are all about Cachou Lajaunie pastels, which are intended to freshen your breath after a meal. In Sweden they’re so keen on the stuff, they kicked off Lakritsfestivalen (“licorice festival”) in 2009, featuring tastings, contests, entertainment, and even sculptures made out of the substance.\n\nWisely, many of the Australian confectionary companies I grew up with mask the taste of licorice itself by smothering it in chocolate to form a “bullet.” We also favor dressing up our licorice as colorfully layered cubes and other miscellaneous shapes called “allsorts” a concept we borrowed from the Brits. Cult brand Darrell Lea claims to make enough licorice to wrap around the Earth each year. It also manufactures imitation flavors that cut out the fennel-like substance altogether, featuring raspberry, grape, mango, green apple, and pineapple varieties in their range at various points.\n\nSomehow demand for the real deal, black licorice, is growing, especially in Europe and North America. A 2020-2030 forecast by Transparency Market Research, a global consumer analytics firm, predicts licorice, thanks to its natural sweetness, could fill the gap left by those of us abandoning sugary “junk foods” for better health. While it’s baffling to me, it also makes sense: 10.4 percent of the world population is expected to be diabetic by 2030.\n\nDespite its potential health benefits and long, twisted history, I was born loathing licorice. When I find it in my mixed bags, it takes a swift flight to the nearest bin. I can, however, admire its tenacity. For a candy born of cough medicine, licorice has really pulled itself up by the boot, er, straps. I respect that kind of sticking power—just not in my molars, please."
