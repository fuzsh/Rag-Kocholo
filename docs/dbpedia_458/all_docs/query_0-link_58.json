        "text": "A few weeks ago, the prestigious brand Loewe presented in China its new series of Postal bags whose design is based on nine cities in the world that stand out as protagonists of the collection. These are some of the first designs that were born under the creative direction of Jonathan Anderson.\n\nAmong the 9 models that make up this collection, there is one that will be sold exclusively in the Loewe Store in Passeig de Gràcia and that, in our opinion, stands out from the others. It is, of course, a design based on the city of Barcelona and in which we can see some of the emblematic monuments and symbols of our city, such as the Sagrada Família or the statue dedicated to Christopher Columbus.\n\nThe Postal series has been created with a style reminiscent of classic handbags that also reflects the sensitivity of current fashion trends, with a rigid structure that is covered with leather of the highest quality, a feature that has always been a trademark of this Spanish firm.\n\nIn addition to Barcelona, the other main cities in the Postal collection are Madrid, London, Paris, New York, Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Beijing. The designs were inspired by some of the most recognizable and emblematic places of all these cities.\n\nThese designs can now be purchased in the Loewe brand, at number 35 of Passeig de Gràcia, precisely in one of the most symbolic buildings of our city: The Casa Lleó i Morera, by Lluís Domènech i Montaner.\n\nIs there even a better place to admire them?\n\nThis website uses cookies so that we can provide you with the best user experience possible.
