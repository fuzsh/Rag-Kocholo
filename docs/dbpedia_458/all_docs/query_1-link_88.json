        "text": "Shaped by social, cultural, and political forces, identities in the Americas are not fixed, but mutable and diverse. One of the driving forces for many artists is the desire to inspire change. This urge may result from their own search for identity or may reflect their responses to inequality, marginalization, and other factors that render them absent from the mainstream discourse.\n\nAlexander Apóstol\n\nVenezuelan, born 1969, lives and works in Caracas and Madrid\n\nClockwise: MONCHO Movimiento de Organización Nacional con Honestidad Administrativa; IDEAL Integración Democrática de Altura; FPI Fuerza Popular Independiente; PAN Partido Autentico Nacionalista, from the series Partidos Políticos Desaparecidos [Disappeared Political Parties]\n\n2018\n\nDigital inkjet prints\n\nFunds from Frederic H. Douglas by exchange (2019.338); Funds from Ethel Sayre Berger by exchange (2019.339); Funds from Modern and Contemporary Art and an anonymous donor by exchange (2019.337, .340)\n\nAlexander Apostol creates paintings, which he then photographs, that reproduce voting cards from the sixty-four minority political parties that disappeared during the so-called democratic period in Venezuela (1958–98). Devoid of text and image, the photos show only the colorful geometric designs of the voting cards’ background, which helped illiterate people recognize political parties and cast their vote.\n\nReligious figures wielded spiritual and political power in the ancient Maya world and the Spanish Christian world. Here, the Maya ruler presents himself as both ruler and priest interceding on behalf of his people with the gods. The portrait on the right shows the Archbishop of Mexico, representative of the authority of the Catholic Church in the spiritual and political realms. In both cases, power is directly derived from the individual’s proximity to the divine.\n\nUnknown artist\n\nMaya culture, Río Azul, Guatemala\n\nCylinder Vessel with Image of Seated Lord and Attendants at Court\n\n600–800\n\nCeramic with colored slips\n\nFunds from various donors, Volunteer Endowment Fund, and department acquisition funds, 2003.1\n\nTelling a tale of social mobility, this Maya vessel shows a man with one arm outstretched and the other holding a bouquet of flowers. Behind him are his brothers, and surrounding them are all his worldly goods, including three bags of black beans, proudly presented as a display of wealth. That he could afford to commission this vessel, painted in the style of a royal palace scene, is a sign of high status.\n\nCasta paintings were produced to rank the complex structure of Spanish colonial society in terms of social status and racial mixing. Each family group is identified by the occupation, clothing, and objects that surround them. Similarly, contemporary photographer Daniela Rossell poses her “rich and famous” subjects amid an ostentatious display of wealth associated with their high social standing\n\nLeo Chiachio and Daniel Giannone\n\nArgentinean, born 1969; Argentinean, born 1964\n\nCalaverita\n\n2014\n\nHand embroidery with cotton thread and jewelry effect on Alexander Henry fabric\n\nLent by Chiachio & Giannone. © Chiachio & Giannone. Photo by Nacho Iasparra\n\nThe artistic duo of Chiachio & Giannone use techniques such as embroidery and needlework that are traditionally associated with femininity and domesticity. They portray themselves as a same-sex family (Argentina was the first country in Latin America to allow same-sex marriage) alongside their dachshund in elaborate and colorful compositions. The figures in their work often wear masks that conceal their identities as a commentary on the still-prevalent social stigma faced by LGBTQ individuals.\n\nRafael Ochoa\n\nVenezuelan, active in Caracas 1787–1809\n\nPortrait of Don José Bernardo de Asteguieta y Díaz de Sarralde (1749–1812)\n\n1793\n\nOil paint on canvas\n\nGift of Carl Patterson in honor of Christoph Heinrich, 2017.96\n\nIn 1793, Rafael Ochoa signed and dated this portrait of a Spanish judge with a large inscription that presented himself as a man of African descent. Even though the signature is on the back of the canvas and usually hidden from view, it was a bold assertion of his right, as a free black man, to paint during a time of rigid racial segregation."
