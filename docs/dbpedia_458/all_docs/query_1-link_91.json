FOR WHAT PURPOSES WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA\n\nIn this paragraph we explain for what purposes each category of data is processed by each Data Controller or Joint Controller.\n\n3.1 PURPOSES OF DIESEL S.P.A.\n\nDiesel is the company that designs, sells and promotes the Brand’s products “Diesel”. It is the company maintaining the contacts with you if you decide to purchase the products through the Site or other websites controlled by Diesel or through other methods provided for by Diesel itself, if you participate in initiatives promoted by Diesel as prize competitions or other promotional initiatives; Diesel is also the company managing the loyalty program that you can sign in. Diesel will process Personal Data for the following purposes.\n\na) Sales activities and response to other requests made by customers\n\nIf you purchase Diesel’s products through the e-commerce service on the Site or through other methods provided for by Diesel itself, Diesel will process your Biographical Data, Contact Data, Sales Data and Purchase Data to conclude the sale, as well as for all activities strictly connected and related to it, such as delivery, where the service is available in-store collection and in-store returned, or other administrative and accounting obligations.\n\nSimilarly, Diesel may need to verify the requirements for participating to special discount programs (e.g. verifying if the purchase made is a first purchase or other requirements of the regulation) and to process your Biographical Data or Contact Data to respond to any further requests that you may formulate through the Site or through the Customer Service, through telephone or chat, such as requests for information, assistance, or to be notified by email when a desired product or size becomes available again on the Site, through the “Notify Me” functionality.\n\nLegal basis: this processing is based on the performance of a purchase contract to which you are a party; the provision of the personal data listed above is necessary for this purpose, since otherwise Diesel will not be able to process your request..\n\nb) Loyalty program Registration\n\nThe Biographical Data, Contact Data, Purchase Data and Loyalty Data will also be collected by Diesel to manage your request to join the loyalty program ( called “House of Diesel”, whose Regulation is available at the following link). These data will be processed to complete your membership and for all purposes strictly connected to it or instrumental, including - firstly - all the activities provided for in the loyalty program. Registration could take place: i) online through the Site; ii) offline in the participating shops, by completing the application form present in electronic (tablet or another smart tool) format or through flyers (distributed in shops) with a special QR code, through which customers can join the program themselves via the Site, iii) through further official channels of Diesel S.p.A., (for example, but not limited to social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, WeChat etc.), or iv) through the Customer Service.\n\nAll communications relating to the loyalty program may be made by Diesel via the Site, SMS, MMS, Wallet, e-mail, newsletter, social networks and/or any other official communication channel of Diesel. All these communications relating to the program itself are sent solely for the purpose of making available the benefits related to it and do not constitute marketing communications.\n\nFurthermore, by creating an account on the Site in the reserved area, the user will become part of the Diesel’s loyalty program. If you wish to take advantage of the services available on the Site (e.g., purchase products) without joining the program, simply choose the “Guest” option where available (e.g., during checkout for payments).\n\nLegal basis: this processing is based on the performance of a contract for joining the loyalty program to which you are a party; the provision of the Personal Data listed above is necessary for this purpose, since otherwise Diesel will not be able to process your request.\n\nc) Participation in prize contests\n\nDiesel will be able to process your Biographical Data to allow you to participate in prize contest that Diesel could organize. In certain situations, for example to proceed with the delivery of the prize, your Contact Data could also be processed. If participation in the contest requires further information, these will be requested to you upon release of a specific privacy policy.\n\nLegal basis: this processing is based on the performance of a contract for attending the relevant prize contest to which you are a party; the provision of the Personal Data listed above is necessary for this purpose, since otherwise Diesel will not be able to process your request.\n\nd) Marketing\n\nOnly with your consent, Diesel will process the Biographical Data, Contact Data and Purchase Data for marketing purposes, that is for advertising on social networks to which you are registered or sending advertising or direct sales material, carrying out market research, commercial communication with automated contact methods (e-mail, newsletter, SMS, MMS, online messaging platforms, etc.) and traditional contact methods (mail).\n\nLegal basis: this processing is based on the consent you have given. In the event that you are registered in the loyalty program and decide to withdraw your consent to marketing, you will continue to receive communications relating to benefits (such as the preview access to the new collections and promotions only reserved to members). If, in addition to the withdrawal of consent, you do not want to receive this kind of communication anymore, you will be asked to specify it. Any removal from the loyalty program will also result in the cancellation of your online account, if you have one.\n\nYou can at any time withdraw your consent to receive the above-mentioned communications by clicking on the appropriate option in each marketing email received, as well as by writing to the address privacy@diesel.com, or otherwise by contacting the company at the addresses indicated in paragraph 1.\n\ne) Customer satisfaction\n\nDiesel may use your Contact Data to conduct surveys to measure the level of satisfaction (i.e., customer satisfaction) with the service provided (by way of example but not limited to: in-store post-sales surveys; online post-sales surveys; second hand gold shopping surveys etc.). Please note that in any case the communications made for this purpose will not have an advertising content, or direct sales or will be used for market research or commercial communication.\n\nLegal basis: this processing is based on the legitimate interest of Diesel to verify and improve the quality of its services.\n\nf) Other administrative-accounting activities\n\nDiesel may also process your Personal Data for administrative, accounting and internal statistical analysis for business planning purposes.\n\nLegal basis: this processing is based on the legitimate interest of Diesel to improve the quality of its services and business.\n\n3.2 PURPOSES OF THE JOINT CONTROLLERS (DIESEL AND OTB)\n\nDiesel and OTB operate as joint controllers on the basis of a specific agreement for the purpose indicated below.\n\na) Customer profiling\n\nWith your consent, the Joint Controllers will be entitled to process Biographical Data, Contact Data, Sales Data, the Data collected in the shop, the Purchase Data, Loyalty Data, Tracking of Newsletters Data and Actions Data and the Navigation Data for profiling purposes and for business analysis, that is for analysis on your purchase preferences consisting of automated processing of the above mentioned personal data. This processing is aimed at analytically knowing or predicting your purchasing preferences also in order to create customer profiles and customize the commercial offer so that it is more in line with your preferences.\n\nLegal basis: this processing is based on the consent you have given.\n\nYou will be entitled at any time to withdraw your consent to be subject to profiling by writing to privacy@diesel.com or otherwise by contacting the Joint Controllers at the addresses indicated in paragraph 1.\n\n3.3 PURPOSES OF DIESEL AFFILIATE\n\nDiesel Affiliate is the company that manages the shop where you purchased a product, possibly by phone or other methods provided for by Diesel Affiliate, and to which you have requested assistance services. In some cases, it may be necessary for Diesel Affiliate to become aware of some information concerning you, to process specific requests you may have. Diesel Affiliate will process Personal Data for the following purposes.\n\na. Sales related services\n\nDiesel Affiliate may need to process your Biographical Data, Contact Data and certain Sales Data (tax code and/or VAT number, passport number and Global Blue card number) to manage your purchase when concluded by phone or other methods provided for by Diesel Affiliate to issue an invoice, should you request it. Moreover, these data will be processed also to re-contact you for reasons connected with your purchase, for example in case of complaints, to recall a faulty and/or unsafe product or, in general, for technical reasons, e.g., related to the management of problems with refused credit card payments and similar.\n\nLegal basis: this processing is based on the performance of a contract to which you are a party; the provision of the Personal Data listed above is necessary for this purpose, since otherwise Diesel Affiliate will not be able to process your request.\n\nb. After-sales services\n\nDiesel Affiliate may collect your Biographical Data and Contact Data to process specific requests that you may formulate in the shop, during post-sales; for example, to arrange a repair, a customization, a home delivery or to manage a return.\n\nLegal basis: this processing is based on the performance of a contract of which you are a part; the provision of the Personal Data listed above is necessary for this purpose, since otherwise Diesel Affiliate will not be able to process your request.\n\nc. Contact management – re-contacting the customer\n\nDiesel Affiliate may need to use your Biographical Data and Contact Data in order to re-contact you in the post-sales process if necessary (by way of example but not limited to, re-contact may be required to deal with forgotten items in the shop, to return lost items etc.).\n\nthis processing is based on the legitimate interest of Diesel Affiliate in the pursuit of improving its performance and its relationship with the clients.\n\n3.4 PURPOSES OF ALL DATA CONTROLLERS OR JOINT CONTROLLERS\n\nFinally, each Data Controller or Join Controller may need to comply with a specific legal provision to which it is subject or to defend its own right in court.\n\na. Purposes related to the obligations established by laws or regulations, by decisions/requests of competent authorities or by supervisory and control bodies\n\nEach Data Controller or Joint Controller may process your Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation to which it is subject.\n\nLegal basis: compliance with a legal obligation.\n\nThe provision of data for this purpose is mandatory because in the absence of data the Data Controller or the Joint Controller will not be in a position to comply with their legal obligations.\n\nb. Defense of rights during judicial, administrative or extra-judicial proceedings and in disputes arising in connection with the services offered Your Personal Data may be processed by each Data Controller or Joint Controller to defend their rights or take legal action or make claims against you or third parties, including the prevention of frauds.\n\nLegal basis: this processing is based on the legitimate interest pursued by the Data Controller or Joint Controller to protect their rights.\n\n4.

It is possible to browse the Site without having to actively communicate your Personal Data if you are not logged in. In this case, while browsing the Site, we inform you that the computer systems and software procedures used to operate the Site acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.\n\nThis is information that is not directly associated with identified users, but which by its very nature could, through processing and association with data held by third parties, allow these users to be identified.\n\nThis category of data includes the IP addresses or domain names of the computers used by users who connect to the Site, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) notation of the requested resources, information regarding access, information regarding location , the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the response given by the server (successful, error, etc.), the information regarding the user’s visit including data clickstream of the URL, within and from the Site, the duration of the visit on some pages and the interaction on these pages and other parameters relating to the operating system and the user’s IT environment.\n\nThese data are collected through the use of “cookies”. We specifically use browser cookies for various purposes, including cookies strictly necessary for the operation of the Site and the use of services through the appropriate features, and the cookies that are used for personalization, performance/analysis and promotional activities.

WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA\n\nSome Personal Data that we will indicate you from time to time during the registration or purchase process are necessary for the completion of the purchase contract and for administrative and accounting purposes.\n\nIn the description of the purposes in paragraph 3, we have specified when it is necessary to provide Personal Data. Where not expressly indicated as mandatory, therefore, the provision of Personal Data is optional and there will be no consequences if you do not provide them, if not the impossibility for the Data Controllers or Joint Controllers to act as described (for example, the impossibility to carry out marketing activities).\n\n6. HOW AND HOW LONG WE WILL PROCESS PERSONAL DATA\n\nThe Personal Data provided to and/or collected by the Data Controllers or the Joint Controllers are processed and stored with automated tools and, in some cases, may be processed and stored on a paper backing. In particular, the Personal Data processed for purposes of marketing and of customer profiling will be entered and stored in the CRM systems that allow the processing of Personal Data for these purposes.\n\nThe Personal Data will be stored for the time necessary to achieve the purposes for which they were collected. In particular, the following rules will apply:\n\ndata collected to enter into and perform purchase contracts, including payments: up to the conclusion of administrative and accounting obligations. The billing data will be kept for 7 years from the billing date;\n\ndata of the registered user for joining the loyalty program: the data will be kept as long as the account is active. Even after the termination of the account, we will retain the data if this will be necessary to comply with legal obligations, to protect our rights or to prevent fraud;\n\ndata related to data subjects’ requests: the data will be stored until the request is satisfied;\n\ndata collected and processed for customer satisfaction will be retained for 30 days;\n\nif you have provided your consent, the data processed for purposes of marketing and customer profiling will be stored for a period of 7 years.

WHERE PERSONAL DATA MAY BE TRANSFERRED\n\nFor the purposes indicated above, we may also transfer your Personal Data to third countries, not belonging to the European Union, which may possibly do not guarantee the same level of protection. The transfer to third countries will always take place in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR, adopting any other measures necessary to ensure the security of the personal data being transferred.
