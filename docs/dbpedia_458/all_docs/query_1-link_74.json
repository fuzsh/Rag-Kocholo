        "text": "El Born Identity\n\nIf La Rambla and the Gothic Quarter, with their high tourist traffic and petty peddlers, proved a bit too circus-like for your refined tastes then you might find what you’re looking for in the district of El Born instead.\n\nThis delightful corner of Barcelona has all the beauty of the Barri Gotic, with those characteristic narrow streets and quaint cafe-covered squares, but is just far enough removed from the beaten track to maintain a little more calm, charm and dignity.\n\nThis delightful corner of Barcelona has all the beauty of the Barri Gotic… but is just far enough removed from the beaten track to maintain a little more calm, charm and dignity.\n\nDespite popular tourist attractions like the Picasso Museum and Ciutadella Park (which is also home to the city’s zoo), the area has maintained a high degree of local life.\n\nThe heart of the district is undoubtedly the picturesque Passeig del Born ‘square’ (in fact it’s an oblong). Once the site of medieval jousting competitions, nowadays this tree-lined street is a nightlife hub that comes alive with hip 20-something locals from the early evening onwards eating crepes, nibbling on tapas and imbibing beers and cocktails in the area’s abundance of natty little bars.\n\nOn warm nights many folk will purchase cans of beer from plastic-bag wielding Pakistanis and drink for cheap on the benches and pavement, giving the place a Bohemian and laidback street party vibe.\n\nAt one end of the Passeig del Born (known as the Paseo del Born in Spanish) rises the district’s most famous building, the wonderful Santa Maria del Mar church, instantly recognisable by its octagonal towers and large rose-shaped stained glass window.\n\nAt the foot of this Gothic great you’ll find a smaller square, offering one of the most picturesque places to lunch al fresco in the whole of Barcelona… if you can grab a seat at the in-demand cafes.\n\nTop 10 Things To See & Do\n\nPart I: Unmissable Attractions\n\nLet’s start with five sights you really should see if you’re staying in the neighbourhood!\n\n1. Picasso Museum\n\nBarcelona second most popular museum (first prize goes to Messi and chums, who else?), this homage to Picasso’s time in the Catalan capital has over 3,500 of the artist’s works on display, with a strong focus on his earlier styles (like the Blue and Rose periods), revealing sides to his personality that many won’t be familiar with. Remaining in exile during the Franco years, Picasso considered Barcelona his home and to understand a bit more about his relationship with the city I’d recommend going on this highly-rated tour that is actually run by the Barcelona Tourism Board, and available to book via Get Your Guide. The tour also includes tickets to the museum.\n\nBook Picasso Tour\n\n2. Palau de la Musica Catalana\n\n99.9% of people haven’t heard of the Domenech i Montaner on arriving in Barcelona. Most still haven’t by the time they’ve left. Which is a damn shame, because he’s responsible for some of the city’s most stunning architecture, including this red brick beauty – a paragon of Modernisme – that still functions as a concert hall today. Book a tour via Get Your Guide, or else buy tickets for a classical concert at night, but don’t miss the inverted glass dome in the auditorium’s interior.\n\nBook Guided Tour\n\n3. Parc de la Ciutadella\n\nThe city’s largest downtown park is a meeting point for all types of outdoor activities, and on a sunny day pretty much every patch of grass will be taken up by pic-nickers, yogis, crossfitters, slackliners, musicians and weed-smokers. Tourists tend to prefer to pass through than stay, and there’s plenty of monuments to enjoy on a stroll, as well as a boating lake. There’s also a sizeable zoo, running the along two sides of the park, and if your fancy seeing the lions, elephants and dolphins then reserve your tickets via Get Your Guide.\n\nReserve Zoo Tickets\n\n4. Santa Maria del Mar\n\nAfter Gaudi’s La Sagrada Familia and the city’s towering Gothic Cathedral, this might just be Barcelona’s third most iconic church. Said to be the only pure example remaining of the Catalan Gothic style, Santa Maria del Mar (St. Mary’s of the Sea) is an imposingly squat place of worship, with a gorgeous rose window framed by twin octagonal towers. Inside see if you can catch a glimpse of the FC Barça coat of arms amongst the stain glass decorations. Do bear in mind though that the church is an active place of worship, so you need to visit when mass is not being served if you want to nosey inside.\n\n5. Born Cultural Centre\n\nOnce Barcelona’s biggest food market – El Mercat del Born – this space was intended to be reborn (pun intended) as a library, however during renovations archaeological remains from the 1700s were discovered, so the decision was made to create a cultural centre around these discoveries instead. You can wander in and see the centuries-old pavings and walls for free (don’t get too excited!), but probably better to go “all in” and take the tour (tickets €6) of the exhibition halls that surround the ruins and give context to those times.\n\nPart II: Hidden Gems\n\nOther than the joys of medieval architecture, and the aforementioned Picasso Museum, El Born is characterised by its rare and unusual treasures. This fashionable district is the place where you’ll chance upon innovative boutique shops selling recycled bags, or discover the joys of Lomo photography. Keep reading for more…\n\n6. Chocolate Museum\n\nIf you’re planning on winning a popularity contest with your kids, then a visit to Barcelona’s Chocolate Museum will increase your chances several fold. The chocolate trade has played an important part in the history of the city, and as well as learning all about that, you can admire plenty of fun statues fashioned from cocoa mass. The edible ticket is a nice touch.\n\nBook Guided Tour\n\n7. Pinzat\n\nRecycling is big in Barcelona, and the creative minds behind Pinzat have managed to refashion old PVC posters, tyres and seatbelts into trendy bags and fashion accessories. Most are then handpainted with an original design by Barcelona locals. Definitely one of the cooler souvenirs that you could take home with you.\n\n8. MEAM\n\nThe European Museum of Modern Art often goes overlooked, eclipsed as it is by the neighbouring Picasso Musuem. Which is ironic as their mission is to lift up the artists who might not get noticed, or commercially bankrolled, in the way that Picasso did during his extraordinary career. Whether its naked ladies in front of space satellites or the photographic qualities of contemporary Japan realism, you’ll find plenty of thought-provoking material to ponder over.\n\n9. Lomography Store\n\nNostalgia lovers shouldn’t miss this funky store that takes us back to the endearingly unpredictable era of analogue photography, when shutter-depression was limited to 24 clicks per roll, and you had to wait a week (and pay) for your photos to be developed. Only to discover the lens was dirty all along. Despite the obvious benefits of digital photography, there’s no doubt some romance has been lost along the way, so consider picking up a “Diana’ camera and rediscovered it for yourself.\n\n10. The House of Silk\n\nThis former home of the influential Silk Merchants’ Guild has been lovingly preserved to reflect the baroque splendour of its 18th century heyday. You can get a taste of those opulent times on a weekly guided tour every Saturday at 11am, tickets €10, that reveals the guild hall, president’s office, library and chapel. Find it near the Palau de la Musica.\n\nBook Guided Tour\n\nThe 6 Best Hotels in Born\n\nAnd now for the all important question… who has the plumpest pillows in the barrio? There are no 5-star hotels in Born, but there are several luxury and boutique 4-star options, so let’s start with those…\n\nThe Best 4-Star Hotels\n\n1. K&K Picasso\n\nSo nice I put my parents up here when they came to stay recently, and they were not disappointed. The rooms are small but comfortable, with every mod-con you might need, but two things stand out. The first is the location, on the edge of the medieval part of Born, right next to the Parc de la Ciutadella. This is perfect in terms of being very central to everything you need in the city (attractions, beach, metro!), but also having plenty of space and greenery nearby. The second is the rooftop swimming pool with views over the aforementioned park.\n\nBook the K&K Picasso\n\n2. H10 Port Vell\n\nH10 are a famous brand of hotels in Spain, so you’re in safe hands here. This modern accommodation in a historic edifice overlooks the Old Port, and when you stay here you’re half way to the beach already! Also boasts a rooftop swimming pool.\n\nBook the H10 Port Vell\n\n3. Mercer House Boria BCN\n\nThis is a charming and chic boutique hotel situated on the lively Boria street, a perfect location for exploring not only Born, but also the neighbouring Gothic Quarter. The building’s Gothic and neoclassical features mean that it’s a listed historic building, whilst each of the rooms has been decorated elegantly, without being showy. You get a great view of the Gothic Cathedral from the hotel’s rooftop terrace.\n\nBook the Mercer Boria BCN\n\nThe Best 3-Star Hotels\n\n4. Hotel Banys Oriental\n\nI’ve always been charmed by the elegant painted green exterior of this boutique hotel on Born’s vibrant Carrer Argenteria. Definitely one of the most stylish stays in the neighbourhood, inside and out, the hotel also has a superior restaurant, Senyor Parellada.\n\nBook the Hotel Banys Oriental\n\n5. Park Hotel\n\nOpposite the elegant Estacio de Franca train station, just by the park, this is an extremely comfortable 3-star hotel, with a smooth lobby and room decor, streetside tapas restaurant and a small rooftop swimming pool to boot.\n\nBook the Park Hotel\n\nThe Best Budget Hotels\n\n6. Chic & Basic Zoo\n\nA great option for anyone who wants to save their yoyos (euros!), for some of the more fun things to do around town, Chic & Basic has everything you need for a great stay, and all at a friendly price. Tastes very, but to my eyes it’s actually more stylish than many luxury hotels. There’s no compromise on location, which is unbeatable.\n\nBook Chic & Basic Zoo\n\nFor even more options check out the full gamut of accommodation available on Booking.com."
