        "text": "To celebrate the beginning of our 15-year anniversary, we present our Because There Is No Planet B® manifesto as a call to action to regenerate our planet.\n\nAs part of the 15-year anniversary, Ecoalf & Istituto Marangoni join forces with a Because There Is No Planet B® limited edition bag to enhance creativity and sustainability through a global contest across all IM students & alumni.\n\nOur first store made in honor of the fishermen who are cleaning the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nCollaborating with Nagami design studio, we used the latest 3D technology to recycle 3.3 tonnes of plastic while raising awareness of the melting of our poles.\n\nWe opened our first Net-Zero store in December 2022 in collaboration with Lorenzo Castillo and MVN architects as part of our commitment to reach zero emissions by 2030.\n\nIn 2022, we published our first Sustainability Report on to be completely transparent about everything that we do and how we do it.\n\nIn July 2022, Ecoalf was officially recognized as one of B Corp’s “Best for the World”, positioning the brand in the top 5% of the 5,000 B Corps across the globe in the environment category.\n\nAt Ecoalf we say we care about the planet we are going to leave our children when we should care about the children we are going to leave to the planet... More than 1,000 educational talks in schools, universities, forums and summits to empower and inspire them to change the world.\n\nAfter 12 years of research and development in recycled fabrics, ECOALF launches a timeless, sustainable, premium line: ECOALF 1.0. The line merges minimalist forms and neutral colours with technical, low-impact filaments that have the lowest environmental impact on the market.\n\nBECAUSE THERE IS NO PLANET B® has reached millions around the world. This brand shares each individual's commitment and inspires others to be part of the change. For every purchase that features this claim there is a 10% donation to the Ecoalf Foundation to continue to expand the Upcycling the Oceans project. #BecauseThereIsNoPlanetB\n\n#BecauseThereIsNoPlanetB\n\nThe Ecoalf Foundation is replicating the Upcycling the Oceans project across the Mediterranean Sea: currently expanded into Italy and Greece. Today, Upcycling the Oceans continues through Spain, Greece, Italy and Thailand with the support of more than 3,000 fishermen, taking more than 700 tonnes of waste from the bottom of the ocean. The mission is to collaborate with 10,00 and clean the bottom of the Med by 2025.\n\nIn 2020, The Schwab Foundation awarded Javier Goyeneche the Social Innovator of the Year award. As recognition of the company’s revolution to changing the fashion industry for good one bottle at a time.\n\nEcoalf opened up its first store in east Asia located within Tokyo Japan. Designed by Japanese architect Yohei Sakamaki, the store features several natural and recycled materials such as bamboo, stone, sand and wood, and is split into different areas including a second floor dedicated to education events and talks.\n\nEcoalf became the first fashion company from Spain to receive a certificate as a B Corporation. The B - CORP certificate identifies that the company meets the highest standard of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and the purpose the company was built for. Recognized as the best companies for the world.\n\nIn 2017 Upcycling Oceans was replicated in Thailand with the support of the Ministry of Tourism of Thailand and PTT Global Chemical to replicate Upcycling the Oceans in Southeast Thailand. A three-year commitment to clean 5 islands: Bangkok, Phuket, Rayong, Koh Tao, Koh Samui.\n\nThe Ecoalf foundation was born to support the most revolutionary project: ‘Upcycling the Oceans’.
