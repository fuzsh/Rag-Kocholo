        "text": "THE BUZZ ABOUT BALTIMORE\n\nWhat draws so many people to Baltimore? Perhaps it's the top places to visit in Baltimore the world-famous and historic inner harbor which boasts tall ships and reveals the city's maritime legacy. Or maybe it's the star-shaped Fort McHenry, the birthplace of America's \"Star-Spangled Banner\" anthem. Or maybe it's the world-renowned museums, award-winning restaurants or jazz music scene. Not to mention, the city is a gateway to everywhere from the Northeast and Canada, to the exotic Caribbean islands and Bermuda. Celebrate sports at the Babe Ruth Birthplace Museum, view world's largest collection of art by Henri Matisse at the Baltimore Museum of Art or gaze at the 55 centuries worth of art within the walls of The Walters Art Museum. Whatever you choose to experience during your cruise from Baltimore, you'll surely come to understand why so many return to Charm City."
