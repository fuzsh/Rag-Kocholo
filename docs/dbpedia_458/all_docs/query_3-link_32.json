Your law school must certify that you meet the law study requirement by submitting proof directly to our office. Texas law schools will typically verify their students’ status before we issue admission tickets. You should remain in contact with your law school to ensure that your law school will be able to submit this certification to the Board by the appropriate time in order for you to be eligible to receive an admission ticket for the exam that you applied for.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nHow do I request accommodations on the Texas Bar Exam?\n\nStart here: How to Request Accommodations on the Texas Bar Exam\n\nBack to TOP\n\nHow will I know at which exam site I will be taking the Texas Bar Examination?\n\nThere is a good chance you will be assigned to your first choice of exam site; however, you may be moved to another site.

You may submit the signed request by mail, fax, or email. See Contact Us for addresses and numbers.\n\nTo request us to mail an official MBE score to another jurisdiction, please complete the online request at https://ble.texas.gov/displaymbetransferform.action. There is a fee for this service.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nCan I take the Texas Bar Exam (UBE) if I will only use my score to get licensed in another UBE jurisdiction?\n\nYes, you can apply for a Courtesy Seat if you want to take the Texas Bar Exam (UBE) for the sole purpose of using the score to get licensed in another UBE jurisdiction. It is up to you to determine whether that other jurisdiction will accept a score earned as a Courtesy Seat examinee in Texas, what you need to file with that jurisdiction, and when you need to file it there.\n\nIf you want to get admitted to Texas, do not apply for a Courtesy Seat. Instead, submit a Bar Exam application.\n\nTo apply for a Courtesy Seat:\n\nClick here for information on how to submit an application through ATLAS, and for answers to other frequently asked questions about ATLAS.\n\nThe fee is $300, plus any applicable laptop fees and late fees. All bar exam filing deadlines and late fees apply.\n\nPlease note that Courtesy Seats are for those seeking admission outside Texas only. If you want to get admitted to Texas, do not apply for a Courtesy Seat. Instead, submit a Bar Exam application. UBE scores earned through Courtesy Seats in Texas cannot necessarily then be transferred to Texas. If you were to seek admission to Texas based on a UBE score you earned through a Courtesy Seat in Texas, you would have to submit and pay for a UBE Transfer Application (not a re-application) and request a waiver of Rule 13 section 1, which provides for admission by transfer of a UBE score earned in another State and does not provide for admission by transfer of a UBE score earned in Texas. The burden would be yours to show good cause for waiving the Rule in your case. Our investigation of your character and fitness would not begin unless and until the waiver is granted--the investigation could take up to 9 months and may include inquiries into why you applied for a Courtesy Seat in the first place.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nAdmission by UBE Transfer (UBET)\n\nI have a UBE score. How do I transfer it to Texas? (Updated to reflect 2/15/22 amendment)\n\nYou may submit a UBE Transfer Application to transfer a qualifying UBE score to Texas.\n\nA qualifying UBE score is a score that is 270 or higher and that was earned within the five years immediately preceding the filing of the Application. (Per Rule 13 §1 as amended 2/15/22.)\n\nA UBE score is “earned” on the last day of the exam administration.\n\nScores that were earned more than five years ago cannot be transferred.\n\nIn addition to submitting a UBE Transfer Application to us, you must also contact the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE), and request that they transfer your score to us. http://www.ncbex.org/ncbe-exam-score-services/ube-score-services/\n\nOnce you submit your UBE Transfer Application, we will conduct a character and fitness investigation. This investigation can take up to nine months.\n\nIn addition to submitting a UBE Transfer Application to transfer a qualifying UBE score, you will need to satisfy all other licensing requirements set out in Rule 2, including requirements to:\n\nHave a J.D. from an ABA-approved law school, or satisfy each element of an exception in Rule 13.\n\nSatisfy the Texas Law Component by completing the Texas Law Course (TLC).\n\nDocument a score of 85 or higher on the MPRE.\n\nFor instructions on submitting the application, see How do I submit an application in ATLAS?\n\nBack to TOP\n\nIn the past, I applied to transfer a UBE score but my application was rejected. After Rule 13 §1 was amended on 2/15/2022, my UBE score qualifies for transfer. How do I re-apply? (Added 2/17/22.)\n\nOn February 15, 2022, the Supreme Court of Texas amended Rule 13 §1 of the Rules Governing Admission to the Bar of Texas. Now, a UBE score of 270 qualifies for transfer to Texas--without any practice time requirement--if the score was earned within the 5 years immediately preceding the filing of your most recent UBE Transfer Application or Re-application.\n\nIf you submitted a UBE transfer application in the past and were rejected for lack of practice time, you can re-apply if your UBE score is 270 or higher and was earned within the last 5 years. To re-apply for admission by UBE transfer, see How do I submit an application in ATLAS?\n\nBack to TOP\n\nDo you have a checklist to help tell me what documents are required for my application?\n\nYes: checklists section of our FAQs.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nWho do I contact to have my UBE score reported to Texas?\n\nIn addition to submitting a UBE Transfer Application to us, you must also contact the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE), and request that they transfer your score to us. http://www.ncbex.org/ncbe-exam-score-services/ube-score-services/\n\nBack to TOP\n\nWhat are the fees for applying for admission to the Texas bar with a transferred UBE score?\n\nTexas Law Student (must file a Declaration of Intent to Study Law first)\n\n$150 Application Fee\n\n95 UBE Transfer Fee\n\n55 Investigation Fee\n\n$300 Total\n\nOut-of-State Law Student\n\n$150 Application Fee\n\n40 Fingerprint Card Processing Fee\n\n150 UBE Transfer Fee\n\n150 Investigation Fee\n\n$490 Total\n\nAttorney with JD from ABA-approved Law School, and\n\nAttorney Applying Under Rule 13 §3\n\n$700 Application Fee\n\n40 Fingerprint Card Processing Fee\n\n150 UBE Transfer Fee\n\n150 Investigation Fee\n\n$1040 Total\n\nForeign-Trained Attorney\n\n$700 Application Fee\n\n40 Fingerprint Card Processing Fee\n\n150 UBE Transfer Fee\n\n150 Investigation Fee\n\n100 Foreign Nation Inquiry Fee\n\n$1140 Total\n\nRe-Application for Admission By UBE Transfer\n\n$225 Application Fee & Investigation Fee\n\n75 UBE Transfer Fee\n\n$320 Total\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI took an October 2020 exam in a UBE jurisdiction. Can I transfer that score to Texas?\n\nOn August 24, the Board approved a proposal to accept a score of 270 or higher earned on the October 5-6, 2020 remote bar examination administered by the following Uniform Bar Examination jurisdictions as satisfaction of the UBE score requirement for admission under Rule 13 §1: the District of Columbia, Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, and Vermont.\n\nApplicants must complete and submit a UBE Transfer application to our office.\n\nApplicants transferring a score from Connecticut, Kentucky, Maryland, New York, or Tennessee, your jurisdiction has likely already provided your score to us. You do not need to request that your score be transferred again from these jurisdictions. If we have not received your score, your licensure analyst will notify you via your ATLAS account.\n\nApplicants transferring a score from District of Columbia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, or Vermont, your jurisdiction send scores to us upon your request. The score must be sent to us directly from the jurisdiction. The jurisdiction can email information@ble.texas.gov. The jurisdiction's certification of your October 2020 remote exam must include your full name, NCBE number, and scaled score.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI sat for the UBE in Texas. How do I transfer my UBE score to another jurisdiction?\n\nIn order to transfer the UBE score you earned in Texas to another jurisdiction, you must submit a request to NCBE - UBE Score Services (https://www.ncbex.org/score-services/ube-score-services).\n\nThe minimum passing UBE scores by jurisdiction can be found here: https://www.ncbex.org/exams/ube/ube-minimum-scores\n\nThe maximum age of transferred UBE scores by jurisdiction can be found here: https://www.ncbex.org/exams/ube/ube-maximum-score-age\n\nBack to TOP\n\nAdmission Without Examination (AWOX)\n\nHow do I apply for Admission Without Examination (AWOX)?\n\nYou may qualify for admission to the Texas bar without taking the Texas bar exam or transferring a UBE score if:\n\nYou are currently authorized to practice law in a US state; and\n\nYou satisfy the educational requirements for admission to the Texas Bar (see Rule 2); and\n\nYou have been actively and substantially engaged in the lawful practice of law as your primary business or occupation for at least 5 of the last 7 years.\n\nTo submit an AWOX application, see How do I submit an application in ATLAS?\n\nBack to TOP\n\nDo you have a checklist to help tell me what documents are required for my application?\n\nYes: checklists section of our FAQs.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nWhat activities count as being actively and substantially engaged in the lawful practice of law?\n\nSee our FAQs for Practice Time Requirements.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nWhat documentation is required to substantiate my active and substantial practice of law for Rule 13 admission?\n\nSee our FAQs for Practice Time Requirements.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI am applying for AWOX. Do I need to file my application according to the deadlines provided in Rule 9?\n\nNo. There are no filing deadlines for AWOX applications, so you may sumbit your AWOX application at any time. But submitting an AWOX application around January 30 or October 30 may result in a slower processing time--we receive a large number of bar exam applications around these two days.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI am a self-employed attorney. The Employment History section asks for a verifying reference. Who is an acceptable self-employment reference?\n\nExamples of acceptable references include your accountant, your landlord if you have office space, an attorney with whom you work closely, or a judge. Do not list yourself, a relative, or anyone else with a vested interest in the licensure determination.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nHow long does the AWOX process take?\n\nGenerally, it takes approximately 6 to 9 months from the date your application is received in our office to complete the process; however, it could take more or less time depending on the particular application. It is helpful for you to provide all required documentation when you submit your application and to ensure that your employment references will respond promptly to any written inquiries from the Board, which will be sent after we begin processing your application.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI am employed as an attorney in Texas, but I am not licensed to practice law in Texas. Can my employment be counted toward the AWOX practice time requirement?\n\nPlease refer to the Policy Statement on Practice Requirements for Rule 13, which you can view here: Ancillary Forms & Information. We cannot provide advisory opinions without a properly-filed application.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI no longer have a copy of 1 or more years of my tax returns that are required to be submitted with my AWOX application, how can I obtain a copy of my return/s?\n\nYou can request transcripts of previous returns from the IRS using the 4506-T form. Be sure to request return transcripts. Copies are generally available for the current and past six years. You may also be able to obtain tax documentation from your employer(s) or your accountant.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nHow do I provide proof of my scaled score of 85 or higher on the MPRE?\n\nIf you took the MPRE after 1998, you will contact the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE) and request that an official score report be sent directly to our office. Be sure to select “Texas” when completing your score report request.\n\nIf you took the MPRE in 1998 or earlier and the NCBE is unable to provide an official score report, submit a request to the jurisdiction where you are licensed to practice law for a letter, on their letterhead, containing the date you took the MPRE and the scaled score you received. This letter must be sent directly to our office from that jurisdiction. If you are unable to obtain such information, contact your Licensure Analyst. It is possible that you will have to retake the MPRE.\n\nIf you were licensed without being required to take the MPRE, see Waiver Requests-Guidelines and Instructions. Back to TOP\n\nHow do I provide proof of my J.D. degree?\n\nComplete the top portion of a JD Certification Form, and send it to your law school. Your law school should complete the rest of the form and send it directly to us. The JD Certification Form automatically loads to your ATLAS home page after you submit an AWOX application. You can also find a blank form at Ancillary Forms & Information.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI previously failed the Texas Bar Examination, but have since been licensed in another jurisdiction. Can I apply for AWOX?\n\nYes. As of December 1, 2019, failing a Texas Bar Exam is no longer a barrier to being eligible for Admission Without Examination.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nMy employer does not have an official job description. What documentation should I provide in lieu of this?\n\nYou may submit a letter, on official letterhead and signed by a managing partner or the head of HR/personnel, detailing your job duties and dates of employment.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nCan I submit an AWOX application before I have satisfied the 5-year practice requirement?\n\nDo not file an application for AWOX until you have been licensed and actively and substantially practicing as an attorney for at least 5 years. Please note that under Rule 13, we look back 7 years from the date we receive your application. For example, if we receive your application on January 1, 2014, your eligibility window would be from January 1, 2007, to January 1, 2014--you woud have to establish 5 years of practice during that 7-year window. By Rule, we cannot consider employment that takes place after you submit your application.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI am unsure whether I qualify for AWOX. Can I call and ask whether I am eligible to file?\n\nThe Board cannot provide advisory opinions as to a potential applicant’s eligibility without a properly-filed application. Therefore, it is to your advantage to ensure that you have thoroughly read Rule 13 and obtained all required documentation before filing an application.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nATLAS\n\nWhat is ATLAS?\n\nATLAS is the Board of Law Examiners’ new website and portal. ATLAS allows applicants to submit applications online, pay fees online, upload required documents, amend applications online, and update personal and contact information online.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nHow do I create an ATLAS account?\n\nGo here: Create an ATLAS account.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nHow do I submit an application in ATLAS?\n\nCreate an ATLAS account, if you have not already done so.\n\nLog in to your ATLAS account and go to your ATLAS User Home page.\n\nClick the green Start New Application button.\n\nFind the appropriate application and click the Apply button.\n\nCarefully and correctly answer the registration questions so that you will be directed to the correct application.

(Texas law students only.)\n\nIf you miss the timely filing deadline, which occurs during your first year of law school, you may file your Declaration separately anytime thereafter, or you may wait and file your Declaration concurrently with your In-State Application. Please note that a late filing fee applies in either case.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI am completing an In-State Law Student Application. Do I have to list information that was previously provided in the Employment or Character & Fitness sections on my Declaration? (Texas law students only.)\n\nNo. The In-State Application is meant to update the Board with any new/additional information that occurs after you file your Declaration (employment, criminal history, school discipline, etc.). If you are filing your Declaration and In-State Application concurrently, you do not need to re-list all employment and character and fitness information (that you listed on your Declaration) on your In-State Application. You do not need to make duplicative disclosures.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nDo you have a checklist to help tell me what documents are required for my application?\n\nYes: checklists section of our FAQs.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nWhat documentation is accepted as proof of my citizenship status, USCIS status, or other compliance with Rule 2(a)(5)?\n\nSee Rule 2(a)(5).\n\nBack to TOP\n\nHow do I obtain a certified birth certificate?\n\nIf you were born in Texas, you can contact the Bureau of Vital Statistics. If you were born in another U.S. state, you may contact the Bureau of Vital Statistics in the state where you were born. Certified birth certificates may also be obtained online through www.vitalchek.com.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nMay I use law professors as a reference in the Attorney References section of my Declaration?\n\nYes.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nHow do I provide proof of my ABA-approved J.D. degree?\n\nYou must submit the Certification of Juris Doctorate Degree form to your law school. This form automatically loads to the User Home page of your ATLAS account. You can also print a blank form from the Ancillary Forms tab. Complete the top portion of the form and forward it to your law school for completion. The dean/registrar will complete the remainder of the form and send it directly to our office.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nThe instructions state that a signed copy of my law school application is required. What does this mean?\n\nIt depends on the method by which you submitted your law school application. If you submitted your application via LSAC, you may simply print a copy from the LSAC website. The fact that it was submitted electronically through LSAC is sufficient for the “signature”. If you submitted your application by mail, you would need to provide a copy of the signed application that you submitted to your law school. Contact the registrar’s office if you did not retain a copy for your records. If you submitted any addendums with your law school application explaining and criminal history or undergraduate discipline you received, make sure you also submit these addendums to the Board.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nHow do I respond on the employment history section of Board forms if:\n\na. an employer is no longer in business?\n\nYou should enter \"No longer in business\" on the line for \"Name of Supervisor\", instead of entering the name of your supervisor.\n\nb. my immediate supervisor is no longer employed by an employer?\n\nYou have a choice. Either enter the name of another supervisor who is still employed by the employer who would be able to respond to an inquiry from the staff of the Board as to your honesty, etc; or, enter the current address for your former supervisor, wherever that person is now.\n\nc. I cannot locate any documentation that indicates the exact dates that I was employed?\n\nEnter approximate dates, but indicate that they are approximate.\n\nd. I was employed in a non-paid, intern-type position?\n\nThe staff of the Board will elicit responses as to your honesty, etc., so the fact that you were not paid is not important. You should list such employment situations.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nDo offenses that are the subject to orders of non-disclosure need to be revealed?\n\nPursuant to Tex. Gov't Code §552.142(b), if you have criminal matters that are the subject of an order of non-disclosure, you are not required to reveal those criminal matters on the Declaration/Application form. However, a criminal matter that is the subject of an order of non-disclosure may become a character and fitness issue. Pursuant to other sections of the Government Code [411.081(d), 411.081(i)(5), 411.083(b), 411.084(a), 411.087(a), and 411.100], the Texas Board of Law Examiners is entitled to access criminal history record information that is the subject of an order of non-disclosure. So, if we discover a criminal matter that is the subject of an order of non-disclosure, even if you properly did not reveal that matter, we may ask you to provide information about that criminal matter.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nMy Licensure Analyst instructed me to redact my BLE application or my law school application to remove sealed/expunged criminal history. How do I do this?\n\n1. What does redacting mean?\n\na. In general, redacting means removing sensitive information from a document.\n\nb. Specifically, you must not disclose criminal offenses that were expunged pursuant to Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Art. 55.02, or pursuant to another state’s statute with the same force and effect. If you disclose an expunged offense, you will be instructed to amend your BLE application and redact and re-upload your law school application to remove the offense.\n\n2. How do I amend my BLE application?\n\na. Follow the instructions here: https://ble.texas.gov/faq.action#561\n\n3. How do I redact my law school application?\n\na. The easiest way to redact a file is to use the “Redact” tool in Abode Acrobat. Instructions are here: https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/removing-sensitive-content-pdfs.html\n\nb. You may also print your law school application and use a thick black marker to physically mark out the required parts.\n\n4. Do I redact the “Yes” or “No” answer to the criminal history question, the attachment explaining my “Yes” answer, or both?\n\na. Do not redact the “Yes” or “No” answer to the initial criminal history question.\n\nb. Do redact the parts of the explanatory attachment referring to expunged criminal history. Do not redact the parts of the explanatory attachment referring to criminal history that is not expunged, or parts referring to school discipline – even if that school discipline is related to the expunged criminal history.\n\n5. What if I received school discipline for the same incident as the sealed/expunged criminal history?\n\na. While you must not disclose the expunged criminal history, you are required to disclose the school discipline. An expungement for a criminal offense does not expunge school disciplinary records. Your disclosure of your school discipline must not contain any reference to the expunged criminal history.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI’m completing Criminal History or Civil Litigation questions. What is a \"cause number\"? What does \"style\" mean?\n\nThe cause number is the number under which a case is filed (i.e., 2009-TR-21221). The style is the name of the case (i.e., State of Texas vs. John Doe). If you do not know this information, please write “unknown”.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nHow do I obtain court records or arrest/offense/incident reports for criminal history disclosure?\n\nYou are required to provide legible copies of the arrest/offense/incident report as well as all court records for any criminal matter that occurred within 5 years of the date you complete your Declaration or Application. Submit a signed written request to the appropriate court of record and arresting agency (i.e., police department or sheriff’s office) and upload a copy of each request to your ATLAS account. This will serve as proof that you are making a good faith effort to obtain the required documentation. Upload the records to your ATLAS account when you receive them.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI received a letter from my Licensure Analyst instructing me to update my law school application and to provide a copy of the school’s disposition to my update. How do I comply with this by the deadline given by my Analyst?\n\nYou must submit a letter to your law school updating your application with the new information (for example, a criminal offense that occurred after you submitted your application to law school). You must include a copy of the letter from your Licensure Analyst when you submit your update letter to your law school. Upload a copy of your update letter, as well as a cover letter explaining why you did not timely update your law school with this information, to your ATLAS account by the due date on the letter from your Licensure Analyst. Your law school will eventually issue a disposition (response) as a result of your update. Upload this as soon as you receive it. We must receive something in writing from your law school even if only to confirm that no action will be taken. The due date does not apply to the disposition; this can be submitted at a later date.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nThe 30-day grace period to provide outstanding third-party documentation to supplement my application is approaching, but I have not received the requested documentation. Will my application be rejected? Will I owe any additional fees?\n\nYour application will not be rejected and you will not owe any additional fees. However, you should contact your Licensure Analyst through your ATLAS account and provide an update as to the status of the missing documentation immediately to demonstrate that you are making a good faith effort to comply.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nDoes my character and fitness investigation have to be completed before I can sit for the bar exam?\n\nYou may sit for the bar exam while your character and fitness investigation is pending, provided you have satisfied the educational requirements in Rule 2.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nWill I be notified when my character and fitness investigation has been completed?\n\nOnce we have completed our character and fitness investigation, if we approve your character and fitness, a message will appear in the Application Information box on your ATLAS User Home page:\n\nIf we cannot approve your character and fitness, we will send you an Admission Document in ATLAS with a written explanation of why, and the steps available to you.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nHow do I withdraw my Declaration or Application?\n\nLog in to your ATLAS account and click the blue \"Create Message\" button to send a message to your analyst.

What is a Foreign Legal Consultant?\n\nA Foreign Legal Consultant is a person whom the Supreme Court of Texas has certified to practice in Texas as foreign legal consultant under Rule 14. Someone holding an FLC certificate may practice the law of their home jurisdiction in Texas as allowed by that jurisdiction, partner with and share legal fees with Texas attorneys, and engage in the scope of practice in Texas detailed in Rule 14 §3.\n\nBack to TOP\n\n2. Who is eligible to be certified as an FLC in Texas?\n\nThe Rules set out two paths to being certified as an FLC in Texas.\n\nLaw office. Rule 14 §1(a) applies to those who intend to maintain an office in Texas to practice as an FLC in Texas. The requirements for this path are:\n\nBe an attorney in good standing in a foreign country for at least 3 of the 5 years immediately preceding the date of the application (see Rule 14 §(a)(1) for details); and\n\nBe at least 26 years old; and\n\nPossess the present good moral character and fitness requisite for a member of the Texas Bar.\n\nIn-house. Rule 14 §(b) applies to those who wish to practice as an FLC in-house (see Rule 14 §(b)(4) for details). The requirements for this path are:\n\nFor at least 3 of the 5 years immediately preceding the date of the application:\n\nBe authorized to practice law in a foreign jurisdiction; or\n\nBe a member in good standing of the bar of another State; or\n\nBe actively and substantially engaged in the lawful practice of law in a foreign country or another United States jurisdiction; and\n\nBe at least 26 years old; and\n\nPossess the present good moral character and fitness requisite for a member of the Texas Bar.\n\nBack to TOP\n\n3. How should FLCs hold themselves out to the public? What titles can they use?\n\nAn FLC who holds themself out as an attorney or an FLC without clarifying that they are not licensed in Texas will be presumed to be making a false or misleading communication in violation of TDRPC Rule 7.01.\n\nRule 14 §3(f). Per Rule 14 §3(f), an FLC cannot in any way hold themself out as a member of the Texas bar.\n\nTexas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct. FLCs are subject to TDRPC. TDRPC Rule 7.01(a) states:\n\nA lawyer shall not make or sponsor a false or misleading communication about the qualifications or services of a lawyer or law firm. Information about legal services must be truthful and nondeceptive. A communication is false or misleading if it contains a material misrepresentation of fact or law, or omits a fact necessary to make the statement considered as a whole not materially misleading. A statement is misleading if there is a substantial likelihood that it will lead a reasonable person to formulate a specific conclusion about the lawyer or the lawyer’s services for which there is no reasonable factual foundation, or if the statement is substantially likely to create unjustified expectations about the results the lawyer can achieve.\n\nTDRPC Rule 7.01(c) states, in part:\n\nA law firm with an office in more than one jurisdiction may use the same name or other professional designation in each jurisdiction, but identification of the lawyers in an office of the firm shall indicate the jurisdictional limitations on those not licensed to practice in the jurisdiction where the office is located.\n\nRule 14 §3(g). Per Rule 14 §3(g) an FLC can only use one or more of the following names, titles, or designations in connection with their FLC practice in Texas:\n\nThe FLC’s own name; and/or\n\nThe name of the law firm they are affiliated with; and/or\n\nThe authorized title in the foreign country where they are authorized to practice, which may be used in conjunction with the name of that country; and/or\n\nThe title “Foreign Legal Consultant,” which may be used in conjunction with the words “authorized to practice law in [name of the foreign country in which they are authorized to practice].”\n\nExamples of designations that comply with these requirements:\n\n Lee Smith, Foreign Legal Consultant (not licensed in Texas)\n\n Lee Smith, Foreign Legal Consultant, authorized to practice law in Mexico (not licensed in Texas)\n\n Lee Smith, Attorney in Mexico, Foreign Legal Consultant (not licensed in Texas)\n\nExamples of designations that do not comply with these requirements:\n\nꞳLee Smith, affiliated with the Texas Bar as a Foreign Legal Consultant\n\nꞳLee Smith, licensed as a Foreign Legal Consultant by the State Bar of Texas\n\nꞳ Lee Smith, Certified Foreign Legal Consultant\n\nꞳLee Smith, Texas Foreign Legal Consultant\n\nꞳLee Smith, Attorney\n\nꞳLee Smith, Partner\n\nꞳLee Smith, Attorney and Foreign Legal Consultant\n\nBack to TOP\n\n4. Does the Court “license” FLCs?\n\nThe Court certifies Foreign Legal Consultants; it does not “license” them.\n\nBack to TOP\n\n5. Are FLCs members of the State Bar of Texas?\n\nNo, FLCs are not members of the State Bar of Texas. Instead, they are considered to be “affiliated with” the State Bar of Texas, subject to the rights and obligations set out in Rule 14 §4 and limited to the scope of practice in §3.\n\nBack to TOP\n\n6. What can an FLC do in Texas? What can they not do?\n\nAn FLC may render legal services in Texas in the manner and to the extent permitted by the FLC’s home jurisdiction, subject to the limitations set out in Rule 14 §3.\n\nAs clearly set out in Rule 14 §3:\n\nAn FLC must not appear for another person in any court in Texas, any magistrate in Texas, or any other judicial officer in Texas.\n\nAn FLC must not prepare certain real estate instruments.\n\nAn FLC must not prepare certain wills, trusts, and instruments for estate administration.\n\nAn FLC must not render certain services related to family law.\n\nAn FLC must not render professional legal advice on the law of Texas, or of the United States (unless licensed in another State) including U.S. immigration law, except under the explicit and narrow circumstances allowed in Rule 14 §3(e)(1)-(2).\n\nAn FLC is obligated to be familiar with, understand, and abide by the scope of practice in Rule 14 §3.\n\nBack to TOP\n\n7. Can an FLC practice immigration law or provide immigration services?\n\nBeing certified as an FLC does not authorize a person to practice immigration law or provide immigration services.\n\nBack to TOP\n\n8. Can an FLC partner with a Texas lawyer? Can a Texas lawyer share legal fees with an FLC?\n\nYes. Per Rule 14 §4, an FLC has the right to partner with Texas lawyers, and Texas lawyers and FLCs may share legal fees with each other.\n\nBack to TOP\n\n9. Does an FLC have to have an active law license in another jurisdiction?\n\nProbably. Per Rule 14 §3, an FLC can only practice in Texas “in the manner and to the extent permitted by the jurisdiction in which the person is authorized to practice or, in the case of a person who satisfies the requirements of subparagraph 1(b)(1)(C), to the extent permitted by the jurisdiction in which the person has been actively and substantially engaged in the lawful practice of law.”\n\nMost jurisdictions require a lawyer to maintain an active law license in order to practice law. However, some jurisdictions require attorneys to surrender their license in order to work as in-house counsel or in the judiciary. These attorneys can still qualify to be certified as FLCs in Texas under Rule 14 §1(b)(1)(C).\n\nBack to TOP\n\n10. How do I apply to be certified as an FLC?\n\nClick here for information on how to submit an application through ATLAS, and for answers to other frequently asked questions about ATLAS.\n\nBack to TOP\n\n11. How long does an FLC certificate last?\n\nUnless revoked by the Board under Rule 14 §7, a certification to practice as a Foreign Legal Consultant is valid for one year.\n\nBack to TOP\n\n12. Do FLCs have to complete mandatory continuing legal education (MCLE)?\n\nPer Rule 14 §6(b)(3), in order to renew their certificate, FLCs must complete 3 hours of continuing legal education in ethics courses accredited by the State Bar of Texas. (Because FLCs are not members of the Bar, they are not required to completed the MCLE that members of the Bar must complete per State Bar Rule XII Section 6.)\n\nBack to TOP\n\n13. How do I timely renew my FLC certification, so that there is no gap in my certification?\n\nTo timely renew your FLC certificate, complete the required CLE and, at least 60 days before your FLC certification expires, submit a renewal application.\n\nLog in to your ATLAS account\n\nUpload proof that you completed the required CLE\n\nClick the green Start New Application button and find FLC Renewal\n\nAt least 60 days before your FLC certificate expires, complete the renewal application and use the green Submit Application button to submit it and pay the renewal fee.\n\n(Do not submit a renewal application until after you have completed your CLE. We will not consider your renewal application to be submitted or filed unless it is accompanied by proof that you have completed the required CLE. If you submit a renewal application without first uploading proof that you completed the required CLE, we may reject your application.)\n\nIf you submit a complete FLC renewal application during the timely renewal period, then, before your current FLC certificate expires:\n\nIf staff determines that you are entitled to renew, then staff will renew your certificate; or\n\nIf staff cannot make a final determination of your eligibility to renew before your current certificate expires, then we will renew your certificate but continue our investigation of your eligibility and present good moral character and fitness. Upon completion of our investigation, we will notify you of our determination. If we determine that you no longer meet the requirements for certification, we will issue you a Preliminary Determination Letter and notice of hearing. If, after notice and hearing, the Board determines that you no longer meet the requirements for certification, the Board may recommend that your FLC certificate be revoked. See Rule 15 §7.\n\nBack to TOP\n\n14. I missed the timely renewal period. Can I still renew?\n\nMaybe. From 59 days before your FLC certificate expires until up to 180 days after your FLC certificate expires, you can, upon a showing of good cause, submit a “grace period” renewal application. You will have to pay a $150 fee and a $150 late fee for total fees of $300.\n\nIf you submit a renewal application during the grace period, it is likely that we will not complete our investigation before your current certificate expires. If your current FLC certificate expires before we complete our investigation, there will be a gap in your certification—you would not be certified as an FLC from the date of the expiration of your current FLC certificate until the date of your next certificate. During this gap in certification, you would not be “affiliated with the Bar,” you would not be subject to the rights and obligations set out in Rule 14 §4, and you would not be authorized to engage in the scope of practice detailed in Rule 14 §3.\n\nIf you missed the timely renewal period and you want to renew your FLC certificate during the grace period describe above:\n\nLog in to your ATLAS account.\n\nUpload proof that you completed the required CLE.\n\nClick the green Start New Application button and find FLC Renewal.\n\nComplete the renewal application and use the green Submit Application button to submit it and pay the renewal fee.\n\nAfter you submit the renewal, we will contact you through ATLAS with instructions on how to offer good cause and pay the late fee.\n\nBack to TOP\n\n15. I missed the timely renewal period, and I also missed the grace period. Can I still renew my FLC certificate?\n\nNo. If you do not submit a renewal application within180 days after your certificate expires, you will not be able to renew.

No formal waiver request is needed--an applicant may simply message their analyst explaining which classes were offered online and why.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI received my legal education outside of the U.S. or its territories.

You may become eligible to take the Texas Bar Examination through one of four paths:\n\nPursuant to Rule 13 §4(a), demonstrate that:\n\nYou completed a course of study at a properly accredited foreign law school\n\nThe course of study was based on the principles of English common law\n\nThe course of study was substantially equivalent in duration to the legal education provided by an ABA-approved U.S. law school\n\nYou are authorized to practice law in a foreign jurisdiction or in another state; and\n\nYou have been actively and substantially engaged in the lawful practice of law for at least 3 of the 5 years immediately preceding the date of the application.\n\nPursuant to Rule 13 §4(b), demonstrate that:\n\nYou completed a course of study at a properly accredited foreign law school\n\nThe course of study was based on the principles of English common law\n\nThe course of study was at least 2 years in duration\n\nYou have an LL.M. degree that satisfies Rule 13§9\n\nPursuant to Rule 13 §4(c), demonstrate that:\n\nYou are authorized to practice law in a foreign jurisdiction whose jurisprudence is based on the principles of English common law\n\nYou have an LL.M. degree that satisfies Rule 13 §9.\n\nPursuant to Rule 13 §5, demonstrate that:\n\nYou completed a course of study at a properly accredited foreign law school\n\nThe course of study was not based on the principles of English common law\n\nThe course of study was substantially equivalent in duration to the legal education provided by an ABA-approved U.S. law school\n\nYou have an LL.M. degree that satisfies Rule 13 §9\n\nYou are authorized to practice law in a foreign jurisdiction or in another state.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nSummary of Eligibility Requirements for Foreign-Educated Applicants to take the Texas Bar Examination. Back to TOP\n\nI am licensed to practice law in a U.S. state. Can I sit for the bar exam?\n\nMaybe. Simply being licensed in another state is not enough, by itself, to make you eligible to take the bar exam. If you received your initial law degree from a foreign law school, then you can sit for the bar exam if and only if you are eligible under one of the four paths outlined above.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI am unsure whether I qualify to take the bar exam under Rule 13. Can I call and receive an opinion from Board Staff about my eligibility?\n\nThe Board cannot provide advisory opinions on a potential applicant’s eligibility without a properly-filed application. Please note that, in the event that it is determined you do not qualify, no refund of fees will be issued. Therefore, it is to your advantage to ensure that you have thoroughly reviewed Rule 13 and obtained all required documentation before filing an application.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nIn addition to passing the bar exam, what other requirements must I meet in order to be eligible to be licensed as a Texas attorney?\n\nIn order to be licensed, applicants must do the following within 5 years of passing the bar exam:\n\nBe certified by the Board as having present good moral character and fitness\n\nScore 85 or higher on the MPRE\n\nBe willing to take the Oath\n\nSatisfy the requirements of Rule 2(a)(5)\n\nBe 18 years of age\n\nComplete the Texas Law Course\n\nBack to TOP\n\nDo you have a checklist to help tell me what documents are required for my application?\n\nYes: checklists section of our FAQs.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nHow do I satisfy the requirements of Rule 2(a)(5)?\n\nSee Rule 2(a)(5).\n\nBack to TOP\n\nHow do I apply to take the bar exam as a foreign-trained applicant?\n\nClick here for information on how to submit an application through ATLAS, and for answers to other frequently asked questions about ATLAS.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nIf I am applying pursuant to Rule 13 §4(a), how must I document my active and substantial practice of law?\n\nSee our FAQs for Practice Time Requirements.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI received my initial law degree from a foreign law school, and I am licensed to practice law in another U.S. state. If I want to apply for admission to the Texas Bar, what filing fee must I submit with my application?\n\nIf you did not receive an initial law degree from a U.S. law school, then you would only be able to qualify for admission under Rule 13 §4 or Rule 13 §5, even if you are licensed in another U.S. state. If you apply for admission under 13 §4 or Rule 13 §5, then you should submit the following fees with your application (see Appendix D):\n\nForeign Nation Attorney–Texas Bar Exam Applicant only:\n\n$700-Application Fee\n\n$ 40-Fingerprint Card Processing Fee\n\n$150-Examination Fee\n\n$150-Investigation Fee\n\n$100-Foreign Nation Inquiry Fee\n\n$1,140-Total\n\n(In addition, you should submit the Laptop Application Fee and Late Filing Fee as applicable.) Back to TOP\n\nI am enrolled in an LL.M. program in a Texas law school. Do I need to file a Declaration of Intention to Study Law?\n\nNo. Only non-attorney applicants who will earn a J.D. from a Texas law school are required to file a Declaration of Intention to Study Law. (Rule 6 only applies to persons who are \"beginning\" their law study at a Texas school. Generally, LL.M. students are not \"beginning\" their law studies; instead, they are continuing their law studies.)\n\nBack to TOP\n\nHow do I take the oath if I am not in the United States?\n\nIf you are admitted to practice law in Texas, you must take an oath to support the constitutions of the United States and Texas, honestly demean yourself in the practice of law, and discharge your duty to your clients to the best of your ability. Tex. Gov’t Code §82.037.\n\nIf you are outside the United States, you can appear before one of the following officials, who can administer the oath to you and give a certificate of fact:\n\na minister, commissioner, or charge d’affaires of the United States who resides in and is accredited to the country where the oath or affidavit is made;\n\na consul-general, consul, vice-consul, commercial agent, vice-commercial agent, deputy consul, or consular agent of the United States who resides in the country where the oath or affidavit is made; or\n\na notary public.\n\nTex. Gov’t Code §602.004.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nWhen is the best time for me to file my application for a particular exam?\n\nBecause our usual investigation and verification of educational and professional credentials can sometimes be delayed when responses from institutions in foreign nations are not forthcoming or when postal service overseas is inefficient, it is prudent for 13 §4 and Rule 13 §5 applicants to file timely. Applicants assume a risk that foreign institutions may not respond to our routine inquiries in sufficient time for eligibility to be determined before the bar exam, and this can result in denial of the application. According to Rule 18(b), refunds or transfers of application fees are not authorized. Therefore, it is advisable to have the application prepared and filed before the timely deadline specified in Rule 9(a)(1) or (2) and to plan for all required documentation to be provided promptly.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nIf an LL.M. degree from an ABA-approved law school is required for my application to sit for the bar exam, can I apply while I am completing my LL.M?\n\nYes, but be aware that your law school must certify completion of your LL.M. degree directly to the Board’s office at least 3 weeks before the first day of the exam you apply for.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nApproximately how long will it be before I find out whether I am eligible to sit for the bar examination?\n\nWe have until approximately 3 weeks before the exam to determine your eligibility to sit. Other aspects of your eligibility process may require longer. Your character and fitness investigation may be ongoing, is independent of your eligibility to take the exam, and may take up to 270 days to complete.\n\nIt is always prudent for foreign-educated applicants to file their applications timely. Additionally, it is helpful for the applicant to remain in routine contact with the appropriate individuals at their law school, jurisdiction of licensure, and employers listed on their application to help secure timely responses.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI am re-applying for the bar exam. Do I have to list information that I provided in the Employment or Character & Fitness sections of my previous application?\n\nNo. Please note the language on the Re-Application that states “since the filing of my last application”. The Re-Application is meant to update the Board with any new information that has occurred since the last time you applied. Do not provide duplicative information.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI am re-applying for the bar exam. Do I need to submit another birth certificate or get re-fingerprinted? Is there any third-party documentation that must be resubmitted?\n\nIf you are a licensed attorney, you must submit a current Certificate of Good Standing and statement of discipline (dated within the past 30 days) for each state or foreign jurisdiction where you are admitted.\n\nUnless specifically instructed by our office, you do not need to provide any the following with your Re-Application: birth certificate, fingerprint cards, MPRE score reports, transcripts.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI have an LL.M. from an ABA-approved law school, but it does not satisfy the new curricular requirements set out in Rule 13.\n\nIf you completed your LL.M. before October 1, 2016, then you are exempt from demonstrating that your LL.M. meets the curricular requirements set out in Rule 13 §9.\n\nIf you complete your LL.M. degree on or after October 1, 2016, then you will be required to demonstrate that your LL.M. meets the curricular requirements set out in Rule 13 §9.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI am in the process of completing an LL.M. degree at an ABA-approved law school, but it may not satisfy the new curricular requirements set out in Rule 13 §9.\n\nIf you completed your LL.M. before October 1, 2016, then you are exempt from demonstrating that your LL.M. meets the curricular requirements set out in Rule 13 §9.\n\nIf you complete your LL.M. degree on or after October 1, 2016, then you will be required to demonstrate that your LL.M. meets the curricular requirements set out in Rule 13 §9.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nGrade Release, Swearing-In, and Licensing\n\nDo Courtesy Seating applicants appear on the Texas Bar Exam Pass List?\n\nNo. Because courtesy seat examinees have not applied for admission to Texas, we do not include their names on the Texas pass lists (even if they scored a 270 or higher).\n\nBack to TOP\n\nHow do I take the oath if I am not in the United States?\n\nIf you are admitted to practice law in Texas, you must take an oath to support the constitutions of the United States and Texas, honestly demean yourself in the practice of law, and discharge your duty to your clients to the best of your ability.

For this reason, the Board will not grant any requests for re-grading. No exceptions are made to this policy. Do not call or write the Board requesting a re-grade of your exam papers. All such requests will be denied, without exception.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI did not pass the exam. Can I look at my papers to find out what I did wrong?\n\nNo. However, Rule 11(g) provides for a one-time formal review, which is an individual, oral review of your performance on the exam (excluding the MBE). The review is conducted by a member of the Board of Law Examiners remotely via Zoom, who has reviewed your exam performance on prior administrations. To qualify for a formal review, you must have failed the Bar Exam more than once and have not previously had a formal review. Regardless of the number of exams taken, you are entitled to only one formal review.\n\nIf you are eligible for a one-time formal review, we must receive your written request for a formal review within 14 days of the date shown on Bar Exam result letter. You must email your request to information@ble.texas.gov. We will notify you of the date and time for your formal review after all requests have been received.

Pursuant to these guidelines:\n\nAs used in these guidelines, a military spouse applicant means an attorney holding a current active law license in another state who demonstrates that his or her spouse is a person on active duty as a member of the armed forces of the United States, whose duty station is in Texas.\n\nThe military spouse applicant may file an application for regular admission in Texas at a reduced fee (the fee applicable to an out-of-state law student) without having to demonstrate the indigence required under Rule 18(c) for fee waivers.\n\nIf applying to take the Texas Bar Examination, no late fee will be incurred for filing within the times provided in Rule 9(a).\n\nThe military spouse applying for admission without examination (AWOX) should meet all other eligibility criteria for admission, but if lacking only Rule 13 practice time, then the military spouse may submit a written request for waiver of 13 demonstrating good cause for (a) enlarging the seven-year window to encompass law practice beyond seven years, (b) accepting fewer than the minimum five years time in practice, or (c) both.\n\nThe military spouse’s waiver request shall be submitted through ATLAS at the time of filing the application for admission, or thereafter. In addition to any other factors the military spouse applicant may consider appropriate for the Board to consider, the applicant’s waiver request shall include:\n\nA verifiable history of short-term moves that were compulsory for the applicant as an attorney married to an active duty military service member;\n\nA detailed description of the unique problems, if any, the applicant faced as a military spouse in undertaking to engage actively and substantially in the lawful practice of law during the relevant time period(s) for which waiver is sought;\n\nDocumentation demonstrating to the Board’s satisfaction that the applicant is currently the legal spouse of an active duty member of the armed forces whose duty station is in Texas; maintains a current active license to practice law in another state or territory of the United States; is in good standing and has no current or pending discipline in any jurisdiction currently licensed (active or inactive status); is in compliance with Continuing Legal Education, fees and other requirements of licensure in all jurisdictions of active licensure; and has no issues that could result in the Board’s character and fitness director determining that the applicant lacks present good moral character and fitness; and\n\nAny letters of support from attorneys with whom applicant has practiced law that the applicant considers appropriate for the Board to consider with respect to the waiver request.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nI am a military service member or military spouse applying to take the Texas Bar Exam.

The motion must be accompanied by our Acknowledgment Letter, as well as a motion from a resident practicing Texas attorney. See Rule 19 for information on the required form and content of these motions.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nWho decides a non-resident attorney’s motion for permission to participate in a Texas proceeding?\n\nThe Texas court or body in which the motion is filed decides the motion. The court may deny the motion if the court determines that the non-resident attorney is not a reputable attorney who will observe the ethical standards required of Texas attorneys, that the non-resident attorney has been appearing in courts in Texas on a frequent basis, that the non-resident attorney has been engaging in the unauthorized practice of law in the state of Texas, or that other good cause exists.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nDoes a non-resident attorney have to pay the non-resident attorney fee and comply with Rule 19 in order to seek permission to participate in the following:\n\na. A proceeding of a cause in a court with limited jurisdiction, such as a justice court?\n\nYes. Rule 19 applies to the proceedings of a cause in any Texas state court. The rule does not apply to cases in federal courts located in Texas.\n\nb. An administrative proceeding?\n\nRule 19 has been applied to proceedings in matters before Texas state agencies whose rules contemplate appearances by counsel.\n\nc. A deposition, arbitration, mediation, or other pre-trial proceeding?\n\nIf a suit is on file in a Texas court, any participation by a non-resident attorney in the proceedings in that suit on behalf of a client, including arbitration and mediation, is subject to the fee requirement, even if the proceeding or deposition occurs outside of a courtroom.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nIs another fee required if a case is appealed to an appellate court?\n\nYes. The appellate case is considered a new proceeding.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nDo non-resident attorneys have to satisfy the fee if they are employed by government agencies or nonprofit entities?\n\nYes.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nCan the fee be waived?\n\nYes. The Supreme Court of Texas may waive or lower the fee for a non-resident attorney representing an indigent person. For information on how to request a waiver, see Request to Waive or Reduce a Non-Resident Attorney Fee\n\nBack to TOP\n\nWill the fee be refunded if the case is dismissed or settles, another attorney substitutes in, or the court denies a motion to participate in the proceeding?\n\nNo. Once we deliver the Acknowledgment Letter, we cannot alter its contents, and we cannot refund or transfer the fee for any reason.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nCan a non-resident attorney pay one fee to cover multiple cases?\n\nNo. A non-resident attorney must satisfy the fee requirement for each case in which the attorney is seeking to participate.

A non-resident attorney seeking permission to participate in proceedings of a particular cause must be associated with a resident practicing Texas attorney. See Rule 19(a)(2) and 19(b) of the Rules Governing Admission to the Bar of Texas.\n\nBack to TOP\n\nShould a motion to the Court be filed simultaneously with the application to the Board?\n\nNo. Satisfying the fee requirement is a mandatory first step.
