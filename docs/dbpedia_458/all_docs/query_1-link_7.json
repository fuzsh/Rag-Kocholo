        "text": "There are 1000s of reasons to visit Madrid, the Spanish capital and I hope that by the end of this article the uncertainty that led you to ask the question, ‚ÄúIs Madrid, Spain worth visiting?‚Äù has dissipated and you‚Äôre raring to explore the gorgeous city of Madrid.\n\nüìå Madrid famously has a rich cultural heritage, and a thriving food scene. It‚Äôs the second leafiest city in the wold and it also has a great queer scene. In my opinion, Madrid isn‚Äôt only ‚Äúworth visiting‚Äù, it‚Äôs a clear ‚Äúmust visit‚Äù. I joined forces with a group of other bloggers and adventurers to show you why.\n\nThere are affiliate links in this article. If you click and make a purchase I could make a small sum at zero cost to you. Thank you!\n\nIs Madrid, Spain Worth Visiting? ‚Äì The Basics\n\nGetting Around Madrid\n\nüöå Madrid is an extremely well connected city. Public transportation is good: there is a metro running through the city and buses are clean and comfortable. There are electric scooters and bikes for rent on the streets.\n\nüöä Madrid has two main train stations: Madrid Atocha and Charmart√≠n. Around 110 million people pass through Atocha every year. We hope you won‚Äôt just pass through though. We hope you‚Äôll stop to explore this amazing city.\n\n‚úàÔ∏è Madrid‚Äôs airport lies to the east of the city and is easily reached by metro and overland train.\n\nüöï Ubers and taxis are both frequently used in Madrid.\n\nüö∂üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The city is pretty flat so it‚Äôs easy to walk everywhere.\n\nAccommodation in Madrid\n\nüõå There are hotels, hostels and apartments for all tastes and budgets. I find Madrid to be on the pricey side for accommodation but with some perseverance I‚Äôve always been able to find something I like within my budget.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth remembering that the good public transportation system means it isn‚Äôt imperative to stay in the city center.\n\nFood in Madrid\n\nüçΩ Spaniards eat when they eat and although it is possible to find restaurants that are open all day long, most will be open for lunch (2 ‚Äì 4 ish) and then close until 8 pm or so when they open again for the supper crowd.\n\n‚õë Safety in Madrid\n\nMadrid is a pretty safe city as far as personal safety goes. There are people on the streets at all hours so you‚Äôre unlikely to ever find yourself properly alone. However, you should always be aware of the possibility of pickpockets, no matter how safe you feel: Madrid is still a big capital city.\n\nLet‚Äôs move now to considering your question: ‚ÄúIs Madrid, Spain Worth Visiting?‚Äù\n\nArchitecture in Madrid\n\nMadrid, like any good European capital city, is full of imposing old buildings that will make you feel simultaneously teeeeeny weeeeny and full of awe. Once you‚Äôve picked yourself up off the sidewalk you can get on with the mission of exploring and checking out the phenomenal buildings.\n\nLet‚Äôs take a look at some of the most beautiful architecture in Madrid. Anywhere you walk you‚Äôll be astounded but I absolutely love strolling along Gran V√≠a. The architecture is definitely one of the reasons that Madrid, Spain is worth visiting.\n\nPalacio de Ciebeles / Centro de Comunicaciones / CentroCentro\n\nFor me this is the most incredible building I have seen in Madrid. It was built in 1904 and houses exhibitions (most recently a Monet exhibition). It‚Äôs possible to climb the tower for panoramic views of the city. And yes, it really did used to be the post office.\n\nThis multi-named building is located on the crossroads of Calle de Alcal√° and Paseo del Prado. In fact, this whole area is fabulous. Next door to CentroCentro is the Museo Naval, opposite is the Casa de America and in front is the Fuente de Cibeles.\n\nBanco de Espa√±a\n\nAn imposing building for sure but if you, like me, were a big fan of the Spanish Netflix series ‚ÄúCasa de Papel‚Äù, you will absolutely recognise this beauty of a building.\n\nCirculo de Bellas Artes\n\nThis cool building is a cultural center but the main reason to visit is to take the elevator all the way to the terrace for panoramic views over Madrid. I did this and loved it because it gave me a chance to really see CentroCentro in all its glory from above.\n\nEdificio Metropolis\n\nThis iconic symbol of Madrid, is in late 2023 ‚Äì early 2024, under wraps for renovation. The winged goddess is still visible over the coverings, though.\n\nüìå There are really too many incredible buildings and sculptures to mention in an article that isn‚Äôt dedicated to architecture but take it from me you don‚Äôt want to miss the Canaeljas Center, the Palacio de Cristal, Atocha Station (yup, even the train station is magnificent) or the fabulous Brutalist building ‚Äì Torre Blancas on Avenida de Americas.\n\nPlaza Puerta del Sol\n\nThis plaza shouldn‚Äôt be missed. It‚Äôs home to three famous Madrile√±o landmarks:\n\nKilometr√≥ 0 ‚Äì from this point, 6 national highways are measured ‚Äì see if you can find the plaque\n\nEl Oso y el madro√±o ‚Äì you‚Äôll see this famous sculpture on bags, t-shirts and more as you explore Madrid but this is the original\n\nT√≠o Pepe sign ‚Äì overlooking the plaza, this sign for a sherry is a popular local landmark\n\nOf these three, like an idiot, I got a photo only of one (in my defence, it was extremely crowded).\n\n‚ûï On your adventures, the Plaza Mayor and Plaza de Espa√±a are also worth checking out. I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the Plaza Mayor but did enjoy the Plaza de Espa√±a, particularly because it‚Äôs so close to the Palacio Real (Royal Palace), which is another building you shouldn‚Äôt miss seeing, whatever your views on monarchies (mine, by the way are no secret! Emphatically NOT a fan).\n\nTop Tip: In Madrid, always look up and as well as down. There‚Äôs always something amazing to see on the roof tops.\n\nCulture in Madrid\n\nMadrid is a vibrant and cosmopolitan city of 3 million people. You simply can‚Äôt miss the culture. From the world class, classical, museums and the different barrios with their distinct cultures to the foodie culture and huge sports teams, Madrid has something for everyone, especially the art lovers.\n\nMuseums and Art in Madrid\n\nThe three most famous art museums in Madrid are The Prado Museum, Reina Sofia and the Thyssen-Bornemisza. If you are interested in art then Madrid is absolutely worth visiting as these three world-class museums alone will blow your socks off. People often refer to these three as the ‚ÄúGolden Triangle of Art‚Äù.\n\nMuseo Nacional del Prado\n\nIf you like art, this is unmissable but be warned, you need time and if your time is pressing, make a plan. I went in with limited time and no plan and I felt incredibly stressed inside this enormous art gallery. There‚Äôs just too much to see. This is one of the most comprehensive collections of the great masters there is. Think Goya, Vel√°zquez, Rubens, El Greco and Bosch.\n\nLike I said, I went in with no plan but after feeling lost for a while I decided finding the Bosch collection was what mattered most to me. It was worth the pain!\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Buy skip-the-line Prado tickets now\n\nThyssen-Bornemisza Museum\n\nSmaller than El Prado, this is a more manageable museum if you go on a whim (as I did). Here you‚Äôll follow European art from the middle ages to the modern day. Look out for Van Gogh, Picasso, Lichtenstein, Gauguin, Hopper, Dal√≠ and more.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Buy skip-the-line and guided tour Thyssen tickets now\n\nTop Tip: Delilah recommends using the audio guides when possible and making your way around to the specific artworks you are interested in. Picking up a sim card in Spain will allow you to use the audio guides and look up any artworks or artists you‚Äôre interested in.\n\nQuirky Galleries to Visit in Madrid\n\nIf classical arts aren‚Äôt your thing then you‚Äôll still find something to tickle your fancy.\n\nEspacio Fundac√≠on Telefonica\n\nI stumbled upon this space quite by accident as it‚Äôs well hidden in plain sight. Only a small sign offering free entry alerted me to its existence. Don‚Äôt be me, add this to your Madrid itinerary. Here you‚Äôll find thought provoking exhibitions such as the two I saw: ‚ÄúFake News‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe World Between the Physical and the Virtual‚Äù. I actually went twice it was so impressive.\n\nMuseo Gran V√≠a 15\n\nIf this is open when you‚Äôre in Madrid, be sure to check it out as they host fascinating modern exhibitions.\n\nMuseo La Neomud√©jar\n\nThis gallery is housed in an abandoned warehouse not far from Atocha Station and if you like your art truly avant garde and industrial, this is the place for you. (It also houses one of the best selections of books I‚Äôve ever seen although it‚Äôs all in Spanish). In my opinion this is one of Madrid‚Äôs hidden gems.\n\nExploring the Different Barrios of Madrid ‚Äì Something for Everyone\n\nHome to 3 million people it‚Äôs hardly surprising that the barrios (neighbourhoods) of Madrid have personalities and cultures all of their own. If we haven‚Äôt yet persuaded you that the answer to ‚Äúis Madrid, Spain worth visiting‚Äù is a firm yes, then let‚Äôs dive into the various barrios to focus on the diversity of Madrid to whet your appetite.\n\nChueca\n\nOne of the most vibrant and trendy neighbourhoods, this is also known as the LGBTQ+ barrio. Here you‚Äôll find bars, caf√©s, restaurants and theatres. While some do cater specifically to the queer community, most establishments are simply welcoming to all. Do expect plenty of joyfully queer flags and don‚Äôt be shocked by penis and vulva waffle stores.\n\nüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è One of the world‚Äôs largest Pride parades takes place here each year.\n\nMalasa√±a\n\nAlternative and cool, in Malasa√±a you‚Äôll find vintage clothes stores, laid back bars and local designers. It‚Äôs interesting to know that this was the centre of a cultural movement to return Spain to democracy after Franco‚Äôs death.\n\nBarrio de las Letras\n\nThis has been the literary area of Madrid for centuries. Miguel de Cervantes lived here as did Ernest Hemingway. Today it‚Äôs good for second-hand book stores, and bars.\n\nLa Latina\n\nFamous for its tapas bars, particularly along Calle de Cava Baja. This barrio tends to draw a younger crowd.\n\nLavapi√©s\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for multicultural cuisine and art, this area is for you. Madrid‚Äôs biggest flea-market, El Rastro, is also held here every Sunday.\n\nSalamanca\n\nOne of the most chic of all Madrid‚Äôs barrios, this is one of the best neighborhoods if shopping is your thing.\n\nNature in Madrid\n\nYou might not expect to find vast amounts of nature and green spaces in a city like Madrid but it‚Äôs there, trust me. From living walls to large parks, you can fulfil your nature needs in the capital of Spain and find plenty of outdoor activities. The nature and opportunity to explore and hug trees while in a capital city has to be a reason to answer yes to the question, ‚ÄúIs Madrid, Spain worth visiting?‚Äù. At least for me, it is.\n\nüçÉ While Parque el Retiro (also known as El Retiro Park or Parque del Buen Retiro) might be Madrid‚Äôs most famous park, it isn‚Äôt the biggest. Casa de Campo is a 1,500 hectare park and forest within the city of Madrid. There‚Äôs also Madrid R√≠o Park, the Botanical Gardens, and Parque del Oeste to visit.\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è There are a myriad of excellent reasons to visit Spain, keep reading to learn more about this magnificent country ‚≠êÔ∏è\n\nFood in Madrid\n\nMadrid is something of a foodie haven so if you enjoy eating amazing food, then Madrid is absolutely worth your time even if you don‚Äôt care for anything else the city has to offer! Madrid, as you might expect from a capital city, has its fair share of Michelin restaurants. If you are more into trendy food markets than Michelin restaurants, worry not for there are plenty of these too! If you‚Äôre stuck for time or paralysed by choice, there are some excellent food tours in Madrid to help you out.\n\nInteresting Madrid Food Facts\n\nüçΩ The world‚Äôs fourth largest fish market is in Madrid despite being hours from the sea.\n\nüçΩ Bot√≠n, the world‚Äôs oldest restaurant according to the Guinness Book of World Records, is in Madrid. It was founded in 1725. Personally I‚Äôve had beers in older pubs in the UK but it‚Äôs still pretty old. The artist, Goya worked here as a waiter.\n\nüçΩ Because Madrid was a planned city (Felipe II moved the capital here from Toledo in 1561), people from across the country moved to Madrid and brought their cuisines with them meaning it‚Äôs possible to get excellent food from across the peninsula in Madrid.\n\nüçΩ There are literally thousands of restaurants in Madrid. I can‚Äôt tell you where to eat. However, I can recommend trying tapas, heading to a market and definitely picking up some churros and hot chocolate.\n\nTapas in Madrid\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Tapas can be confusing but they really are a mainstay of Spanish cuisine. First off, tapas is the plural of tapa ‚Äì one plate is a tapa, many plates are tapas. Traditionally, you order a drink and a tapa or two come free but this is becoming less common.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not sure how it works, ask. No one will be annoyed at you for asking. I always ask if something is included when it‚Äôs brought to my table because I don‚Äôt want to pay for something I didn‚Äôt order. However, if it‚Äôs free, you bet I‚Äôll gobble that bad boy right up.\n\nNote: generally a tapa is a small plate and a rac√≠on is a bigger plate.\n\nYou‚Äôll find tapas restaurants everywhere. Order a drink and a few dishes at more than one to really get a feel for how Spain eats.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Book a best selling wine and tapas tour\n\nFood Markets / Food Halls\n\nThere are numerous food markets around Madrid. The most well known are:\n\nüìçMercado de San Ant√≥n in Chueca. This market is popular with locals at lunch time.\n\nüìçMercado de San Miguel next door to the Plaza Mayor (see below)\n\nüìçMercado de San Idelfonso on Calle Fuencarral, one of Madrid‚Äôs most popular streets this is a street food market\n\nüìçMercado de San Fernando on Calle de Embajadores in Lavapies barrio ‚Äì not just food but still an excellent selection of places to sit and eat\n\nüìçGaler√≠a Canalejas Food Hall ‚Äì find 13 restaurants and a gourmet zone here\n\nMexico Cassie‚Äôs Limited Food Conquests in Madrid Include\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Fratelli d‚ÄôItalia, Chueca ‚Äì this must be one of the very best Italian meals I‚Äôve had in my life. Including in Italy.\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Indian Accent Madrid, Chueca ‚Äì an excellent Indian meal that was as good as anything I ever had at home in the UK (and remember, for Brits, curry is basically a national dish).\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Taquer√≠a Mi Ciudad, Checa ‚Äì although we didn‚Äôt eat in this tiny Mexican restaurant, we did have excellent micheladas, shots of tequila and everything was absolutely as it would be in Mexico. For this Mexico-obsessed person it was perfection.\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Sushitokyo, Chueca ‚Äì this is an all you can eat sushi buffet. It‚Äôs decent enough but beware that they charge for uneaten plates (unless you‚Äôre sneaky enough to hide bits in your pocket when you‚Äôre simply too full to eat the last few pieces).\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è La Hogaza de Madrid, Chueca ‚Äì this is a tiny bakery selling outstanding sourdough, some of the best we‚Äôve had in Spain (and yes, I was there with a professional sourdough baker so this is a huge recommendation)\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è I really wanted to eat at Sra Smith but we couldn‚Äôt get a table at any point on the day we tried to book ‚Äì be aware and reserve in advance.\n\nYou‚Äôre right, that‚Äôs not a very Spanish selection but since I live in a small town in Andaluc√≠a I eat a lot of Spanish food. I want awesome international options when in Madrid.\n\nVegan in Madrid\n\nSince moving to Spain I have basically given up on the almost-meat-free life I chose to live in Mexico. Down here in deepest Andaluc√≠a there‚Äôs just too much love of all things pig. Getting to Madrid and seeing the sheer array of choices for vegetarians and vegans was just fabulous.\n\nNightlife and Drinks in Madrid\n\nNote: Of course Madrid has an incredibly vibrant nightlife but I am not the person to write about that since my idea of a good night is tasting aaaalllll the delicious food with a beer or two and then strolling home to bed.\n\nDay trips From Madrid\n\nAnother excellent reason to visit Madrid, if you‚Äôre not yet entirely convinced is its location and situation as a transport hub.\n\nüöó Consider renting a car to help you explore the environs of Madrid more easily\n\nüöå Check bus prices and times here\n\nüöä Check train times and prices here\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Related question: Should you visit Malaga or Seville if you‚Äôre heading south to Andaluc√≠a?\n\nA Final Thought on Whether Madrid is Worth Visiting\n\nI hope I‚Äôve convinced you that Madrid is absolutely worth your time. It‚Äôs one of my personal favourite Spanish cities and I highly recommend a trip to Spain‚Äôs capital wether you‚Äôre a first-time visitor, love learning about Spanish history or simply want to gorge on all churros. I promise you‚Äôll never be bored in the popular tourist destination that is Madrid."
