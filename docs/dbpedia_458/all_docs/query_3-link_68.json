        "text": "If your baby is not in a head-down position after your 36th week, your provider can explain your choices and their risks to help you decide what steps to take next.\n\nYour provider may offer to try to guide the baby into the right position. This is called external version. It involves pushing on your belly while watching the baby on an ultrasound. The pushing may cause some discomfort.\n\nIf your provider tries to change your baby's position, you may be given a medicine that relaxes the muscles of your uterus. You can also expect:\n\nAn ultrasound to show your provider where the placenta and baby are located.\n\nYour provider to push on your abdomen to try and turn your baby's position.\n\nYour baby's heartbeat to be monitored.\n\nSuccess is higher if your provider tries this procedure at about 35 to 37 weeks. At this time, your baby is a little smaller, and there is most often more fluid around the baby. Your baby is also old enough in case there is a problem during the procedure that makes it necessary to deliver the baby promptly. This is rare. External version cannot be done once you are in active labor.\n\nRisks are low for this procedure when a skilled provider does it. Rarely, it may lead to an emergency cesarean birth (C-section) if:\n\nPart of the placenta tears away from the lining of your womb\n\nYour baby's heartbeat drops too low, which can happen if the umbilical cord is tightly wrapped around your baby\n\nMost babies who remain breech after an attempt at turning them will be delivered by C-section. Your provider will explain the risk of delivering a breech baby vaginally.\n\nToday, the option to deliver a breech baby vaginally is not offered in most cases. The safest way for a breech baby to be born is by C-section.\n\nThe danger of breech birth is mostly due to the fact that the largest part of a baby is its head. When the breech baby's pelvis or hips deliver first, the woman's pelvis may not be large enough for the head to be delivered also. This can result in a baby getting stuck in the birth canal, which can cause injury or death.\n\nThe umbilical cord may also be damaged or blocked. This can reduce the baby's oxygen supply.\n\nIf a C-section is planned, it will most often be scheduled for no earlier than 39 weeks. You will have an ultrasound at the hospital to confirm the position of your baby just before the surgery.\n\nThere is also a chance that you will go into labor or your water will break before your planned C-section. If that happens, call your provider right away and go to the hospital. It is important to go in right away if you have a breech baby and your bag of water breaks. This is because there is a higher chance that the cord will come out even before you are in labor. This can be very dangerous for your baby."
