This can be explained at least in part by a frozen view of Islamic belief as being in an adverse relationship with popular culture: Islam is at best perceived as indifferent or even hostile. Although present in the broad corpus of Muslim belief, law, and practice, these two positions—indifference and hostility—are by no means the only or even dominant views, whether historically or today. Focusing exclusively on them precludes a view of the many possible relationships, which extend back over fourteen centuries. They constitute, in our view, an outstandingly suitable prism through which to study contemporary developments in the Muslim world. This book brings a fresh understanding of these relations in the hope of providing a foundation for greater attention by scholars, as well as students, to the study of popular culture in Muslim societies. The Arab uprisings of the last four years have been eye opening in terms of the clear imbrication of aesthetics, politics, and religion that have been on display. This vibrant politics of popular culture has been visible in the form of revolutionary street theater, graffiti, caricatures, slogans, popular songs, poetry, satirical broadsides, television shows, and jokes. All of these have worked to create senses of community among protestors, particularly in live performance. But they have also become means of political communication and sites of debate about the revolutionary process. Moreover, most of these cultural practices have included the participation of (whether passively as consumers or observers, or actively as producers and disseminators) religiously grounded Muslims. Before allowing the last four years of revolutionary “artivism” to skew a broader analysis of popular culture toward its most expressive and politicized\n\n2 Isl am and Popul ar Culture\n\nforms, we need to realize that such highly politicized forms of cultural expression are not as common as the focus on them might suggest. First, with regard to the politics of the artistic community, it must be remembered that art is not inherently revolutionary, even if it does have the potential to encourage significant change. We must not neglect those artists who were absent from the protests or even closely connected to the old regime, or the process of co-­optation of several art forms by regimes. Popular culture can work in various ways: to criticize and resist or to sustain and enforce the regimes in power. Second, popular culture not only works against or with power structures, but power works through and within popular art itself. Third, the example of the recent Arab world uprisings encourages us to reflect on the intersection of Islam and popular culture. The initial outcome of the uprisings points in the direction of a stronger Islamist political presence. Some observers—including (devout) artists—fear the possibility of a ban on various art practices when Islamists are in power. Yet, as we demonstrate throughout this volume, Islamists themselves have also turned to art for political and mobilizational purposes. Islam articulates various positions vis-­à-­vis popular culture, just as popular culture articulates a variety of political uses. This book demonstrates the variety, and the importance, of the contemporary processes in the Middle East, the larger Muslim world, and Muslim diaspora communities, which can be studied from the vantage point of Islam and popular culture.\n\nIsl am The static view of Islam as contrary to popular culture rests on two points. One is the view of Islam as a unitary cultural, political, and theological field. The other, springing from it, is that Islam has a general problem with art. It is important to be clear at the outset why both of these positions are problematic. Regarding the first, it may be helpful to recall Talal Asad’s classic essay, “The Idea of an Anthropology of Islam” (Asad 1986), in which he defines Islam as a discursive tradition. “[O]ne should begin, as Muslims do,” he argues, “from the concept of a discursive tradition that includes and relates itself to the founding texts of the Qurʾan and the Hadith” (1986: 14). The “discursive tradition” includes dominant orthodox viewpoints. But, as Asad explains, “orthodoxy is not a mere body of opinion but a distinctive relationship—a relationship of power. Wherever Muslims have the power to regulate, uphold, require, or adjust correct practices, and to condemn, exclude, undermine, or replace incorrect ones, there is the domain of orthodoxy” (1986: 15). Asad reminds us that we need to understand “the historical conditions that enable the production and maintenance of specific discursive traditions, or\n\nIntroduction 3\n\ntheir transformation . . .” (Asad 1986: 17). This will, indeed, be a consistent preoccupation in this volume. Asad’s formulation emphasizes that the discursive tradition is not historically inert or immobile but constantly in motion, even as it claims to stand outside of time and history. The discursive tradition will always be preoccupied with current issues, always be trying to give shape and direction to an as-­yet inchoate future. And it will be marked by the struggles of the past, of struggles against nonbelievers, of struggles against imperial rivals, of struggles against “heterodoxy,” variously conceived, and of struggles against “secularism.” The discursive tradition, then, is something, Asad insists, that we have to see in social, cultural, political, and historical context. Over the last three or four decades, both anthropologists and historians have developed a more plural and heterogeneous conception of Islam. In part, this has been a reaction to orientalism. Said’s well-­known critique (Said 1976) painted a rather monolithic picture, one reluctant to recognize the variety and diversity of intellectual traditions prevailing in the West concerning Islam from the seventeenth century to the present day (Irwin 2007). But orientalists did see Islam at its most authentic in the Arab heartlands, roughly from the time of the Prophet to the Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century. And they encountered it primarily in texts, written in Arabic. As Said repeatedly pointed out, this conception of Islamic authenticity was one that suited colonial power, which could, among other things, pre­sent itself to colonized Muslims as a respectful guardian of tradition. But in focusing on a single historical moment of authenticity, the large part of Islam’s history, its movement into Central, South, East, and Southeast Asia, Europe, and sub-­Saharan Africa was condemned to secondary historical status. Marshall Hodgson’s important survey of “Islamicate” society, which gave equal prominence to the medieval Islamization of Persia, Anatolia, the Balkans, and Central Asia, unsettled such orientalist habits of thought, and remains influential (Hodgson 1974). Anthropologists also gravitated to the margins. Geertz’s classic comparison of Moroccan and Indonesian Islam (Geertz 1971)—two locations considered, then, to be highly “marginal”—leads almost inescapably to the conclusion that these two kinds of Islam have little, perhaps even nothing, in common. The one is festive, saint-­oriented, located in a mobile world of bargaining and negotiation. The other is courtly, contemplative, located in a rather stately world of order and hierarchy. Gellner’s important discussion of the oscillation between urban and rural Islam in North Africa, between scriptural and saintly models of authority (Gellner 1980), also belongs to this moment. Michael Gilsenan’s Recognizing Islam (Gilsenan 1982), a study that owes something to the Manchester School’s emphasis on urban and postcolonial contexts, explores Islam\n\n4 Isl am and Popul ar Culture\n\nin the transformations of everyday life in the slums of Cairo, in the colonial new towns of Morocco, and among the Lebanese feudal aristocracy. By the early 1980s, at least, the study of the Muslim world was no longer limited by terms of inquiry that prioritized early Arabian cultural and historical experience, and that failed to recognize difference and diversity. But there are still problems. In stressing difference and diversity, one can fail to recognize what produced this difference and diversity, particularly colonialism. Colonizers in the Muslim world, as elsewhere, had an interest in appearing as guardians of tradition, in relieving themselves of tedious but relatively inconsequential areas of colonial governance, in “divide and rule” policies of one kind or another (see Asad 1973, Rosen 1989, Rabinow 1977, Mitchell 1991). The critique is, by now, long-­standing. A consequence has been that relations between “centers” and “peripheries” in the Islamic world, spaces that have been repeatedly transformed by conquest and occupation, and routinely traversed by pilgrims and travelers (Eickelman and Piscatori 1990), were for a long time understood in rather static and ahistorical ways. This dichotomization of center and periphery, the one traditionally the province of historians and literary scholars, the other the province of anthropologists and social scientists, has been unhelpful (Lindholm 1996). This volume, then, holds to the by-now conventional, if qualified, academic view of Islam as a world of diversity and difference. Its key interpretative and explanatory strategies are, necessarily, ones of “localization,” of specifying place, time, community, political circumstance. But it also attempts to acknowledge the problems of such strategies. Colonial and postcolonial histories, Islam’s “discursive tradition,” new media systems, new global deployments of military power (viz. the “war on terror”), struggles for regional hegemony, the contemporary contours of Shiʿa-­Sunni rivalry, and new ideologies of culture all forge region-­wide, even global connections, as well as local scenes and senses of identity. These must be taken into account. The challenge continues to be one of connecting—historically and politically—local frameworks and broader contexts of understanding. It is one to which all of the case studies in this volume respond.\n\n“Isl amic Art” and Aesthetic s Our second problem is that Islam is deemed to have a particularly thorny relationship with art and aesthetics. This contributes significantly to the problem of thinking about Islam and popular aesthetics. But why is this? First, proscriptions on art and music in the Qurʾan and the hadith, vague though they are, have meant that the West has mainly understood “Islamic aesthetics” in terms\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nof geometrical ornament—abstraction, repetition, antihumanism. This understanding arose at a moment when the West was turning to the non-­Western world to reinvigorate its arts and crafts, sparking, among other things, a fascination with “Islamic” geometric patterning that persists to this day. Colonial era museums and galleries in the western world—such as the Trocadero “Art Musulmane” exhibition in Paris in 1878, began to display exhibitions of Islamic art, objects—miniatures, calligraphy, ceramics—lifted from local sites or cut out of manuscripts, presenting them to western publics in ways that radically decontextualized them. Art objects here were to be looked “at,” not “through.” They were not intended to aid an understanding of specific cultural moments or formations (Seljuq, Mamluk, Ottoman, Qajar, and so forth). They were to be appreciated as freestanding objects of beauty. “Islamic aesthetics” thus came to be understood in terms dictated by these museums and exhibitions, as decontextualized art objects, selected to lend support to western aesthetic preoccupations. They also neatly supported the more general orientalist proposition that the world of Islam was to be understood in terms of its lacks and its prohibitions. Islam was believed (incorrectly) to ban all visual representation, and to take a dim view of music, unlike the West. “Islamic aesthetics” were, in fact, a kind of antiaesthetic, a world of inert tradition and “ornament” tied to function, primarily serving to demonstrate why the world of Islam could never pro­gress, why it would remain trapped in a beautiful but ascetic and motionless past. Oleg Grabar was one of the first to debunk this myth in the field of art history (Grabar 1995). Grabar showed how “ornament” is an extremely diverse and complex art historical category and one that by no means prohibited visual representation. He also showed that it was just as much a preoccupation of the medieval Christian world as the Islamic. Victoria Gonzalez’ work on the Alhambra and Gülrü Necipoğlu’s study of the Topkapı Scrolls followed hot on its heels (Gonzalez 2001, Necipoğlu 1995). These scholars came to conclusions highly relevant to our popular cultural project, and are worth sketching in a little detail here. First, they showed that Islamic visual aesthetics were highly developed, not impoverished or merely a compensation for the supposed blanket ban on all visual representation. The early Islamic philosophers attempted to reconcile both Platonic and Aristotelian conceptions of beauty with the demands of monotheism. In the Platonic case, worldly beauty was to be understood as an emanation of God’s beauty, prompting a contemplative turn in his direction, away from this-­worldly things. In the Aristotelian case, beauty was a quality of man-­made objects, whose capacity to inspire love, awe, or amazement, for instance, might also inspire the pursuit of goodness and truth. Early en-\n\n6 Isl am and Popul ar Culture\n\ncounters with the early Islamic world’s neighbors (particularly the Sassanians and the Byzantines) provoked views that representative art and music were illegitimate, whether specifically as forms of idolatry or more general signs of decadence. A certain amount of hadithic commentary, dating from this period, articulated this growing distaste. But in medieval Andalusia, where such anxieties were less pronounced and where Aristotelian rather than Platonic philosophy was ascendant, visual representation was theorized in the broader field of optics (viz. the writings of Ibn Haytham in the late tenth and early eleventh centuries CE). These kinds of theories, about proportion, order, and position, extended across various other cultural domains—poetry, calligraphy, music, and miniature painting, for instance. This is “aesthetic” thinking in a rather modern sense (viz. Rancière 2004); certainly not a rejection or negation of aesthetics. Second, they showed that practices of geometrical ornamentation needed to be interpreted in rather specific historical and political contexts and not simply assumed to be a timeless property of “Islamic art.” Necipoğlu focuses on the Topkapı Scrolls, an Ottoman pattern book of geometrical ornament (girih) dating from the end of the fifteenth century. The geometrical aesthetic elaborated in these scrolls was, Necipoğlu shows, intricately connected with Sunni revivalism, with its roots in the tenth century CE (see also Tabbaa 2001). Aesthetic debates came to play a role in the emerging split between Sunni and Shiʿa worlds, which were to reach a peak in the fierce rivalry between (Sunni) Ottomans and (Shiʿa) Safavids in the sixteenth century. For the Sunnis, Qurʾanic revelation was a singular and decisive historical event, and not a continuous emanation of divine logic, as Shiʿa philosophers and theologians averred. Geometrical ornament was, then, pressed into the service of a rather specific, and rather specifically Ottoman political project. It emphasized the completed nature of Qurʾanic revelation, and thus signified Ottoman imperium and Sunni ascendancy. If geometrical ornamentation came to assume some kind of aesthetic dominance in at least some parts of the Islamic world, then it did so at a very specific moment and for a very specific reason. The issue played out in rather similar ways in the field of music study. As is the case with visual representation, the Qurʾan is sometimes understood to “ban music.” But nowhere in the Qurʾan is the term “music” used. The sections cited to support antimusic positions are thus vague in the extreme, referring to whistling, clapping, speaking in loud voices, and so forth. A later period of anxiety, again, absorbed by the need to distinguish the nascent Muslim community from the pomp and decadence of the Sassanian and Byzantine courts, and by the encounter with Greek philosophy, produced positions and rulings on this new subject, “music.” The hadithic literature is, consequently,\n\nIntroduction 7\n\ndivided between condemnation and justification. The justifications, inevitably, became defensive and qualified. By the time of al-­Ghazzali’s Ihya Ulum al-­Din (probably written sometime in the eleventh century), music was permitted in spiritual pursuits, at least in the eyes of some, as long as, in his famous formulation, it was regulated by “zaman, makan wa ikhwan” (time, place, and community), all of which imposed stringent conditions. Western scholarship, turning to the music of the Muslim world much later than the study of Islamic art, absorbed these critiques and anxious justifications and heard in them the familiar refrains of “Islamic” censoriousness and prohibition. Music in the spiritual quest (“Sufism”) was granted exceptional status in this scholarship, explained, like Sufi visual aesthetics, in terms of divine geometry (see Bakhtiar 1976). And it was understood to flourish only in “exceptional” situations of tolerance and liberalism, as in medieval Andalusia. More nuanced positions began to appear in the ethnomusicology of the 1980s, attempting to explain music in Muslim community life in ways that took account of local social structures, political transformations, ritual and communal traditions, and conflicting principles of cultural authority (Schuyler 1985, Qureshi 1986, Baily 1988). The “discursive tradition” and its complex and contradictory pronouncements on the subject of music were, here, just one element of a highly complex scene requiring a more local frame of analysis—Moroccan, North Indian, Afghan. So the study of expressive cultural systems, chiefly art and music, but others too, has been burdened with an orientalist insistence that we start with Islam’s assumed censoriousness vis-­à-­vis aesthetics, and work from there. Art historians and ethnomusicologists have responded with alternative visions, but the problems are still deeply entrenched. These problems appear even more deeply entrenched when one shifts the focus from demonstrably “high” or “traditional” culture to popular culture. The problem is one Roxanne Varzi aptly describes as the “Reading Lolita in Teheran syndrome” (Varzi 2008). The huge popularity of Azar Nafisi’s book, particularly in the United States, shows how popular culture tends to surface in western understandings of the Middle East as a sign of resistance to and defiance of religious authority. But, as Varzi suggests, it involves a number of basic errors, alongside the perpetuation of old orientalist stereotypes. It assumes that the basis of cultural authoritarianism in Middle Eastern societies is “Islamic.” It assumes that popular culture is, by definition, “western” and thus “secular.” And it assumes that religious authoritarianism will always be hostile to expressions, and technologies, of popular pleasure. None of these assumptions hold water (see also Sreberny-­Mohammadi and Mohammadi 1994). Each and every contribution to this volume suggests an alternative.\n\n8 Isl am and Popul ar Culture\n\nBut before introducing them, it will be helpful to think further about what we mean by “popular culture.”\n\nPopul ar Culture The other key concept of the volume’s title, popular culture, is no less ambiguous than Islam. Its many possible meanings owe in good measure to the reality that its component terms themselves possess multiple and often contradictory connotations. And it is precisely the ambiguities and multiplicities inherent in the idea of popular culture that enables it to open up new ways of understanding the societies we explore here. Raymond Williams famously pointed out that culture is “one of the two or three most complicated words in the English language,” a claim that holds equally for most other languages and cultures too (Williams 1983: 87). In the modern era culture has been tied to the idea of “civilization,” a meaning that is still favored by conservative scholars such as Samuel Huntington and Bernard Lewis (the latter of whom coined the term “clash of civilizations” popularized by the former in a famous Foreign Policy essay and then book [Huntington 1996]). Huntington explains that “the fundamental source of conflict in this new world will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic. The great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of conflict will be cultural.” (Huntington 1996: 22) He then goes on to divide the world’s culture into seven “civilizations,” and clearly imagines culture in civilizational terms— that is, as a collection of customs, traditions, laws, books and “high” art produced by a society that by definition makes culture rigid and slow to change. This problematic understanding of culture facilitates the simplistic demonization of Islam as a monolithic entity that is essentially hostile to something called “Western” civilization and even modernity as a whole. Although Islam and Muslim cultures have played crucial roles—through diffusion and cooperation as much as through conflict—in the shaping of the “West,” the idea of culture as something static, as a collection of ideas or things that a person or group can possess (and lose) is analytically and historically problematic. A far more accurate way to understand culture is that it exists in its “performance” by the people who define themselves as part of it; that is, people “acting out”— living really—with the knowledge that others are watching and judging their “performance” (LeVine 2005a). Culture, then, only exists as it is expressed by ordinary people (since most people in a society are ordinary) in their everyday lives. It is not a static identity but rather a site for the invention, intervention, and performance of many different and often conflicting identities that, depending on the situation, can\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nbe used to reinforce, or resist, larger nationalist or globalizing projects. This understanding of culture is important because regarded thus it constitutes the one space where citizens of the Muslim world, and everywhere else for that matter, can become active producers, and not just passive consumers of its innumerable experiences and products. Thus on the one hand we can understand culture as including the ideas, customs, beliefs, and practices of a grouping of people that share a common history and language, which are important enough to sustaining that grouping to be transmitted across generations. But these ideas and beliefs are only understood in their expressions through public action, which is why culture also must be understood as referring to all the mundane practices of life that directly contribute to people’s ongoing “life-­narratives”—the stories by which we, chronically, interpret our existence. These stories are not static and fixed but are constantly performed and (re)invented through multiple identities that can either/both co-­opt, adapt to, and resist hegemonic and totalizing projects. If we can attest to a broad understanding of the meaning of “culture,” how does this impact our understanding of the “popular” in “popular culture”? Popular culture is far more than just mass-­produced entertainment. Indeed, commodified cultural production, circulation, and consumption have never been the only or even the dominant form of popular cultural experience. Various forms of cultural expression, from religious experience to sub- and countercultural “DIY” (do-­it-­yourself) musical cultures (punk, heavy metal, local traditional arts), all have long created and sustained popular cultures that are either largely outside the commodity chains or part of alternative systems of exchange that are not wholly determined by a purely capitalist ideology and logic. What then constitutes the arena and boundaries of “popular” culture? John Storey is probably the most prolific writer on the history of the concept of popular culture and its boundaries (e.g., Storey 2001, 2003). Popular culture remains elusive as a concept because it implies otherness, that is, “popular culture is always defined, implicitly or explicitly, in contrast to other conceptual categories: folk culture, mass culture, dominant culture, working-­class culture etc.” (2001: 1). Popular culture can be defined as originating from the people, that is “folk culture,” or as mass culture, imbuing it with additional meanings as commercial and as imposed or impoverished culture. Several approaches toward popular culture delineate popular culture as low class, separating it from elite high culture, attaching notions of inferiority to it. The word popular in the sense of “well liked by many people” strengthens an understanding that creates a contrast between elites and the masses. In addition to the question as to how far this western distinction between low and\n\n10 Isl am and Popul ar Culture\n\nhigh culture is applicable to the non-­Western world, the shifting demarcation lines between what counts as high or as low points out that these evaluations are subject to the power to articulate and define boundaries. The “popular” and “elite” binary is problematic, also given the long history of popular “translations” of elite works of art and literature, and the reverse. Indeed, local cultures or sub-­cultures are often established in opposition to the official/hegemonic culture. And while popular culture is often defined as mass (or majority) culture, it is still a place of continuous change, adaptation, and subversion. We define popular culture as the expressive practices of everyday life, which include mass media products such as television shows and video games, individualized forms of expression like food and holidays, and of course, religion. The ambiguous nature of popular culture has the advantage of allowing those writing about it to offer the definition that best fits their particular analyses or research agenda and needs. In our research, we look at the many different ways people use, interpret, and adapt even the most conventional mass-­produced items in the course of daily life. We also study the more spectacular practices of groups of people who develop new cultural forms as well as maintain traditional ones. We are especially interested in the ways the expressive practices of popular culture convey, challenge, and influence social values, norms of behavior, and sense of identity. We study the exchanges and transformations of popular culture in global and historical contexts as well as among diverse groups within contemporary Muslim societies. While popular culture may at first appear to be a trivial matter, it turns out to be the site where many of the most important and controversial issues are explored and debated.\n\nThe Power of Popul ar Culture This brings us back to issues of politics and power as immanently part of popular culture, starting from defining what it is and, more important, analyzing how popular culture operates and works with and through power. Marx and his heirs have long focused on the “superstructural” role of cultural production in support of hegemonic ideologies and political economic systems. The Marxian analysis of culture became more sophisticated in the interwar period, as thinkers such as Gramsci and the members of the Frankfurt School developed theories of culture that profoundly changed the way scholars analyze it today. First, they saw cultural production not merely as a tool of economic domination but as a central arena for struggles for hegemony between contending social and political forces.\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nIt thus serves as an area in which state and capitalist forces would invest large sums to ensure the power of culture reinforced rather than challenged their preeminent positions in society. In Gramsci’s terminology, they went to great pains to ensure that the “common sense” (senso commune) of ordinary people, which always contains at least a kernel of critique of the dominant structures of their societies, could not develop into the politically sophisticated and transformative “good sense” (buon senso), out of which revolutionary thought and praxis could develop (cf. LeVine and Salvatore 2005). Seminal Frankfurt School theorists such as Theodor Adorno (1944) and Walter Benjamin (1936) focused on the role of the technological transformation in popular culture and on its power in twentieth-­century capitalist societies. They saw something particularly powerful about the production, distribution, and consumption of mass culture in the “mechanical” or “technological” age that made it an even more central location for social and political—and through them, economic—struggles between contending classes. While Benjamin argued that mass-­produced culture had a potentially liberating effect on the working class, Adorno developed a far less sanguine view of the positive potential of mass or popular culture, feeling that its unique power would most naturally and effectively be used to deepen the power of the bourgeois class and state rather than challenge it. Specifically, popular culture would serve as a means to maintain existing structures and forms of authority, deceiving the masses and keeping them depoliticized through a focus on a highly ritualized “aura of style” that stunts people’s imagination through the production of sameness and hampers autonomous thinking and acting. It is hard to argue with Adorno’s pessimistic view of mass culture given the innumerable uses to which its commodified exemplars have been put to use, from fascist pageantry to neoliberal revolutionary cultures. Indeed, the field of cultural studies as it developed out of the Birmingham School in the 1970s did pioneering work utilizing both Gramsci and the Frankfurt School precisely by showing how seemingly subversive cultural production diverted young peoples’ energy away from direct political engagement toward “resistance through rituals” of style and consumption, a theme that has remained central to the field ever since (During 2007). Indeed, as much as it can be a handmaiden of capitalist concerns, equally often popular culture can serve as a site of revolt, resistance, and at least potentially as a form of counterculture. And as James Scott has shown, cultural practice can do both at the same time, with subaltern groups who are forced to “adopt a strategic pose” in front of the more powerful, in fact using the same cultural practices and even vocabulary to resist them behind the scenes (Scott\n\n12 Isl am and Popul ar Culture\n\n1990). It is thus clear that both analytical approaches to the roles and power of popular culture within societies at large can provide examples of cultural production and experience to demonstrate their case. Popular culture can thus take on both the form of resistance and of co-­ optation by states or movements to further their cause, producing a level of affective contradiction that has yet to be theorized adequately. At the very least, scholars must devote more attention to articulating the differences between mainstream popular culture (so-­called “mass culture”), subcultures that express identities outside established norms, countercultures that directly challenge hegemonic or dominant cultural forms, norms, and ideologies, and revolutionary cultures that seek to replace one cultural, political, and/or economic system with another, quite different one (see LeVine, 2005a and b, 2008). In this regard, a nuanced approach that brings popular culture in the domain of power while having an eye for both its potential to resist and to be co-­ opted is gained from the work of Gramsci. Of particular importance is his concept of hegemony, which Gramsci defines as “consent backed by the armour of coercion” (1971)—that is, how power elites win the consent of the majority of the people whom they govern while arrogating the right to use coercion and violence against those who oppose them. Without hegemony the exercise of power does not seem natural or legitimate; governments cannot rule and powerful social forces cannot control people for long periods by domination alone. Crucially, Gramsci argues that hegemony is never either fully realized or unchallenged. Although not directly inspired by Gramsci, Foucault developed a similar argument that power is permanently contested and that even as the discourses and technologies through which power elites (both within states and surrounding governing institutions and apparatuses) govern—what Foucault describes as pastoral, sovereign, and disciplinary power—become more powerful, intrusive, and “productive” of the political subjectivities of their citizens, hegemony is rarely won decisively or permanently (see Foucault 1995 [1975], 2003 [1997], 2009 [2004]). Indeed, the struggles for hegemony inevitably produce oppositional discourses that have the potential to challenge and ultimately even overturn the forces presently ruling and/or governing society. Is an approach that focuses on hegemony and regimes of power, or that simply regards popular culture as a pawn in power struggles or struggle for hegemony satisfactory? Or does popular culture have a space of its own? Is there something in popular culture and art that provides a space for creativity, for reflection on and distance from power structures? As Bayat (2007) holds, popular culture also contains elements of joyfulness, play, creativity, and fun. Fun presupposes a powerful paradigm about self and society that competes\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nwith and undermines the doctrinal power of the rigid, narrow, and exclusive regimes of power. It offers a different value system that conflicts with the paradigm maintained by those in power. It is a rival to exclusivist authority monopoly of truth and single discourses; it clashes and subverts one-­dimensional discourses of doctrinal authority. Popular culture thus tends to work against exclusivist notions of power. This closely corresponds with Johannes Fabian’s observation regarding the power of popular culture. In Moments of Freedom, Fabian analyzes popular culture as spaces of freedom and creativity (Fabian 1998). Popular culture can create sites for individual or collective freedom but is not in itself liberating. With regard to freedom Fabian mentions: “If freedom is conceived not just as free will plus the absence of domination and constraints, but as the potential to transform one’s thoughts, emotions, and experiences into creations that can be communicated and shared . . . then it follows that there can never be freedom as a state of grace, permanent and continuous . . . Freedom . . . comes in moments” (1998: 20–21). With regard to the moments of freedom created in popular culture Fabian mentions: “The issue of power and resistance in studies of popular culture . . . cannot be reduced to determining whether or not, or when and where, expressions of popular culture qualify as acts of resistance; what we need to understand is how popular culture creates power to resist power” (1998: 69). Power is constantly established, negated, and reestablished. “It is not its being power free that distinguishes popular culture . . . but its working against the accumulation and concentration of power, which, when institutionalized, cannot do without victims” (Fabian 1998: 133). Popular culture is an extremely inspiring field to study regimes of power, including politics of repression and resistance through culture. It provides an alternative vision of self and society that works against one-­dimensional regimes of power and defies concentration of power. It provides space to resist accumulation of power. Popular culture has accordingly the ability to continuously (re)create new moments of freedom. This ability of popular culture to unsettle established regimes of power and to work against exclusivist regimes of power makes it an important tool for studying sociopolitical transformation processes.\n\nPopul ar Culture in the Muslim World What then is the added value of bringing Islam and popular culture together? Why do we think it provides a particularly valuable way to study contemporary developments in the Muslim world? Three key propositions follow from what we have been discussing thus far. First, popular culture helps us understand\n\n14 Isl am and Popul ar Culture\n\nmajor processes of transformation in the Muslim world. Second, popular culture in the Muslim world does not equal “westernization,” “secularisation,” or “cultural grey-­out”; rather, we must consider it under the broader and more flexible rubric of globalization. Third, popular culture in the Muslim world can no longer simply be viewed—and dismissed—merely as a decoration of, or distraction from, “real politics.” First, the field of popular culture is a rich field for understanding and analyzing social transformation processes in the Muslim world. It is part of everyday life for all people; it shapes imaginations and is a key site through which contestations for meaning occur. Popular culture and art not only reflect social change but also foreshadow transformations and help to bring them about. Two areas of transformation, common across the entire region, concern us in this volume. One is what Bayat, Kepel, and others describe as “post-­Islamism,” referring to the broad shifts in attitudes and strategies of diverse Islamist movements in various Muslim countries and among Muslim minorities in Europe (Bayat 2005, 2007; Kepel 2000; Roy 2004). The term is possibly a problematic one since we would like to avoid a rigid and monolithic definition of “Islamism.” Yet, as many contributors to this volume stress, increasingly accommodating and populist attitudes toward popular culture on the part of Islamist authorities and movements have been a part of this turn (Otterbeck, Alagha, Stokes, Nooshin, and others, this volume). Popular culture has inescapably brought performing—and thus gendered and sexualized—bodies into the discursive frame of “post-­Islamism” (Silverstein, Meftahi, this volume). So this “opening up” among some Islamist movements can be productively traced through a study of changing attitudes toward women and music, as a key figure of the Egyptian pious artist community observed (Van Nieuwkerk 2013, and this volume). Another space of transformation is constituted by the contemporary uprisings in the Arab world. At the time of writing, it is very unclear where these will lead, and the picture is far from hopeful. But it is also clear to us that popular culture is a key to understanding the moment. Revolutions have always been accompanied by outbursts of cultural production from below, which reflects the energy released when hardened political and sociocultural systems suddenly are pried or explode open, releasing incredible amounts of cultural production—poetry, music, art, literature, and prose. These become important vehicles for conveying political messages, motivating people, and creating the solidarities necessary to take on state power and the violence it usually unleashes when faced with a serious threat. Beyond affective cultural production within various artistic or intellectual fields, there is also what LeVine and Reynolds describe in this volume as “theater of immediacy,” a kind of perfor-\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nmance activism whereby intensely powerful emotive public acts (such as the self-­immolation of Tunisian fruit-­seller Muhammad Bouazizi, which sparked the Arab uprisings) are also a part of popular culture, even though they are not in themselves normally considered artistic products (see also Becker, Schielke, and ter Laan, this volume). Second, Roxanne Varzi’s “Reading Lolita in Teheran syndrome” pushes many to assume, lazily, that mass-­mediated popular culture in the Muslim world is synonymous with “secularism” and “westernization.” This is assumed to make them the target of religious conservatives, who are always and everywhere presumed to be in mortal fear of the erosion of traditional cultural values and of the vitality and sexual energy of youth. And many assume the struggle to be futile—providing yet more evidence that a censorious Islam is completely out of step with history, and a world shaped, irreversibly, by global capitalism, by Coca-­Cola, McDonald’s, Marlboro, western rock and pop. But this way of looking at things is highly problematic. Asad reminds us (2003) that secularism is not simply today’s social world with religion successfully “subtracted,” or neatly contained within the private sphere. This represents the stated goals of a project, not an existing historical or cultural state of affairs. Secularism has roots in western religious experience and social transformations. Elsewhere, as in Turkey or India, it has been associated with very particular, and still highly contested political projects—the one to create a political space free from (all) religion, the other to create a space where (all) religions can meet on neutral ground. Religious and secular lobbies are engaged in bitter struggles, in situations of growing mutual incomprehension, anxiety, and distrust. It can be hard for the outsider in these situations to see exactly where “religion” ends and “secularism” begins, or which things belong where. Popular culture is, in fact, where many of these struggles take place, with religious authorities in the Muslim world increasingly pragmatic in their bid to win hearts and minds, and secularists no longer able to monopolize its core meanings (love, freedom, the pleasures of consumption, cosmopolitanism, and so forth). The contributions to this volume all explore various kinds of struggle taking place today within the popular cultural domain over signs and symbols of religiosity and secularism (Kapchan, Winegar, ter Laan, Salamandra, this volume). The struggle remains a highly unsettled one. But it is clear that popular culture can never be assumed to be intrinsically secularizing. Popular culture may, globally, be dependent upon media infrastructures introduced by the West: films, sound recordings, newspapers, the Internet, but, likewise, this has never simply meant westernization. From the outset, the new media industries sought local content for local markets. With each successive shift in production methods, local media industries broke away\n\n16 Isl am and Popul ar Culture\n\nfrom western dominance; some were nationalized. In the 1950s Egyptian film and music—and, later, television—became important tools of state formation (Abu-­Lughod 2005, Armbrust 1996) and regional influence, provoking reactions and imitations elsewhere. “Western” popular culture is, itself, multifaceted, a complex amalgam, in the field of music alone, of European folk, African American, Latin, and Caribbean elements. Muslim world societies have positioned themselves, both historically and geographically, in these shifting mediascapes and technoscapes (Appadurai 1996) for well over a century. They have reacted, or appropriated, or contributed their own voices to the global mix. Bollywood is today as much a part of whatever “global culture” might be as rap and hip-­hop. In global popular cultural space, cosmopolitanism and eclecticism is the norm (Zubeida 2010; see also Salois, Rasmussen, Frishkopf, Hodgson, Stokes this volume). Third, and finally, this volume attests to recent changes in the very notion of “culture,” in the Muslim world as elsewhere. Neoliberal restructuring—the shrinking of the state, the marketization of the public sphere, the creation of the consumer citizen—has promoted an instrumental idea of culture. Culture is, increasingly, conceptualized as a kind of resource, a powerful way of attracting investment, business, and skilled labor to “global cities” and regional hubs (such as the European “capitals of culture”) (see Yudice 2003, Sassen 2011, Keyder 1999). Where claims to cultural abundance might be harder to sustain in locations remote from the cosmopolitan global metropoles, “culture” may still be articulated as a resource for local tourism, or export (Cohen 2007, Guilbault 1993). And where the possibilities of even this are limited, “culture” may still serve as a means of channeling aid, for example in programs designed to alleviate youth unemployment or fostering peace and reconciliation. In all such cases, “culture” has come to be understood as a kind of tool, to be funded and deployed as a means to an end—“development,” “peace,” “growth,” and so forth (al-­Ghadhban and Strohm 2013, Winegar 2006). These conceptualizations attach a new importance to culture as an economic resource and as an instrumental means of promoting the social goals of the neoliberal state—that is to say, of producing pliant, peaceful citizens who enjoy shopping. The importance attached to culture by the managers of the neoliberal state seldom extends to any real consideration of sustainability, social justice, and creativity in these cultural domains. It is, at best, a space of cynicism, or, as Yúdice puts it, more gently, “expediency” (Yúdice 2003). This “expedient” attitude toward popular culture can be felt in many of the contributions to this volume. In most of the case studies presented here, Islamist parties are either running neoliberal states or absorbing neoliberal language in opposition, because this is the language of power and electoral success.\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nThis constitutes yet another reason for changing and more accommodating attitudes toward popular culture in the Muslim world. “Culture,” here, too, is being thought of as a tool, as a resource, something that might be exploited for other goals, exchanged for other social goods, productive of “growth” and “development”: in short, and following a point made long ago by Pierre Bourdieu, as capital (1984). The critical consequences of this are considerable. Popular culture grounds new processes of social production and reproduction in the Muslim world, as elsewhere. It can no longer simply be considered “superstructural,” to use the old Marxian language. On the contrary, as we have argued, it constitutes an infrastructure (see also Hirschkind 2009). And as such, it is a site of struggle, in the Islamic spaces discussed in this book, as in all modern societies. Neoliberal nation-­states, religious authorities, and new media conglomerates all have a stake in this struggle. So, too, as we have argued, do the people, attempting to muddle through difficult and complicated lives in the slums of Cairo or Rabat, zones of conflict or emergency in Syria and Tunisia, the suburbs of Istanbul or Teheran, migrant neighborhoods in Bradford or Paris, or remote towns in northern Ghana. Forms of mass-­mediated popular culture in the Muslim world are increasingly being recognized, and cultivated, as spaces of moral instruction and ethical self-­fashioning. But these popular cultural forms will—for the foreseeable future—remain indissolubly linked with other forms of mass-­mediated popular culture, forms that will continue to provoke laughter, dance, new fashion and hairstyles, song, empathy, tears, jokes, stories, dreams. In its multisensory embrace, in its repetitiousness and ubiquity, in its enlivening of bodies, it mobilizes conceptions of the human being that exceed the narrowly prescribed roles of citizen, consumer, believer, employer, laborer, housewife, unemployed youth. Popular culture in the Muslim world will continue to shape people’s sense of participation, community, and political possibility, and ensure that they have a stake in the struggle. Notes 1.

Deborah Kapchan’s chapter theorizes the power of sound for constituting pious subjectivities and provides insight in the practice of learning to listen to aesthetic sound, the “literacy of listening.” It foremost shows how sound and practices of listening can become vehicles for Sufis to create a sacred place in a secular country such as France. Sufism embraces an aesthetic system in which listening plays a dominant role. Listening is not a passive act. These are learned performances in which the practitioners become transmitters not just of sound but of knowledge as well. In this chapter Kapchan analyzes the “sound knowledge” of one Sufi Muslim order in France in order to elucidate how learned auditory practices transport a once local and ecstatic religion outside its point of origin and also how listening restructures space and subjectivity. The performance of these aesthetic sensibilities in the public sphere creates a discrepancy in the larger secular culture of France—that is, it forms a rupture with and challenge to the prevailing divisions between secular and sacred aesthetics. Martin Stokes’s chapter also demonstrates that listening is at the heart of ethical and political projects in Turkey. The chapter discusses the connections between the rise of Islamist power in Turkey, the aesthetic domain, and contemporary mass media. By focusing on the art of popular religious vocalists, the chapter explores the quest for beauty among religious communities. The aesthetic domain, in this case study listening to religious pop music, is an ethical community-­forging project. This project however has changed as the Turkish Islamist movement has transformed over the last twenty years. Stokes\n\n22 Part I\n\ninvestigates what this means for the genre of religious pop. Religious pop in Turkey played a part in consolidating the Islamist hegemony, while in recent years it has become a routine and less remarkable aspect of it. Religious pop in Turkey is no longer a provocation of secularists, or in need of justification. It is simply one form of outreach and consciousness-­raising among many. This shows that the aesthetic quest is not simply a “soundtrack to a political and economic transformation. It is part of that very transformation by forging communities and senses of participation.” Accordingly, the aesthetic is productive and has a contributory role in creating communities of listeners, albeit in a highly complex and volatile way. Mark LeVine and Bryan Reynolds develop a new theoretical approach to understand the different types of cultural performance that has come to define the Arab uprisings. To comprehend these modes of performance activism, they introduce the concept “theater of immediacy,” defined as cultural performances that are not merely emergent—that is, in the process of formation— but also “emurgent.” Combining the sense of emergence and urgency, this concept points at the rapidly developing and intense sociopolitical struggles that characterized the revolutionary moments of the Arab uprisings. Acts of extreme performance activism such as the public suicide of Muhammad Bouazizi are among the most powerful types of theater of immediacy. Yet, many engaged artists have long possessed a similar power to inspire and mobilize fellow citizens. Using several examples, LeVine and Reynolds illustrate how in times of intense sociopolitical conflict artists can function as sociopolitical conductors, creating networks for revolutionary activity that states find it very difficult to contain. This section thus highlights the transformative power of popular culture through performance, sound, and aesthetics, while moving beyond an approach in which aesthetics is reduced to mere political tools of governance.\n\nChapter 1\n\nListening Acts, Secul ar and Sacred: Sound Knowledge among Sufi Muslims in Secul ar France Deborah Kapchan\n\nWe are in Montpellier, France, April 2009. As the ceremony begins, Rquiyya lifts her prayer beads in the air, the sign for those gathered to begin to chant—first the fatiha, the “opening” prayer in the Qurʾan. Then the Yassin sura. Then follow the names of God, al-­latif, the subtle one; al-­qawi, the powerful; al-­ʿaziz, the dear. We chant for ninety minutes, and then the songs begin, some based on eighteenth- and nineteenth-­century mystical poems or qasaʾid. Some have new lyrics praising the living shaykh, Shaykh al-­Hamza. The French speakers enunciate in a beautifully inflected Arabic, though they don’t know the meaning of the words they are pronouncing. Even the North Africans present at the ceremony were brought up speaking French. This is less important to them than the power the sounds contain. Most important, there is a regnant and articulate discourse about the power of listening. In the last decade, much research and social theory has emerged about the rise of forms of religious behavior and the complexity of different forms of secularism (Asad 2003, Bowen 2009, Casanova 1994, De Vries and Sullivan 2006, Dressler and Mardain 2011, Jakobson and Pellegrini 2008, Mahmood 2005, Taylor 2003, 2007). Weberian ideas about the eventual disappearance of religion due to an increase of rationalism no longer hold sway (Weber 2002). Rather we find ourselves before a tidal wave of rising religious emotions, from Christian fundamentalism in the United States to Muslim conservatism in the Arab East, to say nothing of a proliferation of different forms of spirituality related and unrelated to organized religion, such as yoga schools and African dance classes. We are in a moment of heightened sacred affect. With the rise of religious fervor, however, we are increasingly aware that secularism is not the neutral political baseline that ensures religious freedom for all (as has been thought in the United States and in France, for example), but is itself an ideology that demands belief and defense. While it is clear, following Talal Asad (2003), that every incarnation of secularism has its own\n\n24 Deborah Kapchan\n\nparticular history and must be evaluated accordingly, in France many see it as under attack, and consequently secularism has become an ideology that is just as strident as any fundamentalism. Indeed French historian Esther Benbassa (2012) refers to the current situation in France as laïcité intergriste, or secular fundamentalism. In our current post–­Cold War moment, when late capitalism and its consumption practices permeate the globe, and hallowed democracy does not fulfill its promise, the terms for political debate have changed. In order to live in a “post-­secular”1 world—that is, in a Euro-­American context in which secularism is no longer mythologized as a neutral baseline that protects the rights of religious freedom, but rather understood as a political ideology2—it is necessary to recognize that the terms of the West (what scholars call the “global North”), are not universal. Indeed, it is essential to consider what Santos calls “epistemologies of the south”—ways of knowing that do not emerge from the occident. These ways of knowing often imply different hierarchies of the senses (Howes 2003). Rancière would say that there is a different “distribution of the sensible” at play, another way to embody cultural knowledge (Rancière 2010). What’s more, it is important to understand that the global North and the global South are less geographic places than they are symbolic placeholders. The global South—its epistemologies and ontologies—exist in the northern hemisphere, just as the global North may be found in the southern hemisphere (Santos 2011). It is clear that the Sufis in France described above practice in a climate that is less than hospitable to forms of Muslim religiosity. However, this neither prevents the spread of Sufism in France nor abates Muslim conversion among French citizens, a phenomenon that has been rising steadily.3 How do Sufis create a sense of belonging in a country that is increasingly Islamophobic? I assert that sound, and more important, practices of listening, become main vehicles for this minority to create a sacred place in a secular land. “Thinking with sound and music may offer the opportunity for thinking through issues of inclusion, coexistence and what a multicultural landscape might sound like in the age of information and global interdependency” (Bull and Back 2003: 15). What does scholarly attention to practices of listening facilitate? How can listening help us apprehend and thus understand other ways of being and knowing? And how can these questions help us reconceive modes of knowledge transmission? In this chapter I examine what I refer to as “listening acts,” conscious per-\n\nListening Acts, Secul ar and Sacred 25\n\nformances of (in this case, sacred) listening. Listening acts are not passive; indeed, I argue that they are learned performances in which the practitioners become transducers not just of sound but of knowledge as well, sound knowledge. In particular I analyze the sound knowledge of one Sufi (or mystical) Muslim order in France in order to elucidate how learned auditory practices transport a once local and ecstatic religion (based on one charismatic shaykh in northern Morocco) outside its point of origin, and also how listening restructures space and subjectivity, creating a form of sound knowledge. This takes place through what I have called the “literacy of listening” (Kapchan 2009a)—that is, the acquired ability to learn other cultures (specifically religious cultures, though not exclusively these) through auditory participation in its sound-­worlds. French converts to Islam as well as lapsed Muslims returning to the faith via Sufism embrace an aesthetic system in which listening plays a more dominant role than it previously had. This redistribution of aesthetic sensibilities, accompanied by its performance in the public sphere, certainly creates a dissensus in the larger secular culture of France—that is, a rupture with and challenge to the prevailing equations between secular and sacred aesthetics. Yet it does so not ideologically but aesthetically. Contributing to a growing literature on how Muslims create ethical selves in bodily practices of devotion4—in prayer, discussion groups, sartorial practices and through the Sufi concept of deep5 listening, or samaʿ—I analyze North African Sufism in diaspora,6 where emotions related to secularism (laïcité) and Islam are often perceived to be in conflict (Asad 1993, 2003; Balibar 2004; Bowen 2004, 2009; Ewing 1997, 2003, 2005a; Frishkopf 2012; Hirshkind 2006; Kapchan 2010; Mahmood 2005; Werbner 2002, 2003).\n\nSufism from Morocco to France And, therefore, did al-­Khadir, when he was asked in the dream concerning Hearing say, “It is pure slipperiness, there stand not fast upon it save the feet of the learned.” al- ­Ghazzali 1907: 711–712\n\nThe Boutshishiyya Qadiriyya order is arguably the largest order in Morocco and is certainly the most politically important. The head of this order, Shaykh al-­Hamza, lives in northern Morocco and is over eighty-­five years of age. In the last decades this order has exceeded the bounds of Morocco and has spread to France, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. Its adoption, by French and North American citizens of North African descent as\n\n26 Deborah Kapchan\n\nwell as converts to Islam, involves a re-­training of the body through disciplines related to listening. My work is based on research with a branch of this order begun in 1994–1995 during fourteen months of continuous residence in Rabat, Morocco, then continued in the south of France over an additional fourteen months in 2008–2009, and every summer since then. My research began in Morocco in 1994 when I was in Rabat on a Fulbright research grant. Originally my entrée into the Sufi world was a personal one— my “official” research had to do with Gnawa trance ceremonies—musical rituals aimed to propitiate the spirits of those afflicted and possessed by spirits (Kapchan 2007). While perusing the shelves of Kalila wa Dimna bookstore in Rabat one day, I bought a book entitled The Sufi Path (La Voie Soufie). The book jacket said that the author, Faouzi Skali, held a doctorate in anthropology from the Sorbonne. I was intrigued. Having always been attracted to esoteric worlds, I was curious to understand Moroccan Sufism experientially. I went to see Faouzi Skali in his home in Fes. He and his wife Katherine welcomed me warmly. Although we discussed anthropology, I told them I was interested in participating in Sufi ceremonies, not as a researcher but as a seeker. This was to transform over the years and in fact my position is always a liminal one in the order. (I continue to practice with the Sufis in France and Morocco when I am there, and have also given a lecture at the World Conference of World Sufism during the mawlid celebrations, the celebrations of the Prophet’s birthday, in Madagh, Morocco). Faouzi sent me to a muqaddema, or overseer, in Casablanca, who held the ceremonies in her home. Although I was living in Rabat, I took the commuter train to Casablanca once a week for nine months to attend Sufi ceremonies. There I learned the vocabulary of Sufism as well as its aesthetic dispositions. My initiation into this research was literally through my ears. I listened intently to the liturgy (the wadhifa), immersing myself in the prosodies of the Qurʾanic verses recited, the names of God chanted, and the songs sung. The melodies took up residence in my body and accompanied me into other aspects of my life. However, it was only when I spent a year in France during my sabbatical (2008–2009) that I truly understood the aesthetic waters in which I was swimming. I settled in a small village outside of Nîmes and lived there for fourteen months. I knew there was a Boutshishiyya group in the vicinity of Orange, about one-­and-­a-­half hours away. I had a car, and so I saw myself making that commute weekly in order to conduct what had by now become official research. But when I went to the Sunday market in my village for the first time, I noticed a Moroccan couple selling Moroccan leather goods. I struck up a conversation.\n\nListening Acts, Secul ar and Sacred 27\n\nSalam alay-­kum, I said. Alay-­kum salam, the woman answered me.\n\nIn the south of France, there are several North African vendors in the marketplaces that travel from town to town on different days. In the department of the Gard, a less affluent and more diverse region, there are many French who were either born in North Africa or were sons and daughters of the Pieds-­ Noirs. Consequently, many French shoppers stop and converse in rudimentary Arabic with the North Africans, who humor them by throwing back a few sentences. I was attempting to use Arabic phrases in the marketplace to ease tensions wrought by colonialism and build symbolic bridges across ethnic divides. But our conversation continued. Where are you from? I asked her.\n\nIt is unlikely that someone who has not spent a lot of time in North Africa would ask this question right off the bat. It is a question that North Africans ask all the time of each other, since regional alliances speak legions, but only to those who are familiar with the associations between place and character regnant in Morocco or Algeria. “I’m from the north,” she answered, “outside Nador.” “Oh,” I responded. “That’s where Sidi Hamza is from.” Sidi Hamza is the name of the living shaykh of the Boutshishiyya order. “You know Sidi Hamza?” she asked. “Yes, I have been practicing with the Boutshishiyya Sufis since 1994,” I answered. “But we are in the order!” she exclaimed. “We are having a meeting this ­afternoon. You have to come!”\n\nAnd so my research began. It found me before I found it, in the very town where I was living in the south of France. This is what Moroccans would call al-­maktub, destiny (literally, what is “written”). In retrospect it is easy to understand why I became aware of the different aesthetic system at work in this order only once I was in France. In Morocco, I was the only nonnative speaker of Arabic at the ceremonies. Thus, I imagined that my experiences with listening and sound took on a particular definition because of the heightened attention that I, as a nonnative speaker, brought to the experience. Many of the women in the order had been attendees for quite\n\n28 Deborah Kapchan\n\na while; but I was a newcomer to the liturgical context and its spiritual experience. There was not a meta-­discourse in place to guide me. Although in 1994 the liturgy had been transliterated into the Latin alphabet, almost everyone followed along with the Arabic texts. In Morocco, I frequented women for whom this practice was second nature.7 When the order expanded to France, however, the liturgy and its accompanying chants and songs had to be transliterated. The texts were not translated, as Arabic remained the language of utterance and performance, yet there were necessary shifts, including the development of a discourse in French, not about the referential meaning of the liturgy (that remains untranslated even today), but about the ideas embodied in the practice. The spread of Sufi Islam requires a translation of its key terms and metaphors: thus samaʿ, spiritual audition; tawajjuh, orientation (or spiritual transmission); dhikr, remembrance of God through recitation; sirr, secret. Such translation relies initially on the figure of the tarjuman—the translator or interpreter in Arabic, the bilingual and often bicultural figure that explains the worldviews, practices, the aesthetics and ethos, of one culture to another. Certainly Faouzi Skali is one such figure for the Boutshishiyyas. As the representative of the Boutshishiyya order for French converts in France (the shaykh’s nephew Sidi Mounir is the representative for a more North African branch in France) and as a trained anthropologist who has authored many books on Sufism in French, Faouzi has been doing the work of intercultural translation for much of his career. In addition to receiving a United Nations’ peace prize, he founded the Fes Festival of World Sacred Music, a festival that created the template for the Dalai Lama’s sacred music festivals in Los Angeles and Geneva. This festival has also spawned innumerable other sacred music festivals around the globe, including Skali’s second festival, the Festival of Sufi Culture (Kapchan 2008). Skali is not alone in his efforts at intercultural translation. Indeed, we may say that the spread of religion, as well as the spread of aesthetic systems, across linguistic and cultural boundaries, relies on liminal figures such as Faouzi Skali. The practice of conscious listening (that is, spiritual audition or samaʿ) transmits a kind of “sound knowledge”—a nondiscursive form of affective transmission resulting from acts of listening (Kapchan 2015)—difficult to recognize, being an epistemology without a name in the West and in many other parts of the world.8 What part does listening play in Islamic devotion for Sufi Muslims in Morocco and abroad? How do ways of listening create a Sufi? How do new converts to Islam learn to listen deeply? And how is the popularity of the sacred genre of samaʿ moving Islam across the globe? In order to answer these\n\nListening Acts, Secul ar and Sacred 29\n\nquestions, I am going to tell you a short story about listening, samaʿ, in three acts. My work is ethnographically based. Like many Sufis, ethnographers believe that experience provides the basis for knowledge.\n\nListening Act I: To Listen as a Sufi If Samaʿ or “spiritual audition” or “Sufi chant” or yet again “Qasaîd” [poetry] is a wine that quenches the thirst of the spirit, the ears are also cups serving this divine intoxication.9 In the quote above, praise poetry is the wine of divine intoxication. It would follow that the singer—the producer of the sound—would be the vehicle, the medium of this flow. However, this is not the case. It is the ears that are singled out as being the medium of this inspirational flow. The ears are portrayed as actively serving up the activity of listening. This makes sense of course. Listening is an activity. In Sufism, this is explicitly so. How do we listen to ourselves listening? We can feel ourselves moving, and we can hear ourselves talking or singing, but can we listen to ourselves listening? The genre of samaʿ asks us to do that. Samaʿ is a genre of sung chant, but it is also the process of listening to that chant. It is a technique of the ear. In order to produce samaʿ— indeed, even in order to appreciate it—Sufis must learn to listen in another way—an extra-­ordinary and conscious way. Samaʿ is a technique that can be learned, and it functions as a pedagogy of personal and spiritual transformation. Like the voice, which can speak about itself, like writing, which can represent inscription, samaʿ is listening as well as what is listened to—that is, it is both a practice and the thing produced. The person listening as well as the singer is called a samiʿa (musamiʿa in classical Arabic). Sufis in Morocco and France congregate in people’s homes. The meetings often float; there is a schedule, and each week a different host. Sometimes the liturgies are held in apartments in subsidized housing complexes on the outskirts of cities, towns, and villages. Sometimes they are held in extremely comfortable single-­family homes. The class orientation varies across the order, but whether in an apartment or a villa, ceremonies take place with the supplicants sitting on quilted mats and pillows on the floor, usually in a room without furniture. Thus, rooms in private residences are transformed into sacred places of worship. There are several forms of worship that are practiced. In one form, the liturgy begins in silence, the leader holding up her prayer beads to signal that prayer should begin. At that time, there is an interiorized sound: la ilaha ila allah, there is no god but God, ten thousand times. The words roll over and over in the mind as the fingers roll over the polished wooden prayer beads. But\n\n30 Deborah Kapchan\n\nthere is a bodily accompaniment as well, as the tongue moves quickly across the upper palette and then descends—a ilaha ila allah. It is important to “utter” the phrases, even if quietly (khas-­ak t-­ntuq). This creates an intersensory experience, a rhythm between silent word, moving tongue, and rosary fingers that in turn becomes a bodily memory, in which, as phenomenologist Edward Casey notes, “the past is co-­immanent with the present” (1987). What’s more, there are occasional emergences of sound, as if the utterances bubbled up and turned to sonority when hitting the air, refusing to be confined to the body, the sound body exceeding its flesh. The women begin by listening to the resonance of their own barely audible whispers. This resonance is first experienced as the echo of one’s own voice reverberating in the cavities of the head, but then ripples outward and inward, with incoming whispers, and the clicks of strings of beads rising and falling like a waterfall. Sometimes the women begin with the spoken liturgy (wadhifa), that is with a recitation of several Qurʾanic verses (surat al-­yassin, surat al-­waqiʾa, al-­fatiha), before the remembrance section (dhikr) in which the women chant some of the ninety-­nine names of God aloud—allah, al-­latif, al-­ʿaziz. The Yassin Sura is complex. It is long. The women who have been in the order for more than a year usually know it by heart. Nonetheless, many of the women read the transcript in Latin letters. It is marked with asterisks that note the phrases—one asterisk for a fall in intonation, the second for the completion of the phrase and a breath. In fact, the lessons in listening begin here, as the majority of these women are not Arabic speakers. They come to the ceremonies, and they learn to listen. When I began the France-­based research in 2007, most of the women were in their twenties and thirties. In a group of fifteen, twelve women were second generation French North Africans, and three were French converts to Islam. In France the population of people of North African descent is estimated to be between 5 and 9 percent of the total population.10 After the withdrawal of the French protectorate from Morocco in 1956, as well as the horrific Algerian War of Independence from France (1954–1962), North African immigration to France surged. The changing demographics in France over the last several decades has given rise to a multiculturalism that challenges the hegemony of French cultural practices and also puts into question the adequacy of political systems based on laïcité, secularism, as a defining governmental practice. As French courts delay trials because of Ramadan11 and annul marriages based on false claims of virginity,12 and as massive advertising campaigns are launched on billboards and television to sell special foods during Ramadan,13 the French secular public is more and more aware that historical notions of laïcité are not shared.\n\nListening Acts, Secul ar and Sacred 31\n\nListening Act II: Learning to Listen How is it that non-­Arabic speakers in France become competent performers of Sufi songs and prayers in Arabic? Of course, there are many places in the Muslim world where non-­Arabic speakers learn to recite the Qurʾan beautifully (Nelson 2001; Rasmussen 2010). But unlike pedagogies in Qurʾanic schools, where phrases are taught slowly and over years, the Sufi initiates in France undergo a complete immersion into the ritual all at once. No one gives them individual lessons. They come to the ceremony, and they learn to listen. When I asked Soumaya, who knows the entire liturgy by heart, how she learned it, she humbly said, “just by assiduity”—that is, concentration and absorption. When I asked her how long it took, she replied, “only a few months.” I asked another young woman, “But you, Halima, you understand Arabic, don’t you?” “Just a little,” she admitted. “Then how is it you speak so beautifully,” I said. A force d’écouter, she answered, “just by listening.” Il faut écouter avec le coeur, “you have to listen with your heart.” Second generation French North Africans and French converts become Sufi initiates by learning to listen in new ways. This is because there is already an extant methodology for spiritual audition in Islamic mysticism called samaʿ. Samaʿ, literally “listening” in Arabic, refers to both the technique of active and attentive listening that Sufis employ in their ceremonies and the ceremony itself (During 1988; 1993). According to ethnomusicologist Jean During, samaʿ first appeared among the Sufis in Baghdad in the ninth century and was elaborated in traditions and treatises that spread to the larger Islamic world (During 1993). It is still employed today in such places as Turkey, Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, Europe, and the United States. Sufis believe that the activity of spiritual audition, or samaʿ, polishes the heart, purifying the disciple and thereby making space for the love of God to inhabit the whole being. As the leader of the singing group in Paris writes: Samaʿ or spiritual audition is, with Dhikr (the invocation), a major pillar in Sufi education. The content of poems, the rhythm of singing and the whisper of melodies elevate the soul to the subtle presence of the divine Light. This saving Light purifies the soul from its imperfections, which progressively transform the vision we have of the world and the creation. The practice of samaʿ reveals the presence of God in anything and by the same fact invites the aspirant to nobleness of the character. It is in this sense that the samaʿ is considered, in Sufism, a universal message of love and peace for all humanity. Moulay Mourad al-­Qadiri Boudchich [leader of Tariqa Qadiriya Boutchichiya Samaʿ and Madih group].14\n\n32 Deborah Kapchan\n\nFor Moulay Mourad al-­Qadiri Boudchich, samaʿ is a pedagogy whose practice benefits not only the individual but society at large. It is a means of purification, a way of unveiling the secrets of the divine to the self and for the community. Akhlaq, good acts or ethics, is one of the stated goals of the Sufi in community, and the dhikr, or remembrance of God ceremony, polishes the heart so that right conduct and ethical behavior prevail. Part of this active cultivation of the ethical self is done through music. As one member of the order put it, “The pedagogy is in the songs. In the [Sufi] order, one learns through the music. Each song carries its own secret [within it].” It is not only the meaning of the words that creates community, however, since many of the members do not understand Arabic. Rather, the bodily technique of attentive listening cultivates an affective stance toward themselves and others. The meaning is of course important, but the power of the words does not depend on intellectual understanding. Rather, the songs live independent of any one interpretation. They are the vehicles of the sirr, the secrets of initiation. Learning the liturgy and the songs, the Sufi female devotees with whom I work (called faqirat, “the poor ones”) enter into a new community, one wherein ethics are learned, comportment is proscribed, and even marriages are made. Of course initiates do not hear everything and repeat it right away. Like most initiations, the technique of active listening is learned in stages. As the liturgy begins with the prayers, the faqirat also begin there, repeating only the initial words of each phrase. Slowly they add the endings of the phrases, and little by little the middle of the phrase is added, until the whole phrase is learned. Some phrases are easier than others. Arabic contains a lot of parallelism, and the phrases with it are easier to repeat. The high level of prosody in the liturgy aids the listener in its memorization. The process is not unlike second language acquisition in that French North African and French converts to Islam are immersed in an aural ritual all at once, one they do not understand referentially, but one they come to know intimately by repeated listening (Kapchan 2008). Foucault has provided a rubric for understanding this restructuration of the senses—namely, technologies of the self, “which permit individuals to effect by their own means or with the help of others a certain number of operations on their own bodies and souls, thoughts, conduct, and way of being, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, purity, wisdom, perfection, or immortality” (Foucault 1988). Foucault’s definition assumes autonomy of the subject. However, he understands that such technologies of the self are always imbricated in other power relations—of class, sociopolitical context, gender, and culture. Indeed, technologies of the self are often performed in common.15 Listening attentively becomes one such performance.\n\nListening Acts, Secul ar and Sacred 33\n\nThe repetition of the names of God is common among all Sufi groups. A rhythm is created in the beginning that remains fairly stable, though accelerations occur incrementally. This repetition and consequent phonetic parallelism is instrumental in changing the initiate’s “state” (al-hal) from a quotidian consciousness to an enraptured and trance-­like condition that they equate with divine communion. Indeed, experiencing al-­hal is one of the effects of the dhikr. What is interesting is that each devotee has her own hal. It goes a bit like this: The women are seated in a circle on the floor. They begin chanting vigorously: allah, allah, allah, allah. Between each utterance many actively push the air from their diaphragms in a kind of pumping motion. This makes their breath audible. All of a sudden, one of the women breaks with this rhythm. She calls out “allah” loudly, almost a scream. She has broken with the rhythm of the other chanters and is now punctuating their repetitions with short staccato exclamations. They seem to rise up from her body, to actually take possession of her with a volition of their own. She is in al-­hal, the state. Now things “heat up” so to speak. Another woman breaks from the rhythmic repetition moaning allah in long tones over the voices of the others. She rocks back and forth. Meanwhile, some women in the group have raised the pitch of their chanting by a semitone. Another woman is a full fourth above the majority. Although the goal is to chant with one voice, the women are in fact producing an aharmonic, chromaticized melody, creating overtones as well as counterrhythms as they go into al-­hal. This state is very personal; indeed, it is considered an intimate state to be experienced only in sex-­segregated rituals among initiates. Nonetheless, this state, this hal, is the very heart of the Boutshishiyya Sufi dhikr insofar as it represents a culmination of musical, emotional, and spiritual dimensions. It is also a key element in understanding how Sufis learn to listen, for despite the intensity of ecstatic performance, a subtle but very present auditory responsiveness remains acute. One hal brings on others. Punctuated cries respond to spontaneously clapped rhythms. Swoons are echoed around the circle. The repetition of the names of God in a regular ostinato rhythm provides the basis for collectively attaining a state of divine inspiration, but more singular “states” (ahwal) emerge in the spaces between the words. Sometimes a faqira might swoon and call out for God, sometimes another falls completely silent. Yet, at all points, the group is listening attentively. There is no explicit discourse about al-­hal (it is thought to be a spontaneous and individual expression of unity with God), but there is a rich fabric of sounds that result from the dhikr. The faqirat take these lessons in listening and apply them to learning the more difficult and less repetitive liturgy. Not only do the repetitions of the names of God get faster and rise in intonation,\n\n34 Deborah Kapchan\n\nbut the occurrence of al-­hal sparks a kind of chain reaction wherein women’s sporadic exclamations, their swoons and cries, respond to the exclamations of others. Attentive listening is the foundation of this improvisational performance. After three hours, the wadhifa ends with a prayer, the women kissing each other’s hands and saying, allah y-­qbal, may God accept [your prayers].16\n\nListening Act III: Sacred Song in Public Places A Sufi ritual is called a wadhifa. Literally a liturgy, the word comes from the root wa dha fa, or labor. According to Lévinas, liturgy is a work performed for the community, a labor in common (Lévinas 1982). In the Sufi liturgy, listening is part of this labor. It is an act that not only transforms the state of the listener but also the affective resonance of the group. As with many such endeavors, listening together holds a promise. In this case it is a promise of transcendence, a “messianic promise” to be sure, and one that, like all promises, is performative (Derrida 1985). Whether or not the promise is fulfilled, the very promissory character of the event effects social change. Among other promises, listening together in Sufi ritual holds the promise of community (Kapchan 2008).\n\nCreating a Sonic Community in Public View For the women in the Boutshishiyya order, the promise of community is enacted every time a song is sung. Community with other Sufis is an essential aspect of this religious practice. And the level of attentive listening employed in the ceremony imprints the body and its memory, so that merely hearing the sounds in one’s head is a thread that ties the listener to God, to the shaykh, and to the community as well (Kapchan 2009). The sounds take up residence in the body, and the Sufi can listen to them simply by “remembering” them (dhikr is that, “remembrance of God”). What happens then when these practices and these sounds travel outside the private sphere of the liturgy, particularly in a place like France where notions of secularism (laïcité) are so pronounced? How do individual and collective acts of listening turn into forms of “sound knowledge” in the larger public sphere? Sufi music is a well-­known and recognized genre in the world music market. This has several effects. The circulation of Sufi music—on stages, in festivals, on the Internet, and on compact discs—creates a niche and provides a means for sacred music to circulate in nonsacred spheres of listening. Musicians as diverse as the Gnawa of Morocco, as well as emerging female vocalists like Iraqi Sahar Taha, employ the adjective “Sufi” to describe their music. That Moroccan Gnawa music—music that usually accompanies trance possession\n\nListening Acts, Secul ar and Sacred 35\n\nceremonies in Morocco—accompanies a YouTube video entitled “Sufi Music from Senegal” that portrays not Sufi ceremonies, but images of Senegalese mosques, is only one of the many ironies in the usage and misusage of the category of “Sufi music.”17 The women in the Boutshishiyya Qadiriyya order in France have two singing groups. The first, Ensemble Rabia, is a group of French and French North African women whose repertoire is mainly drawn from the songs sung in the order, though they borrow from West African repertoires and take creative liberty with the songs. These women do not veil.18 The second is Silsila, a group primarily based in Paris whose repertoire is more conservative, remaining in the canon of Moroccan Sufi song without taking much creative liberty in stylistic innovation.19 These women do veil. Both these groups sing on stages and at festivals in France, places such as the Institute of Muslim Culture in Paris,20 the Lenche Theater in Marseille,21 and the Chatelêt Theater in Paris.22 Ensemble Rabia has produced two compact discs—Fleurs du Sirr (Flowers of the Secret), and Ismaʿ (“Listen”). The affect created in the labor of collective listening is tangible. Taken on stage it is also visible. The audiences for these concerts are diverse. They may be students, lovers of world music, people curious about Sufism, or friends of friends in the band. The concerts are free. I have attended a concert at the Nîmes Community Center with a very mixed audience, including spiritual seekers who stayed after the concert to eat the sweets provided by the women of the group, and I have been instrumental in organizing a concert at New York University’s campus in Paris, whose audience was composed of other Sufis, and of a few students and faculty or administrators at NYU Paris, one of whom was scandalized by the performance of what she considered a sacred ritual in the secular space of the university (Kapchan 2013). The young women in the group were all wearing long pink djellebas with matching headscarves. While this did not pre­sent a problem for me, I realized later that it might have been offensive to some audience members who were sympathetic to the French policy of not displaying any sartorial signs of religiosity in public institutions. Most audience members were members of the Sufi order. First and second generation North African men in casual pants and jackets, entered the [NYU] mansio"
