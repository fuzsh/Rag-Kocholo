random notes

Does anyone out there know what's gonna happen with the project that Steve Vai mentioned in Sept. guitar world, That is him, Bozzio + the Ensemble Moderne playing frank's 'complicated' stuff (i.e 'black page') in fall 94.

His band Vai toured Europe late 1993, then supposedly broke up, but apparently didn't and off to Japan in March 1994.

Vai's credits are quite extensive--he has (more than) 3 albums:

Flexible - The CD version has bonus tracks from "Flexible Leftovers". One of the tracks, "Bledsoe Bluvd," features Tommy Mars playing the violin and ejaculating "Thren keld, wing nut, why not rheam." Another track, "So Happy," features the infamous Laurel Fishman (see Real FZ Book), who is noted for the spherical shitball as well as her lifestyle (summed up in "Stevie's Spanking").

Passion and Warfare - Probably his best work.

Sex and Religion - The title made me decide not to buy it--that and I heard his music is primarily vocal now, bordering on "pop rock."

Aside from his solo material, he has also worked with David Lee Roth, on the album "Eat 'Em and Smile," and Whitesnake.

And then there is P.I.L's "Album" (later renamed to "Compact Disc" on CD).

The Ozzy project was canceled by the record company pricks. It's rumored that Zack Wilde will be doing it instead. Also Vai has a new album do out in June called alien love secrets, I have an advance copy and if you like Passion you definitely won't be disappointed.

Vai's work on PIL's stuff is great, as is his own earlier solo music - Passion & Warfare has its moments, the Sex/Religion one sucked to high heaven, and now (1995) he has a new album out, ALIEN LOVE SECRETS (sound familiar?) I hope this is better; a lot of the guitar `shredders' of the 1980s tried to move away from the image of `widdly widdly' guitar playing & little else by indulging in horrendous FM rock (Sex & Religion). I think this trend has stabilized now, so let's hope Alien Love Secrets is better. (Vai has also cut his hair short - a welcome relief from that metal cut he had!)

Check out Steve Vai's official website at http://www.vai.com ! This site was just nominated for Best Music Website by Hollywood Digital, along with sites from the likes of Madonna and The Rolling Stones! If you're a Vai fan, you have to check this out!

Fred "Blood Bros" speaketh:

Do you know that Fire Garden is Out ?

David Areval (valmaris@mnl.sequel.net) sez:

Steve Vai Has recently put out a new album, FIRE GARDEN. This collosal album (more than 73 min. long) will really satisfy fans who've been disapointed by the brevity of ALIEN LOVE SECRETS. There are two "phases", one which is instrumental(as always), and the other, on which exhibits Vai's hidden talent-his voice. Yup, he's singing on this one! Guitar fans shouldn't be dissapointed because he does have a good voice, and his guitar work is as phenomenal as ever.

From: RUBEN ARNAO RODRIGUEZ (930053@aloe.ulima.edu.pe)

I saw a CD recently of a concert with Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Eric Johnson ( G3 - Live ). They play the Zappa song "My guitar wants to kill your mama".

From: Andreas Klaer (klaer@irpsnc.ias.uni-stuttgart.de)

i've read following interview of guitarworld with s. vai:

Right before Frank Zappa passed away, he was putting together a project that included myself, Terry Bozzio and a bass player with this 35-piece ensemble out of Germany called the Ensemble Moderne. We were going to do all of Frank's most difficult music. There was this one piece called "Mo 'n' Herb's Vacation," which has really ridiculous, intimidating melodies. It was written for clarinet, which goes lower than the guitar, so I explained to Frank about the seven-string guitar. He got so excited because he knew I could play the melody on the seven-string. Unfortunately, it was the last project Frank started, and it never happened.

From: Jon M Hayes (Martok@ozemail.com.au)

Merry Axemas has been released, and proves two things: Steve Vai continues to get better as the seconds pass. Hail to thee. Joe Satriani is just getting older and staler. He sounds just the same as he did 10 years ago. R.I.P.

From: Simon Westaway (s.westaway@virgin.net)

Steve Vai and Vinnie Colaiuta both appear on a Hendrix project called "in from the storm", along with the likes of Steve Lukather, Stanley Clarke, Sting, Carlos Santanna etc. (Source: I bought it on CD this morning in Malta International airport). Vinnie plays on "The wind cries Mary", and Vai plays on "Drifting" (with Corey Glover from Living Colour on vocals).

From: "." (plainsongs@aol.com)

He plans to tour starting in September, and his site is located at www.vai.com. He also has a great newsletter called Greasy Kid's Stuff which goes out three times a year and contains info the site does not, they're kinda brother/sister publications.

Steve Vai appears on the "Halo 2, Volume Two" soundtrack - a follow-up to "Halo 2, Volume One" soundtrack album - which also featured Steve's guitar work. Steve contributes guitar parts to the track "Reclaimer" which was recorded during the initial Halo sessions in Seattle in October 2003, but remained unreleased until now.

"Halo 2" Music Composer Martin ODonnell explains: In the summer of 2004, Nile Rodgers and I decided that it would be a good idea to present the music of "Halo 2" in two separate volumes. The first volume would contain all the music that was finished and mixed plus some inspired by music from music groups whose music was being used in the game.

Since the first soundtrack was assembled before the game actually shipped, the second volume would contain the rest of the music, some that I was still composing and producing, and would be arranged for maximum listening pleasure. The music in Halo 2 will play back a little differently each time someone plays the game but on the soundtrack, I have the opportunity to arrange the music in a way that will never change.

Halo 2, Volume Two will be released on April 25, 2006.

Hi Folks,

Well, I was sitting here thinking, it's been a while since I was out there with my own band playing a full show, but would it make sense to tour on an orchestra record since that's what's being released?

If I don't get out for at least a little bit now, it may not be another 2 years before I get a chance to.

What if I just do a quick stint of Europe and the US? Yeah, I'm feeling that need to get out and play for you all again.

OKAY - HOW ABOUT THESE SHOWS BELOW?

Jun 28 - Luxembourg

Jun 29 - Paris, France

Jun 30 - Biddinghuizen, Netherlands

Jul 02 - Ingolstadt, Germany

Jul 03 - Ulm, Germany

Jul 05 - Barcelona, Spain

Jul 06 - Valencia, Spain

Jul 07 - Murcia, Spain

Jul 08 - Bergara, Spain

Jul 09 - Porto, Portugal

Jul 10 - Lisbon, Portugal

Jul 11 - Madrid, Spain

Jul 13 - To Be Announced

Jul 14 - Udine, Italy

Jul 15 - Pistoia, Italy

Jul 16 - Rome, Italy

Jul 18 - To Be Announced

Jul 19 - Wolverhampton, UK

Jul 20 - Manchester, UK

Jul 21 - Nottingham, UK

Jul 22 - London, UK

Jul 24 - Dublin, Ireland

Jul 26 - To Be Announced

Jul 28 - Moscow, Russia

We'll announce venues shortly, check the Vai.com Tour Dates page for links to tickets for Holland and France which are on sale now. There are still a few cities to be confirmed above, and we'll announce US dates later.

WILL THERE BE AN EVO EXPERIENCE?

I enjoyed the last one very much and I do have some ideas for a new one. Let's do it! Unfortunately we can't do EVO for festival shows. For shows already on sale (like Paris) EVO Experience passes will be sold separately from tickets.

WHAT ABOUT THE BAND?

Hmmm, well, since it's a relatively short tour it might be a good opportunity to do something different and perhaps change the band up.

It's tough. The Breed is like a family to me and although I know that we can probably get together anytime and do a gig or tour, this is may be a good opportunity to try something a little different. Tony and Billy won't be joining me on this run - but they are actually doing a project together and you won't want to miss them when they tour Europe in October!

So, since there is no studio album with a firm band that I'm touring on, anything goes. I'm thinking of having a violin player in the band that can understand how to play like a violin player but still rip it up when necessary. Imagine some of those guitar lines doubled with a violin. That's pretty strung up!

Well, let's see how auditions go.

WHAT MUSIC ARE WE GOING TO PLAY?

I guess a lot of this will have to do with who the band ends up being, but whatever it is I would like to do a lot of songs that have never been performed live before, such as "Die to Live," "Lucky Charms," the last movement of the "Fire Garden Suite" etc. I'm sure we can do some things from the new Sound Current CD. I have a feeling "The Murder" may be pretty harmonically defiant.

WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT RECORD?

When I jump into "Real Illusions Part 2," it's going to take quite some time to finish it so perhaps we can record a live record from this tour with all new songs, similar to the way we did "Alive in an Ultra World". I only hope that I can walk that walk after talking the talk.

We can record new songs one at a time per show.

Okay then, new tour, new band, new music and a new live recording, and you're all invited! And I am going to request that this tour is an "All Ages" event in every city. I'm hoping this will be possible.

Keep an eye on Vai.com for more info.

Steve Vai - "Naked Tracks"

Naked Tracks Vol. 1-5, is a series of recording packages that contain mixes of Steve's songs without the lead guitars. They are offered as "play along tracks." Included are select backing tracks from Passion and Warfare, Sex & Religion, Alien Love Secrets, Fire Garden, The Ultra Zone, Alive In An Ultra World, Real Illusions: Reflections and others.

Steve comments on the package: "Through the years, whenever I would mix my records I would usually do a mix of specific songs without the lead guitar. This allowed me to play along with the track or make loops to jam to, and because I figured perhaps someday maybe others would like to do the same. Voila! We have arrived at someday.

"Playing to these naked tracks, or creating loops of various sections, to endlessly meander over, is a phenomenal way to discover unique musical ideas from within yourself.

"When we are playing an instrument and our mind enters that exclusive elusive mental real estate of our own personal muse, it can result in a form of musical meditation.

"This series of play-along CDs is designed to help create an atmosphere of focus so you can shred yourself into a personally-induced inspirational nirvana.

"For the most part, the tracks in this series are presented in their original form with the lead guitar removed. In some cases I looped the solo sections to give you an opportunity to stretch out. I suggest you import these files into a sequencer program of sorts, (ProTools, Band, etc.) and create loops of various parts of the songs to jam over. It's an excellent way to develop your inner musical ear.

"All 5 disks will be offered together in one package at various retail stores, through Vai.com, or can be downloaded by various tracks or volumes at any of the online digital stores (such as the iTunes Music Store.)"

Keep checking Vai.com in the coming weeks for the Naked Tracks mini-site with information about each track, as well as links to download the tracks, or order the 5-CD package...

K'm-Pee-Du-Wee - Live In Poland

Performing in countries through Eastern Europe is an adventure. We usually travel over night to the next city after the previous gig. In this situation we were coming from a gig in Vilnius, Lithuania and driving overnight for a day off in Katowice Poland. The day after that we had a show scheduled for Zabrze, Poland.

The video goals on the Real Illusions tour (among some other colorful celluloid exploits) was to capture a unique kind of performance for each song on the Real Illusions CD. Since K'm-Pee-Du-Wee was already released on a G3 DVD from Japan, I wanted to offer a different type of performance video other than a live concert setting for that song. Never having been to Katowice Poland (oddly enough), I thought it would be a cool idea to just show up and set up a little trio combo somewhere outside of the hotel in the street, unannounced, and just jam on K'm-Pee.

The band and crew were real sports about it. Mikey Mesker shot some entertaining footage and although the equipment we used to perform with looked a little anemic, it was mic'ed properly and heavily EQ-ed so the sound we captured is actually pretty good.

We just jammed through the song a few times and I cut it together. I think it turned out charming with some striking moments. The citizens of downtown Katowice took very little interest in what we were doing.

DIDN'T THEY KNOW WHO WE WERE???? Maybe not.

The full 12 minute version of "K'm-Pee-Du-Wee - Live In Poland" will be available through the iTunes Music Store very soon. In the meantime, check out a teaser trailer on the official Steve Vai YouTube Channel!

http://www.youtube.com:80/watch?v=OnjLyfj8nAg

We will also be making all of Steve's official promo videos available through iTunes, along with select cuts from the Live At The Astoria London DVD, and all videos from the Alien Love Secrets DVD.

Regie: Arjan Vlakveld

NPS Televisie (nu NTR)

Arjan Vlakveld, regisseur van verrassende, ontroerende of ontluisterende mini-documentaires met achtergrondverhalen over bijvoorbeeld de Top 2000 a gogo hits, stort zich dit keer op het verhaal van een instrument. Over hoe een houten plank met snaren en een element kon uitgroeien tot een object met een bijkans mythische status. Over pioniers Les Paul en Leo Fender en de rivaliteit tussen gitaarbouwers Fender, Gibson en Rickenbacker. Wat is de impact van nou juist gitaristen als Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly en Eric Clapton op de popcultuur en wat maakt Jimi Hendrix, die als eerste en plein public zijn gitaar aan diggelen sloeg, nou zo invloedrijk. En dan de angstige vraag of tegenwoordig de gitaar nog wel hip & happening is.
