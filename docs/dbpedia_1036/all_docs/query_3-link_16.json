Since everyone wants to know about the Guardian endorsements, which don’t come out until next week, we got to talking about District 9, where three good candidates are contending to succeed Sup. Tom Ammiano, who is heading to Sacramento and the state Legislature. One of the Avalos workers was supporting Eric Quezada. The other was supporting Mark Sanchez. “But were still friends,” the Sanchez backer said. The supervisorial races would be very different without ranked- choice voting. There are people who like the relatively new system, which allows voters to choose three candidates in ranked order. There are people who think it’s too confusing, or leads to the wrong outcome. But I think I can say, as someone who lives in District 9 and is in the epicenter of that very heated campaign, that a race that offers voters a choice between Sanchez, Quezada, and David Campos — any of whom would make an excellent supervisor, and all of whom have different strengths to offer — wouldn’t be possible under a traditional electoral system. Three progressive candidates in an old-fashioned election might very well split the left vote, and leave the door open for someone like Eva Royale — a much less appeal¬ ing candidate who’s backed by the mayor.

The big landlords’ blackmail The Chronicle manufactures a crisis By Robert Haaland and Sofia Lee Morales OPINION “Illegal Alien.” “Drug¬ dealing illegal immigrant youth.” “Criminal youth.” How many times have these dehumanizing words appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle in the last few months? Through unbal¬ anced and sensationalist coverage of this handful of youth, the Chronicle is manufacturing a crisis in San Francisco. Writers like right-wing Chronicle columnist Cinnamon Stillwell and others are creating a mob mentality that is driving city policy and aims to distort and gut the intent of the Sanctuary City laws, which exist to preserve public safety in face of the challenging consequences of globalization. Globalization has shown us that our world is a web of dynamic relationships. The consequences of the economic decisions made by governing bodies around the world include both the facilita¬ tion of movement for goods and services across national borders and the increased policing when that movement involves people; access to inexpensive products due to exploit¬ ative labor practices; and the exac¬ erbation of global poverty, a form of systemic violence. As we locally tackle the chal¬ lenges imposed on us, we need to speak out against fearmongering journalism. Demonizing youth will not bring justice to families who have experienced loss from the actions of documented (or undocumented) individuals. That pain is real and cries out for redress. Individuals are accountable for their actions. While the Juvenile Courts are not perfect, they are where minors accused of committing crimes are held accountable. The city needs to return authority over these children to the appropriate courts, which are legally mandated to consider the circumstances of each minor on a case-by-case basis to make a ruling, CONTINUES ON PAGE 6 » EDITORIAL The landlords who are threatening the San Francisco General Hospital bond are thugs, and the supervisors and the mayor need to hold firm and refuse to pay their blackmail. It’s almost too amazing to believe — an organization financed and controlled by the big¬ gest residential property owners in town is trying to hold Proposition A — without which the city’s entire public health system will collapse — hostage to an unrelated policy dispute. The landlords, represented by the Coalition for Better Housing, want the city to let them pass increased sewer charges through to their tenants. The sewer charges, a 9 percent hike, will pay for the massive rebuild of the city’s aging water and sewer infrastructure. The supervisors have been reluctant to allow the pass-through, and for good reason. Even in this slack housing market, landlords in San Francisco have a great deal. Rents are strong, even rising, as would-be homebuyers find it hard to get financing. Property values in this city seem immune to the mar¬ ket forces that are devastating hous¬ ing markets elsewhere. And the big property owners who run the coalition can hardly claim they are having problems making ends meet — most own hundreds of units and are very wealthy. They’ve all done quite well, thank you, under the George W. Bush tax cuts. And they prosper under Proposition 13, which keeps their property taxes artificially low. We have no sympathy at all for big landlords who complain about paying a few bucks extra for public services. And it’s staggering to think that some of the richest people in San Francisco would be whining about what amounts to about $6 a month increase per apartment. But we’ve seen these same folks take greed to mind-bending levels in the past, and we’re seeing it again now. The landlord group has filed papers to oppose Prop. A — and while virtually every elected official and community group in the city agrees that rebuilding San Francisco General is a top priority, a bond act needs 66 percent of the vote. And while polls show support for Prop. A at more than 75 percent right now, a well-funded and deceptive landlord campaign could trim that margin by enough to sink the measure. So the Mayor’s Office is push¬ ing the supervisors hard to come up with a compromise that would let the landlords pass half the new sewage costs along to their tenants. That’s a bad idea, and the board should stay firm. Property owners benefit when the city’s infrastructure is improved. They have immensely favorable tax CONTINUES ON PAGE 7 » SEND YOUR LETTERS TO: 135 MISSISSIPPI ST. SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94107 LETTERS@SFBG.COM LETTERS THE DECLINE AND FALL OF AMERICA I was born one year before Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941, and grew up believing my country was the best in the world. I was a patriotic and proud citizen who thought democracy was provably the best government system in the world and practiced the right way only in the USA. I remem¬ ber watching President Dwight Eisenhower warn our nation as he left office almost half a century ago that the military-industrial complex posed dangers we couldn’t begin to imagine. Then came Nixon, Reagan, and the first Bush — and the last eight years have seen the erosion of everything I thought represented this country. Now the economic collapse of Wall Street appears to be the crowning achievement of the Republican Party, which has abandoned all principle and prac¬ tice of responsibility. Eight years ago, the largest government bailout in US history had been the savings and loan collapse. Things seemed to get better after that, and for a quar¬ ter-century, prosperity seemed to rule the roost. Eight years ago, a conservative religious cabal, led by George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, with a kitchen cabinet made of up neocon insiders and wealthy businesspeople with shady ethical backgrounds, came into power and launched a holy war against another fundamentalist power structure. America began a rapid descent into economic and moral bankruptcy similar to what was so well portrayed in The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. In a matter of weeks, Wall Street became insolvent and with¬ out a rudder. This same leadership that took us to that war in the oil-producing Arab world quickly decided that CONTINUES ON PAGE 7 » SFBG.COM/EDITORIALS 5 EDITOR'S NOTES CONT» to run, and their backers would be running around trying to cut the other folks off at the knees. In this case, though, one of the three good guys is going to win — and it will probably be the one who gets the most second-place votes. So if s in everyone’s interest not to go negative. If Sanchez, say, started to attack Quezada, the Quezada backers would get mad and leave Sanchez off their ballots — and that would hurt Sanchez when the second-place votes are counted. So everyone has been pretty well behaved in D9; I’ve heard a few whispers here and there, and a few people have tossed off a few nasty comments, but overall the candi¬ dates and their supporters recognize that it’s better to stay positive. So let me shift for a second to District 3. There’s a real threat in Chinatown-North Beach, and his name is Joe Alioto. As the brother of Sup. Michela Alioto-Pier, the nephew of former Sup. Angela Alioto, and the grandson of the late mayor Joe, Alioto has a legend¬ ary political name. He also has big downtown backing. And his poli¬ tics are, if anything, to the right of his sister, who is one of the worst members of the current board. Based on polls I’ve heard about, there are two candidates who have a chance to beat him — David Chiu and Denise McCarthy. Chiu, a member of the Small Business Commission, will almost cer¬ tainly get hammered by down¬ town. McCarthy, who has run the Telegraph Hill Neighborhood Center for many years, may get hit, too. And this one, like D9, will come down to the second-place votes. The last thing McCarthy and Chiu can afford is to attack each other. There’s been some of that going on, and it has to stop. If the progressives want to win District 3, Chiu and McCarthy have to realize that, like it or not, they are a team, sfbg CHRONICLE CONT» which may include placement in foster care, in a group home, release to a local family, or return to a fam¬ ily out of the country — and if the young person is found guilty of a felony, a transfer to federal immi¬ gration officials.

There’s no good argument for allowing the pass-through — and there’s a very good argument for blocking it.

The board needs to call the landlords’ bluff.

Stu Smith San Francisco THE END OF MEAT Will 2008 mark the beginning of the end for the US meat industry? The escalating costs of corn and soybeans caused by harvest shortfalls, rising global demand, and government-mandated ethanol production are forcing widespread cutbacks in the number of animals raised for food. A recent report by the presti¬ gious Pew Charitable Trusts rec¬ ommends a phase-out of intensive confinement, which would force additional cutbacks. For animals and caring con¬ sumers, such cuts are long overdue. The 10 billion animals killed for food in the United States each year have no life before death. From birth, they are caged and crowded, deprived and drugged, manhandled and mutilated. At the slaughterhouse, they may be scalded, bled, skinned, and dis¬ membered while still conscious. Although 93 percent of consumers condemn such abuses, no state or federal law prevents them. On or about Oct. 2 (Gandhi’s birthday), 400 communities in all 50 states and two dozen other countries will observe World Farm Animals Day with public educa¬ tion events (see www.WFAD. org). The purpose is to expose and memorialize the cruel treatment of animals raised for food and to pro¬ mote an animal-free diet.

In what could be his first move toward the mayor’s seat, Don Perata’s political machine is working overtime to elect one of its own to Oakland’s City Council Kerry HamilPs campaign has a high profile in Oakland, thanks in part to support from allies of her old boss, Don Perata. ByJ.B. Powell > jesse@sfbg.com Big money is flowing into an Oakland City Council campaign, fueling rumors that state Senate President Don Perata might be pre¬ paring for a Willie Brown-style move from Sacramento kingpin to Bay Area mayor. Perata’s former chief of staff Kerry Hamill is vying for the city’s at-large council seat, running against AC Transit board member Rebecca Kaplan. Two independent expendi¬ ture committees with possible links to Perata are laying out tens of thou¬ sands of dollars on HamiH’s behalf. Sources say Perata has been fundrais¬ ing for his ex-staffer, as has Oakland City Council President Ignacio De La Fuente, a longtime Perata loyalist. And it appears one of De La Fuente’s efforts to raise cash may have skirted the boundaries of state law. The stakes for De La Fuente are definitely high. Hamill’s elec¬ tion would help him retain his role as president of the closely divided council. But the scuttlebutt around Oakland is that a successful Hamill candidacy could have bigger implica¬ tions. It might just pave the way for something many local observers see as inevitable: a Perata run for mayor. Current Mayor Ron Dellums is reeling from a spike in violent crime, huge budget deficits, and a detached leadership style, all of which is fuel¬ ing a nascent recall movement. Perata will be termed out of state office this year and has made no secret of his interest in Oakland’s top job, despite allegedly being the target of an ongo¬ ing political corruption investigation by the FBI. Having a powerful col¬ league like Hamill on the council, while keeping De La Fuente in con¬ trol of the body, could make a run for mayor attractive to Perata (who didn’t return our calls for comment). “He’s going to run. Everybody knows he’s going to run,” Oakland City Attorney John Russo told the Guardian , adding that the flurry of campaigning for Hamill is “absolutely a signal” of Perata’s mayoral ambi¬ tions. “That group of people [Perata and his allies] clearly see their inter¬ ests lying with Kerry.” Reached for comment, Hamill said, “Don’s supporting me because I’m the best candidate.... Whether it is for selfish reasons like making sure the right people for him are on the council or not, I believe he is support¬ ing me because he likes my work.” OUTSIDE INFLUENCE If you live in Oakland or have spent any time there recently, chances are you’ve seen the pro-Hamill campaign signs promising “Safe Neighborhoods Now” affixed to fences and lampposts all over town. Oakland mailboxes have been stuffed with flyers backing Hamill’s candidacy. The signs and some of the other materials position Hamill in opposition to Dellums more than Kaplan, with one mail piece hammering the current mayor for his handling of the city’s recent crime wave. Hamids campaign did not pro¬ duce the signs or much of the litera¬ ture championing her. Instead, two newly formed independent expendi¬ ture committees doled out more than $87,000 on her behalf in the first half of this year alone. The groups are not required to disclose their recent spending until Oct. 6, but given the volume of material being generated, there is little doubt their combined outlays will top $100,000 for the year. Hamid told us that outside groups are also aiding her opponent Kaplan, though she did not name them. Our examination of campaign records found that the California Nurses Association paid $24,535 for a pro- Kaplan mailer in May. “That’s definitely a lot of money,” Alameda County supervisor Keith Carson told us, referring to the spending in support of Hamid. “It certainly raises your antenna. In any campaign when you have two sepa¬ rate entrants putting resources in, you pause and ask, ‘What’s behind it?’ ” On the surface the two groups CONTINUES ON PAGE 15 » spencer & Janierfwm.oJf Great Brands at Great Prices text “wine” to 33777 ®1541 polk street @ California • 415 . 345.1623 • spenceranddaniels.com 1 A • Jan Kris 2004 Estate Zinfandel - $2.99 • Coyote Creek 2006 Chardonnay - $3.99 • Chateau Julien 2001 Sangiovese - $4.99 • Le Snoot 2005 Merlot - $4.99 • Red Tree 2006 Pinot Grigio - $5.99 Live music benelitibrPmposition H, Switch on Clean Energy!

But recent media reports and a Guardian examination of campaign finance records reveal several ties between both organizations and Hamids old boss, Perata. The first group, which calls itself Californians for Good Jobs, Clean Streets, and Outstanding Schools, displays clear Perata associations. The group’s treasurer is Mark Capitolo, who used to be Perata’s director of communications. Many of its donors consistently give to Perata’s numer¬ ous political action committees. And its campaign documents list a Sacramento phone number that, as the East Bay Express reported in May, belongs to Perata’s chief political strategist, Sandra Polka. Polka and employees of her con¬ sulting business appear to be deeply involved in the senator’s affairs. When we called Perata’s Sacramento office seeking comment for this story, we were told to contact Paul Hefner, who works for Polka’s firm. Polka, Hefner, De La Fuente, Capitolo, and Californians for Good Jobs president, Hilda Martinez, did not return our calls for comment. Perata’s links to the second group, known as Oakland Jobs PAC, are not as immediately apparent, and one person involved with the group denied that the legislator is aiding their cause. But an inspection of disclosure forms did yield evidence of the legislator’s potential influence. In mid-May, Oakland Jobs received its first $10,000 from another politi¬ cal action committee known as Vote Matters. As the Contra Costa Times reported, Vote Matters spent more than $175,000 earlier this year try¬ ing to pass Proposition 93, which would have allowed Perata and other termed-out state politicians to remain in office. Perata strongly supported the measure, which did not pass. Robert Apodaca, who called himself a “personal friend” of Perata’s, informed the Guardian that he rec¬ ommended that Vote Matters provide the money to Oakland Jobs. Apodaca is director of marketing for the archi¬ tecture and planning firm MVE and Associates, which designed the huge Oak to Ninth Project along the Oakland waterfront. Perata passed key legislation that allowed the project to move forward, though it has yet to be built. Oakland Jobs donor Signature Properties is one of the project’s lead developers and, according to the East Bay Express , Oakland Jobs’ treasurer Sean Welch has worked for Signature Properties in the past. Signature Properties has also been a donor to Perata’s politi¬ cal committees, as have several other Oakland Jobs contributors. In addition to his work for MVE and what he deemed his “unpaid advisor” relationship with Vote Matters, Apodaca is listed as a paid campaign consultant for a now-defunct committee called the “California Latino Leadership Fund” (CLLF). CLLF employed Polka as well as Apodaca in 2006 and 2007. Polka is now working on behalf of the other committee backing Hamill this year, Californians for Good Jobs, Safe Streets, and Outstanding Jobs. DEVELOPERS 1 DEEP POCKETS Apodaca told us he could not remem¬ ber why he pushed for Vote Matters, which normally supports state candi¬ dates and initiatives, to give money to a local committee like Oakland Jobs. But he was certain that Perata played no part in it. “He’s not involved in [the committee’s decisions]. He’s not even in the room.” But a well-placed East Bay source told us Perata was in the room with Oakland Jobs-affiliated figures while money was being sought to support Hamill. The source, who asked not to be identified, said Perata was part of a breakfast meeting several months ago at the downtown offices of the Oakland law firm of Wendel, Rosen, Black and Dean, at which De La Fuente asked a group of prominent developers to give large sums of money to an independent expenditure committee that would back Hamill. The source could not recall if the committee was named by De La Fuente or anyone else at the meet¬ ing. But according to the source, pro-development activist Greg McConnell was there. McConnell told us he is involved in running Oakland Jobs. His business, the McConnell Group, has received funding from the group. The source also said representatives from Signature Properties and developer Forest Hill, another Oakland Jobs donor, were in attendance and that De La Fuente expressed an interest in raising “over a hundred grand” for the race. A second source confirmed that Perata was at the meeting in question but did not recall De La Fuente ask¬ ing for the funds, though the second source did say De La Fuente has subsequently called seeking money for Hamill’s campaign. Reached for comment, McConnell asserted that Perata is not involved with Oakland Jobs. He said a morning meeting did take place at the Wendel, Rosen firm “a couple of weeks ago,” during which Perata asked the developers in attendance to contribute directly to Hamids campaign. But according to McConnell, Perata left the room before De La Fuente made a pitch to fund independent expenditures. Direct contributions to candidates are limited to $600 per donor in Oakland. Independent groups like Oakland Jobs are not subject to those restrictions. 'NOT KOSHER 1 In addition to learning of De La Fuente’s alleged fundraising pitch at a recent developers’ meeting, the Guardian has obtained a letter from De La Fuente to potential Hamill donors asking them to attend a $600- a-head event Oct. 2. Nothing in the letter itself, dated Sept. 16, appears to violate any campaign finance rules. But it is printed on what appears to be official City of Oakland letter¬ head, complete with the official seal. That could mean trouble for De La Fuente. “That’s not kosher,” Mark Morodomi, the supervising deputy in the Oakland city attorney’s office, told us. State law prohibits the use of government resources for politi¬ cal campaigning. Before coming to Oakland, Morodomi spent 10 years at the California Fair Political Practices Commission, the state’s campaign- finance watchdog. A line in small type on the bottom of the letter reads, “Not printed or mailed at public expense.” Morodomi said the phrase “comes close” to making the use of city let¬ terhead permissible, but he added, “It doesn’t inoculate him. Magic lan¬ guage doesn’t automatically make it okay ... those words have to be true.” According to Morodomi, if any part of generating and disseminating the missive involved taxpayer-funded resources — from printing costs to paper, envelopes, or stamps — De La Fuente would be in violation of the law. Using Oakland’s official seal could also be problematic. Hamill dismissed concerns that the invitation tested the limits of the law: “I’ve been around for 20 years, and I’ve seen council members use that kind of stationary for fundraisers all the time.” But City Attorney Russo, Morodomi’s boss, that even if the letter turns out to be technically legal because no public resources were used, he is uncomfortable with De La Fuente’s decision to mix fundrais¬ ing with official city documentation: “It’s not great form. You have to be really mindful as to how it would appear.” sfbg Guardian interns Katie Baker and Anna Rendall contributed to this report.

That’s the common thread of many unreported stories last year, according to an analysis by Project Censored. Since 1976, Sonoma State University has released an annual survey of the top 25 stories the mainstream media failed to report or report¬ ed poorly. Culled from worldwide alternative news sources, vetted by students and faculty, and ranked by judges, the stories were not nec¬ essarily overtly censored. But their controversial subjects, challenges to the status quo, or general under-the-radar subject matter might have kept them from the front pages. Project Censored recounts them, accompanied by media analysis, in a book of the same name published annually by Seven Stories Press. “This year, war and civil liberties stood out,” Peter Phillips, project director since 1996, said of the top stories. “They’re closely related and part of the War on Terror that has been the dominant theme of Project Censored for seven years, since 9/11.” Whether it’s preventing what one piece of legislation calls “homegrown terrorism” by federally funding the study of radicalism, using vague concerns about security to quietly expand NAFTA, or refusing to count the number of Iraqi civilians killed in the war, the threat of terrorism is being used to silence people and expand power. “The war on terror is a sort of mind ter¬ ror,” said Nancy Snow, one of the project’s 24 judges and an associate professor of public diplomacy at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. Snow — who has taught classes on war, media, and propaganda — elaborated: “You can’t declare war on terror. It’s a tactic used by groups to gain publicity and it will remain with us. But it’s unlikely that [the number of terrorist acts] will spike. It spikes in the minds of people.” She pointed out that the number of terror¬ ist attacks has dropped worldwide since 2003. Some use the absence of fresh attacks as evi¬ dence that the so-called war on terror is work¬ ing. But a RAND Corporation study for the Department of Defense released in August said the war on terror hasn’t effectively undermined A1 Qaeda. It suggested the phrase be replaced with the less loaded term “counterterrorism.” Both Phillips and Snow agree that compre¬ hensive, contextual reporting is missing from most of the coverage. “That’s one of my criti¬ cisms of the media,” Snow said. “They spotlight issues and don’t look at the entire landscape.” This year the landscape of Project Censored itself is expanding. After talking with educators who bemoan the ongoing decline of news quali¬ ty and want to help, Phillips launched the Truth Emergency Project, in which Sonoma State partners with 23 other universities. All will host classes for students to search out untold stories, vet them for accuracy, and submit them for con¬ sideration to Project Censored. “There’s a renaissance of independent media,” Phillips said. He thinks bloggers and citizen journalists are filling crucial roles left vacant by staff cutbacks throughout the main¬ stream media. And, he said, it’s time for uni¬ versities, educators, and media experts to step in and help. “It’s not just reforming the media, but supporting them in as many ways as they need, like validating stories by fact-checking.” The Truth Emergency Project will also host a news service that aggregates the top 12 inde¬ pendent media sources and posts them on one page. “So you can get an RSS feed from all the major independent news sources we trust,” he said. Discerning newshounds can find report¬ ing from the BBC, Democracy Now!, and Inter Press Service (IPS) in one spot. “The whole criteria,” he said, “is no corporate media.” Carl Jensen, who started Project Censored in 1976, said the expansion is a new and nec¬ essary phase. “It answers the question I was always challenged with: how do you know this is the truth? Having 24 campuses reviewing all the stories and raising questions really provides a good answer. These stories will be vetted more than Sarah Palin.” Phillips said he hopes to expand to 100 schools within the year, and would like the proj¬ ect to bring more attention to the dire need for public support for high quality news reporting. “I think it’s going to require government sub¬ sidies and nonprofit organizations doing com¬ munity media projects,” he said. “It’s more than just reforming at the FCC level. It’s building independent media from the ground up.” Phillips likens it to the boom in micro- brewed beer and the spread of independently- owned pubs: “If we can have a renaissance in beer-making, following established purity stan¬ dards, then we can do it with our media, too.” But for now, we have Project Censored, whose top 10 underreported stories for 2008 are: 1. HOW MANY IRAQIS HAVE DIED? Nobody knows exactly how many lives the Iraq War has claimed. But even more astounding is that so few journalists have mentioned the issue or cited the top estimate: 1.2 million. During August and September 2007, Opinion Research Business, a British polling group, surveyed 2,414 adults in 15 of 18 Iraqi provinces and found that more than 20 percent had experienced at least one war-related death since March 2003. Using common statistical study methods, it determined that as many as 1.2 million people had been killed since the war began. The US military, claiming it keeps no count, still employs civilian death data as a marker of progress. For example, in a Sept. 10, 2007, report to Congress, Gen. David Petraeus said, “Civilian deaths of all categories, less natu¬ ral causes, have also declined considerably, by over 45 percent Iraq-wide since the height of the sectarian violence in December.” But whose number was he using? Estimates range wildly and are based on a variety of sources, including hospital, morgue, and media reports, as well as in-person surveys. In October 2006, the British medical jour¬ nal Luncet published a Johns Hopkins University study vetted by four independent sources that counted 655,000 dead, based on interviews with 1,849 households. It updated a similar study from 2004 that counted 100,000 dead. The Associated Press called it “controversial.” The AP began its own count in 2005 and by 2006 said that at least 37,547 Iraqis had lost their lives due to war-related violence, but called it a minimum estimate at best and didn’t include insurgent deaths. Iraq Body Count, a group of US and UK citizens who aggregate numbers from media reports on civilian deaths, puts the figure between 87,000 and 95,000. In January 2008, the World Health Organization and the Iraqi government did door-to-door surveys of nearly 10,000 households and put the number of dead at 151,000. The 1.2 million figure is out there, too, which is higher than the Rwandan genocide death toll and closing in on the 1.7 million who perished in Cambodia’s killing fields. It raises questions about the real number of deaths from US aerial bombings and house raids, and chal¬ lenges the common assumption that this is a war in which Iraqis are killing Iraqis. Justifying the higher number, Michael Schwartz, writing on the blog AfterDowningStreet.org, pointed to a fact reported by the Brookings Institute that US troops have, over the past four years, conducted 16 SAN FRANCISCO BAY GUARDIAN | OCTOBER 1 - 7, 2008 NEWS + CULTURE about 100 house raids a day — a number that has recently increased with assistance from Iraqi soldiers. Brutality during these house searches has been documented by returning soldiers, Iraqi civilians, and independent journalists (See #9 below). Schwartz suggests the aggressive “ele¬ ment of surprise” tactics employed by soldiers is likely resulting in several thousands of deaths a day that either go unreported or are categorized as insurgent casualties. The spin is having its intended effect: a February 2007 AP poll showed Americans gave a median estimate of 9,890 Iraqi deaths as a result of the war, a number far below that cited in any credible study. Sources: “Is the United States killing 10,000 Iraqis every month? Or is it more?” Michael Schwartz, After Downing Street.org, July 6, 2007; “Iraq death toll rivals Rwanda Genocide, Cambodian killing fields,” Joshua Holland, AlterNet, Sept. 17, 2007; “Iraq conflict has killed a million: survey,” Luke Baker, Reuters, Jan. 30, 2008; “Iraq: Not our country to return to,”Maki al-NazzalandDahr Jamail, Inter Press Service, March 3, 2008. 2. NAFTA ON STEROIDS Coupling the perennial issue of security with Wall Street’s measures of prosperity, the lead¬ ers of the three North American nations con¬ vened the Security and Prosperity Partnership. The White House-led initiative — launched at a March 23, 2005, meeting of President Bush, Mexico’s then-president Vicente Fox, and Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin — joins beefed-up commerce with coordinated military operations to promote what it calls “borderless unity.” Critics call it “NAFTA on steroids.” However, unlike NAFTA, the SPP was formed in secret, without public input. “The SPP is not a law, or a treaty, or even a signed agreement,” Laura Carlsen wrote in a report for the Center for International Policy. “All these would require public debate and par¬ ticipation of Congress, both of which the SPP has scrupulously avoided.” Instead the SPP has a special workgroup: the North American Competitiveness Council. It’s a coalition of private companies that are, according to the SPP Web site, “adding high- level business input [that] will assist govern¬ ments in enhancing North America’s competi¬ tive position and engage the private sector as partners in finding solutions.” The NACC includes the Chevron Corporation, Ford Motor Company, General Electric, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Merck & Co. Inc., New York Life Insurance Co., Procter & Gamble Co., and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. “Where are the environmental council, the labor council, and the citizen’s council in this process?” Carlsen asked. A look at NAFTA’s unpopularity among citizens in all three nations is evidence of why its expansion would need to be disguised. “It’s a scheme to create a borderless North American Union under US control without barriers to trade and capital flows for corporate giants, mainly US ones,” wrote Steven Lendman in Global Research. “It’s also to insure America gets free and unlimited access to Canadian and Mexican resources, mainly oil, and in the case of Canada, water as well.” Sources: “Deep Integration,”Laura Carlsen, Center for International Policy, May 30, 2007; “The Militarization and Annexation of North America,” Stephen Lendman, Global Research , July 19, 2007; “The North American Union,” Constance Fogal, Global Research, Aug. 2, 2007. 3. INFRAGARD GUARDS ITSELF The FBI and Department of Homeland Security have effectively deputized 23,000 members of the business community, asking them to tip off the feds in exchange for prefer¬ ential treatment in the event of a crisis. “The members of this rapidly growing group, called InfraGard, receive secret warnings of terror¬ ist threats before the public does — and, at least on one occasion, before elected officials,” Matthew Rothschild wrote in the March 2008 issue of The Progressive. InfraGard was created in 1996 in Cleveland as part of an FBI probe into cyberthreats. Yet after 9/11, membership jumped from 1,700 to more than 23,000, and now includes 350 of the nation’s Fortune 500 companies. Members typically have a stake in one of several crucial infrastructure industries, including agriculture, banking, defense, energy, food, telecommunica¬ tions, law enforcement, and transportation. The group’s 86 chapters coordinate with 56 FBI field offices nationwide. While FBI Director Robert Mueller has said he considers this segment of the private sector “the first line of defense,” the American Civil Liberties Union issued a grave warning about the potential for abuse. “There is evidence that InfraGard may be closer to a corporate TIPS program, turning private-sector corpora¬ tions — some of which may be in a position to observe the activities of millions of individual customers — into surrogate eyes and ears for the FBI,” it cautioned in an August 2004 report. “The FBI should not be creating a privi¬ leged class of Americans who get special treat¬ ment,” Jay Stanley, public education director of the ACLU’s technology and liberty program, told Rothschild. And they are privileged: a DHS spokesper¬ son told Rothschild that InfraGard members receive special training and readiness exercises. They’re also privy to protected information that is usually shielded from disclosure under the trade secrets provision of the Freedom of Information Act. The information they have may be of criti¬ cal importance to the general public, but first it goes to the privileged membership — some¬ times before it’s released to elected officials. As Rothschild related in his story, on Nov. 1, 2001, the FBI sent an alert to InfraGard members about a potential threat to bridges in California. Barry Davis, who worked for Morgan Stanley, received the information and relayed it to his brother Gray, then governor of California, who released it to the public. Steve Maviglio, Davis’s press secretary at the time, told Rothschild, “The governor got a lot of grief for releasing the information. In his defense, he said, ‘I was on the phone with my brother, who is an investment banker. And if he knows, why shouldn’t the public know?”’ Source: “The FBI deputizes business,” Matthew Rothschild, The Progressive, Feb. 7, 2008. 4. ILEA: TRAINING GROUND FOR ILLEGAL WARS? The School of the Americas earned an unsavory reputation in Latin America after many gradu¬ ates of the Fort Benning, Ga., facility turned into counterinsurgency death squad leaders. So the International Law Enforcement Academy recently installed by the Unites States in El Salvador — which looks, acts, and smells like the SOA — is also drawing scorn. The school, which opened in June 2005 before the Salvadoran National Assembly approved it, has a satellite operation in Peru and is funded with $3.6 million from the US Treasury and staffed with instructors from the DEA, ICE, and FBI. It’s tasked with training 1,500 police officers, judges, prosecutors, and other law enforcement agents in counterterror¬ ism techniques per year. It’s stated purpose is to make Latin America “safe for foreign invest¬ ment” by “providing regional security and eco¬ nomic stability and combating crime.” ILEAs aren’t new, but past schools located in Hungary, Thailand, Botswana, and Roswell, N.M., haven’t been terribly controversial. Yet Salvadoran human rights organizers take issue with the fact that, in true SOA fashion, the ILEA releases neither information about its curriculum nor a list of students and graduates. Additionally, the way the school slipped into existence without public oversight has raised ire. As Wes Enzinna noted in a North American Congress on Latin America report, when the US decided it wanted a training ground in Latin America, El Salvador was not the first choice. In 2002 US officials selected Costa Rica as host — a country that doesn’t even have an army. The local government signed on and the plan made headlines. But when citizens learned about it, they revolted and demanded the government change the agree¬ ment. The US bailed for a more discreet second attempt in El Salvador. “Members of the US Congress were not briefed about the academy, nor was the main opposition party in El Salvador, the Farabundo Marti-National Liberation Front (FMLN),” Enzinna wrote. “But once the news media reported that the two countries had signed an official agreement in September, activists in El Salvador demanded to see the text of the docu¬ ment.” Though they tried to garner enough opposition to kill the agreement, the National Assembly narrowly ratified it. Now, after more than three years in opera¬ tion, critics point out that Salvadoran police, who account for 25 percent of the graduates, have become more violent. A May 2007 report by Tutela Legal implicated Salvadoran National Police (PNC) officers in eight death squad-style assassinations in 2006. El Salvador’s ILEA recently received anoth¬ er $2 million in US funding through the con- gressionally approved Merida Initiative — but still refuses to adopt a more transparent curricu¬ lum and administration, despite partnering with a well-known human rights leader. Enzinna’s FOIA requests for course materials were reject¬ ed by the government, so no one knows exactly what the school is teaching, or to whom.

SEIZING PROTEST Protesting war could get you into big trouble, according to a critical read of two executive orders recently signed by President Bush. The first, issued July 17, 2007, and titled, “Blocking property of certain persons who threaten stabi¬ lization efforts in Iraq,” allows the feds to seize assets from anyone who “directly or indirectly” poses a risk to the US war in Iraq. And, citing the modern technological ease of transferring funds and assets, the order states that no prior notice is necessary before the raid. On Aug. 1, Bush signed another order, similar but directed toward anyone undermin¬ ing the “sovereignty of Lebanon or its demo¬ cratic processes and institutions.” In this case, the Secretary of the Treasury can seize the assets of anyone perceived as posing a risk of violence, as well as the assets of their spouses and dependents, and bans them from receiving any humanitarian aid. Critics say the orders bypass the right to due process and the vague language makes manipu¬ lation and abuse possible. Protesting the war could be perceived as undermining or threat¬ ening US efforts in Iraq. “This is so sweep¬ ing, it’s staggering,” said Bruce Fein, a former Reagan administration official in the Justice Department who editorialized against it in the Washington Times. “It expands beyond terrorism, beyond seeking to use violence or the threat of violence to cower or intimidate a population.” Sources: “Bush executive order: Criminalizing the antiwar movement,”Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research, July 2007; “Bush's executive order even worse than the one on Iraq,”Matthew Rothschild, The Progressive, Aug. 2007. 6. RADICALS = TERRORISTS On Oct. 23, 2007, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed — by a vote of 404-6 — the “Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act,” designed to root out the causes of radicalization in Americans. With an estimated four-year cost of $22 million, the act establishes a 10-member National Commission on the Prevention of Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism, as well as a university-based Center of Excellence “to examine the social, criminal, political, psychological, and economic roots of domestic terrorism,” according to a press release from the bill’s author, Rep. Jane Harman (D- Los Angeles). CONTINUES ON PAGE 18 » SFBG.COM/NEWS + CULTURE 17 NEWS + CULTURE Project Censored CONT » During debate on the bill, Harman said, “Free speech, espousing even very radical beliefs, is protected by our Constitution. But violent behavior is not.” Jessica Lee, writing in the Indypendent , a newspaper put out by the New York Independent Media Center, pointed out that in a later press release Harman stated: “the National Commission [will] propose to both Congress and [Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael] Chertoff initiatives to inter¬ cede before radicalized individuals turn violent.” Which could be when they’re speaking, writing, and organizing in ways that are pro¬ tected by the First Amendment. This redefines civil disobedience as terrorism, say civil rights experts, and the wording is too vague. For example, the definition of “violent radicaliza- tion” is “the process of adopting or promoting an extremist belief system for the purpose of facilitating ideologically based violence to advance political, religious, or social change.” “What is an extremist belief system? Who defines this? These are broad definitions that encompass so much.... It is criminal¬ izing thought and ideology,” said Alejandro Queral, executive director of the Northwest Constitutional Rights Center in Portland, Ore. Though the ACLU recommended some changes that were adopted, it continued to criti¬ cize the bill. Harman, in a response letter, said free speech is still free and stood by the need to curb ideologically-based violence. The story didn’t make it onto the CNN ticker, but enough independent sources report¬ ed on it that the equivalent Senate Bill 1959 has since stalled. After introducing the bill, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Me.), later joined forces with Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) on a report criticizing the Internet as a tool for violent Islamic extremism. Despite an outcry from civil liberties groups, days after the report was released Lieberman demanded that YouTube remove a number of Islamist propaganda videos. YouTube canned some that broke their rules regarding violence and hate speech, but resisted censoring others.

SLAVERY'S RUNNER-UP Every year, about 121,000 people legally enter the United States to work with H-2 visas, a program legislators are touting as part of future immigration reform. But Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) called this guest worker program “the closest thing I’ve ever seen to slavery.” The Southern Poverty Law Center likened it to “modern day indentured servitude.” They interviewed thousands of guest workers and reviewed legal cases for a report released in March 2007, in which authors Mary Bauer and Sarah Reynolds wrote, “Unlike US citizens, guest workers do not enjoy the most fundamen¬ tal protection of a competitive labor market — the ability to change jobs if they are mistreated. Instead, they are bound to the employers who ‘import’ them. If guest workers complain about abuses, they face deportation, blacklisting, or other retaliation.” When visas expire, workers must leave the country, hardly making this the path to perma¬ nent citizenship legislators are looking for. The H-2 program mimics the controversial bracero program, established through a joint agreement between Mexico and the United States in 1942 that brought 4.5 million workers over the border during the 22 years it was in effect. Many legal protections were written into the program, but in most cases they existed only on paper in a language unreadable to employees. In 1964 the program was shuttered amid scores of human rights abuses and com¬ plaints that it undermined petitions for higher wages from US workers. Soon after, United Farm Workers organized, which Cesar Chavez said would have been impossible if the bracero program still existed. Years later, it essentially still does. The H-2A program, which accounted for 32,000 agricultural workers in 2005, has many of the same protections — and many of the same abuses. Even worse is the H-2B pro¬ gram, used by 89,000 non-agricultural work¬ ers annually. Created by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, none of the safeguards of the H-2A visa are legally required for H-2B workers. Still, Mexicans are literally lining up for H-2B status, the stark details of which were reported by Felicia Mello in The Nation. Furthermore, thousands of illegal immigrants are employed throughout the country, providing cheap, unprotected labor and further undermin¬ ing the scant provisions of the laws. Labor con¬ tractors who connect immigrants with employ¬ ers are stuffing their pockets with cash, while the workers return home with very little money. The Southern Poverty Law Center outlined a list of comprehensive changes needed in the program, concluding, “For too long, our country has benefited from the labor provided by guest workers but has failed to provide a fair system that respects their human rights and upholds the most basic values of our democracy. The time has come for Congress to overhaul our shame¬ fully abusive guest worker system.” Sources: “Close to Slavery,”Mary Bauer and Sarah Reynolds, Southern Poverty Law Center ; March 2007; “Coming to America, ” Felicia Mello, The Nation , June 25, 2007; “Trafficking racket,” Chidanand Rajghatta, Times of India, March 10, 2008. 8. BUSH CHANGES THE RULES The Bush administration’s Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice has been issuing classified legal opinions about surveillance for years. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) had access to the DOJ opinions on presidential power and had three declassified to show how the judicial branch has, in a bizarre and chilling way, assisted President Bush in circumventing its own power. According to the three memos: “There is no constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new executive order when¬ ever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order. Rather than violate an executive order, the President has instead modi¬ fied or waived it”; “The President, exercising his constitu¬ tional authority under Article II, can determine whether an action is a lawful exercise of the President’s authority under Article II,” and “The Department of Justice is bound by the President’s legal determinations.” Or, as Whitehouse rephrased in a Dec. 7, 2007, Senate speech: “I don’t have to follow my own rules, and I don’t have to tell you when I’m breaking them. I get to determine what my own powers are. The Department of Justice doesn’t tell me what the law is. I tell the Department of Justice what the law is.” The issue arose within the context of the Protect America Act, which expands gov¬ ernment surveillance powers and gives tele¬ com companies legal immunity for helping. Whitehouse called it “a second-rate piece of legislation passed in a stampede in August at the behest of the Bush administration.” He pointed out that the act does not pro¬ hibit spying on Americans overseas — with the exception of an executive order that permits surveillance only of Americans whom the Attorney General determines to be “agents of a foreign power.” “In other words, the only thing standing between Americans traveling overseas and government wiretap is an executive order,” Whitehouse said in an April 12 speech. “An order this president, under the first legal theory I cited, claims he has no legal obliga¬ tion to obey.” Whitehouse, a former US Attorney, legal counsel to Rhode Island’s governor, and Rhode Island Attorney General who took office in 2006, went on to point out that Marbury vs. Madison , written by Chief Justice John Marshall in 1803, established that it is “emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.” Sources: “In FISA Speech, Whitehouse sharply criti¬ cizes Bush Administrations assertion of executive power,” Sheldon Whitehouse, Dec. 7,2007; “Down the Rabbit Hole,” Many Wheeler, The Guardian (UK), Dec. 26, 2007. 9. SOLDIERS SPEAK OUT Hearing soldiers recount their war experiences is the closest many people come to understanding the real horror, pain, and confusion of combat. One would think that might make compelling copy or powerful footage for a news outlet. But in March, when more than 300 veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan convened for four days of public testimony on the war, they were largely ignored by the media. Winter Soldier was designed to give soldiers a public forum to air some of the atrocities they witnessed. Originally convened by Vietnam Vets Against the War in January 1971, more than 100 Vietnam veterans and 16 civilians described their war experiences, including rapes, torture, brutalities, and killing of non-combatants. The testimony was entered into the Congressional Record , filmed, and shown at the Cannes Film Festival. Iraq Veterans Against the War hosted the 2008 reprise of the 1971 hearings. Aaron Glantz, writing in One World , recalled testimony from former Marine Cpl. Jason Washburn, who said, “his commanders encouraged lawless behavior. ‘We were encouraged to bring ‘drop weapons,’ or shovels. In case we accidentally shot a civilian, we could drop the weapon on the body and pretend they were an insurgent.’” An investigation by Chris Hedges and Laila Al-Arian in The Nation that included interviews with 50 Iraq war veterans also revealed an over¬ whelming lack of training and resources, and a general disregard for the traditional rules of war. 18 SAN FRANCISCO BAY GUARDIAN | OCTOBER 1 - 7 r 2008 NEWS + CULTURE Though most major news outlets sent staff to cover New York’s Fashion Week, few made it to Silver Spring, Md. for the Winter Soldier hear¬ ings. Fortunately, KPFA and Pacifica Radio broadcast the testimonies live and, in an update to the story, said they were “deluged with phone calls, e-mails, and blog posts from service members, veterans, and military families thanking us for breaking a cultural norm of silence about the reality of war.” Testimonies can still be heard at www.ivaw.org.

APA HELPS CIA TORTURE Psychologists have been assisting the CIA and US military with inter¬ rogation and torture of Guantanamo detainees — which the American Psychological Association has said is fine, despite objections from many of its 148,000 members. A 10-member APA task force convened on the divisive issue in July 2005 and found that assistance from psychologists was making the inter¬ rogations safe and the group deferred to US standards on torture over international human-rights organiza¬ tions’ definitions. The task force was criticized by APA members for deliberating in secret, and later it was revealed that six of the 10 participants had ties to the armed services. Not only that, but as Katherine Eban reported in Vanity Fair, ; “Psychologists, working in secrecy, had actually designed the tactics and trained interrogators in them while on contract to the CIA.” In particular, psychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, neither of whom are APA members, honed a classified military training program known as SERE [Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape] that teaches soldiers how to tough out torture if captured by enemies. “Mitchell and Jessen reverse-engineered the tactics inflicted on SERE trainees for use on detainees in the global war on terror,” Eban wrote. And, as Mark Benjamin noted in a Salon article, employing SERE training — which is designed to rep¬ licate tort"
