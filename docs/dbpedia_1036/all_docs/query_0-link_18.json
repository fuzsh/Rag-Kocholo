Combined payments from Yahoo, Time-Warner's AOL, and RealNetworks could reach $100 million. Rather than settle for a lower amount, ASCAP hung in for the fight, proving its deep commitment to creators' rights and underscoring the value of member-ownership.

LETTERS Right On The Money Court's Compensation Decision Is A Landmark For The Digital Age BY JOHN LoFRUMENTO The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York recently handed down a landmark decision upholding the rights of music creators in the Digital Age. By setting compensation rates forthepub- he performance of music on three Inter- net services — AOL, RealNetworks and Yahoo — the decision establishes new ground rules for virtually every Internet content aggregator and social network- ing site, as well as countless online, mo- bile or other technology-driven services yet to be imagined. In the broadest sense, the court reaf- firmed and applied to the virtual world the momentous 1917 Supreme Court de- cision recognizing that music creators deserved copyright protection for the pub- lic performance of their works, justice Oliver Wendall Holmes delivered the rul- ing, which included these memorable words: \"If music did not pay, it would be given up . . - whether it pays or not. the purpose of employing it is proBt, and that is enough.\" Again, the court acknowledged the legal right of music creators to fair compensa- tion for the use of their creative works — works that online services have been using for years to subsidize their billion-dollar businesses, while paying little or nothing to music creators, like ASCAP's mem- bers. The court adopted a formula that rec- ognizes the contribution that music makes to the total revenue of the three Internet businesses, resulting in required pay- ments by AOL, RealNetworks and Yahoo to ASCAP that could reach SlOO million by 2009, covering periods back to 2002 in some cases. From the technology' community, one often hears the mantra of \"\"Information wants to be free.\" What's ironic is that many in this community make their liv- ing from copyright-protected software code, patented devices and other fiercely guarded intellectiial properties. The Internet has spawned new, won- derful ways to connect people with music and other forms of content they crave. However, many of these businesses have built much of their success on the foun- dation of others* creative works. While they post record-breaking capitalizations, it is critical that these companies com- pensate those whose creative works at- tract audiences and ultimately help to make their businesses viable. In its wise and detailed decision, the court encourages the legal distribution of music and provides a compensation framework for valuing the online use of musical works. Creative people who bring vital art forms to life have a right to earn a living by sharing in the benefits gener- ated by the use of their works. Without this protection, many who dream of de- voting their talents and energies to cre- ative pursuits will be economically unable to do so. John A. LoFrumento is CEO of ASCAP.

EYE ON CBS RECORDS Eighteen Months After Launch, Label Preps Late-Spring Releases Everything was going well for Larry Jenkins in early 2007: Newly named executive VP/GM of the resur- rected CBS Records, the indu.stry veteran had high hopes for such acts as singer/ songwriters Sharon Lit- tle and Keaton Simon.s and pop duo Karmina. Then, last November, the Writers Guild of America went on strike, and the key promotional strategy of CBS Records — seeking synchs in shows on CBS and the CW, as well as marketing boosts from the array of Viacom-owned properties — went out the window. \"We were still in the infancy of our label.\" jenkins says, and as a result, release dates for CBS Records' first round of albums were pushed back frorn early spring. But with the strike now over, 18-month-old CBS Records is lack in gear. Little will release her album. \"Per- fect Time for a Breakdown.\" May 27. followed in short succession by Karmina with \"Backwards Into Beaut>'\" (lune 3) and Simons' \"Can You Hear Me\" {June 10). \"We're ofTand rolling.\" Jenkins says, revealing that between February 2007 and April 2008 — a time frame that includes the three-month summer hiatus and the three-month writers\" strike — CBS Records artists had 65 placements in shows on CBS and the CW. Seven people work in-houscat CBS Records. Audrey Fainc. formerly of Iris Distribution, was recently brought on to head up marketing, and a number of duties are outsourced, including retail sales and marketing going to Rocket Science and distribution handled by RED. But the decision process as to which artists to sign is decidedly a family affair. |enkins works with Amy Osier. VP of music for CBS Fntertainment and CBS Paramount Network Television. \" She's our chief liaison,\" Jenkins says. \"When we're thinking of signing artists, we run the music by sev- eral people — her music supervisors and show produc- ers — and ask. \"Do you think you'd want to use their music?\" There are no guarantees, but when we get a thumbs up we go into each sign- ing with a great deal of confidence.\" With this kind of vetting, it's inevitable that the label's artists will be linked with the greater Viacom. However.CBS Records' artist promotion also takes a traditional approach. Little, for instance, is opening for Robert Plant, Alison Krauss and T-Bone Burnett on the Raising Sand North American tour, the dates of which will continue throughout the buildup and after the release of her album. \" Larr>- gave them a couple of songs I had already recorded . . . and a couple morn- ings later. Robert Plant came in. put the CD down on his table and said, \"Sharon Little. We want Sharon Little to open.' \" she says. \"I started crying.\" Little's \"Spaceship\" was placed in CBS mystery se- ries \"Numbirs\" on May 2 and her \"Follow That Sound\" will be heard in \"NCIS\" on May 20. These types of music placements, and those of other CBS Records artists, are identified during the end cred- its and give the artist's name, song title and where the song can be purchased. In the placements that occur before an album is released, the ad card tells the viewer lo go to the artist's Web site or gives tour dates. For sister act Kelly and Kamille Rudisill of Karmina. CBS Records has pushed them to perform for TV nu- merous times — they appeared on the CBS Christmas special in 2(X)7. alongside Sheryl Crow. James Blunt and Carole King. \"We were in really good company,\" Kelly Rudisill says with a laugh. \"All these household names . . . and Karmina. It was intimidating.\" In addition, on May 31 the duo will take part in music showcase \"Second Cup Cafe\" on CBS' \"Early Show.\" As for placement, Karmina's \"Free\" was heard on MTV's \"The Hills\" at the end of March. Simons' \"Unstoppable\" has been heard in \"Numb3rs,\" and his \"Mama Song\" will be in the May 20 episode of \"NCIS.\" \"1 keep them on my TiVo for an ungodly long amount of time and show it to people when they come over\" Simons says of his placements. \"The ad card af- terwards is what sets it apart from everybody else — most of the time there's not even credits for music on a show.\" Even before their albums debut, it appears as though these placements are having a sales impact. Accord- ing to Nielsen SoundScan. as of the end of April, all three acts are already on track to best their digital sin- ^e sales for the entire previous year. Other acts signed to CBS include Will Dailey, PJ Olsson. Seflor Happy and the Wilshires — and while they don't yet have release dates on their CBS debuts. Jenkins says to expect them to gel the same kind of play. Seftor I lappy. for instance, wrote the theme song for CBS show \" Rules of Engagement\"; the Wilshires did the theme for the CW's \" Life Is Wild\": and Ols- son collaborated with Pakistani musician Salman Ahmad on the intro to the CW's \"Aliens in America,\" a remake of \"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace. Love and Understanding.\" And despite the home-field advantage, artists on CBS Rrcords aren't cxtUtdcd from synchs on otht-r networks. Jenkins adds, nothing that Dailey's \"Rise\" was placed in ABC's \"Eli Stone\" early in 2008. In addition, Jenkins wants to bolster ties between his artists and the nonintuitive elements of Viacom, getting more artist placement on the company's in- formational/enteriainment screens that are placed on gas station pumps and in doctor's offices. \"A lot of companies talk about synergy on paper, but don't practice it.\" Jenkins says. \"We do both.\" •••• .biz MOBILE: For 24/7 news and analysis on your c«U phone or mobile device, go to: mobil«.billboard,biz.

The performance more than doubles the previous first-week record, held by \"Halo 3,\" which sold about 2.6 million units and earned $300 million. The numbers exceeded analyst forecasts; many expected the game to sell 5 million copies after two weeks and 9 million for the year, with predictions of a $400 million first-week tally. >>>VEGOOSE PRODUCERS PULL PLUG Las Vegas festival Vegoose will not happen in 2008, according to Jonathan Mayers, president of Superfly Presents, co- producer of Vegoose with A.C.

Vegoose debuted in 2005 as a Halloween- season, multivenue music festival, with headliners Dave Matthews Band, Jack Johnson and Beck performing at Vegas* Sam Boyd Stadium.

The rebuttal phase of the CRB trial, which will set statutory mechanical and digital rates for compositions re- produced for CDs. downloads and other products, kicked ofTMay 6. Music publishers and songwriters on one side and record labels and digital music services on the other have been in- tensely negotiating behind the scenes since Ihe initial trial phase ended in March (Billboard. March 1 5). If the par- ties can settle on some mutually ac- ceptable rates, the judges could adopt those rales in their decision. The trial continues through May 21.

The group convened at HR-57, a nonprofit arts organ- ization named for a 1987 House resolution authored by Cony- ers that designated jazz \"a rare and valuable American na- tional treasure\" worthy of fed- eral support. Since 2003. the Bush ad- ministration has prevented Cuban musicians from enter- ing the United States through visa denials and has curtailed the ability of American musi- cians to travel there, via license restrictions— one of the most notable examples was the de- nial of a visa for veteran singer Ibrahim Ferrer to attend the by lune, sources in the Senate and in the House say. The Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act (S. 2913) and the Orphan Works Act (M.R. 5889). although not identi- cal, would make copyrighted works available for licensing even if the copy- right owners cannot be found. The bills protect anyone who uses these so-called orphan works from infringement lia- bility as long as the user conducts a thorough, documented search in good faith for thecopyright owner and is un- able to locate thai owner. If the owner later surfaces, the user must pay rea- sonable compensation. The bills focus primarily on photo- graphs and art works. But ihcy may af- fect music as well. Owners of compositions can typically be found by contacting ASCA P. B M I . S liS AC or the Harry Fox Agency. However, owners of sound recordings protected by copyright (i.e.. recordings made in 1972 and later) are harder to find — indie labels often close without a trace, and individual pro- ducers or artists often own masters.

The bill (H.R. 4279). introduced by Rep. )olm Conyers Ir.. D-Mich.. estab- lishes the position of ati I P Enforcement Representative in the White House as an adviser to the president. Tliat repre- sentative would set up a joint strategic plan, in cooperation witli other agen- cies, for IP protection. The bill also es- tablishes an I P enforcement division in the DepartiTient of lustice. At press time, there wasn't a compan- ion bill in the Senate. But sources close to Senate meiTibers say that some of them are working on a complementarv bill. It's unlikely that this version will establish a White House position. Currently, there is a Coordinator of International IP Enforcement, the so- i ,ii ■ u I '.pyright czar, in the Depart- ment of Commerce who is responsible for coordinating the I P activities of sev- eral agencies. Elevating an IP representative to an executive level in the White House and coordinating the activities among the departments are the hottest issues of debate.

There are too many responsibilities shared among them. UNDER PRESSURE Artists Renew/ Attacks On Bush Administration's Cuba Policy Grammy Awards in 2004. It also reversed the Clinton administration's policy of \"people-to-peopte exchange. ' which in the late '90s started something of a renaissance for Cuban musicians and their work in the States. Among those who participated in the celebrated cross-cultural per- formances was Chuco Valdes. Chuchito's father. Now. while the younger Valdes. who lives in Mexico, can perform state- side, his father, who lives In Cuba, is forbidden from doing so. For many Cuban musicians, U.S. exposure is considered vital— and some are willing to take tremendous risks for the chance to succeed. The issue took a tragic turn in April when Cuban reggaeton singer Elvis Manuel died while trying to cross from Cuba to Miami in a small boat. The current campaign for a change in the Bush admin- istration's policy was stim- ulated by an impassioned open letter to American in- tellectuals and artists last fall from Ballet Nacional de Cuba director Alicia Alonso. \"Let us work together so that Cuban artists can take their talent to the United States,\" Alonso wrote. Taking that spirit as his call to arms, Louis Head, executive direc- tor of U.S. Cuba Cultural Ex- change, a national network of artists and presenters, de- vised an online letter peti- tioning the Bush administra- tion lo reverse its policy. \"The response to that let- ter was overwhelming,\" Head says. Among the hundreds who signed on were singer Jackson Browne and gui- tarist Ry Cooder, who collab- orated with Cuban musicians on 1997's \"Buena Vista So- cial Club.\" Head hopes that since Fidet Castro has stepped down and a new U.S. admin- istration will soon take of- fice, the climate may be right for change. \"What's important.\" he says, \"is that we've organized arts pre- senters, agents, record com- pany executives and educa- tors to let Congress know how we feel.\" \"As far as I'm concerned, Cuba is a wellspring of talent and influence.\" says Blue Note Records president Bruce Lundvall. who signed Chucho Valdes to his label through a foreign imprint. \"And I'd like that connection back.\" 10 BILLBOARD MAY 17. 2008 BY ED CHRfSTMAN THE LATEST NEWS FROM RETRO-FITTING NARM Dream Of Boosting The CD Falls Silent; Vinyl And Digital Cause Sparks New formats were supposed t(» save the CD business. At this time last year Warner Music Group (WMG) was rolling out its MVI format. Sony BMC Music Entertainment was talk- ing about different ways to pack- age and configure albums and Buena Vista Music Group was privately read>ing its CDVU+ . While the CD is in the second year of a precipitous decline — sales are down 16.7% so far this year, on topof2007's 18.8% drop — retailers, labels and distribii tion executives alike say that the growth of the niche business of vinyl and digital directives may bea heartening turn of events in the industry. But more may be needed to make up for die plum- meting CD market. Tliis emphasis on vinyl came during the 50th anniversar>' of NAHM's convention — held May 4-7 in San Francisco — and was an abrupt change from last year's sessions when talk ofhow to rein- vigorate the CD reigned supreme. \"Last year [everyone] was pitching their tethered CD product.\" Newbury Comics CEO Mike Dreese said. \"This year, there was virtually no talk on that. There is a big pause.\" A head of a major distribu- tion company agreed that most of those efTorts appeared to be stalled. \" Last year, everyone had their own savior for the physi- cal marketplace, but that didn't work so now [Best Buy VP of music lennifer \"J.}.\" Schaidler) is overseeing a task force [of re- tailers and suppliers! to see if wc can legally get on the same page so we don't confuse the consumer.\" he says. Another possible reason (hose efforts are stalled is a sta- tistic cited in a presentation by From left: Sony BMG's THOMAS HESSE. UMG's AMANDA MARKS and WMG's MICHAEL NASH al NARM. N PD Group— 80% of teenagers don't pay for music. How to monetize free music sparked debates during the social net- working and copyright panels. Members of tite digital commu- nit)- urged labels to stop look- ing at CDs or litigation as a market solution and instead focn;s on \"competing with free.\" During Nielsen SoundScan's NARM presentation. Nielsen Music president Rob Sisco said that based on the first three months of this year, vinyl sales are projected to reach 1.7 mil- lion units, an increase of nearly 72% from the 1 million units scanned last year. Last year, that total equaled 0.2% of all album sales. But considering that mainly indie stores and small music chains carry vinyl, its revival is a key reason why those types of stores are healthy. our vendor meetings, vir- tually every label had a vinyl scheme, with plans to increa.se vinyl's availabilit)'.\" Dreese said. Indeed. Universal Music Group Distribution president/ CEO Jim Uric said his company has already issued 70 titles on vinyl with plans to put out an- other 100. But there appears to be a vinyl manufacturing capacity issue, with a two-month back- log on the manufacture of 1 80- counl vinyl. Dreese said. While he acknowledged that vinyl is a niche business for the chain, it is indeed a profitable one, de- spile its high costs. Labels pay anywhere from $4 to $7 to manufacture vinyl and its packaging; in turn they give it a list price of SI 8.98-$2 1 .98 for a single-disc album. \"While vinyl is a small per- centage at our chain, its gross profit is only 5% less than the gross profit of our top 30 CDs this year,\" Dreese said. And while old-school vinyl was the hot topic at NARM, new- sdiool digital endeavors arc still being developed. For instance, the ability to marrj- physical and digital product through some type of connectivity remains on the minds of the majors even if those topics didn't get as much mileage as they did last year. During the Digital Music In- dustry Leaders panel, WMG ex- ecutive VP of digital strategy and business development Michael Nash said that gift cards have furtlicr potential. Last year, 26% of all digital download songs were purchased via gift cards. Likewise. EMI Music Mar- keting senior VP of sales and Last year (^vervoiK* was pilchiiig ihcir tethered CI) pnxluet. This year, there w as virtually no tails, on diat.\" —MIKE DREESE, NEWBURY COMICS commercial development Dar- ren Stupak said that the industry should give digital download album-specific cards time to develop. But while waiting for digital connectivity to finally material- ize in a way that works and doesn't confuse consumers, merchants need to find ways to keep CDs from falling so rapidly. l.abel and distribution exec- utives said that there was al- most a universal outcry from retail to devalue catalog titles to even lower prices, a trend that has already been going on for three years. And some vendors figure it's time to increase their defensive measures. For the first time, vendors were discouraging merchants from overbuying new releases, retailers said. \"We would rather have the oc- casional out-of-stock — which we feel we can replenish quickly — than to get stuck with big re- turns.\" one senior distribution CTecutive said. ••«■ Additio7ial reporting by Cortney Harding. BY CORTNEY HARDING Managers Jump Into Label Game Sire Records president Michael Cold- stone will leave his post to run an inde- pendent label with key artist management company Q Prime. Ac- cording to Goldstone. the dates for his departure from Sire and the launch of the new label have yet to be determined. Goldstone will be charged with sign- ingartists to the label and to management deals, and will continue to work closely with some Sire Records artists. Q Prime is already home to such top acts as Metallica. Muse. Snow Patrol and Shania Twain. According to Q Prime co- / foimder CliflT Bumstein, the ' new label will be able to offer a unique value proposition to artists — from A&R to financial investment. \"Major labels are m in a position where each person on their staffs has t\\vice as much to do to make f an artist successful and artists aren't 1 ways getting the attention they deserve.\" he says. \\ \"Since Q Prime is a man- I agement company, we are ,' used to and are set up to give artists individual attention. We have the knowledge, expe- I u nee and staff to steer a career to success. At least, our track record would indicate that. Indie labels have the passion, but maybe not the relationships and the finances that we at Q Prime have to reach big media players both here in the US and abroad,\" Other managers who have succeeded at the indie-label game include |im Guerinot'sTime Bomb Recordings and Gregg Latterman's Aware Records. Goldstone adds, \"We have yet to work out distribution, and we are open to ex- ploring options for alliances and part- nerships.

In-house Allegro Acquires Wholesaler Softland Indie Distributor Could Hit $100 Million In Annual Revenue In Wake Of Deal Thanks to a $25 million cash infusion from private equity firm Canterbury Park Capital. Allegro Media Croup has acquired all of the outstanding shares of Softland. a wholesaler that is the exclusive supplier of music and video entertainment software to the U.S. Ma- rine Exchange Service. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the combination of the two is expected to cat- apult the Portland, Ore. -based Allegro to achieving ilOO million in annual revenueon a gross basis. Even with the equity infusion, the Micallef brothers who own and run Allegro will retain a majority interest in the company, according to chairman/CEO Joe Micallef. while Canter- bury will have a significant minority interest. What's more, the Canterbury deal makes available a SI 2 million equity line for future acquisitions, in addition to a new $15 million revolving loan facility the company has re- ceived from U.S. Bank division USB Capital Resources. By Billboard's estimate. Allegro is already the second-largest non-major-owned independent distributor behind Koch Enter- tainment Distribution. Allegro will generate gross revenue of 555 million this year; Soft- land, meanwhile, is expected to achieve about $45 million in sates. \"This is the fifth acquisition we have done in the last 10 years.\" Micallef told Billboard at the NARM convention, held May 4-7 in San Francisco. \"The Canterbur>' investment puts us in the position of being a consolidator.\" Past acquisitions include Newsound Distrib- 12 i BILLBOARD MAY 17, 2008 utton. Rounder Kids and Nail Distribution. The Micallef brothers bought Allegro nearly 20 years ago. when the company specialized in the distribution of classical music. Since then, it has diversified its product offering into all genres of music, including selling the majors as a rack supplier to nontraditional retail stores. In a statement. Allegro presi- dent/CEO Ric Micallef said the Softland ac- quisition further diversifies the company's account base as only three of Allegro's top 10 customers are NARM members, and tradi- tional core merchandisers account for less than 25% of Allegro's consolidated sales. While the Softland acquisition is bound to improve sales of Allegro's proprietary enter- tainment software titles and the indie labels ^^^^ it distributes, it also reinforces Alle- ^^^H gro's place in the hybrid whole- saler/rackjobber/indie distributor role occupied by Baker & Taylor. Super D and Alliance Entertainment, all of which have annual revenue of more than $100 million. In addition to diversifying Allegro's account base, the deal will bring the company rev- enue into equilibrium, with a split down the middle between audio and video product. Softland founder Larry Goldberg will leave the company, but CEO Pat Nugent will remain in charge of the Maryland-based operation. Joe Mi- callef said there aren't any immedi- ate changes planned for Softland. and he expects to keep its warehouse open to complement Allegro's new 135.000-square-foot facility, which it moved into March 31. Wholesalers specializing in sell- ing music to the military used to gen- erate a much larger volume in the '90s when the military's own Army Air Forces Exchange Services was a top 10 account, generating sales of about $400 million. But since the war in Iraq began, music and video sales have declined, leaving AAFES and Eurpac. a privately owned whole- saler that sells to the military, out of the top tier of the account base. (The Allegro-Soft- land deal required the approval of the Depart- ment of Defense.) Like other wholesalers. Allegro also has been aggressive in digital distribution to on- line services and stores around the world. \"The Softland acquisition solidifies our position as a vertically integrated media company doing business in the digital channel as well as the physical,\" Micallef said.

BY AYALA BEN-YEHUDA BRAVADO WORLDWIDE PRESIDENT Tom Bennett Bravado's m^rch marquee includes Kanye West, Alicia Keys and Gwen Stefani— and the new worldwide president plans an expanded focus on international markets. In the 28 years since a company called Bravado started selling Iron Maiden T-shirts, merchandise has become a revenue stream that labels, not just artists, see as inte- gral to their business. Six years ago. Bravado was purchased by Sanctuary Group, which Universal Music Group (UMG) in turn acquired last summer. Since then, Bravado's Tom Bennett, the former head of North American opera- tions who has just been named worldwide president of the company, has opened offices around the globe and aggressively signed up new marquee acts— not all of them Universal's. Those acts include Kanye West, Alicia Keys, Daughtry, Gwen Stefani, James Blunt, the Eagles and Pinl<. Those add to an already formidable roster of clients from before the UMG acquisition, including Christina Aguilera, Beyonce, Kelly Clarkson and Led Zeppelin. Rather than an upfront fee, the New Yorlt-based company takes a percentage of the merchandise it sells through such diverse distribution channels as clothing stores, music retailers, concerts and e-commerce sites for bands. Universal's ownership will put the merch company in business in 46 countries by year's end. By expanding Bravado, Universal stands to enlarge and get a bigger piece of the merch pie, and in a different manner from the trendy 360 deal. As Universal an- nounced his appointment as worldwide president, Bennett sat down with Billboard to give the goods on merch. What are your distribution channels, and what is the range of the merch you sell? We're in iive event sales, retail distribution, e-commerce. licens- ing, and we touch a little bit in the mobile commerce world. At live events, we'll sell everything from programs to T-shirts to lith- ographs to umbrellas to any type of product you would see when- ever you [go] to a concert. At re- tail, which is our greatest strength — we have a far bigger reach than anybody else — we sell everything that is upper-body apparel to all areas of distribution. We sell T- shirts at Saks Fifth Avenue from an $85 price point to T-shirts at, say. Hot Topic that arc more at the 515 price point. So we run the whole gamut on a worldwide basis, from every retailer from H&M to Zara to Virgin to HMV to Urban Outfitters. What we're doing on the mo- bile front is concert texting [where users pay to send texts to be dis- played on a big screen]. We sell an awful lot of wallpaper. And then on the c-commercc side we have maybe as many as 75 Web shops attached to bands' Web sites. How does Bravado fit Into the rest of UMG? Prior to the acquisition, approx- imately 15% of [Bravado's] busi- ness was from Universal Music Group acts, so the growth that was available and should be avail- able with the new marriage with Universal was huge. What they decided to do as part of the purchase of Sanctuary was they got into [morch] with a real market leader. Bravado has al- ready made the investment into the people and the infrastructure . . . and at the end of the day all we are is a rights acquisition com- pany. Merchandising contracts are much shorter than recording contracts — you could say an av- erage one is maybe two years. So we're continually having to re- prove ourselves. Why would a non-Universal label allow the merch opportu- nity to slip through its fingers and go to Bravado instead? So many of the acts would be on a different publishing company than the record company they're on any- way, so they're not married to one. It comes down to, fundamentally, doing a really good job. I think it's a given that people want a great job done first for the money. Part of our strategy and part of the strength of us within Univer- sal is that we've got a really strong hold on music at traditional re- tail already. We're No. 1 at Hot Topic and Spencer Gifts and HMV and Zavvi in the U.K. We're going to be opening up literally thousands of new accounts around the world in these other 46 countries where we really haven't done business in a mean- ingful way before. The CEO of HMV feels that within the next three years quite possibly 7S% of their overall busi- ness will be music merchandise. So then it becomes more at- tractive to music retailers, when they see sales of re- corded music decline. For us. with Metallica, we'll very aggressively cross-market the record and the merchandise. With Mika, we'll be doing a lot of stuff with the ads going out for the new records, we'll have a mer- chandising component within those advertisements. Which no- body else can do. Would you expect the same to happen with non-Universal artists? We won't be controlling their ad- vertising spend on the music. So it'll happen to the best of our abilities within the world we con- trol. But we've already had big success trying to do a lot of cross- marketing with Led Zeppelin, which we did do with, obviously, a non-Universal label. A lot of the ideas can work regardless of whiTt' the act in. The trick to this is going to be turning nonmusic retailers into music retailers as well. There's a lot of stores that we sell, be it Saks or be it Spencer Gifts — we re- cently got them to sell for the first time ever recorded music. It's a mall store with approximately 625 stores in America, and another 25 in Canada. I think it's impor- tant for the act to have a full of- fering out there. You'll find most record labels now consider Hot Topic to be a very important music retailer now, where maybe they didn't 10 years ago. This has already happened in the U.K. in a store called Bur- ton. They've started to sell T- shirts with downloads, and it's only just started and it's hugely successful. How does Bravado allow UMG to enjoy the benefits of merch without the potential pitfalls of a 360 deal? It can't just be a land grab where you're paying to get rights. We re- ally explain to an artist and their representatives what we can do for them. Therefore, when they make a decision to be in business with us. it's an informed decision, not just. \"Here's some money, we want to grab those rights.\" Going back to the different areas of distribution that we're in. if it's purely a live event sale, then I understand somewhat why [merch is] all getting rolled in within deals at Live Nation. But we can really impact at re- tail, e-commercc. licensing, in nonevent sales — and most acts don't tour that often. So some- body who tours once every four years, more and more of those people are going to be very inter- ested in companies that can ac- tually help them earn money in the four years they're not tour- ing, which would be common sense for everybody. •••• Most record labels consider Hot Topic I to be a very important music retailer.

By Jonathan Cohen Emmglou Harris mnv Usher \"Here I Stand\" (Jive, May 27} After telling all on his juicy 2004 disc \"Confessions,\" Usher is all about settling down. Here, the new husband and father embraces his maturation on cuts like the Dre and Vidal-crafted title track — \"You ain't a man until you a man to your woman.\" he says. \"This is the conversation that takes place.\" Alongside ballads \"Moving Mountains\" and \"Love You Gently\" (\"the ultimate love-making record\") are tracks on the lighter side. The WUI.i.am-crafted \"What's Your Name?\" describes \"the feeling you get when you run into a woman that makes you speak gibberish.\" while the Br>'an- Michael Cox creation \"Before I Met You\" revolves around \"a modern-day gigolo [who] decides to change.\" fll Green \"Lay It Down\" (Blue Note, May 27) This friendly collision of new and old sensibilities is as vintage- sounding as anything Al Green released during his Hi Records heyday of the '70s. but also finds him dueting with |ohn Legend (\"Stay With Me [By the Seaj\"). Corinne Bailey Rae (\"Take Your Time\") and Anthony Hamilton, with the Dap-Kings horn section playing behind them. The Roots' Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson produced in tandem with keyboardist James Poyser. \"I've never heard anything quite like it. because 1 've never had anybody pro- duce me other than Willie Mitchell.\" Green says. \"And when you give these young kids a shot at it, it's interesting to see the art they make. It's beautiful.* JURE David BanriGr \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" (SRC/Universal, June 3) \"This time I 'm not going to put the record out until I gel the typo of promotion I feel 1 deserve,\" David Banner says of \"The Greatest Story Ever Told.\" originally due last fall. \"If the mix ain't right, I'm sending it back a thousand times, even if 1 have to pay for it.\" The outspoken rapper is already feeling the love. After a lukewarm re- sponse to first single \"9mm\" (aka \"Speaker\") last year. \"Get Like Me\" — which features Chris Brown, Yung Joe and Jim Jones — is scaling the charts. Other guests on the album include Akon, UGK. Lil Wayne, Snoop Dogg, Chamillionaire and Carl Thomas. Disturbed \"Indestructible\" (Warner Bros., June 3) Proving Disturbed's brand of nii-metal can still get fans excited after a three-year break between studio albums, \"Inside the Fire,\" the first single from \"Indestructible.\" has already reached No. 3 on Mainstream Rock and No. 10 on Modern Rock. Frontman David Draiman drew on personal travails — including a motor- cycle accident, a garage fire that destroyed his truck and motor- cycle, and \"a number of bad relationships\" — to inspire himself, and his bandmates followed suit. Drummer Mikey Wengren \"is playing faster and more furiously than ever, with more polysyn- copation.\" Draiman says, while guitarist Danny Donegan \"is soloing even more frequently, and the riffs are just brutal and honest and dark.\" Fleet Foxes \"Fleet Foxes\" (Sub Pop, June 3) Hipster hearts are abuzz over the self-titled debut from this Seat- tle quintet, which won over the South by Southwest faithful this spring with its Crosby. Stills & Nash-worthy vocal harmonies. (The band describes its own sound as \"baroque harmonic pop jams.\") On the heels of April's \"Sun Giant\" EP. the full-length renders 22-year-old frontman Robin Pecknold's songs onto even more widescreen canvases, sympathetically produced by Pacific Northwest vet Phil Ek. Vintage organ and surfy guitar lines dance on the two-songs-in-one \"Ragged Wood,\" while fingerpicked acoustic leads support gorgeous group singing on \"Quiet Houses.\" Gavin Rossdale \"Wanderlust\" (Interscope, June 3) After his post-Bush band Institute flamed out following a lone album. Gavin Rossdale regrouped for a solo set. which is led by the single \"Love Remains the Same.\" Elsewhere, his ever-so-fa- mous wife, Gwen Stefani. lends vocals to the track \"Some Days.\" The Bob Rock-produced album finds Rossdale collaborating with drummer |osh Freese, guitarist Chris Traynor, bassist Paul Bush- nell and keyboardist )amie Muhoberac. \"All I Intended to Be\" (Nonesuch, June }0) For the first time in 25 years, this 12-time Grammy Award winner and Billboard Century Award recipient recorded with producer Brian Ahem, the man who handled her first 1 1 al- bums. The new set's title comes from a line in \"Old Five and Dimers Like Me,\" a duet with John Starling. While Dolly Par- ton. Vince Gill and Buddy Miller contribute vocals, the set in- cludes songs from Tracy Chapman, Patti Griffin, Merle Haggard and Billy Joe Shaver. LilLUaLjne \"Tha Carter III\" (Cash Money/Universal, June 10) Plagued with leaks, delays and Lil Wayne's arrest on drug posses- sion charges. ''ThaCarter III\" is now penciled in for June 10. Luck- ily, the set has already spawned the rapper's first Billboard Hot l(K)No. 1 in the form of \"Lollipop.\" Wayne told Billboard in Feb- ruary that Hurricane Chris, Corey Gunz. Tyga, Jibbs. Shanell, Kidd Kidd, Mack Maine and Lil Mama have recorded features for the album, and Kanye West has also joined the roster ofcontrib- utors. \"It's one of those albums people are really waiting on. so 1 made it so that whatever is on it will stick with you forever.\" WayTie says. \"I 'm takingmy time with it. And I 'm giving artists I respect and people I want to do songs with — not songs the label fixed — an opportunity to collaborate.\" fTlq fTlorninq Jacket I Rshanti The Declaration\" (Unl SfTNacttTJemim LT Mutton, Babyface and Pharrell Williams are among the producers lending a hand on Ashanti's first album since 2004's \"Concrete Rose.'* First single 'The Way That 1 Love You\" is already a top 10 hit on Billboard's Hot R&B/ Hip-Hop Songs chart. The artist Is particularly enthused about the song \"Click,\" which she says is \"a relationship record done from a female point of view. It's about when you're trying to get in con- tact with someone you're seeing but he's not an- swering, and by the time he calls you feel like, 'i don't want to talk to you now.' \" \"Evil Urges\" (ATO, June 10) This Kentucky quintet is already among the most praised live acts in the land, but the music on its fifth studio album should take the band to an entirely new level. After sequestering itself in a Col- orado cabin to hone the tracks. My Morning Jacket then decamped to New York last fall to record with co-producer |oe Chiccarelli. More adventurous than anything that has come before, the songs explore falsetto singing (\"Evil Urges\"), soft rock (\"Thank You Too\"), disco beats (first single \"Touch Me. I'm Going to Scream Pt. 2\"} and gritty funk ( 'Highly Suspicious\"), without skimping on the two-guitar jams (\"Aluminum Park,\" \"Remnants\") and mellow balladry (\"Li- ^^^k^ brarian\") of past releases. \"We've never wanted to be one kind of band,\" front- man jim James says. \"We just enjoy cel- I'brating music — making it loud and making it sad.\" Hlanis (Tlorissette \"Flavors of Entanglement\" (Warner Bros., June 10) \"The baby is almost out,\" Alanis Moris- sette says about her first album of origi- nal work in four years, which features production by Frou Frou's Guy Sigsworth. ■'This is a bi-track journey for me — one is the unraveling of my personal life to the point where I hit rock bottom — but then the phoenix rises,\" she says. \" In the other track. I speak about the personal |}eing the political. Rather than talk about war out there. I *d rather talk about war in here, because it's the only thing I have control over. \" The rarnp-up to the release lias a decidedly international flavor \" Un- derneath\" will be preloaded onto Motorola cell phones in Brazil, and Morissette starts a three-month tour of Europe in June, fol- lowed by U.S. dates in the fall. rnarco Antonio Soils \"Una Noche en Madrid\" (Fonovisa, June 10) Marco Antonio Soh's has transcended his popularity in his na- tive Mexico to become a mega star in the United States (with four No. Is on Billboard's Top Latin Albums chart) and virtually all of Latin America. Now, he has his sights set on Spain. \"Una Noche en Madrid,\" a live album recorded during an Oct. 12. 2007, performance in Madrid, will be the first Solis album re- leased in Spain since 2001. The set includes new versions of Solis classics as well as a duct with Spanish singer Pasi6n Vega on \"ComoTu Mujer.\" rnontqofTiGrL) Gentry \"Back When I Knew It All\" (Columbia Nashville, June 10) Looking to shake things up. Montgomery Gentr>'. which lias scored 12 lop 10 singles {including three No. Is) and sold 4.3 million albums after nine years on the country scene, according to Nielsen SoundScan, de- cided to record its new set in Memphis' Ardent studio. The move worked. \"The ambience of the studio was really cool,\" Troy Gentry says of the place where Led Zeppelin. Stevic Ray Vaughan and B.B. King have recorded. Tlie title track and first single is the duo's fastest-climbing song and is No. 1 1 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart. The set includes \"I Pick My Parties\" featuring Toby Keith, with whom the duo will tour this summer. m Busta Rhymes \"Blessed\" (Interscope, June 17) With numerous legal entanglements now behind him, Busta Rhymes says he feels \"blessed\" to be a free man. hence the title of his eighth studio album. Tlie MC has already released several singles, including \"Where's My Fucking Money,\" featured on the \"Grand Theft Auto IV soundtrack, and \"We Made It.\" a collabo- ration with rock outfit Linkin Park. Other contributors include Cool &. Dre. Pharrell Williams and D) Scratch. In addition. Rhymes released a clip for track \"Don't Touch Me\" that recalls his comi- cal videos of the '90s. LUolf Parade \"At Mount Zoomer\" (Sub Pop, June 17) After dabbling in myriad side projects, the members of Wolf Parade finally reconvened last summer to work on the follow- up to 2005's breakout \"Apologies to the Queen Mary.\" \"I think It's more pointed,\" group member Spencer Krug says. \"We wanted to make a record that was done all at once — so as much as possible, we did that.\" The result: nine songs borne out of lengthy improv sessions, yet surprisingly straightforward in sound. \"Bang Your Drum\" and \"Call It a Ritual\" pair Krug's quivering, dissonant voice with low-mannered guitar and drum rhythms. It almost sounds like Wolf Parade has mellowed a bit until the closing title track, a nine-minute epic that raises its creative bar to new heights. rndtleLj Crue \"Saints of Los Angeles\" (Mdtley Records, June 24) \"I've got to tell you, I've been writing songs for a long time, and there's something magical on this record.\" Nikki Sixx says of Motley Criie's first album with its original members since 1997's \"Generation Swine.\" \"This is one of those al- bums that I just feet it in my stomach that something's hap- pening with the band. There's a newfound energy in the songs. It's just a rebirth of that really dirty rock'n'roll side of Mot- ley Criie.\" The title track was first made available through videogame \"Rock Band.\" and is gaining steam at radio. The act leads the bill for its own Crue Fcsl this summer, begin- ning July 1 in West Palm Beach. Fla. ne-Mo \"Year off the Gentl«man\" (Def Jam, June 24) Meeting Ne-Yo's stated goal to move away from the type of R&B that quickly made liim a star, his third album in as many years is exemplified by the single \"Closer.\" a Stargate-produced club track with pulsing strobe-light synths and a high-energy house beat that calls to mind Rihanna's \"Don't Stop the Music.\" \"So You Can Cry\" sports a mellow, easy-listening vibe, with Ne-Yo making a priceless rhyme of \"pity party\" and \"calamari.\" Collaborators on the set also include members of Ne-Yo's Atlanta-based Compound Entertainment crew (the Heavyweights, Shay Taylor, Chuck liar- mony), as well as Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart and |.R. Rotem. \"My prayer is that my fans know me well enough to know that I'm an artist in the truest form.|and] I cannot do the same thing over and over again,\" Ne-Yo says. Three 6 mafia \"Last 2 Walk\" (Hypnotize Minds/Columbia, June 24) If it seems like years have gone by since Three 6 Mafia won the best original song Academy Award for \"It's Hard out Here for a Pimp\" in 2006, that's because, well, years have gone by. \"Our lives are like a circus.\" principal member juicy | says. \"You wouldn't believe the crap we go through every day.\" But after numerous delays, the rap troupe's new album is finally on target for release. Among the guests on \"Last 2 Walk\" are Akon on \"That's Right.\" Good Charlotte on \"My Own Way,\" Unk on the single \"I'd Rather\" and Juicy ]'s brother Project Pat on \"Lolli LolU {Pop That Body).\" UJeezer \"Weezer\" (DGC/lnterscope, June 24) Weczcr is literally all over the place on its third self-titled album, with all four members taking a turn behind the mic. The music is just as hard to pin down, from tlic six-minute \"Greatest Man\" (which sutures a sweet piano melody to lliick power diords and fakecrowd noise). \"Heart Songs' (which unironically salutes Nirvana's \"Nev- ermind\" for inspiring frontman Rivers Cuomo to start his own band), the proto-Red Hot Chili Peppers funk of\" Dreamin' \"and the swaggering, rifiy' \"Automatic,\" sung by dnmimer Pat Wilson. \"It definitely feels like there's a lot more of our energ>' that over the years has been kind of pent up and now has been released and is flowing freely between the four of us.\" Cuomo says. The single \"Pork and Beans\" is No. 1 on Billboard's Modem Rock chart this week. 5hinedoiijn \"The Sound of Madness\" (Atlantic. June 24) Brent Smith wasn't going to let anything deter him from making Shinedown's third album — not a sharp sales decline between 2003's \"Leave a Whisper\" and 20O5's \"Us and Them.\" or the loss ofbandmates jasin Todd and Brad Stewart. \"Tins is a record that needed to be made.\" Smith says. He and drummer Barry Kerch enlisted Rob Cavallo to produce the set. and with Cavallo's en- couragement Smith wrote nearly 60 songs, of which 15 were recorded. Among them are his first political song — first single \"Devour.\" which is \"about George W. Bush and the end of his presidency\" — and Smith's first straight-uplove song, \"If You Only Knew.\" \"We wanted it loud and wanted it big and heavy and grandiose,\" Smith says.

On its sophomore set. the group again trades in sexy dance grooves (the Gwen Stefani-ish \"Reggae All Night,\" retro synth-fest \"Left Behind\"), chugging indie rock (\"Give Up.\" \"Rat Is Dead [Rage]\") and uptempo pop maneuvers (\"How I Became Para- noid.\" the Bangles-worthy \" Move\") . all of which should sound great blaring out of hipster stereos this summer. Common \"Invincible Summer\" (Geffen, July TBD) Chicago rapper Common may be known for his stimulating lyrics, but for \"Invincible Summer,\" due this summer via Universal, he shamelessly admits that \"barbecues and strippers\" were some of his main inspirations- \"This album isn't super thought-provoking . . . it's just on some fun shit,\" Common says of his eighth album. He teamed with Pharrell and Mr. DJ (OutKast). and concocted a hip- hop/techno/dance sound heavy with kazoos and double-speed drum patterns. Tracks like the Cee-Lo-assisted \"Make My Day,\" stripper- inspired \"Sex is Sugar\" and first single \"Universal Mind Control.\" which will be serviced to radio in May, are all included. Santogold is set to appear on a track titled \"Runaway,\" while jeff B, StarTrak's Chester French and Musina make guest appearances as well. Staind \"The Illusion of Progress\" (Atlantic, July TBD) \"It's a departure from the last record, \" Staind frontman Aaron Lewis says. The group hasn't even come up with titles for the songs, ac- cording to Lewis, but \"there's a lot more effect-y experimentation and a lot more textures with vintage instruments and vintage amps.\" Tlie band has been recording at the studio that Lewis keeps in his barn with producer Johnny K. And while Staind previously swore 10 rock even harder this time out, Lewis says it's aware of pressure for another ballad-style track along the lines of such hits as \"Out- side\" and \" It's Been Awhile.\" \"That's what the record label wants,\" he says. \"You're foolish not to [be aware] of that.\" nUGUST Conor Oberst \"Conor Oberst\" (Merge, Aug. S) The biggest surprise on Conor Oberst's first solo album since a cassette-only release from his teenage years might be the label that's releasing it After a decade- plus association with Saddle Creek in his hometown of Omaha, Neb., tlie Bright Eyes principal inked with Merge for this self-titled afiair, recorded in Januar)' and February inTepozdan. Mexico. Longtimecollaborator Andy LcMas- ter assisted with the recording, which Oberst produced. Slipknot TBA (Roadrunner, Aug. 12) Slipknot's fans, the Maggots, have two things to cheer about this summer the band's first studio album in nearly four years and a main-stage slot on the Rockslar Energy Drink Mayhem tour. The masked metal act's follow-up to \"Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)\" — which debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 in June 2004 — is \"going to fuck with people,\" vocalist Corey Taylor says. \"It's heavy, man.\" Since the release of \"Vol. 3,\" members of Slipknot have spent time pursuing solo musical projects. But the lowa-based nine-piece returns this summer with a new sense of musical con- fidence and maturity. Taylor says. Plus, the metal outfit's \"evolved\" costumes and masks arc darker than ever. The Jonas Brothers TBA (Hollywood. Aug. 12) On their hotly anticipated new album, expect \"the same Jonas Brothers sound, but with just a cou- ple more influences,\" says Nick Jonas, who names Elvis Costello. the Animals, the Rascals and the Beatles by way of example. Look for such tracks as \"Don'tTake My Heart and Put It on the Shelf.\" \"Burning Up\" and \"A Little Bit Longer.\" the last of which Jonas wrote about his struggle with di- abetes. \"The l)rical content has gotten a little more in-depth as far as who we are as people and our personal lives, widi our dating and all diat — things we've gone through in the past year. \" Jonas says. T.I. \"Paper Trail\" (Grand Hustle/Atlantic, Aug. 12) The good; T. I . may very well wind up with another hit album once \" Paper Trail\" hits stores. The bad: Afterward, the superstar rapper is headed to jail for a year on felony gim charges. There's a tinge of gospel on recent leak \"No Matter What.\" whileclub track \"What's Up. What's Happening.\" produced by Danja. is likely to be the first single. Also expected are \"Sitting on Top of the World,\" \"I'm lllin'.\" \"Collect Call\" and tlie J.R.

Highlights include the Jazmin Sulli- van-assisted \"Like When You Play the Music,\" dnim-heav>' \"Hip- Hop Don't Die\" and sensual \"Milk & Cookies.\" on which Elliott lightheartedly harmonizes about her capabilities in the bedroom.

Solanqe Knouules \"Sol-Angel and the Hadley Street Dreams\" (Music World Entertainment/Geffen, Aug. 26) \"Her record is totally bananas,\" CrffTcn chairman Ron Fair says of Beyonce sibling Solange Knowles' label debut, \"it's not what peo- ple would expect from her The mu.sic is more eclectic and interna- tional.

I want to take scenarios and turn them into records and vice versa.\" So far, tlie set features production from Dj Toomp, Kanye West. Just Blaze, Swizz Beatz and Polow Da Don. Ogm Class Heroes \"The Quilt: Starring Gym Class Heroes\" (Decaydence/Fueled by Ramen, August TBD) Gym Class Heroes arc planning on taking a \"movie approach\" to their sophomore album, according to lead vocalist Travis McCoy. \"Everyone is going to be part of the cast as opposed to being fea- tured.\" he says. \"You won't know who is on the album just by look- ing at the liner notes. You'll know only if you listen and recognize the person's voice. \" Ne-Yo. Lil Wayne, John Oates, K-OS and Busta Rliymes are among the guests, while Cool & Dre and Fall Out Boy's Patrick Stump have assisted with production.

On other tracks, tlie singer/mu- sician shifts from Jimi Hendrix-spiked soul to Marvin Gaye mellow. Rewrote and produced the entire album, forgoing cameos. That's a departure from his 2006 platinum breakthrough, \"The Evolution of Robin Thicke,\" which he co-wTote and co-produced with the Nep- tunes and sported guest turns from Lil Wayne and Pharrell. Ludacris \"Theater of the Mind\" (DTP/Def Jam, September TBD) For an artist who began as a comical MC.

And after singing for Timbaiand via tele- phone. Hilson says she was signed on the spot. Now. the Atlanta native is ready to use her chart-topping skills for her own album.

His 2001 proj- ect \"Kamaal the Abstract\" has never seen the light of day, and \"The Renaissance\" is now on its third release date in the past 18 months. To freshen up the music. Q-Tip samples a Barack Obama speech on the as-yet-unnamed opening track. \"He's a fresh new voice and an alternative from what we've seen in the political scene in some time,\" he says. Norah Jones.

I talk about relationships, love, enchantment, feeling good — the whole gamut.\" Key (racks: the rock-tinged \"Johnny Dead\" and the relationship-driven \"Man Woman Boogie.\" Ryan Leslie TBA (Next Selection/Universal) If Ryan Leslie's recent New York gig — where he brought a jaded music industry crowd to its feet — is any indication ofhis star power, the Harvard graduate is doing pretty well for himself. The producer/ songwriter /solo artist wrote and produced Ctssie's 2006 seif-titled debut and is enjoying the success ofhis single \"Diamond Girl,\" which has been remixed by G- U nil and Kanye West. Solely produc- ing and penning his entire album. Leslie calls the as-yet-unti- tlcd set a dream come true. \"It's almost surreal,\" he says. \"I've been signed to Universal for five years and now I have a record for myself that's got everyone's attention.\" R. Kelly \"12 Play: Fourth Quarter\" (Jive) No matter the turmoil in his personal life (his protracted trial on child pornography charges was set to begin May 9, after press time), R. Kelly remains one of the most reliable hit- makers in pop. \"Producers have come and gone over the last ! 5 years, but Robert's mu- sical compass is second to none,\" )ive sen- ior VP of urban marketing/promotion Larry Khan says. And barely a year since the re- lease of last year's \"Double Up,\" he's plot- ling a summer release for another new album. Details on the project are slim, but first single \"Hair Braider,\" an ode to a special lady, is already climbing Billboard's Hot R&B/ Hip-Hop Songs chart. BiqBoi \"Sir Luscious Left Foot . . . Son of Chico Dusty\" (Jive) OutKast's Big Boi plucked the title ofhis solo debut from his own alias (Sir Luscious Left Foot) and his father's first name (Chico Dust)'). The MC worked with his usual Organized Noise produc- tion crew as well as newcomer Mr. D). who crafted the single \"Royal Flush.\" The second sin- gle will be \"The World Is Too Big,\" featuring Mary ).

(Terminate on Site)\" (Interscope) 50 Cent lost last year's much-hyped first-week sales battle with Kanye West, but he's back in the ring with a new G- Unit album this summer. Timbaland, Swizz Beatz. Ron Brownz, Polow Da Don and Eminem have been tapped as producers, and 50 says 'T.O.S.\" embodies G-Unit's trademark aggression. However, tJie album's first sin- gle. \"1 Like the Way She Do It,\" appeals to the ladies. \"Women influence a lot,\" 50 Cent says. \"They run the dancefloor If there's a song that I can't stand but a girl runs to the dancefloor, I'm right on it\" Beck TBA (Interscope) They're both genre-jump>ers who've scored left-field mainstream successes, so a Beck/Danger Mouse pairing makes more sense than one might think. The duo shared produc- tion on the follow-up to Beck's 2(X)(i album \"The Information,\" coming up with 1 0 stripped-down songs with a lean-and-mean rvm- ning time of slightly more than 30 minutes. Sources say the album is likely to just appear witliout fanfare, similar to the Raconteurs' recent release. Look for a guest appearance by Cat Power as well. Scars on BroaduuaLj \"Scars on Broadway\" (TBA) Scars on Broadway's debut album won't be the follow-up to System of a Down's chart-topping 2005 releases \"Mezmerize\" and \" Hypno- tize,\" but the \"vibeof my writing is still there,\" says vocalist/guitarist Daron Malakian, who wrote 95% of SOAD's material |oined by Sys- tem drummer John Dolmayan and a slew of other musicians, Malakian says the forthcoming Scars on Broadway album is more rock-driven than metal. \"Ifs more melodic than ever.\" Dolmayan says, adding that the band will likely tour toward the end of summer. The SubujaLjs \"All or Nothing\" (Infectious/Warner Music) U.K. garage rock trio the Subways faced some potentially combustible challenges before hitting Los Angeles last summer to record its soph- omorealbum with producer Butch Vig. Earlier in the year. fi\"ontman Billy Lunn had throat nodule surgery, requiring a four-month recov- ery period. \"It was one of the scariest things ever.\" says the 23-ycar- old, who also split up witli his fiancee, the band's bassist Charlotte Cooper \"This whole record was a therapy session,\" Lunn says. \"It's made us more of a unit than we ever were.\" The new set. due June 30 internationally and later this summer in North America via Sire, is \"much, much heavier,\" Lunn says. \"We just can't wait to tour it\" Additional reporting hy Michael D.

But that was back when hits were more plentiful, before labels started hoarding them all for the fourth quarter. Still, while summer ain't what it used to be for music retailers, certain characteristics still help distinguish it from a marketing standpoint. Since the ijeginning of this decade, \"the release sched- ules for the majors are off during the summer.\" leaving room for independents. RED president Bob MorelH says. \"Summer is a strong season for touring, so we start ticking into very strong sales. For rock repertoire, the summer is a very significant season.\" Beggars Group head of sales Rusty Clarke says labels at her company also tend to have a packed release schedule during )une, July and August, especially if bands are on the road. Vans Warped, Ozzfest and other pack- aged rock tours are generally scheduled during summer months, as are festivals like Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza, all of which expose up-and-coming rock bands. Last year, for instance, according to in- dustry observers, Paramore started to break during its appearance on Warped. After debuting the week ending June 17. 2007. with 42.000 scans, then falling into the 13.000-15.000 range for the next two months, sales of Paramore\"s \"Riot!\" rcignitcd in the last weeks of August, eventually climb- ing to 33.000 copies before dropping back into the teens again. To date, according to Nielsen SoundScan. the album has sold 864.000 units. And Paramore wasn't the only Warped tour act to [>eak last summer — Chiodos. Circa Survive. Tiger Army, Boys Like Girls and others also charted high on the Billboard 200 between June and December. Merchants agree that rock tours and festivals do in- deed drive summer sales for baby bands. \"If you have midlevel things that you can work through the sum- mer and you can get bands in front of people in the rock tours,\" Newbury Comics buyer Carl Mello says, \"you can get some kind of success.\" Just not the level of suc- cess the industry used to achieve: \"The drivers.\" Mello adds, \"don't drive records as far as they used to.\" Even the majors know that their tendency to hold back big releases until the fourth quarter creates op- portunities for smaller bands. \"We use the summer to bring attention to all our new freshman- and sopho- more-type bands, who tend to release albums during the summer to coincide with the summer festival tour- ing season,\" the head of sales at a major label says. \"Certainly, the co"
