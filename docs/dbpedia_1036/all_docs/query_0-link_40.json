        "text": "SOUNDTRACK: KING’S X-Tape Head (1998).\n\nTape Head follows the relatively gentle and harmonious Ear Candy with a serious blast of groov-y heavy metal. The album is solidly consistent and very smooth. Despite the heaviness of many of the tracks, it doesn’t have a lot of the angular/unusual chords of their earlier records. It also doesn’t juxtapose them with magnificent harmonies. Rather, we get a lot of group vocals making for a very full sound.\n\nAgain, there’s not really a bad song in the bunch, and after a couple listens, you’ll get the melodies stuck in your head. “Groove Machine” starts off the record with a heavy riff. It’s one of the darkest songs on the disc. “Over and Over” is one of the most bass heavy ballads that Kings X have done. It’s not a heavy song, per se, but typically, like “Goldilox” or “Mississippi Moon,” the ballad is mostly acoustic guitars. This one however uses the bass as the prime mover of the song. It’s still a ballad though, and quite a pretty one.\n\n“Ono” is probably the quintessential song to describe Tape Head, though. Not that it’s the best song, but it’s like the album in a nutshell: Riff heavy verses, beautiful choruses (heavy but smooth, not aggressive sounding) and then a wild guitar solo. “Ocean” is a great addition to the Ty-sung canon that has been building since Faith Hope Love. “Little Bit of Soul” is one of their catchiest, smoothest numbers of this period; it’s followed by “Hate You” which is not as heavy as you might expect. “Mr Evil” is the most early- King’s X-sounding of the bunch, where the guitar lines take precedence and the harmonies all come back.\n\nIt’s a great, solid disc and a nice companion to Ear Candy.\n\n[READ: September 25, 2008]: The Sirens of Titan\n\nContinuing my series of Kurt Vonnegut books, I progress to The Sirens of Titan. And, while I applaud Vantage Books for the line of all of the Vonnegut titles having that big V on the cover, check out those early releases! So cool.\n\nAnyhow, I had never even heard of this book, so I held very low expectations for it. I was astonished at not only how funny it was but just how much I enjoyed it.\n\nMuch of this book seems to be, if not a launching point, at least a basis for many of Vonnegut’s most famous pieces. Tralfamadore, made famous in Slaughterhouse Five, is introduced here. As is Vonnegut’s love of time travel and even space travel. (more…)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nSOUNDTRACK: KING’S X-Ear Candy (1996).\n\nI think of Ear Candy as King’s X most upbeat record musically. Even the cover is upbeat! It’s their first cover in ages which isn’t dark and forbidding. It actually has a white border! And of course, it’s hard to miss the psychedelic, brightly colored scarab beetle.\n\nAnd the music matches the cover really well. The opener, “The Train” is a catchy bit of near psychedelic rock which brings Ty’s vocal to the front. It seems to set the tone for the rest of the album. Even “Picture” contains a simple guitar riff reminiscent of the joy of Out of the Silent Planet.\n\nI’m jumping down to “Mississippi Moon,” one of their supremely pretty songs ala “Goldilox.” It’s more of a bluesy ballad, but the chorus is just amazing.\n\n“A Box” continues the loveliness from the beginning of the album. Its message, that there’s no room inside a box, seems to apply to the band’s more claustrophobic sounds as of late. But lest you think they’ve gone soft, “Looking for Love” is a fabulous rocker, which makes me think of Thin Lizzy.\n\nEar Candy also features “American Cheese (Jerry’s Pianto)” a rare track with Jerry Gatskill on lead vocals. It contains the most Beatlesque sounds of a band that is full of Beatlesque sounds. This one maintains a great deal more psychedelia than previous songs. It’s not prog rock by any means, it’s just straight up psychedelia.\n\nLyrically, Doug opens up about his loss of faith; “Run” addresses it directly: “Yeah she told me, that if I wasn’t good He would get me, make me pay for everything I did, and she said that everybody bad would burn in Hell. I did what she told me and I became someone else.”\n\nDespite the negative feelings in the above song, musically the album is very positive: a lot of the distorted riffs are toned down, and the album feels less angry. I think this disappoints some of the band’s fans, but it retains such authentic King’s X sounds that it’s hard to argue with it.\n\n[READ: September 5, 2008] “Springtide,” “Other People’s Money,” “The Position” “Factory” & “Abstract”.\n\nIn 2007, Forbes magazine asked five authors to write about this scenario: “It’s the year 2027, and the world is undergoing a global financial crisis. The scene is an American workplace.” I discovered these stories when I was looking up some information about Max Barry (I had just read Company). I was surprised to see that the stories were in Forbes, but whatever. When I saw that there were five authors given the assignment I decided to try all five.

I bought it mostly for Garbage’s “Kick My Ass” and Mary Margaret O’Hara’s “Florida”, not for Chesnutt, who I’d not heard of before then. Usually if you get a CD of covers of an artist that you like, it’s hard to remove the cover from the original. An album of covers by someone you don’t know is much easier to parse.\n\nI got North Star Deserter because I’m a fan of the Constellation record label based in Montreal. They’ve released some great stuff over the years. Recently, they’ve diversified their lineup to include some unexpected artists. Like Vic Chesnutt.\n\nThe basic sound of this CD comes in two ways: acoustic guitar with world-weary singer, and acoustic guitar with world-weary singer and the baking cacophony of what is essentially Thee Silver Mt Zion Orchestra and Tra La La Band. It works surprisingly well.\n\nThe first song starts out with basically just Vic and his guitar. He sings in a raspy weathered voice. It’s a short acoustic song full of passion. What threw me off here is that you expect that the whole album will be like this: short, passionate, acoustic songs. The really unexpected part comes with song three, “Everything I Say,” when the backing band kicks in loud and hard. Silver Mt Zion, for those unfamiliar are an offshoot of sorts from Godspeed You Black Emperor. They have a great variety of instruments in the group, and much like Godspeed… they play grand, sweeping orchestral works. Unlike Godspeed, they have vocals. And while backing Vic, they pull out all of the stops: cellos, contrebass, choruses, Casio keyboards, the works.\n\nPerhaps my favorite song of the bunch is “You Are Never Alone.” The premise is simple: Vic sings some very stark verses (“It’s OK, you can take a condom; It’s OK, you can get an abortion; It’s OK, you can get a quadruple bypass and then keep on, keeping on.”), and then the chorus slowly builds with first the men, then the women harmonizing and then finally everyone singing beautifully “You Are Never Alone.” It’s 5 minutes of mesmerizing beauty.\n\nAnd the rest of the album continues in a similar vein: stark, humanizing lyrics and alternating spare guitar or great swells of music.\n\nOverall, I feel like the album runs a little long (or maybe it’s just exhausting to listen to). But I can’t think of anything to get rid of; the two longest songs are actually two songs that I really like. “Splendid” is a slow building song, where you don’t realize that 5 minutes have already gone past. And then there’s “Debriefing.” The first two minutes are noisy and brash, they settle down into a short sparse verse and then crash away for two more minutes. Off and on like that for 8 minutes. Cathartic to say the least.\n\nThe strangest thing for me is that I find Vic’s voice to be similar in tone and style to Matthew Sweet. There’s a few songs where you might even think that it’s Matthew Sweet singing. But this Matthew Sweet sounds not like the pop singer of “Girlfriend” but like a man who has been beaten down by life for a little while. It’s a voice that you instantly listen to to see if you can learn anything.\n\nI’m not sure if this will make me get any more Chesnutt discs, but I’m glad I got this one.\n\n[READ: September 15, 2008] “Great Experiment”\n\nJeffrey Eugenides wrote The Virgin Suicides, a great book notable for its use of first person plural narrator (!). He also wrote Middlesex, which is on my bedside right now (and which I learned today was an Oprah pick). But in the interim I just read this short story. It’s my only exposure to Eugenides aside from Virgin Suicides, so it’s a nice change.\n\nThis story centers around Kendall, an over-educated, hyper-literate poet who is making a living working for a non-profit company. This particular non-profit was founded by Jimmy Dimon, a former porn king who apparently grew a heart and decided to publish great books at a loss. Kendall’s current assignment is to edit down Alexis de Tocqueville’s Democracy in America‘s most cogent ideas into a small pocket version called Pocket Democracy.

Mike Ford has a wonderful voice, a great knack for songwriting and an ability to do multiple genres in one setting. Couple that with the history of Canada and it’s win-win! Volume One covers Canada pre-1905, with Volume Two covering up to the present.\n\nI admit to not knowing very much about the song topics on the disc, which is fine, as I learned something new. And, much like with the two Ferguson books, Mike Ford clearly loves Canada, and is willing to celebrate it without hiding any flaws that might be found. Which is as it should be for an album or book of this nature: Don’t hide the warts; celebrate the whole picture.\n\nMusically, the disc is as varied as the subject matter. “I’m Gonna Roam” is a folk song done in a rap style. “Turn Them Oot” is a sea shantyesque sing-along about the Family Compact (and what a great rabble-rouser it is). The most rocking song, “Sir John A (You’re OK)” is sort of a mock metal song (it’s as metal as a folkie can get…with a chorus from a Grade 7 class). Imagine rocking the line “RESIDUAL POWERS!”\n\nThere’s even a song that sounds as if it was recorded on an old wax cylinder (“Canada Needs You”). I like this song especially because it is a satire of early 20th century Canadian government attempts to get people to move to Canada (much like the Go West Young Man of the US). A little snippet of lyrics:\n\nThere’s an abundance of everything in Western Canada\n\nWhere it’s never ever (hardly ever) cold\n\nAnd the streets are paved with gold\n\nAnd you grow rutabegas bigger than a loaf of bread\n\ntomatoes bigger than a horse’s head\n\nThere’s milk and honey and a kitchen sink\n\nThere’s never any bugs or drought and the farts don’t stink\n\nSome other topics include: a young Native woman who inspired her people (“Thanadelthur”); the voyageurs–with canoe sounds (“Les Voyageurs”); the fact and fiction of the treasure buried on Oak Island, Nova Scotia (“The Oak Island Mystery”); and the importance of Canadian women (“A Woman Works Twice as Hard”).\n\nPerhaps the most fun song on the disc (for style and content) is “I’ve Been Everywhere” in which Ford lists thousands of Canadian towns at superfast speed. Great good fun. Moncton, Moncton, Moncton, Moncton.\n\nAll the lyrics are available in PDF here. And facts and background info about the songs are available here. With all of these resources, you’re bound to learn something new about Canada!\n\n[READ: September 2008] How to Be a Canadian\n\nNow this is what I expecting from Why I Hate Canadians–a funny, tongue in cheek look at Canada and all of its quirks. I got this book on the same trip as Why I Hate Canadians, and since I just read that one, I figured, why not keep it going. So this book is co-written by Will and his brother Ian Ferguson (apparently there are Fergusons littered across the US and Canada, as their services are called upon throughout the book). And, hard to tell if this is true, but based on the previous book, Ian must be the funny one in the family, as this book is very funny indeed.

But most notably, he did the theme songs (opening and closing) for Corner Gas. At last, “My Happy Place” the Closing Credits song has now been released on this disc by The New Odds. (The Opening Credits song “Not a Lot Goin On” is available on the disc that Northey made with Jesse Valenzuela, cleverly titled Northey Valenzuela. I mention Corner Gas aside from the fact that it’s a great show, because I mention it in the book write up below as well. But back to the Odds.\n\nThe Odds had a minor hit in 1993 with “Heterosexual Man” (which we all thought was hilarious). I didn’t really think much about them until my friend Amber from Vancouver sent me a tape of Bedbugs. I was surprised how much I liked it and how, although the band was funny, they weren’t a novelty act at all.\n\nI’ve enjoyed the Odds very much since then, they’ve appeared on a number of soundtracks, and r eleased four solid albums, especially 1996’s Nest.\n\nThe New Odds are, as you might guess, the Odds, only new. 3 of the 4 original members are back, and aside from updating their sound to the twenty-first century, the band isn’t radically different. They play what used to be called college music, but which really is more or less alternative or even just rock music.\n\nAs with previous Northey output, the lyrics are witty and clever, with some wordplay in evidence. There’s a pretty diverse collection of sounds on the record, yet they all stay within the range of alternative guitar pop. One or two songs rock harder than the others, “Leaders of the Undersea World” sounds like a dose of heavy metal in comparison to the rest of the record. “Write it in Lightning” is also a pretty good song, and “I Can’t Get You Off” has a wonderfully catchy hook to it.\n\nNorthey’s voice is easily described as inoffensive, and the music is catchy but not stick-in-your-head catchy. It’s not a ringing endorsement, but it’s also not a put-down. Like meat and potatoes, it’s a good staple to any alternative fans’ collection.\n\n[READ: August 28, 2008] Why I Hate Canadians\n\nI bought this book several years ago, probably in 2000, when I was visiting Montreal. I remember being very excited to visit Chapters and to see what kind of books they had that weren’t available down south. I was especially interested in the humor section as I had just started watching Mike Bullard, and I knew he wasn’t available in the States. I found Bullard’s book as well as two books about Canada by the Fergusons. Why it took me 8 years to read them, I don’t know.\n\nThis book is listed as a humour book; the copyright page has it listed as 1. Canada-Humor 2. Canadian wit and humor (English). But the thing is that the book isn’t very funny. Even with an outrageous title like that, it’s not very funny. It is however, a fantastic introduction to the history of Canada written in a style that is (yes) funnier than your average textbook.\n\nDIGRESSION: I will state that I realize that Will Ferguson has a perspective, and quite often he’s very vocal about his perspective. Most good history is written with an acknowledged bias–trying to hide your bias makes for dull (or hypocritical) history. So, Ferguson’s history of Canada may not be Accurate, (especially if you are a Quebecois) and of course, I’d be interested to hear from those who disagree with him; however, to an American who is not well versed in the history of Canada, it was pretty enlightening. (more…)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nSOUNDTRACK: KING’S X: Dogman (1994).\n\nDogman follows up King’s X with, to my mind, a much more satisfying collection. It starts of with the fantastic “Dogman,” a great chance for Doug to show off his vocal range. “Shoes” has some great gospelish harmonies that lead to a wonderfully chunky riff. And “Pretend” sounds about as close to early King’s X as this newish King’s X gets: soaring harmonies and a great guitar line. “Black the Sky” brings back some of those dissonant chords that Ty does so well and it all wraps up in a gorgeous, heavy chorus. And a song like “Sunshine Rain” has the effect of sounding like the older King’s X harmonies with a difference: it’s more of a minor key harmony. It’s really beautiful.\n\nThe rest of the album is a diverse selection of heavy, heavy rockers (“Complain” and “Human Behavior” which is just heavy and brutal and yet still catchy) and complex, more mellow tunes “Flies and Blue Skies” and “Cigarettes”). The seriously heavy “Go to Hell” is possibly the most psycho (as opposed to psychedelic) thing the band has done, but it only lasts for 51 seconds.\n\nThis is a fantastic album, and it may be why I like King’s X a little bit less.\n\n[READ: September 8, 2008] “Yurt”\n\nEvery time I see this author’s name I think to myself, her name gets harder to say as you go along. That’s not really relevant but it makes me smile.\n\nAnyhow, this story intrigued me because it was about middle school teachers. (more…)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nSOUNDTRACK: KING’S X-King’s X (1992).\n\nI was rather disappointed by this album when it came out. After the glories of Faith Hope Love, this was a return to some pretty straight ahead metal. And, boy is it heavy–well, the first song is anyway, and it does rather set the tone. Nevertheless, the rest of the songs have subtleties that I have grown to appreciate.\n\n“Black Flag” was the single from the album. There has always been something about it that I don’t quite like. I can’t put my finger on it. However, the should-have-been single “Lost in Germany” returns stylistically to the sounds of Out of the Silent Planet, and contains a great sing-along chorus and harmonies. In fact, the bulk of the middle of the disc keeps up those mildly progressive traits.\n\nOverall, however, the disc is quite a bit darker than Faith Hope Love. It comes as a shock after the previous record, but then King’s X are a much heavier band than I remember.\n\n[READ: September 6, 2008] “Clara”\n\nThis is the first story I’ve read by Bolaño (although I have been planning to tread The Savage Detectives).\n\nI know that this story was translated from Spanish, and I can’t help but wonder if I would have guessed it was translated while I was reading it. There was something just slightly off abut the use of language…not that the translator did a bad job, just something that made me think the author was not writing in the same language that I use. (more…)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nFor reasons that are not clear to me, this upcoming Presidential election is evidently going to be very close.\n\nThink of yourself as an employer (which is what you are in this case). Do you hire the 72 year old man who thinks things in your company are going great and should continue on the track they’ve been going, or do you pick the 47 year old man with energy, ideas and a plan to make your company even better? The choice seems pretty obvious…do you want to look to the past or the future.\n\nCory Doctorow’s Little Brother got me thinking about this election in a slightly different way, especially with his slogan “Never trust anyone under 25.”\n\nIf you’re under 25 (or even under 30, let’s be honest) and thinking of voting for McCain, you really need to double and triple check yourself.\n\nOh, and if you’re eligible to vote and you’re thinking of skipping this election, then this paragraph is just for you. I’m not going to preach anything about how to run your life, but I want to impress this upon you: it will take just a few minutes to vote. This election has the potential to impact your future in monumental ways. You may not even give a moments thought to what your life will be like in twenty years. But imagine how mad your future self will be if things turn out rotten in twenty years and you think, if I had only voted in 2008, I could have made a difference. So, go vote. Your future self will thank you.\n\nAnyhow, there are dozens of reasons not to vote for McCain and you can find them just about anywhere. But this particular reason is of special interest to anyone under 25: McCain is not interested in the internet or email. This is not recent news. It was stated in an interview with the New York Times in July. Read this excerpt from July 13, 2008:\n\nQ: But do you go on line for yourself?\n\nMr. McCain: They go on for me. I am learning to get online myself, and I will have that down fairly soon, getting on myself. I don’t expect to be a great communicator, I don’t expect to set up my own blog, but I am becoming computer literate to the point where I can get the information that I need – including going to my daughter’s blog first, before anything else.\n\nQ: Do you use a blackberry or email?\n\nMr. McCain: No\n\nMark Salter: He uses a BlackBerry, just ours.\n\nMr. McCain: I use the Blackberry, but I don’t e-mail, I’ve never felt the particular need to e-mail. I read e-mails all the time, but the communications that I have with my friends and staff are oral and done with my cell phone.\n\nI highlighted the parts in red that are particularly astonishing. (And this is before one of McCain’s staffers said that McCain helped to invent the Blackberry.) (more…)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nSOUNDTRACK: BE YOUR OWN PET-Get Awkward (2008).\n\nBe Your Own Pet are a bunch of young kids from Nashville. Get Awkward is their second album. According to the liner notes, two of them were born in 1988 and one of them in 1990. 1990! They play three-chord punk music which focuses primarily on having fun and partying. I like to think that Black Flag’s “TV Party” might be an influence, but really they sound more like The Muffs than anyone else. Jemima Pearl is one of those surprisingly cute punk singers who explode in a gruff gravelly voice (although never TOO rough or gravely) which makes all the proceedings quite fun.\n\nThe songs are short (only 2 songs are over 3 minutes), fast, and generally fun. Song titles like “Food Fight,” “Zombie Graveyard Party!” “Bitches Leave” and “Bummer Time” should give you some sense of what the songs are about. I’m led to believe their first album was a bit more aggressive (enough to get Thurston Moore to sign them to his Ecstatic Peace record label). But this one keeps pretty well to the three chords (and occasional guitar riff) and fun shouting and singing.\n\nIt seems like every few years there’s a new young punk band who takes up the mantle of punk rock and BYOP were the most recent (although their web site says the just broke up). And it’s cool for young kids to have a new young band to look up to. Much like the theme of the book below, if you’re over 25 you ‘ll probably just think that this band is ripping off [insert your favorite brash young punk band here] but really who wants to listen to 40 year olds singing about parties and whatnot. So, if you’re looking for a new young band, then, check them out. There’s not too much new about them, but then, that’s not the point, is it.\n\nAnd according to Wikipedia, three tracks were removed because they were deemed too violent (!). Maybe the album is well suited to this book after all.\n\n[READ: September 16, 2008] Little Brother\n\nI have to get this out of the way: READ THIS BOOK! It is fantastic and it will motivate you like nothing I’ve read. READ IT READ IT READ IT.\n\nOkay, I feel a little better.\n\nI read an interview with Cory Doctorow in American Libraries, the magazine of the American Library Association. It was a short interview about this book, and he said such great things in a few paragraphs, that I immediately went to work and checked out the book. And, wow, what a fantastic book.\n\nThis may be the kiss of death for any young reader, but Little Brother is an important book. And everyone should read it. And yes, I know it is fiction, but fiction can be a very powerful tool for waking people up to injustice. Upton SInclair’s The Jungle was instrumental in the creation of the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, which established the Food and Drug Administration. Not bad for a work of fiction, eh? (more…)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\n[RE–READ September 16, 2008] “The Case of the Severed Hand”\n\nOne shouldn’t be afraid of criticism. Heck, if you’re going to have an opinion you have to expect people will argue with you. I didn’t like this story when I read it. But, when Daniel commented, even though the criticism was basically, “I liked the story and you’re a stupid doodyhead” I figured that maybe I missed something. I searched for the story again, and while browsing, I learned that The L Magazine (which I’ve never heard of) had its Best of New York City Awards and “The Case of the Severed Hand” was voted 1 of 5 BEST SHORT STORIES PUBLISHED BY NYC PUBLICATIONS, although no explanation or review of the story was given. I’ve also learned that Coover is a highly regarded author and is known primarily for his metafiction. I had reviewed and enjoyed Stepmother a few months ago.\n\nSo, I have now re-read the short story to see if I had indeed missed something. And, again, I believe I did not. The first part plays as a tongue in cheek noir and is rather funny. The end plays as straight private eye stuff and is also rather funny. And the middle piece was a funny little piece about incest! I had said that I don’t know the detective genre very well, so aside from the obvious parody aspects of it–or maybe not even parody, maybe just playing withe the genre–I’m not sure how much I’m missing (that a fan of the genre would get).\n\nThe thing for me is that the parts don’t work together. Whatever he was trying to get across between these sections of story was just lost. And, to be blunt, I just didn’t like it. If I enjoyed the world of private I’s more, I might have a better appreciation for what Coover is doing, but as it stands, I just don’t like it.\n\nIf you think the story works, however, please jot me a line and let me know how. I’d be very curious to know.\n\nRead Full Post »"
