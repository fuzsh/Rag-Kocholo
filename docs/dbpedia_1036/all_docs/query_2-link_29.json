Occasionally, the expectant iwers return to reflect on the mature re- sults. As the citj' embraces another autumn, a single woman named Madorma looks dovm from her Upper West Side aerie and contem- plates the equinoxes of the spirit as captured on \"Something To Re- member\" (Maverick/Sire/Wamer Bros., due Nov. 7), a 14-track trea- tise of her best old and nevv balladrj'. \"Listening to this I'ecorri took me on my owti journey,\" saj's Ma- donna with a sad smile, shifting on the couch in her apartment over- looking Central Park. \"Each song is Uke a map of my life.\" Dressed almost austerely in a snug, black skirt and pink sweater, her blond hair pulled back in a crisply tucked bun as she drinks hot tea, the performer shows the tensile grace of someone w^o takes excel- lent care of her ph.vsical form. The broad, rounded features of the care- less, young diva who cut \"Holiday\" in 1983 have vanished, howe\\'er, replaced by a narrower, subtler countenance that harsh experience has made handsome. \"I don't really listen to my recoixLs once I've done than,\" she says. \"I'm onto the next thing. And I think most of the time when my records come out, people are so distracted by so much fanfare and controversy that nobody pays attention to the music. But this is, for the most pait, a retrospective, and I just wanted to put it out in a verj' simple way. The songs. the\\' choke me up,\" she adds with a nervous chuckle, \"and / wrote them. Isn't that weu-d? I can't tell you how painful the idea of singing 'Like A Virgin' or 'Material Girl' is to me now. I didn't urite either of those songs and wasn't digging deep then. I also feel more con- nectetl emotionally to the music I'm wiiting now, so it's more of a pleasure to do it\" Madonna has included three new songs on the col- lection; a mootly cover (in funky and orchesti*al ver- .'iions) of Marvin Gaye's 1976 hit \"I Want You.\" which was suggested and suK'^quentlj' pn>flucefl b>' Nellee Hooper and features Massh'e Attack, and two bitter- sweet serenades (\"You'll See\" and \"One More Chance\"), co-created with David Foster during the thiixl weekend of Sieptember in a whii'hvind wiiting/recordir^ session. Shortly after this lalk, she was to leave for London to start recording the music for the film version of \"Evita,\" the musical that \\ras the toast of BiYiadway in 1979 — the year Madonna wTote her fii*st song in the basement of a dormant Queeris, N.Y., sraagogue. \"I i-emember calling up my father back in Detroit and making him heai- it on the tai)e recorder o\\'er the phone.\" she confides, blushing. \"He said. *0h. that's ver>' nice.' I felt pix)ud. The song was calletl Tell The Truth.' \" Thas, \"Something To Remember\" l< a stock-taking axercise, as well as a faivwell to Madonna's first 15 years as a singer/songwriter, the record's pensive material delivering on the candid impulse that launched her remarkable career. Bom Aug. 16, 1958. in Bay City, Mich., Madonna is the eldest daughter of sL\\ children Iwm to defense engineer Sylvid .Anthnny Ciecone and the foi-mer Madonna Loui.se For- tin. A self-as.-^'ssed \"rullcr-cijaster Catholic,\" she grew up sharing the middle bunk in a three-tier bed with two of her sLstei*s. \"I didn't have any fi*ee time as a child,\" she says. \"My mother died of breast cancer when I was 7, and then my father remanied when I was 10. I had a lot of ivsponsibiUty, taking cai*e of my younger bi-othei-s and sistei*s.\" Like her siblings. Madonna was obliged to .'^tudy music, specif- ically piano. \"But I couldn't sit still, and I begged my father to let me take dance lessons,\" which sensed as a means of escape from the family's cramped home in a black/Hispanic neighbor- hood in Pontiac. Mich. Madonna was in the church choir and acted in school musicals, while sharing her mother's mantra-like habit of idly intoning her favorite tunes. \"As a teenager, I loved Aretha Franklin's 'A Natural Woman,' and in high school I wor- shipped Joni Mitchell and sang everything from 'Court And Spark,' my coming-of-age record.\" But her pivotal developmental trial was the death of her mother, and as Madonna passes this fall aftemoon di.'teussing the themes behind her often acutely wistful ballads, she ultimately says, \"My mother is part of a lot of my music.\" Although love songs, such as \"Live To Tell,\" \"One More Chance,\" and \"1*11 Remember,\" also invoke the early fever of a failed mar- riage to Sean Penn, tensions with a stepmother who could not re- place her lost parent, or later relationships that fell shoit, a larger phantom overshadows each mourning of life's missed linkages. \"I think about my mother and a certain empti- ne.ss — a longing — in my songs.\" Madonna explains. \"There are tragic, traumatic moments where I think, 'I wish that I could call my mother.' It's this primal thing that has been a springboard for the work 1 do.\" How did she learn her mother was gone? \"I was at my grandmother's house. The phone rang, and it was my father, and he told my grand- mother that my mother had died. I'd just seen her in the hospital. The rest of that day I blocked out — I probably went outside and played. I was miyorly into denial and didn't really understand.\" Poised on the edge of the couch. Madonna pauses and gulps, growing glassy-eyed. \"And it un- fortunately wasn't something that my father ever really prepared us for or discussed afterward. I suddenly developed a strange throwing-up disease, where every time I would leave the house. I would threw up. If I was away frem my father, I threw up. It was a neiTous condition.\" In recent years, when Madonna was under attack for her frank \"Erotica\" album and \"Sex\" book, the artist says she drew strength frem her late parent's non.iudgmental \"fen'or\" for fulfiUing one's personal vision: \"She had an unbelievable level of tolerance and for- giveness. She was tremendously religious in a really passionate — almost sexual — way, like she was in love with God. If you read the letters she wrote, even when she was sick and d.\\ing. she w'as com- pletely happy al>out eventhing. It was frightening, but there was just that faith of hers. My mother loved to take care of people. My older brothers and I were sometimes biaital to her, and she never complained.\" It sounds like the materfamilias had an essential serenity. \"Ex- actly,\" says her daughter. \"And I could prebably use more of it in my life.\" A brisk September breeze catches the leafy scent rising from the freshly mowed lawns of Central Park, the lang>' end-of-season smell betokening the coming .solstice. Madonna shivers slightly as she sips the last of hei* tea. \"I think my mother made people angiy, because they couldn't shake her beliefs.\" she concludes in a near whisper. \"And she was just 32 when she died — ^just a baby. Madonna Louise. So. basically, I'm here to take her place.\" THIS WEEK IN BILLBOARD SPEC S MUSIC TURNS TO SUPERSTORES In the face of increasing competition from multimedia retail giants, one music chain felt the need to react, and the idea for the Spec's superstore was born.

Fbr the past ei^t months, SACM has refused to effect its distribution of certain collected per- formance roj'alties to those masic puUishers who do not al.so utilize SACM for the collection of their mechanical roj'alties. An Internationa] dispute has resulted, the res- olution of which may w«ll depend on enforcement of the North American Free Trade Agreement and a change in Mexico's cop)Tight law. In order to fully understand this important and complex issue, some background information is necessar>: In the aftermath of NAFTA, the Mexican Ministry of E^iblic Education announced its intention to undertake a comprehensKe revision of the Federal Copyright Law and, in April 1994, invited interested parties to submit comments. The National Music Publishers' Assn., in con- junction with the International Intellectual Prop- erty Alliance, focused much of its input on the perceh'ed disparity between NAFTA and the Mexican copyright law concerning the estab- lishment and operation of authors' rights soci- eties. Although the copyright provisions of NAFTA are a relatively small component of the trade accord's massive ov'erall scope, their primary benefits for the U.S., Canadian, and Mexican entertainment industries were the explicit adop- tk>n of a \"national treatment\" standard (mean- ing that each of the three participating countries is required to accord to nationals of the others treatment that is \"no less fawrable\" than that which it accords its own) and NAFTA!s commit- ment to respect the full exercise, enjoyment, and enforcement of rights by contractual rights hold- ers. Of great significance to the SACM dispute is the fact that NAFTA!s national treatment oldig- ations extend to cross-border trade in services. With certain limited exceptions, service providers may not be required to maintain an office in, or be a resident ot a NAFTA country as a condition of operatkm. Citizenship or per- manent residence requirements for profession- al service providers are also to be phased out. Mexican law, however, requires that member- ship and management of authors' societies be limited to Mexican natkmals and foreigners liv- ing in Mexico. Because Mexican law enables SACM to collect royalties within that country, r^ardless of whether or not the representation of the repertoire being collected upon has been formally entrusted to that society U.S. and Cana- dian music publishers and their local represen- tatives are left with a situation whereby a de facto Mexican monopoly has the full right and authority to set royalty rates and collect royalty payments for the use of music — without any input from them vphatsoever As a result, U.S. and Canadian publishers have also had higher rates of commission assessed against their col- lections than their Mexican counterparts. In our June 19fti comments to the Mexican government, vve stressed that to be consistent with its NAFTA obligations, Mexican copyright law must ex[^tly provide that collecting soci- eties are obligated to pay royalties on the basis of national treatment and should not be aUowed to discriminate against foreign rights hokiers. Wfe also noted that, due to NAFTAs CCTnmitment to the full exercise, eiyoyment, and enforcement of rights by contractual ri^ts holders, the copy- right law should not require that claims for roy- alties nu^ be asserted only through a local, Mex- Kan society. We further stated that afRliation with collect- ing societies should be voluntary and that rights hokiers should be aUe to choose freely whether to participate in collective administration. Rights holders should have the flexibility to organize themselves voluntarily regarding the collectkKi, administration, and allocation of royalties, in order to get the greatest benefit from the expbitatbn of their wtrks. Creating competition could result in reduced administrative fees and a more timely distribution of coUeeted proceeds. '[Collecting societies] stiould not be allowed to dis- criminate against foreign rights holders.' Edward P. Murpliy is prwIdont/CEO of tha New York-based NaUonal Music Publishers' Assn. Finally, we noted that, according to NAFTA, rules of establishment should not contain nation- ality or domidliarj' requirements, and that par- ticipatkin in the societ}' should not be limited to indhiduals but shouM be open to musK publish- ing companies. While provisions concerning authors' societies are common in copyright laws around the wtirki, particulariy in Europe, their applicatkm in Mex- ico is significantly different, because Mexican law explicitly prohibits music publishers from joining SACM's membership. By contrast, Euro- pean authors' societies (with the singular excep- tion of Greece) all have music publishers repre- sented on their respective boards of directors. Although SACM had included music publish- ers in its distribution scheme, relations have always been strained, and publishers have had very little influence in the coUection or distribu- tion of their broadcast and performance income. And, until eight months ago, mechanical rights had traditionally been considered outside of the scope of SACM's monopoly; with the m^joity of music publishers licensing these private uses directly to record companies. SACM's attempt to add mechanical ro>'alties to its monopoly has been aided by Mexico's delay in releasing its draft copyright law amendments. This deUiK coupled with key personnel changes within the Mexican Ministry of Public Educa- tun, has resulted in stalled bilateral discussions with the U.S. government, to the particular detriment of music publishers in the U.S. and Canada under NAFTA. Thus, while the litigatkm brought by .SACM in Mexico against music publishers and record companies is proceeding, the music publishing community is receiving no public performance income, a portwn of which has been unilaterally placed in an escrow account by SACM. NME4 has brought the present controversy and the egregious economic harm suffered 1^ the U.S. music publishing community to the attention of the proper government authorities in Washington. With talks scheduled in late simi- mer, we will continue to monitor this situation while wwking with our colleagues, both here at home and south of the border, for an overall res- olution of the problem. LETTERS GOOD HEALTH FOR THE GEESE Michael Greene's commentary on musi- cians' health problems (Billboard, Sept. 16) may be well-meant, but it misses the single most important health factor regarding musi- cians: their state of poverty and/or financial insecurity. Although the record company will provide health benefits for its most lowly A&R man, most musicians under contract, not having performed enough sessions to qualify for their union health plan, are barely covered, if at all. While the A&R man is being flown, put up in good hotels, etc., the musician is paying for himself to drive thousands of miles on few hours' sleep in a van, sharing a hotel room shower with a bus full of companions, playing in smoky (and yes, loud) places — all to pro- mote the sales of a record that the record company gets the lion's share of. At a time when the music world is trum- peting its outrageous profit margins each year, the general state of the musician's con- tract is so usurious it would make even Ralph Nickleby (a Dickens character) chuckle with glee. As a shareholder of some record com- pany stock, I for one wouldn't mind a little iess profit in return for better upkeep of the geese laying these golden eggs. Peter Kaye Santa Monk^a. Calif. A TIME TO ACT Believing your editorial \"Acts Of Con- science...\" (Billboard, June 17) would be important reading, I cut it out to read later. I only got to it recently, and I was staggered by your clear, eloquent, accurate, and insightful positions. I have read few articles as perspicacwus, and, while I read oiJy the excerpts from it, the earlier editorial that you quoted C'Culture, Violence...\", Billboard, Dec. 25, 1993) sound- ed equally remarkable. To have writing of this calibre in a trade pubUcation is notable. I am faxing a copy to Sen. D'Amato of New York, whose fax number is 202-224-6871; to Sen. M^ority Leader Bob Dole, whose fax number is 202-228-1245; to my congress- woman; and to President Chnton, whose fax number is 202-456-2461; and I am sending a copy to Sen. Moynihan of New York, who does not have a public fax number (but whose mail- ing address is United States Senate, Wash- ington, D.C. 20510). I urge your other readers to take action as well, for as you said, \"Every person must hoM fast to his or her better self and act accord- ing to conscience.\" Thank you.

ASCAP Revamps Live-Show System Royalties Based On Actual No. Of Plays BY DON JEFFREY NEW YORK— ASCAP songwTiters and publishers are now recei\\ing roy- alties based on actual performances of their songs on the 100 top-grossing tours in the U.S. Last year, when the licensing agency began this new method of dia- tributing payments to members for live performances, the 50 top-gross- ing tours were targeted. The results are based on the previ- ous year's rankings of tours, as tabu- lated by PollStar magazine. In addition to those tours, ASCAP monitors all performances at 10 se- lected venues around the countr>'. in- cluding Radio City Music Hall in New York, and distributes pa>*ments for songs performed at those sites to the appropriate writers and publish- ers. John LoFrumento, executive VP/COO of ASCAP. says that the No. 1 grossing tour of 1994 generated about $:i00.000 in niyalties to ASCAP members this year. The No. 3 tour generated $200,000. He declined to disclose the total amount paid to songwriters and publishei*s. Under the system of distributing royalties for concert performances that existed before last year, venue operators and tour managers paid li- censing fees based on such factors as the facility's size. The money collect- ed was distributed to writers and publishers, according to the amount of radio and TV airplay that songs re- ceived. The operath'e axiom was that songs played the most on the radio are the ones performed the most in concert With the new system, payments are directly tabulated according to actual live performances. ASCAP re- quires tour managers or other con- cert personnel to submit playlists for all concerts. \"Our members were asking for more specific and precise sampling surveys, and this is a way of achieving this,\" says LoFrumento. He says that 85% of the funds col- lected, after operating expenses have been deducted, has gone to the wTit- ers and publishers of the performed songs, and 15% has gone into a gener- (Continued on page 106) MCA Records Launches Way Cool Music Mike Jacobs Signed On For Alternative Expertise BY CRAIG ROSEN LOS ANGELES— MCA Records con- tinues its expansion into the modem rock arena with the launch of Way Cool Music Inc., a new joint-venture label with independent promotion powerhouse Mike Jacobs I Jacobs will serve ! r\\f\\^\\f as a con.sultant to I V I lilfl] ^^^\"^^'\"s VyVlwF^y company and such ' affiliated labels as Radioactive, Kras- now Entertain- ment, (510) Records, Gasoline Alley, and Fort Apache on all facets of busi- ness relating to modem rock. Says MCA Records president Richard Palmese, \"I'm vcr>' excited to have Mike on board . . . This is another important step in our developing alter- native roster.\" Jacobs' involvement in modem rock dates back nearly 20 years. He once worked with the late Rick Carroll, onetime PD of modern rock KROQ Los Angeles, in a consulting business. Since 1979, Jacobs has worked as an independent promotion man whose star has risen with the mainstream ac- ceptance of the format. Among the re- cent success stories with which he has been involved are Offspring, Green Day, Bush, and Rancid. \"Doing those records, particu- larly for [Epitaph owner] Brett ^ Gurewitz, who JjT^^^ ' didn't have a pro- , motion depart- ment, was great,\" says Jacobs. \"The next step for me palwese was to sec if I could find the bands and break them.\" The seeds for Jacobs' deal were planted in March at a Texas music con- ference when the promotion man ran into longtime friend Randy Miller, MCA Records executive VP/GM of marketing, says Jacobs. Initially, Jacobs was not interested in a label deal. When Palmese and MCA Music Entertainment Group chairman/CEO Al Teller attempted to set up a meeting with him, his initial response was that \"these guys were out of their minds \" he sa>'s. \"But I had a meeting with them and realized that they were not so out of their minds.\" Jacobs was also swayed by (510) Records heads Jeff Saltzman and Elliot Cahn and Radioactive chief Gary Kurfirst. \"It's a logical progres.sion for me.\" says Jacobs, \"because for a lot of the labels we were working for, we wei*e being asked to pick the singles, to do the edits, create marketing plans, go on the road and tour with the band, and execute the mai'keting plans. To actually become the label was the next logical step for me.\" Palmese was impressed by Jacobs' track recoi-d and contacts. \"He's really well-connected in the altemative mar- ket and has valued relationships with radio programmers and with artists, producers, and managers,\" he says. \"And most importantly, he has rela- tionshiiw with a lot of inde|)endent la- bel heads throughout the countrj* . . . He is in the position to open doors and link us with the entrepreneurs that are delivering great music.\" Jacobs was pleased by MCA's will- ingne.ss to put \"the right people in place.\" Way Cool Music, which is based in (CotUimted on page 103) Chrysalis And Cooltempo Downsized, Folded Into EMI ■ BY JEFF CLARK-MEADS and ADAM WHITE LONDON— Chrysalis Records U.K. has come to the end of its quar- ter-century history as a self-con- tained, stand-alone record compa- ny. On Sept. 18, EMI Music folded the lal>el — together with sister im- print Cooltempo Records — into the EMI Recortls Group U.K. and Ire- land, reporting to the latter's presi- dent/CEO, Jean-Francois Cecillon. It was the most dramatic of sev- eral changes made by EMI in the U.K.. which all involved divisional downsizing and job losses. The com- pany's video production wing, Pic- ture Music International, has been folded into EMI International; and the budget-album division, Music For Pleasure, has been reorga- nized, with its sales force integrated into EMI's sales team. It was the Chrysalis upheaval that occupied most industry talk, however, because of the company's long history — alongside Virgin Records, it epitomized the wave of creative, independent U.K. record companies that developed in the late 'dOs and early '70s — and be- cause of the immediate exit of man- aging director Roy Eldridge, a 24- year company veteran. Directors Ken Grunbaum (who headed Cooltempo) and Mike Andrews have also departed; the label's self- contained headquarters in Lon- don's Holland Park will be vacated. An EMI spokesman says details of the \"restructured busineiw\" will be announced shortly, but it is thought that, in the future. Chrysalis and Cooltempo will each have four staffers — for A&R, press, marketing, and support senices — and will share a promotion unit. These will all be based at EMI Records' new U.K. headquarters in west London. EMI Music Europe president Rupert Perry says, \"The new struc- ture will mean two autonomous op- erations, both of which will report to (Contijiued on jxiqe lOU) P'Gram Vid Taps Sondheim As Silverman's Successor NEW YORK— Pol><;ram Video will have a new head for the new year. Bill Sondheim has been promoted to president of the New York-based independent, effective Jan. 1. He suc- ceeds Gene Silverman, who leaves the company at the end of the year to pursue other career interests. Sondheim, w'ho has been senior VP of sales and marketing since 1993, re- ports directly to Jim Caiwrro. pre.si dent/'C^EO of PoiyGram Group Dis- tributiftn, and functionally to Stewart Till, president of international of PoiyGram Filmed Entertainment. A five-year PoiyGram veteran, Sond- heim will be responsible for oversee- ing idl domestic activities. Since 1990, PoiyGram Video sales have grown 10-fold to an estimatetl $100 million-$l20 million. The bulk of the gain came during Silverman's tenure, which saw the company ex- jmul into ehiltli-en's, pro-focjtball, and fitness programming. Next year, PoiyGram launches the kid-vid series \"Wishbone,\" fol- lowing a PBS de- but. Its hit mo\\ies include \"Four Weddings And A Funeral and \"Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert \" Silverman's SONDHEIM home-video expe- rience began in the late 70s, w hen he created Detroit- based distributor Video Trend, which was later .sold to Major Video Con- cepts. Afterward, he became sales VP of Orion Home Video before joining PoiyGram in 1993. SETII GOLDSTEIN ^ 'Ua<» Vt|jU ^odJU Orange Crate's Art. Shown above is a first look at the artwork from the highly anticipated Brian WilsonA'an Dyke Parks album, \"Orange Crate Art.\" The artwork is a reproduction of Alfred R. Mitchelfs \"Nipomo Hills.\" Despite an eadier announcement that the project would be delayed until 1996, Warner Bros, will release the album Nov. 7. The record was delayed due to licensing complications with the album artwork, which is from the La Mesa. Calif., collection of Mrs. Albert Campbell, a noted collector of California landscapes. In addition, there had been concern that the album would compete with another recent Wilson album, \"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\" on Karambolage/MCA (Billboard, Sept. 23). However, both matters have been resolved. \"There could be an analogy made between this record and ttie mythical 'Smile' album,\" says Bob Merlis, senior VP at Warner Bros, Records Inc., of the delay. \"Of course, the 'Smile' album never came out. However, unlike 'Smile,' we are confident that this album will in fact make its new release date.\" MTV Europe Ad, Programs Fined For Sexy Content ■ BY JEFF CLARK-MEADS LONDON— MTV Europe has been fined $92,400 by British broadcasting aulhurities for three breaches of guidelines on sex and violence.

MTV was fined by the ITC for two programs and one advertisement. A $46,200 penalty was imposed for an edition of 'The Worst Of Most Want- ed\" that was broadcast at 9 a.m. on Saturday, May 6.

When several m^or labels passed on releasing \"Mortal Kombat: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,\" the New York-based in- die label was armed and ready to pick up the project and complete it in a mere three weeks. TVT staffers worked around the clock with music supervisor Sharon Boyle to finish compiling the techno and industrial music for the sound- track, press the CD, and have it in stores Aug. 15, in time for the movie's Aug. 18 opening. The New Line film, which is heavy on violence and special effects, is based on the popular martial arts video game. Given the fact that other soundtracks from movies based on video games, such as \"Street Fighter\" (Priority) and \"Super Mario Brothers** (Capitol), were disappointments, the success of the \"Mortal Kombat\" soundtrack has cant role in spreading the word.\" At the time, Colvin, who has re- turned to her former home base in Austin, Texas, was reluctant to re- lease an independent project, prefer- ring to wait until she was signed by a major. But, needing the money, she \"knuckled under,\" taping two shows on March 6, 1988, at the Ironhorse in Northampton, Mass. \"I was opening for Loudon Wain- wright and was really nervous, so I taped another show at the Somerville Theater, at a gig with me and Tracy Chapman and Patty Larkin, and I was in better form,\" she says. \"Live '88'* mainly derives fi^m the Somerville show, with two cuts, \"Cry Like An Angel\" and \"Knowing What I Know Now,\" coming from the Iron- horse taping. The latter Colvin origi- nal is a bonus track on the reissue, as (Continued on page 106) been a surprise. The movie itself has been a major surprise. It has spent three weeks at No. 1 at the box office and has grossed more than $63 million to date. This week, the soundtrack, which has sold more than 197,000 units, ac- cording to SoundScan, is No. 12 on The Billboard 200. It debuted on the chart Sept. 9 at No. 40 before jumping to No. 15 and then, on Sept. 23, to No. 10. \"No one expected it to break the way it did.\" says Steve Gottlieb, president of TVT. \"I don't think New Line count- ed on it, and we didn't count on it being top 10 so fast We're very proud of the music. This could be double-platinum, and the fact that we already [shipped] 750,000 without a single is amazing.\" TVT did not service any singles fi^m the soundtrack until the week of Sept 18, when the video edit version of the Giorgio Moroder Metropolis mix of (Continued on page 98) Wilson Files Suit Against Attorney; Cries Negligence ■ BY CHRIS MORRIS LOS ANGELES— Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys has filed a lawsuit against his former conservator, at^ tomey Jerome Billet, and his law firm.

Through the efforts of Eos Music and BMG/Catalyst, renewed interest in Bowles' long-ne- glected music seems to be develop- ing with the success of a recent mu- sical festival, the publication of a book, and the recording of an album. Not-for-profit production compa- ny Eos Music presented a three-day Music Of Paul Bowles Festival, which included two concerts at New York's Alice TuUy Hall on Sept. 19 and 21. On Sept. 20, a five-hour sym- posium featured lectures and panel discussions of Bowles' art and cul- tural touchstones, as well as a screening of the documentary \"Paul Bowles: The Complete Outsider.\" The events brought the 84-year- old Bowles — who has lived in Tang- ier, Morocco, for more than four decades — to New York for the time since 1968. According to Jonathan Shef- BOWLES fer, artistic direc- tor of Eos Music and conductor of the Eos Ensemble, Bowles' music is \"something that needs to be heard. It's a missing piece in a big puzzle — that group of composers in the '3Ds who used jazz and Broadway to forge a new Amer- ican sound.\" (Cont inited on patfe IPS) Seventh FarmAid Benefit In Kentucky Oct. 1 Ticket Sales High For 10th Anniversary Of Event BY CHET FLIPPO FarmAid will observe its 10th an- niversary with its seventh benefit concert, because the organization's founders say the need for aid to family farms still exists. FarmAid co-founders John Mel- lencamp, Willie Nelson, and Neil Young will host the Oct. 1 event at Louisville, Ky.'s Cardinal Stadium. They will be joined by, among others, Hootie & the Blowfish, the Dave Matthews Band, BlackHawk, Kris Kristofferson, John Conlee, and the Supersuckers. According to Mellencamp, Farm- Aid's roster has been pared down from the mega-lineups of past events. \"As far as the concert goes, the smaller bill makes a lot more sense,\" he says. \"Obviously, all the expenses are way down. By last count, 1 heard we're at something like 42,000 tickets sold. At the last one, we didn't do that many, and there were maybe 30 acts on that bill.\" The previous FarmAid benefit concert was held in September 1994 in New Orleans. FarmAid executive director Car- olyn Mugar says there are two clear reasons to do another benefit. \"First, we have no money left. Second, people are doing good work, and they need money to be able to con- tinue.\" Mellencamp says the focus of FarmAid has shifted since the first heady con- cert on Sept. 22, 1985, in Cham- paign, III. \"The goals of what peo- ple thought FarmAid would achieve 10 years ago are quite dif- ferent than what the function is now,\" he says. \"Pretty much now, everybody has lowered their expec- tations of what FarmAid can do. Basically, FarmAid gives money to crisis situations. That's where most of the money goes.\" RebbeSoul: Choice Hits For Chosen People Global Pacific Times Marketing Push ForHolg Dags ■ BYTRUDI MILLER ROSENBLUM NEW YORK— \"It's cool. It's Jewish.\" That's the message Global Pacific is sending with its ads for \"Fringe Of Blue,\" the label debut of RebbeSoul, aka Bruce Burger. The album offers soulful jazz/new age interpretations of traditional Jew- ish prayers. Highlights include \"Avinu,\" the key prayer of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, present- ed in both a plaintive acoiLstic version and a stirring electric rendition; and \"Hatikvah,\" the Israeli national an- them, which rises to a majestic \"rock opera\" crescendo with sizzling lead guitar licks. (One review compared it to Jimi Hendrix's rendition of \"The Slar-Spangled Banner.\") There are also many international touches: the West African rhythms of \"My Soul Thirsts For You,\" the Yemenite flavor of \"Call To Free- dom,\" and the Russian balalaika on \"Turn Balalaika.\" Sonoma, Calif - based Pa- ^^^^^^^1 cific became aware lm of RebbeSoul in H 1993, when label 2 V president Howard 1 I^B Sapper heard, and . . was impressed by, mkr B a self-titled, self- BURGER produced CD that included a version of \"Avinu.\" \"Then, about a year later, I got a call from his manager. Billy Bass, who told me Bruce had gone back and done a whole new RebbeSoul album,\" says Sapper. \"He sent us the CD, and it just knocked our socks off. We kept playing it in the office, and ever>'one — not just Jewish people, but a lot of oth- er people at the company — kept com- ing in my office and .saying. This is so beautiful! What is this?' It really touched everybody.\" Global Pacific signed multi-instru- mentalist Burger, who rerecorded some of the tracks and added others to create \"Fringe Of Blue.\" \"We had one of our first presentations at the Navarre national sales meeting the first week of August.\" says Sapper. \"Avinu\" got \"a huge ovation, and we were deluged with people asking for the CD,\" says Sapper. \"I knew then that this would be able to cross over to the jazz, new age, and (Coiititiited (Di ixii/e 106} Honorable Mention. Lava/Atlantii; recording artist Edwin McCain is shown wearing his No. 1 Heatseekers T-shirt to commemorate his debut album, \"Honor Among Thieves,\" which reached the top of the Heatseekers chart Sept. 2. The singer/songwriter just finished touring with Hootie & the Blowfish and will continue on the road throughout the fall. Initially, he says, the emphasis was on lobbying. \"I went to Wash- ington, D.C., in the beginning and spoke with the House and the Sen- ate, but people are pretty much done with that aspect now. I went to Washington with Willie, and the guy we needed most to see just asked, 'You guys bring your gui- tars?' When we said no, he just got up and left. And this country is rad- ically different now from what it was 10 years ago. We have, as a na- tion, decided that everything is worthless unless it has a high-dol- lar sticker next to it. But now I kind of view FarmAid like the PTA. The PTA is not gonna reconstruct American education, but there's a place and a function for it.\" Mugar says that even though FarmAid is just \"stemming the tide\" in the war against factory farms taking over family farms, it is accomplishing some good. She points to the more than $12 million that FarmAid has given in grants over the past 10 years. The money has gone to food and emergency re- lief, hot lines, outreach, education and scholarships, legal fees, pro- gram support, land stewardship, technical assistance, and self-help. She notes that FarmAid has a small staff and that 83 cents of every dol- lar raised goes out in some form of aid. And, she adds, there is one im- portant intangible. \"This communi- cates hope to the farmers when they come here,\" she says. \"They see these artists donating their time and their expenses, and they feel hope.\" This year's concert will be broad- cast on TNN the following day. The night before the concert, FarmAid will present an Ameri- cana night in Louisville's Palace Theatre. The benefit Americana Night Before FarmAid Concert will feature Steve Earle, Bill Miller, Parlor James, Jonell Moss- er. Sue Medley, Marc Germino, and Louisville artists Starbilly and Bodeco.

Co-produced by Cochrane and ex- Red Rider keylmardist John Webster, \"Ragged Ass Road\" came out in Can- ada Sept. 19. Following release in Europe, Australia, and Japan, Capitol will release the record to the U.S. Nov. 7. \"It's a very personal, very powerful record,\" says Tim Trombley, VP of tal- ent acquisition and artist develop- ment, EMI Music Canada. It's also one that is obviously strik- ing a chord with its listeners. The first Canadian single, \"I Wish You Well.\" released Aug. 24, debuted at No. 1 on the Record's contemporary album ra- dio chart, making it the first time a record by a Canadian artist has done so. Only Bruce Springsteen's \"Murder Incorporated\" and the Rolling Stones' \"Love Is Strong\" have equaled the feat \"Every station we expected to come in across the country came in at heavy rotation out of the box,\" says Peter Diemer, VP of national promotion EMI Music Canada. The single will be released in the U.S. Oct. 9 and will hopefully build on the American success experienced by Cochrane with his 1992 top 10 hit, \"Life Is A Highway.\" 0But Capitol isn't taking any chances. \"In Amer- ica, the name Tom Cochrane doesn't translate unless you mention 'Life Is A Highway,' \" says Denise Skin- COCHRANE ner, Capitol Rec- ords' VP of mar- keting. \"We established a wonderftil hit, but I'm not sure if we established Tom as an artLsL It's our job now to tie 'Life Is A High»-ay' into 'Ragged Ass Road.' 'I Wish You Well' can do that, and then we can [release] heavier songs, like 'Scream' or \"Crawl.' \" The label will target album rock ra- dio. 'This is a pretty straight-ahead rock'n'roll reeoni, so AOR is going to be a staple for us out of the box,\" Skin- ner says. \"We want to get [a lot of) air- play at AOR prior to the album going out and then e\\'entually cross it over to top 40. Depending on how the rec- ord develops at AOR, it could be a quick cross to top 40.\" In Canada. \"Ragged Ass Road\" is one of the most eagerly anticipated do- mestic albums of the past decade. Since recording the album \"Hang On To Your Resistance\" on Daffodil Rec- ords in 1977 under the group name Cochrane and fronting Red Rider for seven albums fi*om 1980 to 1989, Coch- rane has been recognized as one of the country's most talented songwriters and performers. \"Mad Mad World\" has sold one mil- lion units in Canada to date, according to Diemer. Two singles, \"Life Is A Highway\" and \"No Regrets,\" reached No. 1 on the Record's contemporary album radio and contemporary hit ra- dio charts, while \"Sinking Like A Sun- set\" reached No. 1 at contemporary al- bum radio and No. 3 at contemporary hit radio. A number of other tracks also reoen'ed widespread airplay at al- bum rock radio. (CotUinued on page Ui) Under The Stage And Dreaming.

An hourlong TV special, hosted by Drew Barrymore and featuring original Chynna Breaks Musical Ground On EMI Set Wilson Phillips Singer Steps Out As Solo Artist I BY LARRY FUCK NEW YORK— As she braces for the flurr>' of promotional activity surround- ing the Nov. 7 release of \"Naked And Sacred,\" sometime Wilson Phillips har- monizer Chynna Phillips is philosophi- cal about the fact that some will initiallj' be more interested in gossiping about her personal life than the two-plus years of effort that went into her EMI solo debut \"It is kind of weird to pour so much of your heart into a project and know- that the first questions you're probably going to hear are 'How is Billy [Bald- win, the actor to whom she recently wed]?' or Do you ever talk to Camie and Wendy [Wilson]?' \" Phillips says with a laugh. \"But I have faith that the music will win out in the end.\" EMI president Davitt Sigerson agrees, adding that the attention shoukl CHYNNA PHILLIPS ultimately work to the album's benefit \"Althou^ we have absohitely no inter- est in relying on Chynna's wedding or past pop history to sell this record, I will say that the energy and interest around her is extremely positive,\" he MICROPHONES ONE GREAT PERFORMER DESERVES ANOTHER. Tim McGraw The Sound of Profe$sionals...WorldwideJ says. \"Given that, I think we can be comfortable with the knowledge that we have a record that is strong enough to maintain and build upon that interest\" \"Naked And Sacred\" will be launched Oct. 10, when the label solicits top 40 and AC radio airplay for the title cut, a hook-laden number helmed by vet- eran pop producers Rick Nowels and Billy Steinberg. Rhythm-crossover for- mats will be served a dance-rooted re- mix of the song by club icon David Mo- rales at the same time. Sigerson sees the single as potentially filling a current void at radio. \"It's a fairly strai^tfoward pop song with a good tempo and energy,\" he says. There really isn't anything on ra- dio right now that sounds like it, though it feeb* timely and accessible. It's one of those songs that grabs you immedi- ately.\" \"Naked And Sacred\" is supported by a stylish videoclip directed by Matthew Rolston that will be seniced to all ma- jor music-video outlets simultaneously with the single's impact at radio. Although her schedule was still being confirmed at press time, Sigerson says Phillips will devote a considerable amount of time promoting the project at radio, with a heavy smattering of television appearances. \"In short, we are going to work her bones until they ache.\" he says with a laugh. \"I'm opti- mistic that well still be actively work- ing this album until well past this time next year.\" Phillips' visibility this season will be enhanced by an appearance in an ABC- (Continued on page 20) cartoon clips and band performances, will begin a three-month run on the Car- toon Network Nov. 1. Over that period, the special wiU air on weekdi^ and Sundays in prime time, on Fridays at late night, and, naturally, on Saturday mornings. In addition, Marvel Comics will pub- lish a 32-page special editk>n with the works of 10 comic book artists, dedi- cated to the album. \"Saturday Morning\" includes such tracks as Liz Phair and Material Issue's take on \"TTie Tra La La Song (Theme From The Banana Splits'),\" the Ra- mones' version of \"Spiderman,\" and Matthew Sweet's rendition of \"Scooby Doo, Where Are You?\" The album is the Iwainchild of execu- tive producer Ralph Sail, wiio produced each track and wrote the TV spe- cial. However, it's not the first time that an alternative rock act has taken on a cartoon theme. In the late TOs, Los sweet Angeles-based car- toOTi punks the Dickies recorded a ver- sion of \"Gigantor.\" Sail s^ he wasn't aware of the Dickies' foray into 'toon tunes until after he began his project (The Dickies also recorded a verskm of The Tra La La Song.\") \"EvcaTone I knew watched cartoons when they were kids,\" says Sail, who came up with the conc^t for the album a few years ago. \"At the time, there was a lot of movie actkKi going on with up- dated versions of a property or fhm- chise, but they were never geared to- ward the altenuitive-minded.\" Sail, whose previous efforts include the Gratefiil D^ tribute album Tteadi- cated,\" pitched the alternative-leaning cartoon theme album to MCA Records president Richard Pabnese and execu- THE RAMONES TO OUR READERS The Beat does not appear this week.

Although the album packs a built-in novelty factor, Sail says it's not a jdte. The idea of making a record wth songs from TV is that they are the ultimate cultural unifier,\" he says. \"As soon as you hear these songs, it all ccmes rush* ing back. If you put any of these scHigs on in a crowded room, it stops the room.\" Joel Oberstein, GM of the Southern California stores in the 35-store, Simi Valley, Calif. -based Tempo Music & Video, also feels the album will be a hit with a certain crowd. \"Kids will react to it positive^,\" he says, \"^ost of the artists are 70s kids that are acknou'ledging their childhood by recording those songs. As a chiU of the 70b myself, I find it interesting. It'a a goofy, fiin thing.\" To those who grew up in the late *GOb and early 70s, the cartoon themes are as meaningful as legitimate hit records, Sail adds. \"At the time, \\^'e had the Bea- tles, a true, original rock'n'roll source, but we also had the prefab version, the Partridge Family, then the animated verskm, the Archies.

The album, which features the duo's name in the title so as not to confuse fans of the musical, will be issued Oct 31. Like their 1994 US. domestic debut, \"Made In USA,\" it compiles material culled from numerous Japanese re- leases, as well as including current fare like first single \"Happy Sad.\" That track is also the soundtrack single from \"Unzipped\" the acclaimed documentary about fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi. \"It's a quirky fealuon movie about a perfectionist who's very creative and detail -oriented, in many ways like [Yasuharu] Konishi,\" says Tern Mac- Millan of Medius Entertainment, which manages Pizzicato Five, or PS for short, outside Japan. Record collector and film buff Konishi is the founder/omcepUial- ist and chief composer of the decade-oM P5; vocalist Maki Nomiya, formerly of Japanese pop band Portable Rock, joined in 1990. P5's music has been compared with Deee-Lite and St. Eti«ine and reflects Konishi's eclectic and far-reaching pop tastes. In his liner notes to \"Sound Of Music,\" he invokes such sources, influ- ences, and evocations as Sei^ Mendes, Van McCoy, the Five Americans. Burt Bachaiach, Japanese techno-pop group the Plastics, Steve Miller, Donovan, and the \"Bye Bye Birdie\" soundtrack. \"We dont like to limit ourselves with one type of music,\" says KomshL Mac- Millaii adds that musically, \"PS fits in everywhere and nowhere. In America PIZZICATO FIVE: Maki Nomiya and Yasuharu Konishi. you'd put them down as alternative pop, though I call 'Happy Sad' 'alternative Motown.' \" In PS's highly visual live perform- ances, the music is accented by fashion plate Nomura's onstage get-up. Hence, the Halloween street date. \"They're about costumes and dress- ing up, full theatricality and -spectacle,\" sa>^ Matador's national sales director Patrick Amory. \"They're all about style.\" Haltewe&i balls and parties are set to herald the release of \"The Sound Of Music\" in New Yoric, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle, Detroit, and Miami, says Amory. Party favors will involve trick-or-treat bags contain- ing \"Hi^jpy Sad\" cassette singles and P5 skateboard stickers. The bags will also be given auiiy at retail during the day. Also at retail, says Atlantic VP of product development Michael Krumper, will be se\\'eral different posters high- lighting the act's visual orientation. Amor>' further expects extensive mer- chandise to include drink coasters and limited-edition \"50s-style flight bags. Creati\\itj' is also evident in the album and single packaging, in keeping with PS's Japanese practice, says Krumper. TTie CD-5 is wrapped in a mylar bag and features artwork from \"Unzip^3ed.\" The elegant album Digipak is in black, white, and silver, and contains an indi- vidually numbered \"Carte Pizzicato\" credit card. A phone number printed on the card encourages holders to call for fan club and contest information, the latter im-ohing a drawing by Nomij'a at the end of the year to award a free trip to see P5 perform anywhere in the world. The card numbers will also be used in announcing radio contest winners of PS merchandise. Amory adds that an American Express parody campaign will feature \"Pizzicato Five Accepted Here\" signage and print ads. \"Credit cards and shopping are part of the glamour image they want to put across,\" he says. Radio promotion will include the \"loyal\" college and alternative stations that have previously supfx>rted PS, says MacMillan, \"e\\'en if 'Happy Sad' isn't a college-sounding song.\" Noting that \"Made In USAV \"Twiggy Twiggy\" made \"significant inroads\" at cwnmer- cial alternative stations, Krumper says Atlantic is targeting those stations and looking toward pop formats. The single was to go \"straight to top 40\" Sept 19, according to Amory. Matador/Atlantic is also targeting the dance market with a 12-inch of the sin- Mute America Provides Voice For Young Bands Thirty Ought Six Set Exemplifies Label's Agenda I BY STEVEN MIRKIN NEW YORK— Mute Records has usu- ally be0i associated with the somberly \"arty\" side of rock: Nick Cave, Dia- manda Galas, EinstUr^ende Neubau- ten. But with the Nov. 7 release of Thirty Ought Sbc's \"Hag Seed,\" Mute America hopes to change all that and cobble out a particularly American klentity for itself. The Portland, Ore., trio is miles away from the usual Mute fare, with loud, en- ergetic, dynamic songs fiT)nted by Sean Roberts' melodic basslines and highly emotive vocals. Instead of opium rever- ies of fin de siMle Berlin, Thirty Ought Six (the name of a high-powered rifle) recalls Fugazi and fellow Northwest bands, including Pearl Jam. This doesn't faze Adrian Janssens, Mute America's manager of A&R, the first A&R executive hired by the U5. label. \"The ag^da is different here in America, and this is the first time we decided to develop young bands fi*om North America for the worM.\" He feels that the fact that the label has been in business four years, with a full staff working Mute's U JC releases here, works to its advantage. And, he adds, the label has a reputatun as being artist-fiiendly. THIRTY OUGHT SIX: Sean Roberts, Ryan Paravecchio, and David Blunk. TTiat reputation was partly what at- tracted Thirty Ought Sue to Mute America. Roberts says Mute's history of lor^-term support for artists \"who have no interest in courting commercial success\" was an important factor in the band's signing. The first priority for Mute is to make sure that the industry doesn't pigeon- hole the band. Mark Fotiadis, Mute America's VP/GM, feels the label has already started to do that with its series of 7-inch single releases. Thirty Ought Six's single, 'Talon\" backed with \"Mor- eau,\" was well received by college radio and was added to about SO playlists, a \"phenomenal\" number for a \\inyl re- lease, he says. With that positive response to the single in hand, Fotiadis is hopeful that the album will do well on coll^ charts and then gain a foothold in the commer- cial alternative format. An emphasis track for commercial alternative radio has yet to be chosen, but Fotiadis says Mute will give that song a \"proper com- mercial alternative campaign,\" includ- ing pressing a CD single; also, funds have been budgeted to (Mwluce a video. In addition, Fotiadis foresees hiring an independent promoter to help work the album. One way the domestk signings will manifest themselves will be through touring. As opposed to British bands, who come to Uie U.S., tour for three weeks, and go heme, the label will be able to schedule tours of longer than three months. 'The band will tour as much as they want to,\" Fotiadis says, and Roberts says the band is ready to hit the road. It will play a series of dates in mid-October on the West Coast, and Roberts hopes to play a few shows in the East before the holidays. Extended touring, he says, will probably .start early next year. Live performances have already been scheduled at e\\'ents heavily att<?ided b>' the industry to pro- mote Thirtj' Ou^t Six and the label's other signing, AtJanta's To^ut, as well as to boost Mute America's new {x«file. (Continued on next, page) g^e remixed by Kenny \"Dope\" Gonzalez of Masters at Work. As for tour plans, Krumper says PS will undertake a two- week U.S. tour in February'. 'Wheji I first saw them, it struck me that they're what Andy Warhol would create if he were putting together a band for the \"908,\" says Krumper. 'Their use of \\ide- otape images during the show is really innovative, and they sample from every area of pop culture, reflecting their per- vasK'e knowiedge of pop music.\" Pizzicato Five is also releasing its latest Japanese Columbia/Triad al- bum, \"Romantique '96,\" on Oct. 1. \"Their focus is still Japan,\" says MacMillan. \"so it was a big concession for them to be in America, when they should have been promoting in Japan. But they want to support \"The Sound Of Music By Pizzicato Five.' They're a big cult act in Japan with main- stream sales, but going to America was always a dream they never took seriously.\" FEEL THE WARMTH.

It was so much ftm.\" From a creative perspective, \"Naked And Sacred\" gave Phillips a much- needed opportumty to explore musical ground inappropriate to Wilson Phil- lips. \"There are different things that I have been wanting to try with my voice that would never have worked inside the confines of a harmony group,\" she says, indkating the raspy edge site dis- plays on cuts like the neo-psychedelic pop ditty \"When 2000 Comes\" and the sprawling power ballad \"Just To Hear You Say That You Love Me.\" 'TVhat Wilson Phillips does, it does well and it works well for me. But I really needed to grow and open myself up to new ideas.\" Part of that growth included working with a variety of songwriters and pro- ducers that included Desmond Child, Eliot Wolf, and Family Stand group members Peter Lord and Jeffrey Smith — all of whom Phillips says chal- lenged her approach to composing and performing. \"I think the result is songs with a lot of variety and textural differ- ences. But at the same time, the album feels cohesive and whole — kind of like different parts of a single personality.\" Although she is ei\\joying the fi'eedom of life as a solo artist, Phillips is not rul- ing out a Wilson Phillips reunion. \"We are definitely talking about eventually going back into the studk> again, maybe sometime next year\" she says. There is a certain kind of magic when we per- form together that we could never per- manently put behind us.

When it comes to its own profile, Mute America will take the same meas- ured, long-term approach. \"Over the past six months,\" Fotiadis says, \"we've been doing our mailings, targeting col- lege radio, the mom-and-pops, fan- zines,\" and, in addition to bringing new music, exposing the label's \"new atti- tude to those places.\" Janssens has de- vised a three-year plan to promote the new Mute. \"It's going to take a year to stop people sa>ing, 'Oh, Thirty Ought Six, tiiey're on Mute; it's some kind of electronic stuff,' and get the industry pumped up. It will take a year to con- vince the consumer, and by the third year, we should have a roster of nine or 10 acts that will be just as competitive as the best independent labeL\" Mute's founder, Daniel MiDer, is \"ab- solutely\" behind the program, and Janssens adds that, in time, he hopes people uill see Mute's signings in the same league as Matador or Sub Pop. amusement business BOXSCORE iM TOP 10 cflMCHn Gmna ARTISTISl V«nue QMii) Graii JMiMlaMt Promoter tamtm naiu.»i«nm nnruraiiiiai OKMIT OUMBtH on Alamodome Sept i San AMonn.

Roach- FORD RK- TITRNS: With Roachford's first U.S. release in four years, \"Per- manent Shade Of Blue.\" the band lakes a simpler ap- proach to its mu- sic and a less anxious view of breaking big stateside. The band, led by South Lon- doner Andrew Roachford. mixes funk and soul with rock and pop on its Kpic debut, released Sept. 19. Roachford says he's not ex- pecting to take the U.S. by storm. However, he does hoi)e that the crossover success of Seal and Dcs'ree may help pave the way for a successful return to American audiences. However, Chris Piippc, mar- keting director at Epic, cites Hootie & the Blowfish as the band in whose footsteps Roachford may be following. \"Things have changetl from when I first went to America,\" says Roachford. \"Seal and Des'ree have shown that black artists are more than R&B. People are more open- minded to accepting different music from black artists.\" Poppe says that the label is taking n long-term approach to marketing the album, which took more than a year to reach double-platinum in Australia. The album has Hidden Treasure. Modern rockers such as KROQ Los Angeles are giving 1 .000 Mona Lisas' punk verskin of Alanis Morissette\"s \"You Oughta Know\" a spin. The song is the hidden bonus track on the LA. band's self- tilled RCA EP. due Tuesday (26).

Indie promoter Jeff McClusky is working the al- bum to triple-A radio and the first single, \"Only To Be With You.\" to top 40 radio. BILLBOARD SEPTEMBER 30, 1995 21 R&B ARTISTS The Smooth Sounds Of Silk Are Back Elektra Act Waxes Romantic On 2nd Set I BY J.R. REYNOLDS LOS ANGELES— Platinum-certified Elektra recording act Sillt has pulled back on its sexually aggressive lyrics in favor of a more romance-tinged style for its sophomore set, \"Silk.\" The move is designed to show consumers that the quintet is in the music business for the SILK long haul. Silk comprises Gary \"Big G\" Glenn, Gary \"LittJe G\" Jenkins, Jonathan Ras- boro, Jimmy Gates, and Timothy Ca- meron. 'Hie Atlanta-based group burst onto the music scene in 1992 with its Keith Sweat-produced album \"Lose Control,\" which went to No. 1 on the Top R&B Albums chart and sold L7 million units, according to SoundScan. The album produced three top 10 hit£, including the sexually sizzling \"Freak Me,\" which held the No. 1 spot on the Hot H&B Singles chart for eight weeks in 1993. Howe\\'er, for \"Silk,\" the group says it was time to take a less overt ap- proach. Says Glenn, \"We want to have a long, diverse career and didnt want to be pigeon-holed into the 'Freak Me' thing.\" As a result, the group parted ways with producer/artist Keith Sweat, who discovered the act and originally .signed Silk to his Keia label. 'X>eatively, he taught us a lot about music, but we wanted to move in direc- tions that were different from what his \\ision of our music was,\" says Glenn. Another measure the five vocalists took to steer their image toward a more traditionally styled R&B act was the use of a diverse group of producers. \"This album Is critical to our career, and we wanted to assume more respon- sibility for its success,\" says Glenn. Producers on \"Silk\" include Dave Hall, Gerald Levert, Soul Shock & Kar- lin, HOP, Wookie Stewart, Darin Whit- tington, and Silk. The group's members wrote three tracks on the album and are interested in writing more in the future, but they wanted to use the best songs possible on the album.

The veteran gospel vocalist has a greatest- hits collection on Billboard's charts and has made a series of national television appearances. Now, MCA is preparing to release \"Your Heart's In Good Hands,\" Green's lirst domestic R&B al- bum in 18 years. \"Your Heart's In Good Hands\" de- buts Nov. 7 and includes eight cuts from \"Don't Look Back,\" a collection originally issue<l outside the U.S. by BMG International in August 1993. Denny Diante, VP A&R/producer at MCA, says MCA Music Entertainment Group CEO Al Teller became aw-are of the BMG album last year when Green was recording \"Funny How Time Slips Away\" with Lyle Lovett for MCA's \"Rhythm, Country & Blues\" album. \"We worked out a deal to re"
