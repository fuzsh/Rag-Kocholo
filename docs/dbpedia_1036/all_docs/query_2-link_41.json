        "text": "SOUNDTRACK: LEE RANALDO AND THE DUST-Live at KEXP (December 8, 2013).\n\nThis show was recorded before the holidays in 2013. For some reason, it wasn’t posted online until Jan 31. But whatever the reason, I’m glad it was featured.\n\nDuring the dissolution (or whatever) of Sonic Youth, much has been made of both Thurston and Kim’s new projects. But Lee Ranaldo tends to get lost in the shuffle (which is probably how he likes it). During the break, Lee has been plugging away on two solo albums. His latest one, with The Dust, is more of a band effort, with contributions from everyone: Steve Shelley (talk about getting lost in the shuffle, poor Steve) on drums, Tim Lüntzel on bass and Alan Licht on guitar. Licht plays some wonderful guitar solos and sounds (although Lee handles most of the weird sounds). I think what’s interesting about these songs is that although they feel like Sonic Youth, they have a “pretty” guitar solo which really changes the overall feel of the song.\n\nRanaldo has written (and sung) some of my favorite Sonic Youth tracks. I always assumed that his tracks sounded great when they were balanced with the rest of the album. But these songs sounds very Ranaldo and they are all fantastic.\n\nThe first song, “Keyhole” is part beautiful melody and part beautiful noise. Ranaldo writes chords that work perfectly together and yet which don’t sound like an obvious pairing. And his vocal phrasing is always perfect for the music he makes–his voice is not spectacular but it is really quite perfect. The second song, “Off the Wall” has the most commercial-sounding chorus I’ve heard from a Sonic Youth alum. I almost don’t like it, although the rest of the song is very cool.\n\nThey play a cover of The Velvet Underground’s “Rock n Roll” which fits in perfectly with their sound (even if Lee doesn’t hit the falsetto “fine fine” notes). The final song, “The Rising Tide” is perhaps my favorite. Clocking in at 10 minutes, this song is expansive and full of textures and sounds. It goes in a bunch of different directions and is really fantastic.\n\nThere’s a very long interview in the middle of the four songs, in which we learn what Lee has been up to, about how Hurricane Sandy affected him and about The Dust’s tour in India. Lee’s an engaging talker and the interview flies by.\n\nI don’t have any of Lee’s solo albums, but I think this one Last Night on Earth (and it seems like perhaps the previous one, Between the Times and the Tides) are total keepers. You can watch the whole show below.\n\n[READ: January 5, 2014] “Take It or Leave It”\n\nI was surprised and pleased to see a piece from Zadie Smith in here. Her article is mostly a comparison of take out food in New York and in London (or more broadly, the U.S. and England).\n\nShe tells how the first time she ordered Chinese food in New York, she wondered why the delivery guy just stood there after getting paid. So she closed the door on him. Her companion was shocked. They just don’t tip delivery people in England. British people grumble about it when they come here and have to tip. They say that people should be compensated fairly for their work (although Smith notes that no one actually says if delivery boys are fairly paid in England) .\n\nShe says that a guy comes to your door, gives you food, gives you change and leaves (sometimes without even taking off the motorcycle helmet). And they never say to have a nice day. (“Have a good one” is the best you’ll get).\n\nI enjoyed this distinction: “In New York, a restaurant makes some ‘takeout’ food, which it fully intends to take out and deliver to someone. In England, the term is ‘takeaway,’ a subtle difference that places the onus on the eater.” And that those few who do offer delivery expect a minimum order (which I guess doesn’t happen in New York, but sure does in New Jersey–my family has always picked up, we never have it delivered).\n\nShe ends the essay with a funny story about London delivery guys and how they are never prompt. She says that even if you call back and ask where your food is, they always say “just fifteen minutes” or “he’s turning onto your street” or something. One time she walked to the location while talking to the restaurant on the phone. They said he was turning onto her road as she walked in to find the delivery guy sitting on a bench, texting.\n\nOf course, he wasn’t going to get a tip, right?"
