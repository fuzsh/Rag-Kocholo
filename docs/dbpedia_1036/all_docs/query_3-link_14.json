The story said it’s good being an incum- bent. I’m not so sure. Incumbents have estab- lished track records, and Margaret Gomez’s track record leads to a loss of confidence. I worked for Commissioner Gomez for more than a decade and have lived in East Austin for 22 years. I observed how she lost touch with her constituents firsthand. We need better advocacy, someone who will show up for work and speak to the needs of Precinct 4. The name Joe Vela (my name) appears on the supporters lists of both candidates for Precinct 4 Travis County Commissioner. To clarify any confusion, I support Raul Alvarez for this office. Raul is much more interested in doing the job than just having the job. He has a proven track record as a public servant, not just another politician. A concerned citizen of Travis County , Precinct 4, Joe Vela KELLER SHOULD BE CHARGED Dear Editor, Re: “Public Humiliation Is Punishment Enough” [Newsdesk, Jan. 20]: No. Public humiliation is not enough. Sharon Keller’s decision cost a human life. She should not be given immunity from pros- ecution. Keller should be criminally charged and her case decided by a jury. I sparked a federal investigation that ended with the conviction of my own attorney and judge. What was discovered is state oversight commissions do not police their judges, they protect them. Nancy Swan Mobile , Ala. FIND POSITIVE VISION Dear Editor, Louis Black has had some of his best editori- als lately. There are some things I would like to add to his most recent about “throwing the bums out” and why it doesn’t work [“Page Two,” Jan. 22]. More and more today, the political landscape is one dominated by anti-movements instead of movements. We have many people who are very clear about what they are against and very few people who know what they are for. I have actu- ally asked people: “What are you for?” They do not know how to answer the question. As Louis correctly pointed out, the Ross Perot movement died a quick death because it had no ideology, no philosophy, no ideas. It was a move- ment of people who simply wanted to vote for somebody else. These people were actually the most docile products of the system. Another result of this is that people search for villains instead of solutions. This gives rise to the many conspiracy theories, whether they be about the assassination of men like Kennedy and King or about the destruction of the Alfred P Murrah Federal Building and the World Trade Center. And, while most of the conspiracy theories I’ve heard over the years have some validity, there is also a lot of truth in Hanlon’s razor. It basically says, “Never attribute to malice that which can be easily explained by stupidity.” One of the reasons why the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s movement was successful was that King was not interested in punishing the many villains. He treated his opponents as misinformed, not evil. He was, above all, a man of peace. Perhaps during this period of ideological bankruptcy, Americans will find a positive vision to support. Until they do, it won’t matter who is in office. Chris Baker PROBLEMS WITH CAPITAL METRO Dear Editor, Re: “Can’t Get There From Here” [News, Jan. 22]: I have lived in Austin for the past 10 years, and I can say that Capital Metro really doesn’t offer the service it promotes or advertises. I used services from the Texas Commission for the Blind, and they had me enrolled in stupid training programs that try to help those with eye impairments get jobs. For all the talk the city of Austin has done, it has failed to serve the disabled community here in Austin. Getting an education and trying to find a job makes no sense if you can’t get to that job. Cap Metro bus stops haven’t been updated for decades and have the same routes. I have been offered many jobs with higher salaries over the years but had to take lower-paying jobs or no job at all because there was no ride to that job. Cap Metro has really failed in its mission to provide quality service. Try complaining to them and all you get is a shove to the side and a complaint that will get you nowhere in life. Cap Metro needs to be sued and shut down, and a real- istic transportation system should take its place, because it’s doing nobody a bit of good. Daniel Meiske VOTING OUTSIDE THE BOX Dear Editors, In last week’s Austin Chronicle, you listed the candidates from the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians for the November 2010 statewide election [“The Primary Candidates,” News, Jan. 22]. However, Texans should know that the slate of Green Party candidates can be found at www. txgreens.org. Interested voters will see that Austin’s own Roger Baker is running for Travis County Clerk with a focus on bringing changes to the office to institute fair, transparent, and verifiable elections for Travis County voters - no more black box voting! In order to sign the petition for “alternative” politi- cal parties like the Greens, Libertarians, Constitution Party, Socialists, and others, voters should not vote in the primary elections for the status quo party(s) that have placed many unconstitutional barriers against electoral competition. Instead, registered voters can still vote for their favorite candidate in the November election and sign a petition to allow alternative candidates the opportunity to be on the ballot so that all of us will have a wider choice of qualified individuals that could be voted into offices and represent citizens’ interests instead of only the present corporate duopoly that regularly purchases and/ or creates legislation so that they think they own the ballot box! Save your vote for a party that will work to make certain your vote is counted fairly, verifiably, transparently. Peace, Bill Stout Green Party of Texas Legislative liaison GONE OVER TO DARK SIDE Dear Editor, Re: “Page Two” [Jan. 15]: Mr. Black has gone over to the dark side - I believe he is now a neocon. In the past he championed issues like the safety and health of the workplace and the rights of its workers. How does that apply to every business but entertainment? What is the current policy of the Chronicle's offices regarding smoking, and when was it implemented and why? Whenever something is legislated, unfortunately, there are losers as well as winners; some rights are affirmed and the others denied; that is our system. Dig this: People with asthma or other respiratory illnesses for whom it would have been an impossibility to catch a live show almost anywhere other than the Cactus Cafe can enjoy going out as much as anyone else. Or I guess maybe they don’t matter either. Tim Pipe [Louis Black responds: I'm not sure where neocons would stand on a smoking ban , but start- ing out a letter with an insult is a good strategy. When the final law regarding the smoking ban was passed , there were only 200 businesses that still allowed smoking , out of the many thousands of Austin businesses.] CONTINUED ON P.6 ■Terra Toys old tirte push cimmn-4 Smell gift big sm^ 243S W.

My hope is that there are more representatives than Rep. Elliott Naishtat who find the issue of cannabis important enough to provide legal provisions for Texans with painful disabilities and diseases to grow and use cannabis medically without worry of criminal charges. The American Medical Association and the federal government have recently changed direction regarding their previous stances on this topic, and Texas policy should follow. The value of a drug to a patient should be between a doctor and patient, not between lawmakers. The current Texas drug policy, especially surrounding the uses of the can- nabis plant, is outdated, unwarranted, and overly penalizes Texans who choose to use cannabis for any purpose. The plant has clear, scientifically proven benefits to health and society. Clearly, abusing the plant is not its only use, yet Texas drug policy only focuses on the abuse of the plant in the formation of its laws regarding the plant. If all laws were made this way, we would not have access to many paints, solvents, or gasoline for that matter. Alcohol was once outlawed using this very outdated methodology. We must repeal pro- hibition laws because we currently cannot grow cannabis for food, oil, or fiber products. We can- not use it for clothing, cosmetics, medicinally, or even research its other beneficial properties and uses (like clean fuel). It’s time everyone come out and get educated about this useful plant. It’s not just about abuses anymore. David Wagner BEGGING BLACK TO RECONSIDER Dear Editor, I am writing to beg you to reconsider your influential opinion on the smoking ban [“Page Two,” Jan. 15]. I have been working, off and on, in nightclubs for 20 years, and the difference between a smoking club and nonsmoking club is literally night and day. To try and repeal this would be like taking away the 40-hour work week or removing safety standards from the mining industry. A true step backward. It’s very simple: When other people drink, I don’t get drunk, but when other people smoke cigarettes, I am smoking, too. I quit 15 years ago; it was very hard, but I stuck with it and I finally prevailed. Why should I still be at risk of getting lung cancer just because of the way I make my living? As far as the clubs not doing well, it’s a recession, that’s what happens. People aren’t going out ’cause they’re broke! Not because they have to go outside to smoke. To attach the two is complete nonsense. As I said, I beg you to reconsider. Thank you , Gary Lindsey [Louis Black responds: Relax , Gary. The edito- rial said nothing about a repeal , and I can safely assure you that calling my influence even “very limited\" would still be an exaggeration.] MYSTERIOUS RESIDENTS RETURN Dear Editor, The Residents can easily be described as a performance art band from San Francisco, but what is not easy to describe is what they have done with music, visual art, and the use of mod- ern technologies manipulated over the last 38 years. They are one of music’s most prolific and versatile bands in the industry without being tied into the industry. Since 1972, the band has released more than 65 albums, dozens of limited-edition CD projects, numerous music videos and short films, three CD-ROM projects, and 10 DVDs and have undertaken seven major world tours. Their albums are often complex conceptual pieces composed around a theme, theory, or plot and are noted for surrealistic lyrics and a disregard for standard Western pop-music composition. Soundtrack work for the Discovery Channel and an installation at the Museum of Modern Art are only a few of their credits. Their live shows are works of per- formance art with symbolic stage props, mys- terious costumes, and dramatic theatrics. To this day the band remains shrouded in mystery, best illustrated by their iconic eyeball-and-top- hat look. The reasons why the Residents have not been to Texas in more than 20 years are not clear. I personally have traveled more than 1,000 miles each time they have toured over the last 17 years, and I am excited to have the chance to see them here. Keeping true to form, this tour is also a bit mysterious, being called the Talking Light tour. I have no idea what is going to happen. There is no press release for it yet. This is the information from www. residents, com: “The story of the Talking Light piece is basically that of an older man who questions, not only decisions he made as a teenager, but also if the events he remembers from that time happened at all. ‘A dead infant clutching a ring with an inscription the teenager cannot read’ is the stuff of dreams. The following stories in the show may or may not shed light on the inscription. Questions remain unanswered. The Residents study death, not as a horrific end, but as the ultimate question that we all ask while wondering if any of it is even real.” I can’t wait. Feb. 2, Stubb’s. Deanna Szuter CREATE PUBLICLY FUNDED CAMPAIGNS Dear Editor, Today the Supreme Court removed restric- tions on the political spending of corporations and unions. If you agree that special interests tend to hijack public policy for narrow, selfish, and short-term gains, then this should alarm you. “The Fortune 100 companies alone had combined revenues of $13 trillion and profits of $605 billion during the last election cycle” [Forbes.com, Jan. 21]. Please consider taking a few minutes to call your representative and urge him or her to sup- port the Fair Elections Now Act to create publicly funded campaigns. Thanks , Paul Silver CONSERVATIVE JUDICIAL ACTIVISTS Dear Editor, Not long ago conservatives in Congress were grilling Supreme Court nominee Sotomayor on her impartiality, impugning her ability to avoid ideological bias in her rulings. Now a con- servative Supreme Court majority is blatantly pursuing an activist agenda at the expense of decades of legal precedence. The recent ruling on campaign financing by corporations amounts to conservatives’ very own pornography, which is also protected on the grounds of a First Amendment right to free speech. Just as pornog- raphy represents a hideous stain on our national character, so unfettered political influence by corporations will result in the complete prostitu- tion of a political system already dominated by special interests and powerful lobbies. Under this ruling, “freedom for all” becomes just a free-for-all in which only the biggest, baddest, and wealthiest have the chance to make their voices heard. Most sickening are conservative commentators who disingenuously try to claim that this ruling gives more power to the little guy. In their grotesque, egregious, yet innate hypoc- risy, conservatives insist that in the unregulated market, individuals have the right and the ability CONTINUED ON P.8 m m Come see our beautiful handmade oriental rugs and Kilim collections.

Revenge of the Cyborgs Speech may be free, but justice costs real money BY MICHAEL KING Reading through the Supreme Court opinions this week in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case - which struck down virtually all restrictions on corporate (and union) financing of election campaigns - I found myself reaching for outlandish metaphors to describe how other- worldly the entire exercise seemed. Justice Anthony Kennedy’s strenuous majority opinion is filled with defenses of bot- tomless campaign spending for multi- national corporations as expressions of absolute “free speech” - a notion the court had no patience for when the speaker was a high school kid carrying a rude poster - and denunciations of the supposed “bans” on corporate free speech represented by decades of relatively toothless cam- paign finance laws. “The law before us [a restriction on express corporate electioneering shortly before an election],” thunders Kennedy, “is an outright ban, backed by criminal sanctions.” I’m sure you’re all familiar with the long line of corporate miscreants marched off to the penitentiary for violating campaign finance laws. Why, under the existing law, Kennedy reels with horror, government officials “could have banned the film [Mr. Smith Goes to Washington ] .” austi That’s not only not remotely accurate, it’s ludi- crous. Yet Kennedy’s opinion is filled with similar humbuggery, because he’s desperate to find grandi- ose reasons for making what should be a technical dispute about whether video- on-demand constitutes illegal broadcasting under FEC regulations into the biggest case since Marbury v. Madison. Kennedy’s self-flattering effusions are followed by Chief Justice John Roberts (joined by Samuel Alito), primarily to insist that what looks to any rational person as completely overturning set- tled campaign finance law (feeble as it is) is instead a grand return to original constitutional principle. Antonin Scalia (joined by Alito and Clarence Thomas) weighs in to claim that the founders did not dis- dain or fear corporations quite so much as the dis- senters demonstrate. Wackiest of all, Thomas dis- sents only from upholding laws requiring disclo- sure of campaign donors - because, he says, some California Proposition 8 opponents reportedly harassed or threatened named supporters of the proposition. Now there’s a central social problem of our time: mobs of gay people menacing poor defenseless heterosexuals.

The city has hired outside counsel Robert Icenhauei^Ramirez to handle the lawsuit filed by attorney Adam Loewy on the family’s behalf. Icenhauer-Ramirez has defended the city in similar suits in the past, including in the defense of two officers involved in the notorious 1995 Cedar Avenue Valentine’s Day melee and, more recently, for APD Officer Julie Schroeder, who was termi- nated in 2005 for the shooting death of Daniel Rocha. The city’s original contract with Icenhauer-Ramirez was for $50,000, but council will now consider increasing the total to $300,000 in order to pay for “anticipated fees and expenses,” including the hiring of experts. The money will come from the city’s Liability Reserve Fund. - Jordan Smith > UT TO TACKLE BUDGET WOES A request from the state may see the University of Texas at Austin looking to find $29 mil- lion in savings on top of the $31.1 million it needs to find to cover critical priorities (see “Running the UT Numbers,” Dec. 18, 2009). On Jan. 15, Gov. Rick Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, and House Speaker Joe Straus gave all state agencies one month to present plans to cut 5% of their general revenue and dedicated general revenue fund expenditures over the 2010-2011 bienni- um. The request does not require any reduction in eligibility and essential staff for several of the state’s biggest expenditures such as Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Pro- gram. With those funds protected, that means that the state is actually looking for close to $1.6 billion in savings, or 1% of its total biennial budget. UT Chief Financial Officer Kevin Hegarty said it’s still unclear whether these are one-time costs or wheth- er the 5% is a statewide goal or target each agency must reach. With less than three weeks to go before the submission dead- line, he said, “We hope to have greater clarity on this matter within a week’s time.” - Richard Whittaker > PERRY, PALIN, WHAT A PAIR! The Dallas Cowboys have crashed out of the NFL championship, but Texans still have something to do on Super Bowl Sunday as Gov. Goodhair and the newest Fox News talking head share a stage. Gov. Rick Perry has announced that Fox News contribu- tor and failed vice presidential can- didate Sarah Palin will be stumping for his re-election in Houston on Feb. 7. Details of the event are yet to be confirmed, but if the governor is thinking about cutting into game time, he better have some big- screen TVs on hand. It will be inter- esting to see if the same Republicans who called for MSNBC host Ed Schultz to quit his media job when he was approached to run for North Dakota’s senate seat will at least ask for Palin to drop her employer’s “fair and balanced” label since Perry called her “a true con- servative leader.” - R.W. ANYONE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT? Once again the growth conundrum: If we don’t Hanger together, we’ll all hang separately BY WELLS DUNBAR With Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke’s reappointment potentially running into a buzz saw, Austin has a suitable fed replacement - in the form of Brian Rodgers. City Council watchers may have experienced a profound sense of deja vu last week (Jan. 21), as Rodgers stood in council chambers, weighing in on Domain-related city incen- tives. But it was markedly different this time around: The spe- cial meeting was called to consider city incentives for Hanger Orthopedic Group, designed to entice the company into relo- cating from Maryland to the Domain, North Austin’s mixed- use mall. Moreover, Rodgers was not here in opposition; in contrast to the undeniably messy Domain incentives (which had served as the casus belli behind Stop Domain Subsidies, the campaign that brought Rodgers into the public eye), he, like virtually all the speakers this day, didn’t expressly oppose the city’s pro- posed payments. Indeed, as compared to other incentive agreements, the simplicity of the Hanger deal was roundly praised. (Basically, it’s a $50,000 yearly grant for five years, dependent on the cre- ation of 133 jobs, continuing for five more years if at least 250 jobs are created.) And also, the public process addressing the incentives - the first under expanded notification rules prompted, in part, by Rodgers’ Stop Domain Subsidies work - was praised for its far more transparent process. As Rodgers himself acknowledged, “the process is much improved.” But there’s no improving on perfection, and the question at the meeting’s forefront was a classic in Austin politics: Can growth pay for itself? While Rodgers didn’t oppose the terms of the incentive, he questioned the reasoning of incen- tives in general. The city’s financial analy- sis of the package posited benefits of nearly $6 million to Austin, while tabulating additional expenses - utility costs and added strains on services such as courts, parks, libraries, public safety, and the like - at more than $5 million, leaving an estimated net revenue of roughly $877,000. But in addition, Rodgers extrapolated costs of additional public infrastructure - roads, utility lines - for new homes to absorb the new jobs, which, according to his math, puts the city “in the red” for some $1.8 million. “This is not a Hanger problem,” he said; instead it’s an “underlying structural problem with the way the city deals with growth. ... The city’s in a box, because the more housing units we build, the more money the city needs to raise from cit* hall ustl For more on City Council , see “Council Preview p.14. Follow www.twitter.com/cityhallhustle. its existing citizenry.” Sheryl Cole pointed out the potential fallacy of assuming the 100-plus hires would all be clamoring for new homes, to which Rodgers responded, “We already have an inventory of homes, but then they’ll build a new inventory of homes.” While Rodgers seems right that growth is a treadmill that incessantly revs up its own speed, like the rest of us he doesn’t necessarily have a realistic handle on controlling it. After he said “you don’t fan the flames” of growth through pro-Austin lobbying and PR, Randi Shade opened up on him. “We’ve been growing at a steady clip since 1880, since they’ve been measuring it, whether we were paying for PR firms or whether we weren’t, whether we had Opportunity Austin or we didn’t, whether we had an economic development-savvy City Council [or we didn’t]. ... I’m just perplexed, because I don’t know that activities like this are what are creating the problem.” Ultimately, Rodgers proffered a harsh prescrip- tion for growth management. “What is the solu- tion to keep people from moving here? Well, I guess its to let the unemployment rate drift up to about 6 percent. ... People move here because of jobs. The more jobs, the more net in-migrations. ... By get- ting our unemployment rate so low, we’re inducing people to move here. So I guess you would say we have to let the unemployment rate drift up a bit.” In this respect, Rodgers is an improvement on Bernanke: Ben’s been pilloried for imply- ing 10% unemployment is the price for low inflation; Rodgers thinks 6% is OK if it keeps taxes lower. Aside from the inherent selfishness of the proposal, it raised another problem: in the words of another speaker, Michael Oden, “I don’t think there’s a whole lot that cities can do to determine what their growth is going to be.” Oden, an associate professor at the University of Texas’ School of Architecture who specializ- es in city planning, held forth with Shade on the various - and radically opposed - growth problems cit- ies can face. There’s our problem of trying to pay for expan- sion or the counterpoint problem of decline (think Detroit or Las Vegas), where infrastructure demands must be met with a dwindling, not expanding, tax base. The Hanger package comes back before council this week (Thursday, Jan. 28). While its passage seems all but assured, the eternal argument over how to manage Austin’s exponen- tial growth isn’t going anywhere. ■ res mifolica FOR MORE DETAILS AND EVENTS, SEE COMMUNITY LISTINGS, P.52 THURSDAY2 HOMELESS COUNT VOLUNTEERS NEEDED ECHO, a coalition of local organizations working on home- lessness, needs help tallying homeless people in parks, campsites, and other spaces.

WEDNESDAY AFRICAN AMERICAN RESOURCE ADVISORY COMMISSION meets monthly to discuss and 12 the Austin chronicle January 29, 20 1 o austinchronicle.com POINT AUSTIN CONTINUED FROM P.10 Wrestling with Alligators Thomas’ silliness is only the extreme ver- sion of unreality that runs through all of the majority’s arguments - completely willfully oblivious to the actual state of U.S. politics, in which demonstrable floods of corporate money course through every election cam- paign like, as former Justice Sandra Day O’Connor put it in her McConnell decision, “an alligator in the bathtub.” The majority opinions read like the conversation you might have at the asylum should you arrive on the day after the most brilliant lunatics in residence have just assumed control of the joint. The sentences sound coherent, the syntax is accurate - but all connection to actual, lived political reality has been lost. Kennedy and his colleagues reason not only that artificial, government-sanctioned corporations are akin to citizens, therefore exercising the rights of citizens - but that there is no distinction between corporations and citizens at all. Having created these cyborgs for our economic convenience, we have watched them evolve in size and power beyond all our human political capacities - and now the robots rule. Make no mistake, this is an “activist” deci- sion made by judges determined to force political reality into an idealized abstraction. The dissent of John Paul Stevens (joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor) fairly sputters with frustra- tion at the majority’s blind absolutism. “The Court operates with a sledge hammer rather than a scalpel,” Stevens writes, “when it strikes down one of Congress’ most signifi- cant efforts to regulate the role that corpora- tions and unions play in electoral politics.” He quotes Thomas Jefferson denouncing “the aristocracy of our monied corporations” and points out that the constitutional fram- ers, “Unlike our colleagues . . . had little trou- ble distinguishing corporations from human beings, and when they constitutionalized the right to free speech in the First Amendment, it was the free speech of individual Americans that they had in mind.” Stevens repeatedly emphasizes the practical political reality that Kennedy, et al., expressly dismiss as irrele- vant: “in a functioning democracy the public must have faith that its representatives owe their positions to the people, not to the cor- porations with the deepest pockets.” Sold American But that was in another country, and besides, the horse is dead. Glenn Greenwald, writing last week in Salon, takes (with the American Civil Liberties Union) a free-speech absolutist position but also defends the court’s decision because he considers it already in force. He argues that the current law effectively restricts small corporations (e.g., nonprofit advocacy groups) more harshly than the megafirms and that, in any case, the corporate powers have long since taken control of our national politics - witness the health care/insurance debacle and the impunity of the banks. To take the salient local example, the Texas Association of Business bragged (accurately) that it “blew the doors off” the Legislature with corporate money for “educational” mail- ers in the 2002 campaign - despite century- old state restrictions on corporate campaign money. District Attorney Ronnie Earle threw up a stop sign, a few companies got slapped, and Tom DeLay scuttled away in disgrace - but the House was nevertheless remade in TAB’s image. At the federal level, the restric- tions are supposedly tighter, but it’s hard to believe the Supreme Court’s oblivious deci- sion can make things much worse. Yet just because things are bad is hardly an argument for making them awful. As O’Connor implied, the Supremes might not have been quite so sanguine about the negative effects of corporate campaign money if they still had to troll for it. The history of the Texas Supreme Court amply demonstrates that sufficient buckets of money spent in stra- tegic ways can steadily remake an ordinary citizen’s last refuge into a corporate defen- dant’s final redoubt. Nobody directly “bought” Kennedy, Roberts, Alito, et al. - they just funded a series of administrations that knew what was required of them. And now we’ve got, for a long time, a youthful Supreme majority that expressly believes there is no distinction between money and advocacy.

But can Austinites get their arms around a tree with a 24-inch diameter? Or a 30-inch one? That’s the question with which City Council will grapple at its Feb. 4 meeting, when it hears city staff’s proposal for a “heritage tree” pro- tection ordinance. About two and a half years ago, the Chronicle spotlighted the city’s current tree protection ordinance, which man- dates penalties for chopping down a tree of 19 inches in diameter or greater without a permit - the thrust of the arti- cle being that the law lacks real teeth (see “Clear-Cutting Austin,” Sept. 21, 2007). With a penalty of only $2,000 per tree, some developers simply viewed the fine as a cost of doing business. “The fines are meaningless,” complained one interviewee. “On a half-million-dollar project, a builder will spend more than $2,000 just buying lunch for his workers.” Under a new ordinance that’s been wending its way through the city’s boards and commissions process, the protection for those 19-inch trees would be slightly strengthened, but, more importantly, a new class of protection would be created: Trees with a 24-inch diameter or greater would now be classified as “heritage trees.” Whether this will really have any effect is debatable, though, because state law forbids raising that $2,000 penalty. The key difference in the new classification is that while the current law makes it relatively easy to remove a protected tree by simply getting the city arborist to agree to a mitigation plan (usually the planting of new trees), 24-inchers under the new ordinance wouldn’t be removed unless they are in very poor health, they pose a safety hazard, or a number of alter- natives that might make removal unnecessary have been con- sidered and ruled out. And then there’s the real biggie, also a point of contention: While permission to remove most heritage trees could be granted administratively by the Planning and Development AISD Ponders a Budget Fix Like just about every other governmental agency, the Austin Independent School District is facing a bleak budget cycle. Now Superintendent Meria Carstarphen has implemented an administra- tive hiring freeze and is asking the board of trustees to consider the extraordinary step of declaring financial exigency, allowing her to make major structural reforms to stanch the budget bleeding. Current calculations show that the district needs an extra $15.7 million in fiscal year 2010: $8.6 million for priority first-year projects in the new strategic plan and $7.1 million to cover a predicted tax shortfall. In 2008, voters approved a property tax increase of 3.9 cents per $100 valuation. At the time, the board of trustees was criticized by Education Austin President Louis Malfaro for not proposing a larger increase to give more long-term stability. Now, with property values sinking, the district is left with a structur- al deficit. AISD Chief Financial Officer Nicole Conley-Abram said, “Basically, our expenditures are outpacing our predicted revenues, so in order to elimi- nate the structural deficit, we have to pare down our expenditures.” While the 2010 fiscal year budget is still in its predrafting stage, Carstarphen has suggested that the board declare financial exigency. Under the Texas Education Code, this is an emergency state that allows districts to terminate contracts early. Carstarphen suggested that this time exigency is about taking a structural approach to running the district. She said: “We’re so used to accumulating the debt and unleashing huge program reductions as our budgeting style. To me, those things just show a lack of foresight.” Echoing that sentiment, AISD board of trustees President Mark Williams said: “Everyone wants to plan, everyone wants to have a bal- anced budget, and everyone says they want us to reach all these goals, but no one’s willing to say, ‘What’s it going to take to do that?’ What she’s done is accelerated the conversation.” The board is scheduled to discuss the budget at its Feb. 8 work session, and Carstarphen expects her request to be discussed then. If the trustees decide to move forward, a vote could take place as early as their Feb. 22 regular meeting. However, board Vice President Vince Torres said he was “surprised” by Carstarphen’s request and will wait for more detailed staff presentations on the budget before considering such a radical step. - Richard Whittaker Matter Review Department, removal of one with a diameter of 30 inches or greater would require permission from the Land Use Commission after a review by the Environmental Board and possibly the Urban Forestry Board. Translation: public hearings. That doesn’t sit well with the Real Estate Council of Austin. RECA - often painted as the bad guy in enviro vs. developer wars - says it supports the current ordinance and even the creation of a heritage tree ordinance. But the Land Use Commission hearings would lead the process down the wrong path, says RECA Vice President Jeff Howard. “We hear the concerns of people who would like to see a stricter ordinance for our biggest and best trees and would like to see it stricter in terms of removing those trees,” he says. But as for hear- ings on 30-inch-plus trees: “The concern there is not just the timing and expense of going through that process ... but there’s also the concern that we will take what ought to be an objective position made by professionals considering all the various site constraints in a development and make it a politi- cal decision. ... [It] could potentially make the trees straw men for opposition to a project so that it will be a tool to oppose development rather than a tool to enhance the urban canopy.” The ordinance has strong support from the city’s Urban Forestry Board, says board Chair Keith Babberney. The value of such trees “goes beyond the touchy-feely,” he says. “The urban forest should be viewed as part of the city’s infrastructure,” he says. “It provides stormwater remediation, air filtering, shading, which reduces UV degradation of pave- ment. It reduces the heat island effect; it reduces the demand for electricity. And trees are the only part of our infra- structure that has any potential to increase in value. And 90 percent of our infrastructure benefits come from 10 percent of our trees - you can plant 100 1-inch trees to replace a 100-inch tree, but you don’t get the return on that investment for many, many years.” In the Mix There’s much afoot at this week’s City Council meeting (Thursday, Jan. 28), across several disparate categories. Let’s take a look. WON'T SOMEBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN? Council has done just that, in addressing controversial budget-cut suggestions from last year relating to children’s But will the ordinance make any difference without stronger financial penalties? “The way it’s written now, it needs some more work,” says Babberney, although he didn’t specify what that might be. “It’s hard for me to ever say it has enough teeth, but I’m certainly on board with any improvement that’s better than what we have now. If we can do more later, we’ll do more later.” Babberney defends the public process about which RECA worries. “It doesn’t [currently] take much to get a tree approved for removal,” he says. “It only takes one person, a city inspector. Not that those guys aren’t doing enough now to protect trees, but one person having a bad day or getting strong-armed by the person requesting removal, any number of factors, might lead to a bad decision, and there’s not much recourse to that - once the permit is given, the tree comes down.” The ordinance also has the support of the Save Our Springs Alliance. Read the draft text of the ordinance at www.cityofaustin.org/ trees. The final public hearing on the ordinance before it goes to council will be before the city’s Zoning and Platting Commission on Tuesday, Feb. 2. - Lee Nichols decommissioning the Green Water Treatment Plant next to Seaholm. Work there had ceased since the city noticed URS’ “consistent problems in controlling the safety environ- ment on the Green Project, including the activities of its subcontractors,” wrote Public Works Director Howard Lazarus in a memo to council. activities. Last meeting, it was funding “splash pads,” water features for parks that saw their pools closed per the tightening of the city budget. This week, council takes up another hot topic from last summer’s budget battles: keeping the lights on for Little League teams. A proposal to charge teams for utilities was pulled over public outcry. Now it seems the city is striking a compromise with Item 30, which will cover utilities “up to a maximum amount per- year per-field,” an as-yet-undetermined number to be based on the look of the budget in a given year. Similarly, Item 42 enters the city into an agreement with the West Austin Youth Association to develop sports programs, with a funding vote to be brought back to council in 60 days. ANYTHING BUT BRIEF A pair of briefings are scheduled for 10:30am; the first, Item 44, discusses Austin Energy’s generation mix - coal, gas, renewables - and AE’s intrinsically linked Carbon Reduction Plan, which seeks to wean us off the fossil fuels. A final vote isn’t expected until later this spring. (For more, see “The AE Generation Plan’s Latest Monkey Wrench,” p.15.) Item 45 brings council up to speed on redevelopment efforts along lower Shoal Creek and Seaholm; on a somewhat related note, Item 23 would add an extra $525,000 to the contact with URS Corporation, bounci PREVIEW DON'T BE DENSE As we wrote last week, council acquiesced to the Planning Commission’s request for more time to study the density bonuses as part of the Downtown Austin Plan. Item 58 gives the commission the authority to con- vene a stakeholder review board and sets dates for interim updates. The commission has until June 8 to issue its final recommendations. INCENTIVES EXCITEMENT The $50,000-a-year incentive package aimed at attracting Hanger Orthopedic Group to Austin comes up for all-but-certain final approval as Item 43 (see “City Hall Hustle,” p.12). Additionally, a few items of note are in the draft agenda posted for council’s next meeting, Feb. 4, includ- ing tweaks to the city’s single-stream recycling contract extension with Greenstar North America. Added flexibility in the contract, such as not having to deliver all recyclables to Greenstar for the last six months of the contract (March to September 2011), bodes well for the city using a local materials recovery facility by the spring of 2011. Also, a 6pm public hearing is scheduled to discuss “heritage tree” protections in which a variance would be required to remove trees more than 2 feet in diameter, measured at a height of 4V2 feet from the ground (see “Heritage Trees: Size Does Matter,” above). - Wells Dunbar 14 the Austin chronicle January 29, 20 1 o austinchronicle.com The AE Generation Plan's Latest Monkey Wrench Generation Plan: The Good, the Bad, and the Holy Some recent events have given supporters of Austin Energy’s generation plan reason for optimism. The Interfaith Environmental Network has come out in support of the proposal, countering criticism from the Catholic Diocese of Austin, which had thus far been the most vocal group from the faith community, an especially significant body of stakeholders because of its work with low-income rate- payers. Then last week, Portland General Electric Co. announced intentions to shut down Oregon’s only coal-fired power plant, seemingly bolstering environmentalists’ position that phasing out coal is feasi- ble and cost-effective. But the imminent retirement of AE General Manager Roger Duncan has cast a shadow over the plan’s future. “He has been such a point person and leader on the generation plan,” says Council Member Sheryl Cole. “It’s hard to push without Roger here.” Indeed, opinions expressed at a Monday night public forum on the search for Duncan’s replacement fell largely along the same lines as the generation plan debate - environmental concerns vs. commercial/industrial interests - and led to speculation that the new hire better be able to “walk on water.” - N.A. On Thursday (Jan. 28), City Council dis- cusses Austin Energy’s 2020 generation plan proposal, hoping to establish the right mix of traditional and renewable energy resources to power Austin’s homes and businesses through the next decade. Despite nearly two years of deliberation on the plan - and support for AE’s proposal from the Electric Utility Commission, the Resource Management Commission, and the Austin Generation Resource Planning Task Force - council is unlikely to be making any quick decisions. While the proposal fulfills Austin Climate Protection Plan goals, critics have charged it doesn’t go far enough, especially when it comes to phasing out coal; others have balked at the potential costs. As public debate has focused on balancing these issues, officials looking ahead to the next legislative session have hit upon yet another troubling concern: potential deregulation of Texas’ municipally owned utilities. If publicly owned utilities such as AE were to some extent privatized and forced to com- pete in Texas’ energy market, the city of Austin could lose a substantial chunk of its income. (About 20% of the city’s money comes from utility fund transfers; it’s unclear whether deregulation would affect the entire AE amount or just a portion.) Rumors began circulating last fall that generation-plan skep- tics might support deregulation efforts in 2011, in retaliation for passage of the plan, but supporters held their ground. “There cer- tainly are always rumors about the industri- als going to the Legislature asking for Austin to be deregulated,” said Public Citizen’s Tom “Smitty” Smith at the time. “And we fully expect they will, whether or not” AE takes a position favorable toward them, he added. Meanwhile, John Sutton of the Building Owners and Managers Association - a member of both the AE task force and the Coalition for Clean, Affordable, Reliable Energy, one of the most vocal critics of the plan - says he knows of no such efforts. “That [deregula- tion] was one of the things that we [at CCARE] threw out there as a possibility,” said Sutton recently, referring to discussions last fall, “but it didn’t really go very far.” City staff and council members couldn’t point to a specific person or group profess- ing to support deregulation, but several said the possibility can’t be ignored. City Council Member Bill Spelman said such opposition has “largely been motivated by folks who don’t realize our costs are going to go up anyway.” Still, he said, there’s reason to believe that the Lege is watching Austin. Last week, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst issued interim charges to the Senate Business and Commerce Committee to “study the generation costs of municipally owned elec- tric utilities’ planned generation portfolios.” “It doesn’t say, ‘Let’s talk about opening Austin up to competition.’ I think that’s what everybody’s reading into it, and I’m not even sure whether that’s appropriate. Maybe we shouldn’t be reading anything into it,” said Spelman. Nonetheless, he said, “I think we need to take it very seriously.” While the generation plan remains on council’s regular Thursday agenda, the deregulation issue may stay behind closed doors for now, as council has also sched- uled an executive session “to discuss or take action on a ‘competitive matter’ of Austin Energy.” The generation plan debate is likely to drag on for at least another month; city staff are planning a public forum on the plan for mid- to late February. - Nora Ankrum METRORAIL WATCH HOW LONG WILL WE WAIT FOR THE TRAIN? IT’S HERE! Capital Metro sent a letter to the Federal Railroad Administration Jan. 21 stat- ing that its attempt to work out the kinks in its signaling and crossing-guard system for its Leander-to-Downtown commuter rail system are “well under way” and should be complete by the end of February. And here’s the big one you’re waiting for: “We will operate the system to simulate revenue service for two weeks in early March and will open the line later in March. A specific date has not yet been set.” You’ll have to forgive us if we’re skeptical. Haven’t we been the wrong way down this track before? But we will give them the benefit of the doubt and raise the arm another notch. IN OTHER CAPITAL METRO NEWS: Austin Mayor Pro Tem Mike Martinez was elected chair of the Capital Metro board of directors by his fellow board members Monday. “There’s a better day coming for Capital Metro,” said Martinez. “I don’t plan on staying in this position for 10 or 15 years.” Instead, he said, he wants to get the agency where “we all want it to be” and then move on. The agency hired Gilbert Tweed International for $175,900 to lead its search for a new CEO/president. Martinez said speed in hiring was not the issue. “For me, it’s not about whether it takes six days or six months,” he said, but about getting the best possible candidate. Monday’s board meeting had a good deal of tension, as dozens of citizens with disabilities packed the small boardroom wall-to-wall to complain about the agency’s treatment of the transit-dependent, apparently motivated at least in part by an article in last week’s Chronicle (see “Can’t Get There From Here,” Jan. 22). - Lee Nichols OVERSTOCK SALE QUEEN SIZE PLATFORM BED CAPPUCCINO FINISH $229 5 PIECE CAPPUCCINO FINISH TABLE WITH 4 CHAIRS $269 ALL MATTRESS SETS HALF OFF QUEEN SIZE EURO MATTRESS SET $199 OVER 12 DIFFERENT WEJ5ELL COMFORT LEVELS -POUUCfl GTOnC nCCHL-P-CK EVOKING ANCIENT FOLKLORES OF COURAGE • CLARITY • STRENGTH BALANCE AND HEALING CRYSTAL WORKS 12th and LaiDDr behind the Tavern 472. 5597 Hop On The Love Train Love will be in the air aboard the Sweetheart Specials.

During his 2008 presidential campaign, then-Sen. Barack Obama applauded the Harlem Children’s Zone in New York for using governmental, educational, and nonprofit groups in a coordinated program to break the cycle of childhood poverty. His election pledge was to create 20 Promise Neighborhoods that could apply the lessons of Harlem across the nation. Now public agencies and nonprofit groups in Travis County are competing to become part of this grand experiment. The Harlem Children’s Zone was founded in 1997 by education advocate Geoffrey Canada: Serving 15,000 children and 7,000 adults in a 100-block area of New York, the concept is to create a pipeline from cradle to career, bringing together every possible neigh- borhood influence and social agency to both enrich the educational process and remove impediments to childhood development. The Obama administration’s Promise Neighbor- hood initiative, as it’s described, won’t sim- ply duplicate what worked in Harlem with the hope it will work everywhere. Instead, U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan has said it takes the “core concepts of the Harlem Children’s Zone” and creates localized solu- tions to specific local problems. The basic idea is to target specific neighbor- hoods, selected on criteria of poverty and aca- demic underachievement. A consortium of gov- ernmental agencies and nonprofits would then work together to provide interlocking services to address the root causes underlying child- hood poverty and consequent academic diffi- culties. Since each community has different issues, from high parental unemployment to limited English language proficiency to child homelessness, each project proposal must reflect the needs of the individual community. Texas Rep. Mark Strama, D-Austin, said it’s all about giving kids from economically disadvan- taged backgrounds the chance to thrive by pro- viding the same resources and opportunities as those available to children from affluent homes. He said, “There’s nothing explosive in that - except no one’s ever tried to do it.” There’s more on the line than convening a few interagency committees. Before the sum- mer, the Department of Education will release the terms to apply for the first stage: selecting 20 neighborhood consortia, each getting a $500,000 planning grant funded with American Recovery and Rehabilitation Act money. There will be additional long-term fed- eral funding, and the consortia will work with federal agencies including the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Environmental Protection Agency. Welcoming the change of focus on barriers to childhood development, the Austin Independent School District board of trustees President Mark Williams said: “Sometimes we have a ten- dency to look at schools and say, ‘You’re fail- ing kids,’ and we don’t realize that there are many other factors that impact how they per- form in school. Are they hungry, scared, sleepy, sick, don’t come to school at all?” Two proposals are being drafted in Travis County, both focusing on East Austin. One, backed by the Sooch Foundation and the Webber Family Foundation, brings together representatives of the city of Austin and AISD, as well as local nonprofits such as dropout pre- vention experts Communities in Schools, youth services provider LifeWorks, and affordable housing advocates Foundation Communities. Their focus is on the St. John/Coronado Hills neighborhood planning area between 1-35, Highway 290, and Highway 183, potentially using AISD’s Reagan High “vertical team” - from elementary through high school - as the project backbone. Education nonprofit Southwest Key Programs is working on its own proposal for the Govalle and Johnston Terrace neighborhoods. This would build on its existing East Austin Children’s Promise pro- gram and use resources like Southwest Key’s East Austin Family Center and its charter school, the East Austin College Prep Academy. Potential confusion or competition among local bids may be the least of Austin’s wor- ries. Representatives from 120 consortia from across the nation attended the Changing the Odds conference hosted by Duncan and the Harlem Children’s Zone in November, but there are expected to be between 150 and 200 applications filed. Strama attended the meet- ing with the St. John group and warned: “We’re going to be going up against Detroit and Cleveland. When Austin’s application reaches [the Department of Education] they’re going to say, ‘Austin doesn’t have blight.’” The challenge will be breaking that presumption, and Strama said the city’s high child poverty and low graduation rates could strengthen its case. He said, “When they put up the num- bers that they were attacking in Harlem, I said, ‘That could describe East Austin.’” Council Member Sheryl Cole serves on the local Promise Neighborhoods advisory committee and described this project as almost a missing piece in council thinking. She said, “We spend a lot of time, and right- fully so, dealing with the implications of cli- mate protection, transportation, and public service issues, but all those things depend on us having a future generation.” Staff is already looking at using city-owned assets like recreation centers as part of any eventu- al program. She said, “I’m really anxious to see in what capacity we can use those facili- ties [to] improve student performance.” Whatever the final result for Austin’s appli- cations, both local initiatives applaud the pro- cess. John Turner, Southwest Key’s interim communications director, said, “If we got this grant, it would be great, but it would really just accelerate what’s happening anyway.” St. John Community School Alliance facilitator Allen Weeks echoed that sentiment: “The coalition building part is the greatest benefit for any city. That will remain, whether we get the grant or not.” - Richard Whittaker Fundraising Battle in Precinct 4 ontne V . , A house divided? This home brandishes two campaign yard signs for two candidates - Margaret Gomez and Raul ' .. Alvarez - competing for the same seat. m m It’s rare when a political challenger raises more money than a veteran incumbent, but Raul Alvarez, who is challenging incumbent Precinct 4 County Commissioner Margaret Gomez, managed to do just that in the final months of 2009, the most recent campaign filings show. Alvarez raised $30,417 (including a $3,000 loan to himself) between the time he filed for office in October through the end of December. By comparison, Gomez raised $21,508 between July and December. The hitch is that Gomez started the cam- paign season sitting on a comfortable cush- ion of more than $43,000 and, after an assortment of expenditures, reported having $42,103 left in her war chest, which is likely to swell in the weeks leading up to the March 2 primary. Alvarez ended the reporting period with just less than $11,000 cash on hand, so he still has his fundraising work cut out for him. Once the candidates had filed their cam- paign reports this month, Gomez’s campaign was the first to issue a press release, stating the incumbent had “nearly a 4 to 1 cash on hand advantage over her opponent.” Alvarez fired back with a statement that he had “out- raised his opponent by nearly $10,000.” The finance reports show Gomez receiving larger contributions from fewer donors when compared to Alvarez. Gomez picked up several $1,000 and $1,500 contributions from big lobby law firms such as Clark, Thomas & Winters; Brown McCarroll; and Vinson & Elkins. She also pulled in smaller donations, generally in the $50 to $150 range, from loyal county employees; local progressives such as parks advocate Ted Siff and political consultant Kelly Fero, who died earlier this month; and from current members of the Commissioners Court and former and cur- rent elected officials, among them state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez, District Judge Charlie Baird, for- mer County Attorney Ken Oden, and former County Commissioner Karen Sonleitner. Alvarez’s campaign claimed more than 200 individual donors - 80% of them contributing $100 or less - ranging from grassroots activ- ists (Robin Schneider, Karen Hadden, Tom “Smitty” Smith, Susana Almanza) to City Hall observers and players such as former council candidate and Planning Commissioner Perla Cavazos and city employee and former Zoning and Platting Commissioner Clarke Hammond. Alvarez’s largest contributions ($1,000 each) came from Channy Soeur and Raza Khataw, engineering consulting firm owners. On Wednesday, Jan. 27, Mayor Pro Tern Mike Martinez, Council Member Randi Shade, and former Mayor Pro Tern Betty Dunkerley hosted a fundraiser for Alvarez. - Amy Smith 16 the Austin chronicle January 29, 20 1 o austinchronicle.com State Gives Almaguer Deadline for Tire Cleanup Victor Almaguer, the tire shop owner left holding the bag on roughly 6,000 scrap tires collected from city of Austin vehicles, has until Feb. 8 to comply with state laws governing the handling and disposal of scrap tires, says the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. If Almaguer fails to get his tire business in order, according to TCEQ’s penalty policy, he could face thou- sands in fines. Since as far back as 2003, scrap tires removed from city vehicles have been mold- ering on property Almaguer leases in South- east Austin. Almaguer says he was told to remove the tires by Bill Janousek, Tire Program manager for the city’s Fleet Ser- vices Division, but that he has not been paid for removing and storing the tires since at least 2007. (Janousek has been placed on administrative leave pending investigation.) According to Almaguer, Janousek told him to remove the tires even though he allegedly knew that Almaguer was not registered as a scrap-tire trans- porter, as is required under state environ- mental regulations. We first reported on the story in early December, which prompted the TCEQ to open two investigations, one into Almaguer’s handling of the situation and another into the city’s management of the tires it removes each year from the rough- ly 5,000 vehicles maintained by Fleet Services (see “Tire Mound of Mystery,” Dec. 4, 2009). According to a TCEQ report, agency investigators found Almaguer in violation of four state code provisions governing the management of scrap tires. In addition to citing Almaguer for not being registered as a transporter, TCEQ found that he also failed to register as a scrap-tire storage site or as a scrap- tire generator (requirements for anyone storing more than 500 tires) and that he had also failed to register as a scrap-tire processing facility - since Almaguer actu- ally worked to dismantle some of the city tires he’s been storing by cutting the side- walls and collapsing the tires, he is also “considered a scrap tire facility,” the investigators wrote. Almaguer says that he and his attorney are in communication with TCEQ on the best way to resolve the issues at hand and that he’s negotiating with the city for removal of the tires, which could take place this week. “We’re going through some tough times right now,” he said. The investigation into the city’s handling of scrap tires - including whether it has failed to follow state law that requires strict documentation for the final disposition of all such tires (our investigation revealed that the city had failed to properly docu- ment disposal of any of its scrap tires since at least 2006) - is ongoing, said TCEQ spokeswoman Andrea Morrow. Meanwhile, the city still has not released to the Chronicle any written com- munications among city employees and officials regarding potential problems with the scrap-tire program. Although the city initially told us that our inquiries had raised questions that senior management had “previously not been advised of,” the city then appealed our open records request. In a December letter to Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, Assistant City Attorney Cary Grace wrote that the Austin Police Department sergeant “who is responsible for overseeing the criminal investigation has requested that these evi- dentiary communications be withheld while the investigation is on-going.” The A.G.’s ruling is due in mid-February. - Jordan Smith 320-3555 2617 SOUTH I st ST.

In fact, Berchelmann wrote in his findings of fact that Keller’s “conduct ... does not warrant removal from office, or even further reprimand beyond the public humiliation she has surely suffered.” Whether the State Commission on Judicial Conduct will agree with that conclusion remains to be seen. Keller was tried last summer on a string of ethics charges brought by the SCJC connected to Richard’s execution on Sept. 25, 2007. Richard’s attorneys with the Texas Defender Service had sought a stay of execution based in part on the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision that day to hear a Kentucky case challenging the three-drug lethal injection method of exe- cution. Although the court ultimately upheld the cocktail method of execution as constitu- tional, their decision to take the case imposed a de facto moratorium on executions until they issued their decision in April 2008. On the day Richard was to be executed, TDS was unable to finish preparing its appeals until after 5pm; that afternoon, a TDS paralegal called the court’s deputy clerk to ask whether it could file the appeal after 5pm, the time the clerk’s office would close. The deputy called then-General Counsel Ed Marty, who called Keller at home to ask about accepting the late filing. Keller reportedly told Marty the court would close at 5pm. What she meant by that has been the sub- ject of much debate: Was she saying that the clerk’s office would close at 5pm or that the court itself would shut its doors? More than two years later, the answer remains unclear, noted Berchelmann. “Most likely, [none of the court employees] was making a precise distinc- tion between the two,” he wrote in his decision. Regardless, there were other ways for TDS to file the appeal - notably, by contacting directly the other judges on the court to ask if any of them would accept the late filing. Had TDS done so (the judges’ phone numbers are in the phone book, he noted), they would’ve found that Judge Cheryl Johnson, the judge assigned to the Richard case, was ready and waiting to accept an appeal. This was a “vital” mistake by TDS, Berchelmann wrote. (Moreover, he noted that TDS should have had its lawyers call the court to confirm whatever information the paralegal had learned from Marty. Had they done so, he wrote, “they likely would have been able to present the lethal injection claim. Their error does not implicate Judge Keller.”) Because no final appeal was filed with the CCA, the federal courts were unable to inter- vene, and Richard was executed that evening. Berchelmann found that the lion’s share of responsibility for the failed appeal rested with TDS. While TDS originally claimed that major computer problems hampered their ability to get the appeal in on time, the judge noted that there was no evidence to support that claim. As it turns out, TDS’ computer problems that day had to do with internal e-mail communications. “Much like a lot of the other allegations in this case, the ‘seri- ous computer crash’ story seems to be an embellishment that was blown out of propor- tion in the media,” Berchelmann wrote. “TDS has only itself to blame for not having the pleadings prepared by 5:00.” That said, Keller’s action - or, inaction - did not escape Berchelmann’s scrutiny. Keller “certainly did not exhibit a model of open communication,” he wrote. “She should have been more forthcoming with Marty,” telling him, “at a minimum,” that he should direct communications to Judge Johnson, who had stayed at work late in anticipation of an appeal. Or Keller “could have called Judge Johnson herself,” he wrote. Although under Texas law it is Keller’s call on whether to keep the clerk’s office open late, her refusal to do so was not “nefarious or a purposeful attempt to circumvent” the court’s execution-day pro- cedures, he wrote. Still, her decision not to keep the doors open “might have exhibited poor judgment,” he wrote, and she “certainly exhibited poor judgment in not reminding Marty” of proper procedure and in failing to notify Johnson that TDS wanted to file late. The SCJC will now consider what to do. The commission is not bound by Berchelmann’s findings and may reprimand Keller or could even decide she needs to be removed from the bench. But her lawyer Chip Babcock said in a statement that Keller is “gratified” by Berchelmann’s decision. Although Keller said in court that she would not change any of her actions on that day if she could, Babcock said that Keller takes to heart Berchelmann’s “advice that she should strive to be more col- legial and that the court’s internal communi- cations should improve.” Indeed, in his ruling, Berchelmann noted that Keller was not completely innocent in what happened in the Richard case: “Judge Keller’s conduct ... was not exemplary of a public ser- vant,” he wrote. “She should have been more open and helpful about the way in which the TDS could present the lethal injection claim to the [CCA],” he continued. “Although she says that if she could do it all over again she would not change any of her actions, this cannot be true. Any reasonable person, having gone through this ordeal, surely would realize that open communication, particularly during the hectic few hours before an execution, would benefit the interests of justice.” - Jordan Smith County Permits TXI Aggregate Mine Ruling: ‘A Raging Flashf lood. of Corporate Money’ On Tuesday, the Travis County Commission- ers Court voted 3-2 to approve the site devel- opment permits for Texas Industries’ embat- tled Hornsby Bend sand and gravel mining project near Webberville - with Commis- sioners Ron Davis and Karen Huber dissent- ing. The vote apparently clears the way for TXI to prepare the roadway improvements (under a separately approved agreement with the county) that would eventually support sand and gravel mining on nearly 2,000 acres, in a project opposed by many local residents. The vote had been postponed at the Jan. 12 Commissioners Court meeting after the Fort Worth office of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, alerted by a resident of Austin’s Colony, said it wanted to meet with TXI and review the project for potential Corps jurisdiction under the U.S. Clean Water Act. On Jan. 21, Stephen Brooks of the USACE wrote TXI: “[W]e have determined this project will not involve activities subject to the requirements of Section 404 [of the Clean Water Act] or Section 10 [of the Rivers and Harbors Act, governing navigable waters]. Therefore, it will not require Department of the Army authorization.” Brooks said the decision was based on project docu- ments provided by TXI, other available informa- tion, and “field reconnaissance conducted by USACE personnel January 20, 2010.” At its Jan. 12 meeting (see “Point Austin,” Jan. 15), commissioners said they were sur- prised by the Corps’ intervention, because previous county requests for review concern- ing similar projects had been summarily rebuffed. But Ryan Metz, an environmental consultant who lives near the proposed site, contacted the Corps directly and told the commissioners he believed TXI’s own docu- ments reflected at least one tributary of Gilleland Creek that should fall under feder- al environmental jurisdiction. This week, Metz called the Corps’ decision “disappointing to say the least” and said that he was told that Corps personnel concluded “the tributary in question would be classified as a ‘grass-lined swale,’ and as such, would not be considered waters of the United States.” (The county’s agreement with TXI covers roadway improve- ments necessary to transport the aggregate to the company’s processing plant, but according to Corps personnel, any permit review concerning the roadway work would not include the mining itself.) “We are not giving up,” said Metz via e-mail, “but this new development certainly hurts our community’s cause. ... We hope that an unspoken revelator is out there waiting for the most opportunistic time to come forward.” - Michael King It has been called the worst court decision since Chief Justice Roger B. Taney told Dred Scott that African-Americans could not be U.S. citizens and the most intellectually dis- honest since the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals said checks aren’t money.
