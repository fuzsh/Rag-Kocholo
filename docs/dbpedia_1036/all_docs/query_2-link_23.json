Music Patron By STAN I I here w.is a lime when private philanthropy kept the am ■live In the d«Sfcr*l en, Haydn was in ihcMrrviccof Prince ts- \\ethtny end, in fM lived on the Prince*! cMatc There are numaous cxamplo of Ihis kind of personal pa- tronage BecUttOven'i pnlroni were Count Rawumovsky and Prince Lobkowilz; Tchaikovsky was vupported largely by a pri- vate jnnujl gift from a wealthy woman. Madame von Meek. Here in the U S.. Ihc Boston Symphony was founded .ind supported fol the first 30 Of 40 yean of lift ewsicnce by a single individual. Maj, Hcnr> I cc Higginson And such in- stitutions as the Metropolitan Opera, for example, existed tor many years as a result of the personal philanthropy of Otto Kahn and Mrs August Belmont. Now. for a variety of rea- sons, the primary one being U S. income tax laws, per- sonal philanthropy has dwindled to a much less im- portant role in supporting the arts and artists. There arc. of course, certain important exceptions in our own recent history. For example. Mrs. E.ijiabe.b Spraguc Coolidgc personally commissioned an extensive list of prominent composers in the creation of new music. Among the composers on this roster, we even find j giant like Stravinsky. More recently, one of the members of the board of directors of the Philharmonic Symphony Society of New York. Francis Ooelet. commissioned a scries of concertos for the principal players of the Philharmonic from a wide vari- ety of distinguished composers. And one of those compositions, a concerto for four percussion soloists, by Michael Colgrass. won the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1978 Bui the period of personal benefaction is now mostly a thing FY ADAMS of the past. Nn arts institution can exist without income Cutnp| t mentary to what it takes in at the box office, since expenses f$ exceed the proceeds That is exactly where gosernmcnt support comes into the picture. In Europe, it s an old story. Europe^ governments subsidize their arts institutions on a really gra^ scale. On a per capita basis, for example. Austria has the great, csl involvement with ihc arts, the U.S. is far behind the testof the world in its recognition of the arts. That is not lo say that there aren't greai things happenings the U S. on a national. sUtc and city level, even though iht ton cept is still m its infancy Most slates have arts councils. wtiKt support their local institutions The National Endowment fci the Arts, which was established by an Act of Congress hardy i dozen years ago has been a necessary vehicle of support for u* arts and arts organizations. One of ASCAP's distinguished composers. Ezra aLaderman. is the head of the music progrix for the National Endowment Stanley Adams: \"Fear of government interference has long been erased.\" Personal philanthropy has been hurt by U.S. tax laws The fear once held that government support would mean government interference or control has long since been erased It's a sign of ihc increasing matunty of America u a society thai the government iLself recognizes the need for support of the am as a way of improving the quality of life. In the process, numer- ous responsible and knowledgeable persons in the arts bate been attracted to committees and organ izati on s within the gov ernmcnt framework geared to foster the arts. It is obvious that more government involvement and suppor of the arts is needed if they are to flounsh And this is preciich the kind of government involvement that has to be encuuragtt and applauded.

KL'SISTO My response to a recent Commentary titled \"An Obituary For B-Timck\" is not triggered by the tact that I have been dubbed Mr. 8-Truck by Billboard and other publications. However. I believe the author. James Zcbora. takes a view- that is over-simplistic. We all would, ut some time in recorded history , have pre- ferred a single formal. Today, WC still have the 45 r.p m. single and the 33' • r p m I P If we had simplified down to a single speed standard the cost of plas back hardware would have been reduced It would also be a lot simpler if wc had only OM stand- ard tor vidcodisk and videotape But competitive technology cannot readily be pooled by edict in a free market. More importantly, (he market- the end user-will decide preference by value received, that is. perform- ance versus cost. The free market should decide the ratio of (ape configura- tion. 8-rrack versus cassette, for each system had inherent ad- vantages Stereo 8 has the potential tor equal or superior qual- ity by virtue of its higher tape speed alone But no one httytt made a serious effort to upgrade K-traik to the degree achieved by cassette proponents. I lived through the \"battle of the tape systems\" and observed the major cassette thrusts in the late '60s and early \"70s. In each of these episodes cassette technology didn't quite make it for the intended music application I his has changed, of count and current cassette performance exceeds what anyone could have predicted in 1965-66. So. who can be sure what the ultimate svstem will be'' tadi month or so I am exposed t«> better upc systems than werecah just available Lei the public decide hou the pic will divide. Ultimately, we will have a discrete quadraphonic FM broad- cast standard approved Stereo 8 could provide an easy JCCOBi mod at ion for a roaring rebirth of real discrete quad.
