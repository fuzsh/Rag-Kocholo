        "text": "SOUNDTRACK: DARLINGSIDE-Whippoorwill EP (2016).\n\nThis EP is a collection of some B-sides and Outtakes from their fantastic album Birds Say. There are five songs, included a stunning cover of Smashing Pumpkins’ “1979.”\n\nThe other four songs are the lovely “Whippoorwill” punctuated by scratches from the mandolin and guitar at the end of each line. Lead vocals seem to be from Auyon, but there’s very rarely one lead vocalist here. And just when you think the song is a pretty folk song, the end gets bigger, with a cool bass line and louder harmonies.\n\n“Fourth of July” is all about harmonies and a propulsive chorus. And “Open Door” is almost a capella. The only music for a time is the scratching of Harris Paseltine’s guitar strings as a rhythm while all four sing beautifully. This song is faster than many of their others and even features a whistling solo. There is some minimal violin on this track but it really feels fully a capella.\n\n“Blow the House Down” is an old song (from their debut–when they had a drummer!) reissued here as a foursome. What’s notable about it is that vocals are supplied almost exclusively by bassist David Senft. Rather interesting humming bass backing vocals are supplied by everyone else. It ends with a wailing (for them) noisy solo from Don Mitchell’s electric guitar and Auyon’s violin (it’s even more intense live).\n\nThe final song is their terrific cover of “1979.” I’ve always thought the music for this song was wonderful. But hearing their version of it I realized how much Corgan’s voice kinda ruins the song. Hearing these guys harmonize the verse is pretty great. But hearing them sing full-out on the chorus “I don’t even care” is utterly gorgeous. Their version is the gold standard for this song now. It’s a great EP (and three of the guys signed it for me!).\n\n[READ: November 5, 2017] Castle in the Stars\n\nThis gorgeous graphic novel was originally published in French and was translated by Anne and Owen Smith.\n\nThe title is an intriguing one and while initially confusing, it makes perfect scene when you realize the book is about ballooning: “1868: The Age of Progress, an era of industry… beyond the blue of the sky, where the cold freezes the breath, where the air disappears…the mysetry begins.”\n\nFor this story is not just about ballooning, it is about The Secret of Aether.\n\nThe story is about young Seraphin. As the book opens, his mother is going into the balloon. His father is yelling at her that she is crazy to go up in the is weather (gorgeous ominous clouds fill the full page). He tries to guilt her into not going. But her balloon is equipped with a bulb that will light when it gets to the aether, which is her quest. Then she is up in the air writing in her journal.\n\nShe rises to 12,000 meters but… nothing. She’s about to give up when at 12,900 meters the bulb shines brightly and then explodes. She found it! And she is never seen again.

Kate Stables’ voice is unique and has an appealing affectation that I can;’t quite figure out but which I enjoy hearing And the music on “Moonshine Freeze” is just tremendous–different textures coming from different guitars. I really can’t get enough of it.\n\nThe band’s only permanent member is singer Kate Stables. For this show, she’s accompanied by Rosalind Leyden, Jamie Whitby-Coles, Noil Smith, Adam Schatz, Jonah Parzen-Johnson. It’s amusing that for the first song, everyone but the bald man is wearing a toque.\n\nIn this Tiny Desk Concert the first song is “Bullet Proof.” It’s just a four piece: bass (Rosalind), drums (Jamie), guitar (Noil) and Kate on lead banjo and vocals. Her voice sounds like classic British folk singers–very clean and open-voweled. Once the echoed guitar rises in, the song sound really full. The song also tells a story, as the blurb points out.\n\nAnd the stories … Kate … weaves are profound but sweet with a tone that quietly reels you in.\n\nAlthough it is my least favorite song of the three, possibly because the other two are so much fuller. For songs 2 and 3 Jonah and Adam join on sax.\n\n“Moonshine Freeze” has so much going on. A great bass line, echoing harmonics on the lead guitar and Kate’s gentle chugging rhythm guitar. The drums are a cool shuffle. It’s such an intriguing song, especially with Kate’s cool vocal delivery. And then there’s the backing vocals singing in a round. It’s fantastic. The horns are a nice touch, too.\n\n“Hotter Colder” sways with a wonderful rhythm guitar melody and some great lead guitar lines from the guitarist hiding in the back. I love the intermittent oohs from the various singers. The two saxes also sound great here too. The song is capped off with awesome bursts of buzzy guitars at the end of the song.\n\n[READ: November 5, 2017] Cucumber Quest 1\n\nCucumber Quest was (is?) a webcomic. This book was originally published (via Kickstarter?) back in 2012. It is now getting a more formal release from First Second (I don’t know if there are any changes in the book).\n\nThe book opens with a monster delivering a sphere to an evil queen: “This makes lucky 7, one more and the world will know the meaning of terror.”\n\nThe next page is the Prologue. Cucumber is a bunny and he is about to go off to the school of his dreams–Puffington’s Academy for the Magically Gifted and/or Incredibly Wealthy). He is nervous but his younger sister says you’re the biggest nerd I know, you’ll be fine.\n\nBut then they get a letter from Cuco’s dad (who was in he room when the queen revealed her plan). He is concerned about world domination and he says hat only Cucumber can put an end to it. But Cuco is going to school tomorrow! Plus he’s a real coward. Meanwhile his sister Almond is pretty exited to go on this quest herself.\n\nThere’s some really funny jokes in this section\n\nMom: “Almond sweetheart, you know it’s too dangerous for you.” Cuco: “But not for me?” Mom: “Well, Almond IS your little sister.”\n\nAs the chapter ends, “Why does dad find a way to ruin everything?”\n\nThe Dream Oracle finds him, she is protector of this world and has important information about his quest. The Oracle then confirms that little sisters aren’t legendary heroes.

It is just Gonzalez on heavily echoed guitar and vocals and his unmoving, emotion-free longtime bandmate Phillip Tubbs on spare keyboards.\n\nAlthough there’s not a lot to these songs, the melodies are truly terrific.\n\nThe three songs sound very similar–unmistakably them.\n\n“K.,” the opening track to this Tiny Desk Concert – and the opening cut to the band’s eight year-long awaited debut album – is especially memorable. The lyrics are simple and easy to remember: “Kristen, come right back/I’ve been waiting for you to slip back in bed/When you light the candle.”\n\nAmazingly, for almost half of each song, there are no keyboards, just the guitar. So that extra, gentle wash of music sounds huge. “Apocalypse” has the lovely swooning chorus of “you’ve been locked in here forever and you just can’t say goodbye” and “Nothing’s Gonna Hurt You Baby” follows that same pretty structure (although it’s my least favorite of the three). With the minimalism:\n\neach note and each word seems to count for more … and the office environment of the Tiny Desk Concert [may work better] than in a club, where just the chatter of a crowd can drown out this gentle music.\n\n[READ: November 1, 2017] The Hunting Accident\n\nI loved this book. Everything about it was utterly fantastic. The story, the way it was told, and the amazing drawings of Landis Blair\n\nThe book opens on a snowy day in Chicago in 1959. A boy whose mother has just died has moved from sunny California to miserable Chicago to live with his blind father, Matt. The boy had lived with his mother since he was four (his mother’s mother thought that his father was a trouble and that they needed to get away from him). So he barely knew his father. And now it was time to find out everything about the man. Like, first off, how he became blind.\n\nThe father told the boy all about the hunting accident. He and his friends were screwing around, playing by the train tracks. They were having fun scaring each other. All the kids were afraid of real life bogeymen Leopold & Loeb local murderers. The boys even believed they found the pipe in which Leopold & Loeb stuffed their victim.\n\nThere’s even little reminder of the crime:\n\nIn 1924, two wealthy educated men kidnapped and brutally murdered Bobby Franks, a 14-year-old neighbor…just for the thrill of it… to see if they could commit “the perfect crime.”\n\nAnyhow, the boys had a shotgun and heard a deer. When one of those boys shot at the deer he missed and his Charlie’s father right in the face.\n\nSoon Charlie must learn what it is like to live with a blind man–how everything must be in the exact same place.\n\nCharlie’s father writes all the time (on a braille machine). He writes about morality and poetry. He quotes Dante. And soon, Charlie’s dad was having Charlie help with the writing–by proofing and checking things (Charlie learned a lot at the same time).\n\nCharlie’s grandmother also said that Chicago was dangerous, but not for Charlie. He got along fine. He even made friends with Steve Garza–the coolest kid in the neighborhood. Garza was so cool he bummed cigarettes off of Charlie (from his dad–even though Matt, counted them and got mad about it).\n\nCharlie also began getting involved in extracurricular activities–he loved tap dancing and tried the cello–two things his father appreciated. But soon Steve and his buddy started pressuring Charlie. He “left” his tap shoes at the park, he stopped playing cello and he got involved in some ugly things.\n\nGarza wanted to join the JPs–a local mob related gang. But he was too young so he started the Junior JPs and soon enough that involved theft. And since they were dumb, they were easily caught.\n\nAnd that’s when the truth comes out.\n\nI was already hooked into the story and then I was blown away. Charlie’s dad did not lose his sight in a hunting accident. Charlie is furious that his dad lied to him.\n\nGarza convinces Charlie to head for Canada to avoid the cops. (The third guy has already gotten there and is at a free-love commune or something). Charlie is prepared to drive them both (he’s the one with the car after all). And then his dad tells him the whole truth, which gets Charlie to pause.\n\nThe rest of the book cover’s Matt’s story.\n\nHe was poor in 193os Chicago and got mixed up with the wrong crowd. His did go blind from a gun shot, but it was a very different setting–and it led to prison.\n\nOn the day he got to prison, the same prison that Leopold and Loeb were in, Richard Loeb was killed in the shower. This left Leopold alone.\n\nCharlie asks if he met Leopold. And Charlie’s dad says that Nathan Leopold is the reason for his divorce. What?\n\nTurns out hat not only did Charlie’s dad know Nathan Leopold. He was Leopold’s cell mate. Since Loeb was killed there was concern that Leopold might be next. And since Matt was blind, they were put together under watch.\n\nAfter Matt was out of prison, Leopold sent him a letter (in braille) which the grandmother intercepted. Matt had never told anyone he was in jail, and that made Matt a Liar.\n\nMatt was miserable in jail. He couldn’t see, his father was disappointed in him and he had nothing to live for. He just wanted to die, but that was pretty hard to do under constant supervision. We see daily life for a blind man in jail–food stolen all the time and knocking his cellmate’s things over.\n\nLeopold was angry and bitter and wanted nothing to do with a blind man. But soon, Leopold began talking to Matt about the life of the mind–something he realized that Matt lived all the time. Because he couldn’t see everything was in his mind. Leopold used to hold educational lessons in the library at the jail. He also showed Matt how to make a Glim Box (a way to use a spinning coin to light a fire to light cigarettes).\n\nMatt tells Leopold that he has no family. Meanwhile, Leopold’s dad visits every two weeks (the visits are awkward and uncomfortable but are a way for Leopold to get things from the outside).\n\nSoon, Leopold is trying to convince Matt to learn Braille. Why? well, this gave opportunity for Leopold to learn it to and thereafter he could read after lights out. (Leopold was a master of many languages and picked up braille easily).\n\nAnd that’s when Leopold persuaded Matt to read Dante’s Inferno.\n\nThe story of Matt’s imprisonment jumps back to the present where Charlie is still annoyed with his father, but is really interested in the story. Especially when he leans that his father almost committed suicide there.\n\nI loved the philosophical ideas in the story–they way the book interprets both Plato and Dante for the everyman . I loved that Matt’s story runs throughout the book and I loved the whole idea of a blind man helping one of the most notorious criminals of he 20th century.\n\nThis story is thought-provoking and exciting at the same time.\n\nThe only thing that I feel was left out–did Charlie wind up going to jail or not? It’s never addressed.\n\nThe end of the story and that final two-page spread are just breathtaking.\n\nI also love that David L. Carlson more or less found out about this amazing true story by accident.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nSOUNDTRACK: TYLER, THE CREATOR-Tiny Desk Concert #683 (December 11, 2017).\n\nI’ve never really liked Tyler, The Creator. My experience with him and his Odd Future posse was that they were just too … everything. Violent, misogynist, homophobic, everything. Well, it has been a decade or so since he first came to my awareness and he has matured considerably.\n\nThe change was noted in the blurb:\n\nFlower Boy, Tyler’s latest album, is much like this Tiny Desk performance; a surprising departure from the expected. Four albums in, he has matured as a producer, rapper and human being. Often equated to hip-hop’s class clown, the 26-year-old peels back his own mask of immaturity to reveal a young adult grappling with anxiety, fear and uncertainty of self.\n\nWhich is not to say that he’s not vulgar, because he is, but he is also a lot of fun. And he made a point of having fun at this Tiny Desk Concert:\n\nTyler, The Creator’s Tiny Desk performance was a first for many reasons. It was the Los Angeles rapper’s first time performing at our offices, but moreover, it was the Tiny Desk’s first nighttime performance, a special request from Tyler and his team in order to professionally light the “stage” themselves. Members of Tyler’s lighting crew came to the office a day before to set it up, eventually bathing him and his band in shades of fuchsia, orange and blue — one for each song — during the early evening show.\n\n“Boredom” opens with the room bathed in blue as the two backing singers Kaye Fox and Kiandra Richardson sing a pretty melody of “boredom got a new best friend” as the keys by Jaret Landon, drums by Dalton Hodo and upright bass (!) by Dré Pinckney plays a mellow jam. After a minute and a half, Tyler comes out and starts rapping. I like when he adds his 70s sounding synth over the backing vocals.\n\nThey have a lengthy jam at the end with the backing singers getting a chance: “make something up its your turn.” Then he asks a woman in the audience with a phone: “whats your name?” “Nana.” he sings, “Nana in this mother fucker… you can call me.”\n\nI assume he has a cold (his voice sounds very cool and gravelly) as he “sips this nasty ass tea. Can’t believe people choose to drink this shit.”\n\nAs “See You Again” starts, he plays a new synth sound and the lights turn fuschia. Then he says, “I don’t know how many people are familiar with this song. If you wanna join in because you’re excited, feel free to join in because i like that shit. Then he points, “I know you three for sure you been saying every lyric. I appreciate you.”\n\nWhen it starts he says, “Excuse my voice. I can’t sing…. But I don’t fucking care because it feels good. Like a warm shower. I think.\n\nThe blurb notes that his warmth to the audience was genuine:\n\nAfter he was done, Tyler did something of a modified mic-drop, throwing his tambourine in celebration of what he and his band had accomplished. Always one to stay casually connected with his fans, Tyler made time — nearly an hour after the performance was done — to pose for photos, sign merch and crack jokes with (and on) everyone around him.\n\n“Glitter” features a lot more rapping and some great backing vocals. I assume that the backing singers will become known and their voices are great.\n\nWhen the set ends, the screen goes black. But wait, there’s more.\n\nHe says, “I guess we’re done (people clap). Wait, wait (getting angry-sounding, like Dave Chapelle) I’m about to talk. I wanna talk. Shit.\n\nSomeone asks, “Whats on your mind.” He says, “Thank you. I respect that. People don’t take the time to ask that. To listen.” He has everyone go around and introduce themselves and give a fun fact. The whole set is a lot of fun.\n\n[READ: October 20, 2017] Demon Vol. 3\n\nVolume 3 of this series continues the thread of Jimmy Yee. Jimmy is a demon who–when his host body is killed–will instantly jump into the nearest living body. He and his daughter Sweetpea have been alive for hundreds of years and have seen and done everything. They have unlimited money and resources and have slept and killed their way around the world several time over.\n\nBy Chapter 15 Jimmy runs into that guy from the earlier books with the square hair and mustache (Hunter). Hunter wants to kill this demon so they get into a hilariously over the top fight sequence. Since nether one of them can die, they jump out of building and crash into things–jumping into the next body and the next. The carnage is incredible.

Enough has been said about how they don’t exactly seem like they should fit but how well they do.\n\nI’ve said that I wish the album rocked a bit harder, but really it’s live that this duo is terrific. We saw them a few months back and it was a lot of fun.\n\nBut this Tiny Desk Concert is twice as fun because of how unserious they are. As the blurb says:\n\nPut your love of perfection outside the office door and come in for some office fun. This collaboration between Philadelphia’s Kurt Vile and Melbourne’s Courtney Barnett is more about newfound friends poking jabs, goofing around and having fun with words than reaching any new musical heights. It’s a much welcome injection of humor in the world of rock music and if you’ve heard their collaborative album Lotta Sea Lice, you’ll find this Tiny Desk performance musically even more casual. It’s akin to hearing friends play after a few afternoon beers, which is kind of what happened. (We actually had to page folks in the building hoping for some brew and were quite surprised at what the NPR staff had stashed in the fridge.)\n\nThey start with their hit “Over Everything.” It sounds great even if they are very casual about it. There’s lot of laughing between them, and their harmonies sound fantastic. After the song Kurt pops open a beer (clearly his second).\n\nCourtney apologies for all the tuning they’ll have to do. “Good thing I don’t have all 12 strings.”\n\nI love the sentiments and melodies of “Continental Breakfast”\n\nThen Bob says, “Thanks to everyone who donated beer to make this concert possible.” Courtney: “Yea, that happened very quickly. Everyone has one beer hidden in their desk here.”\n\nKurt takes off his denim jacket and says, “Don’t mind my muscle shirt–I was working out.”\n\nKurt and Courtney tend to bring out the adolescence in one another, inspiring Kurt to pick out a song he wrote when he was roughly fourteen called “Blue Cheese” about, well, I’m not sure. But lines like, “I didn’t mean to cough on her/Forgot to add the fabric softener,” just make me laugh; and in 2017, in a deeply serious political landscape, I find that quite refreshing.\n\nThey joke their way through “Blue Cheese,” as you must. He plays a harmonica solo and admits, “that was terrible.” When it’s over he says, “I wrote that song when I was 12.”\n\nThe final song “Let It Go,” has Courtney on lead while Kurt sings some nice high backing vocals.\n\nThe whole show is light-hearted and fun, but they never make a mockery of the music. It’s just a casual good time.\n\n[READ: November 1, 2017] Spinning\n\nThis is a memoir about competitive ice skating. But it is much more than that.\n\nInterestingly, I found the intensity of the ice skating competitions to be a perfectly satisfying and compelling story in and of itself. So at first, when Walden began adding other things from her life, I wasn’t sure if these (rather important) aspects of her life could be shoehorned into a story about ice skating.\n\nBut it soon became apparent that the skating, which was such a big part of her life, was in fact, a rather small part of her life.\n\nOf course, the fact that Walden is 21 and stopped skating when she was 18 shows just how big a part of her life the skating was.

Two of the three (why not all three?) brothers even wear Christmas sweaters.\n\nThey play three Christmas songs. Two originals and one “traditional” medley.\n\nThe two originals are rocking, very piano heavy (the pianist does a LOT of sliding down the keyboard as they rock n toll out).\n\n“Finally, It’s Christmas” is fun and bouncy song that I imagine we’ll hear a lot next year.\n\n“To New Year’s Night” is a very conventional rock n roll song about a North Pole Party. The guitarist with his gruffer voice (and no sweater) sings this song about needing a toddy for hid body (since I think of Hasnon as being 8-12 years old (although they obviously aren’t), it’s weird to hear them singing about drinking. It’s a pretty standard rocker, they even quote “da do ron ron.” After rocking out, they comment “Can anyone saw ‘sweat”ers.” Since it is obviously not Christmastime.\n\nIt has been 20 years since their first Christmas record. So they decided it was time to do a new one. While they are talking Bob starts blowing snow all over them. This leads to them singing “Joy to the Mountain” an a capella mash up of “Joy to the World” and “Go Tell It On the Mountain.” They sin the melody in a non traditional way. Their harmonies are really good even if I don’t care for their delivery.\n\n2017 has been a pretty strange (mostly bad) year. I never would have guessed I’d be watching two Tiny Desk Concerts with Hanson (and more or less enjoying both of them).\n\n[READ: December 25, 2017] “A Chaparral Christmas Gift”\n\nOnce again, I have ordered The Short Story Advent Calendar.
