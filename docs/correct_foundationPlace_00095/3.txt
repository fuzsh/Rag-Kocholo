The Newcastle Quayside Centre is in a prestigious riverside location close to the River Tyne occupying three floors of a five-storey building with a glass front and modern interior. The views of the famous Tyne Bridge and recently built Millennium Bridge are stunning. The recently restored Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art is directly opposite, next to the Sage Gateshead performing arts and conference centre. The vibrant and energetic city of Newcastle is a modern, attractive and compact location with a strong identity where businesses prosper and people enjoy a quality of life that is second to none. This area is among the most successful in the UK for attracting investment from abroad and is already the preferred location of many Far Eastern and US companies entering the European market. Over 130 investors from 15 countries have chosen to locate in and around the city, joining a business community of over 17,000 companies.
