Taking medications is habitualised into everyday routines and practices, and is experienced in much the same way as other activities of daily living. For some, the work associated with medications has been relinquished (either partially or wholly) to others, minimising the burden experienced by the individual. Exceptions to this were found when disruptions to these steady states occurred, for example, following a new medical diagnosis with associated medication changes or a major life event.\n\nConclusion This study has shown a high level of acceptance of the work associated with medications among this group and trust in the prescribers to provide the most appropriate care.

        "text": "Habitualised management\n\nThe majority of participants had long since accepted the need for prescribed medications in a matter-of-fact way, without evidence of actively engaging with any significant decision making around this on a day-to-day basis. To a general question about their day so far, one participant responded: ‘Well I got up this morning, had a shower, got dressed and then I came through and had some toast and marmalade, I took my tablets, washed my breakfast things, put my little bit of washing out, run the sweeper over the floor and that was it.’(Maureen, Female [F])\n\nThis was a typical answer, suggesting that for many participants that were interviewed, medication use is an accepted and firmly embedded part of their autonomous daily routine, associated with minimal burden. One ubiquitous element in the descriptions of instrumental work was the presence of routines, whether these are daily, weekly, or monthly. The weekly visit to the pharmacy on a Friday was a fixed point in this participant’s routine: ‘Hair tomorrow, I go and get my hair done tomorrow, 9.30 am, then tablets on Friday. I go up for them to the chemist. They could deliver it, but I said, “Well, I never know when I’m gonna be in.” So, I’d rather go up for them myself. So, I get them on a Friday, when I get some ham or something and some rolls for when [daughter’s name] comes Saturday and we have our lunch.’(Mary, F)\n\nVarious strategies to optimise adherence were described, and demonstrated medication use was completely entrenched into daily routine practices reflecting that, for many participants, their lives were more generally characterised by domestic routines. For example, some placed medication in different locations around the house to be at hand when needed: ‘I’m usually setting my breakfast up about 8.00 am, and the washing up and putting the next day’s medication in the two little containers, one I take up to bed for the morning’s medication, and the night-time one I keep in there.’(Tony, M)\n\nThe importance of routine was reaffirmed when participants described lapses in adherence were most often associated with changes in their normal pattern of activity: ‘Say for instance on Sunday night there. I forgot to take them. No, Saturday night it must have been. With my son. We had been out all day and came in late at night. About 10.00 pm it was when we came in. I was so eager getting undressed and getting into bed after having a wash that I forgot to take my tablets. It’s just occasions like that when I might I forget you see.’(Jack, M)\n\nFor most participants much of the cognitive and emotional work involved in decision making relating to medication adherence had taken place in the past and generally no longer required further processing on a day-to-day basis. This is not to imply that participants were necessarily passive in their interest or understanding of medications. While this varied, some indicated a good medication literacy: ‘There are not so many now but the important, the immune system one, MMF [mycophenolate mofetil], I used to be on 250 mcg capsules morning and evening, and then [name of doctor] after tests, the antibodies that had been causing the encephalitis, I was having these encephalitis fits … Then they found 10 times the normal amount of this particular antibody so they put is [me] on that MMF.’(Tony, M)\n\nMany participants had taken medications (sometimes the same medications) for years and even in the absence of direct evidence of effectiveness, many of those interviewed were still strongly committed to taking their prescribed medications regularly. The motivation for ongoing medication adherence most commonly articulated was a trust in the medical professional prescribing the medication:\n\nI:‘You feel as though they’re helping you, the medications?’\n\nP:‘Well, they’re bound to be. They’re bound to be, [interviewer’s name], or I wouldn’t be getting them.’ (Jean, F)\n\nThis trust appeared to be based on a combination of the stated accepted expertise of the professionals (based on the symbolic capital of the prescribing clinicians), but also indicated implicitly by the lack of any adverse events or side effects mentioned expressly in the accounts: ‘It doesn’t worry me, because it’s only three things and I know it’s not doing me any harm. It’s for my own good. I just swallow them, full stop. I don’t even think. I just take them and get on with it.’(Jean, F)\n\nOnly a few participants described occasional incidents of swallowing problems and adverse effects.\n\nWhile the majority of the responders had reached a steady state in their medication management, this was not to suggest that no cognitive or emotional work was being undertaken. For most, there was still an implicit monitoring of effectiveness or side effects from medications by the participants. Some were content that their medications were beneficial, often citing their own longevity as proof, however, this seemed to vary by medication class and the availability of evidence on which to base these perceptions. For example, medication for analgesia was given as an example, where effectiveness could be easily monitored: ‘My taking the codeine and paracetamol, it doesn’t make things completely back to normal, but I think it helps. The rest of them, I probably don’t notice the difference. I know my blood pressure is normal, so I know the tablets are controlling that.’(Cath, F)\n\nI:‘Is there anything that you are able to do to ease the pain or to make your knees better?’\n\nP:‘I have ointments, but nothing seems to do any good. And I take ibuprofen tablets, but they don’t seem to help much there.’ (Margaret, F)\n\nFor longstanding difficulties associated with particular medication use, participants articulated the autonomous solutions they had derived in order to achieve an acceptable balance between the potential benefits of the medication and the negative impacts of adherence: ‘Occasionally I drop them off, but then I’m probably advised to restart them. I mean, the one for osteoporosis, the alendronic acid one, anybody who takes it will tell you, it’s a real misery. You aren’t supposed to lie down, or have anything to eat for half an hour before. The nurse might say, take it in the night, but you don’t want to be sitting up in the early morning, or the middle of the night. It really is a nuisance to take. The rest of the tablets you just take them and that’s that.’(Cath, F)\n\nParticipants appeared to derive comfort from the familiar routines and satisfaction from performing these routines competently, this role fulfilment may help to foster a positive sense of identity as well as demonstrating (and protecting) their autonomy, especially for participants who were growing more dependent in other areas of their lives.\n\nFor this group of the oldest old, as would be expected, previous practices relating to medication management had been challenging for some due to physical and/or cognitive decline. This meant relinquishing some of their autonomy over the maintenance of their health and had to call on their social capital to fulfil the task of medication management:\n\nI:‘Are there things that are difficult for you nowadays to go on holiday?’\n\nP:‘Oh, yes. It’s awkward for medication. [Daughter’s name]’s used to it but I get quite mixed up with that, checking it before and keeping it in order while we’re away.’ (Tony, M)\n\nImportance for research and practice\n\nAs stated above, the data presented here was generated through qualitative interviews intended to explore participants’ day-to-day experiences. Medication optimisation was not the sole focus of the interviews. Further research would benefit from considering more specifically, and in more detail, the interaction between older people, their specific (multiple) medications, and their primary care practitioners. This could address important issues relating to medication reviews, the appropriateness of medications, and safe autonomy relating to medication practices at home.\n\nFindings from this study provide insights that may be of help to clinicians in approaching patient-centred discussions with those from the oldest old cohort, through a greater understanding of the range of experiences they are likely to encounter among this population group. The study found that, for many participants in this cohort, there was an unquestioning acceptance of medications and a great deal of trust in prescribing clinicians. Policy documentation has been lacking in guidance for clinicians around helping these supporting parties manage regimens on behalf of older people. It is important to note that for this age group the greatest burden from medication use happens when a disruption occurs; support in terms of information provision, regular review, and follow-up should be provided to minimise the impact of disruptions.\n\nGiven the international focus of deprescribing and reducing inappropriate polypharmacy28 this study has several important policy implications. Structured medication reviews are incorporated into routine clinical practice, with many pharmacists now specifically employed to optimise medications in older people. This study’s findings suggest that medication reviews should be tailored to the needs of the individual, and a standardised approach for older people may not be appropriate, especially among nonagenarians. The desired level of patient involvement in decision making about medications should also be acknowledged. Indeed, any approach to reduce inappropriate medication in older people should focus on their clinical and physical, as well as their social and psychological, needs.29 Tools such as STOPP/START,30 which are used to identify potential inappropriate medication in older people, are helpful in this regard, but should not be solely used as a way to reduce or stop medication. This study has shown that participants continued to take their medication because they thought they were ‘bound to be’ helping. The timing of medication review for this cohort may also be important: in addition to having a medication review over a defined time period, a medication review could also be triggered by any significant change in prescribing (for example, initiating a new medication) or life event for the patient.\n\nCentral to the success of a shared decision-making approach is an understanding of how individuals experience and respond to their medications alongside a sense of their desired level of involvement in decision making about their medications. This study has provided insights into how nonagenarians interact with their medications. It has shown a high level of acceptance of the work of medication management among this group and trust in the prescribers to provide the most appropriate care. This suggests that any rationalisation of medications must build on this trust and be presented as personalised, evidence-based care."
