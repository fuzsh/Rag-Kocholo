        "text": "Our Path, Our Promise\n\nThe Healey Education Foundation grew from faith and business savvy. Robert T. Healey Sr. established the Foundation in 2004 to bring sound business principles to the challenges of revitalizing Catholic Schools. Since then, we've grown to serve more than 200 elementary and high schools across 10 dioceses in Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.\n\nAs business thinkers and change agents, we advocate for and advise on strategies with a strong record of success.\n\nOur partner dioceses and schools have proven the value of top-down leadership, local control and empowered laity. They have embraced best practices in enrollment management and building a culture of philanthropy. They have reimagined and relaunched schools that are mission driven, financially accountable and committed to sustainable change.\n\nWhen new challenges surface, we will continue to consider, refine and share new approaches. We won’t rest until our work, multiplied across schools, dioceses and regions, extends the numerous benefits of a Catholic education to as many children as possible."
