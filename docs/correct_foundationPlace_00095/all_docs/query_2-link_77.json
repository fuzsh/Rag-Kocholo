Our organization was founded in 2012 after the tragic death of Sage Capozzi as a result of a fatal overdose. Our mission is to offer support, guidance, and resources to all people who have been affected by substance use while also advocating for people who use drugs (PWUD) by facilitating trainings, educating the public, and ending the stigma about PWUD and people in recovery.\n\nSage’s Army employs a team of Certified Recovery Specialists and Certified Family Recovery Specialists who have specialized training through the Pennsylvania Certification Board and who have lived experience as people who self-identify as a person in recovery and/or a family member of someone who uses/used drugs. With empathy, compassion, experience, and knowledge, our incredible team provides direct one-on-one peer support to PWUD, people in recovery, and their family members/loved ones by providing support, resources, and a safe recovery environment to enhance the participant’s journey of recovery and wellness.\n\nOur Recovery Centers in Greensburg and Irwin support multiple pathways of recovery by facilitating and hosting a variety of support groups and meetings, such as, All Recovery Meetings, SMART Recovery Meetings, 12-Step Meetings, Family Support Groups, Faith-based Groups, and Grief Groups. Sage’s Army also provides a HelpLine for members of the community that is operated by volunteers and staff members who provide support, resources, and referrals to treatment providers in the region for all levels of care. Our staff provide educational trainings, attend outreach events, facilitate Naloxone trainings, and advocate for person-first language throughout the region."
