        "text": "Our mission at Sage Therapeutics is to pioneer solutions to deliver life-changing brain health medicines, so that every person can thrive. We believe that it is time to usher in a new era in how to think about and treat brain health disorders. It starts with our commitment to maternal mental health and our role in bringing the only FDA-approved treatments for postpartum depression to market.\n\nThrough our pioneering science, we aim to address unmet needs of other brain health disorders, including essential tremor and cognitive impairment associated with certain neurodegenerative diseases. Integrating the patient and care partner perspectives into every aspect of our work, from research to commercialization, helps accelerate our impact.\n\nWhere possible, Sage seeks to support the work of scientists, researchers, and community-based organizations aligned with our mission with select grants, sponsorships, and other funding opportunities. Funding requests must follow Sage policies and procedures, as well as all applicable laws, regulations, and industry codes. Sage will not support requests from organizations that discriminate on the basis of age, political affiliation, race, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability, sexual orientation, or religious beliefs.\n\nThe following information provides more context regarding the types of funding requests Sage will consider and is most likely to accept. While we appreciate each request we receive, we cannot support every application for funding. All decisions are final."
