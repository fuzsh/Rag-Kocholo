        "text": "Lost items will be held at the Del Mar Foundation tent at the front of the concert area until band intermission. After intermission, the items will be handed over to the Del Mar Lifeguards and held at the main Lifeguard Tower at 17th Street on the beach. They can be reached the night of the event or next day at (858)755-1556.\n\nConcertgoers may put out blankets and chairs starting at 8 AM the morning of the Summer Twilight Concert. Tarps are not permitted as they can cause significant damage to the grass and prevent fair access to others. Blankets and towels cannot exceed 10 feet x 10 feet in size. There is no policing of the park so personal items are left at your own risk. If you bring a chair, low back beach chairs are encouraged as they do not block the view of attendees behind you.\n\nWe ask that you do not take rocks from the beach to weight your blankets. Our experience is that the rocks end up in the park, which adds an additional chore for our hardworking volunteers to clean up.\n\nAs a volunteer organization, we do not have the resources to seek bands. As a matter of fact, the tendency is for us to have more bands available than dates and resources permit us to present. If you know of a band, they may submit their name in accordance with our band submission procedure which follows:\n\nBands interested in being considered are welcome to send promo materials (CDs, band information) for consideration. Send all materials and media to:\n\nSummer Twilight Concerts Committee\n\nDel Mar Foundation\n\nAttn: Bob Gans\n\nP.O. Box 2913\n\nDel Mar, CA\n\n92014-0377\n\nThe City of Del Mar rules pertaining to dogs state that dogs are allowed at Powerhouse Park year round as long as they are leashed. Due to the large crowds attending the Summer Twilight Concerts, we hope that you will decide to leave your dogs at home for the evening.\n\nThere is no designated parking for Summer Twilight Concerts. You can park on available street parking and LAZ Parking offers paid parking across the street in the Seagrove Park Lot. Metered parking is also available under the L’Auberge Hotel for $3.00 per hour. Enter from 15th St., west of Camino del Mar and just east of the Post Office. Free parking is available in the Civic Center parking garage. Enter off of 11th or 10th Streets. You may also use the loading zone at the park to drop off your passengers and supplies before parking your car. Alternative modes of transportation including walking, biking, and rideshare services, are strongly advised. Rideshare companies shall use either loading zones, the designated rideshare area along the east side of the 1600 block of Coast Boulevard, or the downtown area, for drop-off and pick-up."
