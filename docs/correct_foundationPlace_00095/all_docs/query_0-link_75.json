Initiatives to reduce carbon footprints across business: With the awareness about reducing the harmful environmental impacts of business operations rising by the day, companies all over the world are trying their best to adopt various initiatives to make themselves green. Over the years, the Sage Group has also tried to make concerted efforts in order to reduce its carbon footprints across businesses through different initiatives and programmes. In the financial reporting year of 2019, the group projected significant progress including the initiative of increasing the use of bioethanol as fuel for business travel. Moreover, considering business travel contribute to 50.1% of the company’s total CO2 emissions, Sage Group has taken strides to encourage sustainable travel practices by reducing business travel.\n\n2. Investments in multiple energy reduction opportunities like low energy consuming technologies: With surge in the middle-class segment of the ever-growing population, the greatest environmental impact is originating from overconsumption of resources, most of which are exhaustible. To deal with this problem, companies are either adopting methodologies to lower their energy consumption or are turning towards renewable sourcing methods. Some of the initiatives adopted by the Sage Group include investments in newer technologies including laptops and workstations that consume comparatively lower energy, taking full advantage of energy reduction opportunities that include chiller improvements and building management system technologies, and moving corporate buildings to more energy efficient locations. Moreover, the group has shifted to renewable sourcing contracts with suppliers, for its operations in countries like Brazil, India and Portugal."
