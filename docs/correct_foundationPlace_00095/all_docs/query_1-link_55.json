Transcriptome data suggest that the interaction of srpk3 and ttn.1 in zebrafish occurs at a post-transcriptional level. We propose that digenic inheritance of deleterious changes impacting both the protein kinase SRPK3 and the giant muscle protein titin causes a skeletal myopathy and might serve as a model for other genetic diseases. Digenic inheritance of deleterious variants in serine/arginine protein kinase 3 (SRPK3) and titin (TTN) leads to a progressive early onset skeletal muscle myopathy.

        "text": "SRPK3 variants alone do not explain disease manifestation\n\nIn our cohort of 2,170 exome datasets from patients with neuromuscular disease, we identified five males (of 1,170) hemizygous for deleterious variants in the X-linked SRPK3 gene. Through international collaborations, we expanded the collection to a total of 33 patients with myopathy (31 males and two females, from 25 families) carrying deleterious variants in SRPK3. The majority (64%) were high-impact variants (stop gain, frameshift and splicing; Table 1). RNA analysis of splice variants showed abnormal mRNA splicing (Extended Data Fig. 1), expected to lead to nonsense-mediated decay, and SRPK3 mRNA counts per million (CPM) in three individuals with truncating variants was significantly lower than controls (−1.981 log fold change, P = 7.106 × 10−11; Extended Data Fig. 2). All missense variants were located in one of SRPK3’s kinase domains (Extended Data Fig. 3a) and were predicted to be deleterious (Table 1). 3D modeling anticipated restriction of the backbone conformation or disruption of the helical structure, causing instability and reduced catalytic activity (Extended Data Fig. 3b). All but one of the SRPK3 variants were absent among 76,702 control males from gnomAD (v2.1.1; https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/)18. The two manifesting female carriers in family Y (YIII:4 and YIII:5) showed skewed X-inactivation in lymphocytes, which could explain their phenotypes. Segregation analyses (in 20 families) showed that SRPK3 variants were inherited from an unaffected mother, with none being de novo, and were present in all affected male siblings. However, SRPK3 variants did not cosegregate with the disease as nine unaffected males from seven families (KII:2, LII:2, QII:1, VII:2/3/4, WIII:1, YIV:1 and ZIII:2) also carried the familial SRPK3 variants (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1).\n\nWe then noted that, in two of our extended SRPK3 pedigrees (families M and Z; Fig. 1b), some family members presented with isolated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In both families, the DCM was associated with a dominantly inherited heterozygous truncating variant in TTN —a new frameshift variant in exon 326 (p.Asp28805Metfs*6) in family M, and a stop-gain variant (p.Arg16095*), previously reported in association with DCM19, in family Z. In these families, the patients with myopathy also presented with DCM and carried the familial ‘cardiac’ TTN variant. Interestingly, the myopathic phenotype (in patients MIII:3, ZIII:4, ZIII:7 and ZIV:1) only manifested when the SRPK3 variant was present in combination with the TTN variant (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1).\n\nTaking this into account, we reassessed our myopathy families and screened them for TTN variants. All the index cases, in addition to the SRPK3 variants, carried a heterozygous variant in the TTN gene. The vast majority (84%) were TTN truncating variants (TTNtv), and all were absent, or extremely rare, in the control population (Table 1). No variant clustering was observed (Extended Data Fig. 4). Segregation analyses showed that the myopathy manifested only if both the SRPK3 and TTN variants were inherited together, but not when either variant was present in isolation (Fig. 1c). This was also the case for the two manifesting female carriers in family Y (YIII:4 and YIII:5), as they too carried a new deleterious heterozygous TTN variant. In contrast, females with cosegregating SRPK3 and TTN variants but who had random X-inactivation were unaffected (that is, TI:2, UI:2, XII:2 and YII:2). The exception to this was RI:2, an unaffected 72-year-old female with cosegregating SRPK3 and TTN variants whose fully inactivated chromosome (chr) X was confirmed to carry the SRPK3 deleterious allele. Also unaffected was individual ZII:5, a female SRPK3 carrier showing a fully skewed X-inactivation pattern (3:97) but no TTN variant (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 1).\n\nSRPK3/TTN cases present with a slowly progressive myopathy\n\nIndividuals with cosegregating SPRK3/TTN variants presented with a relatively homogenous phenotype and clinical course. Disease onset was in childhood or earlier (30/33), with poor motor performance. The disease was slowly progressive (23/33), yet all but four patients were ambulatory at the last assessment. The mean age of patients was 32 years (range: 1–77 years). The pattern of weakness was predominantly proximal and axial, affecting the lower more than the upper limbs. Respiratory compromise was present in 14 individuals, four of whom required noninvasive nocturnal ventilation. Three patients had DCM; however, this could be attributed to their TTNtv11. All patients had normal or mildly elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, except RII:1, who had consistently elevated CK values (2,400:U/l). Less frequent features and deep-phenotype descriptions are listed in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. Histopathology for 23 skeletal muscle biopsies showed myopathic changes with increased internalized nuclei (22/23), core-like structures (15/23) and type I fiber predominance (19/23). Electron microscopy (EM) images confirmed the presence of core-like areas and revealed myofibrillar disorganization with Z-line streaming and branching of myofibrils (Fig. 2). Axial T1-weighted muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the lower limbs in four patients showed a similar selective pattern of muscle pathology with prominent fatty transformation of the subscapularis, gluteus maximus, adductor longus, vasti, hamstrings, medial gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. The sartorius, gracilis and adductor magnus muscles were well preserved (Fig. 2).\n\nAbnormal titin expression in patients with SRPK3/TTN myopathy\n\nBased on the available genetic data, no evident copy number variants (CNVs) or variants in the triplicated region of the TTN gene were found in trans with the heterozygous TTN variant. However, to further exclude compound heterozygosity for a TTN defect abolishing the titin C-terminal, we used western blotting to detect the small C-terminal titin proteolytic fragments (13, 15 and 18 kDa in size)20. Muscle biopsy protein lysates of patients DII:1, LII:1, XIII:1 and YII:3 showed a normal titin C-terminal pattern (at least from one allele), ruling out a biallelic C-terminal titinopathy (Fig. 3a). Antibodies against the N-terminus and distal I-band of titin showed that the full-length titin band was present in a TTNtv carrier (DI:1) but appeared to be missing or reduced in the patients with SRPK3/TTN myopathy (CII:2, XIII:1 and YII:3), suggesting that the normal full-length expression of both TTN alleles was affected (Fig. 3b,c). In keeping with this, transcriptome analysis of patients LII:1, DII:1 and YII:3 showed that TTN mRNA expression (as length-normalized CPM) was significantly lower than controls (−1.450 log fold change, P = 8.015 × 10−4; Extended Data Fig. 5).\n\nTTN truncating variants are enriched in the SRPK3 cohort\n\nTo elucidate whether the co-occurrence of SRPK3 and TTN variants observed in our patients could be due to chance, we compared our findings with both control and other disease populations. We focused exclusively on TTNtv, as TTN missense variants are too abundant and would pose a challenge for correct pathogenicity ascertainment. First, we interrogated the gnomAD database and estimated that TTNtv were present at ~1% in the control population, in keeping with previous reports21. Next, we analyzed three cohorts of genetically confirmed limb-girdle muscular dystrophies: LGMD-R1 (n = 170), LGMD-R2 (n = 94) and LGMD-R12 (n = 56). While 21 of the 25 SRPK3 families carried a TTNtv (84%), we found five heterozygous TTNtv in the patients with LGMD-R1 (2.94%; P = 6.13 × 10−19), one in the patients with LGMD-R2 (1.06%; P = 9.18 × 10−17) and two in the patients with LGMD-R12 (3.5%, P = 4.89 × 10−12; Extended Data Fig. 6). We then queried the existence of healthy male individuals carrying high-impact variants in both SRPK3 and TTN in the control population of exomes from gnomAD. As of September 2023, there are six hemizygous males (of 76,702) carrying five truncating variants in SRPK3 canonical transcript (p.Ser30Ter, p.Lys139GlnfsTer10, c.475+1G>A, p.Arg373Ter and p.Lys516SerfsTer17; ENSG00000184343; https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/gene). Manual interrogation of the exome data of these six males disclosed that none of them carried a TTNtv, highlighting that co-occurring truncating hemizygous SRPK3 and heterozygous TTN variants, as seen in our patients, is a very unusual event (P = 0.00232; Supplementary Note). Finally, we used statistical modeling to quantify the degree to which our observations supported the co-inheritance of causal SRPK3 and TTN variants as opposed to any other plausible explanation. The best-fitting model involves digenic inheritance, with both SRPK3 and TTN variants required for disease manifestation. The likelihood of data is at least 1010 times greater than under any other model, including a model where just one gene (that is, SRPK3 or TTN) is operating, but with reduced penetrance (Supplementary Note).\n\nZebrafish double mutants replicate the SRPK3/TTN human myopathy\n\nWe next tested whether our observations for SRPK3 and TTN could be replicated in an animal model using srpk3 and ttn zebrafish mutant lines—the srpk3sa18907 mutation causes aberrant splicing, leading to partial retention of intron 15 or loss of exon 15 (Extended Data Fig. 7); ttn.1sa5562 is a premature stop codon in exon 19 of 214 of the ttn.1 gene. Zebrafish have two paralogs for the human TTN gene, ttn.1 and ttn.2, with ttn.1 exclusively affecting skeletal muscle function22 (Extended Data Fig. 8). We created double carrier zebrafish of srpk3sa18907 and ttn.1sa5562 (srpk3+/sa18907; ttn.1+/sa5562, henceforth referred to as srpk3+/−; ttn.1+/−) and used sibling in-crosses to produce offspring carrying all possible genotype combinations, including srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/− (henceforth referred to as double mutant). Zebrafish single (srpk3+/+; ttn.1+/−) and double (srpk3+/−; ttn.1+/−) heterozygous mutant larvae at 5 dpf (days postfertilization; Fig. 4b,f) had no phenotype and were indistinguishable from the wild-type (WT; Fig. 4a,e). Double-mutant zebrafish (srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/−) at first appeared to be morphologically normal (including the heart), but they were not able to fill the swim bladder and therefore did not survive to adulthood. Compared to WT fish (Fig. 4a,e), the muscle fiber structure was largely lost in the ttn-null fish (both srpk3+/+; ttn.1−/− and srpk3−/−; ttn.1−/−; Extended Data Fig. 8), but was only very mildly affected in the srpk3-null fish (srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/+; Fig. 4c, g). In accordance with the findings in our patients with myopathy, however, the loss of one ttn.1 WT allele in the srpk3-null zebrafish resulted in severe muscle pathology (srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/−; Fig. 4d,h), as visualized by whole mount staining of actin filaments and Z-band markers. Although myotomes were properly formed, muscle fibers were distorted and disintegrated to a variable extent. EM of the mutant zebrafish showed that the sarcomere appeared unaffected in heterozygous ttn.1 (srpk3+/+; ttn.1+/−; Fig. 3r), comparable to WT zebrafish (Fig. 4q). The srpk3-null zebrafish (srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/+; Fig. 4s) showed mildly disorganized myofibrils; however, most sarcomeres appeared well defined. The double-mutant fish (srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/−; Fig. 4t) displayed pronounced disruption of the sarcomere structure, including the myofibrils, A-band, I-band, H-zone and M-line. For further characterization, we isolated zebrafish myofibers and immunostained them with a monoclonal anti-titin antibody. This antibody labeled the T11 peptide found at the I-band to A-band transition. We observed, by confocal imaging, that srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/− double mutants (Fig. 4l,p) developed disorganized sarcomeres compared both to ttn.1 heterozygous (srpk3+/+; ttn.1+/−; Fig. 4j,n) and srpk3-null mutants (srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/+; Fig. 4k,o). This disruption of the myofibers was also illustrated by a substantial reduction of titin labeling and disturbance of the transverse labeling pattern of α-actinin. These results were consistent with the I-band and A-band alterations observed in the EM images.\n\nTranscriptome analysis highlights disruption of contractile structures in zebrafish double mutants\n\nZebrafish transcriptome data showed that ttn.1 mRNA expression is equally reduced in the heterozygous (srpk3+/+; ttn.1+/−) and the double mutants (srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/−) when compared to WT ttn.1 (Extended Data Fig. 9a). This suggests that the severe reduction of titin protein expression observed by immunostaining exclusively in the double mutants (srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/−; Fig. 4l) was due to aberrant post-transcriptional or post-translational processing. In contrast, srpk3 mRNA levels were upregulated in srpk3−/− mutants (both srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/+ and srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/−; Extended Data Fig. 9b), likely as a compensatory effect. When analyzing the global transcriptome profile of the different genotypes, we observed that there were 128 genes differentially expressed (DE) in the heterozygous ttn (srpk3+/+; ttn.1+/−) zebrafish. The number of DE genes in the srpk3-null mutant (srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/+) was 572, and this increased to 794 in the double mutant (srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/−; Fig. 5a). A Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis to identify the differential pathways involved showed that the transcriptional changes in srpk3-null (srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/+) zebrafish and the double mutant (srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/) were similar. Expression of genes involved in myofibril and actin cytoskeletal organization and skeletal muscle tissue development was affected. There was also an inflammatory signal in both genotypes (Fig. 5b,c, Extended Data Fig. 10 and Supplementary Data). Unexpectedly, the heterozygous ttn.1 mutant (srpk3+/+; ttn.1+/−), despite being fully viable and having no morphological phenotype, also showed a clear inflammatory signature, but no dysregulation of muscle genes (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Data). In addition, given the role of SRPK3 in RNA processing and maturation, we queried for generalized aberrant splicing patterns, but we did not detect any signal for this.\n\nTtn variants in Srpk3 knockout (KO) mouse\n\nWe then interrogated the genetic background of the Srpk3 KO mouse described in ref. 16 to establish whether its resulting muscle phenotype was also due to the cosegregation of Srpk3 and a previously unrevealed Ttn variant. Using genome sequencing, we found the following three Ttn changes in the Srpk3 KO mouse model: two missense (chr2:76946873C>T; p.Ala1395Val and chr2:76969682C>T; p.Ala394Val) and one synonymous variant (chr2:76969699T>C; p.Ser388Ser), also present in the WT 129s6/SvEvTAC background (http://www.informatics.jax.org/snp/). We currently do not know whether these variants contribute to the observed phenotype.\n\nSRPK3 in vitro phosphorylates RNA-binding motif 20 (RBM20), a splicing factor involved in TTN mRNA regulation\n\nProtein expression analysis of muscle biopsy lysates from our patients with SRPK3/TTN myopathy suggested that SRPK3 deficiency might affect normal full-length titin expression. This was later supported by the reduction in titin labeling seen in the zebrafish double-mutant (srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/−) model. SRPK3 could be directly involved in titin phosphorylation or more likely, given the regulatory role of serine/arginine (SR) kinases, in TTN mRNA processing by targeting an SR-splicing regulator. RBM20 is a muscle-specific splicing factor involved in TTN alternative splicing23. Its cellular localization and activity are dependent on the phosphorylation of its RSRSP stretch within the arginine/serine-rich region24. We hypothesized that RBM20 might be a phosphorylation substrate of SRPK3 and the mediating link between SRPK3 and titin, as previously shown for SRPK1 (ref. 25). To investigate this, we cotransfected an RBM20 reporter (RBM20517–664-V5) into 293T cells with or without a GFP-SRPK3 construct. The presence of GFP-SRPK3 led to RBM20517–664-V5 hyperphosphorylation, as indicated by a mobility shift of the reporter (Fig. 6a). This mobility shift was abolished after treatment with lambda phosphatase. This suggests that SRPK3 may directly phosphorylate the TTN-specific splicing factor, RBM20. Based on this finding, we interrogated the transcriptome data for the zebrafish mutants and found that the zebrafish rbm20 ortholog shows increased expression upon loss of srpk3 (both srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/+ and srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/−; Fig. 6b).\n\nWe identified 40 males (from 25 families) carrying hemizygous deleterious variants in the X-linked SRPK3 gene. Of those, only the 31 patients who also carried cosegregating heterozygous TTN variants presented with a myopathy. Their unaffected brothers carried either the SRPK3 or the TTN variant, but never both. For the female individuals, a mild presentation was observed only in the two sisters from family Y who carried both the TTN and the X-linked SRPK3 variants and showed skewed X-inactivation. However, a female SRPK3 carrier displaying skewed X-inactivation, but no TTN variant, was unaffected. The remaining females with SRPK3/TTN variants but random X-inactivation were also unaffected. While numbers are small, this might suggest that, for SRPK3 carrier females to present a myopathic phenotype, both skewed X-inactivation and a deleterious TTN variant must co-occur, in line with what is observed in male patients.\n\nDisease and control population data indicated that the co-occurrence of SRPK3 and TTN variants was not fortuitous, because TTNtv variants were significantly more common in patients with SRPK3/TTN myopathy than in other genetically diagnosed muscular dystrophy cohorts, and were notably absent in the ‘SRPK3-null’ males present in the control population. These findings, together with the statistical modeling, strongly support the digenic inheritance of deleterious SRPK3 and TTN variants in patients with myopathy. While digenic inheritance has been widely recognized in association with, for example, deafness26,27 and cardiovascular conditions28, only a handful of digenic cases have been reported in the neuromuscular field. These are, however, mostly single cases29,30, with only SQSTM1/TIA1 multisystem proteinopathy (MPS)31 and D4Z4/SMCHD1 facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (FSHD2; ref. 32) being replicated in independent cohorts. To our knowledge, this is the first report of true digenic inheritance involving a protein kinase in a sizeable cohort of skeletal myopathy patients.\n\nThe zebrafish model, where the srpk3−/−; ttn.1+/− double-mutant embryos showed a severe muscle phenotype not observed in the srpk3−/− or ttn.1+/− embryos alone, replicated our findings. In addition, the model allowed us to better understand the muscle pathology, highlighting the disorganization of the sarcomere and the reduction in titin protein expression. Transcriptome analysis showed that compared to WT, ttn.1 mRNA expression levels were similarly reduced in the single ttn.1+/− heterozygous mutant, both with or without srpk3-null background, suggesting that post-transcriptional (or post-translational) processing must be responsible for the abnormally expressed protein. Likewise, differential gene expression analysis demonstrated that, despite severe morphological consequences, losing one ttn.1 WT allele in srpk3-null mutants only had a minor effect on the gene expression profile. This suggests that the interaction of srpk3 and ttn.1 in zebrafish is at a post-transcriptional level.\n\nThe in vitro phosphorylation assay supported a connection between SRPK3 and the TTN-splicing factor RBM20. Increased mRNA counts of the rbm20 zebrafish ortholog were observed exclusively in the srpk3-null mutants, possibly the result of a positive feedback loop due to srpk3-related phosphorylation deficiency of rbm20. Similar upregulation was seen in a knock-in RBM20 mouse model (Rbm20S637A) where phosphorylation was impaired33. While in our hands the srpk3-null 5-dpf zebrafish appeared normal with almost unaffected fiber structure, at the time of submission an adult KO model was shown to present agenesis of cerebellar structures and abnormal behavior34, suggesting srpk3 may also be involved in neural development.\n\nMost of the TTN variants identified in our SRPK3 cohort were truncating, yet novel missense variants, predicted deleterious, were also found. While more challenging to ascertain35, TTN missense changes have been shown to be disease-causing in homozygosity or compound heterozygosity with a TTNtv or other missense change35,36,37. In heterozygosity, in particular in exons 344 and 364, TTN missense changes are associated with dominant hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure (HMERF)10,11 and tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD)7,9. Three of the TTNtv variants seen in our cohort were previously reported. Two of these (p.Arg16095* and p.Arg31056*) had been associated with DCM (ref. 19 and Leiden Open Variation Database, https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/TTN) and were identified in two (of the three) patients with SRPK3/TTN myopathy also presenting with DCM (families B and Z). The third variant (p.Arg8494*) had been reported in a patient with an unsolved muscle disease38 who was analyzed through a panel of 35 neuromuscular disease genes. Given our findings, it would be appropriate to screen the SRPK3 gene in such unsolved patients with sporadic myopathy and a heterozygous TTNtv.\n\nNotably, none of the family members who carried only the heterozygous TTN variant (n = 16) showed any signs of skeletal muscle disease, in keeping with what has been largely accepted for heterozygous TTNtv6,8,20. Notwithstanding, it has been reported recently that heterozygous TTNtv in the A-band may be causative of dominant distal myopathy39. When no evident dominant family history exists, however, it would be worth considering whether a more complex molecular pathomechanism might be responsible for these presentations.\n\nN-terminal blots of a TTNtv carrier showed expression of full-length titin, yet when similar variants were present in combination with SRPK3 variants, only smaller or weaker bands seemed to be detected. Similarly, reduction of titin immunolabeling was observed in the heterozygous ttn.1 zebrafish model but only in an srpk3-null background. The epitope for the anti-titin antibody is located in region T11 (around exon 102), downstream of the premature stop codon generated by the ttn.1sa5562 mutation (chr9:42861631T>G, exon 19); therefore, only WT titin would have been detected by immunostaining. This suggests that the loss of SRPK3 negatively affects the WT TTN copy, either by directly altering protein structure or conformation, or more likely, by post-transcriptional processing (possibly through RBM20 regulation), resulting in loss of antibody recognition. We propose that the myopathy observed in the patients with SRPK3/TTN myopathy, and replicated in the zebrafish model, is the result of a titin dosage effect, whereby a single ‘faulty copy’ of TTN is not sufficient to cause disease, but the additional deficiency in SRPK3 activity, affecting TTN transcriptional regulation and, in turn, normal full-length titin expression, tilts the scale toward pathology.\n\nWe have shown that, in vitro, SRPK3 phosphorylates at least one of the serine residues present in the transfected RBM20517–664-V5 construct, corresponding to the RNA-recognition motif and RS-rich domains and including the RSRSP stretch. RSRSP phosphorylation is critical for RBM20 localization and activity24,33. RBM20 is a muscle-specific SR-splicing factor, primarily involved in I-band TTN alternative splicing, and known to regulate the ratio of N2BA:N2B cardiac isoforms40. Additional splicing targets include other sarcomeric genes (for example, OBSCN and LDB3), genes essential for calcium handling (for example, CAMKD2 and RYR2) and even neuronal regulation (for example, SEMA6D)41. Mutations in RBM20 have been associated with highly penetrant and severe dominant DCM in humans and other mammals41,42. Most frequently, these are gain-of-function missense changes in the highly conserved RSRPS region leading to cytoplasmic retention and aberrant ribonucleoprotein granules24,43,44. Conversely, loss-of-function (LoF) mutations outside the RSRSP stretch result in RBM20 haploinsufficiency and aberrant splicing of target genes, such as TTN, but not mislocalization45,46. This is in line with population data showing RBM20 to be highly LoF intolerant (pLI = 0.99)18. We manually interrogated the exome data of healthy RBM20 LoF carriers and, interestingly, no cosegregating TTNtv were identified, just as seen with the SRPK3 LoF hemizygotes.\n\nIt has been postulated that RBM20-DCM is more severe than TTN-DCM and thus cannot be solely explained by aberrant TTN-splicing regulation47. Notably, all but three of the SRPK3/TTN families did not present cardiac involvement. Speculatively, abnormal RBM20 phosphorylation by SRPK3 in the heart would be overcome by ubiquitously expressed kinases, as shown recently for cdc2-like kinases (CLKs) and protein kinase B (AKTs)25 and supported by our in vitro phosphorylation assay. Although RBM20 has not yet been associated with skeletal muscle disease, it has been shown to be DE across different skeletal muscles, where it regulates Z-band and M-band TTN splicing48. In addition, TTN RBM20-mediated splicing regulation is not only skeletal muscle-type specific but also affected by hormone levels49 and circadian rhythm50. Overall, this highlights that RBM20-related pathology is complex and might be caused by the aberrant splicing of target genes through different tissue-specific genomic and nongenomic signaling pathways.\n\nIt is not clear whether the SRPK3-related myopathy is caused by the same pathomechanism in mice and humans. This type of discrepancy is not unique, and mouse models do not always recapitulate the human pathology, as seen, for example, in dystroglycanopathies51,52. Nevertheless, it is still possible that the identified Ttn variants might have an effect on the Srpk3 KO mouse line. Interestingly, Srpk3 overexpression in mice results in cardiomyopathy16, not seen in the KO model. Like RBM20, SRPKs exhibit strong spatiotemporal expression profiles13,14,15,16, and their subcellular localization is regulated by their own phosphorylation53 and acetylation54, suggesting that these kinases are involved in tightly controlled and fine-tuned pathways at different developmental stages and in response to external signals17,55. While their role in mRNA regulation is well studied13, it has recently been shown that SRPKs are also involved in ubiquitin signaling56.\n\nWe propose that the digenic inheritance of genes involved in post-translational processing and their direct or indirect targets57 may be a model for conditions thus far thought to be monogenic58. Similar digenic inheritance models might also explain incomplete penetrance, such as recently described in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (ref. 59). In fact, SRPK3 has previously been suggested as a causative gene in patients with X-linked spinocerebellar ataxia60 and intellectual disability34,61. Notably, it has been proposed that abnormal SRPK-mediated phosphorylation of an E3 ubiquitin ligase might disrupt neurodevelopmental regulation45,56. In addition, haploinsufficiency of the splicing factor SRSF1, a well-known SRPK3 target16, has been newly shown to cause a developmental disorder with intellectual disability62. Based on the findings presented here, it is conceivable that defective or absent phosphorylation activity of this kinase, in combination with a second deficient downstream target gene, could result in these, as well as other, disease phenotypes.\n\nNo statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size. The experiments were not randomized, and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.\n\nEthics statements\n\nAll clinical information and biological material used in this collaborative study were collected after obtaining written informed consent from the patients or their legal guardians. Each sequencing study was approved by the relevant health research authorities (Supplementary Note). Zebrafish were maintained in accordance with UK Home Office regulations, UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, under project licenses 70/7606 and P597E5E82. All animal work was reviewed by The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Ethical Review Committee.\n\nGenetic analysis\n\nGenomic DNA from affected individuals was subjected to NGS and analyzed by applying standard filtering criteria (Supplementary Note). SRPK3 and TTN variants were confirmed in the probands and assessed in available family members using Sanger sequencing. Deleteriousness of missense variants was predicted by Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD, v1.6) scores (https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/)64. NGS data were, when possible, analyzed for CNVs in the TTN gene and its triplicated region visually inspected. Variants in SRPK3 were annotated based on the coding DNA reference sequence NM_014370 and transcript ENST00000370101. Variants in TTN were annotated based on NG 011618.3 or LRG 391 and inferred-complete variant-IC (NM 001267550.1 or ENST00000589042.5), usually referred to as the titin meta-transcript.\n\nThree-dimensional modeling of SRPK3 variants\n\nFor the structure-based analysis of SRPK3 variants, a homology model was built using YASARA65 (v15.4.10) with an SRPK1 structural template (5MYV, chain C).\n\nSRPK3 and TTN gene expression and allelic balance analysis\n\nRNA sequencing from muscle biopsies was performed at the Broad Institute Genomics Platform via the Tru-Seq Strand-Specific Large Insert RNA Sequencing protocol, at high coverage (50 M pairs). This included plating, poly-A selection and strand-specific cDNA synthesis, library preparation (450–550 bp insert size) and sequencing (101 bp paired reads). STAR-aligned BAMs were analyzed for gene expression and allelic balance. For gene expression analysis, the featureCounts66 utility from the Subread package (v2.0.0) was used to count reads mapping to annotated genes across the human genome. Resultant counts were processed with edgeR67 (v3.28.1), undergoing normalization with the calcNormFactors function followed by testing for differential gene expression between patient and control samples using the (two-sided) exactTest function68. Results for SRPK3 and TTN were examined, and CPM values, normalized by gene length, were obtained with the cpm function and plotted.\n\nAllelic balance for regions of TTN with evidence of heterozygosity was assessed using the AllelicImbalance69 (v1.24.0) software package, which counts reads at every heterozygous position and applies a chi-square test to determine the statistical significance of any deviation from the expected ratio of reads at each position.\n\nMuscle biopsy and MRI analysis\n\nMuscle biopsies were analyzed following standard histological techniques for light and electron microscopy as part of the diagnostic workup of patients in accredited pathology laboratories. Muscle MRIs were obtained on standard diagnostic scanners using axial T1-weighted scans.\n\nTitin immunoanalysis\n\nWestern blotting of titin C-terminal fragments was carried out as previously described20, using two different antibodies raised against the C-terminal M10 Ig domain of titin, rabbit polyclonal M10-1 (ref. 9; 1:300) and mouse monoclonal 11-4-3 (ref. 20; 1:150). For high molecular weight titin western blotting, antibody Z1Z2 (1:1,500, N-terminal, TTN-1; Myomedix) and F146.9B9 (1:1,000, distal I-band titin; Enzo Life Sciences) were used. Snap-frozen muscle biopsies were homogenized in a sample buffer containing 8 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 10% SDS, 0.05 M Tris base and 10% glycerol supplemented with 10% β-mercaptoethanol and heated at 60 °C for 15 min. The soluble fraction was recovered after centrifugation. Equal amounts of muscle protein were loaded into vertical 1% agarose gels, and the run was performed at +8 °C, using 12.5 mA per gel for 6–7 h. The proteins were detected in-gel using SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen) or blotted to PVDF membranes using CAPS buffer in a Trans-Blot Turbo System with 40 V for 5 h.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThree cohorts of patients with genetically confirmed forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, namely LGMD-R1 (n = 170), LGMD-R2 (n = 94) and LGMD-R12 (n = 56) caused by recessive mutations in the CAPN3, DYSF and ANO5 genes, respectively, were identified through the MYO–SEQ Project70. The number of TTNtvs (that is, stop gain, splice sites and frameshift) was counted in each disease control population. A Fisher’s test (two-sided, with no adjustment for multiple comparisons), following the proposal of Agresti and Coull71 to add two successes and two failures to each data set was calculated.\n\nSimilar statistical analysis was implemented for the comparison between the number of TTNtvs found in affected and unaffected males carrying a truncating SRPK3 variant (referred to as ‘SRPK3-null males’; Supplementary Note). For the statistical modeling, the MLINK (v5.10) program from the LINKAGE72 package and PSEUDOMARKER73,74 (v2.0) were used. For details, see Supplementary Note.\n\nZebrafish husbandry and genotyping\n\nZebrafish were maintained in accordance with UK Home Office regulations, UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, under project licenses 70/7606 and P597E5E82. All animal work was reviewed by The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Ethical Review Committee. Zebrafish were maintained at 23.5 °C on a 14 h light/10 h dark cycle. The mutant lines srpk3sa18907 and ttn.1sa5562 were generated by the Zebrafish Mutation Project75. The allele srpk3sa18907 is an essential splice site mutation affecting the donor site of exon 15, and ttn.1sa5562 is a premature stop codon (zebrafish assembly GRCz11 chr9:42861631T>G) in exon 19 of 214, corresponding to amino acid p.Leu1570. Genotyping was carried out as previously described76. Filamentous actin and α-actinin were stained in genotyped larvae at 5 dpf using Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Invitrogen, A12379; 1:80) and mouse monoclonal anti-α-actinin (Sigma, A7811; 1:200).\n\nZebrafish transcriptomics\n\nIn total, 5-dpf larvae were collected as six pools of three embryos per genotype to minimize any differences due to biological variance. A previously described protocol for single embryo RNA extraction77 was optimized for use with pools of zebrafish larvae. Samples were lysed in 110 μl RLT buffer (RNeasy kit, Qiagen) containing 1.1 μl of 14.3 M β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). The lysate was allowed to bind to 450 μl of Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) for 15 min. The tubes were left on a magnet (Invitrogen) until the solutions cleared, and the supernatant was then removed without disturbing the beads. While still on the magnet, the beads were washed three times with 70% ethanol and allowed to dry for 20 min. Total nucleic acid was eluted from the beads following the manufacturer’s instructions and treated with DNase I (New England Biolabs, M0303L). RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific NanoDrop One Microvolume UV–Vis Spectrophotometer), RNA integrity numbers were checked using a Bioanalyzer (2100 Bioanalyzer System) and sequencing libraries were made using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina.\n\nLibraries were pooled and sequenced on one lane of NovaSeq 6000 SP PE150 (between 14 million and 29 million reads per sample). RNA-seq data have been deposited in the ArrayExpress database at EMBL-EBI (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) under accession E-MTAB-12934. Sequencing data were assessed using FastQC (v0.11.9; https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and aligned to the GRCz11 reference genome using STAR78 (v2.7.3a). Read counts per gene were generated by STAR and used as input for differential expression analysis using the R package DESeq2 (v1.28.1)79. The following model was used for DESeq2: ~Genotype, modeling counts as a function of the genotype. Genes with an adjusted P value of <0.05 using a two-sided Wald test with Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment63 for multiple testing were considered to be DE. Gene sets were analyzed using topGO80 (v2.38.1), and the resulting GO enrichments were visualized using the ClueGO (v2.5.9) plugin for Cytoscape81 (v3.9.1). For analysis of gene expression changes and visualization of data, R (v4.2.0; R Core Team; https://www.r-project.org/) was used, together with the tidyverse82 package (v1.3.1). Differential alternative splicing events were analyzed using rMATS83 (v4.1.2).\n\nMyofiber immunofluorescence\n\nImmunofluorescence staining of zebrafish skeletal myofibers was performed by adapting a protocol previously described84 (Supplementary Note). Myofibers were incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, washed in 1x Phosphate-Buffered Saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), then incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11001; 1:500) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11037; 1:250) for 1 h at room temperature. Further washing in PBST was performed before mounting with Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). Primary antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti-sarcomeric α-actinin (Cell Signaling Technologies, 3134; 1:25) and mouse monoclonal anti-titin (Merck, T9030; 1:200). Digital images were captured with Newcastle University Bioimaging Unit’s Nikon A1R point scanning confocal microscope (Nikon) using Nikon Elements AR (v5.21.03).\n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM)\n\nGenotyped zebrafish embryos (5 dpf) were fixed with glutaraldehyde (2%) fixative in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 (2BScientific, 30450003-1) at 4 °C. Processing for TEM was performed by Newcastle University Electron Microscopy Research Services. Ultrathin sections were stained with heavy metal salts (uranyl acetate and lead citrate). Sections were imaged on a Hitachi HT7800 120 kV TEM using an EMSIS CMOS Xarosa high-resolution camera (Hitachi) and Radius software (v2.0).\n\nMouse whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis\n\nDNA from Srpk3-null (KO)16 and WT (129s6/SvEvTAC background) mice were subjected to WGS at deCODE Genetics. Fastq files were mapped using the BBmap suite (v38.69) against the mouse Ttn gene sequence (USCS, GRCm38/mm10). Variants (with a read frequency of >20%) were called using Varscan 2 (v2.3.7) for each sample, and BCFTools (v1.9) was used to merge all samples by group (WT and KO). The output variants present in the WT and KO groups were annotated using the Variant Effect Predictor tool (Ensembl, https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html, https://www.ensembl.org/Tools/VEP). Variants were compared to the reference 129s6/SvEvTAC background.\n\nConstructs\n\nTo create the RBM20517–664-V5 reporter, the cDNA fragment coding amino acids 517–664 of mouse RBM20 was cloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO in frame with C-terminal V5 and His6 tags using the pcDNA3.1 Directional TOPO Expression Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, K490001). The pcDNA5-FRT/TO-GFP-SRPK3 construct (DU 25699), expressing N-terminally GFP human SRPK3, was obtained from the Medical Research Council Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit Reagents and Services (University of Dundee, Scotland).\n\nPhosphorylation assay\n\nThe 293T cells were transfected with the RBM20517–664-V5 reporter construct together with either GFP-SRPK3 or an empty vector (pcDNA5/TO), collected after 2 d of expression and frozen at −80 °C. The cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in 1× NEBuffer Pack for Protein Metallophosphatases (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 0.01% Brij 35; New England Biolabs) supplemented with 1 mM MnCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1× Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 4 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 4 mM sodium orthovanadate and 2 mM sodium fluoride. Insoluble material was pelleted at 4 °C for 15 min at 15,700g. The supernatants were divided into three reactions (U, untreated; N, no phosphatase; P, phosphatase) and combined 1:1 with dephosphorylation buffer (1× NEBuffer pack for protein metallophosphatases, 1 mM MnCl2) alone (U, N) or with NEB lambda protein phosphatase (P; final concentration 6,667 units ml−1). The U reactions were immediately mixed with 2× SDS sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C, whereas the N and P reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C before SDS sample preparation. The samples were run in standard SDS–PAGE in 4–20% TGX minigels (Bio-Rad), transferred on nitrocellulose membranes and stained with antibodies against the V5 tag (Thermo Fisher Scientific, R960-25, SV5-Pk1; 1:5,000) and GFP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-11122; 1:5,000).\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article."
