        "text": "Sage Gateshead is an international home for music and musical discovery located in the North East of England.\n\nSage Gateshead offers an extensive Join In and Make Music programme that enables everyone of every age or ability to become involved in music, from pre-natal ‘Musical Bumps’ classes for pregnant women up to our over 50s ‘Silvers’ programme. Join In and Make Music includes music-making for families and early years, schools, vocal and instrumental learning, community music and further and higher education. In addition to the work in the building itself, 70% of the work of the programme takes place outside of the venue and in the communities. Some examples include The Big Sing (which brings together over 2,000 pupils in a memorable Hall One performance every year) CoMusica (which works with young people who find themselves out of education or employment), and our Young Musicians Programme which offers audition based and non-auditioned based programmes for those aged 5 – 19.\n\nWe also work with individuals who have special education needs and/or disabilities as well as Looked After Children and the adults in their lives, through music making\n\nWorking with the University of Sunderland, University of Newcastle and Gateshead College, Sage Gateshead delivers further and higher education programmes in Jazz, Popular and Commercial Music; Community Music; and Folk and Traditional Music."
