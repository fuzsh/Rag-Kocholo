        "text": "Newcastle-based software solutions giant Sage Group plc has launched its first bond issue to raise £350m.\n\nThe FTSE 100 listed tech business is aiming to raise the funding in the benchmark market to refinance debt as well as use money within the company for general uses.\n\nThe company, which is reported to have started investor meetings at the start of this week, said it has launched a 10-year bond offering – due February 2031 – of £350m with joint bookrunners Bank of American Securities, JP Morgan and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets.\n\nThe Great Park business, which is set to move to Cobalt Business Park this year, is tapping into the bond market for the first time as a new way to source funding, and it will use part of the funds to refinance its debt.\n\nIn last year’s results for the year ended September 30 2020, the group said its debt is sourced from a syndicated multi-currency revolving credit facility, a syndicated term loan and US private placements.\n\nThe term loan of £200m was put in place in September 2019 and expires in September 2022, having been extended by a year in September 2020. It is understood it will repay it with some of the proceeds from the new issue.\n\nAt the start of this week, ratings agency S&P announced it had awarded Sage a BBB+ rating and stable outlook, saying it expects the company to achieve solid growth on the back of new customer wins, the migration of existing customers to the cloud and its high recurring revenue. After getting the rating, shares in Sage rose over 2%.\n\nIn a stock market statement announcing the debut bond issue, Sage said: “The offering is expected to settle on 25 February 2021 subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions.\n\n“The notes issue extends the maturity of the group’s debt portfolio and diversifies its funding sources.\n\n“Sage intends to use the proceeds to repay its existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.\n\n“Sage has been rated BBB+ (stable) by S&P.\n\n“Application will be made for the notes to be admitted to the official list of the Financial Conduct Authority and to be admitted to trading on the regulated market of the London Stock Exchange.\"\n\nSage’s financial results for the year ending September 30 showed revenue at the firm fell over the period from £1.936bn in 2019 to £1.903bn in 2020, but the company hailed strong organic recurring revenue figures, which increased 8.5% to £1.592bn. More than 90% of the business’s revenue is now recurring revenue."
