        "text": "Tech giant Sage has confirmed it is moving its international head office out of Newcastle’s Great Park.\n\nThe company has been based at Great Park for 15 years but the business will soon leave the site and move to Cobalt Business Park instead.\n\nSage has said it will invest £40m in the North East hub over the next three years, creating jobs and improving its customer experience. It has set itself an 18-month deadline to move its staff from Great Park to Cobalt.\n\nSpeaking to The Journal, Sage’s UK and Ireland managing director Sabby Gill said that the company had considered all of the local business parks before selecting Cobalt. The new office will provide staff with collaboration spaces and breakout spaces where teams can work together.\n\nMr Gill said: “We weighed up the options of what Great Park gives us today and what Cobalt gives us around our vision of being a SaaS company, which requires more collaboration space and an environment where employees can get together. It’s a space we want to build. It’s the gold standard that we have put in place everywhere else globally but we have never been able to do in the UK, until now.\n\n“The move and change was never a cost exercise. It is all about making sure we had the right space and the right environment for our employees to fulfil our vision of being a great SaaS company. It wasn’t the cheapest option, it was the right option.”\n\nOver the next three years the tech giant is planning to fill 500 jobs in product engineering, data science, support and sales. This includes around 200 open positions in the Newcastle, with the remainder being made in Manchester, Reading and London.\n\nMr Gill was unable to say at this point how many of the jobs would be newly created and how many of the rolls were being filled due to the natural churn at the business. However, he emphasised that the hires are being made to grow the business.\n\nThe investment will also include £1.6m to be spent on providing staff with training, as well as employing 150 apprentices and graduates.\n\nBy late 2020 nearly 2,000 employees will work at Sage’s new office at Cobalt Business Park.\n\nSage is now beginning a period of consultation with its staff at Great Park, which has been designed to ease their transition to the firm’s new global headquarters.\n\nStaff are now being consulted on a range of support packages that are being designed to cater for each individual's needs as they move to the new site. This will include support around transport, working processes, flexible working, and other incentives.\n\nMr Gill added: \"I don't believe one incentive will address everyone's issues. We are working with each manager and have a framework of things we can offer to help each employee.\"\n\nSage CEO Steve Hare said: “The UK’s tech sector is fast becoming a centre of global excellence, and Sage is particularly proud to be part of this, and to have such a significant home in the North East.\n\n“Our colleagues are one of our main strengths, and I’m pleased that this investment will create a great experience for them and a fantastic environment for innovation– both are crucial to our vision of becoming a great SaaS company.”\n\nIt is unknown what the future of Sage’s existing head office will be. The tech firm currently owns the land and building, but has said it is focusing on transferring its staff to Cobalt over making a decision on Great Park.\n\nNorth of Tyne mayor Jamie Driscoll said: “This really is excellent news. Sage is a global business and a global leader in technology. To invest another £40m in a new world-class technology hub is a great vote of confidence in the North of Tyne. There’s also an apprenticeship programme to give youngsters a route into well paid work.\n\n“Sage is one of our flagship home-grown businesses. They’re a real driver of innovation and skills in the North of Tyne. And as a digital company, Sage will be key in delivering prosperity in the modern, low-carbon economy, based on good quality skilled jobs.”"
