        "text": "The SAGE Foundation was founded on some of the same principles that SAGE exemplifies in its day-to-day work at our venues: integrity, partnership, respect, community, and education. These aren’t just buzzwords to us. They’re values that we consider when serving clients, as well as our teams. We value our Team Members, and they represent our company and execute our values and programs at every venue, every day. We’re reinvesting SAGE’s success in our business with The SAGE Foundation because, ultimately, our people are our business.\n\nThe SAGE Foundation offers support to qualified SAGE Team Members through two different grants. The SAGE Family Grant is a disaster relief fund that provides temporary financial relief for Team Members facing hardships that arise out of “qualified disasters.” The SAGE Scholars Grant provides support to eligible dependents of SAGE Team Members to assist in their pursuit of education following high school.\n\nIf you’d like to support the foundation and your fellow Team Members, you can donate to The SAGE Foundation via\n\nPayPal\n\nor by mailing a check, made payable to “SAGE Foundation,” to the Home Office at 1402 York Road, Lutherville, MD 21093."
