        "text": "A YEAR LIKE NO OTHER\n\nNewcastle United has the power to bring a city and a region together and Newcastle United Foundation is integral in making that happen.\n\nSince 2008, the official charity of Newcastle United has been changing lives for the better, helping people improve their physical and mental health, become more employable and encouraging them to reach their potential.\n\nAnd our vision is to create a united community full of pride, passion and potential. Newcastle has remained committed to supporting disadvantaged communities across the North East\n\nRead on to see how we have empowered communities to feel hope during an extraordinary 12 months where we all needed a little extra happiness.\n\nThank you to Parkdean Resorts for sponsoring our annual review. We also thank Newcastle United Football Club, the Premier League and our other generous funders for their ongoing support.\n\nThank you to Parkdean Resorts for sponsoring our 2019/20 annual review\n\nParkdean Resorts, the UK’s leading holiday park operator, is pleased to be building on its partnership with the Newcastle United Foundation by, once again, providing support throughout 2020/21.\n\nThe business owns and operates 67 unique holiday parks at the heart of unrivalled rural and coastal communities across the UK who, in turn, rely on the business for employment, continued investment and a commitment to cherish the uniqueness of each community. With an impressive national footprint, it is proud to have a particularly strong presence in the North East, with five holiday parks and a Central Support office located there.\n\nThe challenges presented by 2020 saw community links become even more important. During the period of lockdown, park teams donated tens of thousands of pounds of essential supplies to local food banks, nearby schools and NHS medical facilities. The business also supported NHS key workers by providing more than 1,000 nights of free accommodation at four parks to over 50 key workers who were unable to stay in their homes during the lockdown period.\n\nParkdean Resorts is delighted to continue its long-standing support of the Newcastle United Foundation, which inclusively inspires countless communities across our region.\n\nWhen the first pandemic-related restrictions put life on hold for millions across the globe from April 2020, Newcastle United Foundation remained committed to supporting communities in the North East.\n\nWith the charity’s work impacted by lockdown, dozens of members of staff were happily redeployed from their usual roles to ensure those in need would still safely receive support. Children and young adults were at the heart of the Foundation’s coronavirus response, ensuring learning, physical activity and employment opportunities continued where possible.\n\nThe Foundation continue to support the development of Newcastle United Women to help achieve our ambition for the development of football across our region for women and girls. Highlights include:\n\nThe further development of the Lemington Football Centre to create a home for Newcastle United Women including fenced pitches via a grant from the Football Foundation and additional investment in the playing surface with the support of Newcastle United ground maintenance staff.\n\nWe agreed strategic partners including Newcastle City Council, Northumbria University, Arnold Clark and Vitality, supporting additional capacity for facilities, coaching and performance analysis, travel and financial investment."
