NSF GAGE provides the foundation and infrastructure to support research on every continent across a broad spectrum of geosciences, facilitated by data, engineering, education, and community services. The NSF GAGE Facility is committed to supporting and growing a diverse community of scientists and students, toward advancing science for a resilient society.\n\nNSF GAGE is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), NASA, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). NSF’s Earth Sciences Division (EAR) and Office of Polar Programs (OPP) fund facility support for PI geodesy research and GPS/GNSS networks around the world, including Greenland and Antarctica. NASA supports NSF GAGE operations of the Global GNSS Network (GGN) and the activities of the International GNSS Service (IGS) Central Bureau that make millimeter-level global geodesy possible. The USGS provides funding for maintenance of Volcano Hazards Program stations and for support of the ShakeAlert® Earthquake Early Warning System.\n\nNSF Seismological Facility for the Advancement of Geoscience (SAGE)\n\nNSF SAGE is a distributed, multi-user national facility operated by EarthScope Consortium providing state of-the-art seismic and related geophysical instrumentation and services to support research and education in the geosciences. This integrated set of facility capabilities enables advances in our understanding of Earth structure and dynamics, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and interactions between the solid Earth, hydrosphere, and atmosphere through the management and operation of:\n\nGlobal seismic networks that collect data continuously\n\nPortable seismic and magnetotelluric instrumentation for use in PI-driven and community experiments\n\nData management systems that collect, provide quality assurance, curate, and distribute open access geophysical data and data products\n\nEducation, workforce development, and public outreach programs that engage a wide variety of audiences, including groups historically underrepresented in the geosciences\n\nFacility Citations\n\nGovernance and Oversight"
