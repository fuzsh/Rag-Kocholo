        "text": "You will have seen my previous Linkedin comments over the last 12 months, written as a result of significant events in the UK with unexpected results, principally related to Brexit and Politics. My intention in this latest note is to highlight the most impactful aspects of our current thinking in relation to UK economics, politics, social behaviour and real estate (closing with a reminder of our position on Brexit).\n\nEconomics: Growth in the UK is slowing, consumers and businesses are nervous with regards the impact of Brexit and the outlook through the eyes of many is one of rising inflation and interest rates alongside a weak currency and general economic uncertainty. On a relative and absolute basis this is not an attractive platform for UK investment and it’s hard to argue against. However, I do believe that this negativity is based in the short term (c.2 years) and in the medium term (3-5 years) UK economic performance will be a lot more robust. This optimism is primarily because of my outlook with regards the Brexit outcome (see below), alongside my belief that likely economic underperformance will allay concerns over the level of domestic inflation and, as such, interest rates will remain low. In my opinion, the Bank of England will look more to GDP growth than it does to 2% CPI.\n\nPolitics: I have said before that I try hard not to let my personal party-political views colour my commentary. It is, of course, hard not to be biased or cast a vote out of self-interest, but choosing the best political leaders (available) in the interests of the UK is how most of us would say we view the intended workings of the democratic electoral system. I know there have been times when I have voted outside my comfort zone because I think change is needed or lessons need to be learned. For example, I am currently of the view that the general election outcome of a hung parliament is very possibly a good result for an easier won softer Brexit because of the need for a more cross-party debate and agreement. It may make other policies harder for the Government to enforce but our main goal must remain the relationship with the EU and increasingly with the rest of the world.\n\nNonetheless, watching the behaviour of certain Labour and Conservative Party MPs and listening to their rhetoric we must be aware that their goal will be to disrupt policy and process as much as possible. As for those at the top of those political parties, I don’t think it will ever again be a Corbyn vs May general election contest so there is more political personality change to come in the next few years – and despite all pre-election speculation it is now more likely that May is where that change will lie rather than Corbyn.\n\nAs a final speculative statement, it is not inconceivable that there will be increasing support (vocal at least) for a second Brexit referendum. In my opinion one or both of two events needs to occur for this to happen in reality. The first is a shift in attitude in the EU that would allow the UK to substantially achieve what David Cameron set out to negotiate in 2015 and ultimately led to the Brexit referendum, namely sovereignty of the UK (including immigration). The second would be the finalised Brexit Heads of Terms being materially different or worse than the voter could have reasonably anticipated. I don’t believe the House of Commons can decide alone to remain in the EU, having heard the voice of the majority, but they can decide to call for a second referendum. Unlikely but possible and perhaps this will become the Labour Party ‘cause’ if it decides its newly found popularity is on the wane.\n\nSocial Behaviour: Whether it is political, economic, technological, leisure or real estate there has been and will continue to be significant social change amongst us and it has been repeatedly misread. At Moorfield we spend a great deal of time debating social change and how we think it impacts on what we do in providing accommodation for others. The subject is so big that my intention is only to point out to you that we are aware. Some of the societal changes we are all experiencing are definitely for the good and some are definitely not (and of course some are neutral and simply for change’s sake) but ignoring is not an option.\n\nReal Estate: At the risk of repeating what you will have recently heard from us, I think I can put our current outlook and approach into a relatively small number of bullet points:\n\nWe believe we are in the mature stages of the real estate cycle.\n\nWe believe there is a value correction due in areas of the real estate market that are over-supplied or are experiencing record levels of rents and yields. We don’t believe this will come in the form of a real estate ‘crash’ but we have no intention of participating in any of these areas.\n\nWe believe there is an arbitrage opportunity in buying short term income and risk assets and selling stabilised long term income and lower risk assets.\n\nWe have very strong conviction that there are some systemically undersupplied areas of the real estate market that will continue with high occupancy and rental growth despite the real estate cycle.\n\nThe Brexit Outcome (as previously set out plus some minor updates):\n\nMedium term: it is our opinion that the UK will remain a safe haven for international investment capital for all the reasons we are familiar with. We also believe that the UK and the EU will need to reach an appropriate compromise on their relationship going forward, because we believe they effectively have to at some point – for the economic and social health of all those directly and indirectly involved (and many that have not as yet understood the likely global impact) and a softer rather than harder exit now appears more likely! Negotiations will take time, may well include transitional agreements and time extensions and will, no doubt, involve plenty of intermediate venom and vitriol magnified by the salivating media. However, the end result will likely be pros and cons for both sides of the divide but, we suspect, not materially worse going forward than at present, once the dust has settled. Wilful blindness on our part? Perhaps, but hindsight will have to be our judge on this.\n\nWe also believe that a UK unfettered by the ‘unelected eurocrats’ and free from imposed EU restrictions will be able to negotiate trade deals with economies that are faster growing than the EU – such as China, India, Canada, Japan, the US and more. The Election result has not materially changed our opinion on this medium term outlook, other than an expenditure policy versus the current austerity measures might see GDP growth benefit (at the cost of increased tax and debt).\n\nThe charts below show the growth in EU exports to the UK, while the UK has been growing its exports elsewhere – the EU is just as keen on a close trading relationship with the UK!\n\nExports to the EU have decreased from 61% in 1998 to 48% in 2016\n\nExports to the USA have increased from 12% in 1998 to 16% in 2016\n\nExports to Other Countries (Non-EU and Non-USA) have increased from 27% in 1998 to 36% in 2016\n\nImports from the EU have decreased from 57% in 1998 to 55% in 2016\n\nImports from the USA have decreased from 13% in 1998 to 8% in 2016\n\nImports from Other Countries (Non-EU and Non-US) have increased from 30% in 1998 to 36% in 2016\n\nUK Exports & Imports by Trading Group\n\nSource: Capital Economics\n\nShort term: it is our opinion that the UK negotiations with the EU and the reporting on it will cause concern, confusion and disruption. Not a comfortable environment for anyone, but one in which opportunity lies for investment funds such as ours that like short term weakness as long as it translates into a means to create medium (and longer) term value. The Election result has magnified this perspective and does not take away from the investment themes we are currently pursuing.\n\nLong term: it is our opinion that the UK may be better off out of the EU (and the Executive Committee of Moorfield all originally voted to remain!) for reasons that are much more about the EU and the Eurozone than they are about the UK or its reliance or role in the EU. We have no crystal ball of course and we are talking about the unpredictable world of politics rather than the world we more readily understand of business, real estate and finance – however, we can’t immediately see how the mechanics of the EU and eurozone can continue without some major changes.\n\nWe are told by the politicians that the answer to the broken experiment that is the eurozone lies in federalisation (i.e. greater monetary and fiscal union). But the voting public across the EU would appear to be pushing hard for greater nation-state independence. So how does that work? Have I not just described opposing forces? The bullet of a Le Pen victory has been dodged for the EU project but it’s a story far from over. Le Pen victory would have likely resulted in a disastrous event for the EU as an ‘in-out’ referendum similar to the one in the UK would have been called for (as it would have been if Wilders had triumphed in the Netherlands – and perhaps still will be if Grillo succeeds in Italy) and the result of the referendum(s) would be by no means predictable. President Macron and others seem to have recognised the need for change in the EU structure – but what change, what resultant impact and at what cost….short, medium and long term.\n\nAm I being too pessimistic about the EU and the Eurozone? Well, it is worth remembering that Europe, despite some recent GDP growth, has clearly not yet properly recovered from the effects of the GFC. Low growth, high unemployment and unrecognised losses are still present across the continent and many of the issues that were headlines a few years ago are likely to be so again in the future.\n\nThe Brits may be relentlessly snatching defeat from the jaws of victory on a number of political fronts currently but it could still prove to be the case that we have escaped the EU in a timely manner!\n\nHeadlines:\n\nHung Parliament\n\nConservatives stay as minority government (albeit with 43% of the national vote) but need Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland to get a majority in the House of Commons\n\nConservative Leadership election possible\n\nAnother General Election in the near future possible\n\nVery much a two party system again – at least for now\n\nBrexit continues but will be from a position perceived as weakened\n\nSofter Brexit more likely\n\nSNP sent a sharp message in Scotland\n\nAusterity and public spending become the focus.\n\nDon’t be complacent about the younger voters!\n\nComment:\n\nDemocracy has once again delivered a shock to the political system! Certainly aided by the employment of social media and those who use it (i.e. principally the younger voters) alongside one very effective and one shockingly ineffective campaign strategy. But what were the public voting on – not so much about Brexit I suggest (although a softer Brexit would appear preferred by the majority) but more about austerity and spending on public services and especially from the 18 -25 year olds. Had it been principally about Brexit, the Liberal Democrats (who were strongly opposed to Brexit) would have picked up many more votes, but instead the Country focused on only the two main parties, at least outside of Scotland. In Scotland, SNP were given a sharp reminder that their seemingly singular focus on independence and a second referendum was not being well received and this is going to cause a great deal of confusion for them as they have little else to differentiate their platform.\n\nI am going to work on the basis that our observations on the outcome of the General Election will need to come in at least two parts: (i) our initial reaction (below) and then, (ii) a more informed commentary as the dust settles and the ‘experts’ forensically analyse the result and its likely impact.\n\nSo back to basics and what we have learned from the General Election results so far, other than the Conservatives had a disastrous campaign and Labour, in opposition and without expecting victory, could promise the world through throwing money at every perceived problem without justifying properly where it was coming from. As I say above, it would appear that the principal differentiator between the Parties was about matters that are not directly Brexit related, although it is hard to completely ignore the tide of opinion over the hard and soft options. Both the Conservatives and Labour agree that the British public want to exit the EU and so this is what must be achieved with as little damage as possible. There is an argument that says a deal with the EU is more rather than less likely now as the weaker position of the Conservatives will mean a softer approach to the EU, but contrary to this is the argument that the UK are now in a weakened position.\n\nCertainly, if the Conservatives have any sense at all, their response to the Election result will be to go back to the drawing board and amend their policies on austerity and public spending as well as seeking cross-party support for Brexit related matters. They should also address the demographics and realise the young seem not to like the Conservative approach to life generally.\n\nOur Brexit related views:\n\nOver the past few months, we have described what we believe to be the short, medium and long term perspective of Brexit. What is it that we have been saying and then how have our views changed as a result of the Election outcome? I set this out below:\n\nLet’s start with the medium term: it is our opinion that the UK will remain a safe haven for international investment capital for all the reasons we are familiar with. We also believe that the UK and the EU will need to reach an appropriate compromise on their relationship going forward, because we believe they effectively have to at some point – for the economic and social health of all involved (and many that are not yet) and a softer rather than harder exit now appears more likely! Negotiations will take time, may well include transitional agreements and time extensions and will, no doubt, involve plenty of intermediate venom and vitriol magnified by the salivating media. However, the end result will likely be pros and cons for both sides of the divide but, we suspect, not materially worse going forward than at present once the dust has settled. Wilful blindness on our part?……Perhaps, but hindsight will have to be our judge on this.\n\nWe also believe that a UK unfettered by the ‘unelected eurocrats’ and free from imposed EU restrictions will be able to negotiate trade deals with economies that are faster growing than the EU – such as China, India, Canada, the US and more. The Election result has not materially changed our opinion on this medium term outlook beyond what I have said above, other than an expenditure policy versus the current austerity measures might see GDP growth benefit (at the cost of increased tax and debt).\n\nIn the short term: it is our opinion that the UK negotiations with the EU and the reporting on it will cause concern, confusion and disruption. Not a comfortable environment for anyone, but one in which opportunity lies for investment funds such as ours that like short term weakness as long as it translates into a means to create medium (and longer) term value. The Election result has magnified this perspective and does not take away from the investment themes we are currently pursuing.\n\nIn the longer term: it is our opinion that the UK may be better off out of the EU (and the Executive Committee of Moorfield all originally voted to remain!) for reasons that are much more about the EU and the Eurozone than they are about the UK or its reliance or role in the EU. We have no crystal ball of course and we are talking about the unpredictable world of politics rather than the world we more readily understand of business, real estate and finance – however, we can’t immediately see how the mechanics of the EU and eurozone can continue without some major changes.\n\nWe are told by the politicians that the answer to the broken experiment that is the eurozone lies in federalisation (i.e. greater monetary and fiscal union). But the voting public across the EU would appear to be pushing hard for greater nation-state independence. So how does that work? Have I not just described opposing forces? We think that the bullet of a Le Pen victory has been dodged for the EU project but it’s a story far from over. Le Pen victory would have likely resulted in a disastrous event for the EU as an ‘in-out’ referendum similar to the one in the UK would have been called for (as it would have been if Wilders had triumphed in the Netherlands – and perhaps still will be if Grillo succeeds in Italy in September) and the result of the referendum(s) would be by no means predictable. President Macron and others seem to have recognised the need for change in the EU structure – but what change, what resultant impact and at what cost….short, medium and long term. The UK Election result does not change our opinion.\n\nAm I being too pessimistic about the EU and the Eurozone? Well, it is worth remembering that Europe, despite some recent GDP growth, has clearly not yet properly recovered from the effects from the GFC. Low growth, high unemployment and unrecognised losses are still present across the continent. This week’s rescue of Banco Popular by Santander (bought for 1 euro and requiring 7 billion euros of fresh investment) and the re-emergence of debt issues in Greece (where the IMF and Germany are again in disagreement about the right way forward) are a helpful reminder of the risks in continental Europe and the issues facing the eurozone.\n\nThe Brits may be relentlessly snatching defeat from the jaws of victory on a number of political fronts but it could still prove to be the case that we have escaped the EU just in time!\n\nFinally on UK real estate investment, post the Election, we will hold the line on the view that Brexit related disruption and caution in the short term will see many investors nervous of the UK. However, this is an opportunity as long as you believe the medium term is a more settled environment. We also continue to believe that investing in discounted assets with short term income will enable value-add returns to be achieved if those investments can be actively managed into assets with longer term stabilised income, which is also true of select development projects that show the same stabilised income characteristics.\n\nMore soon……\n\n2016 was a challenging year for investors throughout the world. Not only were there the usual economic, political and social/demographic obstacles to navigate, but additionally there were the seismic shocks of the mid-year UK Brexit vote followed by the year-end US election of Donald Trump. Of course, many other events of significance occurred around the world over this period, but from a macro-perspective not many of them would currently be classified as potential changers of the ‘world order’. This does not mean I am overlooking the significance of events in the Far-East, South America or the huge threat posed by Islamic State extremists and the rise of the far-right (populist-right) in Europe but, without the benefit of hindsight as yet, Brexit and Trump would seem to be the stand-out 2016 events to beat!\n\nTaking those two premier events in chronological order, and without feeling the need to set out the details (considering the extent of coverage already given to this), I thought I would express my perspective following on from the conversations I have had around the world with business people, economists, politicians and commentators. There is no intention to be politically biased in my comments but simply to share my interpretation and set out how this may impact on our investment strategy.\n\nBrexit\n\nI think it would be fair to say that prior to the ‘In/Out’ EU referendum outcome, many in the business community (and especially those in and around London) would have said that their heads and hearts were in two different places. Head says ‘In’ because who wants the disruption and resultant volatility of stepping into the unknown – we all had a taste of that in the global financial crisis. But heart says ‘Out’ because although we believe we understand the benefits of being part of the EU, it is not a good experience to be dictated to by unelected ‘eurocrats’ who seemingly waste vast sums of capital whilst flexing their undemocratic muscles at inappropriate times. In addition to this, many people in the UK and increasing numbers in the EU see the Eurozone as a failed experiment and the EU as now potentially broken in its current form, so why be part of it? Admittedly, if change is to take place then better to be sat at the negotiating table than peering in through the window, but at what cost?\n\nPost the Brexit vote I was surprised by how relaxed many ‘In’ voters were at the ‘Out’ outcome. The familiar heads and hearts conversation often arose and so the actual disappointment was often understandably muted. Economic and political confusion was overruled by the positive attitude of making the most of the situation whatever was coming down the road, accepting that some changes would be for the better and some would likely be for the worse. Volatility and disruption led to opportunity if a positive stance was taken. Many business leaders were still the same as those in place at the time of the global financial crisis and had learnt to crisis manage whilst recognising opportunity through adversity.\n\nI doubt there is anyone who could honestly say that they had predicted the positive (even bullish) market conditions that have been experienced since the Brexit vote. Perhaps this is the lack of clarity as to what an EU exit actually means for the UK or perhaps it is because of the belief that the UK will be better off as independent, especially considering the EU and Eurozone issues that must be faced in the near and longer term. Or, maybe it is because many believe that there is not much that will change in the UK/EU relationship once all the political posturing is over. Whatever the reason, very little changed in market momentum post June, other than a brief stall, and it can’t simply be put down to the immediate actions taken by the Bank of England, a collapse in sterling and a ‘stiff upper lip’! We should remember that there is also a natural economic cycle taking place alongside all these political events with a momentum of its own, even if it is accelerated or delayed by extraordinary events. As we all know, there are many component parts to an economic cycle, for example; inflation, interest rates, employment growth, consumer expenditure, house prices, business and government investment, oil price and more…. and even without the impact of our sentiment over Brexit (or Trump) all of these components come together in the ordinary course to create the cycle – and let’s not forget that none of us know as yet what the QE programme will eventually result in!\n\nDespite the prolonged debate, that is still far from over, it is currently hard for anyone to see a way through to the other side of Brexit, as the fight over what would be considered a ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ version continues and this gives rise to whether the mandate given to the Government by the result of the referendum was ‘exit at any cost’. The current expectation is more weighted towards an extension of time being agreed for the Brexit timetable and a harder version (if that is appropriate terminology), however, this is ultimately a huge negotiation taking place and obviously no one will show their true colours for some while to come.\n\nPresident Trump\n\nWell that’s a sub-heading I never thought I would type in the real world! Having said that, after the Brexit vote outcome we began to believe it was actually a possibility and whilst on a visit to the US (pre-election) we warned to expect the unexpected after our own UK experience and the rise of the populist movements elsewhere in the world. And so it came to pass. But once again the markets shrugged this off and in fact found the pro-business, pro-growth, anti-regulation Mr/President Trump a rather appealing prospect (at least to date) despite his colourful rhetoric. It’s not my job here to comment more widely on the US economy or political machinations other than to say that an economically strong US and one prepared to be a close ally of the UK is a very good thing for the UK in many respects, especially economically and in the upcoming confrontation with EU-27. The outspoken US President may well say what others silently believe – that the UK is probably better off out than in and actually the EU/Eurozone has many problems ahead that it will need to tackle efficiently and effectively in order to survive in its current form.\n\nBrexit, President Trump, EU/Eurozone – UK real estate strategy\n\nSo what has changed as a result of Brexit, President Trump or a rising tide of concern over the EU/Eurozone once again? I think the answer is ‘it’s the economy stupid’. What we are trying to do is look through the politics and media spin to the economics underneath. Yes, the two are intrinsically linked, but let’s not get caught up in the noise and fake news coming from campaigners and journalists. Instead, let’s consider the impact that each of the economic factors that we are predicting actually has on the real estate cycle. It seems to me that, despite Brexit related acceleration in some areas and delays in others, the economy continues moving forward with most, if not all, the pros and cons that it would otherwise have had. We watch and predict; GDP growth for general economic health and sentiment, inflation to judge likely interest rate movements – and this sits together with employment and wage growth (and house prices) to judge consumers’ confidence and likely expenditure. We also watch business, government and foreign direct investment to gauge confidence and commitment to our economy – and additionally to educate ourselves as to likely areas for value enhancing impact. In other words, other than some yield weakness in short term income (reflecting increased concerns over occupier demand), not a lot has changed in our outlook for UK real estate since the start of 2016, although we are further into the cycle which therefore requires greater caution in the form of risk assessment. I still firmly believe there are investment opportunities that will meet our investment return thresholds despite our greater caution.\n\nBREXIT\n\nThree points to set the scene:\n\nFirstly, and most importantly when unexpected events occur, there should be no rush into making decisions that do not need to be urgently made. Further, let’s be aware of those responding to sentiment swings as an immediate reaction to a surprise such as this Brexit vote, as their decisions are unlikely to be based on well informed and considered judgement and we all need time to listen, watch, consult and contemplate. Having said that, some of us had prepared, at least to some extent, for this potential outcome so hopefully that reduces or eliminates any need for any immediacy on their/our part.\n\nSecondly, the UK has just taken a step into the unknown so there is no one (at all) who is able to guide us as to what ‘will’ happen now. Instead it is about listening to those who have an informed opinion and impartial perspective on what is ‘likely’ to happen – and then formulating a view of your own on which your decisions will need to be made.\n\nThirdly, from a Moorfield platform perspective, we are in strong financial health (best ever at present) and we are UK specialists without pan-European exposure – see below for further comment as to why I believe this is relevant and positive. We have: (i) realised the entirety of MREF and MREFII so all asset and financial risks have been eliminated; (ii) ensured MAREF has secure equity and debt finance in place and a pool of un-invested capital, and; (iii) we have only invested c.50% of MREFIII so this has material cash resources and will be able to take advantage (when appropriate) of real estate market opportunities. Additionally, our current focus in MREFIII (and of course MAREF) is on the Alternative real estate asset classes and, in my opinion, these are likely to be the most stable from both an economic and demographic perspective over the next few years.\n\nThe Basics:\n\nThe UK public has voted to leave the EU by a c. 52:48 ratio on a c.72% turn-out.\n\nThe UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, has resigned effective from the Conservative Party Conference in October 2016. We don’t yet know what will happen with the Chancellor George Osborne.\n\nIt is predicted that on resignation and newly elected PM, Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty (2009) will be invoked and this will begin the process of a two year period of negotiated exit (this period can be extended by unanimous consent). It has also been suggested that there may be 12-18 months of preliminary discussion prior to Article 50 being invoked to pave the way for a more orderly departure. So 2019/20 for UK exit.\n\nIt is unlikely that an ‘EU-lite’ relationship results (i.e. Norway) due to the strong resistance to free movement of people and EU budget participation. Instead it is likely to a more complex one based on a ‘free trade treaty’ such as that between the EU and Canada. But at least Canada has set some parameters to help guide us!\n\nScotland voted 62% remain and 38% leave and so will now be considering/preparing another independence referendum (predicted within 2 years). Currently the general opinion is that the independence camp will win. One of the many issues to be addressed by the First Minister of Scotland (Nicola Sturgeon) will be the economic viability of independence as since the last referendum vote the oil price volatility has reminded everyone of Scotland’s financial fragility and hence reliance on Westminster (i.e. UK parliament). There is also the likelihood and/or appeal of membership to the EU – and of course all those other ‘pros and cons’ from last time that have not gone away.\n\nNorthern Ireland through Sinn Fein have already started talking of reunification with the Republic of Ireland.\n\nWhether positive of negative for the UK in the medium/long term there will be short term uncertainty and volatility in most areas of the economy and this is not good for any of the markets. Sterling is likely to be very weak and there will no doubt be talk of a recession. Sterling weakness leading to a potential pick-up in export led inflation will be unlikely to lead to interest rate rises whilst the BoE is considering how to tackle concerns over economic growth, employment and consumer confidence. Perhaps an interest rate cut is more likely? Of course, lower growth projections are already flooding in.\n\nMoorfield views and its intentions:\n\nDavid Cameron will hand over to a new Prime Minister at the Conservative Party conference in October 2016. This will likely be his final act as UK PM with his interim role principally being to stabilise markets and manage political manoeuvring and division within the Conservative party. In the Labour party there will also be significant unrest and likely leadership challenges. Both David Cameron and Mark Carney (alongside the leave campaign leaders) will have to find credible and comforting words about the strength of the UK economy, together with ongoing banking liquidity and stability, as there is little more that they can do in the short term. Those who predicted disorder and economic unrest resulting from a Brexit (i.e. Bremain camp) will now have the job of ensuring that this does not happen – in part working to disprove their own thesis.\n\nUnquestionably difficult and unpredictable times ahead and I intend to write again when the dust has settled. For now I would say that limited action is the best way forward for Moorfield as we have a well-funded GP and cash resource in both our active funds (MAREF & MREFIII). We have not invested any material capital in 2016 but do have a number of investment opportunities sitting with Brexit clauses – which we will now revisit. I don’t believe a lot of buying opportunities will result in the short term but I do think that some interesting opportunities will arise in 2017 onwards. Moorfield also remains predominantly focused on Alternative real estate investment opportunities where the demographics are more value and income protective through the economic cycle.\n\nIn the past I have expressed my concerns over the future political, economic/fiscal and cultural structure of Europe and hence the risk of investing there (and especially in the Eurozone) and although we regularly revisit our strategy we have always decided to stay UK focused. I believe there is now more reason than ever for this to be the case and here are a few of the reasons:\n\nThe Eurozone is a failed experiment and everyone knows it – so how is it going to be corrected?\n\nEurope currently has more political and economic division than at any time since WWII, in my opinion – and it is not close to being resolved.\n\nPolls suggest (if you chose to take any notice of them) that other EU countries would also vote for independence given the chance – so what does the future hold in this regard? Could independence from the EU go viral?\n\nWhat does all this mean for the euro? It would not be the first time that smart people make good asset investment decisions but make the wrong currency call.\n\nDespite the current events, in the medium term the UK is economically sound, politically stable and has its own central bank and currency. The language, time zones and law assists the highly regulated and professional sectors to make the UK a safe haven for global capital. This, in my opinion is unlikely to change. In fact, independence in a fractious and unstable Europe could prove very positive.\n\nI think real estate capital values will fall in the short term, rents will also stop growing and asset management initiatives will prove more difficult. Income and banking terms (LTV and ICR and cure rights etc) will be very important in every real estate investment.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI am disappointed with the outcome of the referendum but I am very pleased Moorfield determined to stop investing and hold cash in case Brexit occurred, and also that our focus is UK and Alternative sectors. It does not mean we are immune to the pain on some of our Traditional investments but they are all manageable issues until markets get some clarification and direction, afterwhich I believe they will perform well.\n\nI hope the above is of value – more from me over the next few weeks.\n\nBest regards\n\nMarc\n\nWe are less than a week away from what could prove to be the most important vote in a generation – and one that will impact the lives of multiple generations. In my opinion, the consequences of this EU Referendum will directly and indirectly impact in three inextricably interwoven waves: (1) on the UK (2) on the EU (3) on the rest of the world. Perhaps I am seeing dangers lurking in the shadows where actually there prove to be none but it is currently my view that an exit of the UK from the EU will have much greater collateral impact than we can currently forecast or understand. If the UK exit encourages other nations to follow a similar path and independence goes viral we will have many years of global unrest and uncertainty ahead of us and we all know that markets hate that above all else. However, change is clearly needed in some form as Europe is certainly not stable at present, with extreme groups and parties rising in popularity due to a general dissatisfaction and refusal to accept the status quo.\n\nNonetheless, I have to admit that my head and my heart have been in opposition from the outset. … my heart says leave as at least then we will be the victims or victors of our own home-grown decisions, however, my head currently says stay. I believe the EU (and more especially the Eurozone) is in for a rough ride over at least the next decade, in any event. The EU has simmering economic and political instability and the Eurozone is a flawed experiment waiting to fall apart at every level. The next few years could prove a painful economic and political period for Europe and, as such, I would rather be sat at the negotiating table, as an important and influential host, than as an unwanted or uninvited guest.\n\nLife as a member of the EU is far from perfect, just like many Scots feel about life within the UK. But the Scots made the right decision in seeing a unified UK as stronger than a proud standalone Scotland. What the Scots insisted on was a devolution of certain powers and they made it clear that another referendum on independence would come if the promises made by Westminster were not honoured. In fact, it was made clear by Scotland that if anything materially changed for the worse for the Scottish people and/or they clearly wanted another opportunity to vote about their future in the UK then that would be offered. This is the message we must take to the EU – we will vote to stay but we will need the promises honoured, and if anything unacceptable occurs to make matters for the UK worse or even if we change our minds about the value of our relationship with the EU then don’t be surprised if another vote follows. Perhaps therefore a close vote with the outcome being a Bremain will be the best result. Close enough to make the support for EU membership seem fragile and hence give the UK sufficient voice to threaten.\n\nI am not going to talk about the individual and most emotive issues as you will have heard the arguments ad nauseam from both the camps of Brexit and Bremain. What I will do is end for now, at least until the outcome is known, by pointing out some of the issues that I believe are related but much more significant, and do keep me awake: (i) our social welfare system in the UK is no longer fit for purpose and neither is our NHS. They can’t be fixed by tinkering with short term solutions or blaming it on immigration; (ii) the pension industry is in deep trouble as fewer jobs, technological change and a growing and ageing population create a mathematical problem that is unsolvable without radical change in many areas of our society; (iii) terrorism is reflecting the growing levels of dissatisfaction across the world and is proving a career choice for the disaffected; (iv) The population of the planet is depleting and abusing more of the world’s resources than it can hope to replace and replenish. We all know this to be true! So just how many of these issues, that will have adverse material adverse global impact, will we chose to knock down the road for the future generations to solve. Perhaps the question should be – are problems such as these made easier or harder to solve by being united or independent? If the answer is united, which I believe it is, we should all work harder at staying that way rather than running home with our ball when the going gets tough.\n\nPlease find below previous comments made on this topic.\n\nThe EU Referendum:\n\nCurrently, many of our investors are rightly focused on the EU Referendum, and particularly the impact of a Brexit. It is possible to argue that this is the single most important vote that any of us have had since long before Moorfield had its first birthday! In order to share our thoughts, and establish a base from which to do so, I would like to refer back to a few comments I have previously made in my Quarterly Reports to our fund investors.\n\nAugust 2015\n\nThe European Union (EU) and The Eurozone: As you will be aware, the EU is made up of 28 member states that together form a ‘single market’ to oversee co-operation among its members in diverse areas, including trade, the environment, transport and employment. The Eurozone is a monetary union of 19 of the 28 EU member states which have adopted the euro (€) as their common currency and sole legal tender. I have written many times on what I believe to be the original purpose and good sense in creating the EU (intended to saves us from WWIII amongst other more social and economic based matters!) but I have also described the Eurozone as a political experiment gone wrong. This is still what I believe to be the case and Greece is a text book example of why!\n\nDavid Cameron formally launched his renegotiation of the UK’s terms of membership of the EU at the EU Council meeting in Brussels recently. This had been preceded by a tour of European capitals in which he set out his thinking to other heads of Government on a one-to-one basis. His pitch at the Council was then deliberately low key. The wording of the Conservative Party manifesto states that there will be a period of renegotiation and that a referendum will take place before the end of 2017. Beyond that, this document is silent on what level of concessions Mr Cameron would need to extract for him to call the renegotiation a success. The Bill which has been submitted to the House of Commons on the matter indicates neither a date nor a set of ‘red lines’ for the renegotiation exercise. The Prime Minister’s challenge is three-fold: He needs to secure enough from the renegotiation to be able to claim that the referendum is one being conducted about a new deal with the EU; he needs to win a referendum on his recommendation that Britain remains in the EU having secured a better understanding with it and by a margin that settles the question unambiguously ( as a Scottish-style ‘neverendum’ would be a political nightmare); and thirdly, he wants the referendum to occur in a manner that does not divide the Conservative Party so deeply that it becomes impossible to manage in Parliament and electorally endangered in 2020.\n\nThe Prime Minister now seems to have narrowed his renegotiation to five areas of interest, which may yet be reduced further if he feels that any one of them are impossible to obtain concessions in. These five domains are: a dilution of the official ambition of the EU to obtain ‘ever closer union’ (or at least a British opt-out in terms of this language); an enhancement of the capacity of an ordained number of national parliaments (probably ten) to ‘red card’ the edicts of the European Parliament and send them back for reconsideration; a strengthening of the rights of non-Eurozone members of the European Union over economic policy and financial regulation by extending the so-called double majority principle that decisions in this sphere require appropriate majorities of both the Eurozone members and non-Eurozone states before they become applicable in the latter category of member; a substantial change in the length of time that migrants within the EU have to wait before they are eligible to claim benefits in another member country (that period is presently three months, the PM has publicly signaled support for a four year rule, but would almost certainly settle for half of that); and, more tentatively (because it might not be obtainable), a restoration of the opt-outs which the UK obtained from the Maastricht Treaty more than two decades ago, some of which Tony Blair waived.\n\nAlthough progress in this sort of territory would fall well short of what many within the Conservative Party want from renegotiation, Mr Cameron’s calculation is that it would be enough to keep the vast majority of his colleagues in government sufficiently content. He could then afford to allow them a ‘free vote’ in the referendum contest confident that almost all of them would endorse his position rather than take the more divisive step of insisting that they resign if they wanted to oppose him. Much will turn on the attitude of Angela Merkel, but if Berlin determines that it wants/needs the UK to remain in the EU then it would not be that hard for the EU to issue a commitment to deal with the first four of the five areas outlined above and with enough force that Mr Cameron could assert that he has triumphed. His critics will retort that such a victory would be almost without consequence. Changing the mission statement of the EU does not make it a changed institution. National parliaments will not have the authority to overrule the European Parliament so the ‘red card’ is more like a quick trip to a sin bin as far as MEPs are concerned. Beefing up the double majority will be of no value if the UK finds itself in the minority among even non-Eurozone countries in a sector of vital importance. A two year wait to claim benefits will not stop EU migrants coming if they are convinced they will find employment. One suspects, however, that the final public determination about how to vote in the referendum will be less about the details of the terms than a broader sense of whether departing the EU is too risky. For the Conservative Party’s post-referendum debate, by contrast, those details really will matter.\n\nNovember 2015\n\nDare I say again that I think the Eurozone has yet to even come close to convincing many of us of its long term future following its exposure through the financial crisis? For too long we have discussed the potential for a Grexit as the potential catalyst of a break-up of the Eurozone – but I wonder could a Brexit trigger the break-up of the Eurozone, due to simply showing that the people of the UK believe that you don’t have to be part of a club to successfully survive and prosper?\n\nAre UK and European business leaders and politicians’ over-confident of the UK staying in the EU? Could migration and terrorism (such as that in Paris) be the catalyst to the general population deciding that EU rules are unacceptable (epitomised by the immigration laws) and the UK is better standing alone? If so, as set out above, could this even become the trigger for a break-up of the Eurozone and possibly a rethink of the EU membership rules?\n\nWill the UK Prime Minister attempt smoke and mirrors to avert an EU exit for the UK and if he does so will the voters fall for it? It is now widely accepted, even without the migration and potential terrorism issues outlined above, that reform is essential if the UK is to stay a part of the EU and so David Cameron will need to tread very carefully!\n\nMarch 2016\n\nThe Short term: The occupier market is fickle at the best of times, being economically, politically and financially fragile, with occupiers prone to switch off demand and sit on their hands with little more encouragement than some near term uncertainty. As such, the immediate outlook for the UK, with the Brexit referendum (and related issues hard on its heels), is unlikely to be a conducive environment for occupational decision taking. Therefore, it is possible to foresee an inactive occupier market in the UK in many areas over the next few months, including those most likely to have otherwise offered the prospective of rental growth. My opinion is that, unless something unexpectedly positive emerges from the current debates and negotiations, this halt in rental momentum might then prove hard to re-ignite in many areas, even with the UK staying in the EU.\n\nOf course, the sentiment reflected in the occupier market is not the only threat to our broader economic performance, as the same potential for behavioural volatility is also true of investment capital generally. Although it could be argued that there is a fundamental difference between the inactivity of the occupier and that of the investor (due to the constant demands for risk weighted capital returns), investment capital is global and in the face of the current uncertainty perhaps the UKs perceived future economic growth and alluring safe haven status (normally seen as our first line of defence) will not prove enough to encourage or even retain investment capital. We only have to look at the lead up to the Scottish referendum on independence to know this to be true.\n\nConsidering the Brexit based uncertainty we face, my current opinion is that in the short term there will be some economic damage no matter what the ultimate decision, and GDP growth will slow alongside that of employment, consumer confidence and general investment. Sterling will be punished in the currency markets and the positive impact of this on exports will not result in a net benefit overall. Perhaps a positive is that I can see no reason why interest rates will rise in the near term, even if inflation gets some inappropriate momentum, and it would appear the Bank of England feels the same way.\n\nThe Medium Term: However, the reason we have materially stopped investing at the present time, is not because I am concerned with the medium term outlook whilst within the EU or the longevity of performance of our current investment themes (in or out), but simply because the opportunities may get cheaper to buy and build due to the impending Brexit vote (June 2016). I could spend many hours in the writing and produce many pages for the reading if I were to spend the time exploring each of the issues that the politicians will furiously debate in the coming weeks, such as; free movement/immigration, cross-border/trade agreements, regulation/directives, legal/enforcement….etc. but I am not going to – you will be pleased to know! What I will do instead is give you a summary of my personal view with my best guess of the outcome. This view comes from reading, listening and meeting with various organisations where I have an active participation, including; The British Property Federation, The Bank of England Forum, The British Venture Capital Association and even meeting with senior members of the Conservative Party and, most recently, Nicola Sturgeon (First Minister) of the Scottish National Party\n\nBy way of ‘book-ending’, let’s start and finish my EU commentary with the Scottish independence referendum, where some important lessons have clearly been learnt whereas others are seemingly being ignored. In the lead up to the vote on Scottish independence, the UK government and other parties from Westminster in London were far too complacent about their need for a strong message as they believed it a foregone conclusion that the Scottish electorate would vote, in the majority, to stay in the union (UK). They felt it to be a personal crusade undertaken by the then First Minister, Alex Salmond, and his argument had little substance if looked at intellectually rather than emotionally. But Alex Salmond is a great orator and was underestimated. He did not win the intellectual debate, but he played directly and effectively to the electorate with the power of the emotional perspective. Late in the campaign, when voting margins became too close to call, Westminster had to mobilise in a way it had not prepared for and to say near panic ensued would not be an exaggeration. Scotland finally voted to stay in the UK because fear of life outside of the status quo marginally moved ahead of the cleverly manipulated emotional pull – but only just! It is also worth noting that all through this debate, many companies and businesses throughout Scotland had made it clear they wanted to stay in the UK, so this did not prove to be an accurate indicator of the views of the general public. Those running companies and dictating what’s in their corporate best interests are, in fact, only few in number.\n\nThe EU in/out referendum for the UK does not have the same Scottish dynamic with regards a peoples champion (or a film like Braveheart), despite David Cameron wanting to stay in and Boris Johnson wanting to leave, but it absolutely does have the same emotional perspective when it comes to ‘us versus them’. The lesson learnt from Scotland and now being employed by both sides is not to be complacent and to ensure the message is loud and clear as early in the process as possible (Scotland had 2 years whereas EU has just 4 months). The lesson seemingly ignored by the ‘in’ campaign to date (although not by the ‘out’ campaign) is the power of simplicity and emotion – the majority of the voting public will not think in terms of the more rational and frankly complicated points of debate, but instead will vote ‘in’ principally because of their fear of the unknown, or ‘out’ principally because they are tired of being dictated to by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels and Strasburg on issues that are perceived to be substantially (and sometimes entirely) to do with UK living. So if you were to read that last sentence again you would conclude that, at least in my opinion, the majority of the UK electorate would emotionally rather be outside the EU and would vote that way if given the confidence to do so. The outcome is therefore most likely to come down (again) to the fear of the unknown outside of the EU versus the power of the basic argument for safer with the status quo. Let’s not forget that we have seen that it is not an accurate indicator that the majority of companies and businesses (or so we are told) in the UK say they want to stay in the EU.\n\nTherefore, on the basis no one can sensibly argue for something they know nothing about (albeit politicians are very adept at this), let’s put aside the speculation of what life would be like outside the EU and just focus on actually what the majority of the voting public want to hear – the simplistic arguments focused on the benefits and disadvantages of retaining or improving what we currently have in our EU relationship. Of course, this is what Cameron has tried (and so far failed) to do and he should be working hard behind the scenes to try for more opt-outs or Sovereign controls for the UK, to appeal to those emotional issues, considering the gathering strength of the ‘out’ campaign.\n\nSo the point I am making, ahead of my in/out prediction, is that there will no doubt be a lot of time misspent with political noise, posturing and focus on all the EU policies and directives and how much better it will be without them (ie exit) or alternatively how frightening it will be without a say in them (ie an stay in), but I think the swing will be an emotional one based on perceptions and sound bites relating to our Sovereign control over issues most emotive to the general public, such as; immigration controls, UK laws, welfare only for those that have contributed and the security of our borders due to the global terrorism that is increasingly present. As with Scotland, my guess is that it will be hard fought and close but it will have little to do with the detail of the policies. Ultimately, I believe that people will vote for the status quo despite their strong emotion and preference to be independent. The fear of the unknown is just too strong.\n\nI will not spend long in setting out some of my additional thoughts and fears for you to consider. Bluntly, I believe that if the UK exits the EU it could possibly be the beginning of the end for the EU and the (already broken) Eurozone. This is very material globally, both economically and socially, and is, in my opinion, one of the principal reasons why our European neighbours are so concerned about the UK vote and why the world outside of Europe is watching so closely. Yes the UK is a large economy and a very important trading partner in the EU, but this is not just about the UK being part of the EU but also about the ongoing purpose and cohesion of the EU in its entirety. The momentum of the exit vote must therefore be very alarming for more than just David Cameron and his UK allies – and so perhaps there may be more concessions yet to be offered to the UK from across the Channel despite the cries of denial!\n\nI promised to end as I started, with Scotland, so a quick comment on their potential for another independence referendum. When I recently met with the First Minister of the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon, I asked her a number of questions, such as: (i) why she wanted to be independent from the UK, even with devolved powers, but still be part of Europe; (ii) if she would definitely put the independence vote back to the Scottish people if the UK left the EU; (iii) if she felt the EU would break apart if the UK voted to leave; (iv) if she felt confident that the EU would have Scotland as a member on acceptable terms and how long that negotiation with 27 other countries would take; (v) how she would finance an independent Scotland with oil at $30 per barrel when the maths had not worked at $100 per barrel; (vi) did she expect to use Sterling or the euro as a currency; (vii) did she feel she had won any sort of victory for the people of Scotland or just imperilled them as many in England and Wales now felt they would like a vote to decide if Scotland should remain part of the UK. Her response to me was – she wanted the UK to remain part of the EU….! I apologised for appearing confrontational but said I felt that investment capital in or looking at Scotland needed to know answers to these questions. I didn’t get my answers. However, I was later informed that an independent Scotland was not something the SNP felt appropriate to revisit in the near term unless the UK left the EU and then they would reconsider their position.\n\nToday\n\nIt is interesting for me to read again what I have written in the recent past and to realise how little there is to add despite an inordinate amount of time spent listening to the opinions of the ‘in’ and ‘out’ campaigners. As predicted, the exit arguments of both sides have been based on supposition, fear-mongering and a lack of forecasting credibility. Voters want the facts to be stated as simply as possible and without the feeling that this is as much political posturing as it is about the future economic and social environment of the people who live in the UK. I am often staggered by how widely politicians miss the mood of population because they are so focused on fighting each other!\n\nMoorfield will continue to comment on this issue as and when we feel we have something of value to say. My prediction remains that we will ‘Bremain’, but it is interesting to canvass the opinions of my business colleagues and I suggest that the majority feel they would personally like to leave the EU although professionally/corporately they will most likely vote to remain in the EU because of the years of uncertainty and disruption that will follow. However, overwhelmingly they would vote to stay in under a renegotiated treaty and they hope this is what the final outcome will prove to be."
