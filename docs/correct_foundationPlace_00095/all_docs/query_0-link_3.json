        "text": "Mandela Day is an annual global celebration to honour the life and legacy of Nelson Mandela and reflect on his values and principles to make a positive impact in our own communities. Last year, in partnership with Rise Against Hunger and Attacq Foundation our Sage volunteers helped prepare over 200,000 meals for disadvantaged families in South Africa. This year, we are setting the bar even higher. Join us in the fight against hunger and lend a helping hand in your community this Mandela Day, 18 July. Watch this space to find out if we reach our target! #MandelaDay2024 #ItIsInYourHands #Volunteering\n\nOver three-quarters of volunteers (77%) report that volunteering improved their mental health and wellbeing. As we come to the end Mental Health Awareness Week, let's spotlight this powerful yet often overlooked way to boost mental well-being. Engaging in volunteer work not only benefits the community but also brings significant mental health advantages. For many, volunteering creates a sense of purpose, helps build social connections and allows people time to gain perspective on their lives. It’s important that wellbeing isn’t something we focus on for seven days alone, enhance your mental health and contribute to a healthier, happier you and volunteer! #Give #Movement #MentalHealthAwarenessWeek #GiveALittleGainAlot https://lnkd.in/ehnQEQR5\n\n65kg of litter collected in just 90 mins by this super committed PMM team. They all stuck it out in the rain to tidy up our local area. Giving back to our community is a key focus for Sage and we are grateful to have 5 foundation days each per year to give back.\n\nIt was great to be a part of The BOSS Network, Inc graduation last month, hearing from our graduates about the impact of the program and seeing their businesses grow. Our graduates are the perfect example of what we hope to achieve together; making business more inclusive and inspiring that entrepreneurial spirit. We are proud to support Cameka Smith, PhD and The BOSS Network in their mission to break down barriers for the growing demographic of black female entrepreneurs in North America. We can’t wait to continue our journey of growth with The BOSS Network! #breakingdownbarriers #entrepreneur\n\nThis year for International Women’s Day we’re joined our friends at Microsoft to help break down barriers for the next generation of young learners. With a panel session and a tour of the Microsoft campus, we’re looking to inspire Atlanta high school students and get them excited about the possibilities of a career in tech. Sage volunteers also got stuck in with HYPE to create materials for their upcoming tech expo, aimed at empowering girls through skills-based training and networking opportunities. Now more than ever it’s important to be investing in the next generation of tech talent and levelling the playing field so that everyone can thrive. #IWD #breakingdownbarriers #womenintech\n\nWe’re proud and excited to be partnering with Teens in AI again and breaking down barriers to access to STEM and AI learning for so many young people. For us, educating and empowering the next generation is essential to help build a fairer more inclusive world, so we’re excited to see what we’ll achieve together this year. Watch this space! #AI4good #Education #teensinai\n\nMaking business inclusive and supporting social entrepreneurs is a core component of what we do. Our partnership with Ashoka brings to life our commitment to supporting social impact through the ‘changemakers’ in their network. Alex Richmond, PhD and Sara Reed take us through how our relationship multiplies the impact that these social entrepreneurs have in their communities, so everyone can thrive. #breakingdownbarriers #socialentrepreneurs #impact\n\nYour social background or circumstances shouldn’t affect your ability to be successful. Unfortunately, this is not the world we live in. It takes more than motivation to succeed, especially for those who start with an unfair disadvantage. We’re here to break down these barriers. If you are an entrepreneur facing systematic barriers to success, we want to hear your story. Share your experience with us at sagefoundation@sage.com to help us better understand how we can break down those barriers. #MoreThanMotivation #breakingdownbarriers #entrepreneurs\n\nWe are all about breaking down barriers and creating visible change in our communities. Hearing from entrepreneurs like Larry Witherspoon talk about the impact that he is having in his community, shows the importance of the work.
