        "text": "The Sage Casey Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit founded in memory of Sage Casey Schmitt, a 14-year-old who lost their life to suicide in 2017. According to Rebekah Schmitt, Sage’s mother, she started the nonprofit to create a positive legacy for Sage.\n\n“Sage was such a positive bright light to everybody that knew them, and the way they died was so tragic, and it impacted so many people,” said Schmitt in a phone interview in May. “We really didn’t want the way that they died to be the last impact that they had in the community ... we wanted to find a way to turn that around and let their legacy be something more positive.”\n\nEarly challenges and evolving mission\n\nWhen Schmitt first started the Sage Casey Foundation, she didn’t have a clear idea of where they were going with it or if they were even making a difference. She just knew that she wanted to tell Sage’s story in hopes that it might help someone else.\n\nThe Sage Casey Foundation began with music scholarships to the Cazadero Music Camp, which are still going strong today. Every summer, the foundation sponsors two students from Hillcrest Middle School — where Sage went to school — with a full week-long trip to the Cazadero Performing Arts Camp.\n\nAdapting during the pandemic\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, the foundation started sending out Rainbow Bags — goodie bags full of fidget toys, sunglasses, and other fun items that feature positive affirmations like, “Keep going,” “No storm lasts forever,” and “You cannot be replaced.” The Rainbow Bags aim to reduce feelings of isolation in Sonoma County youth while also supplying them with useful information and resources.\n\nThe Sage Casey Foundation now also puts on various events throughout the year that aim to educate the community on mental health and suicide prevention. On June 22, the foundation is hosting their annual Rainbow Party at Crooked Goat Brewing in Sebastopol. The party, which runs from noon to 10 p.m., will have rock and face painting, bracelet making, food trucks, live music, and more. Admission for this party, along with everything else the foundation does, is completely free.\n\nCommunity support and recognition\n\nSchmitt says that the main reason why they are able to offer their services at no cost is because of the generous residents of Sonoma County.\n\n“We’ve been very very lucky with the support we have from our community,” said Schmitt. “We’ve been fortunate to be able to do everything we do using volunteer donations and support.”\n\nLast year, Schmitt and the Sage Casey Foundation were recognized by more than the local community. The Sonoma County Commission on Human Rights and the 4Cs of Sonoma County recognized Schmitt and the foundation as Human Rights Champions and Champions for Children, respectively.\n\nCall for volunteers and inclusivity\n\nWhile there are only four board members at the foundation, and the core staff that plans and pulls off all the events is made up of around a dozen people, Schmitt says that they have “a big group of volunteers and hundreds of people that donate and support the organization.”\n\nHowever, they’re always looking for more help. They need volunteers to help out at their Rainbow Party on June 22. Interested volunteers or organizations that would like to table can email outreach@sagecaseyfoundation.com.\n\nWhile Sage was pansexual and gender fluid, and the organization is happy to support LGBTQIA+ youth, the resources, parties, bags, and information that the Sage Casey Foundation supplies are for all youth, regardless of gender identity. They’ve even occasionally expanded to other at-risk people who aren’t youth, like adults in the veterinary care field.\n\nContinued impact and community involvement\n\nSchmitt says that the organization prides itself on its flexibility and is constantly taking suggestions and looking for areas where they can help raise awareness about and prevent suicide. She encourages members of the community to reach out and tell them about places where their services could be needed.\n\nWhile the organization has steadily evolved over the years, Sage’s story is still at the core of the Sage Casey Foundation. Schmitt says that, even though it’s been more than seven years since the passing of her child, people are still reaching out and telling her how much Sage’s death impacted them.\n\n“There is a face on this issue,” said Schmitt. “I hate that it’s my child’s face, but I love that we are making a difference, and it’s because of Sage.”\n\n“To still be hearing that [people I don’t even know are impacted by Sage’s story] makes me feel like we are doing something meaningful.”"
