        "text": "The Russell Sage Foundation building is an architecturally distinguished seven-story structure originally designed by Philip Johnson. A renovated adjacent townhouse provides additional scholar offices. Together, the buildings provide excellent facilities for individual research and collegial activities. Services include computer and library facilities, conference rooms, and a dining area. Each Visiting Scholar has an individual office with administrative and other support services. Subsidized housing near the Foundation is also provided for scholars from outside the New York area.\n\nLocated at 112 East 64th Street, between Park and Lexington Avenues, the Foundation is near a variety of educational, research, and philanthropic institutions. Hunter College of the City University of New York is four blocks north of Russell Sage, and the Rockefeller University four blocks east. Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the Manhattan campus of Fordham University are directly across Central Park.\n\nImage: Fradkin & McAlpin Architects"
