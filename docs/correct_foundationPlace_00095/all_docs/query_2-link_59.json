        "text": "The SAGE Foundationâ€™s vision is centered around empowering young people, especially graduates, from low-income backgrounds to overcome the challenges that poverty often creates for them.\n\nThis includes equipping them with the necessary academic tools to ensure that they achieve their full potential. By providing education, resources, and support, the SAGE Foundation aims to break the cycle of poverty and give young people access to opportunities they may not have otherwise had.\n\nPeople\n\nMeet the leaders who guide our vision and strategy. Our board of directors brings a wealth of experience and expertise that drives us towards success. They have the right combination of industry expertise, strategic vision, and a commitment to excellence\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nInternational Board of Advisory\n\nPartners\n\nOur partners are instrumental in helping us bring our ideas to life. We are proud to work with a group of investors who believe in our vision and support our mission. The support of our dedicated partners helps us succeed and make a positive impact in the world.\n\nFunding Partners\n\nOur Training Partner\n\nSupporting Groups\n\nThis whitepaper explains that white-collar employers are not satisfied with the employability of fresh college graduates in India due to a lack of a common framework for employability. It suggests a possible way to solve this issue through a project implemented by The SAGE Foundation which has achieved impressive results in skilling low-income youth for jobs in the BFSI sector."
