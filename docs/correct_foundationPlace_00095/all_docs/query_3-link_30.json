        "text": "The Superintendent has several advisory groups with whom she meets when making decisions concerning the school division, and the education of our city's youngest residents. One such group is composed of high school students. The division superintendent meets with them regularly and considers their perspective and personal insight on various initiatives and issues. This group is formally called the Student Advisory Group on Education, or SAGE. Representing every high school, the involved students go through an application process, and are selected to serve for a school year. During their monthly SAGE meetings, members have shared their views and offered suggestions and input on various education matters from the divisionwide grading scale to major revisions to the Student Rights and Responsibilities Handbook."
