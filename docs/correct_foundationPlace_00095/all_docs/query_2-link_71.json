        "text": "One of the oldest American foundations, the Russell Sage Foundation was established by Mrs. Margaret Olivia Sage in 1907 for \"the improvement of social and living conditions in the United States.\" In its early years the foundation undertook major projects in low-income housing, urban planning, social work, and labor reform. The foundation now dedicates itself to strengthening the methods, data, and theoretical core of the social sciences as a means of diagnosing social problems and improving social policies. It also funds researchers at other institutions and supports programs intended to develop new generations of social scientists. The Russell Sage Foundation is an operating foundation directly involved in the conduct and dissemination of social science research.\n\nPanelists:\n\nStephen Glauser is a Program Officer at the Russell Sage Foundation. His portfolio includes the Pipeline Grants Competition, the Summer Institutes, and the Small Grants and Targeted Competitions. Since starting as a Program Assistant in 2012, he has worked across all of the program areas at RSF, including assisting in the development of new initiatives and programs, and securing external co-funding. He holds a BA in History from the University at Buffalo and an MS in Environmental Policy and Sustainability Management from the New School.

She earned her Ph.D. from The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio and her B.A. degree from Connecticut College in New London, CT. Originally from Dominican Republic, Yalidy is a 1.5 generation immigrant and first-generation scholar. Matos’ scholarly work examines the intersections between race, ethnicity, and public opinion and political behavior. By drawing on theoretical frameworks from various disciplines, she uses a mixed methods approach to understand the racialized nature of U.S. immigration policies as well as other politically consequential public and social policies. Professor Matos examines the political behavior of different racial and ethnic groups in relation to identity politics. Matos’ work can be found in the American Behavioral Scientist, American Politics Research, LABOR: Studies in Working-Class History, Perspectives on Politics, Politics, Groups, and Identities, and Political Research Quarterly.
