The relocation from their flagship headquarters in Gosforth represents one of the region’s largest and most significant office relocations. The new premises house 2,000 staff in a variety of work settings and have been designed in line with Sage’s brand guidelines. The company head office and business support functions include marketing, sales and customer service, a dedicated software training facility and a meeting village.\n\nKey to the success of the project was strategic space planning that adopted agile working methods, enhanced individual and collaborative workspaces and brought social spaces to life. These moves are importantly aligned with the business strategy of delivering benefits now and in the future to both staff and customers by promoting symbiotic relationships across different teams."
