        "text": "Overview\n\nSince SAGE first met in response to COVID-19 on 22 January 2020, it has been grateful for insights from a huge range of sources. At high pace, experts from academic, public sector, industrial and commercial communities have provided the high quality research and information used to formulate advice given to government.\n\nParticipants\n\nListed here are the names of participants who provided input as experts at one or more meetings, including public servants who acted in an expert capacity. SAGE participants are required to declare any interests relevant to the SAGE meetings they attend. Find out more about participants interests.\n\nThese meetings are also regularly attended by officials from government. These attendees have not been named.\n\nPermission to publish names was requested from all participants. Those who did not give permission have not been named.\n\nSupport\n\nThe continuing demand for COVID-19 science advice from government has placed an exceptional burden on many experts participating in SAGE and its subgroups. In response, the Government Office for Science has offered a range of support to these experts including personal security and wellbeing.\n\nIn addition, an unprecedented burden has also been placed on universities – the employers of many SAGE participants – particularly during the academic year. To ease this, the government has secured funding in support of those universities most affected to provide cover for the academic’s duties such as teaching. The funding will enable the key SAGE participants with the most severe time and workload constraints to continue their work on SAGE as appropriate and ensure SAGE continues to benefit from their expertise.\n\nScientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE)\n\nSAGE provides scientific and technical advice to support government decision makers during emergencies. Find out more about SAGE.\n\nLast updated: 4 March 2022.\n\nSir Patrick Vallance FRS FMedSci FRCP KCB Government Chief Scientific Adviser Professor Sir Chris Whitty KCB FMedSci Chief Medical Officer Mr Dinesh Aggarwal University of Cambridge Professor Rebecca Allen University of Oxford Professor John Aston Chief Scientific Adviser, Home Office Dr Marc Baguelin London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Imperial College London Professor Charles Bangham Imperial College London Professor Wendy Barclay FMedSci Imperial College London Professor Laura Bear London School of Economics and Political Science Professor Jonathan Benger UWE Bristol Ms Fliss Bennee Welsh Government Professor Phil Blythe Chief Scientific Adviser, Department for Transport Professor Chris Bonnell London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Professor Sir Ian Boyd FRSE University of St Andrews Dr Declan T Bradley FFPH Department of Health, Northern Ireland Executive Professor Chris Brightling University of Leicester Professor Peter Bruce FRS University of Oxford Professor Iain E.
