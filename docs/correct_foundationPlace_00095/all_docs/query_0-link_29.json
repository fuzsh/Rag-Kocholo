        "text": "Our Computers for Kids campaign, launched last year to help more children and young people get online, has received its biggest boost to date thanks to a £30,000 donation by software company, Sage.\n\nAnd it’s hoped this major cash injection will spur more of the region’s leading businesses to follow suit and donate to help disadvantaged youngsters access technology.\n\nAccording to analysis from the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, at least 55,000 families in the North East do not have access to a laptop, tablet or desktop computer. Digital exclusion can lead to less access to education and jobs and social isolation in later life.\n\nEach £200 funds a digital device, connectivity and distribution for a child or young person. Sage is calling on other businesses to help raise £100,000 as this would provide the region’s children with 500 new, data-enabled laptops; a significant contribution towards ending digital poverty in the North East.\n\nHow to donate\n\nAny individuals or companies wishing to donate can do so by clicking the box below.\n\nDonate to our Computers for Kids appeal\n\nPaul Struthers, MD UKI, Sage, said: “The pandemic has accelerated use of technology in schools, although in turn it has exacerbated the impact of digital exclusion of some children.\n\n“This is not a problem that will diminish when schools reopen as normal; it needs to be part of a vision where all can benefit from the huge advantages access to digital can bring to education.\n\n“We’re delighted that our donation will have such a positive impact in this region. But we are also asking other businesses to follow suit and donate what they can to support families in their communities that need it most.”\n\nLeigh Elliott, Chief Executive of Children North East, said: “Children North East is liaising closely with schools across the region who have been working tirelessly to identify those pupils most significantly impacted by Covid-19. Our charity will ensure those children get access to all the digital technology and connectivity they need to engage in their schoolwork and activities.\n\n“This is not just a short-term issue, it is more important than ever to look at a long-term sustainable approach in ensuring all children and young people, especially those suffering the effects of poverty, get access to online learning.\n\n“Sage has provided our campaign with a massive boost, our biggest donation to date, in purchasing new devices and we are delighted to be able to offer more businesses the chance to get behind this at such a difficult time for many families.”\n\nThe £30,000 Sage donation will be funnelled to the North of Tyne Combined Authority area, where the company’s new global head office will be based when it opens at Cobalt Business Park. This builds on a £20k donation the company made in 2020 to the combined authority’s Digital Inclusion programme."
