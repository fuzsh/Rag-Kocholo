        "text": "EMPOWERING YOUTH, TO LIVE THEIR TRUTH\n\nWhat is #SAGESPOTTING?\n\nThe Sage Casey Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that was founded in memory of Sage Casey Schmitt. Sage was only 14 years old in 2017 when they lost their life to suicide. The pressure of wanting to be accepted for who they were led to depression, and they were unable to win that battle. And the world lost the most amazing person. Our mission is to bring awareness to suicide prevention, reducing the stigma surrounding conversations about mental health, and to provide positive support and encouragement to local youth by empowering them to find and pursue their own passions, and to follow Sage's example by always being a rainbow in someone else's cloud. ​\n\n​Learn more about SCF here...
