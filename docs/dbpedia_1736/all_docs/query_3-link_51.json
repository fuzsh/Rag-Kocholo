They know how to collect evidence, build a strong case, and negotiate with insurance companies on your behalf. They will also work hard to ensure that all relevant deadlines are met.\n\nHaving an attorney represent you also helps protect your rights and ensures that you receive fair compensation for any injuries or losses you suffered. They can explain all possible outcomes before you make important decisions about settling or going to court. They will do their best to help you get the results you deserve in a timely manner.\n\nIn addition to helping you navigate the legal process, your lawyer can also provide emotional support and guidance throughout the process. Many accident victims feel overwhelmed by all the paperwork, meetings, and other tasks involved. Your attorney will be there to answer your questions and help you make sense of everything that’s happening.\n\nWhat Is The Purpose Of Filing A Car Accident Claim\n\nThe purpose of a car accident claim is to give the injured party an opportunity to pursue justice and compensation for the defendant’s negligence. Compensation can come in the form of economic and non-economic damage. Economic damage relates to things like medical bills, vehicle repair costs, and lost wages. Non-economic damage relates to less concrete harm, like your physical pain and emotional suffering.\n\nYou should also know that you are not suing the other driver directly in most cases. You are filing their insurance policy, so most or all of the damages are paid by their insurance company. Don’t feel guilty or hesitate when receiving money from an insurance company. Their purpose is to pay out claims like yours when an accident happens.\n\nDealing With Insurance Companies After An Accident\n\nAfter an accident, insurance companies and adjusters will try to pressure you into giving them a recorded statement or getting you to sign paperwork. Do not do it. It is critical that you do not do anything that could hurt your potential case. Insurance adjusters are hired to save their employers money, even if it is at your expense. They know how to settle your claim for as little money as possible.\n\nWe Will Deal with the Insurance Companies\n\nTo receive compensation after your car accident, you will need to negotiate with the negligent driver’s insurance company. Insurance adjusters are in the practice of offering low amounts of money to accident victims. It isn’t personal, though, it’s just in their job descriptions. They know every trick in the book that will help them lessen the amount of compensation they owe you. Oftentimes, an insurance company’s offer is woefully less than you deserve and need for recovering from your injuries and loss.\n\nDon’t worry about dealing with insurance adjusters if you hire our Atlanta car accident attorneys, though. We have built our firm on going head-to-head with insurers, so clients can skip this unpleasant part of the claims process.\n\nOur lawyers know how to negotiate with the insurance adjuster in order to secure a just and fair amount.\n\nWhat Is The Georgia Car Accident Claim Process?\n\nA car accident claim from the start to a trial can include these steps:\n\nFiling the initial insurance claim: When a driver is involved in an accident, they should report it to their insurance company to start the process of pursuing compensation. If someone else caused the accident, that party’s insurance company will be involved, too.\n\nPotential denial of the claim: Because many insurance companies are looking after their own profits, many claims are wrongfully denied each year. This means the claimant will need to use other legal means to get compensation.\n\nFiling the complaint: To start a personal injury lawsuit, such as after a car accident, the plaintiff (who is the injury victim) or their attorney must file a complaint. This is a document that formally states the allegations against the other party, known as the defendant, and explains the damages that the plaintiff suffered. It is vital that the complaint is written correctly, and also filed and served properly.\n\nMotion to dismiss: The defendant may try and file a motion to dismiss the case entirely. They’re trying to save money by getting the case removed, as well as delay a potential lawsuit, increasing the claimant’s need for settlement money.\n\nDiscovery process: In this stage of the pre-trial process, both parties in the lawsuit are required to exchange certain information and evidence that are relevant to the lawsuit. The discovery process might include the submission of records and other documents, physical evidence, testimonies, answers to written questions, etc. In a personal injury case, this is an important step for obtaining information that could potentially be used as evidence in the trial. The discovery process also involves the taking of depositions, or recorded statements that involve the parties verbally answering questions while under oath.\n\nSettlement offer: If the claimant’s legal team can present enough evidence to prove that they have a case, the insurance company may offer a settlement. No offer should be accepted without first running it by the claimant’s attorney, though, because it could be much less than adequate. The claimant might be able to pursue maximum compensation through trial.\n\nTrial: As for the actual trial itself, the plaintiff will need to be able to effectively argue their case in court. With the help of a knowledgeable lawyer, the injury victim might be able to do this through witness testimony from accident reconstruction experts, medical experts, or other types of professionals. Evidence such as accident reports, the defendant’s driving record, photographs, video surveillance, and much more can also be crucial during a trial.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhat Do Lawyers Do During a Car Accident Investigation?\n\nHow Long Do You Have to File Your Car Accident Case?\n\nWhat Compensation is Available After a Car Accident?\n\nWhat is Your Car Accident Case Worth?\n\nWhat Are the Steps I Should Take After a Car Accident?\n\nWhat Should I Not Do Following a Car Accident?\n\nHow Long Will Your Car Accident Case Take?\n\nCan a Manufacturer Be Held Liable for an Accident?\n\nWhat Happens After My Case?\n\nHow is Liability Determined in an Auto Accident?\n\nIf my Atlanta area accident was just outside of city limits will I have a Fulton County accident report?\n\nWhat Do Lawyers Do During a Car Accident Investigation?\n\nOur legal team looks for the following:\n\nTexting while driving or any other form of distracted driving\n\nAggressive or reckless driving\n\nDrivers who were impaired by alcohol, illegal drugs, or even prescribed medications\n\nDangerous road conditions, design, defects, or layouts\n\nMechanical failure and defects in automotive design\n\nHow Long Do You Have to File Your Car Accident Case?\n\nGenerally, you have two years from the date of the accident to file a case for personal injury. If a minor child was involved in the accident, then that child has a longer period of time to file their case, though.\n\nRecently, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that the time period to bring file a personal injury case can be extended beyond two years depending upon the date of the injury and resolution of the traffic ticket. This new law provides injured victims additional time to select the proper lawyer.\n\nWhat Compensation is Available After a Car Accident?\n\nExperiencing a car accident can be traumatic and facing the aftermath can be overwhelming. The costs of car repairs or a new vehicle, as well as medical expenses, can become a great burden. This is especially the case if you are unable to work after an injury and are experiencing wage loss.\n\nAn experienced attorney may be able to secure your financial compensation for the following:\n\nMedical bills\n\nRehabilitation\n\nOngoing care\n\nLoss of services\n\nLoss of a spouse\n\nLost wages\n\nInstances of pain and suffering\n\nWhat is Your Car Accident Case Worth?\n\nNo two cases are the same. Case valuation involves a complex and skilled analysis of the liability issues, causation, and damages that are unique to your case. Our team can examine all factors and help you understand what compensation might be owed to you, as well as your legal rights and options.\n\nFactors to be considered, include:\n\nTotal economic damages\n\nNoneconomic damages related to your injury’s severity\n\nInsurance company bad faith\n\nContested liability\n\nWhat Are the Steps I Should Take After a Car Accident?\n\nThe steps you take after your car accident can have a major impact on whether or not you receive a settlement, as well as your physical recovery.\n\nHere is a list of a few of the things you should do after you are injured in an auto collision:\n\nGather as much evidence as possible: Photos of the accident scene and witness contact information are especially useful.\n\nGo see a doctor: Waiting too long to obtain medical treatment could result in the insurance company later questioning the validity of your claim.\n\nBill to your insurance plan: When receiving treatment for your injuries, make sure that the medical care is billed to your health insurance plan, as you may end up losing more of your settlement to medical bills if you do not take this step.\n\nContact a car accident lawyer as soon as possible: A lawyer can advise you of the best actions to take to increase your chances of full compensation. An attorney can also deal with the insurance company on your behalf and handle the logistics of your claim or lawsuit.\n\nWhat Should I Not Do Following a Car Accident?\n\nA car accident can occur at a moment’s notice, leaving you in a state of shock with many questions swirling around in your head. “Is my car totaled? How much is this going to cost me? What do I do now? Is it safe to get out of the car? Is the other driver at fault, or am I?”\n\nAfter the accident, you may know that you need to exchange contact information with the other driver, but there are many things that you should NOT do, including the following:\n\nDo not apologize to the other driver.\n\nDo not admit fault.\n\nDo not forget to find out if there were witnesses.\n\nDo not think it’s OK to dismiss your injuries.\n\nDo not skip immediate medical care.\n\nDo not fail to remember the police officer’s name and get a police report.\n\nDo not post pictures or comments on Facebook or any other social media site.\n\nDo not give a recorded statement to the insurance company.\n\nDo not sign any paperwork from anyone without having a lawyer review the documents.\n\nHow Long Will Your Car Accident Case Take?\n\nThe length of time it will take for you to obtain compensation through a personal injury claim or lawsuit will depend on various factors. With both the claims process and the litigation process, a resolution can take just a few months, or it can even take a few years. One major factor that could affect the timeframe of your case is the seriousness of the injuries.\n\nWhen injuries are serious or catastrophic, it may take a long time before the full extent and effect of the victim’s injuries are apparent. It is important that attorneys do not settle or litigate a case before they can prove the full monetary damages (past, current, and future) of the victims’ injuries. The injuries will likely need to be proven through medical records and statements or testimony provided by medical professionals.\n\nIn the claims process, it can take a great length of time to reach a settlement if the victim and the insurance company are not available to agree on a compensation amount. In litigation, the discovery stage (which involves the exchanging of key information between both sides in the lawsuit) and the stage of getting a date for a jury trial can potentially drag out the process. At The Kalka Law Group, we do everything we can to help the claims or litigation process go as efficiently and smoothly as possible.\n\nCan a Manufacturer Be Held Liable for an Accident?\n\nCar accidents involving an auto part defect are complicated, especially when it comes to recalls for defective parts.\n\nFor example, imagine that your accident was caused by an accelerator issue. First, we would need to find out if your vehicle’s VIN was involved in a recall that is related to the gas pedal. Unintended acceleration cases have been known to be caused by sticky gas pedals and floor mat obstructions. They also have been caused by human error, as drivers push the gas pedal instead of the brake, so we need to make and prove that distinction.\n\nIn order to determine what exactly happened in your case, you should get investigators, software engineers, and a good accident attorney on your side. A full team of legal professionals and outside experts can determine if the manufacturer could be held liable for your auto accident.\n\nWhat Happens After My Case?\n\nAfter you receive a settlement or verdict, assuming that your case is a success, entities that paid medical bills on your behalf or provided other benefits might try to seek reimbursement through the compensation award. Some of these entities include health insurance companies, auto insurance companies for medical payments, government-run providers of health benefits(including Medicaid and Medicare, and providers of workers’ compensation.\n\nThese types of claims for reimbursement can greatly reduce the level at which you are able to benefit from your settlement or verdict award. Our firm can help you explore your options for eliminating or lowering your reimbursement obligations.\n\nWho is to blame for a car accident?\n\nFiguring out who is to blame for a car accident involves uncovering negligence and determining liability. In legal terms, someone acts negligently when they act in a way that another reasonable person would not have, and that decision or action causes someone else to suffer from harm. For example, a person who decides to drink and drive is acting negligently because the average person would not make that choice. Liability is a legal term for “blame” or “fault.” The more someone’s actions contribute to an accident, the more liable they are.\n\nWhat if I am partly to blame for my car accident?\n\nGeorgia is a modified comparative negligence state with a 50% liability threshold. As long as you are no more than 49% liable for your car accident, you can seek a recovery from the other driver. However, any damages you can recover will be reduced by your liability percentage. For example, if you were 20% liable for your crash, then you can still file a claim and potentially recover 80% of your damages.\n\nWhat are common types of car accidents?\n\nCar accidents take many forms, such as:\n\nDrunk driving accidents\n\nDistracted driving accidents\n\nExhausted driving accidents\n\nSpeeding accidents\n\nRear-end collisions\n\nT-bone collisions\n\nHead-on collisions\n\nAnd more\n\nIt is important to work with a law firm with extensive experience with all sorts of car accident types, so you can be confident that they will know how to best handle your case.\n\nWhat are common car accident injuries?\n\nPeople who are hit by another driver can suffer a variety of injuries. Typically, the injuries that they suffer will be dependent on the type of impact that happened. For example, whiplash and lower back injuries are common among people who are hit in rear-end accidents. People who are hit head-on, though, might be more likely to suffer broken limbs and a traumatic brain injury.\n\nWhat if I’m injured in a work-related car accident?\n\nAfter a work-related car accident, you might be able to recover compensation in two ways. Firstly, you should explore your workers’ compensation policy to see if you can have your medical costs and a portion of your lost wages replaced without needing to prove that you weren’t liable for the crash. Secondly, you should talk to a car accident attorney about filing a claim against the driver who hit you. If you can, you might be able to receive compensation for damages that have not been paid by your workers’ comp benefits.\n\nFree Consultation – Proven Results\n\nThe Kalka Law Group has recovered millions of dollars for car accident victims throughout Atlanta.
