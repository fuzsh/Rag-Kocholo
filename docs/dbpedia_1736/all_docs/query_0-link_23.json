        "text": "Temple in South Delhi, India\n\nKalkaji Mandir, is a Hindu Temple, dedicated to the Hindu Goddess Kali. It is situated in southern Delhi, in Kalkaji, India, a locality that has derived its name from the temple and is located opposite the Nehru Place and close to the Okhla railway station, Kalkaji Mandir metro station.[1][2][3] Hindus believe that the image of the Goddess Kalka here is a self-manifested one.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe temple was rebuilt later by Marathas\n\nThough the temple is thought to be much older, the oldest portions of the present building are believed to have been constructed not earlier than the 1764 AD by the Marathas, with additions in 1816 by Mirza Raja Kidar Nath, the Peshkar of Akbar II[4] During the second half of the twentieth century, a considerable number of Dharamshalas were constructed around the temple by Hindu bankers and merchants of Delhi. The temple itself is built on the land of Shamlat Thok Brahmins and Thok Jogians who are also the pujari's of the temple and who perform Puja Sewa. The Thok Brahmins consist of Four Thullas, namely Thulla Tansukh, Thulla Rambaksh, Thulla Bahadur, and Thulla Jasram. They are classified into Gharbari Jogi and Kanphada Jogi. [5]\n\nLegend\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to a Hindu legend, Kalika Devi was born at the site where the temple is situated.[6]\n\nMillions of years ago, the gods who dwelt in the neighbourhood of the present temple were troubled by two giants and were compelled to prefer their complaint to Lord Brahma, 'the god of all'. But Lord Brahma declined to interfere and referred them to the Goddess Parvati. Out of the mouth of Maa Parvati sprung Kaushki Devi, who attacked the two giants and slaughtered them, but it so happened, that as their blood fell on the dry earth thousands of giants came into life, and the battle was maintained by Kaushki Devi against great odds. Maa Parvati took compassion on her offspring and out of the eyebrows of Kaushki Devi came Maa Kali Devi, 'whose lower lip rested on the hills below and the upper lip touched the sky above. She drank the blood of the slaughtered giants as it poured out of their wounds, and the goddess obtained a complete victory over their enemies. Maa Kali Devi then fixed her abode here, and she was worshipped as the chief divinity of the place.[citation needed]\n\nIt is believed that the Goddess Kalkaji, pleased with the prayers offered and rituals performed by the gods on the advice of Lord Brahma, appeared at the site of the temple and blessed them, and settled at the site. During the Mahabharata, Lord Krishna and the Pandavas are said to have worshipped Kali at this temple during the reign of Yudhisthira. The temple itself is believed to have been constructed by Thok Brahmins and Thok Jogians[clarification needed] at the order of Kali.[7]\n\nIt is also called Jayanti Peetha or Manokamna Siddha Peetha. \" Manokamna\" literally means desire, \" Siddha\" means fulfillment, and \" Peetha\" means shrine. So, it is believed to be the holy shrine where one gets the blessings of Maa Kalika Devi (Goddess or Mother Kalika) for the fulfillment of one's desires.\n\nLegend of Lal Baba [1]\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 1980s, Baijal severely injured his right leg and doctors said it will have to be amputated.\n\nA priest gave Baijal's family a list of nine sacred locations to visit and seek blessings. However, even after completing the rigorous pilgrimage schedule, Baijal's suffering continued. On reaching the temple of Baba Baidyanath in Deogarh, Jharkhand, Baijal dreamt that he should go to the temple of Kalka Devi in Delhi within nine days.\n\nThe family organized support of fellow passengers in the train and Baijal arrived at the door of the Goddess. Five months later, his leg was \"miraculously\" cured. This prompted Baijal to take sanyas (asceticism) and become Lal Baba, wearing red robes in honour of Kalka Devi and playing the damaru.\n\nAmong the significant rituals of the shrine is the early morning bathing of the deity with milk, ornamentation, and aarti (prayers). The priests of the shrine allowed Lal Baba to contribute Ganga water as part of the bathing ritual. It made Lal Baba begin a unique spiritual journey. He went intermittently to locations where the Ganga flowed and carried back a barrel of its water. An entire room was designated where Ganga water collected by him and his followers was stored. Gradually, Lal Baba gained stature and respect and the number of his followers increased. The temple authorities permitted him to sit in the Yagna Kund, facing the sanctum of the Goddess.\n\nLal Baba passed away almost a decade ago. The unique ritual of offering Ganga water continues. Lal Baba's seat has now been designated as 'sacred', attracting huge donations from the faithful.\n\nModern structure\n\n[edit]\n\nThe temple complex, as it stands today, is constructed of brick masonry, finished with plaster and marble, and is surrounded by a pyramidal tower. The central chamber which is 12-sided in the plan, 24 feet across, with a doorway in each side, is paved with marble and is surrounded by a verandah 8'9\" wide and contains 36 arched openings or exterior doorways. This verandah encloses the central chamber from all sides. In the middle of this arcade, opposite the eastern doorway, are two red sandstone tigers sitting on a marble pedestal. Both the pedestal, as well as the marble railings, contain Nastaʿlīq inscriptions of recent origin. Between the tigers, there is a stone image of Kali Devi with her name engraved in Hindi, and a trident of stone standing before it.\n\nThe temple complex is situated on the Delhi Metro between the Nehru Place bus terminus and business center and Okhla railway station and industrial area, and next to the Baháʼí Faith's Lotus Temple. Close to the temple, on a hill in the east of Kailash Colony and near the ISKCON temple, lies an edict of Ashoka, dating from the 3rd century BC.\n\nRituals\n\n[edit]\n\nThe temple is visited by worshippers all year round, but the culmination point of their prayers and celebration is during the twice-yearly festival of Navratri, a nine-day Hindu festival, in spring and autumn, during which a large fair is organised. Devotees gather and sing hymns and songs praising the Goddess Durga.[8] During these nine days, many tradesmen selling various handicrafts come to the temple to boost their business. Devotees stand outside in serpentine queues for their turn to get a glimpse of the goddess.\n\nThe major ritual consists of offering and bathing the idol (Mata Snanam) with milk followed by an aarti every morning (6 am) and evening (7.30 pm). This, in turn, is followed by hymn recitation. Offerings can be purchased just before the entrance of the temple. The Puja Archana and other rituals are performed turn by turn (Monthly Basis) by Pujaris consisting of more than 1,000 Nai families who are the descendants of four main clans (thules) of Brahmin pujaris and one clan of Jogis/Mahants.\n\nThe atmosphere around the temple is airy and bright with lights all night. Devotees also try to meditate there and an aarti is held in the evening.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nKalka Cave Temple\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
