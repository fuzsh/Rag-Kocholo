        "text": "Have you ever dreamed of traveling back in time and experiencing the charm of the British era in India? If yes, then you should definitely take a ride on the Kalka Shimla Toy Train, one of the most beautiful railway journeys in India. The toy train, which runs on a narrow-gauge track, connects Kalka, a town in Haryana, to Shimla, the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It was built by the British in 1903 to provide access to their summer capital of Shimla, which was then known as Simla.\n\nThe toy train is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and offers a spectacular view of the Himalayan mountains, valleys, forests, and villages along the way. In this article, we will provide you with a comprehensive guide to the toy train journey, including its history, route, timings, fares, booking options, things to do, tips, and more. Whether you are a history buff, a nature lover, or a thrill seeker, you will find something to enjoy on this unforgettable adventure.\n\nSo, read on and get ready to hop on the Kalka Shimla Toy Train!\n\nHistory of Kalka Shimla Toy Train\n\nThe history of the toy train dates back to the late 19th century when Shimla became the summer capital of the British Empire in India. The British officials and their families used to escape the scorching heat of the plains and spend their summers in the cool and pleasant climate of Shimla. However, reaching Shimla was not an easy task. The only way to get there was by road or by horse-drawn carts, which were slow, risky, and uncomfortable.\n\nTherefore, the British decided to build a railway line that would connect Kalka to Shimla and make the journey faster and safer. The construction of the railway line began in 1898 and was completed in 1903. It was a remarkable feat of engineering as it involved laying down 96 km of track on a steep gradient with more than 100 tunnels, 800 bridges, and 900 curves.\n\nThe longest tunnel on the route is near Barog station and is 1.14 km long. It takes about three minutes to cross it. The toy train was inaugurated by Lord Curzon, the then Viceroy of India, who enjoyed the first ride from Kalka to Shimla. Since then, the toy train has been running on a daily basis, except for some maintenance breaks in between. The toy train has witnessed many historical events and personalities over the years. Some of them are:\n\nMahatma Gandhi traveled by the toy train in 1921 and 1931 to meet with Lord Irwin and Lord Willingdon respectively.\n\nLord Mountbatten traveled by the toy train in 1947 to announce the Partition of India from Shimla.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru traveled by the toy train in 1948 to attend a conference in Shimla.\n\nIndira Gandhi traveled by the toy train in 1972 to sign the Shimla Agreement with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\n\nDalai Lama traveled by the toy train in 2010 to visit Shimla.\n\nAlso check out: Kalka-Shimla Toy Train – A Breathtaking Journey!\n\nKalka Shimla Toy Train Route\n\nThe toy train route is one of the most scenic and picturesque routes in India.
