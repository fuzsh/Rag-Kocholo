This British-era railway track was severely damaged due to continuous rain in July and August this year. Because of this, more than 300 sites are expecting repair work. After restoration, six toy trains and a Rail Motor Car (RMC) started operations in September. Under the new schedule, the train will depart from Kalka at 3:45 AM and reach Shimla at 8:55 AM without stopping at Kanoh, Kathlighat, Shogi, and Tara Devi. While returning, the train will depart from Shimla at 10:55 AM and reach Kalka at 4:35 PM without stopping at Kathlighat, Kumarhatti, Sanwara, Koti, Gumman, and Taksal.

The excluded stations from the first train are covered by the second train, and vice versa. The replacement of a single coach Rail Motor Car with a full 7-coach train enhances passenger convenience. This adjustment allows ample block margin for track maintenance. The decision to exclude certain stops is a trial, and we remain open to feedback and suggestions”.\n\nAs per reports, the decision was taken after keeping a few factors in mind such as ticket sales, passenger rush, distance between stops, and the length of the railway track. Despite the reduction in stoppages, the number of train services between Kalka and Shimla remains at six services each way.\n\nWith this move, the government aims to streamline services and offer quick movement between the destinations.\n\nend of article\n\nAlso Read"
