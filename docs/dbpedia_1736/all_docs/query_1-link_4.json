Therefore, the whole school programme is based on the inclusion of essential skills mapped under this philosophy. It provides enough opportunities to learners to develop in each of the physical, social, emotional, and intellectual areas of development. 'ACT' which means Attitude, Communication and Skills, is incorporated in the school philosophy to foster, and enhance opportunities and challenges for the leaners. All multi-disciplinary scholastic and activities emphasise upon the regular practice and harmonious implementation of 'ACT' so that it becomes a worthy habit and finally the character of a real 'Smart Kpite'. The essence of teaching is to enhance ideas and progressively transcend it to greater height of attainment."
