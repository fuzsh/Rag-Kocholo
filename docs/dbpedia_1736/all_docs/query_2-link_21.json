        "text": "Read the Previous Part\n\nDay 2: Delhi – Simla (Our First Date with the Toy Train)\n\nThe day started early. We took Delhi – Kalka Shatabdi Express which takes only about 4 hours to reach Kalka.\n\nTip while Travelling with a kid: Avoid long Bus travel as much as possible – kids gets irritated in the narrow and congested space\n\nSince they serve breakfast on the train, we did not bother the hotel with an early breakfast – though they insisted that it can be arranged. We booked an Uber from the Hotel and reached the railway station in no time. The beautiful India Gate and Connaught Place came in our way.\n\nThe train journey was comfortable and timely. By around 11:45 we reached Kalka from where we were to start climbing the mountains. We were thinking of a journey in Taxi but were lucky to get the last minute reservation in the Toy Train – The Himalayan Queen.\n\nThe rail route was first created in 1903 by the British to make a quick connectivity between its summer capital of Shimla and winter capital of Delhi. Lord Curzon was the first passenger of this magnificent train route.\n\nThe Kalka Shimla Toy Train begins its journey from Kalka railway station, situated in Panchkula district of Haryana. At 656 meters, it takes its first climb and starts covering a track length of 96 km to reach Shimla, which is positioned at an altitude of 6,812 feet amidst the beautiful hills and mystical woods. The 18 stations it covers are: Kalka, Taksal, Gumman, Koti, Sonwara, Dharampur, Kumarhatti, Barog, Solan, Salogra, Kandaghat, Kanoh, Kathleegat, Shoghi, Taradevi, Jutoh, Summer Hill and Shimla. At every station, the train halts for some time, so passengers can relish the taste of local food along with enjoying tea and snacks on the way.\n\nThough the name suggests being royal, the Himalayan Queen is basically an ordinary train unlike the Shivalik Express – which is more luxury type. I must confess that it was one of the best train journeys ever for me. The dark tunnels, steady curves, arched viaducts on which the rail is laid have kept me glued with the surrounding for the entire length of the journey. The journey actually passes 102 tunnels, 864 bridges and 919 breathtaking curves which really create a magnificent experience and never allow you to get bored.\n\nEven the little one liked it when the train was entering a tunnel. There was innumerable of those and each and every one of those created a joy among the passengers – everyone was shouting. After a while, the beautiful city of Shimla emerged in front of us – the city laid on the slopes of the mountains creates a fascinating picture. The colorful pitched roof of the buildings, lit by the sun – looks fabulous.\n\nThe train slowly moved along the curvy rail line and climbed the hills. After a while, we started feeling cold. After about an hour’s journey suddenly everything was covered with cloud, and we could hardly see anything. A portion of cloud also entered the train and made a misty environment. We started feeling our clothes wet. It was a dramatic experience. We also faced a bit of heavy rain on our way. After about six hours the Himalayan Queen finally reached its destination. We got down of the train – it was a dream come true for us and there were many like us.\n\nShimla is a small railway station that only serves the narrow-gauge toy trains, but it is one of the cleanliest railway stations I have seen. There are enough waiting areas, clean toilets, souvenir shops and easy access to the main road. During the journey we saw many monkeys sitting on the side rails – they in plenty of number in the station.\n\nBe Alert: Don’t keep any eatable in hand – also don’t carry small bags which look like carrying eatables – monkeys can attack and snatch those.\n\nA guide to the Kalka Shimla Toy Train Route:\n\nThere are three trains running daily between Kalka & Shimla.\n\nRail Motor Car\n\nRail Motor Car is a single coach train of which the interior is excellently decorated with beautiful tube light fittings and has got a transparent glass rooftop. The coach is air-conditioned and the seats are cushioned. In addition, 2 plug points to charge your mobile phones, laptops or any other device are fitted with the seats.\n\nThe Rail Motor Car (72451) starts early in the morning at 5:10 am from Kalka and reaches its destination at 9:50 am. The return train (72452) departs at 4:25 pm from Shimla and arrives at Kalka at 9:35 pm.\n\nhe Rail Motor Car charges INR 320 one way for adults and INR 160 for children\n\nShivalik Deluxe Express\n\nThe Shivalik Deluxe Express luxury Toy Train, equipped with a carpet, large glass windows, plush cushioned seats, upgraded toilets and soothing music offers a pleasant ride from Kalka to Shimla and vice-versa. It is beautifully designed with all wooden work and features wall to wall carpeting with curtains and portraits. In addition, the train has a comfortable seating arrangement along with an accommodation capacity of 120 passengers in total.\n\nEnjoy overlooking the panoramic views of the scenery from wide-glass windows while having your food on the way, which includes 2 pieces of brown bread, 1 veg cutlet, bread jam, bread butter and ketchup sachets. The train also serves its travelers with a mineral water bottle and hot water in a thermos to prepare tea or coffee. Although there are no stops listed in between, it halts at Barog station for some time. Here you can satisfy your appetite with a healthy yet mouthwatering meal.\n\nThe Shivalik Deluxe Express toy train (52451) starts early in the morning at 5:20 am from Kalka and reaches its destination at 10 am. The return train (52452) train departs at 5:50 pm from Shimla and arrives at Kalka at 10:30 pm.\n\nThe Shivalik Deluxe Express charges INR 510 one way for adults and INR 255 for children.\n\nHimalayan Queen\n\nAlso known as a standard train to explore the beauty of the hill-station positioned in Himachal Pradesh, the Kalka Shimla Himalayan Queen Toy Train comes with first and second-class carriages. It runs all 7 days in a week and covers the required distance at a speed of 18 Kmph. The train is equipped with only one chair coach and has standard car seats to offer – to make the journey of the passengers an enjoyable experience.\n\nThough the food service is not available in Himalayan Queen train, people can get their food at any of the 9 main stations it stops. These stations include Barog, Dharampur, Jutogh, Solan, Summer Hill, Kumarhatti, Taradevi, Kandaghat and Salogra. Some of the halts are for nearly 5-10 minutes, which simply means that you can step out of the train to capture as many photos as you can – with mesmerizing landscapes and valleys at your backdrop.\n\nThe Himalayan Queen toy train (52455) leaves Kalka at 12:10 pm and arrives at its destination at 5:30 pm. The return train (52456) departs at 10:40 am from Shimla and reaches Kalka at 4:10 pm.\n\nThe Himalayan Queen charges INR 470 one way for adults and INR 235 for children\n\nShivalik Queen and Shivalik Palace Tourist Coach are two more trains that operate on the same route. Designed to offer the ultimate luxury to the passengers, they feature ultra-modern facilities with a beautiful interior, a dining table, a refrigerator, a fully equipped kitchen, comfortable sofas and cushion beds for relaxing. However, one needs to make booking much ahead of their Shimla tour to travel via these trains as they run only once a week and from March to September.\n\nRead the Previous Part"
