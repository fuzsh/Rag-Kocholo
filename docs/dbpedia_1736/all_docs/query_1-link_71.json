        "text": "Tour and travel agencies have also requested the rail authorities to retain the old departure time of 12.10pm. Tourists from other states normally arrive by the Shatabdi Express and continue their journey to Shimla on the toy train.\n\nAdding to the chaos, online ticket booking sites show train cancellations until October 24.\n\nCommuters and travel agencies have expressed their worries as they seamless connection between the Shatabdi and Himalayan Queen has been disrupted. Many passengers arriving at Chandigarh Airport used to opt for the Himalayan Queen, an option that is no longer viable.\n\nThe special train, however, has brought along a price-cut, charging a mere ₹50 for the Kalka-Shimla travel. The fare for the Himalayan Queen from Kalka to Shimla was ₹475 for first class and ₹275 for chair car.\n\nThe special train makes only two stops at Dharampur and Barog railway stations. In contrast, the Himalayan Queen train had stops at every station along the route.\n\nIn an attempt to save time, the Himalayan Queen had undergone changes in its operations, including a revised schedule introduced on October .\n\nRail motor cars have not been operating on the route since July 9. Although the heritage track was repaired on October 2, the rail motor car service was not resumed. The rail motor car offers a stunning mountain view and was introduced during the British colonial era for mountain enthusiasts. It has since been upgraded to a vista dome rail motor car, featuring large windows and a glass roof.\n\nSenior divisional commercial manager, Ambala, Naveen Kumar, reported reduced passenger numbers on the track."
