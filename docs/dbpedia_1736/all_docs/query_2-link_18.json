        "text": "Journey date: 25.11.2015\n\nWe decided to explore the famous Kalka -Shimla Railway journey on our way back home (Shimla) from Jaipur. The plan was to reach Chandigarh Railway Station around 5 a.m. and take a taxi to Kalka Railway Station for the train to Shimla scheduled at 6 a.m. On a cold winter morning of November, we reached the Kalka Railway Station at 5.55 a.m., thinking that we were cutting it very fine.\n\nNo doubt our train was there at the platform. But it looked sleepy. It was in no mood to budge. They told us the departure will be delayed by an hour or so. It felt like we were insects who had climbed on a sleeping bird. We had taken our positions comfortably in it’s fur and were now waiting for it to wake up and take us places. (I’m pretty sure that’s what travel loving insects do.)\n\nSo after doing a brief hunger quenching, I decided to walk around the station.\n\nFinally, around 7.30 a.m. the train woke up, shook itself and with half open eyes started trudging on its century old track. It was only after some time that it realized that it was a train and was really really late for work today.\n\nAnd so the journey began. But by then we had given up on life and it took some time for us to take interest in the once-craved-for journey.\n\nThis remained the view inside the cabin for some time. After we regained consciousness, the beauty outside couldn’t be ignored. We took turns to sit at the cabin door and enjoy the natural beauty around.\n\nThe railway track is a narrow gauge railway with its route having numerous picturesque views that include the various major and minor railway stations, tunnels and bridges. The minor railway stations are all built in the same architectural typology of a single storied building that has a colonnaded veranda along the front facade, a pitched roof and occasional dormer windows and chimneys. These have been painted homogeneously and have cream walls, wooden members painted blue, red corrugated sheet roof and, in some cases, exposed stone on the outer walls.\n\nAs per popular hearsay the area Barog was named after a Col. Barog, who was the engineer responsible for the designing of the tunnel. It is said that the digging of the tunnel was commenced in a way that the work was started from both ends of the tunnel to meet at the center. But because of a miscalculation the two ends of the tunnel did not meet. Barog, the engineer, was fined 1 Rupee by the British Government for this mistake. It is said that he could not bear this humiliation and committed suicide. The story has now evolved and the local people believe that the ghost of this Englishman haunts the tunnel.\n\nThis bridge lies just before the Kanoh Railway Station. Bridge number 541, is a magnificent stone structure located at a walkable distance from the station. One thing that my experience with Indian Railways has told me is that once a train is late here, it does not stop getting delayed. And so due to the enormous delay at the beginning station itself, the train had to stop and wait at various stations for long periods of time. Kanoh was one of these stations.\n\nIt was almost noon when we reached here and were tired beyond our own imaginations. But the sight of this bridge filled us with a new energy. The delay at the Kanoh Station felt like a boon as we had time enough to step out of the train and walk to this bridge.\n\nA journey of almost two more long delayed hours was left. But this is where I stopped the documentation. Getting back into the train, I decided to leave the exploration of the remaining journey for some other day. We reached the Shimla Railway Station after a long unexpected 8 hour journey from Kalka; by the end of which, all I wanted was to take a hot water bath, have home food and finally sleep snuggled in my dear dear bed!!"
