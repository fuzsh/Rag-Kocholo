The views of lush green valleys, rugged mountain valleys, and mountain soil vegetation are a treat to the visitor's eye.\n\nShimla: If you are planning a trip this New Year’s Eve and you are planning Shimla as your destination, we have something to tell you about. The famous toy train of Shimla, which runs on the route from Kalka to Shimla, is all booked. Amid the holiday season rush, tourists are choosing Shimla as their favourite destination, due to which the waiting list for the toy train is growing by leaps and bounds, as per a report by Times Now.\n\nWe all know how much tourists love the hills of Himachal and keeping in mind the two major holidays of Christmas and New Year, the tourists have surprised nobody.\n\nKalka Shimla Toy Train: Jorney Details\n\nThe Kalka Shimla train is becoming a popular tourist attraction because of the sights it has to offer during its ride. The views of lush green valleys, rugged mountain valleys, and mountain soil vegetation are a treat to the visitor’s eye. Moreover, the journey also provides the remarkable experience of going through more than 100 tunnels.\n\nHere’s an old video of the train journey you should not miss:\n\nWatch:\n\nIt should also be noted that the Indian Railways also runs toy trains on the Him Darshan, Shivalik Deluxe Express, Kalka-Shimla Special, and Kalka Shimla Up Mix-Down Mix.\n\nKalka Shimla Toy Train: Route Details And Stoppages\n\nThe Kalka Shimla Toy Train runs at a mesmerising height, and that makes it exquisite for travellers to get its ride. The train has eighteen stoppages, including Kalka, Taksal, Gumman, Koti, Sonwara, Dharampur, Kumarhatti, Barog, Solan, Salogra, Kandaghat, Kanoh, Kathleegat, Shoghi, Taradevi, Jutoh, Summer Hill, and Shimla. Some stations are not working, as per the current report.\n\nFirst Toy Train crosses Plate Girder Bridge in Himachal’s Shimla After nearly 3 months\n\nFollowing the successful trial on the Plate Girder Bridge in Himachal Pradesh’s Shimla, which collapsed due to floods in August, the first toy train departed after almost three months in October this year. The trains were stopped on July 7 on the Kalka-Shimla heritage line after the track was damaged at several locations in Himachal Pradesh in Solan and Shimla districts. Two trains were resumed on September 26 till Taradevi.\n\n“We did successful trials yesterday on this bridge as it collapsed on August 14. The NDRF was doing rescue operations, so we started restoration on August 26 and after completion, the first train departed for Kala today. Now the department would decide to resume all trains; the route is good to run the track and we have run the first train successfully today,” Randhir Singh, Senior Section Engineer, Northern Railway, said.\n\nThe local residents were also delighted as the train resumed after the damage caused by the floods. The local councillor of Shimla Municipal Corporation, Virendra Thakur from Summerhill ward, said that it was a tough time and now this train would be easy for locals and revive the tourism business in the region.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"
