        "text": "About Foglifter\n\nEdward Gunawan’s The Way Back was recently awarded the Silver Medal for “Collections” at the NCPA 29th Book Awards.\n\nMegan Ellis’s essay “I Like My Body More When It Is Bruised” in Volume 4 Issue 2 was an honorable mention for Best American Essays 2020.\n\nFoglifter Journal is honored to have won a Whiting Foundation Literary Magazine Prize thanks to our contributors’ powerful writing and readers’ generous support! This recognition of our dedication to uplifting the LGBTQ+ literary community’s essential, powerful voices and stories means so much—we’re tremendously grateful to The Whiting Foundation and thrilled to continue serving our community.\n\nFoglifter was a finalist for the 2020 CLMP Firecracker Award for Magazines: General Excellence.\n\nTC Tolbert won a 2021 Pushcart Prize for the poem “untitled” in Volume 4 issue 2.\n\nGreg Marshall’s essay “Secksi” in Volume 3 Issue 1 was an honorable mention forBest American Essays 2019.\n\nFoglifter was a 2019 Lambda Literary Award Best Anthology finalist for Volume 3 Issue 1.\n\nFoglifter was a 2020 Lambda Literary Award Best Anthology finalist for Volume 4 Issue 2.\n\nDamitri Martinez’s story “Bat Outta Hell” from Volume 4 Issue 1 won the 2020 PEN/Robert J. Dau Short Story Prize for Emerging Writers.\n\nChen Chen won a 2020 Pushcart Prize for his poem, “four short essays personifying a future in which white supremacy has ended” in Volume 3 Issue 2.\n\nFoglifter—created by and for LGBTQ+ writers and readers—continues the San Francisco Bay Area’s tradition of groundbreaking queer and trans writing, with an emphasis on publishing those multi-marginalized (BIPOC, youth, elders, and people with disabilities). Our biannual journal features the widest possible range of forms, with an emphasis on transgressive, risky, challenging subject matter, innovative formal choices, and work that pushes the boundaries of what writing can do. By putting extraordinary queer and trans writers into conversation, we uplift a growing community of LGBTQ+ readers and writers and carve out space in the larger literary community for voices that have historically been silenced.\n\nWhat we do\n\nWe currently publish a biannual literary journal, chapbooks by dynamic emerging writers, and anthologies through partnerships with Bay Area QTBIPOC literary organizations like RADAR Productions, Still Here San Fransisco, and Queer Ancestors Project. We host free, accessible release parties for each journal issue at Strut, a community center in the Castro District of San Francisco, as well as other free readings around the Bay and beyond, in addition to events we co-produce with other community organizations. We actively promote authors by nominating their work for yearly Best Of anthologies, as well as providing opportunities for readings, interviews, and collaborative community discussions. The success of queer and trans writers is the driving force behind everything we do.\n\nThe Board\n\nWilliam Johnson\n\nBoard Vice-Chair\n\nAlicia Mountain\n\nBoard Treasurer\n\nNatalia Vigil\n\nBoard Secretary\n\nThe Staff\n\nContributing Editors\n\nTara Rose\n\nMelton Cartes\n\nStacy Nathaniel Jackson\n\nD.
