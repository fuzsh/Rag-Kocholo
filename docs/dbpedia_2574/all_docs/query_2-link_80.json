NONDEPARTMENTAL WITNESSES STATEMENTS OF: MAXINE WATERS, U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN, CHAIRPERSON, BLACK CAUCUS CAROLYN M. GETRIDGE, SUPERINTENDENT, OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TONI COOK, ELECTED MEMBER, OAKLAND BOARD OF EDUCATION MICHAEL LAMPKINS, STUDENT DIRECTOR, OAKLAND BOARD OF EDUCATION ACCOMPANIED BY: JEAN QUAN, BOARD PRESIDENT, OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT NABEEHAH SHAKIR, TEACHER, COORDINATOR FOR THE STANDARD ENGLISH PROFICIENCY PROGRAM, OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT opening remarks of senator arlen specter Senator Specter. The hearing of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, will now proceed. This morning's hearing, in our capacity as appropriating subcommittee for the Department of Education, relates to the subject of ebonics, which is a term derived from ebony, black, and phonics, sound, coined in 1973 by Dr. Robert Williams who will be testifying at today's hearing and refers to an African- American speech pattern where linguistics experts have long debated whether ebonics constitutes a dialect, a language, or vernacular speech. There has been considerable discussion, really controversy and concern, as to whether ebonics is a separate language, and as such undesirable or whether it is a teaching skill and a bridge for some to perfect and learn language skills. There is a very considerable Federal appropriations involvement because of very substantial Federal funds which are available on education and related matters. Illustratively, title I, education for the disadvantaged, provides funding of up to $7.7 billion, some of which could conceivably be used in this line, and the bilingual education program for limited English proficient students has funding of $156.7 million. The Office of Education Research, which studies and evaluates innovative educational techniques has a funding of $598.4 million. And the school improvement program, which addresses the particular needs of each school district and innovative methods of learning has funding of $1.426 billion. Representative Peter King in the House of Representatives has introduced a resolution, H. Res. 28, expressing the sense of the House that ebonics should not have Federal funding. The current controversy arose on December 18, 1996, when the Board of Education of the Oakland Unified School District unanimously approved a resolution to devise a program to, ``improve the English language skill of African-American students.'' The resolution generated controversy around three issues: First, whether ebonics is a language or a dialect of English; second, whether Federal funds earmarked for bilingual education should be made available for ebonics-based programs; and third, whether ebonics was to be bought in classes. The board further stated that they, ``approved a policy affirming standard American English language development for all students,'' and further that, ``language development for African-American students, who comprise 53 percent of the students in the Oakland schools, will be enhanced with a recognition and understanding of the language structures unique to African-American students.'' When this policy generated a considerable amount of concern, the board at Oakland revised its resolution on January 15, and the newer version removed the statement that African-American students should be taught in their native language of ebonics, and instead the emphasis to be on the implementation of a full program featuring African language systems principles to move students from language patterns they bring to school to English proficiency. The Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, issued a statement on December 24, 1996, as follows: ``elevating black English to the status of a language is not our way to raise standards of achievement in our schools for our students. It has been determined by the United States Department of Education and the Clinton administration that the use of Federal bilingual educational funds for what has been called black English for ebonics is not permitted. The administration's policy is that ebonics is a nonstandard form of English and not a formal language.'' The issue generated one very important lawsuit back in 1979 when in Ann Arbor, MI, a group of African-American mothers sued the local school board in the Federal courts for failing to recognize that their elementary school aged children used, ``black vernacular, thus denying them equal educational opportunity, and the Federal court found in their favor, and without ordering any specific remedy said that there ought to be something done about that process.'' In approaching this subject, I think it is important to note the emotional level on the matter generally. I relate to that very directly, recalling Yiddish being spoken in my house when I was a youngster, both of my parents being immigrants. And it was spoken a lot more when my brother was growing up--he was 10 years older than I--because he knew a lot more Yiddish than I did. And I can recall the difference of my father's accent, and it was different. And in our melting pot society, we all like to fit in and be similar and not stick out or be unusual. But at the same time, we all have pride in our own backgrounds, a great deal of ethnic pride. And so it is a complex issue, and there is no doubt about the fact that education is, if not the highest priority in our society today, it is a priority second to none. And it is a matter for State and local control beyond any question, and the Federal education budget of $28 million is in the 5- to 6- percent range of the total education budget. But we do have a considerable sum of money. The programs that I itemized total up to approximately $10 billion, which could touch on this subject, and we want to be sure that all Americans have the best educational opportunity possible to present themselves in the best light in a very, very highly competitive society we have, competing with other Americans and in a world competition competing with other countries. So it is a matter of very considerable importance. We have a very balanced witness list. After the hearing was announced we had requests from many, many more people to testify, and we will have another hearing or hearings, depending upon what today's hearing discloses and what the interest is, and yesterday afternoon I received word from Congresswoman Waters about her interest in testifying, and she is the chairperson of the Black Caucus, and we have rearranged the schedule. She and I had a lengthy discussion yesterday. She said she could boil it down into 5 minutes. That is quite a challenge, but we do welcome her here, and I would like to yield now to my distinguished colleague, Senator Faircloth. opening remarks of senator lauch faircloth Senator Faircloth. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank you for holding the hearing, and I thank you for letting me join you this morning. I have just a very brief statement and thought on it, and I did want to express it this morning. The issue, Mr. Chairman, has received a lot of attention all over the United States, particularly since the Oakland School Board announced the program. And I simply want to say that I think ebonics is absurd. This is a political correctness that simply has gone out of control. As Rev. Jesse Jackson said, it was teaching down to people, and that is the last thing we need to be doing. Now, I am very much aware that teaching children in schools in the inner cities and in poor neighborhoods all over the country, rural or inner city, has never been easy, and it never will be. But rather than trying to lower the academic standards, we should try some of the old fashioned remedies that I think would still work. Nobody should be passed from grade to grade unless they can master the basic three R's of reading, writing, and arithmetic, and I think we have left that. I think we need greater teacher control in the classroom. We should allow the teachers to discipline the children. That did work at one time, and I do not mean physical punishment, but they should have the right to discipline the children, to expel troublemakers immediately. We should try school uniforms to raise the self esteem of the students, so families do not have to spend hundreds of dollars on clothes for school children. These ideas have worked. They worked long ago, and I think they produced a generation of people who had the basic reading and writing skills all over the Nation, cities and rural areas. I simply do not think we need to go searching for a new form of English to solve the problems of the schools. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for letting me be heard. Senator Specter. Well, thank you very much, Senator Faircloth. summary statement of hon. maxine waters We now turn to our first witness, the Honorable Maxine Waters, U.S. Congresswoman and chairperson of the Black Caucus. Welcome, Congresswoman Waters. Ms. Waters. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am extremely appreciative for the fact that you rearranged this hearing somewhat today to allow me to come over and share my comments with you, and I know that you were bombarded with requests by many people to come and speak, and the fact that you have allowed me to do this is indeed very much appreciated. I have a prepared statement, and perhaps I will have an opportunity to go through some of the points of it, but I cannot start where I thought I would start because I want to be a part of setting the record straight. And I want to do that in a way that will help to educate and instruct so that we will not have Members of Congress and others who are policymakers continuing to mischaracterize what has been attempted by the Oakland School District and to give new definitions to words that have been used in an effort to help our children learn standard English. I do not understand when it is said ebonics is absurd. I think it is somewhat misleading. It is not important to focus on words that attempt to describe the problem, but what is rather very much important is that we understand the issue. The fact of the matter is, Mr. Chairman and members, too many African-American children have been entering school year in and year out speaking different language patterns, something other than standard English. It persists, and when this happens it obstructs their ability to learn in ways that teachers would have them learn. They really cannot learn the sciences and math and other subjects that are being taught because they are not proficient in the English language. We should not continue to pretend that this situation does not exist. It does exist. The different language patterns are real. Children continue to come to school day in and day out with these different language patterns, and it is a problem. We should commend the Oakland School District for finally saying to everybody: Let us recognize that this is happening, no matter what caused it, no matter why it has happened. There are those who will attempt to explain it and talk about the roots of it, but the fact of the matter is we have children with different language patterns. Not only does it get in the way of their ability to learn oftentimes, if they continue with these language patterns as they enter the world of work, people will not listen to what they are saying. They will only listen to the fact that they sound different. Oftentimes people are said to have said they do not understand what is being said by many of the folks who are using these different language patterns. And so the Oakland School District adopted a resolution, and this resolution basically said we are going to recognize that there are these language patterns and we are going to do something about it. We want all of our students to speak standard English, and we are going to have to teach our teachers and involve ourselves in the community in ways that will help everybody not only to recognize that these language patterns exist, but we must all work together to correct them so that in the final analysis the students will speak standard English. So if we are clear about what is being attempted here, we will stop the misdefinitions and the incorrect descriptions about what is being attempted. Nobody is saying we want to change English, we want to teach black English, nobody is saying that. What we are saying is, and what they said is, we want to recognize that it is a fact of life. What can we do about it? How can we help students learn standard English? That is the goal. And so let us not talk about ebonics being absurd or ridiculous. The fact of the matter is I think we all want the same thing. We want our students to speak standard English. So again, Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you for allowing me the opportunity to appear today. Reiterating, several weeks ago the Oakland Board of Education passed a resolution affirming its goal to teach standard American English to all of its students, including its African-American students. It adopted a strategy which recognizes that many African-American students use different language patterns. After years of trying to teach children with little or no experience using standard English, Oakland courageously faced directly that problem that it is, and many other school districts across the country face in teaching its students. Millions of students enter school each year with a language structure unique to many African-Americans. Whether we like it or not, this is the reality. What the Oakland School Board has done is to acknowledge this and adopt a strategy for teachers and parents that will enhance their ability to achieve the goal of teaching proficient standard English to every one of its students. For this, Oakland should be commended. Often misunderstood, this action was a bold step, based on months of research and experience from many different school districts, community involvement, and yes, determination. Let us not allow the debate over words, whether it is ebonics, pan-African communication behavior, or any other description, to obscure the fundamental point of the Oakland School Board's action. It does not matter what we call the language or dialect of our children. What matters is how we can teach them standard English. School districts around the country have been facing the problem of young children entering the classroom year after year without a basic understanding of standard English. Against the persistence of this problem, many jurisdictions have employed language development programs like that which Oakland has just adopted systemwide that have shown great promise. We have an educational crisis in many quarters of America. According to the California State Department of Education, African-American students have a dropout rate of 7.6 percent, compared to 2.7 percent for whites. In the Oakland Unified School District, African-American students have an average grade point average [GPA] of 1.8, the lowest of any racial or ethnic group. The poor academic achievement level of African- American children in Oakland, and indeed in many American communities, requires parents, educators, and policymakers, to address this reality in a forthright matter. The status quo is not working. Many linguists have stated that Oakland's decision is credible, it is rational, and a potentially effective way to improve the academic standards of its students. At a conference in Chicago, IL, this month, the Linguistic Society of America concluded that the Oakland School Board decision is linguistically sound and a proper teaching method. These conclusions underscore the basic point of this entire discussion, whether this language starting point, whatever this language starting point, we need to help children bridge the gap between the language patterns they know and standard English. We must find new ways to help these young men and women achieve their full potential. This is no simple task, and it will require the best creative minds. We must be open to new alternatives for bringing all of our children into the educational and professional mainstream, instead of ignoring language structures that have prevented our children from learning math, science, communications, and other subject which enhance their future prospects. The Oakland School District has confronted the challenge head on. The Oakland Unified School District is not the first, nor will it be the last, to utilize the most primary teaching tool of all, take children where they are, and prepare them for the future. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I hope you will agree that the education of our children is one of if not the top priority. If we fail to prepare our children for the future, we will reap the whirlwind of their frustrated dreams. We just understand and incorporate the full context of the educational crisis in America to fully appreciate the recent actions of the Oakland School Board, as well as their strength and resolve. I believe with this perspective we can all move forward together, striving to attain the goal of equal educational opportunity for all American children. I thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity to share my views, and I hope that following the information you will receive today you will have a better understanding of what is being done and what was said, and not allow the media hype to guide and direct the actions of the Senate or the Congress or policymakers of our Nation. Senator Specter. Well, thank you very much, Congresswoman Waters. The object is to provide the best possible education to all Americans, everybody who lives in this country. That is what we want to do. And when you make the comment that the people sound different, there is no doubt about that. And the way a person sounds makes a tremendous impact on that person's opportunity to get a job or to move ahead. And a lot of conclusions are drawn when you hear somebody over the telephone, and as I said in the brief opening comment, very meaningful to me as a child growing up, because my father sounded very different. And some of us sound different by way of our own accents. I still carry a Kansas accent, been trying to get rid of it forever, but I cannot do it. I really do not want to do it. But we very much appreciate your coming here, we appreciate your leadership on the caucus, and we thank you for sharing your words with us. Ms. Waters. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Senator Specter. Thank you. summary statement of carolyn getridge We will now turn to the next panel, Ms. Carolyn Getridge, Ms. Toni Cook and Mr. Michael Lampkins. At the witness table with them will be Jean Quan, board president of the Oakland Unified School District, and Nabeehah Shakir, teacher- coordinator for the Standard English Proficiency Program of the Oakland Unified School District. We very much appreciate your being here. We have set very limited time standards because we do have so many witnesses. But we will understand if you deviate just a bit from them. Our first witness is Ms. Carolyn Getridge, who was appointed superintendent of the Oakland Unified School District in 1994. A career educator, Ms. Getridge has worked in the Oakland schools in a number of positions, including teacher, principal, and administrator of management and development. Thank you very much for joining us here. Ms. Getridge. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I certainly appreciate this opportunity to appear before the subcommittee, and I believe the experiences of the Oakland Unified School District will provide helpful insight into effective strategies to address the underachievement of African-American and other minority students in our public schools. The single guiding goal in our district is to guarantee that conditions exist for all students to achieve academic success. This is our promise in Oakland. We are reinventing public schooling in a most fundamental way, moving beyond the right of students to attend school to a much more profound promise that students have the right to academic achievement in schools. The children of Oakland deserve this right. They include 94 percent children of color; 53 percent are African-American children; 60 percent qualify for free or reduced lunch; and 48 percent come from households which receive aid to families with dependent children. Almost 30 percent have a home language other than English. Our students speak over 80 different languages, of which we formally track 61. Oakland is the sixth-largest school district in the State of California, with over 52,000 students enrolled in our K-12 educational program. Almost 4,000 more children are enrolled in our early childhood education centers, and still another 26,000 adults enroll in adult education courses. The recent actions by the Oakland Unified School District have sparked a national debate concerning the failure of our public schools to effectively serve the educational needs of African-American children and other minority students. The media, however, has diverted attention away from our intent and goal of providing English language development and the more fundamental issue of student achievement in urban school systems. The action of the board is a bold response to a chronic and growing gap between those who are successful in our public schools and those who are not. In our district, for example, the grade point average of African-American students is 1.8 on a 4 point scale, a D plus, while white and Asian students average over 3.0, or a B. The SAT scores show an equally widening gap. African-American students in Oakland score 97 points below the national average in verbal skills, and 110 points below the national average in mathematics. Let me be very clear about the key factor determining success in our public schools. It is not race, it is not innate ability. Rather, it is a combination of factors such as creating an engaging learning environment that is language based and using instructional strategies which enable students to achieve success through effective effort and quality instruction. While there are exceptions, this data clearly paints a picture of an educational system in Oakland which fails a large percentage of students, and unfortunately this pattern of failure is the norm for our Nation's urban school districts. Our current educational practices will not prepare many African-American and other minority students to perform at high levels of achievement in or out of the classroom. In Oakland, we have taken a stand, and stated that this achievement gap is no longer acceptable. What is at issue here is not whether ebonics is a language. This is a scholarly debate for linguists. What is at issue are the steps we as parents, Government leaders, and educational leaders are willing to take to address the chronic underachievement of these students. What are we doing to address these alarming statistics? We have engaged in districtwide reform in our school system. We have established high standards and a rigorous academic curriculum, algebra for all students by the ninth grade, laboratory science in middle schools and high schools, technology and computer classes, and a full 4 years of English for high school students. We have put in place an accountability system from the boardroom to the classroom, and this fall we will widely publish our first school-by-school report card on key academic indicators. But that is not all. In order to achieve these high standards we have had to institute new practices, new ways of teaching. These new ways include a clear recognition of the connection between language, literacy, and learning. Math and science are no longer the gatekeepers determining postsecondary enrollment and success. Language is. Without a mastery of standard English, students are not able to succeed in mathematics and science. This is why we have taken the action we have, and emphasized the linkage between language, literacy, and learning. The Standard English Proficiency Program, or SEP, is one such strategy. SEP represents the application of the principles of English language development for students who bring from home language patterns other than standard English. Does this program work? We think so. At Prescott Elementary School, for example, which has been an early leader in providing SEP strategies in the classroom, students' reading scores are consistently above the district average. Much has been made also of the issue of funding. We are fully committed to the reallocation of our current resources to fund a comprehensive array of strategies to implement districtwide reforms which guarantee all of our students the opportunity for academic success. We have not requested State or Federal funds for this purpose. We do, however, believe that the Federal Government can play a role to support the efforts of urban school districts. First and foremost, expand early childhood education programs for all children aged 3 and 4. Preschool is a proven and cost- effective strategy to improve the education and the life circumstances of children. Second, fund a longer school day and school year to support educational achievement needs of urban youth, and youths throughout this country. Third, expand funding for professional development opportunities, so that we can continue to retool the teacher work force. Senator Specter. Ms. Getridge, you are substantially beyond your time. Can you summarize? prepared statement Ms. Getridge. Yes; I can. I firmly believe we are on the verge of becoming a land of new promise and opportunity. Our educational system is the guarantee for that opportunity. Our moral obligation is to act on the data we have, and take bold steps that we may cross the bridge together into the 21st century. Senator Specter. Thank you very much, Ms. Getridge. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Carolyn M. Getridge Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am grateful for this opportunity to appear before the Subcommittee, which is broadly examining important questions regarding what role the Federal government should play in helping underachieving African-American students improve their academic standing, and exploring effective approaches to teach English language skills. Hopefully, my background as a career educator of thirty years, and now as a Superintendent of an urban school district, the Oakland Unified School District, will provide helpful insight into effective strategies to address the underachievement of African-American and other minority students in our public schools. The recent actions by the Oakland Unified School District have sparked a national debate concerning the failure of our public schools to effectively serve the educational needs of African-American and other minority students. The media focus on ``ebonics'' diverts our attention from the more substantive concerns of English language development, and the more fundamental issue of minority student achievement in urban schools systems. The central issue is the underachievement of African-American and other minority children, and what we are doing to address this dismal record. Current achievement data demonstrate that no urban school district is effectively educating minority students. After thorough research, the Oakland Unified School District has determined a bold plan of action in order to turnaround a situation which for far too long has been tacitly accepted. This testimony is intended to clarify the actions of the Oakland Unified School District and advocate for additional reforms which are required if the educational success of African-American and minority students is to be improved. Although Oakland is the focus of attention, the issues we have surfaced are national in their scope. You cannot talk about issues of educational achievement of African-American children in urban America without also addressing issues of race, class, poverty, language, and immigration. Unfortunately, it is clear from the rhetoric surrounding this issue that we have not yet learned how to deal with the real issues of urban education in a respectful, coherent and logical way. Even in Oakland, which is known as the most integrated city in the United States, we struggle for ways to have this conversation. We have, however, created a teachable moment of national proportion on issues of national urgency. Consequently, we also intend this testimony to add our perspective to solutions which address the underachievement of African-American and other minority children. Our reforms attempt to reform educational processes based on a system of ``sorting'', to a system of ``achieving''. We have fundamentally shifted our thinking from the right of students to attend school, to the right of students to achieve in school. While many of the issues confronting urban American are not of our making, it seems all too often that we, as an urban school district, are the front line for dealing with these issues. We will be better able to deal effectively with these issues if we are afforded the following supports: --First, expand early childhood education programs for all children aged three and four. Preschool is a proven and cost effective strategy to improve the education and life circumstances of children. The expansion will also lead directly to jobs and support systems for the very people impacted by recently enacted welfare reforms; --Second, include funding for schools as part of the various State and Federal urban initiatives and empowerment strategies. For example, urban schools are typically not in a position to fund the physical infrastructure improvements and school building additions required as city demographics shift in response to urban initiatives; --Third, expand funding for professional development opportunities so that we can continue to retool the teacher workforce and address the needs of an influx of new teachers into our schools; and --Finally, fund a longer school day and school year to support the educational achievement needs of urban youth. In return, we will be better able to dedicate our efforts to: --Establish clear and measurable academic standards and public accountability for progress toward those standards; --Institute professional standards for teachers and administrators such as those developed by the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards; and --Develop City-Schools partnerships to mobilize and align resources dedicated to youth initiatives. Furthermore, we can link local strategies together to improve urban education in the following ways: --Establish a National Commission on Urban Education to: --Identify key barriers to improving the quality of urban education, building on recent policy reports; and --Develop strategies to overcome these barriers that take a systemic approach to school reform and build on corporate experiences re-engineering large organizations. --Convene high visibility conferences of urban educators sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, creating the same dynamic as did the U.S. Department of Labor's ``National Labor-Management Conference'' which defined and elevated the best practice and made those practices acceptable to the mainstream. --Hold focused conversations between national and state participants around key areas such as standards so that there is a meshing of state and national standards. --Build a strong strand in the United States Conference of Mayors which links educational leaders of urban education with the work of cities. --Create networks of this nation's proven reform networks, together with the educational leaders who are ultimately responsible for introducing and implementing those reforms into their districts. The Oakland School Board's new policy has touched a nerve across the country. Talk show lines have been jammed and commentators have offered virtually non-stop opinion about the policy. Unfortunately, the reaction is based almost entirely on very basic misinterpretations of the meaning and intent of the policy. In the education that America's public schools provide to minority children, there are many reasons to despair--but this policy is not one of them. Our testimony before this Senate subcommittee is an opportunity to set the record straight, answer specific questions which have been raised, and explore strategies to address the failure of our public schools to educate African-American and other minority students. background On December 18, 1996 the Oakland Unified School District's Board of Education approved a policy affirming Standard American English language development for all students. This policy mandates that effective instructional strategies be utilized to ensure that every child has the opportunity to achieve English language proficiency and academic success. This policy is the result of over eighteen months of thorough research, analysis, and community involvement intended to systematically address the historical underachievement of African- American students in the Oakland Unified School District. Committed to seeking strategies to address this dire situation, the Superintendent of Schools formed The Task Force on the Education of African-American Students to review district-wide achievement data and make recommendations for proven practices that would enhance the opportunity for all students to access and to successfully achieve the core curriculum. The research-based recommendations of this Task Force focus on the direct connection of English language proficiency to student achievement, the unique language needs of many African-American pupils, and the opportunities for parents and the community to support improved academic achievement. The Task Force's research identified the major role language development plays as the primary gatekeeper for academic success. Without English language proficiency students are unable to access or master advanced level course work in the areas of mathematics and science which have traditionally been viewed as the gatekeepers to enrollment in post-secondary education. Language development for African-American students, who comprise 53 percent of students in the Oakland schools, will be enhanced with the recognition and understanding of the language structures unique to many African-American students. This language has been studied by scholars for decades and is referred to as ``Ebonics,'' or ``Pan-African Communication Behaviors,'' or ``African Language Systems.'' The issues of language definition are the domain of linguists, and we did not take a position on whether these language structures are a dialect or a language. Our interest is in guaranteeing that conditions exist for high achievement and research indicates that an awareness of these language patterns by educators helps students build a bridge to Standard American English. A variety of strategies will be employed to support language development and achieve our goal of high academic performance for all students. This focus on English language development is the central recommendation among a framework of recommendations including recommendations for expanding Early Childhood Education programs, strengthening parent and community involvement, improving minority teacher recruitment, and revising district policies and procedures which contribute to increased numbers of students in Gifted and Talented programs and fewer students placed in Special Education. What began as an attempt to bring about important improvements addressing the educational needs of African-American children became lost in a debate about words. Less than a month after the headline in the San Francisco Chronicle exclaimed ``Oakland Schools OK Black English: Ebonics to be regarded as different, not wrong'', it was clear that words had gotten in the way of action. The Task Force was equally clear that the education of children is what matters most, and unanimously amended its resolution to embed the legislative intent into the language of the resolution. This amended resolution was unanimously adopted by the Board of Education at its January 15 meeting. The Task Force recognized that parts of its original work required clarification: --Replaced the term ``genetically based'' with its definition of ``have origins in''; --The definition of ``primary language'' was clarified to mean the language a child brings from home; and --The term ``instruction in their primary language'' was replaced with the intended meaning ``to move students from the language pattern they bring to school to English proficiency''. These changes should reinforce the legislative intent of the Board of Education which is as follows: First, Oakland Unified School District is not replacing the teaching of Standard American English with any other language. The District is not teaching Ebonics. Nothing could be further from the intent of this policy. Our District emphasizes teaching Standard American English and has set a high standard of excellence for all of its students. Second, Oakland is providing its teachers and parents with the tools to address the diverse language needs that children bring into the classroom. This is not new. For over a decade our District has instituted the Standard English Proficiency Program (S.E.P.), a State of California model program, which promotes English-language development for African-American students. The S.E.P. training enables teachers to build on the history, culture, and language skills that many African-American students bring to school. The new Board policy takes these and other proven practices to all schools throughout our District. Third, this policy is not an attempt to reallocate bilingual education funding. We are fully committed to incorporating this training into the professional development of our teachers and, if necessary, redirecting present funds to this end. We have not requested any State or Federal funds for this purpose. The policy does: --Set high standards for English language proficiency and link together effective instructional practices in a comprehensive program; --Enhance and broaden early childhood education programs which have a nationally demonstrated positive educational return for the dollars invested; --Actively recruit minority teachers and strengthen the professional development for teachers; --Organize parents and the community in ways that support high levels of student achievement; and --Revise District procedures and services to reduce the number of African-American students in our Special Education classes, and increase the number of our Gifted and Talented classes. The directions set forth in this policy hold the promise for the positive, sound changes we must make in our nation's schools which historically have failed African-American students. This is Oakland's strategy to improve, not only students' English proficiency, but their overall academic achievement so that they can earn a place in higher education and the world of work. the city of oakland and the oakland unified school district The City of Oakland is situated on the east shore of San Francisco Bay in the northwest area of Alameda County. The Oakland Unified School District serves the educational needs of the City of Oakland and its boundaries are coterminous with the City. The San Francisco Bay Area, the fourth largest metropolitan area in the nation, enjoys a Mediterranean climate. The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge connects the two major cities. It has been said that ``Oakland is the most integrated city anywhere''. According to the 1990 census, the population of Oakland is 372,242 and is composed of at least eighty two languages and eight major ethnic groups. The 1995 California Basic Educational Data System (CBEDS) reported an enrollment of 52,269 for the Oakland Unified School District, making it the sixth largest district in California. The �RM132�number and percent of the populations of both the city of Oakland and the student enrollment of OUSD by ethnic group are shown in the chart below (See also Appendix 1). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- City of Oakland Oakland Unified School -------------------------------- District Ethnic Group ------------------------------- Number Percent Number Percent ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- African-American................................ 163,526 43.9 27,265 52 Asian........................................... 45,879 12.3 9,638 18 Caucasian....................................... 69,138 18.6 3,549 7 Filipino........................................ 7,327 2.0 512 1 Hispanic........................................ 51,711 13.9 10,622 20 Native American/American Indian................. 2,371 0.6 248 1 Pacific Island.................................. 1,725 0.5 435 1 Other........................................... 30,756 8.3 .............. .............. --------------------------------------------------------------- Total..................................... 372,242 100 52,269 100 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- At any given time the Oakland Unified School District provides educational services to approximately 15,600 Limited English Proficient students (30 percent of our student population) who bring with them over sixty different home languages. The major language groups include: Cambodian, Cantonese, Laotian, Mien, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese (Appendix 2). A full breakdown of the student population by Limited English Proficient and Fluent English Proficient is provided in Appendix 3. During the 1995-1996 school year, the school district operated 99 school sites including: two K-3 schools, one K-4 school, six K-5 schools, one 4-8 school, four K-8 schools, forty-seven regularly scheduled elementary schools, twelve elementary schools on year-round schedules, one 7-8 middle school, one 5-8 middle school, four 6-8 middle schools, nine 7-9 junior high schools, six comprehensive senior high schools, one alternative high school, four continuation high schools, three temporary alternative programs, one high school independent study center, one Cyesis center for teenage mothers, and three Exceptional Children's Centers. The language distribution by school and grade is presented in Appendix 4. In addition, four adult education schools serve approximately 26,000 students, twenty five preschools serve approximately 900 students, and forty child development centers plus one elementary school which has ``latch-key'' (before and after school) program that serves approximately 26 students. student achievement The findings on student achievement in Oakland are evidence that the current system is not working for most African-American children (Appendix 5). While 52 percent of the students in the Oakland Unified School District are African-American, only 37 percent of the students enrolled in our Gifted and Talented classes are African-American, and yet 71 percent of the students enrolled in Special Education are African-American. Other findings include the following: --The average grade-point average of African-American students is 1.80 compared to the District average of 2.12, and over 3.0 for white and Chinese students (Appendix 6); --80 percent of all suspended students are African-American (Appendix 7, column 3); --64 percent of students who repeat the same grade are African- American (Appendix 7, column 3); --67 percent of students classified as truant are African-American; and --only 81 percent of the African-American students who make it to 12th grade actually graduate. The achievement test scores for African-American and Hispanic students are the lowest in our District. At our benchmark grade levels, the African-American students score at least 47 percentile points below white students in reading (Appendix 8). While white students have exhibited an upward trend in their scores over the past three years, scores for minority students have remained flat or declined (Appendix 9). the strategic direction of the oakland unified school district The work of the Task Force on the Education of African-American Students is part of a larger strategic effort by the Oakland Unified School District designed to build a system of excellent schools. If we are to move from a system based on ``sorting'' students, to a system based on achievement for all students, our reforms must be district- wide in nature, impacting all schools. We have set out to accomplish this by developing clear and measurable standards benchmarked to worldclass levels of performance, establishing systems of accountability based on objective data, and providing schools and offices with the training, resources, and decision making authority required to achieve this result. This strategic effort builds purposefully on the District's efforts to establish powerful models for whole school change, create strategies to address the life circumstances of our students, and put in place the core curriculum which defines the essential academic standards for student success. The work has been undertaken within a context of enormous demands on, and challenges to the viability of the District. During this period the District successfully emerged from Advisory Trusteeship, resolved a bitter strike without long-term negative consequences to the financial health of the District, and involved parents and community members and organizations in unprecedented numbers and ways. Future and unexpected demands will, no doubt, emerge and challenge us to remain focused on our priority to build a system of excellent schools which work for all students. At this point in time we have established a District which is making positive strides in turning about years of chronic underfunding. We have focused staff, parents, students, and the community on an effective educational program meeting the needs of all children, and we are beginning to see promising signs of improved performance. The primary goal of the school district is to ``Guarantee that conditions exist for student achievement,'' is supported by five additional goals. Our mandate is to build an opportunity structure which enables all students to access the core curriculum and achieve at high levels of performance. Equity of opportunity and high achievement by all students require the establishment of high standards and the uniform implementation of a rigorous academic core curriculum and support programs. In partnership with the Clorox Company Foundation we have embarked upon a district- wide initiative which embodies the principles of the Efficacy Institute as a process for the development of high standards benchmarked to national and State standards and reinforced through Efficacy. We have continued to implement the Core Curriculum adopted by the Board of Education in 1993. The Core Curriculum alignment to achieve these standards is an ongoing process. The 1995 Mathematics textbook adoption resulted in an upgraded Mathematics Curriculum and the publishing of ``Nuts and Bolts,'' a highly acclaimed resource guide for teachers of Mathematics. The English-Language Arts adoption, currently underway has similarly resulted in an enrichment of that curriculum (as evidenced by the standards), and has, for the first time, led to the integration of English Language Development and Bilingual Education. Our focus on early literacy is supported by programs such as Reading Recovery, the Early Literacy Inservice Course, and Standard English Proficiency (SEP) which serve the diverse learning needs of our students and are essential strategies for achieving the goal of all students reading by 3rd grade. The Science Curriculum has also been enhanced through our partnerships with the Bay Area Science and Technology Educational Consortium (BASTEC), and the Leadership Institute for Teaching Elementary Science (LITES). Course requirements have been expanded with a full year of science for 7th grade, and the linking of a semester of science with the TechLab 2000 in 8th grade. This course structure further illustrates the integration of our academic curriculum with a career preparation curriculum. During the past two years academic offerings lost to previous budget reductions have been re-established. These additions include our Music program and our Foreign Language program. We are currently experimenting with a Distance Learning Program for Foreign Language, which, if successful, will enable us to offer language at all schools and achieve our goal of all students being fluent in two or more languages. The Curriculum is supported by the use of technology in instruction and as a tool for learning. All schools are being wired for internet access and two successful NetDays have resulted in a significant number of classrooms connected to computer networks. Recognizing the need for ongoing staff development in this area we have dedicated significant training resources, including the renovation of our training facilities, to prepare staff to use and teach technology. Student success in school is directly related to preschool preparation. We continue to expand our Child Development Centers and the curriculum of these Centers is integrated with our K-12 Curriculum. Our collaborative effort with the City--Oakland 2000--will ensure that preschool children have the intellectual and social skills for success in school. This foundation establishes the essential preparation required if we are to realize our goal of literacy at 3rd grade. Through District and State resources we were able to successfully implement class size reduction of 20:1 in kindergarten and 1st grade. Class size reduction of 20:1 will be expanded to grades kindergarten, two, and three in September, 1997. We also extended the length of the kindergarten school day by 40 minutes to the State maximum. Teacher effectiveness in these reduced size classrooms is being supported by a grant of $280,000 from the State for professional development in literacy. This past school year marked a significant milestone in the District as the Board unanimously passed a resolution for the reconfiguration of grade-levels in our schools to K-5 Elementary Schools, 6-8 Middle Schools, and 9-12 High Schools. This reconfiguration assures parents that their children will receive the same high quality education, no matter which school they attend. Oakland's High Schools are recognized nationally for their Career Academies and we have continued to add programs (most recently the Biotechnology Academy at Fremont High School, and the Shell Program at Castlemont High School. Recognition of our success is evidenced by the awarding of a $650,000 grant from the U.S. Departments of Labor and Education to support the continued expansion of our Academies in the Castlemont attendance area. The Board recently approved a 5-year School-To-Career plan which establishes the strategies to achieve a full integration of career and college preparation in all high schools. The curriculum is bolstered by a continuing expansion of the number and variety of Advanced Placement courses at every high school. Alternative Education programs are provided for students with special circumstances and learning needs. This year the programs have been restructured to better deliver a sound and rigorous educational program. They range from opportunity classes in elementary schools, to independent study. Programs are provided in alternative settings on community college campuses and in collaboration with community agencies such as the East Oakland Youth Development Corporation (EOYDC), the Bay Area Urban League, and Wildcat Camp Ranch House. We also support student success by utilizing our in-district student-run television studio, Channel 13, KDOL, to provide the highly successful homework hotline. The Adult Education Program serves over 26,000 students who are pursuing their high school equivalency, or continuing their education to further their learning or career opportunities. The District's goals define a set of strategic priorities which form the basis of our work in 1997. These priorities include the following: --Finalize Content Standards and Performance Standards in the Spring of 1997. --Adopt Increased High School Graduation Standards in the Spring of 1997. --Implement class size reduction in grades K-3 by Fall of 1997. --Continue to implement the Reconfiguration Plan during 1996-1997 working with local school communities to develop solutions to overcrowding caused by a combination of increased enrollment and greater than planned for class size reductions. --Implement the Middle Grades Program in Fall of 1997. --Expand School-To-Career Academies. --Open and staff the Technology Resource Center. --Establish coursework standards for professional development progression for certificated and classified staff. --Publish the District and Schools Report Card in October of 1997. --Expand the Foreign Language and Music Programs. --Develop a new Special Education Plan. --Develop uniform course descriptions for all Secondary schools. --Implement the newly adopted standardized assessment. --Adopt English Language Arts Instructional Materials. --Implement Summer School Programs and Summer Bridge programs. --Expand the Technology and Career Exploration Course to all High Schools. --Complete of Internet access in 30 remaining elementary schools. --Organize March NetDay. Building a system of excellent schools requires the development of a system of support and services which provide schools and staff with the direction, resources, and solutions they need to deliver high quality instruction in an environment conducive to teaching and learning. The District's organizational structure has been reorganized to focus all activities of the Central Office on service to schools. This means directly connecting the work of central services to results in student achievement. The Curriculum and Instruction functions have been integrated with the line support for schools, and that line support is now based on a model of service. Business Services are aligned to the financial needs of the schools and Facilities Planning has been established to effectively manage the massive increase in facilities resources, both through local bond funds (Measure C) and State Modernization funds. Human Resources has integrated Labor Relations and Personnel functions into a comprehensive strategy. Each Division has engaged in significant redesign work and Departments have worked collectively through the Organizational Improvement Audit to establish performance standards. Purchasing has achieved a level of 98 percent delivery of materials ordered and this department has moved to a computerized system of ordering. Custodial services have been restructured and are now based on standards of service, and accountability to the school. Furthermore, special services have been developed to provide deep cleaning for the year round schools. A system of accountability is being developed, tied to measures of success at the school site. This ensures the alignment of our support services to the requirements of our schools. Accountability is also supported by the establishment of a District Hotline to handle complaints not resolved during the normal operation of our Divisions. There has been an ongoing reallocation of resources from the Central Office to school sites, with the reduction of $1.5 million dollars in administrative costs this past year. Efficiencies have been gained through an aggressive contract management process highlighted by the negotiation of a new telecommunications contract saving $200,000 annually, and the purchase of natural gas through SPURR, a consortium of school districts collectively purchasing natural gas and other fuels. District priorities in the area of organizational effectiveness and efficiency include the following: --Refine measures of customer satisfaction and develop processes to routinely collect that data. --Establish the Accountability Commission. --Assemble and report to the community the District and School report card on performance in October of 1997. --Continue the work of establishing systems of accountability and the monitoring tools necessary to validate results. --Develop school improvement system including school improvement indicators and standards. --Develop and score School Improvement Portfolios based on grade- level rubrics. --Fully implement the School Improvement System initiative by September, 1997. --Develop a strong monitoring plan for site and District office accountability. --Present regular, public reports of the Organizational Improvement Audit. --Expand administration of customer satisfaction surveys (of students/parents) before the end of the year. --Commit to staff training in targeted areas on customer satisfaction. --Develop specific positive recognition programs for spring. language arts curriculum and instruction In 1993 the Oakland Unified School District adopted a rigorous academic core curriculum in the areas of Language Arts, Social Studies, Mathematics, and Science. This was the first step in a continuous process of raising academic standards within our District. The Language Arts Curriculum and Instruction must address the learning needs of all 52,000 students who bring 60 languages to our schools and include components of English language development and bilingual education. The Oakland Unified School District is completing work on a comprehensive program that aligns high standards, quality teaching, and assessment in order to meet the diverse learning requirements of every student. Students who bring to the classroom African-American language patterns, students who have special learning needs, students who are bilingual, students eligible for advanced placement, and English only students will be successful learners as a result of the District's well-aligned core curriculum program. The process to develop the District's core language arts program is broad-based and inclusive. Teachers who represent all of Oakland's diverse classrooms, administrators, parents, students and community members form committees to establish Content and Performance Standards. The Standards are then used as criteria to select textbooks and materials and to focus on effective teaching practices. Based on the ability to measure achievement of the Standards, assessment tools-- standardized tests and performance assessments--are selected or realigned. All instructional staff are trained on the Standards and their linkages to textbooks and materials, support programs and assessment. This comprehensive alignment of the components of effective instruction closes gaps through which students--particularly African- American students--have fallen over the years. The alignment also assures that every student is provided a strong, quality program of instruction that addresses their diverse learning requirements. Content and performance standards, which form the basis for the design of this comprehensive curricular program, are based on the National Council of Teachers of English/International Reading Association (NCTE/IRA) standards, the work of the New Standards Project, and the California Challenge Standards. Oakland's drafts of the Content and Performance standards reflect the range of language diversity in Oakland and are applicable to all students. The Standards (see Appendix 10 for examples of the Standards) are organized into the following categories: Reading; Literature, Public, and Functional Documents; Writing; Speaking, Listening, and Viewing; Media Literacy; and Student/Teacher Collaborative Assessment. The comprehensive Language Arts textbook and instructional materials adoption process, scheduled for completion in April, will result in textbooks and materials for the following curricular strands (see Appendix 11 for a summary of the textbook and materials process and selection criteria): English/Language Arts (ELA); English Language Development (ELD); Spanish Bilingual (grades K-5); and Advanced Placement English (grade 12). The new language arts textbooks and materials are designed to enable students to master the reading, writing and speaking standards with greater proficiency and success than in past years. Briefly, the materials focus on: --Phonics.--The explicit learning of phonics, sound-symbol correspondence, letter patterns, semantic cues and grammar in the context of language derived from the readings. --Vocabulary and Comprehension.--Instruction in a variety of comprehension and critical thinking strategies that expand vocabulary and develop reading depth. --Writing.--Lessons that stress writing as a process and offer opportunities for writing for different audiences and purposes. --Speaking and Listening.--Lessons that help students deliver formal and informal speeches and oratorical events, and teach them to listen responsively and observe the customs of courteous discussion. --Literature.--Richly multicultural and diverse materials address social issues, and cultivate, positive human value, and provide good role models. --Study of Language Diversity.--Materials that stress the study of, and respect for, diversity in language use, patterns, and dialects across cultures, ethnic groups, geographic regions and social roles, and are able to adapt to language use for audience and purpose. Support programs, integrated with the adopted textbooks and instructional materials include, but are not limited to, the following: --Standard English Proficiency Program (S.E.P.).--S.E.P. is a cultural-linguistic program that empowers African-American students with knowledge and understanding of African-American culture and languages. Classroom instruction demonstrates the differences in language spoken in the student's home and standard English. The language students bring into the classroom is embraced and a bridge is constructed to standard English. --Bilingual: Sheltered and SDAIE.--Students receive, based on diagnosed needs, English language development instruction in the core language arts program through primary language (Spanish, Chinese, Cambodian, and Vietnamese), sheltered instruction, or Specifically Designed Academic Instruction in English (SDAIE) and instruction which promotes the student's self-esteem and cross-cultural understanding. --Strategies for Special Needs Students.--Through the Individual Educational Program (IEP) process, students receive adapted materials (such as large print materials, interpreters for the deaf, specialized computer keyboards, etc.), pull-out instruction, assistance in the regular classroom, special day classes, non-public schools, etc. --Early Literacy Inservice Course (ELIC).--ELIC provides staff training which includes topics such as: diagnosis of reading deficiencies, structure of the English language, research on how deficient readers read, planning and delivery of appropriate reading instruction based on assessment and evaluation, relationships between reading, writing, and spelling, and means of improving reading comprehension. --Advanced Placement.--Beginning in 9th grade, teachers are provided training and students are provided support in order to increase the number of students, particularly students who are historically underrepresented in intensive, advanced placement courses. The content and performance standards also formed the criteria for the selection of a new standardized assessment program. The adopted test, TerraNova, more accurately assesses the extent to which all students are successfully achieving the standards. Performance assessments will also be designed and/or acquired to measure student progress toward, and the achievement of, the standards. These assessments are an important component of an integrated system of assessments which provide the teacher and student with valuable feedback to improve teaching and learning. Student work is collected in portfolios, performances, and projects, and assessed through the use of rubric-based criteria. The implementation of the Language Arts core curriculum, textbooks and instructional materials, support programs, and assessments requires intensive and ongoing staff development. Generally, the staff development will focus on the following: --The implementation of the new textbooks and instructional materials; --The diverse language requirements of all of Oakland's students and unique support strategies to meet those requirements (e.g. S.E.P., bilingual, sheltered instruction, SDAIE, ELIC, and special needs); --The linkages between standards, assessment, textbooks and materials, support programs, and staff development; --Oral language development; --Goals 2000: Early Literacy Requirements; --Literacy integrated through all subjects; --Reading development at the middle and high school levels; --Assessment: implementation of the new standardized assessment and the development of performance assessments. implementation plan The research and recommendations of the Task Force on the Education of African-American Students are to be integrated into the strategic direction and Curriculum and Instruction plans of the Oakland Unified School District (Appendix 13). The resolution and implementation plan require the Oakland Unified School District to develop and implement an education program which supports high academic achievement by African- American students. Central to this program shall be the utilization of effective instructional strategies to ensure that every child has the opportunity to achieve English language proficiency. The development and implementation of this program be monitored by the Task Force for the Education of African-American Students. The task force will also participate in the development of a communications strategy supporting the implementation of the recommendations. Subcommittees, consisting of Task Force members, as well as teachers, parents, students, community members, and staff assigned by the Superintendent, will be convened to specify the programs, practices, professional development, parent and community involvement, and other activities which shall constitute the recommended education program. One subcommittee will be convened to address the following components of the Educational Program: --Establishment of a comprehensive program for English language development, building on and incorporating Standard English Proficiency (S.E.P.), and including assessments, materials, instructional strategies, staff development plan for the phased-in training of certificated and classified staff, and the parent, family, and community education required to implement that program. --Enhancement of a comprehensive program for Early Childhood Education to strengthen linkages with, and broaden, existing effective programs and practices, such as Project 2000. --Review of existing procedures and instructional strategies for GATE and Special Education and recommend revisions which address the disproportionate over or under representation by African- American students. --Establishment of strategies to strengthen school-to-career preparation, workplace learning opportunities, and placement through career, job, and college fairs. --Identification of a recruitment plan to increase the number of African-American teachers and counselors employed, and increase the number of African-American students enrolled in teacher certification programs. A second subcommittee will be convened to recommend a comprehensive plan for parent and community involvement in the education of African- American students and the strategies required to implement that plan. This subcommittee will include in this plan the establishment of a speakers bureau, community sponsored educational programs, and linkages with community service agencies and existing effective programs and practices. A third subcommittee will be convened to review existing support services and recommend a comprehensive structure for support services, and psychological and social services. These recommendations will include linkages with existing effective programs and practices provided by the City of Oakland, Alameda County, and Community-Based Organizations. This review will also include existing District services such as, Food Services, and make recommendations, if needed, for improvements in those services. Based on the work of these subcommittees, the Task Force will make funding recommendations which will be considered as part of the annual budget development process. The District will also develop a process to annually evaluate instructional practices and support services to determine their effectiveness in increasing the academic achievement of African-American students. role of the federal government Our efforts to guarantee that conditions exist for student achievement will be enhanced by a strong and coordinated support strategy linking state and federal resources with our local initiatives. Within existing resources we have the capacity to develop and implement innovative and promising practices. What we do not have the capacity to do is to unilaterally expand services to groups of children not currently served by the funding allocations provided to our District. Nor do we have the capacity to serve as a conveyor or clearinghouse linking together resources from across the country. Federal support enables us to move from pilot programs and small-scale projects to system-wide initiatives which move best practice to scale. If we are to achieve our goal of high achievement by all students, we must implement our reforms system-wide. Several enhancements to the current educational system will support our efforts. First, early childhood education programs should be expanded for all children aged three and four. Preschool is a proven and cost effective strategy to improve the education and life circumstances of children. The expansion will also lead directly to jobs and support systems for the very people impacted by recently enacted welfare reforms. Second, funding for various State and Federal urban initiatives and empowerment strategies should include funding for new schools. For example, urban schools are typically not in a position to fund the physical infrastructure improvements and school building additions required as city demographics shift in response to urban initiatives. Third, funding for professional development opportunities is essential so that we can continue to retool the teacher workforce and address the needs of an influx of new teachers into our schools. These funds are typically above and beyond the base funding for direct instructional services to students. Finally, funding a longer school day and school year will support the educational achievement needs of urban youth. At present we link together on a piecemeal basis various city and community-based projects to service some of our youth in after-school, weekend, and summer programs. The systematic expansion of instructional time will ensure that all children have access to opportunities for higher achievement. Furthermore, the Federal government can link local strategies together to improve urban education. We have identified several ways to achieve this linkage. First, establish a National Commission on Urban Education to identify key barriers to improving the quality of urban education, building on recent policy reports; and develop strategies to overcome these barriers that take a systemic approach to school reform and build on corporate experiences re-engineering large organizations. Second, convene high visibility conferences of urban educators sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, creating the same dynamic as did the U.S. Department of Labor's ``National Labor- Management Conference'' which defined and elevated best practice and made those practices acceptable to the mainstream. Third, hold focused conversations between national and state participants around key areas such as standards so that there is a meshing of state and national standards. Fourth, build a strong strand in the United States Conference of Mayors which links educational leaders of urban education with the work of cities. And finally, create networks of this nation's proven reform networks, together with the educational leaders who are ultimately responsible for introducing and implementing those reforms into their districts. conclusion The low level of African-American student achievement is well documented and represents a national crisis. Solutions which reverse the educational, social, and economic fortunes of African-American youth will require a concerted effort between our nation's communities, our school systems, and our governmental agencies at the city, state, and national level. In our efforts to address these serious issues, we stumbled briefly over a choice of words used to convey the intent of our direction, and we have corrected these flaws in our original resolution. If anything, however, this national debate does, indeed, signal the importance of words and language. Even as we move beyond words, however, there is something deeply disturbing about the tone and tenor of the ``ebonics'' debate which has gripped the newspapers and airwaves of this country. More ink has been spilled in twenty five days debating this issue than has been spent in the entire thirteen years since the publication of the landmark report, A Nation At Risk, addressing the failure of our public schools to educate minority children. This is not an Oakland problem. It is a national problem. The actions of the Oakland Board of Education have elevated the level of the debate on the education of African-American children. I welcome this debate and I am confident that, as a result, we will move Oakland and the nation to an open discussion of the connection between language and literacy. We must confront this issue head on. The New York Times reported this past week on the growing gap in achievement between white and minority students. These statistics are both mind-numbing and a cause for moral outrage. Katie Haycock, Executive Director of the Education Trust, which produced the report, stated that, ``There are schools that are able to overcome the problems of urban life and get terrific results. The question is when are we going to make them the rule and not the exceptions. We think kids are achieving at low levels not because of poverty or because their parents are less well educated, but because we're systematically teaching them less.'' The question is not, whether or not we must act; rather we are confronted by questions about how best to act, and how quickly can we act? The answers to these questions are not simple and they are not comforting. Quite to the contrary, the answers to these questions challenge some of the fundamental assumptions we have about the purpose and design of education. The strategies set forth by the Task Force on the Education of African-American Students provide us with the tools to instill high standards, institute a rigorous academic curriculum, and improve. instruction. The recommendations establish English language proficiency as the foundation for competency in all academic areas. Passage of this policy is a clear demonstration that the Oakland Unified School District is committed to take actions to turn around the educational achievement of its African-American students. Our focus on African-American student achievement is all the more compelling because of the fact that if we find ways to help the least successful students, we will benefit all of our students. Every moment lost is a child lost. In the midst of this debate, our community has stood together and proclaimed that the loss of a single child is no longer acceptable. I leave it to the conscience of America to move our country beyond this debate and focus on issues of educational improvement.

The Standard English Proficiency Program (S.E.P.) is a cultural- linguistic program which empowers African-American students with knowledge and understanding of African and African-American culture and languages. Classroom instruction demonstrates the differences in the language spoken in the student's home and standard English. The teacher and school community embrace the language the students bring to the classroom and build a bridge to standard English. The teacher and school community acknowledge and understand the student's language. Students may cross the bridge from the language they speak to standard English with pride and dignity. The student understands and accepts the need to be able to communicate effectively in standard English in appropriate situations. The framework of the curriculum includes a variety of teaching methods and literary genre to prepare students for the global economy of the 21st century. why sep? Many children, even before the age of five, learn an intricate system of language. They are able to construct sentences, ask questions, select appropriate pronouns and form negation using the structure (syntax, phonology, and grammar) of the language system to which they are born (Fromkin/Rodman, 1974). Basically, children are not taught language in the sense that they are taught arithmetic. They learn it by themselves and as long as it is spoken around them, they seem to mirror the language of their environment. Since language is learned by children whether or not it is taught to them, and since they model the language and dialects of their immediate environment as well as the values and behaviors fostered in that environment, all language, then, mirrors the environment in which it is used regardless of race or social status; and children, unless neurologically or physically handicapped, enter school with a language system that is reflective of their cultural milieu. For many Black children, this system is euphemistically called Black English.\\1\\ Because of the negative connotation often associated with the term ``Black English,'' the State Department of Education elected to use the term ``Black Language.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Black English is generally used as an euphemism for nonstandard English, or vernacular English. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Succinctly, Black Language connotes a system that embodies communication styles, intonation, body language, structure, and grammar. In addition, various studies support the notion that Black Language derives from a bona fide language system with its own semantic grammatical and phonological structure. Yet, the origin of Black Language is as controversial today as the origin of language itself and no one theory seems to earn consensus in the field of linguistics. Therefore, the concern of the Standard English Program is not with the language system, per se, or its origin; but rather, it is with the recognition of the system in helping Black children learn standard English.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Standard English refers to that pattern of English which is more culturally valued and therefore, has a higher level of prestige or status associated with it. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Standard American English is constantly enriched by words, phrases, and usages originating in Black language, whatever its origin, is one of the many dialects of English, influenced by the changes which go on in other dialects. A key problem in understanding differences in American English and positively respond to them, is the adverse social attitudes associated with so called non-standard dialects. Unfortunately, many teachers tend not to evaluate or judge language on the basis of its efficiency as a unique means of communication. Typically, language is treated as good or bad, right or wrong, and is usually based on the social status which specific language patterns tend to enjoy among the high-status people in the communities (Goodman, 1971), (Williams and Whitehead, 1971). It is important for teachers involved with students who speak Black Language to have an awareness of the peculiarity of Black Language in their culture and recognize that their language is an integral part of the culture; any antagonistic or demeaning criticism of their language is a direct attack on the student, the culture, and the society (Cromack, 1971). In other words, the perception of the student's language as inferior is by implication the perception of the student and his culture as inferior. Black Language and standard English share most lexical forms and rules; the systematic differences are easily understood and can be readily taught in the classroom setting. The major obstacles to language learning may be teacher attitude and acceptance. Although a statement by Kochman may be somewhat limited, it undoubtedly rings of truth: The inescapable social truth of the matter is that people's attitudes toward other people's speech are merely extensions of people's attitudes toward their culture and the people of that culture (88). Perhaps more important than awareness of the sociopsychological aspects of language is an understanding of the linguistic merits of non-standard dialects.\\3\\ No language is more superior than another; they exist to be meaningful, and are ``equally adopted to the needs of those who use them'' (Hymes, 46). Basically, the linguistic viewpoint if clear--all communities develop a language that is a well-ordered system with a predictable sound pattern, grammatical structure, and vocabulary. Further, in that the language fulfills the communication requirements of the community, it is structurally as good as any other language (Baratz, 1969). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ Dialect is a descriptive term used by linguists in reference to language variety. In some parlance, dialect is defined as a ``variety of a language generally and mutually intelligible with other varieties of that language but set off from them by a unique complex features of pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Without question, language is the basis for communication, and in western society, communication plays an important role in the determination of an individual's educational, social and vocational success. To the extent that standard English is the language of commerce both here and abroad, and to the extent that the futures of black students are not confined to any one community by dint of their language, it is imperative that they also learn the standard English dialect. Toward this goal, the Standard English Program is designed to assist school-level administrators and classroom teachers and parents in expanding the language skills of s"
