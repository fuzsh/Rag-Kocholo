        "text": "The doctor told JoAnn Brown the flat-out truth about her newborn baby boy: Something is seriously wrong. Don’t expect him to live very long.\n\nJoAnn figured right there at Jasper County Hospital that she’d take every day the good Lord gave her with her son. She never dreamed she’d get so many days.\n\nOn April 11, 1957, Dale Francis Brown was born by cesarean birth. It’s a good thing. A natural birth may have killed him. Dale was born with a severe form of osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disorder also called brittle bone disorder, characterized by bones broken extremely easily.\n\n“Dale was awful fragile,” said JoAnn, of Rensselaer. “He screamed in pain every time we picked him up. So we didn’t hold him any more than we had to.” Dale learned how to suck on a bottle alone, lying on his side, never cradled in his mother’s bosom like other babies.\n\nEven the gentlest of contact could break his bones. And it did, often. He broke hundreds of bones as a child, sometimes just moving around in his crib. “We hoped to God we didn’t hurt him,” said JoAnn, a small woman who also was born with serious health ailments. “But he mended fast.” As a first-time mother, she devised a way to pick up her baby without touching him, by lifting him in a blanket underneath from both sides. Sometimes, just changing his diaper broke his tiny bones. They’d know by either hearing something crack, or watching Dale’s face contort in pain and scream out.\n\nCasts were out of the question. They were too heavy and his bones would just break again anyway. Dale also didn’t grow like other babies, other children, other adults. His body never grew past three feet or so, with his tiny, useless legs all twisted and deformed from countless broken and mended bones. When Dale was 3 months old, a local doctor gave JoAnn advice she took to heart.\n\n“Don’t treat your child any differently than you would a normal child,” he told her. “Wherever you go, he goes.” The Browns did just that. As an infant and toddler, Dale was unable to walk or even sit up, so his father, Donald, carried him around in makeshift baskets, cradles, and strollers. One was made of wood, with metal handles and a bungee cord to keep Dale from falling. Donald worked for nearly 40 years at a local factory. His muscular, tattooed right arm hauled Dale just about everywhere — the grocery store, Sunday church, out to eat, weekend auctions, you name it.\n\nThis carried on for years, then decades. As a baby, Dale slowly learned how to feed himself with his tiny hands, but always while lying down, on his side so he wouldn’t choke. The young couple improvised everything, from how to burp their fragile-as-glass baby to how to rock him to sleep. They were old enough to care for him and young enough not be daunted by what they faced.\n\n“We just did what we thought was right, like any parent would do,” JoAnn explained. When Dale was 22 months old, a local nurse suggested the couple take him to the Shriners Hospital for Children in Chicago. There, they can see specialists. There, they can meet other parents in their shoes. There, they can figure out what causes Dale’s bones to break and retard his growth. So they did. Every Thursday was “brittle bone day,” when they could afford to make the trip. But they never found the cause. They never really cared.\n\nTheir son’s breakable body may have been shortchanged by genetics, or by God, but his intelligence wasn’t. “He had above normal smartness,” said Dale’s father, Donald, a quiet man who spends words like they’re $50 bills. “I was always proud of that.” The couple also was proud of Dale’s first words of normalcy — “Mommy” and “Daddy.” No one knows for sure An estimated 50,000 people in the United States have osteogenesis imperfecta, sometimes causing skeletal deformities like short stature, scoliosis and bowing of long bones. It’s caused by the body’s lack of production of type I collagen, a major protein of the body’s connective tissue.\n\nThink of it as if the framework of a new house is built with thin balsa wood, not thick plywood. Even the slightest wind could make it snap. Type I, the mildest form of the disorder, is the most common. Dale had Type III, the most severe, and no one knows for sure how many others live with it. Many of those with Type III die in early childhood or adolescence from pulmonary complications. Not Dale.\n\nAs a young child, the Shriners doctors inserted metal rods into Dale’s major bones to keep them intact. They surgically placed one in his shoulder and arm, for example. It didn’t work. Dale’s bones still broke too easily, and at least one time a metal rod poked through his tender shoulder. JoAnn pulled it out herself. Dale didn’t flinch. Pain seemed as natural to him as breathing. He rarely complained.\n\nTwo years after Dale was born, he had a sister, Tammy. Four years after that, a brother, Kerry. Neither was born with the disorder. And both quickly learned how to help take care of their big brother. “They were never jealous of the attention Dale got,” JoAnn said from her dining room table. “They helped carry him and care for him.” At age 6, Dale started school with several different teachers visiting his home daily, teaching him the three Rs through the years. He had trouble holding big text books, but he picked up everything else fast. His parents and siblings gave him hand-held games to play, along with crossword puzzles and magazines. He even learned how to crotchet.\n\nJoAnn still keeps a toaster cover and pot holder in her kitchen.\n\nAt age 9, Dale celebrated first communion with other Catholic kids his age. His proud parents still have photos of the public event in August, 1966. But not all the townspeople were receptive to Dale and his pint-sized situation in society. “Some people were dumb,” JoAnn said bluntly, still hurt after all these years. For example, one of Dale’s home-school teachers began taking him into school to visit the other students, until a few parents complained, insisting their children didn’t like Dale there. “It wasn’t the children, it was the parents,” JoAnn hissed. “The children loved Dale.”\n\nDale had no close friends, but everyone seemed to be his friend. And if some kids stared or giggled, he laughed it off. Emotional standing ovation As a teenager, Dale stayed mostly at home, in the same house his parents still live now, just north of town. His small bedroom was filled with Peanuts characters, like Snoopy telling him to “Keep Smiling.” And he did. Often. His family thought his facial muscles would get sore from all his smiling. They never did. Except when his family went camping. Dale hated camping. Imagine having bugs flying around you and not being able to swat them away. Or being stuck in the heat, or the sun.\n\n“That was the only time I remember him really complaining,” his sister recalled.\n\nAt age 14, he wrote a poem that still hangs in his bedroom, “A Poem About Cigarettes.” “I am very alarmful, for cigarettes are very harmful,” he wrote. It’s in this bedroom where JoAnn and Donald did everything for Dale — dress him every day, cook him every meal, carry him to the bathroom every time — without thinking twice about it. Joann did so during the day when Donald worked, and Donald took over during the night when JoAnn worked. “You do what you have to do,” Donald said matter-of-factly. In 1976, when Dale was 19, he planned on graduating high school from his home, his only classroom.\n\nWhen officials from Rensselaer Central High School invited him to take part in the official graduation ceremony, it surprised the family, and Dale.\n\nFinally, he would be one of the students. The ceremony began with less pomp and more circumstance when the first graduate’s name was called — “Dale Francis Brown.”\n\nHe couldn’t believe it. And neither could his family. First, just one fellow graduate rose, then another, then the entire graduating class sprung to its feet in applause. Then every guest, every parent, every teacher stood to applaud. Dale’s parents were floored. Their son — who never once stood on his own — received an emotional standing ovation. “There wasn’t a dry eye,” said Tammy, who played flute in the school band that night.\n\nFast-forward 30 years. Donald recalled this special night for his son and he still can’t keep a dry eye. All he could muster to say to me was the word “proud.” Three times. JoAnn even pulled out Dale’s diploma to validate their pride. It wasn’t needed.\n\nSomething missing — freedom\n\nAfter high school, Dale tried learning tax accountant work, but the books were too heavy to lift and his mother’s poor health made it hard for her to carry him to college or a local accountant. So Dale retired to home. His calendars found their way into the trash, 1980, 1985, 1990. Dale’s short body didn’t grow length-wise but he did gain weight, getting up to 70 pounds. Lifting him got more difficult and his parents eventually bought him a wheelchair. JoAnn had hip surgery several years back and simply couldn’t lift him any more. Donald retired in 1992, yet he still hauled his son in and out of bed, into the bathroom, into the American Legion for bingo, and everywhere else, just like the doctor suggested decades ago. Dale’s little brother, Kerry, defined the fatherly act as “pure determination, nothing less.”\n\nTammy noted, “My dad was Superman.” Dale eventually found the joys of a home computer, playing video games and sending e-mails to everyone he knew. He celebrated his 40th birthday at the same American Legion and planned to return there for his 50th. He was content and cared for, but something was missing. His freedom. “He wanted to experience life more on his own,” said Kerry, 43, who lives in Lafayette. “He yearned for it,” said Tammy, 47, who lives in Flora, east of Lafayette. So four years ago, at age 46, Dale made the decision to move into the Rensselaer Care Center, an assisted living facility.\n\n“We didn’t want him to go but he made up his mind,” JoAnn said. “He felt like he was a burden to us,” Donald said. “But he wasn’t, never was, not once.” ‘I’m just tired’ At the care center, Dale used a motorized wheelchair to zip around the hallways, a luxury he didn’t have inside his small home. He went through two battery chargers there. His parents visited him daily, bringing him snacks like Burger King chicken tenders.\n\nThey usually found him using the center’s computer, or chatting with his all-time favorite nurse and close friend, Lisa Stone. Stone was the only nurse Dale trusted to lift him alone. She bought him DVDs on eBay. She went shopping for him to buy Mother’s Day gifts for JoAnn. She helped him play bingo, his favorite game. The two e-mailed each other often. Dale even had her autographed photo on his wall.\n\n“There was just something about him,” Stone said. “He was so happy to be alive. He was the sweetest, most compassionate person I ever met.” “I loved him.” On Dec. 8, 2006, Dale battled a lingering cold. He stayed in bed all day and not once made it to his beloved computer.\n\n“Dale, what’s wrong?” Stone asked him. “I think this cold is getting to me,” he replied. Around 8 p.m., Stone tucked him in for the night. In the hallway she passed his parents. JoAnn and Donald arrived to make plans for his Christmas homecoming. They too were surprised he was still in bed. “Dale, what’s wrong?” his mother asked. “I’m just tired,” Dale replied. His parents tucked him in and said goodbye, thinking he needed a good’s night sleep.\n\nAt 4:30 a.m. the next morning, JoAnn got a phone call. Dale died. No one knew why. “He lived this long. We figured he’d live a lot longer,” his brother said. “He was so healthy,” his sister said. “He hardly ever saw a doctor.” Later, one doctor told the family that Dale’s loving heart was simply too big for his little body.\n\nAn autopsy was suggested but his parents said no. “He hurt enough during his life,” JoAnn reasoned. “I don’t want him hurting any more.”\n\nOddly enough, Dale’s obituary in the local newspaper was shorter than most others: “Dale Francis Brown of Rensselaer, 49, passed away early Saturday, December 9, 2006 at the Rensselaer Care Center.\n\nBrown was born in Rensselaer on April 11, 1957 to Donald and JoAnn (Stalbaum) Brown.” But Dale’s impact in those 49 years looms tall, very tall. ‘We want the world to know’ Dale was eulogized at Jackson Funeral Chapel, in town. He was buried at nearby Memory Gardens Cemetery. A steady stream of old friends, former teachers and total strangers attended his funeral. Many echoed the same line: “Thank you for sharing Dale with us.”\n\nMore than 100 sympathy cards arrived out of nowhere. The family was touched beyond words. But not Lisa Stone, Dale’s favorite nurse. In a long handwritten letter, she wrote, “You were my best friend, my strength and my pride, only God may know why, but I will get by… I’m sorry I never told you all I wanted to say. Never had I imagined you leaving without just a good-bye.”\n\nIn a memorial service held later at the care center, Donald couldn’t keep his emotions under wrap any longer. “He lost it,” JoAnn said. Donald, a proud and deeply hurt man, is still reeling from losing Dale. He misses carrying around his son, despite his age. “He kept us all together.”\n\nThis past week, Tammy told me, “Dale was my hero. He taught me patience, compassion and how to laugh at hardship.” Tammy’s two teenage sons also learned from Dale. When they now see someone in a wheelchair, they don’t stare, giggle, or turn away, like teens once did with Dale.\n\n“They rush to help them,” she said. “That’s because of Dale.” Before I left JoAnn and Donald’s home, where Dale’s bedroom is still pretty much intact, I turned to ask one final question. Why? Why did you allow me to write about your son? “We want the world to know about our son,” JoAnn told me. “The world missed who he was and now we miss him too.”"
