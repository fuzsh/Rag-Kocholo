        "text": "Cokie Roberts of ABC News joins Jim in studio. She has been named Louisiana Humanist of the Year. \"This is very special,\" she says. She was born in New Orleans as \"Mary Martha.\" Both of her parents were politicians. Her mother and father, Lindy and Hale Boggs, were both Democratic Congresspeople in Louisiana. She speaks about their careers.\n\nRoberts has a new book already on the bestsellers list, Capital Dames and the role of women in politics.\n\nHer father, Hale Boggs, was presumably killed in a plane crash in Alaska. Roberts recalls the event.\n\n\"I'm the only one left of the original gang,\" Roberts says, \"We were a fivesome, and we did everything together.\"\n\n\"At the end of it, I wanted to slit my wrists,\" Roberts says of her latest book.\n\n\"I don't think there's anybody left like her,\" she says of her mother, \"she was so tough and so persistent, it was easier just to say yes the first time to her.\"\n\nShe comments on Loretta Lynch and the human trafficking bill. Loretta Lynch is the first African American woman to become United States Attorney General.\n\n\"It's not a done deal,\" Roberts says of Hillary Clinton, \"she's basically running against herself.\"\n\nShe has been married to her husband Steve for 49 years.\n\n\"It's mind boggling how quickly people change their minds on this subject,\" Roberts says of gay marriage. \"To young people, being gay is about as interesting as being left handed.\"\n\nBaton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore talks with Jim today about his career as an investigative attorney. \"Since I saw some really bad things at the start, you really have to find a switch,\" he says as a way to deal with the things he has seen. February had zero murders. \"An hour and fifteen minutes after midnight, someone was killed,\" he says of the end of February.\n\nMoore comments on the budget crisis and that \"education should be priority.\" He also adds that more money needs to be added in crime prevention.\n\nHe comments on police legitimacy. They discuss the recent news about inappropriate relations between teachers and students.\n\nCollis Temple Jr. joins Hillar Moore to talk to specific groups of at risk people for murder. They are 900% more at risk to kill or be killed than anyone else in Baton Rouge.\n\nColonel Rob Maness who received 14% of the vote in the senate elections joins the show to discuss his conservative views. He comments on the national budget and his ideas on how to improve the national security strategies.\n\nWhen asked if he would run for federal office, Maness says, \"We'd like to keep our options open.\"\n\nManess discusses his views on the national debt.\n\n\"Giving out free community college when you have the opportunity to work for it? I don't think so,\" says Maness.\n\nA listener says the United States went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan \"on a credit card.\" Maness responds, \"I call on Congress and our President to put our country into a declared state of war.\" He continues, \"As a country and as a people, we have to get right with our own citizens and our own law.\"\n\nManess comments on the Measles Outbreak and the question of vaccinations. \"We think the vaccination system worked very well in our family... We all have different opinions, and mine is that it works.\"\n\n\"Choose the opportunity,\" Maness says, \"Don't worry about getting free money.\""
