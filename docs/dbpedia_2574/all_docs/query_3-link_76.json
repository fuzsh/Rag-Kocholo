        "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, MI – An author and former longtime professor at Calvin College is being remembered for his contributions as a scholar, and for being a friend to many.\n\nDale Brown, 65, died Friday, Oct. 10 in Tennessee after suffering injuries from a bicycle accident earlier in the week, according to online information provided by his family at caringbridge.org.\n\nBrown was an English professor at Calvin College for about 20 years before moving to Bristol, Tenn. in 2007 to work as the founding director of the Buechner Institute at King University.\n\n\"I looked at my career, and I figured I had 10 years left,” Brown told The Grand Rapids Press in 2007 when discussing his work and move. \"I wanted to spend it with different challenges. This move feels right and is a nice challenge.”\n\nThe Buechner Institute, named for author Frederick Buechner, focuses on the intersection of faith and culture, according to the university's website.\n\nThe subject was a long-term interest for Brown, who previously directed the Calvin College Festival of Faith and Writing and considered Buechner a mentor.\n\nBrown wrote several books on the topic, including “The Book of Buechner: A Journey Through His Writings,” “Of Faith & Fiction,” and “Conversations with American Writers: The Doubt, The Faith, The In-Between.”\n\nAside from his scholastic work, former Calvin College student and colleague Jane Zwart said he was a thoughtful and passionate teacher, and good person overall.\n\n“Dale had a knack for making people braver and more generous,” Zwart said in an email. “In the classroom, he inspired students because he knew so much and because, at the same time, he was so sure that what they knew or intuited wasn't slight or silly.”\n\n“In conversation, he was wickedly funny and unfailingly kind.”\n\nZwart originally started a giveforward.com campaign to aid in Brown's care following the accident. Now, the money will go to support his family, she said.\n\nA post on the family's caringbridge.org page thanked supporters for their contributions.\n\nFollowing his death, Anne Brown, Dale Brown’s daughter, described her father’s contributions to everyone he met, in a post on the site.\n\n“Dale lived with ferocity of mind, tenacity of spirit, and wicked wit,” she said. “He will be missed.”\n\nA memorial service will be held at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday at King University in Tennessee, according to caringbridge.org.\n\nThe family requests that any donations be made to support the remaining academic year's programming at the Buechner Institute."
