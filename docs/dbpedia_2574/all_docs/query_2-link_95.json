        "text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — There’s no scoreboard for joint practices, but there was no question the Detroit Lions won the first day against the New York Giants during training camp last year. Decisively.\n\nThe Lions’ aggression and intensity seemed to stun the Giants, who struggled to function offensively. The battle was more equal on the second day, but the first impression sent a message. The season confirmed the teams were heading in opposite directions, as the Lions surged to the NFC Championship Game while the Giants stumbled to a 6-11 record.\n\nThe teams will renew acquaintances this week, with the Giants hosting the Lions for joint practices on Monday and Tuesday before they square off in their preseason opener on Thursday.\n\n“They practice real hard. (Lions coach) Dan Campbell has them boys going over there. We know that,” Giants wide receiver Isaiah Hodgins said. “We know that it’s going to be a physical practice, there’s going to be a lot of chirping and talking and everything. But it’s a different team this year. I think we’re going to be ready for it. (Giants coach Brian Daboll) has put a real good emphasis on starting fast.”\n\nBeyond matching the Lions’ intensity, the two practices will allow the Giants to evaluate their players against one of the best rosters in the NFL. Joint practices provide the best preseason measuring stick because most teams dial back their starters’ participation in exhibition games.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nGiants stock report: Who's trending up, who's down heading into preseason?\n\nHere’s a position-by-position breakdown of what to watch when the Giants match up with the Lions:\n\nQuarterback\n\nIt’s foolish to make major evaluations about a sixth-year quarterback in a non-contact practice, but that won’t stop everyone from overreacting to how Daniel Jones looks over the next two days. It would be encouraging to see Jones have the offense operating at a higher level than in the first joint practice with the Lions a year ago, but the quarterback was mostly excellent last summer before the worst season of his career. So practice performance should be kept in perspective.\n\nJones can benefit from reps with a new supporting cast against a foreign defense, but he’ll still be wearing a red non-contact jersey. The real evaluation for Jones won’t come until he’s facing a live pass rush in regular-season games.\n\nRunning back\n\nRunning back is one of the hardest positions to evaluate in practices since ball carriers can’t be tackled to the ground. The biggest takeaway from these practices could be gaining a better sense of the pecking order behind No. 1 back Devin Singletary. The running backs have been rotating frequently early in camp, but the coaches likely will want a longer look at the top complementary options against the Lions.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nGiants 'Hard Knocks' takeaways: Did the team reveal too much?\n\nWide receiver\n\nThere’s a glass half full vs. half empty element to training camp practices. When wide receiver Malik Nabers torches Giants’ cornerbacks daily, there’s excitement about the rookie’s potential. But there’s also a level of concern about the Giants’ unproven corners being beaten so regularly.\n\nThe joint practices will provide insight into whether if Nabers’ dominance is due to his talent or the Giants’ corners’ deficiencies. For all of the Lions’ star power, cornerback is a bit of a question mark with veteran Carlton Davis and first-round pick Terrion Arnold outside. We’ll see how Nabers’ success translates during his first action against an opponent.\n\nSecond-year wide receiver Jalin Hyatt’s development should also be tested. Hyatt remains a deep threat, but he needs to continue to show he can be a more well-rounded receiver.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nGiants 'Hard Knocks' finale: Team rebuffs big trade offer before drafting Malik Nabers\n\nAn added benefit of joint practices is allowing each team’s personnel departments to get an up-close view of the opposing team’s 90-man roster for two days. That type of exposure could lead to a waiver claim after cut day. But it’s impossible to ignore the possible match for a trade with Giants wide receiver Darius Slayton.\n\nSlayton, who is entering the final year of his contract, wasn’t happy with his compensation and role earlier this offseason. The Lions’ thinnest offensive position is wide receiver. A trade for the consistent Slayton would make a ton of sense for the Lions, although the Giants don’t figure to make their lone proven receiver available before the season. But this week could lay the foundation for the sides to reconnect closer to the trade deadline.\n\nTight end\n\nWith Lawrence Cager (hamstring) and Jack Stoll (concussion) sidelined by injuries, there will be a lot of stress put on the four healthy tight ends. The frequent rotation figures to continue at tight end, but joint practices will provide a big opportunity for rookie fourth-round pick Theo Johnson to make a push to be the No. 1 option.\n\nOffensive line\n\nUnlike previous camps, the Giants’ tackles have been facing a top edge rusher daily in practice. That work against Brian Burns should have Andrew Thomas and Jermaine Eluemunor better prepared to face off against emerging Lions star Aidan Hutchinson.\n\nThe Giants struggled to block Hutchinson last summer before he broke out as one of the best edge rushers in the league. Hutchinson’s matchups will be particularly interesting against Eluemunor, who is being relied upon to be an upgrade at right tackle.\n\nLions defensive tackle Alim McNeill will be a load for the Giants’ interior offensive linemen to deal with, but nothing can be tougher than their daily tussles with Dexter Lawrence.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWhich player (or coach) from every NFL team will be next to make the Hall of Fame?\n\nDefensive line/outside linebacker\n\nThis should be strength against strength. The Lions arguably have the best offensive line in the NFL. The Giants hope their trio of Lawrence, Burns and outside linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux will give them one of the league’s best pass rushes.\n\nThomas poses a stiff challenge for Burns and Thibodeaux in camp. But Lions right tackle Penei Sewell is one of the few tackles in the league who can claim to be better than Thomas. And Taylor Decker is no slouch at left tackle.\n\nThe Lions are stocked with quality interior offensive linemen. Watching Lions right guard Kevin Zeitler still playing at a high level will be a reminder that cutting him three years ago for cap purposes was one of the worst moves of former general manager Dave Gettleman’s regrettable tenure. Three-time Pro Bowl center Frank Ragnow won’t be a pushover for Lawrence.\n\nThe one-on-one drills between these units will be a must-see.\n\nInside linebacker\n\nDavid Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs give the Lions one of the most dynamic running back duos in the league. Add in tight end Sam LaPorta, who delivered a monster 86-catch, 889-yard, 10-touchdown rookie season, and the Lions will be a major challenge for the Giants’ linebackers.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if presumptive starter Micah McFadden’s workload continues to be limited as he works back from a hamstring injury. The joint practices will give Dyontae Johnson a chance to solidify what he’s shown in first-team reps during camp.\n\nDetroit’s athleticism at running back and tight end should be a prime showcase for Isaiah Simmons, who has been working at linebacker in sub packages.\n\nCornerback\n\nLions All-Pro wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown feasted in joint practices last year in a sign of things to come before he exploded for 119 catches, 1,515 yards and 10 touchdowns. St. Brown will be a step up in competition for the Giants’ corners even after tangling with Nabers. St. Brown splits reps in the slot and outside, so all of New York’s corners will be put to the test.\n\nSome Giants position battles came into focus during joint practices last year, so it will be interesting to see if rookie Dru Phillips seizes the slot corner job this week. Matching up with St. Brown will help Phillips’ preparation for the season.\n\nCor’Dale Flott has been susceptible to deep balls during camp. Detroit’s Jameson Williams is a dangerous home-run threat who could exploit that weakness.\n\nSafety\n\nThe safeties will have their hands full trying to slow an explosive, efficient Lions passing attack. Covering LaPorta will be a step up from what the Giants’ tight ends present in practice. Dane Belton’s hold on the starting safety spot next to Jason Pinnock could get stronger with a quality showing in joint practice.\n\nSpecial teams\n\nThere will be extra attention on special teams because joint practices will be the first opportunity to see new coordinator Michael Ghobrial unveil his plans for the new kickoff rule in a game-like setting. Teams might hold wrinkles back in preseason games, so these practices might be the most revealing glimpse at the Giants’ plans.\n\nThe Lions’ heightened practice intensity may have been most evident last year in special teams drills. Punt coverage drills featured full-contact battles between gunners and jammers. Ghobrial has mostly run segmented drills during special teams periods. These practices figure to feature more 11-on-11 work to test the fundamentals the Giants have been building.\n\n(Photo of Daniel Jones: Lucas Boland / USA Today)"
