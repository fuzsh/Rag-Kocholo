        "text": "'Rick Moody is the worst writer of his generation.''\n\n''Birkerts trots out all his allusions and factlets and trivia, regardless of accuracy, relevance or extraneousness, with the tinkling insistence of a 5-year-old learning to play 'Chopsticks.'''\n\n''Terry McMillan's 'How Stella Got Her Groove Back' is the most lazily written book I've ever read. Some people -- namely, the book's publishers -- might be inclined to characterize its style as 'breathless,' but I think of it as a panting, gasping, protracted death rattle.''\n\nYou're curious, right? Aghast yet mesmerized. You want to read more. If so, Dale Peck has done his job. The three samples above have been culled -- not that it was very hard; every page is studded with observations like these -- from a collection of Peck's reviews, brazenly titled ''Hatchet Jobs,'' to be published by New Press in the spring. When the notorious article on Moody appeared in The New Republic last year and shattered the deep sleep of the literary world, it was as if a crime had been committed; to call it ''negative'' would be as inadequate as saying that the Boston strangler had a short fuse.\n\nAnd who is Dale Peck? the reader may legitimately ask. Peck is a 36-year-old novelist and critic who has created a furor in the literary world by lobbing grenades in the back pages of The New Republic intended not to disparage, not to bring down a peg, but to destroy his victims -- usually established writers whom Peck deems a threat to literature. To puncture the inflated reputations of these (mostly) Living White Males is a matter of the greatest urgency, Peck seems to believe, and he goes about the task with a crusader's obsessive zeal. At the end of a Peck essay, his subjects -- Philip Roth, Julian Barnes, Colson Whitehead -- are wounded, their books in ruins, massacred. Even if you're a fan of the work of these authors, you'll never be able to read their works again without hearing Peck's noisy voice shouting in the background: ''Forget it! You're wasting your time. The guy's no good.'' These bold assaults haven't gone unnoticed. Peck's review of Moody's memoir, ''The Black Veil,'' with its now canonical opening sentence ranking Moody at the bottom of his class, provoked articles in The New York Observer, Slate and Salon, among other venues. Steve Martin threatened to sic Peck on the audience at last year's National Book Awards ceremony: ''If anyone applauds before everyone has been announced, they will be reviewed by Dale Peck.''\n\nThe scope of Peck's contempt is wide. He has no more regard for his elders than for his contemporaries. The modernist tradition, he writes, ''began with the diarrheic flow of words that is 'Ulysses,' continued on through the incomprehensible ramblings of late Faulkner and the sterile inventions of Nabokov, and then burst into full, foul life in the ridiculous dithering of Barth and Hawkes and Gaddis, and the reductive cardboard constructions of Barthelme, and the word-by-word wasting of a talent as formidable as Pynchon's; and finally broke apart like a cracked sidewalk beneath the weight of the stupid -- just plain stupid -- tomes of DeLillo.'' Not even the masters of the 19th-century realist novel are spared; in a 1999 interview, Peck called Dickens ''the worst writer to plague the English language.''\n\nThe question arises: Why should we care what Dale Peck thinks? The short answer is, He's interesting. Not only has he managed to get himself talked about (''Dale Peck is the Michael Ovitz of the literary world,'' says the literary agent Bonnie Nadell); he has managed to stir up a debate over the practice of book reviewing -- its status, its value, its effect on our literary culture. ''Peck may not be right about his scorched-earth policy,'' the novelist Jeffrey Eugenides has said. ''But his essay moves the discussion from the small idea (is this a good book or not?) to the large one (where should literature be headed?). That's what makes it criticism.'' Heidi Julavits, a 30-something New York novelist, disagrees. Writing in The Believer, a hip, new literary journal she founded with Vendela Vida and Ed Park, Julavits produced a pleading essay, ''The Snarky, Dumbed-Down World of Book Reviewing,'' that was essentially a critique of Peck's approach. Reviews, she wrote primly, should be ''civil,'' ''an occasion, not for tears or vendettas or shoe licking, but for dialogues.'' ''Snark'' she defined as ''this hostile, knowing, bitter tone of contempt'' adopted by reviewers on the prowl for vulnerable books. ''Snark'' is not good for literature.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
