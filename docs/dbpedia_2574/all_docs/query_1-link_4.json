        "text": "Dale Brown Absolutely. Back in the 1980s everyone knew and understood who the bad guys were: the Soviet Union and Communist China. I didn't need to go into the history or politics of why we were going to war. The fall of the USSR and the end of the Cold War complicated things because a war in the Middle East, Asia, or Eastern Europe meant that I had to explain the geopolitics of the conflict I was going to write about.\n\nBut the Cold War seems to have returned, and both Russia and China are powerful rivals flexing their military muscles and challenging the United States all over the world. But it's not just ideological: it's economic, societal, and cultural as well as political. All that needs to be explained to properly set up the story.\n\nRapid changes in technology makes the stories more complex as well. Writing about bomber technology is straighforward and simple to describe for me. But changes in computers, electronics, space, cyber, and the Internet, and how all these shape the battlefield, takes time to research and describe in a novel. I like the tech stuff, but I have to remember that folks read novels for entertainment, not necessarily for information.\n\nIt's more complex, but I like the challenge. I love doing research into new technology and then thinking about how that new stuff might affect a future conflict--and make the result entertaining and thought-provoking at the same time. That challenge is why I became an author!"
