        "text": "After recent speculation about takeover interest in listed Lloyd’s carrier Hiscox, The Insurer examines the mostly overseas (re)insurers most likely to enter Lloyd’s either through acquisition or a start-up...\n\nLloyd’s has enjoyed a successful H1 2024 when it comes to its strategy of attracting tier-one market entrants, with the Fidelis Partnership launching Syndicate 3123, an unconfirmed major global client launching the first Lloyd’s captive syndicate of the 21st century (widely known to be Google, as first predicted by this publication) and Aviva returning to the market with the acquisition of Probitas.\n\nBut with early 2025 pre-emptions typically standing at around 5-10 percent (albeit with outliers including Fidelis, Blenheim and Hampden Risk Partners), the Corporation is understood to be continuing its strategy of engaging with “alphabet” (re)insurers considering a Lime Street platform as part of Lloyd’s CEO John Neal’s $100bn strategy.\n\nSurprisingly, Generali and Sompo were the subjects of recent speculation around a possible takeover of Hiscox despite neither being the most obvious candidates (Generali has not traditionally shown an enthusiasm for Lloyd’s while Sompo has exited the market twice in the space of seven years). Nonetheless, the speculation has certainly put Hiscox in the frame as a potential M&A target – a deal, were it to happen, that would be the largest ever acquisition of a Lloyd’s (re)insurance company.\n\nThe lack of disclosure despite Hiscox’s share price spike perhaps perhaps suggested the speculation lacked accuracy, but bankers and analysts specialising in the Lloyd’s market all agree that they expect more M&A and strategic moves because of current low valuations, the strong dollar and growth plans.\n\nThere are certainly long-standing reasons to establish a presence at Lloyd’s: access to business in the Lloyd’s market, international licences and some advantages in capital requirements over other jurisdictions. Distribution in particular was a driving factor for Aviva, with CEO Amanda Blanc saying the company has “strong growth ambitions” for Probitas.\n\nThere are two ways to enter the Lloyd’s market: start a new syndicate (like Fidelis has done) or acquire an existing insurer (as Aviva did with Probitas). While a new start with no legacy business is appealing to some, making an acquisition means inheriting existing revenue and a team with market experience while bypassing the complex and time-intensive syndicate application process (albeit Lloyd’s is showing – as per Fidelis – a willingness to accelerate preferred entrants).\n\nAt the moment, the relatively modest valuations in the London market make Lloyd’s insurers prime acquisition targets. In 2019, price-to-tangible-book valuations for London-listed insurers were above peer groups in the US and Bermuda at well over 2x. Now they are below both after a significant drop in 2020 and a further slide in 2023, at just over 1.5x as of Q2 2024 (see graphic).\n\nIn Q2 2024, Hiscox had the highest price-to-tangible-book valuation at 1.73x, with Beazley at 1.52x and Lancashire at 1.39x. Conduit Re, based in Bermuda but listed on the London Stock Exchange, had a valuation of 1.04x.\n\nIndeed, analysts at Berenberg described London-listed carriers as “sitting ducks” for acquisitions in April. As well as publicly listed Hiscox, Beazley and Lancashire, some of the privately owned businesses at Lloyd’s are also potential targets (demonstrated by CVC’s 2023 majority acquisition of Dale Underwriting Partners from its previous third-party capital backers).\n\nBelow, The Insurer examines a non-comprehensive selection of firms not currently operating in the Lloyd’s market that we anticipate are the most likely of the industry’s “big game” carriers to acquire or establish a Lloyd’s platform in 2024-2025.\n\nPossible acquirers\n\nOne category of companies that could choose to follow in the footsteps of Aviva and acquire a Lloyd’s managing agent is global multiline (re)insurers, including those based in Europe.\n\nAllianz is the industry’s largest global insurer without a presence at Lloyd’s despite a strong appetite for London market and specialty business.\n\nAllianz has already struck two notable M&A transactions this year. In March, it completed the acquisition of Tua, an Italian P&C insurer owned by Generali, for €280mn. In July it announced plans to buy a majority stake in Singapore’s Income Insurance for $1.64bn.\n\nThe insurance heavyweight has repeatedly been linked with mulling a major Lloyd’s M&A deal and appears increasingly keen on London market business, as demonstrated by its growing support for MGAs.\n\nGenerali was one of the two insurers rumoured to be considering a takeover of Hiscox in July. Like Allianz, it is openly pursuing an M&A growth strategy.\n\nIn February, Generali completed the acquisition of Liberty Seguros from Liberty Mutual for €2.3bn, strengthening its operations in Spain and Portugal and entering Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nIt also recently expanded its asset management arm by buying US investment group Conning. These acquisitions came after Generali indicated in 2021 that it planned to spend up to €3bn on M&A in insurance and asset management.\n\nEarlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Generali was considering M&A opportunities involving larger insurers. However, CEO Philippe Donnet quickly played down this speculation, saying the company’s immediate focus was on integrating Liberty Seguros and Conning.\n\n“Generali has frequently ruled out the UK and US as regions for expansion,” KBW analyst William Hawkins commented recently, describing the speculation around it acquiring Hiscox as “odd”.\n\nMapfre, itself rumoured to be an acquisition target for Generali, could be another candidate to enter Lloyd’s. Mapfre has been growing its reinsurance business in recent years and in July secured regulatory approval to open a branch in Beijing.\n\nBut the London market was not a priority in its three-year strategic plan to grow premiums by 6 percent from 2024 to 2026. Mapfre chairman and CEO Antonio Huertas said the company was actively seeking new distribution channels in Spain, Brazil, the US, Mexico and Germany, alongside looking to grow its life business and increase the proportion of bancassurance within its business mix.\n\nWhile Sompo’s premium income is comparable to Mapfre, its enterprise value is more than double that of the Spanish insurance group. Like Generali, Sompo was connected to the Hiscox takeover rumours, but seemed an unusual candidate given it has exited Lloyd’s twice in under 10 years.\n\nSompo entered Lloyd’s with the acquisition of Canopius in 2014. It then acquired Endurance in 2017, which also had a Lloyd’s presence, and soon pushed to offload Canopius. Canopius’ private equity-backed management buyout completed in 2018. Endurance ceased underwriting at Lloyd’s at the end of 2020 and the run-off business was sold to RiverStone in 2022.\n\nExplaining the 2020 decision to end underwriting at Lloyd’s, Sompo’s then CEO of international insurance Julian James told The Insurer at the time that the growth it wanted “ simply wasn’t possible on the Lloyd’s platform”.\n\n“If I look at the licences, for us we have our own global licences as Sompo,” James said. “We also have a similar financial security rating as Lloyd’s does and we want to develop and build our own brand. So we really felt it was in our best interests with our ambitions as a company to utilise one single platform in London and we felt the company market was best for that.”\n\nBut more recently Sompo, alongside other Japanese insurers, has been gearing up for M&A following regulatory pressure to diversify its portfolio, according to analysts from investment bank Berenberg. Lloyd’s insurers could in theory be back in its sights but it is rare for Japanese businesses to undertake strategic U-turns.\n\nConvex is another insurer that previously declared its focus was outside Lloyd’s, despite having a leadership team with a long history in the market (Catlin Underwriting was once the largest syndicate at Lloyd’s). Convex mulled formally applying to establish a Lloyd’s syndicate in 2019, the year it launched its business, but decided against it.\n\nFounder Stephen Catlin told The Insurer TV in 2021 that Convex could not have expanded “at the pace we’ve done it” if its main operating platform had been a Lloyd’s syndicate. He added: “Does that mean that we will never, ever have a Lloyd’s syndicate? Absolutely not.”\n\nCertainly, Lloyd’s is much more receptive to a Convex entry than five years ago. After all, the business is headquartered less than 50 yards from the Lloyd’s building and will likely record more than $5bn in London market gross written premiums in 2024. Does Convex need Lloyd’s? Clearly not, as demonstrated by%20its remarkable growth, but there are still reasons why it would consider it, not least the efficiency of Lloyd’s global licences.\n\nIf it were to enter in 2025, then it would likely do so organically like Fidelis rather than Aviva’s buy-in approach.\n\nZurich could also be a candidate to enter Lloyd’s by acquisition. Berenberg analysts estimated last June that the group had around $6bn in excess capital it could use for deals, and it has made several acquisitions since.\n\nIn November 2023, Zurich spent $760mn acquiring three brokerages and the flood program servicing arm of the Farmers Exchange, to support the growth of its US subsidiary Farmers Group. In June 2024, it acquired a majority stake in India’s Kotak for $670mn, then announced a $600mn deal to acquire AIG’s global personal travel business.\n\nEven after these deals, it may have enough excess capital to pursue a strategic acquisition at Lloyd’s but the company has never shown an enthusiasm for Lloyd’s despite a strong pedigree in writing London market business.\n\nKorean (re)insurers could also be candidates to enter Lloyd’s by acquisition. The country’s largest non-life insurer Samsung Fire & Marine acquired a stake in Canopius for $150mn in 2019. Acquiring the majority of Canopius could be a next step if Samsung sees Lloyd’s as a strategic focus. Korean Re has also been connected with establishing a Lloyd’s syndicate in the past.\n\nBermuda-based IGI could be another candidate, having acquired a box at Lloyd’s earlier this year. IGI previously considered establishing a syndicate in 2017 and 2018.\n\nCEO Waleed Jabsheh told The Insurer that the recent move to acquire a box was not a precursor to forming a syndicate (“There are no plans of taking any action in that direction at the moment”) but added that the company could consider such a move in the future.\n\nAnother category of insurers that could look to acquire a Lloyd’s managing agent is those that primarily operate in the North American specialty market.\n\nIntact entered the UK market by acquiring RSA’s UK, Canadian and international entities in 2021 for £3bn. Renewing its focus on commercial and specialty lines in 2023, it acquired Direct Line’s brokered commercial lines business and sold RSA’s direct personal lines operations. Could a presence at Lloyd’s be the next step? It could make sense. After all, RSA has long had an established presence in certain specialty lines, especially in marine (where global licences are especially valuable).\n\nUS insurer Old Republic formed a new subsidiary for excess and surplus lines business in 2022, which has ramped up more quickly than some of its other platforms. CEO Craig Smiddy said on its Q1 earnings call that the firm’s push into the E&S market would “continue to accelerate”, since “there’s a very decent E&S market out there”.\n\nA Lloyd’s syndicate is a potentially attractive platform for companies like Old Republic that want to lean into E&S, with Lloyd’s market participants expected to benefit from continued growth in the segment. The strong dollar would also be helpful.\n\nRLI and Skyward Specialty are also bullish on the E&S market, though they are smaller than Old Republic and Intact. RLI is particularly leaning into property business, while Skyward raised around $65mn in capital last November to target further growth opportunities.\n\nMore than the other North American specialty insurers listed here, Core Specialty has proved its acquisitive nature. In the last 12 months, it has acquired Conifer’s security and alarm business, American National’s MGU/stop-loss business and renewal rights to its specialty markets group, along with insurer American Surety.\n\nApart from (re)insurers, large MGAs might also look to set up a platform at Lloyd’s. K2, HW Kaufman, Brown & Brown’s Kentro, Aventum’s Rokstone and Ryan Specialty could be candidates.\n\nK2 is actively exploring the launch of a syndicate after its recent hiring coup in luring former AIG executive Paul Greensmith to head its international operations. Rokstone acquired a box at Lloyd’s earlier this year to increase its access to the market.\n\nRyan Specialty has a brief history owning a Lloyd’s managing agent, acquiring Jubilee Group in 2011 but selling 80 percent of its managing agent to ANV Holdings just two years later.\n\nCompared to larger reinsurers, MGAs might be more likely to set up a new syndicate – following in the footsteps of CFC – rather than acquire an existing business.\n\nUsing a syndicate to provide a small portion of capacity across an MGA’s business can show its capacity partners it has ‘skin in the game’ when it comes to profitable underwriting, whilst owning a syndicate that already underwrites various lines of business unrelated to the MGA could risk capacity partners starting to see it as a direct competitor."
