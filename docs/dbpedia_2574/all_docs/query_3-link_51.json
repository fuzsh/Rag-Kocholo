        "text": "Here is just a sample of his \"collections\" --\n\nIt's not your IQ that counts, it's your FQ -- it's your Failure Quotient. How much can you take? Now, historically, success often follows a series of failure. Successs is actually built on multiple failures. Until we learn to derive lessons from our failures, we'll keep on repeating these failures, and keep digging ourselves into a deeper hole. You've got to rise up every time you fall, and you can never give up.\n\nHistory provides us with numerous examples of highly successful people who were confronted with many and major failures. But they still made their dreams come true. Failure's only a detour, and an opportunity to begin again. The most successful people, in almost every profession, have not been afraid to fail. And then when they have fallen down, they got back up. Let me give you just a few.\n\nA woman in England was struggling to write a book. She took it to five publishers, five different times they rejected her book. She was a single, unemployed mother on welfare. She was about ready to trash the book, and decided to take it to one more publisher. She took it to that publisher, he gamble on it. Well, did she have any success? Her name is J. K. Rowling. She wrote Harry Potter. By the way, it's now the best-selling children's book in history. Plus, she become the first author every to make a billion dollars."
