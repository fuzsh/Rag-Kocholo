        "text": "Dale Peck, the author of three previous novels Now It’s Time to Say Goodbye, The Law of Enclosures, and Martin and John, and the self-described ‘most hated man in literature,’ has just published his new novel What We Lost. As it states on the cover, the book is ‘based on a true story,’ his father’s. Peck was born on Long Island, grew up in Kansas, teaches at the New School, and has lived in Manhattan for the past eight years. The New Press will be publishing a collection of his book critiques, Hatchet Jobs, in the Spring of 2004\n\nPeck’s infamy stems in large part from his hypercritical reviews of his contemporaries, the most quoted of which concerns Rick Moody and begins with echoes of Allan Ginsberg’s Howl, ‘Rick Moody is the worst writer of his generation.’ Peck acknowledges what he terms the ‘indecent amount of ink devoted to his book reviews,’ including the recent James Atlas profile in the New York Times magazine.\n\nIn our talk below Peck dismisses the profile as ‘not about anything’ and ‘a ridiculous piece of literary gossip.’ True to the form of Peck’s bad boy persona, the ubiquitous Steve Almond didn’t see it that way, ‘Profile may be the wrong word, though. Hagiography is probably closer to the mark. The piece manages to be both woefully naive and deeply cynical at the same time.’ And then there is the Peck spoof and of course the Brits have their own take on Peck: ‘There is a new verb in the U.S.: to Peck. Or an old verb with a new meaning. Dale Peck is a literary one man bandit—he trashes everything he reads.’\n\n* * *\n\nRobert Birnbaum: Are you Dale Peck III?\n\nDale Peck: My grandfather’s name is Lloyd. My father [Dale Peck] has the older half-brother, Dale Peck.\n\nRB: Does that make you Dale Peck 2.5?\n\nDP: It just says ‘junior’ on my—actually, it doesn’t say ‘junior.’ It just says ‘Dale Peck.’\n\nRB: Why does ‘based on a true story’ appear on the cover of What We Lost? What does it mean to say a novel is based on a true story?\n\nDP: I think it means that genre tags are really inadequate.\n\nRB: You could have put ‘genre tags are really inadequate’ on the cover instead.\n\nDP: Yes, yes. The original subtitle—I never had a subtitle—the original subtitle that they came up with was ‘a story from my father’s childhood.’ Which sounded rather fey. The basic reason is that part of it’s real and part is made up. The basic backbone of the entire first part of the book is all real but obviously little things like dialogue and internal thoughts are recreated. Occasionally chronology is squashed a little bit just so it can fit in the space. And then a couple of incidents are out and out made up for the sake of illustrating certain points that I wanted to make about my father’s story. And the second part of the book is—to the best of my ability to do so—entirely true. I am a stickler when it comes to calling something nonfiction. I would never shelve this book under nonfiction—even though I might publish it as some kind of creative memoir. Also, it seemed equally untrue to call it a novel, when every time I wanted to swerve away I couldn’t. I would always make myself come back to the facts such as I knew them or the story as my father had presented it to me. Houghton [Mifflin] had originally planned upon publishing it as a novel and—\n\nRB: You had originally planned to write a novel?\n\nDP: Well, I originally planned to write a book and I told them when I sold it to them I didn’t care if they published it as a novel or as a memoir. It’s the kind of question that’s been settled, among writers at any rate, for a very long time. Sometimes you make it up and sometimes you draw from life. Very often you mix the two, and I don’t think we really care anymore.\n\nRB: May I surmise that the tag line, ‘based on a true story,’ is the publisher’s decision? To help the reader?\n\nDP: Yes. As tag lines go it’s about accurate as they come. It’s based on a true story, which implies, obviously, that it’s not all true but that some part of it is.\n\nRB: The broader implication is that since such a clarification doesn’t appear on other book jackets, that they are not based on true stories?\n\nDP: I never understood that. I always got confused in English classes and such where you would be reading Colette and then they would tell you it was based on such-and-such love affair and they would tell you the name of the real person and all this kind of thing. And I’d think, ‘Why did she write the novel and all that?’ And at the end of the day I would think that it was not terrifically important to me when you choose not to indulge in or claim that particular weightiness that attaches to the claim of truth. Which is part of the reason I considered publishing this book as a novel. I didn’t want to make too great a claim to the truth here. These are things that actually happened to my father. His reaction to them is something I can only base on my own observations of what he said. And to some degree, as in any act of writing like this, part of what I am trying to do is give voice to feelings that I feel like he has never been able to fully express. Or else the story would not be as resonant as it is in our family history.\n\nRB: How reliable a narrator is he?\n\nDP: When he tells the story? Terrifically unreliable. Or maybe I am an unreliable listener, I don’t know. My understanding of the story has changed constantly as I have grown up. For years and years I thought that my father actually went to live on the farm because his father had died. His father actually died when he was 17—two years or so after this story ends. They were very poor, and I thought that he had been parceled off to save money. And then I discovered much later that it was his father that had taken him up there. How long he was up there was always very vague to me. The conditions under which he went back were always vague. When my father originally told the story it tended to be the kind of story that came out when he was drunk. So it was whatever he chose to remember at that particular moment. And he was very selective. I had a really, really shocking moment—because I wanted this story to reflect my father’s experience and because my father has an impossibly large and complicated family, I elected not to go for everybody’s versions of things. And I elected not to make this a big sprawling multigenerational family saga because, quite frankly, I think all of my father’s brothers and sisters probably have stories that deserve to be told and I wasn’t going to tell them all. I was doing my father’s. One of my aunts came to the reading that I gave in New York City and afterwards she came up to me and told me two or three really amazing stories right off the bat. The first was that my grandfather used to bring home mental patients from the hospital [he worked at] and he would sell them open food out of the fridge to get a little bit of money. And the second was an amazing story in which he was so drunk that he tried to make her hang up the laundry on the clothesline but that the laundry was a bag of garbage, which he seemed not to realize. And she was hanging up cereal boxes and fruit peelings on the laundry line.\n\nRB: What was the cough medicine he was addicted to?\n\nDP: It was Robitussin, terpin hydrate. I think it’s still available but I am not sure if still has codeine in it. [Actually, one brand of Robitussin does include codeine. Terpin hydrate is a generic drug often prescribed in tandem with codeine.—ed.] There are very interesting websites devoted to it.\n\nRB: [laughs]\n\nDP: Apparently, if you can get it, it produces the closest thing to a Quaalude high that’s still available. But then the last story she told me was something that was one of those things that reminds me why I am so nervous about writing about my family. She claims that my grandfather had tuberculosis and that’s how he became addicted to this cough syrup, a fact that my father has never mentioned. Ever. Just completely passed by. And not the kind of thing that you would think to ask.\n\nRB: Did your father know? Tuberculosis is an odd disease in that it wasn’t always clearly diagnosed.\n\nDP: Right, and it was curable at that point. He worked in a hospital. I don’t know.\n\nRB: Would there have been stigma attached?\n\nDP: It’s just one of those things, one of those omissions that pop up in my family life. Like finding out my father had an older half-brother with the same name as him. That is something I learned in my 20s. It just never came up, though my father had known for years and years.\n\nRB: I am fond of and favor David Shields’s view of writing that essentially autobiography streams into all that we write. One can disclaim that is what is happening but really somehow our choices are there and any number of things have our autobiographical fingerprints on them. Why is it important to create these boundaries or categories? Is there a difference between fiction truth and nonfiction truth?\n\nDP: I think there is a difference to the moral weight that attaches to it. It’s one of the reasons I have problems with Tim O’Brien’s writing. Because he lies and he tells you that he lies. And then he tells you that it doesn’t make a difference.\n\nWith this particular book when somebody gets something wrong, I find myself getting, ‘Goddamn, that’s my father! You are not talking about some character that I made up!\n\nRB: Many writers would gleefully tell you that they are professional liars.\n\nDP: Yeah, you said that in your interview with Vendela Vida, and it’s true we do. It’s one of my stock lines. I say it all the time. It’s true we lie. For me the categories are sometimes very important and sometimes not all. In this particular instance, it was really important for me to insist upon that the basis in my family situations [was true] whereas when I wrote my first novel, Martin and John, it was really important for me to insist upon on the utter fictionality of all these things, despite the fact that there were these clear surface similarities between the family that I was writing about and my own family. The alcoholic father, the abused mother or absent mother, the gay son. Long Island and Kansas as two locales. Despite all of that I felt like I was arriving at very abstracted, very arbitrary personal renderings of narratives that I had made up and all that. I was not rendering the truth of my own experience at all. These were stories for a theme, to illustrate a particular idea. Whereas in What We Lost, it seemed very important to arrive at something, it’s hard to say what kind of truth to call it. It’s not historical truth. There are all kinds of gaps in the records but it reflects a family experience which is filled with all kinds of inconsistencies of fact and differences of opinion as to what actually happened and as to what things mean. But just the emotional core of the experience is something—when I talk about this experience with family members, it’s privileged conversation and there isn’t that same kind of conversation for anything else that I have written and I know that it’s distinct. And even if it’s only in those particular moments, I know that it’s distinct. Or when I read somebody writing about this particular book and they get something wrong, I get mad in a way that I never get. Book reviewers make so many mistakes; it’s just unbelievable. I say that as someone who has written a lot of book reviews and caught my own little mistakes. ‘He wasn’t 13, he was 16.’ ‘The house wasn’t blue, it was brown.’ The little things that you remember so clearly from the text that weren’t in the text. With this particular book when somebody gets something wrong, I find myself getting, ‘Goddamn, that’s my father! You are not talking about some character that I made up!’ And those little reactions remind me that I am thinking of this differently. I don’t know if other people do or not.\n\nRB: You are reminding me of two things. On a number of occasions I have asked Alan Furst about this obligation to the historical facts and truth. His answer is that he is absolutely committed to the historical record because so much blood has been shed around these details. And when I was talking to Edward Jones recently, whose novel The Known World is about black slave owners in Virginia in the 1850s, I asked him about his research and how much he tries to get it right. Jones says that all he is concerned with is that he doesn’t say anything that makes the reader think any different than what he has presented. He wouldn’t present a dialogue with two slaves and have one of them saying, ‘Yo, dawg, it’s cool.’\n\nDP: I have great sympathy toward both views. It depends on what your goal is in the text. One of things I always insist upon in my own writing and whenever I am speaking to students is that you do not pretend that things are real which are not real. Novelists in particular have no particular duty to get anything right whatsoever. But you do have a duty not to pretend that you are getting it right if you are [not] and not to pass things off as the gospel truth if that’s not what they are.\n\nI have this sense that human beings spend most of their lives with more or less of a layer of culture between them and the life they are actually living. That there is always something getting in the way. And that a good story points that out.\n\nRB: To what or whom do they have a duty?\n\nDP: It depends. To the reader, to one’s self, to—if there is indeed some kind of abstract or Platonic idea of truth one wants to pay homage to. That sort of thing…\n\nRB: If you have rules or principles as you have expressed here, it suggests there is some end in mind, that literature is for something. What’s it for?\n\nDP: Gosh, so many people will quibble about that. I have spent my whole life wondering exactly what the answer to that question is. The first thing I have to say is that it is an unanswerable question. One of the fascinating things about literature is that it’s an absolutely unnecessary product that people for whatever reasons seem to think is vital. And that in and of itself makes it incredibly precious to me.\n\nRB: Is storytelling co-equivalent with literature?\n\nDP: Sure, sure.\n\nRB: And your view is that it is not essential?\n\nDP: It’s essential only in the sense that people want it. Obviously we don’t need it to live. Joan Didion’s famous line, ‘We tell stories in order to live,’ is a metaphor. We need food, clothing, water.\n\nRB: We have never tried living without stories. Has any civilization lived without stories?\n\nDP: It depends how deep you want to go.\n\nRB: I would argue that storytelling is an essential human activity. I am not clear that there is something that is essentially human, but I do think that this sharing of legend and myth is central to what we are as humans.\n\nDP: I wonder if it is a natural byproduct of language? If it’s escapable? For me, storytelling—and it doesn’t matter whether it’s fiction or something that calls itself memoir or criticism—storytelling is about bringing the context into focus and bringing the thing that context usually brings into focus. I have this sense that human beings spend most of their lives with more or less of a layer of culture between them and the life they are actually living. That there is always something getting in the way. And that a good story points that out. It doesn’t shatter that. It doesn’t strive toward some ridiculous idea that you experience life exactly as it is. You can’t. I just don’t think it’s possible. But it reminds you that you are in essence following some script. Sometimes a very small one, sometimes an overarching predetermining one. And maybe that script is taking you places you don’t particularly want to be going. And you want to tweak that. For me, that’s the moral heart at the center of storytelling—is to step back a little and point out the ways in which so many assumptions, learned patterns and behaviors just dictate to us and guide us in ways that we don’t think about.\n\nDale Peck, photograph by Robert Birnbaum\n\nRB: As you are starting to write this story, which is deeply personal, are you thinking about whom you would want to read it?\n\nDP: In this case—always the answer to that is yes. I had a very strong desire to make the book readable to my father. In this particular case because the story belonged, not to me but to my father. My earlier novels are very literary; complex in their structure and occasionally in their language, sometimes in the sorts of character situations they depict as well. One of the other ways in which I distinguished this book from my earlier fiction is that those books are definitely about me, about things that I think. And this book, as much as I could make it not about that—of course that’s never going to be entirely escapable—I’m writing it. But this book was about discovering something that somebody else thought, in this case, my father, and making that fully present to me and thus fully present to the reader as well. He was always the weirdly ideal reader for this particular text. At the same time I really believe that literature is never, ever, ever a private act. If it is in fact literature, then it has to be available to other people. That’s one of the reasons, again, why this is based on a true story and not a true story. Because when I sat down to write it, I realized I had enough material for maybe 40 pages of straight biography. And 40 pages in this day and age are not anything. It’s too long for a short story. It’s too short to be published independently. Inside a book of stories, it will disappear. It will not have any kind of singular life. Which I really wanted this particular story to have. And so, hence, the need to invent things, primarily dialogue. And thought can turn something very small into something much bigger.\n\nRB: In the story there are two parts. The first part takes up two years in real time—\n\nDP: Eighteen months. Sixteen months, something like that.\n\nRB: And then the second part, much more compact, covers a little over a day? It ends with the brothers embracing. The second part is more like a coda—\n\nDP: The second part is so many different things. Among other things, it is in lieu of a moral. In lieu of the rest of the story.\n\nRB: Is that where the title plays out?\n\nDP: The title was solicited from me. The original title was Greenfield, the name of the town, and my editor solicited another title from me and What We Lost has been a title that has been kicking around in my files since I started writing—it’s one of my favorite titles ever and it really belongs to a short story that I will probably never ever, ever finish. I have two different approaches. Which is either I get a title and the story is there immediately, present to me and I follow from it. Or else I write a book and write a book and write a book and can never title it. And as it’s leaving the door it has a title put on it, at the very end. The Law of Enclosures did not want a title. It didn’t want a title at all.\n\nRB: I wonder if anyone has seriously published a book entitled, Untitled?\n\nDP: I don’t know. On the train up here I was listening to that Sigur Ros album which is Untitled. And all the tracks are untitled. They just have two parentheses. I have a story that was originally published as ‘Untitled’ that later on got a title.\n\nRB: Visual artists freely do that. Isn’t there a book called Winner of the National Book Award?\n\nDP: Yes, and Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius is a similar kind of thing, a meta-thing going on. I have thought about doing untitled books at certain points but then almost always a title suggests itself.\n\nTo me the novel is nothing more than a strongly expressed opinion and so it seems like the only thing you can respond to it with that is even remotely worthwhile is an equally strongly expressed opinion. Whether it’s for or against…Sometimes I feel when the two ideas butt up against each other you actually get the sense of a visible outline.\n\nRB: Ever thought about publishing something without your name on it? [laughs]\n\nDP: I have thought of publishing lots of things pseudonymonously—as the most-hated man in publishing. I have thought all the time of publishing things under different names. I don’t because for me the association of a text with a consciousness that created it is probably paramount in my understanding of literature. I absolutely refuse to accept any notion of universal truth, of things delivered from on high, for which a writer is merely a channel. I find that sort of thing to be complete and utter bullshit.\n\nRB: Do you note the extremity of literary personalities becoming adjuncts to the greater celebrity culture? And if you do, isn’t that distracting?\n\nDP: Oh sure. Literature went rock star about the time I started publishing. Before that there were famous writers and there were cults of celebrity or legend that surrounded writers. But the whole packaging of it from the agent to the advance to the cult of fandom and that sort of thing has gone so completely rock star in the last 10 years.\n\nRB: That would be one argument for anonymizing, though it seems too Soviet or totalitarian a gesture…\n\nDP: I think a lot of times now when I am dealing with the indecent amount of ink that is being spilled over my book reviews that, would it have been better if I had published them anonymously? You go back and pick through the reviews that the modernists were writing about each other and they were all nasty, nasty, but they were all unsigned. Of course, what that led to was everyone trying to figure out who wrote what, and it’s not like Virginia Woolf and E.M. Forster and T.S. Eliot did not have very particular writing styles and very particular sensibilities that I am sure one could spot 60 miles away. Especially if you were reading and writing them in their day.\n\nRB: You don’t subscribe to the notion offered by Gertrude Stein that artists should never be criticized?\n\nDP: No, I think artists should be criticized all the time. Constantly, constantly, constantly. I don’t think I could say it any other way. If I just said that the novel has no essential role to play in life despite the fact that it’s one of the most precious products of our culture, then the role of the critic must be even that much more ephemeral. To me the novel is nothing more than a strongly expressed opinion and so it seems like the only thing you can respond to it with that is even remotely worthwhile is an equally strongly expressed opinion. Whether it’s for or against…Sometimes I feel when the two ideas butt up against each other you actually get the sense of a visible outline…\n\nRB: I do have this image of an obese guy surrounded by his trough of carbs and brewskis, watching a sporting event, yelling at the TV that various athletes are bums. The absurdity of some couch slug insulting gifted and skilled professional athletes is the image I carry about much criticism. People who can’t or haven’t done the thing that they are critiquing. So much of contemporary cultural commentary shows no sign of respect for the efforts or sensitivity to ambitious experiment.\n\nDale Peck, photograph by Robert Birnbaum"
