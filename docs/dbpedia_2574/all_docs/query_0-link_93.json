        "text": "Tom Hollander was born the second child of educated parents, both teachers. He grew up in Oxford, (UK).\n\nHollander credits the happy atmosphere of the Dragon School with his childhood introduction to acting. There, encouraged by an influential teacher named Andrew Roberts, he won the title role in \"Oliver\". His studies continued at Abingdon, as did his pursuit of acting. At about this point, he won a place in the National Youth Theatre, a UK organization for young people in the field of musical theatre, based in London, and later at the Children's Music Theatre. It was during CMT's \"The Leaving of Liverpool\" (1981) that he came to the attention of BBC television, and subsequently found himself front and center as the young protagonist in a well-regarded John Diamond (1981), based on the popular Leon Garfield adventure novel. He was just fourteen years old.\n\nOther early projects included two roles in Bertholt Brecht's \"The Caucasian Chalk Circle\" (1985) for the National Youth Theatre, and \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" for Oxford University Dramatic Society.\n\nHollander attended Cambridge University at about the same time as his childhood friend Sam Mendes in a visually bold (and well-remembered) staging of \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" (1988). Other collaborations with Mendes have followed, including work at the West End production of \"The Cherry Orchard\" (1989, with Judi Dench), and the Chichester Festival Theatre (1989) as well as a Toronto staging of \"Kean\" (1991) with Derek Jacobi. He also appeared in the Cambridge Footlights Revue (1988).\n\nUpon graduation, Hollander hoped to gain entry to drama school, but found himself disappointed. The oversight did nothing to discourage a successful career already well under way: he garnered an Ian Charleson Award for his turn as Witwould in \"The Way of the World\" (1992), was nominated again for a \"splendidly sinister, manic\" performance as \"Tartuffe\" (1996), and yet again as a finalist for his Khlestakov (\"a performance of ideal vigour and impudence\"), in Gogol's \"The Government Inspector\" (1997). Inevitably, Hollander was urged to try films, and appeared in two films as early as 1996. True Blue (1996) (aka \"Miracle at Oxford\") found him in a small but memorable role as the cox for Oxford's noted 1987 \"mutiny crew\" that went on to win the that year's boat race against Cambridge, and in a thankless role in Mütter & Söhne (1996), a sober drama about an IRA gunman, playing a Thatcher representative.\n\nHollander's career has featured a number of memorable gay roles. His fans are especially fond of the larger-than-life Darren from Kreuz und queer (1998), a romantic comedy with what one reviewer called the \"funniest bedroom scene of the year\" involving Hollander's character and Hugo Weaving. The over-the-top Darren was so convincing that some viewers assumed Hollander was gay. \"Sometimes I call myself a professional homosexual impersonator,\" he told an interviewer at the time, quickly adding, \"you could say that ...Sir Ian McKellen and Rock Hudson do straight actors.\" The following year, he would take on a very different kind of \"gay\" role, playing the notorious \"Bosie\" (Lord Alfred Douglas) against Liam Neeson's Oscar Wilde in \"The Judas Kiss\" (1998).\n\n\"Martha -- Meet Frank Daniel and Laurence\" (aka Martha trifft Frank, Daniel & Laurence (1998), with Joseph Fiennes and Rufus Sewell, brought accolades for his standout role as Daniel, a difficult music executive. Variety, impressed, noted him for \"U.K. legit work\" and called him the \"undisputed hit of the pic\".\n\n2001 brought Gosford Park (2001), Robert Altman's masterfully stylized murder mystery, in which he played the quietly desperate Anthony Meredith against Michael Gambon's callously indifferent paterfamilias. Hollander's name figures in a half dozen or more \"Best Ensemble\" awards for this complex, multi-storied film.\n\nConsidered the character-actor-of-choice for roles with comedic qualities, Hollander has challenged assumptions about his capacity by taking on difficult, troubled characters such as the tightly-wound King George V in Stephen Poliakoff's The Lost Prince (2003) for BBC and the demented fascist dictator Maximillian II in Land of the Blind (2006). Hollander himself is particularly proud of the film Das Herz kennt kein Gesetz (2001), a slyly humorous, cleverly constructed comedy-drama told from three viewpoints. Hollander's character, the heart of the film, is a decent man, devastated by the death of his partner, and grieving privately as the stories of friends and family unfold around him. A study of desire, loyalty and courage, the film was very well reviewed and much respected.\n\nMore recent film work has brought him to the attention of mainstream movie audiences, who now know him as the magnificently petty tyrant Lord Cutler Beckett in the second and third installments of Disney's \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movies, Pirates of the Caribbean - Fluch der Karibik 2 (2006) and Pirates of the Caribbean - Am Ende der Welt (2007). This role brought another kind of achievement: Hollander could now say that he'd been commemorated in collectible action-figure form.\n\nHe's worked three times with director Joe Wright, beginning with the prissy, yet strangely likeable Mr. Collins in Stolz & Vorurteil (2005), as a clueless classical cellist in an unfortunately truncated role in Der Solist (2009), and as Issacs, the German henchman in Wer ist Hanna? (2011).\n\nWith Kabinett außer Kontrolle (2009), Hollander brought a perfectly unbearable, delicate tension to the role of Simon Foster, the earnestly clueless \"British Secretary of State for International Development\" who says the wrong thing at exactly the wrong moment. The film acted as a kind of companion piece to the critically-acclaimed The Thick of It: Der Intrigantenstadl (2005) on BBC2, Armando Iannucci's furious political satire on the machinations of war and media. Hollander's contribution to the expanded story was apparently so well-received he was \"brought back\" (but in a different role, entirely) from film to television for a series-ending surprise-appearance in series 3, delighting fans of the show.\n\nRecent work in television has brought him the opportunity to expand on his special capacity for conveying nuanced and contradictory characters. He earned an award for Best Actor at the FIPA International Television Festival for his portrayal of Guy Burgess in Cambridge Spies (2003), and earned praise for the monstrously rude yet oddly endearing Leon in the satire Freezing (2008), with Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern) for BBC. He was unforgettable in an elegantly brief but very moving portrayal of King George III for HBO's John Adams - Freiheit für Amerika (2008).\n\n2010 brought Hollander to widespread attention with Rev. (2010), which he co-created with James Wood. The show, initially described in what was assumed to be familiar terms (\"vicar\", \"comedy\") became something entirely new: \"...an exploration of British hypocrisy and a warmly played character piece\", wrote Giles Fraser, Canon Chancellor at St Paul's Cathedral in a piece for The Sunday Telegraph. Rev. was much more than it appeared: reviews called it intelligent, realistic and very funny, with a stellar cast headed by Hollander as the sympathetic and very human vicar, Adam Smallbone. The show would garner a BAFTA in 2011 for Best Situation Comedy, among other awards and recognition.\n\nHollander supports a variety of charitable causes in innovative ways. In 2006 he ran his first race for the Childline Crisis hotline, and in 2007 ran for the Teenage Cancer Trust. He is a long-time supporter of the Helen and Douglas House in Oxford, which provides Hospice care for children, and continues to support charitable organizations by contributing readings and other appearances throughout the year. Hollander is a patron of BIFA, the British Independent Film Awards, and has supported the efforts of the Old Vic's \"24 Hour Plays New Voices\" Gala, which forwards the cause of young writers for the British stage.\n\nHollander continues to diversify with voicework roles in radio, reading audiobooks, doing voiceover work and onstage. He appeared in the Old Vic's production of Georges Feydeau's \"A Flea in Her Ear\" (2010), playing a demanding dual role: the upstanding Victor Emmanuel Chandebise and the lame-brained Poche. Reviews called it \"insanity\", and his performance \"a breathtaking combination of lightning physical precision and shockingly true confusion\".\n\nHollander is in production for series 2 of the winning comedy Rev. (2010).\n\nOne of England's most versatile character actors, Jim Broadbent was born on May 24, 1949, in Lincolnshire, the youngest son of furniture maker Roy Laverick Broadbent and sculptress Doreen \"Dee\" (Findlay) Broadbent. Jim attended a Quaker boarding school in Reading before successfully applying for a place at an art school. His heart was in acting, though, and he would later transfer to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). Following his 1972 graduation, he began his professional career on the stage, performing with the Royal National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, and as part of the National Theatre of Brent, a two-man troupe which he co-founded. In addition to his theatrical work, Broadbent did steady work on television, working for such directors as Mike Newell and Stephen Frears. Broadbent made his film debut in 1978 with a small part in Jerzy Skolimowski's Der Todesschrei (1978). He went on to work with Frears again in The Hit - Die Profi-Killer (1984) and with Terry Gilliam in Time Bandits (1981) and Brazil (1985), but it was through his collaboration with Mike Leigh that Broadbent first became known to an international film audience. In 1990 he starred in Leigh's Das Leben ist süß (1990), a domestic comedy that cast him as a good-natured cook who dreams of running his own business. Broadbent gained further visibility the following year with substantial roles in Neil Jordan's The Crying Game (1992) and Mike Newell's Verzauberter April (1991), and he could subsequently be seen in such diverse fare as Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway (1994), Die Witwen von Widows Peak (1994), Richard Loncraine's highly acclaimed adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III (1995) and Little Voice (1998), the last of which cast him as a seedy nightclub owner. Appearing primarily as a character actor in these films, Broadbent took center stage for Leigh's Topsy-Turvy - Auf den Kopf gestellt (1999), imbuing the mercurial W.S. Gilbert with emotional complexity and comic poignancy. Jim's breakthrough year was 2001, as he starred in three critically and commercially successful films. Many would consider him the definitive supporting actor of that year. First he starred as Bridget's dad (Colin Jones) in Bridget Jones - Schokolade zum Frühstück (2001), which propelled Renée Zellweger to an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Next came the multiple Oscar-nominated film (including Best Picture) Moulin Rouge! (2001), for which he won a Best Supporting Actor BAFTA award for his scene-stealing performance as Harold Zidler. Lastly, came the small biopic Iris (2001), for which he won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor as devoted husband John Bayley to Judi Dench's Iris Murdoch, the British novelist who suffered from Alzheimer's disease. The film hit home with Jim, since his own mother had passed away from Alzheimer's in 1995.\n\nJerome Patrick Flynn (born 16 March 1963) is an English actor and singer. He is best known for his roles as Paddy Garvey of the King's Fusiliers in the ITV series Soldier Soldier, Fireman Kenny 'Rambo' Baines in the pilot of London's Burning, Bronn in the hit HBO series Game of Thrones, and Bennet Drake in Ripper Street.\n\nHe and his Soldier Soldier co-star Robson Green also performed as Robson & Jerome in the later half of the 1990s. They released a version of \"Unchained Melody\", which stayed at number 1 for 7 weeks on the UK Chart, selling more than a million copies and becoming the best-selling single of 1995. The duo had two further number 1 singles: \"I Believe\" and \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\". Their eponymous debut album and the follow-up Take Two both reached number 1 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nFlynn was born in Bromley, Greater London, the son of actor and singer Eric Flynn and drama teacher Fern Flynn. He has a brother and sister, and a half-brother and sister from his father's second marriage. His brother Daniel Flynn is also an actor, and his half-brother Johnny Flynn is a musician and actor. Jerome attended Wilderness school in Sevenoaks and was an excellent rugby player at school.\n\nIn 1986 Flynn appeared in the LWT television film London's Burning as firefighter Kenny \"Rambo\" Baines. When the film spawned a series of the same name in 1988, he was the only member of the main cast who was unable to reprise his role (aside from Gary McDonald, whose own character, Andreas \"Ethnic\" Lewis, was killed off in the film) due to previous commitments. Also in 1986 he played a minor role as the soldier \"Franny\" in \"The Monocled Mutineer\".In 1988 he played the character Freddie in the ITV drama; The Fear which was about the London underworld. He appeared as D.S Eddie Hargreaves for six episodes of the British Academy Television Award (BAFTA) winning police drama, Between The Lines between 1992 and 1994.\n\nFlynn portrayed Corporal Paddy Garvey of the King's Fusiliers in the ITV series Soldier Soldier. The series began in 1990. He acted alongside Robson Green in the series. After Flynn and Green performed Unchained Melody on the program-me, ITV was inundated by people looking to buy the song, and the pair were persuaded by record producer Simon Cowell to record it and release it as a single, a double A-side with White Cliffs of Dover. The single was released under the name Robson & Jerome and reached number one in the UK chart in 1995. It stayed at No.1 for 7 weeks in the UK Singles Chart, selling more than 1.9 million copies and making it the best-selling single of the year, and winning the duo the Music Week Awards in 1996 for best single and best album. The duo had two more number one hits in 1995 and 1996 with \"I Believe\" and \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" both re-makes of standards, they also produced two number one albums.\n\nSoldier Soldier ended in 1997. Flynn went on to star as Eddie Wallis (alongside singing partner Robson Green) in the comedy-drama Ain't Misbehavin' (1997), and was the star of the short-lived police show Badger in 1999. He played Bobby Charlton in the 1999 film Best. On stage, he played Tommy Cooper in Jus' Like That, a tribute to the comic magician written by John Fisher and directed by Simon Callow.\n\nHaving semi-retired from acting and moved to Pembrokeshire, in 2007 Flynn directed and starred in the low budget film Rude Tales. The film was split into a series of short stories centered in the lead character, Jerome Rude, played by Flynn. The film was screened at a small number of independent cinemas in the Pembrokeshire area.\n\nAfter almost 10 years away from acting, in July 2010 it was confirmed that Flynn would be playing the role of Bronn in the HBO television series Game of Thrones, based on the A Song of Ice and Fire novels of George R. R. Martin.\n\nFlynn provides the voice of Daniel (the hound) in the children's television show Tommy Zoom. He also appeared on the television program-me So You Think You're Royal?, where it was established that through his mother he is a direct descendant of Oliver Cromwell, through his son Henry Cromwell, and also a descendant of Edward I, Edward II, and Edward III of England.\n\nFlynn stars alongside Matthew Macfadyen in four series of Ripper Street for the BBC.\n\nIn 2016, he appeared in \"Shut Up and Dance\", an episode of the anthology series Black Mirror.\n\nIn a 2019 interview, Flynn revealed that he'd been cast in Amazon Prime Video's upcoming series adaptation of Stephen King's The Dark Tower series in an unannounced role.\n\nDamien Molony is an actor of stage, TV and film, best known for his television roles as Hal in BBC 'Being Human', DC Albert Flight in BBC 'Ripper Street', DS Jack Weston in 'Suspects' and Jon in 'GameFace'. He grew up in Johnstown Bridge in Kildare, Ireland, where he was born on February 21 1984 but now lives in London, UK. From 2003 to 2007 he attended Trinity College, Dublin, where he obtained a degree in Business and Political Science and began his acting career in 2007 touring Ireland with the Balally Players in 'Riders to the Sea', for which he was nominated as best actor in the One Act Drama Festival. In 2008 he also appeared with the Kildare Youth Theatre in their production 'A Vampire Story.'\n\nDamien attended Drama Centre London 2008-2011, graduating with a BA in acting. While at drama school he performed in several theatre productions and played the male lead in award winning film short 'When The Hurlburly's Done'.\n\nAfter being spotted in his drama showcase, he was offered the part of Giovanni in John Ford play ''Tis Pity She's a Whore', which ran 7 - 28 May 2011 at the Yorkshire Playhouse. While appearing in the play, he auditioned for and landed his first leading television role in BBC supernatural drama 'Being Human'. Molony appeared in every episode of series 4 in 2012 and series 5 in 2013 as Hal Yorke, an over 500 year old vampire.\n\nIn 2012, Damien played the lead in National Theatre production 'Travelling Light', performing as two characters, Motl Mendl and Nate, in a 5 month tour across the UK and a worldwide cinema broadcast with National Theatre Live.\n\nHis stage career has gone from strength to strength ever since, appearing in one high profile theatre production after another, including Jason/Workman/Ray in Ander's Lustgarten's politically charged 'If You Don't Let Us Dream We, Won't Let You Sleep' at The Royal Court Theatre, London, 15 February - 9 March 2013 and as Dan O'Brien and multiple roles alongside William Gaminara in 'The Body Of An American' at the Gate Theatre, London 6 January - 8 February and the Royal & Derngate 27 February - 8 March 2014.\n\nDamien returned to the National Theatre in 2015 when he played Spike in Tom Stoppard play 'The Hard Problem' from 28 January - 17 May 2015.
