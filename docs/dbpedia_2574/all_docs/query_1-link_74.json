        "text": "I joined St. Martin’s Press in 2021 after earning my master’s degree in history at Yale University. My passion for storytelling inspired my transition from academia to publishing. A graduate of Brown University and the Columbia Publishing Course, I currently reside in coastal Connecticut. I read widely across genres and am actively building my list with an eye towards fiction and nonfiction with a feminist focus.\n\nFiction:\n\nI seek upmarket fiction that is smart, sharp, and well-written, with characters whose voices I can hear in my head. Some examples include GHOSTS by Dolly Alderton, SUCH A FUN AGE by Kiley Reid, and anything by Taylor Jenkins Reid.\n\nI love historical fiction, especially if it sheds light on previously untold women’s stories. Historical fiction should draw me in and make the unfamiliar feel relevant and accessible. My favorites include GREAT CIRCLE by Maggie Shipstead, HAMNET by Maggie O’Farrell, THE GREAT BELIEVERS by Rebecca Makkai, and THE ALICE NETWORK by Kate Quinn. Many of these feature multiple timelines, which I love when well-executed.\n\nNonfiction:\n\nI have a master’s degree in history and I always love compelling narrative nonfiction that ties contemporary social and political issues to their historical roots. I’m open to any narrative nonfiction with a confident voice that feels relevant and accessible, especially if it features an underrepresented perspective. Examples include GOOD AND MAD by Rebecca Traister, TRICK MIRROR by Jia Tolentino, THE SECRET HISTORY OF WONDER WOMAN by Jill Lepore, and CULTISH by Amanda Montell.\n\nI am also delighted by memoirs in which the writing shines as much as the story itself, like KNOW MY NAME by Chanel Miller and MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO SOMEONE by Lori Gottlieb.\n\nFinally, I love nonfiction that combines fun and function. FINANCIAL FEMINIST by Tori Dunlap is a great example of accessible nonfiction that empowers readers.\n\nMy overarching desire is to tell stories that leave you thinking long after the book has ended. I seek clever voices, strong writing, and stories that center diverse women’s experiences.\n\nI am NOT the right fit for graphic descriptions of violence, self-harm, or psychiatric institutions.\n\nFun facts about me:\n\nBeyond the world of books, I love musicals, dance, and travel. My favorite city is London and my dog is named Darcy (inspired, of course, by Jane Austen). You can find me on Bookstagram @BrigittesBookshelf.\n\nSubmission Guidelines\n\nPlease send submissions to brigitte.dale@stmartins.com\n\nI only accept agented submissions."
