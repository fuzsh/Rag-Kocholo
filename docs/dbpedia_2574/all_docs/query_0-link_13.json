        "text": "It arrived at the height of the pandemic, in a brown envelope with no return address and too many stamps, none of which had been marked by the post office. It was addressed to me at my parents’ New York City apartment, where I haven’t lived in more than a decade. My mother used the envelope as a notepad for a few weeks, then handed it off to me in July; it was the first time I’d seen her after months of quarantine. Inside the envelope was a small, stapled book—a pamphlet, really—titled “Foodie or The Capitalist Monsoon that is Mississippi,” by a writer named Stokes Prickett. On the cover, there was a photograph of a burrito truck and a notice that read “Advance Promotional Copy: Do Not Read.” The book began with a Cide Hamete Benengeli-style introduction attributed to a Professor Sherbert Taylor. Then a fifty-five-page bildungsroman written in short sections with boldface titles. The prose reminded me a bit of Richard Brautigan.\n\nBecause I write book reviews, dozens of unsolicited books are sent to my house every month. Many of them, I confess, barely catch my attention before they’re added to a stack on the floor. But I sat down and read this one all the way through. The narrator of “Foodie” is Rusty, who thinks back on his days in high school, when he worked as a thumbtack-maker’s apprentice, then in a floor-mat factory. Rusty meets another kid from school, an idealist called Foodie whose real name is Gourmand, and whom Rusty describes as “a tetherball champ, a king of the taco stands,” in a town “at the edge of the 8-track suburbs.” Foodie, Rusty says, “was the kindest werewolf on the warfront, and I was his hairdresser.” They start spending time with a hulking, ruthless classmate named Dale, who is “right-handed and immoral as parchment,” and fated to die young because he has a white-collar job that causes him to move through time more quickly than his friends do. After Dale’s death, Foodie and Rusty part ways.\n\nThe book was good. But who was Stokes Prickett, and how did this person get my parents’ address? Initially, I suspected a friend who was fond of pranks or an enemy who knew that I was prone to go down rabbit holes. I posted details about “Foodie” on Twitter, hoping to drum up some information. A few people told me that they had also received it—they were mostly writers, editors, and critics—but no one had a clue about what was going on. The writer Ryan Ridge pointed out that Prickett seemed to be a fan of the magazine that he edits, Juked. Several Juked contributors had received the book. I e-mailed the person who took the picture of the burrito truck, which is in the public domain. “I’d love to tell you about it,” the photographer replied, “but I have no idea what you’re talking about :).” In the introduction to “Foodie,” Sherbert Taylor writes, “I prefer to dissuade his obsessive biographers and accept that his identity is best unsought.” Perhaps the professor was right.\n\nA couple weeks later, “Foodie, Part Two” arrived, again at my parents’ apartment, with even more stamps, none marked by the post office. It was longer than Part 1, and featured a Canadian break-dancing competition. Dale returned as a ghost; Rusty had a love interest named Fontanelle. (“She smoldered like art on fire,” Rusty says, “but her boyfriend had the charisma of a wharf.”) I also found a Sherbert Taylor Twitter account, which had posted links to a SoundCloud account with recordings of someone reading snippets of “Foodie.” I followed everyone who followed that Twitter account and everyone who had reported receiving “Foodie.” When someone sent me a lead, I followed everyone that person followed. I looked for mutual contacts, and drew up a list of suspects. It was quite long. I sent my list to all the interested parties. A number of them were disturbed by Prickett’s use of mailing addresses that weren’t readily available. I figured that Prickett was using an online database; for a few dollars, you can find out a shocking amount of private information. I’d filed taxes from my parents’ address for years.\n\nIn August, I relocated there to help my parents during the pandemic. My life during this period was recursive: the same faces on Zoom, the same masked walk each day, the same sirens rushing by. I found reading hard and writing impossible. “Foodie” provided the perfect quest for a life being led online. Every time I considered quitting, a new hint would arrive, a new writer I admired would ping my in-box. Prickett helped get me through.\n\nBut what was Prickett after, exactly? Were the anonymous mailings a ploy to go viral? Was I helping? Sometimes, when someone praised a passage from the book that I’d shared on Twitter, that person would subsequently receive a copy in the mail. I learned that a handful of fairly obscure Philadelphia musicians had also received “Foodie,” and decided to give my investigation a regional focus. One of these musicians, Ricky Lorenzo, formerly a singer and guitarist for a band called YJY, now defunct, described himself as a “ghost,” and sent me a cannibal-comedy movie that he’d made. I watched it carefully, suspecting that he was Prickett, but I ultimately concluded that he had simply spotted an opportunity to promote his cannibal comedy.\n\nThe writer Joe Samuel Starnes e-mailed me a hypothesis that Prickett was someone named “Walter T. Hazelgood,” who had audited a class of his years ago but had walked out, crumpling a handout on Freytag’s Pyramid—a dusty bit of structural analysis formulated by a German playwright in the nineteenth century and occasionally taught in introductory creative-writing classes—never to return. I could find no living writer named Walter T. Hazelgood, and noted that this supposed author shared his initials with the phrase “what the hell.” I suspected for a long time that Starnes was Prickett. (I was wrong.)\n\nAn interview of Prickett, conducted by Sherbert Taylor and printed on several loose sheets of paper, arrived at my parents’ apartment. Taylor described himself as a “lonely literary scholar, aging and losing his handsomeness,” who had landed “this Matterhorn of an interview six months ago while sandblasting my patio.” I seem to be the only person who received this document; reading it felt a bit like being taunted. In the fall, some people received “Foodie, Part 3” and “Foodie, Part 4,” in which Foodie founds a restaurant called Responsible Tony’s and Rusty continues to pursue Fontanelle. I did not receive either installment. Had I done something wrong?\n\nUsing photos of these recipients’ envelopes, I was finally able to trace the mailings through stamp cancellation. Earlier in the pandemic, perhaps because of budget cuts, the Postal Service hadn’t marked any of the “Foodie” mailings. Now the packages were stamped with a numeric code that linked to a post office in New Jersey. One of my initial suspects was a writer named Erik Bader, who, prior to the “Foodie” saga, had sent me a book of his attached to an e-mail that began “I’ll make this short so you feel like I’ve wasted your time.” He tweeted me a photo of a plaque on a bridge in New Jersey that he said he crosses several times a week. The plaque lists the bridge committee, and the second name on it is Stokes Prickett. (Bader told me that he has since received a copy of “Foodie” in the mail.) I was getting closer.\n\n“Foodie 5” was mailed to my parents’ apartment in January. Dale is abducted by ghosts, and Responsible Tony’s burns down. I sent my list of suspects to dozens of new recipients. The writer Rion Amilcar Scott, who had received the first “Foodie” a year ago but had not opened it until recently, messaged me on Twitter to say that he had spoken with one of my suspects about the Philadelphia music scene. The suspect lived in the same region as the post office in question, and had previously been named as a possible Prickett by a mysterious Twitter account that didn’t respond to my subsequent questions. I had e-mailed the suspect at the time, and he had denied knowledge of the whole thing, but this seemed like a breakthrough. I wrote to him again, suggesting that I knew he was Prickett. Hours later, he agreed to talk. He asked that I not publish his real name, but said that I could describe his career in general terms, and that he would confirm all the details with a fact-checker.\n\nThe author with the pseudonym Stokes Prickett has published several books with several publishers. (“I’m not great at working with people,” he told me.) Those publishers include tiny independent presses and one Big Five imprint; the books include both fiction and nonfiction. “Out of all the different kinds of publishing I’ve done,” Prickett wrote, in an e-mail, “I’ve most appreciated and enjoyed academic journals with their double-blind peer-review process, which comes closest in the world of publishing to sending your shit out to strangers in the mail.”\n\nPrickett told me, “I wrote the first and last paragraphs of Part One a few years ago but I hadn’t gone back to do anything more with them.” Then, after finishing another book, Prickett, for the first time, took a “long break from writing. I didn’t write a single word for a year,” he told me. “I wasn’t sure if I wanted to write any more. But those two paragraphs won me over. I would dream about them. Now I wake up excited to work on Foodie.”\n\nWhy not get it published? Why send it to a seemingly random and relatively small group of recipients? (Prickett has sent copies to five or six hundred people.) “The worst thing about writing,” he told me, “is how long you spend working on something before you get to show it to people. It’s a very lonely way to work. You spend three or four years on a book and then it takes months to find an agent, months for the agent to find a publisher, and then it’s another year or more before the book comes out . . . The literary industry is just not much fun.”"
