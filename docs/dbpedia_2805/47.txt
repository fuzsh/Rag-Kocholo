Asked by Mr.Cheng(Malaysia )

I am visiting a place in Sanya which is called “110” Agricultural Technical Services of Hainan Province” where visitors are introduced to the herbs/medicinal plants growing in their compound. Is there an entrance fee to this place, and how much would be cost per person. Thanks.

Answered by Mr.Shan

I know a popular traveling place called Binlang Village has 110 Agricultural Technical Services, located in Fenghuang Town, just about 10 minutes away from downtown Sanya by bus. It is free for travellers to visit.
