        "text": "Williams is located about 30 miles west of Flagstaff along Interstate 40. If you’re coming from Phoenix, take I-17 north to Flagstaff. As you get close to the city you can take I-40 west to Williams. Look for Exit 163, exit and go south on Grand Canyon Blvd about a 1/2 mile. The property will be on the west side of the street. From Phoenix, the trip is about 2 and a half hours, but could take a little longer depending on weather conditions.To learn about current driving conditions, visit ADOT’s website with up-to-date conditions. If the roads are closed near Flagstaff, consider taking I-17 north and exit at Cherry Road on Highway 169 toward Prescott, which will eventually merge with Highway 69. Drive through Prescott and look for Highway 89 going north through Chino Valley. You’ll end up on I-40, just west of Williams. Simply make a right on I-40 and travel about 19 miles until you see Exit 163.\n\nTrain Only Guests\n\nWe recommend arriving at least one hour before departure. This should provide enough time to pick up tickets at will-call and be ready to board The Polar Express. The train will begin boarding 15 minutes before departure. You can certainly pick up your tickets earlier. Tickets will be available at noon (12:00 PM) on the day of your departure.\n\nPolar Family Package Guests\n\nThe Grand Canyon Railway Hotel is conveniently located adjacent to the Williams Depot. You can begin checking in at the hotel at 3:00 p.m. Upon check in you will be issued both your train and meal tickets. Dinner and breakfast at the Fred Harvey Restaurant, also located next to the hotel, is included in your package. If you’re on the 5:30 p.m. departure, we recommend arriving to Williams around 4:00 so you can check-in, pick up your train tickets and have plenty of time for dinner.\n\nThe passenger cars have luggage racks near the ceiling so feel free to bring coats, diaper bags, camera bags, backpacks and anything else you need. Even though the cars have luggage racks, we recommend only bringing what you really need on the train. Strollers can be parked outside the depot. There is a limited amount of space in the vestibules (between the cars) on the train, but we recommend parking strollers by the depot as there are plenty of covered areas. Also, all families are encouraged to bring their own copy of The Polar Express by Chris Van Allsburg to read along to the story during the journey. Brand new copies are available for purchase at the Depot and Fred Harvey Restaurant Gift Shops.\n\nSeats on board The Polar Express are bench-style, with two passengers per bench. Booking seats in even numbers is strongly recommended. If your family is traveling with another family on a separate reservation and would like to be seated together, please contact Central Reservations at 1-888-848-3511. While we do our very best to honor all seating requests on board The Polar Express, we cannot always guarantee them.\n\nOther activities at Grand Canyon Railway include story time with Mrs. Claus and pictures with Mr. C in the Polar Room. Also, have your kids stand on the patented Naughty or Nice Meter™ to see if they might be expecting a lump of coal in their stockings! Be sure to visit with our staff Elves and Hobo, who will be wandering around the Platform throughout the evening. In fact, if you’re around the Hobo’s campsite 45min prior to departure you might see him sharing some hobo wisdom with Polar Express passengers.\n\nDuring Polar Express, the restaurant will be open for dinner from 3:30 p.m to 9:30 p.m. Breakfast will be open at 6:30 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. The full buffet is available during Polar Express nights, as well as special desserts made just for the holidays! No alcoholic beverages are permitted aboard The Polar Express. Adult beverages are available at The Fred Harvey Restaurant and inside the hotel at Spenser’s Pub.\n\nParking is free and is available around the hotel and depot complex. There is a parking lot east of Grand Canyon Blvd. as you enter the Railway’s complex as well as parking west of the hotel. You may want to budget a few minutes extra to find parking as there will be as many 3,000 people on property."
