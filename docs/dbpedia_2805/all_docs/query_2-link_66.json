        "text": "Hey there beach lover! Make sure you’ll get plenty of sand between your toes by following Hainan’s guides for inbound travelers.\n\nThe short answer is no. You don’t need a test or vaccine if you’re coming from a low-risk area, according to Tenecent Health mini-program. Read on for more details.\n\nAt this moment the Sanya CDC is requiring those coming from low-risk areas in China to sign a letter of commitment that they have no symptoms of fever, cough or sneeze and that they haven’t recently been to medium or high risk areas. Along with signing this commitment, tourists will need to show their green codes and have their temperature taken.\n\nIf you’re coming from an epidemic area but not a designated medium or high risk area (for example someplace near Fujian’s medium and high risk areas), you’ll need to provide a negative nucleic test twice within 48 hours, 24 hours apart. These should be acquired before boarding the train or plane to arrive in Hainan.\n\nIf you’ve simply passed through the area due to a train stop or flight delay, causing you to stay in a medium or high risk area for under 24 hours, you simply need to sign the letter of commitment and confirm that you didn’t stay overnight in that area.\n\nThose who are currently living in medium and high risk areas would have to undergo 14 days of isolation quarantine and then 7 days of home observation with multiple tests throughout the whole experience. This is of course if for some reason the resident is even able to leave the risk areas, which is highly unlikely considering the current control measures in place.\n\nIf you’re coming from Harbin, you need to inform Sanya airport about which Harbin area you’ve come from.\n\nDo note that your province or city might have their own protocols to leave or return. It’s important to find that out.\n\nTenecent Health notes that epidemic controls are constantly changing, and the best way to find out the latest news is to call a city’s mayor or Epidemic Prevention Command Center’s hotline for the most recent information. You can do that by typing in the city area code and 12345 for the mayor or area code and 12320 for the center.\n\nSome have reported experiencing airlines giving extra requirements to foreign-passport-holding passengers, such as seeing the entry stamp date. It is a best case scenario to have a friend call ahead to your airline to double check any requirements or contact the airline’s customer service via WeChat subscription accounts to confirm if there are any extra requirements for foreign nationals.\n\nWhere To Go, What To Do\n\nIf you’re looking for recommendations about where to go and what to do, subscribe to That’s Sanya or join one of our groups.\n\nREAD MORE: 25 Awesome Sanya Events: Pool Parties, Music Festivals & More\n\nWe highly suggest the Solciety Pool Party being put on by the crew of Solar, and you can go for free with friends through an easy giveaway.\n\nThis massive pool party at MGM Grand’s luxury outdoor pool will be unforgettable like Solar’s other popular events.
