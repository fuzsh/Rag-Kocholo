        "text": "We want to encourage community members to watch professional fireworks displays if they choose. Santa Barbara County is in drought conditions, and the use of unauthorized fireworks can easily create a brush fire. The Santa Barbara Police Department and the Santa Barbara Fire Department will have multiple joint firework patrols to address illegal fireworks within the City. Misdemeanor citations could be issued to those possessing or using personal fireworks.\n\nIf you know a specific location where illegal fireworks are being set off, please contact SBPD’s Dispatch Center’s non-emergency line at 805-882-8900 and provide as much information as possible about the location of the fireworks to our dispatchers. For emergencies, dial 9-1-1.\n\nThe loud sounds of fireworks are often very scary for dogs and other pets. Every year, pets run away and get lost because they’re spooked by the loud fireworks. Here are some tips from the American Kennel Club to help keep your pets safe this July 4th:\n\nKeep Your Dog Away From Fireworks\n\nKeeping your dog inside in the evening on the Fourth of July is the best idea, especially if you fear they might not react well.\n\nMake Sure Your Pet Has Proper ID\n\nMore dogs run away on July 4th than any other day of the year. Ensure that the information on your pet’s collar is current and make sure your dog is microchipped and has a GPS device.\n\nCreate a Safe Haven For Your Dog\n\nTry setting up an area in a quiet space away from windows — such as a basement or a larger closet — so that they can’t hear or see fireworks. Use a crate if that’s where your dog feels safe, and make sure to provide your pup with familiar toys and treats.\n\nPlay White Noise\n\nYou can try leaving a fan, TV, or radio on to help mask the sounds of the fireworks.\n\nComfort Your Dog\n\nIf you can, try staying home with your dog or leaving them in the hands of a trusted person.\n\nPetting them can be comforting. Try your best to remain calm and reassuring to help your canine companion.\n\nWalk Them Before the Fireworks Start\n\nHead out for your long walk before the sun sets to increase the chances that you’ll avoid the sounds. When you do go out, you’ll want to ensure your dog is secure on a leash before your walk.\n\nTalk to Your Vet\n\nIf your pet’s anxiety is severe, consider booking an appointment with your vet so you can discuss a medication that could help soothe your dog’s anxiety."
