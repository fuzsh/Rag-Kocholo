        "text": "What parking options are available?\n\nUCLA Health offers several parking options at all of our locations. Many of these options require a fee and are found near the draw station you will be visiting for that day.\n\nDo I need an appointment to come get my blood drawn?\n\nWith the exception of UCLA Health Westlake Village Laboratory, all other Clinical Laboratory locations do not currently accept appointments. For UCLA Health Westlake Village Laboratory, patients are able to make an appointment via MyChart.\n\nI would like to see if my lab orders are available in CareConnect. Could the laboratory assist me with that?\n\nLab orders are generally placed and released by your ordering provider. Your doctor or treatment team is the best resource for order status confirmation. The Clinical Lab recommends utilizing resources such as myUCLAhealth to reach out to your treatment team for assistance and order confirmation. Other options to communicate with your provider are available on the UCLA Health appointments page.\n\nI need to drop something off at the lab. What should I do?\n\nWith the exception of 100 UCLA Medical Plaza, Suite 245, all other draw stations will accept specimens that are being dropped off for processing and testing. Please note there is not an expedited process for specimen drop offs and patients will still need to wait in the queue to deliver specimens to the laboratory.\n\nIs there anything special I need to do prior to having my labs drawn?\n\nPatient preparation instructions are typically outlined in the After Visit Summary (AVS) information sheet that is provided to patients by their clinician. The Clinical Lab encourages all patients to review this sheet for additional guidance prior to your lab visit.\n\nI was recently drawn at your location. How do I know when my test result is available?\n\nWhile every test has a specific turnaround time, the lab releases results to CareConnect as soon as they become available. If you have questions about a specific result, the Clinical Lab encourages you to reach out to the ordering physician to determine the latest status of that order. We also encourage our patients to check their myUCLAhealth app to review any results that may already be available to them.\n\nI would like to request a copy of my test results or medical record. Who can I reach out to?\n\nFor hard copy requests, please reach out to the UCLA Health - Health Information Management Release of Information Office at 310-825-6021.\n\nMy provider is unable to view one of my lab results. What should I do?\n\nIf a provider cannot see a result but you feel it should already be available, please have the provider call the lab directly for further assistance."
