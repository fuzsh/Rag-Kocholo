        "text": "Since 1901, the Grand Canyon Railway and Hotel has been taking passengers on a fabled journey to the heart of one of the seven wonders of the world. Grand Canyon Railway is more than just a mode of transportation: it’s a trip back in time on lovingly restored rail cars with entertaining musicians and the antics of cowboy characters. Out your window, the terrain changes from high desert to prairie, prairie to pine. It’s a view that’s ever-changing until you come across a view so brilliant, it could very well change you.\n\nDeparting Daily from Williams, AZ\n\nThe train departs daily at 9:30 a.m. Mountain Time (except during November/December when it leaves at 8:30 a.m.) and returns to Williams at 5:45 p.m. (except during November/December when it returns at 4:45 p.m.). Enjoy more than 3 hours at the canyon as the train drops you right in the Historic Village at the South Rim.\n\nSchedule\n\nRiding the rails to the canyon is just one part of an unforgettable Grand Canyon experience. Whether you need lodging at both ends of our line or you’re driving an RV, Grand Canyon Railway & Hotel will take great care of you and even your pets! Our hotel and RV park are located adjacent to the historic Williams Depot and a couple blocks from downtown Williams and “The Mother Road” – Route 66. Plus, with a variety of Grand Canyon vacation deals to choose from, we’ll also save you money in the process."
