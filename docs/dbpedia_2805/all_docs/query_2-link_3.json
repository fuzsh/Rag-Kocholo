        "text": "Telephone numbers in People's Republic of ChinaLocationCountryPeople's Republic of ChinaContinentAsiaRegulatorMinistry of Industry and Information TechnologyTypeOpenAccess codesCountry code+86International access00Long-distance0\n\nTelephone numbers in the People's Republic of China are administered according to the Telecommunications Network Numbering Plan of China. The structure of telephone numbers for landlines and mobile service is different. Landline telephone numbers have area codes, whereas mobile numbers do not. In major cities, landline numbers consist of a two-digit area code followed by an eight-digit local number. In other places, landline numbers consist of a three-digit area code followed by a seven- or eight-digit local number. Mobile phone numbers consist of eleven digits.\n\nLandline calls within the same area do not require the area code. Calls to other areas require dialing the trunk prefix 0 and the area code.\n\nCalling a mobile phone from a landline requires the addition of the \"0\" in front of the mobile phone number if they are not in the same area. Mobile to landline calls requires the \"0\" and the area code if the landline is not within the same place. Mobile to mobile calls does not require the \"0\" outside mainland China.\n\nThe special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau are not part of this numbering plan, and use the calling codes 852 and 853 respectively.\n\nIn mainland China, mobile phone numbers have eleven digits in the format 1xx-XXXX-XXXX (except for 140–144, which are 13-digit IoT numbers), in which the first three digits (13x to 19x) designate the mobile phone service provider.\n\nBefore GSM, mobile phones had 6-digit (later upgraded to 7-digit) numbers starting with nine. They had the same numbering format as fixed-line telephones. Those numbers were eventually translated into 1390xx9xxx, where xx were local identifiers.\n\nThe oldest China Mobile GSM numbers were ten digits long and started with 139 in 1994, the second oldest 138 in 1997, and 137, 136, 135 in 1999. The oldest China Unicom numbers started with 130 in 1995, the second oldest at 131 in 1998. Keeping the same number over time is somewhat associated with the stability and reliability of the owner. The 5th to the seventh digit sometimes relates to age and location.\n\nChina's mobile telephone numbers were changed from ten digits to eleven digits, with 0 added after 13x, and thus the HLR code became four-digit long to expand the capacity of the seriously fully crowded numbering plan.\n\nIn 2006, 15x numbers were introduced. In late 2008, 18x and 14x (for data plans or IoT) were introduced. In late 2013, 17x were introduced. In 2017, 16x and 19x were introduced.\n\nIn December 2016, each cell phone number was required to be consigned to a real name in mainland China. [1]\n\nIn November 2010, MIIT has started the trial mobile number portability service in Tianjin and Hainan, in 2012 the trial has extended to Jiangxi, Hubei and Yunan provinces. On 10 November 2019, all provinces started accepting MNP requests for all mobile carriers, except for technical difficulties, the MVNO phones, satellite phones and IoT phones.[2][3]\n\nMobile service carriers can be identified by the first three or four digits as follows:\n\nPrefix Carrier Network 2G 3G 4G 5G 10641 (13 digits) China Unicom (VNO for IoT purposes) N/A4 WCDMA7 LTE NR 130–132 China Unicom N/A4 WCDMA7 LTE NR 133 China Telecom1 N/A5 LTE NR 134(0–8) China Mobile GSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 1349 Chinasat (operated by China Telecom) Satellite 135–139 China Mobile GSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 140 (13 digits) reserved for China Unicom (IoT), due to NR technical difficulties, no 1400(0-9) numbers will be provided N/A 141 (13 digits) China Telecom (IoT)\n\ncurrently only 1410(0-9) are used, the rest, 141(10-99) are reserved for future 5G IoT card plans N/A5 LTE NR 142–143 (13 digits) reserved for future IoT carriers N/A 144 (13 digits) China Mobile (IoT)\n\ncurrently only 1440(0-9) and 1441(0-9) are used, the rest, 144(20-99) are reserved for future 5G IoT card plans GSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 145 China Unicom (formerly Data-plans only)\n\nonly new TD-LTE, LTE-FDD, LTE-A or NR wireless network card users may got a new 145 number, but can also be used to connect 3G network N/A4 WCDMA7 LTE NR 146 China Unicom (IoT) N/A4 WCDMA7 LTE NR 147 China Mobile (formerly Data-plans only)\n\nUsed for \"one SIM with dual-number\" service of CMHK in Mainland GSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 148 China Mobile (IoT) GSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 149 China Telecom (formerly Data-plans only)\n\nonly new TD-LTE, LTE-FDD, LTE-A or NR wireless network card users may got a new 149 number N/A5 LTE NR 150–152 China Mobile GSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 153 China Telecom1 N/A5 LTE NR 154 reserved for future mobile carriers N/A 155–156 China Unicom N/A4 WCDMA7 LTE NR 157 China Mobile\n\nalso used for CM wireless landlines GSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 158–159 China Mobile GSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 161 reserved for future mobile carriers N/A 162 China Telecom (VNO) N/A5 LTE NR 164 reserved for future mobile carriers N/A 165 China Mobile (VNO) GSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 166 China Unicom N/A4 WCDMA7 LTE NR 167 China Unicom (VNO) N/A4 WCDMA7 LTE NR 170(0-2) China Telecom (VNO) N/A5 LTE NR 1703 China Mobile (VNO) GSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 1704 China Unicom (VNO) N/A4 WCDMA7 LTE NR 170(5-6) China Mobile (VNO) GSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 170(7-9) China Unicom (VNO) N/A4 WCDMA7 LTE NR 171 China Unicom (VNO)\n\nalso used by Hong Kong 3 as sub-number of their SIM cards in Mainland N/A4 WCDMA7 LTE NR 172 China Mobile (IoT)\n\nUsed for \"one SIM with dual-number\" service of CTM in Mainland\n\nGSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 173 China Telecom N/A5 LTE NR 174(00-05) Tiantong (operated by China Telecom) Satellite 174(06-12) MIIT Emergency Communication Support Center emergency mobile call 174(13-89) reserved for satellite phones N/A 1749 Inmarsat2 Satellite 175–176 China Unicom N/A4 WCDMA7 LTE NR 177 China Telecom N/A5 LTE NR 178 China Mobile GSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 180–181 China Telecom N/A5 LTE NR 182–184 China Mobile GSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 185–186 China Unicom N/A4 WCDMA7 LTE NR 187–188 China Mobile GSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 189–191 China Telecom N/A5 LTE NR 192 China Broadnet N/A LTE6 NR 193 China Telecom N/A5 LTE NR 194 reserved for future mobile carriers N/A 195 China Mobile GSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 196 China Unicom N/A4 WCDMA7 LTE NR 197–198 China Mobile GSM4 N/A3 LTE NR 199 China Telecom N/A5 LTE NR\n\nChina Unicom before 2009\n\nOperated by China Transport Telecommunication Information Group Co., Ltd.\n\nTD-SCDMA networks deprecated by China Mobile in 2020\n\nChina Unicom finalize deprecated the GSM networks in 2021. A plan to deprecate GSM by China Mobile announced in 2023, scheduled to shut down in 2025[4][5]\n\nCDMA2000 1x Ev-Do networks deprecated in 2022,[4] and CDMA2000 1x RTT in 2024[6]\n\nLTE compatibility of China Broadnet SIM cards only available on Apple iOS devices\n\nWCDMA networks are being deprecated by China Unicom since 2023\n\n1G TACS networks were provided by China Telecom since 1987, operations transferred to China Mobile in 1999, the year China Mobile established, 1G shut down in 2001.\n\nTo call phone numbers in China one of the following formats is used:\n\nFor fixed phones:\n\nxxx xxxx | xxxx xxxx Calls within the same area code\n\n0yyy xxx xxxx | 0yyy xxxx xxxx Calls from other areas within China\n\n+86 yyy xxx xxxx | +86 yyy xxxx xxxx Calls from outside China\n\nFor mobile phones:\n\n1nn xxxx xxxx Calls to mobile phones within China\n\n+86 1nn xxxx xxxx Calls to mobiles from outside China\n\nThe prefix one is used exclusively by the national capital, Beijing Municipality.\n\nBeijing – 10 (formerly 1, abolished after GSM was introduced, to avoid conflict with mobile phone numbers with prefix 0 added (e.g. 0139-xxxx-xxxx))\n\nThese are area codes for the municipalities of Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing, as well as several major cities with early access to telephones. These cities have upgraded to an 8-number system in the past decade[when?]. All telephone numbers are 8-digit in these areas.\n\nShanghai – 21\n\nTianjin – 22\n\nChongqing – 23 1\n\nShenyang, Tieling, Fushun, Benxi – 24 2\n\nNanjing – 25\n\nWuhan, Huarong District of Ezhou – 27\n\nChengdu, Meishan, Ziyang – 28 3\n\nXi'an, Xianyang – 29 4\n\nGuangzhou – 20\n\n1 - Formerly 811 in urban area and 814 in Yongchuan, both abolished in 9 August 1997; 819 for Wanxian and 810 for Fuling and Qianjiang, abolished in 28 November 1998.\n\n2 - Formerly 410 for Tieling and 413 for Fushun, abolished in 28 August 2011;[7] 414 for Benxi, abolished in 24 May 2014.\n\n3 - Formerly 832, 833, abolished 2010.[8]\n\n4 - Formerly 910, abolished 2006.[9]\n\nIt's still unclear whether 26 will be provided or not, some local materials say that it's reserved for Taiwan (especially its capital Taipei), but currently they use +886.[10] Some proposals from planned independent cities (Chinese: 计划单列市) to get rights to operate 026 were also unsuccessful.[11][12]\n\nThese are area codes for the provinces of Hebei, Shanxi and Henan.\n\n1 - Formerly 378, abolished in 26 October 2013.\n\n2 - Formerly 397 for 7 east counties, abolished in 20 October 2005.\n\nThese are area codes for the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia, and the provinces in Northeast China (Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang). Additionally, numbers starting 400 are shared-pay (callers are charged local rate anywhere in the country) numbers [citation needed].\n\n1 - except Gongzhuling which still uses 434 of Siping\n\n2 - Hunchun formerly 440, abolished in 16 September 2006\n\n3 - Meihekou, Liuhe, Huinan formerly 448, abolished in 16 September 2006\n\n1 -Acheng formerly 450, abolished.\n\n2 - Includes Jiagedaqi and Songling, where considered part of Inner Mongolia by de jure\n\n1 - Jiagedaqi and Songling are de facto under the administration of the Daxing'anling\n\nPrefecture, uses 457.\n\nThese are area codes for the provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong (predominantly), Anhui, Zhejiang and Fujian.\n\nAll telephone numbers are 8-digit in Jiangsu.\n\n1 - Changshu, Kunshan, Taicang, Wujiang and Zhangjiagang are formerly 520, abolished in 20 April 2002.\n\n1 - Formerly 565 for Chaohu prefectural city era (i.e. before 2011), later splitted as: Hefei's 551 for Juchao district (now county-level Chaohu) and Lujiang county, Wuhu's 553 for Wuwei and Shenxiang Town of He county (now part of Jiujiang district), and Ma'anshan's 555 for He county (except Shenxiang) and Hanshan county.\n\n2 - Split from Fuyang in 2000, no new area code allocated.\n\n1 - Kinmen, Matsu, and Wuchiu are under Taiwanese control, and hence use international calling code of +886.\n\nAll area codes with prefix 6 were assigned in recent years. This prefix (+866) previously was reserved for Taiwan, which is now assigned (+886).[13]\n\nWhile most areas in Shandong use the prefix 53x 54x, some sites also use the prefix 6.\n\nWeihai – 631\n\nZaozhuang – 632\n\nRizhao – 633\n\nLiaocheng – 635\n\nLaiwu was using 634, now merged to Jinan's 531, former numbers are re-prefixxed as 5317 when merging.\n\nWhile most areas in Guangdong use the prefix 75x and 76x, some sites also use the prefix 6. The provincial capital Guangzhou uses code 20.\n\nShanwei – 660\n\nYangjiang – 662[14]\n\nJieyang – 663\n\nMaoming – 668\n\nChaoyang county-level city was using 661, now changed to 754 after splitted to Chaoyang and Chaonan districts and join Shantou.\n\nWhile most areas in Yunnan use the prefix 87x and 88x, a couple of areas also use the prefix 6.\n\nXishuangbanna – 691\n\nDehong – 692\n\nThese are area codes for the central provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong (predominantly), Jiangxi, and the autonomous region of Guangxi.\n\n20 - except Huarong district which uses Wuhan's 27.\n\n21 - Formerly 733, abolished.\n\n22 - Formerly 732, abolished.\n\n23 - Shunde formerly 765, abolished.\n\n24 - Split from Wuzhou Prefecture, original area code inherited.\n\n25 - Split from Liuzhou Prefecture, original area code inherited.\n\n26 - Split from Yulin Prefecture, original area code inherited.\n\n27 - Split from Nanning Prefecture, original area code inherited.\n\nThese are area codes for the provinces of Sichuan, Hainan, Guizhou, Yunnan (predominantly) and the autonomous region of Tibet.\n\n28 - Formerly 852, 853, abolished 2014.[15]\n\n29 - Dongchuan formerly 881, incorporated into 871\n\n30 - also de facto used by Wa State of Myanmar\n\nAll telephone numbers are 8-digit in Hainan.\n\nFormerly (most likely before 2000), Sanya, Wuzhishan, Lingshui, Ledong, Baoting and Qiongzhong were 899, Danzhou, Dongfang, Lingao, Baisha and Changjiang were 890.\n\nThese are area codes for northwestern regions including the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai, as well as the autonomous regions of Ningxia and Xinjiang.\n\n31 - Shared area code due to small size.\n\n32 - Area under the administration of Golmud uses 979, other landlines within the prefecture use 977.\n\n33 - except Wusu and Dushanzi District which use Kuytun's 992.\n\n34 - except Shawan county which uses Shihezi's 993, and Hoboksar county which uses Karamay's 990.\n\nFrom within Mainland China, the following emergency numbers are used:\n\n110 – Police (12110 for SMS to police, not for calling, 95110 for maritime policies[note 1], 96110 to report frauds)\n\n119 – Fire brigade (12119 for forest fire in some regions)\n\n120 – Ambulance\n\n122 – Traffic accident (incorporated into 110 in some cities) (12122 on expressways)\n\n999 – Privately operated ambulance (Beijing ONLY, calls outside Beijing is 010-999)\n\nIn most cities, the emergency numbers assist in Mandarin Chinese and English.\n\nStarting from 2012 in Shenzhen, an implemented system upgrade to unify three emergency reporting services into one number, 110. A similar approach is being installed in more cities in China to make them more convenient.\n\nDialing 112, 911, and 999 (outside Beijing without area code 010) plays a recording message about the correct emergency numbers in Chinese and English twice: \"For police, dial 110.
