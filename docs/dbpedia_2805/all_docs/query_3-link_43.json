        "text": "1. Subject Requirement\n\nStudents must successfully complete UC-approved courses in the A-G subject areas with a 'C' grade or better.* If you attend a California high school, check that the classes you take are on your school’s UC Certified Course List by referencing the A-G Course List resource website.\n\n*UC has temporarily suspended the letter grade requirement for A-G courses completed in winter 2020 through summer 2021 for all students. A-G courses completed in these terms with Pass (P) or Credit (CR) grades will satisfy appropriate A-G requirements.\n\n2. Grade Point Requirement\n\nStudents must earn a minimum GPA of 3.0 (3.4 for non-California residents) in all A-G courses. Only the grades you earn in A-G subjects in the tenth and eleventh grades – including summer sessions – are used to calculate your preliminary GPA.* Courses you took in the ninth and twelfth grades can be used to meet A-G subject requirements if you earned a grade of C or better, but they will not be used to calculate your GPA.\n\n*UC has temporarily suspended the letter grade requirement for A-G courses completed in winter 2020 through summer 2021 for all students. A-G courses completed in these terms with Pass (P) or Credit (CR) grades will satisfy appropriate A-G requirements.\n\nA Note on ACT & SAT Exams\n\nUCSB will not use SAT/ACT scores in our admission decisions or scholarship selection process. If you are admitted and choose to enroll at UCSB, exam scores may be used for course placement. For details on the UC system, visit the UC Exam Requirement page.\n\nSelection Criteria\n\nAdmitted applicants exceed the admission eligibility requirements above. UCSB considers 13 holistic review factors to review your achievements and personal qualities in the context of the opportunities and/or challenges you have experienced. We do not compare your application with any other applicant, regardless of school or location."
