Your signature must match the signature on your voter registration card.\n\nIf you are unable to sign your name on the return envelope, make an X or distinguishing mark by the red “X” on the return envelope, or have someone print your name on the return envelope and sign as a witness.\n\nWatch How to Return Your Completed Vote-by-Mail Ballot.\n\nHOW CAN I RETURN MY MAIL BALLOT?\n\nYou can return your vote-by-mail ballot by mail or in person.\n\nBy Mail: If you wish to use the mailed ballot instead of voting in person, fill it out and mail it back early, so that it is postmarked no later than Election Day.

Your county elections office may allow you to apply over the phone; please call them to see if your office allows telephone applications.\n\nCAN I VOTE IN PERSON EVEN IF I HAVE RECEIVED A VOTE-BY-MAIL BALLOT?\n\nYes! Even if you receive your vote-by-mail ballot, you can still vote at a polling place on Election Day as long as you haven’t returned your vote-by-mail ballot yet. Bring your unused vote-by-mail ballot to your local polling place anytime between 7:00 am and 8:00 pm on Election Day and give it to a poll worker, who will exchange it for a polling place ballot you can use instead.\n\nIf you do not bring your vote-by-mail ballot with you, you will not lose your opportunity to vote at a polling place on Election Day. If the poll worker is able to verify that you have not returned your voted ballot, then you will be given a regular ballot. If not, a poll worker will provide you with a provisional ballot, which will be counted after your county elections official has confirmed you are registered to vote in that county and did not vote more than once in that election.\n\nHOW DO I RECEIVE A BALLOT BY MAIL AS AN OVERSEAS OR U.S. MILITARY VOTER?\n\nOverseas citizens and US military personnel need to be registered as a military or overseas voter by completing the California Online Voter Registration (COVR) application.

In most cases, you can still register to vote and cast a provisional ballot on Election Day. This process is called Same Day Voter Registration.\n\nIncarcerated Voters & Returning Citizens:\n\nIn California, those who have been convicted of a felony and were sentenced to a prison term for that conviction will be eligible to register to vote immediately after their release, even if they are on probation or parole. Learn more.\n\nVoters without traditional residence:\n\nIn California, every eligible voter, including individuals experiencing homelessness, has the right to vote. They are able to register to vote as long as they have a location where they can receive mail and be assigned to a specific voting area. They have the option to register using an address where they spend most of their time, such as a shelter. In case they don't have a fixed address, they must provide a clear description of their living location when registering so that the county elections official can determine their voting precinct. This description can include nearby cross streets or a park. This process ensures they receive the appropriate election materials based on their living situation.\n\nCounty elections officials mail ballots to all active registered voters about a month before the election. You choose whether to vote in person at your voting location or return the ballot you received either by mail or by dropping it off.\n\nBy Mail: If you wish to use the mailed ballot instead of voting in person, fill it out and mail it back early so that it is postmarked no later than Election Day.

Learn more from the Secretary of State.\n\nElections officials process applications 29 days to 7 days before an election. You may request a Vote-By-Mail ballot more than 29 days before an election but not fewer than 7 days in advance. But if it’s 6 or fewer days before the election, you may qualify for an emergency ballot.\n\nIf you are voting by mail for the first time and did not provide your driver's license number, CA ID number, or the last 4 digits of your Social Security number on your registration application, you must provide a photocopy of the above ID with your vote-by-mail application. Other forms of ID include a recent utility bill, the county Voter Information Guide you received from your county elections office, or any other governmental agency document (like your passport, driver's license, student ID, etc.). If your ID cannot be verified, your vote-by-mail ballot will not be opened.\n\nYou can find a complete list of acceptable IDs here.\n\nTrack your Vote-By-Mail Ballot\n\nYou can track the status of your vote-by-mail ballot by visiting the \"My Voter Status\" website and the Where's My Ballot website.\n\nLate Vote-By-Mail Ballot Requests\n\nIf you would like to request a Vote-By-Mail ballot after 7 days before the election, you will need to apply in person at your county elections office.
