        "text": "Find Them Faster\n\nPRIZM Premier combines demographic, consumer behavior, and geographic data to help marketers find and engage their customers and prospects.\n\nKnow Them Better\n\nPRIZM Premier defines households with 68 demographically and behaviorally distinct segments discerning consumersâ likes, dislikes, lifestyles and purchase behaviors in a way thatâs contextual and easy to communicate and activate.\n\nSmarter Planning\n\nPRIZM Premier segments summarize complex consumer profiles in a way that is intuitive and easy to communicate.\n\nPRIZM Premier's 68 segments are defined according to socioeconomic rank, including characteristics such as income, education, occupation and home value as well as 11 Lifestage Groups and 14 Social Groups. PRIZM Premier Social Groups are based on urbanization and socioeconomic rank. PRIZM Premier Lifestage Groups are based on age, socioeconomic rank, and the presence of children at home.\n\nWith contextual insights from PRIZM Premier, marketers can craft advertising messaging to reach consumers based on virtually any purchase and media behavior.\n\nExpand Your Reach\n\nPurchase Behaviors Include:\n\nApparel\n\nAppliances\n\nAutomotive\n\nCommunications\n\nConsumer Package Goods\n\nFinancial Services & Wealth\n\nHome Furnishings\n\nMedia Usage\n\nTravel\n\nTechnology\n\nMedia Behaviors Include:\n\nTV\n\nCable\n\nInternet\n\nSocial\n\nPodcast\n\nMobile\n\nAudio\n\nPrint\n\nClaritas PRIZM Premier Lifestage Groups\n\nPRIZM Lifestage classifications provide a different way to look at groups of PRIZM Premier segments. While PRIZM Social Groups are based on both affluence and Claritas Urbanization, PRIZM Premier Lifestage Groups account for affluence and a combination of householder age and household composition.\n\nWithin three Lifestage classesâYounger Years, Family Life, and Mature Yearsâthe 68 segments are further grouped into 11 Lifestage Groups. Each Lifestage Group's combination of the three variablesâaffluence, householder age, and presence of children at home together offer a more robust picture of the consumer.\n\nClaritas PRIZM Premier Social Groups\n\nThe 14 Social Groups are based on Claritas urbanization class and affluence, two important and unique variables used in the creation of PRIZM Premier. There are four urbanization class categoriesâUrban, Suburban, Second City or Town & Rural. Within each of these categories, all the segments are then sorted into groups based on affluence, another powerful demographic tool when understanding consumer behavior and motivation.\n\nKnow Who To Target In Today's Complex Market\n\nP$YCLE Premier is a new segmentation model to help financial service marketers looking for customer-specific financial and investment behaviors for smarter targeting. Understand where your best customers live, work, play, how they engage and spend. LEARN MORE\n\nA Unique Methodology That Completes The Financial Picture\n\n60 P$YCLE Premier segments are defined by affluence and arranged into 12 broader Lifestage Groups, organized by lifestyle and financial behavior.\n\nIn addition to geodemographic and behavioral data, there are two innovative features playing key roles in the P$YCLE Premier model. The first is the addition of Big Data in property-level home value and characteristics and the second is a technology score, which measures a householdâs use of technology in their daily activities. These new enhancements work together to provide proven improvements in lift by 5-7% over P$YCLE, for even more accurate targeting.\n\nMeet a Segment: Family Funding\n\nClaritas Income Producing Assets (IPA)*\n\nA distinguishing feature of P$YCLE Premier is its use of the Claritas Income Producing Assets Indicators model, a proprietary Claritas model that estimates the liquid assets of a household, including checking accounts, saving products, money market accounts, CDs and retirement accounts.\n\nThe inclusion of the property-level home value data adds a new high-end break to our Income Producing Assets Indicator dataset, which is both a standalone product and a driver in P$YCLE Premier. While Income Producing Assets previously had 10 breaks and ended at $2MM+, it now has 11 breaks and ends at $3MM+. Additionally, our Net Worth indicator product now ends at $2MM+. This improvement to these products allows for unprecedented distinction and definition of high wealth segments.\n\nSmarter Planning\n\nP$YCLE Premier has a unique and wide range of applications for financial marketing and wealth identification, with the ability to link data necessary for the company-wide integration of a single customer concept.\n\nSmarter Targeting\n\nP$YCLE Premier is an actionable solution that helps you market smarter and win bigger:\n\nSegment customers in a safe, regulatory compliant way\n\nDrive retention and loyalty\n\nMatch your creative to your messaging, for greater ROI\n\nIdentify switchers from prospects for products\n\nCompare actual market penetration rates against the potential market size\n\nDevelop and enhance products offerings based on usage patterns\n\nDiscover a householdâs potential for additional products and services\n\nDetermine which financial products are upsold opportunities vs. the ânext, bestâ to offer\n\nEvaluate and map segmentsâ product usage or household balance in branch markets or branch trade areas\n\nMeasure market and branch composition to identify marketing strategies and set performance goals"
