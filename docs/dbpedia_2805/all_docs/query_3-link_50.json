        "text": "Transfer Credit Information\n\nUndergraduate students transfer into Cal State Fullerton may be awarded credit for courses completed at other regionally accredited colleges and universities. Student must submit an official transcript from each institution where they completed courses. Please submit the official transcript to the Office of Admissions .\n\nTransfer courses are applied toward degree requirements and are based on factors such as articulation agreements, unit limitation and General Education certification. For specific transfer credit information, please see the links below.\n\nArticulation Agreements\n\nArticulation agreements identify individual courses from transfer institutions that are comparable to, or \"acceptable in lieu of\" corresponding courses at Cal State Fullerton (CSUF). Successful completion of an articulated course assures that students will receive appropriate course credits after transferring to CSUF.\n\nArticulation Agreements with California Public Institutions\n\nThe ASSIST website is the official statewide repository of articulation information that includes UC Transferable Course Agreements (TCA), IGETC lists, CSU Baccalaureate lists, CSU GE Breadth lists, Course to Course Articulation, and Major Preparation Articulation for the Universities of California and the California State Universities.\n\nGo to the ASSIST website agreements between Cal State Fullerton and the California Community Colleges. Some course-to-course articulations with other CSUs are also available on ASSIST.\n\nARTICULATION AGREEMENTS WITH PRIVATE AND OUT-OF-STATE INSTITUTIONS\n\nIn addition to ASSIST, course articulation (course to course equivalencies) for some private and out-of-state institutions are available through the CollegeSource Transfer Evaluation Sytem (TES) site. Articulations for the CSU CourseMatch and Fully-Online courses are also available on TES. Students can view how other CSU online courses will be accepted at Cal State Fullerton.\n\nCourse to course equivalencies published on TES are subject to final approval by the department chair.\n\nYour browser does not support frames."
