        "text": "Artificial archipelago in Hainan, Danzhou\n\nOcean Flower Island (Chinese: 海花岛), or Haihua Island, is an under-construction, artificial archipelago located off the north coast of Danzhou, Hainan, China, west of the Yangpu Peninsula. The project, being built by the Evergrande Group, will consist of three independent islets with a total area of 381 hectares (940 acres).[1][2][3][4][5] The project has received an investment of 160 billion RMB (US$24 billion) and was scheduled for completion in 2020. During the 2021 National Day, the island attracted over 200,000 visitors.[6]\n\nCorruption and demolition order\n\n[edit]\n\nHainan politician Zhang Qi, who was later convicted of corruption, approved land reclamation for the island in conflict with environmental protection laws. The construction of the island caused damages to coral reefs and oyster populations. The boundaries of the environmental protection area around the island were later restored.[7]\n\nOn 30 December 2021, in the middle of its liquidity crisis, the developer Evergrande received a demolition order from the city of Danzhou relating to 39 buildings at the resort, due to planning law violation-they were built illegally. The company were given 10 days to take the buildings down. In a statement, Evergrande said the demolition notice applied \"only\" to buildings on plot 2-14-1 located on No. 2 Island and “does not involve other plots of land of the Ocean Flower Island project”.[8][9]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of islands of Hainan\n\nForest City (Johor)[10]\n\nPalm Islands\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nOfficial website"
