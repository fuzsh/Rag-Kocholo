        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow do I obtain a copy of the County of Los Angeles Building Code and Electrical Code?\n\nThe 2002 County of Los Angeles Building Code and the 2005 County of Los Angeles Electrical Code are available from: International Code Council (ICC) 5360 Workman Mill Road Whittier, CA 90601-2298 1-800-423-6587\n\nWhat is a Type V sheet and how do I get one?\n\nA Type V sheet is a detail sheet summarizing the \"Conventional Light-Frame Construction\" requirements specified in Chapter 23 of the Building Code for single story residential construction. Any portion of construction that does not meet the specific requirements of conventional light-frame construction requires engineering. The Type V sheet is an informational tool only and is not intended to be used in lieu of building plans. A copy of a Type V sheet may be found by going to our Forms and Publications page and clicking on the \"Building - Handouts\" subdirectories.\n\nHow long is a permit good for?\n\nA permit shall expire and become null and void if, 1) The work authorized by the permit is not started within 180 days of the date of permit issuance, or 2) The work is suspended or abandoned at any time after the work is started for a period of 180 days. Before any work can recommence on an expired permit, a new permit will be required and a fee equal to 50% of the original permit fee shall be payable provided the suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one year. If the suspension or abandonment has exceeded one year, a new permit will be required and full permit fees shall be paid.\n\nHow can I obtain a copy of the codes?\n\nThe 2007 California Building, Electrical, Plumbing, and Mechanical Codes are available for review at your local Building and Safety district office or they may be purchased from ICC, BNi, or IAPMO. The 2008 County of Los Angeles Building, Electrical, Plumbing, and Mechanical Code amendments to the 2007 California Codes are available by going to our Code Standards and Guidelines page and following the appropriate links. Addresses and hours of operation for each Building and Safety district office and contract city are available on our Local Offices page.\n\nWhat are permit fees based on?\n\nBuilding permit fees are based on the total value of all construction work, as well as all finish work, for which the permit is issued. You may refer to our Fees page for currently adopted fee schedules.\n\nWhere can I find the original plans for my house?\n\nThe County of Los Angeles Building Code requires that building plans be retained for a minimum of 90 days from the date of completion of the work covered on the plans. After 90 days, residential plans are typically discarded. The space required to store plans for every house built in the unincorporated county areas makes it prohibitive to keep them. One possible option for finding the as-built plans for any structure is to contact the original builder, designer, and/or engineer. This information can typically be found on the original building permit.\n\nI've been told that I don't need permits for buildings that are 120 sq. ft. or less. Is that true?\n\nOne-story detached accessory buildings used as tool and storage sheds, playhouses and similar uses, provided the gross floor area does not exceed 120 square feet, the height does not exceed 12 feet, and the maximum roof projection does not exceed 24 inches, are exempt from building permits. However, any electrical, plumbing or mechanical equipment installed in these structures do require separate permits. In addition, all structures regardless of size must comply with applicable zoning requirements. Please refer to the Department of Regional Planning website for more information on zoning requirements.\n\nHow big and how high can I build my house or room addition?\n\nLot coverage, height requirements, yard setbacks, and land use are determined by the County of Los Angeles Zoning Code. Please refer to the Department of Regional Planning website for more information on zoning requirements.\n\nHow long is a Building application plan check good for?\n\nA plan check application submitted to the Building and Safety Division is good for one year following the initial plan check submittal date. If a building permit is not obtained within that time, the plan check will expire. You may request an extension of 180 days by submitting a written request prior to expiration and paying an extension fee equal to 25% of the original plan check fee. A maximum of two extensions may be permitted. Please contact your local district office for further information. Once a plan check and any extensions have expired, the applicant shall resubmit plans and pay a new plan check fee.\n\nHow do I report a violation (construction without a permit)?\n\nYou may report a suspected violation in the unincorporated county areas by going to our Report a Violation page or by contacting the local Building and Safety district office. For suspected violations in an incorporated city, please contact the city directly. To determine which district office or city serves you, please refer to our Service Locator.\n\nAre there building codes (within Antelope Valley) against homes built from shipping containers? I have been researching this as a way to construct a home from these containers while using solar and/or wind power. I know that there is a company building these in San Fernando Valley but wondered where to start looking for the Antelope Valley for regulations and how \"green\" a house is allowed.\n\nLos Angeles County has policies in place to accept marine cargo containers used for incidental storage with certain agency approvals and container size requirements. However, when marine cargo containers are proposed for construction of a single-family residence or other habitable structure, the containers themselves, their connections, as well as the overall design of the building must all meet the building requirements of the 2008 Los Angeles County Building Code. Because the building code doesn't have specific provisions for marine cargo containers, it may be more challenging to justify their construction and use within your proposed application. A request for approval using Alternate Materials and Methods of Construction, as defined in section 104.2.8, may be required. Regarding \"green\" construction, the County of Los Angeles encourages sustainable building and has recently implemented its Green Building Ordinance. New single-family construction falls into this ordinance in a number of fashions, including recycling demolition debris and limiting irrigation water waste. Going above and beyond these requirements is certainly allowed, but just as the shipping containers, you will need to comply with all aspects of the Los Angeles County Building, Mechanical, Plumbing, and Electrical Codes. For more information, please contact your local Building and Safety Office and speak with a building plan check engineer. They will be able to assist you with site specific questions. Antelope Valley Building and Safety District Office 335A East Avenue K-6 Lancaster, CA 93535 Phone (661) 723-4440 Fax (661) 723-4435 Thank you for your inquiry.\n\nDoes a 96 square foot playhouse with a projected square foot area of 120 square feet require a permit? How large can it be? (Unincorporated LA County) Thank You\n\nIf you reside in the unincorporated Los Angeles County and contract cities, then the following information may apply. If not, please contact your local building and safety department in regards to your question. According to the 2002 Los Angeles County Building Code, Section 106.3, a building permit shall not be required for one-story detached accessory buildings used as tool and storage sheds, playhouses and similar uses, provided the floor area does not exceed 120 square feet. However, an electrical, mechanical, and/or plumbing permit(s) may be required. In addition, please contact your local building and safety district office for setback requirements. (A link is provided below for your convenience.)\n\nHow do I obtain a copy of the County of Los Angeles Plumbing Code and Mechanical Code?\n\nThe 2002 County of Los Angeles Plumbing Code and the 2002 County of Los Angeles Mechanical Code are available from: International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO) 5001 E. Philadelphia Street Ontario, CA 91761-2816 1-800-85-IAPMO\n\nWe added a family room off our garage without the proper permit and am now in the process of selling this home. I want to include this additional square footage to the total square footage of my home, but understand that it must first be approved. How can I get this approved now?\n\nTo determine if a permit has been obtained for the addition in question you will need to contact the Building and Safety Field Office serving your area. If you verify that a permit has not been obtained for the addition, you should speak with the office manager who will inform you on what is necessary to legalize the addition. The typical procedure to legalize the existing, un-permitted structure depends on the size and complexity of the addition, this can involve a variety of steps from having an engineer review the existing construction to demolishing and rebuilding portions of the un-permitted addition. Because the addition was originally constructed without the proper permit, it must now meet the requirements of the current codes before it may be permitted. This could involve retrofitting the foundation, walls, or framing to meet the requirements of today's building code requirements. The office manager will be able to guide you through the process in more detail.\n\nHow do I determine where my property lines are?\n\nBuilding and Safety does not have any information or maps showing the location of property lines. Property lines can only be accurately located by having your property surveyed. For more information, and to verify the license of a surveyor, please refer to the California Board for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors website.\n\nDoes L.A. County have any seismic codes requiring owners of pre 1975 concrete tilt up buildings to retrofit said buildings?\n\nChapter 95 of the Los Angeles County Building Code is dedicated to this subject. It applies to concrete tilt-up buildings for which a building permit was issued prior to April 13, 1975. This chapter provides systematic procedures and standards for identification of such buildings, and time periods under which these buildings are required to be structurally analyzed and anchored. Where analysis finds deficiencies, this chapter requires the building to be strengthened or demolished.\n\nI am proposing to construct an extension to my existing property, and I was told that I can obtain \"Drainage Release Covenants\" from my neighbors as an alternate to completing a hydrology study. (The extension will infringe on the \"flood fringe\" by 6 feet.) Are there standard forms which the County has for such Drainage Release Covenants?\n\nSection 110.1 of the Los Angeles County Building Code restricts the placement of buildings in flood hazard areas. This restriction shall not apply when it can be shown provisions are made to protect the building and that the proposed building will not cause any increased flood hazard on adjacent properties. A hydrology study and hydraulic analysis is required to make a determination regarding these provisions. A drainage release covenant is a mechanism, which a developer/applicant may use to obtain permission from an adjacent or adjoining property owner. When a developer/applicant proposes construction that will cause a minor alteration of the existing drainage conditions on an adjacent property, we require the developer/applicant to obtain the property owner's permission in the form of a drainage release covenant. However as indicated above, without a hydrology study or hydraulic analysis the potential increase flood hazard on adjacent properties can not be determined. If you have any further questions regarding this matter, please contact Mr. Mitch Miller, Drainage and Grading Supervisor, Building and Safety Division, at (626) 458-6390.\n\nHow can I obtain the original plans for my house?\n\nState law only requires the County to keep commercial and some multi-family structural plans. The Department therefore only keeps single family residential plans during construction and discards them 90 days after completion of the work. The space required to store all the plans of every house built in the County makes it prohibitive to keep them. Your best hope to find the as-built plans for any structure is to contact the builder, designer, and/or engineer.\n\nWhat is the permit process for an addition to an existing home? Where can I find information regarding setbacks, height, building size, etc.\n\nThe process of obtaining building permits is basically the same for additions/alterations as it is for new structures. This process begins with determining what type of structure meets the zoning requirements of the site. Type of occupancy, setbacks, height, and size limitations are all land-use issues covered by the County of Los Angeles Zoning Code (Title 22). The Department of Regional Planning (DRP) is the agency responsible for administering this Code. The DRP may be contacted online at http://planning.co.la.ca.us In addition, many of the local Building and Safety District offices house a Regional Planning representative on certain scheduled days. It is very helpful for an applicant to have a dimensioned plot plan illustrating an overhead view of the property with all structures outlined and distances to property lines and between structures identified. The existing and proposed construction should be clearly indicated as well. Once the land-use questions have been resolved, an applicant will need complete construction plans for the project. These plans are then submitted to the local Building and Safety District office. Any corrections needed to bring the plans into compliance with the County Building Code will be identified. Once the plans are approved, a building permit can be issued and the construction and inspection phase of the project begins. A listing of the Building and Safety District offices can be found on Los Angeles County Public Works website (http://ladpw.org) under Services/Construction/Permits/Permit Offices/Building and Safety.\n\nIs there a way to get a drawing (on-line) of my property that includes the property-lines and my house situated within the property?\n\nPresently our records relating to construction on privately owned property are not accessible on the Internet. Basic property dimensions are currently available on the County Assessor website. These maps will not have any representation of the buildings on a property.\n\nCan I obtain a copy of the construction plans submitted by the builder for my house?\n\nDepending on how long it has been since the plans were submitted, our local District office may still have a copy of the building plans. However, plans for single family residences are not retained permanently by our offices. If they do have a copy of the plans, you would be able to view those plans, but not reproduce them. This is because State law protects the work of architects, similar to copywriting of material by authors. If our office does not have the plans, our staff there should be able to provide you with information about the architect and/or builder. You would then have to contact them directly to see about obtaining a copy of the plans. Plans for single family residential homes are not kept more than 90 days after the completion of construction due to storage limitation restrictions.\n\nCan you help me get information on the number of commercial building permits issued in Los Angeles County in 2000 and 2001? Do you have the $ value of the construction?\n\n2000 - 3190 Permits - $296,520,410 2001 - 2544 Permits - $292,696,430 Basis Commercial Building Permits (no MEP, no other type) Unincorporated Area only Calendar Year\n\nI live in the unincorporated area of Monrovia and would like to build a block wall 6 feet high. Do I need a permit for this?\n\nIn the unincorporated Los Angeles County area, a freestanding fence or block wall may be constructed up to a height of six (6') feet without a permit. However, the Dept. of Regional Planning does have some restrictions on where that can be done. To completely answer your question, it would be necessary for a Regional Planning representative to review the layout of your property (site plan) with you. I would suggest that you contact our San Gabriel Valley District office at 626.574.0941. There is a representative from Regional Planning that periodically visits that office and would be able to provide answers specific to your property.\n\nWhat type of permit(s) are needed for a swimming pool in the County?\n\nPermits are required for all of the work necessary to build a swimming pool. In LA County, there are two ways to approach the required permits. The first, and most popular, option is to obtain a Combination Swimming Pool Permit. This Combination permit covers the construction of the swimming pool as well as the electrical, plumbing, and mechanical work directly related to the construction of the swimming pool. The other option is to obtain separate Building, Electrical, Plumbing, and Mechanical Permits for the work covered by each of these permits. The net result is the same either way, with the Combination permit being offered to reduce the amount of paperwork required of the applicant.\n\nI am considering building a concrete wall between my house and my neighbor's. What are the necessary procedures? Do I need to obtain a permit? If so, what are the building rules & regulations necessary to obtain a permit? Do I need to have a survey for the site? How is the cost determined by two parties?\n\nIn the unincorporated Los Angeles County area, a freestanding fence or block wall may be constructed up to a height of six (6?) feet without a permit. However, if the wall is to retain any soil, a permit may be necessary. The Department of Regional Planning has some restrictions on where and how high a wall can be built. To completely answer your question, it would be necessary for a Regional Planning representative to review the layout of your property (site plan) with you. I would suggest that you contact our closest District office and they can advise you where this can best be done. There is a representative from Regional Planning that periodically visits many of our offices and would be able to provide answers specific to your property. A survey of your property would generally not be required. If there is some dispute as to where the property lines are, you would probably be well advised to have a survey done. The matter of dividing and sharing the cost of the new wall is entirely up to you and your neighbor(s). How you share any costs is not regulated by the Building & Safety Division.\n\nIs construction of a detached wood frame garage generally permitted within an Earthquake Fault Zone Non-Structural Setback Zone?\n\nWhile most construction is restricted in an earthquake fault zone, Section 113.5 of the Los Angeles County Building Code does provide an exception for one-story, light-frame buildings not exceeding 1,000 sq. ft. in area or 12 ft. in height, and not for human habitation.\n\nCan a person check for Los Angeles County permits via the Internet?\n\nThank you for contacting the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works. We are currently in the process of upgrading and launching a new database with interactive capabilities. However, at this time, the information is not currently available via the Internet. If a property you are interested in is located in the Lancaster area, you may contact the Building and Safety Division's Lancaster District Field Office at the address and phone number shown below. Permit information is public information and may be viewed at the office at your convenience. Thank you. Lancaster District Field Office 335A East Avenue K-6 Lancaster, CA 93535 (661) 723-4440\n\nIn addition to the items listed below, what will be needed at the time of filing an application for a permit for a 6 stall breezeway/shedrow horse barn. 1. Plot plan approval (2 sets) 2. Engineered Structural calculations (2 sets) 3. Engineered drawings (2 sets)\n\nThank you for contacting the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works. At the time of plan submittal, the only item you will need in addition to those you have listed is a check for the plancheck amount. You may determine the fee for plancheck by contacting the Building and Safety Division's Antelope Valley District Field Office at the address and phone number below. Please note that there may be additional requirements and agency approvals that are needed prior to issuance of a permit, however, these items are not required at the time of plan submittal. Antelope Valley District Field Office 335A East Avenue K-6 Lancaster, CA 93535 (661) 723-4440\n\nI am planning to convert a closet into a bathroom and add a small addition to my home (about 400 square feet). Do I need a building permit, and if so, what is the procedure to obtain one?\n\nYes, you do need permits (building, plumbing, electrical, and possibly mechanical) to modify a room or build an addition to your home. The permits may be obtained from the Building and Safety District office which serves your area. For a list of LA County Building and Safety Offices, please visit https://dpw.lacounty.gov/bsd/content/fieldoffices.aspx where all of the addresses and phone numbers of field offices are available. The process of obtaining permits for this type of work is relatively simple. One of our plan check engineers will do a review of your plans, which normally can be accomplished while you are completing the permit applications (a 15-30 minute process at the Building and Safety District Field Office). Once the plans are approved and permits obtained, you may begin construction. There will be required inspections at certain intervals during the construction. The office staff can advise you as to when these will need to occur.\n\nI am planning to add a small addition to my house (about 400 square feet). Do I need professionally drafted plan or can I draw one as the owner? About how long would it take to obtain a permit?\n\nDue to the small scope of your project and assuming it is your home, you would not need plans prepared by a licensed engineer or architect under most circumstances. However, we would need drawings with sufficient detail to be able to confirm that the room size, ceiling height, and other requirements can be met. You may visit our website at http://www.ladpw.org/general/forms/download/787.pdf?CFID=5244389&CFTOKEN=56173609 for minimum requirements for plan submittal to get an idea of the information we will be looking for on the plans. The process of obtaining permits for this work is relatively simple. We will do a review of your plans, which normally can be accomplished while you are completing the permit applications (a 15-30 minute process at the Building and Safety District Field Office). If the project is more complicated, our engineers will need to take in the plans for a thorough review, that could take up to two weeks. Once the plans are approved and permits obtained, you may begin construction. There will be required inspections at certain intervals during the construction. The office staff can advise you as to when these will need to occur.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was able to find a listing online of the requirements for a building permit such as what size building does and doesn't require a building permit. During the last few days, I have been unable to refind this info. If this info is still available online, please provide the link info.\n\nThank you for contacting the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works. Our Building and Safety Division has recently posted a large number of documents on the Internet. You may find this information by visiting www.ladpw.org and searching our 'Forms' in the top right portion of the screen. By typing 'minimum' in the search field, you will find the minimum plan submittal requirements for obtaining a building permit. A large quantity of other information is available by searching these documents using a keyword search. If you are not able to find specific information, please contact your local Building and Safety District Field Office shown at the link provided below. Thank you.\n\nWhat are the rear and side required setbacks as well as required rear yard open area and any relevant building plans requirements for room addition?\n\nThe Department of Regional Planning governs setback requirements for unincorporated Los Angeles County areas. They may be contacted via the web link below. For a room addition, you may view the minimum requirements by visiting the 'Minimum Requirements' link below and typing \"Residential Minimum Requirements\" in the search field. A .PDF file will open showing all of the requirements for construction in the Los Angeles County area.\n\nDo I need a permit to put a fense around my house?\n\nIf you live in an unincorporated area in of Los Angeles County, a building permit is not required to construct a fence less than 6'0\" in height. However, depending on the location of the fence (front yard, side yard, or back yard), you may need to obtain approval from the Department of Regional Planning. We have provided a link to their web site below for your convenience. If you live within an incorporated city you should check with your city's planning department.\n\nLooking for \"structural observation program and designation of the structural observer\" form to place on construction plans per plan checker request.\n\nThe forms you have requested are available on our Internet site at the link shown below. Simply type \"Structural\" in the search field and the forms you are requesting will appear. You may print them using any version of Adobe Acrobat.\n\nDo you have your rough grading certification and precise grading certification forms on your website?\n\nYes we do! Please visit the web link below and type in 'grading' for the keyword. Click search. The forms you are looking for are titled 'ENGINEERED GRADING CONSULTANT STATEMENT' and 'ENGINEERED/REGULAR GRADING CONTRACTORS STATEMENT'. Thank you for your inquiry.\n\nI plan to build a 3 feet high free-standing block wall in my backyard along my property line. However, the block wall will be situated along the edge of a downward slope of about 10 feet high. Do I need to get a permit for building this block wall?\n\nThank you for contacting the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works. You may need to obtain a permit for the construction of the wall you have described due to its location adjacent to a slope. Please visit your Building and Safety Division's local District Field Office (see link below) and ask to speak with a plan check engineer. She or he will be able to further assist you, and if you do not need a permit, explain the requirements for the footing for the wall located on/near a slope. Thank you for your inquiry.\n\nI am looking for the standards on a full set of construction documents. I also need updated information for building codes for those projects (residential) to be built in the flight zone of LAX. I am looking at adding 1200 to 1800 s.f. to my existing home and remodeling the interior of the existing. I plan on undertaking this project as owner operator.\n\nThank you for contacting the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works. There are a number of requirements, mostly related to sound insulation and construction design techniques that must be incorporated into residential design in the flight zone area you have described. You will need to contact the Building and Safety Division's Firestone District Field Office at the address shown below to obtain the details for construction. With respect to the design, a homeowner may design his or her own home, under the condition that it is of conventional construction. A plan check engineer at the Firestone office can explain to you the details of conventional construction. However, if the addition/remodel is considered to be non-conventional, you may be required to hire a licensed architect or engineer to work with you on the design and calculations. Please feel free to address further detailed questions to our professional building plan check engineers at out Firestone district office. Thank you. Building and Safety Division Firestone District Field Office 7807 S. Compton Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90001 323-586-6541\n\nI purchased a home that has unpermitted additions and conversions. Is there a such thing as \"as is\" permits since I have no information on who built them. Can/will the city fine me for having these unpermitted conversion/additions on my property? Is tearing them down mandatory?\n\nThank you for contacting the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works. If your property is located in the unincorporated area of the County of Los Angeles, the following information will apply to you. If your property is located in the City of Los Angeles, please visit the City of L.A. Building and Safety site below for correct information. The typical procedure that is followed when this type of construction is encountered is to legalize the existing, un-permitted structure. Depending on the size and complexity of the addition, this can involve a variety of steps from having an engineer review the existing construction to demolishing and rebuilding portions of the un-permitted addition. Your first step in this process, and to determine what additional steps will be necessary to legalize the addition, is to contact the office manager of our Building and Safety Division's Lomita District Field Office. You should explain the situation to the manager and make an appointment for a building inspector to visit the property and take a preliminary look at the addition. Finally, because the addition was constructed without permits, when it is permitted now, it must meet the requirements of the current codes. This could potentially involve retrofitting the foundation, walls, or framing to meet the requirements of today's building code requirements. The office manager will be able to guide you through the process in more detail at each step of the way. Thank you for your inquiry. County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works Building and Safety Division Lomita District Field Office 24320 S. Narbonne Ave. Lomita, CA 90717 310-534-3760\n\nMy neighbor is building a playhouse that is about 12 feet tall with posts anchored in concrete. The Playhouse is set back from my back yard fence approximately 2 feet (23 inches) from my property line/fence. Is there a minimum set back for this kind of construction? Did they need a permit? Do I have any recourse if this is not to code?\n\nThank you for contacting the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works. Depending on the size of the playhouse, a building permit may be required for its construction. Based on the zip code provided in your inquiry, you may contact our Building and Safety Division's Calabasas District Field for more specific requirements. In addition, the County of Los Angeles Department of Regional Planning has some minor language on the construction of such accessory buildings as you have described. You may contact them if you wish at the web link provided below.

My neighbor at the above address built a 7-8 foot concrete wall dividing our properties. It has created a huge blind spot for the back 3 houses. Is there a height limit?

This wall was extended up to approx. 7 feet and another return wall meets the back end of my garage wall. I have no access to my garage wall or the full perimeter of my property. It is now a part of my neighbors back yard. Is a permit required for this? What can be done to regain access to the full perimeter of my property.

This could involve retrofitting the foundation, walls, or framing to meet current building code requirements. The office manager will be able to explain the process in more detail.

Now that we both know where the property line is between the two houses, she wants to install the fence right on the property line. This will result in making holes on the brick wall between the two houses.

When they bought it, the agent showed them the county record as living area is 1847 sq.ft. (The lot size is over 9,000). But after they closed Escrow, they would like to apply a Patio Enclosed permit from Temple City city hall since it was rainning heavily this year. When they were in the counter of the city planning department, they were told that the city record for this house with the living area is only 1360 sq.ft.(The lost size is the same as county's). They were told that before they applied Patio Enclosed, they should legalize the different part between city's and county's. They've already hired the architect to draw the exist house plan and submitted to the city hall planning department. The planning department reviewed it already, said they will contact either architect or them, but right now one month passed and no phone call has been received yet. They've contacted them several times but no answer yet. Question 1: Is it right that sometimes the city record is different from county record? If it is, whose record should be complied with? Question 2: Usually how long should the planning department review the plan?
