        "text": "We plan a PSPS when severe weather may put you at risk of wildfires:\n\nLow humidity\n\nForecasted high winds\n\nDry material on the ground\n\nVegetation near powerlines\n\nRed Flag Warning from the National Weather Service\n\nReal-time observations from weather experts and ground crews\n\nLearn about weather monitoring\n\nHigh wildfire risk areas\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has sorted regions according to their wildfire risk.\n\nHomes and businesses in Tiers 2 and 3 wildfire risk areas are more likely to experience a PSPS.\n\nTier 2: An area where there is an elevated risk of wildfire.\n\nTier 3: An area where there is an extreme risk of wildfire.\n\nView the CPUC map and learn more about high fire-threat areas,\n\nWe know power outages are disruptive. We want to help you prepare.\n\nWe will always do our best to alert you before a PSPS via email, phone call and/or text.\n\nWe'll send you PSPS alerts as early as possible, both day and night, as needed. This is a requirement from the California Public Utilities Commission. If you are a PG&E account holder, you do not need to sign up to receive PSPS alerts.\n\nNote: Weather forecasts can change. This could shift the shutoff timing or the number of affected customers. Because of this, in some cases we may not send the first alert until the same day your power is shut off.\n\nMedical Baseline and Vulnerable Customer alerts\n\nIf you rely on power for health and safety, we offer extra PSPS alerts. This may include alerting you in person to ensure you're aware of a possible PSPS.\n\nThe Medical Baseline Program supports those who depend on power for certain medical needs.\n\nVulnerable Customer Status also supports those who rely on power for health and safety. You can self-certify if youâ€™re not eligible for Medical Baseline.\n\nSign up for the Medical Baseline Program\n\nSign up for Vulnerable Customer Status\n\nTranslated alerts\n\nWe provide information about when power will be turned off and back on via phone, email and text. This is available in English, plus 15 languages.\n\nWe work with our partners to conduct multilingual outreach. We also pre-record alert messaging in American Sign Language to serve those who are deaf and hard of hearing.\n\nSign up for alerts in your preferred language"
