        "text": "Special Collections Recycling Notice\n\nRecycling collection for our Special Collections customers has been temporarily suspended due to long wait times for maintenance for the trucks.\n\nSpecial collection customers are those with mobility impairments and those who live on narrow streets where the big trucks cannot safely collect trash and recycling.\n\nESD staff will post on the website, update voicemail, and hand deliver notices prior to when Collections will resume.\n\nUpon receiving a truck, we will collect all of your recycling. If your recycling wonâ€™t all fit in your blue cart, please put the excess in cardboard boxes or paper bags if possible. We will collect recycling from plastic bags if necessary, but please leave them untied.\n\nESD is committed to working with you to collect your recycling. If you have further questions, email us at esd@santafenm.gov or call 505-955-2200.\n\nThank you for your patience during this time, and thank you for recycling!\n\nResidential Cart Repair/Replacement: email us your address, service day, and the serial number located on the front of your cart.\n\nClick here to download the Rate Ordinance- Cart Replacement Fee\n\nA cart replacement fee of $60.00 will be charged to customers due to negligence other than normal wear and tear and for requests for replacement due to customer preference. We do not charge customers for damage caused by collection vehicles or workers.\n\nCarts should only be used for household trash and recycling. Carts are most often damaged by customers when hot ashes, chemicals, or even fireworks are placed in the cart. These things can cause the combustion of trash or recyclables that damage or melt the plastic resin. Carts can also be damaged when loaded with remodeling or landscaping materials such as rock and brick. Make sure the ashes are dead out and cold."
