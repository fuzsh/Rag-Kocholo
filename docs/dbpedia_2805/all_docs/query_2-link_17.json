        "text": "Apply for name approval and registration\n\nThe first step in registering a WFOE in China is to choose an compliant name and get it approved.\n\nThe name choice must follow rules set up in Chinese company registration laws. The company name must include the company industry or brand, operating region of the business, and a suffix of “Company Limited.”\n\nThe following will be checked during name approval:\n\nAvailability of the requested name. This can be checked independently on the SAIC website (http://www.saic.gov.cn/sbjEnglish)\n\nInclusion of restricted words, such as “China”, “State” or “National”\n\nInclusion of foreign characters or symbols\n\nWhether the name is confusing or misleading\n\nDon’t forget the importance of naming strategy and branding. Just as overseas, your company’s name is the first impression of your company. It should clearly reflect the company role and image. Consideration should also be made of the characteristics of the Chinese characters. Many words or characters have similar meaning or sounds which can strongly influence the impact of the chosen name (both positively and negatively!)\n\nNote that the name registration can be done early whilst you prepare further, and to aid trademark registration. It is not necessary to immediately submit company filing to MOFCOM after the name is approved. Note also that it is common to submit more than one name for consideration.\n\nRent office space as necessary\n\nBefore submission for WFOE incorporation, it is necessary to have a lease for company space in the city of registration. The contract for this needs to be valid for a year from registration date. It is advisable to include a condition in the leasing contract to cancel the lease in case of registration refusal or difficulties. As with any contract in China, steps should be taken to minimize future problems – such as checking the owner’s details and land rights certificate for the property being leased.\n\nCarry out environmental impact assessment – Only for a manufacturing WFOE\n\nIf registering a manufacturing WFOE, an environmental impact assessment will need to be carried out by a registered agency. This is done in order to obtain an approval certificate from the local environmental protection authority.\n\nThe procedure and required approval varies with the scale of the manufacturing operation and its potential impact, and will include consideration of material used, produced and disposed, machinery to be used, as well as any existing plans for environmental protection.\n\nOnline registration via MOFCOM\n\nThe registration process has been significantly simplified in recent years, and now makes use of an online filing submission. This is much faster than the previous methods, but still requires a lot of documentation! It should be noted that there is a somewhat greater burden with online submissions to have all details correct and finalized. The process of “blind submission” does not allow for discussion with authorities during submission. If rejected, the application will need to be revised and resubmitted.\n\nApply for a “5 in 1” business license from local AIC\n\nFollowing approval from MOFCOM, the application for a business license with the local Administration of Industry and Commerce (AIC) needs to be made. This is another process that has been greatly simplified and quickened in the past couple of years. An application is now made for a so-called “5 in 1” business license, which covers all the major licenses required for a new company. Previously each of these required separate applications and naturally this was much more time consuming.\n\nAgain, this is now an electronic submission, accompanied by significant documentation (see section on documents required). Once submitted the AIC will share documentation with other relevant authorities to issue licenses – a major time improvement!\n\nThe 5 licenses issued by the AIC are:\n\nThe business license\n\nTax registration certificate\n\nOrganization code certificate\n\nSocial security registration certificate\n\nStatistical registration certificate\n\nThe company now exists and is licensed to do business in China, and the remaining set-up steps can be considered “post licensing” tasks. We would expect to reach this point in 2-3 months.\n\nCarving chops for the new company\n\nTo Chinese business newcomers, the importance of chops is often a surprise! Every company requires a set of chops, or seals, to be used as representation for signing official documents. These hold the final say, above individual signatures.\n\nChops can be applied for through the Public Security Bureau (PSB) following company set up. Several additional chops are needed for different business areas (e.g. financial, invoice sealing and customs if appropriate). Each will have the company name in Chinese and English if required.\n\nOpening bank accounts\n\nOnce chops are obtained, they can be used to open the WFOEs Chinese bank accounts. A WFOE should have at least two accounts, preferable with the same institution (Chinese or foreign banking institution are equally acceptable depending on company preference).\n\nA local currency RMB standard company account. This can be used for payments and receipts in RMB, as well as for company tax payments and day to day operating costs.\n\nA separate capital contribution account, designated in foreign currency. This is the official account through which capital can be injected from overseas.\n\nVAT registration\n\nWFOEs must be registered for VAT payments with the local tax bureau. There are two different categories for VAT registration for all companies – “general” and “small scale” (with low sales volume). A new WFOE which qualifies for small scale may choose to register under either category.\n\nIn general, a lower VAT rate is paid for companies that qualify as small scale, but there are some potential advantages in registration for general status (such as the ability to deduct input VAT). Discussion of individual situation with a tax expert is advisable here.\n\nCustoms and import-exit registration – for trading WFOEs only\n\nFor trading WFOEs involved in import-export there are several additional registrations required, which are not automatic under the AIC business license application. These must be made separately following company incorporation and the exact requirements depend on the company operation area, but will likely include the following:\n\nImport-export license\n\nCustoms registration certificate\n\nRegistration with Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau (for quality inspection)\n\nIssue contracts and complete necessary registration for employees\n\nWhilst this is not formally necessary before the company starts trading, it is best at this stage to ensure everything is set up correctly. Formal contracts need to be issued from the new WFOE for all local employees. Also, registration will need to be made for employee tax and social benefits accounts.\n\nCompanies may well already have local employees working for them, often through a previous representative office structure or employed on their behalf by a Chinese agency. The new WFOE can now employ them directly."
