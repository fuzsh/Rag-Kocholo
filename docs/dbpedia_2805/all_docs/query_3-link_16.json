        "text": "San Dimas Sheriff’s Station is one of seven stations within Field Operation Region III. The station encompasses approximately 276 square miles in its patrol area. In addition to serving the City of San Dimas, the station serves the unincorporated communities of Azusa, Covina, Glendora, La Verne, Claremont, Pomona, and a large portion of the Angeles National Forrest.\n\nThe population for the areas policed by San Dimas Station is approximately one hundred and five thousand (105,000), nearly sixty-nine thousand (69,000) in the unincorporated areas and more than thirty-six thousand (36,000) in the City of San Dimas.\n\nSan Dimas Sheriff’s Station is located in the eastern portion of Los Angeles County, adjacent to the cities of La Verne and Pomona. The station serves the City of San Dimas and the unincorporated communities of Covina, Azusa, Glendora, La Verne, and Claremont. The station also provides law enforcement for the Azusa Canyon and Mount Baldy areas of the Angeles National Forest (State Route 39).\n\nIn the summer of 1927, Sheriff William I. Traeger assisted in the establishment of the original San Dimas Sheriff’s Station to serve the fruit growers and poultry raisers in the eastern section of Los Angeles County. The first station consisted of a large frame house located on San Dimas Avenue near downtown.\n\nOn May 25, 1950, a new “modern” Sheriff’s station opened on the same site. On August 4, 1960, San Dimas became the 70th city to incorporate, and contracts with the Sheriff’s Department and the Los Angeles County Fire Department for law enforcement and fire services.\n\nOn September 23, 1987, the Walnut Sheriff’s Station opened in the City of Walnut (located approximately 8 miles S/W of San Dimas). The command of San Dimas Sheriff’s Station was then consolidated with that of Walnut Sheriff’s Station.\n\nIn 2006, San Dimas Sheriff’s Station opened a new station and it is currently under the command of Captain Don Slawson.\n\nSan Dimas Sheriff’s Station is noted for its outstanding Mountain Rescue Team, established in 1955, which performs technical rescues and searches in the rugged terrain of the nearby Angeles National Forest. This unit, located at 114 E. First Street, consists of highly trained and dedicated men and women volunteers and Reserve Sheriff’s Deputies. They currently respond to an average of seven rescue calls per month involving lost hiker searches and rescues of injured persons. The station is also supported by Patrol and Posse Reserve Units.\n\nSan Dimas Sheriff’s Station has a fully staffed Detective Bureau which investigates burglaries, assaults, and many other crimes. The city of San Dimas contracts for three Special Assignment Deputies who are also bicycle patrol certified. They provide specialized “problem-oriented policing,” which addresses quality of life issues within the city of San Dimas. A crime prevention officer coordinates Business and Neighborhood Watch Programs, in addition to youth and school programs.\n\nIt’s a proven fact that if graffiti is quickly removed, the offender is less likely to tag in that area again.
