She was an imperative leader on the four-time World Championship and three-time Olympic gold medal 4x400m relay team. Considered one of the world’s fastest women, she has the most sub-50 second 400m races in history. Named Visa Humanitarian of the Year in 2005, her namesake charity, the Sanya Richards Fast Track Program benefits children in need in her native Jamaica. After announcing her retirement at the 2016 Olympic Trials Sanya quickly joined the NBC Olympic broadcasting team where she color commentated all the sprinting events at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nSanya breaks down how mental health hit the mainstage in the most recent Olympic games. Mental health is just as important as physical health, she explains, and talks about her growth and success after seeing a sports psychologist."
