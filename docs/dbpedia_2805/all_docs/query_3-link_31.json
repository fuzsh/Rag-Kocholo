        "text": "Visiting the Vatican - Top tips you need to know!\n\nPlanning on visiting the Vatican when you come to Rome?\n\nHere's everything you need to know!\n\nVisiting the Vatican - everything you need to know\n\nHere is what you really need to know about visiting the Vatican:\n\nWhen to go? (what time of year and time of day)\n\nWhat to see? (St. Peters Basilica and the Vatican Museums, and much more!)\n\nWhich should you visit first, the Vatican Museums (Sistine Chapel) or Saint Peter's Basilica?\n\nHow to skip the lines for Saint Peter's Basilica?\n\nHow to get tickets/skip the line to the Vatican museums?\n\nCan you just visit the Sistine Chapel?\n\nCan you see the Sistine Chapel without crowds?\n\nHow do you visit the Vatican Gardens?\n\nHow do you visit St Peter's tomb?\n\nHow to plan all your Vatican visits for your trip?\n\nHow to get to the Vatican?\n\nWhere to eat near the Vatican?\n\nThe first time I came to Rome as an adult, I missed seeing the Sistine Chapel because I had no idea the Vatican Museums closed at 2pm (long before smartphones and Google, ahem.)\n\nIt must have been a Free Sunday, when the Vatican Museums are open and free but with reduced hours.\n\nNow that I live here, I go often to Saint Peter's Basilica, Saint Peter's Square, and the Vatican Museums.\n\nI also helped thousands of our guests plan their visits in the 17 years we ran our B&B.\n\nBased on years of first-hand experience, I know what to do and what not to do.\n\nYou can avoid a stressful visit to the Vatican by reading my tips first!\n\nVisiting the Vatican - When to go\n\nVisiting the Vatican - What to see?\n\nThe main things to see when visiting the Vatican are Saint Peter’s Basilica and the Vatican Museums.\n\nYou can see one and not the other, although visiting both in a single day is very do-able.\n\nJust try not to plan any other big visit like another museum or archeological site like the Colosseum for the day you visit the Vatican, as you will be pretty exhausted.\n\nDo you really want to visit the Vatican and Colosseum in one day? Here's how!\n\nOr take the stress out of it by taking this \"Rome in a Day\" Tour with Vatican, Colosseum & Historic Center.\n\nSt Peter's Basilica\n\nSaint Peter’s Basilica is a Renaissance-era church and by many standards, the world’s largest.\n\nThe Vatican is a basilica but not a cathedral, as it does not have its own bishop.\n\nThe main cathedral of the “Bishop of Rome”, as the pope is called, is San Giovanni in Laterano, or Saint John in Lateran.\n\nBut the pope is head of Vatican City, where he resides.\n\nIt's a little confusing isn't it?\n\nAnyway, just think of the Vatican as a huge church, with a lot to see inside.\n\nClick here to read more about what exactly the Vatican is.\n\nClick here to visit my dedicated page all about Saint Peter's Basilica and its history, and things to see and do there.\n\nSt Peter's Dome\n\nIt's worth visiting the basilica's dome, but you should know it can get a little crowded up there, and there are a LOT of steps.\n\nThe first level is 231 steps, but there is an elevator option.\n\n(Someone in a wheelchair or with walking difficulties can take the lift to this first level.)\n\nThe second portion is another 320 steps, with no elevator option.\n\nThe dome gets narrower as you go up, so you will be climbing this part single file, and with the roof slanting over your head.\n\nI say this as someone with a close relative with vertigo: you may want to avoid climbing the dome at the Vatican if you suffer from vertigo or claustrophobia.\n\nBut if none of that is an issue, then do it!\n\nYou'll love the views from up there, both of the church and of the surrounding city.\n\nVisit my dedicated page all about Saint Peter's dome and how to climb it.\n\nMichelangelo’s Pieta\n\nMy favorite piece of art inside of St Peter's Basilica is Michelangelo’s Pietà.\n\nActually, it may be my favorite piece of art in the world.\n\nAn exaggeration?\n\nI can't help it...just look at it:\n\nIt’s on your right as soon as you walk inside Saint Peter's Basilica.\n\nWhen I visited it with my mom, she cried, saying “look at her face, it’s just about a mother’s love for her child.\"\n\nUnfortunately, someone wielding an axe once attacked it, and it’s now behind glass.\n\nBut you can still see it very well.\n\nAnd take note of Mary’s face.\n\nIt’s really special when you see it in person.\n\nVatican Grottoes - The Tombs of the Popes\n\nInside Saint Peter's Basilica, you can go down one level and see the area where some of the popes are buried.\n\nSaint Peter is said to be entombed just underneath the church.\n\nThis is why many popes are also buried here.\n\nIt's quite interesting to visit the popes' tombs, called the Vatican Grottoes - there is a lot of history down there.\n\nDon't worry, it's not dark or claustrophobic.\n\nOn the contrary, it's a huge open space full of light and lots to see (no photos allowed.)\n\nTo visit the Vatican Grottoes, get up close to Bernini's Baldachin and look for the entrance nearby.\n\nIt's free to visit the Vatican Grottoes.\n\nYou should make sure you are done visiting the basilica or have a plan to go back up, because the normal route through the grottoes has you exit the basilica entirely.\n\nNot to be confused with St. Peter's tomb\n\nWhen people talk about visiting the Vatican grottoes, they are referring to a place where you can see the tombs of many popes (as I wrote above.)\n\nBut this is not the same as visiting the Vatican Necropolis, where St. Peter is said to be buried.\n\nA visit to Saint Peter’s tomb, also referred to as a scavi visit, is a special and wonderful thing to do, and I highly recommend it.\n\n(\"Scavi\" means \"excavations\".)\n\nIt is a delicate archeological site, and they only take 250 people in per day, in 12-person tours at a time, so you must book way in advance. (No photos allowed.)\n\nThe Vatican Museums\n\nThe second major site to visit at the Vatican is the Vatican Museums.\n\nThis is the part about Vatican City that will take most of your time and energy.\n\nThe Vatican Museum contains the world’s largest private art collection (and just imagine that much of the art they own is not even on display!)\n\nThey are called \"museums\" and not just singular \"museum\" because the museums were started in 1506 and have been added to many times over the centuries.\n\nThey now occupy many different buildings all connected to on another.\n\nThat's one reason there is so much to see!\n\nYou will see a lot of art inside the Vatican Museums, including paintings, sculptures, ancient artifacts, and much more.\n\nI think the number one thing people want to see when they visit is the Sistine Chapel.\n\nFor more about the Vatican Museums and Sistine chapel, visit my dedicated pages:\n\nVisiting the Sistine Chapel\n\nMichelangelo and the Sistine Chapel\n\nVisiting the Vatican Museums\n\nVatican Museums Must Sees\n\nVatican Museums Tickets\n\nVatican Museums Tours\n\nVatican Secret Rooms\n\nMore things you will see at the Vatican:\n\nBesides the two main sites - the museums (Sistine Chapel) and the basilica, there are more things you will see when you visit Vatican City.\n\nLook for these as you walk around:\n\nSt. Peter's Square\n\nIt would be easy to take Saint Peter's Square, Piazza San Pietro in Italian, for granted.\n\nAfter all, if you're beelining to get into the basilica, you might be focused on the security queues and wondering how long you will have to wait.\n\nBut St. Peter's Square, also called Vatican Square, is worth visiting and enjoying by itself.\n\nIt's the only part of Vatican City you can visit without any tickets or queuing.\n\nIf you have very limited time, you may even decide that this is about as much as you want to see of Vatican City, since everything else involves queues and/or tickets plus an involved visit inside.\n\nClick here to visit my page all about St. Peter's Square, its history, and what to see.\n\nThe Swiss Guard\n\nYou might spy one or more of the Swiss Guard at the gate to Vatican City.\n\nThe Swiss Guard wear different outfits depending on their duties, but they are all dressed in costumes originally designed in the early 1500s (although not by Michelangelo, an urban myth.)\n\nThe Swiss Guard have a specific duty to guard the pope's life and Saint Peter's Basilica.\n\nThey are the world's smallest army and they are well trained.\n\nYou will not see the Swiss Guard at the Vatican Museums.\n\nThere, you will see Vatican Museums guards who dress in more modern attire.\n\nThe Leonine Walls\n\nIn the 9th century, Pope Leo IV had defensive walls built around Vatican City following the sacking by raiders of Old St. Peter's Basilica in 846.\n\nYou can still see those walls today in and around the Vatican, especially if you visit the Vatican Gardens.\n\nYou can also see parts of these walls surrounding Saint Peter's Square on the side where the security gates are, and along the way from the Vatican to nearby Castel Sant'Angelo.\n\nClick here to read a more detailed yet brief history of the Vatican.\n\nThe Vatican Post Office\n\nDon't miss a visit to the Vatican Post Office if you want to mail any postcards.\n\nIt's easier and more efficient than going to the Italian Post Office, and your mail will get there faster!\n\nThere is also a Vatican mailbox up on the roof (Saint Peter's Dome), and usually another post office in Saint Peter's Square.\n\nMore sites you can visit in Vatican City\n\nBesides Saint Peter's Basilica and the Vatican Museums, there are some more sites you can visit in Vatican City.\n\nYou have to pay for these (and for the scavi and gardens, you must book in advance.)\n\nYou will find more details about each one on their respective dedicated pages:\n\nSaint Peter's Tomb (Vatican Necropolis or Scavi)\n\nSaint Peter's Dome\n\nVatican Gardens\n\nWhich to see first - The Vatican Museums/Sistine Chapel, or St. Peter's Basilica?\n\nIf you book a tour of the Vatican, usually this means taking a guided tour of the Vatican Museums, which ends with the Sistine Chapel.\n\nSome tours include taking the shortcut from the Sistine Chapel into St Peters Basilica.\n\nThere has been some back and forth recently about whether the shortcut is available or not, but as of 2024, it is once again the case that you can only take the shortcut from the Sistine Chapel to St Peter's Basilica if you are on a tour that INCLUDES the basilica.\n\nThe Vatican can, and does, change their mind frequently on this matter, so if it is important to you to be able to take this shortcut, I recommend booking a tour that ends in St Peter's Basilica to be on the safe side.\n\nIf you are on a tour that ends in the Basilica the decision is made for you.\n\nBut if you are taking a Vatican Museums tour that does not include the Basilica, or if you are visiting the Vatican Museums on your own, you'll have to decide what order to visit the museums and the basilica in, assuming you want to visit both on the same day, which many people do.\n\nHow long does it take to visit the Vatican Museums?\n\nTo visit the Vatican Museums (where the Sistine Chapel is), you need a purchase a ticket (unless you come on the Free Sunday.)\n\nOnce inside, even if you go quickly, you will need about 2 hours for this this visit.\n\nIf you are not able to take the shortcut from the Sistine Chapel to Saint Peter's basilica, you will exit the museums where you entered them.\n\nThis is about a 15-20 minute walk from Saint Peter's Square and the entrance to the basilica.\n\nClick here to see a map of Vatican City and how far apart the entrances of the Museums and the Basilica are (it opens in a new window.)\n\nHow long does it take to visit Saint Peter's Basilica?\n\nA visit inside Saint Peter's Basilica could take anywhere from 1-2 hours, not including the time you spend in line waiting to go through security (assuming you go through security in the front and do not take the shortcut from the Sistine Chapel.)\n\nTo visit Saint Peter's Basilica, you do not need (nor can you buy) tickets, as it's free to go inside.\n\nBut you do have to wait in the line for security, which is airport-style - there is an x-ray machine to put your items in and you will walk through a metal detector.\n\nAnd that can cause the queues to get pretty long.\n\nLately, the lines to get into Saint Peter's Basilica have been so long, they are looping back again around the square.\n\nIf you book a Vatican Museums tour that does not allow you access to the Basilica, and/or you want to visit the Basilica separately, even on a different day, I'd suggest getting to Saint Peter's Basilica when it opens at 7 AM (if you want to avoid the line).\n\nThe lines are longest from about 10 AM - 5 PM, and in high season can be long throughout the day, even from 7 AM until closing!\n\nSkipping the lines at Saint Peter's Basilica\n\nThe easiest way to skip the lines at Saint Peter's Basilica is to visit it using the shortcut from the Sistine Chapel (which currently is only available on booked museum tours that end in Saint Peter's Basilica).\n\nYou can only take the shortcut from the Sistine Chapel to St Peter's Basilica if you are on a tour that INCLUDES the basilica.\n\nIf you only plan to visit Saint Peter's Basilica, and not the museums, or you decide to visit these two sites separately, you can avoid the queues by following the tips in my video above:\n\nCome when it opens at 7 AM\n\nCome in Low Season\n\nBook a visit to Saint Peter's tomb\n\nUse the Pilgrims' entrance - reserved for prayer or attending mass or confession\n\nSkipping the line to get into the Vatican Museums\n\nThis may be the number 1 question I get about visiting Rome - How to skip the line for the Vatican Museums?\n\nIt's quite simple:\n\nYou can pre-purchase tickets to the Vatican Museums through the Vatican's website. This means that you will not have to stand in the line waiting to buy tickets. You will, however, have to wait in a very short line of others like you, who have pre-booked tickets and have to pick them up. (The tickets you purchase in advance are more of a voucher, and they must be converted into physical paper tickets to enter the museums.) You also still need to go through security as everyone does. So you do not entirely skip the line, but your line will be much shorter.\n\nYou can pre-purchase tickets to the Vatican Museums through a ticket reseller. There is usually a small surcharge for this but it can be worth it due to 1) Ease of use and/or 2) the possibility of finding tickets available here when tickets are not available on the Vatican Museums' website.\n\nYou can purchase an Omnia Pass or Turbo Pass. These will also get you a tour with a guide from the Vatican Museums, as above. It’s not as simple as it sounds and you will need to be careful to understand what you are getting into. Click here to go to my page about the Roma Pass and Omnia Pass or to this page about other Rome City Passes for more details about these passes.\n\nYou can book a tour of the Vatican Museums, either with a tour company or with the Vatican Museums themselves. Your entry tickets are included in the tour, so you only have to go through the security line.\n\nIf you book a visit to the Vatican Gardens, skip-the-line tickets to the Vatican Museums are included!\n\nI do not recommend this at all, but if you have not booked tickets, and they are sold out online, and you find yourself arriving at the Vatican Museums, you will ALWAYS find touts selling you a skip-the-line ticket or tour. I don't recommend it because you cannot be sure they are legit, and if they are, you have no idea what kind of tour you are getting. I also just can't stand, in principle, to be so bombarded by these guys every time I am within a mile of Vatican City. But it can be a good option if it's your last recourse and the lines are crazy long. Just be aware that only licensed tour guides may give tours inside Vatican City.\n\nVisiting the Vatican Museums with a Guide\n\nMost Vatican City tourism consists primarily of a visit inside the Vatican Museums, which always includes the Sistine Chapel.\n\nSome tours also include a visit or even a tour inside Saint Peter's Basilica.\n\nYou may expect a guided tour of the Vatican Museums and Basilica to last roughly three hours total.\n\nTo find out about the many different kinds of tours you can book, visit my page about Vatican Museum Tours, which breaks down your options between group tours, early access tours, semi-private tours and more.\n\nCan you just see the Sistine Chapel?\n\nNo, you cannot just see the Sistine Chapel.\n\nTo see the Sistine Chapel, you must go through the entire Vatican Museums, which can take at least 2 hours if you tour it and see the highlights.\n\nThe Sistine Chapel is at the very end.\n\nThat said, if you are interested in an \"Express Tour\" of the Sistine Chapel, you can book this tour that skips the line then beelines to the Sistine Chapel and finishes in Saint Peter's Basilica.\n\nThis tour is only 1 hour and 45 minutes and does not include a tour of the rest of the Vatican Museums.\n\nYou do still have to walk through them, but the focus of the tour will be the Sistine Chapel and Saint Peter's Basilica.\n\n(If you are really pressed for time, you could peel off once you get to the basilica and just not finish the tour.)\n\nis it worth taking the time to explore the museums?\n\nI really do believe that visiting the Vatican museums is absolutely worth doing in its entirety, even if you really only wanted to see the Sistine Chapel.\n\nThe rest of the museums are truly wonderful.\n\nYou have the Raphael rooms, the maps gallery, the floor-to-ceiling tapestries, papal apartments, Etruscan art, and so much more.\n\nClick here to visit my page about the top 10 Vatican Museums must-sees.\n\nI highly suggest taking a tour to visit the museums.\n\nThey will take care of getting your tickets.\n\nBut if you go your own without a tour, you could get the audio guide, or follow my instructions here for the best way to visit the Vatican Museums.\n\nAnd you will have to book your tickets on your own.\n\nIf you are heading to the Vatican in the morning, as I said above, I suggest you visit Saint Peter’s Basilica first, and the museums later, because the queues for Saint Peter's Basilica have gotten so long (sometimes it's a 1-2 hour wait to get in!)\n\nIf you decide to go to the Vatican Museums first, just make sure to leave enough time to stand in line to visit Saint Peter's so that you get inside while there is still some daylight, so you can enjoy the sun coming through all the stained glass.\n\nCan you see the Sistine Chapel without the crowds?\n\nPerhaps the easiest way to see the Sistine Chapel with fewer crowds is to come in really low season.\n\nBut we hardly have a low season anymore in Rome, and even when we do, somehow the Vatican is always still crowded.\n\nSo how can you see the Sistine Chapel without the crowds?\n\nIt is possible!\n\nWith the below tours, you will have a VIP, exclusive experience, and you'll get to enjoy the Sistine Chapel almost alone:\n\nOpen the Vatican Museums with the Key Master\n\nOn this exclusive tour with Walks of Italy, you will have true VIP access to the Vatican museums - literally accompanying the guard who opens all the doors to get the museums ready for visits.\n\nYou will accompany the Vatican Museums Key Master as you walk through the museums, turning on the lights, even inside the Sistine Chapel!\n\nWatch my video to see what it's like:\n\nHow to plan all your Vatican trips during your stay\n\nThe typical way of visiting the Vatican is to spend half a day seeing the Vatican Museums and Saint Peter's Basilica.\n\nThese are both easy to fit into a typical 3-day visit to Rome.\n\nI have found that often when people can get tickets to special things at the Vatican, like St Peters tomb (the Vatican Necropolis, or scavi), the Papal Audience, or the Vatican Gardens, they often want to also visit the Vatican Museums on the same day.\n\nHere's my advice for visiting Vatican City when you want to see more than just the Vatican Museums:\n\nIncluding the Papal Audience\n\nHow to visit the Vatican Museums and attend the Papal Audience\n\nPapal Audience tickets are not difficult to come by, and since it's \"in the morning\", many visitors assume it would be a good idea to go to the Vatican Museums right after the audience.\n\nI don't agree.\n\nIf you are really short on time, then, you CAN go to the Vatican Museums after the Papal Audience.\n\nIt's just that this is going to make for a pretty exhausting day.\n\nTo go to the Papal audience, you need to get there by 8am to get a decent spot, let alone a seat.\n\nThe audience begins around 9:30 AM and finishes around noon.\n\nYou'll probably want to grab at least a snack or lunch somewhere in there.\n\nThis means going inside the museums from about 2 PM once you have made your way to the Vatican Museum entrance.\n\nIf you also visit St. Peter's Basilica after the museums (which is typical), that is a 3-4 hour visit.\n\nAnd a very long day.\n\n(Also, if you want to climb the dome, you likely won't get there in time.)\n\nMy suggestion?\n\nIf you can break these visits up over two days, I would.\n\nAttend the Papal Audience and then go inside Saint Peter's Basilica (and climb the dome if you want.)\n\nThen on a separate day, visit the Vatican Museums and see the Sistine Chapel.\n\nIncluding a visit to the Scavi (St Peter's tomb)\n\nHOW TO VISIT THE VATICAN MUSEUMS AND also take a scavi tour\n\nAt the end of the scavi tour (St. Peter's tomb), you wind up inside Saint Peter's basilica.\n\nSo you will already see that.\n\nYou could also climb St. Peter's dome if you have time and energy.\n\nVisiting the Vatican Museums takes easily 2.5 - 3 hours, and that does not include the time it takes GETTING there once you leave the basilica.\n\nIf you are coming to the museums from St. Peter's basilica, you need to factor in about 15-20 minutes' walk to the Vatican museums entrance.\n\nThis is after you've already done a 1.5 hour scavi tour, and spent time walking around one of the largest churches in the world.\n\nSo as you can see, adding the Vatican Museums makes it a pretty exhausting day.\n\nIf you need to do it all in one day, make sure to book your scavi tour first, then book your museums visit with at least 4 hours between visits.\n\nMy suggestion?\n\nBreak this up over two days.\n\nBook the scavi tour.\n\nYou have no control over when they will grant you tickets, so if you are lucky enough to get them, you can then book other things around that.\n\nPlan to see St. Peter's basilica (and climb the dome) on this day.\n\nThen, book your Vatican Museums visit for another day.\n\nHOW TO VISIT ST PETERS TOMB, THE VATICAN MUSEUMS (SISTINE CHAPEL), AND ATTEND THE PAPAL AUDIENCE\n\nYou are definitely going to need two days.\n\nFirst book the scavi visit which is never on a Wednesday mornings anyway (the Papal Audience is on Wednesdays.)\n\nPlan to visit St Peter's Basilica after that, since you will come out into the basilica after the tour anyway.\n\nIf you want to climb St Peter's dome, you will do it on this day.\n\nThis is a pretty long and full day by itself.\n\nThen, once you get your Papal Audience tickets, book your tickets or tour of the Vatican Museums for after the audience (even if I said above I discourage doing all this in one day, at least if you don't include the basilica it's a little less tiring).\n\nThis will be a very full and long day also.\n\nIncluding a visit to the Vatican Gardens\n\nIF YOU WANT TO VISIT THE VATICAN GARDENS AND VISIT THE SCAVI (St. Peter's Tomb)\n\nIf you are able to get tickets to St. Peter's tomb (scavi) and also the Vatican Gardens, congratulations!\n\nHere's how to include visiting the Vatican Museums and St. Peter's basilica as well.\n\nFirst book the scavi visit.\n\nThen book the Vatican Gardens tour on a different day, and plan to visit the Vatican Museums right after the gardens, as it's included in your ticket price with the gardens.\n\nVisit St. Peter's Basilica after the scavi, again, on a different day from the Gardens/Museums.\n\nIf you want to do it all - visit the Vatican Museums, vatican gardens, papal audience, scavi tour and st peter's basilica and dome\n\nHow you plan your days fitting in these visits will depend on two things - the Papal audience, which is always Wednesday morning 10am - 12pm (although you need to get there by no later than 8am); and the time of your scavi booking (which depends on the scavi office - you cannot control this).\n\nOnce you get those two bookings, the next difficult booking to get is for the Vatican Gardens.\n\nSo book that one around the Papal Audience and scavi tour.\n\nNote that tours of the Vatican Gardens are at 9am or 11am.\n\nThey are also not held on the morning of the Papal Audience.\n\nMy suggestion?\n\nI'd suggest you spread this over 3 days.\n\nOr, to fit this into two (intense) days, try to do the scavi tour after the Papal audience, if you can get scavi tickets for the afternoon.\n\nThen book the Vatican Gardens, Vatican Museums, and St. Peter's Basilica on a separate day.\n\n(And climb St. Peter's dome once you are inside St. Peter's basilica if you like.)\n\nHow to Get to Vatican City\n\nYou have several options for how to get to the Vatican.\n\nBut the most important factor to consider is what you are visiting first.\n\nClick here to see a Google map showing where the different entrances are for the Vatican Museums, Saint Peter's Square, and the scavi entrance.\n\nIt will open in a new window.\n\nHow to get to the Vatican Museums\n\nThe Vatican Museums entrance is on Viale Vaticano.\n\nIf you plan to take a taxi, just tell the driver \"Vatican Museums\".\n\nVisiting the Vatican Museums and arriving by Metro\n\nOtherwise, the most common way to get there is by Metro.\n\nRome's metro red line A has two stops, equidistant from the entrance to the museums (about a 10-12 minute walk): Ottaviano and Cipro.\n\nThe Ottaviano metro stop is the first one you will come to if you are coming from Rome's center.\n\nWhen you emerge from the metro station, you just need to follow the crowd towards Vatican City.\n\nOnce you see Michelangelo's bastions (walls), follow them to the right and you will come to the entrance of the Vatican Museums.\n\nIf you are visiting the Vatican museums from the opposite direction, or if you forget to get off at Ottaviano, or, better yet, if you want to get off at the next stop to get some fabulous pizza by the slice from Bonci's Pizzarium, then you will get off at Cipro stop.\n\nHowever, from this stop, you cannot see the same stream of people, nor can you immediately see the Vatican City walls, so you will need to navigate a little bit to find the walls.\n\nOnce you see the walls, follow them until you come to the entrance.\n\nVisiting the Vatican Museums and Arriving by Bus\n\nAnother option for arriving at the entrance of the Vatican museums is to take a bus or buses.\n\nMany buses will get you pretty close to the entrance of the Vatican museums.\n\nThese include the 492, 49, 23, and the 81.\n\nHow to Get to Saint Peter's Basilica and Square\n\nThe entrance to St. Peter's Basilica is on Saint Peter's Square.\n\nThis is about a 15-20 minute walk from the Vatican Museums, so if you are not visiting the Vatican Museums (or not visiting them first), and want to go directly to the basilica, you can still take the metro, but make sure to get off at Ottaviano, not Cipro.\n\nFrom Ottaviano metro stop, St. Peter's Square is about a 10-15 minute walk.\n\nFollow the crowds, but at the walls, do not make a right towards the museums, just keep going straight.\n\nBuses that arrive closest to St. Peter's Square include the 40 and the 64.\n\nHow to get to the Scavi/St Peter's Tomb\n\nIf you are visiting the Vatican for an appointment to see St. Peter's tomb, the fastest and easiest way to arrive is by taxi.\n\nThey can drop you right in front of the entrance where you need to go, which is at the Swiss Guard, to the left of the basilica as you face it.\n\nIf you take a bus, get the 64, as it drops you about a block away.\n\nTo take the metro, make sure to get off at Ottaviano, and give yourself about 20 minutes' walking time from there to get the the entrance of St. Peter's tomb.\n\nWhere to Eat Near the Vatican\n\nThere is no place to eat inside St Peter's Basilica or in St Peter's Square (there is a tiny snack bar on the roof of the basilica, which you can only access if you climb the dome.)\n\nThere are some cafés and fast-food options inside the Vatican Museums.\n\nThere are also fun dining options you can book, and combine with your visit to the Museums.\n\nOtherwise, visit my page about lots of options for eating breakfast, lunch, dinner and aperitivo near the Vatican."
