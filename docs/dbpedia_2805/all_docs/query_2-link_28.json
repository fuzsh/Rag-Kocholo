        "text": "PCA National Advisory Board Member, Sanya Richards-Ross (@SanyaRichiRoss), is a world champion and olympic gold medalist in track & field. She was an imperative leader on the four-time World Championship and three-time Olympic gold medal 4x400m relay team. Considered one of the world’s fastest women, she has the most sub-50 second 400m races in history. Named Visa Humanitarian of the Year in 2005, her namesake charity, the Sanya Richards Fast Track Program benefits children in need in her native Jamaica. After announcing her retirement at the 2016 Olympic Trials Sanya quickly joined the NBC Olympic broadcasting team where she color commentated all the sprinting events at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nHere, Richards-Ross talks about the impact sports had on her life. She states, \"I felt like sports were my greatest life teacher.\" From understanding what delayed gratification truly meant to what being gracious in victory and humble in defeat felt like, she attests sports to every life lesson she has learned along her journey through her business entities to motherhood and beyond."
