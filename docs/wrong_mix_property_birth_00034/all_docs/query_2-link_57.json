        "text": "By Steve Newton\n\nOne of the best concerts I’ve ever seen was Neil Young & Crazy Horse at the Pacific Coliseum on April 17, 1991.\n\nThat was seven months after the band had released its stellar album, Ragged Glory, and it was kicking major ass, with Young accompanied by rhythm guitarist Frank Sampedro, bassist Billy Talbot, and drummer Ralph Molina.\n\nAlthough Sampedro is no longer in the lineup–having been replaced by Willie Nelson’s son Micah Nelson–Crazy Horse is still a force to be reckoned with. At least that’s what Young’s old musician buddy from Winnipeg, Randy Bachman, wrote on his Facebook page a coupla hours ago:\n\nLast night, I saw Neil Young and Crazy Horse in concert. Let me tell you, this show was the perfect summer night. It was great to be outdoors at Toronto’s Budweiser Stage and reunite with his crew, family & friends, sound man Tim Mulligan & his manager.\n\nIf you had polled the audience for a perfect setlist, it couldn’t have been any better on this sold out show. Hits and album cuts back to back with everyone singing along to Neil’s signature mix of rock and country–Heart of Gold, There Comes a Time and so many more, followed by a double encore.\n\nNeil and I go back to Winnipeg in the 60’s. We’ve stayed connected all these years and collaborated together. It’s always great to see him and his wife Daryl.\n\nSounds like Neil Young is still kickin’ it at the age of 78. I guess those with tickets to his sold-out show on July 23 at Burnaby’s Deer Lake Park will find out for sure.\n\nAs for 80-year-old Bachman, he’ll be hitting the road with BTO this summer for a tour that lands at the Pacific Coliseum for a PNE show on August 20. There’s plenty of tickets available for that one, though."
