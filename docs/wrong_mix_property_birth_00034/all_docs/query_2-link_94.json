        "text": "He’s always straddled the line between loner and consummate hipster…\n\nHis greatness, from a Canadian perspective (in Canada's The Walrus):\n\nThe romance that Neil holds for American listeners is obvious; he’s\n\nalways straddled the line between loner and consummate hipster. His\n\ncharm seems accidental, as nothing about him seems to make sense: his\n\nlyrics consist of one-liners pieced together with nonsense, and they\n\nrarely seem as punchy on second thought as they do when he delivers\n\nthem; his guitar technique is like that of a kid trying to emulate his\n\nheroes before he’s finished learning how to play. At his most\n\ninteresting, Neil is a relative moderate embroiled in a world of\n\nexcess, chronicling his friends’ downward spirals with insight but far\n\nfrom square himself. In short, he’s always been cool, but he’s never\n\nbeen a fuck-up or a ham.\n\nSome people call this mystique; I call it Canadianness. The\n\nqualities that make Neil so appealing to young Americans are the ties\n\nthat bind him to his place of birth. And these qualities look much\n\nbetter from a distance—shyness and reserve go nicely with a Laurel\n\nCanyon pedigree. He has the bearing of someone who grew up in a tougher\n\nclimate, who had some experience with manual labour but plenty of time\n\nto think. It’s worth noting that 2005’s Prairie Wind, on\n\nwhich he sings of Canadian geese and the Trans-Canada Highway, was\n\nrecorded in Nashville: The North has its own cachet, comparable to that\n\nof the South. Neil has a certain northern authenticity, from his\n\ndiscovery of “Four Strong Winds” on a jukebox in the prairies through\n\nhis early days playing folk clubs in Winnipeg and Toronto. If you grew\n\nup in New York City, Neil’s early life might seem awfully interesting.\n\nIf you grew up here, there’s a good chance that his adolescence was\n\nsimilar to your dad’s.\n\nThe problem with this analysis is that it makes the mistake most rock writers made, which is to assume that everything is about attitude. (For instance, the line about Young not having learned to play guitar, which is kind of like saying Count Basie didn't know how to play piano, because he didn't play a lot of notes. It's absurd.)\n\nBut with that said, it's true that Young is about as reticent as rock stars get, and probably yes, that has something to do with being a Canadian."
