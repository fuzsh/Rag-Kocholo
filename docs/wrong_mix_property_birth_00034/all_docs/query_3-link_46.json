        "text": "NEW YORK (CBSNewYork/CBS News/AP) -- Donald Trump's presidential bid drew cheering supporters this week, but his campaign song choice did not draw any cheers from its author, Neil Young.\n\nAt the Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue Tuesday, businessman and reality television star Trump was introduced by his daughter Ivanka and came down an escalator with his wife Melania to the song Young's song \"Rockin' in the Free World.\"\n\nA day later, Young posted a statement on Facebook saying the song had been used without his permission. Young, a Canadian citizen, wrote that he would not allow his music to be used for a candidate.\n\n\"Music is a universal language. so I am glad that so many people with varying beliefs get enjoyment from my music, even if they don't share my beliefs,\" Young wrote. \"But had I been asked to allow my music to be used for a candidate - I would have said no.\"\n\nYoung has also said he is a supporter of Bernie Sanders, a candidate on the opposite side of the political aisle.\n\nA Trump campaign representative said through a license agreement, Trump \"paid for and obtained the legal right to use\" the song but \"won't be using it again,\" closing with the compliment, \"Trump likes Neil very much.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Trump Announces 2016 Presidential Bid\n\nAs CBS News' Jan Crawford reported Wednesday, Variety Senior Editor Ted Johnson said it's embarrassing for the campaign when a musician pushes back.\n\n\"Donald Trump joins a long list of Republicans who have kind of gotten in trouble with artists because the first thing in their minds is 'I don't want it to make it look like I'm endorsing a candidate that I don't agree with,'\" Johnson said.\n\nAfter Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker used music from the Dropkick Murphys, they had a message for him too, CBS News reported:\n\nSome campaigns have taken more creative control over what supporters hear at rallies, CBS News reported.\n\nDr. Ben Carson hired a gospel choir to belt out Eminem's \"Lose Yourself\" at his presidential announcement last month.\n\nAnd nearly two weeks ago, Rick Perry took the stage to a personalized version of a country rap song, \"Answer to No One.\" Perry even made a push for sales of the Colt Ford song, CBS News reported.\n\nIn making his announcement Tuesday, Trump became the 12th high-profile Republican to enter the 2016 race, with more to come in the weeks ahead.\n\n\"All of my life, I have heard, a truly successful person, a really successful person, and even a modestly successful person, cannot run for public office, just can't happen,\" Trump said. \"Yet that's the kind of mindset you need to make this country great again.\"\n\nTrump got off right away running, bragging, bashing and trash-talking his way into the Republican race. He has big plans, but little use for what politicians have done in America.\n\n\"How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are they to allow this to happen?\" he said. \"We have people that are stupid. We have people that aren't smart. We have losers. We have people that don't have it. They don't have a clue. They can't lead us.\"\n\nOne thing Trump said he has is money -- and lots to spend.\n\n\"I'm not using donors, I don't care,\" he said. \"I'm really rich.\"\n\nAnd Trump did lay out a very clear agenda:\n\n\"I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that,\" he said. \"I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.\"\n\nTrump was also required to release a personal financial disclosure that includes his net worth, sources of income, liabilities and assets. He also has to reveal the same information for his wife and dependent children.\n\nTrump was ready to do so. On Tuesday, he shared details about his personal finances, revealing a net worth of $8.7 billion.\n\n(TM and Â© Copyright 2015 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
