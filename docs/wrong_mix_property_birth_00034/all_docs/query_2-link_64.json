        "text": "About what Neil Young is worth...\n\nClearly he is worth a very large sum of money, a 100 million?...I would suspect a lot more since his ranch alone is worth a hug amount by now. After 40 plus years of success...albums and touring, and not being a fool like many of his contemporaries etc. , but the real answer is none of our business...\n\nTo his fans he is worth far more than a dollar sum. I saw him preform two nights ago and I was just as impressed, or moved as I was 40 years ago, he's actually better now than when he was 25. And I have been disappointed by some of his shows over the years...when he wasn't in any shape to preform, but I suppose it hasn't always been easy being Neil Young either...I mean people want to know how much money you have, and I'm sure a lot more...\n\nI read the lyrics to \"World on a string,\" yesterday, it pretty much covers it.\n\nSo he doesn't worry about money, just what people want from him...unfortunately it's not just his music. We all have to worry about who to trust, suppose you were very rich and famous, wouldn't you want to lay that burden down sometimes?\n\nI've no doubt contributed to his great wealth in a small way over the years, but this relationship has never been about money. You can't buy his talent or my appreciation...\n\nOne thing is certain...Neil Young doesn't do what he does for money, he hasn't needed more money for a long time. So be assured what Neil Young does is who Neil Young is"
