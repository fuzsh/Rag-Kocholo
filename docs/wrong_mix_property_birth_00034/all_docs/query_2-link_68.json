He told 'The Globe and Mail' in December 2021, \"I love Canada. Coming back is always a joy. There’s a certain lightness to Canada that is not like any other place. People are friendly. It’s a beautiful, natural country compared to other places on the planet. It’s in my blood. When I come to Canada, I feel like I’m home. I feel relaxed, and the longer I stay the more comfortable I get.\"\n\nReferred to as \"the Canadian Bruce Springsteen\" by Robin Scherbatsky on 'How I Met Your Mother,' Bryan Adams comes from Kingston, Ontario. He one of the best-selling artists of all time selling over 75 million albums worldwide.\n\nBorn in Ottawa, Ontario, Morissette is now a dual American/Canadian citizen. While she got her start in pop, she made an alt. rock splash with her classic 1995 album 'Jagged Little Pill,' which has sold more than 33 million copies worldwide.\n\nLester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) said of The Guess Who in the 2000 film 'Almost Famous,' \"Give me The Guess Who. They got the courage to be drunken buffoons, which makes them poetic. Like BTO, The Guess Who hail from Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nOne of the most-influential singer-songwriters of all time, Cohen was born in Westmount, Quebec. He's received countless musical honors before his 2016 death at age 82, including being part of the 2008 class of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame."
