        "text": "Neil Young has gone into his tape vaults – which at this point, lets acknowledge, are full of gold – and emerged with some recordings made in 1969 with his best backing band, and the one he’s had the longest relationship with, Crazy Horse. I’ve got to tell you, I can’t stop listening to this album. There have been times when Young has released a single album from a certain time period and I’ve snapped it up only to then find he’s included said album in an upcoming box set… “double dipping” into my wallet. With Archives Volume I and Archives Volume II both out already and ’69 covered on the first of those sets I don’t think this is a teaser for some other box set.\n\nI just love Neil Young with Crazy Horse. Of course, by the time I started listening to rock n roll in the late 70s, I thought Crazy Horse was just like the E Street Band or to a lesser degree the Silver Bullet Band, and they were Neil’s permanent back ups like those other outfits were for Springsteen and Seger respectively. It turns out Neil’s choice about who to work with tends to be a bit more “mercurial” and changes from album to album. He will do an album by himself with various other musicians backing him up then flit back over to working with Crazy Horse, and then perhaps over to the Stray Gators and then occasionally jump into CSNY. On some Neil LPs you can find songs by “all of the above.” You just never know who he’s going to play with next. He even did an album with Pearl Jam once upon a time. He’s apparently as commitment phobic (at least musically) as I was in my 20s, but that’s another post for a mental health blogger to sort out.\n\nAfter the rather acrimonious break up of Neil’s first big group, the fabulous Buffalo Springfield, Neil recorded his self-titled debut album. I’ve always dug that album, but other than “The Loner” it’s a very singer/songwriter kind of record, before singer/songwriters were a thing. I once spent a weekend listening strictly to “Last Trip To Tulsa,” but again, it was a troublesome time for me. Neil Young sounded very much like an extension of Neil’s work in the Springfield to my ears. After that debut, Neil started jamming with a band named The Rockets down at the Whisky-A-Go-Go. They already had a lead guitar player who apparently didn’t realize Neil had just stolen the bulk of his band, namely Danny Whitten (guitar/vocals), Billy Talbot (bass), and Ralph Molina (drums). The rest of the Rockets thought Neil was borrowing those guys and would return to produce the Rockets next album. What can I say, show business is treacherous. I think Neil re-naming the band Crazy Horse and writing a song, “Running Dry (Requiem For The Rockets)” might have been a signal but who am I to judge?\n\nThe band worked on Neil’s second album, the glorious Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, the title track of which I used to play loudly when I lived in Ft. Smith, Arkansas… because it really is nowhere. The album also contained Neil’s first big “hit,” “Cinnamon Girl.” And more importantly two of Neil’s great guitar workouts, the over 10-minute “Cowgirl In The Sand” and over 9-minute “Down By The River.” It seems in Danny Whitten, Neil had found a guitar foil worthy of the mantle set by Stephen Stills in the Springfield. The album, released in May of ’69 was a bit of a surprise hit. I don’t think anybody in rock n roll thought the shaky voiced guy playing lead guitar in the Springfield was going to be the breakout star.\n\nWhile they were recording Everyone Knows This Is Nowhere, as is his wont, Neil was recording a lot of other material… songs seemed to just flow out of the guy back then. And, admittedly Crazy Horse were also working on some songs of their own. And that is what leads me to the brilliance of this new Early Daze. Neil has gone back and culled 10 tracks from that wonderful year of 1969. Three of the tracks on the album ended up (in some version) on the Crazy Horse album from 1972. I know Crazy Horse was intent on doing a record, but I think it says a lot about Danny Whitten’s demons that the debut Crazy Horse LP didn’t come out until 3 years later… and by then Whitten had been sacked from the Horse and Nils Lofgren (guitar/vocals) had replaced him…and Jack Nitzsche (keyboards) had also joined the band.\n\nRegardless of all that, if Neil didn’t dedicate Early Daze to Danny Whitten in the liner notes – I don’t have my physical copy yet, I’m still struggling to decide how to move forward as a collector, vinyl vs CD, the cover art tells us all you need to know about this album. Whitten, not Neil, is in the center of the album cover. While he’s bathed in the spotlight, as Neil plays off to the side, it almost looks ethereal, like the late Whitten is appearing as a ghost amongst the other members of Crazy Horse. Danny died tragically, OD’ing on valium and booze a few days after being fired by Neil in ’72 before the tour that produced Time Fades Away.\n\nAccording to what I’ve read, only one of the songs on Early Daze has been released prior, “Dance Dance Dance,” which kicks off the album. The track was written by Neil but he gave it to Crazy Horse for their debut album. I’ve read that Neil wrote the song for a country-rock album they never got around to recording. There’s also a version of Whitten’s “Come On Baby Let’s Go Downtown,” that’s different than the version on Crazy Horse. Of course, the first time we’d heard this song was a live version, taken from Neil & Crazy Horse’s Live From The Fillmore East, that was on Tonight’s The Night. Hearing it now, I’ve come to realize it’s just a jaunty upbeat song about going downtown to buy heroin. There’s also a different version of “Look At All The Things,” another great Crazy Horse track.\n\nI love that Neil places Crazy Horse songs along side his own. It gives us a glimpse into the creative process that was going down in 1969. They were working on tracks for both Neil and Crazy Horse. Neil toured in ’87-’88 with Crazy Horse billing themselves as “Third Greatest Garage Band In The World.” Listening to these recordings from 1969, I’d say they could have dropped the “Third” and were perhaps the Greatest Garage Band In The World at the time. Neil himself has always said, “I just play better guitar with Crazy Horse.” Between the Crazy Horse songs and Neil’s songs, this 10 song set just holds together extraordinarily well. The band was certainly gelling. I love how rough and ragged this music sounds but then I’d expect no less from Crazy Horse. This would have made a great album back in ’69 in and of itself.\n\nAs usual with Neil some of these songs surfaced around 1969 but several stayed in the vault for years. Only “Cinnamon Girl,” here in a mono mix and “Down By The River” in an alternate mix with alternate vocals appear from what became Everyone Knows This Is Nowhere. There’s also an early version of “Winterlong,” a version of which wasn’t heard until Neil’s greatest hits 3-album package Decade. “Wonderin'” is a track that didn’t see the light of day until the early 80s and in a very different rockabilly version on Everybody’s Rockin. Needless to say, I like this version better. “Everybody’s Alone” is a great little rock n roll song that has only previously been released, in a different mix, on Archives I. It’s nice to hear these songs in an album configuration.\n\nThe songs that really, really grab me, are this Crazy Horse version of “Helpless,” a track Neil used on the CSNY album Deja Vu. I love this take on the song although admittedly the CSNY version remains definitive. This version maintains the acoustic nature but then Crazy Horse kicks in and makes it more muscular. When it comes to certain songs, Neil is like that wine maker when I was a kid… to paraphrase (cue Orson Welles), “Neil will release no song, before it’s time.” The other song that struck me was a version of “Birds” (a mono version of this track was released as a B-side), a song that ended up on After The Gold Rush. Neil tried this song alone (acoustic), with CSNY (a delightful version with Graham Nash singing harmony), and now we have a version with Crazy Horse. I like every version of this song… including Linda Ronstadt’s wonderful cover.\n\nEarly Daze capture an incendiary artist who had teamed with the perfect backing band at the perfect time. It’s a great, raw, rocking “album that never was,” but even though the songs were from disparate recording sessions over that year, they all hang together very well. I didn’t expect to get into this album as deeply as I have, but it’s currently in high rotation here at B&V. I know it’ll certainly be blaring in my ear pods whilst I baste in the sun this weekend. Alas for Crazy Horse, rather than sticking with them, Neil had jumped rather casually into Crosby, Stills & Nash to create one of the earliest super groups. That didn’t last very long and soon we got Neil solo again with After The Gold Rush where we also meet Nils Lofgren… on piano no less. Luckily for we fans of rock n roll from the rougher edge of the spectrum, Neil has continued to record with Crazy Horse off and on over the decades including three great albums recently (Colorado, Barn, and New World Record).\n\nCheck out Early Daze at top volume and drift back to 1969…I was an infant so maybe I should be careful doing so…but I digress. Stay safe out there this 4th of July weekend… we want all 10 fingers on Monday. Enjoy this holiday weekend, it may be our final free Independence Day in the U.S. Cheers!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nDespite having a hectic week this week, I found my mind wandering to, what else, rock n roll. For reasons only clear to a neurologist, which I don’t have, I started thinking about all the great double studio albums put out over the years. I’ve done a post on what I think the best old school, double albums are, years ago. I read recently that the first rock n roll double album was Bob Dylan’s Blonde On Blonde, followed only a week later by The Mother’s of Invention’s Freak Out!. Dylan and Zappa are pretty important artists which likely explains why so many other great artists followed their example and put out great double albums over the years.\n\nNow, it’s probably important that I define the whole double album thing. I am not talking about live albums. For the most part, the great live albums over the years were double albums. I’m not counting Live And Dangerous or any other album recorded live, even if they may have been heavily overdubbed in the studio (talking to you Kiss). I’m also not counting what I call “Hybrid Albums” – part live, part studio. I’ve already posted on the best “Hybrid Albums,” again, years ago. When I’m talking about a Hybrid double album I’m thinking of, for example, U2’s Rattle And Hum or the Allman Brothers’ Eat A Peach. Those are great albums and have great studio tunes on them, but they also have quite a bit of live stuff as well. When I say double album, I’m talking about LPs like the one’s I mentioned above by Dylan and Zappa, old school, albums recorded in the studio that cover two vinyl discs. Two “Long Players” in one album sleeve if you will. And, as a bonus, those double albums usually had a gatefold album cover where my friends could clean their pot.\n\nThe CD era only confused the whole concept of the double album. Vinyl albums could contain roughly 40 to 45 minutes of music. That’s why cassette tapes were mainly 45 minutes per side, for all of you mix tape folks out there that remember… Anyway, CDs could hold up to, I believe 80 minutes of music. In the 90s when CDs became the predominant format for music, albums just got longer and longer. The 8-song album sort of faded away…which coincidentally led to artists releasing “bonus tracks” on re-releases of older, pre-CD albums. When vinyl made a comeback many of those albums put out on CD were too long for a single vinyl album so they’ve been put out as double albums. For example, I still consider Blood Sugar Sex Magik a single record even though on vinyl it’s a double album. On the other hand I did include a few albums from the CD era on my list of great double albums because they were double CDs: Stadium Arcadium or Use Your Illusions just seemed to belong on the list.\n\nAdmittedly, there is nothing more divisive than the double album. There’s an old canard amongst critics that hiding within every double album is a great single album. I will say, when it comes to the Clash’s triple album Sandanista!, they might be right. Record companies used to hate it when artists turned in a double album. They were too expensive, fans didn’t buy as many because of the high price tag etc. Fans sometime complained that some double albums contained too much “filler.” On the other hand, like pizza, when a double album is done right it can be sublime.\n\nI always used to think that in order to be truly defined as one of the “greats” you had to have either a great live album or a great double album. I’m not as religious about that any more. However, so many of the “great” (and important) rock n roll artists have put out stunning double albums: The Beatles, Stones, Stevie Wonder, Dylan, Zappa, Marvin Gaye, just to name a few. Prince, Elton John, and The Who all released two double albums…although admittedly Elton’s Blue Moves is an acquired taste.\n\nAs my mind wandered to the subject of double albums this week, I realized there are some really great artists – yes, truly “great” ones – that didn’t put out a double album and the more I thought about it, I was frankly kind of surprised. There are some artists whose ethos probably tended to keep them from the epic double album. Iggy Pop was punk, and that genre didn’t lend itself to grandiose statements…unless you were the Clash who dubbed themselves “the only band who matters.” Aerosmith’s music was short blasts of bluesy hard rock. Again, not a double album staple, although Zeppelin’s Physical Graffiti might argue against me here. I also took into account an artists’ demons when I was thinking about this. Both Zevon and Nilsson had addictions that likely prevented them from focusing long enough to get a double album together.\n\nEventually, after a lot of mulling, I came up with a list of artists whose lack of a double album is surprising if not perplexing. As I scan the list I realize that in many cases these are singer/songwriter types. I guess I sort of think of them as being more prolific. There are also bands on this list that had more than one writer in the band. I feel like those guys are naturals for the double album that somehow never got made. Without further adieu, here is my list:\n\nDavid Bowie – How did Bowie not get a double LP together. Admittedly there was a period of heavy cocaine abuse, but the 70s were such a fertile period for him. I could have seen Diamond Dogs having been stretched out to a double album, but maybe he didn’t have the material? During his Berlin period he did give quite a few songs co-written with Iggy Pop to Iggy. What could have been…\n\nNeil Young – Speaking of prolific. How did Neil never deliver a double LP. In the Archives II box there’s a disc entitled Dume. It’s basically what Zuma would have been had it been a double album. I have to admit, it’s sensational. It’s the disc in that box set I go back to most. Neil has released it stand alone as part of his Archives series and it’s worth a spin!\n\nStevie Nicks – In Fleetwood Mac, they had three songwriters (Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, and Christine McVie) which led Nicks to have a massive surplus of songs. I’m surprised she didn’t do a George Harrison, once freed from the confines of the band, and go double album.\n\nTom Petty – Ok, I know I’m cheating here. Wildflowers was originally intended to be a double album but the record company insisted Tom edit it down to a single album. It’s a classic either way, but I wish that great left over stuff had been released in the 90s.\n\nBob Seger – I saw Seger interviewed by like, Matt Lauer or some morning guy, and he was talking about a new album (I forget which), and Bob said, “Oh, we’ve always got way too many songs. On this record we had 80 songs to choose from.” Now, who knows if he was exaggerating but that sounds like double album territory to me. His longtime manager Punch probably veto’d it… much like re-releasing a lot of Seger’s early music.\n\nBob Marley – I think Bob recorded both Exodus and Kaya at the same time so we know he was prolific enough to put out a double album. He also had a back catalog of pre-Catch A Fire songs he could have filled out a double album with…\n\nPaul McCartney – The man is a workaholic, how did he not put out a double album in the 70s? Especially the back half of the decade? Harrison put out a triple album, the fact that Paul didn’t ever have an inkling for a double album is perplexing.\n\nCSNY – With four singer/songwriters these guys seem like a band who could easily have filled two discs. Of course Young only provided 2 or 3 songs to CSNY in their heyday. He was one toe in, always holding stuff back for his solo career. Maybe the other guys did a little of that too. Listening to the deluxe version of Deja Vu, that one would have been a helluva double album.\n\nQueen – A band as epically flamboyant as Queen, also with four guys who contributed tunes, should have gone big for the double LP.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival – John Fogerty wrote so many great songs for CCR. Every few months another great album came out. I’d have liked to see these guys push themselves for a double disc. Maybe the constant touring got in the way.\n\nElvis Costello – One of the greatest songwriters ever. He had such a purple patch in the late 70s/early 80s… I’m no expert on Costello, maybe he put out a late period double album, but I don’t think so. Could have been something epic.\n\nJackson Browne – He was already an established songwriter before his first album came out. Many of the songs he’d written for others like “Take It Easy,” and “These Days” he recorded himself for his second album. Maybe if he’d pushed himself he could have turned For Everyman into a double album.\n\nSteely Dan – These guys were such perfectionists in the studio, maybe that prevented them from driving on to the double album. But they were so great, it seems like they could have pulled it off. Imagine if Aja was a double disc?\n\nU2 – These guys have such huge egos, how did they not do a double album back in the day?\n\nRush – Speaking of epic, these guys have long songs divided up with Roman numerals. The “2112 Suite” spreads out over an entire album side. How did they not keep going for the double album?\n\nLou Reed – Lou had such an ability to tell stories, many from the seamy underbelly of life. He had such a flare for the dramatic, a double album seems like a fit for him. He did struggle with demons.\n\nPearl Jam – Hailed as “neo-classicists” rockers when they came along, it seems like a double album would have been right up their alley.\n\nBilly Joel – I know Billy quit songwriting for like 30 years until his recent single “Turn The Lights Back On” came out but he used to be quite prolific. And I always thought he was a great songwriter. If Springsteen could do a double album, why not Billy?\n\nGrateful Dead – This is another band with multiple guys contributing tunes. Robert Hunter was also contributing. With all that jamming, you’d think they’d have put out a double album. Maybe they did and I just don’t know it, I’m far from a Deadhead expert.\n\nJohn Mellencamp – Mellencamp, like Seger or Petty mentioned before, is a guy who, as his music became more topical and political strikes me as someone who could have pulled off the scope of a double album.\n\nThose are the artists who came to mind to me as great ones whose absence of a double album seems startling. If there’s an artist you think would have put out a great double album but didn’t – drop it in the comments. Maybe I’m a musical obsessive, but I considered this a fun exercise on my end, maybe you will too? I like to mull these things over with a tumbler of dark and murky fluids… maybe you will too?\n\nCheers!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThings are always busy down at the Neil Young Archives, but it feels like there’s a lot going on down there recently. Just a few weeks ago Neil released an extended version of 1990’s Ragged Glory, augmented with four new exceptional songs, entitled Ragged Glory – Smell The Horse. Last Friday he finally(!) released the long sought after, oft bootlegged 1977 “lost album” Chrome Dreams. This one is an album I’ve been hearing about for decades. And, if I’m being honest, I have a bootleg version of the album I acquired in a shady, back alley transaction ten years ago. This “official” release, after so many years comes with better, cleaned up sound and cool album art (pictured above) featuring a drawing from Ronnie Wood of the Stones. The artwork is signed by Wood and dated “Christmas ’76” which would be right after the Band’s Last Waltz concert where both Wood and Young appeared. And speaking of The Last Waltz, we just sadly lost lead guitarist/songwriter Robbie Robertson. That’s a lot going on and I didn’t even mention last year’s release of Toast with Crazy Horse…\n\nI mention Ronnie Wood’s artwork as it’s a lot different from what I had on my bootleg copy. Young has said the title, Chrome Dreams, came from a drawing by his producer David Briggs of a car that if you turned on it’s side became a “hot chick.” It was the 70s folks, that’s how people talked. I don’t know if the Briggs drawing is still in the vaults or Young just confused who’d drawn the picture. Regardless, the artwork I’ve associated with this album was always this:\n\nIn 1977, Young burned an acetate (from which you press an album) of Chrome Dreams and reportedly submitted it for release, but then pulled it back. Instead he released what’s considered a hodge-podge of an album, American Stars ‘n Bars. It was an album compiled of songs that Neil had recorded over the prior two to two and half years. However, if we were to look closely at Chrome Dreams, it was also a bit of a hodge-podge… if I’m being honest. However, if I’m comparing the two competing potential 1977 releases, I’d say American Stars ‘n Bars is a minor addition to Young’s catalog and Chrome Dreams would have ranked amongst his finest work. For me, this ranks amongst his recent “lost albums” like Homegrown or Hitchhiker as “must have” Neil Young. Back during the middle 70s Young had a standing, monthly reservation at a recording studio for the night of each full moon. He’d go in, stare at the production team for a while and then conjure up some genius from the muse. It sounds a little like Pagans dancing in a field at the witching hour, but hey, it worked.\n\nWith a list of his released albums and then these lost albums, perhaps a timeline might be helpful on this. As best as I can tell, here’s a history and where Chrome Dreams fits in:\n\n1972, Young releases Harvest, making him a superstar.\n\n1973, Young doesn’t like being a superstar and decides to veer into the “ditch.” He records a live follow up of all new songs, Time Fades Away, the beginning of his “Ditch Trilogy.”\n\n1973, Young records a follow up, the raw Tonight’s The Night but doesn’t release it. Although he does play a few shows and plays songs from the album compiled years later on Roxy:Tonight’s The Night Live.\n\n1974, After reuniting with CSN for a tour, and attempts to record a follow up to Deja Vu fails, he releases On The Beach.\n\n1975, Young records a very personal album about his failing relationship with Carrie Snodgrass, Homegrown. After hosting a listening party for friends where he played both Homegrown and Tonight’s The Night, Young opts to release Tonight’s The Night (recorded in ’73) instead of Homegrown which he deems “too personal.”\n\nFall of 1975, Young releases Zuma, recorded with Crazy Horse.\n\n1976, Young joins Stephen Stills band and records Long May You Run. Young bails on Stills midway through the tour with a telegram that reads, “Funny how things that start off spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach.”\n\nOn the night of a full moon in August of 1976, Young does an all night session that results in the stripped down, acoustic Hitchhiker. He turns it into the record company but they reject it as being a “collection of demos.”\n\n1977, Young puts together the acetate for Chrome Dreams but pulls it back from the record company.\n\n1977, Young releases American Stars ‘n Bars compiled from recording sessions spanning back as far as two and half years.\n\nThat’s a lot of music going on. I can only marvel at his pulling back three amazing records… well 2, the record company rejected one. I think we’d look at Young’s back half of the 70s completely differently if he’d released Homegrown and Chrome Dreams. Although that might have catapulted him back into the limelight he so despised. And if we look closely, the songs on Chrome Dreams – depending on the copy you own – run from 46 to 51 minutes… too long for a conventional 1 disc vinyl album.\n\nThe songs on Chrome Dreams, like Stars ‘n Bars, come from various sources and will be familiar to longtime fans as versions of these songs – if not these exact versions – have been released before. Three of the tracks here are the same takes that ended up on Stars ‘n Bars, “Will To Love” a 7 minute song about a salmon swimming upstream to spawn. “Homegrown,” which was originally recorded for the album of the same name and “Hold Back The Tears” are also here, identical to the Stars ‘n Bars versions.\n\n“Pocahontas,” which wouldn’t see release until Rust Never Sleeps is the version from Hitchhiker and doesn’t have any overdubs like the Rust version. I love this song. “Pocahontas, Marlon Brando and me…” just talking about the “Astrodome and the first teepee.” One of the real finds here is an acoustic version of “Powderfinger,” one of my all time favs of Neil’s. I’ll admit that the electric version that also ended up on Rust is definitive, but this stark, acoustic track is a great addition. This version also hails from Hitchhiker. “Star of Bethlehem,” recorded for the pulled Homegrown and eventually released on the 3-LP retrospective Decade is a great acoustic track with Emmylou Harris on harmony.\n\n“Like A Hurricane,” with it’s cascading sheets of electric guitar, originally recorded during the sessions for Zuma is here. I’ve always felt this song, although a brilliant epic track, felt out of place on Stars ‘n Bars, and that’s probably true for Chrome Dreams. It should have been on Zuma. Also here is a pre-punk influenced “Sedan Delivery” and it also dates from those Zuma sessions. It’s not as punchy as the Rust Never Sleeps version released a few years later. I might like this version better. It’s another reason to pick this album up. “Captain Kennedy” is a beautiful acoustic track that ended up on Hawks and Doves. “Look Out For My Love” is a menacing little acoustic love song that ended up on Comes A Time.\n\nFinally, two of the gems round out the line up. “Too Far Gone” which was included in a different version on Freedom is here. I kind of like this stripped down, acoustic guitar/mandolin version. Finally, the wonderful ballad “Stringman” which prior to this release was only available live or on Neil’s Archive Vol 2.\n\nI’ve looked at the vinyl version of Chrome Dreams and its close to $60… that’s a bit much for even a music fanatic like me. But if you’re not as obsessed with Neil and rock n roll as I am, you probably don’t own all the albums, bootlegs (ahem) and greatest hits compilations that I do. There’s a good chance you don’t own all of these songs already. The case could be made that after all these years, since the songs have all been released somewhere in some form, this might be superfluous. I disagree. Considering all of that, I still think this is definitely an album you’re going to want to pick up either on CD or download. It’s one of those lost albums that people have been raving about for 45 years… and they were right! It’s that classic Neil sound – forlorn acoustic tracks with a couple of rockers including the epic “Like A Hurricane.” There’s not a bad moment on this one. I just wish he’d released it all those years ago.\n\nThis is a must have Neil Young album for all fans, not just Neil fans! I own the bootleg and I bought it… I guess I am a touch obsessive. Enjoy this one, it’s a classic!\n\nCheers!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n“There’s a mansion on the hill, Psychedelic music fills the air…” – “Mansion On The Hill,” Neil Young & Crazy Horse\n\nNeil Young & Crazy Horse have released an expanded version of their 1990 album, Ragged Glory. The new version is expanded by four songs and has been rechristened, Ragged Glory – Smell The Horse. The new configuration unearths four tracks recorded during the sessions that produced Ragged Glory and include “Interstate,” “Don’t Spook The Horse,” “Boxcar” and an over 12 minute extended work out on “Born To Run” (not the Springsteen song). Neil being Neil, you can only get the Smell The Horse tracks by buying the album from his website in a package of 4 LPs, or you can download the MP3’s, which is what I did… I already own Ragged Glory…I just wanted the “bonus” tracks.\n\nIt was tough to be a Neil Young fan in the 80s, which was sadly the decade I discovered him. I spent most my time collecting his older records from the 70s: Everyone Knows This Is Nowhere (with the original line-up of Crazy Horse), After The Goldrush, Harvest, Tonight’s The Night and I actually bought his 3-LP career retrospective Decade. It was my roommate Drew who really deserves the credit for turning me onto Neil. But if you wanted to get into new, then-current Neil Young music, the 80s were pretty tough. After 1980’s Hawks And Doves it was pretty rough sledding. Which is surprising because Neil finished the 70s so strong – Rust Never Sleeps, strongly influenced by what the punks were doing, was such a landmark album.\n\nIn the 80s, even teaming with his on again/off again backing band Crazy Horse didn’t work. I owned 81’s Re*ac*tor for a little while but ended up selling it. Neil also did a rockabilly album and then – in an act of high treason for us rock n roll fans – he did a country album. David Geffen, the head of his record company actually sued him during this stretch for purposely making “non commercial” music that was “unrepresentative” of Young’s music. I was actually such a Neil Young fan I actually bought the grim and harsh sounding Landing On Water. It’s not a record that even I can recommend.\n\nFinally, in 1987 Young began to show signs of life. He re-teamed, for only the second time in the decade, with Crazy Horse (Frank Sampedro, guitar; Billy Talbot, bass; Ralph Molina, drums) for the album Life. I liked that record but I can’t say it was one of his best. It was the next album when I got right back on the bandwagon, 1988’s This Note’s For You, a bluesy rave up of an album complete with a horn section… although I realize that album may be one of those records only I like. This Note’s For You was Neil’s first album back on Reprise records, a Warner imprint, and away from Geffen which was probably good. There are theories that he recorded an eccentric blues album as a way to test the waters on exactly how much creative freedom he actually had on his new label. He actually wrote some killer songs for that album so that helped. It just felt at that point, to me… at the time sitting in exile in Arkansas, that Neil was poised for a comeback.\n\nAnd comeback he did! Neil ended up closing out the 80s in the same way he did the 70s, with an incredible album. 1989’s Freedom was an amazing rock n roll resurrection. “Rockin’ In The Free World” (which came in an electric and acoustic version like “My My, Hey Hey” on Rust) was a true rock n roll anthem that ranks up there with “Ohio” amongst Neil’s greatest songs. Freedom was one of the first albums I purchased on that at the time, new-fangled format, CD. At that point the only question for us Neil fans was – is this going to be a 1 album comeback or will he be able to sustain this thing? Will he continue to make great records again? We all had our hopes up.\n\nNeil reconvened Crazy Horse again and went up to his ranch and jammed. The resulting album Ragged Glory is one of his all time greatest with Crazy Horse, and that’s saying something. These guys rocked with a reckless abandon. The album opens with two of my favorites “Country Home” and “White Line.” “White Line” started off as an acoustic strummer in it’s original version, but Neil and Crazy Horse turn it up to 11. The song “Fuckin’ Up” has been covered by everyone from Pearl Jam on down. There’s so much joy in this music. I remember going to Chicago at the time to see my friends Doug and RK and Doug kept singing the lyrics to “Farmer John,” the only cover song here. Two of the tracks “Love To Burn” and “Love And Only Love” were over 10-minutes long! I don’t live in a mansion, I’ve never been in a mansion, but the chorus to “Mansion On The Hill,” quoted above, could describe the B&V lab… psychedelic music blaring at all hours.\n\nHere we are 33 years down the road and Neil has discovered four tracks from those sessions that didn’t make the original masterpiece album and has decided to share them with us. I was really looking forward to Ragged Glory II as it was known on the inter-web. I thought it might be a whole extra album worth of music. With those 1990 sessions producing such high caliber music, I knew that there had to be some good stuff on tape. Alas, it wasn’t a whole album of new stuff but it’s damn close at 40-minutes of new music. As I suspected, these are four great songs.\n\nThe first track is “Interstate.” It is simply put, one of Neil’s most beautiful acoustic songs. I get why it didn’t make the cut as it’s counter to the electric guitar forward tracks on the original album. I believe it might have been previously released as a b-side. If so, it needs to be added to my list of favorite b-sides. The acoustic playing on the song is mesmerizing. It’s a late night, whiskey track. It’s a haunting track about the life of a musician on the road. The lyric “I can hear a soft voice calling, Calling me to bring my guitar home…” gives me chills. As a traveling salesman… I know that feeling…well, not about the guitar, I don’t play any instruments.\n\nThe next track, “Don’t Spook The Horse,” was also purportedly released back in 1990 as another B-side. It’s a good ol’ down home rocker. Yes, the lyrics are bit… vulgar, but only in a minor way. It’s kind of a funny song. I had heard the original title of this expanded set was to have taken it’s name from this song but Neil felt “Don’t Smell The Horse” was more appropriate. “Don’t Spook The Horse” is an almost 8-minute tune that would have fit perfectly on the original album. If you like Ragged Glory you’ll like this track.\n\n“Boxcar” is a track that was released on 2007’s Chrome Dreams II in a completely different arrangement. That version was a country song complete with a banjo. This version has a plaintive, almost spooky, under water-like guitar sound. It’s only slightly over 3 minutes long but it leaves a mark. It sounds like a train. The final track, “Born To Run,” not to be confused with the famous Springsteen track of the same name, is a Neil original that dates back – if I’m not wrong – to the Zuma sessions. There’s a version on his Archives Volume 2 but it’s much more “compact.” This version is an all out jam of over 12 minutes. It’s great to hear the Horse slip the chain, so to speak, and rock for a quarter of an hour. It’s another track that would have fit perfectly on the original album. If you like guitar, you’ll like this song.\n\nYou never know what bonus tracks, or tracks left over from an album’s sessions are going to bring. Often times with an artist the caliber of a Neil Young, or Bob Dylan, or heck, Stevie Nicks (whose career we just looked at) these “leftover” songs are better than some artist’s regular output. These four songs not only do not tarnish the original album they actually expand on it’s brilliance. If you’re a Neil Young fan, I urge you to seek these tracks out post haste! They don’t make ’em like this anymore…\n\nTurn this one up to 11. Cheers!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n“When I was a hitchhiker on the road, I had to count on you…” – Neil Young, “Hitchiker”\n\nNo one loves releases from an artist’s archives more than we here at BourbonAndVinyl. There are certain artists that have a treasure trove of unreleased material, recorded over the course of their career. Dylan, Springsteen and Neil Young are probably the foremost artists that spring to mind in this category. It almost sounds like the Rock N’ Roll Archive Law Firm of Dylan, Young and Springsteen… Dylan started the whole archive craze with his Bootleg Series. Actually to be completely correct, he probably started it all prior to that with his brilliant box set, ‘Biograph,’ which combined hits, album cuts, live cuts and unreleased material to tell the story of his career. ‘Biograph’ seemingly launched the box set business and showed record companies there is a strong market for these “vault” releases. I published a guide to Dylan’s Bootleg Series previously, ( Dylan’s Bootleg Series – A User’s Guide ).\n\nSpringsteen has released the box set, ‘Tracks,’ to clear out a small fraction of his unreleased studio stuff. Bruce also continues to release quality-sound live concert recordings ranging from ’74 to ’16 and just released the first ever soundboard from his 1977 tour… Don’t tell my wife, but that review will be coming soon. You could go bankrupt buying those old Springsteen concerts and she doesn’t need to know how much I’m spending… Speaking of concert recordings, The Grateful Dead, who have a long, storied bootleg history, have been releasing live concerts “from the vaults” even longer than Springsteen has, and deserve at least a mention here. However, I just can’t get into the Dead… that endless noodling drives me nuts, but if you’re into them, we don’t judge here at B&V. In my opinion, if you want jam band stuff, try Gov’t Mule or The Allman Brothers.\n\nNeil Young got into the “vault” releases in a big, big way with his box set, ‘Archives Vol. 1,(1963-1972)’ released in 2009 which grew out of what was to be ‘Decade 2’ the follow up to the spectacular 1977 greatest hits package ‘Decade.’ As with anything Neil Young, he went way overboard and ‘Archives 1’ ended up being eight discs long, with interactive Blu-Ray versions and fabulous sound quality. No wonder it took almost 30 years to complete. While there were unreleased versions of songs, ‘Archives 1’ relied heavily on previously released material from his albums of the period. I didn’t purchase it, because I already had most of those albums excerpted from that time period. There were a number of live, concert albums contained in the box, that were released separately as stand-alone LPs. I bought ‘Live At The Fillmore East’ which was with the original Crazy Horse (Danny Whitten!), although it was only the electric half of that concert. I also purchased, from ‘Archives Vol 1,’ the ‘Massey Hall’ show and ‘Sugar Mountain: Live At The Canterbury House 1968,’ which were all acoustic performances. Neil is that rare artist that has two sides – roaring, rocking, electric distortion (usually with Crazy Horse) and quiet, sometimes spacey, acoustic songs. Often he performs both at shows, in different sets.\n\nAfter ‘Archives Vol 1’ came out, we vault enthusiasts had to keep waiting as ‘Vol 2’ kept getting delayed. Now I’m hearing Neil is going to stream all of his material online… We’ll have to wait and see. While I’ve been waiting for ‘Vol 2’ to come out, I was happy to see a few years ago, Neil release ‘Live At the Bluenote Cafe’ from his ‘This Notes For You’ tour. That live album was reviewed on B&V and I still love listening to it, but I love the blues. ( Review: Neil Young, “Bluenote Cafe” (Live) ). One of the things that had me most looking forward to ‘Vol 2’ was the rumor that it would include a number of Neil’s “lost” albums. Neil is one of those rare artists who would go into the studio, cut a whole album worth of material and then pull it back and put it on the shelf. Prince was notorious for this as well.\n\nThere are several of these “lost” albums that I’ve heard of, and probably lots more in existence. ‘Chrome Dreams’ is one of the few studio bootlegs I have of Neil. There is purportedly an album from the late 90s/early 00s that Neil cut with Crazy Horse in San Francisco, in a studio famously used by John Coltrane, named ‘Toast.’ Another one I’ve heard of, but not a whole lot, was the all acoustic LP Neil shelved in 1976, ‘Hitchhiker.’ I was shocked the other day, when I saw it pop up on iTunes. Rather than wait until September 8th, the release date, I immediately ordered the single song available, the title track.\n\nThe ‘Hitchhiker’ LP was recorded in one long night, August 11, 1976, with just Neil Young on acoustic guitar and David Briggs, his friend/producer in a Malibu studio. Neil only took breaks as he labored all night for “beer, weed or cocaine.” Sounds like hazardous working conditions. Many of the songs on the track list are songs that have popped up on other albums (‘Rust Never Sleeps,’ ‘Comes A Time’) over the years. Some of these tunes were even on ‘Chrome Dreams’ which makes me wonder if that was merely a compilation of earlier tracks like say, ‘Freedom’ vs a newly cut album that didn’t get released.\n\nI’ve listened to the title track “Hitchhiker” from this album almost non stop since yesterday. When I heard this was just Neil playing acoustic guitar, I thought the song would come off sounding like a demo. I was wrong, this is a fully realized song. It would be at home on side one of ‘Rust Never Sleeps’ or either side of ‘Comes A Time.’ It’s a hypnotic, tone poem of a song. There are so many levels to the autobiographical lyrics. On the surface it’s the story of Neil hitchhiking from Toronto to Los Angeles. However, I think it could be also read as his journey from obscurity to superstardom. He also, very honestly, chronicles his journey from hash to amphetamines to weed. He even gets valium, but he “still couldn’t close my eyes.” Sound-wise this song reminds me of “The Needle And the Damage Done.” I know he later released this song on the Daniel Lanois produced ‘Le Noise’ but this is the definitive version of this song.\n\nIf you’re a fan of Neil’s acoustic side, this is a must have. I can only hope this will bring more vault releases of Neil’s “lost studio albums” in the future. I’ll definitely have more about this when the album comes out, but for now, turn this on and ride the highway with Neil…\n\nCheers!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n“Fourteen junkies, too weak to work…” – Neil Young, “Time Fades Away”\n\nThere are certain albums that for various reasons have taken on a certain “mystique” over the years. In most cases it’s albums that don’t get released. Prince had “The Black Album,” an album that was supposedly so perverse it couldn’t be released… we have to save the children from such sex talk in music (cue the PMRC). Years after the rumor of the album, Prince finally released it and it was, to be generous, meh. Ryan Adams’ record company rejected “Love Is Hell” because they thought it was a downer so he released “Rock N Roll” instead. The fact that his record company rejected “Love Is Hell” brought so much interest in this supposedly “dark” album, that the record company finally released it. It’s an ok Ryan Adams LP… I mean, dark is kind of his thing. You’ll never find Ryan Adams being played at a party here at the B&V house, that’s for sure. One could describe Ryan’s music as, “Music to Overdose to.”\n\nUsually albums only carry this kind of heavy mystique if someone dies during or shortly after the albums release. “Blackstar” by David Bowie and “You Want It Darker” by Leonard Cohen will always carry a little more weight because they can be read as an artistic farewell to the world and to their fans. Jimi Hendrix’ last recordings are always heralded as people wonder, what might have been. People point to Stevie Ray Vaughn’s final song on his final album, “Riviera Paradise” as a signal that he was headed into an all new creative direction that would have changed music and guitar as we know it… had he not passed away in that tragic helicopter crash. It’s like a painter whose paintings become more valuable after they’ve died. I’m surprised more rock stars don’t fake their death more often but that makes me sound like an agent hustling for coins.\n\nOf all the artists around, other than maybe Bob Dylan, Neil Young has more than his share of “mysterious,” unreleased albums. “Chrome Dreams” is an oft bootlegged, amazing record that Neil chose not to release in 1977. It would have been as big as “Harvest” in my opinion, which may be why Neil chose not to put it out. That “fame thing” never worked out too well for Neil. He said in the liner notes of “Decade” that “Harvest” found him in the middle of the road and very popular so he chose to steer into the ditch, “It was a rougher ride, but you meet more interesting people there” (I believe is the direct quote). He’s put out most of the songs on other albums, but taken as a whole “Chrome Dreams” would have stood with some of his best work.\n\nOf all of Neil Young’s unreleased and released albums, the one that always had the most intrigue for me, for some reason, was “Time Fades Away.” Part of the problem was you simply couldn’t find the record. I could never get my hands on it. After the initial release, Neil refused to release it on vinyl or any other format so copies of the album were really hard to find. Neil basically disavowed the record. My college roommate Drew was the only guy I know who could have been capable of even finding a copy such were his “completist” tendencies, but I don’t think even he had a copy. It was like you had to “know a guy” to even hear the thing, which I never did.\n\nThe backstory alone is enough to draw a rock and roll obsessive like me in… Neil Young, fresh from his twin triumphs of “After the Gold Rush,” and the even bigger success of “Harvest” was set to go on tour. It’s hard to overstate how popular Neil Young became after “Harvest.” I heard a story once, that Dylan heard “Heart of Gold” on the radio and thought it was one of his songs. When he realized it was Neil Young, he felt ripped off and wrote “Forever Young” as some sort of angry, “you ripped me off, you dick” kind of a song. Who knows if that’s true. Anyway, Neil gathered members of his “Harvest” band, the Stray Gators, and invited Danny Whitten from one of his other backing bands, Crazy Horse to New York to rehearse. Unfortunately Danny Whitten, a very talented guitarist and songwriter in his own right, was addicted to heroin. He’d already been kicked out of Crazy Horse, who were working on their own without Neil, because of his drug addictions. Whitten just couldn’t “hack it” at the rehearsals. He was taking a lot of Valium to help him kick the heroin habit and it was just destroying his timing. Finally Neil had to tell Danny he was fired and gave him $50 and a plane ticket back to Los Angeles. That very night, the night Neil Young fired Danny Whitten, Danny was found dead from mixing alcohol and $50 worth of Valium. Enter…. guilt and despair.\n\nSo after releasing his biggest album, with thousands of adoring fans waiting to hear the soft rock troubadour of “Harvest” come out and sing “Heart of Gold,” Neil plugs in his electric guitar and attempted to conquer his demons. Oh, and he brought along the 8-track mobile recording machine to document the whole thing. At the time, one of his band members turned him onto tequila. Ah, tequila. As I used to say in my younger days, the authorities knew which drug to legalize. When I drink tequila, which I rarely do, if I drink too much of it, I’m either going to fight you or fuck you, and quite possibly, both at the same time. Add tequila to a depressed, fragile mental state like Neil Young was in and God knows what can happen. Apparently the fans were not impressed. Part of the problem with concert audiences is that it’s hard to play new, unheard music for a crowd. They want to hear the hits, songs they’re familiar with. This was especially true in 1973 when the crowds were not that sophisticated.\n\nAt long last, I discovered this “lost” live album on iTunes. I had always heard that the music on this album was all loud, screaming guitar. It was going to be all noise like “Hey, Hey, My, My (Into the Black).” That is not exactly the case. The band did not get along well and Neil’s vocals were so fried he brought in Crosby and Nash to help sing harmonies, although, this wasn’t an album big on harmony. I will say, this is a very, very good Neil Young album, although I prefer the even darker music found on “Tonight’s the Night.” One might see this as a companion piece to “Tonight’s the Night” and “On The Beach” which are some of Neil’s darker works.\n\nThe album starts off with the raucous title track, which is one of the best here but I’ve always liked my Neil Young a little ragged. “Yonder Stands the Sinner” is another ragged rocker that jumps out at me and it’s followed by the great song “L.A.” (“city in the smog…”). But interspersed with those rockers are a couple of delicate, beautiful piano ballads, “Journey Through The Past” and “Love In Mind.” I never expected this kind of balladry from a guy on tequila. The crowd claps politely at the end of “Love In Mind” but you kind of feel they’re not thrilled.\n\nThe centerpiece of the album for me, is the beginning of what would be side 2 for you vinyl enthusiasts, “Don’t Be Denied.” It’s a a better autobiography than Neil’s book “Shakey.”It’s a long, mid tempo song about Neil’s love of and dedication to music. It tells his life story from being a bullied kid at school, to forming a band. It’s one of his best songs and coincidentally was recently covered beautifully by Norah Jones. It’s really the only hopeful bit of light in an otherwise dark album.\n\nAfter the ballad, “The Bridge,” another lovely piano and harmonica song, Neil and the band launch into the epic, eight-minute “Last Dance.” I really like the ragged guitar riff in this song. Although, it’s so bleak that it wouldn’t have been out of place on “Tonight’s the Night.” At the end of the song, Neil just howls, “no, no, no…” When Neil sings, “Wake up, it’s time to go to work,” it’s with an utter lack of enthusiasm.\n\n“Time Fades Away” is a portrait of an artist who is really suffering. And by sharing that pain with us through his art, he let’s we who are also suffering know we are not alone. That’s the power of an album like this. And powerful is the word I would use to describe this record. For anybody out there who likes to explore the musical backwaters of an artist’s catalog, like I do, this is must have music. Although, I wouldn’t recommend putting this on at Christmas… not a lot of Yule time joy here….\n\nIt’s a dark ride, folks. Stick together and take care of each other. Cheers!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n*Photo shamelessly borrowed from the Internet, gettyimages, Paul Bergen\n\nI just love this photograph of Pearl Jam from their early days. The only guy who looks happy is the drummer, in the middle, and they fired him. Likely on the HR form it read something like: Reason for Dismissal: Cheerfulness or Enjoying the Fame.\n\nMy corporate overlords are asking me to travel quite a bit more and I haven’t been able to write as often as I’d like, my apologies. It has given me a lot more time to think about music… and lately I’ve been thinking about fame. Ah, Fame, it’s such a cruel, fickle beast. Bands often form, write music, tour and work hard to achieve financial stability and yes, fame. But once it happens many bands/artists don’t know how to deal with it. There are certain levels of fame that nobody is ready for. Not everybody can be the Beatles, who not only embraced their fame, seemed energized by it. Well, McCartney anyway, Lennon seemed somewhat unnerved by it all.\n\nFame has all kinds of effects on an artist and not always good ones. Many artists, feeling the pressure to repeat earlier heights of record sales crumble under the pressure. Many artists turn to drugs, alcohol or just plain break up the band. Or sometimes the effects of fame are even worse…bad juju indeed. There are as many reactions to fame as there are artists, I suppose.\n\nLately, I find myself thinking about those artists/bands who decided to take control, take the bull by the horns as they say, and purposely change the trajectory of their artistic arc. The artists who, commercially speaking, tried to take a dive. The goal seemed to be to thin the herd of rabid fans, hanging on every word. These acts literally altered their art (in my opinion) to reduce their fame…\n\nBob Dylan: After a two year period that saw Dylan “go electric” and record three classic masterpieces: “Bringing It All Back Home,” “Highway 61 Revisted,” and “Blonde On Blonde” Dylan retreated to upstate New York to Woodstock (pre-festival fame Woodstock). This creative burst is beautifully documented on the box set, “The Cutting Edge” reviewed earlier in B&V. Dylan just wanted to get away, rest and spend some time with his wife and new family. Then, he had a motorcycle accident. Or did he? I’m not usually a “second shooter on the grassy knoll” guy, but I wonder if Dylan faked the whole thing to get a break in his crazy schedule. The guy was being touted as the “voice” of his generation. He was the appointed leader of the Hippy movement… heavy responsibility for a guy who is really just a singer… or a poet, depending on your outlook. After secluding himself in upstate NY and hanging out in a basement for a year with the Band, recording some pretty amazing music, but not really sharing it, Dylan emerged with a quiet, acoustic based “John Wesley Harding.” While considered a classic by critics, it was quite a dramatic departure from his three prior albums. It’s like Dylan rewrote the book on a career in music. He went on to record a country album, “Nashville Skyline.” He really didn’t recover commercially until “Blood On the Tracks” by which time his rabid audience had diminished and mellowed out.\n\nNeil Young: Neil Young’s trajectory was similar to Dylan’s, perhaps without the messianic overtones… the 70’s were a more cynical decade after all. Young released “Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere,” and then “After the Gold Rush” and joined CSNY. He was poised to explode. I don’t think he realized how big he was going to get when he delivered the mellow, extremely popular “Harvest.” You couldn’t get away from “Heart of Gold.” Neil said, on the liner notes of the excellent greatest hits package “Decade,” that he found himself in the middle of the road after “Harvest” and decided to steer his career into the ditch…he said he’d meet more interesting people there. He dismantled his following by delivering the live LP, “Time Fades Away,” which oddly seemed to declare war on his fans. Young was exorcising demons, but his fans were left to exorcise Neil.\n\nBruce Springsteen: Springsteen’s career has been a study in the art of controlling your fame. He released “Born To Run” and ended up on the cover of Time and Newsweek… after a 4 year absence due to legal issues with his management, he delivered the grim classic “Darkness On the Edge of Town.” Punk was prevalent and so he probably rode that wave, plus he was pissed about the court stuff and the four year absence. Finally, in 1979 he released “The River” which gave him his biggest seller to date… rather than capitalize on that success he retrenched with “Nebraska” an album I still struggle to listen to without being put on suicide watch. He finally reached his peak potential when he released “Born In the USA” but quickly retrenched to “Tunnel of Love.” Release something that makes you huge, follow up with a quiet personal album to make the crowds go away…it’s the best of both worlds.\n\nFleetwood Mac: Nobody saw the huge success of “Rumors” coming. Lindsey Buckingham, fueled by the punk movement took control of their next album and drove the band in experimental, weird directions. Stevie Nicks and Christine McVie apparently didn’t get the memo and continued to record solid mid tempo rock songs causing a very disjointed approach.”Tusk” is a masterpiece in my mind but it was heralded as a huge disappointment upon it’s release. I see it for what it was – Buckingham responding to the pressure of repeating “Rumors” by taking the band in a less commercial, artsy direction. When the LP doesn’t sell as much as the last one, you just say the audience didn’t “understand your creative vision.” It’s a great strategy really. Although Mick Fleetwood did drive out to Lindsey’s house after the reviews were in to say, “you blew it, mate.”\n\nPrince: “1999” was such a breakthrough record for Prince. He, along with Michael Jackson, were one of the first black artists to breakthrough to a broad white audience. He followed up with the movie/LP “Purple Rain.” Prince, a control freak, whose goal had always been world domination, and who actually accomplished it, responded with the quirky, artsy “Around the World In a Day,” an album I bought the day it was released and sold a week later. Yeah, I was one of the fans Prince exiled from his fan base with that record. Prince never really regained his commercial/artistic mojo. That’s the risk when you purposely try to kill off your fame… sometimes you’re successful.\n\nNirvana: Kurt Cobain, almost 30 years after Dylan, was also tagged with that “voice of his generation” tag. Based on Dylan’s response to that in the 60s and what happened to Kurt, you might want to avoid that tag. After “Nevermind” seemingly destroyed everything that came before it and revolutionized music in a way that punk only dreamed of, Cobain felt painted into a corner. He had wanted to only be as big as say, Sonic Youth, not bigger than the Beatles. In response to the world-wide worship, Cobain and Nirvana delivered the abrasive album “In Utero” an album that was such an obvious attempt to drive fans away and yet it was still wildly popular. “Heart Shaped Box” is still my favorite Nirvana tune. Sadly Kurt never reconciled his fame and for a myriad of reasons ended up sadly ending his own life… the most tragic tale I’m gonna tell.\n\nPearl Jam: I read an interview with Eddie Vedder once, and he said they were playing a bar that had a free hamburgers in the parking lot while they were set to play. He got on stage in front of an empty room (everyone was eating outside), closed his eyes and when he opened them, the entire bar was full of enthusiastic fans. He went on to say that was how Pearl Jam’s world wide fame happened, seemingly in the blink of an eye. “Ten” was such a huge album and it’s follow up “Vs” despite the “us vs you” implied by the title, was just as popular. Finally PJ put out “Vitalogy” which I consider a classic but like “In Utero” it was a clear attempt to “thin the herd.” You only have to take one look at the picture above and you can tell these guys were uncomfortable with the fame that had resulted from their music. Eddie took these guys down a path that saw them stay a solid live draw, but their music has never sold like it did early in their career and I think that’s how Eddie wants it… Vedder’s only proper solo album was a ukele album…clearly not a guy looking for wide commercial success or additional attention…\n\nThat’s it for now folks. Did I miss anybody on this list? Please add your thoughts in the comments if you’re so inclined.\n\nHave a great weekend!

There were those of us who liked Neil and those who were as equally repelled by him. Generally the supporters of Neil Young were known as “males” while the haters on Neil were known as “females.” I don’t think I ever dated a single woman who said, “Hey, I know, put on some Neil Young.”\n\nNeil’s music tends to get lumped into two categories and indeed there are two different styles he seems to return to more often than not. There is the acoustic side of Neil, the laid-back balladeer of “Harvest” and “After the Gold Rush”. Then we have the feedback-drenched, squalling guitar of Electric Neil most notably present when his once and future backing band Crazy Horse is playing with him.\n\nNeil has never really seemed to care what critics or even fans seem to think about him or his music. In his superb 3 LP greatest hits compilation, “Decade” Neil wrote that after the huge success of “Heart of Gold” and the album “Harvest” put him in the middle of the road as a pop star, he decided he’d veer off into the “ditch” where it was a little more interesting. Critics were quick to seize on this and labeled the three albums he recorded after “Harvest” as “The Ditch Trilogy”. Those three albums, all recorded at a time of great personal upheaval in Neil Young’s life, “Time Fades Away”, “On the Beach”, and “Tonight’s the Night” are brilliant but could be somewhat confounding to the “Heart of Gold” casual listener.\n\nAll these years later Neil’s career can still be seen as confusing. His career has seen him take more left turns, blind alleys, dead ends, and attempted genre experiments than most other artists can even imagine. One thing is for certain, his career has never been linear. It’s more of a a hedge-maze. You can really get lost in there. It’s just fun to type the words “hedge-maze”.\n\nThe 80’s were a particularly difficult time for Neil Young fans. After the disappointing Crazy Horse record “Re-act-or” Neil veered left with a techno experimental album entitled “Trans”. Not even I can defend “Trans”. Then he veered in an entirely different direction with a rockabilly album “Everybody’s Rocking” with a backing band named, appropriately, “The Shocking Pinks”. Then he went full on country with “Old Ways”. I’m not sure but I think it was around that time that Neil’s record company, Geffen, sued him for “purposely making uncommercial music”. After the country record, Neil put out a couple of albums largely seen as clunkers, “Landing On Water” and “Life” which saw him reuniting with Crazy Horse. I bought both those albums but you have to be a real fan to like those records. They bear the bad production values of the times – too loud drumming, echo-y vocals. Sadly, I saw Neil and Crazy Horse on the tour in support of “Life” but I had a tad too much beer. All I can remember is throwing up and making out with some dude’s girlfriend in front of me. Que sera sera.\n\nWith a decade like that behind him it probably shouldn’t have been a surprise when Neil hired a 6-piece horn section, backed with Crazy Horse (Ralph Molina on drums, Billy Talbot on bass, and Frank “Poncho” Sampedro on keyboards instead of his usual guitar) as his rhythm section and dubbed them “The Bluenotes”. I’ll say this about Neil, when he goes into a musical genre, he really commits. He wore a funny hat, a long coat and shades whenever he played with the Bluenotes. It was like he was in character. But man did they play the blues. The album they put out, “This Notes For You” actually garnered Neil’s highest critical praise he’d seen in quite some time. According to AllMusic, the critic’s warm response to the Bluenotes was because “all critics tend to stand in awe of the blues in whatever form it appears.” Well, if that’s true, and I’m no critic, I’m just a music fanatic, count me in. I love the way Neil played the blues on that album. Neil is such a superb and expressive guitar player, the blues fit him perfectly. Let’s face it, the blues is where they invented the guitar solo.\n\nWhich leads to the latest in Neil Young’s Archive Series, “The Bluenote Cafe”. Neil has put out a bunch of great archival concert recordings. I highly recommend “Live at the Fillmore East” a Crazy Horse show back when Danny Whitten was still alive. For the fans of his acoustic material there are 2 excellent concerts – “Live at Massey Hall” after he’d become a superstar and “Sugar Mountain: Live at Canterbury House ’68” when he was still up and coming. Both are superb live albums culled from single shows. “The Bluenote Cafe” is a live album culled from a number of different shows, but it hangs together like a single concert.\n\nI love this album. While the horn section is very prominent – the guitar is the star. Neil’s beautiful, black Gibson Les Paul is the true centerpiece here. Neil has always been known for extended guitar workouts like “Cortez the Killer” or “Down By the River”, and the blues is the perfect medium for him. I love the interplay between the guitar and the horns. Neil’s no stranger to writing sad songs, and his vocals are fabulous on the down-tempo, dirty blues tunes like “One Thing” and “Twilight”. The guitar work on “Twilight” truly makes it feel like the sun is going down and the world is turning gray…”the suns goin’ down on the long road home”… God I love that song.\n\nThere is a bunch of material on this live album that was written for “This Notes for You” but didn’t appear on that record. In some ways it’s like “Band of Gypsies” by Hendrix in that it’s a live album of almost exclusively new material. “Ordinary People” is an epic 13-minute jam that didn’t see proper release until “Chrome Dreams 2” in the 200o’s. I particularly liked “Bad News Comes to Town” and “Don’t Take Your Love Away From Me”. The songs “Doghouse” and “Sunny Inside” veer into Otis Redding territory and I mean that in a good way. There is a very muscular, early version of “Crime In the City” that just “rawks”, the horn section must be taking a cigarette break during that one.\n\nThe albums ending song is an epic 19-minute version of “Tonight’s the Night” one of the few back catalog tunes included in this live set. As best I can tell Neil chose that one because he must have thought, “what the fuck, I’m Neil Young”. I think one of the things I like about this odd, bluesy, backwater period of his career was that he’d basically bottomed out. He’d burned his commercial bridges with his record company and his fans. Yet, he didn’t despair, he put out a passionate, compelling blues album. He sounds totally committed and engaged on these performances. He soon abandoned the Bluenotes and put out one of his all time great albums, “Freedom” with the anthem “Rockin’ In the Free World”. I’m not sure that would have happened without the Bluenotes. This is definitely a period in Neil’s career that deserves more investigation.\n\nTurn it up loud…\n\nCheers!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
