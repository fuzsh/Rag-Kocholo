In a statement, the company's founder, Merck Mercuriadis, said that Hipgnosis Song Fund and Neil Young share the same \"integrity, ethics and passion, based on a trust in music\", and that they will work together \"so that everyone hears [the songs] and in Neil's terms\". Neil Young, 75, has more than 70 albums published, solo and in band, notably with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and is the author of songs such as \"Heart of Gold\", \"Rockin' in the free world\", \"Harvest Moon\"."
