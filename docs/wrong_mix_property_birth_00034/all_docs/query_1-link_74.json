        "text": "Words and photos by Rafe Arnott, except where credited.\n\nHeavy Rotation is a column focused on an LP in my collection. This month I’m discussing Neil Young Live At Massey Hall 1971, Reprise Records, 43328-1, NYAPS Disc 03, 2008\n\nSpacetime geometries are tricky things, as anyone familiar with Special Relativity can attest. But, due to the practically unparalleled fidelity of the January 19, 1971 recording of Neil Young Live at Massey Hall, you could forgive listeners of the double LP for believing they were one of the 2,752 souls seated for the concert at the Toronto venue 51 years ago. Regarded critically as a landmark of live recordings, its presentation style is a notable departure from a previous live album recorded just weeks earlier. Tracks laid to tape from a series of six concerts November 30 – December 2, 1970 in Washington D.C. at the Cellar Door showcased much of the same material. While less then two months separate the shows, the style of mic’ing which the venues themselves governed, created starkly different results. While it is difficult to choose a favourite between the two – as both offer the kind of transparency onto a performance which few artists can claim – it is the Massey Hall gig and the sense of space the recording reveals which leaves the deepest imprint. The album was produced and mixed by David Briggs live at the venue, with Bob Sterne of Northwest Sound handling acoustics that night.\n\nFeaturing only Young, several guitars and a grand piano on the stage, sad, lonely, bleak and poignant would all be suitable descriptors for the set list which make up this LP. Only eight out of the 18 songs performed during the evening’s second set had been previously recorded. The rest were new compositions that Young brought quietly into the night. Stripped down, stark pieces seemingly more comfortable in the shadow just beyond the lonely spotlight favoured by Young on stage. Once heard they are far more palatable than the versions pimped for Harvest a year later. Indeed, it is in this recording that one experiences a darker, introspective undercurrent of Young’s songwriting. A number of the pieces were written in 1970, during time exploring the California ranch – Broken Arrow – he’d recently acquired, and their focus tends to wisdom hard won, casting Young on an arc decades past his 26 years. As if reluctant to openly inform, his lyrics quietly breach the conscious surface, offering the listener glimpses of a time to come, fascinating in their own performative context, but especially so when considering the album didn’t see the light of day for 36 years. Officially being released as part of Young’s Archives Performance Series on March 13, 2007.\n\nPhoto above: Neil Young and a dog near the barn outbuildings on Broken Arrow Ranch, circa 1971.

A fitting name for the tour since it was almost four decades before anyone who didn’t sit in on one of the 22 North American tour dates in 1971 heard these compositions in such elemental form. Saccharine in comparison to the Massey Hall takes, no less than five songs from the concert ended up on Harvest. All with session musicians, backing vocals contributed by everyone from James Taylor and Linda Ronstadt to David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash – and featuring orchestral arrangements by the London Symphony. But, it was these versions which made it onto store shelves and got radio play, while the bleak solo performances from January 19 were – literally – lost to time.\n\nPhotos above: Left – Live At The Cellar Door was recorded just weeks before Massey Hall. Right – Harvest, the album that cemented the versions of the songs for decades in the public's mind.\n\nHere on this album is nostalgia too, as the tour, and the Massey Hall gig in particular, was the return of the prodigal son for many Canadians after Young’s exit to the United States in the mid-’60s. South of the border he quickly helped form psych/folk/rock sensation Buffalo Springfield, then moved on to become a solo star in his own right before the hat trick of adding his name to folk-rock supergroup Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (CSNY) in 1969. By the time the decade ended, it was a weary ‘70s that sought to musically heal a North American political and cultural divide exacerbated by damage inflicted by a new world order; the shock and awe of Vietnam, the U.S. draft, violent racial protests, high-profile political assassinations, Kent State, and the Cold War had burned through many vestiges of hope.\n\nAnd Young, like other artistic icons who had weathered the ‘60s, turned inward. The introspection of 1970 through 1971 at Broken Arrow made for fertile ground, seeding a prolific period of songwriting, but alas no studio album, ending a five-year run despite label Reprise having March, 1971 circled on their calendar for a live LP. Perhaps Young, in constant pain, suffering mobility issues while recovering from a spinal injury, weary after the moral grind of the late ‘60s, unconsciously (or determinedly) etched his writing with an underlying desolation. On “Helpless,” the first cut on side two, he even references the slipped disc, grunting – \"bending over is... not so much fun” – while reaching down to grab a dropped pick. Interviews with Young following the 2007 release of the Massey Hall album quote him as saying “This is the album that should have come out between After the Gold Rush and Harvest...David Briggs, my producer, was adamant that this should be the record, but I was very excited about the takes we got on Harvest, and wanted Harvest out. David disagreed. As I listen to this today, I can see why.\"\n\nI bought my copy of Live At Massey Hall when it was released in 2008, and it’s been a go-to album for both pure listening enjoyment and as a sonic baseline for evaluating the performance of equipment in my system ever since. I’m so familiar with the LP that playing it reveals any changes I may have implemented to the component lineup– for better or worse. Call it a sentinel performance measuring device if you will, but it is easily one of the best recorded albums in my vinyl collection. Massey Hall, like After The Gold Rush and Neil Young (which I also own from the Archives Recording Series), offers dead quiet, totally flat 180-gram slabs of vinyl with superlative dynamics. For this instalment of Heavy Rotation, I used my current preamplifier and power amplifier favourites, the Audio Note UK M3 Phono and Conqueror Silver, both all-valve (and valve-rectified) Class-A designs, with the Conqueror sporting AN UK-branded Psvane 300B output tubes. Disc rotation was handled by a Technics SL-1210GR kitted with an Auditorium 23 mat, and a vintage Audio Technica AT155LC moving magnet cartridge. Power cables were Audio Note’s own ISIS copper, and interconnects and speaker cables were OJAS. Speakers were a vintage pair of Altec A5 Voice of The Theatre with 288-16K compression drivers, 805B sectoral horns and 515E, 15-inch bass drivers in the cabinets wired with Vitavox crossovers.\n\nPhoto above: The system in use for this article – the Audio Note UK M3 Phono and Conqueror Silver.

The track sets up the huge, spacious mic’ing of the venue. This exquisite spatial interpretation of Massey Hall is what helps set the album apart from many other live recordings. Through the big Altecs the sound stage is enormous and all-encompassing, with Young’s voice projecting from well behind the speaker plane, effortlessly pushing back the front wall by several feet. “Tell Me Why” follows immediately and is again met with the energetic applause of the known as this was the first cut off 1970’s After The Gold Rush. But it is at this point, that he starts to engage with the crowd, as Young stops strumming his Martin guitar and admonishes what is taken to be a press photographer snapping images during his playing. “Could you not do that?” queries Young shyly, “The clicks are out of time and it makes me take my mind off what I’m trying to do…”\n\nPhoto above: Left – A curated mix of vintage moving magnet cartridge, crossovers and speakers with new turntable and amplifiers helped this album project a sound that was unervingly convincing in its fidelity to source. Right – Some of the releases from the Neil Young Archives Official Release Series which I own.\n\nFrom here Young proceeds to tune his guitar, adjust his mic stand, and touch on his purchase of Broken Arrow ranch, “This is a new song about my ranch… there’s this old man who lives on it. He came with the place when I bought it.” This is of course referencing ranch foreman Louis Avila, who, when he first gave Young a tour of the property and asked Young how he was able to afford the sprawling California estate, Young allegedly replied, \"Just lucky, Louie, just real lucky.\" Then, head down, Young quietly plucks the haunting and familiar opening bars to what would become one of his most poignant compositions. As a listener it is impossible to not be inexorably reeled in as he segues from audience banter to the sublime melancholy that is “Old Man.” One can easily intuit his head being thrown back as he belts out the chorus, lifting his voice to the Massey Hall rafters… “Old man, take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you/ I need someone to love me the whole day through/ Ah, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true.”\n\nClosing side one, and switching now to the grand piano, “Journey Through The Past” is presaged with Young’s confession to having a lot of new material. “I’ve written so many new [songs] that I can’t think of anything else to do with them other than sing them.” Distressingly misanthropic at times, Young seemingly navigates the keys through the still waters of a deep river, fabricating a subtext of raw emotions through the piece. Emotions surfacing from inky wells of silence between hammered notes, often punctuated by disconcerting, and spontaneous blasts of applause, for example, when Canada is mentioned in one line. This familial thread of country woven by Young throughout the performance aches with a longing for companionship, a preoccupation with time and its unyielding progression. A need to return to moments lost again and again.\n\nFlipping the album, Young’s guitar resonates with breathtaking spatial and textured realism as it parts the fading applause with “Helpless,” the recording capturing each tonal inflection from every pluck, strum and chord change-up like the after-image of a flashbulb on one’s retina. So startlingly lifelike do the AT155LC cartridge, Audio Note amps and hulking Altecs make Young’s vocal performance – “There is a town in North Ontario/ Dream comfort memory to spare/ And in my mind I still need a place to go/ All my changes were there” – that with one’s eyes closed the hind brain is fooled into believing he is close enough to touch, yet this tantalizing in-the-room presence is merely sonic illusion of the finest order. Playback like this is what many music lovers curate their systems to reproduce… one of many grails in high fidelity if you will. As with all things involving hi-fi, what you listen for is likely to not be what I listen for: So, YMMV. But the leading edge information, and richly-hued tonal colour spectrum which continue throughout the subsequent tracks of “Love In Mind,” “A Man Needs A Maid/Heart Of Gold Suite,” through to “Cowgirl In The Sand” to finish side two holds me rapt every time. I often find I’ve closed my eyes and am being dragged out of my reverie by the thunderous clapping demarcating the end of the side.\n\nThe second LP continues with a tour de force of stark renditions of some of Young’s most seminal compositions starting with a condensed version of “Don’t Let It Bring You Down,” off the b-side of After The Gold Rush. Haunting crescendos on the keys births “There’s A World,” (written in a Vancouver airport lounge on tour). “Bad Fog Of Loneliness,” follows after some asides regarding Young’s appearance on the Johnny Cash show, and wasn’t officially released until the Massey Hall tapes saw the light of day in 2007. Discussing the loss of young, promising artists to drug addiction sets up a deeply moving falsetto rendition of “The Needle And The Damage Done,” which is quickly followed by a startlingly sparse “Ohio,” that is by far the most powerful rendition of the song I’ve heard, and will be an eye opener for those who have not heard the solo version. Closing out the last side we have “See The Sky About To Rain,” with a chilling encore of the death ballad “Down By The River.” Crazy Horse staple “Dance, Dance, Dance,” switches gears to energize the audience and lightens the mood before his final offering of “I Am A Child.” Every cut a reminder of how important this recording has become for Young fans, not only because it contains such a deep dive of his early catalog, but because of the absolutely unrefined and utterly unrepentant political and cultural excoriations every track lays bare.\n\nOne cannot help but wonder what impact and legacy on music, culture and politics these powerhouse acoustic sets could have fomented had they been released in the March, 1971 slot Reprise had pencilled-in for Young. The unique fingerprint of this material is what separates it from his electric musings, stripped of their high-volume trappings, the Massey Hall versions are windows onto a lost view of the pervasive delicacy of Young’s string work and his mastery of the piano. The album proves space and time are not static, that past is present. Young, ever the solitary figure hunched over a guitar or conjuring alchemy at a piano, reaches out from the darkness beyond the spotlight to make the listener understand there is only self. Despite our preconceptions and hopes, we are alone and always will be."
