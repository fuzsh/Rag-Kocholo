        "text": "Neil Young & Crazy Horse have canceled their upcoming tour dates due to “a couple of us” suffering from a lingering illness, the same one that caused the band to cancel their shows in Chicago, Austin, and Dallas in May. Young did not specify if he is one of those members who’s sick. The affected tour dates include seven Canadian shows and eight U.S. dates, including Neil Young & Crazy Horse’s set at Eddie Vedder’s Ohana Fest.\n\n“The Love Earth Tour has been a great experience for us so far. GREAT AUDIENCES AND MUSIC. WE HAVE HAD A BLAST!” reads a new band statement on Young’s website. “When a couple of us got sick after Detroit’s Pine Knob, we had to stop. We are still not fully recovered, so sadly our great tour will have a big unplanned break. We will try to play some of the dates we miss as time passes when we are ready to rock again! We know many of you made travel plans and we apologize for the inconvenience. Thanks for your understanding and patience. Health is # 1. We want to stay and do more shows and more albums for you…. and for for us.”\n\nOn April 20, Young & Crazy Horse released their new album Fu##in’ Up. That nine-song record followed their previous band LP, 2022’s World Record. This Friday, the band will also roll out Early Daze, a long-in-the-works archival album that boasts unreleased recordings from Crazy Horse ’s beginnings.\n\nNeil Young:"
