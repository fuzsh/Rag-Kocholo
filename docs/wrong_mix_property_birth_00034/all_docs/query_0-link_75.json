Of course, Peter Gross was a part of my life for as long as I can remember, as a personality on CityTV and a friendly voice on 680News, but in 2018 I met him for the first time when he\n\nI didn't tune into a single Argos game this season until yesterday. That's not an anti-CFL thing, it's really much more of an anti-football thing. For the past decade, I've really only been interested in playoff football, be it of the CFL or NFL variety. But yesterday, when I got\n\nOnly about 13 months ago, I wrote this about Buffy Sainte-Marie. Go ahead and click over for a quick read. It's about how much this woman means to me. As listeners of Toronto Mike'd know, I'm a Buffy fan since the 70s when I saw her on Sesame Street. Buffy\n\nI get a lot of email. Some of it is good, some of it isn't. But I read everything sent to mike@torontomike.com. I received two emails back-to-back yesterday that really demonstrate the spectrum of feedback this independent content creator receives on a daily basis. This email arrived at\n\nAs I shared yesterday, I had a great time at the Toronto premiere of 299 Queen Street West, a documentary about Muchmusic. A fun nostalgic rump followed by great conversations with several FOTMs. I didn't bike home from Roy Thomson Hall until midnight. That doesn't mean this is a perfect\n\nI'm not sure who needs to hear this, but I'm passionately supportive of trans rights. I've never had an anti-trans thought in my little brain. I'm keen to anplify the voices of members of this community, as you might have heard in heartfelt conversations with Ariana about her transition and\n\nBefore you read any further, here's a big slab o' caveat for ya. Yes, MTV came before MuchMusic. I'm sure MuchMusic copied a great deal of what was airing on MTV. But I lived in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and I watched MuchMusic. I never saw a minute of MTV. So\n\nAbout a decade ago, a major character on Grey's Anatomy died suddenly in a car crash. I didn't watch this show, but my wife did, and she learned about this character's death because Roz Weston talked about it on his radio show the very next morning. I talked to Roz\n\nI just saw flurries falling from the sky, then took a rather windy and chilly bike ride. It feels like winter out there, and it is.... for a few more days at least. When it comes to Toronto weather in March, all bets are off. I have memories of big\n\nDo you remember attending Jays games as a kid? I do. I've loved that team since I was 8 years old. Seeing games at the old Exhibition Stadium was great fun, and part of that fun was the wave. If you've ever been to a baseball game, you likely know\n\nStarting April 4, we in Ontario can legally bet on single-game sports. iGaming Ontario, a subsidiary of the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario, made this announcement after Bill C-218 passed federally last August. Bill C-218 was a private member's bill brought forward by Kevin Waugh, Conservative MP for Saskatoon-Grasswood.\n\nThe buzz today is that Halloween is cancelled in Toronto. That's the headline you've likely seen or heard several times by now. In reality, the directive from Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, is this: Traditional door-to-door trick or treating is not recommended.No shit, Sherlock. Traditional door-to-door\n\nI've been thinking a lot about Halloween lately. I've got a six year old and a four year old and they're right in the Halloween wheelhouse. In this time of COVID-19, there's talk of cancelling Halloween, and I'm hoping that doesn't happen. When you break down the parts of Halloween\n\nI never had a MySpace page. I helped Custom run his in the early 2000s, but I never had an interest in creating one of my own. I preferred spending my energies here. I resisted creating a Facebook account until the summer of 2007 when my running group started planning\n\nMark Hebscher and I have a recurring disagreement over whether sports telecasts without fans in attendance should pipe in fake crowd noise. Hebsy believes hockey games will sound strange if there's no cheering after the home team scores a goal. He'd like an audio engineer to bring in cheers and\n\nI had quite the disagreement with Mark Hebscher on Friday's episode of Hebsy on Sports. I'm not talking about the fact he thinks Michael Jordan could have been an MLB player, which I passionately disagreed with, but I'm referring to the recent controversy over this tweet from Sportsnet personality Steve\n\nIt's been a rough 24 hours for social media hot takes from members of the MSM who oughta know better. Two incidents sparked this barrage of tweets: Cheers in Scotiabank Arena when Kevin Durant went down with his injury during Monday night's Raptors gameThe USA women's soccer team celebrating with\n\nReports of the demise of print journalism are greatly exaggerated. Print's not dead, it's just moving from dead trees to digital. The challenge for newspapers will be creating a model that can be fully funded in an environment of decreasing ad revenue. A paid subscription model is the obvious move\n\nDid you remember to spring ahead? 1 am magically became 2 am as we lost a precious hour this weekend. We left Standard Time, an old relic from the days when we were all farmers relying on the sun to determine when we awake and when we literally hit the\n\nJust my opinion, of course, but I think Stranger Thing is overrated. I've watched both seasons and thought it was okay, but nothing special. My favourite thing about the series, and the reason I've watched every episode, is the nostalgia factor. I was about the same age in the early-to-mid-80s\n\nI was forced to read far too much Shakespeare in University. Not that it was bad, but it just felt too schooly, and I never liked that feeling. Of course, it's my fault for taking all those Shakespeare classes in the first place... Billy S. gave Juliet this great line,\n\nI just watched the Juno Awards. As I type, Sarah McLachlan is actually still performing. It was a pretty good show with a brilliant tribute to Leonard Cohen by Feist. I don't know where she's been, but I'm glad she's back. A short while ago, The Tragically Hip won group\n\nDuring my conversation with Bubba O'Neil, the chat turned to race in Canadian sports media. He told me the best advice he'd received was from John Saunders who told him he'd have to work ten times as hard to make it, because he was a black man. Black people may\n\nIn the season four episode of The Simpsons \"Marge in Chains\" Mayor Quimby spoils the twist of The Crying Game. The episode originally aired on May 6, 1993, less than eight months after the movie's release. From a Simpsons podcast I subscribe to I learned about how Gene Siskel spoiled"
