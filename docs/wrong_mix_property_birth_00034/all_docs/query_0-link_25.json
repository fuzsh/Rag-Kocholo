        "text": "The film festival will kick off on Sept. 8 with the world premiere of \"The Magnificent Seven,\" a remake of the John Sturges' classic that was itself a remake of Akira Kurosawa's \"Seven Samurai.\" It stars Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt, while marking director Antoine Fuqua's third time at the festival. He previously screened \"Training Day\" and \"The Equalizer\" at Toronto. The festival will close on Sept. 18.\n\nJonathan Demme, Oliver Stone, and Mira Nair are just a few of the notable directors who will be bringing their latest films north of the border. Demme will offer up \"JT and the Tennessee Kids,\" which promises to pull back the curtain on Justin Timberlake's 20/20 Experience World Tour. The \"Silence of the Lambs' filmmaker has previously shot documentaries about musicians such as the Talking Heads and Neil Young. Stone will be on hand with another piece of political provocation, \"Snowden,\" a look at NSA leaker Edward Snowden that stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and was originally supposed to open last spring. Nair is fielding \"Queen of Katwe,\" an inspirational drama about a chess prodigy that stars Lupita Nyong'o and David Oyelowo.\n\nOne film that will likely draw a lot of interest from Oscar-ologists is \"Lion,\" a drama about a young man (Dev Patel) who reunites with his long-lost parents using Google Earth. The Weinstein Company, which has struggled at the box office of late and sat out last year's Best Picture Oscar race for the first time since 2008, is hoping that the film will propel the studio back into the thick of things.\n\nAfter setting off a bidding war at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival for his screenplay, Tom Ford will debut \"Nocturnal Animals.\" The twisty story of a woman whose life begins to mirror the manuscript of her ex-husband's first novel, stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Amy Adams, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Though best known as a fashion designer, Ford impressed critics with \"A Single Man,\" his 2009 Oscar-nominated feature film directing debut.\n\nAlong with Ford, Damien Chazelle will try to prove that his initial brush with success wasn't a fluke. The indie director turned heads in 2014 with \"Whiplash,\" his portrait of an ambitious drummer and an abusive instructor. He's back at the festival with \"La La Land,\" a musical that will try to prove that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling can hoof it with the best of them and carry a tune.\n\nIn past years, Oscar-winners or contenders such as \"Spotlight,\" \"The Martian,\" or \"The Theory of Everything\" have used Toronto to propel themselves forward in the race for awards glory and commercial success. The Canadian festival is seen as a must-stop on most major awards campaigns.\n\nHowever, even as the competition for gold statues intensifies, so too has the rivalry between festivals. To that end, Toronto has seen its prominence threatened by the Telluride Film Festival, which has the advantage of appearing earlier in the year, and boasts a more casual and relaxed vibe that some filmmakers find appealing. They've also lost out on several prominent fall releases to the New York Film Festival, which last year snagged the premiere of Steven Spielberg's \"Bridge of Spies\" and also nabbed the debut of David Fincher's \"Gone Girl\" in 2014.\n\nAt various points, Toronto brass have hit back at the competition, denying opening weekend slots to films that screened at other festivals. Although last year they loosened those restrictions, simply denying them access to their biggest venues.\n\nThere are risks to offering up films for public consumption before they hit theaters. Last year, the gay rights drama \"Freeheld\" and the crime thriller \"Legend\" both saw their Oscar chances snuffed out and their box office prospects dimmed when they got a lackluster response from Toronto audiences.\n\nThis year's festival will also include several films that have appeared at Cannes or the Sundande Film Festival. It's a list that includes Nate Parker's slave revolt drama \"The Birth of a Nation,\" Kenneth Lonergan's family drama \"Manchester by the Sea,\" Andrea Arnold's shaggy road trip odyssey \"American Honey,\" Jim Jarmusch's slice-of-life portrait of bus driver in \"Paterson,\" and Jeff Nichols' civil rights drama \"Loving.\"\n\nNot every film is a prestige play grappling with weighty issues. The lineup boasts a mixture of more commercially minded fare, such as \"Sing,\" a comedy animated musical comedy from the makers of \"Despicable Me,\" as well as romantic comedies such as Lone Scherfig's \"Their Finest\" or road trip yarns like Eleanor Coppola's \"Paris Can Wait.\" The festival's closing night film, \"The Edge of Seventeen,\" seems like a homage to John Hughes' high school dramedies. It stars Hailee Steinfeld, Blake Jenner, Woody Harrelson, and Kyra Sedgwick, as well as marks the feature film directing debut from Kelly Fremon Craig.\n\nMost of the major titles already have distribution, but Toronto is a market, as well as a festival. \"LBJ,\" which stars Woody Harrelson as President Lyndon Johnson, Jim Sheridan's \"The Secret Scripture\" with a cast that includes Vanessa Redgrave and Theo James, and \"The Headhunter's Calling\" with Gerard Butler, are among the films that are likely to attract attention from buyers.\n\nThe lineup also reflects the changing face of the film business. It's an industry that is no longer dominated exclusively by Hollywood players. Amazon has moved aggressively into the indies space, partnering with the likes of Woody Allen and Spike Lee on projects. It will be a presence at Toronto, screening films such as \"Paterson\" and \"The Handmaiden,\" an erotic thriller from Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook.\n\nThe festival said it will add to its initial list of 68 films in the weeks leading up to the festival.\n\nHere's a list of galas and special presentations:\n\nGALAS\n\n\"Arrival\" (Denis Villeneuve)\n\n\"Deepwater Horizon\" (Peter Berg)\n\n\"The Headhunter's Calling\" (Mark Williams)\n\n\"The Journey is the Destination\" (Bronwen Hughes)\n\n\"JT + The Tennessee Kids\" (Jonathan Demme)\n\n\"LBJ\" (Rob Reiner)\n\n\"Lion\" (Garth Davis)\n\n\"Loving\" (Jeff Nichols)\n\n\"A Monster Calls\" (J.A.
