        "text": "I heard this song in the 80s and really liked the video. When I first saw the 80s time lapsed video…I thought Young looked a little like Stephen King around this time…looking at it again…I still do. I want to thank Dave for the post that jarred my memory about After The Gold Rush.\n\nIt’s a song that was left off of After The Gold Rush back in 1970. He played it live with Crazy Horse but it would be 1983 when it finally appeared on the album Everybody’s Rockin’. It was re-cut into a 1950s style to fit the rest of the album. He made the album as Neil Young and the Shocking Pinks. There is a story in that as well.\n\nIn the early eighties, David Geffen signed Neil Young to a huge contract with Geffen Records. Neil Young who will do his own thing no matter what or when…released an album called “Trans” which was his foray into electronic music. Geffen wanted another “Harvest” with another Heart of Gold or Old Man…instead, he got “Computer Age” and “We R in Control” with Neil singing through a Vocoder.\n\nAfter that album Neil was asked to do more rock and roll by a Geffen record company executive…the record company was thinking more along the lines of the harder rock Rust Never Sleeps…so Neil gave them rock and roll all right… “Everybody’s Rockin” is an album full of early fifties Doo-wop and rockabilly-sounding songs in the middle of the 80s (thank you, Neil!). The record company was not amused…he then released an album full of country music… In his contract, Neil had full artistic freedom.\n\nGeffen had claimed the new albums were “unrepresentative” of Neil’s music. He sued Neil for 3.3 million dollars but the case was settled and Geffen lost and had to apologize to Neil. That shows you…sometimes life is fair.\n\nIf you look at Neil’s career…it was all about change and evolving so I don’t know what Geffen expected. Neil rarely repeats himself. Geffen was expecting early seventies Neil and that wasn’t happening. Young is not an artist that you mess with.\n\nAfter hearing the original version…I like both.. and I do enjoy the early rock and roll feel of it in the 80s version. The album peaked at #46 on the Billboard Album Charts, #22 in Canada, #21 in New Zealand, and #50 in the UK.\n\nWonderin’\n\nI’ve been walking all night long\n\nMy footsteps made me crazy\n\nBaby, you’ve been gone so long\n\nI’m wonderin’ if you’ll come home\n\nI’m hopin’ that you’ll be my baby\n\nI’m wonderin’ if I’ll be alone\n\nKnowin’ that I need you to save me.\n\nI’ve been talking all day long\n\nTo keep my heart from sadness\n\nBaby, you’ve been gone so long\n\nI’m wonderin’ if you’ll come home\n\nI’m hopin’ that you’ll be my baby\n\nI’m wonderin’ if I’ll be alone\n\nKnowin’ that I need you to save me.\n\nI’m wonderin’, I’m wonderin’,\n\nI’m wonderin’, I’m wonderin’,\n\nI’m wonderin’, I’m wonderin’,\n\nI’m wonderin’, I’m wonderin’.\n\nWell, I’m knowin’\n\nthat I need you to save me\n\nKnowin’ that I need you to save me.\n\nKnowin’ that I need you to save me.\n\nKnowin’ that I need you to save me.\n\nI’m wonderin’, I’m wonderin’.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving! Watching The Last Waltz is just as part of Thanksgiving as the meal with the family…that and listening to Alice’s Restaurant.\n\nThe Band on Thanksgiving in 1976 at the Fillmore West. The film starts off with THIS FILM MUST BE PLAYED LOUD! A cut to Rick Danko playing pool and then it then to the Band playing “Don’t Do It”…the last song they performed that night after hours of playing. Through the music and some interviews, their musical journey and influences are retraced.\n\nThis film is considered by many the best concert film ever made. It was directed by Martin Scorsese. I love the setting with the chandeliers that were from the movie Gone With The Wind. The quality of the picture is great because it was shot with a 35-millimeter camera which wasn’t normally done with concerts.\n\nBefore the Band and guests hit the stage, Bill Graham, the promoter, served a Thanksgiving dinner to 5000 people that made up the audience with long tables with white tablecloths.\n\nThe Band’s musical guests included\n\nRonnie Hawkins, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Dr. John, Paul Butterfield, Van Morrison (my favorite performance), Joni Mitchell, Eric Clapton and Muddy Waters\n\nThe Staple Singers and Emmylou Harris also appear but their segments were taped later on a sound stage and not at the concert.\n\nRobbie wanted off the road earlier and that is what the Last Waltz was all about…the last concert by The Band with a lot of musical friends. He was tired of touring and also the habits the band was picking up… drugs and drinking. Richard Manuel, in particular, was in bad shape and needed time.\n\nThe rest of the Band supposedly agreed but a few years later all of them but Robbie started to tour as The Band again. Richard Manuel ended up hanging himself in 1986. Rick Danko passed away in 1999 at the end of a tour of a heart attack attributed to years of drug and alcohol abuse. Levon Helm died of cancer in 2012.\n\nThe Band sounded great that night and it might be the best version you will ever hear of The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.\n\nThe Last Waltz is a grand farewell to a great band and a film that I revisit at least twice a year… once always around Thanksgiving.\n\nThe complete concert is at the bottom…without cuts.\n\nI have heard this song all of my life and never knew much about it. I like the song because of the sad lyrics set against upbeat music.\n\nDon Gibson wrote this song and it was produced by a legend of country music…Chet Atkins. Atkins, meanwhile, was inducted into the Country Music, Rock & Roll, and Musicians Halls of Fame. Atkins is also one of the primary figures credited with creating the “Nashville sound,” which transformed country music in the 1950s with a sound much cleaner and smoother than the style that preceded it.\n\nGibson released this in 1958 and it peaked at #7 on the Billboard 100. This was his only top-10 entry in the pop charts. Gibson, an inductee of the Country Music, Nashville Songwriters, and North Carolina Music Halls of Fame, wrote multiple songs now considered country standards.\n\nIt’s been covered by a lot of artists. Neil Young and The Kentucky Headhunters are just two that covered the song as well. It was the biggest hit The Headhunters had and it peaked at #8 on the Billboard Country Charts and #19 on the Canadian Country Charts in 1990.\n\nOthers who covered it are Johnny Cash who took it to #13 Country and #93 on the Hot 100 in 1961…Stonewall Jackson’s 1970 rendition went to #63 Country. Other acts to cover the song include Bing Crosby, Bob Luman, Southern Culture on the Skids, Ray Charles, Connie Francis, and Bobbi Martin.\n\nNeil Young covered it on his album After The Gold Rush in 1970.\n\nOh Lonesome Me\n\nEverybody’s going out and having fun\n\nI’m a fool for staying home and having none.\n\nI can’t get over how she set me free.\n\nOh, lonesome me.\n\nThere must be some way that I can lose these lonesome blues\n\nForget about my past and find someone new\n\nI’ve thought of everything from A to Z\n\nOh, lonesome me.\n\nI’ll bet she’s not like me.\n\nShe’s out and fancy free,\n\nFlirting with the boys with all her charms\n\nBut I still love her so,\n\nAnd brother don’t you know\n\nI’d welcome her right back here in my arms\n\nHope you all are having a good week…happy Wednesday!\n\nAnd he dug up her grave and built a cage with her bones\n\nExcitable boy, they all said well, he’s just an excitable boy …. Warren Zevon\n\nI’ll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon\n\nAnd another girl can take my pain away…Rolling Stones\n\nWe were the first band to vomit at the bar and find the distance to the stage too far meanwhile it’s getting late at ten o’clock rock is dead they say Long Live Rock…The Who\n\nCause when life looks like Easy Street there is danger at your door… The Grateful Dead\n\nThen here come a man with a paper and a pen tellin’ us our hard times are about to end… The Band\n\nI could walk like Brando right into the sun then dance just like a Casanova… Bruce Springsteen\n\nElementary penguin singing Hare Krishna man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allen Poe …The Beatles\n\nMother, you had me but I never had you I, I wanted you\n\nYou didn’t want me so, I just got to tell you goodbye … John Lennon\n\nExchanging “good luck”s face to face checkin’ his stash by the trash at St. Mark’s place …The Replacements\n\nWe come from the land of the ice and snow from the midnight sun where the hot springs flow… Led Zeppelin\n\nEvery day, I look at the world from my window but chilly, chilly is the evening time\n\nWaterloo sunset’s fine… The Kinks\n\nI don’t wanna be a candidate for Vietnam or Watergate… Queen\n\nIf I ventured in the slipstream between the viaducts of your dream… Van Morrison\n\nI am just a dreamer but you are just a dream and you could have been anyone to me… Neil Young\n\nSo we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner pies\n\nand walked off to look for America…Simon and Garfunkel\n\nFor those in the US and celebrate Memorial Day…Happy Memorial Day!\n\nI had a friend’s dad who owned their 1969 greatest hits album when I was in sixth grade and we wore it out. Broken Arrow, Bluebird, Mr. Soul, For What It’s Worth, and Expecting to Fly were the ones we played over and over and caught something we missed in the previous play.\n\nIn 1966 a folk-rock band was formed in Los Angeles from a mix of Canadian and American musicians. It was called Buffalo Springfield. The band consisted of Stephen Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Dewey Martin (drums, vocals), Bruce Palmer (electric bass), Richie Furay (guitar, vocals), and Neil Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals).\n\nBuffalo Springfield is a band that gets lost in the shuffle at times. People know their big hit “For What It’s Worth” but little about the band. They were only active between 1966-68 but had a huge impact on other artists. The band was very talented……with Neil Young, Stephen Stills, Richie Furay, Bruce Palmer, Dewey Martin, and Jim Messina who replaced Bruce Palmer. They had some great songs like Mr. Soul, Nowadays Clancy Can’t Even Sing, Burned, Expecting to Fly, Bluebird, Rock and Roll Woman, Broken Arrow, and their big hit For What It’s Worth. Buffalo Springfield is a band that never quite reached its true potential but still made a big impression in the late sixties and after.\n\nBefore forming this band, Furay and Stills had played together in the Au Go Go Singers. Palmer and Young had played together in the Mynah Birds. That band featured Rick James on lead vocals and was signed to Motown. Just think about that for a second…Neil Young and Super Freak himself…Rick James was in a band together. They sounded much like the Stones.\n\nIf Buffalo Springfield would have stayed together… it’s little doubt they would have gotten much bigger than they did with the talented members they had in place. The name of the group was inspired by the Buffalo-Springfield steamroller made by the Buffalo-Springfield Roadroller Company in Springfield, Ohio.\n\nIn 1967 they released their second album Buffalo Springfield Again. The album peaked at #44 in the Billboard Album Charts. Bluebird peaked at #58 on the Billboard 100 and #38 in Canada. Three singles in total were pulled off the album.\n\nAfter various drug-related arrests and line-up changes, Buffalo Springfield decided to break up in 1968. Stephen Stills went on to form the folk-rock supergroup Crosby, Stills & Nash with David Crosby of the Byrds and Graham Nash of the Hollies. Neil Young launched his successful solo career and reunited in 1969 with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.\n\nNeil Young on the breakup: “I just couldn’t handle it towards the end. It wasn’t me scheming on a solo career, it wasn`t anything but my nerves. Everything started to go too fucking fast. I was going crazy, joining and quitting, joining and quitting again. I began to feel like I didn’t have to answer or obey anyone. I needed more space. That was the big problem in my head. So I’d quit, then I`d come back ‘cos it sounded so good. It was a constant problem. I just wasn’t mature enough to deal with it. I was very young. We were getting the shaft from every angle, and it seemed like we were trying to make it so bad and getting nowhere.”\n\nBluebird\n\nListen to my bluebird laugh\n\nShe can’t tell you why\n\nDeep within her heart, you see\n\nShe knows only crying\n\nJust crying\n\nThere she sits, aloft at perch\n\nStrangest color blue\n\nFlying is forgotten now\n\nThinks only of you\n\nJust you\n\nOh yeah\n\nSo, get all those blues\n\nMust be a thousand hues\n\nAnd be just differently used\n\nYou just know\n\nYou sit there mesmerized\n\nBy the depth of her eyes\n\nThat you can’t categorize\n\nShe got soul\n\nShe got soul\n\nShe got soul\n\nShe got soul\n\nDo you think she loves you\n\nDo you think at all\n\nSoon she’s going to fly away\n\nSadness is her own.\n\nGive herself a bath of tears\n\nAnd go home, and go home\n\n…\n\nToday through Friday I will feature nothing but Canadian artists. It will be some left off because I could go on forever. Oh NO…where to put Justin Beiber? Nah, I’ll skip him… I will feature at least 2 artists I’ve never blogged on before and both are huge…and worlds apart.\n\nI thought I would start off this Monday with no other than Uncle Neil. Young had no trouble coming up with verses to this song. He has said…he came up with 126 verses and the trouble came with editing it down. His was first released as the B-side of Young’s first single as a solo artist, “The Loner.” He used it as a B-side on a few other singles, but did not put it on an album until his 1977 Greatest Hits compilation Decade.\n\nYoung wrote this song in a room at the Fort William’s Victoria Hotel in Ontario. He wrote the song on his 19th birthday on November 12, 1964. The song is about lost childhood but he had a firm grasp on being an adult going by the song.\n\nJoni Mitchell has said that what prompted him to write this was that Neil really soon, could no longer visit an under-21 club that he favored. That is not to say that the said club would be “Sugar Mountain” itself. But being barred from the venue, according to Mitchell, would have been one of the factors that made the singer realize that some of the joys of childhood simply cannot be innocently replicated as we get older.\n\nSpeaking of Joni Mitchell. She wrote an “answer” song to this one called The Circle Game. Sugar Mountain is also on his Sugar Mountain – Live at Canterbury House 1968 released in 2008.\n\nNeil Young on his new friend (which he doesn’t name) at this time: “Mainly, he was the funniest person I’d met in years. He didn’t have another gig until next weekend, so he stayed in Thunder Bay and we played and he took us to see Buffalo. We lived on A&W cheeseburgers and root beer. Very Canadian.”\n\nNeil Young: “At first I wrote 126 verses to it. Now, you can imagine that I had a lot of trouble figuring out what four verses to use… I was underneath the stairs… Anyway, this verse that I wrote… It was the worst verse of the 126 that I wrote. So, I decided to put it in the song, to just to give everybody a frame of reference as to, you know, what can happen. What I’m trying to say here, by stopping in the middle of the song, and explaining this to you, is that… I think it’s one of the lamest verses I ever wrote. And it takes a lotta nerve for me to get up here and sing it in front of you people. But, if when I’m finished singing, you sing the chorus ‘Sugar Mountain’ super loud, I’ll just forget about it right away and we can continue.”\n\nNeil Young: “I do ‘Sugar Mountain’ really for the people more than I do it for myself. I think I owe it to them, cos it seems to really make them feel happy, so that’s why I do that. They pay a lotta money to come and see me and I lay a lotta things on ’em that they’ve never heard before, and I think I owe it to them to do things they can really identify with. It’s such a friendly song, and the older I get and the older my audience gets the more relevant it becomes, especially since they’ve been singing it for 20 years. It really means a lot to them, so I like to give ’em the chance to enjoy that moment.”\n\nSugar Mountain\n\nOh, to live on sugar mountain\n\nWith the barkers and the colored balloons\n\nYou can’t be twenty on sugar mountain\n\nThough you’re thinking that you’re leaving there too soon\n\nYou’re leaving there too soon\n\nIt’s so noisy at the fair\n\nBut all your friends are there\n\nAnd the candy floss you had\n\nAnd your mother and your dad\n\nOh, to live on sugar mountain\n\nWith the barkers and the colored balloons\n\nYou can’t be twenty on sugar mountain\n\nThough you’re thinking that you’re leaving there too soon\n\nYou’re leaving there too soon\n\nThere’s a girl just down the aisle\n\nOh to turn and see her smile\n\nYou can hear the words she wrote\n\nAs you read the hidden note\n\nOh, to live on sugar mountain\n\nWith the barkers and the colored balloons\n\nYou can’t be twenty on sugar mountain\n\nThough you’re thinking that you’re leaving there too soon\n\nYou’re leaving there too soon\n\nNow you’re underneath the stairs\n\nAnd you’re giving back some glares\n\nTo the people who you met\n\nAnd it’s your first cigarette\n\nOh, to live on sugar mountain\n\nWith the barkers and the colored balloons\n\nYou can’t be twenty on sugar mountain\n\nThough you’re thinking that you’re leaving there too soon\n\nYou’re leaving there too soon\n\nNow you say you’re leaving home\n\n‘Cause you want to be alone\n\nAin’t it funny how you feel\n\nWhen you’re finding out it’s real\n\nOh, to live on sugar mountain\n\nWith the barkers and the colored balloons\n\nYou can’t be twenty on sugar mountain\n\nThough you’re thinking that you’re leaving there too soon\n\nYou’re leaving there too soon\n\nOh, to live on sugar mountain\n\nWith the barkers and the colored balloons\n\nYou can’t be twenty on sugar mountain\n\nThough you’re thinking that you’re leaving there too soon\n\nI have to admit…I didn’t know this existed until a few days ago. I was looking for more Dylan Christmas songs and this popped up. I will be honest…Little Drummer Boy has never been my favorite Christmas song but this version is probably the best I’ve heard.\n\nIt comes from Seven Gates: A Christmas Album by Ben Keith and Friends, which was released in 1994. It was co-produced by Neil Young. You can hear Johnny Cash loud and clear but Neil doesn’t have his usual voice in this one.\n\nBen Keith and Neil Young’s relationship began when the multi-instrumentalist Keith first worked with him in 1971 on the Harvest album. The two were introduced together by the producer Elliot Mazer, who found him in Nashville and asked him to be a last-minute session musician on the record. After that first meeting, they helped each other until Ben Keith passed away at Neil Young’s ranch in 2010.\n\nRemarkably, this cover is the only time that Johnny Cash and Neil Young have ever collaborated. Neil was a guest on The Johnny Cash Show in the early seventies.\n\nThe song was written by Harry Simeone, Katherine Kennicott Davis, and Henry Onorati. First recorded in 1951 by the Trapp Family. The song was originally titled “Carol of the Drum” and was based upon a traditional Czech carol.\n\nNeil also contributed Greensleeves on that album so I thought I would add that below.\n\nNeil Young on the Johnny Cash Show.\n\nLittle Drummer Boy\n\nCome they told me, pa rum pa pum pum\n\nOur newborn King to see, pa rum pa pum pum\n\nOur finest gifts we bring, pa rum pa pum pum\n\nTo lay before the King, pa rum pa pum pum,\n\nRum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum,\n\nSo to honor Him, pa rum pa pum pum,\n\nWhen we come…\n\nLittle Baby , pa rum pa pum pum\n\nI am a poor boy too, pa rum pa pum pum\n\nI have no gift to bring, pa rum pa pum pum\n\nTo lay before the King, pa rum pa pum pum,\n\nRum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum,\n\nShall I play for you, pa rum pa pum pum,\n\nOn my drum?…\n\nMary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum\n\nThe ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum\n\nI played my drum for Him, pa rum pa pum pum\n\nI played my best for Him, pa rum pa pum pum\n\nRum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum\n\nThen He smiled at me, pa rum pa pum pum\n\nMe and my drum…\n\nMe and my drum…\n\nMe and my drum…\n\nMe and my drum…\n\nMe and my drum…\n\n…\n\nBut I shot a man in Reno, Just to watch him die… Johnny Cash\n\nIt doesn’t get much better than that.\n\nThe man in black was The Man. Not many performers can cross genres like Johnny Cash did and still does. He first recorded this song in 1955 at Sun Records as the B side to “S3o Doggone Lonesome” but it was the live 1969 version that hit.\n\nThe At Folsom Prison album helped revitalize Cash’s career. Up to this point, his last Country top 40 entry was in 1964. This was recorded live at Folsom Prison in California on January 13, 1968, and that album came to define his outlaw image. The record company told him it wouldn’t work but Johnny recorded at the prison anyway.\n\nFolsom Prison Blues peaked at #1 on the Billboard Country Charts, #1 on the Canadian Country Charts, #32 on the Billboard 100, and #17 on the Canadian Pop Charts. The song and album generated a lot of interest in the rebellious Johnny Cash, who made prison reform his political cause of choice. He started regularly performing in jails, doing about 12 shows a year for free mostly in Folsom and San Quentin.\n\nThe album peaked at #1 in the Billboard Country Charts, #13 in the Billboard Album Charts, and #27 in Canada.\n\nThis iconic picture came from Folsom Prison. According to photographer Jim Marshall…he asked Cash to express what he thought of the prison authorities when he played the show. Marshall told Cash “let’s do a shot for the warden” and the picture was born.\n\nCash saw Crane Wilbur’s 90-minute film Inside the Walls of Folsom Prison while stationed in Germany. It left an impression on Cash, who emphasized the tale of the imprisoned men, and inspired him to write a song. Johnny Cash: “It was a violent movie, I just wanted to write a song that would tell what I thought it would be like in prison.”\n\nCash’s first prison performance occurred in 1957 when he performed for inmates at Huntsville State Prison. The favorable response inspired Cash to perform at more prisons through the years. His next hit, recorded in San Quentin Prison, was the humorous “A Boy Named Sue,” which proved that he could be clever and funny.\n\nCash came off as a champion for the oppressed. He got his own national TV show in 1969 and became one of the most popular entertainers of his era. His guests included Derek and the Dominos, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Linda Ronstadt, Kris Kristofferson, Mickey Newbury, Neil Young, Gordon Lightfoot, Merle Haggard, James Taylor, Tammy Wynette, and Roy Orbison.\n\nIsn’t that list incredible? Cash was considered a Country-Folk artist but look at the range of performers. The late sixties and seventies were like this ….and it’s the reason I like them so much…all the generations intersected at that point in time. I mean you have Eric Clapton and then you have Tammy Wynette on the guest list.\n\nThe lyrics to this song were based on a 1953 recording called Crescent City Blues by a bandleader named Gordon Jenkins with Beverly Maher on vocals. After filing a lawsuit, Gordon Jenkins received an out-of-court settlement from Cash in 1969. I have to say it does sound really close.\n\nJohnny Cash: “I don’t see anything good come out of prison. You put them in like animals and tear out the souls and guts of them, and let them out worse than they went in.”\n\nRosanne Cash: “He was a real man with great faults, and great genius and beauty in him, but he wasn’t this guy who could save you or anyone else.”\n\nFolsom Prison Blues\n\n(Hello, I’m Johnny Cash)\n\nI hear the train a-comin’\n\nIt’s rollin’ ’round the bend\n\nAnd I ain’t seen the sunshine\n\nSince I don’t know when\n\nI’m stuck in Folsom Prison\n\nAnd time keeps draggin’ on\n\nBut that train keeps a-rollin’\n\nOn down to San Antone\n\nWhen I was just a baby\n\nMy Mama told me, “son\n\nAlways be a good boy\n\nDon’t ever play with guns”\n\nBut I shot a man in Reno\n\nJust to watch him die\n\nWhen I hear that whistle blowin’\n\nI hang my head and cry (play it to the verse, yeah)\n\n(Sue it)\n\nI bet there’s rich folks eatin’\n\nFrom a fancy dining car\n\nThey’re probably drinkin’ coffee\n\nAnd smokin’ big cigars\n\nWell, I know I had it comin’\n\nI know I can’t be free\n\nBut those people keep a-movin’\n\nAnd that’s what tortures me (hit it)\n\n(Howdy-ho)\n\nWell, if they freed me from this prison\n\nIf that railroad train was mine\n\nI bet I’d move it on, a little\n\nFarther down the line\n\nFar from Folsom Prison\n\nThat’s where I want to stay\n\nAnd I’d let that lonesome whistle\n\nBlow my blues away\n\n(yeah)\n\nHappy Thanksgiving! Watching The Last Waltz is just as part of Thanksgiving as the meal with the family…that and Alice’s Restaurant which is coming.\n\nThe Band on Thanksgiving in 1976 at the Fillmore West. The film starts off with THIS FILM MUST BE PLAYED LOUD! A cut to Rick Danko playing pool and then it then to the Band playing “Don’t Do It”…the last song they performed that night after hours of playing. Through the music and some interviews, their musical journey and influences are retraced.\n\nThis film is considered by many the best concert film ever made. It was directed by Martin Scorsese. I love the setting with the chandeliers that were from the movie Gone With The Wind. The quality of the picture is great because it was shot with a 35-millimeter camera which wasn’t normally done with concerts.\n\nBefore the Band and guests hit the stage, Bill Graham, the promoter, served a Thanksgiving dinner to 5000 people that made up the audience with long tables with white tablecloths.\n\nThe Band’s musical guests included\n\nRonnie Hawkins, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Dr. John, Paul Butterfield, Van Morrison (my favorite performance), Joni Mitchell, Eric Clapton and Muddy Waters\n\nThe Staple Singers and Emmylou Harris also appear but their segments were taped later on a sound stage and not at the concert.\n\nRobbie wanted off the road earlier and that is what the Last Waltz was all about…the last concert by The Band with a lot of musical friends. He was tired of touring and also the habits the band was picking up… drugs and drinking. Richard Manuel, in particular, was in bad shape and needed time.\n\nThe rest of the Band supposedly agreed but a few years later all of them but Robbie started to tour as The Band again. Richard Manuel ended up hanging himself in 1986. Rick Danko passed away in 1999 at the end of a tour of a heart attack attributed to years of drug and alcohol abuse. Levon Helm died of cancer in 2012.\n\nThe Band sounded great that night and it might be the best version you will ever hear of The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.\n\nThe Last Waltz is a grand farewell to a great band and a film that I revisit at least twice a year… once always around Thanksgiving.\n\nThe complete concert is at the bottom…without cuts.\n\nEveryone seemed to like the first one so I thought I would bring it back. I did list many of the lyrics that you suggested in the comments on the other post…SO… this post was written by all of us…and uh…the ones that actually wrote the songs!\n\nSometimes my burden is more than I can bear, it’s not dark yet but it’s gettin’ there... Bob Dylan\n\nThe sunshine bores the daylights out of me…Rolling Stones\n\nI asked Bobby Dylan, I asked The Beatles, I asked Timothy Leary, but he couldn’t help me either, they called me the Seeker…The Who\n\nCows are giving kerosene, the kid can’t read at seventeen, the words he knows are all obscene, but it’s alright… The Grateful Dead\n\nYou take what you need and you leave the rest, but they should never have taken the very best… The Band\n\nWild thing you make my heart sing you make everything groovy… The Troggs\n\nThere were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away… Bruce Springsteen\n\nRich man, poor man, beggar man thief you ain’t got a hope in hell, that’s my belief… ACDC\n\nThe farther one travels the less one knows the less one really knows …The Beatles\n\nMy friends are gone and my hair is grey I ache in places I used to play …Leonard Cohen\n\nWhatever gets you through the night … John Lennon\n\nGod, what a mess, on the ladder of success Where you take one step and miss the whole first rung …The Replacements\n\nOh, let the sun beat down upon my face and stars fill my dream I’m a traveler of both time and space… Led Zeppelin\n\nGirls will be boys and boys will be girls, It’s a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world, except for Lola La-la-la-la Lola… The Kinks\n\nShe keeps her Moet et Chandon in her pretty cabinet “Let them eat cake”, she says just like Marie Antoinette… Queen\n\nShammy cleaning all the windows singing songs about Edith Piaf’s soul… Van\n\nYou can’t be twenty on Sugar Mountain though you’re thinking that you’re leaving there too soon… Neil Young\n\nHello darkness, my old friend I’ve come to talk with you again…Simon and Garfunkel\n\nRonnie Van Zant: “I confess, those songs are there to\n\ncause some controversy. I like looking for trouble. I mean, I always dug\n\nNeil Young and we’ve been friends ever since the song came out. It was just there to provoke a little excitement. Ya gotta catch the audience off guard to keep ’em\n\nlistening.”\n\nI was never going to post this song because it is one of the most overplayed songs in rock history. I still like Ed King’s opening riff…it’s so crisp and clear. The Turn It Up phrase was a mistake. Van Zant was telling the engineer to turn up the volume in his headphones…they liked it so they kept it.\n\nWhile writing this post I listened to the song around 5 times in headphones. I noticed things that I’ve overlooked through the years just because I was so familiar with it. The song has some great hooks, riffs, and piano fills. Forget the lyrics…the music for this song is full of catchy runs. I heard things I never heard before…I now know why it was a hit.\n\nIn a rehearsal for the first album Gary Rossington was playing around with the simple D-C-G chord structure and Ed King added the main intro. They knew they had something special and it was written in a few minutes. After writing this Van Zant said, “this is our Rambling Man” in reference to the Allman Brothers’ rare hit single. The song ended up on the second album (Second Helping) and became a breakout hit for the band.\n\nThe song peaked at #8 on the Billboard 100, #6 in Canada, and #31 in the UK in 1974. The band was very popular in the UK.\n\nThere’s absolutely zero doubt Sweet Home Alabama was a revenge song—a rebuttal to Neil Young’s Alabama and Southern Man…for the sweeping generalization of all southerners as bigots past and at that time present by Neil. Neil even admits this now.\n\nNeil Young: “My own song ‘Alabama’ richly deserved the shot Lynyrd Skynyrd gave me with their great record. I don’t like my words when I listen to it. They are accusatory and condescending, not fully thought out, and too easy to misconstrue.”\n\nThere is also an easter egg in the song. After Van Zant sings “Well I heard Mr. Young sing about her” you can hear what sounds like Neil Young singing Southern Man out of the left speaker…it’s Al Kooper the producer imitating Young. You need headphones to hear it.\n\nThis song did not start any bad feelings between the two singers in fact it drew them closer. Neil was a fan of Van Zant and Van Zant was a fan of Neil and wore his shirt many times. Neil Young sent Ronnie Van Zant the song Powderfinger for the band to record but the plane crash put an end to that. Young performed Sweet Home Alabama one time only at a benefit less than a month after the plane crash as a tribute to them.\n\nJust as Bruce Springsteen’s Born In The USA was misinterpreted, this song was also. The line about George Wallace has drawn controversy… In Birmingham they love the governor (Boo, Boo, Boo). Some ignored the boo’s, and at first thought, they endorsed the guy.\n\nRonnie Van Zant: “Wallace and I have very little in common, I don’t like what he says about black people.”\n\nIn the Watergate lyrics, it’s been said that Van Zant was saying the north made mistakes also. The Swamper’s lyrics are about the Muscle Shoals recording band with Jimmy Johnson.\n\nThe backup singers were Merry Clayton and Clydie King. Merry Clayton was on Gimme Shelter and amazingly enough…Southern Man by Neil Young.\n\nThe band would also dive into gun control with “Saturday Night Special” and saving the environment with “All I Can Do Is Write About It.”\n\nRonnie Van Zant: “We thought Neil was shooting all the ducks in order to kill one or two. We’re southern rebels, but more than that, we know the difference between right and wrong.”\n\nSweet Home Alabama\n\nBig wheels keep on turning\n\nCarrying me home to see my kin\n\nSinging songs about the southland\n\nI miss Alabamy once again\n\nAnd I think it’s a sin, yes\n\nWell I heard Mr. Young sing about her\n\nWell I heard old Neil put her down\n\nWell I hope Neil Young will remember\n\nA southern man don’t need him around anyhow\n\nSweet home Alabama\n\nWhere the skies are so blue\n\nSweet Home Alabama\n\nLord, I’m coming home to you\n\nIn Birmingham they love the governor (boo, boo, boo)\n\nNow we all did what we could do\n\nNow Watergate does not bother me\n\nDoes your conscience bother you?\n\nTell the truth\n\nSweet home Alabama\n\nWhere the skies are so blue\n\nSweet Home Alabama\n\nLord, I’m coming home to you\n\nHere I come Alabama\n\nNow Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers\n\nAnd they’ve been known to pick a song or two\n\nLord they get me off so much\n\nThey pick me up when I’m feeling blue\n\nNow how about you?\n\nSweet home Alabama\n\nWhere the skies are so blue\n\nSweet Home Alabama\n\nLord, I’m coming home to you\n\nSweet home Alabama (Oh sweet home baby)\n\nWhere the skies are so blue\n\nSweet Home Alabama (Lordy)\n\nLord, I’m coming home to you\n\nYea, yea\n\nMy friend and I discovered his father’s Buffalo Springfield’s greatest hits album in the early eighties. I grew to be a fan then and there, before I knew about Stills, Young, and the rest. Broken Arrow was my favorite song but Mr. Soul, For What It’s Worth, and this one we could not get enough of.\n\nThis song was Buffalo Springfield’s first single and the breakout for both Stephen Stills and Neil Young – although it wasn’t supposed to be. Originally the song Go and Say Goodbye by Stephen Stills on the A-side and Young’s Nowadays Clancy Can’t Even Sing on the B-side, before their producers caved to pressure from distributors and flipped the sides.\n\nRichie Furay sings the lead on this song after hearing Young play it earlier. Furay had songs he wanted to include on the album. His songs got lost in the shuffle with the Stills and Young and the developing rivalry between the two.\n\nIt wasn’t a smash by any means, but it charted at #110 in the Billboard 100 and #75 in Canada in 1966… so it got some airplay and was a regional success in California. Their album Buffalo Springfield peaked at #80 in the Billboard Album charts in 1967.\n\nIn Los Angeles, California’s WKHJ was the first radio station to play the song. Buffalo Springfield’s management arranged this feat by giving the station advanced tapes of “A Day In The Life” by the Beatles, which gave them the chance to break the song ahead of anyone else.\n\nNeil Young wrote this song, which is partially based on one of his real-life schoolmates. Ross “Clancy” Smith attended Kelvin High School in Winnipeg, Canada, with Young.\n\nNeil Young: “He was a kind of persecuted member of the community. He used to be able to do something, sing or something, and then he wasn’t able to do it anymore. The fact was that all the other problems or things that were seemingly important didn’t mean anything anymore because he couldn’t do what he wanted to do.”\n\nThe Carpenters did a version on their album Ticket To Ride in 1969.\n\nFrom Songfacts\n\nFurther stress on the band’s debut was brought about by frustration with their producers. Though the legendary Ahmet Ertegun was their mentor, they’d been hooked up through the management team of Charlie Greene and Brian Stone, who were clearly out of their depth. Greene and Stone named themselves Buffalo Springfield’s producers and had them signed not to Atlantic proper or even their subsidiary Atco, but to their own York/Pala Records label, giving them a bigger slice of the profit pie than they otherwise would have been entitled to. As drummer Bruce Palmer is quoted in Neil Young: Long May You Run: The Illustrated History, “They were the sleaziest, most underhanded, backstabbing motherf–kers in the business! They were the best!”\n\nAlso from that book: “What hurt the album more than anything, though, was Greene and Stone’s production. Despite the Springfield’s strength as a live act, the managers forced each musician to record separately, piecing the parts together. Worse, after the band participated in the mono mix, Greene and Stone quickly converted the album to stereo, resulting in a tinny mix that outrages the group to this day. Young commented that Greene and Stone made them sound like the All-Insect Orchestra.”\n\nIn the same book, classmate Diana Halter says Clancy had multiple sclerosis, and was “so intelligent and so bright that he masked the sweet soul beneath it all.”\n\nAll accounts taken together, it’s hard to put an exact picture together of what made Clancy such a standout figure, but all agree he was exactly that.\n\nThough Clancy was an inspiring figure in the song, “Nowadays Clancy Can’t Even Sing” is about Young as much as it about Clancy. He wrote it in 1965 after having a terrible time in Toronto, where his attempts to get things going as a professional musician totally flopped. The rejection he experienced there was so complete (“humbling,” as he called it) that it sent him into a fit of introspective, frustrated songwriting. Out of this pain began to emerge the songwriting style on which Young would build his legend. The pinnacle of those songs, many of which were only recorded on demos or not recorded at all, was “Nowadays Clancy Can’t Even Sing.”\n\nReleased on Buffalo Springfield’s eponymous debut album, the song peaked at #110, which wasn’t very good at that time. Unlike the modern era when there are so many bands and expectations are a bit more muted, back then a major-label act, even a new one, was expected to at least break into the top 100 to be considered commercially viable. The song was popular in the Los Angeles area, however, which was the nexus of hippie counterculture.\n\nYoung first recorded this song on a January 1966 demo for Elektra Records (Elektra rejected the demos). It can be heard on the 2009 release of The Archives Vol. 1 1963–1972.\n\nThere’s a live solo recording of the song on Sugar Mountain – Live at Canterbury House 1968.\n\nThe psychedelic band Fever Tree recorded the song in 1968 on their self-titled debut album.\n\nFuray got an early preview of this song from Young himself when the Canadian visited Furay’s New York City apartment. He was auditioning to be house performer at a nightclub called the The Bitter End and played it there. Some of the auditions were recorded but haven’t been released anywhere.\n\nThe Clancy Brothers inspired the musical form in this song, with its Irish-styled 2/4 rhythm verses and 3/4 rhythm choruses.\n\nMany journalists and historians have noted this song as Young’s artistic breakthrough, the one that helped him find the niche that would give him the kind of appeal that endured over 50 years later.\n\nWho’s coming home on old 95?\n\nEinarson in Don’t Be Denied posits that this line might refer to a trip that Young took home to Winnipeg in the fall of ’65, suggesting that the train was numbered 95.\n\nNowadays Clancy Can’t Even Sing\n\nHey who’s that stomping all over my face?\n\nWhere’s that silhouette I’m trying to trace?\n\nWho’s putting sponge in the bells I once rung?\n\nAnd taking my gypsy before she’s begun?\n\nTo singing the meaning of what’s in my mind\n\nBefore I can take home what’s rightfully mine\n\nJoinin’ and listenin’ and talkin’ in rhymes\n\nStoppin’ the feeling to wait for the times\n\nWho’s saying baby that don’t mean a thing\n\n‘Cause nowadays Clancy can’t even sing\n\nAnd who’s all hung-up on that happiness thing?\n\nWho’s trying to tune all the bells that he rings?\n\nAnd who’s in the corner and down on the floor?\n\nWith pencil and paper just counting the score?\n\nAnd who’s trying to act like he just in between?\n\nThe night isn’t black, it can only be screened\n\nDon’t bother looking you’re too blind to see\n\nWho’s coming on like he wanted to be\n\nWho’s saying baby, that don’t mean a thing\n\n‘Cause nowadays Clancy can’t even sing\n\nAnd who’s coming home on the old ninety five?\n\nWho’s got the feeling to keep him alive\n\nThough havin’ it, sharin’ it ain’t quite the same\n\nIt ain’t no gold nugget you can’t lay a claim\n\nWho’s seeing eyes through the crack in the floor\n\nThere it is baby don’t you worry no more\n\nWho should be sleepin’ but is writing this song\n\nWishin’ and a-hopin’ he weren’t so damned wrong\n\nWho’s saying baby, that don’t mean a thing\n\n‘Cause nowadays Clancy can’t even sing\n\nWho’s saying baby that don’t mean a thing\n\n‘Cause nowadays Clancy can’t even sing\n\nA few days ago this song has come up in conversation with a friend of mine. We talked about it and then my friend Dave from A Sound Day posted about it a few days later.\n\nI love the power of the song and I’ve learned it on guitar but as a southern person… I think Neil generalized too much. Even Neil thinks that now. His quote on the song now is “I don’t like my words when I listen to it. They are accusatory and condescending, not fully thought out, and too easy to misconstrue.” Are there people like that in the world? Certainly but they are not all located in the south.\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd replied to this song with their biggest hit Sweet Home Alabama. Neil was quite happy with “Sweet Home Alabama.” He said, “They play like they mean it, I’m proud to have my name in a song like theirs.”\n\nYoung is mentioned in the line “I hope Neil Young will remember, a Southern man don’t need him around anyhow.” Lynyrd Skynyrd were big fans of Young. “Sweet Home Alabama” was meant as a good-natured answer to this, explaining the good things about Alabama. Skynyrd lead singer Ronnie Van Zandt often wore Neil Young T-shirts while performing and he was thinking of covering a Young song called Powderfinger before his death in the crash.\n\nThe song was on “After the Gold Rush” released in 1970.\n\nNeil Young: “Oh, they didn’t really put me down! But then again, maybe they did! (laughs) But not in a way that matters. S–t, I think ‘Sweet Home Alabama’ is a great song. I’ve actually performed it live a couple of times myself.”\n\nFrom Songfacts\n\nIn the liner notes for his greatest hits album Decade, Young wrote: “This song could have been written on a civil rights march after stopping off to watch Gone With The Wind at a local theater.”\n\nYoung was backed by his band Crazy Horse on this track:\n\nDanny Whitten – guitar\n\nJack Nitzsche – piano\n\nNils Lofgren – guitar\n\nBilly Talbot – bass\n\nRalph Molina – drums\n\nNils Lofgren, a guitarist by trade, played piano on this song, an instrument he never played before After The Gold Rush. Young tasked Lofgren with playing piano as a “special trial,” according to Jimmy McDonough’s Shakey.\n\nIn trying to get the piano down, Lofgren tapped into his background with accordion. “I used to be an accordion player, and accordion’s all ‘oompah oompah,'” he said. “So I started doin’ the accordion thing on piano.”\n\nTo Lofgren’s surprise, Young loved it.\n\n“That’s the sound I was looking for,” Young said. “I didn’t want to hear a bunch of f–kin’ licks. I don’t like musicians playing licks.”\n\nDirector Jonathan Demme first cut the opening sequence of his movie Philadelphia to this song in an effort to get Young to write a song like it for the film. Young gave him “Philadelphia,” which he used over the end. Bruce Springsteen’s contribution, “Streets Of Philadelphia,” was used over the open.\n\nYoung was married to his first wife, Susan Acevedo, when he wrote this song in his Topanga Canyon studio. They were not getting along, and Young’s foul mood translated into this track, which he described as “an angry song.”\n\nRandy Newman felt that “Southern Man” was one of Young’s least interesting songs. “‘Southern Man,’ ‘Alabama’ are a little misguided,” he said. “It’s too easy a target. I don’t think he knows enough about it.”\n\nDuring a filmed performance of this song at London’s Hammersmith Odeon, Crazy Horse’s Billy Talbot and Frank “Poncho” Sampredro dropped acid. “I can vividly remember ‘Southern Man,'” Sampredro’s said in Shakey. “It was wildly out of control – fast, slow, up, down, everywhere. At the end we were singing, I had my eyes closed and I hear this little tiny voice and I turn around and it was just me. Everybody else had quit even playing.”\n\nSouthern Man\n\nSouthern man, better keep your head.\n\nDon’t forget what your good book said.\n\nSouthern change gonna come at last.\n\nNow your crosses are burning fast.\n\nSouthern man.\n\nI saw cotton and I saw black.\n\nTall white mansions and little shacks.\n\nSouthern man, when will you pay them back?\n\nI heard screamin’ and bullwhips cracking.\n\nHow long? How long?\n\nSouthern man, better keep your head.\n\nDon’t forget what your good book said.\n\nSouthern change gonna come at last.\n\nNow your crosses are burning fast.\n\nSouthern man.\n\nLily Belle, your hair is golden brown.\n\nI’ve seen your black man comin’ round.\n\nSwear by God, I’m gonna cut him down!\n\nI heard screamin’ and bullwhips cracking.\n\nHow long? How long?\n\nNow we continue our quest of famous guitars and the artists cherish them… Here was Part 1 and Part 2.\n\nBruce Springsteen and Neil Young’s guitars\n\nBruce Springsteen’s Guitar\n\nBruce has stuck with this guitar from the first album until now. You see this guitar on his Born to Run album. When I saw him in 2000 he was playing it. Bruce bought this in 1972 in Phil Petillo’s Neptune New Jersey guitar shop for $185. Now the guitar is said to be worth between $1 million and $5 million…pretty good investment Bruce!\n\nThe guitar is a composite assembled from parts from at least two other Fender guitars. The bolt-on neck dates from a 1950s Fender Esquire guitar. The Esquire decal on the headstock indicates that the neck came from the single-pickup variant of Fender’s more-popular two-pickup Telecaster. The body is a 1950’s Telecaster\n\nThe guitar had been originally owned by a record company and was part of the payola scams of the 1960s. It was rigged with four pickups wired into extra jacks that would each plug into a separate channel on the recording console.\n\nPetillo removed the extra pickups and returned the guitar to original Telecaster shape before he sold it Springsteen, but a huge side effect of the routing was that the Tele was now really light, giving it a sound a feel unlike any other.\n\nBruce had Peillo modify it over the years. He added his triangular Precision Frets, a six saddle titanium bridge, and custom hot-wound waterproofed pickups and electronics so they could better survive a sweat-soaked 4 hour show.\n\nBruce has now retired the Esquire from road duty, so these days Springsteen plays clones on stage, but still records with the original.\n\nNeil Young’s “Old Black”\n\nNeil Young is known mostly as a singer songwriter but he is a hell of a guitar player. He is one of my favorite rock guitarists. He doesn’t play lightning quick and that is a good thing…it’s playing with feel that many guitar players forget about.\n\nNeil Young acquired Old Black in 1968 through a trade with Buffalo Springfield member Jim Messina, who traded Old Black for one of Young’s orange Gretsch guitars (Gretsch 6120 Chet Atkins).\n\nThe guitar made a humming sound so he dropped it off at a guitar shop in LA. When he came back, the shop had closed for good and lost one of the pickups. To replace the lost pickup, Neil added a Gretsh pickup that didn’t quite sound the way he wanted, but it stayed that way until Larry Cragg found an old Firebird pickup and installed it. Then Old Black was restored to its former glory and that Firebird pickup is still installed on the guitar today. It was roughly resprayed to jet black, and received a new Tune-o-matic bridge (not available when the guitar was produced) and a B-7 model Bigsby vibrato tailpiece.\n\nThe neck pickup has always been the original P-90 pickup, but it is covered by a metal P-90 cover. Neil is still playing Old Black to this day and he said he will until he dies.\n\n…\n\nNeil wrote “Long May You Run” in tribute to Mort, his old 1948 Buck Roadmaster hearse.\n\nNeil Young and his band The Squires posing with his hearse Mort (a 1948 Buick Roadmaster hearse Neil had nicknamed Mortimer Hearseburg) in Winnipeg, Manitoba in April 1965\n\n“It had rollers for the coffin in the back, so we just rolled our our amps in and out. It was like they built it for us” The hearse broke down in Blind River in 1965 where Neil refused to abandon the hearse for two days until he finally gave up.\n\nHe soon bought another hearse, Mort Two, which Stephen Stills spotted him driving in Los Angeles in 1966 when Buffalo Springfield was formed.\n\nNeil would later pay tribute to the original Mort in his song Long May You Run, the title track of The Stills-Young Band album. The album was released in 1976 and peaked at #26 in the Billboard Album Charts, #26 in Canada, and #12 in the UK.\n\nNeil and Stephen Stills toured on this album and Mr. Young decided to leave tour abruptly. He did leave Stills a note: “Dear Stephen, funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach. Neil.”\n\nThe song charted in 1993 from MTV’s Unplugged…it peaked at #34 in the Mainstream Rock Song charts and #28 in Canada.\n\nFrom Songfacts\n\nNeil was in Canada driving to Sudbury when ‘Mort’ broke down in Blind River, June 1965. (Which is contradictory to the lyrics; “well it was back in Blind River, in 1962, when I last saw you alive”).\n\nIn 1976, Stephen Stills and Neil Young formed The Stills-Young Band and released an album called Long May You Run, which turned out to be somewhat ironic when the collaboration quickly stalled.\n\nStills and Young wrote separately for the album, which Stephen contributing four songs, and Young adding five, including the title track.\n\nStills is a longtime collaborator of Neil’s, having worked with him first in Buffalo Springfield and then in Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. However, they had a falling out only nine days into the Long May You Run tour. Young decided to abandon the project, leaving Stills with a mere telegram to explain his departure. It read: “Dear Stephen, funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach. Neil.”\n\nIn addition to Young’s compilation album Decade this also appears on his 1993 album Unplugged.\n\nThe last ever Tonight Show with Conan O’Brien on Friday January 22, 2010 finished in style when O’Brien’s final musical guest, Neil Young, performed this song in what appeared to be a poke at NBC. O’Brien had been asked to move his slot to 12:05 a.m., and the TV host refused to move his show to such a late hour, and instead negotiated a $45 million exit deal.\n\nNeil Young performed this song at the Closing Ceremonies of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games to a rousing ovation of Canadian audience members.\n\nLong May You Run\n\nWe’ve been through some things together\n\nWith trunks of memories still to come\n\nWe found things to do in stormy weather\n\nLong may you run.\n\nLong may you run.\n\nLong may you run.\n\nAlthough these changes have come\n\nWith your chrome heart shining in the sun\n\nLong may you run.\n\nWell, it was back in Blind River in 1962\n\nWhen I last saw you alive\n\nBut we missed that shift on the long decline\n\nLong may you run.\n\nLong may you run.\n\nLong may you run.\n\nAlthough these changes have come\n\nWith your chrome heart shining in the sun\n\nLong may you run.\n\nMaybe The Beach Boys have got you now\n\nWith those waves singing “Caroline”\n\nRollin’ down that empty ocean road\n\nGettin’ to the surf on time.\n\nLong may you run.\n\nLong may you run.\n\nAlthough these changes have come\n\nWith your chrome heart shining in the sun\n\nLong may you run."
