        "text": "When playing in Toronto’s legendary venue Massey Hall, it’s only appropriate to pay tribute to one of the artists who turned out one of its most legendary performances, Neil Young.\n\nDuring The War on Drugs two-night stint in Toronto, the band covered Neil Young’s “Like A Hurricane” from the 1977 album American Stars ‘n Bars. The performance was captured on camera by a luckly concert-goer. Watch the performance below."
