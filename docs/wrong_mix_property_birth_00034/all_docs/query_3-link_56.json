        "text": "You might be wondering why I picked out the old LH Labs Geek Out V2 DAC as a comparison device for these last couple of posts. Well, it's also a USB-dongle headphone DAC, and the MSRP when new (~US$250) was about the same as the Cayin last week. Also, this allows us to be reminded about the idea of crowdfunding and audio!\n\nThe other day I was reminded of the company while reading through this unfortunate \"Light Harmonic (LH Labs). Scam? USD$6 million not delivered since 2014\" forum thread. I can reminisce of a time just before 2015 when crowdfunding was seen by some in the audiophile press as a possible \"future\" for the audio industry. Larry Ho and Gavin Fish back in the day being mouthpieces of this movement - \"How Indegogo Will Help Save an Old Dying Industry\". Not only Stereophile, but guys from The Absolute Sound also perpetuated the news around the hype.\n\nEvidently, this salvation for an \"old dying industry\" was not to be. As you can see in the long-running forum thread started in 2017, it looks like folks have been awaiting delivery on a number of \"paid\" items from LH Labs. At this point, chances are slim that there will be any kind of product to show for the money spent by many unfortunate customers. I think from the start, many had questions about whether this kind of funding model would work for a majority of projects. In reviewing my preview to the Geek Out V2 back in 2015, I think I showed appropriate skepticism. Human psychology being what it is, unless you're dealing with really good people completely up front whether the venture leads to success or failure, the bias does tend to be for behaviours that favour greed and an attempt at ego preservation.\n\nWhile I don't think failure/success rates have been fully published, estimates are that for Indegogo, success rate is \"between 17-18%\". With those kinds of odds, obviously if you're a prospective buyer, make sure to be mindful of the reputation of the folks making the sales pitch and that you're willing to part with whatever dollars you'll send their way. It's one thing to send a few bucks for a unique product, but once it gets into 3 or 4 (or 5!?) figures, better make sure to do your due diligence! I'm curious, in the years since, have we seen Stereophile or TAS write anything to follow-up on the crowdfunding movement or ever warned consumers about this kind of business model? If not, why not? As usual, it's worth wondering if the \"mainstream\" audiophile media holds much allegiance to consumer interests as opposed to those of the Industry.\n\nIf we look at the Indegogo page on products like the LH Labs Geek Pulse and Geek Wave, we see that the company has sent out updates here and there over the years, apparently stringing along the idea that work is being done (for example, for the Geek Wave, they posted a few pictures up to Jan 2, 2021). Then there are the thousands of comments by folks who feel \"ripped off\".\n\nClearly, Larry Ho and Gavin Fish were not exactly the most reputable of folks to be entrusted with millions of dollars; who knows where the dollars went. Funny reading this article about Ho on \"serial\" entrepreneurship from 2015 in an Asian news site. Sure, taking risks and promising all kinds of things will capture \"venture\" dollars a lot of the time... until it doesn't, and shaky schemes collapse.\n\nInexplicably, Larry Ho has become Lawrence Hope these days (as in \"I Hope karma isn't too hard on me.\"), and Gavin Fish turned into some kind of true crime warrior! I dunno, maybe it's some kind of subconscious desire for absolution for sins of the past. You can't make this stuff up, folks!\n\nBy the way, the only other product I purchased which came from crowdfunding was the PonoPlayer. At least with that, which originated from Kickstarter, I respect Neil Young and Ayre for getting the job done and delivering. Of course, I didn't think Young's silly promotion of hi-res audio realistically helped; but that's another story.\n\nAs usual, when we see an audiophile press that's mostly interested in making sales for the Industry (instead of promoting consumer interests), and questions of \"snake oil\" around claims from the \"High End\" particularly, make sure to be wise about spending money on a lot of this stuff.\n\n[Addendum: A terrible article in support of the LH Labs scam model by Lee Scoggins (circa 2014), currently the CEO of the publisher for TAS and Hi-Fi+ as shared on AS.]\n\n--------------------\n\nIn news this week, fascinating what happened to Neil Young in his little spat with Joe Rogan over COVID-19 ending up in Young's music being pulled from Spotify. No need at this point IMO to get into the rights and wrongs of the pandemic, I think too much has already been said in that regard. I think it should be no surprise that this was the outcome for Young's ultimatum. I respect Young's character in standing up for his principles and I see the WHO Chief thanking him. But I think if Young wanted to make a meaningful statement, isn't it a little late given where we're at in the pandemic? Rogan caught COVID in early September 2021 and has already expressed his views for months. Looks like the horse has been \"out of the Barn\" for awhile already. ;-)\n\nSpeaking of Neil Young's activism and posturing, remember back in 2015 Neil Young also removed his music from Spotify? Back in those days it was because of the need for better sound quality. Seriously guys, of all the music and genres, Young's discography does not need hi-res - CD 16/44.1 is more than enough for this stuff IMO. He said back then \"When the quality is back, I’ll give it another look. Never say never.\" He even said: \"I don't need my music to be devalued by the worst quality in the history of broadcasting or any other form of distribution. I don't feel right allowing this to be sold to my fans. It's bad for my music\" on Facebook. Well, even though Spotify never improved its sound quality, Young's music eventually went back on the system by November 2016. And now look at this: Neil Young returns to SiriusXM after pulling music from Spotify. LOL - SiriusXM has some of the worst broadcast sound quality I've ever heard with obvious data compression distortions and EQ (music channels get about 40-64kbps over the air)! Oh well, to be Young and idealistic. ;-)\n\nLook ladies and gents... Like with everything else on the Internet, there's so much misinformation, disinformation, and irrational content that it's simply impossible to \"sanitize\" and \"protect\" the presumably innocent, unsuspecting public at this point in history.\n\nPotential for chaos is the price of free speech and obviously every society, community, person will need to find a threshold of what is acceptable. Sometimes the fantasies we find online are relatively harmless; the fantasies in \"High End\" audio are mostly entertaining. Other times, the fictitious nonsense will cause major troubles. The virulence of COVID-19 obviously has had a huge part to play in creating disharmony in society since each of us will have a different level of tolerance for the risk it poses for ourselves and those around. And so the outcomes for each society and relative emphasis the culture places on \"safety\" and at what costs through the phases of this pandemic are probably predictable in retrospect to a certain extent. Fascinating how various countries have dealt with the challenges and the kinds of resistance citizens have engaged in.\n\nThere will be time enough in the years and decades ahead as we get past this phase in our history for everyone from common folks to academics to study the medical epidemiology, individual psychology, collective behaviour/sociology, media coverage, economics and politics of this pandemic. I would not be surprised if we start seeing a bunch of books by the end of the year retrospectively reviewing \"What just happened?\".\n\nRegardless of all the \"Information Wars\" online, at least in the Western World, I think the underlying solution IMO is still better education. Teaching ourselves, those around us, and the next generations to be better critical thinkers is perhaps the most important job that the educational system, news media, and leaders in all kinds of areas must try to do. Information is cheap, but the skills to be able to extract truth, and the wisdom to develop understanding I think is what's \"priceless\".\n\nAs for censorship, whether it's the idea of banning podcasts, blogs, videos, articles, etc. that some are calling for, society will always have \"fringe groups\" of one sort or another which someone, somewhere will want to suppress. How we set the thresholds of what is \"acceptable\", what should be outlawed, which are \"depraved\", and which are sadly a product of mental illness (even perhaps to be pitied) will simply reflect societal norms and values. As I quoted from Carl Jung on the article about audiophile psychology recently, \"The pendulum of the mind alternates between sense and nonsense, not between right and wrong.\" Let's see how societies around the world find \"sense\" rather than some kind of idealistic morality as we hopefully reach the conclusion of these pandemic perturbations through 2022.\n\nWell, locally here in the Vancouver area, the rate of new Omicron infections has passed a peak, hospital numbers are still high but likely in the midst of dropping, strain on health care resources calming, and death rate should be turning down soon. I think humanity has been on the whole fortunate to have this wave be the relatively lower virulence Omicron strain. I think we can be optimistic for the Spring and Summer 2022.\n\nThrough all this, I hope you're staying healthy and enjoying the music, audiophile friends!\n\n-------------------------\n\nAddendum: January 30, 2022"
