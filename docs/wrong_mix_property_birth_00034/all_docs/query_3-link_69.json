        "text": "Folk rock signer Neil Young will be in San Luis Obispo County on Friday — and he’s ready to sign copies of his new album.\n\nThe Canadian musician will officially release “Before an After,” an acoustic re-recording of 13 songs selected from his decades-long career, on Friday, according to the Associated Press. The 48-minute album includes “I’m the Ocean” from 1995 and “After the Gold Rush” from 1970.\n\nThat day, Young will sign copies of his new album from noon to 3 p.m. at Traffic Records in Atascadero, according to a post on the store’s Instagram.\n\nTraffic Records, located at 5850 Traffic Way, will start album sales at 7 a.m. outside of the store.\n\n“Each patron will receive a wristband at the time of purchase and will be lined up accordingly,” Traffic Records said in the post.\n\nTraffic Records will sell about 300 copies of the album, including LPs, CDs and BluRay DVDs, according to the post.\n\nAll sales are final, and signatures are not guaranteed. Additionally, Young will only sign albums and memorabilia purchased from Traffic Records.\n\n“Patrons will be allowed to take photos during the event, however Young will not be taking pictures with fans individually,” the post said. “Fans will be required to wear a mask when interacting with Young.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Young will have spent time in Atascadero."
