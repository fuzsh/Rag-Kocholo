It is understandable, as the only information on the jacket and inner sleeve besides lyrics and personnel had to do with mixing and mastering (Crystal Sound, Hollywood) and recording (Manta Sound, Toronto). The natural assumption was that the band was Canada’s own, for who outside of Canada would go out of their way to record there? How little we know.\n\nFor three decades I labored under that assumption and only recently was it pointed out to me that Space Opera, that Canadian band which rivaled anything that country had ever produced music-wise, was not from Canada at all but from Fort Worth, Texas. After serving myself up a major headslap, I began to wonder how such misinformation could survive three decades without correction, especially amongst those of us who wear our music on our sleeves, to borrow an old ‘heart’ phrase. Put simply, I asked myself how a band as excellent as Space Opera could remain that far below the radar for that long.\n\nIn the search for that answer, I uncovered a story of a true band of brothers. The four band members forged a bond as strong as that of blood which carried them through three-plus decades of writing and recording, the release of two albums (one major and one independent, released decades apart) and numerous triumphs on various stages. Their run involved names such as Major Bill Smith, Edd Lively, T-Bone Burnett, Kris Kristofferson, The Legendary Stardust Cowboy, Clive Davis and others. Big names. Huge names. But as you read on, you realize that the most important names are their own, individually and collectively.\n\nYou see, these guys were all about the music. Still, few critics really got them and the fans— well, they were loyal, if nothing else, because it was obvious that what mattered to the band, first and foremost, was the music. So here is the heretofore untold story of how and why they made it, mostly in their own words. It wasn’t always easy and sometimes it was a real struggle, but to the four who made it, it was well worth it.\n\nAnd for those who prefer the legend that never was, let us just say that here is the story of Space Opera, the band from Canada’s southernmost province: Texas.\n\nIN THE BEGINNING…\n\n… there was music, and in Texas as early as the thirties and forties and into the fifties and sixties there was more music per square mile than just about anywhere. Sometimes, going from town to town was like crossing borders, the music a reflection of culture as well as locality. Mexican, Oompah, Folk, R&B, Country & Western, Big Band and Swing, Classical, Opera filled the airwaves, and there were even pockets of what they called Tex-Czech music, a hybrid of polka and God knows what else, a style ultimately utilized as background music for many early cartoons. In this instance, the standing joke about Texas— that whatever it was, Texas had more of it and it was bigger and better— held true.\n\nIt is not surprising, then, that when rock & roll came along, it hit Texas like a string of tornadoes and changed the Lone Star landscape forever. Bob Wills may have been The Man, but the kids started having ears for Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison and, later, Bobby Fuller and Sir Douglas and a number of other Texas-based musicians, and when those ears started spending money, most bets were canceled and a new excitement began to build.\n\nIn Fort Worth, Major Bill Smith and Sound City were at the vanguard. Sound City, a four-track studio in the basement of the old KXOL-AM Radio building on West 7th , pumped records onto the local and regional scene with the likes of Bruce Channel (“Hey Baby”), Jill & Ray (better known as Paul & Paula, who struck gold with “Hey Paula”) and J. Frank Wilson & The Cavaliers (“Last Kiss”). Major labels may not have owned the records, but they did own (in a way) the large distribution networks and Major Bill tried his damnedest to take advantage.\n\nSound City itself became a major player in the history of Fort Worth. Besides producing a number of hits and other recordings in virtually all genres, it was the principal sound laboratory for one T-Bone Burnett who, given Sound City’s limited resources, quickly unearthed the secrets of sound.\n\nTHE PLAYERS…\n\nIt is no great stretch to say that Scott Fraser inherited his musical genes from his mother. An accomplished pianist and music teacher, she nurtured Scott in not just music, but in all arts. Indeed, she opened her house to all of Scott’s musical pursuits, including his later forays into what must have seemed to her trained ear the sometimes loud and chaotic mania of rock & roll.\n\nIn Scott’s own words, “I began piano under my mother’s tutelage at age four. I had the use of the finest Steinway upright ever constructed— many piano tuners agreed. It came into my life when I was four and is with me still— my primary and most beloved instrument. I had no interest in the guitar or drums until February of 1964 when I, along with droves of others, was inspired to learn those instruments by the Beatles’ first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.”\n\nHe dove in head first, purchasing a set of drums and a guitar. “The first guitar I purchased was a 12-string acoustic that was made in Mexico. It had a reinforced neck to accommodate steel strings but was difficult to play, at best. As is quite common, that difficulty was an asset, increasing finger strength at a rapid pace.”\n\nIn a very short time, Scott was ready for public exposure.\n\n“The Mods were one of the two working bands at McLean Jr. High. I was playing drums with the other band, The Catalinas, which I had founded. When The Mods’ drummer resigned, I disbanded The Catalinas and joined them. I’m not sure of the date, but there was a talent show at McLean Jr. High which was essentially a battle of the bands involving The Catalinas, The Mods and a folk group called The Journeymen, I believe. Phil and David were two thirds of that folk group and ended up winning the contest.”\n\n“Actually,” corrected Don McGilvray, “the two bands which played at the talent show were the Catalinas and the Continentals. Some of the people from those two bands came together later to form The Mods. In those days, the primary qualification for membership in any group was long hair and access to needed equipment. Virtuosity— or lack thereof— was of no particular concern. The idea was that if you had the right equipment, you could learn, or at least be shown how to play it later.\n\n“Edd Lively’s band at the time was the Continentals. He played lead guitar with Chris Hawkins on drums, Danny Hawkins (no relation) on rhythm guitar and Joe Gracey on bass. The repertoire was exclusively instrumental— well-worn standards such as ‘Wipeout’ and ‘Pipeline’— and they played mainly at private parties. Although Edd lived across the old TCU golf course from me, we didn’t know each other well. In fact, I had just recently moved to Fort Worth and knew hardly anyone, but I knew Scott. He and I were students at McLean where I briefly played drums with him in the school band. He had formed a similar instrumental group (the Catalinas) with himself on drums, Carey Blackwell on rhythm guitar, Ronnie Rambo on lead and Bruce Baughman on bass. I went to a rehearsal for the Catalinas one afternoon and auditioned on a lark. They took me in on the spot and we got our act together for the assembly, playing covers of the then-current ‘Mrs. Brown’ (Herman’s Hermits), ‘Tambourine Man’ (The Byrds) and ‘Just a Little’ (Beau Brummels). The Continentals had been planning on an all-instrumental show and considered themselves a cut above the Catalinas, but we spooked them with the vocals and won that battle of the bands. Shortly thereafter, Scott and I were invited to join a new group being formed by Edd Lively. Rick Finley had a fine new Fender bass and amplifier and his equipment, along with his long hair, qualified him as the new bass player. Joe Gracey was a fine musician, but his parents wouldn’t let him grow his hair.\n\n“We were all fanatically obsessed with the Beatles and we devoured every newspaper or magazine article we could find. The British press wrote about ‘the mods’ and ‘the rockers’ in England and the Beatles were identified as ‘mods’, so we took that name as an homage to them.”\n\n“The folk group I was in with Phil White,” added Bullock, “was The Landsmen. And we weren’t really pitted against The Catalinas (in the talent show) because there were separate categories for folk and rock groups. At that time, we were all just mimicking what we heard on the records we liked, anyway.”\n\nWhereas The Beatles provided the spark for Fraser, Bullock leaned toward folk from the beginning. “I loved pop music,” he said, “but the commercial folk that became popular in the early sixties attracted me with its nice vocal harmonies, variety of acoustic instruments and more serious lyrical content. Plus, you didn’t need to plug anything in, just get some guitars and a group of ‘folks’ and sing the songs. More than anything, I loved to harmonize. My turning point was around 1965 with the one-two punch of ‘Rubber Soul’ and ‘Mr. Tambourine Man’, The Byrds first album. I heard my future in those records.”\n\nWhile Bullock, Fraser and White knew one another in junior high, Bullock was to take a round-about path to rock. While Bullock journeyed, Fraser rocked and White kept options open.\n\nWhen Fraser joined The Mods, his musicianship took on new dimension. Not only was his drumming solid, his skills on a variety of instruments plus an insatiable curiosity when it came to music made him a natural songwriting partner for Edd Lively, the band’s lead guitarist. Fraser was quick to give Lively credit. “All songs were straight collaborations,” he said, “True give and take.” By the time The Mods headed to Sound City, they consisted of those two plus Danny Hawkins (guitar), Rick Finley (bass) and Don McGilvray (lead vocals).\n\n“The first time we (The Mods) recorded anything at Sound City, the booking was arranged and paid for by Caswell Overton Edwards III (CEE THREE),” according to McGilvray. “Cass was a classmate of ours at R. L. Paschal High School and was apparently heir to a considerable family fortune. As I heard it, his grandfather had owned a big ranch on the SW side of Fort Worth and they had sold large tracts of it to build some very posh subdivisions. Cass liked the music scene and, like the rest of us, dreamed of making that one big hit record that would launch our careers. He was our manager and financier and through his good offices, we recorded our one and only debut and farewell single. I remember telling Scott and Edd, as they were teaching us ‘Days Mind the Time’, that I really liked the music— especially the guitar riff— but didn’t get the meaning of the title phrase and thought it a bit hokey and thought we should change it. They seemed to take offense at my criticism and adamantly refused, saying it was an abstract statement.\n\n“The technical engineer on those sessions was a man by the name of Phil York. Phil was a quiet man with patient, willing temperament. He was, as I recall, the only engineer I ever saw working there and I assume he was the technical hand on all the hit records to come out of the place in the late sixties and early seventies and that he taught T-Bone how to run the equipment. I never saw Phil again after my time at Sound City, but I later noticed his name as engineer on Willie Nelson’s Redheaded Stranger.\n\n“I could be wrong, but as I remember it, there were two separate analog two-track tape machines rather than one four-track. We would ‘mix down’ the tracks from one machine to the other and then overdub new tracks. We also made liberal use of reverb to hide the defects in the vocals. When I listen to those old songs, all I can focus on is the thinness of the vocals, swimming in reverb.”\n\nThe single was issued in June of ’65. Drummer Fraser made up an arrangement and harmonies for the rest of the band from the piano chart in a Beatles’ songbook for the Lennon-McCartney number “It’s For You” without ever hearing the actual song.\n\n“It was from a Beatles’ songbook,” confirmed Fraser, “and was not difficult (to do) once certain decisions had been made. The Beatles had not recorded the song and I had not heard the Cilla Black recording (incredibly, I heard it for the first time two years ago in 2003), so the arrangement process involved an attempt to guess what the song was like in its original state. I don’t have that songbook, something I deeply regret, but it seems that the song was in E-Flat. Of course, the Beatles would probably not have written it on guitar in E-Flat except by way of using a capo, but all the published songs at that time were in the wrong key. They were being transcribed by pianists for pianists and that goal was better served by transposition in most cases. So the first thing I did was to transpose into D-Minor, where the descending chord pattern of the verse would be easily realized on guitar. I incorporated a finger-picking pattern instead of a strum and the rest was easy.”\n\n“Fraser found the song and arranged it and literally taught everybody in the band his part,” said Lively, “then sat down and played drums. It was ridiculous.”\n\nCass Edwards remembered the hoops he had to jump through to even get it recorded. “It took some digging to find Lennon/McCartney’s publisher in 1965, but after many transatlantic phone calls, we secured permission to record ‘It’s For You.’ I am not sure they really believed that some sixteen year old kid from Fort Worth was serious.”\n\nGetting the record to the public was another matter.\n\n“Days Mind the Time” did garner a lot of airplay for the band, thanks largely to KFJZ deejays Mark Stevens (Mark E. Baby) and Randy Robins (The Big R), although a rift over booking almost ended it. Not long after the 45 hit the KFJZ charts, Stevens grabbed them for his popular Teen A-Go-Go club on Fort Worth’s westside.\n\n“Stevens actually put us on the map,” said Lively. “We tried out for Teen A-Go-Go. There were three A-Go-Gos owned by a couple of shysters named the Beard brothers who, not unlike other shysters of the time, may have been shysters on the surface but had a lot to do with funding the arts and music and so forth. When we went to audition, there was Mark Stevens sitting there, big as life. The Five Americans were there, too, decked out in Beatles suits, and a few other established bands as well, all there to check out the new groups to make sure there was nobody there to dethrone them.”\n\nThere was little chance of dethroning The Five Americans, who became mainstays on AM radio for the next few years, but The Mods tried.\n\n“Thanks to our genius and illustrious leader— well, kind of leader— Scott Fraser,” continued Lively, “we opened with ‘Nowhere Man’ before you could even purchase it. It was on the radio, but while it played it would say ‘KXOL exclusive’ every few bars so that no one could reuse it on the air. Scott had the smarts to learn it and teach it to the band, and he was only the drummer! I think we followed that with ’19th Nervous Breakdown’ and, needless to say, we got the gig.”\n\n“Teen-A-Go-Go was Bohemia on the prairie,” said Fraser, “vibrant, very progressive. Similar ‘teen scenes’ were exploding in cities across the U.S. And they were fundamental in the creation of the social fabric of today. Mark Stevens… had the biggest show in Fort Worth, in the clubs and on the radio.\n\n“There were the three main venues— Teen A-Go-Go, Action a-Go-Go and Holiday A-Go-Go. Stevens, the drive-time deejay, was the host of Teen A-Go-Go. Randy Robins, the nighttime deejay, hosted Holiday A-Go-Go, and I can’t recall the deejay at Action A-Go-Go, although I think Stevens and Robins would occasionally host there as well. For reasons that still remain obscure, Stevens and Robins were at odds. We had played a few gigs at Teen A-Go-Go and our record was beginning to take off. Robins asked us to play Holiday and we accepted. The next day, we were called to Stevens’ apartment and were told that we would have to cancel the Robins gig or we would never play Teen A-Go-Go again. We were shocked, and at age 14 or 15 not at all ready for such eccentric adult behavior. Teen A-Go-Go was the premier gig, second to none. Losing that venue would have been professionally devastating. We decided to go see Randy Robins. Anyone who remembers that time can attest to the fact that Robins was a man far ahead— the coolest of the batch, by far. Without explaining what had precipitated this schism between himself and Stevens, Robins made an impassioned plea for us to work his gig because there were many kids in town who could not afford the much higher price of a Teen A-Go-Go ticket and that it was unfair for all the big bands to work only for Stevens, that all the kids deserved to hear the good bands.\n\n“Understand, Robins’ gigs paid less than Stevens’, but in a moment of juvenile clarity, we sided with Robins. He was charismatic and most convincing. That weekend, we played Holiday knowing that Stevens had canceled our future ‘Teen’ bookings.\n\n“Over the next few weeks, thanks to intense activity by The Mods Fan Club created by a genius named Talona Phelps and far and away the best organized, most numerous and most dedicated fan club in town, our record became the most requested at KFJZ. Using that leverage and passion for justice we never knew we had, we convinced Stevens to a truce. From that point on, all bands were free to play all venues. Not a small victory for the very young and one that shaped an attitude that only grew more militant as time progressed.”\n\nThe genius behind the fan club had started it for very personal reasons. “The Mods were one of the first bands around here that showed promise and were original,” explained Talona. “They were eager to learn Beatles songs (and others which graced radio in those days) and were determined to get every note and harmony exactly right (having been in choir myself throughout high school, I was a sucker for their wonderful harmonies). My purpose in starting the fan club was to keep The Mods closer to home, entertaining us in our local teen clubs, as most kids from 14 to 16 did not own cars. The big plus was that, due to all of the phone calls made passing along information about gigs and the like, it got me my own phone line, long before most kids had their own phones. And it was a great way to meet people outside of our own schools.” She did, indeed, meet The Mods, who all went to a different school.\n\n“You have to realize,” she continued, “that back in the sixties, there weren’t many places for minors to go, so when Teen-A-Go-Go opened up at the Round Up Inn (part of the Will Rogers Complex), it was a big thing for us to go every Friday night. I went to a country school that was totally shit-kickers (our term for cowboy) and it was a real drag for the half-dozen of us who were all about the music and the bands.”\n\nCampbell and Harrison, in their version, listed the clubs as Teen A-Go-Go and Peppermint A-Go-Go with mention of two other clubs, Action A-Go-Go and Panther A-Go-Go, though their versions of the story were similar in all other aspects. “Shortly afterwards,” they wrote, “local independent station KTVT, Channel 11, started televising ‘Panther A-Go-Go’ and suddenly The Mods were on TV every Saturday night, along with Johnny Green and the Green Men.”\n\nFraser remembers ‘Panther’ being TV only. “As I remember, ‘Panther A-Go-Go’ was strictly TV,” he emphasized. “Very, very hot lights. It was filmed at Panther Hall, a now demolished but venerable facility with an extraordinary history.”\n\nThe TV exposure did a lot to help the band, but it wasn’t long before the shine started to come off the apple. After hitting #1 on the KFJZ charts and #13 on KXOL (“That was a high number for a local band in those days,” commented Lively. “Thirteen is #1 in the grand scheme of things for some zit-faced, as John Carrick so eloquently put it, kids”), The Mods as a recording group took second to the in-demand live band. After numerous gigs and the weekly TV slot began to take a toll, the direction of the band shifted. McGilvray and Hawkins left and the remaining members took to Sound City with Cass Edwards, searching for a possible followup to “Days Mind the Time”, although they did play live on occasion.\n\n“The Mods stayed together through about ’68,” according to McGilvray. “I left sometime in late ’67 or early ’68. During the time we were together, we all improved our chops considerably, especially Edd and Scott. Our sound became tight and we could pretty much nail any song we wanted to cover. I particularly recall recording the advance radio promo play of new Beatles releases and then performing them live at dance venues before they were available in record stores. That little parlor trick got a lot of buzz around the Metroplex and added to our reputations.\n\n“My reasons for leaving were strictly personal,” he went on. “It had nothing to do with not liking the players or the music. Rather, it was the milieu. I needed to work and I needed to have a clear head and the places we were playing and hanging out in were thick with drugs and booze. I saw myself headed in a dangerous (for me, at least) direction. I felt the need to leave that whole scene for my own survival. And, to be candid, I didn’t consider myself to be a true artist. I thought of myself as having the technical ability to perform, but I wasn’t really original or creative. I was only copying other peoples’ work. I had the urge to perform and I thought it would be cool to be a ‘star’, but I didn’t have the fire or the commitment to that life. The others in the group took it as abandoning them and I was pretty much ostracized as a result.\n\n“I continued to play music and perform occasionally, but I felt better away from the ancillary ‘stuff’. Of course, leaving The Mods didn’t entirely free me from my personal demons. I had already begun a ‘romance’ with booze that lasted for another 23 years— and eventually caused me considerable grief— before I called it quits for good in 1991.\n\n“Now, T-Bone Burnett (or Terry, as I knew him originally) was a few years older than myself,” he went on, “and while he had been around the Fort Worth music scene before I came to town, we never ran in the same circles. Perhaps he had been away to college… I really don’t know. He lived with his Dad on the opposite side of the TCU golf course from Edd, and we attended the same Episcopal church. He had formed a band called The Loose Ends which performed mainly at fraternity parties, if I recall correctly. They had already disbanded when I met him and he was working as an A&R man for an R&B producer named Charles Stuart, who had leased Sound City outright. Stuart had had decent success with an R&B group called Rondalis Tandy & the Van Dykes. Their hit, ‘No Man Is an Island’, went to the Top Ten on Billboard’s R&B charts, and Stuart hoped to parlay that success into the big time. T-Bone recruited me and I signed a recording contract with Stuart’s company. We recorded under the name Loose Ends, with Terry going by the name of Jon T. Bone and I by the name of Geoffrey Chaucer. We recorded several songs from T-Bone’s catalog, including ‘Dead End Kid’ and ‘A Street in Paris’, none of which was ever released, to my knowledge.”\n\n“The Mods fell apart and I was there to join at the beginning of something new,” Bullock said. “Scott and Edd probably realized at the time that the name The Mods was outdated and we did play together at clubs, but no longer under that name.”\n\nBullock joined the guys in the studio as well. “The song I remember recording was a Fraser-Lively song called ‘Shoes For Sale’. It was an acoustic folk rock tune that would have fit pretty well on the Whistler, Chaucer album that we recorded a year or so later. Phil York engineered that session and Cass produced. Nothing from that period was ever released and only a couple of acetates exist.”\n\n“(There was) no split up,” Fraser said, “just a morph into the Whistler, Chaucer, Detroit and Greenhill configuration. The last recording session of The Mods featured Fraser, Lively, Bullock and Phil White, who had joined us toward the last. (T-Bone) Burnett came later, right before John Carrick joined the fun. T-Bone and I had known one another since 1962 and grew up in the same neighborhood, but didn’t have musical contact until WCD&G began.” In a moment of wistful memory, he added, “I have only great memories of working with T-Bone. We were kids in a candy shop. I am most thankful for that time.”\n\nKids in a candy shop, indeed, a thought also shared by Bullock and White. Things were changing quickly and Burnett a key player in the midst of it all.\n\nIn addition, the Space Opera acorn was planted about that time: the first “let’s start a band” talk between Fraser, Bullock and White. “Dave and Phil had improved the approach to harmony on some song The Mods played,” Cass Edwards recalled. “Scott concurred on the improvement and after that, those three were never far apart in friendship or music.”\n\nCHAPTER TWO: Houston, We Have a Party (and later, a problem…)\n\nWhile the members of The Mods were barely beginning to make noise, John Carrick had already established himself in the large and vibrant folk music scene of Houston.\n\n“I was in what started out to be a Peter, Paul & Mary/Kingston Trio/Limeliters kind of folk group called The Balladeers,” he said. “We were lucky enough to discover where the successful commercial groups’ music was coming from. We found the old Jewish Community Center in Houston, where they had a folklore society which included a couple of cats who had been blacklisted, some old beatniks and labor activists. It was there that we discovered old blues and English ballads and Appalachian music and bluegrass in its real traditional form, or second-generation traditional, and we started doing that. We recorded and won some awards, but we were just high school kids, playing every weekend and making some money.”\n\nWhile the money was good, the deterioration of the folk scene and the end of high school forced some changes.\n\n“I went into the Marines right out of high school,” Carrick continued. “Before I’d gone in, around 1965, my mom and I started the Sand Mountain Coffeehouse. The Beatles had hit and the folk music thing was on the wane, but folk music was what I knew how to do and it was a very important part of my young life. My mom looked at it and said, well, there are still enough people who want to hear this, so we opened the coffeehouse.\n\n“We hired the people I’d grown up playing with like Jerry Jeff Walker, Guy Clark, Townes Van Zandt, B.W. Stevenson, Johnny Winter and Janis Joplin. I mean, the number of people who played there who later became famous is enormous. Partly because the same thing was happening all over the country, coffeehouses closing down and folk musicians having nowhere to play. People would pass through and stay for three, four, five months because we had kind of a scene here. Long before Austin.”\n\nDavid Bullock, in Houston during that time, found the place and practically moved in.\n\n“My parents divorced when I was fourteen,” he said, “and my mother remarried and moved to Houston while I remained in Fort Worth with my dad. At the end of the ninth grade, however, having played guitar for about a year, I wanted to explore greener pastures. I knew Houston had a big folk scene and there was more opportunity there for me to improve and explore. Plus, I was tired of playing the ‘commercial’ folk music we’d been doing. By then, I was listening to Dylan, Leadbelly, Snaker Ray and the more interesting melodic groups like Ian & Sylvia. My first year of high school, I lived in Houston and teamed up with a classmate named Joe Johnson. We auditioned for Carrick at Sand Mountain and he gave us a chance to play.”\n\n“This kid showed up one night,” said Carrick, “who was substantially younger than me— or it seemed substantial at the time— somewhere around three to five years. David Bullock. David was a good guitar player, had a real touch on the harmonica and had an incredibly unique voice, a voice so pleasing that it would grab you. He started coming around and playing mostly open mike nights and support spots.”\n\n“I pretty much spent every weekend down there for a year and a half,” added Bullock, “either playing or listening to others. In addition to playing with Joe, I also played solo and played in a great jug band.\n\n“When Jerry Jeff Walker arrived on the scene, I sometimes backed him on harmonica, or on spoons for a new song he’d written called ‘Mr. Bojangles’. Jerry Jeff and Gary White formed a rock group around that time called The Lost Sea Dreamers, later known as Circus Maximus when they moved to New York. They recorded an album for Vanguard Records.\n\n“It was a time when musicians of all different stripes— folk, blues, bluegrass— would get together informally and just play for fun. I remember drinking wine and playing blues all night with Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark at Guy’s house.\n\n“There was a very interesting character named Frank Davis,” he mused, “a musician and recording engineer at Walt Andrus’ studio, Andrus Sound, a nice studio co-owned by Andrus and Leland Rogers (Kenny Rogers’ brother). Frank engineered the second 13th Floor Elevators record, among others, and also created an amazing musique concrete album called Metamorphosis. He had a house in the Montrose area in Houston, a neighborhood where most of the folkies, beats, SDS radicals and, later, hippies lived. He recorded the first session I ever played on, in March of 1966, with the Garden of Joy Jug Band. We recorded a cool version of Leadbelly’s ‘Death of Jean Harlow’ (Scott, Phil and I later did a Byrdsy version of that at Sound City with T-Bone). Joe Johnson, Carolyn Terry and I, all members of Garden of Joy, hung out a lot at Frank’s house. As I said, Joe Johnson played in the duo with me at Sand Mountain, and Carolyn Terry was a University of Houston student, a folksinger and a radio show host. After hearing our jug band, Frank decided we should do a side project, a folk-rock Lovin’ Spoonful kind of thing. We rehearsed in his living room. The band was myself, Carolyn Terry, Joe Johnson, Frank, and Johnny Winter, who later became deservedly famous for his blues singing and guitar playing. We never got to the performing stage for some reason, but it was fun exploring together in rehearsals.\n\n“As I was by far the youngest member of the Houston folk scene, I was kind of taken under the wings of the older guys and had a chance to hear established musicians play around Houston, such as Lightnin’ Hopkins, Mance Lipscomb and Doc Watson.”\n\nBullock returned to Fort Worth the Fall of ’66 and immediately tied up with Fraser and Lively who, still as The Mods, were laying down tracks for Cass Edwards at Sound City. During Spring Break of that school year, he took a trip to Houston with Phil White and introduced him to Carrick. White liked what he saw. When the school year ended, White, Fraser and Lively moved to Houston, independent of Bullock, who had also returned there for the summer.\n\nWhile White said they quit school, the others denied it going that far for themselves. Bullock does remember them re-enrolling when school started again that next Fall.\n\n“We put that band together because we quit school,” White argued. “At that time, you didn’t quit high school unless you were a minority or a pregnant chick. The whole thing was that if you didn’t finish school, you would simply, like, explode. But, in fact, we quit high school. We left the same day, in my car, and made a pilgrimage to Houston where we hooked up with Carrick.”\n\n“I’m at the club one evening,” Carrick laughed, “and three guys show up, and we’re talking gawky, zit-faced teenagers. They came in and introduced themselves and said that David had told them to come in and talk to me, that they had a recording deal and they wanted me to come to Fort Worth to make an album with them. Supposedly, they had gotten something going with T-Bone Burnett up at Sound City Studio and they didn’t have what they really felt was a lead vocalist. David told them to come get me, though I don’t know why, exactly. I’m going yeah, yeah, sure. And they’re saying, aw, c’mon, but I’m not buying it. Finally they say, okay, let’s do this. Let us play for you. We have all of our stuff out in the car and you have a P.A. I said, okay, after we close the club tonight, you guys can set up and play for me, and I’m just kind of doing this because I’m doing it, you know.\n\n“I remember they were traveling in wheels wired together— a ’55 four-door Chevy, but wired together. They come in and set up their stuff and the club is closed and they start playing and in less than ten minutes, I’m saying what the f**k am I doing? I’m getting ready to move to Fort Worth with a bunch of gawky, zit-faced teenagers! These guys were just brilliant! It wasn’t like you could see the potential. It was already there! They had incredible musical skill, every one of them. And the songs were great. Way beyond their years.”\n\nFraser remembered that summer fondly. “I met John for the first time at John’s apartment at the Sand Mountain Coffeehouse,” he said. “Phil, Edd and I arrived, we exchanged pleasantries and repaired downstairs to the club where John was to perform. He was absolutely great. Sand Mountain was home to Jerry Jeff Walker, Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark, but the wonderful summer I spent there, the two best sets I heard were by Messrs. Carrick and Bullock (who had returned there to play solo).\n\n“At first, we lived upstairs at Sand Mountain, playing at night and rehearsing and sleeping during the day. Later, we moved into a stunning house we called The Castle. I went to school on folk music that summer and it was an invaluable education. I really enjoyed working with John.”\n\n“I remember being at that house,” said Bullock, “this odd little Victorian house. They played me a tape they had recorded of ‘House of Collection’ and ‘Day of Childhood’. At that time, Carrick suggested that I rejoin them. He said, ‘Your voice and mine together would sound like silver honey.’ I was flattered and the music was so good that I thought I might join them. I spent the rest of the summer playing on my own, but did rejoin the band when we were all back in Fort Worth.”\n\nThose gawky teenagers spent that summer in Houston and formed a band with Carrick and whatever drummer they could find at the moment. For John Carrick, a traditional folkie, it was pure spiritual enlightenment.\n\n“They were just as pure teenagers as they could be,” he said, “and they happened to be f**king geniuses, okay? When we went out to play, we played Byrds songs. The Byrds were our gods. I had followed Roger McGuinn from the folk scene into rock & roll and they had just discovered The Byrds and thought they were the most brilliant band in the world. So our life was scheduled around the occasional appearance of The Byrds on the Johnny Carson Show or the Ed Sullivan Show or whatever, and the new Byrds single or album. We played a lot of Beatles’ stuff too. I was just the singer, but those guys played the scratches on the records!\n\n“Anyway, we’re playing around Houston and of course it’s that time in the ’60s and we’re all getting way too much acid and way too much weed and whatnot. These guys were the first rock & roll punks I ever knew of. Every one of them was incredibly usurous, meaning to avoid work and to get what they wanted.”\n\nTo be fair, Lively, Fraser and White were just short of destitute at that time and lived their music as much as played it. Like most teens in similar situations, they grabbed anything they could just to survive (especially food).\n\n“Scott told me they had very little money,” said Bullock. “They used hand soap to wash their hair and sometimes had to resort to stealing food. This is another area where Phil came in handy, because he was a skilled and audacious food store shoplifter.”\n\n“I considered myself a part of the band and I fell in love with all of that s**t,” admitted Carrick. “Then, it came time to go to Fort Worth. I can’t recall exactly why. Maybe T-Bone called or something, but it was time to head to Fort Worth and I had the GI Bill, so I went up there and started school.”\n\nAccording to Fraser, summer was over and they had to return to school, which explains the sudden move. Regardless, the return to Fort Worth marked a real turning point: the beginning of the Whistler, Chaucer, Detroit and Greenhill project.\n\nMR. BURNETT, MEET MR. WHISTLER, ETC…\n\nBefore the trip to Houston, Lively, White, Bullock and Fraser had met with T-Bone and had discussed what would eventually become Whistler, Chaucer, Detroit and Greenhill. While Bullock’s praise of Carrick’s voice led to that trip, the goal was nebulous, to say the least.\n\n“T-Bone had had an idea to have an ever-shifting group of writers and players,” explained Fraser. “It was a great idea aesthetically, but probably a bad idea, commercially.”\n\n“To me,” said Bullock, “WCD&G was always a recording project. I’m not sure there was even a specific goal for what we would do with the songs we were recording. It was more of an artistic adventure, writing the best songs we could, then seeing what we could do with them in the studio.”\n\nThose songs came mainly from the pens of Bullock, Fraser and Burnett. White, who was to become a major writer in Space Opera, stayed off to the side.\n\n“At the time,” he explained, “I was suffering from the getting-kicked-out-of-the-band syndrome. I felt like I didn’t have that much to bring to the table. They were such incredible talents and the whole thing was so amazing it just blew my mind. I considered myself the weak sister of the whole thing.”\n\n“Essentially,” remembered Carrick, “most of our waking hours were spent at Sound City. At first, it was just the three guys and myself with the occasional drummer thrown in the mix here and there. Just whoever we could get. From the day we got there, we’re living in the studio. Recording, recording, recording. What we had, by the standards of the late ’60s, were two Ampex four-tracks and this weird old patch base, so if you wanted to do a bunch of tracks, you would record onto four tracks, mix it down to one on the other machine, then start recording more stuff on four and mix that down to one. The process of doing that and keeping any sound quality was difficult, but T-Bone, who was younger than myself but older than the other guys, he just learned. He’d say, with what I have to work with, I do it this way, and though I have no idea how long he’d been doing it, he sure knew his way around. How T-Bone came to be a part of it, I don’t know. It never even occurred to me. You walked in and there was T-Bone and that was that.”\n\n“T-Bone, at age 19, was part owner of Sound City,” noted Bullock. “Scott, Edd, Phil and I were indeed back in high school and although some of us had to make up classes, we cut class regularly. We were not model students and spent more time at the studio than at school. T-Bone provided a secure, open-ended atmosphere where we were free to experiment and exchange ideas. Sometimes we would just sit in the control room or his office and listen to records, absorbing styles and techniques. Through the exploration of multi-track recording, we not only learned production techniques, but since it was a ‘layering’ process, it laid the foundation for a later self-education in arranging and orchestration.”\n\nThe music itself was a given, according to Carrick.\n\n“These guys just had music pouring out of them like you’ve never seen. I mean, it was just try to stop them from coming up with good songs. It was unbelievable. Eddie (Lively), in retrospect, I think was the most brilliant writer. He could write songs all day long. He’d read a history book and find some interesting character and he’d write a whole song about that character.. All in few hours.”\n\nOf course, it wasn’t all Lively. “It turns out,” Carrick went on, “at Scott’s house, there was a set of the classics of literature. What they would do was sit around, get the classics and open them up and find some great line— some beautiful, poetic line. They would pull that line out and go through and find another one and pull that out. Some of the music was just strung together, whether directly plagiarized or lightly paraphrased, from lines from the classics.”\n\nFraser’s mother, Virginia, gave the band encouragement at every turn, becoming the young musicians’ biggest supporter.\n\n“She taught music and had a Steinway in her house and was our biggest fan,” Lively said. “Most parents were always saying get your ass in school or get a job or you’ll never make it or have something to fall back on and all that crap. V.A. never said that. She was always in our corner saying do it, do it, do it!”\n\nAt the studio, “to sort of ‘pay our way’,” said Bullock, “we also served as studio sidemen for many sessions, mainly local people. One unforgettable character we worked with was The Legendary Stardust Cowboy, aka Norm Odom. He was this eccentric dude who wore cowboy attire and carried a briefcase full of star maps. He recorded several sides, including his hit ‘Paralyzed’, on which T-Bone played drums.”\n\nCarrick remembered the ‘sidemen’ sessions, too.\n\n“You know who Major Bill Smith is?” he asked. “He had Bruce Channel and ‘Hey Baby’? We got hired as a band to cut tracks for him, demos and stuff. What was amazing was how many different styles we did ‘Hey Baby’ in. I mean, if you can imagine The Byrds doing ‘Hey Baby’, we did it. The Butterfield Blues Band doing ‘Hey Baby’, we did it. The Beatles at Sgt. Pepper time doing ‘Hey Baby’, we did that. I don’t know how many times or how many different styles we did that song. It was just a piece of work and we’d have fun with it, you know? I think oftentimes the humor would come when it was first suggested. Everybody standing around laughing, saying yeah, The Byrds doing ‘Hey Baby’, but you know, we’d somehow come up with something appallingly good. Smith was making the suggestions because he owned it and was probably thinking, if I could only get it on the charts again…”\n\n“I recall the first time I laid eyes on Major Bill Smith,” said Bullock. “He was sitting at T-Bone’s desk in the Sound City office working the phone, hyping a record to some deejay. He looked like a cross between the Wizard of Oz and L. Ron Hubbard. The sales pitch was all about getting a record some airplay. He finished his spiel with what I later learned was his signature line… ‘This record is a cotton-pickin’ smash!’\n\n“Major Bill was the ultimate small-time regional song monger. He produced ‘Hey Baby’ and ‘Hey Paula’ which were both national hits, then spent the rest of his career trying to duplicate that early success while recording gimmicky stuff on the cheap to make a quick buck. He came from the time of the hit single but by the late ’60s, the LP was king. I’ve met quite a few hustlers and slick A&R guys, or ‘lizards’ as we called them back then, but never anyone else like Major Bill.\n\n“He was somehow instrumental in helping T-Bone get us the deal with UNI. After we landed the record deal, he tried to pressure us, myself and Scott, into one of his brilliant schemes. He wanted us to record a song by Mark Lindsay of The Raiders! My jaw dropped when I heard that absurd idea. Scott didn’t hesitate in telling him in no uncertain terms that there was no way in hell we were recording that song. Bill said, ‘You have to do what I say. I got you that deal.’ Scott came back with ‘You’re just another man. We don’t have to do anything we don’t want to.’ I don’t think Major Bill was used to being told no, but he had to take it. I was really proud of Scott, standing up to this buffoon, this authority figure. From then on, we never took s**t from anyone.”\n\nDay after day in the studio took its toll, but there were diversions. Carrick remembered (very fondly), “One of the things we did was shut down what we were doing and watch the Saturday afternoon teen dance show out of Dallas (‘Sump’n Else’ on WFAA-TV, Channel 8). We’d ridicule the music and all those nerds, but they had some go-go girls on that show and the Master of Brilliance— the mastery, even at that young age— T-Bone contacted them and got them to stop by the studio and record some stuff with us playing, just so we could be in the presence of their pulchritude. It seems to me that one time, T-Bone even convinced them to come over in their Saturday afternoon white vinyl go-go boots and dress things. I don’t think any of us entertained any notion that we were likely to score, but we were in their presence. I think that was the magic of the deal. I’m not sure it was ever intended that we would do anything other than get them there, and it worked!”\n\n“True story,” according to Bullock. “We cut a track on the Traffic song ‘Dear Mr. Fantasy’ for two of the girls to sing on. It was actually pressed on one of Major Bill’s indy labels, so he as well was part of the deal. I think I still have a copy of it somewhere. They were dolls.”\n\nThe sessions themselves were loose, musicians moving in and out of the studios as they were needed or as it happened.\n\n“What was going on,” Carrick said, “was a lot of weird stuff. This guy, Rick Nation may have played some washboard on parts of the album or sang on some of the tracks. I know that Dave and I were on some of the tracks that Nation’s jug band recorded during that time. But we did things like bounce golf balls in the bathroom in time to the music which may have gone way back on a track.”\n\nActually, Carrick and Bullock produced sessions for the jug band, which also featured Roy Robinson (now playing under the name Amos Staggs).\n\n“Rick showed up at the studio,” said Bullock, “and T-Bone agreed to record his jug band and asked John and I to produce. Rick never played on our sessions, but John and I did on theirs.”\n\nLooking back, Carrick had a hard time remembering who played what on most tracks. “I might have played guitar on some of the stuff,” he said. “It’s very likely that I did play some acoustic guitar, some background guitar, as well as some percussion. But when you had Scott Fraser and Edd Lively there to play guitar… Son, they sure didn’t need what I had to offer.”\n\nThe truth is, it is hard to say what was used and what was discarded. At some point, it all started to run together.\n\n“We spent so much time in the studio and our world was really, really small,” explained Carrick. “Outside the studio, we occasionally went over to the jug band’s house, but there just wasn’t a whole lot going on that wasn’t about music and that studio. If somebody else was recording, we’d go over and just hang out. I was up there, to the best of my recollection, for about a year, and David came back somewhere about seven or eight months into the deal.”\n\nBullock actually came back from Houston the same time as did the others, to return to school. “The others had been recording for a couple of months during the summer,” he said, “so I got back into the group, at their request, in September of that year.”\n\n“It first appeared that he was going to kind of work into the deal,” continued Carrick, “then things got weird. You know how a chicken will get a spot of blood on him and the others will pick at him? We’re going along and I don’t know what happened, but Eddie got a spot of blood on him and the chickens went for him. By constantly putting down his stuff and ragging him and messing up his stuff when they were recording. Eddie was it. I have no recollection as to why that was, but Eddie was it. So Eddie left, out of the deal. I mean, he was kind of shaking his head and pissed off and kind of sad, and he just wasn’t there anymore. To the point that they began to re-cut tracks on the album that he had done. Things went on and then I got a spot of blood on me, you know? Same thing. It became obvious that it had become a deal and that I wasn’t in it. On the album, there were songs that I sang that David and different people went back and sang, and they sang exactly like me.”\n\nFraser disputed that claim, as did Bullock. “We never replaced any of Edd’s guitar tracks,” Fraser stated. “David re-recorded the lead vocals on a few songs, but Carrick’s voice is still present as both lead and harmony.” As for Lively leaving, Fraser wrote it off to a personality conflict between T-Bone and Lively.\n\n“It was a rough breakup,” Bullock admitted, “and honestly all I can remember is that everyone went their separate ways. Like a marriage among six people, there is bound to be strife and, eventually, a shakeout.”\n\n“Of the Fraser/Lively songs on the album,” he recalled, “’Day of Childhood’ and ‘House of Collection’ were recorded before my involvement. ‘Just Me and Her’ was the third Fraser/Lively song, and we worked as hard on that as on the others. Edd’s songs were never slighted.”\n\nStill, the split was not as amicable as remembered. Lively remembers that Fraser and he “canceled each other out.” And there was pressure. “They had Bullock and he was a voice from Heaven, and Fraser could play anything. There was just too much talent for four walls. You needed a castle. So they kind of wedged me out because I was the weakest link and, at the same time, the thorn in everyone’s ass. I was Neil Young to their Crosby and Stills, you know? It broke my heart, but not from a business standpoint. It was mostly between myself and Fraser, and Fraser just kind of turned his back on me. He went with the crowd. Of course, it was great for me, though I couldn’t see it at the time. It made me go out and stand on my own feet. I became a leader instead of a semi-leader. I think it was my destiny.”\n\nCarrick also claims the pecking extended to Burnett.\n\n“I always say ‘the guys’,” he said, “because I don’t want to include myself in that petty s**t (implying that he played his part), but they tried to put the blood spot on T-Bone and he wouldn’t have it. He had the ability to move on. He’d go, oh, they’re doing that thing today… okay… let’s record this track. And that was part of T-Bone’s brilliance. No matter what mood, no matter how stoned anybody was, no matter how hormonal, T-Bone would get the job done. That may be his greatest gift, besides a depth of knowledge and skill. That ability to get a really diverse bunch of people to work together as smoothly as they possibly can.”\n\nOf course, as Bullock stated earlier, no band alive lives in perfect harmony and Carrick was an outsider, of sorts. Older and more experienced, he had a different view of things. Still, the years have shown that he had an appreciation of the situation, as his take on Phil White shows.\n\n“Phil came from, by Fort Worth standards, a fairly well-off family,” he said. “His dad owned a bunch of Dairy Queens. For some reason, from an early age, Phil was kind of a rebel. He was big enough where he could be a bit pushy and get away with it and always seemed to get in a lot of fights and liked to press his luck. At some time, he got into martial arts and became a no-s**t badass. He has always had a big drinking and drug problem, too. He’s never had a job as far as I know and I’ve heard people talk about having to move because Phil wouldn’t get off the couch.\n\n“The other side of that is that Phil is brilliant. He could have made an easy living as a standup comic. He’s quick, he’s funny, he’s insightful. But it’s like he was insecure or something. I’ve always really, really enjoyed Phil.\n\n“See, I was fresh out of the Marines. I ran into Phil years later and Phil implied that back in those days I always wanted to kick his ass. Physically. That was the furthest thing from my mind. I would get frustrated with him because of his amazing ability to f**k things up and laugh about it while it was happening, but kick his ass? I’m just not an ass-kicking kind of guy.”\n\nTHE UNWRITTEN WORKS, ETC.\n\nBy the summer of 1968, there was enough for an album.\n\nAccording to Carrick, “When this thing came to where it was essentially finished and we were having preliminary mixes— edits pretty much done— what we had was kind of unmastered to stereo, but mixed down to stereo. T-Bone, boy genius, went out and presented it to UNI Records. They liked it and made an offer. I don’t know exactly what the offer was, but evidently by the standards of the time it was a good offer— some good guarantees for whatever guarantees are worth. Distribution, promises— those kinds of things. Understand, the way this deal was structured, Whistler, Chaucer, Detroit and Greenhill was a concept and not necessarily a specific group of individuals. So T-Bone comes back and says, if this is what they are willing to offer right off the bat, I should push for more.\n\n“Well, as it turns out, what they wanted was a Texas band because Texas guys were hot at that time. Janis is happening, Johnny Winter is happening. A lot of the San Francisco cats were out of Texas. So T-Bone goes back with a counter-proposition, asking for more, and UNI took what they originally offered T-Bone and gave it to the next band that they wanted, that band was the Fever Tree, and Fever Tree took it. Well, when T-Bone went back, what we finally got was kind of a cut-out bin deal. We’ll do this and that and we’ll mail a hundred copies to deejays and we’ll print so many copies.”\n\nWhile the negotiations had resulted in less than a dream deal, UNI did give the go-ahead to ready the album for release. WCD&G (and assumedly, T-Bone) turned to Guy Clark for the cover art.\n\n“At that time,” said Bullock, “Guy Clark was an accomplished musician but was just starting to write original songs and hadn’t recorded yet. He was a friend from the Houston folk scene and was a luthier as well as an artist and a musician. He had, however, done some album cover art, so we asked him to do the design and photography. I don’t know whose idea it was to include him in the photos, but since the mythical group had four names and there were only three remaining musicians, it made sense to add a fourth face. It was a spontaneous decision. Guy set up the shot, set the timer on his camera and placed himself in the shots.\n\n“The front cover was done by the garden wall of an old mansion in the Montrose neighborhood of Houston. In the back cover shot, we were looking out the back windows of Guy’s house on Fannin Street.”\n\nCarrick felt the sting of exclusion. He found out about the shoot from Clark himself.\n\n“Guy called me up and started talking to me about the photograph and I said, what photograph? He said, well, for the album cover. All the guys were in town and were going to get Guy to do the cover art. They’d come to Houston to do it, for some reason. So I called them up and they said they didn’t want me in the picture.”\n\nWhen asked who he talked with, Carrick said “I don’t remember. Probably Phil. Phil was generally the one who would mouthpiece things. Scott was very quiet and was the most reticent. Dave would (more than likely) fall into line behind Phil. Anyway, since they had four names on it, rather than have me in it, they had Guy in it. It would have been more pleasing to me to have T-Bone on there. But it struck me that that was how petty things had gotten.”\n\nNot really pettiness, at least in Bullock’s recollection. “The group had splintered and it was down to the three of us at that point, and T-Bone had no interest in being on the cover. He had already moved on.”\n\nThe Unwritten Works Etc. was released in October of 1968 and promptly tanked. It received little promotion, even in Texas, and basically was tossed beneath a moving train. The seed had already taken hold, though, and Fraser, Bullock and White vowed to move forward together. They continued to write and rehearse, grabbing fill-in drummers in the hope of finding a match. They finally booked their own gig at a brand new facility in Fort Worth.\n\n“That was the ‘coming out’ after the album was released,” said Bullock. “It was March of 1969 that we booked a concert at the W.E. Scott Theater. Scott Theater was built for community theater and dance performances and we were the first musical group to play there. Bear in mind, we were (mainly) a studio group at this time and Scott and T-Bone had played drums. So we hired a drummer named Tony Lee, invited our friend John Harris to play piano and sold out the 500-seat theater for our first real concert. The emcee for that show was the Legendary Stardust Cowboy.\n\n“John Harris has been a friend of ours since we were teenagers. He played with us some in the post-Mods days and then after the WCD&G album, he played piano and banjo with us at Scott Theater. John had a pure, high voice and played on some of our original songs as well as soloing on a traditional folk song called ‘John Hardy’.\n\n“We turned the album title around and billed ourselves as The Unwritten Works for that show. By the time the album had been released, we had moved beyond it musically, so we didn’t carry the Whistler, Chaucer (or Unwritten Works) flag for long. In fact, that was the only concert ever billed under either of those names.”\n\nA member of Space Opera’s extended family opened the show. Julie Smith, a young and beautiful high school folkie, had caught the eye of manager Michael Mann (and dragged him 20 yards, as comedian Emo Phillips would say). She had previously performed as a duo with Susan Allen (now Susan Colegrove and playing with husband Jim Colegrove in the group Lost Country) under the name Glycerine and Rosewater, playing venues such as the prestigious Rubaiyat in Dallas, headlining over the likes of B.W. Stevenson and others. (“That was THE place,” laughed Julie Smith-Johnson. “Once you hit The Rubaiyat, you hit the big time. We were really too young to be playing there, but I like to think that we were just really talented.”) At the time, Glycerine had just split with Rosewater, so Mann set up an audition with Fraser, who consented to listen.\n\n“I lived in the back bedroom of my grandmother’s house,” Julie said, “and Mike had brought over The Unwritten Works album. I played it and really liked it. I had been playing since I was eleven and until recently had performed with Susan Allen (now, Colegrove), as Glycerine & Rosewater. Space Opera had rented this big house on 6th Avenue and had played several gigs by then, so they were officially a working band. When Mike mentioned this opportunity to do this big concert, I thought it wonderful but couldn’t even imagine it being true. The only thing is, he said, you have to let Scott hear some of your songs. I wrote a lot of my own stuff and playing for Scott was downright frightening for me. I was fifteen or sixteen at the time. I played him two of my songs and he gave me the okay.”\n\n“Yeah, Julie and Mary Rhoads were part of the story before Space Opera ever played their first live performance under that name,” said Mann. “They were best friends in high school, which is where I met them. Julie was my first great love and an American Beauty. She was a talented singer and as funny as Lucille Ball. She auditioned for us and Scott gave the thumbs up.”\n\nThe night of the concert is still a vivid memory for Julie Smith-Johnson, as she is now known. “I came up through the orchestra pit to a stool,” she said, “and sang all of my original songs. I might have done two old Negro folk tunes, but the rest were mine. If I had it to do again, I would have let the guys direct me more, or asked them to, and tried to learn what they wanted me to sing. Still, the audience was very kind and received me very well.”\n\nThe concert, a sellout, was successful to say the very least, but the band knew it was only one night, an anomaly at that point in their existence.\n\n“Until we found Brett and formed Space Opera,” said Bullock, “the three of us would just show up and play clubs with no billing, while our music evolved.”\n\nThose club gigs involved anyone they thought could fit within the framework of the band. Besides drummer Tony Lee, “there was a guy named Doyle Breshears,” said Bullock, “who sang and played guitar with a fantastic Fort Worth band called The Cellar Dwellers. Doyle played drums with us for a few gigs, just before we found Brett. Dean Parks, a studio musician who played guitar on just about every studio album the past 40 years it seems, played drums for us on some studio sessions. As for Scott, he never played drums onstage again once he made the change to guitar.”\n\nThey also continued to work at Sound City. Fraser remembered recording several other songs there. “I played guitar tracks on everything,” he said, “and keyboards wherever they were needed. And drums. But at the time, I didn’t sing.”\n\nScott did begin singing shortly thereafter, according to Bullock. “He began to sing publicly in 1969. It was one of his many hidden talents that he decided to develop about the same time that he surfaced as a monster guitar player.”\n\nALAS, POOR CARRICK (I knew him well, Horatio…)\n\nAfter removing himself from Sound City and clearing up personal business, John Carrick returned to Houston to what he hoped would be a new direction. Ready to play, he looked around and found a few people heading in the same direction… in more ways than one.\n\n“I came back to Houston and started my heroin career,” he said. “I had a friend— the one who’d introduced me to David— who wanted me to try an electric band, so we got some guys together. As a matter of fact, one was the old drummer from the Fever Tree. I think he was the one who told me the story about how they got their deal with UNI. Anyway, we started this band called the Texas Rangers and achieved some notoriety, but it was four young heroin addicts and a meth freak. We did a short tour with Creedence Clearwater and John Fogerty called us up and wanted us to record. It suddenly occurred to me, gosh, I am liable to still be under contract to UNI. Anyway, Fogerty checked it out and it turned out I was still under contract to UNI, who said they’d release me for an absurd amount of money. That was just because it was Fogerty. That was like a year and a half after Whistler, three years after I left Fort Worth.\n\n“You see, even in the midst of the good music, the drugs kept the Texas Rangers apart. There was a big club in Austin called The Vulcan Gas Company and we probably played there as much as Johnny Winter or any of the bands out of Houston. We were wildly accepted, but we were just too f**ked up and, eventually, we fell apart.”\n\nCarrick spent the next 18 or 19 years a drug addict. Today, he brokers guitars for musicians and collectors and makes a living. He still plays, but more for fun than for survival.\n\nAs many years as it has been, though, there remains one burr under Carrick’s saddle. “It has always annoyed me that T-Bone doesn’t include the Whistler, Chaucer album on his discography,” he said. “I’ve been told that he doesn’t like to talk about it. It’s almost like, to him, this album never really happened, for some reason.”\n\n“It’s not unusual for musicians or artists of any kind to feel ambivalent about work they did when they were starting out,” countered Bullock. “Maybe that’s how T-Bone sees it, and I understand. We were all still kids, learning how to write and record.”\n\nWCD&G: An Addendum…\n\nRegardless, the time with the band was a magical time for John Carrick. While finding information about the songs on the album has been difficult, Carrick, struggling to remember, had this to say:\n\n“The Viper”— That one I sang originally and after I was completely gone, they redid the vocal and David sang it. He didn’t do nearly a good a job as me, by the way. He was too sweet for that song. It had a real sweet, intriguing quality to it. (That is definitely Carrick on lead vocals in the music video)\n\n“Just Me and Her”— I can’t remember exactly how that ended up. I know I sang it originally. An interesting side note is that the five-string banjo in the background was supplied by Northeast Texas banjo stud Steve Bruton.\n\n“Tribute to Sundance”— David wrote that song. That’s a tribute to Little Sundance which is (whispers) LSD. It was a steal from a guy in Austin who had written a song called “Little Sundance”. A guy named Wally. I can’t remember his name, but if you follow Austin, there’s a cartoon character out of Austin known as Oat Willie and that character was patterned after Wally. (“The guy’s name was Wally Stopher,” explained Bullock, “a fixture on the mid-’60s Austin scene, when Austin was still cool. I had heard the recording of ‘Little Sundance’ at Andrus Sound in Houston and loved the song, so I wrote a tribute to it. Kind of odd, but there you have it. My song was not intended as a tribute to LSD, nor was it a steal. It was a completely different song.”)\n\n“As Pure as the Freshly Driven Snow”— That’s David. See, that’s what I mean. That’s the kind of stuff where David’s voice really shines. Not just ballads, but on anything that’s sweet and compelling. I have more of a bulldozer effect.\n\nCarrick admits that his memories regarding the tracks may be faulty. And he admitted to not having recently heard the album.\n\nBullock, though, took notes. Here is his track-by-track rundown, incomplete though it may be, for the Unwritten Works Etc. album, as it appears in his journals.\n\n“The Viper” (Burnett)\n\nCarrick: Lead vocal\n\nBullock: Harmony vocal, harmonica, acoustic guitar, spoons\n\nFraser: Drums, electric guitar\n\nWhite: Bass\n\nDave Ferguson: Violin\n\n“I enjoyed playing the harmonica solo in this song of T-Bone’s,” Bullock said. “I still thinks it fits and sounds pretty good. This was also the song where John Carrick and I made good on the ‘silver honey’ vocal blend, John singing the melody and myself on parallel harmony. We recorded the vocals side-by-side on one Neumann microphone. Lots of fun. Dave Ferguson played his iconoclastic violin parts on this song and on a few of T-Bone’s others. Ferguson really added a lot to the album. He was a brilliant player and T-Bone apparently knew just how to use his talents.”\n\n“Day of Childhood” (Fraser/Lively)\n\nCarrick: Lead vocal\n\nBullock: Backing vocal\n\nFraser: Drums, 12-string acoustic guitar, 12-string electric guitar\n\nLively: Electric guitar, backwards lead guitar, backing vocal\n\nWhite: Bass, backing vocal\n\n“Upon Waking” (Bullock)\n\nBullock: Vocals, acoustic guitar\n\nFraser: Organ. 12-string acoustic guitar\n\nBurnett: Plucked piano strings, backwards strings (from another song he had recorded previously)\n\nWhite: Bass\n\nBULLOCK: “’Upon Waking From the Nap’ is the first song I ever wrote. When I played it for T-Bone, he said it sounded like a John Phillips song and he wasn’t sure if it would fit with what we were doing. As it turned out, we were doing everything, so no problem. The recording was basically my voice and acoustic guitar with Phil’s bass part. Then, T-Bone put his magic to it. At several points in the song, T-Bone plucked the strings of the studio piano like a harp gliss. He then brought out the master tape of a song he had recorded some time earlier, I think at Robin Hood Bryan’s studio. It was a T-Bone original and it had a string quartet on it. He isolated the string tracks, ran them backwards and that became the string section of my song. Serendipity plays a huge role in recording, as does skill. It was a combination of those elements that made the strings work so well on that track. I also owe the title to T-Bone. The song was untitled and he suggested it. I wasn’t knocked out by the title but took his suggestion, so there it is.”\n\n“Live ‘Til I Die” (Bullock)\n\nBullock: Vocal, acoustic guitar, harmonica\n\nFraser: Drums, electric guitar (rhythm and lead)\n\nWhite: Bass\n\nOn this one, Bullock took a phrase from an old blues song and built his song around it. “I wrote the lyrics while riding on a Santa Fe train between Houston and Fort Worth,” he explained. “The song I had in mind for a model was ‘Leavin’ Trunk’ by Taj Mahal. We used to listen to his record a lot at the studio. My command of the blues vocal has improved from my teenage years, I am happy to say. Space Opera played that tune right up to the end of the band, at our last gig.”\n\n“Street in Paris” (Burnett)\n\nCarrick: All vocals\n\nDave Ferguson: Violin\n\nThe rest of the backing track may have been mostly T-Bone and was done before his association with us.\n\n“As Pure As the Freshly Driven Snow” (Burnett)\n\nBullock: Vocals\n\nFraser: Drums, acoustic guitar, maybe piano\n\nWhite: Bass, sped-up bass\n\nDave Ferguson: Violin\n\nBurnett: Maybe piano, not sure which of them played it\n\n“Tribute to Sundance” (Bullock)\n\nBullock: Vocals, acoustic guitar, whisper harp, sand blocks\n\nFraser: Acoustic guitar\n\nWhite: Bass\n\nBurnett: Accordion\n\nBULLOCK: “I had heard a recording of a song called ‘Little Sundance’ at Andrus’ Studio in Houston, I think it was by Wally Stopher and the Conqueroo. It was a really beautiful song and I liked it so much that I wrote a tribute to the actual song. The only resemblance to ‘Little Sundance’ was in its instrumentation, as well as I can remember from having heard it only once. We used acoustic guitar, bass, sand blocks, and an harmonica called a ‘whisper harp’. T-Bone added accordion (which was right in the pocket) and I sang two voice tracks and we were done. This was, incidentally, only the second song I had written.”\n\n“House of Collection” (Fraser/Lively)\n\nCarrick: Lead vocal\n\nBullock: Backing vocal\n\nFraser: Drums, acoustic guitar\n\nLively: Lead guitar, electric rhythm guitar, backing vocal\n\nWhite: Bass, backing vocal\n\nBurnett: Backing vocal\n\nPiano and harmonium were played by Lively and/or Fraser\n\n“Just Me and Her” (Fraser/Lively)\n\nCarrick: Lead vocal\n\nBullock: Harmony vocal, electric rhythm guitar\n\nFraser: Electric 12-string, lead guitar 6-string\n\nWhite: Bass, harmony vocal\n\nStephen Bruton: Played a guitar part which sound somewhat like a banjo, but it was a 6-string acoustic guitar in open tuning, capo-ed up high on the fretboard.\n\n“On Lusty Gentlemen” (Burnett)\n\nBullock: Lead vocal, recorder solo\n\nLively: Flute\n\nDave Ferguson: Violin\n\nCarrick: Backing vocal\n\nWhite: Backing vocal\n\nI can’t say who played organ, piano, bass and drums. This was done before I got involved.\n\n“Ready To Move” (Bullock)\n\nBullock: Lead vocal, electric 12-string\n\nCarrick: Backing vocal\n\nFraser: Drums, lead guitar\n\nWhite: Bass, backing vocal\n\nBULLOCK: “When I wrote this, I consciously used a few notes from the hymn ‘Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing’. If you know the hymn, you can hear it in there. One of the words we always used to describe The Byrds’ music was ‘churchy’. Listen to 5D and you can hear its majestic, stoic quality. On ‘Ready To Move’, I was thinking of ‘Change Is Now’ as a model and I think we came close to that spirit in the recording. It has kind of a Celtic, droning feel and is probably the heaviest song on the album. That, by the way, is the last song we recorded for the album and we were pleased to end it that way.”\n\nIt should be noted here that The Unwritten Works Etc. was included on a list of Mojo’s “The Greatest Albums of All-Time” and was a feature item on an episode of TV’s “The Gilmore Girls”. Historically, the album stands out, but it was not until the band found Brett Owen Wilson, cheerleader and jazz drummer, that the story of Space Opera, the band, begins.\n\nCHAPTER THREE: We’re Singers and We’re Sailors…\n\nPlaying gigs with the odd musician was not the way to proceed, the trio decided, so the next move was to get organized. They finally had a business man, a manager, Michael Mann. Bullock and White both credit Mann with much of the band’s success.\n\n“He was the one who actually got us all our jobs and negotiated contracts,” Bullock emphasized, “and found sources of money that we needed to gear up and survive. Michael’s hard work and creativity was the reason we went from ‘new band’ to Columbia Records’ artists in less than three years.”\n\n“I hired Michael while in college,” said White. “My father, rest his soul, had told me that if I would finish high school and prove to him that I got into college, he would buy me the car of my choice. So I went and took this GED test, which had questions like which animals bark— frogs, bulls, puppies. If you could pass that test, you got the equivalent of a high school diploma, which would mean that I was eligible to get into Tarrant County Junior College. To make it short, I took all of this to my father about two days after our conversation. He figured I was maybe two years away. I said, Dad, I’m in college, I want an MG. So he bought me one.\n\n“About the third week of college, I ran into Michael Mann. He and I had lunch together and talked things over and I asked if he was interested in being our manager and he said sure. So we went out to his car— he had an MG, too. At that point, it had something to do with what is fine and grown in Mexico and the next thing you know, I hired him to be our manager. I figured I could finesse him in. I could say, look, he’s willing to do this and he’s willing to do that.” (NOTE: The official date for Michael’s hire, according to Bullock’s journal, was November of ’68, shortly after the release of the Whistler, Chaucer album)\n\n“Michael joined us before we found Brett and started Space Opera, when we were still trying to fit the pieces together,” said Bullock. “He helped us do that by managing our business and getting us work. With Michael on the business end, we were free to make music. He provided the forums we needed— club dates, concerts, recording dates. He helped attract financial supporters and kept expanding our business network and strategy. He was an equal partner with us and we were an insular, tight family living and breathing (eventually) Space Opera.”\n\n“I had no experience,” Mann related, “and started off by finding places for the band to play, hauling equipment and doing sound. Shortly after that, Phil and I both just walked away from school and rented a two story house in the same neighborhood David lived in.\n\n“Phil was outgoing, athletic and liked trying different things. For instance, he was very interested in exploring different philosophies and the like. He was the one always willing to try new things, and we went along because he was a fun guy, but as time went by my relationship with him became mostly business. We were all very close, almost like brothers, but we were very focused on becoming a success and doing our respective jobs.”\n\nMann spent a short time working with the various lineups gleaned from three legs of the Whistler, Chaucer days. The first show he set up outside of the clubs and occasional party gigs was the Scott Theater concert where they were billed as The Unwritten Works (see Chapter Two). He would soon prove himself to be worthy of equal partnership.\n\nNow that Mann was in, the next link was musical— a drummer. Continuing with fill-ins would never work. While in Austin during late Spring of ’69, they happened to ask around. Drummer? Sure, someone said. In fact there was a good one, and he happened to be from Fort Worth. Space Opera tracked down and met with the final link in the musical equation: Brett Owen Wilson. Wilson was not unknown to the guys. He had gone to school with them at Paschal, had been in fact a popular cheerleader there, and had played drums around Fort Worth in various jazz combos, most notably with compadre Ridgway Scott. Arrangements were made for a tryout.\n\nWilson told his then girlfriend and future wife, Claudia Wormley, about it. There was something about the guys— a positive energy. After the first session, it was a lock.\n\n“I remember Brett feeling like this was something he had to do,” she recalled. “He wasn’t really going to school to any great purpose. He had just become eligible to become a day student when I met him, in March.”\n\nWilson packed up his drums and headed for Fort Worth.\n\nThe newly formed unit decided to take the name Space Opera because they were interested in science fiction and the advent of manned space exploration, virtually a comic strip being brought to life.\n\n“We saw the 60s as the beginning of a new high-tech age,” said Bullock, “not so much the leftist utopianism of the hippies, but as a time when art and technology would bring new enlightenment and new opportunities. The element of ethereal, spacey sound was an important part of our music. So to us, Space Opera was a play on words, meaning ethereal songs. We didn’t philosophize on the subject. We just chose the name and moved on. I don’t think the name kept people from listening to our music. Then again, it does sound a bit too much of the period, in my opinion.”\n\nWhen Claudia graduated a few months later, she also left Austin for Fort Worth. “I moved in with Brett when he was in the band house, but he wasn’t happy with that,” she said, “so I moved into a duplex with Brenda, Phil’s then-girlfriend. Mike (Mann) was at the house. Scott still lived at home, as I recall, but he was at the house all of the time. When Brenda ended up going somewhere else, Brett and I decided we’d move in together. We rented a house and two years later ended up buying it.”\n\nThe early days were a learning experience, but it quickly became obvious that the band had something beyond the norm.\n\n“They were tight,” said Claudia. “They were all such good musicians and Brett brought a whole new aspect to the other three guys because of his jazz experience. By the time Brett tied up with them, he had been playing jazz for about nine years. I thought they were fabulous. This was a unique thing I was experiencing and to have the man I love up there performing— it was like if I was smitten beforehand, while watching them I was completely smitten.”\n\nOther pieces began to fall into place as well. Cass Edwards III, who had bankrolled and produced the Mods’ sessions, signed on as sound man. He had left Fort Worth after The Mods to attend Cornell University. Upon his return, Space Opera filled his time and, for all practical purposes, he became a vital part of the band’s operations.\n\n“In fact,” Bullock emphasized, “Cass was audio engineer for the Whistler Chaucer concert earlier that year. From The Mods all the way to Space Opera and beyond, Cass has been part of our thing, longer than anyone.”\n\nThe band played their first gig as Space Opera at the End of Cole club in Dallas in June of ’69 and played Fort Worth continually July of that year, having become the house band at the HOP, a popular tavern/pizza house known as the House of Pizza before the band’s friend Craig Liddell bought it. Liddell also teamed with Mann to open Zeke’s, one of Fort Worth’s early forays into fish and chips. Mann hired two girls to help run Zeke’s, Julie Smith and Mary Rhoads. Both were to become important parts of the Space Opera saga. “Julie was the one who opened The Unwritten Works concert at Scott Theater,” Mann pointed out.\n\n“We played three nights a week, four sets per night at the House of Pizza,” according to Bullock. “The HOP was a college hangout and from playing there we got quite a few private party gigs, mostly frat parties. We also played some at The Greek Letter, four sets a night and six on the weekends. It was operated by an Italian guy named Lou DeMarco, who always treated us well. The gig ended when the place burned to the ground.”\n\nThrough Angus G. Wynne III, they were booked to play the Texas International Pop Festival over the Labor Day weekend. Headliners included B.B. King, Led Zeppelin, Santana, Ten Years After and Chicago Transit Authority, with less notables Shiva’s Headband, Nazz, Rotary Connection, Incredible String Band and Freddy King, among others. It was the band’s first major concert and a big learning experience.\n\n“We had developed a relationship with Showco,” said Mann, “the promotion company which produced the festival. It was owned by Angus Wynne and Jack Calmes. They were both very savvy and ethical businessmen and well connected socially.”\n\n“Wynne wasn’t a Space Opera backer,” explained Bullock, “but he did befriend us in the early days. His family is old Dallas money, but Angus is a soul man. He was always involved with the music scene. He booked us to play private parties as well as the Texas International Pop Festival, which was his creation.”\n\nFor the Pop Festival, Space Opera was originally scheduled only for the Free Stage.\n\n“The Free Stage was set up in an area outside the Main Stage,” Bullock pointed out. “It was admission-free, so those who didn’t have tickets for the main stage could hear some music. Wavy Gravy and Ken Babbs of The Merry Pranksters, whose bus ‘Further’ was parked immediately behind the stage, shared emcee duties and ran the Free Stage.\n\n“Some great musicians also came and played the Free Stage. One night, there was a great jam that included B.B. King and Johnny Winter, two great blues guitarists in their prime. It was magic and it was so cool that musicians like that came over and played for free.”\n\nAccording to Richard Hayner, whose website is devoted solely to the festival and related activities, Grand Funk, scheduled to open all three days, pulled out of Monday and left the festival in a jam, so to speak. Space Opera was asked to fill in on the main stage, which they gladly did. It was another feather in a fast-growing cap.\n\nEven with success, it was fast becoming obvious that the band needed something other than promises and word of mouth to further their future in music They decided to record a demo. They entered Delta Studio in Fort Worth and laid down a Fraser tune called “Old Sal”. The session was gratis.\n\n“Our usual deal, from that point on,” said Bullock, “was to record on spec, or the studio would just give us a free ride based on their interest in our music.”\n\nWhile at Delta, they reacquainted themselves with a friend from the Sound City days, David Anderson. Through him, another recording opportunity materialized.\n\n“He had been a partner with T-Bone at Sound City and was hanging out at Delta,” said Mann. “He was then attempting to be a songwriter and introduced us to a guy who introduced us to Bubba Fowler, a Nashville producer.”\n\n“Anderson was an ordained Baptist minister, but not a practicing man of the cloth,” added Bullock. “He was a very genial and positive person who had always been good to us in the Sound City days. On a side note, he played drums with The Legendary Stardust Cowboy on Rowan and Martin’s Laugh In television show. He was in on that session at Delta (again, a freebie for us) and suggested Fowler as a contact for recording in Nashville.\n\n“Fowler was a songwriter as well, and an aspiring producer,” added Bullock. “It was an opportunity, so we flew out and stayed with Fowler in his house. Brett, Scott and I slept in his unfinished attic, being very careful not to fall through the ceiling. We recorded two songs at the Columbia Studio in Nashville under Fowler’s auspices (“5/4,” a Bullock song, and “Lovin’ Stream” by Bullock and White). Both songs, including vocals, were cut in one session. The band had not really thought about what they might do with the recordings, though, and nothing ever came of it.\n\nThen, in late ’69, they got a break. “We were introduced to Jim Meeker,” said Bullock. “Jim was an oilman and art collector, about 15 years our elder. He was Ivy League-educated, single and lived in a large modern house adjacent to a country club golf course. Artists and musicians, both established and ascendant, along with ne’er-do-wells of all stripes, stayed or visited Jim’s salon.”\n\n“Gary Scott, a friend of the band, was dating a very pretty socialite named Janie Beggs who knew Meeker,” Mann added. “I think Meeker and Beggs were somehow related. Beggs later married Glen Frey of The Eagles. Meeker, in my opinion, was the single most influential person in Space Opera’s career. He was our money man. He hired Julie Smith to handle some matters for him and she did a great job. He was in the business of buying and selling art and Julie was in the middle of all that and became our inside contact. She kept our books and helped us keep up with the bills.”\n\nSmith handled whatever affairs Meeker handed her, including those of the band. “Michael had 50% of a fish restaurant, Zeke’s,” she said, “which I helped run along with Mary. (Ed. Note: Craig Liddell and Mann purchased it from Otto and Harriet Zurcher) I quit Zeke’s and began working for Meeker, and I also kept the books for Space Opera. Looking back on it, I was liaison between Mike and Zeke’s, Mike and Meeker, while looking after the band’s interests. I went from handling receipts that they’d bring in— hamburger receipts along with a french fry or two in a paper bag sent to me through the mail— to handling real money. Later, Michael would sometimes request a payout, or Meeker would sometimes just tell me what to send after having talked with Mike. I did that with a number of artists. I was the go-between. They came to me instead of dealing with Meeker, occasionally. That was my job.”\n\n“At Meeker’s place,” Bullock continued, “we met Eric Andersen (who played a role in introducing the band to Columbia Records). Others who passed through included Andy Warhol, Ed Ruscha, Bob Neuwirth, and a beautiful girl who called herself Tonto (Phyllis Major, who also visited us in Williamsville two years later and ultimately married Jackson Browne). Jim also introduced us to his fine arts friends such as Peggy Bernier. Jim became our patron and friend and we hung out at his house at night, enjoying his hospitality and playing music for fun.\n\n“Jim often mentioned this old friend of his who was a songwriter in Nashville. One night, he invited us to have dinner and play some songs for this friend. After that dinner, we played a few of our tunes on acoustic instruments. We sounded pretty good by that time, our harmonies tight and pure, and we were full of confidence. Ascendant.\n\n“This old guy, very drunk, pulled out his beat-up Martin with autographs carved into it and began to play. I remember thinking, this poor guy, he doesn’t sound so good and he’s already 33(!), over the hill! Maybe we can help him when we get famous. Ironically, every song he played that night was a huge hit within the next year and we never even cracked the charts. His name was Kris Kristofferson.”\n\nA month later, in October, they opened for Johnny Winter at Panther Hall in Fort Worth. The young kid who had been just short of playing in a band with Winter in Houston was thrilled. And when Meeker, through connections, got them an audience with Adrian Barber and Warner Brothers Records, they flew to New York to audition in a rehearsal room at the Ed Sullivan Theater. The band thought this was it! The audition, though, was a reality check.\n\n“I believe that the audition with Barber came about through one of Meeker’s contacts,” Mann related, “ maybe through Kristofferson or his manager. It was our first time in New York and we were not well prepared. I don’t mean so much the band, but in general. We were a bit overwhelmed, while being excited just to be in New York. We had to rent some shitty equipment that did not do the band justice, the room was small, and I remember feeling that we were not in control of the situation the way were accustomed to be. Barber and his associate asked us if we were going to see the Allman Brothers that night. I don’t think that any of us had even heard of them at that point.\n\n“The audition was okay, but it was more a few guys sitting around on uncomfortable chairs listening to Space Opera play on that shitty, rented equipment. The Allman Brothers dominated their conversation. They seemed surprised that we were not interested, but the guys were not social that way like a lot of musicians seem to be. I don’t recall them ever letting anyone sit in or them sitting in with anyone else. They were very focused on their music, and it served them well. In the end, I don’t think we made too big of an impression on Barber and Co. because it was not really a performance as much as an attempt by the band to show their obvious musicianship and songwriting ability. They may have been expecting something more polished.”\n\nDirectly afterward, back in Texas, Space Opera headed back into the studio. “We recorded four songs at IRI,” said Bullock, “including the first versions of ‘Country Max’ and ‘Singers and Sailors.’ ‘Singers and Sailors’ was one of our most popular songs in the early Space Opera days. It was one of the few songs that Scott and I collaborated on, so it is special to me for that reason alone. We often showed each other new songs in his den, him at his mother’s Steinway and myself with my old Gibson J50. One day he played me this beautiful slow song in Dorian mode. Brett had played us an album by Denny Zeitlin earlier and I think that was the inspiration for this song. Scott had the piano parts and the refrain lyrics, ‘We’re singers, and we’re sailors, and we’ve been here for twenty years.’ He asked me to write the verses. I scribbled them on a yellow legal pad (I still have them) and we played it through. I suggested we also try it at a fast tempo, a rock version. It sounded good both ways. We later recorded both versions at Exit 4 Studio and also played both onstage.”\n\n“Country Max” was to follow the band through a series of sessions, and for good reason. According to White, “Dave may have just been on point when he wrote that song. There was no conscious effort to do a quote/unquote commercial song. That was a period when Dave was hot and he probably, just through osmosis, absorbed the dynamics of what makes a hit single. And I’ll tell you this, wherever we played it, people reacted to it as though it was a hit.”\n\nThe IRI sessions also included two other originals, “Long Before the Fight Began,” written by Bullock, and Fraser’s “The Major.”\n\n“That batch from IRI was the first cohesive set Space Opera ever recorded,” Bullock noted. “The later Exit 4 versions were much more polished, but those earlier versions were the ones which established us on local radio.”\n\nThey turned the tapes over to KFAD-FM. KFAD immediately added it to their playlist and gave the band a good deal of exposure over the next year or so. Bullock pointed to Joe Nick Patoski, Phil Cook and Don Swancy for the help given by the station.\n\n“I’m flattered to hear that,” commented Joe Nick when contacted,” but to be honest, Phil Cook and Don Swancy had way more to do with their popularity than I did. Their album (the IRI tapes) was already being played and promoted on KFAD by the time I got there. Phil Cook was instrumental in breaking the band via the radio station as were Dave Thomas, Tim Spencer, I believe, and John Dillon.\n\n“All that said, Space Opera was the first progressive rock band to break out of Fort Worth during that period. Bloodrock, who emerged out of the same 1960s teen scene as did Space Opera, had greater success but trafficked in arena pop rock in the footsteps of Grand Funk Railroad, earning special notoriety by having one of the last teen tragedy pop hits with ‘D.O.A. (Dead On Arrival).’ If Fort Worth was New York two years later, Bloodrock was Blondie at C.B.G.B.’s and Space Opera was the Talking Heads, a collaborative effort that was all art, using rock as the foundation to explore more exotic, classical and experimental sounds as few bands were.\n\n“If it had been another time or another place, more people would be having this conversation about Space Opera. As it is, they were a cult band with all the right ingredients.”\n\nThat cult status grew until Space Opera was backing the biggest names in the business including The Guess Who, Jethro Tull, Quicksilver and Jefferson Airplane.\n\n“We were booked to open for Jefferson Airplane on November 1, 1970 at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum in Fort Worth,” Bullock recounted. “For this concert we devised a set of music that would be totally seamless and continuous. Transitional elements, mostly instrumental, would tie the songs together and allow us time to reconfigure. It was to be a kaleidoscope of instrumental color and dynamics, from guitars/bass/drums to flute/grand piano/contrabass/vibes and everything in between.\n\n“We previewed the concert on KFAD by playing a live recording of the set, done in our rehearsal room. Phil Cook, the Program Director at KFAD, was the emcee at the concert. People knew our music from the radio and from other shows but had never heard them played in this unusual format. The concert was a great success.”\n\nAn earlier concert in September at the Dallas Fair Park Music Hall with Quicksilver followed a similar format and caused Cook to say “… right now, Space Opera is better than 80% of the new albums I review every week. Even after Quicksilver’s set, I still walked out singing ‘We are singers, we are sailors, and we’ve been here for 20 years…’”\n\nDuring that period, Claudia Wilson’s favorite show was Space Opera’s set opening for The Byrds at Panther Hall. “At first, I’m backstage because I’m with the band,” she said, “and then we’re out in the audience. I would give good money to know if The Byrds played the same encores everywhere they played or whether they were chosen specifically for that night. There were two tunes: ‘Mr. Spaceman’ and ‘So You Want To Be a Rock and Roll Star.’ To me, Space Opera and The Byrds were equals on the stage and Space Opera was so good that surely The Byrds realized that this was a group that had it. I thought they were impressed and kind of taken aback, but I was so full of ego for the man I loved and the band that I loved that I thought they were invincible.”\n\nRick Benedict, musician and music enthusiast, was there that night as well. “That was the first time I saw Space Opera,” he wrote. “Roger McGuinn wore a cool cape jacket that night and when Space Opera played their last set, Scott Fraser was wearing it.”\n\nThat may have been the first time Benedict saw the band play, but the band was gaining popularity fast enough to also be included in the rumor mill. Benedict’s favorite: “It was rumored that when The Byrds’ Notorious Byrds Brothers album came out that the Mods or whoever they were at that time played the whole album the Wednesday night of the following week.” If true, an accomplishment Benedict thought impressive, as would others.\n\nShortly after the Jefferson Airplane gig, an opportunity to record at Exit 4 Studios in Dallas presented itself. A solid year playing before audiences of all sizes and their experiences in three studios gave them confidence. It was time.\n\n“(The IRI tapes) were getting us a lot of attention,” remarked Bullock, “but they were a bit crude and definitely outdated.”\n\nThey entered Exit 4 November of ’70 and by March had a completed album in hand.\n\n“It was a really good representation of the band at that time,” Bullock continued, “and we would have been happy to release it but weren’t able to find an outlet. But it did attract interest at Columbia and helped us move to a different level.”\n\n“We did that album before the Epic album, in Dallas,” confirmed White in a recent interview, “but decided it wasn’t up to our specifications, excellence-wise, so we shelved it. I heard it a couple of years ago (I happened to come across an old diesel-powered tape machine or something) and played it, and it is spectacular. It’s fabulous. But at that time, it just shows that the bar was set very high— by ourselves and for ourselves.”\n\n“Exit 4 Studio was on Fitzhugh Avenue, at that time exit 4 off Central Expressway,” recalled Bullock. “The studio had two Scully 8-track recorders. It was a nice, comfortable studio, warm sounding. We recorded the up-tempo and slow versions of ‘Singers and Sailors.’ We made the slow version in one take, all together in the studio. Scott played piano, Phil played upright bass, Brett played vibraphone, and I played flute. The song had three-part vocals, too. The Exit 4 album as a whole was looser than the Columbia album, and had less 12 string density, some great bluesy solos by Scott, loads of harmony – a nice balance of earthiness and spacey-ness.”\n\nThey began shopping for a label.\n\n“I don’t remember who we sent the demo to,” said Mann, “but I do remember the studio engineer, Dean Acheson (who had engineered the IRI sessions), and the producer, Roger Bland. They were both nice guys and somewhat in awe of the band’s talent and recording savvy. Dean was much the typical recording engineer, even to the point of wearing a pocket protector in his shirt pocket. Roger Bland’s claim to fame was that he was somehow connected to the Four Seasons and had something to do with record distribution. That was why I was interested in him and anything he could help me with.”\n\nClaudia Wilson remembered the Exit 4 phase as a turning point. “They did Exit 4,” she said, “but when they finally landed the deal in Toronto, that was the major interest they were looking for. I’ve heard a lot of tape over the years and Exit 4 was good. There was material on that, talk about timeless, which made it onto the Epic album, if I recall.”\n\nFROM DEEP SOUTH TO THE FAR NORTH …\n\nThough things were going well enough in Texas, getting label people to take the band seriously was a hard task. A happenstance meeting with a booking agent planted the seed which took them to, of all places, Canada.\n\n“A Canadian agent, Jerry Hebsher, heard us play in Fort Worth and convinced us that our music would be well received in Canada, and we were ready to move on,” said Bullock. “Hebsher introduced us to John Brower, a promoter in Toronto.”\n\n“The move to Williamsville, New York was mostly serendipity,” Mann claims, “because we wanted to get the hell out of Fort Worth. I had met a guy from Rochester, New York who went to school at TCU. Now, all I knew about Rochester was that it was in New York. When I visited, I saw an ad in the paper for a place in Williamsville, just outside of Buffalo.” When Mann checked it out, it seemed perfect.\n\n“The location was chosen for its proximity to Toronto, where we planned to work,” commented Bullock. “We wanted to live in New York State but be free to cross into Canada when we needed to without going through immigration hassles.

He also built a basement studio for the band, used for rehearsals and basic demo tracks, and continued working as Space Opera’s engineer.”\n\n“The house sat on almost three acres of what once had been cherry and apple orchards,” continued Bullock, “so there were still plenty of fruit-bearing trees. There were several varieties of evergreens, big ones, all over the grounds. A perimeter of trees hid the house from the neighbors. There was a large clearing in back of the house, perfect for a croquet court, where we spent a lot of time during the summer. Rabbits and pheasants roamed about and there was a man-made pond under an arbor. When winter came, we found out why Buffalo is called the Snow Belt. Being from hot Texas, we loved that snow.”\n\nThe house also afforded Cass Edwards room to build. “Our rather complete 4-track studio in this house Hans P"
