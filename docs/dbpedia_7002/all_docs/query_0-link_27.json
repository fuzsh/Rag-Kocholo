        "text": "The purpose of this paper is to present the project “Medicalia Online”, developed at the University of Parma. The project, linked to the “Corpus of the Greek Medical Papyri Online” (CPGM), aims at creating an electronic lexical database of the technical terms attested in the Greek papyri of medical content, with particular attention to their evolution and survival into contemporary scientific discourse. Papyri are, in general, a treasure trove of linguistic information, and medical papyri, such as recipes, fragments of treatises or catechisms, and private correspondence about health and diseases, offer rich attestations of a technical vocabulary, sometimes revealing a special terminology unattested in other medical sources. “Medicalia Online” is based on an interdisciplinary approach, which makes it significantly useful to all scholars working on Antiquity (papyrologists as well as archaeologists, classicists, historians of medicine, historians of language, and so on). This lexicographical tool presents an innovative structure and examines a selection of medical termini technici . The paper showshow an in-depth study of each term, carried out on the thorough analysis of all the available sources, allows a better definition of its scientific meaning and promotes the contextual and philological interpretation of medical texts on papyrus, as their exegesis is critically dependent on the understanding of technical terminology.\n\nTerms like “thesaurus”, “taxonomy”, “classification”, “glossary”, “ontology” and “controlled vocabulary” can be used in diverse contexts, causing confusion and vagueness about their denotation. Is a thesaurus a tool to enrich a writer’s style or an indexing tool used in bibliographic retrieval? Or can it be both? A literature study was to clear the confusion, but rather than giving us consensus definitions, it provided us with conflicting descriptions. We classified these definitions into three domains: linguistics, knowledge management and bibliographic retrieval. The scope of the terms is therefore highly dependent on the context. We propose one definition per term, per context. In addition to this intra-conceptual confusion, there is also inter-conceptual vagueness. This leads to the introduction of misnomers, like “ontology” in the Gene Ontology. We examined some important (bio)medical systems for their compatibility with the definitions proposed in the first part of this paper. To conclude, an overview of these systems and their classification into the three domains is given.\n\nHealthcare Information Systems should capture clinical data in a structured and preferably coded format. This is crucial for data exchange between health information systems, epidemiological analysis, quality and research, clinical decision support systems, administrative functions, among others. Structured data entry is an obstacle for the usability of electronic health record (EHR) applications and their acceptance by physicians who prefer to document patient EHRs using &quot;free text&quot;. Natural language allows for rich expressiveness but at the same time is ambiguous; it has great dependence on context and uses jargon and acronyms. Although much progress has been made in knowledge and natural language processing techniques, the result is not yet satisfactory enough for the use of free text in all dimensions of clinical documentation. In order to address the trade-off between capturing data with free text and at the same time coding data for computer processing, numerous term..."
