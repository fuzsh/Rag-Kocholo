        "text": "Summary Background: It is 50 years since the International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP) Societies approved the formation of a new Technical Committee (TC) 4 on Medical Information Processing under the leadership of Professor Francois Grémy, which was the direct precursor of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). Objectives: The goals of this paper are to give a very brief overview of early international developments leading to informatics in medicine, with the origins of the applications of computers to medicine in the USA and Europe, and two meetings - of the International Society of Cybernetic Medicine, and the Elsinore Meetings on Hospital Information Systems—that took place in 1966. These set the stage for the formation of IFIP-TC4 the following year, with later sponsorship of the first MEDINFO in 1974, setting the path for the evolution to IMIA. Methods: This paper reviews and analyzes some of the earliest research and publications, together wi...\n\nTo introduce the paper by Kuhn et al. &quot;Informatics and Medicine: From Molecules to Populations&quot; and the papers that follow on this special topic in this issue of Methods of Information in Medicine, which opens a debate on the Kuhn et al. paper&#39;s assertions by an international panel of invited researchers in biomedical informatics. An introductory summary and comparative review of the Kuhn et al. paper and the debate papers, with some personal observations. The Kuhn et al. paper makes a strong case for interdisciplinary education in biomedical informatics across institutions at the graduate level, which could be strengthened by analysis of previous relevant interdisciplinary experiences elsewhere, and the challenges they have faced, which point to more pervasive and earlier-stage needs for both education and practice bridging the research and healthcare communities. The experts debating the Kuhn et al. paper strongly and broadly support the key recommendation of develop...\n\nHumans have devised machines to replace computation by individuals since ancient times: The abacus predated the written Hindu–Arabic numeral system by centuries. We owe a quantum leap in the development of machines to help problem solve to the British mathematician Charles Babbage who built what he called the Difference Engine in the mid-19th century. But the Turing formula created in 1936 is the foundation for the modern computer; it produced printed symbols on paper tape that listed a series of logical instructions. Three decades later, Olivetti manufactured the first mass-marketed desktop computer (1964), and by 1981, IBM had developed the first personal computer. Computing machines have become more and more powerful, culminating recently in Google’s claim that it had achieved quantum supremacy in developing a system that can complete a task in 200 seconds that it would take the most powerful type of classical computer available 10 000 years to achieve. In short, we are in a peri..."
