        "text": "Industrial Effluents entering the water bodies is one of major sources of environmental toxicity. It not only affects the quality of drinking water but also has deleterious impact on the soil microflora and aquatic ecosystems. Soil is the most favourable habitat for a wide range of microorganisms that includes bacteria, fungi, algae, viruses and protozoa. Industries keep on releasing effluents,\n\nHealthy agro-and natural ecosystems are very crucial factors for the survival of all living organisms. Without ecosystems thriving, we cannot expect for a harmless environment and stable climate. Due to indiscriminate increase in human population and overexploitation of natural resources, ecosystems are deteriorating continuously and impacting negatively the earth's biodiversity. There are ample scientific proofs that agro and natural ecosystems are unsustainable for living organisms including human beings. Huge quantity of effluents containing highly toxic chemical such as pesticides and heavy metals are polluting the aquatic ecosystems including rivers, ponds and lakes. The rapid industrialisation and use of synthetic chemicals in augmenting agricultural yields are the major causes for the disturbances of various ecosystems sustenance. Consequently, global biodiversity is currently facing an imminent state of danger and scientific communities are concerned about the removal of recalcitrant hazardous pollutants from the environment in a more sustainable way. Microbes with their inherent metabolic potential, as a unique bio-resource, can be exploited for various ecosystems services such as bio-geochemical cycling, green house gas mitigation, restoration of degraded aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, etc. In this opinion article an attempt has been made to elaborate the role of diverse microbial groups in various ecosystems services.\n\nSoil is hosting a tremendous microbial diversity playing a key-role in a number of soil ecosystemic services including nutrient cycling, soil filtration,... The European Soil Framework Directive clearly identifies agricultural practices, including pesticides, as a major threat for soil biodiversity. In order to guarantee minimum effects of pesticide application on soil microbes, pesticide registration at EU level (Regulation 2006/388) considers the toxicity of pesticides onto non target soil microbes by relying on carbonand nitrogen-mineralization tests (OECD 216, 217). These tests do not provide a comprehensive assessment of pesticides soil microbial toxicity. Thus more comprehensive tools are required to reliably estimate the toxicity of pesticides onto soil microbes. ECOFUN-MICROBIODIV is a SEE.ERA.NET-funded project aiming to develop and evaluate innovative tools to estimate the impact of low-dose herbicides (sulphonylureas) on soil functional microbial diversity. The project is..."
