The advent of petaflop computational resources and the fast-paced progress in coarse-grained modeling create unprecedented opportunities for simulating processes that span a vast range of time and length scales, such as cell signaling and molecular transport. These computational studies will allow us to investigate normal and aberrant properties of protein-protein and protein-membrane complexes in atomic detail. Other areas of interest include the basis of allosteric communication in signaling complexes, enzyme catalysis, molecular recognition and drug design. We develop and apply a variety of computational techniques, including classical and advanced molecular and Brownian dynamics simulations, structural bioinformatics, binding free energy calculations and related methods. Results from these studies will be the engines of new concepts and hypotheses to drive discovery efforts and experimental work.\n\nFor more information, contact Dr. Abebe at:\n\nEmail: [email protected] or http://www.uth.tmc.edu/agorfe_lab/\n\nBack to Top\n\nAnanth Annapragada, PhD, Associate Professor, Health Information Sciences, UTHSC-H.

B.S., The University of Texas at Austin, 1988; M.S., Georgetown University, 1989; and Ph.D., The Johns Hopkins University, 1993. Dr. King’s dissertation focused on identifying the statistical properties of applying frailty survival models to the investigation of length of life in the Old Order Amish. Dr. King continued her professional training with a post-doctoral fellowship under the guidance of Dr. Chris Amos at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. During her post-doctoral fellowship she continued research on the statistical properties of model for the analysis of clustered survival data as well as conducting research on the use of phenotypes derived by principal components models in linkage analysis. She initiated a family study examining the genetics of a cellular biomarker, for which she received funding under the R-03 program. She continued at UTMDACC as an Assistant Professor and in 1997, she was awarded a K-07 award from the National Cancer Institute. As part of that award, she completed coursework in theoretical statistics at Rice University. In the final two years of her K-07, she held a joint appointment between UTMDACC and Genometrix, Inc. located in The Woodlands, TX. During this appointment, she was responsible for the development of statistical protocols for the analysis of microarray data as well as manufacturing quality control metrics. In addition, she developed clinical research databases, which were fully integrated with genetic and genomics data generated by microarrays. The position at Genometrix, Inc was not an academic position and this is reflected in her publication and grant record. In 2001, she chose to re-enter the academic field and joined the faculty of The University of Texas Houston Medical School as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Medical Genetics. This appointment has permitted her to transition her career focus from genetic epidemiology to statistical genetics. Her research interests are in the development of multivariate analytic techniques integrating phenotypic, genetic and genomic information.

Dr. Lee is Board Certified Diplomat, American Board of Internal Medicine. The Laboratory of Angel Lee, M.D., Ph.D., focuses on understanding how signaling pathways activated by receptor tyrosine kinases regulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. There are two areas of interest. The first is in hematopoietic systems (myeloid progenitors and bone marrow-derived macrophages) and is directed at the signaling pathways downstream of the Colony Stimulating Factor-1 Receptor (CSF-1R). We are specially interested in basic mechanisms that could provide a basis for therapeutic intervention in cancers involving receptor tyrosine kinases. As the CSF-1R is a key receptor for macrophages, we are also very interested in how CSF-1R mediated pathways in myeloid cells contribute to diseases with a chronic inflammatory component such as cancer (tumor associated macrophages). The second area of interest is the role of signaling molecules and scaffolding proteins in neurogenesis, using murine embryonic stem cells and primary neural stem cells as models. In this project, we are interested in determining what governs neural stem cell proliferation and fate specification, in the hopes that our findings will provide information useful in areas of brain injury and repair. Given the complexity of the systems we study, my lab will be adopting a systems biology approach. The aim is to integrate experimental findings from genomics and proteomics with computational analysis and consider the participating molecules as part of a network. This approach should provide novel insights into cancer and those insights may lead to new drug developments and better understanding and design of complicated drug regimens.\n\nFor more information, contact Dr. Lee at:\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nBack to Top\n\nHelen Li, MD; Adjunct Associate Professor, Health Information Sciences, UTHSC-H, Associate Professor, Dept. of Ophthalmology, Director, Vitreoretinal Diseases and Surgery, Dept. of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.

BRL aims to enable new discovery methodologies employing massively parallel sequencing and other high-throughput genomic technologies. A recent research initiative is the construction of the Epigenome Atlas as part of the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The Genboree Discovery System is the largest software system developed at BRL. Genboree is a turnkey software system for genomic research. The Epigenomics Data Analysis and Coordination Center and a number of collaborative epigenomic projects use Genboree as the core informatic infrastructure. Our Positional Hashing method, implemented in the Pash program, enables extremely fast and accurate high-volume sequence comparison and pattern discovery by employing low-level parallelism. By being able to accurately analyze billions of sequence fragments from ChIP-seq, bisulfite-seq and other *-seq assays performed in the course of the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative project, we anticipate to be able to gain insights into the interplay between human genetic and epigenetic variation.
