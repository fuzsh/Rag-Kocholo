        "text": "These eerie photographs show the abandoned hometown of Michael Jackson - with iconic landmarks of the once great steel city of Gary, Indiana, left to decay after decades of decline.\n\nSitting 25 miles from Chicago and dubbed The City of the Century, the King of Pop’s birthplace once had a peak population of 178,000 residents, but this has since dwindled to only 78,000.\n\nThe images show the city’s once renowned Methodist Church as well as the Palace Theatre, dilapidated and deserted, largely thanks to the rise and fall on the steel industry.\n\nProviding Gary with rapid growth during the first half of the 20th century, the steel mills - where the musician’s father Joe forged a living before Jackson 5’s rise to fame - made up for much of the city’s economy.\n\nHowever, the former industrial city has since fallen on hard times and is now largely abandoned, with 20 per cent of properties in 2015 recorded as vacant, and many of its inhabitants have moved away following the decline of the steel industry in the 1960s.\n\nPhotographer Johnny Joo, 28, from Cleveland, said: ‘Gary is currently inching its way to becoming a ghost town. But the city holds so much forgotten life, often disregarded by visitors who only see gloomy streets and a history of corruption. People often fail to think about the families that shaped their lives around the city they knew growing up.’"
