That was a few years ago, so don't know if that is still the case. When the brothers had their reality show (A Family Dynasty), Tito & Marlon went into the house and it was empty. That was around 2009 though. Around 2 or 3 years ago, Janet & Randy was filmed going to the house, but the inside wasn't shown. There's a thread here about it.\n\n2300 Jackson Street, Gary, Indiana\n\nDoes anyone know if the street was always named Jackson Street, or if it was renamed in honor of the Jackson family? What was the name of the street when all the Jackson kids were growing up in Gary? Was it Jackson Street just by coincidence? What year was it changed to Jackson Street? Does the Jackson family still hold any rights to the house at all?\n\nIt was always named Jackson Street, long before the Jacksons moved there. The house is an asset which belongs either to the family, or the MJ Estate (ownership details are unclear). The house next door has been purchased and renovated either by the family, or by the Estate - it's a dual compound now. The house across the road was also purchased/renovated at around the same time. There were original ideas to create a small museum and souvenir store in the house beside the Jackson family home, but the Mayor of Gary is opposed to this idea, therefore it hasn't happened as yet. The entire area has a reputation for being run-down, abandoned, dilapidated and unsafe for visitors. There appears to be a lack of interest in, or funding for anything more than renovating, securing and maintaining these properties. They look very well cared for, in stark contrast to the rest of the neighbourhood."
