Jackson bought the animal from a Texas research facility in the 1980s. The animal was a frequent travel companion to the singer. Their human-animal bond, as well as the entertainer's other alleged eccentricities, contributed to the media epithet \"Wacko Jacko\", a nickname Jackson would eventually come to despise. The media often focused on Bubbles, rather than on Jackson's music, and published many false stories regarding the animal. One such story was an allegation that Bubbles was not a single ape, but one of several.\n\nDeath\n\nJackson died at age 50 on June 25, 2009 at 2:25pm at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.
