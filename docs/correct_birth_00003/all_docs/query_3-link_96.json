        "text": "Born in 1961, Michael Jackson studied at Blackpool and Fylde College,where he earned\n\nMichael Jackson Painting in studiohis degree in Natural History Illustration. After working for five years as an advertising illustrator and part-time teacher, he took the decision to devote his time and energies to become the specialist in wildlife and portraiture that he is today.\n\nJackson’s work reflects both classical and modern interpretations fused within one painting. His influences range from the Renaissance, the masters of the nineteenth century, and Contemporary Art. With superb technique, he infuses a harmony between the natural and the conceptual, to create works that are provocative and dramatic.\n\nJackson’s quest for inspiration leads him to travel the world in pursuit of the subject matter that fuels his passion to paint. He chooses to explore those countries that provide opportunities for observing the wonderful multiplicity of wildlife. He is a committed conservationist, and has worked with charities such as Fauna & Flora International, The Rainforest Foundation and Care for the Wild, amongst many others.\n\n“ The privilege of observing people and animals in their natural habitat and environment is both awe-inspiring and humbling. It has continued to inspire and influence my work, allowing me to explore a variety of interpretations within the constraints of the genre. Today, with the rapid decline in species and the loss of native habitat, it is more important than ever to keep these subjects at the forefront of contemporary art.” Michael Jackson\n\nAbout Michael:\n\n“I am a British artist, and 14 years ago made the decision to move to SW France, where I now live and work.\n\nDuring this time I have been evolving as an artist, it is a maturation, a manifestation of skills acquired during a life time devoted to art.\n\nTo continue in the same vein without exploring new avenues of expression, is not just boring, but actually totally stifles my creativity. I see it as a natural process to experiment with different approaches and also using different media.\n\nI try to approach my art with no preconceived ideas of what to fully expect, sometimes I am surprised at where the journey takes me.\n\nIndeed, over the last five years I have been developing my skills as a sculptor, and I am excited and thrilled at the things I have conceived and made, if you would like to see my new work in more detail please follow the link to my sculpture web site, it will give you opportunity to view, what I know is a very unique and individual collection of elegantly eccentric, thought provoking art.”"
