Vol. 39, no. 1, pp.45-61. spring 1995.\n\nAbstract:World beat, a musical genre combining melodic and rhythmic features from various world cultures into a single form, has become commonplace in contemporary popular music, and has worked to break down cultural barriers. Implicit in its multilayered culturalism is the Futurist notion of a technologically generated utopia. In the past decade Music Television (MTV) has successfully capitalized on incorporating world beat into its programming, becoming a model that other artistic agencies have followed, as exemplified in the Michael Jackson music video Black and white and a recent theatrical production of Thornton Wilder’s play The skin of our teeth.\n\nStewart, Elizabeth and Theresa Buckland. Dance; music video. Parallel lines: Media representations of dance. London, England: Arts Council of Great Britain, 1993. 51-79 pp.\n\nAbstract: The role of dance in music video extends across a spectrum. At one end of the spectrum is the dramatic mode, where dance operates prominently s an expressive tool; at the other end is the fragmentary dance mage, nondiegetic, unconnected to the musical producers, and perhaps nly flitting briefly across the scene. Here the moving body interacts ith video technology to form abstract visual and rhythmic patterning. his style is rarely used to present the dancing pop star, since ilmic treatment of the star is constrained primarily by the onstructive techniques of stardom. Videos featuring Kate Bush, Paula bdul, Michael Jackson, and Janet Jackson are analyzed.\n\nTischer, Rolf. “Heal the World”: Religion in der kommerziellen Rock- und Popmusik am Beispiel von Michael Jackson.Gotteslob im Klang der Zeit: Rolf Schweizer zum 65. Geburtstag München: Strube, 2001. 122-142 pp. Abstract: The process of secularization would seem to be unstoppable in modern society, and yet there is a constant need for religiousness. This is reflected in contemporary pop and rock music. This is exemplified by a song and video clip by Michael Jackson: In Heal the world, he appears as a messiah. Such phenomena within supposedly superficial pop culture should be taken seriously.\n\nTucker, Mark. Behind the beat: Michael Jackson and Prince. ISAM newsletter. Vol. 14, no. 1, pp.12-14.
