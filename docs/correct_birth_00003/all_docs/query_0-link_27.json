        "text": "Michael Jackson's Childhood Home, Gary (must see)\n\nGary is also famous for being the birth town of the legendary Michael Jackson as well as his home during his childhood and the establishment of Jackson 5. Michael Jackson was born here in Gary on August 29, 1958 in a house located on 2300 Jackson Street. The family still owns the house. Here are sold T-shirts and pins with images of the pop star. There have been discussions between the local authorities and the Jackson family about creating a museum out of the house, but it has not happened yet.\n\nWant to visit this sight? Check out these Self-Guided Walking Tours in Gary . Alternatively, you can download the mobile app \"GPSmyCity: Walks in 1K+ Cities\" from Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
