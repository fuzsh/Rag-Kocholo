As you can see here the home is in wonderful shape and the lawn and landscape is well cared for.

From what I can see, he lived here until 1969 after he and his brothers group, The Jackson 5 had achieved great commercial success. The home is apparently currently owned by Latoya Jackson and another private party, but I couldn't find anything concrete to reinforce this information.",
