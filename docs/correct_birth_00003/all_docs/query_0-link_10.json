        "text": "GARY, Ind. (WNDU) - 2300 Jackson Street is where is all began — humble beginnings for what we know as a family musical dynasty that has sold out shows worldwide.\n\nBut this past weekend, they were back in the Hoosier State in their hometown of Gary.\n\nThe Jacksons have sold over 150 million records around the globe. They are members of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and have been honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nAnd let’s not forget that Jackie, Tito, and Marlon grew up as the big brothers of superstars Janet Jackson and younger brother Michael, the “King of Pop.”\n\nThe brothers were excited to be back home where it all began. Despite performing for fans worldwide, Gary still holds a special place in their hearts.\n\n“When you come home, you get a chance to see all your friends, plus we have family here as well,” Jackie said. “All the kids you grew up with, they come to the concerts, they come back stage and say, ‘Hello.’ So, it’s nice coming back to see your old friends you went to school with and teachers and also family members.”\n\n“Don’t forget this is where it all started, Gary was first!” Marlon added.\n\nFans have been locked in with the brothers for decades. Literally, even leaving locks of love on the fence at their childhood home.\n\nThe brothers reflected about what that love and respect from their fans mean after all these years.\n\n“It’s a good feeling to know that you meant to much to changing peoples lives or being a part of their lives, and they are showing their love through padlocks or whatever. They got us locked in,” Tito said.\n\n“We appreciate them letting us know that they appreciate the contribution that we’ve given the industry and being the soundtrack to people’s hearts to people’s lives around the world,” Marlon added.\n\nThe fans’ dedication remains the same. From the moment the beat dropped, the energy in Hard Rock Live was contagious.\n\nWhile they may be international superstars, it’s evident that they are brothers first, sharing laughs and jokes with each other throughout our interview.\n\nNext year, a new biopic titled “Michael” is set to be released. It’s about the journey of their late brother, known affectionately to most worldwide as the “King of Pop.”\n\nFor the first time ever, Michael Jackson will be portrayed by a member of the family — his nephew Jaafar, son of Jermaine.\n\nThe brothers say their nephew embodied Michael in a way no one has before, even being moved to tears when they got a first look at the film ahead of its April 2025 premiere.\n\n“I look at so many people, and they imitate Michael. And when I looked at Jaafar’s work, he’s not imitating Michael. He became Michael, and he is damn good,” Marlon said.\n\n“We saw on zoom call with Graham King they shot a little piece of Jaafar playing Michael. And when we all saw it, we cried,” Jackie added. “Tears came out of our eyes, he was that good.”\n\nThe brothers say that its in the genes — a magic touch only a Jackson could have.\n\nMusic is at the core of who the Jacksons are, and they say there is nothing else they’d rather to and will do for the rest of their lives.\n\nJacksons Forever!"
