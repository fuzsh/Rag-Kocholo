        "text": "GARY, Ind. (CBS) -- For the second anniversary this weekend of the death of Michael Jackson, his native hometown of Gary, Ind., will honor him with a tribute and candlelight vigil.\n\nThe City of Gary says in a news release that the King of Pop will be honored with a \"Memorial Tribute\" from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Saturday at the old Jackson family house, 2300 Jackson St.\n\nThe tribute will feature a showcase the Gary musical act \"A Beautiful Soul,\" as well as an open mic for poets, musicians, singers and artists.\n\nA candlelight vigil follows at dusk. Those attending are asked to bring their own candles.\n\n\"We host this event because Gary, Indiana, is Michael's hometown,\" said retiring Gary Mayor Rudy Clay. \"We anticipate that June 25 will generate a significant increase in visitors to the area. Gary loves Michael Jackson and the Jackson family. The world can expect a 'Tribute to Michael' every year in June in Gary, Indiana. The world is invited.\"\n\nFans worldwide were shocked on June 25, 2009, when Jackson's older brother, Jermaine, announced the icon's death.\n\nMourners quickly flocked to the Jackson family house in Gary that day. Some held vigil all night as they placed stuffed animals, signs of tribute and memorials that became a swelling sea.\n\nIn the days after Jackson's death, Mayor Clay called for making a Jackson family museum in Gary a reality, and also said he wanted Jackson buried in Gary. But Jackson was buried in the Forest Lawn Cemetery outside Los Angeles."
