        "text": "Michael Joseph Jackson was born on August 29, 1958, in Gary, Indiana. When he was 5 he joined four of his brothers in a musical group called the Jackson 5. In 1969 they signed a recording contract with Motown Records. They soon became stars with several hit songs, and Michael became the lead singer.\n\nWhile he sang and performed with the Jackson 5 he also made recordings on his own. By the late 1970s he began to pursue a career on his own. His first solo album, Off the Wall, appeared in 1979. It was the best-selling album of the year.\n\nIn 1982 Jackson released his album Thriller. It would become one of the biggest-selling albums of all time. Several songs on the album were hit singles as well, including “Thriller,” “Billie Jean,” and “Beat It.” The music video for the album showed off Jackson’s dancing abilities as well as his singing. Other albums included Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), HIStory: Past, Present, and Future, Book One (1995), and Invincible (2001).\n\nIn 1997 Jackson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Jackson 5. In 2001 he was inducted as a solo performer. In the 1990s, however, his reputation had begun to suffer. Some people thought that he acted oddly. He was accused of mistreating children and went on trial. He was found not guilty, but he lost much of his fortune during this period."
