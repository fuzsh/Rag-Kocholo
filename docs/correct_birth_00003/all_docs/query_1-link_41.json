        "text": "In his autobiography Moonwalk, Jackson said, while rehearsing with The Jackson 5, they “got hit, sometimes with a belt, sometimes with a switch” when they imperfectly performed.\n\nThe singer added his father was “real strict” and “something of a mystery”.\n\nIn Randy Taraborrelli’s book The Magic and the Madness, the author stated Jackson called his father in September 1988, after the book’s release, to apologise for some of the material in the autobiography.\n\nHe explained that he hadn’t written the book himself and that the critical content was written by “someone else,” making some of these comments somewhat confusing.\n\nIn addition, while some of Michael’s siblings have said these “beatings” were not abusive, but were just a form of discipline, Michael told Oprah Winfrey in 1993 he felt his youth was lonely and isolated.\n\nMichael gave his first public performance aged five singing Climb Every Mountain, when he was five-years-old.\n\nIn 1964, when Jackson was just six years old, he was brought into a band called the Jackson Brothers, formed by his father and included Jackie, Tito and Jermaine.\n\nMichael was originally just a background singer and performer, however he soon started singing lead vocals with Jermaine and the band’s name was changed to the Jackson 5."
