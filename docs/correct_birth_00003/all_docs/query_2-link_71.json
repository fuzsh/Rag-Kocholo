        "text": "Michael Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana on August 19, 1958. Michael 's father, Joe Jackson, worked as a crane operator at a steel mill and His mother, Katherine, took care of the family. The Jacksons were fairly poor and lived in a small house with just two bedrooms for eleven people. Michael had five brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy and three sisters Robbie, La Toya, and Janet. Michael was the third youngest with Randy and Janet both being younger. Both of his parents loved music. His dad played guitar and his mother sang and played the piano. All of the Jackson children were encouraged to study music from their childhood. Joe Jackson was a very strict as a father. He often hit and verbally abused their children if they disobeyed. Their neighborhood was sometimes a dangerous place for youngsters, Joe wanted them to stay out of trouble and away from gangs. As a child, Michael Jackson was soft spoken, an animal lover who secretly fed a mouse in the kitchen, and was shy and reserved like his mother. In 1963, at age of five, Michael Jackson began attending Garnett elementary school. One of the Michael’s first concerns performing at the age of five, when he sang ‘Climb Every Mountain’ from The Sound of Music a cappella for his class. The other children were impressed as much by his self-confidence as by his talent; He had so much energy and charisma at age of five .Michael Jackson enjoyed being center of attention from his childhood. Dad, Joe Jackson"
