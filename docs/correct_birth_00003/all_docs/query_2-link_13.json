        "text": "Indiana is one of those states that most folks assume nothing’s ever come from; it’s a quiet, boring place, and all the greatest artists come from places like Los Angeles anyway, right? Wrong. Indiana’s actually been a fairly pivotal part of world history for a few reasons (there have been a TON of awesome inventions from Indiana), but there’s one particular claim to fame we’ve got that nobody else can possibly claim: the King of Pop was born here. In Gary. I know I know – Gary doesn’t have the best reputation, but in this case, it’s something to be celebrated. To this day, Michael Jackson’s childhood home is a place you can visit to honor the late musical icon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you’re interested in more fascinating Indiana firsts, you ought to check out this new list of awesome Indiana inventions.
