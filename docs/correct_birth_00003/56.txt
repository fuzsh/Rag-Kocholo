The death of Michael Jackson is being felt especially hard in Gary, Indiana. That’s where Jackson was born.

It all started in a tiny, single story home on 2300 Jackson Street. Michael and his brothers would practice night and day in the home. That practice led to worldwide fame for the family in the late 60s. Immediately after news of Jackson’s death broke, a large crowd gathered outside the home, placing flowers and teddy bears. Gary Mayor Rudy Clay says Jackson was special to the city.

CLAY: Michael Jackson was the most successful story to ever come out of the state of Indiana and especially Gary, Indiana. Our love for Michael will never wane.

Clay says the home may be part of a future museum dedicated to the music legend. Jackson last visited Gary in 2003.
