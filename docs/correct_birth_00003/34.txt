Since we were in the neighborhood shooting abandonment in nearby downtown Gary, we thought we'd drive over to Michael Jackson's boyhood home which was only a 6 or 7 blocks away. Upon arrival you immediately know which house it is as it is the only house around completely surrounded with a thick black fence. As you can see here the home is in wonderful shape and the lawn and landscape is well cared for. Outside the fence are makeshift memorials, one on the corner of 23rd and Jackson St. and the others are on the side facing 23rd Street near the home. Just inside the fence stands a large granite plaque that memorialized his life and history.

On August 29th, 1958, the King Of Pop was born into this small 3 room house to Katherine Esther Scruse and Joseph Walter "Joe" Jackson and would eventually include 5 brothers and 3 sisters. From what I can see, he lived here until 1969 after he and his brothers group, The Jackson 5 had achieved great commercial success. The home is apparently currently owned by Latoya Jackson and another private party, but I couldn't find anything concrete to reinforce this information.
