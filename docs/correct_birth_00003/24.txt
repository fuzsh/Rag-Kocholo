Gary is a city in Lake County, Indiana, United States. It famously served as the birthplace of the Jackson family, including Michael Jackson, who all lived in a house at the 2300 Jackson Street.

Background[]

Joe and Katherine Jackson moved to the house in Gary in 1950. The two got married a year prior and had previously lived in East Chicago.

The family had lived in the house up until May 1971, when Jacksons moved to the Hayvenhurst compund in Encino, California. This happened thanks to the commercial success of the Jackson 5. However, to this day the house is owned by the Jacksons.

Trivia[]

In 1989, the Jacksons released an album titled after the 2300 Jackson Street. This also featured a song of the same name, which featured multiple members of the family that weren't a part of the Jacksons band.

On the first anniversary of Michael's death, a plaque was put in the house's garden, in memorial of the artist. This plaque was removed in October of 2017 for unknown reasons. The locals accused Janet and Randy Jackson for supposedly removing it, as it was the same time as the two visited their family home.[1] Lt. Thomas Pawlak stated the department reached out to the family who told him, that it was taken down for a video shoot and that it would be put back up later. As of right now, the memorial is still missing.[2]
