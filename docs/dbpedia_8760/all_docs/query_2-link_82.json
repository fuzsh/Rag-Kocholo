        "text": "Post by revupminster on\n\nI worked at West Ham in the seventies and remember taking the takings from West Ham to Plaistow but it was not that unusual. The same happened between Shoreditch and Whitechapel. In the sixties as a small 16 year old I was sent from Embankment to Victoria to get a Â£100 bag of silver. They always had plenty and Embankment was always short. It was heavy and I used to stand in the train doorway with the bag between my feet. The Station Master at Shadwell used to walk through watney Street market to the bank and everybody knew what he had in his hand. He never used the poachers pocket of his uniform and always wore his uniform hat which he was not supposed to.\n\nPost by railtechnician on\n\n@reganorak said:\n\nI did a late shift Sunday in the ticket office there in c.1971. Hardly saw a soul. And as there was no safe to put the takings in, I had to take them in a bag by train to Plaistow. Unthinkable today that we had to do that, but nobody gave it a second thought.\n\nI recall working at West Ham station, apparently a dodgy and/or dangerous place day and night back then in the 1980s.\n\nWhen working there during the day I parked my car in the adjacent housing estate for about half an hour while checking some new PA equipment. The station supervisor hinted that I'd be lucky to find the car intact even if I parked it there for five minutes so I was relieved to see that it had not been tampered with.\n\nWhen working there on night shift gaining access was a problem if arriving in non-traffic hours as the station supervisor used to lock himself into an office and leave the station to the contract cleaner.\n\nApparently the booking office had been robbed more than once and the supervisor was scared of his own shadow, let alone that of anyone else.\n\nIt was the cleaner that told me not to park the company transit van right outside the station as it was bound to be broken into as some contractors had learned to their cost, so I parked it about 100 yards down the road at his suggestion under a street lampo which proved to be quite safe.\n\nI recall a few week earlier working at Plaistow one night and having a van load of material to unload. We parked up right outside the station entrance and went in to see the supervisor, as we exited to unload less than 5 minutes later we were greeted by two policemen who had caught a villain in the act of TDA our van. They told us never to leave a van unguarded even for a second at that and several other stations between there and Upminster.\n\nI knew of several staff losing vehicles or items within them to vandals and thieves at the east end of the District although luckily in many years of using my own car and parking it at or near stations on all lines for decades I never had any trouble at all until I worked out of Bollo House, Acton and discovered that while I was out working some scroat had been trying to break into my car inside the 'secure' staff car park. ISTR one of the operating managers taking a severe beating when challenging someone tampering with private vehicles there one night."
