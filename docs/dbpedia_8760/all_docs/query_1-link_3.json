        "text": "Located in East London, West Ham isn’t quite what it first appears to be: though there are some rougher areas, it is actually a great place with a lot of amenities.\n\nHomes here tend to be well built and slightly larger than in other neighborhoods; many have small yards or communal green space. West Ham is home to many City workers since it's a fairly quick commute, small families attracted by the terrific schools here, and to a large population of immigrants.\n\nTheir presence has created a culinary melting pot – there are dozens of dining options here offering all types of cuisine, from British pub food to Caribbean to Indian. There are also a lot of fast food joints around.\n\nWest Ham is a neighborhood that continues to get better and better as the community works together on improvement. The past few years have brought many promising new small businesses into the area, including independent restaurants and shops that have people coming from miles around.\n\nWest Ham is bordered on the north by Forest Gate, on the east by Upton Park, on the south by Plaistow, and on the west by Stratford."
