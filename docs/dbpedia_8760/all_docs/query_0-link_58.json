It is set on a tapering plinth of rough-hewn stone, the front face of which bears the World War 1 inscription in lead lettering. The plinth is set on a two-stepped stone base, against which rests a rectangular stone tablet that bears the names of those who died in World War 2. The memorial stands in a paved area, surrounded by a low chain fence, in the grounds of St Luke's Church in Stone Cross.
