        "text": "©Imago/Content stadium\n\nWest Ham have confirmed their first major signing of the 2024/25 season, with the arrival of Brazilian midfielder Luis Guilherme from Palmeiras. The 18-year-old talent has reportedly been signed in a deal in the region of an initial €20m, with another €7m of potential add-ons. Guilherme will make the move to West Ham as the club’s ninth most expensive signing ever, narrowly coming in above Nikola Vlašić’s move from CSKA Moskow in 2021.\n\nHowever, unlike West Ham’s typical policy of signing ready-made Premier League stars or prospects from Europe’s top leagues, Guilherme will make the move to London as a relatively unknown quantity. And for the aforementioned sizable sum of money the club are spending on him, West Ham fans would be forgiven for wanting to know all they can about their new star midfielder ahead of next season. So let’s take a look at what Guilherme has done in Brazil and what West Ham fans can expect.\n\nWhere will Luis Guilherme play for West Ham?\n\nSince he made his debut for the club in March of last year, Guilherme has established himself as a handy squad player, capable of playing a number of positions. Over the course of the last two seasons, Guilherme has played on the left wing, right wing, through the middle and even at times as a striker. But, despite being capable of playing a number of roles, there may be a position that suits him best at West Ham next season. “He plays mainly as a right-sided midfielder or a right winger,but has the ability to play in the left and has been even better as a central attacking midfielder,” noted Marcos Watts, Transfermarkt Area Manager for Brazil. “I see him as a proper no.10 in the future.” This will clearly be music to the ears of West Ham fans, who will rightfully be concerned that they may start next season without their star No.10, Lucas Paquetá, who was recently charged on four accounts of potential betting breaches, by the English FA. Should Paquetá face a lengthy ban, Guilherme may be just the man to step in for West Ham next season.\n\nHow good is Luis Guilherme?\n\nDue to the player’s remarkably young age, it’s difficult to get a clear idea of how good Guilherme actually is. In 45 appearances for Palmeiras across all competitions, the midfielder has managed just one goal and one assist. While his nine appearances for the Brazilian national team’s youth sides have offered up just two goals. But, according to Watts, such figures shouldn’t put West Ham fans off a player with immense potential. “He is a very good player, with potential to be great,” noted the Brazilian football expert. “He might be one of the best players in this new generation of Brazilian wonderkids. He might not have reached the same level of development as his fellow teammates Endrick or Estêvão, but that's the life of a midfielder/winger sometimes. A move to England - especially to a club outside of the big six - might just set him up in the best environment and give him the perfect amount of time and pressure he needs, all while playing in the best league in the world.”\n\nPlayer Comparison\n\nLuis Guilherme\n\nEndrick\n\nWest Ham United\n\nReal Madrid\n\n€24.00m\n\nMarket Value\n\n€60.00m\n\n18\n\nAge\n\n18\n\nRight Winger\n\nPosition\n\nCentre-Forward\n\nJun 30, 2029\n\nContract until\n\nJun 30, 2030\n\nFull Player Comparison"
