        "text": "West Ham are one of London's more successful clubs, with a rich history and solid Premier League consistency.\n\nSince the Premier League's inception, the Hammers have been participants in England's top flight for 26 of the league's 30 seasons. West Ham have also participated in eight cup finals, with six of those coming since 1960.\n\nDavid Moyes finally tasted glory as Hammers boss as Jarrod Bowen's late goal secured a 2-1 Europa Conference League final win over Fiorentina.\n\nSuccess in Prague is West Ham's first major trophy since 1980 and their first European title since 1965.\n\nMORE: Last time West Ham reached a final for FA Cup, EFL Cup, and UEFA competitions\n\nPremier League (First Division)\n\nTitles: 0\n\nWest Ham's highest finishing position in the top tier is third, in the 1985/86 season. Their team in the early 1980s was consistent in their league placings, promoted to the highest echelon in 1981 and making the top half of the league for the next four seasons.\n\nThe club's best-ever finish in the Premier League era (since 1992) is 5th, which they accomplished in 1998/99.\n\nBUY TICKETS: West Ham and Tottenham pre-season tour of Perth, Australia\n\nEnglish Second Division (Championship)\n\nTitles: 2\n\nYears won: 1957/58, 1980/81\n\nWest Ham secured promotion to the then-First Division by winning the Second Division title twice over, once in 1957/58, under the management of Ted Fenton, and once in 1980/81. The club have never fallen any lower than the second tier of league competition.\n\nFA Cup\n\nTitles: 3\n\nYears won: 1963/64, 1974/75, 1979/80\n\nManager Ron Greenwood masterminded the club's first FA Cup win, with his assistant John Lyall taking over in 1974 and leading the team to their second. The side he named in the 1975 final was the last all-English one to lift the trophy - and their opponents Fulham had West Ham legend Bobby Moore in their line-up.\n\nThe 1980 FA Cup triumph is significant not only because Trevor Brooking scored the winner with an unlikely header, but also because West Ham became the last team to win the trophy outside the top division of domestic competition.\n\nMORE: Declan Rice transfer news updates, reports and rumours with Arsenal, Man United chasing West Ham captain\n\nLeague Cup (EFL Cup, Carabao/Carling Cup)\n\nTitles: 0\n\nStrangely, West Ham have never won the League Cup in any of its many guises. They finished as runners-up twice, though, in 1965/66 and 1980/81.\n\nFA Community Shield (Charity Shield)\n\nTitles: 1\n\nYears won: 1964\n\nFA Cup holders West Ham played First Division champions Liverpool at Anfield for the FA Charity Shield in August 1964. The match ended in a 2-2 draw - with Johnny Byrne and Geoff Hurst scoring for the Hammers - and so the trophy was shared, as was customary at that time.\n\nEuropean Cup Winners' Cup\n\nTitles: 1\n\nYears won: 1964/65\n\nWest Ham achieved European glory in 1965, lifting the Cup Winners' Cup at Wembley stadium after beating 1860 Munich courtesy of two goals from Alan Sealey.\n\nSee unmissable football this July – Spurs and West Ham only in Perth, Australia\n\nUEFA Intertoto Cup\n\nTitles: 1\n\nYears won: 1999\n\nThis strange European competition featured teams from all over the continent and resulted in three two-legged finals, with the winners proceeding to the UEFA Cup. West Ham won their final against Metz 3-2 on aggregate - losing their first leg at Upton Park 1-0 with Louis Saha scoring for the visitors, but winning 3-1 away with goals from Trevor Sinclair, Frank Lampard, and Paulo Wanchope.\n\nOf course, West Ham fans also claim the club also won the World Cup. When England lifted the trophy in 1966, it was a famous Hammer, Bobby Moore, who did so - and it was two Hammers on the scoresheet, Geoff Hurst with his celebrated hat-trick and Martin Peters.\n\nThe Intertoto Cup was discontinued after the 2008 edition.\n\nEuropa Conference League\n\nTitles: 1\n\nYears won: 2023\n\nAfter losing out in the Europa League semifinals in 2022, Moyes rallied his troops in the Europa Conference League in 2023, as they gritted out a route to the final.\n\nDespite being slight underdogs against Serie A side Fiorentina, Moyes' team held their nerve in the closing stages at the Fortuna Arena, as Bowen wrote his name into club history.\n\nPremier League 2023/24 TV channels, live streams\n\nMORE: Watch every Premier League match in Canada on Fubo\n\nRegion TV Streaming Australia — Optus Sport Canada —\n\nFubo Canada\n\nHong Kong — Now TV India Star Sports Disney+, Hotstar,\n\nJioTV Malaysia Astro SuperSport Astro Go New Zealand Sky Sport Sky Sport Now,\n\nSky Go Singapore StarHub StarHub TV+ UK Sky Sports, BT Sport NOW TV, Sky Go,\n\nAmazon Prime USA USA Network,\n\nTelemundo, Universo Fubo, Peacock\n\nUK: Matches are carried across Sky Sports and BT Sport streaming and TV platforms, with select matches on Amazon Prime.\n\nUSA: Select matches are televised on USA Network (English) and Telemundo or Universo (Spanish), and all three channels can be streamed on Fubo.
