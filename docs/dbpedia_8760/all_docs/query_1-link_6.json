        "text": "If you've started watching Netflix's new teen thriller, chances are you're already addicted. The Society, which tells the story of a group of high schoolers who suddenly find themselves alone in their wealthy New England town, is gripping, intense, and the perfect show to fill the Riverdale-sized hole in your life after the finale next week. Of course, like Riverdale, you probably walked away from The Society with SO many questions (namely, will there be a season two?). One of the biggest queries taking the fandom is something we get with a lot of fictional shows: Is the town of West Ham, where The Society is set, real?\n\nWell, don't worry, because I did some geographical research and I've got ALL the answers for you.\n\nIs West Ham real?\n\nWest Ham does exist, but it's not in Connecticut, like the show suggests. There is a district called West Ham in East London. The name will also sound familiar to soccer fans thanks to the West Ham United Football Club, which is based in East London.\n\nWhere is the fake West Ham Located then?\n\nDespite the fact that West Ham, London exists, that's not where The Society is based. The show is instead set in Connecticut. The characters mention their New England roots many times, and as a Connecticuter myself, I picked up on a lot of CT references in the show.\n\nCassandra, the student body president and de facto leader of the new society had plans to head off to Yale in the fall, a classic Ivy League choice for anyone from the Northeast. Also, when the busses are leaving West Ham to take the high schoolers to The Great Smoky Mountains for a week, they pass a sign for Fairfield, a town in Fairfield County in southwestern CT.\n\nFinally, once the teens realize they're alone in the town, Cassandra suggests they \"go to Greenwich to get help,\" another town in southern Connecticut.\n\nSo, we can assume West Ham is in southern CT, which probably doesn't mean much for most of you, but that pretty much suggests that all of the Connecticut stereotypes apply. These kids are rich and their spoiled lives got turned upside down when they had to fend for themselves.\n\nWhere is The Society filmed?\n\nDespite the fact that the show is set in Connecticut, it was, in fact, filmed in Massachusetts in the town of Lancaster, according to Telegram.com . Eagle-eyed horror fans will recognize the town from Hulu's Castle Rock or the movie Slender Man. Greta Gerwig's Little Woman adaption, which is set to come out this winter, was also filmed there.\n\nSo, if you're trying to explore the world of West Ham, may I suggest a trip to Lancaster, Mass or southern Connecticut. While you may not find a society made up of teenagers, you will definitely find some picturesque New England towns."
