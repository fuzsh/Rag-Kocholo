It exposed me to various events and organisations such as Kick It Out, leading me to my role at Crystal Palace where I lead on an award-winning programme.\"\n\nAaron Johnson\n\nCrystal Palace FC Divert Programme Lead, Youth Crime Intervention Specialist at Sutton Council\n\nPLACEMENTS WITH WEST HAM UNITED FOUNDATION\n\nStudents on our courses run in collaboration with West Ham United Foundation benefit on their vast network of projects and partner organisations. Students will take part in placements and collaborations meaning they graduate with a CV full of experience. This includes local primary and secondary schools as well as projects like Show Racism The Red Card.\n\nWest Ham United Foundation\n\nWest Ham United Foundation’s goals are to understand and meet the needs of the community and create an environment where all can thrive - from the heart of east London.\n\nThe Foundation uses a multi-layered and innovative approach to do this, centred around building partnerships and utilising insight and technology. In practice this may look like health initiatives helping those most vulnerable; providing mentoring, education and employment opportunities; keeping children and youths engaged and supported through sports and classroom provision; or giving people the opportunity to follow their football dreams on the pitch whilst gaining qualifications.\n\nOver the last few years, the Foundation has grown vastly, engaging with up to 50,000 people annually and working with colleagues from across the football sector to ensure the delivery of the best Football Club Community Schemes.\n\nOn my degree with UEL and West Ham United Foundation, I was given so many opportunities and insights that I wouldn’t have gotten elsewhere. Getting the opportunity to see what the sports industry looks like and hearing from experts each week was priceless. I think my highlight was the work experience and placements, without them I wouldn’t be in my current role working in sport.\"\n\nMo Ali\n\nSecond Year Student"
