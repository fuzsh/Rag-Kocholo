        "text": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\n中文\n\nThe London property market has been an investment hotspot because of its booming population and enhanced infrastructure under a number of redevelopment plans. West Ham is no exception, attracting buyers and tenants with its natural beauty and rising investment potential.\n\nRapid regeneration\n\nThe regeneration of West Ham has begun with a disused brownfield site. In 2020, the regeneration came into public’s attention when the award-winning developer Berkeley has set out ambitious sustainability goals for the construction process – to transformed disused industrial land into a 3,838-home development called TwelveTrees Park. There are also plans for commercial, education and entertainment facilities on the 26 acres of brownfield. RokhsanaFiaz, mayor of Newham, claimed the development was key to the regeneration of West Ham.\n\nUnlike developments that focus primarily on commercial values, TwelveTrees Park cleverly blends greenery and technology into resident’s city living to fulfil to the “connectedness” concept. More than half of the area has been preserved as a landscaped park and green open space, bringing the outdoors to life and rejuvenating residents with amazing natural scenery. WiFi is available in the 4.5-acre park to ensure friends and families are well connected when enjoying a picnic.\n\nEverything about TwelveTrees Park is dedicated to the connectedness and well being of residents. With buzzing cafés, bars and restaurants, and the community building hub at the centre, there is always something to do and a place to meet. The new Science School, which focuses on STEM education and caters for up to 1,000 students,offers after-hours events and excellent classes for everyone, while the community hub is the gathering point for a huge range of activities.\n\nOne of the best-connected districts in London\n\nAlthough West Ham is nature-bounded, it is not an isolated island. It is one of the best-connected districts in London, with two CBDs–the City of London and Canary Wharf –just minutes away from the West Ham Station. As a major interchange connecting five nearby rail and tube lines, West Ham is well-connected to the rest of London and beyond, making getting to and from work and leisure activities simple and convenient. It takes only seven minutes to get from West Ham Station to Canary Wharf, 18 minutes to Liverpool Street Station, and 25 minutes to King’s Cross St Pancras Station. And it’s just a 10-minute ride from the DLR at West Ham Station to London City Airport, providing unrivalled connections from doorstep to destination.\n\nWith the excellent accessibility to London, vibrant living is within easy reach at West Ham. The Westfield Shopping Centre, a buzzing shopping and leisure hub, with restaurants, bars and a cinema, is located in Stratford, which is only a three-minute ride away. The captivating mall is one of the largest urban shopping and leisure destinations in Europe, with a 17-screen multiplex cinema, bowling alley and a 24-hour casino, the biggest of its kind in the UK. Whether you are keen on shopping, eating or drinking, you will never get bored. Sports lovers in Stratford can capture the spirit of 2012 London Olympics at Olympic Park.\n\nQueen Elizabeth Olympic Park is now an exceptional public sports and leisure facility in Stratford. As well as treading in the footsteps of some of the world’s greatest athletes in a characteristic array of sports venues, including London Stadium, the London Aquatics Centre, the Copper Box Arena and Lee Valley VeloPark, you can explore its parklands, waterways, playgrounds and cafés – or experience the world’s longest tunnel (178m).\n\nTake the four-minute ride to North Greenwich and indulge yourself at O2, one of London’s premier sporting venues, as well as a new high-end shopping outlet and 4D cinema. Looking for a real adrenaline hit? Climb up the roof of the dome!\n\nThanks to the outstanding connectivity, world-class education is at your fingertips. Accessible within 30 minutes are the campuses of 12 of the top 100 UK universities, including the LSE, City University and UCL, providing access to further quality tertiary education for your children. It takes only 25 minutes on the tube to get from West Ham to Old Street Station, where Tech City is situated, housing the headquarters and offices of well-known tech giants such as Cisco, Amazon and Adobe, providing plenty of job-hunting opportunities and a convenient work location.\n\nHigh investment potential\n\nIn addition to the relaxing living environment and the well-established transportation network, the redevelopment plan improved West Ham’s infrastructure and amenities, fuelling a positive investment outlook. Rental yields are expected to reach 2.5% to 4.5%, while housing price are projected an increase 3.5% to 5.2% by 2023. And as sterling has remained weak in recent years, buyers can earn extra return by taking advantage of the exchange rate.\n\nTwelveTrees Park was crafted and designed by acclaimed architects Patel Taylor (Masterplan) and Atkins (Phase 1A) and developed by renowned developer Berkeley. Inspired by nature, the designers incorporated modern design into the green areas. Elegant and minimalist interiors in TwelveTrees Park were applied to enduring materials that will age beautifully. The use of soft tones of grey, ecru and white creates a harmonious home feeling for residents.\n\nThe 24-hour concierge service, multiple co-working areas, open ‘pod’ meeting areas and a private meeting room in the residents’ business lounge make life much better, coupled with a screening room, gym, restaurants and The Hub in the community. A selection of contemporary studio, 1, 2 and 3-bedroom apartments and penthouses are now available for sale. Studio price starts from £479,500, and 1-bed apartment price starts from £529,500."
