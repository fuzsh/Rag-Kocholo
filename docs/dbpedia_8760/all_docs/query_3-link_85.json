        "text": "West Ham United Football Camp will commence in July.\n\nIt takes place in London and is designed for children between 10 and 17 years of age of all levels of expertise. There are three programme alternatives according to skill level and a fourth specific programme designed exclusively for goalkeepers. There is also the possibility to incorporate English lessons into the programme.\n\nStudents will be training at the official West Ham United training grounds and staying at the University of East London's campus residence, known as the Sketch House.\n\nYou can choose a one-week programme or come for up to four weeks. On weekends, students will enjoy planned field trips and recreational activities.\n\nThis is an international camp that welcomes players from all over the world who are looking to advance their football skills. It is also a fantastic opportunity to improve your English, whether by simply living and breathing English football and culture or by making the most of the English lessons available.\n\nCoaches\n\nLicenses: UEFA A or UEFA B\n\nCoaching experience: Coaches are highly experienced in training youth players\n\nPlaying experience: The coaching staff includes some former professional footballers\n\nCoaching Language: English\n\nThe staff in charge of the camp's training sessions are official West Ham United coaches and highly experienced in training youth players.\n\nEvery coach has either a UEFA A or a UEFA B license, and some are even former professional footballers who have played for the club in the past.\n\nThe coaching staff is responsible for sorting students into groups according to their skill level, tracking the individual progress of every player, and analysing their strengths and weaknesses to ensure they fulfil their potential. They are also in charge of drawing up and delivering the performance report given to students on the final day of camp.\n\nSafety\n\nThe West Ham United Football Camp takes place in a safe and secure environment on the outskirts of London. Both the accommodation and sports facilities are private grounds and students are not allowed to leave the premises other than for training sessions and field trips.\n\nStudents are accompanied by the supervision team for every transfer, which ensures their safety and assists them with anything they might need. At the residency, students are monitored 24/7.\n\nStudents leave the residential premises every day to go to training and on weekends to go on different field trips where they will visit some of the many attractions London has to offer.\n\nMoreover, there are mandatory rules of conduct in place for all students (delivered before arrival) so as to ensure a safe and friendly environment for everyone.\n\nStudents from outside the UK must obtain the medical insurance provided by the camp, which will guarantee medical attention throughout the programme.\n\nThis is an excellent value for money programme. It is especially recommended for children with an intermediate level of football and English who are looking to travel abroad and immerse themselves in an international experience that allows them to practice their English and meet students from all over the world.\n\nThe programme's management staff is highly qualified and has extensive experience in camp planning.\n\nFurthermore, the optional English course is very high quality.\n\nThis programme is perfect for those looking to experience the game philosophy and training techniques of a top Premier League team like West Ham United first hand."
