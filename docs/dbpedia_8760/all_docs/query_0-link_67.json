        "text": "A £700,000 increase in Council Tax levies has been introduced by Wealden District Council without being properly scrutinised, claim opposition Conservative councillors.\n\nThe policy change which will affect residents was rushed in by the ruling Green Party/Lib Dem coalition which now runs Wealden.\n\nMoves to delay the introduction to give time for the usual scrutiny by councillors in committee was narrowly defeated, with three councillors abstaining.\n\nThe move means that those with second homes in Wealden or empty properties will between them be paying nearly three-quarters of a million pounds extra in council tax.\n\n“The matter was given to councillors with very little notice and without proper discussion”, said Conservative Dr Brian Redman who told the meeting that he’s been a Wealden councillor for 30 years and had never seen anything like this. “It is very worrying that this sort of thing can happen”, he added. “Especially on matters having huge financial implications for us for ever more.”\n\nAs another councillor told the meeting, “We appear to be having the scrutiny now that we should have had in scrutiny committee and it should be brought to that forum for a thorough airing.” A suggestion that a range of exemptions be discussed before any decision made but was out voted and the new policy was narrowly agreed.\n\nThe new charges will take effect once due notice has been given to those affected."
