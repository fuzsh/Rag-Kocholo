        "text": "You cannot call it an ugly stadium, the London Stadium, built as the Olympic Stadium for the 2012 Olympics. But we understand the objections of the loyal fans of West Ham United. It doesn't feel like a football stadium, nor is it an actual football stadium.\n\nAfter the Olympics, the City of London - led by then-Mayor Boris Johnson - looked for a permanent resident for the stadium in the Olympic Park in Stratford, East London. In addition to West Ham United, Tottenham Hotspur and neighbouring Leyton Orient were also interested, but the Hammers, ultimately, won the battle.\n\nThe stadium changed its name from the Olympic Stadium to the London Stadium and has since undergone a renovation to make it as suitable as possible for football matches.\n\nThe capacity not only decreased from 80,000 to 60,000 but the design also slightly changed. A new roof was installed, the striking, triangular light poles were folded inwards and the lower stands were pushed forward covering the athletics track. The club’s name appeared on the eaves of the roof and on the seats. Claret-coloured carpets were even placed around the pitch. But It hasn't quite got the desired result yet, with some supporters claiming the club 'died' when it moved from the much-loved Upton Park, some three miles away. However, every season the atmosphere improves slightly as they accept their fate.\n\nWest Ham United has always been one of the biggest names in English football. A club with a huge stature, which is really special for a club that has rarely, if ever, been challenging for the title. In fact, the Hammers usually play in the bottom half and nobody is surprised that the club drops out of the Premier League every now and then.\n\nIt still does not change the status of the club: West Ham United, the club of East London. European Cup Winners’ Cup winner in the 1960s. But arguably their biggest claim to fame is supplying three players to England who went on to become world champions in 1966. Off the pitch, the people's club's status is even greater.\n\nA club with a clear identity, the club in East London with fans that have a beautifully distinct Cockney accent that you can recognise from miles away.\n\nTo understand the West Ham United of now, one must go back to the club's roots, deep in East London. Here, in the Upton Park neighbourhood, was the Boleyn Ground, often referred to as Upton Park for over 110 years. Not the best area of London, but therefore exemplary for the working class image of West Ham United. A beloved stadium for West Ham United fans, away supporters and football tourists. In short, anyone who had ever been there.\n\nSadly, the stadium on Green Street, which closed in 2016, is now gone, but the neighbourhood is still bursting with references to West Ham as the club is still the pride of the area. Shops and cafes still wear the club colours.\n\nRight next to the stadium, in an alley between Barking Road and Castle Street, a simple graffiti tag appeared just before the demolition. A claret background with a blue, hastily sprayed text: Long live the Boleyn. The Boleyn Ground disappeared, but the tag remains as a marker of what this place still means to West Ham fans.\n\nOpposite The Boleyn Tavern is the area's most famous work of art and in our opinion one of the finest in all of England. The World Cup Sculpture by Philip Jackson. This bronze sculpture is based on a famous photo taken just after the 1966 World Cup final at Wembley.\n\nThe statue shows four players from the newly crowned England team, including three from West Ham - Martin Peters, Geoff Hurst and Bobby Moore, the captain and the biggest Hammer of them all. Evertonian Ray Wilson completes the quartet to support Bobby Moore, who sits with the World Cup on top of his shoulders.\n\nIn the design and construction of the Olympic Park - with several sports stadiums - accessibility was one of the most important factors to take into account. After all, several events would take place simultaneously, with a huge number of spectators added together.\n\nThe London Stadium is therefore very easily accessible from all corners of London, especially by train and underground. Stratford station, East London's main transport hub, brings together virtually all modes of transport. If you travel here by bus, tram or underground, it is about a ten minute walk to the London Stadium. Depending on the direction you are coming from and your place in the stadium, it may be useful to get off one stop earlier or later, for example at Hackney Wick station or Pudding Mill Lane."
