Details about the neighbourhood, including a map of the area, some census data and information on the People Powered Places programme in the area can be found in the Stratford & West Ham Community Neighbourhood booklet (PDF).\n\nThere are a number of neighbourhood investment projects taking place in Stratford and West Ham, delivering community assets, making healthy and safe connections and improving vibrant streets.
