        "text": "EXETER CITY'S NEW COLOURS\n\nThe Exeter City directors have decided to change the colours of the club to red and white, similar to those of Southampton. The players have lately been in a superstitious mood, and voiced their opinion that the green and white brought them no luck. They petitioned the directors accordingly, and their wishes have now been acceded to. It was expected that the new jerseys would have been ready for the Queen's Park Rangers match, but such was not the case, and Exeter City therefore appeared at Park Royal for the last time in the old green and white. The secret had been well kept, and the news will no doubt come as a big surprise to the club's followers.\n\nSaturday, November 12th 1910. SOUTHERN LEAGUE.\n\n\"GRECIANS\" v. \"HAMMERS\"\n\nExeter City in their New Colours\n\nA Mascot:"
