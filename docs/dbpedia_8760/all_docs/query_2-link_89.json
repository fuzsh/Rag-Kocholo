        "text": "X\n\nAnimal Health Certificates\n\nOfficial Veterinarians are able to issue Animal Health Certificates enabling you to travel with your pet. There are a number of requirements that must be met before travel, so we recommend getting in touch with your local practice as early as possible if you might need your pet to travel abroad.\n\nX\n\nBlood Testing\n\nOur laboratory offers a rapid and efficient service with fast turnaround of results. Many branches have state-of-the-art in-house equipment for an even faster service. In addition to testing for the disease in an unwell patient, we also offer screening tests before your pet undergoes an anaesthetic to ensure that we identify any previously unknown problems, helping us to ensure the anaesthetic is as safe as possible.\n\nX\n\nConsultations\n\nWe offer 15-minute appointments as a standard for most consultations, giving you plenty of time to discuss your pet’s healthcare and ask any questions you may have. We are able to provide a range of services during the consultation and are always on hand to see your pet in an emergency if necessary.\n\nVET CONSULT FEES\n\nX\n\nDentistry\n\nTaking care of your pet’s teeth is vitally important for their overall health. Just as we brush our teeth each day and get regular dental check-ups, our pets also need regular preventative care, dental check-ups and dental treatment for a range of dental diseases or trauma. We recommend keeping up-to-date with your pet’s dental health and, as with any aspect of their wellbeing, we see prevention as a much better outcome than a cure.\n\nRead more\n\nX\n\nDiagnostic Imaging\n\nWe offer a referral service for diagnosis and treatment with CT scans, advanced x-rays and ultrasound. These imaging tests can be offered as an outpatient service, or as part of the treatment for patients hospitalised with us. We employ a number of specialists and certificate holders who are able to provide an expert opinion in interpreting these tests.\n\nReferrals\n\nX\n\nFlea and Worm Treatment\n\nFlea and Worm control is not only important for your pet’s health but also for public health. We provide Prescription-Only Medicine, so if we have not recently examined your pet and prescribed a Prescription-Only parasiticide, you’ll need to book a formal consultation with your vet so that we can supply you with the product. We are always happy to provide advice on the best preventative care for your animal so please call in if you have any questions.\n\nX\n\nHealthcare Plan – ProActive Pets\n\nBudget monthly and save money on all your pet’s preventative healthcare needs. Our affordable plan allows you to pay a monthly direct debit to spread the cost of your pet’s vaccinations and parasite control products throughout the year. The costs are much less than our full retail price, and the plan offers a number of other benefits on top.\n\nProActive Pets\n\nX\n\nNurse Clinics\n\nOur nursing team play a central role in the care that we provide you and your pet. In addition to assisting our veterinary surgeons in providing care for your pet, they are also able to answer questions for you directly and provide a range of nurse-led services such as puppy classes, weight management clinics and senior pet care consultations. Speak to your local team for details of classes and clinics available.\n\nX\n\nPet Insurance Information\n\nPeople tend to think it’s only older pets that get ill and therefore younger pets don’t need pet insurance but we know from the patients we see each day that that is not the case. In fact, the younger your pet is when you insure them the better as it means you are less likely to have any existing conditions, which may not be covered by the policy and you can then receive more help covering the cost of any future treatment your pet needs.\n\nFURTHER DETAILS\n\nX\n\nPet Vaccinations\n\nVaccinating your pet is an essential part of being a pet owner and looking after your beloved dog, cat, rabbit or any other animal you choose to bring into your home. Vaccinations are a vital part of the process used by millions of pet owners to keep their pets safe.\n\nJust like humans, pets require regular vaccinations to create a biological defence against some of the nasty diseases that can be picked up in everyday life. If your pet is unvaccinated and catches one of these illnesses then the symptoms could be fatal or cause long-term harm, meaning that staying on top of your pet’s vaccines is very important."
