        "text": "ETIHAD STADIUM, MANCHESTER —Phil Foden’s early brace propelled Manchester City towards a fourth consecutive Premier League title a second-half strike from Rodri capped a swaggering 3-1 victory for the serial champions.\n\nNo team in English football history, from the great Liverpool teams of the 1970s and 1980s to Sir Alex Ferguson's era-defining Manchester United, had ever won four championships in a row.\n\nTuesday's nervy 2-0 win at Tottenham brought Pep Guardiola's men to within touching distance. They were two points ahead of Arsenal, who entertained Everton at Emirates Stadium. The Gunners won 2-1 from behind to finish on 89 points, behind City’s mighty haul of 91.\n\nMan City vs West Ham final score\n\nFulltimeGoalscorersMan City3Foden 2', 18', Rodri 59'West Ham1Kudus 43'\n\nLineups:\n\nMan City (4-1-4-1, right to left): 18. Stefan Ortega (GK) — 2. Kyle Walker, 3. Ruben Dias, 25. Manuel Akanji (6. Nathan Ake), 24. Josko Gvardiol — 16. Rodri — 20. Bernardo Silva, 17. Kevin De Bruyne, 47. Phil Foden (8. Mateo Kovacic), 11.

James Ward-Prowse, 28. Tomas Soucek, 10. Lucas Paqueta; 14. Mohammed Kudus — 9. Michail Antonio (40. George Earthy).\n\nMORE: Follow all the Premier League final-day action live\n\nFWA and Premier League player of the year Foden got the party started in rip-roaring fashion when he lashed into the top corner from outside the box inside two minutes. His 19th Premier League goal of the season arrived in the 18th minute as Foden clipped home a cool finish from Jeremy Doku’s excellent pass.\n\nAvailable in the US\n\nAvailable in the UK\n\nIt was largely one-way traffic as West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola excelled himself and Erling Haaland improbably missed from three yards. Kudus then injected jeopardy into the afternoon with an astonishing overhead kick when City failed to clear James Ward-Prowse’s 43rd-minute corner.\n\nCity swarmed forward after the interval but there was something jittery about their play that translated to the stands. Before the hour, the customary control returned, and they sealed the title from one of those rumbling passing moves.\n\nBernardo Silva set the ball back to Rodri and the man whose goal secured Champions League glory against Internazionale last season steered into the bottom corner beyond an attempted save that Arreola will not reflect upon with any particular fondness.\n\nAll the air was briefly sucked out of the stadium when Tomas Soucek diverted another Ward-Prowse corner into the net, only to be penalised by VAR for an obvious handball. Then it was time for City’s latest delirious pitch invasion. As their club’s 115 Premier League charges rumble on and some observers furrow their brows over the health of English football's fabled competitive balance, these sky-blue hordes will continue to have the time of their lives in the age of Guardiola.\n\nAvailable in the US\n\nAvailable in the UK\n\nMORE: Man City star Phil Foden named Premier League player of the season\n\nMan City vs. West Ham analysis\n\nFoden lives out more boyhood dreams to crown epic season\n\nThis time last year, England star Foden was in the midst of the first genuine setbacks of his club career. Injuries, illness, and patchy form left him on the outside looking in, a rotation option as City swept to treble glory. His substitute appearance in the Champions League final, where he thrived as a first-half replacement for the injury De Bruyne, underscored what a rare talent remained.\n\nAs it happened, it served as a precursor to this season. De Bruyne damaged his hamstring again in the first game of the season away at Burnley and required surgery. City needed someone to step up and be their main man and Foden stepped up time and again. His screaming opening goal today was reminiscent of his fantastic equaliser in the Manchester derby, one of several contests he bent to his will en route to Premier League glory and Player of the Season honours.\n\nDe Bruyne and Foden in tandem are a frightening prospect, but it was telling today how much of the older man’s work came in the inside-left position, combining with the electrifying Doku. Foden was in De Bruyne’s old position on the right. It’s his favourite position, too, and this is his City team now.\n\nAvailable in the US\n\nAvailable in the UK\n\nRodri produces another clutch moment\n\nAgainst Aston Villa two years ago, with City 2-1 down and threatening to surrender the title, Rodri dispatched a nerveless equaliser to set up a 3-2 win. When Guardiola’s side laboured against Inter in last season’s Champions League final, Rodri scored the decisive goal.\n\nCompared to those high-pressure affairs, this was a relative walk in the park. But the manner in which Rodri’s celebration mimicked his Istanbul delirium shows what a huge moment it was; the moment he and his teammates were sure they would make history.\n\nLosing Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay Gundogan last close season left a considerable goalscoring shortfall. Rodri has done his part to fill that void. This was his 10th in all competitions. All three of City's Premier League defeats this season came with him suspended. There is no player in world football so far above the rest in their chosen position as the Spain midfielder is right now.\n\nMan City vs West Ham stats\n\nTeam AStatTeam B28Shots312Shots on target22.01Expected goals 0.3673%Possession27%771Passes28411Corners23Fouls120Yellow cards13Offsides0\n\nMan City vs West Ham live updates, highlights, and commentary\n\nFulltime: MANCHESTER CITY ARE CHAMPIONS OF ENGLAND FOR A FOURTH CONSECUTIVE SEASON!!!\n\nParty time at the Etihad as fans stream onto the pitch. For all the external talk of boredom and procession, that is what this still means to these people. Foden and Rodri were fitting matchwinners today, they've probably been the difference between this City and a much-improved Arsenal. Thanks for joining us today and this season.\n\n90th minute+5: Oh, some people have jumped the gun on the pitch invasion. There's a delay, which features Haaland going to help out the stewards.\n\n90th minute+1: Foden has taken a whack so makes way for Kovacic. There will be five minutes of additional time.\n\n88th minute: West Ha, have the ball in the net! Oh my word! Hang on, this looks like a fairly obvious handball by Soucek. VAR: NO GOAL! Blimey/\n\n87th minute: A West Ham attack. Kudus' ball into the six-yard box is deflected into the side netting by Ake.\n\n85th minute: Doku and Haaland both charging into the box. The game within the game. No dice. City fans boo a message on the stadium screen about not invading the pitch at fulltime. All the very best to the stewards!\n\n84th minute: Haaland just wide! De Bruyne's delivery is excellent and he glances beyond the upright. One of those days for the Norwegian etc, etc...\n\n83rd minute: Magic feet from Doku, then he falls over. One of those days for the Belgian. Well, it isn't because he's probably picking up his first Premier League medal in a little while.\n\n82nd minute: Doku cuts menacingly inside once more. His shot is deflected behind. It would feel faintly remarkable if he and Haaland each get through this 90 minutes without scoring.\n\n80th minute: West Ham youngster George Earthy is on for Antonio, whose tireless afternoon of lone furrow ploughing comes to an end.\n\n74th minute: Foden ripples the side netting with a free-kick. Feels like City want one more to properly let their hair down.\n\n70th minute: Finally Areola catches one and he can have a little breather. Akanji makes way for Ake. He's had an absolutely magnificent Premier League season, an unsung hero of City's campaign.\n\n69th minute: Akanji has stayed forward, lays it off to Haaland, who tried to take the ball and several West Ham defenders into the net with his shot. It's another corner. Nathan Ake is ready to come on as VAR checks a handball shout against Cresswell. No dice.\n\n68th minute: West Ham aren't very good at defending corners as 50,000 people turn their backs to them. Here comes another.\n\n67th minute: Areola flies out and it goes through him. Well, it caught someone of a West Ham persuasion because Foden has a corner on the other side. That's punched behind as Poznan breaks out.\n\n66th minute: Haaland still searching for his goal. His latest effort is blocked behind. De Bruyne to take the corner.\n\n63rd minute: Areola won't be happy with his efforts on that Rodri goal but he holds on to a Foden thumper at the near post.\n\n59th minute: GOOOOOAAAAALLLLL!!!!! Rodri!!!!\n\nThe man whose goal won the Champions League last June looks like he's just sealed the title. City worked the ball through phase after phase of patient build-up. Rodri took aim from the edge of the area and, just like he did on a far more dramatic day at the other end of the ground two years ago, speared his shot into the bottom corner.\n\nAvailable in the US\n\nAvailable in the UK\n\n56th minute: De Bruyne can't quite get the ball out of his feet and Zouma blocks his shot.\n\n54th minute: Coufal pulls back Haaland and that's a City free-kick. The hosts are looking dangerous but there's definitely an edgy undercurrent to everything here at the moment. The home fans need that two-goal cushion back.\n\n51st minute: Foden audaciously tries one from range again. It's hard to back against him in this form but that was a little too ambitious.\n\n49th minute: Foden and Haaland look to bundle their way through. The ball falls to De Bruyne, who lets fly left-footed. It scoots wide. Areola looked to have given that one up.\n\nKickoff: 2nd Half\n\nOff we go again, courtesy of Antonio. No changes from either side. City 45 minutes from glory. Will it get tense or will they have a chance to enjoy themselves?\n\nHalftime\n\nCity are 45 minutes away from the title thanks to two wonderful Phil Foden goals. Arsenal aren't even winning but Mohammed Kudus's stunning overhead kick has sucked the party atmosphere out of this ground. Guardiola's team are absolutely in the box seat but not over the line just yet.\n\n45th minute+3: Nice bit of West Ham pressure here and Akanji has to boot a Coufal cross clear.\n\n45th minute+1: There'll be four added minutes. That means four more minutes for Doku to dribble at beleaguered West Ham defenders. Haaland looks to lift his low cross into the net but he lifts it too high and over the crossbar.\n\n45th minute: This looked completely done five minutes ago, but following that West Ham goal, Arsenal have equalised. How are your nerves?\n\n43rd minute: GOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLL!!!!! Mohammed Kudus!!!!\n\nOh my goodness me! The ball bounces around a bit in the City box and Kudus unleashes an outrageous overhead kick. Orteta didn't smell it. There's a check for handball but the goal stands.\n\nAvailable in the US\n\nAvailable in the UK\n\n42nd minute: Corner to West Ham. Ward-Prowse's first chance to swing in something spicy.\n\n40th minute: Arsenal have fallen behind, news greeted in the pantomime style at the Etihad. Well, a pantomime where quite a lot of the attendees have been drinking in the sun for a few hours.\n\n38th minute: West Ham chance as they switch the play over to Kudus. He twists and turns into space outside Gvardiol and draws a decent save from Ortega on the angle.\n\n37th minute: Foden and De Bruyne with some wonderful combination play. It's worked back to Rodri, who takes aim and Areola pouches the shot.\n\n31st minute: Areola makes a fine save to deny Haaland one-on-one. Oh, a collectors' item as the offside goes up. It was the right call, Haaland strayed fractionally beyond Zouma. These 15 minutes or so until halftime could become too feel pretty horrific for West Ham.\n\n29th minute: Doku continues to make merry. He finds De Bruyne, who shifts onto his left foot this time and has a shot blocked.\n\n27th minute: Ohhhhh, Kevin De Bruyne! City's talisman picks up the ball on the edge of the box to the left and curls wide of the far post. Areola wasn't getting there. Looks like there was a deflection actually. Gvardiol heads Foden's corner wide at the near post.\n\n23rd minute: Erling Haaland, what are you doing?! It should be 3-0 but the best striker in the league has sent a scissors kick over from about three yards.\n\n18th minute:GOOOOOOAAAAAAAALLLLLL!!!!! Phil Foden!!!!!!\n\nIt's party time at the Etihad now. Doku saunters down the left channel, finds an eye-of-the-needle pass and Foden clips home. Bread and butter for a player in this form. \"Are you watching, Arsenal?!\" booms the chant. Probably not anymore, no.\n\nAvailable in the US\n\nAvailable in the UK\n\n17th minute: De Bruyne bundles his way into an advantageous position on the right wing. He picks out Rodri, who's timed his run into he box beautifully but the Spain star prods into the side netting.\n\n16th minute: Doku running at the West Ham defence with bad intentions. He lets fly and Areola tips over. West Ham deal with the corner, but City keep it alive and here's Doku again. On the right this time, cutting in and forcing Areola to save at his near post. The Belgium winger definitely looks to be in the mood.\n\n13th minute: West Ham have dug in pretty nicely here to check City's, momentum. Now Emerson drives an attack through the middle. Coufal joins the attack and Walker clears a cross intended for Antonio.\n\n7th minute: De Bruyne nutmegs Ward-Prowse. Behave. Doku and Gvardiol continue the attack before KDB lets fly from range and Areola fits it to safety.\n\n6th minute: Doku scoots to the byline and Zouma boots his cutback clear. You sense West Ham are going to have to fight hard to keep their heads above water during this initial period.\n\n2nd minute: GOOOOOOAAAAAAAALLLLLL!!!!! Phil Foden!!!!!!\n\nWowzers, that'll do it! City spend the first minute popping the ball around in the West Ham half. Paqueta tackles Gvardiol and shovels the ball away but only as far as Walker. He finds Bernardo, who finds Foden. The England star cuts inside and buries what is now a trademark strike into the top corner from the edge of the D.\n\nAvailable in the US\n\nAvailable in the UK\n\nKickoff: 1st Half\n\nThe players take a knee before kickoff and De Bruyne gets us underway.\n\n3 mins before kickoff: Here come the teams, out into a raucous Etihad Stadium bathed in sunshine. Will City get the job done with something to spare or are we set for some more epic final-day nonsense?\n\n15 mins before kickoff: Two years ago on this ground, with City locked in a title race fight to the death with Liverpool, an Aston Villa team led by Steven Gerrard almost sent the title to Anfield. Philippe Coutinho put Villa 2-0 up before an incredible Ilkay Gundogan-inspired turnaround. Any candidates for that sort of carry-on today? Ex-Arsenal defender Kostas Mavropanos, perhaps this is your time...\n\n35 mins before kickoff: Guardiola has been speaking to Sky Sports, explaining the reasoning behind selecting Doku ahead of Kovacic. The Croatia midfielder had started five of City's past six games in the Premier League and has been something of an unsung hero during the run-in.\n\nIt was a really really tough decision. Kova has been helping us with the rhythm to play. But I thought it will be a defensive position from West Ham. And his (Doku's) ability in smaller spaces and one-vs-one, that was absolutely the reason why.\n\n55 mins before kickoff: Bowen does indeed miss out and David Moyes takes the opportunity to bring in Aaron Creswell and switch to a back five. Safe to say both teams have set their stall out.\n\n1 hour before kickoff: The teams are in. Doku does indeed start for City. Him and Ortega are the only changes to the team that started at Tottenham, with Mateo Kovacic dropping to the bench.\n\n1 hr 10 mins before kickoff: Team news will be with us shortly. There are rumours of a sickness bug in the West Ham camp, so it'll be interesting to see how they pull up. Jeremy Doku has been tipped to start for City after some electrifying cameos off the bench. If that is the case then it suggests Pep Guardiola wants to start fast and get this one done early. Doku scored his first City goal when he dazzled against the Hammers in September's reverse fixture.\n\n1 hr 40 mins before kickoff: At his press conference on Friday, Guardiola flagged up the symmetry that outgoing West Ham boss David Moyes was his opponent in his very first Premier League game when the Scot was in charge of Sunderland. Guardiola's second home game saw West Ham visit the Etihad and go down to a 3-1 defeat. In 18 games against the Hammers, Guardiola is yet to taste defeat. There have been 14 wins in 17 games overall, although after one of those draws West Ham did knock City out of the Carabao Cup on penalties. Still, they feel like pretty useful opponents for this afternoon.\n\n2 hours before kickoff: And so, for the fifth time in the Premier League era and sixth time in their history, City head into the final day of the season with a chance to win and be crowned champions. They prevailed on each of the previous five and, as on those occasions, their destiny remains in their hands. Win and the job is done. Simple.\n\nHowever, in 2012 against Queens Park Rangers and 2022 versus Aston Villa, they put their fans through the wringer on this ground. In 2019, they fell behind briefly against Brighton at the Amex Stadium. The last time City won the league on the final day and didn't have to overturn a deficit? Against West Ham at home in 2014.\n\n2 hrs 45 mins before kickoff: Hello and welcome to The Sporting News' live coverage of Manchester City vs. West Ham in the Premier League. Potential final-day drama at the Etihad Stadium, is it? Oh, go on then.\n\nMan City vs West Ham kick off time\n\nMan City will host West Ham at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester for the final Premier League game of the season which is scheduled to kick off on May 19 at 4:00 p.m. local time.\n\nHere's how that time translates across some of the major territories:\n\nDateKickoff timeUSASun, May 1911:00 a.m. ETCanadaSun, May 1911:00 a.m. ETUKSun, May 194:00 p.m. BSTAustraliaMon, May 201:00 a.m. AESTIndiaSun, May 198:30 p.m. IST\n\nMORE: Premier League top goal scorers 2023/2024\n\nMan City vs West Ham lineups, team news\n\nAs Manchester City prepare for their crucial match against West Ham United, they will have to do so without first-choice goalkeeper Ederson, who suffered a fractured eye socket after a collision with Cristian Romero in midweek.
