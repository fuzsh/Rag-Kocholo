        "text": "How many of these chants have you sung at the London Stadium, Upton Park or around the country? Here at Essex Live, we've looked at five of the most popular chants and want to know what are your favourite chants and songs too?\n\nI'm Forever Blowing Bubbles – The Hammers most famous chant that has been sung from the stands in East London since the early 1920's. It's understood that former West Ham manager Charlie Paynter had a friend who was a school headmaster that used to sing the full version of 'Bubbles' to a boy in the school that resembled the boy in the Bubbles painting used in a Pears soap advert. Over the years, the loyal football fans have only used the chorus of the song, which is also sometime adapted to a quicker version to match the tune of 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'. East London rock band The Cockney Rejects also used the lyrics to release their own version\n\nLyrics: \"I'm forever blowing bubbles, pretty bubbles in the air. They fly so high, nearly reach the sky, then like my dreams they fade and die. Fortunes always hiding, I've look everywhere. I'm forever blowing bubbles, pretty bubbles in the air.\"\n\nWe All Follow The West Ham – Simple. It's what West Ham fans do. Over land or sea, the Hammers fans are always there to support their team. This is a song that is usually sung every game without failure and can also be heard on the terraces of other club's with changed lyrics.\n\nLyrics: \"We all follow the West Ham, over land and sea. We all follow the West Ham, on to victory (all together now)!\"\n\nTwist and Shout – An absolute classic that was written in 1961 for The Top Notes, before also being re-released by the Isley Brothers a year later. The song really reached its peak when The Beatles did their own version in 1963 on their first UK album 'Please Please Me' and became an instant hit. West Ham fans adopted this song a number of years ago and are more commonly heard singing it at away games, where one sole West Ham fan will shout out a line, before all the Hammers fans respond with the same link.\n\nLyrics: \"Well, shake it up, baby, now (Shake it up, baby), Twist and shout (Twist and shout), C'mon C'mon, C'mon, C'mon, baby, now (Come on baby), Come on and work it on out (Work it on out). Well, work it on out, honey (Work it on out), You know you look so good (Look so good), You know you got me goin', now (Got me goin'), Just like I knew you would (Like I knew you would)\"\n\nWe've Got Payet – When Dimitri Payet signed for West Ham from French Ligue 1 side Marseille for over £10m, not many Hammers fans knew much about the tricky playmaker despite the fact that he'd been named in the Ligue 1 Team of the Season two seasons running. Very quickly though, Hammers fans fell in love with the Frenchman after he scored a number of unbelievable goals and contributed with just as many assists. This song started in October 2015 just after Payet scored the third goal in a 3-1 Premier League victory away to Crystal Palace. The song goes to the tune of 'Achy Breaky Heart' by Billy Ray Cyrus and even jokes about Payet being better than a fellow French superstar midfielder.\n\nLyrics: \"We've got Payet, Dimitri Payet; I just don't think you understand. He's super Slaven's man, he's better than Zidane, we've got Dimitri Payet!\"\n\nAin't Nobody, Like Lanzini – Another popular fan chant about one of our most popular. Like the Payet move, Hammers fans had no idea who Manuel Lanzini was when he signed for the club in July 2015 from Al Jazira Club in the United Arab Emirates. Both Lanzini and Payet burst onto the scene within weeks of signing as they both bought a new flair to West Ham's performances. This song started around the time that Lanzini scored in last season's 2-2 away Premier League draw at Chelsea in March.\n\nLyrics: \"Ain't Nobody, like Lanzini. Makes me happy, plays the West Ham way!\""
