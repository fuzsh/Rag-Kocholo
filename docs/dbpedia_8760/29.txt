Description

Ionic wheel cross, with tapering shaft. It is set on a tapering plinth of rough-hewn stone, the front face of which bears the World War 1 inscription in lead lettering. The plinth is set on a two-stepped stone base, against which rests a rectangular stone tablet that bears the names of those who died in World War 2. The memorial stands in a paved area, surrounded by a low chain fence, in the grounds of St Luke's Church in Stone Cross. (The same casualties are named on the WW1 and WW2 stone tablets inside St Mary's Church in Westham - see WMR 17208 and 16941. Some of the WW1 casualties are also named on the "Hankham" altar and/or on the Westham Roll of Honour, both of which are now in St Luke's Church- see 58756 and 58757)
