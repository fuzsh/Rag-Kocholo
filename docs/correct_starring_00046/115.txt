Actor Hugh Keays-Byrne, known for his starring roles in both Mad Max and Mad Max: Fury Road, has died at the age of 73. The cause of death for the Australian actor has not yet been disclosed. Filmmaker Ted Geoghegan shared the news via social media, calling Byrne "an unsung hero of Aussie cinemaâ€¦ [and] an absolutely wonderful human who fought very hard for environmental and humanitarian issues." Filmmaker Brian Trenchard-Smith, a friend of Keays-Byrne's, reported on Facebook that the actor died in the hospital.

In addition to actor Mel Gibson and writer-director George Miller, Keays-Byrne shares the distinction of being synonymous with the long-running and still-enduring Mad Max franchise. In the original 1979 version, Keays-Byrne plays the merciless terrorist Toecutter who ruled the outback with his motorcycle gang; in 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road, he again played a villain--Immortan Joe.

In the many years between, Keays-Byrne made a name for himself as a versatile actor outside that cinematic universe, starring in films such as 2000's Farscape, 1989's The Blood of Heroes, and 1974's Stone. Mad Max: Fury Road stands as the actor's final role.
