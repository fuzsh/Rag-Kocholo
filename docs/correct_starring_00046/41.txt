Hugh Keays-Byrne, best known for his dual villainous roles in the 'Mad Max' series, has passed away at the age of 73.

Born in India, Keays-Byrne in 1973 after arriving there with a touring theatrical company and starred in a number of cult movies, chief among them being 1979's 'Mad Max', where he played Toecutter. Throughout the '80s, Keays-Byrne kept busy with both TV roles, theatre, and movie roles.

In what would be his final movie role, Keays-Byrne reunited with director George Miller for 2015's 'Mad Max: Fury Road', where he again played the villain in the character of Immortan Joe. While his hulking frame, wild hair, and booming voice was terrifying on-screen, Keays-Byrne was a gentle giant off-screen.

Charlize Theron, who played Furiosa opposite Keays-Byrne, said that "(it's) amazing you were able to play an evil warlord so well cause you were such a kind, beautiful soul." In a brief statement sent to media, director George Miller described Keays-Byrne as "formidable, daring, warm and kind - both as an artist and a man."
