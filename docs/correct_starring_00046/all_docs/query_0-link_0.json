        "text": "British-Australian actor (1947–2020)\n\nHugh Keays-Byrne (18 May 1947 – 2 December 2020) was a British-Australian actor. He began his career on stage in his native England, where he was member of the Royal Shakespeare Company between 1968 and 1972. After emigrating to Australia in 1973, he established himself as a supporting actor in action and thriller films like Stone and The Man from Hong Kong. His breakthrough film role was as the antagonist Toecutter in the original Mad Max.[1] Decades later, he played another villain in the series, Immortan Joe in Mad Max: Fury Road.[1]\n\nOver the course of his career, Keays-Byrne was nominated for an AACTA Award and won a Logie Award for his performance in the television drama Rush. The 2024 prequel to Fury Road, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, is dedicated to his memory.\n\nEarly life[edit]\n\nKeays-Byrne was born in Srinagar, in the state of Jammu and Kashmir (part of the British Raj then, India now) to British parents; his family returned to Britain when India was partitioned.[2] He was raised mainly in Surrey, and picked up an interest in acting after being spotted by a drama teacher at the comprehensive school he was attending.[3] He got his first professional acting roles with a Theatre in Education troupe, and was mentored by Bernard Miles at the Mermaid Theatre in London.[3]\n\nCareer[edit]\n\nBetween 1968 and 1972, Keays-Byrne had parts in Royal Shakespeare Company productions including As You Like It, The Balcony, King Lear,[4] Hamlet,[5] Much Ado About Nothing,[6] A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Tempest or The Enchanted Island, Doctor Faustus, The Man of Mode, Troilus and Cressida, Enemies, The Revenger's Tragedy, and Bartholomew Fair.[7]\n\nKeays-Byrne made his first television appearance in 1967 on the British television programme Boy Meets Girl.[8] He was part of Peter Brook's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which toured Australia in 1973. Keays-Byrne decided to remain in Australia after the tour ended.[1] In 1974, he acted in the TV film Essington, then made his first film appearance in the motorcycle picture Stone. This was followed by supporting roles in films such as The Man from Hong Kong, Mad Dog Morgan, The Trespassers and Snapshot.[9][10]\n\nAfter his first starring role in the TV film Death Train,[11] Keays-Byrne was cast as the violent gang leader Toecutter in Mad Max.[1] Director George Miller had Keays-Byrne and the other actors for the gang travel from Sydney to Melbourne in a group on motorcycles, as there was no money for airplane tickets. In an early international print of the film, Keays-Byrne was dubbed with a bad American accent, which Miller later regretted.[12] Keays-Byrne then continued to act in post-apocalyptic and science fiction films such as The Chain Reaction, Strikebound,[13] Starship[14] and The Blood of Heroes.[15]\n\nIn 1982, he directed the television film Madness of Two. In 1992, he made his feature directorial debut and acted in the film Resistance.[16] He also appeared in TV miniseries adaptations of Moby Dick and Journey to the Center of the Earth.[14]\n\nKeays-Byrne played Grunchlk in the science fiction television series Farscape (1999–2003) and its conclusion Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars. Miller also cast him as the Martian Manhunter in the planned 2009 film Justice League: Mortal.[6]\n\nKeays-Byrne returned to the Mad Max franchise in the 2015 film Mad Max: Fury Road as the main villain Immortan Joe.[1][12] The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning six,[17] and Keays-Byrne was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain.[18]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nKeays-Byrne and his wife Christina, were long-time residents of Lisarow.[19] They were also part of the Macau Light Company, an artist collective based in Centennial Park.[2] His hobbies included painting, poetry, and gardening.[12]\n\nDeath[edit]\n\nKeays-Byrne died on 2 December 2020 at Gosford Hospital in NSW, at the age of 73. His death was announced by his friend, The Man from Hong Kong director Brian Trenchard-Smith.[20]\n\nThe 2024 film Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is dedicated to Keays-Byrne's memory.\n\nFilmography[edit]\n\nFilm[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Type 1974 Stone Toad [9][13][14][16][21] 1975 The Man from Hong Kong Morrie Grosse 1976 Mad Dog Morgan Simon [10] The Trespassers Frank 1978 Blue Fin Stan 1979 Mad Max Toecutter Snapshot Linsey 1980 The Chain Reaction Eagle 1982 Ginger Meggs Captain Hook 1983 Going Down Bottom, the biker 1984 Where the Green Ants Dream Mining executive Strikebound Idris Williams Lorca and the Outlaws Danny 1985 Burke & Wills Ambrose Kyte 1986 For Love Alone Andrew Hawkins 1987 Kangaroo Kangaroo Les Patterson Saves the World Inspector Farouk 1989 The Blood of Heroes Lord Vlle 1992 Resistance Peter 1999 Huntsman 5.1 Bain [6] 2011 Sleeping Beauty Man 3 2015 Mad Max: Fury Road Immortan Joe Final film appearance[1][2]\n\nTelevision[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Type 1967 Boy Meets Girl Leslie Episode: \"A High-Pitched Buzz\" 1967–1977 Bellbird TV series 1974 Essington TV film 1975 Ben Hall John Piesley 4 episodes 1976 Polly Me Love TV film The Outsiders Doyle Episode: \"Ghost Town\"[22] Rush Tim Thomas Episode: \"A Shilling a Day\" 1977 Say You Want Me Harry Kirby TV film Death Train Ted Morrow TV film The Tichborne Affair Tichborne TV film Beyond Reasonable Doubt Patterson Episode: \"Ronald Ryan Case\" Chopper Squad Syd Tasker Episode: \"Pilot\" 1978 Barnaby and Me Huggins TV film 1980–1982 Secret Valley William Whopper 6 episodes 1982 Runaway Island Lucas the Ratter TV film 1984 Five Mile Creek Bill Curruthers Episode: \"Annie\" 1987 Treasure Island Voice TV film 1988 Badlands 2005 Moondance TV film Dadah Is Death Hammed TV film Joe Wilson Bob Galletley Episode: \"No Regrets\" 1995 Singapore Sling: Old Flames TV film[23] 1998 Moby Dick Mr. Stubb 2 episodes[11] 1999 Journey to the Center of the Earth McNiff 2 episodes 2001 Farscape Grunchlk 2 episodes[6] 2004 Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars Grunchlk TV miniseries[6]\n\nStage[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Type 1968 As You Like It Unnamed parts Royal Shakespeare Company King Lear Unnamed parts Royal Shakespeare Company[24] 1968–1969 Much Ado About Nothing Watch 3 / Unnamed parts Aldwych Theatre & tour with Royal Shakespeare Company[6] Troilus and Cressida Margarelon / Prologue (alt) / Unnamed parts Aldwych Theatre & tour with Royal Shakespeare Company 1968–1970 Doctor Faustus Sloth Tour with Royal Shakespeare Company 1969 The Revenger's Tragedy Spurio's Man Aldwych Theatre with Royal Shakespeare Company Bartholomew Fair Cupid (alt) / Puppy Aldwych Theatre with Royal Shakespeare Company[25] 1970 The Tempest or The Enchanted Island Mariner / Master of a ship / Spirit Royal Shakespeare Company Hamlet Captain / Francisco / Player Mute Royal Shakespeare Theatre with Royal Shakespeare Company[5] 1970–1971 A Midsummer Night's Dream Fairy / Cobweb Royal Shakespeare Company 1971 Enemies Yagodin Aldwych Theatre with Royal Shakespeare Company The Balcony Executioner Aldwych Theatre & tour with Royal Shakespeare Company The Man of Mode La Tour Aldwych Theatre & tour with Royal Shakespeare Company 1973 A Midsummer Night's Dream Snug Australian national tour - Adelaide Festival Centre, Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne with Royal Shakespeare Company[1] 1973–1974 The Marsh King's Daughter Nimrod Theatre Company 1974 My Shadow and Me Jane Street Theatre with NIDA & Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust 1975 Of Mice and Men Sydney Opera House & University of NSW with Old Tote Theatre Company 1976 A Streetcar Named Desire Stanley Kowalski Sydney Opera House with Old Tote Theatre Company 1977–1979 Treasure Island Long John Silver Rodd Island & Clark Island with Nimrod Theatre Company for Festival of Sydney 1978 Curse of the Starving Class Weston Nimrod Theatre Company with Nimrod Theatre Company 2009 Gethsemane Belvoir Street Theatre\n\n[26][27]\n\nAwards and nominations[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Subject Result Ref. 1977 Logie Award Best Actor Rush Won [28][29] 1979 Australian Film Institute Award Best Supporting Actor Mad Max Nominated [30] 2011 Alliance of Women Film Journalists EDA Special Mention Award – Most Egregious Age Difference\n\nBetween the Leading Man and the Love Interest Sleeping Beauty Nominated [31] 2016 AFCA Award Best Supporting Actor Mad Max: Fury Road Nominated [32] MTV Movie Award Best Villain Nominated [18]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
