        "text": "Megan Gale has paid tribute to Mad Max: Fury Road co-star Hugh Keays-Byrne, whose death was announced today.\n\nIn a touching post shared to Instagram, Gale — who starred alongside the veteran actor in the fourth instalment of the franchise in 2015 — lovingly remembered her co-star.\n\n\"One of a kind with the kindest heart,\" she captioned a photo of them embracing at the film's Australian premiere five years ago.\n\n\"A beautiful man with a beautiful soul. Rest in love & peace Hugh.\"\n\nGale, who played The Valkyrie opposite Keays-Byrne's Immortan Joe, wasn't the only celebrity to pay tribute to the late actor, who died aged 73.\n\n\"RIP Hugh Keays-Byrne,\" Fury Road co-star Charlize Theron wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"It's amazing you were able to play an evil warlord so well cause you were such a kind, beautiful soul. You will be deeply missed my friend.\"\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, sign up here to receive our top stories straight to your inbox\n\nBritish filmmaker Brian Trenchard-Smith, who directed Keays-Byrne in the 1975 action The Man From Hong Kong, is also mourning the loss of \"a fine actor and a good friend\".\n\n\"Hugh had a generous heart, offering a helping hand to people in need, or a place to stay to a homeless teenager,\" Trenchard-Smith wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"He cared about social justice and preserving the environment long before these issues became fashionable. His life was governed by his sense of the oneness of humanity. We will miss his example and his friendship.\""
