        "text": "Keays-Byrne is back, and bad, in 'Mad Max: Fury Road'\n\nHugh Keays-Byrne played the bad guy, Toecutter, in \"Mad Max\" in 1979.\n\nNow he's playing another bad guy in \"Mad Max: Fury Road\": Immortan Joe, a warlord who uses scarce water to enslave the remaining population of a post-apocalyptic world.\n\nKeays-Byrne, 67, who was born in India and moved to Australia in 1973, spoke recently about the roles, director George Miller and how times have changed (and how they haven't).\n\nREVIEW: \"Fury Road\" is insane in the best possible way.\n\nQuestion: Your voice is a lot different in real life than in the movie. (Keays-Byrne acted with the Royal Shakespeare Company and his voice sounds like it.)\n\nAnswer: You mean the \"Fury Road\" movie (laughs)? Sure.\n\nQ: Is the voice a big part of a character in a film?\n\nA: Yes. And it emerges. It's almost beyond my control, in the way that I get things together. And then, of course, all the sweetening that's done and all of those things are a wonderful addition that all comes with a new world, doesn't it?\n\nThe voice worked for you?\n\nQ: Absolutely.\n\nA: Well, there you go.\n\nQ: It worked in the way that everything else in the movie did â€” it's insane. Of course, you've been in two of these, so you know that. How cool was it to be asked to be in this film?\n\nA: Very, very cool. Saved my bacon.\n\nQ: Were you surprised?\n\nA: Yes, I was. I was.\n\nQ: How did it play out?\n\nA: George just phoned me, the sweetness of the man. That was great.\n\nQ: Since \"Mad Max,\" he also has directed such movies as \"Babe: Pig in the City\" and \"Happy Feet\" and its sequel. Was his eclectic streak a big draw?\n\nA: Sure. He's got an extraordinary mind. He's an extraordinarily clever man, very, very tenacious, with amazing stamina. What's not to admire? That was all good and easy, and very exciting.\n\nQ: The budget for this film dwarfs the first. Other than the size of the film, was making it different?\n\nA: Chalk and cheese, night and day. The scale was the overwhelming difference, I suppose. The other difference was that, 35 years later, George has made loads and loads of films and everything, so there was so much a store of expertise. Marry that with all the new technology and it was an extraordinary experience.\n\nQ: How has he changed?\n\nA: I didn't feel that he'd changed a great deal, other than he's done 35 years' more film.\n\nQ: How about you?\n\nA: Probably the same (laughs).\n\nQ: Where do these movies rate with you in terms of your career?\n\nA: Well, they're highlights, for sure.\n\nQ: Are you surprised at the staying power of the first ones?\n\nA: Yes. It's interesting, isn't it?\n\nQ: Why do you suppose they struck such a chord?\n\nA: I don't know. There's the threat of darkness, there's the threat of madness, there's the threat of a sort of comic book, slightly surreal, slightly larger-than-life, full-on action, speed, all of that stuff.\n\nQ: Did you have a clue when you made the first one what it would become?\n\nA: No. None at all. In fact we didn't think the first one was ever going to come out. There was all sorts of chaos in the funding and all sorts of chaos in the production, and then all sorts of chaos in the getting it together and all of that. It seems like an awful long time went by before it came out. So absolutely no idea.\n\nThis one felt more, for me, anyway. I thought, my God, this is big."
