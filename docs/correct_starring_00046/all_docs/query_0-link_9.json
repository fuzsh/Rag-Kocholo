        "text": "Hugh Keays-Byrne, the actor best known for playing iconic villains in the \"Mad Max\" action film franchise, has died. He was 73.\n\nOn Wednesday, Keays-Byrne's manager confirmed to USA TODAY that the Australian-English actor died peacefully Tuesday morning.\n\nKeays-Byrne starred as the villainous Toecutter in the original 1979 \"Mad Max\" film. He returned to play the warlord Immortan Joe in 2015's \"Mad Max: Fury Road.\"\n\nGeorge Miller, who directed both films, remembered Keays-Byrne in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\n\"Hugh was formidable, daring, warm and kind - both as an artist and a man,\" Miller said. \"He taught us all so much.\"\n\nCharlize Theron, whose Imperator Furiosa battled Immortan Joe in \"Mad Max: Fury Road,\" paid tribute to the actor.\n\n\"RIP Hugh Keays-Byrne,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"Itâ€™s amazing you were able to play an evil warlord so well cause you were such a kind, beautiful soul. You will be deeply missed my friend.\"\n\nAs the vicious biker-gang leader Toecutter, Keays-Byrne went up against Mel Gibson's Max in \"Mad Max.\" The India-born former member of London's Royal Shakespeare returned as the masked, monster car-driving warlord Immortan Joe for \"Fury Road,\" which racked up more than $44 million in its opening weekend.\n\nKeays-Byrne reflected on the franchise's success in an interview with USA TODAY in 2015. \"I don't think you think about things like this. It seems a bit big,\" he said, adding that being a villain is just fine, because \"for an old ham like me, it's great fun.\"\n\n\"I tend to always be the bad guys,\" he said. \"I'm yearning to play a lover.\"\n\n'Keep the faith': Alex Trebek shares inspiring posthumous Thanksgiving message\n\nKeays-Byrne started his acting career as a teenager, doing TV and stage work before joining the Royal Shakespeare Company and ending up in Australia in 1973 after a touring production of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\" He became a regular on Australian screens big and small before Miller came calling.\n\nThe director signed Keays-Byrne and a group of fellow actors to play Toecutter and his gang, but couldn't afford to fly them from Sydney to Melbourne. So the first-time filmmaker sent them motorcycles via train, and the crew rode down, becoming a tight group as they went.\n\nOff-screen, Keays-Byrne was a homebody, for whom a lovely day involved painting, writing poems or tooling around in his garden.\n\n\"I love sitting around talking, having a coffee, chatting about politics and rubbish,\" he told USA TODAY. \"It's all good.\"\n\nSean Connery, who defined the role of 'James Bond' for a generation, dies at 90\n\nContributing: Brian Truitt"
