        "text": "Welcome to George Miller’s Wasteland. It’s a post-apocalyptic world not too far removed from our own. A hellscape where resources have run dry, pushing humanity to barbarism, tribalism and a twisted sense of justice. The scarcity of supplies has made gasoline one of Earth’s most precious resources, as the only thing left to do for those who have the strength is to keep moving in search of a better place. It’s enough to make anyone go a little mad. And that’s certainly the case for Max Rockatansky as he travels the scorched deserts like a mythic wraith, spilling blood and fire in an effort to hold back the complete death of the world, if only a little.\n\nMiller, a former med student, conceived of Mad Max (1979) alongside writer James McCausland, and independently produced it with fellow med student Byron Kennedy. The film, made for $400,000 and starring a then-unknown Mel Gibson, set a Guinness World Record for the most profitable film. It also became a critical, yet controversial, success for its levels of violence. The film is credited for starting the New Wave of Australian cinema and is regarded today as one of the most significant international releases, as well as one of the best science fiction films. Miller was 33 years old.\n\nToday, Miller at 79 shows no sign of slowing down. After two sequels, Miller lost interest in the series following the tragic death of his friend and producing partner Kennedy in 1983. Yet, as the world approached a new Millennium, Miller was drawn back to the Wasteland, and in 1998 he began thinking about the film that would eventually become Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). That film, which recast Max with Tom Hardy and introduced a new protagonist, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), became a critical sensation, an Oscar best picture nominee and introduced a whole new generation to the madness of Miller who at that point was better known among younger general audiences for Happy Feet (2006)."
