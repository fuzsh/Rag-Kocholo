        "text": "Oh you lucky people.\n\nStep out to a theater -- find one with the biggest screen and the hottest sound system -- strap yourself in, and enjoy two hours of the best moviemaking in this world and the next. \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" sets new standards in old-school stunt work and car chases and does it in service of an idea-driven story with a beating heart and an action star for our troubled times in Charlize Theron. The visual and aural experience is pitched just short of overload in the first hour but all those quick beats and eye-popping edits pay off in the quieter moments at the end. More than 36 years after Mad Max Rockatansky first gunned his Interceptor across the Australian Outback, creator George Miller shows a new generation of comic-book directors and franchise-movie revivers how it's done.\n\nThe roaring and buzzing starts as a rumble of faraway thunder before the first shot. Max stands at the edge of a cliff, looking down at a fallen world left barren by war. A two-headed lizard skitters by and becomes a power snack for Max before the War Boys come after him.\n\nIt's on! From that moment forward, there's nothing but boldly composed, brazenly executed action for the next hour. Max, all yoked shoulders and roped forearms courtesy of Tom Hardy, gets run down by the War Boys and becomes a slave of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a warlord who rules the Citadel, his desert kingdom, by controlling the supply of oil and water and breast milk (don't ask). Max, dogged by dark visions from his past, has to wear a mask that's tighter than the one Hardy wore in \"The Dark Knight Rises\" and hang upside down or get strapped to the front of a screaming war vehicle. He barely says two words, neither printable here.\n\nWhile that's going on, Imperator Furiosa (Theron) is taking off in a War Rig with cargo more precious than \"guzzle-ine\" -- five young women enslaved as breeders by Immortan Joe. Her betrayal brings down the full wrath of everyone with the keys to a souped-up, open-engine anything, including a semi that carries a bank of amps and a guitarist with a flame-spitting axe suspended from a bungee chord. He plays death metal with an Outback beat. It's sick.\n\nThe whole movie is sick. Miller has basically rewritten \"The Road Warrior\" -- by far the best of the previous movies, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" of the \"Mad Max\" trilogy -- and updated it with 21st-century technology. There are an amazing number of edits, more than 2,700 in two hours, and some beautifully colorized backgrounds but no green screens or motion capture. Miller created it all in the Namibian desert, fighting sandstorms and heat the way David Lean and John Huston used to do it, and made an epic that throws down the gauntlet for J.J. Abrams and the \"Star Wars\" crew.\n\nBecause on \"Fury Road,\" it all works together -- the costumes, the sound, the lighting, the stunts -- to create a sensory experience unlike anything in this era of lumbering blockbusters. By the time the pursuers start pogo-ing across the screen on huge poles -- from one speeding vehicle to another -- all you can do is laugh at the audacity and forget about the huge logical inconsistency that lurks at the back of the \"Mad Max\" universe: If gasoline is so precious, why does everyone burn so much of it racing across the desert in contraptions that clearly don't meet EPA emission standards?\n\nAt its center is Theron, buzz-cut and eye-black, banging gears with one working arm and trying to get these fertile women to the Green Place. Max is the title character, but his role is to help the women get from one end of the desert to the other, same as Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a War Boy with a conscience. The danger in this netherworld comes from men and any salvation will start with women, something Max is evolved enough to understand (once he gets that mask off).\n\nThe last few years of cinema have been all about superheroes, Marvel vs. DC, Batman vs. Iron Man vs. Superman vs. Ant-Man, and who shows up in which sequel and what's the opening weekend box office in China? \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" flips all that silly world-building on its side and roars off in an exciting old-is-new direction. Captain America and his special Frisbee shield, Thor and his mighty hammer, even Batman and his tortured psyche and armored Batmobile ... none of them would stand a chance against Furiousa and Max in the open desert. If you can't take the heat, Marvel, stay out of this kitchen. You'll get burned.\n\n\"Mad Max: Fury Road\"\n\nGrade: A\n\nPlaying at: Opens Thursday, May 14, for evening previews; everywhere on May 15.\n\nRunning time: 120 minutes\n\nRating: R\n\nCast and crew: Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Josh Helman, Nathan Jones, Zoe Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough; written by George Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris; directed by Miller.\n\nThe lowdown: This is the best movie of 2015 so far, an action masterpiece.\n\n-- Jeff Baker\n\n503-221-8165"
