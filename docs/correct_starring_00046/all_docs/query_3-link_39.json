        "text": "3 December 2020\n\nTributes have been paid to Mad Max star Hugh Keays-Byrne, who has died aged 73.\n\nThe late actor played the villain Toecutter, opposite Mel Gibson, in the 1979 post-apocalyptic, dystopian action movie.\n\nBritish filmmaker Brian Trenchard-Smith confirmed on Facebook that he had died on Tuesday.\n\nCharlize Theron, who appeared with him in the fourth instalment and 2015 re-boot, Fury Road, said he would be \"deeply missed\".\n\n\"It's amazing you were able to play an evil warlord so well cause you were such a kind, beautiful soul,\" Theron posted online.\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

We will miss his example and his friendship.\"\n\nKeays-Byrne also appeared in the 1974 biker movie Stone and the 1986 drama, For Love Alone.\n\nThe Guardian's movie critic Luke Buckmaster described him as an actor \"of visceral, wall-rattling force and underrated talent\".\n\n\"Every role he took was a revelation,\" he wrote."
