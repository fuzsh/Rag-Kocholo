        "text": "At 68, Hugh Keays-Byrne is this summer's most unlikely movie villain.\n\nAs the vicious biker-gang leader Toecutter, he made Mel Gibson's life miserable in George Miller's 1979 action flick Mad Max. His followers are a little different — and he's driving a six-wheeled monster car instead of a chopper — but Keays-Byrne is at it again as the masked warlord Immortan Joe in Mad Max: Fury Road,which racked up more than $44 million its opening weekend.\n\nIt's all a bit trippy for the India-born former member of London's Royal Shakespeare Company. \"I don't think you think about things like this. It seems a bit big,\" he says.\n\nWearing medals symbolizing his military background, the Immortan rules over the post-apocalyptic Wasteland with an iron fist, and that includes his personal life. He has taken a number of women to be his brides and mothers to future zealots, yet rebellion shows up at his doorstep when captive Max (Tom Hardy) teams with one of the Immortan's crew, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), to take the women to safety.\n\nImmortan Joe \"wants to bring back the things he sees are of value,\" Keays-Byrne says. \"It's a very worked-out structure that's been formed, and basically it's torn down by traitors and an itinerant blood bag.\"\n\nBeing a villain is just fine, because \"for an old ham like me, it's great fun,\" the actor says. \"I tend to always be the bad guys. I'm yearning to play a lover.\"\n\nMiller brought Keays-Byrne back for another go-around because he's a great actor but also because an early print of the original Mad Max was sent around the world with a poor American dub of his voice. \"I always felt so guilty about that. I thought I had to make up for it in some way,\" the director says.\n\nOn set, Keays-Byrne would playfully demand that everyone call him \"Daddy,\" Miller says. But his place in Mad Max mythology also gave him some unspoken respect: Fellow Aussie Nathan Jones plays the Immortan's son Rictus Erectus, and at age 9, he saw Keays-Byrne as Toecutter. \"He scared the hell out of me,\" Jones says. \"And now he's my dad.\"\n\nThat original Mad Max was an exciting time for Keays-Byrne. He had started his acting career as a teenager, doing TV and stage work before joining the Royal Shakespeare and ending up in Australia in 1973 after a touring production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. He became a regular on Australian screens big and small before Miller came calling.\n\nThe director signed him and a group of fellow actors to play Toecutter and his gang but couldn't afford to fly them from Sydney to Melbourne. So the first-time filmmaker sent them motorcycles via train, and they rode down, becoming a tight group as they went.\n\n\"There are things we did on the first one that you could never do now,\" says Keays-Byrne, who would ride to work on his not-quite-street-legal bike. \"When I think about it now, I just shudder: The Toecutter's ax was stashed in the framework of the bike. If that slipped? Pretty scary.\"\n\nThe meanest weapon Keays-Byrne wields these days is a hoe. He takes the odd job if he feels like it (\"I've always been a lazy actor,\" he admits), but for a homebody like him, a lovely day involves painting, writing poems or tooling around in his garden.\n\n\"I love sitting around talking, having a coffee, chatting about politics and rubbish. It's all good.\""
