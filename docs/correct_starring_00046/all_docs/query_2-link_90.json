After seeing “Mad Max: Fury Road”, the answer is most definitely yes. Hell Yes!\n\n“Mad Max: Fury Road” has everything that made action movies great in the 80s but is as visually impressive (even more so) than your recent string of super-hero blockbusters. The landscape in “Fury Road” is breathtaking and that is a great thing for what is essentially a two hour car chase.\n\nTom Hardy is great as the title character and so is Charlize Theron as the mechanical-armed woman, who is on a mission to liberate a group of young women that have been taken by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) for the sole purpose of breeding. Max had been taken as well to be a human bloodbag for the sickly young warrior, Nux (Nichols Hoult). When Joe realizes that his breeding wives are gone, he sets out to go after them with his massive army. This leads to an epic car chase that is unmatched.\n\n“Mad Max: Fury Road” not only lives up to the original films but does what very few remakes are able to do. It surpasses the originals in every way. The soundtrack definitely adds to the excitement. One of the trucks in the chase is equipped with not only a few rows of drums and drummers, but also a rock guitarist playing a flame-shooting guitar while dangling in front of the truck during the chase. Yeah, that is only some of the craziness that Miller was able to capture on screen.\n\n“Fury Road” was a massive budget film and a whole lot of people are going to have to head to the theater and see it so it makes enough of a profit to green-light a sequel. I am actually begging you all to go see “Mad Max: Fury Road” because I want George Miller to make another one and go even crazier with it.\n\nBy: Marc Ferman"
