Rip\n\nA roadrace sidecar crew here in the 80's used to carry a prop hand everywhere with them. If asked they said it was Cundalini's.\n\nMad as snakes the pair of them. One at least had been an extra on the film. Both had spent time working in Aussie.\n\nSomethings will live on forever or at the very least they will outlive this Laverda community (and yes there was screen time for a Laverda in the Mad Max movie, gotta be quick).\n\nMy 13-year-old grandson doesn't know a word of Shakespear but the little shit knows every line the 'Toecutter' spoke in the movie and the mannerisms (could be a problem there). More of a concern is his 15-year-old sister who responds to him with the lines from the movie and has the Toecutters 'stare' perfected, scary. I take no responsibility for this behavior but be warned if you drop your kids off for babysitting at my house you watch 'Gramps' movies non of the sissy Disney stuff. Wills my granddaughter after watching 'Stone' (Mad Max prequel) more than once doesn't want a car when she gets her driver's license she wants a Norton, her mother wants to kill me.\n\nToecutter \"Man what a strange weird trip it's been\" RIP mate.\n\nI've cycled the roads where MM was filmed - not that far from Melbourne. We've educated our kids with a viewing of the original MM - a memorable one is the bridge where Max chained the punk to the overturned car with the dripping fuel. I love the tales behind the making of - getting the local cops involved, basically highly illegal stunt driving on public roads. Kwaka 9's, bikini fairings and legend!\n\nPiranha Brother 2 said:\n\nI've cycled the roads where MM was filmed - not that far from Melbourne.

Kwaka 9's, bikini fairings and legend!\n\nAnd a guest appearance from a Laverda triple..... that legend still lives and breathes 76 3cl with a la- parissiane fairing. Now residing in my shed minus the fairing, but still carving up the bitch o mine\n\nMore opinion than proof, but it does seem as though the experiences of our 'formative' years stay with you forever. Back in the Stone days I think I was at NSW Uni. and already riding. Frankly, I don't think I've changed too much since."
