Roper is the Free Radicals' leader who resides at WV Lumber Co. in Appalachia.

Background[]

Prior to the Great War, Roper was the head guard at the Western Maryland Correctional Facility. He reformed its surviving prisoners into the Free Radicals[1] and led them into Appalachia following rumors of untold riches. They managed to clear WV Lumber Co. of the super mutants that previously inhabited it and claimed it as their own, while extorting nearby settlements into giving them food in exchange for protection.[2]

Roper terrorized Daniel's group which led to Daniel murdering Maggie to preserve the peace with the Free Radicals. Daniel agreed to personally deliver monthly shipment supplies to Roper's gang at their base of operations at the WV Lumber Co.

Roper's search for the treasure of Appalachia put him on the trail of a treasure hunter named Crane who claimed to have discovered a vault full of unknown wealth. His investigation led to the Wayward,[3] and one of his subordinates, Batter, was sent there in search of Crane.

Quests[]

Hunter for Hire: To stop the Free Radicals from harassing the Wayward, the Vault Dwellers must enter the WV Lumber Co Office and either kill Roper or convince him to leave them alone with a check of Charisma 8+ or Strength 8+. Alternatively, with Strength, Agility, or Intelligence 4+ they may convince him to let them join the Free Radicals.

The Elusive Crane: If the player character joined the Free Radicals, they will be found holding the Wayward's inhabitants at gunpoint upon returning from Gauley Mine. Roper will ask for the treasure, and will take the weapon found in the cache unless a check of Charisma 4+ or Intelligence 4+ is passed, which will also prompt him to reward the Radicals face mask. Afterward, they will leave the Wayward.

Effects of player's actions[]

If Roper has been killed, Daniel can be spoken to for rewards. (see Daniel's article for more information) However, Roper must be killed before The Elusive Crane if the player chose not to join the gang, otherwise he will not appear in the lumber mill, locking the player out of the rewards. If the player joins the gang, Roper can be killed anytime and Daniel will give the rewards.
