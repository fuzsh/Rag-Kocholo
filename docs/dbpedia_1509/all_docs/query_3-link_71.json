        "text": "-2- Saturday night, March 10, German Foreign Secretary, von Neurath, was at my house and reported that he had been authorized by the Chancellor to send Commission whenever Washington was ready -- he again discussed personnel. He also revealed considerable anxiety lest delay might precipitate economic trouble in Germany. Though not close friends, he and Schacht were of the same mind. I was certain, therefore, that the German authorities were unanimous in the view that a great deal depends on negotiations of new German-American trade relations; and I promised von Neurath to do what I could to expedite matters. My suggestion would, therefore, be to expedite German matter as soon as possible, for it is highly important to have the Commission over here before Bond conference meets in Berlin. The fact of negotiations being under way and existence of friendly economic relations which could be advertised in Germany would have great influence in renewing confidence and in avoiding complete default on interest payments. In my judgment a suspension of payments in April would be most harmful here and the failure of commercial improvements with us would certainly make May i (always a dangerous day in Germany) more critical. We must not assume that Schacht is willing to default. He is not. He wishes to show us that Germany is not another France. All thoughtful Germans indicate same attitude. They are anxious to please us. The Germans do wish lower rates of interest; and our Banker delegates agree that 6 and 7% is too high for bonds on our markets when few American securities pay more than 4% these days. There are other points involved; but these are the main ones. If we can act promptly and in conciliatory spirit we may save both peoples from great losses. I had a long talk with Hitler on March 7 and he is deeply interested."
