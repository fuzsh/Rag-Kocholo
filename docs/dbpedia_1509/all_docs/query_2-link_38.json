He rode the mule back home and married Susan Phillips and sherode the mule back.\n\nHistoric Houses of SC, 1975: p.52: Point Comfort Adjoing the plantation of Mepshaw (said in Dr. Irving's day to belong to the Ball estate, and only interesting on account of the land titles and Indian name) is found Point comfort, said by Dr. Irving to belong to R. W. Roper, now in possession of a Charleston family, connections of the Roper family, which is to be remembered particularly by the hospital bearing their name and which was founded by money left through the estate of this particular branch of the family. The house at Point Comfort was built by Mr. Roper, and resembles the Roper house on John's Island. Both are going to ruin. On the plantation can be seen the remains of this beautiful house built of brick and conforming to the strictest architectural code. It is said by Mrs. R. P. Tucker (Cornelia Ramsauer) to be the most satisfying situation for and design of a home of elegance and beauty but now gone to ruin, although Mrs. Tucker states that even yet a student of architecture would find a perfect example of early American architecture at its best in the front and side elevation of this large brick house. The house is situated upon a knoll, and is surrounded by oak trees draped in moss which give a sombre aspect to this once busy plantation home, once well planted, well planned and well developed, now the lonely abode of vagrant winds. Underneath the house is a series of large arches acting as supports, the enclosed part of which affords space for the household offices and constitutes a basement. Over the central front arch is built the \"grand stairway,\" after the fashion of French Colonial houses, viz., with a central landing at the piazza level descending on either side This stairway is of marble with iron balustrades. The house itself, irrespective of the basement, has two stories and an attic. The lower floor has two very large double windows, in the French fashion, which are found on either side of the house, and lead from the piazza directly into two large front rooms, which may be at will thrown together. Inside there are (so far as the casual inspection possible from the outside reveals) splendid examples of paneling and woodwork. The house at Point Comfort will soon be a thing of the past unless steps are taken to restore to its pristine beauty this fine old place worthy of a better fate.\n\np.213: The only other really old place on John's Island is the old Roper place down near Legareville, known as Brick House. Although deserted, it is still standing, and is closely connected with the history of the Hext and Roper families, while graves of Stanyarnes and Freers are found in the little overgrown burying ground not far distant from the house. The place now belongs to the wife of Bishop Knight, who came into possession of it through her first husband, the gallant Captain William Yates.\n\nLineage Charts of SC Gen.
