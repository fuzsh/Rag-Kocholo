        "meta_description": "Signed by Author(s) - This South Carolina attorney and legislator served as the fifth Secretary of Commerce under Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933-38), in which capacity he proved critical to implementing FDR's \"New Deal\"; in 1939 he served as U.S. ambassador to Canada. Bold signature in ink on a stiff 3\" X 1Â½\" card with \"Secretary of Commerce' typed below the signature. Very good. Quite faint paper clip imprint. Original Department of Commerce transmittal envelope, cancelled on 1 February 1936, also present. A choice example from the height of his fame. - Signature",
