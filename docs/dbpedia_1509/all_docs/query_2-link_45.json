        "text": "Robert Gerald “Jerry” Roper, 71, passed away on Friday, February 12, 2021 at Memorial Hospital and Manor in Bainbridge, GA. At the time of his death he had been residing in Bainbridge for several years, but his home was in Columbus, Georgia where he was born and raised. He was a faithful reader of the Bible and loved to sing gospel songs. His favorite was Amazing Grace. He loved His Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and enjoyed watching church services on his TV. Jerry loved boxing, wrestling, football and most any other sports. Even though he always wanted a brother, he loved and enjoyed spending time with his three sisters, and he always tried to protect them.\n\nJerry was born on May 22, 1949 in Columbus, GA to the late James C. Roper and Eloise Walker Roper. He attended Jordan Vocational High School and proudly served his country in both the Marines and Navy.\n\nSurvivors include his sisters, Gail Watson, Sheila Huntington (Garry) and Angela Daniel (Tony), all of Columbus, GA and several nephews and nieces. Other than his parents, Jerry is preceded in death by his nephew, Joshua Daniel.\n\nFuneral services will be held at Vance Brooks Funeral Home, 4048 Macon Road, Columbus, GA on Saturday, February 20, 2021 beginning at 3:00 pm with Rev. Charles Hays officiating. The interment will conclude at Parkhill Cemetery. The family will receive friends on Saturday at the funeral home from 2:00 pm until 3:00 pm, one hour prior to the service. In keeping with efforts to control the spread of COVID-19, social distancing guidelines will be observed and facemasks will be required."
