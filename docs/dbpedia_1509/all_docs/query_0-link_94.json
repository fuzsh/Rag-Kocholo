        "text": "The site is comprised of a 7 foot high by 158 foot black granite wall with the names of all local veterans who died in our Nation’s wars from the American Revolution to our present conflicts. The central focus of the wall is the engraved slogan, “Freedom is not Free.”\n\nKilled in Action\n\nThe highest honor, with their names placed first after each conflict or war, is accorded those who were “Killed in Action.” The term “killed in action” includes those who died immediately, died of wounds, died while missing, died while captured, and those deemed, declared, or determined to have died during contact with hostile forces as stated in U.S. Government sources, including official documents, letters, telegrams, declarations, certificates, and official Government Websites such as the American Battlefield Monuments Commission and the National Archives Records Administration. Other recognized sources are records of the Library of Virginia, the Virginia War Memorial Foundation, newspaper articles that display the paper’s name and date of issue, United State Census, and tax records of Danville and Pittsylvania County, Virginia.\n\nDied Non Battle\n\nThe second category beneath each conflict or war following the above is “Died Non Battle.” Deaths in the line of duty because of injuries other than those sustained in contact with hostile forces to include accidents, illnesses, and unknown causes are called “Non Battle” casualties as stated in the same sources cited in the above paragraph.\n\nCriteria for names in “Killed in Action” and “Died Non Battle” categories (PDF)\n\nThere are over 1,450 names listed on the wall, all of which are listed below:"
