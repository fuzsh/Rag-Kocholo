        "text": "As a child, I loved reading. There exist numerous photos of me wearing someone else’s glasses with a book between my chubby fingers. Reading made me feel smart, and that’s the best feeling for a child when they’re in primary school. Fast forward to Year 10 in high school: 15-year-old me hadn’t read a book for pleasure in a good few years. But I loved studying English literature so, in an attempt to rediscover my love for reading, I picked up the first book whose name I recognised in the library: The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown.\n\nAt 15 I was fascinated by Brown’s books. I read all of them within the span of a month. When new books were released, I’d buy them full price in retail stores so I could dive back into the world of Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks may have had something to do with this). I even went so far as to complete my GCSE presentation on Dan Brown and his use of symbology in his novels.\n\nI know precisely the reason why I was obsessed with these books. As a teenager, your mind is susceptible to believing in the extraordinary. Though I knew that the symbology and the religious meanings were mythological in nature, I remained mesmerised by the idea that something of this calibre could truly exist. I really did believe that the books were written in such a realistic fashion that whatever Brown wrote had to be true.\n\nFast forward a little more to the present. I’m currently 20 years old, almost a graduate of English, and I’ve read another 500+ books since my rediscovery of literature. I’ve travelled (not far, honestly), I’ve learned (a bit), I’ve matured (just about), and I’m more critical of the world around me because of my experiences growing up. I’ve recently embarked on a metaphorical journey, one where I make it my goal to read every book on my bookshelf. The first books I picked up were, of course, the Robert Langdon series, because they were familiar. Even five years later, they felt like home. When I picked them up, I had hoped they’d be everything I thought they were when I first read them.\n\nNaturally, I was wrong. A lot can change in five years, including your reading tastes. I went from being obsessed with the realism of Brown’s novels to being unable to understand how half of his writing made it past editors. A series named after Robert Langdon, yet most of the problems are solved by Langdon’s accomplices (always a woman, always super attractive, nearly always ends up sleeping with him).\n\nTake The Lost Symbol. Without spoiling anything, Langdon spends the majority of the book being confused while his accomplice Katherine Solomon found solutions. The writing was abysmal in this book and the characters were so under-developed that I don’t know how Brown wrote an entire book surrounding them.\n\nInferno was a step up: no romance, though Brown tries to insert some at the end, and Langdon makes his own discoveries. But on the whole, it follows the same pattern. Dan Brown’s books are formulaic: Langdon gets mysteriously caught up in a conspiracy he had no idea about, only to find out that his good friend *insert name* left him some code or symbols to figure out, the authorities are called except the authorities can’t be trusted, and finally there’s some form of solution that makes Langdon look good when in actual fact it was his accomplice who did most of the work.\n\nTonight I started Origin, and so far it looks to follow the same formula. So far, there are some religious authorities who are in danger, and Robert Langdon is about to get caught up in a huge religious conspiracy. Here’s my advice: you don’t need to read all of Brown’s books. Actually, you only need to read one Dan Brown book to know what’s going to happen in the rest of them.\n\nAs a 15-year-old, I worshipped the ground Dan Brown walked on. As a 20-year-old, I’m satisfied that I’ve moved"
