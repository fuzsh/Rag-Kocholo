As was said in a cable dispatch to THE TIMES SATURDAY REVIEW not long ago, Mr. Clemens was in London in order to superintend the publication of an edition de lux of his works. This edition will be presented simultaneously in England and America. But this is not all. We understand that there will shortly appear on the other side an authorized uniform edition of the entire works of Samuel L. Clemens. This last is the outcome of the constant appeals that have been made to the author of \"Innocents Abroad\" ever since his arrival in the British metropolis. But if a popular uniform English edition, why not a popular uniform American edition?\n\nMark Twain first made his appearance in London in 1867, through a little volume of sketches headed by the celebrated \"Story of the Jumping Frog.\" Three years later appeared in London \"Innocents Abroad; or, The New Pilgrim's Progress.\" In 1871 a number of works by this author were presented to the London public under various titles: \"Screamers,\" \"Eye-openers,\" \"A Burlesque Autobiography,\" and \"A Pleasure Trip on the Continent.\" All these books were published through Messrs. Hotten and were not authorized by the author. A collection of Mark Twain's writings was publisher over there by J. C. Hotten in 1873 entitled \"Choice Humorous Works,\" and to the following year Messrs. Chatto presented a collection called \"Choice Works,\" and then, in 1876, came \"Tom Sawyer\" and in 1880 \"Tramps Abroad,\" and so on - the later works being copyrighted editions.\n\nThe edition de lux now in preparation will be an autograph one, in twenty-two octavo volumes. \"Innocents Abroad\" together with a critical estimate of the famous humorist by Prof. Brander Matthews, will occupy the first two. This critique includes 7,000 words, and is said to be very exhaustive. The arrangement of the edition, which will be limited to something over 1,000 sets for America and England, is as follows:\n\nBOOKS OF TRAVEL.\n\n\"The Innocents Abroad,\" illustrated by Peter Newell, two volumes. With biographical criticism by Brander Matthews.\n\n\"A Tramp Abroad,\" illustrated by T. De Thulstrup, two volumes.\n\n\"Following the Equator,\" illustrated by A. B. Frost, Frederick Dielman, and others, two volumes.\n\n\"Roughing It,\" illustrated by B. W. Clinedinst, two volumes.\n\n\"Life on the Mississippi,\" illustrated by E. H. Garret, one volume.\n\nFICTION.\n\n\"The Gilded Age,\" illustrated by W. T. Smedley, two volumes.\n\n\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, \" illustrated by J. G. Brown, one volume.\n\n\"Huckleberry Finn,\" illustrated by E. W. Kemble, one volume.\n\n\"Pudd'nhead Wilson,\" illustrated by E. W. Kemble, one volume.\n\n\"The Prince and the Pauper, \" illustrated by Frank T. Merrill, one volume.\n\n\"Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,\" illustrated by Dan Beard, one volume.\n\n\"Joan of Arc,\" illustrated by F. V. DuMond, two volumes\n\nSHORT STORIES AND SKETCHES.\n\nVol. I., illustrated by F. B. Opper, one volume.\n\nVol. II., illustrated by A. B. Frost, one volume\n\nVol. III, illustrated by Dan Beard, one volume.\n\nLiterary Essays, one volume.\n\nA special feature of this edition is the series of frontispieces, which will be reproductions of photographs and paintings of the author made at a period near the time when the different tales were written. The portraits are etchings or photogravures, and include a reproduction of the latest portrait of Mark Twain, painted by Spiridon in Vienna, in 1898. With two exceptions the illustrators of the volumes are Americans. Their names are J. G. Brown, A. B. Frost, W. T. Smedley, Peter Newell, B. W. Clinedinst, Dan Beard, F. B. Opper, Frank J. Merrill, E. W. Kemble, T. De Thulstrup, E. H. Garrett, F. V. DuMond, Frederick Dielman, Allan Gilbert, Thomas Fogarty, John Harley, and W. H. W. Bicknell."
