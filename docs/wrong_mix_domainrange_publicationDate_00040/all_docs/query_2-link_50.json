        "text": "Dan Brown Biography\n\nDan Brown is the author of many bestselling novels, including the #1 New York Times bestseller, The Da Vinci Code. He is a graduate of Amherst College and Phillips Exeter Academy, where he spent time as an English teacher before turning his efforts fully to writing.\n\nIn 1996, Dans interest in code-breaking and covert government agencies led him to write his first novel, Digital Fortress, which quickly became a #1 national bestselling eBook. Set within the clandestine National Security Agency, the novel explores the fine line between civilian privacy and national security. Browns follow-up techno-thriller, Deception Point, centered on similar issues of morality in politics, national security, and classified technology.\n\nThe son of a Presidential Award winning math professor and of a professional sacred musician, Brown grew up surrounded by the paradoxical philosophies of science and religion. These complementary perspectives served as inspiration for his acclaimed novel Angels & Demonsa science vs. religion thriller set within a Swiss physics lab and Vatican City, which was followed by the runaway bestseller The Da Vinci Code.\n\nDans wife Blythe - an art historian and painter - collaborates on his research and accompanies him on his frequent research trips.\n\nIn its first week on sale, The Da Vinci Code achieved unprecedented success when it debuted at #1 on The New York Times Bestseller list, simultaneously topping bestseller lists at The Wall Street Journal, Publishers Weekly, and San Francisco Chronicle. Later, the book went on to hit #1 on virtually every major national bestseller list. Dan Brown's novels have been translated and published around the world.\n\nOrigin, the fifth in the Robert Langdon series, is due to publish in September 2017.\n\nDan Brown's website\n\nThis bio was last updated on 11/28/2016.

He also reveals his personal writing habits, which include hanging upside-down from a pair of gravity boots!\n\nHow would you describe The Da Vinci Code to someone who has not read any of your previous novels?\n\nThe Da Vinci Code is the story of renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, who is summoned to the Louvre Museum to examine a series of cryptic symbols relating to Da Vinci's artwork. In decrypting the code, he uncovers the key to one of the greatest mysteries of all time and he becomes a hunted man. One of the many qualities that makes The Da Vinci Code unique is the factual nature of the story. All the history, artwork, ancient documents, and secret rituals in the novel are accurate as are the hidden codes revealed in some of Da Vinci's most famous paintings.\n\nWill your next book also feature Robert Langdon?\n\nIndeed. I intend to make Robert Langdon my primary character for years to come. His expertise in symbology and iconography affords him the luxury of virtually endless adventures in exotic locales. Currently, I have rough sketches for almost a dozen Robert Langdon thrillers set in mysterious locations around the globe.\n\nCurrently I'm writing another Robert Langdon thriller - the sequel to The Da Vinci Code. For the first time, Langdon will find himself embroiled in a mystery on U.S...\n\nMembership Advantages\n\nReviews\n\n\"Beyond the Book\" articles\n\nFree books to read and review (US only)\n\nFind books by time period, setting & theme\n\nRead-alike suggestions by book and author\n\nBook club discussions\n\nand much more!\n\nJust $45 for 12 months or $15 for 3 months.\n\nMore about membership!"
