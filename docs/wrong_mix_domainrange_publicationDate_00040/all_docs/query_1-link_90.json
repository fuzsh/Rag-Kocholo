        "text": "Very entertaining\n\nFirst twain book on audible. it was funny, insightful, and generally an entertaining story. Great narrator and a great author. Feels like it could have been written today.\n\nNot the best of Twain\n\nBut \"not the best of Twain\" is still better than most.\n\nI'd read this many years ago, and picked up the Audio as a daily deal. Dufris is a very accomplished narrator and does a fine job here.\n\nThis is primarily a satirical novel, in which Twain lauds the nobility of the ignoble, while excoriating the ignominy of the nobility. His observations on slavery are deeply compelling. One must note that this book was written with the Civil War very much in living memory, and one can only imagine the controversy such writing would evoke. There are also longish passages on economic issues which would have been extremely topical in 1890, but much less so today.\n\nSome will feel that a satirical piece of this length is just one long harangue. Perhaps it is, but Twain's wit and essential gentility keep it from becoming dark.\n\nOne of the Best Stories\n\nSuch a great story. I absolutely loved it. The story, the narration, the acting, everything is brilliant. You really get lost in the story. William Dufris is amazing. He does such a wonderful job. I really enjoyed listening to him. I will try to find more of his audiobooks. Recommended!!!\n\nEntertaining, but a bit slow in places\n\nWould you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?\n\nIf they liked Sci Fi, this is the earliest example of popular alternate history work that I am aware of and its fairly good writing.\n\nWhat other book might you compare A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court to and why?\n\nParts of the book are very 'Mark Twain' kind of amusing yarn spinning, and other parts read more like modern sci-fi.\n\nWhat does William Dufris bring to the story that you wouldnâ€™t experience if you just read the book?\n\nExcellent reader. I'll probably look for other books he's read and consider buying them no matter what they are.\n\nWas there a moment in the book that particularly moved you?\n\nNot particularly.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nI'm sure I'll keep this is my rotation of books and read it at least a few more times. There were a few slow parts, and some parts that were just too rooted in the time it was written for me to really follow completely, but overall I liked it.\n\nMark Twain is a genius\n\nWhat made the experience of listening to A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court the most enjoyable?\n\nI read this in high school and it was a great read. The only issue I have is the older bigger words make it hard to listen to when you are at work and just wanted something to listen too.\n\nOutstanding Performance\n\nIt hardly seems worth it to be reviewing Mr Twain after all these years. Connecticut Yankee is pointed and funny. I found myself wishing I was better prepared to get the topical matter. Not that I am bad at the 19th Century, I just know it would be funnier if I lived it. Anyway, the point of the review was to credit William Dufris' excellent narration. He really nails Twain's Yankee character. I found his voicing of some of the other characters, Clarence in particular, a little grating, but more than balanced by his excellent job with the narrator.\n\nTwain and Woo\n\nWhere does A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court rank among all the audiobooks youâ€™ve listened to so far?\n\nA fun book to read. Top 25 in my reading list.\n\nWhich scene was your favorite?\n\nThe destruction of Merlin's tower.\n\nWas this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?\n\nThis book will keep you interested all the way through.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nWhen faced with logic and reason, people still believe the woo."
