An American author and humorist, he is most noted for his novels, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876), and its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885). The latter is often referred to as \"the Great American Novel.\"\n\nTwain grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, which later provided the setting for both Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer. Early on, he apprenticed with a printer and worked as a typesetter. In addition, he contributed articles to his older brother Orion's newspaper. After toiling as a printer in various cities, he became a master riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River. \"Mark Twain\" was a nautical term. He headed west to join Orion. As it turned out, he was a failure at gold mining, so, next, he turned to journalism. While a reporter, he wrote a humorous story, The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County. A popular story, it brought him nationwide attention. His travelogues were also well-received. Twain had finally found his true calling.\n\nHe achieved great success as a writer and public speaker. His wit and satire earned praise from critics and peers, and he was a friend to presidents, artists, industrialists, and European royalty.¹ read more\n\nMark Twain Quotes\n\n\"It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.\"\n\n\"Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.\"\n\n\"All generalizations are false, including this one.\"\n\nMark Twain Sites\n\nThe Mark Twain House and Museum\n\nThe Official Mark Twain Site\n\nMark Twain's Literature Online\n\n¹ Mark Twain's Bio at Wikipedia"
