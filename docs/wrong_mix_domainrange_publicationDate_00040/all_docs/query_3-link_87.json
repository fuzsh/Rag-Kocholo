With his signature mix of intrigue, suspense, and knowledge, Brown will keep readers on the edge of their seats as Langdon unravels a mystery that threatens to change the course of humanity.\n\nWith the hallmark twists and turns that have made Dan Brown one of the most successful writers of all time, this latest Robert Langdon adventure will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.\n\nBrown's novels transcend language barriers, published in a staggering 52 languages across the world and boasting an incredible 200 million copies in print. This global recognition is a testament to his storytelling skill.\n\nIn a nod to his impact on both the literary world and popular culture, TIME Magazine recognized Dan Brown in 2005 as one of the \"100 Most Influential People in the World.\" TIME's editors credited him with reinvigorating the publishing industry, reigniting fascination with the life and legacy of Leonardo da Vinci, shedding new light on early Christian history, and driving tourism to the iconic cities of Paris and Rome. His books have stirred curiosity about secret societies, invited criticism from Cardinals in Rome, inspired numerous works disputing the claims in his novels, and ushered in a wave of historical thrillers. Additionally, his novels have been adapted into a major motion picture franchise, amplifying their cultural impact.\n\nBorn to a mathematics teacher and a church organist, Dan Brown's upbringing was marked by a unique blend of science and religion, which sparked his enduring fascination with the interplay of these seemingly contradictory themes. This fascination has provided the backdrop for many of his literary works.\n\nDan Brown's educational journey includes graduating from Amherst College and attending Phillips Exeter Academy. His passion for literature and education led him to a return to Phillips Exeter Academy, where he taught English before making the full transition to writing."
