I'll probably take a little break for awhile.\"\n\nSorry, Tom Hanks. (Hanks is the actor who starred as Langdon in the movies based on Brown's blockbuster book series, which includes Angels & Demons, Inferno, The Lost Symbol, and The Da Vinci Code.)\n\nIn the interview, Brown expands on his interest in Robert Langdon as the kind of adventuresome man he wishes he could be.\n\nIn his travels abroad and in his research for \"Origin,\" Brown notes he imagines a scene or subject as Langdon might.\n\n\"Without a doubt,\" he says, \"when I'm traveling I'm seeing through Langdon's eyes.\""
