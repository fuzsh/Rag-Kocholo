        "text": "#1 New York Times bestselling author Dan Brown is back with a paperback edition of his debut picture book, the lyrically mindful, humorous, musical, and uniquely entertaining WILD SYMPHONY!\n\nTravel through the trees and across the seas with Maestro Mouse and his musical friends! Young readers will meet a big blue whale and speedy cheetahs, tiny beetles and graceful swans. Each has a special secret to share.\n\nAlong the way, you might spot the surprises Maestro Mouse has left for you-a hiding buzzy bee, jumbled letters that spell out clues, and even a coded message to solve!\n\nChildren and adults can enjoy this timeless picture book as a traditional read-along, or can choose to listen to original musical compositions as they read-one for each animal-using a free interactive smartphone app which uses augmented reality to instantly play the appropriate song for each page when the camera of a mobile device is held over it."
