He enjoys moderate success before the forces of reaction strike back, with ferocity which brings the dream to an apocalyptic end.

BAL 3429; Wright III, 1090.\n\nHardcover. Condition: Fine. 1st Edition. TWAIN, Mark. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur s Court. New York: Charles L. Webster. 1889. FIRST AMERICAN EDITION (220 x 180 mm) pp. 575, [ii publisher ads]. Floral endpapers. Gift inscription from 1947 on front fly leaf. First edition, mix state issue but early: lacks half title on recto of frontispiece, lacks the s-shaped ornament between The and King on p. 59, has broken text on p. 72. Very minor wear to end-bands, minor scuffing to foredge, but otherwise NEAR FINE condition. In part inspired by a dream, and in part inspired by reading the 15th century Le Morte d Arthur, as many have done before him Mark Twain adapted the legends of King Arthur to reflect and comment on his own society. Like the misty origins of the tales of King Arthur, the first issue of the first edition of A Connecticut Yankee is somewhat mysterious. Its original proportions are not known and there are three states that indicate priority: an s-shaped ornament on p. 59 that was later omitted; the last two lines of p. 72 appear with perfect and broken type; and only a few copies are recorded has having the half-title printed on the recto of the frontispiece. These markers, however, appear in random combinations and the confused state of these states is evident by their presence and absences in copies personally given by Twain for Christmas in 1889. Thus, the present copy is likely not a first state, but is certainly an early one.

A desirable collector's copy in the primary first issue state. \"This satirical time travel fantasy was composed after Twain had read Malory's famous version of the legends of the knights of the Round Table. An unusual entry into the time-travel novels of the 19th century, featuring a fantastical (that is, unexplained and natural) means of landing in another time rather than a mechanical (science fiction) means: like Irving's Rip Van Winkle and Bellamy's Back Ward (and later, Johnson's Light Ahead for the Negro), the hero travels in time after a loss in consciousness. Here Hank travels backwards in time, rather than forward, into Arthurian England - where he uses his modern knowledge to play the part of a magician. From across the centuries Twain can use the time-honored science-fiction tradition of distance, physical or temporal, to comment obliquely on the issues of his own contemporary world.\" (Type Punch Matrix) First Ediiton with matching dates of 1889 on the title and copyright pages.

CONDITION: Very good, small chip at front edge of spine, inner front hinge paper cracked, but hinge still firm with very little slackness, slightly cocked. First edition, first state, with small S-like ornament in between the words of the caption on pg. 59. An ambitious science-fiction narrative about a 19th-century American's attempts to bring modern technology and political ideology to 16th-century England. Inspired both by elements of feudal life that he observed in Hawaii in 1866 and Arthurian romances, Twain was hard at work onn this novel by 1886. Chancing upon illustrator Dan Beard's work as he completed his manuscript, Twain sought Beard's services to illustrate Connecticut Yankee.Through close collaboration, Beard's 220 pictures fully realize Twain's intentions while also enhancing the book's humor and political message. BAL 3429; Rasmussen, Kent.

A near fine copy, tight and clean and well preserved internally, the binding and giltwork bright and clean, a few old small spots to the cloth, an abrasion to the rear cover at the fore edge. FIRST EDITION IN ORIGINAL CLOTH. Twain's classic story of a hapless Yankee transported back in time to the court of King Arthur. The familiar characters of the Camelot legend, the monarchy, and even the church are transformed by Twain's gift for satire. Beard's illustrations are rendered with vigor and good humor well-suited to this amusing tale. Over the years the story has been among Twain's most often imitated with a wide range of movies, books and television episodes drawing on the theme. Even Bugs Bunny acted out the role of Twain's Yankee hero and Bing Crosby gave him a singing voice.\n\nFirst U.S. edition. Publisher's prospectus or salesman's dummy with half-title page, frontis illustration, title page, contents pages, \"List of Illustrations\" (explaining why there is no list of illustrations); Twain's preface, and a sampling of pages from the text interspersed with full-plate illustrations (versus inset, as they appear in the eventual publication). 16-page illustrated insert bound in at rear with 18 images -- each with a caption explaining its meaning by Fred Hall, Twain's agent at Webster. One stands out in particular, as the explanation is for a scene clearly not in the book (\"This picture well illustrates a story told of Abraham Lincoln, An English nobleman said to him ,\").Final leaf has \"Publisher's Announcement\" on recto and ad for the book on verso. Lacking the subscription forms, which should follow but have clearly been torn out, and one of the leather-spine samples from the front, which has clearly been removed.
