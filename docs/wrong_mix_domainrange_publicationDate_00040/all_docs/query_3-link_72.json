        "text": "If you want to know all the Dan Brown books in order of when they were published, then you’ve come to the right place!\n\nKnown as the author of the Robert Langdon series, Dan Brown novels are famous around the world with titles such as The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons being turned into Hollywood blockbusters.\n\nBooks by Dan Brown tend to be thrillers and focus on a treasure hunt for clues to avert disaster. They also have historical themes and take place in European cities such as Rome and Seville.\n\nSome of these books by Dan Brown in order may surprise you, as he has written about some different topics than you might imagine.\n\nIf you want an overview of all his books and why you should check them out, this post is for you!\n\nDan Brown Books In Order\n\nDigital Fortress (1998)\n\nDigital Fortress is Dan Brown’s first book published back in 1998. It’s a bit different from most of the other books on this list as it’s primarily a techno-thriller rather than one based on religion or history.\n\nSet in 1996, an NSA supercomputer, TRANSLTR, that’s renowned for its code-breaking prowess encounters a code that it cannot crack, Digital Fortress.\n\nThe NSA calls in Susan Fletcher, a cryptographer and the protagonist of the novel to help crack the code and discover who created it.\n\nDigital Fortress isn’t one of the best Dan Brown books in my opinion, but if you’re interested in reading some of his earlier works to see how he developed his style, then it’s worth a read.\n\nAngels & Demons (2000)\n\nAngels & Demons is the first of Dan Brown’s books to feature Robert Langdon. You’re likely familiar with the story as it was turned into a movie, but the book is just as riveting if not more so.\n\nThe plot is similar to the movie in that a scientist at CERN, who has discovered how to create antimatter, is murdered and branded across the chest with the word Illuminati. Then, four cardinals who are in contention to become the next Pope are kidnapped.\n\nLangdon has to race around Rome and find clues in a variety of churches to try and prevent this from happening and find out who’s behind the plot.\n\nAngels & Demons is an intriguing read, which I enjoyed. If you want a thriller that will keep you engaged until the end, it’s the book for you.\n\nDeception Point (2001)\n\nDeception Point is one of the most underrated Dan Brown books and one of the few that doesn’t feature Robert Langdon.\n\nThe plot revolves around White House intelligence analyst, Rachel Sexton, and her involvement in corroborating a discovery of a meteorite by NASA that might contain extraterrestrial life.\n\nHer investigation is further complicated by the upcoming presidential election in which her father is running against the incumbent, Zachary Herney.\n\nIt’s a riveting book and I read it in a few days as the plot engrossed me. Deception Point may not feature Robert Langdon, but it shows that Brown can craft a compelling story without him.\n\nDeception Point\n\nThe Da Vinci Code (2003)\n\nThe Da Vinci Code is the most famous Dan Brown book on this list. It made him a household name and generated a lot of controversy in the process.\n\nSuch was its popularity, that it was turned into a Hollywood movie starring Tom Hanks. The plot involves a murder in the Louvre, which results in Langdon becoming involved in a battle between Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion over the possibility that Jesus and Mary Magdalene had a child together.\n\nAs is usual with books by Dan Brown, there’s a lot of intrigue and mystery as Langdon tries to piece together the clues that relate to the murder and what they mean.\n\nThe Da Vinci Code is an infamous book and although it may not be the most historically accurate, the plot is gripping and you’ll be turning the pages continuously to find out what happens!\n\nThe Lost Symbol (2009)\n\nThe Lost Symbol is the third Dan Brown book to feature Robert Langdon and is set after the events of The Da Vinci Code.\n\nIt’s a thriller set in Washington D.C. and we again follow Langdon as he tries to recover an artefact to save his friend, Peter Soloman, who’s been kidnapped.\n\nIf you enjoyed Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code, the book’s outline is the same. Langdon has to follow a set of clues to avert disaster and has some close calls along the way.\n\nThe Lost Symbol is an entertaining read and one you’ll find hard to put down as you follow Langdon and his quest across Washington D.C.\n\nInferno (2013)\n\nInferno is the fourth book in the Robert Langdon series and finds him waking up in a Florence hospital with no idea of how he got there.\n\nLangdon then has to escape assassins and decipher clues hidden inside a cylinder that reveal Botticelli’s Map of Hell, based on Dante’s Inferno, all while trying to recover his recent memories.\n\nIt’s a thriller and a fast-paced one as Langdon comes to terms with the situation he’s in. I don’t want to reveal too much about the plot if you haven’t read the book, but it’s an exciting read and will have you turning page after page.\n\nInferno was also turned into a movie, so if you’ve seen the film you’ll be familiar with the plot. But it’s still worth reading the book, as there’s more detail than you’ll find in the movie.\n\nOrigin (2017)\n\nOrigin is the fifth book in the Robert Langdon series which is predominately set in Spain seeing Langdon visit the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and Sagrada Familia in Barcelona among others.\n\nThe plot revolves around artificial intelligence and the attempts by Edmond Kirsch, who was a former pupil of Langdon’s, to discover the origin of humanity.\n\nOrigin is probably the weakest of the Dan Brown books involving Robert Langdon. The dialogue feels a bit forced and the plot is somewhat convoluted and not as enjoyable as either Angels & Demons or The Da Vinci Code.\n\nHowever, I’d recommend reading the book if you’re a fan of the series. You’ll likely enjoy the action and of course, you will then have read all of the books in the series too!\n\nWild Symphony (2020)\n\nWild Symphony is the most unique of Dan Brown’s books on this list and unlike all the others.\n\nIt’s a picture book that’s aimed at children and follows a character called Maestro Mouse and his friends in a series of musical adventures.\n\nIf you have children, it’s a brilliant book they’ll love to read and which they can either read by themselves or you can read with them.\n\nLooking For More Books?\n\nBest Michael Crichton Books – Crichton’s books are similar to Brown’s in that they are thrillers but they tend to focus on scientific themes. If you enjoy Brown’s work, you’ll also enjoy Crichton’s!\n\nBest Michio Kaku Books – Nonfiction books by the famous physicist. With some of Brown’s books touching on these themes, if you want to learn more Kaku is the man to read.\n\nBest Matt Haig Books – Haig’s books are perfect if you’re looking for something lighter to read after Dan Brown.\n\nBest George Orwell Books – Orwell’s books are more serious than Brown’s but they are a good counterpoint to his work and well worth reading."
