Reichskommissariat Niederlande is the German government for the occupied Netherlands. It borders the Greater Germanic Reich to the east, and the SS State of Burgundy to the south. The nation is governed by a German Reichskommissar and the collaborationist Dutch government, headed by the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands.

Death of Arthur Seyss-Inquart

Very soon after the death of Hitler, Seyss-Inquart follows suit along with his authority. In his place, the Occupational Authorities takes charge, but ultimately with no power. This causes a power struggle, which multiple factions will try to usurp power. Depending on the outcome of the German Civil War, this new government can either be replaced by a government friendly towards Germania or realign itself with the Einheitspakt either by diplomacy or war.
