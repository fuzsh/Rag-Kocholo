        "text": "THE BEGINN ING OF THE FINAL SOLUTION\n\nYad Vashem\n\nThe mass murder of the Jews began with the German invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. By the end of 1941 80% of Lithuanian Jewry had been murdered.\n\nby the beginning of 1943, most Jews in the western parts of Ukraine and Belorussia had been murdered.\n\nAdditionally, Romanians and Germans murdered 150,000 Romanian and Ukrainian Jews in the first months after the invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn January 1942 a conference was held in Wannsee, a suburb of Berlin, in order to coordinate the implementation of the âFinal Solution of the Jewish Questionâ, the codename for the plan to murder all Jews within reach.\n\nSee also Videos and Films\n\nTHE WANNSEE C ONFERENCE\n\nHolocaust Research Project\n\nOn January 20, 1942, fifteen high-ranking Nazi party and German government leaders gathered for an important meeting.\n\nThe meeting or conference (as it came to be known), was organized by Adolf Eichmann (SS-SturmbannfÅ¸hrer), at the order of Reinhard Heydrich, Chief of the German State Police and of the SD (\"Sicherheitsdienst\", \"Security Service of the SS\").\n\nThe conference was held in a suburb of Berlin at a villa by a lake known as Wannsee. The goal of this conference was the debate of the so-called \"Final Solution of the Jewish Question\". Heydrich wanted to harmonize the organisation and implementation of that \"Final Solution\" with every office and administrative department that was to participate in it.\n\nFifteen people attended the conference including high ranking party officials and SS- officers from the \"Reichssicherheitshauptamt\" (RSHA, \"Central Security Office of the Reich\"), as well as two representatives of the \"Ministry of the Occupied Regions in the East\", one representative of the Ministry for the Interior, one representative of the \"Commissioner of the Four-Year-Plan\", one representative of the Ministry for Justice, one representative of the Office of the \"General Governor of the occupied Polish Regions\", and one representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nHeydrich opened the meeting with the announcement that Hermann GÃ¶ring, the Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, President of the Reichstag, Prime Minister of Prussia, and last but not least the designated second in command in the National Socialist hierarchy. Adolf Hitler had granted him an extensive degree of power which included the coordination of all anti-Jewish measures.\n\nThe purpose of the meeting was to outline the newly planned Final Solution would entail the rounding up of all Jews throughout Europe. They would be transported eastward and organized into labor gangs. Work and living conditions would be extremely harsh as to kill large numbers by natural reduction. Any survivors would be treated accordingly. Treated accordingly was euphemism for extermination.\n\nThe final protocol of the Wannsee Conference never explicitly mentioned extermination, but within a few months after the meeting, the first gas chambers were installed in some of the extermination camps in Poland. These six camps, Belzec, Birkenau, Chelmno, Majdanek, Sobibor, and Treblinka were in operation in Poland.\n\nResponsibility for the entire project was placed in the hands of Heinrich Himmler, ReichsfÃ¼hrer-SS, and head of the Gestapo and the Waffen-SS.\n\nThe Wannsee Conference did not mark the beginning of the \"Final Solution.\" The mobile killing squads were already slaughtering Jews in the occupied Soviet Union. Rather, the Wannsee Conference was the place where the \"final solution\" was formally revealed to non-Nazi leaders who would help arrange for Jews to be transported from all over German-occupied Europe to SS-operated \"extermination\" camps in Poland. Not one of the men present at Wannsee objected to the announced policy. Never before had a modern state committed itself to the murder of an entire people.\n\nTHE MINUTES FROM THE WANNSEE CONFERENCE\n\nJanuary 20, 1942\n\nHolocaust Research Project\n\nAt the beginning of the discussion Chief of the Security Police and of the SD, SS-ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer Heydrich, reported that the Reich Marshal had appointed him delegate for the preparations for the final solution of the Jewish question in Europe and pointed out that this discussion had been called for the purpose of clarifying fundamental questions. The wish of the Reich Marshal to have a draft sent to him concerning organizational, factual and material interests in relation to the final solution of the Jewish question in Europe makes necessary an initial common action of all central offices immediately concerned with these questions in order to bring their general activities into line. The ReichsfÃ¼hrer-SS and the Chief of the German Police (Chief of the Security Police and the SD) was entrusted with the official central handling of the final solution of the Jewish question without regard to geographic borders. The Chief of the Security Police and the SD then gave a short report of the struggle which has been carried on thus far against this enemy, the essential points being the following:\n\na) the expulsion of the Jews from every sphere of life of the German people,\n\nb) the expulsion of the Jews from the living space of the German people.\n\nIn carrying out these efforts, an increased and planned acceleration of the emigration of the Jews from Reich territory was started, as the only possible present solution.\n\nBy order of the Reich Marshal, a Reich Central Office for Jewish Emigration was set up in January 1939 and the Chief of the Security Police and SD was entrusted with the management. Its most important tasks were\n\na) to make all necessary arrangements for the preparation for an increased emigration of the Jews,\n\nb) to direct the flow of emigration,\n\nc) to speed the procedure of emigration in each individual case.\n\nThe aim of all this was to cleanse German living space of Jews in a legal manner.\n\nAll the offices realized the drawbacks of such enforced accelerated emigration. For the time being they had, however, tolerated it on account of the lack of other possible solutions of the problem.\n\nThe work concerned with emigration was, later on, not only a German problem, but also a problem with which the authorities of the countries to which the flow of emigrants was being directed would have to deal. Financial difficulties, such as the demand by various foreign governments for increasing sums of money to be presented at the time of the landing, the lack of shipping space, increasing restriction of entry permits, or the cancelling of such, increased extraordinarily the difficulties of emigration. In spite of these difficulties, 537,000 Jews were sent out of the country between the takeover of power and the deadline of 31 October 1941. Of these\n\napproximately 360,000 were in Germany proper on 30 January 1933\n\napproximately 147,000 were in Austria (Ostmark) on 15 March 1939\n\napproximately 30,000 were in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia on 15 March 1939.\n\nThe Jews themselves, or their Jewish political organizations, financed the emigration. In order to avoid impoverished Jews' remaining behind, the principle was followed that wealthy Jews have to finance the emigration of poor Jews; this was arranged by imposing a suitable tax, i.e., an emigration tax, which was used for financial arrangements in connection with the emigration of poor Jews and was imposed according to income.\n\nApart from the necessary Reichsmark exchange, foreign currency had to presented at the time of landing. In order to save foreign exchange held by Germany, the foreign Jewish financial organizations were - with the help of Jewish organizations in Germany - made responsible for arranging an adequate amount of foreign currency. Up to 30 October 1941, these foreign Jews donated a total of around 9,500,000 dollars.\n\nIn the meantime the ReichsfÃ¼hrer-SS and Chief of the German Police had prohibited emigration of Jews due to the dangers of an emigration in wartime and due to the possibilities of the East.\n\nIII.\n\nAnother possible solution of the problem has now taken the place of emigration, i.e. the evacuation of the Jews to the East, provided that the FÃ¼hrer gives the appropriate approval in advance.\n\nThese actions are, however, only to be considered provisional, but practical experience is already being collected which is of the greatest importance in relation to the future final solution of the Jewish question.\n\nApproximately 11 million Jews will be involved in the final solution of the European Jewish question, distributed as follows among the individual countries:\n\nThe number of Jews given here for foreign countries includes, however, only those Jews who still adhere to the Jewish faith, since some countries still do not have a definition of the term \"Jew\" according to racial principles.\n\nThe handling of the problem in the individual countries will meet with difficulties due to the attitude and outlook of the people there, especially in Hungary and Rumania. Thus, for example, even today the Jew can buy documents in Rumania that will officially prove his foreign citizenship.\n\nThe influence of the Jews in all walks of life in the USSR is well known. Approximately five million Jews live in the European part of the USSR, in the Asian part scarcely 1/4 million.\n\nThe breakdown of Jews residing in the European part of the USSR\n\naccording to trades was approximately as follows:\n\nAgriculture 9.1 %\n\nUrban workers 14.8 %\n\nIn trade 20.0 %\n\nEmployed by the state 23.4 %\n\nIn private occupations\n\nsuch as medical profession, press, theater, etc.\n\n32.7%\n\nUnder proper guidance, in the course of the final solution the Jews are to be allocated for appropriate labor in the East. Able-bodied Jews, separated according to sex, will be taken in large work columns to these areas for work on roads, in the course of which action doubtless a large portion will be eliminated by natural causes.\n\nThe possible final remnant will, since it will undoubtedly consist of the most resistant portion, have to be treated accordingly, because it is the product of natural selection and would, if released, act as a the seed of a new Jewish revival (see the experience of history.)\n\nIn the course of the practical execution of the final solution, Europe will be combed through from west to east. Germany proper, including the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, will have to be handled first due to the housing problem and additional social and political necessities.\n\nThe evacuated Jews will first be sent, group by group, to so-called transit ghettos, from which they will be transported to the East.\n\nSS-ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer Heydrich went on to say that an important prerequisite for the evacuation as such is the exact definition of the persons involved.\n\nIt is not intended to evacuate Jews over 65 years old, but to send them to an old-age ghetto - Theresienstadt is being considered for this purpose.\n\nIn addition to these age groups - of the approximately 280,000 Jews in Germany proper and Austria on 31 October 1941, approximately 30% are over 65 years old - severely wounded veterans and Jews with war decorations (Iron Cross I) will be accepted in the old-age ghettos. With this expedient solution, in one fell swoop many interventions will be prevented.\n\nThe beginning of the individual larger evacuation actions will largely depend on military developments. Regarding the handling of the final solution in those European countries occupied and influenced by us, it was proposed that the appropriate expert of the Foreign Office discuss the matter with the responsible official of the Security Police and SD.\n\nIn Slovakia and Croatia the matter is no longer so difficult, since the most substantial problems in this respect have already been brought near a solution. In Rumania the government has in the meantime also appointed a commissioner for Jewish affairs. In order to settle the question in Hungary, it will soon be necessary to force an adviser for Jewish questions onto the Hungarian government.\n\nWith regard to taking up preparations for dealing with the problem in Italy, SS-ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer Heydrich considers it opportune to contact the chief of police with a view to these problems.\n\nIn occupied and unoccupied France, the registration of Jews for evacuation will in all probability proceed without great difficulty.\n\nUnder Secretary of State Luther calls attention in this matter to the fact that in some countries, such as the Scandinavian states, difficulties will arise if this problem is dealt with thoroughly and that it will therefore be advisable to defer actions in these countries. Besides, in view of the small numbers of Jews affected, this deferral will not cause any substantial limitation.\n\nThe Foreign Office sees no great difficulties for southeast and western Europe.\n\nSS-GruppenfÃ¼hrer Hofmann plans to send an expert to Hungary from the Race and Settlement Main Office for general orientation at the time when the Chief of the Security Police and SD takes up the matter there. It was decided to assign this expert from the Race and Settlement Main Office, who will not work actively, as an assistant to the police attachÃ©.\n\nIV.\n\nIn the course of the final solution plans, the Nuremberg Laws should provide a certain foundation, in which a prerequisite for the absolute solution of the problem is also the solution to the problem of mixed marriages and persons of mixed blood.\n\nThe Chief of the Security Police and the SD discusses the following points, at first theoretically, in regard to a letter from the chief of the Reich chancellery:\n\n(Editors Note: The Nazis developed their own definition of âWho is a Jew ?â\n\nThis was called the Mischling Test).\n\n1) Treatment of Persons of Mixed Blood of the First Degree\n\nPersons of mixed blood of the first degree will, as regards the final solution of the Jewish question, be treated as Jews.\n\nFrom this treatment the following exceptions will be made:\n\na) Persons of mixed blood of the first degree married to persons of German blood if their marriage has resulted in children (persons of mixed blood of the second degree). These persons of mixed blood of the second degree are to be treated essentially as Germans.\n\nb) Persons of mixed blood of the first degree, for whom the highest offices of the Party and State have already issued exemption permits in any sphere of life. Each individual case must be examined, and it is not ruled out that the decision may be made to the detriment of the person of mixed blood.\n\nThe prerequisite for any exemption must always be the personal merit of the person of mixed blood. (Not the merit of the parent or spouse of German blood.)\n\nPersons of mixed blood of the first degree who are exempted from evacuation will be sterilized in order to prevent any offspring and to eliminate the problem of persons of mixed blood once and for all. Such sterilization will be voluntary. But it is required to remain in the Reich. The sterilized \"person of mixed blood\" is thereafter free of all restrictions to which he was previously subjected.\n\n2) Treatment of Persons of Mixed Blood of the Second Degree\n\nPersons of mixed blood of the second degree will be treated fundamentally as persons of German blood, with the exception of the following cases, in which the persons of mixed blood of the second degree will be considered as Jews:\n\na) The person of mixed blood of the second degree was born of a marriage in which both parents are persons of mixed blood.\n\nb) The person of mixed blood of the second degree has a racially especially undesirable appearance that marks him outwardly as a Jew.\n\nc) The person of mixed blood of the second degree has a particularly bad police and political record that shows that he feels and behaves like a Jew.\n\nAlso in these cases exemptions should not be made if the person of mixed blood of the second degree has married a person of German blood.\n\n3) Marriages between Full Jews and Persons of German Blood.\n\nHere it must be decided from case to case whether the Jewish partner will be evacuated or whether, with regard to the effects of such a step on the German relatives, [this mixed marriage] should be sent to an old-age ghetto.\n\n4) Marriages between Persons of Mixed Blood of the First Degree and Persons of German Blood.\n\na) Without Children.\n\nIf no children have resulted from the marriage, the person of mixed blood of the first degree will be evacuated or sent to an old-age ghetto (same treatment as in the case of marriages between full Jews and persons of German blood, point 3.)\n\nb) With Children.\n\nIf children have resulted from the marriage (persons of mixed blood of the second degree), they will, if they are to be treated as Jews, be evacuated or sent to a ghetto along with the parent of mixed blood of the first degree. If these children are to be treated as Germans (regular cases), they are exempted from evacuation as is therefore the parent of mixed blood of the first degree.\n\n5) Marriages between Persons of Mixed Blood of the First Degree and Persons of Mixed Blood of the First Degree or Jews.\n\nIn these marriages (including the children) all members of the family will be treated as Jews and therefore be evacuated or sent to an old-age ghetto.\n\n6) Marriages between Persons of Mixed Blood of the First Degree and Persons of Mixed Blood of the Second Degree.\n\nIn these marriages both partners will be evacuated or sent to an old-age ghetto without consideration of whether the marriage has produced children, since possible children will as a rule have stronger Jewish blood than the Jewish person of mixed blood of the second degree.\n\nSS-GruppenfÃ¼hrer Hofmann advocates the opinion that sterilization will have to be widely used, since the person of mixed blood who is given the choice whether he will be evacuated or sterilized would rather undergo sterilization.\n\nState Secretary Dr. Stuckart maintains that carrying out in practice of the just mentioned possibilities for solving the problem of mixed marriages and persons of mixed blood will create endless administrative work. In the second place, as the biological facts cannot be disregarded in any case, State Secretary Dr. Stuckart proposed proceeding to forced sterilization.\n\nFurthermore, to simplify the problem of mixed marriages possibilities must be considered with the goal of the legislator saying something like: \"These marriages have been dissolved.\"\n\nWith regard to the issue of the effect of the evacuation of Jews on the economy, State Secretary Neumann stated that Jews who are working in industries vital to the war effort, provided that no replacements are available, cannot be evacuated.\n\nSS-ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer Heydrich indicated that these Jews would not be evacuated according to the rules he had approved for carrying out the evacuations then underway.\n\nState Secretary Dr. BÃ¼hler stated that the General Government would welcome it if the final solution of this problem could be begun in the General Government, since on the one hand transportation does not play such a large role here nor would problems of labor supply hamper this action. Jews must be removed from the territory of the General Government as quickly as possible, since it is especially here that the Jew as an epidemic carrier represents an extreme danger and on the other hand he is causing permanent chaos in the economic structure of the country through continued black market dealings. Moreover, of the approximately 2 1/2 million Jews concerned, the majority is unfit for work.\n\nState Secretary Dr. BÃ¼hler stated further that the solution to the Jewish question in the General Government is the responsibility of the Chief of the Security Police and the SD and that his efforts would be supported by the officials of the General Government. He had only one request, to solve the Jewish question in this area as quickly as possible.\n\nIn conclusion the different types of possible solutions were discussed, during which discussion both Gauleiter Dr. Meyer and State Secretary Dr. BÃ¼hler took the position that certain preparatory activities for the final solution should be carried out immediately in the territories in question, in which process alarming the populace must be avoided.\n\nThe meeting was closed with the request of the Chief of the Security Police and the SD to the participants that they afford him appropriate support during the carrying out of the tasks involved in the solution."
