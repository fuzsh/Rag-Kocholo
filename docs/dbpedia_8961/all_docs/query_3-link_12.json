        "text": "The Greater Germanic Reich (Großgermanisches Reich), more commonly known as Germany, is a country in Central Europe. Its borders are shared to the north by the Kingdom of Denmark, to the east by RK Ostland, the General Governorate of the Vistula, and Slovakia; to the south by Croatia, the Italian Empire, Hungary, and Switzerland; and to the west by the SS State of Burgundy and RK Niederlande. They border several more countries when their colonial holdings in Europe and Africa are accounted for.\n\nThe Greater Germanic Reich is the heart of what is considered to be simply put, \"The German Reich.\" Many of their colonial holdings in Europe are believed to be an integrated part of the country, although they operate under their own local governments, often called Reichskommissariats.\n\nGermany manages its colonial holdings, and administrates relations with its few independent allies, via the Einheitspakt. This faction is a post-war alliance made in the 1950s, led by Germany.\n\nHistory\n\nPre-WWII Germany (1920-1939)\n\nGermany emerged from World War One a defeated and broken nation, her army beaten on the field, her allies collapsing under the strain of four years of unrelenting war, and the Treaty of Versailles humilating the nation. In the economic and political chaos that followed the war, political polarization ensued. Germany losing her imperial markets and industrial base in the Ruhr valley resulted in an economic crisis, and the people looked to different ideologies to compensate for their losses. One of them was the KPD, which was gaining rapid popularity over the years and was causing great distress towards the ruling capitalist party of the Weimar Republic, the country that emerged after Germany's devastation in the first world war. The ruling capitalist party began politically and monetarily supporting the far-right National Socialist German Workers' Party led by the charismatic Adolf Hitler, which was staunchly anti-communist and gained massive popularity over the late 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nThe NSDAP soon gained members such as Martin Bormann, Albert Speer, Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Göring, Heinrich Himmler, and many others, including (shockingly) members of the capitalist ruling party in the former Weimar Republic. The Nazi Party gained more and more popularity until the failure of the attempted Beer Hall Putsch. The party soon surged afterwards and with the start of the Great Depression, the NSDAP's ideals of a return to glory and revenge were more popular than ever. In 1933, President Paul Von Hindenburg chose Adolf Hitler to become chancellor.\n\nFollowing Hindenburg's death, the NSDAP assumed full control of Germany. The NSDAP transformed Germany into a one-party totalitarian regime and persecuted Communists, Socialists, Jews, and other \"undesirables\". In 1936, Germany made it's first move towards expansion when it re-militarized the Rhineland. The French and British failed to stop them. In 1938, the Federal State of Austria was peacefully annexed following a pro-Nazi coup.\n\nDuring the \"Sudetenkrise\", the NSDAP used pan-German sentiments to spark conflict with the First Czechoslovak Republic. The primary goal was the unification of ethnic Germans living in Czechoslovakia with those living in the German Reich (at the time, ethnic Germans made up 90% of the Sudetenland and 20% of the whole Czechoslovak state). To settle the matter, the Munich Conference was held and Czechoslovakia was forced to give up the Sudetenland to Germany. The next year brought about the annexation of the rest of Czechoslovakia (which the Allies could only protest). It was at this point, Britain and France declared their support of Poland in case of a German invasion.\n\nGermany demanded to annex the historically disputed Danzig Corridor, that separated East Prussia from the German mainland. Upon Poland's refusal, an invasion occurred, in which, both Germany and the USSR invaded Poland. To ensure Polish sovereignty, England and France declared war on Germany, sparking World War II.\n\nThe Second World War (1939-1945)\n\nGermany quickly overran the Polish and turned north. Denmark and Norway were easily defeated in 1940, and the German army turned west, invading Belgium and the Netherlands. German forces successfully surrounded and destroyed the British Army at Dunkirk and forced the French to surrender.\n\nAfter the fall of France, Italy joined the war, and the British fleet was trapped in the Mediterranean, when German Paratroopers seized Gibraltar and the Italians overran Egypt, capturing the Suez and cutting off the British supply lines to Africa.\n\nThe next year German forces launched Operation Barbarossa and invaded the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The disorganized and demoralized Red Army was easily destroyed and the nation collapsed, with Germany taking all the land up to the Urals and dividing it into several Reichskommisariats: Ostland, Ukraine, Moskowien, and Kaukasus.\n\nAround this time, the Empire of Japan attacked the Americans in Pearl Harbour, bringing the US into the war. Within a year England had been conquered, and Europe was completely under Nazi Domination. In 1944, a German plane launched from a Japanese carrier conducted a nuclear strike on Pearl Harbor, the first of its kind in history. The Americans soon signed an armistice and the war ended.\n\nThe post-war era (1946-1962)\n\nWith the war over, Germany enacted several of its ambitious plans for Europe. One of these projects was the rebuilding of Berlin into Germania, which was successful, albiet at a tremendous cost.\n\nIt was around 1950, when the German economy collapsed in on itself in a spectacular fashion. The German economy took the rest of Europe with it and led to the 1950s being a decade of chaos. Different factions within the Reich came up with different ways to solve the crisis.\n\nSpeer and his reformists wanted to reform the Reich and liberalize. Himmler and the SS believed the opposite, in that National Socialism hadn't gone far enough. They created their own ideology, following an extreme form of Nazism. Goring and his militarists recognized that the root cause was that the economy was fueled by conquest, and that the Reich just needed to start conquering again to fix the economy. Bormann's conservatives stated that some reforms were needed.\n\nTensions built up until an attempted SS coup, which utterly failed and led to the SS being split into two; a German branch, and the establishment of the SS State of Burgundy, a personal fiefdom for Himmler to keep him away from German affairs, and ruled by the other branch, the Burgundian SS.\n\nJust as order was seemingly restored, Hungary's government collapsed and Germany struck a deal with the Romanians and Slovakians to allow them to invade Hungary in exchange for economic assistance. After the Transylvanian conflict, another flared up in RK Moskowien. A united front of partisan forces attacked the Germans and forced them to abandon the Arkhangelsk–Astrakhan (A-A) line. The war was long and brutal, but the Germans eventually defeated the partisans at great cost, largely in part to General Hans Speidel.\n\nAfter the war, which would be known as the West Russian War, the economy finally stabilized when those who were considered degenerates were used for slave labor instead of extermination. The entire German economy soon became based on slavery. As the slave dependency grew, so did the risk of revolt, a fear that many Germans had.\n\nAs the economy recovered, the military stagnated and the young people, with no need to work due to slaves, became interested in black market American music, Italian cinema, and forbidden literature. This led to the rise of a new generation of students discontented with the Reich's policies and government.\n\nThe status of Germany in 1962\n\nAs 1962 begins, Germany soon announced the first good news for the nation, seemingly in decades. Its space race with the United States and Japan, at least according to German authorities, had come to an end. German Raumsonauts have landed on the moon. Despite this, Japan and the United States both have claimed the space race is not yet over, and have pushed the boundaries, claiming they will achieve things such as the first space station, Lunar colony, and satellite around Mars.\n\nAs the celebrations at this victory began in Germania, however, and Germany seemed to face a brief lull in its woes, an assassin struck at Hitler. While the Führer has survived, it seems that the Reich may be facing its greatest challenge yet.\n\nGerman Civil War\n\nSoon after the assassination attempt on Hitler, he names a successor for when he dies. The successor can be: Albert Speer; a reformist, Martin Bormann; a conservative, Hermann Goring; a militarist or Reinhard Heydrich; head of the German SS. Each of these men are personally close to Hitler whether it's Speer as the Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production in addition to his role as the architect behind Germania, Bormann as the Reich Parteiminister, Goring as Reichsmarschall, or Heydrich's role in the SS. The next year, Hitler dies and despite Hitler's clear designation of a successor, the country descends into civil war.\n\nPolitics\n\nOverview\n\nThe German Reich operates under a National Socialist dictatorship, led by the Führer Adolf Hitler. As of 1962, the German Reich is considered the most powerful country in Europe, and possibly the world, achieving total dominance over the majority of Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWhen the German economy collapsed in 1950, different factions formed with different ways to solve it. Speer and his reformists wanted to reform the Reich and liberalize. Himmler and the SS believed the opposite: National Socialism hadn't gone far enough, and so they created their own ideology, following an esoteric form of Nazism. Goring and his militarists recognized that the root cause was that the economy was fueled by conquest, and that the Reich just needed to start conquering again to fix the economy. Bormann's conservatives stated that some reforms were needed.\n\nTensions were built up until an attempted coup by the SS and Hitler directly ordered the SS to be split into the German and Burgundian sections, with the latter being given their own state carved out of northeastern France and Belgium in order to keep them busy.\n\nWhen an assassin struck at Hitler. He survived, but it seems like the Reich may be facing its greatest challenge yet. In 1962, it is clear to most that his days are numbered, and once he dies the competition between factions in the NSDAP could possibly tear the Reich he spent his life creating apart.\n\nForeign relations\n\nThe Greater Germanic Reich leads the Einheitspakt, which is a military and economic alliance that consists of the Greater Germanic Reich's puppets, clients and allies. Its key objective is to maintain Germany's sphere of influence, while also preventing rival factions from expanding such as the Organization of Free Nations and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\n\nThe Germans have tense relations with the United States after the war ended due to the latter supporting separatist movements within the Unity Pakt in an attempt to diminish Germany’s global power projection.\n\nGermany and Italy used to be allies with each other until 1950 when it left and formed the Triumvirate, alongside the Iberian Union and Turkey, after the war due to souring relations between the two.\n\nJapan, already at odds with Germany, restarted trade relationships with Italy, especially oil trade, and even the USA opened diplomatic and trade channels with the Triumvirate, whom they considered a force of moderation, in an increasingly dangerous Europe. Also, by separating the German and Italian economies, Italy managed to narrowly avoid being hit by the German economy's crash in the 1950s.\n\nGerman and Japan used to be allied with each other, until after the war ended in 1945. The two countries shortly became rivals afterwards.\n\nNational spirits\n\nSpeer's spirits\n\nThese are the spirits which Germany receives just after Albert Speer wins the civil war.\n\nThe Lost Generation\n\nDaily Political Power Gain: +0.15\n\nStability: -10.00%\n\nConstruction Speed: -10.00%\n\nProduction Efficiency Cap: -10.00%\n\nThe German youth has gone two decades with no future prospects beyond miraculously being accepted into a coveted course in the academia, reluctantly joining the Wehrmacht or agreeing to be shipped off to a miserable colony in the east. With neither hope for themselves nor use for the Reich as a whole, they have become a particularly volatile part of society.\n\nWary Wehrmacht\n\nDivision Recovery Rate: -10.0%\n\nMax Planning: -10.0%\n\nDespite the pretenders Bormann and Göring being soundly defeated in the Bürgerkrieg, the Wehrmacht still largely distrusts our ability to lead Germany properly. In addition to this, troublesome elements such as Generalfeldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner continue to spread anti-Speerite sentiment through our officer corps. If not dealt with soon, our regime could be challenged by a rebellious Wehrmacht.\n\nGang of Four[1]\n\nStability: +10.00%\n\nThe Führer is the face of the state, yet in the halls of Germania, his clique works towards a brand new future for the Reich - Kiesinger, Schmidt, Erhard, and von Tresckow.
