Nazi Germany arose after Germany's defeat in World War 1 and the humiliating Treaty of Versailles. Adolf Hitler rose to power as Chancellor in 1933 on a nationalist platform promising to restore Germany's power and pride. Once in power, Hitler quickly consolidated control and established a totalitarian dictatorship, abolishing democracy and making the Nazi party the sole legal party by July 1933. Millions of Jews and other minorities would later be persecuted and murdered under the Nazi regime.",
