At\n\nthe same time, as both occupying force and Axis partner, the Nazis were establishing governments that would cooperate with them. In many of these countries, war\n\ncrimes and genocidal policies against various minorities within the country were\n\nintentional, most often in the course of their own territorial pursuits. Against the\n\nbackground of the war, European countries and societies reacted with a mixture\n\nof passivity, fatalism, collaboration but also resistance. Yet what did this situation\n\nmean for public life, the prospects of the particular country and for the existentially endangered groups and individuals? Which forces actively collaborated with the occupiers and tried to turn this to their own advantage?\n\nCollaboration, also referred to as collaborationism in professional circles, is\n\ntoday considered to be one of the most problematic aspects of the history of occupation in World War II as well as of the Holocaust. In this context, the starting\n\npoints, motivations, behaviors, reactions and actions taken by political systems,\n\ninstitutions, groups and individuals varied widely and depended on diverse factors and the dynamics of events determined by the war and filled with violence.\n\nViewing the different forms all over Europe of collaboration with Nazi Germany is less complicated due to the fact that only instances of resistance â real\n\nor imagined â against the former dominance of Germany are subject to debate.\n\nThis generally politicized narrative was cultivated especially in the post-war period to strengthen the sense of community and national identity in the Eastern\n\nBloc countries, but also in France and Italy. At least in some European countries, a more revisionist presentation of the phenomenon of collaboration and\n\nthe significance it had in World War II has come to prevail. Narratives about the\n\ncountryâs own victims and losses compete with memories of those minorities\n\nand objects of hate, including Jews, Sinti and Roma, who were left completely\n\ndefenseless and at the mercy of the German occupying forces, their allies and\n\ncollaborators.\n\nIn May 2019 in Rome, the conference âCollaborationism with Nazi Germany.\n\nA European Controversyâ, organized by the Moses Mendelssohn Center for European-Jewish Studies in Potsdam and the La Sapienza University in Rome, was\n\ndedicated to this topic, analytically comprehensive yet regionally specific. It\n\nbrought researchers and academics from many different countries together,\n\nwho from their different perspectives reflected on the similarities and differences\n\nin European collaboration with Nazi Germany. Some of the contributions published in this volume are based on lectures given at this conference. Additional\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1515/9783110671186-202\n\nP:07\n\ncontributions and country analyses have been added to provide a more precise\n\nview of this phenomenon and to round off the volume.\n\nThe present volume does not claim to be complete. This book cannot and\n\ndoes not intend to be. What is presented here is an attempt at taking stock to describe and evaluate the behavior of some countries in World War II. Moreover,\n\nthis book seeks to stimulate further studies and academic and social discussions\n\nabout collaboration, particularly in those countries where the countryâs collaboration with the Nazis is ignored, unmentioned or taboo.\n\nResearch, Terminology and Theoretical Approaches\n\nSince the 1970s, people have begun to consider collaboration a subject for research, especially in Western Europe.1 Meanwhile, this wide-ranging topic â\n\nwhich still includes some âblind spotsâ â has become an established field of\n\nresearch.2 There are now a large number of works with country-specific studies on collaboration,3 which deal in particular with the trans-national participation in the organized mass murder of European Jews.4 Some of these works\n\nare dedicated to the cooperation of the military with the German Wehrmacht\n\non its campaigns of conquest;5 others examine economic relations with Nazi\n\n1 For more on this see: Werner RÃ¶hr, ed., Europa unterm Hakenkreuz.

The German three-part tv movie âUnsere MÃ¼tter,\n\nunsere VÃ¤terâ (2013) from the director Philipp Kadelbach deals with anti-Semitism in the Polish\n\nresistance movement and among collaborating Poles, which caused controversial headlines not\n\nForeword by the Editors VII\n\nP:09\n\ncollaboration to a wide audience. All of this makes it clear that collaboration and\n\nresistance are topics that play an increasing role in the discourses of memory.14\n\nDespite the interdisciplinary research and medial reflections that are already available, no satisfactory uniform definition of the phenomenon of âcollaborationâ exists, primarily due to the complexity and variability of the term.\n\nCo-working, cooperation, collusion, complicity, betrayal â historiography has\n\nused various terms to make the topic of collaboration both tangible and understandable. It is, however, clear that these terms are insufficient, some of them\n\neven problematic. This is especially true for the alternative use of the word âcooperationâ, a word which implicitly suggests working together with the occupiers as equals.15\n\nThe interpretation of the term is further complicated by the fact that the historical perception and interpretation of collaboration varies widely: Resistance\n\nfighters and political opponents of the Nazi regime considered all forms of working together with the German occupying forces, even if it was the result of the\n\nunequal power structure, as treason. From the politician to the businessman, the\n\nworker to the simple domestic servant, the anti-Fascist resistance considered all\n\nthose who worked for the Germans to be their supporters and thus traitors. The\n\nSoviets even considered forced laborers, who were forced to work under inhumane conditions in Nazi Germany, to be collaborators. After their liberation and\n\nreturn home, they were often killed or imprisoned. In this light, what we understand by âcollaborationâ is an extremely elastic and often morally charged term.\n\nIn fact, a broader definition of âcollaborationâ includes a wide range of coworking between politicians, the military, representatives of business, culture\n\nand other professions. The term leaves the exact motive â coercion, persuasion,\n\nadaption or pragmatism â just as undefined as Germanyâs various forms of political domination in the occupied or allied countries. Despite this and other\n\nconcerns, the word âcollaborationâ has become established as a catch-all for\n\nthe various forms of the asymmetrical cooperation with the Nazis â even during\n\nonly in Poland.

There are no alternative suggestions of what to call this phenomenon or are rarely if ever considered.16\n\nIn the present volume, we define collaboration as a part of the history of\n\nWorld War II, the history of occupation and everyday life and as an essential\n\ninfluencing factor in the Holocaust. Collaboration is understood to be a reaction\n\nto offerings and (forced) demands made by the Nazis that legitimized, accompanied, exercised, supported and/or made the Nazi policies possible. However,\n\nthe term, understood as a catch-all term, cannot provide a clear separation of\n\nthe conditions and circumstances under which this happened.17 In the academic\n\ndebate on this topic, which should be interdisciplinary and conducted from an\n\ninternational perspective, the analysis of spheres of influence and room for\n\nmaneuver of the respective governments, institutions and people is of primary\n\nimportance.\n\nDimensions of Collaboration\n\nCollaboration took place in every country in Europe which was occupied by or\n\nallied with Nazi Germany or which were neutral. Its variety of forms and expressions encompassed all social groups, political parties and organizations,\n\neconomic and cultural sectors, the church and the military along with the authorities and the police. However, an examination of this spectrum must take\n\ninto account the various methods of Nazi rule, such as military and civil administration. The Nazis were the ones who dictated how the political collaboration would proceed with each country.\n\nAlthough the Germans pursued an ideologically based and economically\n\nmotivated policy throughout Europe, unlike in Western Europe, the ânew mastersâ exercised a more aggressive use of power of âdomination, administration\n\nand exploitationâ in the East. Three of their main goals of occupation were the\n\nterritorial expansion of Lebensraum, the exploitation of the respective countryâs\n\nhuman and material resources and the annihilation of undesirable populations:\n\nthe Slavic so-called âsubhumansâ, the Jews, Roma, homosexuals, the sick, Free\n\nMasons and the politically unreliable.18\n\n16 Cf.

Wolfgang Benz, Johannes Houwink ten Cate and Gerhard Otto (Berlin: Metropol Verlag,\n\n1996), 257â302, here 271 f.\n\nForeword by the Editors IX\n\nP:11\n\nAll key positions in public life were placed under German control, so that\n\nself-administration by locals was only possible at the lowest levels, as Stephan\n\nLehnstaedt and Joachim Tauber illustrate in the present volume in the countries\n\nof Poland and Lithuania. The persecution policy carried out by the German occupiers in Eastern Europe included the use of mass terror. Resistance in particular\n\nwas met with retaliation and harsh sanctions against the civilian population. For\n\nexample, in the Czech town of Lidice after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the director of the Reich Main Security Office and Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, or in the Serbian towns of Kragujevac and Kraljevo, where\n\nmore than 4,000 civilians were killed by the Wehrmacht in October 1941.19\n\nIn contrast to the rigid policy of exploitation and violence seen in Eastern\n\nEurope, the German occupying forces were more âmoderateâ in Western Europe.\n\nUnlike in the East, in the Netherlands or in Scandinavia, for example, a national\n\nadministration was re-established under German control. The population in Norway, for example, experienced better treatment overall by the Nazi occupying\n\nforces, as the local population was considered to be âraciallyâ more valuable\n\nthan the Slavs. In addition, the occupying force profited from the existence of\n\nand committed cooperation from Nazi or Fascist political groups, parties or sympathizers which existed in every country and who seized this opportunity to establish themselves in power politics.20\n\nNevertheless, the willingness to cooperate with the Germans depended on\n\nvarious factors, such as how the new rulers treated the civilian population and\n\nwhat the local pre-existing historical enemy stereotypes were, determined by previous wars (with the exceptions of Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands). Other\n\ninfluencing factors included the moment of surprise at the unexpected German\n\ninvasion and the subsequent defeat of the respective country, as it was, for instance in Poland and Yugoslavia, but also in the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway.21 In countries like Slovakia, collaboration was seen as a guarantee for the\n\ncreation and continued existence of their own state under German influence.\n\nIn addition, some countries profited from their own territorial ambitions being\n\n19 Cf.

Countries which collaborated politically also had\n\nenough room to maneuver to avoid German demands regarding the deportation\n\nof the Jews and other areas of collaboration, particularly when their own national\n\ninterests were at stake.\n\nThe behavior of each local population should be seen in relation to the actions\n\nof their governments. The line between voluntary and forced collaboration was\n\noften very thin. Some people became involved out of necessity, they collaborated\n\nfor fear of deportation and reprisals; others did so for the opportunities for personal advancement, an improvement in living conditions, pragmatism, corruption,\n\npersonal gain or ideological conviction. Alternatively, they remained passive,\n\nwent about their daily lives as usual and thus supported the criminal activities\n\nin their country with their indifference. It can be assumed that without the aid\n\nand abettance of the local authorities and the conformist behavior of the local\n\npopulation, the German occupying machinery could not have functioned as it\n\nultimately did.\n\nThe most tragic effects of collaboration were seen in the persecution and\n\nmurder of six million Jews and those classified as Jews. Anti-Semitism in all its\n\nmanifestations was prevalent all throughout Europe; it was present in all social\n\nclasses and now underwent a political and criminal radicalization. Collaboration with the Germans fell on ears already fertile with anti-Semitism, which, in\n\nsome countries had already been enshrined into law before the German occupation, like in Hungary (in 1920) and in Yugoslavia (in 1940). In allied and cooperative countries, discussions about the execution of the persecution measures\n\ndealt only with formalities and the division of tasks to complete the deportation.\n\nThere were, however, also regimes, such as the Croatian UstaÅ¡a, which also\n\nacted autonomously in the extermination of Jews. They did not require instructions; they acted on their own initiative accordingly.\n\nAbout this Book and its Topics\n\nMost of the contributions in this volume range between country-specific overviews and micro-historical studies. The present volume will try to show facets of\n\nthe complexity of the history of collaboration from different perspectives. These\n\nfacets range between decisions of state and reactions to Nazi proposals, national\n\nand economic interests, country-specific aspirations of hegemony, pragmatic decisions and Nazi pressure.\n\nThe local cooperation and assistance with Nazi Germany in the handing and\n\nimplementation of the Holocaust takes a central place in this book, especially\n\nsince the âexterminationâ of the entire Jewish population was an expressly stated\n\nForeword by the Editors XI\n\nP:13\n\ngoal of the Nazis. In order to carry this out, special Judenberater (Jewish advisors)\n\nwere made available to some countries. Anti-Jewish laws formed the basis for discrimination and deportation. In addition, military units and local police forces\n\nwere set up to implement the deportation and annihilation of the Jews. Moreover,\n\nthere was an enormous level of participation from governments, political players\n\nand ânormalâ people in the process of exterminating the Jews and in receiving\n\nexpropriated Jewish property, motivated by anti-Semitism and other factors. The\n\nclarification of this European readiness to contribute to the Holocaust, which\n\nplayed into the Germansâ hands, has in retrospect led to the demythification of\n\nthe still widespread perception of German sole responsibility and/or guilt.\n\nThe fact that this guilt does not correspond to the historical overview of collaboration is already made clear in the first chapter of the present volume âWestern Countries between Collaboration, Neutrality and Resistanceâ, in which Lars\n\nDencik describes and analyzes the various forms of collaboration in the Scandinavian countries. Valentina Sommella concentrates on the political-military\n\ncollaboration of the Vichy regime and the French involvement in the persecution of the Jews, highlighting the interaction between Generals PÃ©tain and de\n\nGaulle, who divided the country into those who collaborated and those who\n\ntook up armed resistance against the German occupying forces.\n\nIn the second chapter âAspects of Collaboration in Central Europe: The Cases\n\nof Poland and Hungaryâ, in his country study of occupied Poland, Stephan Lehnstaedt focuses on the political and administrative collaboration along with the\n\n(military) cooperation of ethnic Germans, while Alessandro Vagnini illustrates\n\nGerman-Hungarian relations primarily on the basis of the anti-Semitism already pervasive and enshrined by law in Hungary before the German invasion\n\nin March 1944.\n\nIn the chapter âCountries of Eastern Europe: Political Interests, Anti-Semitism\n\nand Military Supportâ, Olaf GlÃ¶cknerâs overview of the situation reveals some\n\nfacets of Ukrainian collaboration in the military involvement in the war against\n\nthe Soviet army and the murder of the Jews through mass violence. Giuseppe\n\nMotta focuses on political, economic and ideological anti-Semitic collaboration\n\nin the case of Romania. In his country analysis of Lithuania, Joachim Tauber concentrates particularly on the political-administrative level, taking into account\n\nthe ghettos in Vilnius, Kaunas and Å iauliai run by local authorities and their participation in the Holocaust.\n\nIn the chapter âCollaboration in Slavic and Balkan Countriesâ, Martina Bitunjac illustrates the persecution and murder of the Jews in the Slovak State\n\nand the Independent State of Croatia, both of which cooperated with Nazi Germany. BjÃ¶rn Opfer-Klinger analyzes different political aspects (i.e. diplomacy,\n\nthe economy) of the Bulgarian collaboration with the Third Reich, both before\n\nXII Foreword by the Editors\n\nP:14\n\nand during the war, while Meinolf Arens and Katerina Kakasheva deal with two\n\nspecial regions of the Balkans, occupied Vardar Macedonia and West Banat â\n\nscenes of German, Bulgarian and local terror with particularly aggressive persecution of the Jews and mass violence.\n\nThe following chapter âSouth European Case Studies: Greece, Italy and Portugalâ begins with Ioannis Zeleposâ examination of Greek military formations,\n\nthe security battalions, within the framework of German occupation politics. In\n\nher micro-historical study, Ester Capuzzo illuminates the effects of the Italian\n\nâracial lawsâ on the Jewish community in Fiume (Rijeka) on the territory of\n\nwhat is now Croatia, which fought to survive the at times collaborating, at times\n\ncompeting Italian, German and Croatian forces. Fernando Clara demonstrates\n\nthat collaboration also encompassed the cultural sphere in neutral European\n\ncountries, using the example of the various ways the Portuguese Secretariat of\n\nNational Propaganda in the Estado Novo had room to maneuver.\n\nIn the final chapter âReflections on Jewish âCooperationâ with the Nazis in\n\nWestern and Eastern Europeâ, Julius H. Schoeps devotes himself to the forced\n\ncooperation of the JudenrÃ¤ten (Jewish Councils) and individual Jewish informers, the so-called Greifer, who were fighting to survive and after World War II\n\nfound themselves confronted with accusations of having betrayed their fellow\n\nJews, thereby making themselves culpable.\n\nThe present volume is thus intended as a contribution to the still current and\n\nin many countries emotionally charged debate about the motivations, forms and\n\npossible leeway in collaboration with the Nazis. This is particularly true in the\n\nchapters dealing with how collaboration was treated in Germany, France and\n\nthe countries of the former Yugoslavia, in Ukraine and Hungary in the context\n\nof today, illustrating the associated problems of a differentiated historical treatment and an adequate memory culture.\n\nNew forms of right-wing populism, nationalism and growing intolerance\n\nof Jewish fellow citizens and minorities have made such historically sensitive\n\nstudies considerably more difficult in many countries today. Instead, Fascist\n\nholidays are being celebrated and war criminals are enjoying growing popularity in some places. Contradictory memories of Nazism, Fascism, occupation\n\nand the Holocaust collide. The discussion about what was then right and wrong,\n\nabout victims and perpetrators is at times emotionally charged and, particularly\n\nin post-Communist Eastern Europe, accompanied by a political polarization.\n\nAgainst this background, a further goal was to shed light the current political\n\nand social perceptions of collaboration and collusion, which had been taboo in\n\nmany countries after the war. KrisztiÃ¡n UngvÃ¡ry criticizes and analyzes the myth\n\nof only the Germans being responsible for the crimes of World War II and the Holocaust, which has recently been cultivated even by official German foreign policy.\n\nForeword by the Editors XIII\n\nP:15\n\nSerge Klarsfeld distances himself from mythologizing publications about World\n\nWar II in France and â from the perspective of a Holocaust survivor â makes Vichy\n\nFranceâs complicity in the Holocaust clear. Trvtko Jakovina examines the distorted\n\nhistoriography in the countries of the former Yugoslavia, particularly in Croatia\n\nand Serbia, where collaboration is still partially a taboo and unmentionable. Franz\n\nSz. HorvÃ¡th and Imre SzakÃ¡l critically examine the partially revisionary memory politics in Hungary and Ukraine, respectively.\n\nFor making the conference at the La Sapienza University possible, we would\n\nlike to thank our friends and colleagues in Rome: Giovanna Motta, Antonello\n\nF.

According to the Yad Vashem Archives, this shows Lipe Baum, owner\n\nof a large farm. Amused and laughing, these members of the paramilitary defense\n\norganization of the Slovak government posed for several pictures with their deliberately chosen Jewish victims. The main focus of the photos is not, however, the\n\nfive perpetrators as intended, but rather the Jewish man who is looking directly\n\nat the camera. Lipe Baum had to suffer the violence, but they could not take\n\naway his dignity. The photo was taken shortly before the Jewish man, his family and the Jewish residents of his town were deported. He was later murdered\n\nin the German extermination camp SobibÃ³r.22\n\n22 Cf. the information about Lipe (Leib) Baum in the Central Database of Shoah Victimâs\n\nNames in the Yad Vashem Archives, Jerusalem, accessed August 18, 2020, https://yvng.yadva\n\nshem.org/index.html?language=en&s_lastName=Baum&s_firstName=Lipe&s_place=&s_da\n\nteOfBirth=&cluster=true.\n\nXIV Foreword by the Editors\n\nP:16\n\nPublic humiliation, dehumanization, intimidation and the public display\n\nof Jews were seen on the streets every day in the 1930s and 1940s â whether in\n\nGermany, Austria, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine or Lithuania. The discrimination\n\nranged from the humiliating cleaning of sidewalks, Jews being made to hang a\n\nsign with anti-Semitic content around their necks, the removal and burning of\n\nsidelocks and beards of Orthodox Jews to the public undressing of Jewish men\n\nand women and brutal lynchings on public squares (particularly in Eastern Europe). The victims were defenseless, completely at the mercy of the initiators of\n\nthe violence, the spectators and onlookers. The photographic recording of these\n\ncruelties represented an additional violation; it was part of the crime and was to\n\nserve the perpetrators as proof of a successful demonstration of power over the\n\nexterminated Jewish population.\n\nToday these photos are not only historical testimonies of European antiSemitism and the Holocaust, which â as this book shows â was greatly facilitated by the close collaboration between Nazi Germany and other European\n\ncountries. They also serve as a timeless wake-up call and admonition against\n\nanti-Semitism, Holocaust relativism, hate and racism â phenomena that no society, then or now, was or is immune to.\n\nMartina Bitunjac and Julius H.

In certain paragraphs the position of the fifth Nordic country, Iceland â at the time\n\npart of the Kingdom of Denmark â to Nazi Germany, will also be considered. I\n\nwill sketch out the relationships between the Nordic state authorities and Nazi\n\nGermany as well as between civilian organizations in these countries and the\n\nNazi German cause. My main focus will then be on what rationales the respective country acted vis-Ã -vis Nazi Germany. What were their rationales with respect\n\nto collaboration with Nazi Germany?\n\nA special focus will also be on how policies and actions of and in these five\n\nNordic countries affected their Jewish inhabitants, in particular to what extent\n\nthese policies and actions directly or indirectly contributed to the Holocaust.\n\nTwo underlying questions that will be more directly addressed by way of conclusion are: under what conditions is resistance to the âdevilâ warranted and\n\nnot just heroic? Under what conditions may collaborationism be a fruitful option and not per se condemnable? It should be said in the outset that this article\n\nwill not present all the variations of resistance to, and collaboration with, Nazi\n\nGermany that took place in the countries I deal with. In all of these countries\n\ndifferent kinds of opposition and resistance to the ambitions and presence of\n\nNazi Germany took place, and in all of them various forms of cooperation with\n\nNazi Germany also took place. Readers who seek insights into the complexities\n\nof how each of the countries more specifically related to Nazi Germany during\n\nWorld War II are referred to the many very careful and detailed empirical research studies there are in each of the countries on both their respective resistance movements and collaborationism.1\n\n1 See e. g. Richard Petrow, The Bitter Years: The Invasion and Occupation of Denmark and\n\nNorway, April 1940âMay 1945 (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1975); Robert Bohn, Reichskommissariat Norwegen: âNationalsozialistische Neuordnungâ und Kriegswirtschaft (Munich:\n\nOldenbourg, 2009); Geir Thorsdahl, Quislings biskoper: en norsk kirke i nazismens tjeneste\n\n(Oslo: Kagge Forlag, 2017); Marte Michelet, Den stÃ¸rste forbrytelsen.

Many elements of resistance and collaborationism that â from other\n\nperspectives than adopted for the purpose of this article â might be quite salient\n\nin the history of the respective nation will not be reported in this article.\n\nCollaborationism: Offensive and Defensive\n\nCooperation\n\nCollaborationism refers to cooperation with the enemy against your own country in wartime. Usually it is regarded high treason. âTraitorous cooperation with\n\nthe enemyâ is a term often used with reference to the French Vichy Government,\n\nwhich cooperated closely with the Nazis from 1940â1944. Stanley Hoffman in\n\nhis classic work on collaborationism in France (1968)2 subdivided collaboration\n\ninto involuntary, meaning reluctant recognition of the necessity to cooperate, and\n\nvoluntary. Another distinction can be made between forced and ideological collaborationism. Both of these comprise deliberate services to an enemy. Whereas\n\nthe first kind is service to an enemy based on perceived necessity for survival\n\nor avoidance of suffering, the second kind, ideological collaborationism, is advocacy for cooperation with an enemy power because this is seen as a champion\n\nof some desirable domestic transformations.\n\nThe terms âcollaborationismâ and âcollaborationâ in the present essay will\n\nbe used without any immediate implications of treason. The terms will be used\n\npurely descriptively to denote the cooperation of state authorities and of certain\n\ncivilians in the Nordic countries with Nazi Germany during World War II.\n\nWhen it comes to fighting against an enemy, heroic resistance is mostly what\n\nis celebrated. Less attention, at least post hoc, is given to the costs in terms of lost\n\nlives through such resistance.

Passivity might be an alternative to resistance. However, passivity\n\nis often deemed as cowardice and lack of civil courage. A particular kind of passivity is to be a bystander. By implication this, in particular post hoc, is deemed\n\nas passive support to the aggressor.\n\nAnother alternative to resistance might be collaboration with the enemy. In\n\nmost cases, in particular post hoc, those who cooperate are condemned as traitors. Collaboration with the enemy may, however, have different reasons and\n\njustifications. There is a need to distinguish between two fundamentally quite\n\ndifferent kinds of collaboration.\n\nOne is collaboration because of sympathy for and active willingness to support the enemy. This could be, e. g. a local Nazi group endorsing and doing\n\nservices such as giving information about your fellow citizens to the German occupiers. This is referred to as offensive cooperation with the enemy. Such cooperation may be carried out both by state authorities and civilian organizations\n\nand individuals.\n\nAnother kind of collaboration might be caused by concerns to save groups\n\nand individuals from reasonably expectable harm that might otherwise follow,\n\nf. e. a national government deciding to accept demands by a foreign force in\n\norder to avoid the realizations of threats that might cause severe harm to its population. This is referred to as defensive cooperation with the enemy. Such cooperation may be carried out by state administrations as well as civilian groups and\n\nindividuals.\n\nAnalytically it may be quite clear what this distinction between offensive\n\nand defensive cooperation with your enemy implies. In practice, however, for\n\ninstance when it post hoc comes to judge to what extent a certain act of cooperation with the enemy was actually in its effect an offensive or defensive act of\n\ncooperation may not be easy to sort out. Actions taken in a crisis situation tend\n\nto be double-edged and end up with ambiguous consequences.\n\nAs is well known, the road to hell is sometimes paved with the best intentions. Hence, a further distinction is needed. Any act, including acts of cooperation, may be driven by either an ambition to support the party cooperated with,\n\nor, on the contrary, by an ambition to reduce the harm this party might afflict.\n\nFrom this perspective, it is the intention of the actor that decides whether their\n\nact of cooperation is offensive or defensive. However, from the perspective of\n\nhistory, it is rather the effects of the cooperative acts that counts. Did they in\n\nfact contribute to support the enemy or not? Did they actually help in reducing\n\nthe harm to their own interests, or more concretely, help in saving the lives of\n\nmembers of their own group?\n\nConsiderate Collaborationism: If You Canât Beat Them, Join Them 7\n\nP:29\n\nIf offensive cooperation is generally based on intentions to support the enemy,\n\ndefensive cooperation is to be judged on the effects the actions taken. Intentions\n\nare sometimes openly declared or may be inferred from previous stands and\n\nactions by the actor. Effects, however, are to be measured in terms of net utility\n\nto the actor.\n\nA Rational Motive for Collaborationism\n\nAny occupied country as well as any suppressed population is faced with the\n\nquestion of how to deal with the enemy given the ambition is to minimize the\n\nharm, say in terms of causalities, this enemy might cause? One way of handling\n\nsuch a situation might be to cooperate with the enemy because by doing so you\n\nmay save lives. However, there is often the following complication: the very cooperation with the enemy may also cost lives, if not directly then indirectly and\n\nin the long run.\n\nIn Judaism there is a concept which is actually also a religious rule: Pikuach\n\nnefesh (to save a soul/saving a life). It denotes the principle in Jewish law that\n\nthe preservation of human life overrides virtually any other religious rule or ethical command. It is a religious duty for Jews to preserve their own lives, as well\n\nas those of others, at virtually any cost. This moral imperative, however, gives\n\nno clear guidance when confronting the following ancient but still quite valid\n\ndilemma: How to handle a situation in which you are demanded to sacrifice\n\nlives in order to save other lives?\n\nThe obvious utilitarian solution is âto choose the lesser of two evilsâ. A utilitarian calculus may seem relatively easy in principle, in real life conditions it\n\nis, however, very often overwhelmingly complicated. Often it also takes the\n\nlong-term side-effects of the choice taken into consideration. What might be a\n\nlesser evil from the short-term perspective of one particular actor, say Sweden,\n\nmight in a longer and broader perspective indirectly inflict greater evil on another actor, say the Allied forces fighting Nazi Germany.\n\nCollaboration with and resistance to an enemy like Nazi Germany can easily\n\nbe regarded from a moral standpoint. However, whether to engage in collaboration with the enemy or not may also be regarded as a question of balancing pros\n\nand cons. The same goes for engaging in resistance to an enemy. The question is\n\nthen not whether it is right or wrong to do so, but rather what can be gained,\n\nwhat will be lost? However, this is more easily said than done in actual practice.\n\nOne tricky factor is the time dimension: the long-term effects of a given action\n\n8 Lars Dencik\n\nP:30\n\nmay come to repeal what appeared as a gain or loss in the immediate or shortsighted perspective. Gains and losses in actual life situations typically also occur\n\nin several different dimensions at the same time: the political, economic, military,\n\nmoral and human. Gains in one of these dimensions may occur parallel to losses\n\nin one or more of the other, and vice versa.\n\nWe will not dwell here on how to solve these kinds of mostly extremely\n\ncomplex, and as a matter of fact often unsolvable, calculations. What in the\n\nfinal account is the right thing to do in a real-life situation of occupation and\n\nwar if taking all dimensions and several different time perspectives into serious account has to largely remain an open question. We can choose to focus\n\non many possible measures, e. g. economic, military or political gains and losses,\n\nand on anything from immediate gains and losses to the post-hoc moral judgments actions may invoke. With all this in mind, it will suffice for our purpose in\n\nthis context to take only one simple, but particularly salient dimension and measure into consideration: the number of lives your own group has lost at the end\n\nof the war.\n\nComplexities of Collaborationism and Resistance\n\nThere are situations where it is not clear whether the attitudes and relations of a\n\nparty to an enemy is to be judged as collaboration or resistance. You may well\n\ncollaborate to some degree and in some respects in order to resist or even fight\n\nthe enemy in other ways. If the aim of the enemy is, e. g. to exterminate all of\n\nyour kind, resistance may take the form of doing whatever can be done to save\n\nsome lives. Such âresistance-by-cooperationâ, however, could readily be perceived as treason by both victims and observers of these actions. When the effects\n\nare summed up post hoc, historyâs judgment might, however, turn out differently.\n\nRecent European history provides examples of such situations. One is the\n\nghetto of ÅÃ³dÅº during World War II. The chair of the ghettoâs Judenrat, Chaim\n\nRumkowski, chose to cooperate and meet the demands of the Nazi rulers in order\n\nto try to have as many as possible of the inmates escape extermination. His calculation was to lead the ghetto to be an effective and indispensable production unit\n\nfor the Nazi rulers. Still he was forced to sacrifice many of the ghettoâs inhabitants\n\nto the Nazi murder factories. He then decided to sacrifice as much as possible\n\nthose who could not be productive. He believed that by staying ahead of the Germansâ thinking, he could keep them satisfied and preserve at least some of the\n\notherwise doomed Jews.\n\nConsiderate Collaborationism: If You Canât Beat Them, Join Them 9\n\nP:31\n\nA survivor of the ÅÃ³dÅº ghetto, Arnold Mostowicz, noted in his memoir3 that\n\nRumkowski gave a percentage of his people a chance to survive two years longer than the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto who perished in the Uprising. The ÅÃ³dÅº\n\nghetto was the last ghetto in occupied Poland to be liquidated. It is estimated\n\nthat a total of 210,000 Jews passed through it. In August 1944, about 72,000\n\nJews were deported from the ÅÃ³dÅº ghetto to be killed in Auschwitz-Birkenau.\n\nRumkowski and his family joined the last transport to Auschwitz. There he was\n\nmurdered on August 28, 1944 by Jewish Sonderkommando inmates, who beat\n\nhim to death as revenge for his handling of the inmates of the ÅÃ³dÅº ghetto.4 Historyâs judgment might turn out differently, but until now, Chaim Rumkowski and\n\nother âJewish eldersâ who somehow collaborated with the Nazis are by many\n\nregarded as traitors.\n\nIn dealing with the actions and fate of Chaim Rumkowski, two conventional\n\npropositions may become questionable, namely that collaboration with the\n\nenemy is per se contemptuous and that resistance to an attacking and occupying\n\nforce is per se heroic. Of course, collaboration with the enemy may as a matter of\n\nfact very often be treacherous and thus also contemptuous â but under certain\n\nconditions it may in fact also be heroic. Likewise, resistance to an invading and\n\noccupying force is in fact very often heroic. However, if not carefully calculated\n\nstrategically, it may in effect turn out to be counter-productive and thus by consequence be treacherous to the cause of liberation and saving the lives of family, friends and compatriots.\n\nWhen studying concrete cases of collaborationism, there is the need to specify which actors are relevant to focus on, and also along which dimensions of collaboration and resistance we should look for collaboration and resistance. One\n\nnecessary distinction is between steps taken by official institutions of the country and actions carried out by actors, groups or individuals who make up the\n\ncountryâs civil society.\n\nCollaborationism and resistance can be carried out in many dimensions. It is\n\nuseful to distinguish between at least four main dimensions: military, economic,\n\npolitical and ideological collaboration/resistance. From these perspectives, I will\n\n3 Arnold Mostowicz, With a Yellow Star and a Red Cross: A Doctor in the ÅÃ³dÅº Ghetto, translated from the Polish by Henia Reinhartz. Library of Holocaust Testimonies (Elstree: Vallentine\n\nMitchell, 2005).\n\n4 Source âÅÃ³dÅº Ghetto Deportations and Statistics,â last modified November 26, 2020, https://\n\nkehilalinks.jewishgen.org/Lodz/statistics.html. When the Soviet troops arrived, only 877 surviving Jews were found hidden in the ghetto. It is estimated that in all, up to 15,000 ÅÃ³dÅº Jews\n\nmay have survived the Holocaust in different ways.\n\n10 Lars Dencik\n\nP:32\n\nin the following sketch out some of the crucial characteristics and actions taken\n\nby state authorities and certain civil society organizations towards Nazi Germany\n\nduring World War II in the four Nordic countries Denmark, Finland, Norway and\n\nSweden. My main focus will then be to try to grasp what might have been the\n\nrationales for collaborationism in each of the countries. In what respects did the\n\ncooperation take on the character of offensive cooperation and in what respect as\n\ndefensive cooperation with Nazi Germany?\n\nThe Nordic Countries in 1939 from a German\n\nPerspective\n\nObserving the Nordic countries on the map of Europe from a German 1939 strategic perspective, the two most relevant foci are probably not the Nordic countries\n\nby themselves, but the location of Great Britain and the Soviet Union respectively. Great Britain was then already defined as an enemy of Nazi Germany and,\n\nMap of the Nordic Countries.\n\nConsiderate Collaborationism: If You Canât Beat Them, Join Them 11\n\nP:33\n\nregardless of the Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact, so was in fact the\n\nSoviet Union as a Communist country populated by Slavic peoples.5\n\nGiven that in the summer of 1939 Germany already had plans for military\n\nexpansion, a key spot in the Nordic region is the relatively narrow piece of land\n\nin the north between the Atlantic from where there is open sea and access to\n\nGreat Britain one the one side, and the Soviet continent on the other. This is\n\nwhere Norway, Sweden and Finland border each other on land. Here, two areas\n\nof particularly geopolitical significance should be pointed out:\n\na) The city of Narvik at the northern Norwegian west coast. Narvik is an important port for the export of iron ore from the area of Kiruna in Sweden located about 150 km east of Narvik. Although located far up north in an\n\nArctic area, the port of Narvik is an open port year round due to the North\n\nAtlantic Drift (Gulf Stream). There is a direct rail connection called the Iron\n\nOre Line between the iron ore mines in Kiruna and Malmberget in Sweden\n\nand the port of Narvik in Norway.\n\nNarvik was one of the key targets for the German invasion of Norway\n\non April 9, 1940. The German war ambitions regarded both the port itself\n\nand the iron ore from Sweden as highly significant. Immediately after the\n\nGerman invasion, Allied forces were directed towards the German occupiers.\n\nOn May 28, 1940, the Allied forces succeeded in taking back the city. However, when Norway was forced to capitulate on June 8, Narvik again became\n\ncontrolled by German occupiers.\n\nb) Until its independence in 1918, Finland had been a region within the czarist Russian Empire for more than a century. After the Bolsheviks conquered\n\npower and established the Soviet Union, there had been constant frictions\n\naround the border area between Finland and the Soviet Union. In the wake\n\nof the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, in October 1939, the Soviet Union demanded\n\nto be permitted to locate military bases in Finland and also that Finland\n\nshould transfer certain of its areas along its border to the Soviet Union,\n\namong others the district of Karelia. However, as has been documented in\n\n5 It is true that the Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and Communist Soviet Union was agreed to on August 23, 1939.

On\n\nNovember 30, 1939, the Soviet Union launched a military attack on Finland. This so-called Winter War ended on March 13, 1940 by Finland being\n\nforced to give up significant land areas, among them Karelia. Thus, the land\n\narea of Finland was reduced and the Finnish border with the Soviet Union\n\nwas moved westwards.\n\nLooking at Denmark and Sweden through a 1939 German strategic lens, Denmark appears as a potentially important supplier of agricultural products and\n\nfood, and Sweden of timber, iron ore and industrial products to a war-waging\n\nGermany.\n\nSome Basic Data on the Nordic Countries and\n\ntheir Respective Relations to Germany in World\n\nWar II\n\nIn this brief overview, I will also include Iceland, now one of the Nordic countries, but at the time of the outbreak of the war, part of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\nDENMARK: 3,8 million inhabitants; 7,000 Jews.7\n\nInvaded by Germany on April 9, 1940.

At their invasion and\n\noccupation of Denmark, the German forces met virtually no effective resistance,\n\nneither military nor civilian. After the occupation, most of Denmarkâs trade, industrial and in particular, its significant agrarian production was directed towards\n\nGermany. The German preparations for the invasion, code name Unternehmen WeserÃ¼bung, were not unnoticed by the Danish government, but in order not to\n\nprovoke the powerful German neighbor, no countermeasures were taken by\n\nthe Danish government.\n\nThe Danish king stayed in the country and remained head of state during the\n\noccupation. The government, the parliament and the local administrations, including the police, continued to function as before.15 This changed on August 29, 1943,\n\nwhen the policy of cooperation and negotiation with the occupier broke down and\n\nthe Germans introduced military rule and a state of emergency. The breakdown of\n\nthe policy of collaboration was preceded by a growing belief in the Danish population that the war was approaching an end, which also inspired an increase in illegal strikes and sabotage actions by Danish resistance groups. Given this, Hitler\n\ndemanded the Danish government to install harsh measures to curb and control\n\nthe Danish population. The political parties forming the coalition government refused, and as a consequence, the government, parliament and king ceased to function in their roles and the Germans took over the administration of the country â\n\nassisted in this by the deputy heads of the different departments of the government. A fight broke out during which 23 Danes were killed. The majority of the\n\nDanes had an ambivalent attitude to the collaborationistic policy and to its partial\n\nbreakdown in August 1943. Except for members of the resistance groups, most\n\nDanes felt the official and ongoing collaboration policy provided them protection\n\nand a possibility to continue their relatively unharmed private lives.\n\nThrough the years of the war, approximately 20,000 Danes went to Germany\n\nto work in German factories. About 12,000 Danish citizens volunteered for German army duty. There is a legend that during the German occupation and all of\n\nWorld War II, the Danish king Christian X rode his horse through the city with a\n\nyellow Star of David on his chest. This, however, never happened. King Christian\n\nX, as well as the Danish government, discouraged Danish civilians to carry out\n\n15 Henrik Dethlefsen, âDenmark and the German Occupation: Cooperation, Negotiation, or\n\nCollaboration?,â Scandinavian Journal of History 15:3 (1990):193â206; Phil Giltner, âThe Success of Collaboration: Denmarkâs Self-Assessment of its Economic Position after Five Years of\n\nNazi Occupation,â Journal of Contemporary History 36,3 (2001): 483â506.\n\nConsiderate Collaborationism: If You Canât Beat Them, Join Them 15\n\nP:37\n\nsabotage and encouraged informing on attempts to do so by the resistance movement that emerged in the wake of the occupation.\n\nHowever, according to a secret British report from 1942, the king actually\n\nthreatened to don the star if this should have been forced upon Danish Jews. In\n\nthe kingâs private personal diary dated September 10, 1942, the following entry\n\ncan be found:\n\nWhen you look at the inhumane treatment of Jews, not only in Germany but occupied\n\ncountries as well, you start worrying that such a demand might also be put on us, but we\n\nmust clearly refuse this due to their protection under the Danish constitution. I stated that\n\nI could not meet such a demand towards Danish citizens. If such a demand is made, we\n\nwould best meet it by all wearing the Star of David.16\n\nUntil October 1, 1943, i. e. during the first three and a half years of occupation,\n\nthe Jews in Denmark were not severely harassed by the German occupiers. Danish Jews, for instance, were not forced to pin a yellow star on themselves and\n\ntheir daily lives were not disturbed significantly more than the daily lives of any\n\nother Dane in the country.\n\nDuring October 1943, almost all of the approximately 7,000 Danish Jews\n\nwere rescued to Sweden by Danish civilians; 472 Danish Jews were caught and\n\ndeported to Theresienstadt. There they received a relatively âbenevolentâ treatment compared to Jews from other countries. None were sent to be exterminated.\n\nFifty-three people, mostly old and sick, died in Theresienstadt, all of the others\n\ncame back to Denmark. When returning home to Denmark from Sweden and\n\nTheresienstadt, they for the most part found their apartments well-kept by their\n\nDanish neighbors.17\n\n16 Danish original: Naar man saa den umenneskelige Behandling, JÃ¸derne var Genstand for ikke\n\nblot i Tyskland, men ogsaa i de besatte Lande, begyndte man at vÃ¦re Ã¦ngstelig for, at Kravet\n\nogsaa en Gang blev stillet os, men det maatte vi pure afvise som fÃ¸lge af disses Retsstilling inden\n\nfor Grundloven.

The Finnish met the Soviet invasion attempt with tough\n\nresistance but still had to accept a peace agreement on March 13, 1940, implying\n\nthat they had to give up 10 percent of Finnish territory to the Soviet Union. This\n\nhad been preceded by negotiations between Finland on the one side and France\n\nand Great Britain on the other to obtain their assistance via Norway and northern\n\nSweden. However, in February 1940, the Norwegian, Swedish and Danish governments declared they would refuse French and British troops transit. Without\n\nany outside support, Finland had to accept the Soviet claims. Of relevance in this\n\ncontext is that during the fall of 1939, the Soviet Union had pressured the neighboring Baltic States Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to permit Soviet military bases\n\nto be located in their territories, and that Soviet expansionism in general had\n\nrather free reins in the wake of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. In mid-June 1940,\n\nSoviet troops occupied Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. There was an overwhelming fear that the Soviet would also occupy all of Finland.18\n\nAt the same time, Germany was secretly planning what has become known as\n\nOperation Barbarossa â the German attack on the Soviet Union. A vital part of this\n\nplan was for Germany to have access to Finnish land, especially its northern areas\n\nand some sea areas as bases for attacks on Murmansk and Leningrad, among others.\n\nOperation Barbarossa, the German surprise attack on the Soviet Union, its\n\npartner according to the Molotov-Ribbentrop accords, took place on June 22, 1941.\n\nHowever, coordination talks between the Finnish military command and Germany\n\nhad already started at the end of 1940. On December 30, the Finnish were briefed\n\nabout the secret German plans to attack the Soviet Union, shortly thereafter, they\n\nstarted building up required infrastructure and coordinate information with the\n\nWehrmacht. German troops began to arrive. After some time, the number of German soldiers in Finland amounted to 200,000.19\n\nIn February 1940, the German Reichsmarschall GÃ¶ring promised Finland they\n\nwould get back all of the land the country had lost â with interest.

When on June 22, 1941, Germany finally started Operation Barbarossa by attacking the Soviet Union also\n\nfrom Finnish territories, Adolf Hitler declared Finland to be fighting side by side\n\nwith the Germany. On June 25, Finnish troops joined the attack on the Soviet\n\nUnion and what has become known as the Finnish âContinuation Warâ began. It\n\nlasted until September 19, 1944.20\n\nOut of the tiny Jewish community in Finland, several were drafted to fight\n\non the Finnish, and by implication also German, side against the Soviet Union.\n\nApproximately 300 Finnish Jews fought in the Continuation War, eight were\n\nkilled in action. Some of the Finnish Jews who were fluent in German and/or\n\nRussian served in Finnish intelligence and as translators between German and\n\nFinnish commanders. The Finnish Jewish soldiers were granted leave on Saturdays and Jewish holidays, and the Finnish front had a field synagogue operating in the presence of Nazi troops. Three Finnish Jews were offered the German\n\nIron Cross for their wartime service. All three refused the award.\n\nDuring World War II, approximately 500 Jewish refugees from Europe arrived in\n\nFinland. About 350 moved on to other countries, including about 160 who were\n\ntransferred to neutral Sweden to save their lives on the direct orders of the commander of the Finnish Army, Marshal Carl Gustaf Mannerheim. At one occasion\n\nin November 1942, the Finnish police agreed to turn over eight Jewish refugees from\n\nAustria to Nazi Germany.21 When it was discovered that seven of these Jews were\n\nimmediately murdered, it caused strong protest from, among others, the Archbishop,\n\nthe Social Democratic Party and Lutheran ministers. Members of the government resigned in protest. No more foreign Jewish refugees were deported from Finland.\n\nAlthough SS-FÃ¼hrer Heinrich Himmler visited Finland twice to try to persuade\n\nthe authorities to hand over the Finnish Jews, he was unsuccessful. Germanyâs ambassador to Helsinki concluded in a report to Hitler that Finns would not endanger\n\ntheir citizens of Jewish origin in any situation.

Although Iceland had been granted some legal autonomy on December 1,\n\n1918, the Danish king was still Icelandâs head of state and Denmark remained responsible for its foreign affairs and defense. As Denmark was occupied by Nazi\n\nGermany on April 9, 1940, the connections with Denmark broke down and\n\nshortly thereafter on May 10, British troops and later US military settled on the\n\nisland and stayed there until the end of the war. Under the shadow of the war\n\nand Denmark being occupied by Nazi Germany, on May 20, 1944 Iceland held a\n\nreferendum whether to keep the union with the Kingdom of Denmark or to declare Iceland an independent republic. A vast majority voted in favor of the latter\n\nand on June 17, 1944, Iceland proclaimed itself a sovereign independent republic.\n\nThe Icelandic historian VilhjÃ¡lmur Ãrn VilhjÃ¡lmsson, who has focused much\n\nof his research on anti-Semitism and Iceland during World War II, concludes that\n\nâa large group of Icelanders looked to Hitlerâs Germany with interest.â22 An Icelandic Nazi party was founded in 1933. Already in 1934, the party split, and a new\n\nconstellation naming itself Flokkur ÃjoÃ°ernissinna Ì (Nationalist Party) was formed.\n\nThis party cultivated contacts with its German mother party. Its party program\n\ncalled for the total annihilation of âworld Jewryâ. However, the party never received more than 2.8 per cent support from the electorate â too little to allow the\n\nparty to enter the Icelandic parliament. During the British and American presence\n\nin Iceland, the party and all pro-German activities were forbidden, and politicians\n\nfrom other parties who had been sympathetic to the German cause adopted a low\n\nprofile. Germans residing in Iceland were transported to internment camps.23\n\nNo Icelandic collaborationism took place during World War II except for\n\ncertain pro-Nazi actions taken by some individuals. There were Icelanders who\n\nvolunteered for German war duty and some spied for the Germans. One example\n\nis BjoÌrn Sveinn BjoÌrnsson, son of the first president of the republic. BjoÌrnsson\n\nvolunteered for the Waffen-SS in Denmark. Other leading members of Flokkur\n\nÃjoÌÃ°ernissinna after the war enjoyed successful professional careers in Iceland.\n\nOne would become the National Police Commissioner in the capital ReykjavÃ­k,\n\nwhile another who had been a leading force in the Icelandic Nazi party, DavÃ­Ã°\n\nÃlafsson, became Governor of the National Bank after the war.\n\n22 VilhjÃ¡lmur Ãrn VilhjÃ¡lmsson, âIceland.

There\n\nhas never been a synagogue built.24 Still, conspiracy theories about the Rothschild family were popular also outside the purely Nazi circles. The Icelandic\n\nNazis also directed their race-hatred towards certain selected individuals such as\n\nthe politician Ãlafur Thors who served several times as Prime Minister between\n\n1942 and 1963. With his dark curly hair, Ãlafur Thorsâ appearance was interpreted\n\nby the Icelandic Nazis as a sign of Jewish descent. Incidentally, Thor Jensenâs\n\nolder half-brother was a member of Dansk AntijÃ¶disk Liga (Danish Anti-Jewish\n\nLeague).25\n\nAs Nazism grew and spread in Europe, there were Jews trying to escape by\n\nseeking a safe haven in Iceland. However, âWhen Jewish refugees sought a safe\n\nhaven in Iceland in the 1930s, most of them were rejected by authorities and\n\nlarge segments of society. Among the few who made it to Iceland, many were\n\nexpelled by the authorities.â26 Ãrn VilhjÃ¡lmsson concludes: anti-Semitism in its\n\nugliest form had made the journey to Iceland faster than the refugees.27\n\nNo Icelandic Jews were deported or directly murdered in the Holocaust. However, Icelandâs policy of denying Jewish refuges entry by consequence meant that\n\na number of these refuge seeking Jews fell victim to the Nazi German extermination of Jews.\n\nCollaboration: Norway\n\nOn April 9, 1940, German troops attacked Norway.

The Norwegian government\n\nwas unprepared and unwilling to capitulate to the ultimatum timed to coincide with the arrival\n\nof German troops and delivered by Curt BrÃ¤uer, the German representative in Oslo. The German demand that Norway accept the âprotection of the Reichâ was rebuffed by Halvdan Koht\n\nand the Norwegian government before dawn had broken on the morning of the invasion. âVi\n\nbÃ¸yer oss ikke frivillig, kampen er allerede i gangâ, replied Koht.\n\n20 Lars Dencik\n\nP:42\n\nVII of Norway, and the democratically appointed Norwegian government went\n\ninto exile in Great Britain. Part of the Norwegian population started to engage\n\nin passive and also active resistance to the Nazi rule.\n\nAn administrative council headed by the German Nazi official Josef Terboven was installed by the Germans as a regime under their influence. Vidkun\n\nQuisling, a major in the Norwegian army and former minister of defense in the\n\nNorwegian government had already the day after the German invasion proclaimed himself Prime Minister. This didnât last long, but on 25 September\n\n1940, with Hitlers support, he was made leader of the governing State Council.29 The name Quisling has become a synonym for a high-profile collaborator.\n\nQuisling encouraged Norwegians to volunteer for service in the Waffen-SS,\n\ncollaborated in the deportation of Jews and was responsible for the executions\n\nof members of the Norwegian resistance movement.30\n\nAround 45,000 Norwegians joined the Fascist party Nasjonal Samling, about 8,500\n\nof them also enlisted in the collaborationist paramilitary organization Hirden.

After the war, 92,000 people were\n\naccused of having assisted the Germans. 15,000 Norwegians volunteered for\n\nWaffen-SS.\n\nIn 1942, the systematic persecution and arrest of all people of Jewish descent in Norway began. Norwegian Nazis (Hirdmen) organized the deportation\n\nof 772 of the approximately 2,100 Jews who lived in Norway, assisted by the\n\nStatspolitiet. Through the years 1942 and 1943, these Norwegian Jews were deported to Nazi German death camps. Most of them on a single day, November 26,\n\n1942, when 532 Norwegian Jews were deported from Oslo on the ship DS Donau.\n\nMost of them were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau and murdered there â among\n\nthem all the women and children. Only nine of those deported on the Donau\n\nsurvived. In all, only 26 of the deported Norwegian Jews survived the camps.31\n\nThe belongings and homes of the deported and murdered Norwegians Jews,\n\nas well as of some of those who had escaped to Sweden,32 were confiscated and\n\npartially taken over by local Norwegians.33 Recent research on the Norwegian\n\nresistance movement indicates that parts of the Norwegian resistance movement chose to look away when the harassment and deportations of Jews took\n\nplace in Norway.34 The murdered Norwegian Jews accounted for more than one\n\nthird of the Norwegian Jewry and constituted more than 50 per cent of all Norwegians killed during the war.\n\nCollaboration: Sweden\n\nLike the other Nordic countries, Sweden had declared itself a neutral country. By\n\nimplication this signaled a wish to stay outside a war, should it break out.

Actually, this had already started before the war.\n\nIn October 1938, inspired by Switzerland, Sweden pressed for marking German passports with a âJâ to help block German Jews from entering Sweden. At\n\nthe time, strong xenophobic and anti-Jewish sentiments in certain sectors of the\n\nSwedish public prevailed, not least among certain public office holders and academics, who opposed to âthe importation of Jewsâ, partly âto protect the Swedish stockâ, partly because they perceived this as a possible threat to their own\n\npositions. On a political level, they also argued that receiving Jewish refugees\n\nwould increase unwanted anti-Semitism in the Swedish population.37\n\nAfter the war had broken out, Germany complained on occasion about Swedish press reports. Sweden, to avoid annoying German sensitivity on these points,\n\nadapted to some of the German demands and took restrictive measures towards\n\ncertain elements critical of Nazi Germany in the Swedish press.\n\nAs part of their warfare towards Norway, Germany demanded access to the\n\ntransportation of goods and troops through Sweden. After difficult deliberations,\n\non June 18, 1940 and again on July 8 of the same year, the Swedish government\n\ngave in to the German requests. The German use of the Swedish railway system\n\nsuccessively increased, and Germany also came to control part of the Swedish\n\ntele-line system.\n\nA special event within the realm of Swedenâs cooperation with Germany occurred around midsummer 1941, when Sweden gave in to German demands to\n\ntransport large military troop units, Division Engelbrecht, from Norway to Finland\n\nthrough northern Sweden. All through the war, Sweden served Germany as a\n\n35 Cf. Klas Ã mark, Att bo granne med ondskan.

Still, at the beginning of the year 1941 Sweden had admitted about 3,000 Jews escaping from Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia. In 1942/43, Sweden received up to 1,000\n\nJewish refugees from Norway40 and in October 1943 welcomed approximately\n\n7,000 Jews from Denmark. No Jews living in Sweden were deported to Nazi concentration camps.41\n\nVictims and Survivors\n\nHow many people in each of the countries were killed because of World War II?\n\nHow many died because of Nazi German persecution directed directly toward\n\nthem? How many Jews in each of the countries became victims of the Holocaust, i.e. were murdered by the Nazis?\n\nThe absolute exact numbers are hard to calculate, but estimated approximate figures based on balancing different sources give enough information to\n\nbe useful to the present analysis:\n\nAs can be seen in Table 1, Finland and Sweden stand out in terms of causalities during World War II among the four Nordic countries. Fighting the war on\n\nthe German side, Finland lost by far more lives both in absolute and relative\n\nterms than all of the other Nordic countries taken together, whereas neighboring\n\nSweden, staying neutral during the war, lost âonlyâ a fraction of that sum â for\n\n38 Cf.

Both countries had officially declared themselves neutral up to the\n\nbeginning of the war, both were attacked and invaded by German troops on the\n\nvery same day, April 9, 1940. Denmark did not put up any significant resistance to\n\nthe German invasion, the king and government stayed and collaborated with the\n\nGerman occupiers. In Norway, the opposite is true.

When this failed, the\n\nking and the government left the country and continued to direct the resistance to\n\nthe German occupation from their exile in London. The costs for this in terms of\n\nlost Norwegian lives turned out to be more than twice as high as was the case in\n\ncooperating Denmark.\n\nRegarding Jewish Holocaust victims, it should be noted that although Finland fought side by side with German troops, no Finnish Jews were rounded up\n\neither by German or by local Finnish Nazis and deported to the Nazi concentration and extermination camps.43 The situation was not entirely different in Denmark. Until October 1943, when the politics of collaboration broke down, the\n\nDanish Jews were on the whole not physically harmed by the German occupiers\n\nbecause of their Jewishness. When the collaboration policy had broken down, a\n\ncomparatively small number of Danish Jews, 472 people, were arrested and\n\ntransported to Theresienstadt, from where none of them â in contrast to Jews\n\nfrom other countries who had been sent to Theresienstadt â were deported to\n\nAuschwitz-Birkenau or any other of the extermination camps.44\n\nFifty-three Danish Jews died on the way to or in Theresienstadt, not directly\n\nmurdered but due to illness, hardships and age. In January 1945, towards the end\n\nof the war, when there were already plans to eliminate the camp, the Swedish\n\nCount Bernadotte, member of the royal family and vice chairman of the Red\n\nCross of Sweden, succeeded in negotiating with the German authorities, among\n\nthem ReichsfÃ¼hrer-SS Heinrich Himmler, to get permission to send buses to Theresienstadt to evacuate Scandinavian citizens, among them the Danish Jews. These\n\nbusses, called the White buses because they were painted white with large red\n\ncrosses and Swedish flags on their roof and sides, drove back through war-struck\n\nEurope and occupied Denmark to bring them to safety in Sweden. There, the by\n\nfar largest share of the Danish Jews, approximately 7,000 people, were already\n\nlocated, helped and rescued to Sweden by Danish civilians.45\n\nSweden had stayed outside the war and no Swedish Jews lost their lives in\n\nthe Holocaust. In sharp contrast to this stand the events in Norway. In 1942, the\n\nsystematic persecution and arrest of all people of Jewish descent intensified in\n\nNorway. A total of 773 Norwegian Jews were deported to Nazi German death\n\n43 Eight foreign (Austrian) Jews were sent to Estonia, seven were killed, one returned.\n\n44 One (1) Danish man â supposedly by mistake â got included in a transport to AuschwitzBirkenau in March 1944. Cf. H.G. Adler, Theresienstadt 1941â1945. The Face of a Coerced Community (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2017).\n\n45 Cf.

Only 38 Norwegian Jews survived the camps. This means\n\nthat 47.1% of Norwegian Jewry were according to a calculation of Jewish deaths in\n\nWWII.46 The murdered Norwegian Jews constituted more than 50 per cent of all\n\nNorwegians killed during the war.\n\nBefore the outbreak of the war, the Norwegian Jews numbered about 2,100.\n\nOn the census in 1946, the number had been reduced to 556. Most of them had\n\nsurvived by escaping to Sweden. In contrast to the Danish Jews who were generally very well received in Denmark upon their return from Sweden, the Norwegian\n\nJews confronted difficulties at their return home. This could involve problems getting back their apartments, properties and jobs.\n\nCollaborationism and Heroism Re-evaluated\n\nAs should be clear by now, the Nordic countries pursued very different policies\n\nand strategies vis-Ã -vis Nazi Germany during World War II. What were their rationales for acting as they did? There were certainly many concerns and mixed, even\n\ncontradicting, motives for the actions taken by the states and national authorities.\n\nStill, in the final analysis, one basic question and one overruling rationale for the\n\npolicy taken in each of the countries may be delineated. The premise is that there\n\nis little doubt that the pre-war regimes in all of the Nordic countries regarded Nazi\n\nGerman expansionism as threatening. It was quite clear to them all at the time\n\nthat the German military force were overwhelmingly strong compared to their\n\nown national military capabilities.\n\nAt the bottom of the challenges facing each of the four neutral Nordic countries at the time of the outbreak of World War II lies the Faustian question: what to\n\ndo if a by far stronger and malicious party, a âdevilâ, decides to attack and rule\n\nover your life? A question that compels considerations of both strategic and moral\n\ncharacter, and not least, how to balance such considerations against each other.\n\nOne immediate impulse might be to oppose the invader because it would\n\nbe morally right to do so regardless. The âdevilâ is the incarnation of evil, and\n\nwhen he attacks you and even takes over your home, you fight back as much as\n\nyou can to show you do not accept his unjust ruling over you and your country.\n\nTo you, it is simply the righteous thing to do; others might regard your resistance heroic.\n\n46 Cf. Michelet, Den stÃ¸rste forbrytelsen. Cf. also Bjarne Bruland, Holocaust i Norge. Registrering, deportasjon tilintetgjÃ¸relse (Oslo: Dreyers, 2017).\n\nConsiderate Collaborationism: If You Canât Beat Them, Join Them 27\n\nP:49\n\nAn opposite, and perhaps less immediate, impulse might be to realize your\n\nown relative weakness and simply give in to the supremacy of the National Socialists. You cannot do anything about his rampage anyway. To you, this appears\n\nas the only sensible option there is, although others might regard your actions as\n\nbeing both cowardly and unworthy. Collaboration in order to gain advantages for\n\noneself is seldom regarded as heroic. On the contrary, the party which engages in\n\nthis will get their âhands dirtyâ, their reputation will become tainted.\n\nHowever, a certain degree of collaboration in order to save lives and avoid\n\nmore harm than unavoidably necessary might very well be the most humane\n\nthing you can do, given the circumstances. This collaboration then must not be\n\nbased in any sympathy or ideological agreement with the âdevilâsâ political or\n\nmilitary aims. On the contrary, it is out of conscious disagreement with these\n\ngoals, even as a move to prevent from realizing them, that you engage in negotiations with the Nazis. Collaboration from this point of view consists of carefully considered pragmatic actions taken for calculated strategic reasons. I will\n\nlabel this considerate collaborationism.\n\nSo, let us try to describe the overruling rationale for collaborationism in\n\neach of the four Nordic countries.\n\nDenmark: Pragmatic Collaborationism â Courting\n\nthe Nazis\n\nRefraining from fighting back and on the official level de facto accepting the German occupation by engaging in peaceful cooperation, in particular concerning\n\ncommerce and trade, while at the same time not giving in to Nazi German ambitions to capture and deport Danish citizens of Jewish descent, served to make the\n\nGerman occupation of Denmark comparatively mild. In spite of this, on the civilian\n\nlevel, in particular among university students and Communists, there were some\n\nclandestine groups who put up an organized and armed resistance towards the\n\npresence of the German occupiers. These groups, however, never really provoked\n\nthe Germans from continuing their, in comparison to how it went in other Nazi\n\noccupied countries, relatively less violent occupation of Denmark. However, after\n\nthe breakdown of the official collaboration policy in October 1943, this changed\n\ndrastically. The magnitude of civilian resistance greatly intensified, manifesting\n\nitself in, among others, the widespread assistance of Danish civilians, medical\n\npersonnel, fishermen, individual police officers, priests and so on in helping\n\ntheir Jewish countrymen to escape to Sweden.\n\n28 Lars Dencik\n\nP:50\n\nDanish pragmatism with respect to collaborationism seems to have served\n\nthe Danish society and their citizens, including their Jewish citizens, quite well.\n\nFinland: The Enemy of Your Enemy is Your\n\nFriend â Even If He is a Nazi\n\nGiven the geopolitical reality, having been attacked by Soviet military forces\n\nand deprived of vital parts of their land, Finland had a primary goal to gain\n\nback what had been occupied by the Soviet Union. The fact the Finland engaged on the German side in their war against the Soviet Union should be understood from this perspective. At the same time, it is noteworthy that although\n\nactually not occupied by Nazi Germany, like Denmark Finland refused to let\n\ntheir Jewish citizens be rounded up and deported.\n\nGiven this, the Finnish military collaborationism appears to have been a\n\npragmatic way of serving national geopolitical interests as well as, strangely\n\nenough, also the tiny Jewish portion of the Finnish population.\n\nNorway: Official Ideological Collaboration\n\nand Civilian Resistance â Fighting the Nazis\n\nand Spilling Blood\n\nThe Norwegian government, including the king, refused to give in to Nazi German claims. Instead, they supported and organized resistance, both military\n\nand civilian, to the German occupation of Norway. The"
