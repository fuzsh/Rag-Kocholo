        "text": "On August 19th, 1942, a superpowered Canadian soldier going by the name Sergeant Commando participated in an Allied attack on the port town of Dieppe during the height of the Second World War. The world was never the same again. I lost count of all the superheroes that came after him, or all the times they saved the world. We thought we were invincible, that our heroes would always be there to save us.\n\nUntil they came from the stars.\n\nWe called them the Other, because we could never find out what they called themselves. We never knew what they wanted, outside of our own extinction. We weren't ready to face a threat like them. Millions were killed, nations were dismantled, the earth was laid to waste. We had almost lost hope when a miracle occurred, and the heroes managed to destroy their mother ship. We had won, but our victory was bittersweet, and we spent the next two years cleaning up the rest of the Others, rebuilding our nations, and burying the dead. But we were alive, and we had the heroes to thank for that.\n\nIt's now 2022, eighty years after the Commando stepped onto the beaches of occupied France. The old nations are dead, and the new ones are still picking up the pieces. We've been saved from the brink of death once, here's hoping we don't start the whole cycle over again.\n\nPeace in our time.​\n\nWelcome, one and all, to the highly anticipated KIOT2, an IOT set in the world of a comic book!\n\nHow to Join:\n\nSpoiler :\n\nJoining is not too difficult. You do so by providing a name for your nation, a quick description of said nation, up to thirty starting claims, and as much more information as you're willing to grace us with. Starting with less then the allotted thirty will net you a stability bonus, in addition to all the bonuses you get from providing a lot of info in your signup.\n\nDa Map:\n\nSpoiler :\n\nStatistics and You\n\nSpoiler :\n\nWhile this game is heavily focused on RP, it's not really fair of me to just wing it in regards to the actions of your nations. As much as I'd love to painstakingly craft a complex, intricate code to accurately document how much GDP the inevitable Balkan dictator will draw in every turn, the stats will be kept simple, for now. If you're familiar with that other game you'll be familiar with this.\n\nMoney: Dollars, rupees, or galactic credits, this is the stuff you use to get the things you need.\n\nEconomic: The glue that holds your nation together. The economic stat represents the infrastructure, factories, and markets that help your nation turn a profit. Each point in this category earns you $1 per turn, and investing $5 in this category will earn you an extra point, although RP is more efficient at getting this total up.\n\nMilitary: This translates to the military strength of your country, from the grunts with rifles on the ground to the command structure of the entire nation. It's what you use to beat up other nations, to put it bluntly. Like economics, spending $5 in this category translates to one point, and also like economics RP will be more efficient at improving this stat. In a pinch, you can also enact a draft and trade economic points for an equal amount of military points, for a minor hit to stability.\n\nStability: A percentage stat that influences how much people want you to be their leader. Several things can influence your stability for better or for worse, so be sure to keep an ear to the ground, lest the peasantry storm into your fancy palace, remove your head from your shoulders, and get their grubby fingerprints all over the fine china.\n\nAgent/Operative Pool: This is the amount of agents in your employ. This will be explained in the info dump approximately two categories down.\n\nEvery nation will begin with 20 Economic, 20 Military, and 80% stability before any changes are made due to signup and pre-game RP.\n\nWar and Peace\n\nSpoiler :\n\nConflict is inevitable, and when diplomacy fails sometimes you have to get aggressive with your negotiations. To attack or defend, simply state your intention to do so and assign points from your military pool to commit to the attack. Any points not used will be placed on general defense to react with threats as they arise. Good RP will always help you more then the roll of the dice, so be sure to submit good war plans as well! Just remember that war is costly, and no matter how evil your opponent may be, your populace isn't really going to enjoy fighting for long.\n\nOh, and WMDs are not available. Yet.\n\nThe Other Remnants\n\nSpoiler :\n\nWhen the Other invaded our world, they brought with them weapons and technology that far surpassed anything humanity had ever seen before. With the threat eliminated, it's only a matter of time before the secrets of the Other's awesome technology are uncovered. Researching the technology of the Other isn't necessary to advance technologically in the game, but understanding their ways can give you a significant advantage over your enemies.\n\nOther technology is advanced in two stages, acquisition and research. The first step is acquiring material from the invasion relevant to the technology you're trying to research, in whatever way you can. You can get creative in your acquisition of the rare alien tech, and I'll provide hints on where to get it at several points in the game, so keep an eye out. The second part, the research itself, is done automatically, but you can speed up the process using money, agents (see below), or RP. The bonuses you can get from this advanced technology are powerful, but they could backfire on you, so make sure you know what you're getting into.\n\nThose who play with the devil's toys...\n\nAgents and Espionage\n\nSpoiler :\n\nNo man is an island, even in this day and age, so if you need a job done right, you call in the agents.\n\nAgents are \"units\" that you can acquire through the course of the game through actions or random events. In universe, agents could be anything from lady-killer secret agents, elite spec ops squadrons, or even a super powered lackey that answers directly to the head of state. Whatever you decide to call them, their primary use is to commit espionage actions. Simply state your action and assign one or more agents to do the deed. You can also assign agents to counterespionage duties to stop naughty enemy agents from snooping around in your country.\n\nSometimes you might also come across special agents known as Operatives. These super-agents are acquired through event choices, particularly good RP, or may even be promoted from your regular agent pool. In addition to their normal duties, operatives can be utilized to support other actions your nation may take, such as leading an army into battle or managing the construction of infrastructure in your biggest economic center. Some important Operatives may even have bonuses attached to them, so be sure to use them wisely!\n\nNGOs and the Heroes\n\nSpoiler :\n\nNot every powerful entity in this world is a nation. Over the course of the game you will have to face many non-government organizations, or NGOs. These can be anything, ranging from multinational corporations to terrorist factions, and can be player created or spawn at random, depending on how the dice fall. An NGOs only stat is the agent pool, which is hidden from public view, and if their agents are all removed they are eliminated from the game. Be careful when dealing with them, as they have the potential to be very nasty.\n\nAlso a note on the most common NGO: The Superhuman. First appearing in the midst of the Second World War, the superhuman has had a monumental impact on history, and they can and will have a monumental impact on your nation. From the lowliest of super powered crime fighters to demigods with the power to warp reality, they are a factor that can't be ignored when you rule your nation. Be ready to deal with them.\n\nNotes\n\n-Updates are seasonal, and every year will go in the order of Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall.\n\n-As this is a story based game not governed by hard stats, there's always a chance I could make a mistake when managing the game. If you think I have done something unfair or missed something important, do not hesitate to contact me about it.\n\n-Don't forget to play along and have a good time!\n\nDO NOT POST YET\n\nTech Progression\n\nSpoiler :\n\nOther Insight\n\nPrerequisites: None\n\nMaterial Requirement: None\n\nThere's so much that we still don't understand about the alien invaders. Before we delve into their darkest secrets, we need to start at the smallest level and dig deeper. The broken bits and pieces of the Other's war machine do not seem significant, but at this stage even the scraps of an alien's boot can be extremely valuable. By collecting this detritus and studying it, we can steadily augment existing human technology, improving conventional technologies across the board and creating prototypes of near-future technologies, such as laser-based weaponry and rudimentary fusion power.\n\nOther Cornerstone Technology\n\nPrerequisites: Other Insight\n\nMaterial Requirement: None\n\nAt this level, the lowest levels of Other technology move from being unwieldy prototypes to feasible upgrades to our own technology. Laser weaponry becomes comparable to and even surpasses conventional projectile weapons, and more and more Other-inspired engineering and scientific techniques become integrated into our technology. It is at this point that we can delve into the deeper aspects of Other technology, the ones behind some of the more unconventional weapons that the Other brought to our world.\n\nHeroic Roster\n\nSpoiler :\n\nSergeant Commando\n\nSpoiler :\n\nNation of Origin: Canada\n\nLocation: North America\n\nStatus: Active\n\nThe world's first known superhuman, James Howlett, later known as Sergeant Commando, was a maimed war veteran recruited by British and Canadian scientists as part of the top secret Halifax Project. Halifax was intended to create an army of super soldiers to fight against Hitler in Europe, but an unfortunate accident meant that Howlette was the only one who received the experimental treatment. Gifted with superhuman strength, stamina, and healing, Howlett was deployed to the European theater with resounding success, where he led the charge against Hitler until early 1945, when the brilliant but sadistic Field Marshall Rennard von Fertig usurped power from the floundering Nazi regime and deployed his armies of genetic monstrosities against the Allies in force, nearly turning back their advance on the German capital. Despite the surprising success of the new German regime, Sergeant Commando ultimately led the Allies to victory, but victory came at a cost. Howlett attacked von Fertig himself as he attempted to escape on his stealth submarine, and during the pitched battle, the submarine mysteriously vanished. Howlett would not be seen again until he was discovered in the frozen wreckage of the submarine as it drifted in the Arctic Ocean nearly thirty years later.\n\nHowlett quickly adapted to the changed world he had returned to, and after a few stints in the Canadian military he retired to take on the mantle of full-time super heroics during the 80's and 90's, teaming up regularly with the American Mike Magnum and the Australian Automatic Man to fight crime. A soldier and an idealist to the core, he tackled every challenge with confidence and can-do attitude. Since the Other Invasion, he's returned to his usual super heroic antics, his old optimism blunted by the loss of his two greatest friends and allies during the deadly fighting.\n\nMike Magnum (Deceased)\n\nSpoiler :\n\nNation of Origin: United States\n\nLocation: N/A\n\nStatus: Dead\n\nMichael Ford, born Lukas Galishoff, was the son of two Austrian refugees who immigrated to California following the destruction of the Second World War. Growing up watching the old war movies featuring the amazing Sergeant Commando and his colorful allies, Lukas dreamed of being a big-screen hero just like the Commando, and began working his way up the food chain in Hollywood, picking up small bits and making all of the right friends until he had acquired enough clout to create his own low budget movie. Changing his name to the more American-friendly Michael Ford, he directed and produced the 1976 smash hit Mike Magnum, an action movie starring himself as a heroic superhuman fighting to stop a cybernetic reincarnation of Rennard von Fertig from plunging the world into nuclear war. Overnight he became the hero of the silver screen he always wanted to be, but when a supervillain with a fanatical devotion to Von Fertig attacked Ford at a morning talk show, he and the rest of the world discovered that Mike Magnum's fantastic abilities to create hard light constructs at will was not limited to his films.\n\nSporting a dual reputation as a real life superhero and a Hollywood superstar, Mike Magnum became incredibly popular around the world, teaming up with his old hero Sergeant Commando to save the world on a regular basis and starring in ten sequels to his original movie, among other major movie roles. His ego-centric Hollywood persona masked a good heart and an unending devotion to his friends. He fought heroically against the Other Invasion, but in the final climactic battle he sacrificed himself to take down the Other's Mothership, ending the invasion once and for all.\n\nTimberwolf\n\nSpoiler :\n\nNation of Origin: United States?\n\nLocation: North America?\n\nStatus: Presumed Alive\n\nUnlike her other counterparts in North America, very little is known publicly about the elusive superhero Timberwolf. While not believed to possess any such superpowers, she is shown to be a highly adept combatant, highly skilled in archery, martial arts, stealth, and subterfuge. Somewhat of a lone wolf, no pun intended, Timberwolf stalks the night fighting petty criminals and organized crime on the East Coast, although she has been shown to work regularly with other superhumans. She has not been seen since the end of the Other Invasion, but at this point it is unknown whether or not this is due to her dying or suffering some sort of tragedy during the invasion or just her usual aloofness. Only time will tell.\n\nVenganzo\n\nSpoiler :\n\nNation of Origin: Costa Rica\n\nLocation: South America\n\nStatus: Active\n\nSome heroes believe in justice. Venganzo believes in retribution. Some heroes take care not to become the monsters that they are fighting. Venganzo became a greater monster then his enemies. The end result is that the enigma of a man known as Venganzo, despite having no superpowers to speak of, has cemented a reputation as the most brutally violent hero in the world right now. Believed to be from some sort of special forces unit and a veteran of several wars, the man who would become Venganzo saw his family executed by government forces as punishment for his perceived disloyalty. Going mad with grief, the man died that day, taking thirty two government agents with him, and Venganzo was born in his stead, and he has cut a bloody swath through South America ever since. Ruthlessly combating crime and corruption wherever he finds it, his brutal tactics have made him a celebrated hero to the oppressed and downtrodden in South America, but a pariah to others who, in his words, \"live comfortable lives and never needed someone to fight back for them\". It's something of a testament to his tenacity and unrelenting ferocity that the guerilla war he waged against the Other invaders led to some of the worst defeats the aliens ever suffered.\n\nMr. Carnival\n\nSpoiler :\n\nNation of Origin: Unknown\n\nLocation: South America\n\nStatus: Active?\n\nMr. Carnival is a being and a hero that defies description. Coming from a dimension that, according to him, humans are incapable of comprehending, Mr. Carnival popped up in Brazil sometime in the late 90's and started combating crime with seemingly no motivation other than a sense of boredom. Mr. Carnival's primary ability seems to be complete independence from the laws of reality, which he prefers to utilize for comedic effect, such as the famous incident where Mr. Carnival broke up a major drug cartel by compelling over 300 chief members to perform Riverdance outside a police station. The amount of power he theoretically has is staggering, but his infrequent appearances and his preference to use his immense power in a comedic manner and in small scale incidents keeps him in check. He also seems to possess some degree of omnipotence in regards to future events, which he keeps it to himself for fear of spoiling \"the plot\", and apparently possesses the ability to travel between realties, referring to individual universes with the unusual moniker of \"forum games\".\n\nOverclock\n\nSpoiler :\n\nNation of Origin: Ireland\n\nLocation: Europe\n\nStatus: Active\n\nTracey Taggart was the only (and some say illegitimate) daughter of the Irish tech mogul, philanthropist, and lady's man Donald Taggart, the owner of the eponymous Taggart Electronics. Tracey, despite the unfortunate rumors surrounding her birth, was a gifted child who showed promise with robotics technology at an early age, a talent that was almost snuffed out when she was thirteen years old. While visiting her father at his work place after school, she offered to take a package up to his office, not knowing that the package was a bomb sent by a bitter rival to assassinate Donald Taggart in a suitably messy faction. Tracey recognized the package as hostile and tried to disarm it, but she only managed to disable the payload from going off, which would have killed everyone on that floor of the building, before the detonator exploded, showering her with shrapnel. No one died from the explosion, but the shrapnel impacted her spinal cord, paralyzing her from the waist down. The attempted assassination of a revered public figure was an international outrage, which nearly started a war between Ireland and the United Kingdom were it not for the intervention of superheroes. Automatic Man, whom Taggart had helped to create, volunteered to track down the culprit, along with his two friends Mike Magnum and Sergeant Commando, and together they brought the man behind the attacks to justice and prevented a devastating war. They also helped Tracey to cope with her paralysis, with Automatic Man going so far as to offer Tracey a job doing tech support for them. Tracey accepted the task eagerly, adopting the moniker \"Overclock\".\n\nFor the next ten years, Tracey would work behind the scenes as the major superheroes took on greater challenges than ever. With a little help from her father's company, she also began experimenting heavily with drone technology, creating unmanned drones and a prototype armored suit, all designed to resemble medieval knights in some fashion. Tracey would not take to the field of battle until ten years after becoming Overclock, when the first alien invaders landed. Donning her newly made cybernetic power armor, Tracey walked for the first time since her terrible accident, and began fighting alongside the superheroes as an equal. With the disappearance and presumed death of her father during the invasion, Tracey has since inherited her father's company, and plans to utilize the resources at her disposal to expand her security network and continue fighting the good fight as Overclock.\n\nGazardiel , the Winged Warlock\n\nSpoiler :\n\nNation of Origin: Medieval Flanders\n\nLocation: Europe\n\nStatus: Active\n\n-Gazardiel is a dragon in a human disguise, based loosely on the ones from Fire Emblem, who until the last few decades was blissfully unaware that he was a dragon.

Much of their resources in the 50's and 60's were directed towards recreating the serum that gave Commando his powers, and when those attempts failed, they turned to atomic energy, disintegrating political dissidents in an attempt to create their own superhumans. The Soviets finally struck gold, figuratively speaking, with Luká&#353; Slavik, a poor farmer arrested by the state for unknown reasons. Bombarded with atomic energy for weeks, Lukas' body reformed into that of a new being, composed of pure atomic energy rather than flesh and bone. Enclosing him in a lead armored suit, the Soviets introduced the world to Netryonov, a model Soviet and a superman with the power of the atom at his disposal, who would serve as an enemy to the \"Western\" heroes and a puppet of the Soviet government.\n\nNetryonov, however, was not happy with his participation in brutal repressions on behalf of the Soviet Union, and in the mid-90s he fled the Soviet Union and made a damning public statement, renouncing his Soviet citizenship and decrying the evils of his former masters. The desertion of Netryonov sparked revolution in Soviet states worldwide, and within the year the Soviet Union had collapsed. Netryonov then sought peace with the other heroes that he had fought so many times before, and began working to repair his reputation in the Balkans and Eastern Europe where he had been used most frequently as a pacification tool. He was one of the more notable heroes who joined in the defense of Bulgaria, a nation which had suffered greatly at his hands in the past, against the alien invaders.\n\nHorus\n\nSpoiler :\n\nNation of Origin: Duat (extraterrestrial)\n\nLocation: Africa\n\nStatus: Active\n\n-Horus is an alien whose people made contact with ancient Egyptians who saw them as their Gods, totally not a Thor ripoff that has similar powers and a staff which controls lightning-\n\nAmanzi\n\nSpoiler :\n\nNation of Origin: South Africa\n\nLocation: Africa\n\nStatus: Active\n\n-Amanzi is a girl who was turned into living water in a freak accident.-\n\nWhite Tiger\n\nSpoiler :\n\nNation of Origin: India\n\nLocation: Asia\n\nStatus: Active\n\n-White Tiger is a mystical warrior, skilled in both magic and combat, who fights to defend his hidden utopian city from those who would do harm to it.-\n\nRocket Angel\n\nSpoiler :\n\nNation of Origin: Japanese/Unknown\n\nLocation: Asia\n\nStatus: Active\n\n-Rocket Angel is a young girl who has a symbiotic relationship with an alien in an iron-man-esque bio-mechanical suit.

But until mid-Floréal, it remained that - just university conflict.\n\nIt was at one of the unlikeliest of places - Durham University - that it all began. On 13 Floréal 176 (2 May 1968), the university was closed. Clashes ensued, and several of the dissident leaders were arrested by Newcastle police who had been called in to support, sparking outrage. In response, a national student strike was called, and thousands upon thousands of students responded - and not just London, but St Andrews, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Oxford, Cambridge, and Bristol all erupted into mass action. They were joined by students at high school and college after high school and college throughout the United Kingdom, and following that, by left-wing intellectuals, authors, and artists, many belonging Situationist International.\n\nBut it was at London that what began as mere university unrest at Imperial, University, and King's by 21 Floréal (10 May) had morphed into an all-out situationist rebellion against capitalism, Christianity, the commodity society, the class system, and the entire British government from top to bottom. All three universities, plus the London School of Economics, were occupied and declared autonomous \"People's Universities.\" The Londoners were joined by increasing numbers of young workers, leading to a rolling wave of wildcat strikes in support of the students. Elsewhere in the country, students from every last college at Durham, Cambridge and Oxford congregated and declared their universities \"People's Universities,\" too. Glasgow and Edinburgh followed.\n\nIt might have stopped there, but the wildcat strikes in the last décade of Floréal escalated into something far, far greater, when they spread into the coal pits and the automobile plants. Workers not only went on strike, they seized and occupied their own workplaces. Half a million people marched down Fleet Street, day after day after day. \"Popular Action Committees\" formed in towns and cities across the country for the people to take control. One such occupied the Palace Theatre in London's West End, proudly defacing the building's doors with the words, When Parliament becomes a bourgeois theatre, all the bouregois theatres must be turned into parliaments! Demonstrators in Edinburgh occupied Hollyrood and raised red flags above the Old Town. Demonstrators in Hackney took control of the BBC transmission tower and used it to broadcast pro-revolutionary messages across Greater London. Demonstrators in Oxford Circus threw copies of Wilhelm Reich's The Mass Psychology of Fascism at police, shouting \"Read Reich and act accordingly!\" By 1 Prairial (20 May), it was clear the dissidents would not stop until all of British society was changed forever.\n\nWith over a quarter of the entire country's population simultaneously on strike, the advanced capitalist economy of the United Kingdom had ground to a crashing halt, and the national government had ceased to function, with many government and civil service workers joining the ranks of strikers. Order broke down into a grand spirit of revolution. The leftist opposition called for elections, but the union leadership, the socialist parties, had all been abandoned - they had, in some cases, actively tried to stop the unrest. Labor unions are whorehouses, said one work of graffiti on the doors of Bow Church. \"Please leave the Communist Party as clean on leaving it as you would like to find it on entering,\" went a common saying in Glasgow. Attempted reforms to stave off revolution were all rejected by militant students and workers, calling for nothing less than the complete overthrow of the government and the complete people's takeover of the economy.\n\nWestminster was barely holding on. On 7 Prairial (26 May), on the advice of Prime Minister Maudling, King Edward VIII and some members of the royal family evacuated the country, ultimately for Australia. Maudling followed two days later, leaving the crumbling United Kingdom in the hands of one minister, Margaret Thatcher (reportedly after Edward Heath refused to take the job and resigned his seat in the Commons). Finally, on 11 Prairial (30 May), students stormed Westminster, placing Thatcher under arrest, and dissolving the old United Kingdom. The same day, a new one was created, with the elevation of a young activist leader named George Harrison to the temporary premiership. The Princess Elizabeth, who had shown sympathy for the situationists, accepted an offer of the crown.

His was known as a child to be very bossy, ordering kids to take others lunch money. At age 14 he won the Junior Speaking Competition but the medal was taken off him when it was found that he had bribed one the judges with fake money. His parents decided to throw him into a military academy in hope of disciplining him. Unfortunately discipline he did receive&#8230; to order others about with even stricter sense, as the school decided to place him in a junior officer course. He would then go to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst to develop further his skills. He was noted by fellow military students for his power abuse, his paranoia, his determination, his hard work and his cunning. However he would not complete: he got kicked out for delving into his first case of weapons smuggling, selling military grade weapons to teenage criminal gangs. He was spared jail in return for a spying job to spy on an attempted weapons smuggling ring of the Real IRA. It was hoped he would reform and an agent was set to make him a better citizen, even offering him in return political speech classes in return for good behaviour. However Bryson decided not to do weapon smuggling but training classes for would be Real IRA insurgents, teaching them academy grade squad tactics and on frontier doctrines being considered by scholars. He even his speech lessons to help chair Real IRA meetings. When the agent found out eventually Bryson had managed to get a ticket to Brazil before the Northern Irish authorities could arrest him. He had been age 22.\n\nThe life of Bryson for the next years remain unclear but he moved around the world serving as an officer trainer for hire for different groups around the world, from Afghanistan insurgent to Somalian pirate groups to Columbian drug cartels to Syrian terror cells to even Scottish bankers&#8230; through the latter&#8217;s Hong Kong branch of course. This all altered though when he reached 29 when he ended being captured by a Special Air Service raid after he was linked with aiding with the planning of the Liverpool Bombings on behalf of a terrorist cell. He was saved from the helicopter that was bought down by commandos of the covert mercenary organisation known as known as the Company of the Dawn, leaded by the figure who adopted the traditional alias of Nikolas A&#965;&#947;&#942;. Nikolas A&#965;&#947;&#942; has become the adopted name of the head of the Company of the Dawn (which traces its roots to the 9th century in the East Roman Empire) after the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans.\n\nNikolas A&#965;&#947;&#942; invited Tony into the organisation to serve as an officer. Tony was rechristened as Vinsin Vancore upon joining the order. Vancore took the time to serve as aiding as aofficer in division groups. Vancore was said to express an increased authoritarian consideration, believing the world was &#8220;without true order and peace.&#8221; He took teachings from a to one of the Company&#8217;s most notable historical generals, Lloyd Gethic, who taught that &#8220;the world must know iron to know peace.&#8221;\n\nWhen the aliens (who were christened as Akyri Gónos or Void Spawn to the Dawn) invaded Vancore (aged 36) was granted command of his own set of divisions within the Company and assisted to aid the Dawn general Alexis Drakos in Central America and the Caribean. The Company managed to acquire the Second World War dated fortress on Isla de la Juventud, Punto Victoria, and granted Vancore the fort as Dragos's HQ. Vancore was given orders during the initial invasion by the other to deploy Dawn command over the Central American governments to &#8220;ensure unity against the threat.&#8221; Those who did not comply founded themselves ousted and mutilated by bullets. Cuba was liberated from the Other during the midst of the war. Haiti was safe guarded in this period. Overall Alexis Drakos deployed herself in defending Central America and the Caribbean from the alien threat; Vancore served as her right hand, with special attention to countering perceived guerrilla movements said to have sympathizing with the alien invaders and forces of the Akyri Gónos themselves. Though able to protect the area the Dawn would suffer heavy loses during the alien war and Central America would not be different, as even the more elite troops faced their ends.\n\nDuring this time reports came from the Pacific that the government of Fiji were attempted to support the alien invasion. Vancore, convinced that Fiji proved that humanity was &#8220;too divided and required unity to avoid destruction,&#8221; attempted to demand a heavy crackdown on what he perceived a possible \"void worshiper element\" within the Dawn itself. At first this was taken as a overreaction by the Company due to the stress of the conflict but that changed when Alexis Drakos was assassinated by what was blamed on a alien sympathy force but skeptics considered the possibility that the assassination was arranged for the benefit of Vancore rise to take command of the Dawn forces in Central America and the Caribean. What happened next would both cripple the Dawn and bring forth a power not seen since Von Fertig took power in Germany; Vancore became convince that the very leadership of the Dawn were set to undermine humanity in favour of the Other. Whether this was a actual conspiracy theory Vancore took to heart or a allusive excuse for power hunger does not matter; what does was that the aura of paranoia while the alien invasion was going on leaded to Nikolas A&#965;&#947;&#942; to set forth General Kasun Thryng, one of A&#965;&#947;&#942;'s top generals, to the Central Americas with a strike force to relieve Vancore of his post, fearing that Vancore had lost his loyalties and was to launch a split up from the order with the Dawn forces under his command.\n\nSadly for the Company of the Dawn the fears of Nikolas A&#965;&#947;&#942; came to be realized.\n\nVancore managed to gain the recruitment of James Owns, a Australian media expert who create a campaign of propaganda to ensure Vancore could build personal support in his American territories and to enable to paint any resistence to Vancore as akin to being sympathetic to the Void Spawn. Vancore portrayed the Company of the Dawn as being corruped by xeno sympathy and commanded a crusade against the forces of Kasun Thryng. Vancore managed to fed off the Company assault and even gained deflections including a demoralized Kasun Thryng, who began to take his conspiracies after the Fiji incident.\n\nVancore conducted a harsh counter attack on the Dawn forces based in the Pacific, resulted in heavy losses on the Company and additional deflections to Vancore's forces. The then Nikolas A&#965;&#947;&#942; himself was said to have mysteriously vanished as he headed to the Pacific to stop the madness from spreading, some believing him dead after Kasun Thryng himself flanked and defeated several of A&#965;&#947;&#942;'s personal guard. Vancore after this victory retreated back to Central America, leaving behind any occupied land in the Pacific, to continue a defense against the Other (who had exploited Vancore's crusade with renewed assaults on El Salvador) and to develop his power base. Vancore then declared the formation of a new order after Lloyd Gethic: the Gethic Hand, a vision of \"restoring order, enshrining peace and bringing unity to humanity.\" Vancore made himself the Director of the Gethic Hand and began to adopt a egomaniac attitude to world affairs, viewing himself as the only person able to ensure the world was peaceful. When the war against the Other ended the Gethic Hand had already established its administrative holds.\n\nHowever the honeymoon of the new order was not to be: Kasun Thryng began to highly regret his deflection, fearing he had empowered a \"Mussolini with dreams of Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan\" resulting in Thryng attempting to declare Gethic occupied Columbia its independence. Vancore issued a regiment from the remains of the elite Radient Guard that had deflected from the Company of the Dawn, rebranding them as the Vanguard, to relieve Thryng of his post as the militarist overseer of Columbia. Thryng responded by taking to the woods, creating from there the organization Antarsía (Greek for &#8216;rebellion&#8217 to serve as a long term rebellion against Vancore not just in Columbia but in any sector of the Gethic empire. Vancore responded by giving the Dawn deflected Xylon Toto the post of administrating Columbia and task him with the termination of Antarsía in Columbia. Meanwhile a attempted assassination attempt on the Director resulted in Vancore creating the Coreguard as his personal bodyguard, hiring one of the very SAS that had once arrested him, Carl Anderson who had taken to mercenary activities just before the Others invaded. Meanwhile the exiled disgraced Japanese scientist Dr Sakutarou Ashikaga was permitted to come into the Gethic Hand to lead the newly establish 'Science Division' as Vancore needed to make up for losing access to the technological skills of the Company of the Dawn (their scientists maintained loyal right to the end... and were too busy being assassinated by the infamous Moon Dagger in a vengeance fury to deflect anyway).\n\nNow, two years after the war against the Void Spawn ended, the Gethic Hand has solified its dominion over Central America. Reconstruction efforts have began, with Panama City redeveloped in a Gethic image with plans of looming structures dominating the cityscape while Vancore renamed the city Lloydus after Gethic Lloyd and the country of Panama as the province of Lloydia. With Admiral Isbel Lal of the US navy deciding to place her police state in Miami to be part of the Gethic Hand via a voluntery oath of loyalty Vancore is eyeing plans to not just recreate Central America in his own image but to conduct a series of conquests that will see the Gethic Hand expand not just across the Americas but to conduct a colonial policy to make the Hand a feared imperial power to \"ensure that peace can be maintained.\" Viewing himself as \"the antithesis of chaos\" the Director now turns his eyes to a globe, viewing for the day that his twisted interpritation of 'order,' 'peace' and 'unity' would be enforced, fearing that the Void Spawn would one day return to invade Earth with even more aggressive force and that the only way to defend humanity was for humanity to be true in union.\n\n\"To know iron is to know peace\" quoted Vancore, now aged 42, as he began efforts to rebuild the former Dawn army that deflected to him and to reforge them into a new war machine... all for the supposed 'peace' he kept bringing up in his rhetoric.\n\nHere be the overview of the Gethic troops.\n\nWIP:\n\nHaitian People&#8217;s Democratic Republic\n\nRépiblica Democrasyica Populéra Ayitia\n\nRépublique Démocratique Populaire Haïtienne\n\nRepública Democrática Popular Haitiana​\n\nMotto:\n\n&#8220;God&#8217;s Liberty for All&#8221;\n\n&#8220;Libeyta dô Dye pux Touls&#8221;\n\n&#8220;Liberté de Dieu pour Tous&#8221;\n\n&#8220;Libertad de Dios para Todos&#8221;\n\nCapital: Pôrto-ax-Croz\n\nGrand Supreme of the Haitian Presidium: Marcel Armand\n\nOfficial Languages: Haitian Creole [Crôla Ayitia], French, Spanish\n\nAnthem: La Desalinyèn\n\nPopulation: 22,145,395\n\n-56.6% Black\n\n-31.4% Mulatto\n\n-11.7% White\n\n-0.3% Asian\n\nGreat Parliament of Haiti:\n\nParties:\n\nHaitian People&#8217;s Front [Fron Populéro Ayitio]:\n\n-National Popular Party of Haiti [Pati Nasyonala Populéra d&#8217;Ayiti] 132 Seats\n\n-Haitian Workers&#8217; Party [Pati déx Travayés Ayitios] 67 Seats\n\n-Public Justice Party [Pati d&#8217;Yôstisa Publica] 16 Seats\n\nOther:\n\n-Dominican Social Christian Party [Partido Dominicana Social Cristiano] 19 Seats\n\n-Independents 26 Seats\n\nThree Regions:\n\n-Haiti [Ayiti, Haïti, Haití]\n\n-Capital: Pôrto-ax-Croz [Port-aux-Croix, Puerto Cruces]\n\n-Cibao-Ozama [Sipô-Tsema, Cibao-Ozama, Cibao-Ozama]\n\n-Capital: Sén Domengo dô Gôsmano [Saint Domingue de Guzmán, Santo Domingo de Guzmán]\n\n-Seybo [Syépo, Seybe, Seibo]\n\n-Capital: Sén Syéco déx Cavalyes [Saint Jacques des Chevaliers, Santiago de los Caballeros]\n\nConstituent States:\n\nFree State of Puerto Rico [Éta Libera dô Pôrto Rico, État Indépendant de Porto Rico, Estado Libre de Puerto Rico]\n\nGovernorate of Jamaica [Gôbernorato Jamayiko, Gouvernorat de Jamaïque, Gobernación de Jamaica]\n\nOther Important Cities:\n\nYacima [Jacmel, Yáquimo]\n\nCapa Ayitia [Cap-Haïtien, Cabo Haitiano]\n\nGônayiv [Gonaïves, Gonaíf]\n\nLécayls [Les Cays, Los Cayos]\n\nSén Fili dô Pôrto Palato [Saint Philippe de Port Plat, San Felipe de Puerto Plata]\n\nConsepsyon dô Prasy [Conception du Pré, Concepción de La Vega]\n\nRômana [La Romana, La Romana]\n\nPonxé [Poncé, Ponce]\n\nSén Iyan Batiso [Saint Jean-Baptiste, San Juan Bautista]\n\nGenvia [Gensville, Ciudad de la Gente]\n\nBaya Montega [Baie Montego, Bahía Montego]\n\nCurrency: Haitian Ile [Éla Ayitia, Aile Haïtienne, Ala Haitiano]\n\nGovernment: Dominant-Party Federal Republic\n\nHistory:\n\nDuring the early 20th century, in the Dominican Republic, there lived a monster. This monster brought stability and prosperity to the Dominicans, but at the ultimate price. To maintain his ultimate, absolute power, he seized their freedoms and spilled their blood. The sole man in power at the top of the Republic, this monster was likened to a Dominican God-equivalent on earth. The entire Republic was his playground, he could mold it however he liked. He welcomed immigrants through an open-door into his silent, absolute utopia, while shunning and massacring the inhabitants of his western neighbor, Haiti. He crafted alongside his Dominican state a terrifying, hyper-elitist ideology against the Haitians. His unique racial policy sought to entirely whiten the republic by shaming black Dominicans and painting an Afro-Haitian enemy. Dissenters to his empire existed, but then they didn&#8217;t. His omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient Military Intelligence Service imprisoned and executed its way down the monster&#8217;s personal hit-list throughout the entirety of the Republic. His intense lust for power, affinity for control, and impatience for failure allowed him to extract every ounce of efficiency and production from the Republic, and his comfortable position over all other Dominicans seemed secure, eternal even.\n\nThat is, until May 30th, 1961, when the military strongman with an iron grip over all the Dominican Republic, Rafael Leónidas &#8220;El Jefe&#8221; Trujillo Molina, was ambushed, shot, and killed outside his namesake capital, Ciudad Trujillo.\n\nThe remnants of the Trujillo regime were able to mount an effective response to the assassination, capturing and executing all but one of the conspirators who murdered Trujillo. Of the seven assassins, Antonio Imbert Barrera was the sole one able to escape, fleeing west to the hills near Haiti. With chaos and instability following the fall of Trujillo, his successor government was hard-pressed to chase Barrera. Instead, the new Dominican government under Trujillo&#8217;s handpicked president, Joaquín Antonio Balaguer Ricardo, attempted to liberalize and democraticize the Republic, taking small steps at easing Trujillo&#8217;s absolute control over the media and granting some token civil liberties alongside Trujillo&#8217;s son and direct successor, Rafael Leónidas Trujillo Martínez. The joint Trujillo-Balaguer reforms were promising, and were projected to bring Dominicans to an era of even greater prosperity coupled with real liberties. Unfortunately, this period of reform was abruptly curtailed by the sudden and violent return of the sole survivor of the group that killed the elder Trujillo, Imbert.\n\nWhile under the radar directly after the assassination of Trujillo, Imbert immediately fled westwards to the southwestern mountains of the Republic, through San Cristobal to Azua then to Las Matas de Farfán. While Balaguer from Ciudad Trujillo, now renamed to the original Santo Domingo, tried to restore order and stability to the Republic while slowly implementing his own reform, General Imbert was meeting in the western city of Sabaneta with officials from the Dominican Revolutionary Party, the National Civil Union, and the Dominican Popular Movement, all opposition parties still repressed and shunned by the national government. They were meeting to form a coalition to attempt a coup d'état against the Balaguer regime. In this period of post-Trujillo instability, the various opposition groups had an opportunity to catch their breaths, arm, and organize against Santo Domingo. And at their nominal head was placed Imbert. For a year after the assassination, Imbert and the new coalition, now termed the National Revolutionary Front, armed and trained some ~6,000 dissident forces in preparation for a complete takeover of the Dominican Republic.\n\nAnd on August 5th, 1962, the Popular Army of the National Revolutionary Front made its first strike. A two-pronged assault, the Front assaulted and rapidly seized the cities of Santiago de los Caballeros and San Juan de la Maguana, north and south of their mountainous training camps respectively. Within a month, the entire western half of the Republic had been captured by the Popular Army. The as-of-yet unorganized, broken Army of the Dominican Republic, a mere 5,000 strong, was powerless to stop the lightning-fast assault, and instead moved to defensive positioning from the capital of Santo Domingo in the south to the city of Nagua in the north. They waited with bated breath as Santo Domingo was evacuated, leading politicians fleeing quickly east to a new temporary capital at La Romana.\n\nThen, on September 24th, in the hills just west of Santo Domingo, the two forces collided. With 4,162 guerrilla fighters of the Popular Army pitted against 3,028 regulars from the Dominican Army, the Battle of Santo Domingo was the largest and bloodiest battle to ever take place on the island of Hispaniola. From the 7,190 soldiers on both sides that entered the battle, 683 were killed and 3144 were wounded by the battle&#8217;s termination on the 27th caused by the retreat of the Popular Army. While the southern armies licked their wounds and prepared for another engagement, in the north, the Popular Army found considerable more success, seizing the city of La Vega then breaching the Dominican Army lines a few miles south of Nagua.\n\nWhile their armies were fighting with guns across eastern Hispaniola, the National Revolutionary Front and the Balaguer regime were fighting their own battles by slinging propaganda at each other. On August 19th, when the Popular Army had pacified the city of Puerto Plata and its inhabitants, the National Revolutionary Front declared to the world the formation and independence of the Dominican People&#8217;s Republic, as well as a state of civil war. Imbert was declared the new Republic&#8217;s temporary president. Meanwhile, from La Romana, Balaguer and Trujillo Martínez decried the savage communist rebels that they claimed sought only to bring terror and tyranny to the Dominican peoples. Despite the savagery of the physical conflict and the ideological nature of the verbal, however, the Dominican Civil War attracted little attention from the outside world.\n\nExcept, however, from a nation slightly west. A nation whose leader was a monster similar to that of the elder Trujillo, who ruled with an iron fist and with a superficially benevolent smile. A former doctor who now worked to bloody his people, this man was essentially the polar opposite of Trujillo. Their nations holding a traditional rivalry and conflict, this leader espoused a populist and black nationalist ideology, keeping his national peace with a blatant, terror-inspiring private police force. This monster was the President of Haiti, François &#8220;Papa Doc&#8221; Duvalier.\n\nDuvalier was the ultimate opportunist, within and out of Haiti. Immediately after hearing about the seizure of Santiago and San Juan, Duvalier ordered the mobilization and eastwards march of both the Haitian Armed Forces and his personal police force, the National Security Volunteer Militia, combined over 10,000 strong. By August 27th, he made a public speech to the Haitian peoples announcing his new effort to pacify and stabilize the situation in the Dominican Republic. He called the spiraling chaos of the Dominican Civil War a direct threat to peace and prosperity in Haiti and declared the immediate impending invasion of the Dominican Republic by Haitian forces.\n\nOstensibly, the Haitian occupation of the Dominican Republic was for peacekeeping and stabilizing efforts. But those in the inner circle &#8212; Duvalier, the heads of the NSVM Clément Barbot and Luckner Cambronne, head of the Haitian Army General Paul Blassou, and diplomat Jean Price-Mars&#8212; knew the real reason for the occupation. This was a military endeavor that would seek to take full advantage of the Dominican chaos and right decades of perceived Dominican injustices against the Haitians and restore the century-old control by Haiti of the entire isle of Hispaniola. It was a war to annex the Dominican Republic and bring all of Hispaniola under the rule of Duvalier. It was to be called Operation Friendly Neighbor.\n\nBy September 1st, 10,267 Haitian soldiers and paramilitary members had stormed in full force across the Dominican border, crashing straight into the proclaimed Dominican People&#8217;s Republic. Within a week, San Juan and Santiago, the sites of the first battles of the Dominican Civil War, had been captured by Haiti. The Siege of Puerto Plata started on September 10th by a small force from the NSVM while the remainder of the Haitian troops continued their drive east, pushing the Popular Army again to Santo Domingo. This time, the city was deserted, the Dominican Army having evacuated their capital in the face of the Haitian invasion. By September 12th, the city was captured. The sheer speed and surprise of the siege led to the capture of President Imbert as well as other NRF leaders, who were rapidly shipped to house arrest in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince. On September 18th, the Haitian forces marched straight into an empty Santo Domingo and pressed onwards towards La Romana.\n\nOn September 21st, northern Haitian forces met the scattered remnants of the Popular Army at the Samaná Peninsula, where the NRF hoped to regroup and strike the Haitians from behind. The battle of Las Terrenas was short and relatively bloodless, as the Popular Army realized their infinitesimally low chances and surrendered relatively early on. The remainder of the Popular Army was, unlike their leaders, shoved into hastily constructed, poorly maintained, but well-policed temporary POW camps set up around Santiago.\n\nFurther south, the main Haitian forces continued their drive east towards the temporary Dominican government. They arrived at the gates of La Romana by September 24th, and forced the remaining Dominican forces to make a last-ditch defense. The Battle of Romana pitted 6,174 Haitian regular and irregular forces against 2,179 exhausted, battle-scarred Dominicans. Despite the best efforts of the Dominican defenders, who admirably held back the massive Haitian force for three days, by noontime on the 28th, the Haitians had broken through the Dominican lines and completely routed the defense force. This time, by direct order from Duvalier through General Blassou, the Haitian forces took few prisoners. Instead, they massacred in cold blood the remaining Dominican troops as a show of force and dominance, then marched into the temporary Dominican capital unopposed. Balaguer and the younger Trujillo were captured and sent to Port-au-Prince. By the time they arrived, an instrument of surrender was already being drafted.\n\nIt was October 1st, 1962. The leaders from both the Dominican Republic and the Dominican People&#8217;s Republic, namely Balaguer, Trujillo Martínez, and Imbert, were staying under house arrest in Port-au-Prince nominal trials. 7:00 AM the next day, President Duvalier personally handed the instrument of Dominican surrender and papers detailing the Haitian incorporation of the Dominican Republic to Balaguer, who was powerless to refuse. He signed by noon the same day, and the unification of Hispaniola was announced by Duvalier at 3:00 PM. The next day, a sham court immediately sentenced Balaguer, Trujillo Martínez, and Imbert to life in prison for being former enemies of Haiti by being members of Dominican political leadership. Twelve lesser Dominican political leaders from both the Republic and the NRF were sentenced to death. The rise of Haiti had begun.\n\nTo counteract Trujillo&#8217;s antihaitianism and black shame policies, Duvalier instituted a harsh and rapid program of négritude, to bring black pride and superiority to the Haitian peoples. In the former Dominican Republic, his National Security Volunteer Militia mounted sporadic raids and retributive attacks against white Dominicans, mirroring Trujillo&#8217;s Parsley Massacre of border Haitians. The NSVM also conducted a series of sham trials in major Dominican cities, selecting random citizens, trying them for treason against the Haitian state and peoples, and executing them. Through these methods, as well as using the NSVM to police the Dominican territories through day and night, Duvalier was able to effectively pacify and neutralize his new conquests.\n\nTo administer the former lands and peoples of the Dominican Republic, Duvalier made the simplest, but perhaps not the best choice. He immediately incorporated the former Republic into the Republic of Haiti, dispensing with suggestions of federation and provincialism and turning Haiti in a unitarian state. His intention was to centralize power in Port-au-Prince and in himself. Along with streamlining his bureaucracy, Duvalier trimmed down the Dominican legislative and judicial systems that had been implemented by Balaguer and Trujillo Martínez. To make sure these plans went smoothly and that any ideas of dissent did not form in the former Dominican territories, Duvalier had the NSVM operate almost exclusively from Santo Domingo to give him a secret eye with which to observe Dominican happenstances.\n\nMaps:\n\nSpoiler :\n\nThe Republic proper.\n\nSpoiler :\n\nThe Free State of Puerto Rico.\n\nSpoiler :\n\nGovernorate of Jamaica.\n\nPottslyvania​\n\nCapital: Riga\n\nGovernment: Presidential Dictatorship\n\nFurchtlose Anführer (Fearless Leader): Elsa Pott\n\nOfficial Language: German\n\nCurrency: Reichmark\n\nMotto: Meine Ehre heißt Treue (My Honor is Loyalty)\n\nNational Anthem: Ride of the Valkyries (1984-present) Horst-Wessel-Lied (1941-1984)\n\nSuper policy: Superpowered humans are allowed to live their lives as normal citizens (Elsa: Why the hell would we forcefully conscript them?

Even the name of the nation itself is derived from Pott. It was through their dedication that the nation rose, prospered, rebirthed, and now stand at the crossroads of glory.\n\nOn the 9th of October, 1944, advancing Soviet troops descended against German troops, cutting them off from Berlin and the rest of the Reich's resources. This encirclement, which resulted in over 200,000 cut off, was dubbed the Courland Pocket. One soldier was SS-Schütze Hermann Pott.\n\nThe origins of how this then-young man joined the SS and found his way into the war is to this day a mysteriously. No records survive of what unit he was attached to nor has any birth certificate of Hermann been found. There isn't even any evidence of foul play involved; it's as-if the man suddenly just materialized, ready to change the fate of the war itself.\n\nOn the 15th, the Soviets commenced a heavy barrage on the city of Riga before launching an assault on the Latvian capital. Gun crewed reported an unusually high amount of mechanical failures during the bombardment; seemingly fine parts would instantaneously break down and be unusable, and one crew reported that their gun's shell exploded inside the barrel. Thankfully for them, no one was killed, but it was the first sign of the unusual powers of Hermann Pott.\n\nHermann Pott extended an aura around himself. In this aura, the laws of physics selectively broke down, always towards the advantage of Pott himself. How this power worked was very inconsistent; no one was to pinpoint any sort of consistent input to output. It simply just worked, without explanation.\n\nNot even Hermann could prevent the fall of Riga, however. He achieved notoriety on both sides when he destroyed a stone bridge filled with charging Soviets with one shot with his Luger. The Soviet brigade all fell into the out-of-seasonly cold water, dying of hypothermia. Yet, the Soviet numbers were too large and the defenses too hasty. The Germans fled the city and set up defenses along the Courland peninsula, hoping to hold out there.\n\nHowever, Pott would truly gain his fame during the second battle of the pocket. In the morning of the 27th, a small fireteam of Soviet snipers was pinning a German foward recon in the woods. Defying his squad leader, Hermann Pott decided to set out by himself to get the pinned soldiers to safety. When one sniper saw Pott walking towards their prey with no cover whatsoever, she smirked with confidence that she was about to land an easy kill.\n\nHowever, the bullet barely missed Pott's head, ricocheting off a nearby tree. The bullet hit the tree at a perfect angle and trajectory, and in fact sped toward's the Sniper's head. She screamed into the forest as she inadvertently headshotted herself. A second sniper took aim at Pott, and a few seconds later suffered the same fate. One last sniper, unfazed by the death of her companions, decided to take the shot, but only when Pott was far away from any tree. However, in an event which defied all common sense, an anvil fell from the heavens and crushed the sniper's head before she was able to take the shot. The remaining snipers decided to all flee.\n\nA few days later, over 50 soviet divisions were assaulting the German defenses. Some of the assault targeted the garrison that Pott was stationed at. With only an idle Panzer IV (named \"Hochmeister\")and a few MGs as any sort of heavy ordinance, Pott had an idea. He jumped on the tank and demanded the tank charge straight at the Soviets. Everyone inside the tank questioned his judgement, but for whatever reason, the driver decided to charge at the rest of the crew's protests.\n\nAs a crazy man riding on top of a Panzer in the middle of a battle with just a pistol, the Soviet soldiers naturally decided to shoot at Pott. However, no matter how much mosins were aimed at the man, nothing ever seemed to actually hit Pott. However, his Luger was deadly accurate, and the crew of the Hochmeister joined in in a barrage of communist killing lead.\n\nZis-guns were mobilized to take out the Hochmeister directly. When a barrage of the anti-tank guns fired at the Panzer IV, the shells either curved to miss the mechanical beast, or in a few cases, collided with the tank's rear armor.... and simply refused to explode. NOTHING could kill either Pott nor the tank, and eventually the Soviets in that sector decided to retreat rather than get annihilated. Pott and the entire crew of the Hochmeister received would later recieve Iron Crosses for gallantry displayed during this charge (The Hochmeister would eventually meet its fate after being transferred to the Western Front: strafed by a P57-Mustang)\n\nThis successful charge inspired the massively outnumbered (10:1) Germans to continue to hold on and do a general offensive against the Soviets. Despite all odds, a spearhead, which Pott was a member of, managed to break through the pocket and route the Soviet siegers. While the Courland Pocket was still isolated from the rest of the Wehrmacht, they gained significant territory.\n\nIn early 1945 Von Fertig launched his coup against Hitler and the Nazi command. The new Furher was unsure of the loyalty of the Courland Pocket, and thus sent some of his agents to perform mini-coup against the command there. However, Hermann Pott took his oath of loyalty to Hitler first very seriously. Upon news of this coup, he deserted his unit and marched straight towards the new \"command\". Declaring that he was \"Treu bis zum Ende\" (Loyal until the end), he summarily executed his agents and declared he was the new leader of the forces in the Courland Pocket.\n\nFighting both the Soviets and Von Fertig's forces, Pott encouraged and helped create the means of Hitler loyalists to the Ostland Reichskommissariat, which by this point was less of a pocket and more of a new base of operations. During this time, the territory of the Ostland troops grew to cover estensially all of the Baltics, along with parts of Eastern Prussia.\n\nAfter the fall of Von Fertig, there was a split between the Allied command of what to do with Pott and Ostland. Stalin wanted to crush the Nazi pretender, while the Western Allies were more cautious thanks to respecting his superpowers more than the Soviets did. During this time, Pott reformed the Reichskommissariat into a full fledged new nation, and started to position himself both powers in the growing Cold War.\n\nIn 1946, captured Nazi leaders in Germany were, with all the Allied powers backing, supposed to go on trial in Nuremberg for crimes against humanity. However, the night before the trials were to begin, Ostlandish Brandenburgers broke into the complex. Every single inmate was released, except for those pivotal to the Von Fertig's coup. Instead, they were left in their cells, with bullets in their heads. Those liberated were welcomed to Ostland with immediate citizenship and asylum. A plan to recapture them by the Allies never came through due to a collapse of trust between the Soviets and the West over who was to blame for the breakout.\n\nWith every defendant missing or dead, the trials were \"indefinitely postponed\". At the time, no one knew who actually committed the breakout, although the Ostland government was certainly the prime suspect, for obvious reasons. Actual evidence implicating Pott and the Brandenburgers was made public after Hermann's death.\n\nTo be continued\n\nResources:\n\nSpoiler size :\n\nAmerican Politcal Cartoon, 1947, urging for the continuation of the war against Hermann Pott. Despite outrage against the exiled state, no military action was ever performed by either side post-1946.\n\nA still from a 50's politcal satire against \"Pottslyvania\" and the Fearless Leader. Decepited is his then-recent change of uniform from the Nazi /feldgrau to a more historically-traditional prussian blue (a change which is still kept in Pottslyvania to this day with Elsa's uniform). The skull and crossbones are simply the artist's invention, however. Also the monocle is on the wrong eye in this particular scene, which was simply an artist error.\n\nAttachments\n\nmust keep on rolling ahead.png\n\nName: Fascist Bulgaria.\n\nFlag:\n\nMotto: War, war never changes.\n\nDescription:\n\nIn 681, migrating from the Ukrainian steppes in the east as they were chased by Khazars, the Bulgar tribes have split in six. Many have perished, for one or another reason. But one brother, Asparuh succeeded in creating a state that lived through the centuries.\n\nBulgaria.\n\nA state plagued by neverending troubles - enslavement, treachery, incompetence... but yet, kept on going around. In one or another form.\n\nThe Soviets won. The Red Army crossed the Danube and installed a puppet Communist government. The Party. Sadly, they were also very very bad at managing economics. Certain far-right elements that have managed to escape before they got shot for not being commies started planning things. They were bidding their time...\n\nIn the meantime, Bulgarian insurgents and \"troublesome folk\" as secret documents called them, were sent off with trains into Soviet laboratories...it is speculated that many of them didn't live..or were changed. Their origins are unclear, but it's widely speculated that Iron Ion is one of these men.\n\nIn 1978, the chance arose - some trouble in Siberia or Poland, which meant that the Soviets couldn't expended military support to the Party. A mysterious man, known by rumours as the Iron Ion was leading them. He had a power; the power of magnetism...ironically enough, both in personality and in physics.\n\nWhile the Soviets did indeed retaliate in 1980, economic troubles made their armies inefficient. They still however would be a great adversary, was it not for the Iron Ion's powers that deflected shells right back at them. The great battle of Bucharest solved it all once and for all. And this began a road towards greatness that Bulgaria is still walking on...\n\nBut after that, Bulgaria was alone. No friends. And the Soviets were angry for the loss of a once-loyal satellite such as Bulgaria. They weren't hesitating to use the Netryonov, a superhero harnessing the power of the Atom. Such a threat would show that traitors don't escape, no matter what.\n\nAn unexpected ally from the West however supported the independence, regardless of their politics that reminded that of The Party in certain aspects. But politics knows no friends, only interests...and an unfriendly to the Soviets state, even if a bit, well, radical, was all good in their book. Considering the strategic position of Bulgaria that protected if partially Turkey and Greece, other allies or at least hostile to the Soviets nations, it meant that the independence was guaranteed.\n\nThe sad state known as the Soviet Union collapsed, carted off to the history's trash bin full of failures. It was a prosperous time; economy boomed, people were happy..those who respected and venerated the rulers of Bulgaria, of course. Those who didn't, they fared slightly less than the general populace as they worked to construct the glorious future that We envision.\n\nAll good things must come to an end, however. That end swiftly came in 2016 as the heavens opened up and the aliens came. It was not until 2017 that the alien forces invaded Bulgaria, as it probably was deemed irrelevant in comparison to giants like Germany or Russia or USA. However, in 2017, through Varna and Burgas the aliens came. It was a blood bath, as the navy was sank trivially, and the garrisons were quickly overwhelmed. A decision was made: a military junta ruled by Iron Ion will rule indefinitely as long as the Invasion lasts.\n\nHis only order for the entire duration of his rule, was:\n\n\"Men and women of Bulgaria. Pick all weapons available for a final stand in Sofia.\n\nAll superheroes of Bulgarian origin, scattered across the globe! I make one final plea: come to Sofia and fight for your motherland!\n\n-Iron Ion.\"\n\nHow many did flock to Sofia, it is unknown. How many fled - neither. The battle was epic, the Bulgarian defenders fought well... but then a missile hit the dome of St. Alexander Nevski, from which the Iron Ion used his forces. He disappeared into the rubble, and chaos broke loose among the lines. A superhero who was assumed to be his second-in-command issued the order to retreat.\n\nA brutal guerrila fight had just began. In the town of Smolyan, high in the Rhodope Mountains the government, or what remained of it, sought rescue. It was thought that the terrain would make it easier. It did not, and it only provided the benefit of seeing the enemies coming from all directions. It was dire. In 2021, the final and desparate battle for Bulgaria had started.\n\nIt was epic. Superheroes, thought to be dead, or working for different governments or organisations, that had nothing in common but one thing: that they were Bulgarian, and that they were defending the homeland, fought hard. It was a hard-won victory. The wrecks of various crafts still remain.\n\nBut in the end, the Invasion ceased, for at least a bit, in Bulgaria. And that was enough, as we all know what happened - a coalition of superheroes, including some of the ones in the Battle of Smolyan, in a last-ditch effort attacked the Mothership. Their victory was the end.\n\nBulgaria however, from Thessaloniki to Burgas was a wreck. Sofia was a pile of rubble. It was deemed that the new capital of the Fourth Bulgarian State would be Novo Vuzrajdane, built on the ruins of Veliko Turnovo, the old capital.\n\nWhat does the future hold...only God knows.\n\nSameinaða samveldi Vínlands og Fríríkið Íslands\n\nUnited Commonwealth of Vinland and the Icelandic Free State\n\nRépublique unie du Vinland et de l'État libre islandais\n\nSpoiler claims :\n\nCapital: Reykjavík (legislative and executive); St John's (judicial)\n\nGovernment: Federal parliamentary republic\n\n- President: Nicolas Olivier (Commonwealth Democrats)\n\n- Prime Minister: Erika Sigurðardóttir (Socialist Party of Iceland)\n\nOfficial languages: Icelandic, English, French\n\nRecognised regional languages: Faroese, Greenlandic, Inuktitut, Scots\n\nPopulation: 8,511,237\n\nCurrency: Íslensk króna\n\nHistory\n\nAfter centuries under Danish rule, Iceland declared its independence in 1944 and the Icelandic Free State was formed - a parliamentary republic built upon the democratic principles that had been the base of Icelandic government since the 10th century AD. This state consisted of three former Danish territories: Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands, aswell as Shetland which was formally ceded from the UK in 1968.\n\nBut the dreams of a bright future was crushed by the international disaster that came with the arrival of the Others. While most of the world fell into darkness, the Icelandic Free State was a beacon of light, of hope and democracy, and it became a safe haven for refugees from all over the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nA majority of these 'nýíslendingar' originated from eastern Canada and when Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and soon most of Canada slowly became a safer place to live again, many refugees and their families longed to move back to their old homeland. Thus began the Resettlement of Vinland, which expanded the Icelandic Free State into North America.\n\nBut the political power was still concentrated to Iceland which was seen as an unjust division of power by many Vinlanders, and the call for equal representation eventually lead to the transformation of the Icelandic Free State into the United Commonwealth of Vinland and the Icelandic Free State. The nation was divided into six semi-autonomous provinces, all with their own local governments operating under the federal government in Reykjavík.\n\nProvinces and administrative divisions\n\nThe United Commonwealth is a federation composed of six provinces: Iceland, Greenland, Shetland and the Faroe Islands, Vinland, Markland and Helluland. The provincial governments have a great deal of autonomy, holding exclusive power over areas such as education, taxation, healthcare, development and management of public land, and other matters of local nature.\n\nReykjavík is the Commonwealth's legislative and executive capital, as it is home to the Althing parliament and the federal government. The Commonwealth Court - the nation's highest judicial body - is situated in St John's, the capital of Vinland, and the city therefore serves as the judicial capital of the United Commonwealth.\n\nSpoiler provincial map :\n\nNote that while Vinland is one of three Commonwealth provinces in North America, Vinland is often used as a collective term for all three of them.\n\nGovernment and politics\n\nThe United Commonwealth of Vinland and the Icelandic Free State is a representative democracy and a federal parliamentary republic. The modern parliament, Alþingi (English: Althing), was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the Danish monarch. It was widely seen as a re-establishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the Old Commonwealth period and suspended in 1799. It currently has 129 members, elected for a maximum period of four years. The president is elected by popular vote for a term of four years, with no term limit. The elections for president, the Althing and the provincial government bodies are all held separately every four years.\n\nThe president of the United Commonwealth is a largely ceremonial head of state and serves as a diplomat, but can veto laws voted by the parliament and put them to a national referendum. The head of government is the prime minister who, together with the cabinet, is responsible for executive government. The cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the Althing; however, the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties, who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how its seats are to be distributed, under the condition that it has a majority support in the Althing. Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally.\n\nThe current president of the United Commonwealth is Nicolas Olivier of the Commonwealth Democrats, who has held the position since 2016. As a Markland citizen he is the first elected Vinlander president in the history of the Commonwealth.\n\nAs of the 2020 general elections, seven parties are currently represented in the Althing. They are listed below, along with their primary ideology/ideologies, their position on the left-right political spectrum, and whether they are unionist (in favour of the Commonwealth) or separatist (in favour of provincial independence). The United Commonwealth's current Prime Minister is Erika Sigurðardóttir of the Socialist Party of Iceland, who leads a coalition government with the Pan-Arctic Communist Alliance representing 59 seats (45,74%) in the Althing.\n\nPan-Arctic Communist Alliance - 17 seats (13,18%)\n\nCommunism, Arctic cooperation; Far-left; Unionist\n\nSósíalistaflokkurinn Íslands (Socialist Party of Iceland) - 42 seats (32,56%)\n\nDemocratic socialism, Eco-socialism; Left; Unionist\n\nPartii Inuit (Inuit Party) - 7 seats (5,42%)\n\nEco-socialism, Feminism, Greenlandic independence; Centre-left; Separatist\n\nParti de l'Indépendance vinlandais (Vinland Independence Party) - 14 seats (10,85%)\n\nSocial liberalism, Vinlandic independence, French-Canadian separatism; Centre-left; Separatist\n\nFramsóknarflokkurinn (Progressive Party) - 11 seats (8,53%)\n\nLiberalism, Agrarianism; Centre-right; Separatist\n\nCommonwealth Democrats - 34 seats (26,36%)\n\nLiberal conservatism, Economic liberalism; Centre-right; Unionist\n\nNorræna fólkaflokkurinn (Nordic People's Party) - 4 seats (3,1%)\n\nNeo-nazism, Norse nationalism; Far-right; Unionist\n\nSuperhumans and the Others in the United Commonwealth\n\nUnlike most other nations and organisations in the world, the United Commonwealth doesn't have an official stance on superhumanity, or even the alien conflict that shattered the world. Many of the refugees that came to be known as 'nýíslendingar' were almost exclusively regular humans who had no other choice but to flee, and to this day superhumans are a rare sight in the Commonwealth - they do exist but generally try to blend in. The overall attitude towards superhumans varies from neutral to slightly positive. Vinlanders however, especially those of French-Canadian origin, have a rather negative attitude towards them - a sentiment which dates back to when Le Baptiste and his companions left Markland.\n\nThe United Commonwealth also managed to stay out of any major clashes with the Others, which has led many native Icelanders to doubt that there ever even was any kind of alien invasion. There are other groups who suggest that the Icelandic Free State co-operated with the Others, and that it is the reason why they managed so well. Some of these conspiracy theorists also argue that the absence of Icelandic superhumans is due to them having been surrendered to the Others. However, such theories have no solid facts backing them up and are yet to be proven.\n\n(If anyone actually knows Icelandic, please tell me if I have made any linguistic errors anywhere.)\n\nCommonwealth of Australia\n\nGEOGRAPHY AND FLAG:\n\nSpoiler Flag :\n\nSpoiler Map :\n\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE:\n\nPrime Minister: Johnathan O&#8217;Neil &#8211; A highly charismatic politician that seems to have captured the hearts of the people, he played a significant role in the creation of the new Australian Government.\n\nPresident: Robertson Williams &#8211; An aging politician from before the war, he has a mostly ceremonial role in the government, just the way he likes it.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister: Ronald Henderson &#8211; The first Australian Aboriginal Deputy Prime Minister, he is very good at his job but he quarrels with Treasurer Weng over ideological matters constantly.\n\nTreasurer: Linda Weng &#8211; She is an ex-accountant who had kept the finances of Australia in superb order, her feeling of dislike of the Deputy Prime Minister is mutual.\n\nChief of the Armed Forces: Richard Swift &#8211; Australia&#8217;s answer to Nick Fury, he commands a great amount of respect as a talented commander and as a good friend of the Prime Minister.

She also is an ex-Olympic runner and is expected to carry the rations on long missions.\n\nTHE NATION:\n\nGovernment: Democratic Federation\n\nCurrency: Australian Dollar\n\nCapital: Canberra\n\nHistory: Australia&#8217;s history was almost identical to OTL up until the Revolution of 1968 in Britain. When King Edward VIII and his relatives fled to Australia they set up a government-in-exile which was supported by both America and Australia, who believed that Elizabeth&#8217;s Britain was treading dangerously close to Communism. This put Australia at odds with the United Kingdom for most of the Cold War.\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards, Australia became the base of operations for the Pacific for America and her allies. America based their ICBMs and advanced military technology there. The Australia also allegedly became a testing ground for experimental weaponry, with conspiracy theorists saying that Pine Gap was a superhero laboratory and that America had a hand in illegal cloning laboratories in New Zealand.\n\nThe Invasion changed everything. While Australia was not a priority target for the Others (known as &#8220;Steelheads&#8221; by the Australian populace due to their distinctive helmets) like all nations it suffered heavily. Federal Government collapsed, the State Governments barely functioned and the Australian Branch of the British Royal Family were exterminated. Although the war ended in victory for humanity, whatever brief unity that mankind experienced during the Invasion crumbled as soon as their foe was defeated.\n\nEnter Johnathan O&#8217;Neil. Johnathan was a charismatic politician who won a landslide victory in New South Wales and then proceeded to negotiate the reunification of Australia. In less than a year he had assembled a crack team of politicians, was incredibly popular around the country and had organized the reunification of Australia. By salvaging America&#8217;s remaining military equipment left in the region and thanks to the relative economic and social stability that O&#8217;Neil brought, Australia has managed to become a major world power.\n\nHowever, there is a dark secret about this young republic. A secret that if it was ever revealed would shake the very foundations of the nation. Will this grand nation overcome its dark secrets and came to the future? Or will the sins of the past bring down the future along with it?\n\nGovernment: Australia is organized almost identically how it was before the war. The Prime Minister is the head of state of the country, he appoints the cabinet and is the head of the ruling party. The President is appointed by the Prime Minister, he has the power to depose the Prime Minister however that is by convention never used. Other than that the role of President is purely ceremonial.\n\nThere are two houses, the lower house is called the House of Representatives and is elected via a preferential voting system with seats being divided with respect to population by an independent agency. The upper house is called the Senate, it consists of 76 senators, with 12 Senators representing each state except Indonesia (New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania) and 2 senators representing each territory (Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory). Senators are elected in a similar way to Members of Parliament.\n\nCurrently, over 80% of seats in both the Senate and the House of Representatives are owned by O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s United Commonwealth Party, with minor parties taking the rest of the seats. Barring exceptional circumstances, this is unlikely to change as O&#8217;Neil has a record 93% approval rating.\n\nMilitary: The United Commonwealth&#8217;s Military is divided into four branches, Army, Navy, Air Force and Advanced Warfare Branch. The first three branches act exactly how you would expect. AWB covers a lot of different areas, from the Australian Special Air Service (equivalent of the US Navy Seals, similar to the British SAS), R&D (especially in the areas of alien tech research and investigating the toys that the US left behind), Nuclear Rearmament and the Drone Division. Of particular interest in the National Extrahuman Response Organization (NERO). NERO consists of two squads (NERO-Alpha and NERO-Beta) of volunteer supers of high power. NERO squads consist of one agent specializing in combat (Striker), one agent specializing in reconnaissance and intelligence gathering (Recon) and one agent specializing in transportation of people and goods (Runner). NERO squads are trained to be the best of the best, specializing in delicate covert operations and as a counter to other supers. NERO also consists of a large team of brilliant auxiliary personnel such as scientists, doctors and engineers. They dedicate their careers to studying and supporting NERO Agents.\n\nTolerance of Supers: Although like all places around the world there are fringe hate groups that are intolerant of supers, the populace of Australia is by and large relatively tolerant towards supers. However, under the Superhuman Registration Act, supers must register their powers in a special Census. While some feel that this is an infringement on their right to privacy, it it is believed by many to have helped the general public more than it has hurt it.\n\nSuper vigilantism is treated as normal vigilantism under the eyes of the law, although as long as the aspiring hero doesn&#8217;t cause collateral damage the police often look the other way when it comes to their escapades. The Australian Government encourages supers who want to use their powers to fight injustice to join the military, emergency services or another role in society rather than running around in tights without proper training."
