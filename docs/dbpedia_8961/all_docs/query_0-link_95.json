        "text": "This essay analyzes the causes for the downfall of the Weimar Republic focusing on the years from 1929 to 1933. There are many theories that try to explain the fall of the Weimar Republic, but the two main causes that this paper discusses are whether it failed because of the flaws in its Constitution, or whether the Weimar Republic collapsed because of external circumstances and individual political choices. This essay is structured in a way, where there is firstly a brief introduction, then the two theories are presented individually and finally in the conclusion they are compared. In the end, It is concluded that even though some constitutional mistakes had a great impact in the collapse of the Weimar Republic, the main cause of its decay are external events and the political decisions made during the final years.\n\nThis essay will examine the jurisprudential aspects of the laws of Germany during the Third Reich. It will also seek to find the rationale behind the unprecedented trials at Nuremburg as well as put their significance into perspective. Germany's Political Landscape (pre-1933). At the end of the first World War, the German Empire underwent a revolution. Kaiser Wilhelm II and the then-ruling German princes abdicated their positions and responsibilities occasioning an end to the German, federal, constitutional monarchy. The monarchy was replaced with a democratic, parliamentary system. This later became known as the Weimar Republic.\n\nThe Weimar Republic was the coalition of political forces resulting from the post-Versailles compromise that became the mainstay of the new Republic. It came into effect on November 9, 1918 when Friedrich Ebert, leader of the Majority Social Democrats, succeeded Prince Maximilian of Baden as German Chancellor, formed a government of majority Socialists and Independent Socialists. The Weimar years are extremely crucial in our understanding and construction of German history. Weimar deserves proper analysis in its own standing and in terms of its own accomplishments and mistakes. This essay aims at understanding why the Weimar model, though heavenly praised, failed to deliver its promises. The paper argues that the Weimar Republic has been interpreted as a prelude to the Nazi epoch or as an interlude between imperial and Hitlerite Germany. In spite of reforms brought about, the downturn of the Weimar Republic was heavily influenced by the fallacy of Versailles, the economic disasters following the French occupation of the Ruhr (1923) and the subsequent rise of the National Socialist ideology. It follows that Weimar, as the heir of political liberalism of 1848 which, while inundated by the holocaust of the 1933 Nazi Revolution, is the area par excellence where the future development of a democratic Germany could be unveiled. The conclusion arrived at in this analysis suggests that the fourteen years of the Weimar Republic represents but a brief episode in a political history basically at variance with the trends current during these years. In other words, the success of post-Nazi Germany was mainly based on both the new ideological orientations and its experiences from the shortcomings of Weimar. The essay discusses the impacts of the Versailles Peace treaty, the constitutional \" imperialism, \" totalitarism, mass insurrections and economic disintegration, as evidenced by hyperinflation and unemployment."
