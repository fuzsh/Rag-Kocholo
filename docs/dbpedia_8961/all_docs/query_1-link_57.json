A-RDP81-00706R000200010034-9 Approved For Release 2004/0/,81-00706R000200010034-9 The GMDS (German Military Documents Section) collection has served ever increasing demands of various agencies. The huge mass of its material has presented a serious problem of control which cannot easily be solved. Its different parts are in varying stages of accessibility and completion, ranging all the way from unde- scribed deposits to quite well described and amply utilized holdings. The GMDS collection is a part of the DRB (Departmental Records Branch), Administrative Services Division, AGO, Department of the Army, and is located in the FRC (Federal Records Center) at King and Union Streets, Alexandria, Virginia. It contains primarily documents of the German Armed Forces of the years 1930 to the end of World War II. There are, however, other documents not in this category. Breakdown of GMDS collection: Total linear feet: 28,000 Not to be Total linear feet To be To be arranged or under control Arranged Indexed arranged indexed indexed 20,332 14,324 L+, 810 4,597 9,163 6,359 The total amount of German military documents in the GMDS collection covers roughly 28,000 linear feet. About two-thirds of the total collection (20,332 linear feet) is now under some sort of control. A priority category of GMDS records has been devised which consists of 17 different groups of records and comprises a little over one-half of the entire collection (about 15,400 linear feet). About one-third of this priority category (5,800 linear feet), however, will not be described by the DRB staff. The priority category consists of those parts of the collection which the DRB staff, from experience, has found to be most conspicuously valuable and most in demand by official re- search agencies. The staff's growing acquaintance with the records and the pattern of the inquiries directed toward the collection by researchers have thus contributed toward designing the priority category. By taking care of the priority category, a good control of about one-third of the entire collection (9,600 linear feet) would be established. CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release' 2004/07/08 : CIA-RDP81-00706R000200010034-9 Approved For Release 2004/07/08 : CIA-RDP81-00706R000200010034-9 CONFIDENTIAL This Research Aid describes the collection as a whole and its accessibility. The DRB staff, responsible for maintaining and indexing the collection, is continually improving control over the collection. The information found in this report may be considered valid as of April 1953; allowances must be made for the changes since that date. The report is divided into four chapters and an index (cf. Table of Contents). The Index contains: a) listings of GMDS record groups (German titles only) in alphabetical and numerical order, and b) listings of key intelligence items, in alphabetical order, emphasizing the U.S.S.R. and satellites. These references to key intelligence items make no pretense at being comprehensive and should be taken only as representative of much additional information contained to the GNDS collection. This report has been prepared by the CIA Library with the assistance of ORR, FDD and DRB. The CIA Library will welcome any suggestions or additions by the users of this publication for incorporation into a future edition.

Intelligence catalog. CONFIDENTIAL. \"In the summer of 1946 a systematic survey of the documents in GMDS containing information of intelligence interest was begun by G-2 Army. The responsibility for continuing this survey was transferred to the Foreign Documents Di- vision, CIA, in June 1947. The product of the survey was the Intelligence Catalog (IC) which consists of cards con- taining abstracts of documents having information con- sidered to be of intelligence interest. When the survey was completed over 10,000 individual IC cards has been pro- duced. \"For the most part, the IC cards contain reference to the USSR and its European satellite countries; however, the catalog does have many entries pertaining to other coun- tries. The Intelligence Catalog covers a wide range of subjects as will be seen from an examination of the Sub- ject Headings Page 16-19 below. Two sets of this catalog, arranged by area and subject, are available for reference, one at GMDS and the other in the CIA Library.\" Description of GMDS catalog extracted from Aid 23.

(Continued) IC covers only a minor part of the entire collection, but the material contained in it derives significance from the fact that it was selected material at the time when the IC was undertaken. The copy of. this catalog deposited at the DRB has not thus been expanded, for DRB has abandoned cross- indexing and is instead producing as many different cards for different documents as time permits. The attempt is being made to represent an ever increasing body of material by one card per document kept together in card indexes rep- resenting the established record groups at the DRB. At a later stage the reference to a particular document can be spread by means of further cross-indexing. Such cross- indexes as do exist at the DRB, are being incorporated with the more descriptive card indexes currently under construc- tion. 30. U.S. OFFICE OF MILITARY GOVERNMENT FOR GERMANY.

The Hitler minutes were originally a part of Record Group 1048 (cf. ibid, pages 61-63.) Total linear feet: 6 (arranged and indexed). Comment: From September 1942 to 22 April 1945, Hitler held daily conferences with his High Command on the military situation. A stenographic service was set up, on his order, at his headquarters. Eight stenographers were sworn in by Hitler himself. They were to take down the daily confer- ences in shorthand. In addition to the stenographers, two male and seven female typists were employed. One transcrip- tion was sent to Brigadier General Scherff (official historian of the High Command), one to the files of the Reich Chancellory in Berlin, and one was retained in Hitler's own files. The original stenographic notes were kept in the Reich Chancellory. In April 1945, Hitler ordered his stenographers to Berchtes- gaden with the original notes and the transcription copy from the Reich Chancellory files. An SS detachment brought these papers, early in May, to the woods near Hintersee, about five miles southwest of Berchtesgaden. They were hastily burnt in an open hole some twenty feet in diameter and three feet deer. Some of the papers were not completely destroyed and were later salvaged by the 101st Airborne Division. The charred remains which were recovered from the pit beyond Berchtes- gaden represent all that has survived of over 200,000 pages. These are the remains of 51 conferences, some complete or practically complete, some consisting merely of a few charred pieces of paper. The set of minutes of the con- ferences left in Berlin, in the German Army Archives, may be presumed to have been completely destroyed. The third set, which was in the custody of Brigadier General Scherff, was completely burnt. After World War II had ended, the stenographers were detained in Berchtesgaden and set to work reconstructing the charred remains. In the estimation of the stenographers, only one Approved For Release g / I IA-RDP81-00706R000200010034-9 Approved For Release 2004/OF%i& '81-00706R000200010034-9 5. HITLER MINUTES. (Continued) percent of the files was saved from the fire. Wherever possible, the stenographers attempted to fill in the gaps either from memory or by comparing their two different versions. Neither of the two. stenographers was allowed to correct his notes; discrepancies between the to versions were frequent. Since Hitler had previously placed Dr. Peschel in charge of making the original record, he continued as head of the group. The stenographers reconstructed the records in longhand, and then six typewritten transcripts of the reconstructed minutes were prepared. After the work had been completed, the original charred remains and four copies were turned over to a Document Team which, in turn, sent them to Wiesbaden for use in the Nuremberg trials. One copy was sent to the G-2 Section of the 101st Airborne Division. The fifth copy was retained as an appendix to interrogation reports conducted at Berchtesgaden.

The tables of which this Document 2 consists contain material which is copied (extracted) from the more comprehensive docu- ment 3. There are tables on iron and steel, copper, lead, zinc, nickel, chromium, antimony, bauxite, sulfur, mineral oil, other oils and various agricultural products (e.g. rye, wheat, corn, butter, eggs). These tables list: amounts of German 1937 consumption, German 1937 production, deficits, excess production of commodities listed in Greece, Jugoslavia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Hungary, Rumania, Czechoslovakia, amounts of this excess production sent to Germany in 1938 by these south eastern countries, and the remaining German deficits. In addition to the material also found in Document 3, Docu- ment 2 also lists comparative figures of increased demands for each of the commodities treated in the eventuality of an anticipated mobilization program (Mob-demand figures). - 78 - Approved For Relea4 IR/ .ZCIA-RDP81-00706R000200010034-9 Approved For Release 2004/077B 81-00706R000200010034-9 2. RECORD GROUP 1004. (Continued) Document 3 is entitled: Die rohstoffwirtschaftliche Bedeutung des Sudostraums fuer die deutsche Wehrwirtschaft Reichsamt fuer wehrwirtschaftliche Planung. Mdrz 1939. PP. 83 (a much more comprehensive mimeographed pamphlet than its extract, document 2). This is a detailed study of the production of south eastern countries with many tables, treating the commodities found in document 2 as well as many additional ones (e.g. coal, electric current, cellulose, textiles, cattle, etc.), arriving at definite conclusions about the degree to which various supplies from the southeast would fulfill German demands. We find in this report, as might be expected, lists and evaluations of the southeastern countries' production and consumption figures of the various metals, chemicals, textiles, agricultural products, etc. for 1937 and comparative production figures (1935 to 1937) of some of the commodities.
