Win32::Exe (or the archive management) seems to be broken. the output exe is corrupted.\n\nTODO: find a way to update icon and version info.\n\nthe resulting win32 (x64) binary is available in the repo for download:\n\ngcstar-1.7.1.exe\n\nthe binary depends on the 1.7.1 release tarball and must be placed in gcstar/bin folder.\n\nthe binary has been assembled using:"
