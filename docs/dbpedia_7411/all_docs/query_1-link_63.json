        "text": "The proliferation of computer technology and advent of Internet have created many new relationships and problems that raise questions about traditional legal and economic principles. The development of ‘open-source software’ is an example of this phenomenon. Open source software is one, where the source code is available and the user can modify the software to suit his needs. Though the open-source software industry has not completely replaced the conventional software industry, there has been a considerable invasion into its space. The entire discourse is centred around innovation and growth on the one hand and proprietary rights on the other.\n\nThe Life cycle for the expansion of traditional commercial software is well established and discussed in various research papers in detail. On the contrary, in case of Open Source Software (OSS),life cycle for the development is not being discussed in much detail since there exist no standardized life cycle approach for Open Source Software (OSS) development. Different researchers and developers have projected various life cycles for the development of OSS with respect to their own development experience, requirement or application. The popularity of the open source software development in the most recent decade, has brought about an increased interest from the industry on how to use open source components, participate in the open source community, develop business models around this type of software development, and learn more about open source development methodologies. The main focus of this paper is on reviewing the Open Source Software (OSS).\n\nSoftware has gained immense importance in our everyday lifeand is handling each and every aspect of today's technologicalworld. The idea of software at initial phase was implemented bya very precise minority of individual and now it's everywherewhether one's personal life or an organization .Financiallystrong organization and people who can purchase this bounty oftechnological era can fulfill their desires efficiently. For sure it's not a generalized case that one is financially strong and caneasily afford the desired software. There are numerous userswho cannot do so. Open source software has a way out for theseusers it provides them the same facilities and functionalities asin their equivalent software irrespective of any financialpressure. So the financially constrained personals ororganization can make use of open source software forachievement of their desired tasks. In this research paper ananalysis of open source software has been presented byproviding a brief comparison of Ubuntu as an emerging highquality open source modern operating system with well knownMicrosoft windows operating system\n\nOpen source Software is turning into the most remarkable \"emerging\" sensation of the entire Information Technology panorama, initiating a level of concern just like compared to the first juncture of the Internet. For a long-term the exact level oriented discussion has been whether open source is a remarkable conclusion than Proprietary Software. Today, it is not an inquiry of either/or, yet rather which is an ideal complement a certain endeavor demand. Today's open source vs. Proprietary Software headed discussions frequently fixate note on which model is much better, Instead, present day exchange fixates on what is open source or not. Nevertheless, even as we will demonstrate in this paper, the open source development, sensation is not verifiable new, in the past years, it has emerged with an essential enormous, which has authorized it to get into to the mainstream software marketplace. It furthermore encourages completely new strategies involving actions, which have been casting a system of corporations focused around open source programming development. In Spite Of among these facts, plenty of people suppose that Open source software is a momentary trend within the information technology sector. This paper aim to provide certain insights, suggestions, reference point, to ensure that users can surmise provided all this is actually absurdity or it procure advanced analysis additionally considers.\n\nThis chapter first considers free and open source software from a historical perspective, by examining how these terms came about and are still sometimes opposed to each other. It then describes how free and open source software “works,” that is, the collaborative and legal practices on which some of the most successful free and open source software projects rely. Then, it presents the mainstream adoption of free and open source software, and end by addressing some of the challenges this peer production model faces, in particular when related to tensions arising from its marketization as well as from participants’ lack of diversity."
