        "text": "From license plates and lunch boxes to movies and magazines: Ultimately, you can collect virtually anything. However, as time passes, particularly zealous collectors often lose track of which treasures their collection includes and which are still missing. To avoid this situation, you only need two things: Linux and the GCstar collection management tool.\n\nGCstar can be found in the repositories of most distributions and thus easily installed on your hard disk with just a few mouse clicks. If the distribution you are using does not include GCstar, you can find the source code for the program, including detailed installation instructions, on the website [1]. After completing the install, you can find the GCstar program and launcher under the Office submenu.\n\nWell Prepared\n\nWhen the software is first launched, it asks what kind of collection you want to manage. To do this, GCstar opens a selection list with a number of predefined collection types (Figure 1). If you cannot find your collection genre in the templates, you can design your own structure by pressing the New collection type button. Then, in an uncluttered window, you can create a matching database.\n\nAll predefined types already have an individual database structure, so you can just start typing. For example, you can add a Movies collection record to the system by enabling the existing template. GCstar points out, in a somewhat convoluted way, that you should respect the intellectual property rights of third parties and then displays two horizontal menu and button bars at the top of the screen with various management and navigation options.\n\nAfter pressing the + Add Movie button, you can enter the first movie. To let you do this, the software opens the existing database structure with the individual fields in the right panel of the program window, while the panel on the left shows you the movies you have already entered in a list view. To keep the view from becoming too confusing, the developers have divided the database into different categories. In the program window, these are represented by the tabs General, Details, Lending, and Tags.\n\nStart by entering the movie title in the General tab's input box containing New movie. Then, press the Fetch Information button on the right to search the Internet. GCstar queries several online databases for the title you entered and displays the result in another small window.\n\nAfter fetching the information from the chosen database, select one of the proposals and click OK to add the corresponding data to your database; if available, this information includes a synopsis and other relevant data, such as the release date, director, running time, and age rating where appropriate. If multiple editions of the same movie exist, you can use the preview feature to show the individual editions and then select the correct one (Figure 2).\n\nTo help you select an online source, GCstar offers a large number of international databases. You can access the selection menu by pressing the wrench or sliders icon (Set your preferences) in the toolbar. In the Preferences window, now select the Internet tab on the left and open the selection box Site to retrieve data from in the Data import section.\n\nIf you set the option Ask (All sites) here, the software provides you with a list of existing online databases when you access a movie title via the Fetch Information button. GCstar also displays the language, so you can easily choose the right source(s). If you want to make one of the data sources your default for Internet searches, just check the Use selected site for future searches box.\n\nAfter downloading the information, you can manually enter any missing information – such as the age rating, the genre, and the movie's country of origin. Once you have completed the data, save the database by pressing the floppy disk button (Save) and specifying the path and file name.\n\nAudio Tracks and Subtitles\n\nRecent movies produced abroad usually come with several audio tracks on the DVD or Blu-ray disk. Additionally, the disks often have subtitle tracks in addition to audio-synchronization in different languages. To record this data in the collection management tool, you need to enter the appropriate subtitle and language variants in GCstar.\n\nJust change to the Details tab in the program window and expand the Languages line. Then, you can enter the relevant data in the Audio and Subtitles fields. Similarly, you can make entries below Country and Genre in the General tab – many online databases do not provide this information. GCstar applies the data without having to press Save.\n\nPlay\n\nYou can link movie files on the hard disk or other storage media with GCstar and play them directly from within the software. To begin playing the movie in GCstar, change to the Details tab and press Select File to the right of the Video file input field. Then, select the desired video file in the file browser. Next, press the Play button on the right to view the movie. If nothing happens, you might have a problem with the configuration of your movie player software.\n\nBecause GCstar accesses third-party programs to play media, you need to link the movie player you use with the software. To do this, open the Preferences menu again and in the Paths tab select the entry Override default programs. Pressing the Set Programs button opens another window in which you define the corresponding viewers or players for each media type (Figure 3).\n\nSearching and Finding\n\nGCstar has a powerful search feature that lets you quickly find your way around large databases. In the program window, you will find a binoculars or magnifying glass icon in the toolbar; when clicked, this opens a window with extensive search options (Figure 4). Enter one or more search terms and parameters, then click the Find button below. In the main window, the program displays the results in a list view.\n\nTo keep the results list uncluttered in extensive collections, you will want to filter the search. To do this, click the Filter entry in the menubar of the main window. In the group you have chosen, enable the desired filter functions by pressing the radio buttons. The software uses a smart approach: In the Genre group, for example, it only shows you the genres that you defined when entering titles. In the Audience Age group, the program groups content with the age rating selected and lower.\n\nThe filters can be combined to narrow the search. You can also save searches for later reuse. In the Filter | Saved Searches menu, click Save Current Search to do this. Later, you can load the search in the same menu. Filter | Advanced Search lets you change some of the parameters. For example, for the age rating, you can stipulate that GCstar should only find records that exactly match a value or cover a specific time frame. You also can define, among other things, whether the search is case sensitive.\n\nGCstar also gives you the option of taking into account different parameter ranges for each criterion. Additionally, you can add your own definitions and, if necessary, delete search requests you no longer need.\n\nAdded Value\n\nFor audiovisual content in particular, a rating system is a major asset that lets you tag your personal preferences. This means that, even a long while after you have last played content, you can still see which movie, what photo, or what kind of music you liked in particular. To do this, GCstar includes its own rating scale from zero to ten stars in the Details tab, as well as a field for third-party reviews. You can also enter optional comments in a large text field.\n\nFor those movie fans who lend movie DVDs to their friends and acquaintances, GCstar also has the Lending tab, which lets you manage the corresponding media. It keeps a list of the \"rental\" media along with information about the borrower and the date to help you keep track of which disk is where.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe only shortcoming of the GCstar collection management tool that I noticed was that the software does not let you print out inventory lists, although you can export lists in various file formats. Otherwise, the program leaves little to be desired: It is fast and stable, properly localized, and has a logical superstructure, including meaningful categories. In particular, Linux users who have several different hobbies will definitely learn to appreciate GCstar, thanks to the numerous templates for various collection types."
