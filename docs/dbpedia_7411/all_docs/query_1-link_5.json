Focusing on Windows alone, it must be said that a setup wizard will help you install GCstar on your PC.

So to sum it up, GCstar has a user friendly and customizable interface.\n\nWhen you launch GCstar, it will invite you to select a collection type: board games collection, books collection, comics collection, computer software collection, and more. Say you have a movie collection – go ahead and pick the movies collection type. After that you will get access to a lot of handy features: manually add movies to the collection, have GCstar fetch movie info from the web, see who borrowed movies from you, pick a random movie to see tonight, and more.\n\nReleased under a GNU General Public License (GPL), GCstar is free and open source.\n\nEfficiently manage any type of collection with the free and open source application GCstar."
