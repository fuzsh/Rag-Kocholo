When I open the file, nothing is displayed and in the bottom left-hand corner the message changes to No events (capture disabled). Previously it had only said No events, even after the block occurred. I always shut down my computer at night (although I did leave it running the night before and nothing happened), so this morning I followed your instructions for restarting the Process Monitor and it's been running all day.\n\nOh yeah, you're right, I've only been using the app pass-through functionality, the protected folders were already in place. But I can't remove C:/Users/Tom/Videos from the protected folders because the Remove button is grayed out.\n\nLOVE&MERCY will show up in Personal Backup if it was present in C:/Users/Tom/Videos when Personal Backup was backing up (which it does every day). I keep a week worth of backups at a time.\n\nPlayOn Cloud Downloader is a daemon that runs on the PC in conjunction with the cloud-based PlayOn Cloud app. The app only runs on mobile devices, so I capture movies to the cloud using my iPad. The PlayOn Cloud Downloader then sees the movies in the cloud and downloads them to the PC, where I can watch them at my leisure. The copies on the cloud have a limited lifespan and eventually go away. I'm pretty sure I've never used the Downloader to access the movie LOVE&MERCY. Also, the Downloader never downloads folders, only MP4s.\n\nIf Bitdefender is active as your antivirus program then Windows Security/Controlled Folder Access is disabled.\n\nI uninstalled BitDefender so the only protection I have now is Windows Security. I also uninstalled PlayOn Downloader and Personal Backup. And the Remove button is still grayed out, I believe because C:\\Users\\Tom\\Videos is regarded as a System folder.\n\nDid you create this Shell Folder?\n\nNot that I was aware of.\n\nEdited by TomCunningham, 05 March 2022 - 06:12 PM.\n\nUnfortunately, starting tomorrow I will be away from my computer for the next couple of weeks. I'll still have email and Web access, but not from the laptop. I'll keep you posted, though, in case anything happens later today or tonight; otherwise, I'll ping you when I return."
