How do the web-site of the open-source project promote the businesses. I'd be very interested to know which projects are actually supported by their commercial backers, and how do they feel about each other?\n\nAre they run by a single company? Is there a commercial interest behind the project shared by several individuals or companies? Is the project purely fun-based?\n\nCMS / Publishing systems / Blog engines / wikis\n\nThis is a mix of platforms. Some stared out as Content Management Systems (CMS) others as wikis, yet others as blog engines. In the end there is a huge overlap between what they do so I put them in one category.\n\nHelp-desk, Request and Bug tracking\n\nMailing list\n\nWeb mail\n\nMonitoring\n\nLog analyzer\n\nGames\n\nDesktop Applications\n\nEnterprise applications\n\nE-commerce\n\nTools for Sysadmins\n\nTools for developers\n\nTools for Perl Developers\n\nSome more Perl projects\n\nThese projects probably should/could have their own site on their own domain:\n\nScientific Software\n\nDatabase related Applications\n\nOther\n\n(Still being categorized)\n\nNot Open Source\n\nThere are a number of non-open source Perl-based products. I am going to create a separate list of those too, for now let me list them here:"
