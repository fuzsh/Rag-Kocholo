It just needs about a days worth of time to put it all together.\n\nOther Hardware\n\ndriver for microsoft habu gaming mouse\n\ndriver for okiC5600 printer\n\nImprove Intel 965P Chipset detection, so that it doesn't detect a 965G (965P with integrated graphics). As of now, at booting, it fails to detect the 965P properly, which means booting fails and some kind of agp error appears (I guess it searches for the integrated graphics which isn't present).

DELL is making lots of money by selling computers pre-loaded with Ubuntu Linux while Canonical Ltd. could do the same and use the revenues to further support the Ubuntu project. It's a win/win deal. Mark Shuttleworth could make an investment with motherboard, graphic/audio card, printer, etc. makers (VIA, Intel, ATI, etc) so they build one robust system with open-source native Linux drivers (along with all the bells and whistles of native support) once and for all. Then Canonical Ltd. could market that system that would be flawless since it would have native drivers and it would have been tested. Not only would this make Ubuntu profitable for Canonical Ltd., but it would promote Ubuntu as the best end-user deal while encouraging a healthy competitive race with DELL and others. The Ubuntu promise would remain intact since it states that Ubuntu (the software) will always be free of charge. I hope you read this, Mr. Shuttleworth. francisco.padilla.garcia@gmail.com\n\nThe ability to execute/install .exe programs easier, such as Internet explorer and iTunes, without having to go through Wine etc.\n\nAuto detection of multiple seats would be a life saver. They wanted to give xorg.conf the axe with Ubuntu Hardy, and not having to use it to set up multiple seats would be wonderful. I have two gpu's, two plugged in mice, two plugged in keyboards, and two monitors of equal specs. It should be easy enough for a script to tell when there's enough hardware for x number of seats.\n\nIntegrating some sort of \"backup VGA or DVI drivers\" would be nice. I bricked my AGP graphics card and the whole X display couldn't start because there were no drivers loaded for the onboard one. Also, some sort of automatic drivers update on startup or shutdown, preferably the latter.\n\nI would like to have some kind of Software integrated that automatically installs windows drivers from their CDs, floppy disks\n\nSome kind of system performance tuning tool would be great. For example, after I installed Ubuntu I noticed that it was using some swap, even though there was plenty of free memory, so I added a line to rc.local that brought the \"swappiness\" down from 60, and it stopped using swap (and ran faster) after that. It seems to me that's the kind of thing that should be done out of the box, though. One of the boot scripts could read parameters from a configuration file and use them to set some system properties. I'm thinking mostly of hard drive spindown timeouts with hdparm and swap usage with /proc/sys/vm/swappiness, but I'm sure there are other useful options that could be set. A simple tool written in python started from the Administration menu could then show these options, and by default would be set for good performance (\"swappiness\" of 10 and hard drive spindowns after 15 minutes of inactivity, for example). --Donald Straney (burntfuseATgmail.com)\n\nIf swap space is disabled (ie, during partitioning for dual boot) and is lost from fstab, then the system can crunch on lower RAM machines. There does not appear to be any management on this (specific issue: having Azureus and Firefox running on a 256k machine). Perhaps the user should be warned/reminded that there is a problem when (a)there is a detected swap partition and (b)it is swapoff or not showing in fstab. Otherwise the user might be unaware that the swap space is disabled and wonder why the machine hangs.\n\nA LTSP solution that allows Diskless Clients and a Server to be load balanced -- JDnewbie\n\nAti remote wonder I&II is incomplete; if some people had time to fix it I would be grateful:\n\nPlay, pause, FF, RW eject cd-rom\n\nOk button isn't working\n\nDouble click work 1/5 times\n\nNumpad keys display: &é\"'(-è_çà\n\n(Tenshu_AT_gmail_DOT_com, Paris France)\n\nIntegrate the Win4Lin 9x patches into the kernel and have the mki-adapter module either in the base linux-image or linux-restricted-modules package. (I realize that this is a bit of a controversial subject given the DCC reversal on Win4Lin.)\n\nAn xbox 360 controller driver. It's a really nice controller and it would be great to be able to use it on ubuntu. Thanks.\n\nA program to map joystick/gamepad buttons and axis to keyboard buttons and mouse axis. Preferably with the ability to save profiles for different setups. (much like the Win32 program JoyToKey) This would allow the user to use a controller to play games that normally wouldn't accept a controller input. It would also be nice because it would enable disabled people to interact with the machine by using a controller in conjunction with the onscreen keyboard.\n\nMore motherboard-drivers, such as Asus ones. All persons that I know uses Asus products. But me, when I tested Ubuntu liveCD for the first time, couldn't connect to the internet because my LAN chipset wasn't integrated! So, if you want to help somebody, please search and integrate these drivers! (Note: I founded a VIA driver for Asus motherboard and I packed sources and read-me in an archive : http://vdliprj.ifrance.com/VIA.Rhine.Family.Fast.Ethernet.Adapter.4.22.tar.gz)\n\nTo make hardware work with Ubuntu, make an application that lists all the hardware that is currently compatible with Linux (and supported by Ubuntu). In this application, it will be possible to search for a device using hints such as hardware type, brand, etc... The app could contain links to vendor websites, etc... This way users will be sure their new device will be supported. Example: I want to buy a webcam, I open the application \"Choose New Hardware for Ubuntu\", I type \"webcam\" in the search box, a list of all supported webcams is displayed, I choose the Philips SuperCam 12, because I know it's good and it's supported by Ubuntu !! Then when I receive it, I plug it in, and it works right out of the box!!!! If Ubuntu becomes *really* popular, vendor really will want to be on this list so maybe they will start to contribute to make Linux Drivers !! This app could be web-based, something like http://hardware.ubuntu.com (like packages.ubuntu.com with the same type of interface but with compatible hardware devices search instead of packages search...) Forum discussion on this topic.\n\nDetect hardware in the installer and have a mapping from USB or PCI device numbers to driver packages, probably in the s-list and the deb-file itself. The installer would automatically install the drivers for the installed devices. When a new USB / Firewire / whatever device is hot-plugged and is unknown in the system, the installers pops-up and proposes to install the driver he finds in the database. --Johannes2\n\nUSB devices attached to computer should power off when it shuts down. I'm having this strange issue with wacom tablet and bluetooth dongle, that when computer turns off from Ubuntu they keep powered on with light on. This does not happen in Windows. xerman\n\nWhen detecting new hardware, show the user that it has been found and that the process of installing drivers is going to follow. If the repositories needed are not in \"sources.lst\", ask the user if he/she wants to add a new repository. This goes along with the possibility of having a text/html/xml file with any kind of repository available for Ubuntu (free, universe, multiverse, whatever). The user should be told what support exists for the repository that could be added. xerman\n\nDetect and configure 'Wacom USB graphics tablet', at least change the mouse driver to wacom when it is seen (usually on /dev/event2). Add cursor and eraser devices to the X config. The tablet is my only mousing device, it's inconvenient to set up as the core pointer when it's using the wrong driver by default and can't be moved. :P\n\nImprove hardware detection for ISA sound cards and USB devices such as scanners and printers. An out-of-the box full multimedia experience is critical to getting homes using this almost perfect OS.\n\nMake Ubuntu work smoothly with Apple Mini\n\nSet up many-mouse buttons (probably with imwheel); this is something users shouldn't have to battle with (it is still hard).\n\na lot of users want work with five muse buttons after instalation\n\nAn easy GUI that will allow me to upgrade from 32 bit to 64 bit without burning any CD's or anything of the like. Just click on a button and then come back in half an hour. -- Justin Emmanuel ( justinemmanuel@gmail.com )\n\nMore usable default mapping for mouse-button emulation on Apple computers. F11 and F12 are too far away from the trackpad to be used comfortably on Apple laptops for the third and second mouse buttons. The command (Apple) keys would make ideal second mouse buttons, and the small Enter key next to right-command could make a good third. It may also feel more natural if these buttons worked as modifiers to the main mouse-button, the way control does under OS X. -- Ben Hourigan\n\nDecent super-duper [FireWire - IEEE 1394 - iLink] support. Make support built-in/embedded so we can install & boot Ubuntu from external [FireWire - IEEE 1394 - iLink] drives!-- Fu Kay\n\nMake MiniDV on Ubuntu \"just work\". I plug in my consumer camcorder with a IEEE1394 cable, and Ubuntu notices and provides a desktop icon for the camcorder. Double-clicking the desktop icon launches a program to capture video from the camera -- the Kino program is an excellent GPL'd, GTK-based tool for this. The end user could then use Kino to edit the captured footage. To my knowledge, MiniDV is not protected by patents the way some other video formats are, so support for this could be added to all versions of Ubuntu.\n\nIntegrate prc5x webcam drivers into mainline\n\nCompletely merge gatos into x.org and make ATI All-In-Wonder card support out of the box. -- Reviczky Ádám János\n\nA central control panel for hardware configuration, where I can configure all of my hardware, tools like for example the KDE Control Center just DON'T do it all.\n\nOne of the biggest markets for Linux in the next year may be the Playstation 3 \"gaming console.\" The ground work for porting Linux to the Cell processor has been laid (and Sony has made its interest in Linux clear ([http://ps3.ign.com/articles/624/624046p1.html). Sony has sold 100 million PlayStations since the console was released in Japan in 1994, and 70 million PlayStation 2 units since it was introduced in 1999. The above suggests to me that with minimal effort Ubuntu and the PS3 could offer each other significant \"added value\" at next-to-zero cost. The market potential for the Linux disto that collaborates with Sony on this (or at least ensures PS3 compatibility) is enormous. -Alex Martinson\n\nThe ability to add .kmap files to the available keyboard set up list... I want to be able to use the Colemak keyboard set up, but I have to use terminal to enable and disable it, I would like to be able to change it just like I would change between QWERTY and Dvorak, or between languages... I think the default is just pressing both ALTS.\n\nAdd an 'OFF' setting to caps lock key behavior, and set it off by default with the colemak keyboard layout.\n\nExtend the mouse configuration possiblities, i.e. configurable extra mouse buttons, better and more speed/sensivity options and stuff like that.\n\nPrinters\n\nAs a new linux user, one of the more frustrating things I am dealing with is getting my printer to work. Perhaps using or creating something similar to Apple's Bonjour/Rendezvous to automatically detect compatible hardware on the system or local network and configure the drivers for that hardware with little or no input from the user? -ebeyer\n\nEpson X1190 printer and scanner support.\n\nLexmark x1250 printer and scanner support - a lot of peope want use scaner\n\ndrivers for okiC5600 printer.\n\nAdd a \"Print-to-PDF\" functionality / PDF-printer to the standard cups installation. In other words, Cups-PDF should come pre-installed. More about the currently very user-UNfriendly state of CUPS and PDF printing: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=188860\n\nPrinter setup on home networks with windows based machines. I'm a software developer and I don't know what a printer command line is (referring to the open office printer setup tool).\n\nSwitch to hplip for hp printer drivers\n\nLocal auto-detected printers that are obviously a fully supported model should be automagically added. The system knew I had an hp deskjet 940c plugged in already (the autodetect field said as much), why should I have to go through the new printer wizard? -- ChrisZS ([at] gmail [dot] com)\n\nReplacement of Gimp-Print with Gutenprint (the new name for Gimp-Print 5.0), this includes many enhancements and bug fixes for Epson users (and I'm sure it fixes issues with other printers). I believe its now in Debian Sid so backport possible? -- A-Wing (info [at] a-wing [dot] co [dot] uk)\n\nThere should be just one printing dialog all over the system. It should offer the following options:\n\nDestiny/whatever: PDF file, PS file, Direct to Printer\n\nPaper and Quality: Select paper size, select color-b/n, select dpi\n\nTwo sided printing (if allowed): long edge, short edge, off\n\nCopies: number of copies, pages to be printed, collated or not\n\nSave configuration: save selected configuration of all the standard options available.\n\nand an Application specific button: if I call the print file option from Evince, there should be an \"Evince\" button if Evince has printing options other than standard. Same for Gimp, Inkscape, OpenOffice. This would make printing from any program a standard task with a uniform interface, and having every program its tweaking options if needed. Programming printing dialog should be a lot easier (I think) too, as there would be a call to the printing dialog, and the specific directives would be accessed through the \"application specific button\". -- xerman\n\nPrinting should be more stable. I get printing from evince hanging the printer (HP CP1700d) the first page prints, then the second starts and it gets stuck while printing in the middle of the page, needing to cancel printing both on Ubuntu and the printer, and restarting printer. This has happened too with Evolution. -- xerman\n\n* Printer capabilities differ from app to app. Two sided printing is available at OpenOffice but not in Evince (HP Photosmart 3210 -just tested this 2 apps for printing) and this is a very weird issue. -- xerman\n\nColor-only mode is stupid & pointless. If someone wants to print in color, they will just colorize the text.\n\nPrintout mode is confusing, There shouldn't be 2 dropdowns for choosing resolution, one for \"printout mode\" and another printout mode (folder) > kcontrol > printer > printer (dropdown) configure.\n\nPS3 Xubuntu Hardy Heron - Quick Easy Project\n\nSystem Requirements Too High For Developing Countries\n\nThe system requirements for Ubuntu are too much for most under-developed countries, for instance my own - Zimbabwe. The majority of the people who own computers have either Pentium 1, 2 or 3 machines with an average of between 32 - 128MB RAM.\n\nTo run the Ubuntu live CD, one requires 256+MB RAM, while a standard Xp installation requires 64MB RAM. There is an option to set up swap space for additional memory but hard drives are quite limited in capacity, some people still use between 2 - 5gig. The version 7.04 of Ubuntu requires 4gig just for installation. So, a lot of people cannot experience Ubuntu even if they are willing.\n\nAlthough there is an option of the lighter weight Xubuntu system (which I have not used,) it is not available via shipit, and is very difficult to download as the connection in most households and offices is 54.0kbps (through dial-up modems).\n\nI am also not sure how to (if possible) install Ubuntu, without running the live CD since in the boot menu help the prerequisites are 128MB RAM. Please, if there is a way of installing Ubuntu without the live CD, let us know on the CD cover.\n\nI would like Ubuntu to be made more accessible to the people who have 'sub-standard' systems especially to the poorer people of society who cannot afford software.\n\nNorman Nhliziyo (normannhliziyo@yahoo.co.uk)\n\n\"If your system has less than 192 MB of system memory, use the Alternate Installation CD\" https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements#head-8555714d177f94573f4781dc81984a4a66b7361d when you download ubuntu click the checkbox at the bottom which says alternate installation cd. From what i understand this only requires 48mb of ram. I'm not sure if you can get the alternate cd's via shipit but i would think you can.\n\nLithium (cmaster2@hotmail.com)\n\nAvailable Resource Scalability\n\nNorman is correct and I'd like to add that the trend of bloating software, although to some degree justifiable, is both alarming and disgusting. Being able to run Ubuntu quickly and effectively on older hardware is useful to more than just those who can't afford a better machine.\n\nI propose that the applications included by default in the distribution be rated by RAM, CPU, and HDD usage, as well as by how necessary they are to accomplish the basic task they are related to (printing, web browsing, etc.). During installation on low-end machines a wizard could be called that would allow the user to select and deselect individual packages according to their resource ratings. A running tally of the estimated base RAM, HDD, and CPU requirements could be calculated as they choose packages. The user could also be offered several preselected choices of packages, each attuned to different RAM, CPU, and HDD specs.\n\nOther than simply having resource-minded package selection during installation, the user should also be given base package alternatives during installation. This could also be tied in to the previously-described wizard. Everything from the window manager to choice of web browser and word processing package could be chosen based on available resources.\n\nTo summarize, each package during installation gets a Yes, No, or Replace With option while showing a running tally of estimated hardware utilization, with multiple presets included for varying system specs in case the user isn't up to the task of manual selection.\n\nI don't think varying hardware specifications should necessarily merit the existence of a new distribution. A system like what I propose would eliminate that need and allow a much broader swath of the public to use Ubuntu with pleasing results. To further this goal even more developers could decide to make new releases of their applications \"resource aware,\" such that they could actually scale up or down the amount of resources they attempt to use based on what is available. Usually an application is programmed with imaginary hardware specs in mind and not much thought to how best to enable it to perform well on both low and high end machines, but this could be changed perhaps in some instances without a terrible amount of pain.\n\nKevin Fishburne (kevinfishburne@eightvirtues.com)\n\nXubuntu ShipIt Availability\n\nIt does sort of seem redundant that the people who need Xubuntu are the people with less powerful computers, yet they have to download it. Most people with slow computers also have slow internet connections. While I, personally, do not need it, many people are unable to use Ubuntu, and Xubuntu being available via ShipIt would probably help these people very much.\n\nPower button = sudo button\n\nlooking at my pc, i can see that the power button is plugged directly into the mobo... so, i'm assuming that pressing the power button gets the mobo to send a signal to the os?\n\nis that signal hard for software to fake? if so, it might be an idea to change the os's response to the signal from 'show power down options' to 'grant sudo to focused window/gksudo screen'\n\nin other words, so you could choose one of the following behaviours for sudoing:\n\n1/ type 'sudo blah' and enter password (current behaviour)\n\n2/ type 'sudo blah' and poke the sudo button (ie, the power button); good for slow typists, possibly more secure, and kinda cool imo\n\n3/ type 'sudo blah', poke the sudo button to give your account sudoer privileges for 30 seconds, then type in your password to give the program sudo rights; most secure option, requiring a trespasser to both discover your password and simulate a signal from the mobo.\n\nIf someone has enough control over a system to simulate a power button signal, they're the owner of the system. Period.\n\n:I'm not sure if that's a good idea... Currently, pressing the power button bring up the Shut down menu, which I find a very intuitive action. Also, this could bring trouble when using VNC and remote desktops - how would you then push the button, even if you had sudo-passwords? --~~~~\n\nFast startup\n\nA fast reboot option in Ubuntu, a restart as fast as resuming from hibernate. Maybe add two options in boot menu: 'Fast startup' and 'Reconfigure fast startup'. When you select 'Reconfigure fast startup', the system boots in normal mode, and at a specific position (e.g. at end of init or before desktop manager comes up), pause system and save data in RAM to hard disk (like hibernate). When you select 'Fast startup' system resumes from that file. If you have a fresh installed Ubuntu or hardware you need to reconfigure fast startup. -- arman.ordookhani.RemovemE@gmail.com\n\nFaster startup via special file placement\n\nA faster startup option: when system starts, just track all the files (or, better - the hard drive sectors) from which the system reads it's data (programs and data itself). I suggest, that their order in most of cases will be practically same. Then - make a special application which will reorder the files which system needs to bood in the very same order as they necessary to the system during boot - to make them be sequentally written piece-by-piece on the disk. example: if system requires 2 sectors from fileA, then 1 sector from fileB, then 4 sectors from fileC, than 5 sectors from (again) fileA - according the tracker, reorganize these sectors into one sequence - let on a hard drive track they occupy physical sectors as 2-fileA - 1-fileB - 4-fileC - 5-fileA. I.e, if two pieces of one file is read in different times, and there are other file between them - a file ougth to be fragmented - first piece, then another file, then second piece - in order to all this cortage be accessed faster. So, the system during startup will still access many files, but physically it will be one solid array of data on hard drive - i.e. sector-by-sector, head-by-head, track-by-track - no jumps or repositions. It may be called \"smart fragmentation\" or, \"logical defragmentation\". The effect of such reordering might follow the difference between the speed reading one solid big file and huge of small files randomly distributed on disk. -- a.n.vinogradov(AT)gmail.com\n\nStartup at Shutdown\n\nLet the user perform startup operations at shutdown and save an image of RAM. This can be done through a setting or during shutdown. When you shut down a computer you're not usually in a rush, but when booting you want the OS ready a minute ago. I don't know how to implement this exactly, but it seems pretty straightforward: instead of \"shutdown\" it would be \"silent-restart-and-hibernate-with-one-click\". I guess the kinks would have to be worked out. -- Noam Nelke, Israel. (NoamNelke(AT)gmail.com)\n\nHardware Compatibility\n\nHow-to List for Hardware that Does not Work Out of the Box\n\nDetect hardware (wireless cards, Lirc Devices, Video Cards, etc) that cannot have full functionality out of the box and show a list that links to the forum to install drivers for it. If there are multiple method of install, they should be voted on and ranked. This would reduce people's frustration with Linux. I just about went insane going through all the forums to install the hardware for MythTV. Ubuntu will never support every type of hardware out of the box: there isn't enough space even on DVD, and support for proprietary hardware is difficult.\n\nWith the 'out of the box' thing. It depends on what you think out of the box means. If ubuntu came with all the basic drivers (enough to the neccessary parts of pc work) and included lots of networking drivers it is possible that once it is installed it could automatically download the rest from repositories (this of course would depend on file sizes of drivers because noone wants to be downloading for three weeks before their pc will go that could happen with dial-up users).\n\nLithium (cmaster2@hotmail.com)\n\nCompatible Hardware List\n\n* A simple, printable list of current hardware fully supported by Linux. List hardware for which a free driver is included in a respected collection (e.g. the Linux kernel, the Gutenprint printer driver collection). Hardware which is no longer on general sale should be removed from the list. People could bring the list to a hardware shop, along with penguin \"Linux compatible\" stickers which the shop could stick on the product description signs. People would find Linux hardware easily and Linux would be visible to normal people. It may also spur the buying of Linux compatible hardware -- even Windows users may prefer the \"Linux-compatible\" feature to non-compatible.\n\n* On the website, list hardware that just works with the current version of Ubuntu so that system builders can save time by buying \"Ubuntu Friendly\" hardware. Hopefully, this will simplify the system building process to:\n\n# Order Parts from Ubuntu's (or an approved affiliate's) web site # Assemble Hardware # Install and configure Ubuntu with no headaches (hopefully in under an hour)\n\nHardware categories may include complete systems, motherboards, video cards and USB devices. This will establish an Ubuntu hardware brand similar to \"Intel Inside\" without making hardware. As soon as enough people ask, \"Is it Ubuntu Friendly?\", you'll have a viable hardware brand. (How many people is that? I don't know.) To help with this, create a client application that automatically (as much as possible) collects and submits hardware information to the Ubuntu web site and a server-side app that puts it all together to generate the list. You could sell these parts on the Ubuntu website or collect referral fees from approved affiliates for click-thru purchases. For partially friendly hardware, list incompatibilities and other gothcas more consistently than at other Linux hardware sites. -- pdirezze[at]rogers.com\n\n* I'm surprised that something like this hasn't been done already! I think a cross between a standard, category based list of hardware and a small wiki/comment section for each hardware piece would be a good start (and easier to make a client side app to autosubmit). Also, people could submit hardware lists of specific computers which would link to the relevant hardware pages in the database, and a computer page could summarise the compatibility status of its collective parts. I'd love to code or maintain/be part of a site such as this, but I wouldn't know how to begin making it official. Would a server be supplied? Could I pick the language? Is there a framework in place for Ubuntu sites already that must be used? - mark.goodall [at] gmail.com\n\nInstall(check)tool for Windows\n\n* An Ubuntu install(check) tool for Windows to check for hardware and show devices that run well and the devices what have no drivers on Linux.\n\nI agree. Just after I installed an Ubuntu-based distro (Freespire), I found out that my sound card was incompatible. This could be used to help people from making my mistake.\n\nI also agree, this tool could also be dos based, to boot a computer without an os installed and check if its hardware is supported, maybe an option in the loader of the live cd...\n\nClustering/Distributed Computing\n\nZgrid\n\nZgrid is the first distributed computing architecture to be built into a desktop or server operating system. Any individual or work group can quickly build a low-cost supercomputer. Scientists, animators and digital content creators can run a single job across multiple computers at once, without rewriting code. Sun Grid Engine (open source) and Globus Toolkit available to be exploit. Perhaps someday it will be the most powerful and efficient OS with grid engine ever. https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/zgrid\n\nOpenMosix\n\nIt would be a major bonus to have an implementation of the OpenMosix cluster on Ubuntu Server edition or, with most households now having multiple computers, provide an easy-to-use implementation for the average user. This feature could be another hat-trick to boost Ubuntu's booming popularity while rescuing the OpenMosix project. AFAIC I've seen it in action in Dynebolic Linux, and it's sweet. Now that I'm choosing a Linux distro to go enterprise level this would be a bonus.\n\nFrom an Intel article:\n\n:OpenMosix adds clustering abilities to the Linux* kernel that allow any standard Linux process to take advantage of a cluster's resources. By using adaptive load-balancing techniques, processes running on one node in the cluster can transparently \"migrate\" to another node where they can execute faster. Because openMosix is completely transparent to all running programs, the process that has been migrated doesn't even know (or need to know) that it's running on a remote system. As far as that remote process and other processes running on the original node (called the \"home node\") are concerned, the process is running locally.\n\n:This transparency of openMosix means that no special programming is required to take advantage of openMosix's load-balancing technology. In fact, a default openMosix installation will migrate processes to the \"best\" node automatically. This makes openMosix a clustering solution that can provide an immediate benefit for a wide variety of applications.\n\nWarbo: OpenMosix seems to be getting discontinued in 2008 due to the widespread availability of multi-core machines, making clustering less desirable. I think this section sould be removed when OpenMosix is officially abandoned.\n\nOrb: OpenMosix is indeed being abandoned, but I believe it should be adopted and slowly pushed towards the stock 2.6 kernel. Multi-core machines are growing popular, but so are faster networks (gigabit / 802.11n) and the number of computers per household. Multi-core systems are still costly and are not readily available to developing countries or underfunded research groups. At some point, a generic clustering solution will become necessary, and OpenMosix is a reasonable candidate.\n\nMobility\n\nThis section is about mobility platform solutions and will include mobile devices that use alternative connectivity technologies. This includes, Bluetooth, iRDA, and media card readers available in most laptops. The effort is to help Ubuntu perform on laptops right out of the box. -- BalajiRamasubramanian - Apr 5, 2007.\n\nSome way to adjust brightness, contrast, gamma. Right now I can use xgamma for gamma, but no way to adjust brightness and contrast. My laptop (HP zt3000) looks horrible without adjusting contrast, so much so that I am forced to go back to using Windows (feel pity on me!)\n\nTouchpads\n\nA gui interface for configuring the Synaptic driver for touchpads.\n\nA way to disable the touchpad temporarily after a key is pressed, to stop accidental touches while typing. This should probably be enabled by default for at least 0.5 seconds using syndaemon or made available as an option to enable from the Mouse preferences in the System -> Preferences menu. There is a touchpad tab already there, it could easily fit in as an extra option.\n\nSince Lifebook touchpads are supported by kernel psmouse module natively, the corresponding xorg driver (evtouch) should be in the distro --- at lest in universe, since its autoconfiguration is unlikely currently. It is packaged for Ubuntu by Soren Hansen already: http://www.warma.dk/ubuntu/. The lbtouch driver mentioned in the description is superseded by the psmouse module [Václav?milauer]\n\nMy IBM laptop has a fingerprint reader. It would be cool to be able to use that for sudo and the screensaver, ssh, etc. graphical PAM authentication configuration.. see relevant section for elaboration.\n\nTouchpad configuration for the ppc version. I couldn't configure the touchpad to tap to click or change acceleration.\n\nAlso it shoud be an option to disable your touchpad with a keyboard shortcut (like ctrl+super+D). If you use a mouse you don't need the touchpad anymore.\n\nBetter LaptopTesting pages\n\n* I think the wiki does not do the job for laptop testing pages. Instead, see my idea http://dallerweb.dk/ubuntu/LaptopBase/. How do we get a project like this authorized? I would hate to use several hundred hours on the project, if it was turned down. -- Daniel Skov Klejnstrup (daller) Email: danielklejnstrup@gmail.com\n\nSaïvann : This idea is VERY important, people need to know if their computers will work on Ubuntu. A lot of people will not try to install Ubuntu until they know that somebody else tried the same thing. It would help people know what works and what doesn't, what are the solutions, etc. And it would greatly help Canonical to have better priorities on what's working great and what's not working. This could be expanded not just to laptop but peripherals in general. -- mertiki@gmail.com\n\n* I like the site of UbuntuLaptopTest but we need something more organized where we don't repeat information. The wiki identifier can be based on Brand and Model laptop. For example http://site/WIKI/ACER_MODELXXX should show how to install Linux in that model, the just new created wiki pages can have a default template so people know exactly which info have to fill. Also I propose to have kind of a form to create that wikipage from zero just submitting the Laptop brand, model, issues founded, official links.\n\n* The wiki should be able to point to the VendorID:ProductID devices, like http://site/WIKI/ids/5986:0100 should show instructions to install that device, in the example is the integrated Orbicam Webcam in my laptop, that way the laptops wiki pages can point to the devices wiki also so no need to repeat the information. email me at contact AT ivangarcia DOT org\n\nCharging control\n\nExpose battery charging control to the GUI power management utils like gnome-power-manager. Then the user can select the strategy that best suits his or her needs, and increase battery lifetime. The current strategy is to charge batteries to 100% whenever connected to outlet power. This drastically reduces the lifetime of most current batteries (LiIon), if used naively. For example if the laptop is turned on and off daily while connected to outlet power, this reduces the available charge of the battery to a minimum quite rapidly. Some laptops provide support for controlling when to charge the battery (eg. some ThinkPads). Exposing charge threshold or \"charge now\" features to a GUI would make it much easier for regular and experienced users to preserve their laptop batteries.\n\nPower Save & Management GUI\n\nFor laptop users, the management of power is very important. Ubuntu needs a GUI for power saving settings such as CPU scaling, screen brightness, fan speed and hard disk performance. The GNOME Power Manager applet has very limited options, but may be this applet is the right place to start.\n\nLaptop profiles\n\nLaptops have been mentioned before under Startup and Networking, but I think they deserve a separate heading. I'm disappointed with the network profiles part of KN etworkConf (System Settings: Network Settings), which seems quite buggy. Even though I have Kubuntu, I use network-admin from GNOME for setting my network profile, but this isn't much better then KN etworkConf, and neither provides all the features I want. I know there are a few tools specifically for this, but I haven't investigated them yet. I suggest Ubuntu should provide a single tool by default (across GNOME and KDE). I'm not talking about Zeroconf, etc. (though of course that would be very useful too), but about pre-configured profiles for office, home, etc. -- GraemeHewson\n\nSet dynamic or static network address, and if the latter, gateway and addresses of DNS servers. These are the basic settings provided by KN etworkConf and network-admin.\n\nAllow setting the profile through a command as well as a GUI. A profile could be selected through GRUB at boot time. Once booted, a CLI might be more convenient for network engineers plugging in different cables, and so on.\n\nSet addresses of NTP servers\n\nSet available printers, local and network. (The laptop could be connected to a docking station with a local printer.) Allow spooling on plane for printing at office? This could get complicated. KISS?\n\nSet display (docking station again, or user plugging in hi-res display). Could this be dynamic -- what if Ubuntu had been installed without having seen the hi-res display?\n\nOther hardware (modem, mouse)\n\nFirewall configuration\n\nNot connected to a network. I've seen a couple of bugs here, not previously mentioned, which I'll report through Bugzilla.\n\nGraphics\n\nAfter installing Ubuntu, it should use a Display Resolution that all monitors can use. For instance; When I install Ubuntu, it sets my resolution to some 1900x which is what a HDTV would use, and with my 17inch CRT monitor it doesn't work that great. -- Jeremy[at]Hankenson[dot][com]\n\nAdd support for downloading videos from cameras via the gtkam application.\n\nPort the SuSE app Sax2. It allows xorg.cong to be configured through a GUI, including dual screen configurations. Such functionality is badly needed in an \"anyone can use it\" system like Ubuntu wants to be.\n\nA good interface in GNOME for tweaks to xorg.conf to control the entire video setup, or at least adding non-standard video resolutions, setting up Dual Display (nv or ati), enabling compositing and whatnot. Many forum articles are about XTweakThatShouldBeSimpleA-Z. Windows has a dialog for the whole video setup, so to pamper Windows converts, they should NEVER have to see the X config. --JamesGolden\n\nA simple way of configuring X for projectors would be a priority. Impress is less useful if you can't easily link the OS to an external projector to give a talk. It works if you restart X, but the resolution can be wrong. And it's useful to have a clone on the screen. -- BenHall3\n\nA \"yust work\"-interface to configure VGA/DVI output for beamer presentation\n\nBetter support for multiple graphics cards, and multiple monitors. In Hoary I had two cards, each with its own monitor. Now I have two monitors on one card. Windows handles them after a few reboots, but I have to do research to set them up in xorg.conf. \"dpkg-reconfigure xserver\" only sees one card and monitor. - RudolfVavruch\n\nA graphical tool for changing the login screen resolution (maximum resolution of X). It is a basic task -- AleksiNurmi\n\nResolution 1920x1080 (aka 1080P) should be available as a generic monitor type. More and more users have HDTV displays as a primary monitor.\n\nthis hardware-rendered x server should go in as soon as it's usable. The version of x.org in Hoary will already have the composite extensions if I'm not mistaken, and it would be great to have it all rendered on the graphics card.\n\nWarbo: Is this now obsolete? If someone knows that it is then could they please remove it (and this comment), or if they know it is not then please remove this comment, and perhaps add your own? Thanks\n\nAutomatically Updating DRI Drivers\n\nAn option to automatically update DRI Project drivers (ATI Free Drivers). Many users don't have support for their drivers in ATI Commercial Drivers (e.g. my Radeon 7500). People want this to get the faster drivers for their systems for Games, 3D, Graphics, etc. for more information: DRI CVS\n\nSupporting the DRI-Team\n\nFor desktop users it is getting more and more important to have working 3d acceleration. Especially for the latest Gnome and Kde features (transparency and other beautiful or useful gimmicks) it is quite important to have this working. While some card manufacturers deliver binary drivers, those vary in quality and no use for some platforms (ppc...). The work of the DRI project is very important for Linux on the desktop and so for Ubuntu. Maybe it would be a good idea for Canonical (if there are resources left for that) to hire some of the DRI folks or at least support them financially, because they don't have enough time to develop, because they have to do it in their spare time.\n\nThis really is important; the use of proprietary drivers hurts Free software. -- Jeroen\n\nConvert the utah-glx drivers to the DRI format. While the cards currently supported are rather old it provides a solid basis for further nvidia drivers DRI Project Homepage\n\nhttp://www.livejournal.com/users/anholt/15633.html\n\nComplete and Friendly TV Tuner Card Detection and Installation\n\nUpon booting and seeing that there is a new card (especially TV tuner cards) do everything needed to make them work (build-essential, kernel mods, etc). You could focus on one brand first like Hauppaugge then work on the other brands.\n\nI agree completely. Although i think you should start with pixelview not hauppagge I think this would be a relatively simple thing to do. Sure it would take a while to make it all cards go but i think it would be worth it. I think a way to do it (maybe not the simplest but its a way) is you could get the output from lspci then use that to find tv cards. Any that are found you could then autosetup the drivers for based on card names, models, and revision numbers.\n\nLithium (cmaster2@hotmail.com)\n\nNetworking\n\nI think there is a lot to improve in the reactivity of network-manager: we should be able to change of network easily and faster.network-manager should see new networks faster and it should be able to reconnect faster after a loss of connection.\n\nIn the Ubuntu System->Network (Network Settings) configurator on the \"General\" tab, there is the \"Automatic service discovery\" check box option. It would be nice to split this into two check boxes.\n\n1)Scan for available services on the network.\n\n2)Advertise local services on the network.\n\nThis would allow for some reduced network chatter/traffic originating from the local machine.\n\nNeed a driver for the F5D7010 Belkin G wireless card. An effort to utilize ndiswrapper was unsuccessful. Either a driver or good instructions and common errors list/solution/resolution status page? Wireless card support is a huge issue that Im hoping for improvement before 7.10 goes Beta.\n\njo_rad1<<at>>yahoo.com\n\nThere are good drivers here\n\n* Need a driver for the zte mf 330 pcmcia modem card\n\nCan an Ubuntu Linux driver for a USB wireless adapter with a Zydas - zd1211- chipset be available in Ubuntu? I have tried so many Linux distributions without any support for my wireless adapter. I really like Ubuntu and would really want to switch all my development to it, except for the limiting lack of internet connection due to unavailable driver for the Zydas chipset of my wireless dongle adapter. I know so many people are looking for this driver because of my Google search, and further search in many Linux forums. I believe it will be a big boost if available.\n\nUbuntu needs to support ADSL modems (with eciadsl, for example). Furthermore, connecting to the internet shouldn't require sudo.\n\nI agree with this guy! Please, please, add support to the accessrunner usbatm driver! (precompiled module)\n\nhttp://accessrunner.sf.net\n\nWireless LAN support is becoming an issue for more people all of the time. I would love to see Ubuntu be the first single-cd install (since it's difficult to install drivers from the web if you can't activate your net interface!) that accurately identified *and* activated many common wireless NICs including PCMIA and USB. Failing that it would be perhaps just as valuable if Ubuntu were to be associated with the largest database of what wireless hardware works and what doesn't! To the best of my knowledge there is no such database specifically for debian.\n\nhttp://at76c503a.berlios.de/ might provide us with some support for the above USB WLAN devices (Atmel AT76C503/505A in specific). - Brian Jackson\n\nProviding an interface for wireless management and support for various authentication protocols (LEAP, PEAP etc. etc.) would put Ubuntu a step forward to being a viable alternative to Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X. -- Terry Dellino\n\nEasy GUI networking options so that I can set to connect via DHCP but set my DNS servers manually and it will persist when I reboot.\n\nInstall the traceroute-package by default. traceroute is essential and will be needed often _before_ there is access to a repository. And it's only 22kB and should fit on the CD. -- tschaboo[at]gmx.at\n\nA configuration dialog for VPN (virtual private networks) is missing. With Windows, it is a matter of seconds to setup and configure a VPN connection through an unsecure network such as the internet to a remote system even with smartcard encryption. Ubuntu contains tools for creating VPNs, for accessing smartcards, etc. but unfortunately not a gui frontend to configure these components as easily as windows user can. -- Christian Jacob tronex[AT]gmail.com\n\nmore network card drivers, such as linux-wlan-ng installed by default, as well as including ndiswrapper in a default Hoary installation\n\nprebuilt rfmon-patched prism wireless modules (see [Orinoco + Monitor + Kismet 2005 + Hoary]) in the repository would be good -- [sjalex]\n\nI agree that ndiswrapper should be included in a user interface! As a Linux/Kubuntu (7.04) newbie, I had a hard time to configure ndiswrapper for my Fritz!Stick USB. This should not be done in a terminal but in a user interface, like in, say, Puppy Linux. liunxcub, smusnmr[AT]yahoo.com\n\nbetter support for corporate proxies - it should be done once and supported in multiple apps (gaim, mozilla, synaptic)\n\neasier pppoe configuration (gui or link) maybe from network-admin program... -- Lyly lyly_at_bigfoot.com\n\nWe should use something like the xandros winbind/samba client login stuff by default and set up Ubuntu to log into active directory out of the box. If our goal is to get Ubuntu adopted everywhere as a desktop, this one is huge. If admins don't have to fight through 10 scripts to get this to work, Ubuntu becomes much more friendly to existing environments. --Keith Bassett\n\na program for connecting to the Internet which supports dail up, ppoe/pppoa .... that start each time your not connected when you start your browser.\n\nZeroconf/Bonjour/Rendevouz support. There is an opensource implementation called Avahi and according to their homepage http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/Avahi it already supports all important features mentioned in the mDNS RFC. Avahi could be used to share printers (cups) and music (rhythmbox) with other users without any hassle. Mac users will also appreciate this since they could just plugin their ibook/powerbook in a Linux network and start printing. -- Ramon de Ruiter won[AT]home.nl\n\nOnly start networking at boot if the interface has link; otherwise wait 10 seconds and continue booting (10 seconds for user to plug in network card) (mostly interesting for laptops) -- Jochem Kossen jkossen[at]xs4all.nl\n\nInternet sharing. So that in a few click I can share the internet from ethernet on eth0 to all nearby wireless laptops on eth1. For this to work it would need to turn on dhcp, and network address translation. windows and mac os x both make this very easy.\n\nThis can be done w/ FireStarter (which I suggest is needed for firewalling). Though it must become obvious it can do both. -- JoeTennies\n\nEasy to use WiFi network roam program for mobile users. Are Debian network interfaces the right thing to use or is something custom like wifi-radar needed?\n\nIntegration of linux-wlan-ng with iwconfig tools. At the moment linux-wlan-ng uses a custom interface, and is a pain too setup. These drives are used a quite a few wifi devices such as the usb d-link dwl122.\n\nDo a better integration of netatalk 2.x, please! Encrypted authentication should be possible by integration of uams_dhx.so and the GUI-\"Shared Folders\" should also manage AFP-shares.\n\nWPA support without manually configuring WPASupplicant. WPA Supplicant is pretty easy to configure, but it would be much easier for beginners if it was integrated into the Networking configuration tool. Should be fairly easy to accomplish.\n\n- I more than fully agree to this! As a Kubuntu (7.04) newbie, I would have liked to have it as\n\neasy as with Sidux. Linuxcub, smusnmr[AT]yahoo.com\n\n- Agreed. I'd like more WPA support as well. -User:Webonomic\n\nGraphical tunneling utility that uses SSH or another relatively secure protocol with preset tunneling modes (e.g. VNC, CUPS, NFS, Samba, etc.).

By this I AM NOT WANTING A WINDOWS REMAKE. I simply want to plug in a router, ok, plug all my computers up, ok, turn them on and have all three major systems (os x, windows(and families), linux(Ubuntu)) to all work together. the program configures it for me, minutes later (not hours from setting up samba and yada yada) instant file sharing (excluding legal stuff) no complex writting of stuff. Thanks. This would probably be appreciated by all people of all systems.\n\nI agree with the above. I'm a newbie (1 year with linux) and have tried to connect two ubuntu desktops into a LAN to allow them share files. Although I'm not so bad in computers this \"simple\" task was mission impossible for me. I would like it to be as automated as possible and in all cases it can't it should be intuitive.\n\nInstall nscd by default to cache DNS lookups, saving bandwidth and improving response times. A network trace shows every Web page loaded by Konqueror, even on the same site, needs a DNS lookup (AAAA and A), every ping response causes a reverse lookup, etc. (Netscape and descendants have their own caching, but I don't think double caching would be a problem.) -- GraemeHewson\n\nHave RP-PPPoE (available through automatix) included by default - the GUI for setting up PPPoE connections easily (Contact: http://wiki.motin.eu)\n\nIt is great with all Howto's existing to help users when they are stuck - but they don't really do any good if one can't access the internet to start with because of problems... To include a large collection of searchable Internet/Network Howto's in the helpbrowser or similar would be a great help in these situations. (Contact: http://wiki.motin.eu)\n\nInclude this nifty script: http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/128 to allow users to pinpoint network-errors easily. (Contact: http://wiki.motin.eu)\n\nAdd a simple-to-use unique applet to manage BOTH wired and wireless networks and BOTH static or dynamic configuration. The system knows about trusted network connections; it tries to connect to trusted connections, otherwise it searches for available connections, then ask to the user if he/she wants to use one of the available connections or he/she wants to specify another connection, then it uses the connection specified by the user. Each time a new connection could be available (e.g. network cable plugged in, wireless network card switched on, GPRS device connected, whatever), the system must search for new networks and ask the user is it finds new networks. If interested in this idea contact davide <dot> vernizzi <at> gmail <dot> com both for mail and Jabber, I'd be glad of contributing.\n\nThere should be a way to share your internet connection, so you can basically turn your computer into a router with a simple graphical interface. For example say I get online through wireless, but I would like to have a switch which gets it's connection through the unused ethernet on that box. I should be able to do this. -jhennATgnook.org\n\nSimple, I hook up a router, plug all my computers in bam I'm on the internet and I can share files with both OS X Windows(and families).

No pre setup yada yada configuration yada yada samba write some horrific code cross fingers and hope it works crap no simple stuff like click and ur done. I think this would draw the attention from both os x and windows\n\nPeerGuardian integrated with Ubuntu - Currently there is no existing version of PeerGuardian available for Linux, it is an advanced open source IP Blocker and Filters spyware, fake P2P trackers, phising websites and more. Currently this is focused on the Windows enviroment. What i am proposing is if Ubuntu can make use of the opensource PeerGuardian code and make it run on Ubuntu so Linux users can benefit from its functionality. Although Linux is not prone to viruses or spyware like Windows, there are ways in which data is captured by prying eyes. This program helps keep your computer secure and data protected. http://phoenixlabs.org/pg2/\n\nMany home networks connect to the internet through a DSL modem. Unfortunately, this modem connection sometimes goes down. SuSE have a really cooled applet called kinternet (under KDE, therefore) that can run on each PC and enables the user at that PC to see the status of the pppoe link and restart it, without going to the gateway PC. This means that my kids can check and restart the link without touching my gateway machine or any priviledged account on it. This applet is what makes my kids run their dual-boot machines under SuSE not Windows, and is why I run SUSE on my gateway, not Ubuntu. I don't know if kinternet and the SuSE Meta PPP daemon - SMPPPD runing on the gateway that it works with are proprietary SUSE that need licencing - they're not ported to anything else I can find - but for me this functionality is the number 1 show-stopper. SMPPPD also allows dial-up links to be started and when needed and closed when not.\n\nI put a script into the WiFiHowto that autoconfigures the wlan device to a preconfigured WLAN if it is found when bringing up the device. The script uses the functionality in /etc/network/interfaces and if called on ifup. -- TobiasHunger\n\nRealtek 8185 and 8187B WPA support without NDISWrapper. Free drivers are available on the internet (rtl-wifi, for example), but are really difficult to get working in Ubuntu. I would love to see these drivers built into Ubuntu in the future.\n\nSupport and Install for Speedtouch USB Modems\n\nIn the UK and I suspect many other countries, many of the ISP's provide users with Free USB modems. The most common by far is the Speedtouch USB modem, these come in many shapes and sizes, but are basically 4 revisions.\n\nThere is a great Guide for technical Users at http://www.linux-usb.org/SpeedTouch/ubuntu/index.html Most of this suggestion comes from that guide.\n\nI believe that non-technical users should have the benefit of being able to use this modem. The process of setup could be done with a simple install and then config panel, The install panel would look for the modem and it revision number\n\nawk '/4061/ { print $5 }' /proc/bus/usb/devices\n\nThen extract the firmware, and place it in\n\n/lib/hotplug/firmware\n\nThen the config panel could use the command\n\ndmesg | grep 'ADSL line is up'\n\nto display to the user whether the DSL line is Synced\n\nAlso then a simple routine to modify chap and pap secrets files would be very useful, it would also benifit the user if a single panel managed the chap and pap and also the PPP details also, rather than users having to change them separately.

You could perhaps help this along with testing and things (I've added a link to the info you have given to that page as well).\n\nActive Directory/Single Sign On Integration\n\nThe large majority of corporate/enterprise networks use a single sign on system to simplify and centralize user authentication. The standard technology used to do this is MS Active Directory. Making it easier to to authenticate an Ubuntu desktop against an Active Directory domain would help increase the take up of Ubuntu within the enterprise IT environment.\n\n1) Integrate an option into the install process allowing the user to specify an LDAP server to authenticate against for single sign on. This should be possible without the need for users to edit configuration files.\n\n2) Integrate an program into the desktop system allowing the user to change and or create new LDAP settings using a GUI interface without editing configuration files.\n\nProject Outline\n\nLaunchpad Feature Specification\n\nNote\n\nSingle Sign On is already implemented here FeistyNetworkAuthentication\n\nBluetooth\n\nThe current Bluetooth interface is terminal based and not very user friendly. What we need is a GUI based interface for both upload and downloading stuff from Bluetooth devices. Right click on a file and choose an option - \"Send Via Bluetooth\" to send a file to a connected Bluetooth device.\n\nTo do this, currently, I am using a Perl Gnome script that calls gnome-obex-send. I would like this to be part of the package and would prefer it if it adds a menu to the Gnome menus and not just create a script in the .gnome2/nautilus-scripts directory.\n\nHere is a the script. Kindly use it as part of the package. I would be great if it is a part of the package itself.\n\n#!/usr/bin/perl -w\n\nfor $uri (split /\\n/, $ENV{NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS}) {\n\n$uri =~ s/\\s/\\\\ /g;\n\ngnome-obex-send $uri;\n\n}\n\nThis script works with filenames with spaces too and can be a part of the obex package.\n\nAlso, the installation of Bluetooth services should be easy. It should not involve too many steps. Currently one has to make sure the following shell script is executed each time he starts the machine.\n\n/usr/sbin/sdpd\n\nsudo modprobe l2cap\n\nsudo modprobe rfcomm\n\nsudo mknod /dev/rfcomm0 c 216 0\n\nsudo sdptool add --channel=10 OPUSH\n\nsudo rfcomm bind /dev/rfcomm0 00:0E:6D:7F:06:63 10\n\ngnome-obex-server\n\nI have currently set it up as a program to be run in every session. But that is not good enough. It should be automatic, right after an install. Initially, I tried kbluetoothd. But it does not load at startup unless sdpd is loaded. Besides, in kbluetoothd, sending files from the laptop to the device is not possible - only reception.\n\nPackage\n\nOne single package should run all Bluetooth devices for both sending and recieving, and must run right out of the box. The package can be called obex-pack or bluez-pack. A single point solution in all desktop managers - Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Edubuntu should be available. Also, this package should install be default once the device is detected. Note the automatic hardware install project above.\n\nUbuntu Bandwidth Manager\n\nI'd like to see a local-computer dynamic application-level bandwidth manager a la the windows application Netlimiter. It's similar to a traffic shaper, and can double as a firewall. You give it rules like \"Allow up to 700KBps down/50KBps up for whole computer,\" \"Allow 500KBps down/35KBps up for group (Ktorrent, Miro)\", \"Allow 100KBps down / 10KBps up for Firefox\", \"Allow 200kbps down/16KBps up for group (teamspeak, synaptic)\". It bases itself on executable path, so multiple instances are put into the same limit. Dynamic = immediately changing bandwidth as soon as you hit apply, not relying on some kind of pre-launching lockin like trickle.\n\nSo far, I've been recommended trickle, which is tedious, command-line based, and instance-specific, wondershaper, which is just the whole computer limit and command-line based, and squid, which involves complicated cache and network gateway work. Traffic shapers rely primarily on port traffic, which is very difficult with applications that switch ports, multiple apps using the same ports, et cetera.\n\nI've found Pyshaper, and it noted the above points and undertakes to fill the niche, but it appears to be very much a dead alpha from five years ago.\n\nIt just seems like a package that should be either created new or branched from pyshaper, and put into Ubuntu as an official component (though deactivated by default). Ubuntu boxes very very often run alongside windows boxes, as mine is, and getting them to play nice with the rest of the network is right now a nontrivial lesson. There are plenty of apps out there right now which don't offer smart bandwidth management, and I'm somewhat sick of Miro filling the pipe.\n\nStorage\n\nBy default keep home data on a different partition.\n\nPoweroff removable storage devices after unmount\n\nSome USB flash drives emit a light when plugged-in. This light turns-off after the user clicks on \"Safely remove device\" under Windows. This way, the user knows that the drive is indeed safe to unplug. Wheras Windows powers off USB devices after unmounting them, Ubuntu doesn't, and safety lights stay on even after the device has been unmounted. Wouldn't it be better if Ubuntu powered-off USB devices after unmounting them?\n\n--Cutter\n\nPassword Protected Folders\n\nWe should intergrate a folder/directory password protecting feature into Ubuntu. Here is how I see it working:\n\nIf a user opens the protected folder, the neat password prompt for administrator should happen, but it should be made to look diffrent. Maybe the folder with a lock icon instead of just a lock, so the user doesn't put the root password or somthing.\n\nIf a user changes directory in Terminal directly to that folder or any sub directory under it, the prompt like sudo would come up. Only, it would say \" Folder Password: \".\n\nI'm not sure how applications trying to access files in there would work, files which are protected should be excluded from any searches and unknown to any application without a password. Only the directory's name should be publicly avalible.\n\n(I have a feeling that this idea is already in Ubuntu, or was submitted, but I'm just making sure it has been said.)\n\n-Kavon\n\nRaid\n\nRAID is too hard to get working. It should be much easier to install and manage RAID arrays. Conceptually what is going on is very simple, but in practice the process requires a lot of headache. Both installing an Ubuntu system on a (root) RAID array and creating RAID arrays out of new hard drives should be supported. ~~~~\n\n\"degraded\" RAID1 array install:\n\nI run a full RAID1 array for my Linux install. Although the Ubuntu (4.1) install allows the installation of Ubuntu onto a RAID1 array, it seems to require that the RAID1 array be fully online, ie. all component member devices of the RAID1 array are online. I'd like the ability to install Ubuntu to a \"degraded\" RAID1 array, where only half of the component member devices are available. This would allow me to test out Ubuntu before completely moving to it, by going through the following steps :\n\nDegrade my existing RAID1 array, containing my existing Linux distribution install eg. split out all /dev/hda devices from the existing RAID1 array.\n\nBoot the Ubuntu install\n\nCreate a new RAID1 array, listing both the /dev/hda and /dev/hdc devices. However, nominate the /dev/hdc devices as missing.\n\nInstall Ubuntu, as per the normal procedure\n\nTest it out to see if I'm happy with the install.\n\nIf I'm happy with the Ubuntu install, add the missing /dev/hdc devices into the Ubuntu created RAID1 array.\n\nIf I'm not happy with the Ubuntu install, boot into my old distribution, and add the /dev/hda devices that were part of the Ubuntu RAID1 array back into my original, other distribution RAID1 array.\n\nThe advantage of this method is that it potentially avoids having to restore from backup an existing distribution and personal data if I'm not happy with the Ubuntu installation.\n\nI realise that the above install method is somewhat complicated and should be performed by somebody experienced with booting multiple installations of Linux on multiple devices. However, it would be far simpler and easier than the method I recently used, where I had to install Ubuntu onto a non-RAID1 disk, create a new RAID1 array after Ubuntu was installed on the other disk, copy Ubuntu to the RAID1 array in single user mode, and then add the original native disk into the newly created array.\n\nTo sum all this up, a change to the Ubuntu installer to allow degraded RAID1 arrays to be created would make the above short-cut RAID1 installation possible.\n\nMount removable storage synchronously\n\nby Jez9\n\nI think that when you plug in something like a USB dongle, it should be mounted synchronously (-o sync) instead of in buffered mode.\n\nFor me, this is far preferable to the minute performance gain gotten by mounting the device in buffered mode. You're very unlikely to be using such devices for anything except data storage/retreival, in which case mounting synchronously is a major benefit. We're looking to make Ubuntu easier to use for new users, right? Well expecting them to know you have to right-click, 'unmount', before removing the drive is IMHO unreasonable. It's also irritating for people like me who know you need to do it, but either occasionally forget or don't want to bother.\n\nMount the thing synchronously by default. This is what Windows XP does, and it allows you to just remove the drive after any file transfers have finished. Yes, problems will occur if you remove it durung a file transfer, but that's gonna happen in ANY mount mode. It's far more obvious to the user that this will cause a problem than removal of the drive before unmounting. Also stop displaying that 'unsafe device removal' message for devices mounted synchronously.\n\nI think this would make Ubuntu more intuative and easier to use.\n\nFilesystems\n\nOption to use different file systems as the root filesystem and to change it once it has already been set without losing data.\n\nThe ata_piix module is broken, causing frustration for many linux users. Most people trying to use Feisty or Gutsy on any intel ICHx IDE chipset are frustrated by the inability of the kernel to access their cd and/or hard drive. This can prevent the live CD from booting, prevent an installed system from booting after an upgrade, or, in my case, prevent me from accessing my CDROM drive on an installed system (Gutsy testing installed via netboot)\n\nThere should be a way to encrypt your file system through using graphical tools, including swap. -jhennATgnook.org\n\nAdd possibility to encrypt partitions (probably most adequate at install time) Especially interesting for notebook users. cryptsetup / luks . See Linux Magazin 10/06 (german)\n\nUSB memory sticks should be backup-ed to the local system. They are lost/destroyed quite often. When inserting a new stick a dialog should ask the user if this is his/her stick and if the user wants to create a back up in his directory (/home/user/usb-backup ?)\n\nWhen inserting a memory stick for the first time, the user should be asked, if he wants to create a truecrypt volume on the stick. These volumes are auto-mounted when inserting the stick into a ubuntu pc. Add everything to the stick needed to mount the volume on any other operating system (truecrypt executable for windows). When (not if) the stick is lost, no data can be stolen.\n\nNew Filesystem Principles Idea\n\nI do think that folders (aka directories) are outdated even now. A file is merely a piece of information, and it's name is really useful only to OS, not to users. I suggest Ubuntu would propose a new file storing standard:\n\nEvery file is related to some subjects.\n\nOne of the relations is the Main one (this is a 'folder' for old-fashioned programs). But a file can have more than only 1 relation.\n\nFiles also must have a title (a 'name'), which is unique within the main relation.\n\nWe should be able to use SQL to get a list of files matching our criteria.\n\nAn 'Open file' dialog should contain the following fields:\n\nStorage: a list of media to store files (a good idea is to include 'Any storage' item into the list. Users home folders also should appear here);\n\nCategories: a list of categories; user will select an appropriate category;\n\nFiles in this category: a list of files that use this category as the main one;\n\nOther related files: files that are related to the selected category, but don't use it as the main one;\n\nFiles that may be also related: files that are not marked as related to the selected category, but found through a full-text search. The file lists should be filled along with showing the results, so that users won't wait to reach the desired file. This concept will in future replace the folders hierarchy. To start, we can make new-fashioned 'Open file' and 'Save file' dialogs, and integrate Tracker to fill the 'Files that may be also related' field.\n\nDBFs seems to do this for KDE, maybe we could find/make something for GNOME?\n\nZFS integration would also be handy for the task.\n\nNew Filesystem Hierarchy Standard\n\nLet's be frank, it's years old, ugly as sin and more incomprehensible than a crazy cat lady. It's great if you understand it, but the average user couldn't tell their /etc/init.d from their /dev/null. I propose we do the following:\n\nChange /bin to /Programs/Essential User Commands\n\nChange /boot to /System/Bootup Files\n\nChange /dev to /System/Devices\n\nChange /etc to /System/Configuration Files\n\nChange /home to /User Files\n\nChange /lib to /System/Libraries\n\nChange /mnt to /System/Mounted Devices\n\nChange /opt to /Programs\n\nChange /tmp to /Temporary Files\n\nChange /proc to /System/Processes\n\nChange /sbin to /System/Binaries\n\nIn order to ensure compatability, symlinks should be used to link the old folders to the new ones.\n\nContra: The \"old\" definitions have some big advantages, especially when you are typing names in a Console. The suggested new names bring much discomfort. Capital Letters are less efficient and Spaces are really disturbing. But the most important contra is that a complete change would cause much compatibility trouble and people have to learn a complete new scheme. By the way: The suggested names look like W*ndows to me and I have the feeling that just the W*n world might be patched to Ubuntu. In case the filestructure is changed it is important to choose a neutral approach which is most efficient and comfortable. My suggestion is to offer symlinks from the new names to the old ones as an option, but this is a minor thing to do and just a simple script that might be offered by anyone. kuef 9th August 2007\n\n[Warbo\"]: I think the proposed names leave much to be desired. If there is to be a 1:1 mapping of directories then something like /opt -> /Programs is pretty poor considering that almost every program is stored in /usr (with binaries in /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/sbin, sharable data in /usr/share and /usr/local/share, program components in /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib, etc.). Plus why make /sbin go to /System/Binaries, which not only makes little sense in the context of a descriptive label, but also contradicts /Programs/Essential User Commands. Personally I think that whilst the current system is not perfect, nothing is perfect and changing things around from a system which has worked fine for several decades would bring more disruption than benefits.\n\n* [Chrisford]: I would like to see a user friendly interface to the file hierarchy. Something similar to Mac OS X's finder but better. Keeping the original hierarchy but with a fancy UI pointing to Apps and users folders. Like Pictures, Music, Documents etc... This is what the non-linux user expects from an os.\n\n* [RobG3]: I think the file structure should be changed, however I think it should still keep lowercase spaceless names so command driven programs will still work fine.\n\nusers - folders for users on the system\n\nroot - have the root user in the user folder instead of /\n\ndefault - this will be a default user, taking alot of settings out of the old etc folder (like firefox etc)\n\nshared - a shared user where everyone can edit file, this will be for music cd's etc\n\nname - here is a standard user, each user having there own folder\n\n.settings - this will hold all the settings, not hidden, e.g. gnome, firefox etc\n\nDesktop\n\nDocuments\n\nMusic\n\nVideo\n\nOther - Maybe some other standard folders, e.g. pictures\n\n* programs - this will hold all the programs except system programs\n\nbinaries - similar names to the old usr folder, except full names\n\nlibraries\n\n* system * settings - this will hold the settings from etc that arn't in the default user, e.g. network settings\n\nbinaries - system binaries\n\ndevices - dev folder\n\nlibraries - system libraries\n\n* boot - boot files for grub or similar\n\nThere may be some more folders, but this is only a first idea. I beleive it would appeal to both old style useres, and in-experianced users.\n\n* I think is better to have a directory for example /var/sharedir linked to all home direcory of users as AllUsersPublic, alla data at this directory can be stored modify for all internal users without problem of ownerhip. For example marry and wife have different users but want to share the same files.\n\nDetecting File systems\n\nUbuntu does a good job of mounting external file systems, whether it be USB Disks, external hard drives or CD's. But internal changes on IDE disks are not handled at all. Ubuntu should notice file system changes, communicate them to the end user and suggest possible actions. See Partition Configure\n\nFull disk encryption\n\nProvide an option during installation to create encrypted partitions (including Root, Home and Swap) with LUKS, and automatically configure scripts and configurations to allow booting from them.\n\nEspecially useful on laptops. --FedericoDelBene\n\nEXT4\n\nExt4 is the latest ext* filesystem. It supports much more data than ext3. And it has been around since 2006! Ubuntu is ext3 based, so I am preposing an upgrade.\n\nZFS\n\nZFS provides a much more flexible, powerful and lower maintenance filesystem than anything linux offers. It is open source, and although designed for multi/many disk servers, it will offer many benefits for workstations and home computers, many of which have several disks.\n\nZFS would allow some radical changes in the management of ubuntu's filesystem, and could provide a drop-in replacement for partitioning, striping, block-size decisions, EVMS,LVM,MD etc., etc.. Particularly powerful features are:\n\nbest use of all available hardware for security and speed.\n\ncompression to increase bandwidth. (Reiser4 also talking about this. Implementable with existing linux tools?)\n\nVersioning Filesystems\n\nHard drives have continuously grown in capacity and offer ever more affordable mass storage solutions. It would be great if Ubuntu took advantage of the large storage capacity of hard drives to bring real benefits to the user. One way to do this would be to use versioning filesystems for the home drive (where the user's important files are stored). Every single change the user makes to a file would automatically be remembered and the user could do things like ask \"What did this file look like on Sunday\". It could also be used to undo inapropriate changes that have been made (such as deleting a file that the user wants back). This would be very useful as the user can often make mistakes when editing a file. There is a GPL filesystem called Wayback that uses FUSE to implement a versioning filesystem on top of any other filesystem. Ideally, graphical tools would also need to be provided that allow the user to query the filesystem in a user-friendly way and from within the file manager.\n\nAgreed. Setting up versioned directories (or /home file systems) should be an easy thing to do for both users and administrators. If set up\n\n(a) old versions of overwritten files in that directory should be recoverable\n\n(b) the entire directory should be easily synchronised (e.g. between desktop and laptop).\n\nIt should be configurable that after a merge only one of the hosts (desktop or laptop) keeps the history, the other only the latest version (and all changes since the latest merge).\n\nIn normal usage, having versioning should be completely transparent, both in the GUI as in the command line. Commit should be automatic, not a manual command. In versioned directories/file systems, applications should not keep tilde~ backups of the next-to-latest version or use other similar workarounds. In a sense, Trash is also a workaround of not having versioning. For versioned directories, Trash contains \"links\" to the latest version (in the versioning system) of deleted (trashed) files.\n\nALSA and Sound\n\nUse PulseAudio as default, fedora 8 already does so, and works great. my ubuntu boxes have many problems with sound, I can't user realplayer and firefox at the same time (because of OSS) the Master settings only affect the columns and not the phones.\n\nWhen the PCM sink is at 100%, the sound gets a big distortion.\n\nwrite an alsa driver so I can use my laptop as a phone headset (http://www.soft.uni-linz.ac.at/_wiki/tiki-index.php?page=ProjectBluezHandsfree) SoundBase ( ALSA / OSS configurator and execution) would use Ncurses to select to:\n\nEnable / disable and load/unload Oss/Alsa kernel sound modules and restore old configurations (changelog file).\n\nExecute alsaconf .\n\nEnable/disable the default sound mixer, load/unload alsa/oss mixer and execute alsamixergui.\n\nSelect the output configuration for popular players (XMMS / Xine...).\n\nConfigure MIDI (hardware or software SoundFont s, midi default player and midi plugins).\n\nExecute XMMS with midi plugin and support.\n\nExecute aplaymidi .\n\nExecute timidity .\n\nAdd bluetooth-alsa support for bt-headsets (http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluetooth-alsa/)\n\nAdd a general multi-band equalizer instead of the actual one band one. Because users have any way to manage sound output directly.\n\nBetter sound devices support. You should implement ability to choose default sound card for playback and default card for recording. You should implement also \"Force to use default option\". Now, sound is played among applications randomly (?). Sound on logon screen is played on second card, startup sound on default, FLASH animation sound on website on second card, sound preview in GNOME on second card and so on. It's very irritating.\n\nOut-of-the-box ALSA configuration with multiple channels. I want to be able to play a movie in mplayer and start a second movie (in a second instance of mplayer), being able to mute the second movie without muting the first one, being able to change the volume of the first one without changing it for the second one. I want to be able to mute amarok momentarily while playing a stream in realplayer without muting realplayer in the process. Esound already does all this, but not all application support it and it seems that developers are targeting ALSA. From what I understand, this is possible in ALSA, I have just never been able to make it work. Perhaps it could even be supported at OSS level, so that I can run skype or audacity without having to close all my sound-related programs? There should still be a Master/PCM volume control, of course, but every application should have its own channel to be set individually. If this entails using an .asoundrc, then put it in /etc/skel, for instance. - numerodix [] gmail , com\n\nWarbo: PulseAudio should be able to do all of that.\n\nI agree that software mixing support through ALSA drivers is area where most(if not all) linux distros are lacking. The inability to use linux as a multimedia platform is what i find drives users away. Easier ALSA .asoundrc configuration might help. Maybe this could be done through a gui. And also support for asym by default would be help since dmix cannot handle input streams. - carlosfocker[] gmail . com\n\nJackd server integration so that rosegarden4 and above can be played out of the box.\n\nRealPlayer + Flashplayer and co to have ALSA wrappers so that multiple audio streams can be played.\n\nWarbo: Flash player 7 from Adobe now uses ALSA, as do Free Software implementations. I'm not sure about Realplayer, but it is based on Helix, which is Free Software, so I would think it as ALSA capabilities.\n\nAdd X-Fi sound drivers to the list restricted drivers and/or include OSS 4.0 which includes X-Fi support\n\nPackage Management\n\n* i have an idea for the synaptic package management,is that making synaptic package management could be able to read and install all packages format that ever made for linux such as you know ( tgz,rpm,deb and etc). and if its able to decode exe file like cadega , wine or crossover so its like all in one . yeah\n\n* After installation of programs (using Synaptic) a popup propose where store the program at menu-bar and icon to use (change allowed). The icon is proposed automatically (after a auto-search in icons directory better, same size of other used icons, at top of list proposed). All programs (bin) without a menu link, can be stored automaticcally in a directory of menu-bar 'All programs' and, if selected, can be presented the same popup to move it in other place of the preferred menu (selecting icon).\n\n* I think we must create a new package type better then .deb package. The .deb packages have the compressed content in two .tar.gzip file. We can do a package with .tar.bz2 archives, so the packages are more small. I put the extension \".ubu\" for the new packages.\n\nWarbo: I thought that Debian packages can support pretty much any compression type these days. I know they originally had Gzip hard-coded into them, but since debian-binary 2.0 I thought Bzip2 was supported (and if a new Open Source compression technique is going to be used then why not 7zip?). Making yet ANOTHER type of incompatible package is a bad idea in my opinion.....\n\nExperienced Linux users aren't going to be looking to install kubuntu-desktop. Theyre going to be looking for KDE. I'm not suggesting that you change the name back to KDE, but some cross-referencing is really necessary. If you change the name of an application, all you need to do is add the old name to the description, so that when I type\n\napt-cache search kde | grep desktop\n\nkubuntu-desktop comes up. I can't tell you how much bad-mouthing of Ubuntu I did after a search for KDE produced no result. I could imagine no other explanation but that apt was somehow broken.\n\nWindows users are used to install software by just clicking \"Next\". I think that the next step is to add this feature, built-in in Ubuntu. This feature will attract thousands of \"Scared from linux windows users\" users. In my opinion, this is the next step in the Linux world.\n\nTake a look at Gdebi for an .exe-like install of .deb packages.\n\nThe package manager is one of the most powerful features of linux. Why would you want to have to go back to managing sets of install files when It's done for you automatically, with all dependencies and everything. This is for me one of the biggest selling points for linux and ecspecially Ubuntu when I am trying to move clients from proprierty software, \"You need to do that, OK no problem, just go to synaptic, search on your keyword, find the description that matches your need and tell it to install. The rest is done for you.\"\n\nWarbo: As is said above, Gdebi gives double-click installation of packages, and dpkg has had configuration wizards for a long time for packages where there is no obvious default configuration. I think this deserves to stay, however, as Gdebi is not a universal way of installing software, alien, checkinstall and other methods exist, which can make installing third party software confusing. There are many attempts to tackle this, but until there is an accepted cross-distro way of doing things the point is still valid.\n\nCompiz - the information displayed in the pane should state that the command \"compiz --replace\" needs to be executed in order to run the package. There are a lot of new users asking how to execute.\n\nPerhaps it would be simpler for the end user if you divided the Add/Remove Apps into System Components and User-Installed Apps.\n\nKDE-based Klik looks like a very promising project, and it's not just a theory: thousands of Klik packages are available today. Ubuntu should keep a close eye on this project with a view to perhaps integrating it to the desktop.\n\nStart installing packages while downloading. It will speed up the hole process if apt-get installs packages with satisfied dependencies while downloading other packages. Use case: joe wants to install 3 applications, the total amount of required packeges is 12, the first application needs e.g. 4 packages, the second 5 packages, the third none aditional. now apt-get orders the package so that packages with less dependencies than others are downloaded first. apt-get chooses the third package without unsatisfied dependencies, downloads it and starts to install it immediately while the other packages are downloaded. as soon as the third package is installed and all packages for the first application were downloaded, apt-get installs this application while downloading the second one, with the most depenencies ... and so on ... -- Soc\n\nBe sure to check out SoftwareMap... a great idea for an easier package manager. -- SolidAndShade\n\nIn Gentoo there's something called USE-Flags. I can define a systemwide \"ssl\" flag to install all application with ssl support, I can define \"doc\" to install special documentation... It's kind of a dependency switch... You could add a \"restricted-formats\" for totem to install all restricted packages for it too... -- fabian\n\nUnder Debian, and I think also Ubuntu there are task-packages, which manage to install all packages for a particular problem (e.g. ubuntu-desktop).\n\nBut I think it would be also interesting to have some knobs to let some packages depend on other packages for example lang:de would force mozilla-thunderbird}} also to install {{{mozilla-lang-de. Like language-*-pack, which doesn't install every package, but only this one which is useful because an depending package is also installed.\n\nIt would be great if Synaptics would show just my installed applications in a list somewhere and NOT their dependencies, so I have an overview over my selfinstalled packages -- fabian\n\nIt would also be great if I could remove certain packages without removing ubuntu-desktop, cause I don't need reisertools for example... (this has got something to do with the point above, cause after my proposal, there would be just ubuntu-desktop in the list...) -- fabian\n\nThis has been implemented in feisty. it is now possible to remove the default apps without removing ubuntu-desktop -- SamTygier\n\nmaybe group together certain packages (mount, time, diff,grep, less...) to a \"gnu-base-package\" or something like that. That would clean up the lists in synaptics dramatically... -- fabian\n\nThere should be an easy way for temporarily installing the packages (something along the lines of save-package-configuration -- install new package and all its missing dependencies -- revert to saved package configuration). As of now, I have to check the dependencies list prior to installing a package for testing so that I could remove not only the main package but its obsolete dependencies as well. -- wolli\n\nUse aptitude instead of apt-get. Such feature in Synaptic would be great because it is used by most of the users IMHO.\n\nThe requirement above should be implemented not only for temporarily installed packages, but for all, and not with the help of saved package configuration. A perfect way would be, if package management knew, wheter a package is installed intentionally, or \"by necessity\", as dependency of one or more intantionally installed package. When the user removes an intentionally installed package, all packages installed \"by necessity\", whose only intentionally installed dependent package is the removed one, should be removed. This feature could save remarkable disk space, and make package management more transparent. -- loci2\n\nUse unionfs to implement the above. I will see if it's possible to install breezy ontop of hoary using unionfs to simulate dualbooting. -- JohnNilsson\n\nSupport having a unionfs layer on /etc where user modified files are stored. When the system needs to modify /etc it should thus make sura that changes are written to the system layer not the user layer. -- JohnNilsson\n\nThe centralized repository method of installing software (apt-get/synaptic) is valuable, but it is not a complete solution. It has the following problems: latency between software release and acceptance into repository, the difficulty in maintaining a large repository, the installation of non-free/proprietary software etc. The solution is autopackage . It is not designed as a replacement to synaptic/apt-get, rather to supplement its shortcomings for a superior solution. The ultimate goal should be something similar to MacOS appfolders, but better. Once the user has chosen to give some software access to their system, we should be making it as easy as possible for them to act upon their decisions. Security therefore becomes a matter of how to aid the user in making the correct decisions rather than making their lives inconvenient.\n\nMaybe apart of this problem is that it isn't easy enough to add repositories. Why not make it as easy as clicking on a link? Couldn't we have something like repos://http::archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/::edgy::universe which would add popup a messagebox and ask the user for authorization to add \"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universe\" to /etc/apt/source.list\n\nSynaptic - In addition to \"Import key from file\" add \"Download key from URL.\" - This would make https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine \"install newer version\" not need any shell commands. -- CarlFK\n\nA centralized package management tool would be great value if you are to manage more Ubuntu-machines in a network. The idea is to select the packages from a central location, and then be applied by a daemon on the clients. You could manage all clients at once, have different groups, and install specific packages on single machines - all from the comfort of your office/room. NielsKjøllerHansen\n\nA way to install rpm, or tar packages without using the command line. Some sort of integration into nautilus or Konqueror. Installing packages that don't appear in the Ubuntu pool (like maya and limewire) using alien, and then installing them using dpkg without using the command line would be so much easier for people wanting to install packages, but don't understand/are afraid of the command line. If you see a problem with this (give me a break, I am 14) email me at rjmarsan@gmail.com\n\nAutomated package cleanup (such as what debfoster or deborphan offer) with apt (and accessible via front-ends like Synaptic or Adept). TrishankKarthik\n\nAdd a way to easily reinstall all the dependencies of a program, without having to check the package page to see which software we whould reinstall to make something works again (also it should reinstall the dependencies of the dependencies and so on). geearf(at)free(dot)fr\n\nSometimes is a headache to install apps from sources, first one has to get the source, then the ./configure, make, sudo make install, and pray all the dependencies are met. There could be an app that does that for the user, it could get the source file and try to make the ./configure, if certain dependencies are not met, then launch Synaptic or apt-get the files, then \"make\" and then \"make install\", once done, ask the user where to put the app \"Accesories, Internet, Multimedia, System related\" and set the link in the Applications Menu. Then keep record of that app in a Historic just as Synaptic to check in new \"updates/upgrades\". -- xerman\n\nGoogle like searching in synaptic: something like \"intitle:gtk perl\". basically give user control of searching package name and description.\n\nSynaptic is an excellent package manager. Why use adept in Kubuntu?\n\nBecause adept is KDE and it is better integrated to our desktop environment.\n\nRespin .iso's every 2 weeks with important updates. I estimate 85% of synaptic traffic is being wasted just bringing 3-month old disk installs up to date. Not only that, but it's annoying having to download 100MB of stuff every time Ubuntu is installed somewhere.\n\nRelying on centralized repositories is inefficient. Package updates could be optionally delivered via a file sharing protocol like bitorrent. Each system that downloads updates could then act as a seed/server to provide updates to other systems requesting them. The central repositories would provide the initial seed and checksums to verify integrity of data. This would be particularly effective at reducing load on the servers during major version upgrades. This could likely be implemented completely in the apt layer of the system and might not even require any code changes to higher level interfaces (beyond perhaps adding an interface to allow/deny sharing and to set bandwidth limits). Let me be clear here; I am not suggesting just providing torrents of ISOs (that is already done) but finely granular sharing of individual package updates through functionality integrated into the package management subsystem.\n\nInstall 'gkdebconf' and 'libgnome2-perl' by default, on (first) gnome startup, add a script that changes the configuration mode from dialog to gnome. Or instead of just first, each time gnome starts, and revert to dialog on logout. (So dpkg-reconfigure can be called from console if something goes wrong with X and it needs to be re-configured) - chibifs@studiochibico.com\n\nSelf-contained packaging system\n\nA system such as PBI used in PC-BSD is needed for Ubuntu. It incorporates all of the needed libraries and files into a single directory and with an installer that is simply amazing. This allows programs to run independently of the OSes libraries and there is no fear of a program install/removal damaging the system in any way. This solves problems of library versions and makes installation/removal trivial.\n\nIt is not good have in .pbi file all needed libraries because so we have some duplicates of libraries. They must be in other packages.\n\n- Dominic Tiberio (dominic*NOSPAM*tiberio@gmail.com)\n\nAdd/Remove programs should be able to only show one of each type of program\n\nIt could be by default or as an option. It would only show one of each type of program, e.g. web browser, email client, feed reader, IRC client, etc.\n\nApt needs some updating\n\nApt should should have a relational database, so that it will run faster, also there should be some more data stored about the programs to facilitate system restoring. The data should be backed up automatically and regularly, so that if the database is stored on another computer and first computer has a hardware failure, the data from the backup can be used to completely restore the computer to its status again. It should be a relational database that contains checksums of the compressed and uncompressed files that will be installed. So that if there is a problem with the computer and something is segfaulting, every file on the computer can be checked against this information, including freshly downloaded files, so that they can find out if any of them are corrupt and need to be replaced. Then apt can automatically download the file. I have had to numerous times manually edit the text database that apt writes to because somethings had been changed to \".\" when it should have been \">\". In a good relational database, the version numbers can be kept separately from the rest of the data, this will all go to help avoid corruption and lead to scalability both for individual machines and networked enterprise machines.\n\n- -- Justin Emmanuel ( justinemmanuel@gmail.com )\n\nAPTFS- a drag and drop software repository\n\nI strongly believe one of the best features of the UBUNTU desktop experience is the (apt) software repositories. My humble suggestion will to make getting the software simpler, more intuitive and fun. Rather then apt-get or even the nice-but"
