Approved by: portmgr (tcberner)\n\n2.2_1\n\n07 Sep 2022 21:10:59\n\nStefan Eßer (se)\n\nAdd WWW entries to port Makefiles It has been common practice to have one or more URLs at the end of the ports' pkg-descr files, one per line and prefixed with \"WWW:\". These URLs should point at a project website or other relevant resources. Access to these URLs required processing of the pkg-descr files, and they have often become stale over time. If more than one such URL was present in a pkg-descr file, only the first one was tarnsfered into the port INDEX, but for many ports only the last line did contain the port specific URL to further information. There have been several proposals to make a project URL available as a macro in the ports' Makefiles, over time.\n\n(Only the first 15 lines of the commit message are shown above ) 2.2_1\n\n20 Jul 2022 14:22:28\n\nTobias C.

This doesn't eliminate pkg-config run dependency completely, a second phase is needed and is planned. * Support for .:run. and .:build. for USE_GNOME components was added. Currently only libxml2 and libxslt support this mechanism. * Updates of the telepathy stack and empathy. * Trim makefile headers, convert ports to new options, trim off library versions for some ports. * Fix other ports so they build with the new glib version.

The same applies to many more ports, but that's not the point here. Anyway, registering those files can create conflicts when another package updates the definition of one of such auto-generated files.

The official release notes for this release can be found at http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.28/ . Officially, this is mostly a polishing release in preparation for GNOME 3.0 due in about a year. On the FreeBSD front, though, a lot went into this release. Major thanks goes to kwm and avl who did a lot of the porting work for this release. In particular, kwm brought in Evolution MAPI support for better Microsoft Exchange integration. Avl made sure that the new gobject introspection repository ports were nicely compartmentalized so that large dependencies aren't brought in wholesale. But, every GNOME team member (ahze, avl, bland, kwm, mezz, and myself) contributed to this release.\n\n(Only the first 15 lines of the commit message are shown above ) 0.60\n\n23 Feb 2009 05:20:29\n\nmarcus\n\nUpdate to 0.60.\n\n0.40\n\n04 Jul 2008 17:24:35\n\nmezz\n\nUpdate to 0.40.\n\n0.30\n\n18 May 2008 19:40:01\n\nmezz\n\nUpdate to 0.30.\n\n0.23_1\n\n24 Mar 2008 03:50:55\n\nmarcus\n\nThe FreeBSD GNOME team is proud to annunce the release of GNOME 2.22.0 for FreeBSD. The official GNOME 2.22 release notes can be found at http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.22/ . On the FreeBSD front, this release features an updated hal port with support for video4linux devices, DRM (Direct Rendering), and better support of removable media. Work is also underway to tie webkit more closely into GNOME. As part of the GNOME 2.22 upgrade, GStreamer received a rather large upgrade as well. Be sure to consult UPDATING on the proper steps to upgrade all of your GNOME ports. This release would not have been possible without the contributions and testing efforts of the following people: Pawel Worach kan edwin Peter Ulrich Kruppa J. W.

The official GNOME 2.20 release notes can be found at http://www.gnome.org/start/2.20/notes/en/ . Beyond that, this update includes the new GIMP 2.4 (courtesy of ahze). The GNOME 2.20 update also includes a huge change in the FreeBSD GNOME hierarchy. We are now using the more standard DATADIR of ${PREFIX}/share rather than ${PREFIX}/share/gnome. The result is that fewer patches and hacks are needed to port GNOME components to FreeBSD. This will mean some user changes may be required, so be sure to read /usr/ports/UPDATING for more details. This release and the things we accomplished in it would not have been possible without mezz's crazy idea to collapse DATADIR, and his persistence to make it happen successfully.
