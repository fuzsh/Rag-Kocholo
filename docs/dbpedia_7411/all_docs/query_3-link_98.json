That means you don't need to build everything alone yourself!\n\nSUSE Approved\n\nWhile the packages from the SUSE Package Hub are not officially supported by SUSE, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server remains supported and supportable when using these packages.\n\nFactory Built\n\nopenSUSE Factory is the package production system churning out high quality, up-to-date packages for openSUSE Tumbleweed and openSUSE Leap distributions. The exact same source code qualified and approved for those distributions is used for the SUSE Package Hub.\n\nFree!\n\nThere is no extra cost to use SUSE Package Hub packages with valid SUSE Linux Enterprise subscriptions.\n\nAlways There\n\nSearching for those packages that used to be available on download.opensuse.org or some other community download site? Packages in the Package Hub remain available for the life of the SUSE Linux Enterprise product. Also, every release remains available, so if an update breaks something, you can easily roll back to the previous release."
