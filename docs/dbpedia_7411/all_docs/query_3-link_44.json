What’s the killer app for you that you wish was a snap install away, automatically updated and always fresh?\n\nIs there some tool you use which is ancient in the archive? What about that game which is outdated? Perhaps there’s a brand new fast moving command line tool you’re using, which you have to build from source, like a barbarian? Maybe you’re getting envious about a desktop app available elsewhere, but not in your distro? What about that thing in a PPA which doesn’t get updated often?\n\nI think everyone has their own pet applications or tools & utilities that they’d like to see snapped, and I wanted to get some feedback from our community to find out what you want to see snapped next?\n\nLeave a comment below, and feel free to suggestions you agree with!"
