        "text": "Mike James\n\nUnited States\n\nColumbia\n\nMaryland\n\nThe first man to raise a fist is the man who's run out of ideas\n\nBusiness! Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were all my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!\n\nBoardgamegeek is probably my favorite web site on the internet, and in many ways it is the closest thing to mecca that any serious boardgamer will find. I use the site not only to learn about interesting games and fascinating people, but I also like to catalog my board game collection on it. The site is very well organized and makes it so you can keep track of every game you own - and every game you want to own:\n\nAnd if that's not enough, there's even a Boardgamegeek iPhone app:\n\nMy collection looked so cool on it that I started wondering what other options are out there for cataloguing board games. Why would I do this if I am already satisfied with BGG? Well, there are a couple of reasons. One is that BGG is a web site, and like anything on the internet, it is at the mercy of computer servers and internet service providers. Those things can be unpredictable at times, and if you lose your internet connection or BGG's site goes down for some reason, you can't access your game collection. It doesn't happen often, but it's a bummer when it does.\n\nAnother reason is that I just think it's fun to build a database, particularly if it has my beloved board games in it. What could be more geeky than building a game database? And sure, I could just use the feature on BGG that allows me to save my collection as a spreadsheet, but spreadsheets are often drab little documents without some of the eye candy I'd like to have. So I found a bunch of software programs that enable me to catalog my collection on my hard drive. I thought I would share my observations with the board gaming community.\n\nThis list is not in any particular order or preference. It's just a guide letting board game users know what is out there, how they can use it, and how well I think each individual application works for board games.\n\n(Note: I have no affiliation whatsoever with any of these companies or software developers. I just use their programs. And I am sure there are undoubtedly some other game database programs out there that I am unaware of, but these are the ones that I have tried. If people would like to submit more reviews, feel free.)\n\n1. GCstar (www.gcstar.org) - This is a free program written in the Perl programming language. It's been around a while and is most commonly found in the Linux operating system, but there is a Windows version available. People have been using GCstar to catalog collections ranging from stamps to comic books to wines to mini vehicles. As such, it is a very useful and robust collection manager.\n\nAnd here's the best part: GCstar is built to handle not only board games, but it has a great feature that allows you to connect directly to Boardgamegeek and download all sorts of information directly into the program. It's as easy as this: type in the name of the board game you want to add to your collection. Click GCstar's \"Fetch Information\" button. Select Boardgamegeek from the drop-down list, and GCstar will import a wealth of data from BGG, such as game description, developer, publisher, year released, suggested age, and most importantly, a box cover photo. All of the information will be stored into your GCstar database. Here are a few screenshots:\n\nThe program also has an import feature that enables you to build a game database from a .csv file. This is useful if you want to build your database directly from a spreadsheet you created from your personal games page on Boardgamegeek. It helps if you have a little experience importing data from spreadsheets, but even if you don't, it's a relatively simple skill to learn.\n\nAnother interesting feature of this program is its ability to port over your entire collection to your Android phone (sorry, no iPhone capability.) I don't have an Android, so I didn't try this out. But people on GCstar's forums say it works.\n\nGCstar is a great program, but it's star may be fading - at least in the world of Windows operating systems. GCstar is developed under the Gnu software license and its developers aren't actively updating the Windows version any more (although it is still available for download.) If you happen to use Linux, you have no worries, because GCstar's primary development is within the Linux sphere. The latest Linux version of GCstar has some nice features, not the least of which is the ability to scan information into the program with a barcode reader.\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nName: GCstar\n\nOperating systems supported: Windows, Linux, Mac\n\nCost: Free\n\nPros: Boardgamegeek integration; excellent spreadsheet importing; very slick look; exports collection to Android phone; Linux version can scan barcodes for certain types of collections.\n\nCons: Windows version is not currently being updated; not the easiest program to use.\n\n2. MediaDB (http://wsims.com/cweissha/mediadb/index.php) - If you like GCstar's ability to download information directly from BGG, then you'll love this little Windows program. Also free, it is a very small download and it has the ability to sync with your BGG collection. It's very fast, too: it downloaded box covers and all BGG information for over 300 games in my collection in just a few minutes. Talk about an instant database! It can also track your books and DVDs, and there is a built-in search feature for BGG.\n\nI'd have to say it is really hard to beat this program for sheer convenience. It doesn't have some of the bells and whistles as the others, such as the ability to load your collection on to a mobile device, but overall this is a great way to create a board game database on your hard drive:\n\nThe only minor quibble I have with MediaDB is that it is a bit lacking in data import capability. If you want to import some of your game data from a spreadsheet, it has to be in the exact format that the program exports data in. But like I say, this is minor considering that you can download your whole collection so quickly. It has a very nice report printing feature, too:\n\nI would say MediaDB is a must-have for any true geek.\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nName: MediaDB\n\nOperating systems supported: Windows\n\nCost: Free\n\nPros: Boardgamegeek integration; unique syncing capability with BGG; very fast and light.\n\nCons: Spreadsheet importing is a bit lacking.\n\n3. Sisimizi Game Catalog (www.sisimizi.org) - Another completely free program, Sisimizi's best feature is portability. It can run off portable media, such as a flash drive. It is a no-frills program based on the success of the Ant Movie Catalog, a popular movie databasing software that uses scripts to quickly download all sorts of useful information. That's where the name comes from - \"Sisimizi\" is a Swahili word for ant.\n\nSisimizi is designed for video games. But like GCstar, it has a data import feature, and that means you can import anything you want, including board games. You'll have to do it with a spreadsheet (.csv) file, but this is a powerful little program (just 2.6 mb in size.) Importing data into Sizimizi is smooth and easy. Using a spreadsheet of my Boardgamegeek game collection, and with a little help from my GCstar database, I made a Sisimizi catalog in just five minutes:\n\nThe program has some nice features, including several interesting screens showing the statistical breakdown of your games by genre, year, and other categories:\n\nThe other benefit of Sisimizi is that you can also use the program to catalog all your video games, too. Sisimizi has no Boardgamegeek integration, unfortunately, so you can't use the program to directly download information from BGG. But it has several scripts available that will enable you to look up video game information from sources such as Amazon and www.allgame.com.\n\nThe portability of this program is pretty nifty. It is a no-brainer to just drag and drop the program folder from your computer to your portable hard drive or flash drive, and Sisimizi will run just fine, no matter what Windows computer you plug it into. Just double-click the program file, and you've got your whole game collection in front of you.\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nName: Sisimizi Game Catalog\n\nOperating systems supported: Windows\n\nCost: Free\n\nPros: Portable game database runs off a flash drive; excellent spreadsheet importing; nice pie charts of your collection.\n\nCons: No boardgamegeek integration.\n\n4. Data Crow (http://www.datacrow.net/) - Data Crow is a free cataloguer that uses pre-made and user-made modules to keep track of anything you can possibly possess. Like Sisimizi, it is totally portable - no installation file is required. You can download a .zip file, extract the contents to your flash drive or other portable media, and the program runs out of the box. Since it is written in Java, it can run on just about any operating system, although Data Crow's web site only has pre-packaged versions available for Windows and Linux.\n\nThere is no board game module offered in the program, but I made one in a matter of minutes by simply using Data Crow's module wizard. Then I imported all my board game data into the module via a .csv file.\n\nIf it had all worked well, I would say Data Crow is a great option, but I found the program to be EXTREMELY finicky about formatting. For instance, when I ran the data import feature, Data Crow only imported about half the games on my spreadsheet. After investigating, I discovered that this was because Data Crow did not like certain text characters within my game descriptions, and it just flat-out refused to import them unless I cut and pasted new text for each game it wouldn't import. The problem is definitely unique to Data Crow, because I used the same .csv file to import all my games successfully into other programs.\n\nI found a few other bugs with this program as well, not the least of which is that it is quite difficult to manually edit game information and it occasionally won't allow you to save your changes. The issues may get corrected over time by the developer, but in the meantime, Data Crow requires a fair amount of troubleshooting. If you're willing to do it, you'll be rewarded. Here's a screenshot:\n\nThis program is one of the more complete catalogue solutions around, provided you are willing to learn its nuances. The module creation wizard works well and you can catalog not only all your games, but also books, movies, software, music CDs, and anything else you can think of. Just click the module tab and you will switch from one collection to another in less than a second. Here's a look at the books module:\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nName: Data Crow\n\nOperating systems supported: Windows and Linux. Also Mac if you build it from source code.\n\nCost: Free\n\nPros: Portable game database runs off a flash drive; nice graphical look; module system allows for a lot of customization for games, books, movies, and anything else you collect.\n\nCons: No boardgamegeek integration; somewhat buggy; help forum online doesn't offer much feedback.\n\n5. Game Collectorz (www.collectorz.com) - This one has great potential to be the best option on the list, so it is worth mentioning. Unfortunately, it's hard for me to recommend it to anyone but the most hardcore collector, because of the work involved to adapt it to a board game database. Also, it's not free. Collectorz is a Netherlands-based company that specializes in database programs. They make separate software programs for $49.95 each that can track your collections of movies, comics, music CDs, books, and games. So it is pricey.\n\nLike Sizimizi, it is designed for video games, not board games. And while many programs on this list have an option to import your game collection from a database, Game Collectorz is much less user-friendly in this regard. Importing from a database, such as a .csv file, is critical because it makes it so you can import your boardgame collection quickly and easily. Unfortunately, Game Collectorz has a very weak data import capability: it can only import game title, platform, and UPC code. So even if you have a spreadsheet chock-full of information about your collection, Collectorz will only import those three pieces of data for each game. That's not terribly helpful. I've even gone on the Collectorz forums and asked the developers why the import feature is so weak . . . you would think that they would want to have a strong data import capability so that people would be more willing to switch over to their expensive program. But the response they gave me is that it is a low priority.\n\nToo bad, because the Game Collectorz program has some excellent features. It can export your entire collection to your iPhone, iPad, or Android (of course, they charge $9.99 for the app . . . these guys never seem to miss a chance to charge you money.) But because I was curious about it, I bought it and the iPhone app does work well, and in my opinion has a much slicker, more streamlined look than BGG's iPhone app, and is also easier to navigate. In short, there is more \"WOW\" factor here:\n\nThe above screen shots show part of my board game collection that I ported over to my iPhone using the Game Collectorz program on my Windows 7 laptop. So how did I get my collection into the Collectorz program, you ask, when it is so difficult to import data into? Well, I imported as much data as I could from my game spreadsheet. That put the game title, platform, and UPC code of each of my board games into the program. After that, I dragged and dropped box cover photos (thank you, GCstar and MediaDB) of each game on to its listing in Collectorz. It took me three hours over two nights to do it for my entire collection of 394 board games. So it looks great, but it's a lot of work if you have a large collection:\n\nFor a handful of games, like War of the Ring Collector's Edition, I added even more information, like artist, recommended age, number of players, and even some BGG pictures of the game components. Collectorz supports video playback, so I ripped some YouTube videos of Marco Arnaudo's great BGG game reviews and put them in the program's folder. I click a button underneath the game description, and Collectorz starts up my media player and runs Marco's review of that particular game. Pretty cool:\n\nThe screenshots give you an idea of what Collectorz could be for many boardgamers if the company would simply incorporate a more robust data import function. But don't hold your breath, I wouldn't count on it happening any time soon.\n\nIf you are patient and want to manually build your database like I did, Collectorz is a great option, and not only because of its high-end iPhone/iPad/Android ability. In contrast to its lousy import feature, Collectorz has an outstanding export feature . . . the Windows and Mac versions of the program will send your entire collection to your mobile device via WiFi or a USB cable. Collectorz also can export a wealth of data to a .csv file. That means you can quickly and easily create comprehensive listings of your collection, with even more data fields than Boardgamegeek's spreadsheet exporter contains.\n\nAnother great feature is its ability to obtain information about videogames via barcode. You can even buy a barcode scanner that will interface directly with Collectorz and feed it the barcodes, which the program will use to download information and pictures of each game in a few seconds. But this feature is just for videogames and not board games at the present time.\n\nCollectorz also makes excellent printed reports, with many different templates available. Here's one:\n\nLast but not least, you can also use the main program to upload your entire collection to a web service called Collectorz Connect, available for free to registered users. This enables you to access your collection via the internet:\n\nHmmm, so . . . you can view all your board games on your iPhone, and you can see them all online whenever you want. Sound familiar? That's what Boardgamegeek allows you to do as well. So I am NOT saying that Collectorz gives you anything far greater than BGG, and considering all the negatives that I stated previously, most people won't want to fuss with Collectorz. But I do like its capabilities, and it is interesting to use and build databases with. Very high-end stuff.\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nName: Game Collectorz\n\nOperating systems supported: Windows and Mac.\n\nCost: $29.95 for basic edition; $49.95 for pro edition with more features.\n\nPros: Excellent porting to iPhone/iPad/Android; very slick look; many report templates to choose from; barcode scanning of videogames; video playback; data export capability is outstanding; will publish your collection to a web page online if you have the pro edition.\n\nCons: No boardgamegeek integration; spreadsheet importing is terrible; requires a lot of work to adapt to board games; company is fairly greedy and charges money for important updates, all its mobile apps ($9.99 each), and premium online cataloguing service.\n\n6. eXtreme Games Manager (www.binaryworks.it/extremegamesmanager) - This Windows program costs 14.95 Euros and is a relative newcomer. It bills itself as \"probably the most advanced electronic/board game collection manager around.\" And while it is not bad, I would have to say that I don't agree with its claim to be an \"advanced\" tool for board game collections.\n\nIn the day and a half that I played around with this program, I found it to be heavily geared toward videogames. There are several scripts included with the program that enable a user of the program to connect to videogame sites such as Moby Games, Gamespot and Allgame, but the only option for board games is Amazon, and the information available for download through the program was decent, not great.\n\nThere were some user requests made on the eXtreme Games Manager forum for a Boardgamegeek script that would enable the program to directly download BGG information, much the same way that GCstar and MediaDB do. The program developer, to his credit, attempted to make BGG integration work, but was unable to do so due to some incompatibilities and it appears he has given up on the idea. If he was able to come up with a solution to the problem of direct BGG import, then this program could have something. One thing it has right now is the ability to import from an XML database created by Game Collectorz, and it works perfectly. Here's a screenshot of my collection in eXtreme Games Manager:\n\nSo if you have your games in the Collectorz system, you can easily import them into eXtreme. But otherwise, there is no other way to import your data, such as from a spreadsheet. Being able to export your games into eXtreme from Collectorz is excellent, but there really ought to be an import from .csv or some other text file.\n\nThis is a decent program overall, but it is sorely lacking BGG import capability.\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nName: eXtreme Games Manager\n\nOperating systems supported: Windows\n\nCost: 14.95 Euros\n\nPros: Imports seamlessly from Game Collectorz; nice looking; regularly updated by the developer.\n\nCons: No boardgamegeek integration; cannot import from a .csv file or other spreadsheet; online update feature does not work as well for board games.\n\n7. GameList (www.wakefieldsoft.com/gamelist/download.html) - This is an old Windows program that appears not to have received an update since 2007, but I am including it here because I have seen at least one post on BGG about it.\n\nIt's a rather simple program, and like several others on this list, it is primarily designed for videogames. But it has a decent data import feature and you can use a BGG .csv file to create a board game database in the program. You'll have to provide your own box covers, though, unless you have a database already created in GCstar, Collectorz, or Sisimizi that has .jpg images of your games. Then you can point GameList at the right image file and it'll show your game picture.\n\nHere's a screenshot:\n\nLike I say, it is nothing fancy. And it's not free ($29.99 to register,) so it really doesn't compare well to the rest of the programs on this list. It's short on features and is a bit of a hassle to install on modern-day operating systems, although with perseverance, I did get it up and running on Windows 7 64-bit. It's functional, but it really ought to be free, or at least updated by the developers.\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nName: GameList\n\nOperating systems supported: Windows\n\nCost: $29.99\n\nPros: Data import from .csv spreadsheet works well; simple and uncluttered interface.\n\nCons: No boardgamegeek integration; no updates to the program since 2007; requires patience to install on modern-day operating systems such as Windows 7.\n\n8. Tellico (http://tellico-project.org/) - Tellico is one of the oldest collection managers on the web, and it's quite simplistically elegant because its developers have had a lot of years to work out the bugs. It's also free, and it's got boardgamegeek integration, much like GCstar. Thanks to a third-party script, you can type in a board game name, and Tellico will grab info from Boardgamegeek to fill in lots of data fields, such as publisher, year, description, box cover, etc. It will not sync like MediaDB, however, which means you will have to build your database one game at a time by using Tellico's BGG search script.\n\nUnfortunately, if you are a Windows user, you are out of luck on this one. Tellico is written primarily for Linux, although there is a Mac version if you are willing to build the program yourself from source code. If you're running any version of Windows, Tellico will not run natively.\n\nI find Tellico to be an excellent program, but it's not for the digitally squeamish. Not everyone wants to run Linux. Tellico is highly customizable but you need to take some time to familiarize yourself with the program. Its data import capability is quite good - it can not only import from .csv files, but also XML and directly from GCstar. It has very easy-to-use report printing functions as well, with many templates to choose from.\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nName: Tellico\n\nOperating systems supported: Linux. Mac if you build from source code.\n\nCost: Free\n\nPros: Venerable and battle-tested collection manager; plain and practical interface; Boardgamegeek integration via a third-party script; data import and export both work very well; nice report printing features.\n\nCons: A bit of a learning curve.\n\nLast but certainly not least . . .\n\nThe last two items on the list are utilities made by Boardgamegeek users. While neither creates an actual database in the strictest sense of the term, both do a very nice job building a listing of your BGG collection that you can store on your computer:\n\n9. BGG Games Report Generator (http://bggreportgenerator.nors-jensen.dk/publish.htm) - Made by BGG member Brian Nors Jensen (Nors), this is a great tool that will access your BGG collection online, extract the details from it, and build a beautiful PDF file of your whole collection. It contains box cover shots of each game, and also includes brief summaries of all games and information such as playing time, number of players, and even a summary of how you rated all your games. It's very easy to use. Here's a picture of the utility . . .\n\n. . . and here is a picture of the PDF file it creates . . .\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nName: BGG Games Report Generator\n\nOperating systems supported: Windows\n\nCost: Free\n\nPros: Makes a great looking PDF file of your games and any information about them.\n\nCons: It's just a PDF maker, so it's not going to have the versatility of a database program.\n\n10. WhatToPlay (www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/477878/whattoplay-a-downloadabl...) - This is a truly outstanding application. It's made by BGG member Dave Mansell (Wilikai), and is kind of like a database on steroids, because you can interact with it. His description says it all:\n\n\"It lets you load your BGG collection, filter by number of players, playing time, weight, mechanics, and much more. Then you can view details, comments and polls about each game. Think I Don't Know, What Do You Want to Play? in digital form.\"\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nName: WhatToPlay\n\nOperating systems supported: Windows, Mac, Linux.\n\nCost: Free\n\nPros: Cool little program for viewing your collection quickly; excellent filtering aimed at helping you narrow down your game choice for the evening; home-brewed BGG application; can store BGG information on your hard drive for quick loading.\n\nCons: Would be nice to have an option to print the list.\n\nOther Notables:\n\nI am including these because they are programs that have been mentioned occasionally on BGG forums, so I feel I should address them:\n\nDelicious Library (www.delicious-monster.com) - This is a $35 program that only runs on Mac, and I confess that I don't have a Mac, so I was not able to try it out. But Delicious Library has many fans out there, and it certainly appears to be a well-designed cataloguing program that offers some interesting features. One of them is the ability to scan barcodes via the webcam on your computer . . . basically, you hold a product such as a book, DVD or videogame in front of your webcam, and Delicious Monster will scan the UPC code, go online, and grab information about your item. Then it will upload the information - such as title, genre, and description - into your asset library.\n\nDelicious Library says on its web site that you can \"catalog your books, movies, music, software, toys (including board games)\" . . . now, my experience with other programs that scan barcodes is that they don't have effective UPC look-up capability for board games. I posed a question on Delicious Library's forum asking about this, and an employee responded, \"Delicious Library searches Amazon for items you add. Board games are typically found, yes.\" So it will search for board game information, but make no mistake about it, Amazon is nowhere near as effective a data source for board games as Boardgamegeek. Any board game search on Amazon will typically yield minimal information, and only for games that are being sold on Amazon. And obviously, the barcode feature will only work for board games that have a barcode, and many older games do not.\n\nThis screenshot comes from the company web site. I could not find any screen shots of someone who's built a board game collection using Delicious Library:\n\nThe program gets rave reviews for its ability to get barcode information from DVDs, books and other media, but board games are probably a different story. Like I say, I haven't tried the program, though, and I'd welcome any input from any BGG user who has tried it for their boardgame collection. Delicious Library has a .csv import function, so at the very least, it would not be difficult to import your board game collection into the program's database via a spreadsheet.\n\nMediaMan (www.imediaman.com) - This one really isn't an option for board games. MediaMan ($33.95) looks nice and it has the ability to search online for information about videogames and other media. But I tested the trial version and any search I did of a board game title simply returned information about videogames and/or books with the same name, or nothing at all. It also cannot directly import data off your BGG spreadsheet into the program. So it is basically useless for building or importing a board game database. This screenshot is from the company web site and shows a videogame database:\n\nConclusion\n\nBuilding databases is great geekfun. For most people, BGG is the easiest and best option for tracking your board game collection online. For building an offline database, here are my recommendations from the programs I looked at:\n\nIf you're just looking for a quick down-and-dirty way to export your BGG collection into a locally-stored database, then grab MediaDB and sync up with your personal BGG games listing in just a few minutes.\n\nIf you would like to have your game collection database in your pocket or on your keychain, get Sisimizi Game Catalog and drop the program on your flash drive for total portability.\n\nIf you want to take some time and have a mega-database with many bells and whistles, build it one game at a time with GCstar and its excellent BGG \"fetch\" feature.\n\nIf you want to be completely insane (like me,) then buy Game Collectorz and input most of your own data. Once you do that, you can export into any database program you want, as well as your iPhone, iPad, or other mobile device, print out fancy reports, scan in your videogames via barcode, and even watch Marco Arnaudo's video reviews of your favorite game.\n\nIf all else fails and you don't like the sound of any of them, just mess around with WhatToPlay and the BGG Games Report Generator. You won't be disappointed.\n\nIt's hard for me to choose a favorite. But I will say that nothing I tried makes me want to stop tracking my collection on BGG. And there isn't a software program out there that awards geekgold\n\n- Mike James (mjfoxtrot)\n\n[+] Dice rolls\n\n[+]\n\n116471. mjfoxtrot\n\n1d6 =\n\n(6) =\n\n6\n\nSun Mar 18, 2012 9:54 pm"
