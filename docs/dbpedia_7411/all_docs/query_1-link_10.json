        "text": "Overview of and topical guide to Perl\n\nThe following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the Perl programming language:\n\nPerl – high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, multi-paradigm, dynamic programming language. Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier.[1] Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions and become widely popular amongst programmers. Larry Wall continues to oversee development of Raku. Note that Perl and Raku are receiving ongoing development, therefore making Perl a family of programming languages. It stands for Practical Extraction and Reporting Language which processes data using pattern matching technique.\n\nWhat type of thing is Perl?\n\n[edit]\n\nPerl can be described as all of the following types of things:\n\nFamily of programming languages – a programming language is an artificial language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that control the behavior of a machine and/or to express algorithms precisely. Both Perl and Raku are each considered a:\n\nGeneral-purpose programming language – programming language designed to be used for writing software in a wide variety of application domains.\n\nHigh-level programming language – programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. While low-level programming languages are very cryptic, a higher-level programming language may use natural language elements, be easier to use, making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable with respect to a low-level language.\n\nInterpreted language – programming language in which programs are 'indirectly' executed (\"interpreted\") by an interpreter program. This can be contrasted with a compiled language which is converted into machine code and then 'directly' executed by the host CPU.\n\nScripting language – programming language that supports the writing of scripts, programs written for a software environment that automate the execution of tasks which could alternatively be executed one by one by a human operator.\n\nGlue language – programming language (usually a scripting language) used for writing programs or scripts that activate other scripts and programs (thus \"gluing\" them together).\n\nDynamic programming language – high-level programming language that executes many common behaviors while running that other languages might perform during compilation, if at all. These behaviors could include extension of the program, by adding new code, by extending objects and definitions, or by modifying the type system, all during program execution.\n\nDynamically typed programming language – A programming language is said to be dynamically typed when the majority of its type checking (for example numerical vs. non-numerical) is performed at run-time as opposed to at compile-time. Therefore, the type for a particular variable or value is not locked in. In dynamic typing values have types, but variables do not; that is, a variable can refer to a value of any type.\n\nFree and open-source software – software that is both free software and open source. It is liberally licensed to grant users the right to use, copy, study, change, and improve its design through the availability of its source code.[2] Both Perl and Raku are free and open-source.\n\nFree software – software that can be used, studied, and modified without restriction, and which can be copied and redistributed in modified or unmodified form either without restriction, or with restrictions that only ensure that further recipients have the same rights under which it was obtained and that manufacturers of consumer products incorporating free software provide the software as source code. In addition to this, Perl is available for free (i.e., at no cost).\n\nOpen-source software – computer software that is available in source code form: the source code and certain other rights normally reserved for copyright holders are provided under an open-source license that permits users to study, change, improve and at times also to distribute the software. Open source software is very often developed in a public, collaborative manner. Perl is developed and supported by a large international community of volunteers.\n\nOther names for Perl\n\n[edit]\n\nBackronyms that describe Perl while treating it as an acronym:\n\nPERL = Practical Extraction and Report Language[3]\n\nPERL = Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister[4]\n\nOther descriptions\n\nDuct tape for the Internet[5]\n\nSwiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages\n\nAspects of Perl\n\n[edit]\n\nStrengths of Perl\n\n[edit]\n\nFlexibility – perl is feature rich, and has borrowed from many other programming languages. This is reflected in the motto \"There's more than one way to do it\". There are also many extension modules available to expand the language.\n\nCross-platform implementation – perl programs work on many types of computers, usually without the need to modify the source code. Perl interpreters have been developed for most operating systems (platforms), taking into account the idiosyncrasies of each, so all such platforms can theoretically run the same code.\n\nText manipulation – anything from spell checking, to search and replace operations using regex, to natural language processing.\n\nPattern matching – regex is integrated into perl.\n\nStream editing –\n\nDatabase manipulation –\n\nShell scripting – perl is good for writing programs in the form of a series of commands to be run by the Unix shell, a command line interpreter. Such programs are called \"scripts\". In this regard, perl is considered to be a scripting language. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include program execution, printing text, and file manipulation (copying, renaming, deleting, etc.).\n\nBeing an interpreted language, perl has the following advantages:\n\nPlatform independence\n\nReflection and reflective use of the evaluator (e.g. a first-order eval function)\n\nSmaller executable program size (since implementations have flexibility to choose the instruction code)\n\nDynamic typing\n\nDynamic scoping\n\nWeaknesses of Perl\n\n[edit]\n\nSlow – being an interpreted language, perl code generally runs slower than compiled code. It would not be well suited for writing state-of-the-art video games, for example.\n\nSoftware maintenance – source code may be cryptic (much like C), making it difficult to maintain code or fix bugs in code written by somebody else, unless adequate remarks are included.\n\nComponents of Perl\n\n[edit]\n\nPerl documentation\n\n[edit]\n\nPerl Programming Documentation – name of the user manual for the Perl 5 programming language, available online and for offline use.\n\nPerl language structure\n\n[edit]\n\nPerl language structure\n\nPerl data types – classifications identifying various types of data, that determine the possible values for each type; the operations that can be done on values of each type; the meaning of the data; and the way values of each type can be stored.[6][7] The main data types in perl are:\n\nScalars\n\nArrays\n\nHashes\n\nFilehandles\n\nSubroutines\n\nTypeglobs\n\nPerl control structures\n\nPerl modules - modular extensions of the Perl language. The following modules (and module groups) and many more, including support for them (manuals, etc.) can be found on CPAN.org, using its search box:\n\nWebpage-related modules – for creating, serving, fetching, and parsing web pages\n\nCGI.pm\n\nLibrary for WWW in Perl (LWP)\n\nWebFetch\n\nURI\n\nHTML\n\nGraphics-related modules – for manipulating graphics and images\n\nGD\n\nGraphics\n\nImage\n\nImage-Pngslimmer\n\nCTPP\n\nDBIx::Class\n\nGtk2-Perl\n\nMason\n\nMoose\n\nPerl Data Language (PDL)\n\nPerl DBI\n\nPerl Object Environment\n\nTemplate Toolkit\n\nTk – for building Perl programs with a graphical user interface\n\nElements of a perl script\n\n[edit]\n\n#!usr/bin/perl – called the \"shebang line\", after the hash symbol (#) and ! (bang) at the beginning of the line. It is also known as the interpreter directive.\n\n# – the number sign, also called the hash symbol. In Perl, the # indicates the start of a comment. It instructs perl to ignore the rest of the line and not execute it as script code.\n\nMain structure (derived from C)\n\nVariables\n\nExpressions\n\nAssignment statements\n\nBrace-delimited\n\nBlocks\n\nControl structures\n\nSubroutines\n\nText editors that support Perl scripting\n\n[edit]\n\nNotepad++ – supports syntax highlighting and code folding for over 50 programming, scripting, and markup languages, including Perl.\n\ngedit – free open source text editor for the GNOME desktop environment, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. Designed as a general purpose text editor, gedit emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. It includes tools for editing source code and structured text such as markup languages. It has configurable syntax highlighting for various languages including Perl.\n\nUltraEdit – commercial text editor for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X (Intel) created in 1994 by Ian D. Mead. The editor contains tools for programmers, including macros, configurable syntax highlighting, code folding, file type conversions, project management, Perl Compatible Regular Expressions for search-and-replace, a column-edit mode, remote editing of files via FTP, interfaces for APIs or command lines of choice and more.\n\nVim – free and open-source text editor based on vi, designed for use both from a command line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface.

It is a standard feature of most Unix-like operating systems. AWK is named using the initials from the last name of each of its 3 authors.\n\nC – very popular programming language. Many later languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C, including C++, D, Go, Rust, Java, JavaScript, Limbo, LPC, C#, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, Verilog (hardware description language), and Unix's C shell. These languages have drawn many of their control structures and other basic features from C. Most of them (with Python being the most dramatic exception) are also very syntactically similar to C in general, and they tend to combine the recognizable expression and statement syntax of C with underlying type systems, data models, and semantics that can be radically different.\n\ngrep – grep stands for \"Global Regular Expression Print\". It is command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines matching a regular expression. Grep was originally developed for the Unix operating system, but is available today for all Unix-like systems.\n\nsed – (stream editor), is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language. sed was one of the earliest tools to support regular expressions, and remains in use for text processing, most notably with the substitution command. Other options for doing \"stream editing\" include AWK and Perl.\n\nsh – the Bourne shell, a command-line shell for Unix.\n\nPerl software\n\n[edit]\n\nCommercial software programmed in Perl\n\n[edit]\n\nAnti-Spam SMTP Proxy\n\nAxKit\n\nBackupPC\n\nBig Medium\n\nBioMOBY\n\nBioPerl\n\nBonsai\n\nBricolage\n\nCatalyst\n\nCGIProxy\n\ncPanel\n\nCowsay\n\nDada Mail\n\nDancer\n\nDebian bug tracking system\n\nFink\n\nFrozen Bubble\n\nGCfilms\n\nGCstar\n\nGreymatter\n\nIComic\n\nIkonboard\n\nInfobot\n\nLedgerSMB\n\nLiveJournal\n\nLogitech Media Server\n\nMajordomo\n\nMARC\n\nMason\n\nMatt's Script Archive\n\nMaypole framework\n\nMojolicious\n\nMovable Type\n\nNTP pool\n\nOTRS\n\nPadre\n\nPerl Archive Toolkit\n\nPerl Object Environment\n\nPerlbal\n\nPlack\n\nPOPFile\n\nProBoards\n\nQpsmtpd\n\nRequest Tracker\n\nSpamAssassin\n\nSprog\n\nSQL-Ledger\n\nStrawberry Perl\n\nSVK\n\nTWiki\n\nV6\n\nVERTCON\n\nWebGUI\n\nWebmin\n\nWebsite Meta Language\n\nWikiWikiWeb\n\nXuheki\n\nFree software programmed in Perl\n\n[edit]\n\nAgora – was a World Wide Web email browser and was a proof of concept to help people to use the full internet.
