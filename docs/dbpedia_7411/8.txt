GCstar is an application that can be used to manage collections of different types. Users can enter all the items they own, along with associated information and later perform searches using filtering criteria. A plugin system allows some information to be downloaded automatically from Internet sites. Collections can be exported to many formats, including HTML, XML, CSV, or Tellico file format, or imported from Ant Movie Catalog or Tellico, among others. It currently manages collections of movies, video games, books, music, numismatic, wines, board games, and lets users define their own types of collections.
