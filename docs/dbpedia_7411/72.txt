GCstar is an open-source application for managing personal collections. Detailed information on each item can be automatically retrieved from the Internet and the user can store additional data, such as the location or whom he has lent them to. The user may also search and filter the collection by criteria.

GCstar is written in Perl and uses GTK+ for its GUI widgets.

Current version manages these kinds of collections:

Board games

Books

Comic books

Mini vehicles

Movies

Music

Numismatic

Periodicals

Smart cards

Stamps

TV show episodes

User defined collections

Video games

Wines

GCstar is the successor to GCfilms, which only managed collections of movies.[1]

Features

Automatic retrieval

Information concerning an item (from one of the default collection types) can be automatically retrieved from various Internet websites. Only a few pieces of information, such as movie title or ISBN, are required to perform the search.

Import and export

GCstar supports importing collections created by other programs, such as Alexandria, Ant Movie Catalog, or Tellico. It can also import lists made in more standard formats, such as CSV or a simple list of items' names.

The collections may also be exported to various formats, including HTML, SQL, or XML.

Lending managements

Each item in a collection can be marked as loaned to someone. GCstar keeps an history of all borrowers. It can also send an email to the borrower.

The mascot

The GCstar mascot is the same as GCfilms': a blue periscope named Péri. He was created by LE SPEKTRE.

Platforms

GCstar may be used on any system for which Gtk2-Perl is available. It is included in many Linux distributions (Debian, Fedora Extras, Ubuntu Linux Universe, Mandriva Linux contribs) and FreeBSD. A version for Microsoft Windows also exists.

GCstar is released under the GNU General Public License. Images associated with the project, for example Péri, are released under a dual license: GNU General Public License (to be used in GCstar) and Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike License v. 2.5 (to let other designers use it).

Reviews

GCstar has received generally favorable ratings across its lifespan.

On April 16, 2007, Mihai Marinof's review of GCstar 1.1.1 at Softpedia gave the software a "Very Good" rating of 4 out of 5 stars. Her wrap-up read:[2]

The Good

GCstar is a free application for managing personal collections. By default, it can manage movies, video games, books, music or numismatic collections but also allows the user to create a custom collection type. Detailed information on each item can be fetched from Internet websites but also additional information can be manually added by the user. It's quite easy to use and provides a clean interface. It's written in Gtk2-Perl so it's able to run on basically any GNU/Linux system, as well as on MS Windows.

The Bad

Unfortunately, each collection type is saved under a different file, creating a new collection type is very difficult and the items list can't display both the image and text at the same time.

The Truth

GCstar can organize different types of items, for instance movies collections, games, books, music, numismatic or even user defined collections. Unfortunately, creating a new collection is quite difficult. However, it's a pretty good application and you should first give it a try and then decide if you want or don't want to make it a part of your software collection.

In a December 20, 2010 review of GCstar version 1.6.1, CNET Editors rated the application 5 out of 5 stars and "Spectacular" (the highest possible ratings), noting: "There are many collection managers to choose from; some free, some easy. GCstar is both. It's one of the best of the type we've seen."[3]

In ratings accessed on June 7, 2012 at Google Play, the Android-based GCstar Viewer received 4 out of 5 stars from Google Play and 3.9 out of 5 stars from viewers;[4] similarly the GCstar Scanner received 4 out of 5 stars from Google Play and 3.8 out of 5 stars from viewers,[5]

In an article published in issue 164/2014 of Linux Magazine,[6] the editor Erik Bärwaldt reviewed GCStar, discussing usability and use cases as well as viability. He concluded:

Conclusions

The only shortcoming of the GCstar collection management tool that I noticed was that the software does not let you print out inventory lists, although you can export lists in various file formats. Otherwise, the program leaves little to be desired: It is fast and stable, properly localized, and has a logical superstructure, including meaningful categories. In particular, Linux users who have several different hobbies will definitely learn to appreciate GCstar, thanks to the numerous templates for various collection types.
