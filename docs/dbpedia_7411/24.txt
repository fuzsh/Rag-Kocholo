GCstar will help you manage your collection of movies, TV series, books, comics, periodicals, wines, software, and any other item you like to collect.

GCstar is available for Microsoft’s Windows operating system, for Apple’s Mac OS X, and it is also available for Linux. Focusing on Windows alone, it must be said that a setup wizard will help you install GCstar on your PC. The installation process is presented in the Quick Look video that accompanies this article.

There is a lot to like about the application’s interface: it is quite easy to use, it provides support for lots of languages, it provides support for skins, it allows you to select what information is displayed on the interface. So to sum it up, GCstar has a user friendly and customizable interface.

When you launch GCstar, it will invite you to select a collection type: board games collection, books collection, comics collection, computer software collection, and more. Say you have a movie collection – go ahead and pick the movies collection type. After that you will get access to a lot of handy features: manually add movies to the collection, have GCstar fetch movie info from the web, see who borrowed movies from you, pick a random movie to see tonight, and more.
