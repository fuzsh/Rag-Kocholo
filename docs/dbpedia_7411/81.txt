GCstar is an application that can be used to manage collections of different types. Users can enter all the items they own, along with associated information and later perform searches using filtering criteria. A plugin system allows some information to be downloaded automatically from Internet sites. Collections can be exported to many formats, including HTML, XML, CSV, or Tellico file format, or imported from Ant Movie Catalog or Tellico, among others. It currently manages collections of movies, video games, books, music, numismatic, wines, board games, and lets users define their own types of collections.

More plugins now use big pictures if the option is checked. GCstar now imports identifier and media labels from movies collections created with Ant Movie Catalog. There are new plugins to fetch information from Web sites: nooSFere (Books -- FR) and TheLegacy (Video games -- DE). The following problems have been fixed: a rating was sometimes lost when displayed with stars, problems occurred with the commandline, the title when opening items in windows was not updated, and the title in the list was incorrect for some collections when modifying many items together.
