        "text": "In solidarity with the celebration of the quadricentennial or 400th year of the founding of the first parish of the City of Valenzuela, the Parish of San Diego de Alcala in Polo, and the 400th Year of the Reorganization of Polo as a Pueblo, we now look back on the important event that shaped the current spiritual life of Catholic believers in the city of Valenzuela.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBefore the town of Valenzuela became part of Metro Manila in 1975 and became a full-fledged city in 1998, it was known as the town of Polo, and was still part of the province of Bulacan. Even before the Spaniards reached Polo, it was already a settlement. Don Felipe Salonga (one of Lakandula’s sons) was one of those who ruled this area; and we will remember that he was part of the Sabwatan sa Tondo (Tondo Conspiracy) of 1587, where he was one of those who planned the strike against the Spaniards. The Franciscan missionaries played a big part in sowing the seed of the Catholic faith in the southern part of Bulacan. Polo first became a doctrinaire (a missionary place administered by an order), several missionaries arrived in Polo to preach the Good News, among them Beato Francisco de Santa Maria (c. 1586). Year 1623 when the first church was built in Polo, and when there was a reorganization of this area according to the Spanish plan to become a full pueblo. The following is a sequence of events that show the development of the Christian faith in the City of Valenzuela, since the establishment of its first parish in the year 1623, and the subsequent growth of parishes within the town from Parish of San Diego de Alcala. Some events related to the spiritual life of the believers of this city will also be mentioned here.\n\nMarch 5, 1621 – It is assumed that Fray Francisco de Sta. Maria (now blessed) in Polo as a missionary. Beato Francisco de Santa María was one of the thirty-eight Franciscans who made up the ninth mission that came to the Philippines in the year 1606. He was born in Montalbanejo, Spain in 1586 from a rich farmer’s family. He was sent to the Provincia de San Jose in Mexico where he dedicated himself to the Franciscan order. Later, he was ordained as a priest in the Provincia de San Diego. From here he administered several parts of Katagalugan; signed the libros parroquiales in Meycauayan in 1608, became minister of Balete and from 1617 to 1619, administered Sampaloc from 1619 to 1621, and Polo from 1621 to 1623. Polo became a doctrina (a mission area administered by an order)\n\n1623 – The first parish was established in Polo under the supervision of Father Juan Tarancon OFM, and under the supervision of San Diego de Alcala. Polo was reorganized as a pueblo from the first settlement reached by the Spanish. The date November 12, 1623 is recognized as Valenzuela Day. Although there is no specific date of establishment, it was based on the celebration of the first feast of the patron of the said parish, where the believers first gathered in a celebration.\n\nJune 14, 1625 – First administration of Father Antonio de San Gregorio, OFM, who was assigned as parish priest of Polo in the years 1625, 1646 and 1652 January 26, 1624 – Father Alonso de Santa Ana took over as parish priest of Polo. He came from Pon Ferrada of Astorga and was ordained as a priest in the Provincia de San Jose. In 1597 he studied the language in Meycauayan and supervised Lucban in 1599. Then he also went and supervised the spiritual needs of the believers in Tayabas, Gumaca, Mauban, Meycauayan, Morong, Pililla, Polo and Sampaloc until 1625. He wrote the Explicacion de la Doctrina Cristiana and the Version de la Doctrina del Cardenal Belarmino in Tagalog, which contains his explanation about the Oficio Divino and about the content of the Holy Mass.\n\n1632 – The parish church of San Diego de Alcala was completed, led by Father Jose Valencia OFM.\n\nApril 29, 1754 – The town of Obando was separated from Polo and became a full town on May 14, 1753 by virtue of the decree issued by Governor General Francisco Jose de Obando y Solis.

Pd. Alejandro Ferrer and others. The following year, May 20, 1754, the new parish of Obando was established: the Iglesia de San Pascual Baylon de Pueblo de Obando (Church of San Pascual Baylon of the Town of Obando). Reb. Pd.

It is bordered to the north by the Meycauayan river, to the south by the Tinajeros river, to the east by the two other haciendas of Tala and Piedad. Casa Hacienda de Malinta had its own church.\n\nMay 12, 1764 – It is believed that the first Polo festival was held at the patron saint of San Roque. During the height of the British occupation of Manila, the unrest caused by it reached as far as Polo, Bulacan. The Poles fled to the woods of the Veinte Reales where many of them contracted malaria. They attributed their recovery and salvation to San Roque, patron saint of Mabolo. After returning from their evacuation, they celebrated San Roque every May 12.\n\nSeptember 24, 1856 – The new parish of Novaliches was established.

Prior to this, on January 26, 1856 the town of Novaliches was formally established after the Audiencia Real heard the petition for the separation of the town and approved it in 1855. The new town of Novaliches was formed from a visitation from the town of Polo , two barrios from the town of Meycauayan, and a part of Barrio Soledad from the town of Caloocan. A large part of the town of Novaliches comes from the town of Polo. The parish was first assigned to Santisimo Sacramento, later the new parish was placed under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin of Mercy.\n\nSeptember 24, 1856 – The new parish of Novaliches was established.
