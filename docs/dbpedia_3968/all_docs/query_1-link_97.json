        "text": "O UR RAINBOW OF FAITH CONFRONTS global factors that tend to be totalitarian. Often we are being told to believe in one way and not in another. However, in Latin America there are many forms of Christianity, manifested in so-called people&#39;s religion and spirituality. Inculturation (often understood as a new concern in the Church of today) has been carried out throughout the centuries, by mestizo,1 Afro-American, and indigenous peoples. All of this is significant for churches in other regions of the world, since a deep human desire is to be persons Of faith, within different cultural paths, and in a common praise for the gift of life. We would wish these links be not an unbalanced relationship between North and South, West and East, but rather a co-responsible search for a new humanity that loves this earth and longs for heaven. This aim needs to motivate the communication between us, so that we appreciate our differences and can build an authentic global reality. In this process,...\n\nThis article critically reviews recent contributions to religious research in Latin America. Social scientists have long considered religion to be a struc-turing feature of culture and local society. Owing to the centrality of Catholicism in Latin America, early studies privileged the political influences of the Catholic Church with respect to the state and society at large. The \" other-ness \" of native folk religions received less attention, with scholars undervalu-ing the presence of indigenous and African religiosities. In Latin America, religions are currently experiencing a diversification and reconfiguration, owing in part to the growing influence of different Christian denominations , particularly Evangelical and Pentecostal churches. Religious change is also occurring at the margins of institutional churches through New Age, neo-pagan, neo-Indian, neo-esoteric, and self-styled religiosities, as well as through popular religious syncretisms, indicating new experiments with what is considered sacred. This dynamism poses theoretical and conceptual challenges to scholars analyzing religious diversity and the renewed role that religions play in contemporary societies with respect to secularization, syn-cretism, and hybridization as well as the emergence of alternative identities (gender, sexual, ideological and political).\n\nLatin America today is much more than simply Catholic. To describe it as such would obscure the complicated cultural history of the region while belying the lived experiences of believers and the dynamic transformations in the religious field that have distinguished the longue durée of colonial and postcolonial Latin America. Diversity, heterodoxy, and pluralism have always been more useful descriptors of religion in Latin America than orthodoxy or homogeneity, despite the ostensible ubiquity of Catholic identity. Indeed, deep indigenous Amerindian, colonial European, and displaced African roots have intermingled for centuries and vie today for status and influence among the myriad believers who make up the multicultural tapestry of New World faith and belonging. At the same time, new religious movements along with extremely successful Protestant proselytization campaigns have come to shape the diverse character of religious life as we know it from the Caribbean to Central and South America. The four volumes reviewed here offer a snapshot of this diversity and indicate the trends in scholarship that attempt to render it comprehensible in comparative terms. OPEN ACCESS: https://larrlasa.org/articles/10.25222/larr.341/\n\nA critical problem to study Catholicism in the context of Latin American modernity, is that the conceptual tools we use to study religion were designed to understand the transformations that modernity provoked in European religiosity. Studies on the religion of Latin Americans have largely explored the religiosity of the population through surveys that measure attendance, adherence and affiliation. While some anthropologists have explored religious practices among particular groups, we do not know how ordinary, urban Latin Americans practice religion. To fill this gap, a group of researchers from Boston College, Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, Catholic University of Córdoba, and Catholic University of Uruguay, funded by the John Templeton Foundation conducted between 2015 and 2018 a study of religion as practiced by Latin Americans in their daily lives. We saw that the transformations brought about by modernity at the social and personal level have affected religious traditions and organizations as well as the ways in which people live their religiosity. Religious sources have been pluralized, and religious practices are diverse and occur everywhere. There are no “exclusive” secular or religious spaces, objects or times; religious practices are not circumscribed to “the religious.” This way of living religion among respondents, poses future questions for sociology and religious institutions.\n\nCatholicism become the most widespread religion in Latin America.By the 1990s Latin America was responsible for 42% of the world’s Catholic population. Despite their common Catholic identity,Latin Americans also have Amerindian, African, and popular non-Christian religious traditions inherited from Spain. Even today many Catholics incorporate practices and beliefs that are not accepted by the Church, including devotions to non canonized saints, some of them portrayed as bandits (or who protect criminals). Over the past few decades, the religious map of Latin America has been further enriched by the presence of new religions, predominantly Protestant denominations. Because Pentecostalism shares various cognitive and emotional ties with African and indigenous religions, this may help to explain its popularity among indigenous inhabitants of rural areas and for those with a history in Afro-Brazilian religions.This chapter also discuss religious practices in Latin America, including miracles; different hierarchies of “supernatural” beings; reciprocity, which includes promise and sacrifice; pilgrimages; popular celebrations; and a variety of devotional practices\n\nOver the last three decades, the production of social sciences regarding religion in Latin America has focused on the transformations of religious beliefs, practices, and identities in the region, with ethnographic studies being the prevailing methodological approach. This work aims at measuring the magnitude of the mutations in religious belonging and commitment to religious institutions in Latin America, identifying convergent and divergent profiles among the different countries of the region. For that purpose, the available statistical data both from official institutions and from research centers has been compiled and analyzed. The text further reflects on the epistemological assumptions underlying the construction of statistical information, on the contribution of quantitative studies to the sociology of religion and on their complementarity with qualitative approaches. It also explores the scope and implications of the secularization process in the region, based on changes in religious belonging and commitment. The existing surveys coincide in highlighting a declining tendency of Catholicism, with different intensities according to each country, a growth of evangelical adherents, and of those denominated “without religion,” a category that was unknown decades ago. It refers to those Latin American who consider themselves believers, although they do not feel identified with any religious framework, within the setting of a strong process of individuation of beliefs and religious deinstitutionalization.\n\nRecent decades have seen important developments in Latin American writings in the sociology of religion field. Not only has there been exponential growth in the number of publications on religious phenomena in the region, but the field itself has also shifted from sociology about Latin American religion to a Latin American sociology of religion. This field takes contemporary Latin American forms of religiosity as an empirical referent, then goes even further to propose interpretive frameworks and new methodologies that contribute to the understanding of religious phenomena at a global level. This chapter introduces four prominent Latin American sociologists of religion: Roberto Blancarte’s work on laicity; the critical analysis of Cristián Parker on popular religions within multiple modernities; Hugo José Suárez’s conceptualization of “para-ecclesiastical agents,” a key concept for understanding religious collective practice in Latin America; and Eloisa Martin’s proposal of the heuristic potential of analyzing practices of sacralization for understanding popular religion in Latin America."
