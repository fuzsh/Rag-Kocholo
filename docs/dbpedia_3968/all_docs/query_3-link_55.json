Most importantly, please remember inclusion on this list does not in itself satisfy the Criteria for Inclusion. Collocations may or may not warrant their own individual entries, and not necessarily in the exact form they appear here. If you see a word in this list which is clearly out of place (wrong language, punctuation, superfluous capitalisation), you are welcome to remove it. While creating entries for words, please leave valid bluelinks in place as these pages may be copied for use with other language projects in the future."
