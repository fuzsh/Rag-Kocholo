        "text": "Whenever we encounter the word “Fraile” in history books, most people will associate it with an image of a stout friar up in a habit, sometimes holding a whip and a scornful look as popularly portrayed as an evil Servant of God, as what Philippine Propagandists wanted to convey to push for the Anti-Spanish agenda.\n\nBut little to what most of the Filipinos know that not all friars are what the Propagandists and the Nationalist have in mind. In fact, it was through the efforts of the Friars that helped us to improve our lives from its primitive ways from education, advancements on labor, trade, infrastructure, even protecting us from the abuse of some government officials and most importantly, our rich Catholic Faith.\n\nOne of the most outstanding of all the friars that developed and ministered out country is Saint Pedro Bautista of the Franciscan Order. Though very few knew about him, except on some areas were churches he built and at times, dedicated to him, he contributed much on developing some key places in the country under the Franciscan administration that would later became key cities in the country. He also taught church music and the manufacture and use of musical instruments, discovered the medicinal characteristics of the hot springs of Los Baños, strongly defended the basic human rights of the indigenous peoples of Zambales and most importantly, an ambassador in Japan that would led to his martyrdom.\n\nHis Early Life\n\nSan Pedro Bautista, a contemporary of Sts. Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross, was born Pedro Blazquez in San Esteban del Valle on June 29, 1542, three centuries after Saint Francis. He studied Latin and cosmology in Mombeltran, and continued his studies with the Jesuits in Oropesa and later studied music in Avila. He served in the cathedral for two years as a choirboy. In 1560 he studied philosophy and theology in Salamanca for 6 years until he felt called to the priesthood. He was ordained deacon in Avila.\n\nIn 1567, the young Pedro Blazquez returned from Salamanca and entered the Franciscan novitiate in Arenas, where San Pedro Alcántara (1562) was buried. Here in the spiritual fervor and rigor of the Alcantarine reform the spirit of the young novice Pedro Blazquez was formed. He professed in 1568. Coming as a deacon with ecclesiastical studies already done, he was soon ordained priest and was assigned to preaching and formation work in the Province.\n\nHis Missionary Work\n\nThe times were conducive to missionary work. After discernment, he applied to be a missionary and was approved to join a religious group who would leave for Mexico in 1581. He worked there for nearly three years. At that time a missionary`s ultimate goal was China and Japan with the Philippines as a stopover for refueling. He arrived in Manila in 1584 and immediately gave himself to missionary work.\n\nIn his missions in the Philippines, he chose the poor and needy environments. He visited them, took care of the sick, built houses, schools and hospitals. Pedro Bautista and his confreres attended to the lepers and the poor. They became the advocate for the voiceless, abused and exploited. The Mexican historian Miguel León writes: “For the natives like the Franciscans because they walk barefoot and live as poor like us, eating what we eat, settling down with us, talking with us meekly … With their love and charity they attract both rich and poor …. Litigation or complaints were never found in the holy friars.”\n\nHe also taught music to children and adults from towns and parishes around Manila and was the first to organize a parish choir in the Philippines. He did not only organize them, but taught them how to use and make musical instruments made of bamboo. He became known for building the liturgical life of the people where ever he was assigned. He became the guardian of San Francisco de Manila in Intramuros. In 1586 he was made Parish Priest of Lumban, Laguna. Becoming Custos that same year, he was placed in charge of the Franciscans, who were spread from Bulacan to Sorsogon. He also became took care and ministered for the exiled Japanese Christians who were residing in Paco, Manila and formed a special group of Japanese in Paco Parish.\n\nOrganizing Towns\n\nPedro continued the Franciscans` work of gathering the Filipinos into towns. To him are due the first Franciscan buildings made of stone in the towns outside of Manila. It is interesting to note too that it was in the church of Lumban that the Franciscans first reserved the Blessed Sacrament outside of Manila (1600). He also developed some key locations in Luzon from Pakil, Los Baños, and other parts of Laguna provinces, some parts of Bicol Region, Candelaria, Quezon among others.\n\nBecause of his deep concern for the spiritual welfare of his friars and influenced by the Alcantarine spirituality, Pedro Bautista saw the need for a secluded place where the missionaries could revive their spiritual vigor by prayer, reflection and discipline.\n\nAfter a long search, he selected a site which would become San Francisco del Monte. It was opened as a house of retreat for the missionaries and as a novitiate house in 1590.\n\nHealer of the Sick and Defender of the Poor\n\nSan Pedro is the recognized founder of the hot springs in Los Baños, Laguna. He determined its medical element. He also strongly defended the rights of the indigenous peoples of Zambales. He affirmed their basic human rights and taught the slave drivers to recognize Gods dignity in their lives. It was his firm, moral stand that opened the peoples minds to the value of life.\n\nThe Japanese Expansionist Plan and Expidition\n\nIn the last decades of the sixteenth century, however, the Spanish presence was seriously\n\nthreatened. In 1586 an armed encounter between a group of Japanese pirates and colonial forces took place. The victory sided with the Spaniards, but given the ferocity of the Japanese and the weapons they used, the Spaniards feared the Japanese. In 1591, the Philippine authorities received a letter of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the shogun of Japan, also known as Taykosama with the following threat: “Recognize my power, because if you would not come to bow to me and prostrate before me, without doubt I will certainly send my army and I will destroy and lay you waste.”\n\nThe government immediately sent a party through the Dominican Father Juan Cobo in order to try to stop the expansionist impulses of Hideyoshi. But he died in Formosa, upon returning from his trip, without informing the authorities of Manila. Hideyoshi wrote a second letter as threatening as the first. The governor, aware that Manila was unprotected and indanger in case of an invasion, decided to send a second party to try to appease the irascible and ambitious shogun of Japan. The person chosen was Pedro Bautista. After overcoming initial difficulties, the party was organized immediately and on May 26, 1593 they began the journey to Japan. Pedro Bautista was accompanied by three friars, the priest Bartolome Ruiz, the lay brother Francisco de La Parrilla, and the lay brother Gonzalo Garcia as interpreter, and several lay Spanish and Japanese. The delegation was divided into two boats. The journey was much longer and more dangerous than expected. After a series of typhoons, on July 4, 1593, after 39 days at sea, the ship of Pedro Bautista entered the port of Hirado, a modest island northwest of Japan. The second boat went to Amakusa.\n\nThe Group before Hideyoshi\n\nThe meeting between the Franciscans and Hideyoshi, for reasons of Japanese protocol, occurred two months later, in October in Nagoya. The early moments were very tense. Hideyoshi spoke in a threatening tone, demanding that the rulers of Manila would give clear signs of submission. Pedro Bautista did not lose his composure for a moment, rejected the threats and refused to give evidence of submission. Finally Hideyoshi yielded to the peaceful attitude of Pedro Bautista. Impressed by his humility and extreme poverty, he promised to protect the Franciscans and even gave them a lot in Miyako (modern Kyoto), where they could build a convent and church. Six years earlier, in 1587, Hideyoshi had decreed the expulsion of all the Jesuits from Japan. The church in Japan was in a lamentable state, since the prohibition. He invited Pedro Bautista to visit him in Kyoto, home of the emperor, and the surrounding cities, Osaka, Sakay, Fushimi, etc. Before traveling to Kyoto, Pedro Bautista informed the Philippine authorities on the outcome of their meeting. The document would be signed two years later.\n\nThe Evangelization Efforts\n\nThe number of Christians at that time was about 6,000, from about 400,000 inhabitants. The challenge of evangelization offered Fray Pedro and his brothers was immense. Nevertheless, the missionaries were forced, for more than six months, to observe a discreet silence, limiting themselves to evangelize with their mere presence, a Franciscan method learned in their solitary convents in Spain. In 1595 Pedro Bautista and his brothers got to work. Soon they began to receive support and financial help from the people. He had insisted that both the church and the convent were opened on August 2, feast of the Our Lady of the Angels. But since the construction prevented the friars to spend sufficient time to pray, Pedro Bautista decided to postpone the opening to October 4, the feast of Saint Francis. Before that date, the second group of missionaries arrived from Manila.\n\nShortly after the inauguration of the convent and church, Pedro Bautista started to build Santa Ana Hospital especially designed to accommodate the lepers. Sometime later, to meet the needs of the population of Kyoto, he ordered the construction of a second hospital, which he called San José. Not satisfied with this, he decided to build a school for children to counteract the harmful influence of certain Buddhist pagodas. Not all were happy with the uplifting of the poor Japanese. Buddhists monks and merchants became wary of the friars` evangelizing works. In December 1594 Pedro Bautista started to build a convent in Nagasaki which served as the contact point with the Philippines. By March he met a very strong opposition in certain sectors of the city. With calm partially recovered, he returned to Kyoto in September, leaving behind some friars. In June 1596 another group of friars came. A small residence was established on Osaka named after Our Lady of Bethlehem.\n\nTowards Martyrdom\n\nThe wreck of a Spanish galleon in Tosa Bay was used by those against the Franciscans. Pedro Bautista tried to save the ship`s merchandise and to help the passengers. They gave false accusations to Hideoshi, who believed them. On December 8, 1596 Hideyoshi ordered the house arrest of Pedro Bautista and his friars in Japan.\n\nOn January 3, 1597, Pedro Bautista and his friars, along with catechists and helpers of the convent, to which Paul Miki, catechist of the Jesuits and two other assistants joined, were taken to the public jail of Kyoto and subjected to punishment cutting part of their left ears asa sign of shame. They were made to march through the cities of Kyoto, Fushimi, Osaka and Sakay and, in the Japanese winter, with tremendous snowfall, sometimes on foot, on horseback and on boats for a long journey of about 800 miles to the place of execution on top of the hill Nishizaka in Nagasaki.\n\nThe martyrdom of st. Pedro Bautista and companions.\n\nOn February 5, 1597 before thousands of people, the veracity of the prophetic words of Pedro Bautista to one of the friars was confirmed: “Brother, when we will be martyred for the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, then we will be truly evangelical preachers, and a dead martyr will do much more than many living preachers.”\n\nThe Beatification and Canonization\n\nIn 1598, an envoy from the Philippines was authorized by Hideyoshi to gather the last remains of the martyrs and their crosses. But the place soon became a place of pilgrimage and became known as Martyrs Hill. As soon as the news of their martyrdom came, the church bells of Intramuros and the bells of the churches that he established were runged immediately and “Te Deum” was sung afterwards.\n\nOn the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, September 14, 1627, Pope Urban VIII declared the Franciscan martyrs blessed. The Jesuits were later beatified in 1629.\n\nThe group of St. Pedro Bautista was canonized with his five fellow Franciscans Saints Martin de Asuncion, Felipe de Jesus, Francisco Blanco, Francisco de San Miguel and Gonsalvo Garcia, Seventeen Japanese laity composed of Saints Antony Dainan, Bonaventure of Miyako, Cosmas Takeya, Francisco of Nagasaki, Francis Kichi, Gabriel de Duisco, Joachim Sakakibara, John Kisaka, Leo Karasumaru, Louis Ibaraki (The youngest of the group), Matthias of Miyako, Michael Kozaki, Paul Ibaraki, Paul Suzuki, Pedro Sukejiroo, Thomas Kozaki and Thomas Xico and three Japanese religious brothers composed of Saints James Kisai, John Soan de Goto and Paul Mikiwere in 1862 by Blessed Pope Pius IX.\n\nThe Legacy that must be remembered\n\nEven though most of the martyrs were Franciscans (six Franciscan friars and seventeen collaborators), it was Paul Miki, the Japanese Jesuit, who has chosen as the leading figure to highlight that he is the first Japanese saint. But perhaps it would be better for us here in the Philippines to have this memorial as St. Pedro Bautista and Companions. However, in the Philippines, considering the legacy that he left in the country, St. Pedro Bautista was chosen to lead the group of the first Martyrs of Japan for their Memorial Masses.\n\nSt. Pedro Bautista is honored in the country with churches that were dedicated in his honor, notably the Parish of San Pedro Bautista in Candelaria, Quezon province and the the Santuario de San Pedro Bautista, the Church that he himself established as a retreat center dedicated to Nuestra Señora de los Angeles. The Santuario still preserves the cave that he once rested which is now known as the “Cueva Santa” that pilgrims visit up to this day. The Santuario was elevated as a Minor Basilica and the elevation rites took place on September 14, 2020 – The Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross.\n\nWith the exemplary and extraordinary life of St. Pedro Bautista, one needs to rethink on the perception of the Friars in the country. We have to re-examine our own history and not to rely much on our nationalistic tendencies for some actual facts might say otherwise. We have to stop the perpetuation of the propaganda that the people muddled to the Friars, for without these good friars, the nation will still be in the dark. In honoring Saint Pedro Bautista, we are showing not only gratitude to the legacy that he left to the nation but also seeing him as an example to work tirelessly on bring the Good News to others, even offering our lives for this noble cause.\n\nSan Pedro Bautista, Ipanalangin mo kami!\n\nReferences:\n\nDevotees of San Pedro Bautista (1982), “San Pedro Bautista : A Saint in the Philippines”, Santuario de San Pedro Bautista, Quezon City.\n\nRañoa, Andres B.OFM, The Life of San Pedro Bautista, Retreived from http://ofmphil.org/subpage.php subcatid=00000068&subpagetitle=LIFE%20OF%20SAN%20PEDRO%20BAUTISTA&catid=00000002&pagetitle=WHO%20ARE%20WE?.\n\nSan Antonio, Juan Francisco de. (1738), “Chronicas de la Apostolica Provincia de San Gregorio”, Convento de Ntra. Sra. de Loreto., Manila.\n\nWritten by James Malabanan and Bro. Christoffer Denzell Aquino, SHMI\n\nThe Philippines is known in the Catholic world as the “Pueblo Amante de Maria”, a Spanish phrase that literally means “Bayang Sumisinta kay Maria”, the People in love with Mary, the Filipino people have a very strong devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary since the Spanish period and it is proven to be resilient for centuries. For Filipinos, the images and their accompanying devotions to the Blessed Virgin Mary such as the Lady of the Rosary, the Immaculate Conception, the Lady of Mount Carmel, Our Mother of Perpetual Help, and several images based on different apparitions and attributes gained much popularity over the centuries and their shrines became the focal point of pilgrimages.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a rise in the devotion to the Childhood of the Blessed Virgin Mary more popularly known as the “La Niña Maria” through the efforts of the laity over the centuries, and the devotion to the Child Mary is gradually taking a stride and gaining much attention of Filipino Catholics. Parishes and chapels were now being dedicated in honor of the Child Mary, Confraternities, Associations, and other groups were founded to propagate the devotion to the Child Mary, and several Marian Devotees in the country began acquiring or commissioning an image of the Child Mary that is being enthroned to their parishes every September 8, the Feast of her Nativity and/or participation to different Marian exhibits, or simply for private devotion all over the country.\n\nBut one cannot help but wonder, where it all started and why there is a sudden rise of the devotion to the Child Mary in the country and what would be the future of this growing devotion in our country and the effects and lessons that we get from this devotion. But first, we should have a glimpse into the early life of the Blessed Virgin Mary and an in-depth study of this developing devotion to her childhood.\n\nThe Birth and Holy Childhood of the Blessed Virgin Mary\n\nMost of what we know about her childhood is based on the apocryphal Gospel from the Protoevangelium of Saint James, written around A.D. 125 and centuries later through the mystical writings of notable mystics like St. Bridget of Sweden, Blessed Anne Katherina Emmerich and Venerable Maria de Agreda who were favored with the visions of her childhood. From these works, we were able to have a glimpse of the early life of the Blessed Virigin Mary.\n\nAll holy authors mentioned that her parents are Saints Joachim and Anne who were known to live a holy life and were united by God and this union will be the prologue for the upcoming fulfillment of the plan of Salvation. However, as they aged, they were not able to have a child and they suffered much humiliation from the people at that time, childlessness was considered a punishment from God.\n\nOne day, Saint Anne, while praying for a child, was visited by the Angel Gabriel who conveyed the news that she would conceive the Mother of God, to be named “Mary.” This miraculous conception was linked to a passage from the Book of Genesis. We celebrate this event on December 8 as the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Saint Joachim also received this news and the holy couple reunited in the temple to thank God. They vowed to dedicate their child to the Holy Temple in Jerusalem.\n\nNine months later, Saint Anne miraculously gave birth to Mary without childbirth pains, and angels became her lifelong companions. A few days later, they named the child “Mary” in accordance with Jewish tradition.\n\nThe Infant Mary became an incredible blessing to the holy couple that they constantly praised God for such an extraordinary gift and a privilege to be chosen parents of the future Mother of the Redeemer. The infant did not cause many difficulties for her parents for she didn’t cry to get attention and she looked at her parents with respect. As she grows, she grows in sanctity and humility that other parents want their children to imitate Mary, and Child Mary becomes friends with all the children in her neighborhood. She lived an incredibly austere life in that she shunned fine clothing and anything that would cause vanity and would only prefer to wear a grayish-blue robe, eat frugal meals, and spend long hours on prayer and meditation.\n\nWhen the time came for her presentation in the temple, her parents could not hide their sorrow because they wouldn’t see their beloved daughter for she would render years of service as a Temple girl consecrated and dedicated to God’s service. Yet despite their sorrow, they were consoled by God for they know that this act will prepare her for her role as the Mother of God. In a Solemn ceremony that took place in Jerusalem, she was presented in the temple and was welcomed by the young temple girls, the elders, and her would-be teachers. On this day, she made her vow of chastity, poverty, and obedience and she performed her duties with humility and silence that she gained admiration from her teachers, priests, elders, and her fellow temple girls. She stayed in the Temple until her betrothal and marriage to her future husband Saint Joseph who belonged to the lineage of King David.\n\nThe origin of the devotion\n\nThe devotion to the Childhood of Mary began with the celebrations of the three feasts dedicated to her infancy, her naming, and her presentation in the temple. The Three feasts of the early years of the Blessed Virgin correspond in the Marian cycle with the first three feasts of Our Lord: Christmas, the Holy name of Jesus, and His Presentation in the Temple.\n\nAs Jesus is adored in His Divine Childhood, Mary is venerated in her childhood. The contemplation of the infancy of the woman chosen by God at the beginning of time to bring forth the Savior is an ancient practice; the Church celebrates her nativity every September 8th – one of only three birthdays so honored, the other two being those of Jesus and St. John the Baptist. All of these were born without the stain of original sin – with St. John having been filled with the Holy Ghost while in his mother’s womb (Luke 1:13-17, 44) — though only Jesus and Mary were conceived filled with grace.\n\nThe Feast of the Birth of Mary was first celebrated in the East by the Church of Jerusalem. In the fifth century, a Byzantine church was erected there, on the spot where a tradition says the house of Sts. Anne and Joachim once stood and became a focal point for her birthday celebration. Unfortunately, the original church was decimated during the Crusades. A new church was later built on that spot; this one still stands today and is a center of pilgrimage. The Catholic Church adopted this joyful feast in the seventh century by Pope Sergius I and the feast were celebrated every September 8.\n\nOn the other hand, the Feast of the Most Holy Name of Mary commemorates the day the Blessed Virgin was named a few days after her birth in accordance with Jewish Law. The Feast originated in Spain and was approved by the Holy See in 1513 then later extended to the whole Church by Pope Innocent XI in 1683 in thanksgiving to Our Lady for the Victory of John Sobieski, King of Poland, over the Turks, who were besieging Vienna and threatening the West.\n\nThe Feast of the Presentation of Mary is celebrated every November 21 is very ancient, going back to the sixth century in the Eastern Orthodox Church and it is one of the thirteen Great Feasts of the Church, often depicted in icons. The Catholic Church, however, did not adopt it until the fourteenth century.\n\nThe devotion of the Saints\n\nThere were saints who were also ardent devotees of the Child Mary in the course of their lives. Some of the most famous saints like the levitating Saint Joseph of Cupertino and the Twentieth Century Mystic Saint Padre Pio of Pietrelcina were known to own images of the Child Mary in their private oratories.\n\nIn the roster of the saints, four Founders of religious congregations were known for their devotion to the Child Mary, notably St. Hannibal Mary Di Francia of the Rogationist Order, Saint Jeanne de Lestonnac of the Order of the Company of Mary, and St. Bartolomea Capitanio and St. Vincenza Gerosa of the Sisters of Holy Child Mary\n\nSaint Hannibal Di Francia, from his childhood in Sicily, adored and venerated the child Mary passionately in all his homes. He had a deep affection for Mary, particularly under the title of Maria Bambina. He composed verses and hymns, singing them with outstretched arms. Father Francis Vitale shared that Saint Hannibal kept a small statue of Baby Mary in his room, pouring out his love at her feet.\n\nHe aspired to leave a lasting legacy within the Rogationist community and the Daughters of Divine Zeal, urging both the religious and seminarians to emulate the Child Mary. His goal was for every Rogationist and Daughter of Divine Zeal community to embrace Maria Bambinella, inspiring all to embody the virtues of purity, innocence, and simplicity that she symbolizes in their religious identity.\n\nAt the hour of his death, the Blessed Lady wanted to give him a sign of her heavenly approval of the devotion. One morning, a few days before his death, his face suddenly lit up and he stared out a point in the room, exclaiming as though rapt: “Brother, look!… Look how beautiful she is! Look at the beautiful child Mary!…” And he remained engrossed in the sweet vision. But the day of the good and faithful servant was now over. St. Hannibal died on June 1, 1927, and was Canonized in 2004 by Pope St. John Paul II.\n\nSaint Jeanne de Lestonnac is renowned for actively promoting devotion to the Child Mary. She introduced this practice by placing images of the Niña in schools run by her religious congregation and organizing devotional events, including processions and Marian observances, every November 21. This tradition began in 1610 at the first school she opened in Bordeaux, France. It was a way to express gratitude to God for their achievements despite challenges and to encourage students to dedicate their lives to the Lord through Mary’s intercession. Saint Jeanne desired that this Feast of the Presentation of Mary be celebrated in all Company of Mary schools indefinitely, becoming a lasting tradition. This tradition extended to Vigo, Spain, and Japan, where the Company of Mary established schools. Saint Jeanne passed away in 1640 and was canonized in 1949 by Pope Pius XII.\n\nSt. Bartolomea Capitanio and St. Vincenza Gerosa co-founded the Sisters of Holy Child Mary with a deep commitment to aiding the most impoverished and providing education for girls in need. Inspired by their devotion to the Child Mary, their unwavering dedication to this noble mission remains an inspiring testament to their compassion and devotion.\n\nThe devotion around the world\n\nDevotion to the Child Mary gained widespread popularity in Europe, particularly in Milan, Italy, and Malta. One of the most renowned representations of the Child Mary is the Maria Bambina of Milan, Italy, a wax statue of the Infant Mary known for its miraculous attributes. Crafted by a Franciscan nun before 1730, the statue passed through various hands before reaching the Sisters of Charity in Lovere, Italy. In 1876, it was brought to their motherhouse in Milan, showing signs of wear and turning gray over time.\n\nIn 1884, a nun named Sister Josephine Woinovich, afflicted with paralysis in her limbs, and a devout novice named Guilia Macaro, suffering from a severe condition restricting her movement, were both miraculously cured through the intercession of the Maria Bambina statue. Simultaneously, the image underwent a remarkable transformation, shedding its old gray color and taking on the appearance of living flesh, a characteristic it retains to this day. These miracles helped spread devotion to the Maria Bambina of Milan. On May 31, 1904, the image received a Canonical Coronation, attracting pilgrims from around the world to her shrine in Milan, making it the epicenter of devotion to the Child Mary worldwide.\n\nIn Senglea, Malta, there is a renowned shrine dedicated to the Child Mary, which has become the focal point of Maltese Marian devotion. The origin of the statue dates back to 1618 when, according to pious tradition, a statue of Our Lady was discovered floating amidst the wreckage of a galleon. The captain of an Austrian galley spotted the statue as they approached the Maltese islands, fished it out of the sea, and generously donated it to the nearest island, which happened to be Senglea in Malta.\n\nDevotion to the Child Mary in Senglea was particularly strong, especially during the month of September. This was due to significant historical events commemorated in the area, including the end of the Great Siege in 1565 when a church was erected in honor of the Virgin’s birth to mark the victory over the Ottoman Empire. Other events, such as the uprising against the French in 1798 and their subsequent withdrawal from the island, as well as the surrender of Fascist Italy in 1943, are also attributed to the Child Mary, venerated in her shrine in Senglea. The image received a Canonical Coronation on September 4, 1921.\n\nThe devotion to the Child Mary also reached Spain, through the help of the Sisters of the Company of Mary, the much-awaited festivities of November 21 – the Feast of the Presentation of Mary was the chosen day by the Congregation to honor her childhood in the 1600s. Every November 21, a procession is held by the students, alumni, and several Marian devotees in the area.\n\nDuring the day, young students offer flowers to Child Mary and the older ones would carry the “andas” where the image was placed and will wind the vicinity of the Colegio and some parts of Vigo. Once the procession is done, the people will sing the hymn “Celestial Niña” and a Holy Mass will follow afterward. This moving tradition in Vigo shows the lasting devotion of the students and the people to the Child Mary.\n\nAn Apparition in Mexico\n\nSometime in the Eighteenth Century, the devotion to the Child Mary was given special approval from heaven through a little-known apparition of the Blessed Virgin, known as La Divina Infantita, where she appeared to a Mexican religious as a Child. On January 6, 1840, the Feast of the Epiphany of Our Lord, Sister Magdalena de San José, a Franciscan Conceptionist sister, knelt before a nativity scene in her convent in Mexico City, contemplating the Christ Child in the manger. An inspiration came to her during her prayers that there would be a similar devotion that would be accorded to the Child Mary. Suddenly, a lovely little girl appeared before her, dressed like a tiny princess and reclining in thin air Sister Magdalena immediately knew that this beautiful child was the Virgin Mary, appearing to her in the form of a baby. The Infant Mary spoke to her giving her promise to those who will have a devotion to her Childhood: “I will grant great graces to whoever honors me in my infancy”.\n\nThe astonished nun went to the abbess and told her of her vision and her desire to promote devotion to little Mary. The abbess did not quite share Sister Magdalena’s excitement, so the devotion was not promoted right away. But Magdalena kept praying for God to bring it about. Eventually, Sister Magdalena did receive permission to ask a local sculptor to fashion a statue of the Infant Mary. Once she received the image she began to spread the devotion. Many people experienced miracles through the intercession of Little Mary, but others questioned the suitability of such a devotion yet it after years of careful study, Pope Gregory XVI approved the devotion and even granted indulgences to those who practiced it in 1846.\n\nThe devotion in the Philippines\n\nThe devotion to the Child Mary in the Philippines was first introduced by the Spanish Missionaries in the country, however only as a part of the devotion to her mother Saint Anne where she is venerated particularly in her National Shrine in Hagonoy, Bulacan, Taguig City, and Molo, Iloilo. These images of the Child Mary are often depicted as a child reading or holding a book, leaning or gazing at her mother.\n\nSome years later, the devotion to the Child Mary would soon take the stage with the existence of the oldest known venerated image of the Child Mary in the country located in Sariaya, Quezon Province. This petite ivory image of La Niña Maria was owned by the rich spinster philanthropist Doña Margarita Rodriguez. The image is vested in a golden metal garment, and embellished with precious stones, a set of jewels made of precious stones adorn the image.\n\nThe devotion to the Niña Maria in Sariaya was surrounded with much pomp and devotion that the fiesta for the Child Mary begins on September 12, the Feast of the Most Holy Name of Mary, and ends on September 15. The roving “Banda ng Musiko”, mostly from the lake shore towns of Laguna and Rizal provinces, were only hired from the “bisperas” on September 12th to the fiesta day itself the 14th, after which they leave for their respective hometowns. By the 15th, people were already that tired and weary of all the frenzied preparations of the past few days but Doña Margarita Rodriguez had yet to pay traditional reverence to her beloved little lady.\n\nIt even had its own landholdings or “Bienes”, which saw to its maintenance and upkeep, particularly for its Feast day. Accordingly, it was only a wooden replica that was always included in the procession of September 13th and 14th, as the original image came out in all its finery and splendor only during its Fiesta of September 15th. Surrounding its carroza would be a retinue of loyal caretakers or the “Katiwala” who would see to the security and welfare of their beloved icon. By then, Doña Margarita had already hired two or so of the “Banda ng Musiko” to stay, roam around town, and provide rousing and lively music for the whole day.\n\nAnother traditional attraction of the Niña Maria Fiesta was the presence of an all-female choir during the Holy Mass, its members coming from affluent families. Accordingly, they were even trained and practiced by a professor or alumnus from different music schools in the country. They wore lovely and appropriate custom-made dresses, the same cut and in one tone, which complimented their beautiful and inspiring performance. During the procession, Doña Margarita would always be at the balcony of her old house along Calle Rizal, waiting for the procession to pass by, and where she beamed with satisfaction and reverence at the sight of it all thereafter. As the procession ended at the churchyard, the big fireworks display courtesy of the Chinese community of Sariaya would commence, capping up the three-day festivities to the thrill and ultimate satisfaction of the townspeople.\n\nMoreover, the wooden replica of the Ninya Maria was kept at the house of the good matriarch along Rizal Street, which was hailed in town in the old days as the “Patroness of Safe childbirth”. As such, pregnant women visit the house to light candles for the very purpose, and even if the “Ang Garita” as she was known was not in her house, the servants were accordingly instructed to let the pregnant faithful in to do as the old tradition bid them. So much so that due to the popularity of the devotion to the Niña Maria in Sariaya an image of her was enthroned at the main retablo of St. Francis of Assisi Parish in Sariaya, Quezon.\n\nHowever, the tradition came to a halt when the house of Doña Margarita was caught in a devastating fire in 1951, The original image was kept by the family for safe keeping and a replica was soon commissioned.\n\nThough the grand old fiesta tradition halted, the devotion never waned a church dedicated to the Niña Maria was established years later in Castañas, Sariaya, Quezon and as of this writing, the only parish in the Philippines dedicated to the Child Mary. In keeping with the old traditions of Sariaya, the fiesta is celebrated every September 12, the Feast of the Holy Name of Mary.\n\nAside from the parish dedicated to the Child Mary in Sariaya, there were two parishes and a Cathedral dedicated to the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, namely the oldest one in Pangil, Laguna, and the most recent in Industrial Village in Marikina City and the Cathedral of Natividad de Nuestra Señora in Borongan, Samar.\n\nAside from the famed devotion to Nuestra Señora de la O and Santo Niño de la O, Pangileños also developed a devotion to their titular patroness, Nuestra Señora de la Natividad where a relief image of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary is venerated. The town of Pangil, Laguna was founded by Franciscan priests Padre Juan de Plasencia and Padre Diego de Oropesa in 1579 and was administered by the nearby Lumban due to a lack of priests. The first church dedicated to the Nativity of Mary was built out of cane and a relief image of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin was installed for public veneration. In 1611, a stone church and convent were built under the direction of Father Gonzalo del Roble.\n\nRestoration of the church’s woodwork and improvement of the convent was done by Father Lucas Fernandez in 1711. The church was remodeled from 1749 to 1751 by Father Luis de Nambroca.\n\nAnother parish that is dedicated to the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin is located in the modern confines of the Industrial Village in Marikina City. Early in the 1950s, Marikina became one of the most industrial places in Rizal (Marikina was once part of Rizal until it became part of the National Capital Region) and with the increase of the inhabitants of Industrial Village, a need for spiritual nourishment was felt. The area was then part of the jurisdiction of the Parish of Our Lady of the Abandoned in San Roque, Marikina City and they wanted to have their own place of worship in the village that they found a vacant lot where they can hold Masses on Sundays.\n\nThe first Mass in the village took place on September 3, 1697, which was at that time a part of preparations for the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary the devotion to her Infancy was fostered, and a provisionary chapel was erected and the land was later donated by Gerardo Ozeta, the owner of the property as requested by the homeowners association in the village. The cornerstone for a permanent chapel was laid by Msgr. Jose B. Cruz and Father Henneken were attended by the high officials of Marikina and the chapel was completed and later inaugurated on September 8, 1968, and was later became a parish in 1992.\n\nIn Borongan, Samar, the seat of the Diocese of Borongan, the Cathedral of Borongan was dedicated to the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The Church was established prior to 1710 by Fr. Francisco Diez, SJ. The image of Our Lady, which came from Europe, is said to contain a reliquary with a hair strand of the Virgin Mary. In 1961, the church became the seat of the Diocese of Borongan, and Our Lady was made titular of the diocese. The feast of Our Lady is celebrated every 8th of September. On the Feast of the Birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the people of Borongan celebrate the Padul-Ong festival where the festival commemorates the day they received the image of the Blessed Virgin.\n\nThe Filipino Catholic Laity and the propagation of the devotion at present\n\nThough there were parishes that were dedicated to the Child Mary, devotion was not that popular in the entire country. However, from the colonial period up to the modern times, the Filipino Catholic laity played an important part in the propagation of the devotion to the Child Mary in the country by commissioning images of the Child Mary for private devotions, expositions to different Marian Exhibits and foundations and Confraternities to support the propagation of the cultus of the Child Mary.\n\nOne of the pioneer propagators of devotion in modern times was Rei Nicolas who commissioned a beautiful image of La Niña Maria from the renowned ecclesiastical artist Willy Layug in 1992 that graced some notable Marian exhibits in the country.\n\nAnother development in the devotion to the La Niña Maria was in the year 2000 when the chapel of Our Lady of Remedies in Ligas, Malolos, Bulacan held its first Marian exhibit that features different images of the Blessed Virgin Mary from all over Bulacan and other parts of the country.\n\nThe main Festejada of the exhibit is the image of La Niña Maria de Ligas where the image depicts a joyful Child Mary extending her arms while she is standing on a serpent which alludes to her Immaculate Conception. While the exhibit is ongoing, novena masses are being held in preparation for the Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and on September 8, a procession of the Child Mary is held in honor of her Nativity.\n\nOne of the most recent developments in the devotion to the Child Mary in the Philippines is the foundation of the Confradia de La Niña Maria de Santa Isabel in 2013 at St. Elizabeth of Hungary Parish in Sta. Isabel, Malolos, Bulacan. The Confradia was formed for the purpose of the propagation of the devotion to the Child Mary in the form of holding the bi-annual Marian Exhibit in the convento of the centuries-old parish in Malolos, Bulacan, and other devotions and novena masses to honor the birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The beautiful image of La Niña Maria de Santa Isabel was commissioned by Catalina Dionisio vda de Domingo to Alberto Panganiban in 2014, a year after the foundation of the Confradia that will serve as the Festejada image every September 8.\n\nThe image was made of batikuling wood and stands at 75 centimeters in height. The encarna of the Niña was done in “Estefado” style. As the years passed by, additional accessories were added to the image from her embroidered cape, tassels, and other accessories as ex-votos from previous Hermano Mayors of recent years. Three processions took place during the Novenario days for the Feast of her birth, the first “Prusisyon ng Dapit” which starts from the house of the Hermano Mayor going to the Parish, and another Dapit procession on the last day of the novena. The fiesta procession together with the images that were featured in the Marian exhibit caps the festivities.\n\nOn November 21, 2024, Feast of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the image of La Niña Maria of Santa Isabel is formally enthroned permanently at the side altar of Santa Isabel de Unggaria Parish in Malolos, Bulacan for further promotion and propagation of the devotion to the now-famous image of the Child Mary in Bulacan.\n\nSome Recommendations on the Devotion to the Child Mary\n\nWith the recent developments in the devotion to the La Niña Maria in the country, numerous images and religious practices that surround the devotion increased over the years. However, as the images of the Infant and Child Mary increased in numbers, there were some concerns raised regarding the iconography of the Infant and Child Mary from the way she is vested, the objects that she is holding and wearing, the titles that were given to the image among others that criticisms sometimes rose that they would often comment that they are treating the image of the Child Mary as a doll, not a holy image which is something that should be avoided at all cost.\n\nSince we got a glimpse of the early life of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as seen by mystics that were mentioned earlier in this article, we should keep in mind that she lived a life of humility, simplicity, purity, mortification, and obedience that is incomprehensible to today’s standards and depictions of the Child Mary should be reflected on the life that she lived. Having this in mind, it can be suggested that an image of the Child Mary can be dressed in a simple yet dignified manner that would reflect on her way of life.\n\nHowever, some devotees would prefer to present the Child Mary in a grand and royal fashion in line with her dignity as the Queen of Heaven and Earth. We have to keep in mind if the image will be fashioned this way, it must be done with restraint so that there will be a balance of her portrayal as a humble and holy child yet her dignity as the Queen of Heaven and Earth intact.\n\nNow with regards to the manner of presentation of the image from holding different objects and presenting her based on her different attributes, as what the late Rei Nicolas would suggest, the Child Mary should only hold a sheaf of lilies, which symbolized her purity, (in some cases, roses takes place in lieu of the lilies), a book or a scroll since the Virgin did study sacred writings of the Patriarchs and Prophets during her early years from her parents until her time of service in the Temple. For the Feast of the Presentation of Mary, the Virgin can hold a candle since, according to Jewish tradition, candles are held by the child or by her parents during the rite of the Presentation. It is strongly suggested that the image should not hold a rosary, a scapular, medals, or other sacramentals since those sacred objects did not exist during her time and she would give them to different saints in the future through her appearances to several saints.\n\nAlso, it is discouraged to depict her as a younger version of her apparitions (e.g. Guadalupe, Lourdes, Fatima. etc.) and some of her attributes (e.g. Mater Dolorosa) that she would later gain as she grows up and receives her eternal and glorious reward for we need to remember that in depicting the Child Mary, she is depicted during the early years of her life on earth. The image of the Child Mary can sport a royal crown or crown of flowers and “doce estrellas” since these were the traditional attributes of the Virgin and it is a fact that there were images of the Child Mary given Canonical Coronation, like that in Senglea, Malta. On giving the title for the image, it can be suggested that the title must be as simple as “La Niña Maria” or any appropriate title that is related to her life events as a child or acceptable titles based on her attributes.\n\nWith regards to the Feasts related to the early years of the Blessed Virgin Mary that are kept in the current Liturgical Calendar; her birth on September 8, her Most Holy Name on September 12, and her presentation on November 21, these feast days should not be overlooked and should be treated with equal importance. These feast days commemorate a few yet key events in the early life of the Blessed Virgin that foreshadows the life of Christ and also a way to honor God for his greatness out of his great love for us, he chose the Blessed Virgin Mary to be the Mother of our Redeemer.\n\nOn the images that will be used for these Feasts, it is encouraged that for the Feast of her birth every 8th of September, the image of the Infant Maria should be utilized since we are celebrating the traditional date of her birth. However, in some cases, the Niña Maria image could be used if the image of the Infant Mary is unavailable or it is already the norm in some parishes with respect to the existing traditions of such parishes in the country.\n\nThe Feast of her Holy Name and Presentation, this is where the image of the Child Mary can be exposed for public veneration, most specifically on the Feast of her Presentation on November 21 for it was on this feast that according to tradition, she was a child when she was presented in the temple to serve and learn from the priests and elders and, in a way, a preparation for her participation in the plan of Salvation.\n\nThese suggestions were done in line with the recommendations from the Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy, Paragraph 18 on the utilization of these images for public veneration which states that: “The use of sacred images is of major importance in the whole area of popular piety since culturally and artistically, they assist the faithful in encountering the mysteries of the Christian faith (…) Here, the principles apply which govern the liturgical use of images of Christ, Our Lady, the angels, and Saints.” Also, the same paragraph expressed that “So as to ensure that the iconography used in sacred places is not left to private initiatives, those with responsibility for churches and oratories should safeguard the dignity, beauty, and quality of those sacred images exposed for public veneration.”\n\nThe future of the devotion\n\nSo what could be the future of the devotion of the Child Mary in the Philippines?\n\nOne way or another, with the rise of numerous Marian exhibits that are carefully curated, or otherwise, these expositions unconsciously helped spread the devotion to the Child Mary and this was solidified with the foundation of Confraternities and associations that aims to spread the devotion.\n\nIf we are looking at the recent developments on the devotion to the Child Mary, with thorough research done on the life of the Virgin in her younger years, the existing devotions to the Child Mary around the world which is one touch away from our own disposal, from the existing traditions in our own country and proper spiritual guidance from priests who knew much on Marian devotion, the devotion can stand the test of time and will gain more popularity and a strong devotional following.\n\nWe should always keep in mind that the veneration of the Child Mary is one of the ways of honoring the Blessed Virgin Mary who became the Mother of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the World. She even endorsed this devotion in her apparition in Mexico, where she promised great graces to those who honor her infancy, which the faithful should not take for granted. By having devotion to the Child Mary, we are also praising God for his works of sending His Son to the World through the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the devotion to her infancy and childhood challenges us to imitate the virtues that she practiced even in her childhood years. If we are able to imitate her virtues, this will please God and He in turn will grant us the necessary graces we need in our daily lives.\n\nO La Niña Maria, Ipanalangin mo kami!\n\nReferences:\n\n“A Corollary Devotion: Maria Bambina”(2007), Retrieved on July 8, 2016 from https://www.fisheaters.com/childjesus.html.\n\nCatholic Church., & International Committee on English in the Liturgy.

If we are looking back at our own history, one might be surprised that our actual Secondary Patroness of the country were two: the Roman Martyr Santa Potenciana, and the First Saint of the Americas, St. Rose of Lima.\n\nThough it is quite unlikely that she will be named as such yet if we look in our history, the Philippines was once considered as part of the Americas and when she was declared as the Patroness of the Americas, she was also declared as the Secondary Patroness in our country. Now we should have a look on the life of Santa Rosa de Lima and on how she became our Secondary Patroness and the enduring devotion of the Filipinos to her.\n\nThe Visage of Americas’ Rose\n\nThe images of St. Rose of Lima is depicted as a Dominican Tertiary wearing the habit of a Professed Religious of the Order. She wears a crown of roses and holds a bouquet or sheaf of roses which became her diagnostic symbols due to the face she was nicknamed “Rosa” since as her biography tells that her cheeks were red as rose and a rose fell on it, hence the name. Oftentimes, she holds the Child Jesus in her arms\n\nThe Life of a Beautiful Rose\n\nIsabel de Santa Maria de Flores was born at Lima, Peru in 1586 of Spanish Indian parents and took the name of Rose at confirmation. At a very early age, she made Saint Catherine of Siena her model and was particularly devoted to the Virgin Mary. Noted for her beauty, she resisted her parents’ efforts to have her marry and at a very early age made a vow of virginity, a resolution in which she persevered until death, despite the misunderstanding and persecution of her family.\n\nShe inflicted on herself, terrifying penances and suffered long periods of dryness and desolation, which were, however, balanced by many extraordinary graces culminating in the Mystical Espousals.\n\nAt the age of 20, Saint Rose became a member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic. She continued to live at home, assisting her impoverished family by doing needlework and raising flowers for the market. She likewise cared for the poor and sick of the area in an empty room of their house. Her garden became the spiritual center of the city.\n\nThe Rose of the Child Jesus\n\nOn several occasions, the Child Jesus became part of the life of St. Rose. It was the Christ Child who taught her how to read and write and when she takes care of the seek, she asked her patients to pray before the image of the Child Jesus in her “hospital” and numerous cures were reported that they refer to the image as “El Doctorcito” (The Little Doctor). One of the most outstanding during those encounters with the Child Jesus is that years before her death, the Child Jesus appeared to her and ask her to be His spouse that led to her Mystical Marriage.\n\nHer Passing\n\nIn ill health, she accepted the offer of Don Gonzalo de Massa and his wife to take care of her and she spent the last three years of her life in their home in Lima. So widespread was her reputation for sanctity that when Saint Rose died, on August 23, 1617, the day which she herself has predicted, the throngs of devotees surrounding her bier made it almost impossible to bury her.\n\nAn eyewitness account of a noble lady with a good reputation in Lima states that hours after the death of Sta. Rosa, she saw her beautiful soul raising up to heaven and suddenly, heaven opened, saw a golden gate and Jesus and Mary welcomed her and some Holy Virgin saints from Sts. Gertrude the Great, Catherine of Alexandria, Barbara and Teresa of Avila accompanied Rosa to the Holy gate and entered to Eternal Paradise. This account was verified and accepted during the inquiries for Rosa’s beatification and Canonization.\n\nThe remains of Saint Rose lie in the Convent of Santo Domingo, located on the corner of Jirón Camaná and Jirón Conde de Superunda in the historic center of Lima (one block from Lima’s Plaza de Armas). Her remains are enshrined in that convent together with those of St. Martin de Porres and St. Juan Macias, the two fellow Lay Dominicans who became her friends and invoked as the Great Patron Saints of Peru.\n\nHer Beatification and Canonization\n\nFifty years later, on April 15, 1667, she was beatified by Pope Clement IX and was canonized, along with St. Luis Beltran, on April 12, 1671 by Pope Clement X. Rose became the first Saint in the Americas to be declared a saint. Her liturgical feast was inserted into the General Roman Calendar in 1729 for celebration initially on August 30, because August 24, the date of her death, is the feast of Saint Bartholomew the Apostle and August 30 was the closest date not already allocated to a well-known saint. Pope Paul VI’s 1969 revision of the calendar made August 23 available, the day on which her feast day is now celebrated throughout the world, including Spain, but excluding Peru and some other Latin American countries, where August 30 is a public holiday in her honor.\n\nThe Patronage of the Philippines\n\nOn August 11, 1670, Pope Clement X issued the Bull “Sacrosancti apostolatus cura” confirming his earlier declaration of then Blessed Rose of Lima as patroness of Peru , and extending her patronage to each province, realm, and region of the whole American continent, of the Philippines, and of the Indies. Quoting the Bull:\n\n“…I, Clement, (…) proclaims Blessed Rosa de Santa Maria (the saint’s religious name) as the principal patroness of individual provinces and countries, islands and areas of the Americas, the Philippines, and the Indies, with the same prerogatives of the designated autority, notwithstanding.””\n\nThe devotion in the Philippines\n\nThe devotion was brought in the Philippines through the efforts of the Dominicans in the country and once she was canonized, several churches were dedicated in her honor and almost immediately, images of the saint became popular in the colony.\n\nSta. Rosa de Lima of the La Naval de Manila procession\n\nOne of the most popular images of St. Rose of Lima in our country is that of her processional image in the famed La Naval de Manila Processions. This particular image of Santa Rosa de Lima was one of the images that was, and still is, part of the original roster of Dominican Saints that is processed in the streets of Old Intramuros. The image survived the bombings and still can be seen in the annual October processions of the La Gran Señora de Filipinas.\n\nOne of the most popular stories about Santa Rosa in Old Manila is that during the sack of the city by the British in 1762, Madre Paula de la Santisima Trinidad assured the Beatas from the Beaterio y Casa Enseñanza (Colegio de Sta. Rosa, Intramuros) the protection of their patron saint. A group of British soldiers barged into the convent and one of them attempted to rape a beata. The woman fought hard forcing the soldier to draw his sword to kill her. Suddenly, before their very eyes, unseen hands twisted and bent the blade of the sword. Frightened out of their wits, the soldiers fled in terror leaving the sword behind. It was said that the twisted sword was on display in the convent before the building was destroyed during the Second World War.\n\nSta. Rosa de Lima of Pasig City\n\nOther notable places where St. Rose is the Patroness were in Bagong Ilog, Pasig City and Santa Rosa, Laguna. The image of Santa Rosa de Lima in Bagong Ilog, Pasig City was a small image of the sant that is revered by the area as miraculous. Her discovery was shrouded with mystery where one day, two friends who are both fishermen, one from Sumilang (Celestino Cruz) and another from Bagong Ilog (Ubaldo Intalan) visited a beautiful girl in Mandaluyong. Going there, they tried avoiding the cave as they heard frightening stories about the place. However, they had to gather fire wood on their way back. This is the reason why they decided to go near the cave where wood was plentiful and just scattered around.\n\nWhile doing so, they were surprised to smell a very fragrant scent all over the place, seemingly from a dame de noche flower. They started searching where the scent was coming from. They were astounded to see emerging lights from inside the cave and decided to go inside it. Astoundingly, they saw a very beautiful image which they didn’t recognize at first. Similar to a pirate who found a chest full of golds and diamonds, the two friends immediately and happily brought their newfound discovery to Bagong Ilog. There, they found out that the image was of Sta. Rosa of Lima, Peru. It is believed that through the guidance of the Lord Jesus Christ, He has led Sta. Rosa de Lima to be discovered by the fishermen to guide the people of both barangays.\n\nSanta Rosa de Lima of Santa Rosa, Laguna\n\nAnother place where the devotion to her is known was in Santa Rosa, Laguna, one of the earliest places were the devotion to St. Rose of Lima flourished. The Dominican missionaries who arrived in the town was then a barrio of Biñan, and was named “Bucol” because some of the southern parts were hilly was headed by Fray Francisco Favie of the Dominican Order andbrought with them the Peruvian saint’s memory and legacy. And when the said barrio separated from Biñan some time in the late 1600s, it was renamed after Saint Rose of Lima. But the municipality itself was formally founded on January 15, 1792.\n\nThe church of Santa Rosa was made of solid adobe stones with lime and mortar mixed with albumin was constructed in 1796 and blessed on August 4, 1812. The first Mass was held on August 30, 1812 in honor of the Patron Saint, with Fray Francisco Favie, O.P the first Parish Priest and the devotion became part of the lives of the people of Santa Rosa, Laguna.\n\nSanta Rosa de Lima was believed to have watched over the people and protected them during the Japanese occupation. Several evacuees that time have been saved from hunger through the miraculous appearance of a mysterious lady in a black and white habit which they later discovered it was their patroness who went down to her altar to help her people.\n\nThe devotion\n\nThe devotion and the Patronage of St. Rose of Lima might not be as known to most Filipinos yet to her devotees in some parts of the country, they have seen and experienced the powerful protection and intercession of this beautiful First Saint of the Americas that we should not taken for granted. In these times of tribulation in our society, we must also invoked her intercession to help us in our struggles and teach us to hate sin and vanity so we can meet our eternal reward in heaven.\n\nSanta Rosa de Lima, Ikalawang Patrona ng Pilipinas, Ipanalangin mo kami!\n\nReferences:\n\nClement X, (1670), “Sacrosancti apostolatus cura”, Retreived from https://deipraesidiofultus.blogspot.com/2013/05/protectresses-of-philippines.html?m=0.\n\nDagohoy, Herminio, (2007), The Saga of La Naval, Triumph of the People’s Faith, Dominican Province of the Philippines, Quezon Avenue, Quezon City.\n\nJoaquin, Nick (1979), Almanac for Manilenos, Mr. & Mrs., Manila\n\nRen, Lili (1993), Rose, The flower of Latin America, Translated by Leticia Deriada, Paulinian Publications, St. Paul Road, Makati City.\n\nSanta Rosa City, Laguna – The Lion City of the South (2012) https://starosacitylaguna.wordpress.com/history/.\n\nSanta Rosa de Lima Parish – A Brief History (2005), Retreived from http://sta.rosadelimaparish.tripod.com/id4.html."
