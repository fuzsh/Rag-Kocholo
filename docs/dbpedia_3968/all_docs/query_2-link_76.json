        "text": "St. Andrew the Apostle Church is a Roman Catholic church located in San Andres, Romblon, Philippines.\n\nHistory\n\nThe old name of the town was Parpaguha after a bird that nested among its forestland. It was then called Salado when the Spaniards came. Then much later, it was renamed Despujols after Spanish Governor General Eulogio Despujol. Finally, it was called San Andres by virtue of Republic Act No. 3358 on June 18, 1961.\n\nThe church was established in 1975.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe church is a low-level building that is almost cubist in style by its squat facade, walls, and bell tower. The tower is located in the epistle side. The name of the parish is spelled in the overhang by the entrance, and above is an arch that contains the image of the patron.\n\nCelebration\n\nThe feast day of St. Andrew the Apostle is November 30.\n\nMass schedule\n\nBelow is the weekly mass schedule of St. Andrew the Apostle Church in San Andres, Romblon from August 26, 2024 to September 1, 2024.
