        "text": "The Anglican Communion began in England and spread through colonisation and missionary work. Although it has historically been largest in former British colonies, it has a strong presence throughout the world, especially in Africa. See our Africa page for dioceses and parishes there.\n\nThis page lists those areas of the Anglican Communion without a large enough web presence to warrant a page of their own. As always, we list every province, diocese, or parish that we know about, which has a web page. (See our 'Notes on Structure' for more detail.) This page is arranged by country, in alphabetical order. See the table to choose the country of your interest.\n\nAnglican Resources Around the World are listed separately at the end.\n\nAbu Dhabi Bolivia El Salvador Iraq New Caledonia Qatar Trinidad and Tobago Antigua Brazil Falkland Islands Israel Nicaragua St Helena Turkey Argentina Chile Fiji Jamaica Norfolk Island St Kitts and Nevis United Arab Emirates Armenia Colombia Guam Jordan Oman Saipan Uruguay Aruba Cook Islands Guatemala Korea Pakistan Samoa Vanuatu Bahamas Costa Rica Guyana Kuwait Panama Singapore Venezuela Bahrain Cuba Haiti Laos Papua New Guinea Sri Lanka (Ceylon) Virgin Islands Bangladesh Cyprus Honduras Lebanon Paraguay Solomon Islands Windward Islands Barbados Dominican Republic India Malaysia Peru Taiwan Yemen Belize Dubai Indonesia Mexico Philippines Thailand B Bermuda Ecuador Iran Myanmar Puerto Rico Tonga B\n\nProvinces that include more than one country\n\nMany provinces do not yet have web sites.\n\nThe Province of the Central American Region\n\nThe Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East (The Province includes four self-governing Dioceses: Jerusalem, Egypt, Iran, Cyprus and the Gulf.)\n\nThe Province of Melanesia\n\nEpiscopal Church in the USA Province IX\n\nThe Province of South East Asia\n\nThe Anglican Church of South America (Iglesia Anglicana de Sudamérica)\n\nThe Province of the West Indies\n\nCountry, Dioceses, Parishes\n\nThe following list is ordered alphabetically by country. We list every country, but we don't list individual dioceses unless they have web pages. In places where Christians are not a large fraction of the population, a diocese can span more than one country. In places where Anglicans are not a large fraction of the population, a province can span more than one country. In the remaining cases there is a province or autonomous church associated with the country. If the country has a province or autonomous church, we link the name of the country to it.\n\nIf you know of a web site that should be listed here and is not, please tell us.\n\nIf you represent a church or diocese that would like to have a web page, please see The Society of Archbishop Justus web hosting. This is the organisation that sponsors Anglicans Online, and if your web page should be listed here, they might be able to sponsor you, too.\n\nThe authoritative source of this information is the Anglican Communion Office in London. We check their information regularly and make sure that ours corresponds to it. Should you note any discrepancies, please tell us. Our information differs from theirs in that we list in order by country, and we include links to web pages; they list in order by province.\n\nLinks to all administrative components of the entire Anglican church on the ANGLICAN.ORG web site are here.\n\nABU DHABI: The Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East\n\nDiocese of Cyprus and the Gulf\n\nAbu Dhabi, St Andrew\n\nANTIGUA: Church in the Province of the West Indies\n\nARGENTINA: The Anglican Church of South America (Iglesia Anglicana de Sudamérica)\n\nDiocese of Argentina\n\nQuilmes, Iglesia de Todos los Santos\n\nDiocese of Northern Argentina\n\nARMENIA: Diocese in Europe\n\nARUBA: The Province of the West Indies\n\nBAHAMAS: The Province of the West Indies\n\nDiocese of The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands\n\nChrist Church Cathedral, Nassau\n\nAndros Island, Parish of St Stephen, Central Andros [St Bartholomew, Behring Point; St Peter, Bowen Sound; St Paul, Calabash Bay; St Stephen, Fresh Creek; St Faith, Staniard Creek]\n\nCenterville, New Providence, Nassau, St George\n\nEast New Providence, Church of the Epiphany\n\nEight Mile Rock, Grand Bahama, St Stephen\n\nGrant's Town, New Providence, St Agnes\n\nNassau, Christ the King\n\nNassau, St George\n\nNassau, St Mary The Virgin\n\nNassau, St Matthew\n\nNassau, St Ambrose of Milan\n\nNassau, St Barnabas\n\nNew Providence (Soldier Road), Nassau, Holy Cross\n\nNew Providence, St Anne\n\nRidgeland Park, Christ the King\n\nStapleton Gardens, Parish Church of Holy Trinity\n\nSt George Town, St Andrew Parish Church [St John-The-Baptist, Moss Town; St Margaret of Antioch; Harts; St Mary Magdalene, Williams Town; Holy Innocents, Ragged Island]\n\nBAHRAIN: The Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East\n\nDiocese of Cyprus and the GulfSt Christopher's Cathedral, Bahrain\n\nBANGLADESH is now listed here.\n\nBARBADOS: The Province of the West Indies\n\nDiocese of Barbados\n\nSt Michael's Cathedral, Bridgetown\n\nChrist Church, Christ Church\n\nChrist Church (Hastings), St Matthias\n\nPleasant Hall, All Saints\n\nSt James (Holetown), St James\n\nSt John, St John\n\nSt Michael, St Leonard\n\nSt Michael, Christ the King\n\nSt Michael, St Cyprian\n\nSt Michael, St Paul\n\nSt Peter, St Philip the Less\n\nBELIZE: The Province of the West Indies\n\nFriends Supporting the Anglican Diocese of Belize: 'formed to encourage each Belizean and his or her friends to support the educational mission of the Diocese'.\n\nDiocese of Belize\n\nBERMUDA: (extra-provincial to Canterbury)\n\nDiocese of Bermuda\n\nDevonshire, Christ Church\n\nHamilton, Holy Trinity Church St George, St Peter Smith's Parish, St Mark\n\nSouthampton, St Anne\n\nBOLIVIA: The Anglican Church of South America (Iglesia Anglicana de Sudamérica)\n\nDiocese of Bolivia\n\nSanta Cruz, Cristo Luz del Mundo (Bolivia)\n\nBRAZIL\n\nDiocese of the Amazon\n\nDiocese of Brasília\n\nDiocese of Curitiba\n\nCuritiba, Comunidade da Virgem Maria\n\nDiocese of Pelotas\n\nDiocese of Recife\n\nCathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, Recife\n\nNatal, Paróquia da Virgem Maria\n\nDiocese of Rio de Janeiro\n\nDiocese of São PauloCatedral Anglicana de São Paulo, São Paulo\n\nRegistro, Paróquia de Cristo Rei\n\nSao Paulo, Santa Cruz\n\nSao Paulo, Santissima Trinidade\n\nSao Paulo, Sao Joao\n\nDiocese of South Western Brazil\n\nCatedral do Mediador, Santa Maria\n\nDiocese of Southern Brazil\n\nCaxias do Sul, St Mary the Virgin\n\nCentro de Estudos Anglicanos.
