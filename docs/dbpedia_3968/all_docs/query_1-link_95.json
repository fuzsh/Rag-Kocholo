        "text": "Apo Lakay says:\n\nAlso and while in Zambales for Holy Week, there are four (4) MUST SEE images. Two are in Sta. Cruz; one in San Antonio; and one is in San Marcelino.\n\nIn Sta. Cruz., one is the famously obscure image of Sta. Maria Magdalena (St. Mary Magdalen) with massive ivory head and hands which no less authority than Martin I. Tinio ( in Jaime Laya's Consuming Passions, 2003) writes about. Tinio also makes special mention of the santa's silver andas which depicts faces of demons.\n\nThe Famous Demon Headed Andas\n\nSta. Maria Magdalena / St. Mary Magdalene\n\nRCC Parish of San Miguel Archangel / St. Michael the Archangel\n\nSta. Cruz, Zambales\n\nAgain according to Tinio (Laya, 2003), Sta. Cruz is also home to a tableaux of the \"Tercera Caida\". This \"Tercera Caida,\" in Tinio's well considred opinion, is probably the best extant example of the genre in the Philippines! Unfortunatly, I do not have a picture of the Sta. Cruz \"Tres Caidas\" as it only comes out on the Wednesday evening procession.\n\nThe third MUST SEE image is that of the Santo Nino Admiral of San Antionio. This is image is patterened after the Holy Infant of Cebu. The image is ancient and has ivory head and hands. However, it is possible that he is, maybe, made entirely of ivory. I must make sure the next time I am back in Zambales.\n\nTo see the Sto. Nino Admiral, pls go here: www.flickr.com/photos/tagtagainep19/5319696027/\n\nThe last of the MUST SEE images is that of Apo Lakay, the image of the Sto. Entierro or the Dead Christ, in the ICFI Church in San Marcelino. Apo Lakay is probably the oldest existing processional image in all of Zambales. He was made around 1848 at the behest of the Guiang and de Jesus Families. There are very few Sto. Entierros that can be dated to before the last quarter of the 19th century. \"Apo Lakay\" is one of them. This image remains untouched and unrestored at the behest of the people of San Marcelino. To them, he represents a strong link to the past wherein their own ancestors have joined in the tradition of venerating \"Apo Lakay\".\n\nApo Lakay\n\ncirca 1848\n\nICFI Parish of San Guillermo / Parish of St. William\n\nSan Marcelino, Zambales\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nTinio, M. I. \"Where have all the Santos gone?\" in Laya, J. Ed. (2003). Consuming Passions: Philippine Collectibles. Anvil Publishing: Manila. pp. 66 - 68.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nApo Lakay edited this topic ages ago.\n\nApo Lakay says:\n\nAnother fact that many people do not realize is that Zambales is one of the oldest province in all of the Philippines. It was immediately organized as a province upon its founding in the early 1600s. By all accounts, Zambales is the third province to be organized in the island of Luzon (Vance, 1980).\n\nZambales boast many outstanding churches. Unfortunately, many of them have been renovated beyond recognition and thus have lost many of their vestigial colonial aspects. Five churches, however, remain true to their colonial architecture and are landmarks in the Zambales artistic and cultural patrimony. Ranked according to their importance, they are the churches of: Masinloc, Iba, Botolan, Sta. Cruz and San Marcelino.\n\nThe Church of Masinloc:\n\nRCC Church of San Andres Apostol / San Andrew the Apostle\n\nMasinloc, Zambales\n\nConstruction started around 1607 using local materials and coralstone.\n\nInterior renovated 2005 - 2009 under the direction of the Philippine National Museum Historical Conservation and Restoration department.\n\nThis church directly faces the sea. The church is massive and you really get a feel for what it was intially intended to be... a fortress church in which besieged local citizens can take shelter in times of war or raiding parties of marauding Chinese, Muslim and even Dutch pirates!\n\nAnother interesting fact about this church is that the Coro (or choirloft) contains a fresco mural that is unique in the Philippines. Engr. Orlando V. Abinon, curator of heritage conservation for the Nantional Museum, told me that they were trying to conserve this piece of Philippine history during the restoration. Whether or not they were successful is unknown since I have not been able to access the choirloft the last time I was in Masinloc.\n\nAccording to my mother (noted when she visited the church when she was but a child), the cementery also was the final resting place of 17th and 18th century Dutch mercenaries which were obvious on the names engraved on the old tombstones.\n\nAlso, and according to my mom, there is a tribe of indigenous people in Masinloc called the \"Abeleng\" tribe. These people were tall, had the kinky hair of the indeginous \"Aetas\" but had red hair and green eyes! Decidledly a product of inter-relataionships between local indigenous women and raiding Dutch mercenaries (the Flemings were noted for having red hair). I wonder if they are still around. Would anybody know???\n\nThe Church of Iba:\n\nRCC Cathedral of San Agustin / St. Augustine\n\nIba, Zambales\n\nBorrowed from Garfrico's photostream. To see more of Garfrico's photos, please go here: www.flickr.com/photos/garfrico/5005715697/\n\nThis church is the seat of the Archdiocese of Iba (formerly the Prelature of Iba). It is made with local materials and coralstone. As you can see, an attempt was made to stucco (palitada) the facade but most of the original coralstone of the church was left exposed.\n\nWhat makes this church unique in all of Zambales and most of the Philippines is the existence of the Espandaña. The Espadaña is the belfrey (used here as an \"overmantel extension\" of the facade) composed of a single wall pierced with windows from which the bells are hung. The \"Espandaña\" is now walled-up and the bells removed to a separate bell-tower which may not have been part of the original church structure.\n\nAccording to Jose (1991), there are very few Philippine examples of churches with existing Espadañas with the churches of Iba and that of Puncan in Caranglan, Nueva Ecija being the exceptions (pp. 65, 199-200).\n\n***** When I visited the church of San Vicente Ferrer in Candelaria, I remember seeing an Espadaña separate and disctinct from the church. The Espadaña was located in front and not connected to the church proper. Can someone from Candelaria verify this for me????\n\nThe Church of Botolan:\n\nRCC Church of Sta. Monica / St. Monica\n\nBotolan, Zambales\n\nBorrowed from Garfrico's photostream. To see more of Garfrico's photos, please go here: www.flickr.com/photos/garfrico/5005715697/\n\nBotolan is located in the north-south border of the province of Zambales. It is the largest municipality in terms of land area in the province. Botolan is located just south of the provincial capital of Iba. Botolan is known for its large Aeta population, gray sand beaches and as the location of the famous Mount Pinatubo. Botolan is also home to the famous image of the Lady of Poonbato whose feast day, held on January 23-24, attracts more than half a million devotees!\n\nThe Parish of Sta. Monica was founded in 1736 at a place called \"Babayan\" (or Baybayan) probably meaning \"by the sea.\" The town was moved to its present site and renamed \"Botolan\" in 1819. The old RCC church of Botolan probably dates from this period.The church is made of local materials and coralstone. The architecture of the church is obviously patterned after that of Masinloc with a large pyramidal entabulature over the facade. The church also boasts an Espadana but this example seem like recent addition to the church proper and not part of the original structure.\n\nWhat makes this church unique in all of Zambales is that the entire church is overgrown with moss giving the church the ancient feel of a true \"Lumang Simbahan\". The last time I was inside the Botolan church in 1997, the church interior was not renovated and was redolent of the smell and feel of antiquity. It has now been renovated but I have not seen the new interior.\n\nThe Church of Sta. Cruz:\n\nChurch Facade\n\nRCC Parish of San Miguel Archangel / St. Michael the Archangel\n\nSta. Cruz, Zambales\n\nThe parish of Sta. Cruz is an old one, being established in 1612. It is the third oldest town organized in Zambales behind Masinloc (1607), and Iba (1611) under the leadership and guidance of the Augustian Recollects. And although the town itself is old, the current church was constructed sometime around the second half of the 19th century with extant church plans dated to 1868 reproduced in the end papers of Jose's book \"Simbahan\".\n\nThe Church of San Marcelino:\n\nRCC of San Guillermo / St. William, the Abbot\n\nSan Marcelino, Zambales\n\nBorrowed from Apo Baket's photostream. If you would like to see more of Apo Baket's photos, pls go here: www.flickr.com/photos/36249460@N06/page5/\n\nThe Facade of the Church of San Guillermo\n\nSan Marcelino, Zambales\n\nBorrowed from Shutterbug 500s photostream. If you would like to see more of Shutterblogger's photos, pls go here: www.flickr.com/photos/11477606@N07/\n\nThe church of San Guillermo / St. William in San Marcelino is one of the finest examples of church structures built during the American colonial period. According to Shutterbug 500, the church features a central spire structure more typically found on American protestant churches. This is very much par for the course as San Marcelino was the base headquarters of the last cavalry unit of the American Armed Forces.\n\nAnother interesting feature of the church of San Marcelino is the presence of antique bells which date back to the earlier church sturcture:\n\nSan Marcelino, Zambales Bell\n\nThe circa 1842 bell of San Marcelino located in the belfry of the Catholic church.\n\nPicture taken by Shutterbug500.\n\nThe circa 1886 bell of San Marcelino located in the bellfry of the Catholic church.\n\nPhoto by Apo Baket.\n\n***** Also according to Shutterbug 500, there is a church in Iba which features a very similar design but I have not seen it. Could someone from Iba take a picture of that structure and post it here.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nJose, R. T. (1991).
