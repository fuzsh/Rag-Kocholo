L’essentiel de ces remarques est que cette collection faisant auto­rité a reçu sa normativité et sa forme canoniques de celles du κανών, enten­du au sens large et global, en référence au statut canonique de la vie et de la foi chrétiennes qui est constitutif du christianisme le plus ancien, tel qu’il est attesté pour le « christianisme ecclésiastique » (celui de la Grande Église) dans les Lettres de Paul, dans 1 Clément et plus tard chez les auteurs qui, à commencer par Irénée de Lyon, utilisent l’expression κανὼν τῆς ἀληθείας ou κανὼν τῆς πίστεως. Je considérerai en particulier dans cette perspective l’existence des évangiles écrits, la distinction des actes et des paroles de Jésus, la nature et la classification des écrits apostoliques ; et enfin, plus largement, la quadruple collection d’évangiles écrits.",

        "text": "1. The existence and normativity of the written gospels and the other apostolic writings\n\n9The third level might be seen in the inclusion of the Pastoral Letters as part of the corpus Paulinum, and afterwards also in the presence of 2 Peter in the collection of Catholic letters, because all these writings deal with the transmission of the apostolic heritage to the next generation. In this regard, I wonder whether the multiple character of apostolicity could help to understand pseudepigraphy as one of the ways how the post-apostolic Church accomplished the reception and interpretation of the apostolic heritage.\n\n2. The canonical normativity of the four written gospels\n\nIt is not possible that the gospels can be either more or fewer in number than these (οὔτε δὲ πλείονα τὸν ἀριθµόν τούτων οὔτε πάλιν ἐλάττονα ἐνδέχεται εἶναι τὰ εὐαγγέλια / Neque autem plura numero quam haec sunt neque rursus pauciora capit esse euangelia). For, since there are four regions of the world in which we live (τέσσαρα κλίµατα τοῦ κόσµου ἐν ᾧ ἐσµέν) and four principal winds (τέσσαρα καθολικὰ πνεύµατα) and (since) the Church is spread over the whole earth and the pillar and ground of the Church is the Gospel and the Spirit of life (στῦλος δὲ καὶ στήριγµα ἐκκλησίας τὸ εὐαγγέλιον καὶ Πνεῦµα ζωῆς), it is fitting that she has four pillars (εἰκὸς τέσσαρας ἔχειν αὐτὴν στύλους), breathing out immortality on every side, and vivifying men afresh.\n\n32 For the Greek and Latin texts, cf. Irénée de Lyon, Contre les hérésies. Livre III, ed. A. Rousseau (...)\n\nFrom these facts, it is manifest that the Logos, who is the Artificer of all things, He that is seated upon the cherubim, and holds all things together (συνέχων τὰ πάντα / continet omnia), having manifested himself to men, has given us the tetramorphic Gospel, held together by one Spirit (ἔδωκεν ἡµῖν τετράµορφον τὸ εὐαγγέλιον, ἑνὶ δὲ Πνεύµατι συνεχόµενον / dedit nobis quadriforme Evangelium quod uno Spiritu continetur).\n\n15For the bishop of Lyons, the written gospels could be neither more nor less than four, not because of a mere historical development, but because of the logic of God’s design as displayed in the history of salvation. Let us follow the sequence in Irenaeus’ lines:\n\n171b) As the second part of the same causal clause, the fourfold feature is related to the fulfilment of creation, that is, to Jesus’ life and its continuity in the Church. Hence, and corresponding to the first part of the causal clause, ‘the Gospel and the Spirit of life’ (τὸ εὐαγγέλιον καὶ Πνεῦµα ζωῆς), ‘pillar and ground of the Church’ (στῦλος δὲ καὶ στήριγµα ἐκκλησίας), indicate both Christological and pneumatological aspects of the same reality, the two Hands of God that culminate their work in the glorious flesh of Jesus, which for Irenae­us is the actual pleromatic reality, from which Jesus’ disciples, dissem­­inated throughout the entire Church, receive the Spirit to be as­si­m­ilated to the Head of the Body. And therefore, this soteriological, Christological and pneumatological work should be fourfold as well, to keep the parallelism with the action of the Logos and the Spirit in creation.\n\n18Because of 1a + 1b, there must be four pillars in the Church—the four written gospels—exhaling immortality in all directions and vivifying men afresh.\n\n192a) The previous argumentation implies (Ἐξ ὧν φανερὸν ὅτι) for Irenaeus that the Artifex Verbum, who is seated above the Cherubim and holds all things together (συνέχων τὰ πάντα / continet omnia), is also the one, who, made flesh, gave ‘us the tetramorphic Gospel, held together by the only Spirit’ (ἡµῖν τετράµορφον τὸ εὐαγγέλιον, ἑνὶ δὲ Πνεύµατι συνεχόµενον / nobis quadriforme Evangelium quod uno Spiritu continetur). As his acting in creation was fourfold, so was also his life after the Incarnation, and consequently, also the Gospel poured out to the Church after his death and resurrection, that is, after the Paschal mysteries.\n\n20This means that, related to 1a and 1b, Irenaeus insists here on the central position of the Logos and on the correlation between his acting in creation, then as incarnated Logos and as risen Lord in the Church. Therefore, this is not an argument apart from the previous lines, but their culmination and total deployment, where the Christological dimension is the one explicitly connecting the others.\n\n222b) But regarding Christology, there is a final aspect, not explic­it in our passage, which not only is coherent with Irenaeus’ argu­mentation but provides its deepest foundations. The fourfold dimension of the Gospel belongs to what Irenaeus calls species evangelii (AH III,11,9), that is, the way how the Gospel is specifically conformed. This notion entails more than the number of the gospels but also includes it. Now, like every entity in the historia salutis, the species evangelii should share its proportion and harmony, which implies that it somehow mirrors the regula veritatis, that is, the truth of the divine design revealed to mankind. As revealed, this truth presents two complementary features: a) It has been made accessible for mankind; b) It comes from God. Now, for Irenaeus, a truth belonging to the divine sphere and made accessible for mankind points not to the transcendent Father, but to the Mediator Logos, who is called mensura Patris. This suggests that the truth men­tioned above as regula is ultimately not an abstract concept but identifies itself with God’s Logos as measure of the Father since his own pre-existent generation. This is the basis to correctly understand Irenaeus’ elaboration on the number and nature of the written gospels in AH III,11,8: these aspects are part of the elements of the history of salvation most closely following in their development the foundation, rule or measure personified in the Logos since its generation.\n\n233) The content expressed in the previous lines (2a) is attested—as the introductory καθώς shows—by the prophetic and apostolic writings, first by David according to Ps 79:2: ‘You who are seated upon the cherubim, shine forth.’ The first part—‘You who are seated upon the cherubim’—points to the Logos pre-existence and activity before the Incarnation; the second part—‘shine forth’—to his manifestation in the flesh. Secondly, the mention of the cherubim conducts Irenaeus to Ezek 1:6.10 and 10 and Rev 4:7. The combined interpretation of these passages shows that the fourfold face of the cherubim is image of the activity of the Son of God (εἰκόνες τῆς πραγµατείας τοῦ Υἱοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ). In fact, to pour out the fourfold Gospel on the Church, Jesus’ life had to embrace these four dimensions necessarily: a) the royal, divine one, represented by the lion; b) the mediating, priestly aspect, symbolised by the calf; c) the fleshly, human dimension, signified by the ἄνθρωπος; d) the pneumatological one, represented by the eagle. This means that Jesus, to pour out the Gospel to the Church, had to be a) God; b) the Son of God; c) man, that is, he had to become flesh; and d) anointed and source of the Spirit.\n\n254) According to all this argumentation, it is remarkable that for Irenaeus, the fourfold Gospel did not come into existence with the composition of the written gospels, nor with its oral preaching, not even during Jesus’ earthly life. It existed first as form of the not yet accomplished economy subsisting in the pre-existing Logos; secondly, as a prophetically announced Gospel; and last, as a Gospel fulfilled during the life of Jesus and in particular at its end, in the state of the glorious Christ, in whom the four distinctive aspects of the Gospel exist and are recapitulated in a real, complete and definitive way.\n\n27This implies that, regarding the transmission of Jesus’ tradition according to Irenaeus, on the one hand, its multiform character is affirmed: the apostles and their adsectatores took part in it. On the other hand, the precedence of the apostolic group is manifest, and within it, the preeminence of Peter, John, Matthew, and Paul. This hints at the four main transmission streams of the Gospel in the oral preaching phase. In this sense, one could speak of a multiform and, at the same time, tetramorphic preaching of the Gospel in the apostolic Tradition. In contrast to other local and transitory channels of preaching, these four main streams can be recognised by their catholic, universal and lasting character; they exhale the incorruption of Christ far and wide throughout the entire time of the Church.\n\n28I wonder whether this tetramorphic and multiform transmission of the Gospel could help to explain some historical events, such as the status of the Gospel of Peter in the community of Rhossos at the end of the second century; the status of the so-called Diatessaron in the Syriac communities until the fifth century, and the status of the De nativitate Mariae or Protevangelium Iacobi in many oriental churches for a long time. In these cases, it should be studied if the status and authority of these documents were equal to and compatible with those of the four gospels. As far as I know, these writings did not intend and/or achieve universal reception in the ecclesiastical churches throughout the world.\n\n3. The apostolic writings as canon and its relationship with the ‘Rule of truth’: conclusive remarks\n\n29As we approach the conclusion of our paper, an objection to our line of argument may be raised. If the apostolic faith was echoed in the normative apostolic collection of writings, how could it be that the disciples of Ptolemaeus received the four gospels at least as their most authoritative writings?\n\n30The answer lies in the fact that the process leading to the canonical consciousness of an apostolic writing collection was not only nor mainly a process of selecting writings. It was part of a more comprehensive process, which required delving into the apostolic heritage to interpret and formulate it. This means that the selection of writings and the delimitation of the collection’s boundaries did not occur without interpreting these same materials. That is why, though materially being the same or similar, the ultimate Canons of ecclesiastical Christians and Valentinians were so distant from each other. The difference between them did not mainly lie in the basic extent of the ecclesiastic and Valentinian apostolic writings collection; it was to be found in the opposing regulae received from the apostolic times, in the interpretation of the texts, and in the significance given to the written testimony itself. This fact entails the relativisation of the scriptural canon and shows that the sole principle of Scripture is not a viable one from a theological point of view.\n\n32The passage includes the Scriptures among the constitutive, normative elements that ecclesiastical Christians need to achieve the gnosis, that is, salvation, something that Irenaeus, as we have just mentioned, understands as a participation of the ecclesial Body of Christ in God’s charity. The Scriptures are also contemplated in their material dimension: their books, text and reading. But this, considered as the result of a process of interpretation, is linked with the understanding of Scriptures themselves according to the first and second levels, that is, the apostolic and the post-apostolic or Church level, keeper and custodian of the apostolic Tradition, whose normativity did not diminish or end due to the apparition of a normative, canonical collection of Scriptures, which, among other reasons, would not make sense, since the post-apostolic reception and interpretation of the scriptural material brought it to its final status."
