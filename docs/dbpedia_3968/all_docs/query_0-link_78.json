        "text": "This paper is a preliminary study on two aspects of marriage as it was instituted in Spanish colonial Philippines. The first is freedom of the spouses in giving matrimonial consent, which is the constitutive act of marriage; and the second, unity of marriage, with its twin character of exclusivity and indissolubility. Spanish colonial government, secular and religious, had to grapple with Philippine indigenous customs considered incongruent with canonical marriage and its auxiliary values. This study examines some of the means by which colonial authorities sought to refashion the institution of matrimony according to Spanish, Catholic norms in the late seventeenth century up to the late eighteenth. Examples of institutional means were the visita a la tierra undertaken by magistrates of the Audiencia, the diocesan visitation by the bishop, both of which enabled colonial authorities to know the situation in provincial localities; and the beaterio for women. The critical role with regard to marriage that parish priests played is included in this study insofar as it is reflected in manuals meant for their use. Matrimonial cases give some indication of the extent to which canonical marriage was recognized by the lowland indigenous population and enforced by the Catholic Church. The cases presented are illustrative, even if sketchily, of social conditions and practices among indios and mestizos de sangley. Emerging as a central concern in relation to marriage and, through marriage, to social order, are women and feminine values.\n\nThis essay examines selected writings of two Dominican moral theologians, Juan de Paz and Francisco Martinez, on questions related to indigenous marriage in the Spanish colonial Philippines. The work of Paz is set into the context of his activities as professor and rector of the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, an institution which prided itself on being a purveyor of Hispanic academic tradition. It was often consulted corporately or through its individual professors on a great variety of cases and questions with a moral-legal dimension faced by public and private institutions and authorities. This article also examines Martinez’s treatises on the indigenous customs of bride wealth and wedding services against the background of the insistent injunctions against them from both secular and ecclesiastical authorities. In their interpretation and assessment of indigenous marriage and its attendant customs, these two moral theologians/Paz and Martinez proved themselves to be heirs of the discursive content and method of the School of Salamanca. They applied their command not only of moral theology but also of civil and canon law to a non-European socio-cultural context, thereby demonstrating where points of harmony as well as of dissonance with indigenous custom lay.\n\nWhile certain aspects of the city of Guanajuato's colonial past are now better understood due to recent studies both in Spain and Mexico, others remain obscure and the subject of cursory investigation. One such topic is the prominent role of women in Hispanoamerica, although it has been recognized by recent historiography. 1 With regard to Guanajuato, in particular, there are a few relevant essays that have contributed to the investigation of the upper-class woman's role in society, for example those by Guevara Sanginés y Caño Ortigosa. 2 Using these articles and an ample collection of written deeds produced by or for the women of Guanajuato during the Colonial Period as a point of departure, this study further examines the position of upper-class women in the socioeconomic context of Guanajuato. The quantity of documentation generated by women during the Colonial times makes such an investigation possible since 30% of the property deeds in Guanajuato between 1700 and 1712, were drafted by women. 3 This demonstrates that the elite women of Guanajuato, as with their counterparts in other areas of Spanish America, represented an essential and active part of society. Therefore, the importance of discerning the social and economic mechanisms that enabled women to gain this influence is evident. It can be said that the institutions of dowry and marriage figured prominently in women's public lives, as these were some of the means by which social * We would like to thank Andrew Kincaid, of the University of Pennsylvania, for the help he has given us with the translation, as well as Dr. Anthony Grubbs, of Michigan State University, for his revision and commentary.\n\nThis paper deals with the use of matrimonial dispensations to marry relatives in prohibited degrees by Canon law, mainly among the indigenous peoples of Charcas (present Bolivia) during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. As a source to understand social and religious practices, the dispensations provide a privileged place of observation, insofar as they constitute a gap between the norm and the social practice, and a space of interaction and agency, from the anthropological point of view, since the request for dispensations was part of the social and material reproduction strategies of indigenous groups. Even when, in this sense, the use of this legal recourse does not seem to diﬀer much from what the population of European origin did, which secularly employed the same resource, this paper proposes that the reasoning behind the use of matrimonial dispensations, as well as the arguments employed varied in both socio-ethnic groups. From the vantage point of a global history of law which involves the Tridentine Church, expanded around the globe, dispensations are an example of the accommodation in terms of »time, place and circumstances«. Taking into account that the Council of Trent had extended matrimonial impediments, the granting of dispensations among the indigenous population serves as an example of the paradoxes of the Christianisation of marriage in colonial Hispanic American territories, which frequently forced the Church to dissimulate and make concessions rather than to restrict and discipline.\n\nTraditional marriage customs are concerned by authorizing the marriage of men and women. Customary marriage is a form of local culture that grew in the midst of society. This form of local culture isa different and unique in a particular community. This can be seen in its implementation ordinances and values that emerge from that culture. Based on the above, research problem formulation has the following objectives, (1) Describe the ethical values in society customary marriage ceremony in Pautola Nagekeo, (2) Describe the marriage customs value of aesthetics in society in Pautola Nagekeo, (3) Describe the value of religion in peoples' customary marriage in Pautola Nagekeo, (4) Describe the social value of marriage customs in society in Pautola Nagekeo. The research uses Descriptive method. This research is conducted in Patuola which located in Patuola village, Nagekeo regency, East Nusa Tenggara province.The researcher took the data needed by interviewing people who live on Patuola and listed the data collected so it’s easier to describe. From the findings, Pautola society in the course of his life while maintaining the noble heritage from generation to generation, one of the traditions that are still maintained until now is the tradition of marriage. Pautola community customary marriage agencies establish mating process into four stages of marriage, namely: (a) Palu Dheko marriage (b) Da Donggo marriage (c) Tendu marriage and (d) Nggae Fai marriage. The values of the ceremony are grouped in several types, namely (1) the value of ethics regarding good and bad about human behavior, (2) the aesthetic value, associate with beauty, (3) the value of religion, associated with the commands and prohibitions of God, (4) social values, concerning the relationship between human and social life\n\nEven a brief look into the historiography on Indian marriage in New Spain will reveal how infrequently scholars have devoted themselves to this topic. On the one hand, there are texts written from the perspective of canon law, such as those by Federico Aznar Gil, Paulino Castañeda, Daisy Rípodas Ardanaz, and Guillermo Floris Margadant, but these authors address canonical development in Spain as well as Spanish America and use mainly references from councils and synods, especially pastoral sources. On the other hand, there are anthropological studies, such as those of David Robichaux, Danièle Dehouve, Pierre Ragon, and Serge Gruzinski that compare pre-Hispanic marriage to Christian marriage."
