        "text": "In a February 25 decree issued to the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), Pope Francis granted plenary indulgences to Filipinos visiting any of over 500 Jubilee Churches across the country to mark 500 years of Christianity in the Philippines in 2021.\n\nTo obtain plenary indulgence, the Vatican prescribed visiting one of 537 Jubilee Churches spread out all over the archipelago any time until April 22, 2022, said CBCP News.\n\nFor Catholics, an indulgence is a special blessing that removes God’s punishment for sins that have already been forgiven. When an indulgence is “plenary,” it involves the total removal of punishment, as opposed to a partial indulgence.\n\nThe Vatican requests pilgrims going to the Jubilee Churches to pray “for the fidelity of the Filipino people to their Christian calling, for the increase of priestly and religious vocations, and for the defense of the family, concluding with the Lord’s Prayer, the profession of faith, and an invocation to the Blessed Virgin Mary.”\n\nAside from granting a plenary indulgence to Filipino pilgrims, to mark the 500 years of Christianity in the Philippines, the Pope has also declared a special Jubilee Year in Cebu starting April 4.\n\nThe Pontiff is also scheduled to lead a Mass to celebrate the event at Saint Peter’s Basilica on March 14.\n\nHere is a complete list of Jubilee Churches in the country courtesy of the CBCP.\n\nDiocese of Alaminos\n\n1.
