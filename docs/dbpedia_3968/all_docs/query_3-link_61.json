        "text": "<strong>THE</strong> <strong>SPANISH</strong> <strong>COLONIAL</strong> <strong>TRADITION</strong> <strong>In</strong> <strong>1521</strong>, <strong>when</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Spaniards</strong> arrived at <strong>the</strong> archipelago that <strong>the</strong>y were later to call Filipinas, <strong>the</strong>y found that <strong>the</strong> inhabitants lived in small and autonomous communities, except in big centers ruled by <strong>the</strong> likes of <strong>the</strong> Sultan of Sulu or <strong>the</strong> Rajah of Manila. Spanish conquest beginning in 1565 led to <strong>the</strong> consolidation of <strong>the</strong> people through <strong>the</strong> following process: first, reduccion (reduction of <strong>the</strong> people to submission) by means of military invasion; second, <strong>the</strong> resettlement of <strong>the</strong> people into pueblos (towns) organized bajo las campanas (under <strong>the</strong> church bells); third, <strong>the</strong> conversion of <strong>the</strong> people to Christianity and consequently, <strong>the</strong>ir acculturation into Spanish-European thought. Beneath this layer of hispanized culture, however, <strong>the</strong> people’s native spirit persisted in <strong>the</strong>ir folkways and in <strong>the</strong>ir religious beliefs and practices. The entry into <strong>the</strong> country of <strong>the</strong> spirit of <strong>the</strong> European Medieval Period (12th century) and <strong>the</strong> Golden Age of Spanish Literature (17th century) contributed to <strong>the</strong> acculturation process. The early missionary poets seemed to have been more familiar with <strong>the</strong> poetry of <strong>the</strong> Medieval Period and found it more useful for <strong>the</strong>ir missionary purposes. The friars who came later continued to use <strong>the</strong> same models for <strong>the</strong> same reason. By <strong>the</strong> 18th century, Spanish reduction of <strong>the</strong> people was clearly evident in both <strong>the</strong> prose and poetry of <strong>the</strong> period until <strong>the</strong> emergence of such independent spirits as Francisco Baltazar and <strong>the</strong> writers of <strong>the</strong> Reform Movement of <strong>the</strong> 1880s. Poetry Religious poetry is exemplified by <strong>the</strong> complimentary verses, <strong>the</strong> dalit, and <strong>the</strong> pasyon; secular poetry, by <strong>the</strong> awit and korido (metrical romances) and <strong>the</strong> lyric poems. <strong>In</strong> 17th-century Spain, a poem in sonnet form, called complimentary verses, usually appeared in a book in order to encourage people to read it. <strong>In</strong> <strong>the</strong> Philippines, <strong>the</strong> first printed book, <strong>the</strong> Memorial de la vida cristiana en lengua tagala (Guidelines for <strong>the</strong> Christian Life in <strong>the</strong> Tagalog Language), 1605, by Dominican friar Francisco Blancas de San Jose, included Fernando Bagongbanta’s ladino or bilingual complimentary poem now known by its first line: “Salamat nang Ualang Hanga” (Unending Thanks).The fusion of <strong>the</strong> indigenous and Spanish poetic traditions are evident in this poem, which consists of lines alternating between Spanish and <strong>the</strong> Tagalog translation. Significantly, even <strong>the</strong> poet’s name itself, Fernando Bagongbanta, is ladino. <strong>In</strong>cluded in <strong>the</strong> same book is <strong>the</strong> first known poem written solely in Tagalog, also a complimentary poem now known by its first line “May Bagyo Ma’t May Rilim” (Though It Is Stormy and Dark), by an anonymous author. San Jose called <strong>the</strong>se poems awit."
