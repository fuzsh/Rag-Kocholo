        "text": "Succession, as provided by the Civil Code, is a mode of acquisition by virtue of which the property, rights, and obligations to the extent of the value of the inheritance, of a person are transmitted through his death to another or others either by his will or by operation of law. Succession is a derivative mode of acquiring ownership whereby only persons with legal capacity may own properties, acquire rights, and incur obligations. It is contemplated that the heirsâ€™ rights to the succession are transmitted only from the moment of the death of the decedent-- a notion which is embodied as well in Article 777 of the Civil Code. Nonetheless, the decedent has the right to designate an heir by executing a will in compliance with the formalities required by law. This is called a testamentary succession. Other forms of succession are (1) legal succession which takes place if a person dies without a will and (2) mixed succession is that effected partly by will and partly by operation of law. Even so, a testator may revoke a will at any time before his death and any waiver or restriction of this right is void. In fact, the law even recognizes the revocation of a will done outside the Philippines so long as it is done according to the law of the place where the will was made, or according to the law of the place in which the testator had his domicile at the time. This paper aims to present an extensive understanding of the revocation of succession under the Civil Code and the Family Code of the Philippines by discussing the modes available to the decedent, including its subsequent legal effects.\n\nArticle 1. This Act shall be known as the \"Civil Code of the Philippines.\" (n) Art. 2. Laws shall take effect after fifteen days following the completion of their publication in the Official Gazette, unless it is otherwise provided. This Code shall take effect one year after such publication. (1a) Art. 3. Ignorance of the law excuses no one from compliance therewith. (2) Art. 4. Laws shall have no retroactive effect, unless the contrary is provided. (3) Art. 5. Acts executed against the provisions of mandatory or prohibitory laws shall be void, except when the law itself authorizes their validity. (4a) Art. 6. Rights may be waived, unless the waiver is contrary to law, public order, public policy, morals, or good customs, or prejudicial to a third person with a right recognized by law. (4a) Art. 7. Laws are repealed only by subsequent ones, and their violation or non-observance shall not be excused by disuse, or custom or practice to the contrary. When the courts declared a law to be inconsistent with the Constitution, the former shall be void and the latter shall govern. Administrative or executive acts, orders and regulations shall be valid only when they are not contrary to the laws or the Constitution. (5a) Art. 8. Judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the Constitution shall form a part of the legal system of the Philippines. (n) Art. 9. No judge or court shall decline to render judgment by reason of the silence, obscurity or insufficiency of the laws. (6) Art. 10. In case of doubt in the interpretation or application of laws, it is presumed that the lawmaking body intended right and justice to prevail. (n) Art. 11. Customs which are contrary to law, public order or public policy shall not be countenanced. (n)"
