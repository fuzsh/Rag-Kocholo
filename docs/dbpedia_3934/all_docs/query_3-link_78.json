This includes OSS4 (FreeBSD), ALSA (Linux), Pulse Audio, JACK, QtMultimedia, Icecast, WaveOut (Win32), DirectSound (Win32), and WASAPI (Win32) output.\n\nMain new features of Qmmp 1.6.0\n\nIn the new version that is presented and Qmmp 1.6.0 added extracting letters from labels (id3v2 tags and Xiph comment), plus in the quick transition dialog, queue display has been added.\n\nAnother novelty that stands out in the new version of Qmmp 1.6.0 is that added the ability to skip existing tracks in the playlist, as well as added volume change notification to the KDE notifications module and also added support for the XDG base directory specification (for 2.1.0 only)\n\nIn addition to this, it is also highlighted that the ffmpeg module has improved the configuration of filters by filename and that the minimum version of Qt has also been increased (up to 5.5 and 6.2, respectively).\n\nAlso duplicate track search optimization and track queue optimization are highlighteds, as well as the ability to hide the menu bar has been added and the file system browser context menu has been improved.\n\nOn the other hand, in Qmmp 1.6.0 it is highlighted that added the ability to delete tracks to the history module and track information display has been provided.\n\nOf the other changes that stand out from this new version:\n\nFixed conflict between versions 1.x and 2.x\n\nQmmp plugin package plugins migrated to qmmp 1.6/2.1 API, added modplug module and removed xmp module.\n\nThe modplug module has been replaced by xmp\n\nImproved qsui module\n\nAdded ability to hide playlist name filter\n\nAdded app menu\n\nClear button enabled for some search filters\n\nImproved \"About...\" dialog\n\ntracking queue optimization\n\nupdated dutch translation\n\nupdated ukrainian translation\n\nupdated polish translation\n\nupdated portuguese translation\n\nupdated finnish translation\n\nUpdated Galician translation\n\nupdated italian translation\n\nupdated russian translation\n\nupdated korean translation\n\nUpdated Spanish translation.\n\nFinally, if you are interested in knowing more about it about the new released versions of Qmmp, you can check the details In the following link.\n\nHow to install Qmmp on Ubuntu?\n\nIn order to install this great player on our system, we must add the following PPA and install it with the following commands:\n\nThe first will be add repository from the application to the system:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:forkotov02/ppa\n\nNow we will proceed to update our list of repositories:\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAnd finally we proceed to install the app with:\n\nsudo apt-get install qmmp\n\nNow if we want to install a plugin to complement the player we just have to go to the page and see the available ones.\n\nIn the case of Qmmp extras, they are installed with:\n\nsudo apt-get install qmmp-plugin-pack\n\nIn the case for the YouTube plugin:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/rigon/qmmp-plugin-youtube.git qmake make -j4\n\nNow we only have to compile the plugin with the following commands and in addition to moving some libraries that are necessary.\n\nsudo cp -v youtube/libyoutube.so /usr/lib/qmmp/Transports sudo cp -v youtubeui/libyoutubeui.so /usr/lib/qmmp/General\n\nAnd ready.
