        "text": "Reply #25 – 2015-09-19 14:20:14\n\nThe Qmmp plugin is now ready: https://github.com/cspiegel/qmmp-optimfrog\n\nIn addition, I've written an Audacious plugin: https://github.com/cspiegel/audacious-optimfrog\n\nThanks to Florin for OptimFROG!\n\nMany thanks for the Qmmp and Audacious plug-ins!\n\nOptimFROG DualStream isn't working correctly in fb2k at all. I get this error message whenever I use temp wav or pipe encoding:\n\nofs.exe has stopped working\n\nA problem has caused the program to stop working correctly.\n\nWindows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.\n\nFor some reason, the last file always has the smallest file size (Like something with a bitrate of 4.) And Replaygain always takes 7-10 minutes to complete for an average album. At this point, the standard version of DualStream is looking very good, and stable. The experimental version? Not so much.\n\nThank you for reporting the problem! I was not able to reproduce it and I wrote you a PM some time ago, asking for more details. I guess the problem may be related to using the --experimental, --advanced-compression, or --advanced-compression-analysis command-line options with OptimFROG DualStream. These options were meant, in principle, for the OptimFROG Lossless variant only. The command-line parser code is common to all OptimFROG variants, with particular options being enabled only in some variants. The above options are currently implicitly enabled in all variants, but I will investigate and disable them accordingly in the upcoming OptimFROG version.\n\nIs there a list of command line options somewhere? I can't find one in the download or on the website.\n\nNevermind, I got them in the OptimFROG_All_Windows_x86_4520b1.zip download.\n\nIndeed, there is no up-to-date document with a detailed description of the command-line commands and options. Using --help on the command-line may help, as it will show the complete list of commands and options, most of them including a short explanation. I am planning to write and maintain such a document in the future.\n\nI think people on OS X would appreciate it if XLD could support OptimFROG.\n\nThank you for the very good suggestion! Hopefully, decoder plug-ins for both deadbeef and XLD will become available, some time soon.\n\nOptimFROG 5.000 has been released\n\nReply #26 – 2015-10-17 06:21:43\n\nWhat about plug-in for foobar 2000? How can I use it?\n\nOptimFROG 5.000 has been released\n\nReply #27 – 2015-11-09 21:55:36\n\nWhat about plug-in for foobar 2000? How can I use it?\n\nTo use the foobar2000 plug-in, the files foo_input_ofr.dll (from foo_input_ofr_131_test.zip or foo_input_ofr_130.zip) and OptimFROG.dll (for example, from the OptimFROG_Win_x86_5003.zip release package, in the SDK/Library subfolder) must be copied into the foobar2000/components folder.\n\nOptimFROG 5.003 is ready! It adds a standard interactive installer install.sh, pkg-config support, shared library versioning support, --writefreshheader option to write a fresh standard WAV header during decoding, has some small decoder speed improvements, and is now available on FreeBSD.\n\nYou can check the new release packages on the Downloads page and the comprehensive list of changes on the Changes page.\n\nAmong others, speed improvements using hand-optimized SSE2 code are in progress, and a decoder plug-in for XLD will be available some time soon.\n\nMany thanks to Angenial for the DeaDBeeF plug-in, which is now ready: https://github.com/cspiegel/deadbeef-optimfrog\n\nOptimFROG 5.000 has been released\n\nReply #28 – 2015-11-15 10:27:06\n\nWhat about plug-in for foobar 2000?

Apparantly every single file must be converted one by one because a fucking windows can't support several unicode languages (more than two) in filepath in a bat file. Who could have thought?! Foobar converter doesn't work at all (doesn't rename temp-somethingsomethinfile). I give up. I will better delete half of files than use a command promt software again. Now I understand why most people have stuck to flac.\n\nOptimFROG 5.000 has been released\n\nReply #29 – 2015-11-15 11:05:12\n\nFoobar converter doesn't work at all (doesn't rename temp-somethingsomethinfile).\n\nI just tried and can't see any problem.\n\nOptimFROG 5.000 has been released\n\nReply #30 – 2015-11-17 08:39:14\n\nFoobar converter doesn't work at all (doesn't rename temp-somethingsomethinfile).\n\nI just tried and can't see any problem.\n\nYou are right. My bad.\n\nOptimFROG 5.000 has been released\n\nReply #31 – 2015-11-17 11:38:47\n\nJust to mention it somewhere where someone might be interested: Kermit seems to be unavailable at the author's location, but archive.org has it: http://web.archive.org/web/20140826164213/...peek/kermit.htm\n\nMusic playlists I use for testing lossless encoding (CDDA): https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php/topic,122960.0.html\n\nOptimFROG 5.000 has been released\n\nReply #32 – 2015-11-24 12:35:32\n\nOptimFROG 5.003 is ready!\n\nFirstly, I just want to say it's great to see you back in action with v5. Thank you for all your work!\n\n5.002 x64 (Windows) still seems to be the fastest encoding for me, although compared with 5.003 only by a fraction of a percent. Negligible, but consistent during repetition.\n\nNot trying to be funny or smart ass, I just want to understand, why is anyone using OptimFROG today?\n\nI can't speak for everyone, but I use it because no other lossless encoder reaches its level of compression.\n\nOptimFROG 5.000 has been released\n\nReply #33 – 2015-11-24 18:05:07\n\nNot trying to be funny or smart ass, I just want to understand, why is anyone using OptimFROG today?\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves\n\n2014 codec poll and 2015 codec poll\n\nRe: OptimFROG 5.000 has been released\n\nReply #34 – 2016-03-14 02:22:48\n\nSo, optim frog is unable to embed ALL of the flac tags and can't show embedded pictures in popular foobar2000 and other players.\n\nIt can't be embedded into MKV container also. So, what can I use it for at all?\n\ntried 5.003. (if 5.002 works, how could I know it?)\n\nIt was seeming as a good idea to get some free space (up to 5%, up to 10% with some other tricks, but). But now it just an arhiver software, not a codec.\n\nPlease tell me I am wrong. Because it feels weird, that author doesn't care about these things.\n\nRe: OptimFROG 5.000 has been released\n\nReply #35 – 2016-03-22 20:08:59\n\nDuring my long public absence I have actively worked on my PhD thesis about lossless audio compression, \"Modeling and Optimization for Lossless Audio Coding with Flexible Complexity Profiles\", and I am very happy to say that the end result is a completely new codec member, OptimFROG Asymmetric: from compression ratios similar to OptimFROG maximum compression experimental, while being 5 up to 20 times faster at decoding, and going down to decoding speeds in the range of FLAC.\n\nThere is work slowly going on about the bitsream format finalization and analysis, and also integration and harmonization of different codec modules, but I definitely plan to release the full bitstream format specification and the official open-source reference implementations within a time frame of 6 to 10 months from now.\n\nShould we expect a release of the reference implementation of this new codec soon?"
