        "text": "Converting to Open Source\n\nThis is a list of applications I like on Windows (both freeware and commercial) and some Open Source Windows and Posix (Linux, FreeBSD, Cygwin) equivalents. The idea is to eventually use as many cross-platform, open source applications as possible. This allows for easier bug fixing if a problem is encountered. Also, this allows easier switching between operating systems and easier migration towards more Open Source operating system platforms. The list is skewed by my particular preferences as to which applications I find useful or easier to work with. It does not include all applications in a particular category. Where possible, I've tried to list programs that were cross-platform portable and/or worked well on low resource machines.\n\nTo the main page.\n\nApplication\n\n(not Open Source)\n\n(usually Windows) Open Source\n\n(Windows) Open Source\n\n(Posix)\n\nWord Processor\n\nWordPerfect (Windows, DOS and Linux), Word (DOS freeware) Lyx, LibreOffice (Portable Apps version available), Scribus, Abiword (Portable Apps version available), wordgrinder Lyx, LibreOffice, Siag Office, flwriter, Scribus, Abiword, wordgrinder, Caligra, focuswriter Programmer's Editor\n\nPFE, edwin, PEDIT SciTE, Textadept (console version), FXite, Cream, Nano, Pico, Notepad++ SciTE, Textadept (console version), FXite, Cream, Nano, Pico Writers' Tools\n\nGunning-Fogfinder, Grammatick (with WordPerfect) wc, diction, style, sdcv, goldendict, StarDict (portable version available) wc, diction, style, sdcv (command line version of StarDict), qstardict, goldendict, StarDict, Document Conversion\n\nps2pdf (ghostscript), a2ps, enscript, pdftxt, unrtf ps2pdf (ghostscript), antiword, a2ps, enscript, pdftxt, unrtf Window Manager bug.n script with autohotkey, dwm, emerge desktop jwm, fluxbox, openbox, dwm, mwm File Manager File Manager (SDL), far manager, midnight commander, pathfinder, ?

The ? (not by a specific program), indicates that I'm still looking for software solutions for that category.\n\nAlong with the missing functionality above, I'm also still looking for the following:\n\nA rhyming dictionary for Stardict. If an ASCII text version is available, then converting from ASCII to Babylon format using Perl and then from Babylon format to Stardict format using one of the Stardict tools should be possible. I have a project for this in the works, but it takes time to fix all the scanned typos made by the OCR.\n\nWriting tools that output in mingw or gnu C/C++ compiler error format so they can be easily integrated with programming editors such as SciTE. I already created one such tool, a spell checker. It would be nice to see other tools of this nature such as a grammar checker. For grammar checking, maybe Abiword's link grammar program or graviax could be used as a starting point for such a program.\n\nGraphics program that gives ability to visually see and pick color differences (for instance adding slightly more blue or slightly more red to the picture). The functionality is available in Photoshop and 2 Pic. It would be nice to locate an Open Source program that has this same feature and a similar implementation.\n\nLighterweight replacements for GTK+ and other resource intensive applications. I'd like to move to lighter GUI libraries and frameworks.\n\nIf you know of any Open Source programs that fill in the blanks, please contact me through one of my mailing lists or directly through e-mail.\n\nSharing Open Source\n\nAs I was compiling and building some of the programs mentioned above, it struck me that there were plenty of Open Source archives to share project source code. However, the same wasn't true for sharing executables. In some cases, you can contact the project and send them an executable if it's not currently available, but often, a project is no longer supported or may not be interested in your particular platform. If anyone knows of a place to share Open Source executable programs for specific platforms (along with the source and any patches needed to build, of course), please let me know. I don't think average users like building their own programs, even if it is for the purpose of trying out something new and useful. It would be very nice if people had a place to share some builds of programs if there is no official build for a platform. It would certainly save people time if each person did not have to build from scratch or try to work around operating system specific deficiencies. If you have any ideas on how to better share executables along with their source, please let me know. It would also be nice to have a place for programmers to share cross-platform build scripts and the work involved to create and update them. I'm also working on a build project to help automate building of applications in a cross-platform manner. If you're interested in knowing more or getting involved, feel free to contact me via the CppDesign mailing list.\n\nThe webmaster at http://criticalpressmedia.com/ has been gracious enough to offer space to host some of the Windows programs I've compiled and built that are not already available as executables elsewhere. I really appreciate his doing so. I've uploaded a few programs there.\n\nI've also been using Google Drive to hold some of my patches and programs. Hope to update what's there and add more as time allows. You can find those uploads in my Google Drive archive.\n\nTo the main page.\n\nValidate XHTML"
