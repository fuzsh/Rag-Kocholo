        "text": "Recently I finally managed to configure remote (aka off-site) backup for my Debian server. As always, I started with a comparison of existing solutions.\n\nDebian has a number of packages enabling remote (over the network) backup: backupPC, backupninja, backup-manager, dirvish, duplicity, luckybackup, rdiff-backup, and some others.\n\nRead the rest of this entry »\n\nBack in the times when Windows was my OS more than 75% of the time in front of the computer, I really liked a simple photos import utility, supplied for Canon digital still image cameras. It allowed the import of all the new media items (photos and movies) from a camera into a pre-configured location in one click, and it also automatically created date-based directories for new photos. Given the removable media autoplay feature, after connecting the camera it was really a matter of one click (or one button press) to have everything copied.\n\nToday, I decided to have a look at what the FOSS community has to match that simple and useful Canon utility. Here’s my “rating”:\n\ndigikam: nice and easy import; supports date-based auto-creation of albums (directories); feature-reach, suitable as a primary images-viewing application; my personal “number one” for now.\n\nf-spot: easy import; has nice date-based photos browser; on import, converts photo filenames to lower case; my second choice, will have a closer look at its features.\n\ngThumb: good import, but haven’t found a way to configure/create target directory during import.\n\ngtkam: unusual interface; while testing, it died once unexpectedly; otherwise easy to use.\n\npicasa: haven’t tried to import with a recent version, but I generally dislike the idea of using software which requires an extra layer to run (wine in this case), unless it is unique. Picasa is not unique, and thus looses (in my opinion) to digikam.\n\nRelated: list of 100 most useful open-source software tools.\n\nscreen is a must-use for anyone familiar with SSH sessions; it saves your time by keeping your console apps running even after (an unexpected) disconnect from the remote session.\n\nThe easiest way to start with screen is screenie – an interface to screen. To use it, you only need to memorize a single keyboard shortcut: C-a d (Ctrl+a, d). This shortcut detaches (hides) your current screen session, allowing to resume later – either with the help of screenie, or by issuing screen -r command.\n\nAfter a while, with increased screen (and screenie) usage, you will find it inconvenient detaching every time you need a new screen session. Here comes the second keyboard shortcut: C-a c (Ctrl+a, c), which creates a new window within a current screen session, and switches to it.\n\nFinally, you will find it tiresome detaching to then re-attach to a different screen. C-a “ (Ctrl+a, Shift+’) will display a list of screen windows for you to select and switch to.\n\nScreenie, an excellent beginner’s interface to screen, is no longer needed after you memorize these 3 keyboard shortcuts.\n\nMany will say that this is a bare minimum, and also there is much more to screen than what you present here, and that will be true. However, these 3 shortcuts are sufficient for simple but convenient everyday screen sessions management."
