        "text": "The audio despite being the same speakers, same connection (3.5mm) becomes dynamic and I can hear a wider range of sounds, footsteps, etc. Than whenever I play any of these games on Windows.\n\nThe best sound Linux has for games is probably OpenAL. OpenAL is particularly interesting because it is a 3D sound system.\n\nOpenAL Soft is a fork licensed under LGPL that's still up-to-date and includes HRTF on headphones and up to 3rd-order Ambisonics.\n\nOpenAL Soft can do a form of audio raytracing for convincing occlusion effects.\n\nGames can also use sdl and maybe sdl works well on your hardware/operating system combination.\n\nLinux' sound quality for audio players such as Qmmp is a hit-or-miss situation.\n\nIt depends heavily on the motherboard and the audio chip you are using.\n\nOn most hardware I have, Linux sounds horrible.\n\nBut I once installed Linux on an acquaintance's old (high-end) Dell Latitude.\n\nI immediately noticed that Qmmp produced abnormally detailed and clean sound on this hardware on Linux.\n\nI don't know if this is because the hardware is much better, or because Dell is popular with Linux developers. Perhaps a combination of both.\n\nFor most hardware, OpenBSD and FreeBSD do better than Linux.\n\nIf you combine OpenBSD/FreeBSD with music player daemon you can produce high-quality sound on the very cheapest motherboards.\n\nWith Linux this is not the case.\n\nThe audio despite being the same speakers, same connection (3.5mm) becomes dynamic and I can hear a wider range of sounds, footsteps, etc. Than whenever I play any of these games on Windows.\n\nIn fact most sound video game sounds sound a lot better under Linux (music is unchanged). I tested on Linux Mint and Ubuntu (forgot the version numbers) about a year ago.\n\nWhats Linux doing under the hood that makes it better than whatever MS is doing? (Realtek ALC1200)\n\nHere you have two recordings that give a pretty good idea of how ALSA and OSS sound over an analogue connection.\n\nOpenBSD + music player daemon + OSS\n\nCalculate Linux + Qmmp + ALSA (direct ALSA connection without PulseAudio)\n\nBoth recordings were made 99% the same way. Same micro, same recording operating system (Void Linux), same recording notebook, same recording app.\n\nThe only difference is that one recording is in 48 KHz and the other in 96 KHz.\n\nAccording to most experts, people usually cannot hear any difference between 48 KHz and 96 KHz.\n\nThe second track on both recordings is the same song. This makes comparison of both sound architectures easy.\n\nTo me, there are noticeable differences in how the electric guitar sounds on both recordings.\n\nThe way the electric guitar comes to the foreground is different in both recordings.\n\nThe volume balance of the instruments is maybe also different.\n\nOn the sound system used (Infinity speakers + Sony receiver), Calculate Linux sounds good.\n\nHowever, my preference is OpenBSD for most songs.\n\nThere is hardware on which the audio sounds better in Linux than in my above example. (certain DELL hardware for example)\n\nMy general idea is that Linux and Windows are similar in terms of audio and it's going to depend on the specific hardware which of the two sounds better.\n\nNetBSD, FreeBSD and OpenBSD have independent OSS implementations that tend to give better analogue sound than Linux and Windows. (on most hardware..)\n\nHere you have two recordings that give a pretty good idea of how ALSA and OSS sound over an analogue connection.\n\nGet a XMOS(~316) backed DAC/AMP and thank me later. It also can bug, so you know, it is PC, if it has some weird profile... and bad USB, even my PC sneezes USB and dmesg is error spammed if I put the DAC in higher USB numbers during boot, but I have shitsus mobo, so no wonders there.\n\nThose work out of the box, drivers are in kernel, well almost, we will never see proper Linux DSD in our life time frames most probably, but not that it is needed. Let's not indulge ourselves into comparing audio stacks and how they operate in reality, you will have to take into account what the DAC does itself on hardware level and afterwards filtering it... none of us has R/2R or begin to dvelve into quantization artifacts for other topologies and their hybrids even. Basically that's what are you actually influencing here. For guitars adding pre ringing or actually not taking away in filtering phase, you get pleasant distortion pedal effect, thus win win situation, more HF distortion sounds more bright to our ears, so... there's your catch.\n\nCompare different solutions, do proper SINAD... we have enough propehic reviewers across sites claiming healing properties when using some devices... If you cannot measure it, it ain't there. And for limited spectrum human hearing audio you always can... we aren't chasing Higgs boson particles here.\n\nEach hardware solution needs to be analyzed their own to judge what's happening, it is not that simple. Windows WASAPI(Bypass windows volume service resampler) + Foobar is the best for bitperfect playback and nothing holds a candle to it. ASIO did before, but due to new hardware and OS nature it ain't usable anymore as it was in the past.\n\nBut either way... using XMOS based devices is a way to use Linux and while being with audio that doesn't suck, bark, hiccup, crackle, snore etc...\n\nI did too much... in the age most people use Bluetooth shit earbuds, causing them permanent hearloss...\n\nFoobar2000 has been a largely dead project for a long time.\n\nNot sure what you mean by that. Peter does update it all the time, including plugins and keeps up with Windows API releases, fixing and speeding up code parts. You trust that piece of software.\n\nWhat Linux/BSD player has more updates? In what? Show me one capable of DSD, same amount of working plugins and UI not made by 3year old kid. That's not even a competition, Foobar is superior and years ahead, so is Windows audio stack. I use Linux and root for it... but I am not blind, to be more precise - deaf this time and I am not turned into a rooting cheerleader.\n\nI did all this talk for nothing... it not only in the software side. But strict conjunction with the hardware. Audio Drivers suck hard on Linux/BSD no OSS/ALSA can fix that, don't turn it into distro challenge or Linux vs BSD, save us from that nonsense. Only after drivers are fixed you can go splitting hairs about sound backends. Bloody nobody will fix latency issues or other limitations if the device manufacturer simply does not care and blame each other for most problems. Don't indulge ourselves into esoteric talks about what's better sounding. Measure it, SINAD, hard numbers, distortion figures, harmonics. Do charts and figures then do talking. Basically human beings barely keep their pants clean, even more trust our subjective hearing capabilities. There is no point discussing it with people who rely only on their ears... considering age, service in army, hearing defects and the last one is taste preferences, people like distortion and doesn't understand that they really prefer the worst performing product, but good for them, it is cheaper that way.\n\nNot sure what you mean by that. Peter does update it all the time, including plugins and keeps up with Windows API releases, fixing and speeding up code parts. You trust that piece of software.\n\nDoes one single person develop perhaps the most popular audio player in Windows?\n\nrhythmbox has 300 developers.\n\nmusic player daemon has more than 240 developers.\n\nThese are easily understandable numerical differences.\n\nWhen I look at the software updates of Foobar2000, I see that there are hardly any (new) features added in new versions.\n\nMany of the popular old skins still do not have a 64 bit version in 2024.\n\nI also frequently see that bugs that have existed for 15 years before they get fixed.\n\nThese are the signs of a lack of manpower to deliver something of high quality.\n\nAudio Drivers suck hard on Linux/BSD no OSS/ALSA can fix that, don't turn it into distro challenge or Linux vs BSD, save us from that nonsense. Only after drivers are fixed you can go splitting hairs about sound backends.\n\n#1 foobar can do bitperfect output. MPD too, given configured properly. A lot of players is missing this option (specifically bypassing system mixer), and it making sound noticably worse.\n\nOn MacOS situation is dire (there are some players, but their UX is terrible, imo)\n\n#2 No, the quality of the sound itself isn't better. If anything a higher quality pipeline is easier in Linux IMO.\n\nOSS vs ALSA https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/oss-vs-alsa.43785/\n\nThere is very little interest in ALSA among the FreeBSD developers as far as I know and remember reading from the mailing lists.\n\nIt's down to the fact that on hardware that is supported by the FreeBSD base system the FreeBSD sound system (that isn't quite OSS but uses the OSS API) is vastly superior to ALSA.\n\nI understand the logic why many people think windows11 + foobar2000 + bitperfect ASIO should sound perfect. You think it will be the same bits as other (bitperfect) apps/operating systems that will be sent through the cable to the receiver.\n\nWith Flatpak and RPM you have a similar phenomenon. There are Flatpak developers who say this is just another way to package an app that (purely theoretically) has no impact on performance whatsoever. However, in practice I constantly measure that there are Flatpak apps that perform more than 10% lower than the RPM versions of the same app versions. With Steam you see that in (completely) CPU-bound situations the Flatpak Steam often performs lower than native Steam.\n\nFrom a purely theoretical perspective, there is no reason why macOS and BSD systems should have better audio than Windows. But go to Microsoft and compare the skills of their developers with some Linux/BSD developers.\n\nThe skills, manpower and/or work commitment of some Windows developers are often not on par with the skills of open-source developers.\n\nQ: Can I get a job at Microsoft with low grades?\n\nCan I get a job at Microsoft with low grades?\n\nAnswer: Ofcourse you can ! There is a condition however - the amount of hard work you should have put in academics will have to be put in now. Sharpen your technical skills. Get relevant experience in a profile that Microsoft hires for. It might take some time to build your resume, but it is poss...\n\nA: Ofcourse you can!\n\nI think that in the text above you will find several correct explanations why the audio that comes from Windows systems is usually of lower quality than the audio that comes from a free operating system.\n\nOnly people not keen in system programming think so.\n\nI have the Infinity Alpha 5 + Sony STR-DB790 combination.\n\nI have this setup fully custom tuned. I use the most natural settings for the receiver.\n\nThe subwoofer I have set slightly louder than the average setting and some other settings of the subwoofer are tuned as well.\n\nWhen I play music on windows or Linux on this setup, +- 65% of the songs I play sound 'very good’.\n\nHowever, when I play music on OpenBSD, 75% of the music sounds 'phenomenal'. Let's just say I can use my imagination to imagine how music might sound best.\n\nOpenBSD + music player daemon takes the best I can think of and makes it ten times better.\n\nI have heard very expensive systems in Hi-Fi shops but they were not on the same level.\n\nI bought a GXT 259 RUDOX microphone to record this sound. This is the result.\n\nThe GXT 259 RUDOX mic is a lot better than my previous mic, but is not close to the level of detail and quality needed to accurately reproduce this Infinity system.\n\nWhat is the most optimal microphone to make this type of recording?\n\nWhen I play music on windows or Linux on this setup, +- 65% of the songs I play sound 'very good’.\n\nHowever, when I play music on OpenBSD, 75% of the music sounds 'phenomenal'. Let's just say I can use my imagination to imagine how music might sound best.\n\nOpenBSD + music player daemon takes the best I can think of and makes it ten times better.\n\nHoly... I haven't seen so much contradiction in while regarding digital to analog data conversion. While you previously even argued that audio cannot differ in between audio backends, now you fully claim it does.\n\nThere is no point discussing about devs, not sure why even you started it, I asked not to bring up this BSD vs Linux nonsense. After mentioning Rythmbox it made clear where the wind blows... 300 devs barely managing to do commits to 4-6 years old problems... 300 devs... but that's GNOME for you, ain't it?\n\nRead up about signal reconstruction principles and what happens in DACs at hardware level, I mentioned it two times already... don't trust your ears, measure, hard facts. It is all snake oil you are saying here."
