        "text": "Template:wikipedia list The following is an incomplete list of Linux audio software.\n\nAudio players[]\n\nAlsaPlayer[]\n\nAlsaPlayer is a PCM player that is heavily multi-threaded and tries to exercise the ALSA library and driver quite a bit, with the goal to create a fully pluggable framework for playback of all sorts of media with the focus on PCM audio data.\n\nAmarok[]\n\nAmarok is a music player for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Amarok’s interface is designed to be intuitive. It’s a free music player for GNU / Linux and works with UNIX as well. Right now, Amarok is the most popular audio player for Linux.\n\naTunes[]\n\nATunes is a free, cross-platform audio player for operating systems supporting the Java programming language (Linux and other Unix-like OS's, Windows, Mac). aTunes is also capable of playing Internet radio streams and automatically displaying associated artist information, song videos, and song lyrics.\n\nAqualung[]\n\nAqualung plays audio CDs, internet radio streams and podcasts as well as sound files in many audio formats and supports replaygain, gapless playback, LADSPA plugins. It runs under Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.\n\nAudacious[]\n\nAudacious is a free media player for Linux or Linux-based systems. Audacious can be expanded via plugins, including support for all popular codecs. On most systems a useful set of plugins is installed by default, supporting MP3, Ogg Vorbis and FLAC files. Audacious looks and feels very similar to Winamp. It is compatible with ladspa plugins.\n\nBanshee[]\n\nBanshee is a free audio player for Linux which uses the Helix and GStreamer multimedia platforms to play, ‬encode, and decode Ogg, MP3, and other formats. Banshee supports playing and importing audio CDs and playing and synchronizing music with iPods. Banshee also has the capability of reporting played songs to a Last.fm playlist.\n\nBMP and BMPx[]\n\nBMP, also known as Beep Media Player, is a free audio player based on XMMS multimedia player (mentioned below). It looks like Winamp and also supports its skins, including XMMS’s. BMP supports most of the audio formats that XMMS does; the main difference is between plugins that these players use. BMP has been discontinued in favor of BMPx, which shares very little of BMP's codebase.\n\ncmus[]\n\ncmus is a small and fast text-mode music player for Linux and many other UNIX like operating systems.\n\nDecibel Audio Player[]\n\nDecibel Audio Player is an audio player written in Python intended to provide a clean and straightforward user interface for the GNOME desktop environment.\n\nExaile[]\n\nExaile is a free software audio player for Unix-like operating systems that aims to be functionally similar to KDE’s Amarok. Unlike Amarok, Exaile is a Python program and uses the GTK+ toolkit.\n\nGMPC (Gnome Music Player Client)[]\n\nGMPC is a front end for Music Player Daemon. It’s fast and easy to use, while still making optimal use of all the functions in mpd. N.K. Electronics, Mumbai\n\nJajuk[]\n\nJajuk is a free, cross-platform audio and Internet radio player for operating systems supporting the Java programming language. Jajuk can automatically display associated artist biographies and song lyrics. Jajuk has jukebox capabilities and comprehensive album-art search algorithms.\n\nKlactoveedsedstene[]\n\nKlactoveedsedstene is an Audio Player frontend to the popular Mplayer engine, written in Java. It has advanced support for Album Art. It recognizes embedded Album Art, and is also mostly able to find the correct Album Art from the Internet, based on the \"Artist\" and \"Album\" ID3-tags. It is very fast and compact, and can be customized in different ways, e.g. all GUI elements can be colored. Supports MP3 and WMA audio formats.\n\nmadplay[]\n\nThe madplay tool provides a lightweight command-line mp3 player.\n\nMesk[]\n\nMesk is a PyGTK+ audio player with support for mp3 and ogg vorbis.\n\nmpg123[]\n\nmpg123 [1] is a real time MPEG 1.0/2.0/2.5 audio player/decoder for layers 1,2 and 3 (MPEG 1.0 layer 3 aka MP3 most commonly tested). Among others working with Linux, MacOSX, FreeBSD, SunOS4.1.3, Solaris 2.5, HPUX 9.x, SGI Irix and Cygwin or plain MS Windows. It is free software licensed under LGPL 2.1\n\nmpg321[]\n\nmpg321 [2] is a Free replacement for mpg123, a command-line mp3 player. mpg123 is used for frontends, as an mp3 player and as an mp3 to wave file decoder (primarily for use with CD-recording software.) In all of these capacities, mpg321 can be used as a drop-in replacement for mpg123. mpg321 is shipped with some Linuxes such as Slackware.\n\nMPlayer[]\n\nMPlayer [3]: Mplayer is a crossplatform audio and video player. It currently runs on Gnu/Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, and other Unix-like systems.\n\nMusic On Console (MOC)[]\n\nMOC is an ncurses-based console audio player. It is designed to be powerful and easy to use, and its command structure and window layouts are similar to the Midnight Commander console file manager. It is very configurable, with ALSA, OSS or JACK outputs, customizable color schemes, interface layouts, key bindings, and tag parsing.\n\nQmmp[]\n\nQmmp is a free audio-player, written with the Qt toolkit. Its user interface is skinnable with Winamp skins and thus similar to Winamp or XMMS.\n\nQuod Libet[]\n\nQuod Libet is a GTK+ based audio player, written in Python. Its main distinguishing feature is its approach to music library management. Instead of categorizing the songs by genre, artist, and album, the focus is on search and display. Quod Libet supports regular expression searches of its music library, and is stated to perform efficiently with music libraries of over 10,000 titles.\n\nRhythmbox[]\n\nRhythmbox is an audio player inspired by Apple iTunes and is currently (2009) the default music player packaged with Ubuntu Linux.\n\nSonata[]\n\nSonata is a GTK+ Music player for MPD (Music player daemon).\n\nSongbird[]\n\nSongbird is a cross-platform, open-source media player and web browser. It is built using code from the Firefox web browser. The GUI is very similar to Apple iTunes, and it is also capable of syncing with Apple iPods. Like Firefox, Songbird is extensible via downloadable add-ons. Linux support for Songbird was discontinued in April, 2010.\n\nSoX[]\n\nSoX is a multi-platform command-line audio editor.\n\nVLC[]\n\nVLC can play, stream, and record sound[4]. It is a highly-portable multimedia player supporting most audio and video formats (H.264, Ogg, DivX, MKV, TS, MPEG-2, mp3, MPEG-4, aac, ...) from files, physical media (DVDs, VCD, Audio-CD), TV capture cards and many network streaming protocols. It can also convert media files, transcode and act as a streaming server over unicast or multicast and IPv4 or IPv6. It does not need external codecs or programs. The project started as a student project at the French École Centrale de Paris, in 1996. After a complete rewrite in 1998, it became Open Source, with the agreement of the École Centrale in 2001. The project started to open up to developers outside of the École. It is now a worldwide project with developers from 20 countries.\n\nXMMS and XMMS2[]\n\nXMMS (X MultiMedia System) is a GTK1-based multimedia player which works on many platforms, but has some features which only work under Linux. XMMS can play media files such as .ogg, MP3, MOD’s, WAV and others with the use of Input plugins. It is a free software audio player similar to Winamp that runs on many Unix-like operating systems. However, development of XMMS has been deprecated in favor of XMMS2, a new audio player built from scratch on the more modern GTK2 libraries.
