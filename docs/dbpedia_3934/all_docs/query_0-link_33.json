        "text": "UDisks is a Linux-only project. After !387 (merged) is merged, it becomes impossible to build gnome-control-center on FreeBSD because udisks2 library is now a hard dependency. There is a project called bsdisks, which provides an incomplete implementation of UDisks service on FreeBSD, but it doesn't solve the problem that gnome-control-center requires the client library to talk to UDisks service.\n\nWhat is the recommeded way to resolve the problem? I know the old code isn't good. It usually reports a number which I have no idea where it comes from. What should be used as a fallback when udisks2 library isn't available?"
