        "text": "I know a valid reason why people think vinyl sounds better, although a CD is technically superior. The re-releases on CD from earlier released vinyl records often sounded worse. Especially the ones that featured a SPARS code ADD. Here they took the original analog recording, then used digital equipment to (re)edit and (re)mix. I don't know what equipment that was, but the result always sounded different and seldom good. Many greatest hits compilations suffer from that same problem.\n\nDisclaimer: I don't play vinyl records any more.\n\nTieks I wasn't aware of the existence of the SPARS codes at all actually but that makes perfect sense. I volunteered at a recording studio back in Winter 2000 and even then every bit of kit they had was 16 bit. Recording from analog tape to 16 bit absolutely crushes and degrades the sound. I think compilations are particularly badly affected also because every song is adjusted to have a similar perceived loudness. But any adjustment post-mastering is bad because mastering adds inaudible high-frequency noise. Re-mastering risks \"moving\" that noise into the audible range.\n\nI used jack before. But i had after each reboot \"rewire\" the jack config which was painfull. Maybe i missed something.\n\nAlain De Vos I'm pretty sure the QT frontend for Jack, qjackctl, allows you to save all your connections to be restored later?\n\nAlso it's true that Jack doesn't play nicely with a lot of other software but that's sort of an unfair criticism because most people who use Jack will be dedicating their entire system to audio production and definitely won't be trying to watch YouTube videos, playing games, etc. If you've ever tried listening to internet-streamed music on professional speakers (monitors) you'll know why. They're designed to reveal every flaw in the source material and you can literally hear every artefact of the compression algorithm in all its jarring, grating glory.\n\nAlso it's true that Jack doesn't play nicely with a lot of other software but that's sort of an unfair criticism because most people who use Jack will be dedicating their entire system to audio production and definitely won't be trying to watch YouTube videos, playing games, etc.\n\nI don't think so. Jack was the only thing that did properly work with firefox, when at some time the default way did eat lots of cpu or do other strange things. And Jack does still work properly, with the only exception that once it was secretly upgraded from jack-1 to jack-2, and then nothing did work anymore, and I had to drop OSS-from-ports and go back to the default OSS.\n\nIn my understanding, there is a main difference, the difference between things that do work and things that do not work. And only on top of that comes the matter of quality.\n\nFor instance, if you happen to burn-in test a server board in the desktop, then there is no sound. That is *not works*. You need some device that can produce sound - and a one-dollar-fifty usb dongle will do the job. That sounds terrible, but if you need to listen to a video on how to disassemble your gadjawoo, you can then do that. So this is *works*.\n\nAnd in my experience jack usually works.\n\nyou've ever tried listening to internet-streamed music on professional speakers (monitors) you'll know why. They're designed to reveal every flaw in the source material and you can literally hear every artefact of the compression algorithm in all its jarring, grating glory.\n\nHaha, I don't have that problem. I still don't have proper speakers.\n\nI intended to buy some, but that reveals itself as a difficult issue. I cannot go to an audio shop, because after a maximum of two minutes there the sales person will be pissed of me and I will be very pissed of the salesperson - because, they want to know what sound I want to hear (and then sell me that); while I want to buy something that produces the sound that is on the media I play. So this just doesn't work out.\n\nThen I got the idea instead to buy speakers from Thomann. But that again is a difficult matter - the price-tags there are very, hm, scaleable - and I am lacking the expertise to understand what I would actually get for the money, i.e how much I should spend.\n\nPulseaudio on top of jack takes care of all that, starting with web browsers. The interesting part is that you can route the pulseaudio output through jack plugins, too.\n\nOr to different outputs. I have an audio mixer and all \"real\" jack applications go to one stereo pair and all that pulseaudio nonsense goes to a different stereo pair. Much more convenient if you want to make adjustments just to the casual stuff without messing up real audio.\n\nI actually haven't used jack seriously since circa 2010, so maybe my observations only apply to the historical jack. I recall having to do all kinds of kludges and workarounds with jack on Ubuntu including running a program to disable pulse audio whilst jack was running. There was definitely none of the interoperability you describe.\n\nSo anyway I eventually got a MacBook and oh my, does it help to have tools designed for the job. Recording music on macOS is just such a smooth ride compared to Linux. I remember saying on this forum that the free software world lacks decent music software and someone cited FFTW. But the thing is no-one has built anything good that leverages FFTW. The best effort so far in terms of effects is the CALF Studio Gear but even they sound a bit sterile and digital.\n\nTo return to analog vs digital, on macOS I use the PSP MixPack2 plugins and the Xenon limiter. The MixSaturator and MixPressor can make basically any guitar or vocal sound like it was recorded in 1969. The Xenon makes things literally sound four times as loud. There is simply nothing in the free software world that's even vaguely comparable.\n\nI don't think so.

I haven't dared to test them since.\n\nAnd yeah, salespeople make me start to curse pretty quickly too. I can't really offer advice on your prospective purchase as I'm just a hobbyist not an audiophile. All i can say is that M-Audio speakers are probably too accurate if your aim is to actually enjoy the sound. Some colouration is good.\n\nVoltaire Did you also compare sound quality on Linux between mpv->jack->alsa and direct mpv->alsa?\n\nI'll give direct mpv->alsa a try when I have time. Most people usually end up using either PulseAudio or JACK. I've used Linux as a daily driver for over 10 years and the way I remember it is that apps like Bitwig really need JACK or else they won't work.\n\ncracauer@ also said the following things.\n\nReal audio applications use jack both on Linux and on FreeBSD. The major obstacle is Chrome, which really likes pulseaudio.\n\nJackd doesn't do any resampling, it sits with a fixed sample frequency directly on the hardware. Sample rate conversion is done by applications.\n\nI expected that by using JACK I would hear a sound that is competitive. But that was anything but the case. There are a few songs that I know inside out and have actually played many times (on FreeBSD). The voice is much less expressive in ALSA+JACK and it also lacks detail in all frequencies. If the person sings low notes I can tell it's not correct, but for some reason I hear it even more strongly in the parts where the singer switches to falsetto or to extremely high notes. The singer is someone who can sing better/more correctly tonally than 99.9% of the singers, and I've never heard her sing a wrong note, even in live concerts.\n\nWhen I play those songs on ALSA+JACK and she switches to falsetto and super high notes, it just sounds really out of tune. There are artists who produce music professionally on Linux distributions so I actually think they might not have that much of an eye for detail and maybe they don't listen to artists who can sing the very highest notes flawlessly (live)."
