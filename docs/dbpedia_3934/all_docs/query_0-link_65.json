        "text": "Re: getting rid of pulse audio\n\nReply #60 – 24 September 2018, 18:47:44\n\nConfirming, I just built a Gentoo desktop with no systemd, no pulseaudio, with working xorg/firefox.\n\nNo, most people would not want to do that (myself included).\n\nA fried my laptop back in 2004 emerging the world... that's why I moved to Arch. Back in the days of i686, optimizations made a big difference; not so sure about now.\n\nRe: getting rid of pulse audio\n\nReply #61 – 24 September 2018, 20:00:26\n\nAlthough systemd crept into xorg server, gentoo users can simply disable systemd globally in every package.\n\nGentoo developers also forked udev as eudev. On gentoo linux, if you build firefox, firefox supports ALSA.\n\nDon't worry too much. My gentoo system is free from systemd and pulseaudio and elogind although I couldn't break free from dbus. Even BSD desktops can't break free from dbus, either.\n\nIf you want non-trivial customizations or want to avoid RedHat desktop softwares as much as possible, Gentoo is the only linux distribution for you.\n\nI've killed dbus. I use wmaker and don't need that junk. I can use mount and can read dmesg. The biggest problem is what I need for CUPS.\n\nRe: getting rid of pulse audio\n\nReply #62 – 24 September 2018, 21:06:02\n\nOne thing though, is it is increasingly harder to just find a stream link and plug it into a video player. They are doing their damnedest to track you and tie you down.\n\nYeah that's the biggest problem. Video in browsers is one of the crappier things about the modern web. I'm not sure what your normal habits are, but I only ever watch video on youtube (on occasion) which thankfully can be easily grabbed with youtube-dl and sent to mpv. Youtube-dl works on some other sites as well, but in general I just don't listen to any audio or watch any video in browser.\n\nRe: getting rid of pulse audio\n\nReply #63 – 24 September 2018, 22:53:14\n\nThis has been an issue for Gentoo users who (used to) have a choice regarding compile flags, and whether to use oss/alsa/pulse/jack or whatever they wanted, but the truth is, this has to be handled by Mozilla, it's not a distro thing, maybe we should all start seriously bugging the Mozilla Foundation about it... There are enough people who don't want pulse, for both philosophical and practical reasons (resampling, for one). There are people saying v57 could be compiled against ALSA again, but it's probably not high up on their priorities list.\n\nA lot of times, for youtube and other *tube sites, I use youtube-dl, on firefox you can install the 'open with' extension and point it to mpv or smplayer, it will automagically invoke youtube-dl in the background and start playing it outside the browser. It's dirty but it works.\n\nOn a side note, I was looking at an alternative to Android (sailfish) ... and it looked interesting, but it's using systemd+pulse. What the actual F#(&^$(#&$....\n\nI have no pulseaudio package installed. I do have libpulse. The sound in Firefox works (62.0.2). The sound in Waterfox works (56.2.3).\n\nThe arch Firefox package is built with an --enable-alsa flag.\n\nIt is worrying that this alsa support may be removed in the future but at present it works fine. Pulseaudio is an optional dependency\n\nI must be missing something ?\n\nRe: getting rid of pulse audio\n\nReply #64 – 25 September 2018, 03:00:22\n\nI have no pulseaudio package installed. I do have libpulse.\n\nAs was already discussed, that is also unwanted.\n\nRe: getting rid of pulse audio\n\nReply #65 – 25 September 2018, 11:49:46\n\nAs was already discussed, that is also unwanted.\n\nThe reason I posted is there seems to be an acceptance that Firefox does not have sound without pulseaudio but it does , by default , on Arch and therefore Artix.\n\nFrom what I can gather the only change made at the time it was widely reported that Alsa support had been removed from Firefox was that Alsa support was no longer compiled in by default.

No Pulseaudio server, no Pulseaudio.\n\nI do accept that you may have your own, entirely valid, reasons for wanting to purge your system of all traces of pulse and I would imagine it's entirely possible.\n\nAs others have suggested Gentoo would allow this. Personally when I tried Gentoo a long time ago it got very old , very quickly, constantly re-compiling everything.\n\nOr you could just make your own custom PKGBUILD's to remove Pulseaudio where possible. And if it proves problematic with some programs then resort to alternatives.\n\nThankfully you won't have an issue with Firefox at present\n\nRe: getting rid of pulse audio\n\nReply #66 – 26 September 2018, 01:43:25\n\nThe reason I posted is there seems to be an acceptance that Firefox does not have sound without pulseaudio but it does , by default , on Arch and therefore Artix.\n\nFrom what I can gather the only change made at the time it was widely reported that Alsa support had been removed from Firefox was that Alsa support was no longer compiled in by default.
