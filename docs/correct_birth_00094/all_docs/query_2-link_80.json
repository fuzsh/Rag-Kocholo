        "text": "George Bernard Shaw was born July 26, 1856 in Dublin Ireland to George Carr Shaw and Lucinda Elizabeth Gurly Shaw.[1] Though technically belonging to the landed Irish gentry, Bernard Shaw grew up poor.[2] George’s mother was a musician and a singer and greatly influenced him throughout his childhood.[3] Shaw credits his mother for cultivating his social consciousness, individualism, and self-expressionism.[4] With her guidance, he learned to rebel against repression. In regards to his early education Shaw said, “The word education brought to my mind four successive schools where my parents got me out of the way for half the day. In these crèches (daycare) – for that is exactly what they were – I learned nothing. How could I have been such a sheep as to go to them… They did me a great deal of harm, and no good whatever.” [5] In 1976, right before Shaw turned 20, he moved to London to live with his mother who had moved there three years earlier to pursue her music career. During his first few years in London, Shaw tried numerous professions but was met with failure after failure. First he tried musical criticism, then writing blank verse, and then he tried to become a novelist, all of which did not go anywhere.[6] It wasn’t until he started to become involved in the academic and political discourse of the time that Shaw began to find his way. He joined groups such as the Zeletical Society, a debate group, where he met other activists such as Sydney and Beatrice Webb.[7] He soaked in as much knowledge as he could, reading books like Marx’s Capital and listening to speakers such as Henry George.[8] In 1884, Shaw, with the help of the two Webbs, founded the Fabian society which was a socialist organization.[9] The purpose of the organization was to create political and social reform through gradual change via established channels of power.[10] As the society grew, it had significant impact on English politics. Because of his superior writing skills, Shaw became the most prominent member of this organization. With all this writing for the Fabian Society, Shaw was discovered by drama critic William Archer who employed him as a critic starting in 1885.[11] Shaw spent time as an art critic, a music critic, and finally a theater critic. It was at this time that he also began writing plays and studying the work of Henrik Ibsen. He gave a speech in 1890 to the Fabian society where he revealed his admiration but also criticism of Ibsen and in 1891 he wrote The Quintessence of Ibsenism.[12] In 1892, Shaw publishes his first play Widower’s Houses and after that the steam of plays and other writings from Shaw was unstoppable.[13] In 1898, Shaw married Charlotte Payne-Townshend who was a wealthy Irish heiress and a fellow Fabian. Shaw’s popularity and influence grows and in 1925 he is awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. However, the Nobel Prize was not the first honor he had been offered but it was one of the first that he accepted.[14] Over a period of nearly six decades, Shaw wrote fifty one play though his contemporaries saw him as less of a dramatist and more as a moral and political agitator.[15] George Bernard Shaw died in 1950 at ninety-five years old but his legacy lives on in theater, politics, critique, and philosophy."
