        "text": "He was the son of Bernard Shaw and Frances Carr of Kilkenny, At the age of eleven, he found himself fatherless, with Bernard Shaw passing away. By 1838, he took up a clerical role at Todhunters, a merchant firm, where he worked for seven years. It appears that, around 1845, he secured a position as a servant at the Four Courts, possibly due to the influence of Sir Frederick Shaw, Recorder of Dublin. The nature of this role is unclear, but it seems to have been a sort of sinecure. In 1851, when the position was abolished, Shaw received an annual pension of forty-four pounds.\n\nOn 17th June 1852, at the age of 38, George Carr Shaw married Lucinda Elizabeth Gurly, who was 22 years old at the time, the daughter of Walter Gurly. The couple had three children Lucinda Frances Shaw, Elinor Agnes Shaw and George Bernard Shaw, who later became a renowned playwright. Much of the detail of George Carr Shaw’s life comes from biographies of George Bernard Shaw, who had a complex relationship with this father and his mother. George Bernard Shaw described his father as an “ineffectual” and an “alcoholic”. Due to speculation, George Bernard Shaw harboured a lifelong obsession that George John Lee, a figure in Dublin’s musical circles, might have been his biological father. The Lee and Shaws shared different houses throughout their lifetime."
