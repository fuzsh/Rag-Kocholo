        "meta_description": "George Bernard was born just a short step from the pub that now bears his name, and the playwright’s socialist spirit is at least partially present in the pub’s guiding ethos.The owners have successfully created an atmosphere of art, music, fun and friendliness.that Live bands, DJs, artwork, quizzes and quirky outdoor events make up the entertainment, while the aging building itself is creaky and cozy in equal measure. Eye-catching murals sit contrastingly on each side of The George Bernard Shaw’s old-school façade, and the whole place exudes the kind of joie de vivre the writer himself may well have applauded.",
