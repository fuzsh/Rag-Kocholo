He wrote over sixty plays in his lifetime and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1925.\n\nBernard Shaw had a strong character not to everybody’s taste. He staunchly supported controversial ideas of all scales, from alphabet reform to eugenics. He made some very unpopular remarks that implied that both sides of the Second World War were equally culpable, and also expressed sympathy for both Stalin and Mussolini.  Despite these things, his plays are revered. Some critics think he is bettered only by Shakespeare and many modern playwrights have said that his work has been a strong influence of theirs.  \n\nThe popularity of 'Pygmalion' has been consistent. The play is about a cockney flower girl called Eliza Doolittle who is taken under the wing of a professor of phonetics. Henry Higgins makes a bet that he can pass Eliza off as an upper class lady, just by changing her voice over a six month period. The play premiered in London’s West End in 1914 starring Mrs Patrick Campbell as Eliza and Herbert Beerbohn Tree as Henry Higgins. The stage musical of the play appeared in 1956 and a world famous film called 'My Fair Lady' was produced in 1964, starring Audrey Hepburn as Eliza.\".",
