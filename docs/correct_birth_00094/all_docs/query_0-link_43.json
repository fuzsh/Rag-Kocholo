        "text": "At meetings this week, Dublin city councillors tried to arrange a screening at Smithfield of the All-Ireland football final, talked about plans for George Bernard Shaw’s birthplace, and more.\n\nFáilte Ireland has agreed to transfer 33 Synge Street to Dublin City Council. Now it’s time to brainstorm ideas for how the council could use the building.\n\nKeeping the Nobel Prize winner’s former home as a museum hasn’t really worked out. So Dublin City Council is looking into giving it a new life, with a new purpose.\n\nDublin Inquirer is an independent, subscriber-funded newspaper serving Ireland's capital since 2015, publishing online weekly and in print monthly.\n\nThis publication supports the work of the Press Council of Ireland and the Office of the Press Ombudsman, and our staff operate within the Code of Practice. You can obtain a copy of the code, or contact the council, at presscouncil.ie, Lo-call 1890 208 080 or email: info@presscouncil.ie."
