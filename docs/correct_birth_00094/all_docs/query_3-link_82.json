George Bernard Shaw was an Irish playwright, critic, and political activist. He was one of the co-founders of the London School of Economics. Shaw wrote over 60 plays that addressed prevailing social issues through comedy and stark themes. He was an ardent socialist and wrote for the Fabian Society. Shaw received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1925 and an Academy Award for adapting his play Pygmalion into a film in 1938, making him the only person to receive both awards. He lived from 1856 to 1950.",
