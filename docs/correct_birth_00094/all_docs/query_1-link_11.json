        "meta_description": "3 reviews and 8 photos of GEORGE BERNARD SHAW'S BIRTHPLACE - CLOSED \"So often visiting the birthplace of a famous person requires the visitor to compensate a great deal for the lack of any tangible evidence of what motivated the occupant to greater glory. Too often you are presented with display cases in rooms where it is very difficult to imagine anyone ever living. The Bronte House in Howarth, Yorkshire is still sadly a prime example of this. In fact very often a famous writers house can appear nothing more than a shell.\nIt is very much to the credit of the George Bernard Shaw birthplace, that this is not the case, and an awful lot of thought and imagination has gone into this making this house seem distinctly not like a museum.\n\n\n GBS spent the first 20 years of his life here, and the familiar long bearded image of him in later life, is one hard to shake, (He died in 1950 at the age of 94, having lived through momentous times of social & industrial change). But a rarely seen, almost Stan Laurel-like photograph of a late teenage GBS, complete with bowler hat that looks at least 2 sizes too small, reveals that this famous old man of letters was once indeed a fresh faced youth.\nShaw's mother was a talented mezzo-soprano and regularly held musical evenings at the house, (where she carried on an affair with her singing teacher, under the nose of GBS's far too drunk too notice father. When GBS was 16, she ran off to London with him, her 2 daughters from a previous marriage in tow, but leaving poor young George, (we're told he detested this name), & his father in poverty, having sold all the family possessions to fund her move. All the more interesting then if you consider the effort that has been put into reassembling this impressive collection so that the place is a veritable gold mine of Shaw memorabilia.\n\n\n So what evidence have we here for the great playwright, prolific letter-writer, satirist, vegetarian, pioneering socialist, (who knew men as diverse as HG Wells and Stalin), and an outspoken critic who was never afraid of upsetting the status quo by speaking his mind?\nShaw's later miserable recollections of a devilish childhood brought up by the family servants, showed this was never a particularly happy environment even before his mother left. But even though we know that GBS lived for another 70 years in England after leaving this house, the character, determination & courage of the man was most definitely born here, and in the well presented, if quaintly archaic audio cassette guide included, you are certainly transported back to Dublin in the mid 19th century, and in essence what we are presented with here is a totally absorbing & highly convincing time capsule of not just Shaw's formative years, but his whole life as well.\n\n\n Note: Seasonal opening from March to October, and there only seems ever to be one custodian on duty, so the house does close for an hours lunch between 1pm and 2pm.\"",
