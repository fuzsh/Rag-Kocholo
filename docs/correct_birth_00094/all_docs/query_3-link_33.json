        "text": "Shaw was born on July 26, 1856, in Dublin, Ireland. He did not like school so he left at an early age to go to work. In 1876 Shaw decided to become a writer and moved to London, where his mother and sister had already settled.\n\nIn the following years, Shaw wrote novels but could not get anyone to publish them. He had very little money. He spent most of his days in the British Museum Reading Room, writing, thinking, and studying to make up for his lack of education.\n\nIn the 1880s Shaw continued to struggle to have his novels published, but he became interested in several causes that kept him busy. One of those causes was socialism. He wanted to see changes in British society. Shaw became an early member of a group called the Fabian Society that shared his views. The group was devoted to establishing socialism in Britain. They gave lectures and published essays to promote their cause. In the 1880s Shaw also found work as a journalist, theater critic, and playwright. He began to achieve recognition for his work.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw’s plays were quite different than the other plays being performed at the time. They often made comments about the social culture of the time, touched on tragedy, and explored human relationships. They contained wit and humor too.\n\nOne of Shaw’s most popular plays is Pygmalion, which was written in 1912. The play was filmed in 1938. A musical version of the play, My Fair Lady, was first produced on stage in 1956 and filmed in 1964. The play examines the culture of class in Britain and the way society treats people differently depending on their economic status."
