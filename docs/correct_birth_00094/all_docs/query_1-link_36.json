He was the only person to have been awarded both a Nobel Prize in Literature (1925)[1] and an Oscar (1938), for his contributions to literature and for his work on the film Pygmalion, until Bob Dylan received both[2].\n\nShaw was born in Synge Street, Dublin, on 26 July 1856, the only son and youngest of three children of George Carr Shaw (1814–85), a civil servant, and Lucinda Elizabeth Shaw, (née Gurly; 1830–1913), an aspiring singer and music teacher. He had two sisters, Lucinda Frances (1853–1920), a singer of musical comedy and light opera, and Elinor Agnes (1855–76), who died young of tuberculosis.\n\nIn 1898, Shaw married Charlotte Payne-Townshend[3], a fellow Fabian, whom he survived. They settled in Ayot St Lawrence in a house now called Shaw's Corner. The 1939 register shows George and his wife Charlotte living in this house, where George describes himself as an author, journalist and playwright. [4]. Shaw died there, aged 94,[5] from chronic problems exacerbated by injuries he incurred by falling from a ladder.\n\n1901 Census Name: George B Shaw Event Type: Census Event Date: 31 Mar 1901 Event Place: St Martin in the Fields, Middlesex, England, United Kingdom County: London, Middlesex Civil Parish: St Martin In The Fields Ecclesiastical Parish: St Michael'S Sub-District: St Martin In The Fields Registration District: Strand Sex: Male Age: 44 Occupation: AUTHOR Relationship to Head of Household: Head Birth Year (Estimated): 1857 Birthplace: Ireland Schedule Type: 52 Page Number: 6[6]\n\nHousehold Role Sex Age Birthplace\n\nGeorge B Shaw Head M 44 Ireland\n\nCharlotte F Shaw Wife F 44 Ireland\n\nMary Farmer Servant F 35 Bromley By Bow, London\n\nAnnie Kilner Servant F 27 Probably, Surrey\n\n1911 Census Name: George Bernard Shaw Event Type: Census Event Date: 1911 Event Place: Ayot St Lawrence, Hertfordshire, England, United Kingdom County: Hertfordshire Parish: Ayot St Lawrence Sub-District: Welwyn Sub-District Number: 2 District Number: 138 Enumeration District: 5 Registration District: Hatfield Sex: Male Age: 54 Marital Status: Married Marital Status (Original): MARRIED Occupation: AUTHOR AND PLAYWRIGHT Industry: LITERATURE AND DRAMA Number in Family: 6 Birth Year (Estimated): 1857 Birthplace: City Ireland Residents, County Dublin Relationship to Head of Household: Head Schedule Type: 13 Page Number: 1 Registration Number: RG14 Piece/Folio: 27 Affiliate Record Identifier: GBC/1911/RG14/07652/0027/1[7]\n\nHousehold Role Sex Age Birthplace\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw Head M 54 City Ireland Residents, County Dublin\n\nCharlotte Frances Shaw Wife F 53 Rossearbery Co Park Residents, County Cork\n\nHarry Batcholer Higgs Servant M 36 Windlesham, Surrey\n\nClara Rebecca Higgs Servant F 36 East Barnet, Hertfordshire\n\nKate Elizabeth Hodgman Servant F 44 Bobbing, Kent\n\nEmma Hodgman Servant F 41 Bobbing, Kent\n\nSources\n\n↑ Nobel Prize Facts\n\n↑ Wikipedia - 11th_Academy_Awards\n\n↑ Name: George Bernard Shaw Event Type: Marriage Event Place: Strand, London, England Registration District: Strand County: London Registration Quarter: Apr-May-Jun Registration Year: 1898 Volume: 1B Affiliate Line Number: 97 Possible Spouse: Albert Henry Soper Possible Spouse: Florence Rosina Stevens Possible Spouse: Charlotte Frances P Townshend Page: 1217 Citing this Record \"England and Wales Marriage Registration Index, 1837-2005,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2697-RG6 : 22 May 2014), George Bernard Shaw, 1898; from \"England & Wales Marriages, 1837-2005,\" database, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : 2012); citing 1898, quarter 2, vol. 1B, p. 1217, Strand, London, England, General Register Office, Southport, England.\n\n↑ Findmypast 1939 Register Ref: RG101/1675B/009/25 Letter Code:\n\n↑ Name: George B Shaw Event Type: Death Registration Quarter: Oct-Nov-Dec Registration Year: 1950 Registration District: Hatfield County: Hertfordshire Event Place: Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England Age: 94 Birth Year (Estimated): 1856 Volume: 4B Affiliate Line Number: 92 Page: 40 Citing this Record \"England and Wales Death Registration Index 1837-2007,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVCX-9VK8 : 4 September 2014), George B Shaw, 1950; from \"England & Wales Deaths, 1837-2006,\" database, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : 2012); citing Death, Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England, General Register Office, Southport, England.\n\n↑ Citing this Record \"England and Wales Census, 1901,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:X9D4-LWB : 20 May 2019), George B Shaw, St Martin in the Fields, Middlesex, England, United Kingdom; from \"1901 England, Scotland and Wales census,\" database and images, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : n.d.); citing St Martin In The Fields subdistrict, PRO RG 13, The National Archives, Kew, Surrey.\n\n↑ Record Type: Household Line Number: 1 Citing this Record \"England and Wales Census, 1911,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:X7LS-PQL : 21 July 2019), George Bernard Shaw, Ayot St Lawrence, Hertfordshire, England, United Kingdom; from \"1911 England and Wales census,\" database and images, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : n.d.); citing PRO RG 14, The National Archives of the UK, Kew, Surrey.\n\nFind A Grave: Memorial #21639 Find a Grave, database and images (https://www.findagrave.com : accessed 15 March 2021), memorial page for George Bernard Shaw (26 Jul 1856–2 Nov 1950), Find a Grave Memorial no. 21639, ; Maintained by Find A Grave Cremated, Ashes scattered, who reports a Scattered in the Graden of their home, Shaws Corner in Ayot Saint Lawrence, Hertfordshire, England.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw Wikipedia article\n\nWikidata: Item Q19185\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw WikiSource with links to the playwright's works\n\nList of Works by George Bernard Shaw Wikipedia\n\nBurke, John.
