        "text": "Shaw began his education by reading John Stuart Mill, Auguste Comte, Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer, and was converted to socialism by Henry George's Progress and Poverty. Moving on to Karl Marx's Das Kapital, he began preaching socialism with the utmost zeal and enthusiasm[8] at socialist rallies, or just standing on soapboxes at Speaker's Corner in London's Hyde Park.[9]\n\nAfter reading the first Fabian tract, Why are the many poor? in 1884, Shaw joined the Fabian Society, which, he wrote, \"set up the banner of Socialism militant.\"[10] He began writing Fabian tracts, and personally converted Sidney Webb to socialism, recruiting him into the Fabian Society.[11]\n\nUnited States Constitution\n\nBernard Shaw believed the Constitution ought to be abolished, as it kept getting in the way of FDR.\n\n“ I told you what to do and you haven't done it. And you're up to your neck in trouble, in consequence. I told you in New York. I put it to you very carefully and exactly. I told you that what you had to do in this country was to abolish your constitution, which was preventing you from doing anything. And now you see what's happened since. Every attempt you've made to do anything the Supreme Court immediately stops it and says it's against the constitution.\n\nWell, I tell you again to get rid of your Constitution. But I suppose you won't do it. You have a good president and you have a bad Constitution, and the bad Constitution gets the better of the good President all the time. The end of it will be is that you might as well have an English Prime Minister.[12]\n\n”\n\nStalinism\n\nAt the invitation of Stalin, Shaw visited the Soviet Union[13] in 1931, at age 75.[14] He became a loyal apologist for Stalinism, reporting the Gulag to be a kind of luxury vacation spa, its large population due solely to \"the difficulty of inducing [prisoners] to come out... As far as I could make out they could stay as long as they liked.\"[15] On the last day of his pilgrimage, he said, \"Tomorrow I leave this land of hope and return to our Western countries of despair.\"[16]\n\nIn 1933, Shaw wrote a Letter to the Editor of the Manchester Guardian, denouncing Malcolm Muggeridge's exposé of Stalin's Terror Famine as a \"lie\" and a \"slander\"; the following year he published a 16,000-word apologia for Stalin's mass murders, in which he expressed sympathy for the \"unfortunate Commissar\" who \"found himself obliged to put a pistol in his pocket and with his own hand shoot\" disobedient workers, \"so that he might the more impressively ask the rest of the staff whether they yet grasped the fact that orders are meant to be executed.\" Shaw went on to attack the rule of law, in favor of the arbitrary rule of men, adding:\n\n“ [T]he most elaborate code of [law]... would still have left unspecified a hundred ways in which wreckers of Communism could have sidetracked it without ever having to face the essential questions: are you pulling your weight in the social boat? are you giving more trouble than you are worth? have you earned the privilege of living in a civilized community? That is why the Russians were forced to set up an Inquisition or Star Chamber, called at first the Cheka and now the Gay Pay Oo (Ogpu), to go into these questions and \"liquidate\" persons who could not answer them satisfactorily.[17] ”\n\nIn 1936, Shaw publicly defended Stalin's Great Terror, saying, “Even in the opinion of the bitterest enemies of the Soviet Union and of her government, the [purge] trials have clearly demonstrated the existence of active conspiracies against the regime... I am convinced that this is the truth, and I am convinced that it will carry the ring of truth even in Western Europe, even for hostile readers.”[18] Shaw likewise defended Stalin's mass executions, scolding, \"we cannot afford to give ourselves moral airs when our most enterprising neighbor... humanely and judiciously liquidates a handful of exploiters and speculators...\"[19]\n\nIn 1948, Shaw said:\n\n“ I am a communist, but not a member of the Communist Party. Stalin is a first rate Fabian. I am one of the founders of Fabianism and as such very friendly to Russia.[20] ”\n\nIn 1949, he repeated the point, writing, \"I am a Communist and always call myself so.\" The British Communist Party had blundered in failing to tell British voters that, according to Shaw, \"in Russia, private enterprise flourishes more than ever.\" He also argued that the Communists should support the Marshall Plan, which, he said, \"is for the moment absolutely necessary.\"[21] That year Shaw even wrote a defense of Stalin's pseudo-scientific Lysenkoism.\n\nEugenics\n\nIn addition to socialism, Shaw was an advocate of eugenics. \"Extermination must be put on a scientific basis if it is ever to be carried out humanely and apologetically as well as thoroughly,\" he wrote. \"[I]f we desire a certain type of civilization and culture we must exterminate the sort of people who do not fit into it.\"[22] In one public address, recorded in a March 5, 1931 newsreel, Shaw gave expression to the Nazi doctrine of \"life unworthy of life\" (Lebensunwertes Leben):[23]\n\n“ You must all know half a dozen people at least who are no use in this world, who are more trouble than they are worth. Just put them there and say Sir, or Madam, now will you be kind enough to justify your existence?\n\nIf you can’t justify your existence, if you’re not pulling your weight, and since you won't, if you’re not producing as much as you consume or perhaps a little more, then, clearly, we cannot use the organizations of our society for the purpose of keeping you alive, because your life does not benefit us and it can’t be of very much use to yourself.[24]\n\n”\n\nOne of Shaw's long-term obsessions was mass murder by means of poison gas. In a 1910 lecture before the Eugenics Education Society, he said:\n\n“ We should find ourselves committed to killing a great many people whom we now leave living... A part of eugenic politics would finally land us in an extensive use of the lethal chamber. A great many people would have to be put out of existence simply because it wastes other people's time to look after them.[25] ”\n\nIn the BBC's weekly magazine, Shaw made a 1933 \"appeal to the chemists to discover a humane gas that will kill instantly and painlessly. Deadly by all means, but humane not cruel...\"[26] His appeal would shortly come to fruition in Nazi Germany. As Robert Jay Lifton notes in The Nazi Doctors, \"The use of poison gas—first carbon monoxide and then Zyklon B—was the technological achievement permitting 'humane killing.'\"[27]\n\nShaw admired not just Stalin, but Mussolini and even Hitler.[28] He despised freedom, writing, \"Mussolini... Hitler and the rest can all depend on me to judge them by their ability to deliver the goods and not by... comfortable notions of freedom.\"[29]\n\nIn the midst of the Battle of Britain, when the Wehrmacht, having routed the British at Dunkirk, was poised on the English Channel and the Luftwaffe was bombing London nightly, Shaw was asked what he would do if he were Prime Minister, if the Nazis invaded. Shaw replied, \"Welcome them as tourists.\"[30]\n\nShaw has also been criticized as anti-Semitic: he once exhorted Jews to \"stop being Jews and start being human beings.\"[31]\n\nUnlike most eugenicists, who recoiled in horror from the implications of eugenics after World War II, when the horrors of Nazism were exposed to the world, Shaw continued to advocate it, writing in 1948 that we should enslave “a considerable class of persons” who, according to him, “cannot fend for themselves.” Placed under “tutelage, superintendence, and provided sustenance,” such people, says Shaw, “make good infantry soldiers and well-behaved prisoners.” His prescription: “Reorganize their lives for them; and do not prate foolishly about their liberty.”\n\nShaw continued to advocate mass murder, calling it “kindly but ruthless judicial liquidation”—not for murderers, but for “the criminal you cannot reform” –- career criminals, even those who commit petty crimes.\n\nIn addition to recidivists, the death penalty should be applied, he wrote, to “idiots” and “morons”: “Do not punish them. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill them.” Shaw admitted that most of these people are “quite incapable of committing a murder,” but argued that “the increase or decrease of crime is not the point at issue.” They should be killed, according to Shaw, simply because they are incapable of “paying their way.”\n\nClarifying that he was advocating mass murder, Shaw added that “on this principle we shall liquidate many more human nuisances than at present if we are to the weed the garden thoroughly.”"
