        "text": "Irish dramatist George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950) was a literary critic, a socialist spokesman and a leading figure in the 20th century theater. Although his first profitable writing was music and literary criticism, in which capacity he wrote many highly articulate pieces of journalism, his main talent was for drama and he wrote more than 60 plays. Nearby all his writings deal sternly with prevailing social problems but have a vein of comedy to make their stark themes more palatable. Shaw examined education, marriage, religion, government, health care and class privilege and found them all defective. He was most angered by the exploitation of the working class and most of his writings censure\n\nTo be a real playwright or to leave playwriting at all is George Bernard Shaw's turning point in the beginning of his playwriting career and Widowers' Houses, his first play, is a challenge after his failure in his previous five novels. The playwright criticises the magnates' sources of income and the negative effect of this income on the matrimonial life. With the help of William Archer, Shaw defies all the vows of Victorian norms and portraits his new logocentric thinking. The dramatist calls for woman's repudiation to social norms whereas his example of woman in this play exceeds his expectations and she manages to achieve her ends in the society she lives in successfully. Woman character in this play is not only supported to liberate herself and to become free woman in a patriarchal society but also she is enlisted to save her father and fiancé from the curse of their 'tainted' income. She challenges the conventional patterns and she flips them upside down in a way seemingly to say that social norms are what can be accepted rationally and what cannot, will be reversed so as to make it acceptable in a rational way.\n\nGahan's path-breaking book rereads Shaw's writing, dramatic and non-dramatic, against the background of critical theory in order to reassess its radical influence in both its own time and ours. Though sometimes dismissed as merely witty, Shaw should be considered one of the progenitors of contemporary literary studies, Gahan says, in that his work actually allows for ideas of theorists such as Derrida and Lacan. Gahan first considers Shaw's poststructuralist pioneering thinking in a general, philosophical way. Taking a fresh and thoughtful look at a wealth of readings, he examines Shaw's criticism and autobiographical writing, in which questions of authorship and subjectivity were crucial. Gahan looks at essays on music, science, and politics and at Shaw's critique of Darwinian theory, in which he calls for a new metaphysics within the discourse of science. In concentrating on his less familiar plays, Gahan shows how Shaw incorporated themes like writing, language, meaning, and authorship into his playwriting, while acknowledging an awareness of the subjectivity of human experience in general and of the writer's experience in particular. For the first time, the play cycle Back to Methuselah--the work Shaw considered his magnum opus--is examined as central to the oeuvre. This book heralds a major shift in the future of Shaw studies, restoring Shaw to his rightful place as a major intellectual figure and writer, as one of the most important authors and dramatists of the early 20th century. And it positions the Shaw text as pivotal in the historical break in Western culture between Victorian and modern worlds.\n\nThis study is about how social mobility is reflected in George Bernard Shaw’s Arms and the Man playwright. The aim of this study is to describe the indicators of the social mobility, to analyze the depiction of social mobility, and to reveal the reason why Shaw illustrated the social mobility in his play. In analyzing this play, the researcher uses the Marxist perspective and the qualitative method. The study comes to the following conclusions. Firstly, there are three indicators of social mobility i.e. occupational, property and authority structure. Secondly, the depiction of the social mobility is depicted through the plot and characters of the play. Thirdly, the reason why the author writes the play is to criticize about the society in that era. He wants to awaken the public opinion about the social problem in their environment."
