Melbourne is a UNESCO City of Literature too, so I shall feel right at home.\n\nI will, of course, be visiting the James Joyce museum and you can expect to see photos of me with every literary statue I can find. (Mind you, I have not yet worked out the intricacies of blogging from overseas. Lo-Tech Lisa has no idea how to do it by phone except that I think I’d be cross-eyed trying to type anything of any substance on a little phone. As for adding photos, how do you edit amateur snaps so that they look presentable, on a phone?? And how on earth do you do it without it costing a fortune???)\n\nCan I, in a mere four days, visit:\n\nThe Book of Kells\n\nThe Chester Beatty Library at Dublin Castle\n\nThe Dublin Writers Museum\n\nThe James Joyce Museum in the Martello Tower\n\nthe National Library of Ireland\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw’s birthplace\n\nThe Long Room, Trinity College??\n\nAre there are Dubliners who read this blog? What’s open in Dublin on a Sunday morning? I’d love to hear from you!\n\nYou can see them all in four days but would need to plan it out. The Long Room is open on Sunday mornings from 9.30 in the summer (and includes the Book of Kells) and The Writers’ Museum opens at 11 on Sundays. The Shaw birthplace is open the least and is closed Sundays and Mondays.\n\nDublin is very excited about joining Melbourne as a City of Literature. Here’s some of the more excited children’s writers and illustrators at the launch this morning http://www.facebook.com/#!/album.php?aid=200550&id=137934348937\n\nDon’t worry, Kim, I had pencilled in Hodges Figgis\n\nas a pitstop to top up the book supply before heading off for Bordeaux and Spain where books in English may not be so easy to find. I have promised The Spouse not to fill up a backbreaking suitcase and will have the Kindle, but I have to have some real books too in case I have trouble charging it.\n\nCan you email me privately so that we can make a time to meet that fits around your work commitments? We’re staying in Bloomsbury…\n\nAh you’ll have a magnificent time Lisa. I went to Hodges Figgis as well. It’s a very handy location just a block down from Marco Pierre White’s Steakhouse, which I really do recommend- it was fantastic. I’m sure you’ll work up a hunger or a thirst in the bookshop. There was also a magnificent cheese shop very near there too. As a few people have pointed out The Book of Kells and The Long Room are both in the same place, and it’s the same admission fee. Do be very careful with Sunday planning, as I think you realise. Most things aren’t open in the morning, and the churches are off limits. I didn’t get to the writer’s centre but wanted to. You haven’t even mentioned Oscar Wilde’s house! And my DK guide had a great literary guided walk. So much to do…."
