        "text": "This collection consists of an autograph card signed laid into a typescript carbon copy of Miriam Michelson's \"The Duchess Barbara [of Leeds].\" The card is addressed to Fred Terry of the Royal General Theatrical Fund. Shaw mentions \"I know my place too well; and it is not, alas! on the stage.\" Shaw appears to be responding to Terryâ€™s request of him to appear in a play.\n\nThe typed carbon playscript displays the title as \"The Duchess Barbara\" on the cover page. The name \"Barbara\" has been crossed out and in pencil reads \"of Leeds.\" The subtitle is \"A Slightly Historical Drama, Careless of Chronology, Indifferent to Facts, and Frankly Fanciful. In Four Acts.\" Also on the cover page are two names, including Fred Terry. Within the typed playscript there are instances of underlining in red pen as well as autograph corrections.\n\nThis collection also includes a cloth cover of the playscript with \"The De Mille Company, Author's Representative, Astor Theatre, Broadway and 45th St., New York City\" inscribed. It is noted as \"Set No. 2.\" Inside the cover, there is some writing in pencil and there is additional writing on the back cover. It was apparently used as a prompt copy."
