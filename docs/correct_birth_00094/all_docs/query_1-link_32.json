        "text": "Two exiled Irish writers influenced British culture in important ways as the 19th century turned. George Bernard Shaw and Oscar Wilde were both dramatists and polemicists. Shaw was a Dublin-born middle-class Protestant who by the 1920s had worked his way from an apprentice clerkship to a position as one of Europe’s most influential men of letters. Shavian became the adjective used to describe the witty epithets that punctuate Shaw’s writing and serve as the glue that holds together works that could often be didactic and dramatically stilted. Over the course of a long career, Shaw produced some 50 plays, five novels, and innumerable political and cultural essays. He played the part of the engaged public intellectual with insistence and courage, making himself unpopular in England with his criticism of World War I and his campaigns against the executions of the leaders of the Easter Rising. A member of the socialist Fabian Society, Shaw condemned what he called “middle-class morality” and its strictures. Most of his plays were, in fact, modern morality plays, influenced, at least early in his career, by the realism and feminism of Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. Many of his early plays had to wait years before appearing in London; frequently his work would instead open in Germany or the United States. Among these plays were the then-scandalous Mrs. Warren’s Profession (written 1893, performed 1902), which tackled the moral economy of prostitution; Arms and the Man (performed 1894), which subverted the conventions of romantic drama to undermine the ideals of war; and his first financial success, The Devil’s Disciple (performed 1897), in which Shaw, this time inverting the conventions of contemporary melodrama, took apart two more “ideals”—those of family and marriage.\n\n(Read George Bernard Shaw’s 1926 Britannica essay on socialism.)\n\nShaw’s middle-period plays—including Caesar and Cleopatra (performed 1901); John Bull’s Other Island (performed 1904), the only play that dealt specifically with the Irish situation; Man and Superman (performed 1905); and Major Barbara (performed 1905)—established him as the leading playwright in London, particularly after Wilde’s disgrace in 1895. By the time of Pygmalion (performed 1913), notorious for its onstage use of the epithet bloody, Shaw’s work was drawing huge audiences to long runs.\n\nTwo years after the success of what is widely regarded as his best play, St. Joan (performed 1923), Shaw was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, an award that acknowledged his international reputation. He accepted the prize but declined the money. Shaw occupies an awkward place in the Irish literary canon, in part because of his long absence from his country of birth and in part because of his tangential relationship to the nationalist Irish literary renaissance.\n\nOften a seeming disciple, whether of the critics Walter Pater and John Ruskin or of the painter James McNeill Whistler, Wilde nonetheless cut a brilliant and individual figure. He was born in Dublin to parents with nationalist sympathies. His mother was best known in the 1840s for writing strident poetry and articles for The Nation under the pen name Speranza. He attended Trinity College in Dublin but thereafter moved to England. “The Critic as Artist” (1890), a dialogue on aesthetics, emphasizes Wilde’s elevation of the individual. “Criticism is itself an art,” he wrote; the response of the critic to a work of art should be to create another. Wilde wrote fairy tales and short stories, and his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890; rev. ed. 1891), is a Gothic tale of duplicity, narcissism, and destruction. It was the most notorious novel of its time. Wilde is reputed to have once said that “in every first novel the hero is the author as Christ or Faust,” and Dorian Gray’s tale is a Faustian one. While a hidden portrait of him reveals the damage to his soul wreaked by years of corruption, Dorian himself retains his youthful beauty. At the end of the novel, he stabs the portrait and is later found as a hideous human wreck with a knife in his heart, while the portrait has reverted to its original beautiful form. The novel has strong homoerotic and Decadent undertones; one contemporary critic described it as having been written for “none but outlawed noblemen and perverted telegraph boys.”"
