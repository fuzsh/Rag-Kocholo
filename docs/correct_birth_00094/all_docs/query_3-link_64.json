        "text": "George Bernard Shaw was an Anglo-Irish playwright and political activist. Born and schooled in Dublin, he came to England in 1876. He educated himself by reading in the British Museum, and started his writing career as a music and literary critic for several periodicals. After unsuccessful attempts at novel writing, Shaw turned to drama. He wrote over sixty plays in the course of his life, including Man and Superman (1903), Pygmalion (1912; posthumously adapted as a musical ‘My Fair Lady’) and Saint Joan (1923). He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1925.\n\nShaw, inspired by Henry George’s work, became a committed socialist in the 1880s. In 1884, he joined the newly formed Fabian Society, and gave lectures and wrote articles to further its causes. Shaw was also a vegetarian, and supported Henry Salt’s Humanitarian League and its commitment to animal rights. During the First World War, he indefatigably campaigned for international peace and negotiation.\n\nShaw was an outspoken supporter of the Indian independence movement and a great admirer of Mahatma Gandhi, whom he met in 1931 in London. Gandhi was also an admirer of Shaw’s works. Shaw visited India in 1933, but the two could not meet as Gandhi was imprisoned at the time. Shaw also met Rabindranath Tagore in London in May 1913. Two of Shaw’s close female friends later went to India and devoted themselves to Indian causes: Annie Besant and the actress Florence Farr. Shaw met Besant in 1885; she asked him to introduce her to the Fabian Society, and serialized Shaw’s novels The Irrational Knot and Love among Artists in her magazine Our Corner. The actress Florence Farr was at one time Shaw’s mistress, and Shaw frequently met W. B. Yeats at Farr’s home in London. In 1937, Shaw’s The Intelligent Woman’s Guide to Socialism, Capitalism, Sovietism and Fascism was reissued by Krishna Menon’s Pelican Books, inaugurating Penguin’s paperback list.\n\nA Manifesto, Fabian Tracts 2 (London: Standring, 1884)\n\nCashel Byron’s Profession (London: Modern Press, 1886)\n\nAn Unsocial Socialist (London: Sonnenschein, Lowrey, 1887)\n\nThe Quintessence of Ibsenism (London: Scott, 1891)\n\nWidowers’ Houses (London: Henry, 1893)\n\nPlays: Pleasant and Unpleasant, 2 vols (London: Grant Richards, 1898)\n\nThe Perfect Wagnerite: A Commentary on the Ring of the Niblungs (London: Grant Richards, 1898)\n\nLove among the Artists (unauthorized edition, Chicago: Stone, 1900; authorized, revised edition, London: Constable, 1914)\n\nThree Plays for Puritans (London: Grant Richards, 1901)\n\nMan and Superman: A Comedy and a Philosophy (Westminster: Constable, 1903)\n\nThe Common Sense of Municipal Trading (Westminster: Constable, 1904)\n\nFabianism and the Fiscal Question: An Alternative Policy (London: Fabian Society, 1904)\n\nThe Irrational Knot (London: Constable, 1905)\n\nDramatic Opinions and Essays, 2 vols (London: Constable, 1907)\n\nJohn Bull’s Other Island and Major Barbara, also includes How He Lied to Her Husband (London: Constable, 1907)\n\nThe Sanity of Art: An Exposure of the Current Nonsense about Artists Being Degenerate (London: New Age Press, 1908)\n\nPress Cuttings (London: Constable, 1909)\n\nThe Doctor’s Dilemma, Getting Married, and The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet (London: Constable, 1911)\n\nMisalliance, The Dark Lady of Sonnets, and Fanny’s First Play, with a Treatise on Parents and Children (London: Constable, 1914)\n\nCommon Sense about the War (London: Statesman, 1914)\n\nAndrocles and the Lion, Overruled, Pygmalion (London: Constable, 1916)\n\nHow to Settle the Irish Question (Dublin: Talbot Press, 1917; London: Constable, 1917)\n\nPeace Conference Hints (London: Constable, 1919)\n\nHeartbreak House, Great Catherine, and Playlets of the War (London: Constable, 1919)\n\nBack to Methuselah: A Metabiological Pentateuch (London: Constable, 1921)\n\nSaint Joan (London: Constable, 1924)\n\n(with Archibald Henderson) Table-Talk of G.

George Bernard Shaw arrived in India for the first time today, confessing his admiration for Mahatma Gandhi as ‘a clear-headed man who occurs only once in several centuries’.\n\nBronzed by the Eastern sun, Mr. Shaw stood on the deck of the Empress of Britain, which is taking him on a world cruise, and gave Indian newspaper men rapid-fire opinions of the Mahatma and Indian affairs generally.\n\n‘It is very hard for people to understand Gandhi, with the result that he gets tired of people and threatens a fast to kill himself’, Mr. Shaw said. ‘If I saw Gandhi I should say to him, “Give it up, it is not your job.”\n\n‘The people who are the most admired are the people who kill the most. If Gandhi killed 6,000,000 people he would instantly become an important person. All this talk of disarmament is nonsense, for if people disarm they will fight with their fists.’\n\nReferring to Mr. Gandhi’s present crusade against Untouchability, Mr. Shaw said that if an English labourer proposed to marry a duchess he would very soon find out that he was an Untouchable.\n\n‘That gives me enough to think about without bothering to know anything about the Indian Untouchables’, said the author, with a grin.\n\nIndian affairs, he continued, would henceforth have to be dealt with by Indians themselves.\n\n‘In any future disputes between the Indians and British Governments India must not expect any support from other countries’, he declared. ‘From the viewpoint of population, India is the centre of the British Empire. It is quite possible that in the future, instead of India wanting to be separated from England, the time will come when England would make a desperate struggle to get separated from India.'"
