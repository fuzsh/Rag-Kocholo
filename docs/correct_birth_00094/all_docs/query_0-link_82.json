        "text": "Dublin is one of only five UNESCO Cities of literature in the world.\n\nDublin truly is a city of words; its people are famous across the world for their ease with the arts of writing, storytelling and song. ely restaurants are a City of Words Ambassador business and our staff can advise you as to what to experience in Dublin during your stay.\n\nEnjoy at ely winebar, 22 Ely Place our Pan seared organic lamb’s kidneys, wilted spinach and Morbier Blue on toasted brioche for just €10.95\n\nDublin is the birthplace of James Joyce and Nobel Literature Prize winners William Butler Yeats, George Bernard Shaw and Samuel Beckett. UNESCO recognises Dublin as a City of Literature, reflecting the city’s rich tradition of writers and writing, a city with words at its heart – in its river, Joyce’s Anna Livia – in its conversations, its streets and its storytelling. Dublin pays tribute to its literary heritage in the many fine statues of writers which grace the city, notably Wilde, Joyce, Shaw and many others. Streets and bridges, the newest of which is named after Samuel Beckett, also commemorate Dublin’s literary greats. Whether you want to visit the city’s literary landmarks, its literary pubs and bookshops, take a guided tour or see new work performed, Dublin won’t disappoint.\n\nTwelve businesses are official partners of Dublin UNESCO City of Literature. Each business has a nominated ambassador onsite who can advise visitors on what to see and do in the literary city of Dublin. Don’t forget to ask about their literary deals!\n\nRestaurants: Winding Stair ely wine bar ely gastro pub ely bar & brasserie, IFSC Bewley’s Grafton Street The Church Bar and Restaurant"
