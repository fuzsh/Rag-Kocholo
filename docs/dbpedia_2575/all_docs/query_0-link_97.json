Shortly after which the Americans fathom the existence of a Soviet ground-based laser located in Kamchatka Peninsula. However, the officials in Moscow deny the claims that the ground based laser weapons are violating the terms of ABM treaty, despite their frequent striking of the indispensable US assets. This shatters the patience by Washington before the UN.\n\nThe commander of High Technology Aerospace Weapons Center Gen. Bradley Elliot test the modified B-52 bomber also named as the “Old Dog.” This technology is later adopted into the B-1 bombers which are then sent to attack the Soviet ground-based laser weapon shortly after it destroys the American space defense satellite.\n\nHowever, the B-1 mission is intercepted by the Soviet military. Elliot and his crew are attacked by terrorist forcing them to launch immediately. They are determined to push ahead with the B-1 mission with the hope of destroying the laser.\n\nAfter ups and downs, the Old Dog manages to enter the Soviet airspace and manages to destroy the laser weapon.\n\nSeveral members of the crew are injured, and they realize that there is no sufficient fuel to safely fly them home, the land in Anadyr airstrip in Russia. They can refuel but not without confrontation from the Soviet forces. One of the Gen. Bradley Elliot crew members sacrifices his life to allow Old Dog take off. The Old Dog is able to fly safely home despite the considerable damage to both the crew and the aircraft.\n\nFatal Terrain: Hell has broken loose in Asia, and it is ready to flex its muscles to the greater regions of Taiwan.

Patrick McLanahan, an aerial strike expert and his partner Jon Masters, an aerospace engineer work hand in hand to transforming the war-scarred B-52 into an EB-52 (Flying Battleship).
