        "text": "In Loving Memory of Dale R. Gunnell\n\nDale Ray Gunnell beloved husband, father, grandfather, and friend, passed away peacefully at home on November 9th, 2023. In his last few days, he was surrounded by his family and friends, sharing memories, and love. Born on May 21, 1936, in Logan, Utah, he was the second of three children to Leo Brown Gunnell and Naomi Rozella Huggins.\n\nDale's life was a testament to hard work, gentleness, and a sense of humor. A devoted family man, Dale was a loving husband to his wife of 54 years, Sharon Crawford Gunnell, and wholeheartedly embraced his role as a dedicated father.\n\nFrom a young age, Dale faced adversity, losing his mother at age eleven, and enduring frequent moves as his father sought employment. Recognizing the value of education, he graduated from West High School in Salt Lake City in 1954, subsequently earning degrees from the University of Utah, including a Master of Business Administration.\n\nHis professional journey led him to a distinguished career in hospital administration at the University of Utah Medical Center as Chief Operations Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and later as Chief Executive Officer, where his financial acumen played a pivotal role in shaping the institution. His skill in finance was sought after by various organizations throughout his life. Esteemed for his diligence and integrity, Dale earned the respect and admiration of colleagues, leaving behind a professional legacy that will endure.\n\nAn active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Dale found fulfillment in various callings, with a special love for his 18 years of service as a Bountiful Temple worker. His unwavering faith in life after death was nurtured by the experiences he cherished there.\n\nDale had a love for cars, enjoying every aspect from working on them to driving and shopping for them. In his leisure time, he found joy in fishing, hunting, and meticulously tending to his lawn.\n\nPreceded in death by his daughter Stacey Gunnell, Dale is survived by his devoted wife Sharon, his children; Angella Doman, Gregory Gunnell (Colette), Darrin Gunnell (Anne), and 12 grandchildren; Brady Gunnell (Eiko), Spencer Doman (Alyssa), Andrea Simonsen (Justin), Karissa Porter (Jacob), Mitchell Doman (Mattie), Kaylisha Allen (Nicholas), Kierra Lewis (Jacob), Karlia MacKay (Spencer), Hannah Gunnell, Kristina Gunnell, Isaac Gunnell, and Ava Gunnell. His legacy continues through his family, including 12 great-grandchildren.\n\nA viewing will be held from 6:00-8:00 p.m. on Monday, November 13, 2023, Russon Mortuary, 295 North Main Street, Bountiful, Utah, 84010. A memorial service to celebrate Dale's life will take place at 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday, November 14, 2023, with a viewing from 9:45-10:45 a.m., at the Farmington 9th Ward, 695 South 200 East, Farmington, Utah, 84025.\n\nDale's example of integrity, love, kindness, and generosity will endure in the hearts of all who were privileged to know him.\n\nInterment at Bountiful City Cemetery, 2224 South 200 West Bountiful, Utah, 84010.\n\nServices will be streamed live on the Russon Brothers Mortuary Facebook page and on this obituary page. The live stream will begin 10-15 minutes before services and will be posted below."
