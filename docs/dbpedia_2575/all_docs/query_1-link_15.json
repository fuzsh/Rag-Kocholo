        "text": "March 4, 2018\n\nBlimey, I just realized I never reviewed this book.\n\nThis is one of my favorite techno-thrillers. It's less politics-focused than Clancy's books, and there's less spot-hopping convolution, but it's still geographically and politically colorful enough, with the right dose of technical descriptions and hardcore military action. It's a bit cheesy sometimes, but then, it comes off the back of the cheesiest decade in the universe, for the 80s gaveth us the likes of John McClane, John Rambo, John Matrix, Nico, Casey Ryback, and of course, lest we forget, the American Ninja.\n\nThe plot is simple - an American pilot long thought dead has been brainwashed by the Soviets into revealing the secrets of stealth technology, and the world is at the brink of a great war. Of course, there must be a pretext, so \"spontaneous\" demonstrations in the Baltics would serve as the casus belli for the Soviet forces. It's up to a few maverick types to go deep into the enemy territory, save their buddy, and stop the world from getting cooked with gamma rays. Classic, and potentially corny, but the book is executed with fun, flair and imagination.\n\nI read this more than 20 years ago, so I'm a bit vague on some of the details, but I clearly remember that I've enjoyed it a lot, and that I should continue reading this series - and other series.\n\nIgor\n\nMarch 12, 2014\n\nToo much detail on the weaponry specifics took away from the adventure almost stopped reading half way through\n\nDecember 10, 2019\n\nGod knows how long it's been since I read Fight of the Old Dog, the 1st of this series but it's been at least one and probably two decades or more. I don't remember a lot of the details of that book but I do remember I enjoyed it.\n\nThis one not so much.\n\nDale Brown brings us a tale filled with technology from the early 90s and then one must consider it old enough to be declassified for him to include it in his book. Yet that technology is the saving grace of this book.\n\nBrown did poorly with relationships in this story, going from the melodramatic to the absurd at times. People and thoughts were often stereotyped; the vicious ex KGB operatives, the mindlessness of field grade officers, the laughable antics of General Elliot to name a few.\n\nDon't get me wrong; I love melodrama in its place. Dudley Do-Right and Nell were perfect in the old and wonderful Jay Ward cartoons, but on the stage of human conflict in the face of a nuclear conflagration, not so much. (Oh god but I love all of those Jay Ward cartoons - I'd marry Natasha Fatale in a New York minute!) But I digress, as is my nature.\n\nI have too many good authors to read to peruse any more of Brown's work but I do wish him well.\n\nFebruary 2, 2021\n\nThis follow up to the Flight of the Old Dog is a reasonably enjoyable read although I am not sure that all of the disparate plot ideas actually gel particularly well. The two main threads are the increasing civil unrest in Lithuania and the discover that Dave Luger had not died on the snow during the end of the Old Dog mission but was in fact alive and apparently brain washed in the Russian high tech base in Fiskious (their equivalent of Dreamland).\n\nAs the need to evacuate US citizens from Lithuania becomes a reality the powers that be are persuaded to piggy back a rescue mission for Luger onto the marine reinforcement of the US Embassy and early stage evacuation. So far so good. What then unfolds stretches credibility a bit too far for me. As the team arrive at Fiskious the Lithuanians are starting their own assault on the base and much confusion naturally ensues. Meanwhile the head of Fiskious has provide a rouge Belarusian General with nuclear weapons and control circuits to use as a bargaining tool to back up an invasion of Lithuania. Not to be out done General Elliot has planned a separate rescue mission (should the first fail) without the knowledge of the US command structure using all the available ‘toys’ from Dreamland.\n\nAlthough the action is good (as it always is from Brown) I think there are too many elements going on and it is a little difficult to keep them all straight and the overall story would have been better if it had focused on fewer plot lines.\n\nMarch 2, 2013\n\nThis is the second book in the Patrick McLanahan series (Hammerheads takes place before this novel but is officially not part of the series).\n\nThe book takes place primarily in Lithuania & Belarus where after the collapse of the United Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) / Союз Советских Социалистических Республик (CCCP). A now ex-KGB officer holds a US prisoner from the first book, David Luger, who is forced to collaborate on aircraft design at a facility in Lithuania. With the collapse of the USSR and Lithuania now an independent democracy with facilities due to be handed back to the country the ex-KGB officer hatches a scheme with a Byelorussian General to invade Lithuania. In the midst of this Patrick McLanahan & a squad of US Marines go in to rescue David Luger. Action ensues.\n\nIt's a good fast paced novel with lots of action. Like other Dale Brown books there's a lot of technical and military information but not to the point where it detracts from the story, and not in a manner that is fanciful or absurd.\n\nHighly entertaining.\n\nJuly 24, 2013\n\nWhen I first read this book, just after it was published, I thought it was a ripping good yarn. Then, I went through a phase of despising 'unreality' in books and I unloaded all my Dale Brown novels and others that did not meet my standards for reality. I've since chilled a bit and recovered many of the books that were purged back then. Technically, this book is fairly accurate and if Dale Brown had stuck to a straight middle-of-the-road techno-thriller, it would probably have gained another star. What, in my opinion, really let's it down are the protracted scenes of angsting within the White House and the hissy fits through across many levels of rank by many of the military characters. It reads like it was written by someone who was a junior officer (he was) who wants to stick it to the senior ranks for some perceived failing or oversight...\n\nRead this book for the great flying and OK ground combat but just skim the political stuff...you won't miss much.\n\nSeptember 8, 2010\n\nI have a difficult time starting Dale Brown books because the print is always small and the first part is usually pretty slow. However, as with other Brown books I've read, once the action starts I can't put it down. This story was fantastic.\n\nSeptember 23, 2016\n\nToo long, too much technical detail that added nothing to the plot. Almost no character development.\n\nOctober 1, 2018\n\nTom Clancy on steriods. Once you get past the techno mumbo jumbo, an Night of the Hawk is an exciting read. I think I have learned how to construct of CV-22 PAVE HAMMER or any of the V-22 Osprey family of aircraft from the ground up. There are so many details of aircraft and armaments, I am not sure what is reality and what is fiction.\n\nThe obvious heroes of the novel are Lithuanian General Dominikas Palcikas, the V-22 Osprey and the EB-52 Megafortress. There are enough Lithuanian names thrown around to fill the Vilnius phonebook. And in an age where the F-35 is all the rage due to its stealth and avionics, it is nice to hear stories about a small rotary aircraft and a suped-up B-52. The B-52 has been around since the 1950s and the V-22 since the late 1980s, yet they are both still winning hearts.\n\nSeptember 10, 2019\n\nWow, what a mixed bag this book turned out to be!\n\nThe negatives would have to start with the really small print of this edition, the incredibly boring details of every airplane and weapon in the story, and the difficult (for me) pronounciations of the Lithuanian and soviet names and places.\n\nThe positives include a newsworthy political location, familiar great characters, and a rip-roaring second half! The details are not really important to this review, but if you liked Tom Clancy, or other Dale Brown books you've probably already read this one anyway! If not, the first half was tedious and the second half rocked! Try it, you might like it.\n\nMarch 12, 2020\n\nThe Soviet Union is no more, the Commonwealth of Independent States is the new Eastern European power block. Lithuania is going for independence but there are still old Soviet forces in the country, controlled by Belorussian nationalists. So far, so good.\n\nReaders may remember Dave Luger, the navigator who sacrificed his life in the first book. Well, he's now a brainwashed Russian scientist building a stealth airplane in Lithuania.\n\nI think this book might as well be skipped. Since this is an interlude to the overall story, no character development happens and I can't imagine that the other books in the series is worse.\n\nMay 22, 2021\n\nA lot of suspense and thrills in this sequel to FLIGHT OF THE OLD DOG. General Brad Elliott learns that Dave Luger is alive in a secret facility in Lithuania. Along with a U.S. Marines special operations assault team, the original crew of the Old Dog (Patrick McLanahan, Hal Briggs, and John Ormack) go on an extraction mission to get former Old Dog crew member Luger out of the compound. As a crisis unfolds during the mission, the crew of the Old Dog devise plans of their own.\n\nAnother fine Dale Brown novel with a gripping and breathtaking ending. If you are a Dale Brown fan of the Patrick McLanahan series of books, I highly recommend Night of the Hawk.\n\nDecember 23, 2018\n\nAs usual, this book has a slow confusing start. Lots of different foreign names and organizations to remember, lots of military tactics relying on geography. About half way in things pick up and get more exciting.\n\nSeptember 10, 2021\n\nBilled as more from the crew of “The Old Dog.” They’re in the story, but except for Dave Luger, not so much until the end. The stories about the Lithuanians, Belorussians, Russians, and American politicians are good however. Lots of military jargon, sometimes gets in the way.\n\nAugust 2, 2017\n\nCaught up on my Dale Brown Books, not sure how I skipped this one first time around.\n\nJuly 3, 2020\n\nThis was a great story. There’s probably too much technical detail for someone who is not a special ops geek (which I am). The story dragged in places, but it was a good beach read.\n\nJune 14, 2022\n\nFun and excitement- further character creation and great tech use/description) in the vein of Tom Clancy.\n\nFun series...\n\nJanuary 3, 2023\n\nFirst Dale Brown book, and it was quite good. The intrigue, the plans, the characters all worked well toward a convincing and admirable finish.\n\nOctober 24, 2017\n\n\"October 22, 2017 – page 256\n\n44.44%\n\nOctober 22, 2017 – page 212\n\n36.81% \"Break doesn't exist...

At times had to scratch my head to understand what was being written.\n\nApril 2, 2024\n\nIn Flight of the Old Dog, after the crew of the classified B-52 bomber known as \"Old Dog\" bombed a Soviet laser weapon facility, USAF Lt. David Lugar was presumed dead defending his crewmates from a Russian militia attack at a semi-abandoned Soviet airbase while they were refueling their plane to get home.\n\nSeveral years later, the Soviet Union has collapsed. Russia & it's former Soviet holdings in the Baltic region are in chaos. Meanwhile, a spy for the U.S. brings startling news from Lithuania: David Lugar is alive. He's been brainwashed into thinking he's a Soviet aerospace engineer & has helped build an advanced bomber with similarities to the Old Dog. He's being held in a facility in Lithuania which is under the command of KGB rogues looking to use the facility & it's assets for their own personal gain.\n\n--------------------------\n\nPros:\n\n1. Brings back the whole crew from Flight of the Old Dog.\n\n2. Good suspenseful action.\n\n3. Has little bits of humor in it while keeping things serious.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Get's tech explanation heavy at times.\n\nOverall opinion: A good sequel to Flight of the Old Dog.\n\nSeptember 5, 2011\n\nSet in 1987?\n\nStroryline\n\nMike Luger left behind in Russia after Old Dog mission. Captured by KGB\n\nand brainwashed into helping develop the Fi-107 stealth bomber at a base\n\nin Lithuania. Lithuanian Defense Force fighting corrupt Belarus solders\n\nthat are trying to take over Lithuania. HAWC send Megafortress to help.\n\nCharacters\n\nGeneral Brad Elliott - Commander of Dreamland\n\nOrmack\n\nLieutenant Colonel Patrick McLanahan\n\nHal Briggs - Dreamland Chief of Security\n\n(these three go on mission with marines to rescue Luger)\n\nEB-52 Crew\n\nCaptain Alicia Kellerman - Nav\n\nMajor Kelvin Carter - Pilot\n\nCaptain Nancy Cheshire\n\nWendy Tork - EWO\n\nCaptain Paul Scott - Bombardier\n\nDr. Angelina Pereira - Gunner\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMay 31, 2012\n\nthis is by far one of the best book ive read recently! this is a very good mix of fiction and non fiction that is based on the cold war between U.S and the soviet union. Night of the hawk is a great book that begins at sea, aboard an aircraft carrier, and this happens to be when there is a secret mission that this pilot (luger) has to be apart of, and during this mission his plane gets shot down. Everybody is lead to believe he has died, whiloe the truth is, he has not. So he is working for the soviets under a brainwash technique when the americans find him. What will happen to luger?\n\nMay 31, 2016\n\n#4 in the Patrick McLanahan series in publication order (#2 chronologically).\n\nPatrick McLanahan series - A simple defector extraction raid in Lithuania in late 1992 uncovers evidence that a member of the Old Dog crew, David Luger, survived the events of Flight of the Old Dog and was brainwashed to work on a new stealth bomber at a secret facility in Vilnius. Amidst the political upheaval in the country, General Elliott, McLanahan, and John Ormack join a US Marine contingent in assaulting the facility and rescuing Luger.\n\nAugust 5, 2013\n\nGreat novel. A bit political for the first half but it seems necessary to set up the finale. The ending was a little abrupt and apart from finding out where Dave Luger ended up, we don't get to really explore the effects of his years of brainwashing. More emphasis on that story line would've been good as well and may have added a little extra to the book. Other than that though, I enjoyed it thoroughly and am looking forward to the next book in the \"Patrick McLanahan\" series!\n\nMarch 27, 2015\n\nThe book has the usual politics in between full scale action. Technical details were accurate about military hardware. [Spoiler alert] The war description was very detailed. The geography, tactics and organization of modern wars was accurate. Lithuania and Belorussia conflict was shown with correct perspective during the break up of former USSR. All in all read up if you like aviation, military and action. Just skim through the politics."
