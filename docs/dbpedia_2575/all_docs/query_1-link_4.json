        "text": "Norman Dale Brown Jr. died Saturday in Methodist Hospital in Houston. Born June 2, 1958, he was 61.\n\nCommunity was very important to Dale Brown. Although he wasn’t born in Dayton, he had deep roots here. Family was the basis of who he was. His Brown great grandparents settled in Stilson around 1900 when his grandfather was a toddler. He was also part of a large extended family on his mother’s side. Dale attended third through seventh grades in Dayton but also lived in other places such as Holland and South Korea before moving back to Dayton to stay in the middle of his sophomore year of high school. He graduated in 1976 and then attended Texas A&M.\n\nDale served 12 years on the Dayton ISD school board and served on the city council for a short time. He coached Little League and Little Dribblers and was active with 4-H and FFA. In fact, he was an honorary member of the Dayton FFA. He was also an honorary member of Tri-M Music Honor Society. Dale was also active in the First Baptist Church, where he taught Sunday School and served as an usher.\n\nHe retired after 35 years from Exxon where he was Safety, Health and Environmental Manager at Mont Belvieu Plastics Plant the last five years. He started at Baytown Olefins Plant in 1978.\n\nDale was predeceased by his mother Martha Hale Brown as well as by his brother-in-law and niece Gary and Erin Westmoreland. Also predeceasing him were his mother-in-law Marjolaine Boyer and his nephew Jacob Boyer.\n\nMichele Boyer Brown, his wife of 40 years, survives him. They were married May 12, 1979. Also surviving are his son and daughter and their spouses: Josh and Adrianna Brown and Jessica and Jason Bevel. He was a loving “Pops” to six grandchildren: Joey and Michael Bevel, and Sutton, Amelia, Clara and James Brown.\n\nHis father, Norman Dale Brown Sr., and three sisters also survive him. They and their spouses are Nancy and Troy Baker, Jo and Randy Riley, and Susan and Brett Addington. The group of survivors includes 16 nieces and nephews and 10 first cousins and numerous great nephews and nieces.\n\nFuneral services will be held Wednesday at First Baptist Church at 10:00 a.m. with the Pastor Taylor Choate officiating. Visitation will be from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. Tuesday evening at Pace-Stancil Funeral Home, 1304 N. Cleveland, Dayton. Interment will be at Magnolia Cemetery.
