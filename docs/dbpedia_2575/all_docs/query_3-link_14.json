        "text": "Dale Brown, age of 79 of Cottage Grove, Minnesota, passed away unexpectedly on June 20, 2024.\n\nMemorial service will be 1:00 pm, Thursday, June 27, 2024, at Kok Funeral Home, 7676 80th Street S., Cottage Grove, Minnesota with visitation one hour prior.\n\nDale Raymond Brown was born September 30, 1944, in Springfield, Minnesota the 2nd oldest of 14 siblings. He grew up near Sanborn, Minnesota on the family farm, where he learned a solid work ethic and fueled his desire to work on machinery. Dale worked for a local road construction company for a few years before entering active duty in the US Army. During his period of service he was stationed in Vietnam and Germany and received his training as a diesel and helicopter mechanic. In the mid 1980's, Dale started working at Carver General Repair as a mechanic where he served until his retirement.\n\nDale enjoyed firearms and anything with a motor... the louder, the better! He loved hot rods, four wheelers, side by sides and passed that passion on to his children and grandchildren. Dale loved his family and never missed a goodbye hug.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Susan; children William (Véronique), Jeremy (Tiffany), Joshua (Jodi), and Amanda (Ryan); 13 grandchildren Gabrielle, Madalynn, Isabella, Logan, Katelyn, Lillyan, Aubrey, Rory, Madyson, Kylie, Jack, Gitana and Colton; 12 siblings Dianne, Donald, Larry, Cheryl, Edward, Beverly, Michael, Marlon, Ronald, Timmy, Thomas and Terry. He is preceded in death by his parents Raymond and Ardeen; stepfather Melvin Clark; son Robert; brother Raymond; brother-in-law John Reiter and sister-in-law Linda.\n\nLIVESTREAM INFORMATION: For those who would like to participate in the service via livestream, you can watch the service by scrolling to the bottom of this page, and click “PLAY\" to begin.
