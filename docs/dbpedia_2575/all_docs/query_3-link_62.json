        "text": "Dale Kelly Brown was born on January 8, 1960 in San Diego, California to Garland and Margrette (McKee) Brown. He moved to Lindsay, Oklahoma after the passing of his dad in 1976.\n\nDale’s mother loaded up her three youngest children and pets in a station wagon and made their way here where she had lived in her younger days and she had family. As they settled in and the school year started, the kids weren’t excited at all on the first day of school, as everyone was checking out the new kids and some not so nice. Marie reached out to Dale and his twin brother, Dennis and they all became buddies. Marie was 12 and Dale was 16, and they became friends. One day after a couple years, something changed and he wanted to marry her. After her mother was diagnosed with fatal news, they all took a road trip to Gainesville, Texas on March 3, 1978 and Dale and Marie began their marriage journey. After many attempts, they had their first daughter, Alisha in 1981 and Heather followed in 1984.\n\nDale was a man of many trades. He worked in the oilfield until 2006 when he decided to start his own oilfield business, Brown’s Brush Hogging. With his wife in tow, they worked it together until they were able to hire help which was all family. Scott Hill, Joshua Christie, Dale, and Marie worked side by side for many years. Joshua, his right hand man, has been running the business ever since Dale was diagnosed and will continue the business of Dale’s legacy.\n\nHe always had something going, he loved auctions and yard sales, which drove Marie nuts when he returned with all his treasures. Dale was always the first to lend a hand to anyone who needed it. He had faith in people, good or bad. He loved to fish which there’s a pond he would go to behind the house by a good friend and brother-in-Christ, Darrel Cable. He caught the biggest fish since living in Oklahoma and he was so proud of that fish.\n\nDale obeyed the gospel in 1993. He loved the Lord and would tell you all about it. He will be deeply missed by all who knew him.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 44 years, Marie of the home; daughters, Alisha Kinney and husband Woody of Lindsay; Heather Preast and husband James of Gene Autry; grandchildren, Kelly, Kirsten, Keira Kinney all of Lindsay, Charles and Madison Preast of Gene Autry and the newest great grandson, Bruno “Dale” Acosta. Sisters: Donna and Tommy Hartis and Darla and Kenny Bennett of Rockport, Texas; and a whole bunch of nieces and a nephew.\n\nDale was preceded in death by both of his parents, Garland and Margrette Brown and his twin brother, Dennis Brown.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 10:00 am, Friday, October 21, 2022 at the Murray Hill Church of Christ, Lindsay with arrangements under the direction of John W.\n\nWilliams of Winans Funeral Home, Maysville, OK.
