        "text": "Not to be confused with the other author named D. Brown. Also not to be confused with Dale Brown, former basketball coach at Louisiana State University.\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a member of the United States Air Force. He spent his days as a member of the Strategic Air Command, specifically a navigator-bombardier. He was rather good at it.\n\nThen he retired and started writing books. These books involve super-planes, such as the EB-52 Megafortress, a stealth escort bomber. They also sometimes involve nukes being let off. The main plotline through most of his stories involves USAF bomber navigator Patrick McLanahan and his involvement with the supersecret High Technology Aerospace Weapons Center \"Dreamland\".\n\nHe made the plot for a Real Time Strategy game, Act of War, which features some of the tropes found in his books.\n\nHis books (incomplete, and not yet in chronological order):[]\n\nFlight of the Old Dog - in which a Soviet laser cannon threatens the deterrent value of American strategic forces.\n\nSilver Tower - in which an American space laser mounted on a space station does battle against space Russians In Space.\n\nDay Of The Cheetah - in which a Russian spy attempts to steal an advanced, mind-controlled fighter jet.\n\nHammerheads - in which drug runners are taken out by V-22s launched from an oil-rig air base\n\nSky Masters- in which a Chinese Admiral nukes some Filipino ships. Comes with hilariously inaccurate portrayal of both nations' governments and militaries.\n\nNight Of The Hawk - in which a friend thought dead is still alive but in Soviet hands, and the crew must save him before the CIA get to him.\n\nChains of Command\n\nStorming Heaven- in which drug lord Henri Cazaux causes the unplanned destruction of the San Francisco International Airport, decides that Evil Feels Good, and becomes a super-villain powered by the sexual energy of Satan. No, seriously.\n\nShadows of Steel - in which Iran gets frisky with its new aircraft carrier.\n\nFatal Terrain- in which the Chinese nuke Taiwanese bases, North Korea and Guam.\n\nThe Tin Man- in which McLanahan's brother gets shot by terrorists and he breaks out the eponymous Powered Armor in search of the culprits.\n\nBattle Born- in which a group of maverick National Guard pilots are roped into Dreamland's operations while Korea reunites and China takes action against that.\n\nWarrior Class - in which a Russian oilman plans to restore Russia's glory with a Balkan pipeline.\n\nWings of Fire - in which the Night Stalkers response to Libyan aggression turns dangerously personal for McLanahan.\n\nAir Battle Force - in which a seemingly straightforward strike against a Taliban group becomes much more complicated.\n\nPlan of Attack - in which the Russian President nukes American nuclear forces.\n\nAct of War - in which an eco-terrorist attack on big business with a nuke inspires a tough response.\n\nEdge of Battle - in which US-Mexico relations grow horribly tense thanks to the warmongering of a drug smuggler masquerading as a revolutionary.\n\nStrike Force - in which McLanahan is asked to intervene in an Iranian power struggle.\n\nShadow Command - in which a new Russian president plots the destruction of Dreamland while the Iranian power struggle continues.\n\nRogue Forces - in which McLanahan's new PMC is called into action over Iraq.\n\nExecutive Intent - in which China and Russia challenge American domination of space.\n\nA Time for Patriots - in which the US economy goes down the sewer and McLanahan forms a group to keep the peace against terrorists and Right Wing Militia Fanatics.\n\nAs a Long Running Book Series - Flight of the Old Dog was released in 1987 - beware Late Arrival Spoilers.\n\nHis books contain examples of:[]"
