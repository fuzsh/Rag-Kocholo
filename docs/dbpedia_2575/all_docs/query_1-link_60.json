Many thanks to the medical professionals who collaborated tirelessly to seek a diagnosis for his unexplained illness.\n\nKerry was born in Davie County on Feb. 26, 1963 to the late Dale Houston Brown and Glenda Bailey Brown. He was a lifelong member of Hardison Methodist Church in Mocksville and frequently attended Hillsdale Church in Advance. Kerry was Vice President of Supply Chain Management at Roush-Yates Inc. in Mooresville, NC. Kerry made a huge impact on many kids during his time as President of Davie County Little League. He loved coaching his daughter, Kelsey, and spent many hours behind the plate umpiring games. Mentoring and teaching life skills through coaching sports, including football, was very important to Kerry. He especially loved traveling with his family to Kelsey’s softball and volleyball tournaments … “Making Memories”. Kerry also loved hunting and fishing in his spare time. For several years, Kerry passionately volunteered serving homeless families through Hillsdale’s Manna Meals Traveling Soup Kitchen.\n\nIn addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by his older sister, Frances “Fran” Brown.\n\nSurvivors include: his wife of 26 years, Lorrie Norman Brown; daughter, Kelsey Brown; younger sister, Wendy Drane (Paul) of Harmony; niece, Bailey Drane; and several close friends that he also considered “family”.\n\nThe family will receive friends from 6-8 p.m., Friday, Oct. 28 at Eaton Funeral Home. A funeral service will be conducted at 2 p.m., Saturday, Oct. 29 at Eaton Funeral Chapel. Interment will follow in Hardison Methodist Church Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials honoring Kerry may be considered for: Mocksville Lions Club, c/o Mr. Charles Crenshaw, 421 Park Ave., Mocksville, NC 27028; or to Davie American Little League, PO Box 95, Advance, NC 27006."
