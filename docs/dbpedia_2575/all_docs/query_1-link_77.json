        "text": "It is with great sadness that the family of Gordon Dale Brown (to a long list of RCAF personnel he was known as “Head and Shoulders” or just Brownie”) announce that Dale left this world at approximately 0300 hrs 18 Jan 2024 with a recent diagnosis of Advanced Stage of Hi Grade Lymphoma. His last hours were at the Kelowna Hospice House.\n\nHe leaves behind his teen-age friend and partner of many years Helen Wonnenberg. He was pre-deceased by his older brother Douglas, sister-in-law Marge of Elliot Lake, Ont, youngest brother Stephen of Owen Sound/Kincardine Ont, his parents Gordon Myron Brown (served as a Private Gunner in WW2-C Company 4th Battalion RCA and Lorraine Edmiston.\n\nWhen his dad was at War the family stayed with Grandma in Kincardine, Ont. Dale was born 23 Sep 1939 in Kincardine (located on Lake Huron). He is survived by his oldest sister Sandra(John) Sutherland of Kincardine, Susan (Terry) Patterson of Windsor, Ont and Dana (Brian) Thompson of Elliott Lake, Ont. Many nieces, nephews and cousins survive mostly in Ont.\n\nDeparted for Number 2 Manning Depot RCAF St. John’s, Quebec (not St. Jean) on 11 Nov 1957 to commence Basic Training. After Basic proceeded to RCAF Stn Clinton for his Refrigeration Course. Eventually remustered to Air Frame Tech (512) at Borden. After Graduation was transferred to 409 (AWF) Sqn Comox, B.C. After 6 years transferred to 416 (AWF) Sqn Chatham, N.B. then unto 4 Wing Baden-Baden Soellingen, Germany. Served only one year as the government of the day decided that there was no more requirement for 4 Wing and the Air and Ground Crew were transferred back to Canada. Requested a transfer to AMDU/6 RD Trenton and received it. He received his Non-Destructive Testing Technician Qualifications from this tour. Posted to 414(EW) Sqn North Bay, Ont. Final posting was to 419 (TAC) Cold Lake, Ab. On retirement worked at the OK College on KLO Rd. Worked in the Tool Crib dispensing tools to the trade students. He was qualified as a First Aid Attendant with his B.C Ticket. Being Bi-Lingual in French, he was used as an interpreter on many occasions. Obtained his French Qualification from French School at CFB North Bay and St. John’s, Que. Received his Life Membership from the Royal Canadian Legion in 01/06/2011. He was very involved in getting 288 RCL(Westbank) on the map. There was an extreme amount of work in the beginning to get things organized and approved. Like where was the Legion going to be located!!! The most involved work was getting a BC Liquor/Beer license. Again, you will hear the name Kincardine...the liquor inspector happened to be from there. I wonder. Dale did a lot of volunteering in his downtime. He faithfully volunteered for a 5-year study for the CARDIOVASCULAR INFLAMMATION REDUCTION TRIAL which was for Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Program convenor was Dr. Polasek. Dale was participant 0012.\n\nAs per Dale’s wishes there will be no formal funeral and service. Dale will finish his journey to Kincardine with his last poo-chi’s Gainer the Gopher and Rocky the Raccoon (we thank Dr. Oz for his care over 16 years). Many thanks to our Guardian Angel Sandra from the McDougall Creek Fire. A special thank you to Judy, Zac, Hailey, Sandy, Bill, Michael, and the many Fire Fighters and Para Medics, Nurses and Doctors from the Interior Health, Dr. Jackson and Andre Hugo his family doctor. Again, thank everyone for their comforting words.\n\nInstead of flowers PLEASE consider the Kelowna SPCA at 3785 Casorso Road Kelowna V1W 4M7 Canada; or Kelowna Cancer Foundation or charity of your choice. Condolences may be expressed by visiting https://www.everdenrust.com/obituaries/Gordon-Dale-Brown?obId=30505014.\n\nThe Legion Flag is flying at half-mast in remembrance this week. In the last few year years, we have a converted fan to the Saskatchewan Roughriders."
