        "text": "Obituary For Mr. Dale Brown\n\nMr. Dale Brown passed on Thursday, December 1, 2022. Visitation will be held on Friday, December 9, 2022 from 5:00 P.M. until 7:00 P.M. at Trice Funeral Home Chapel. Funeral services will be held on Saturday, December 10, 2022 at 11:00 A.M. at East Mount Sinai Baptist Church. Trice Funeral Home of Barnesville is in charge of all professional services. Please keep the Brown family in prayer. A TIME TO BE BORN: Dale Eugene Brown was born on June 4, 1961, in Agusta, Georgia. He spent the majority of his life in Barnesville, Georgia. In 2020, he relocated to Atlanta, Georgia where he quickly adapted to his new lifestyle and made a host of special friends. Daryl and Kim Scott, Patricia Johnson, and Samantha Bell, thank you for being a friend.\n\nA TIME TO SEREVE: Dale accepted Christ at an early age and was a member of the East Mount Sinai Baptist Church. As kids, we had no say in our spirituality. Anytime the church doors opened, Dorothy Ann’s six kids were front and center. Be it Sunday school, church service on the second and fourth Sundays, vacation Bible school , choir rehearsal, Wednesday night prayer service, pastor appreciation, or church anniversary to name a few, we played our parts. The love of Christ was instilled in us early, and Dale carried that spirit with him until the very end.\n\nA TIME TO WORK By trade, Dale was a skilled roofer and landscaper At one time, he worked for Balamo Building Supply .Actually, he was quite the handyman. He had a way of making your car look brand spanking new with his hand detailing. There wasn’t much he could not do. A TIME TO CELEBRATE: Dale wasn’t a man of many words. He was extremely meek and mild. Old school music, Icehouse, and Newports, were a few of his favorite things. Thank God for technology and the countless videos we have of him singing, dancing, and living his best life.\n\nA TIME TO NURTURE Dale was the father of two children, Dale Brown, Jr., and Delandria (Lady) Brown, who are the spitting image of him. He had eight grandchildren, Aiden Brown, Eden Brown, Kehlani Brown, Ezekiel Brown, Ny’Asia Brown. Ty’Asia Brown, Jeremiah Brown, and A’layisa Smith.\n\nA TIME TO DIE In late October after taking a shower, Dale suffered a traumatic head injury and lost consciousness, He spent one month in ICU at Grady and was later transferred to Select Rehabilitation Services in Atlanta, Georgia, where he succumbed to his injury on Thursday, December 1, at 6:59 a.m. A TIME TO MOURN And then there were three. Dale was the eldest of six siblings, He was loved by many and will be truly missed by all. He leaves to mourn and cherish his wonderful memories; his three siblings, Denise Brown, Willie (Man) Brown, and LaWanda Johnson (Ronald); his stepfather, Eugene Harden; bonus brothers, Larry Harden, Derrick Harden, Fredrick Harden, and Anthony Alford; a devoted cousin who was like a brother and there every step of the way, Donnie Zellner, cousins Louise Poole and Bertha McFadden; as well as a host of nieces, nephews, other cousins, and friends. He was preceded in death by his mother, Dorothy Ann Brown Harden; sister Rosalyn Bonett Brown; and brother, Robert Donnell(Robbie) Brown. A precious one from us is gone; a voice we love is stilled; a place is vacant in our hearts, which never can be filled. And, after a lonely heartache, and many a silent tears, forever a beautiful memory of one we loved so dear.\n\nSend flowers to the service of Mr. Dale Brown"
