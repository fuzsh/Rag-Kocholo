        "text": "Dale Brown Jr., 45, of Newport, North Carolina, passed away on Thursday, February 1, 2024, at Carolina East Medical Center.\n\nDale was born on April 13, 1978, in Elizabeth City, North Carolina to Steven Brown Sr. and the late Ann Brown. He was well known in the Newport area, where he grew up and lived most of his life.\n\nDale's determination and strong work ethic led him to become a skilled and accomplished self-employed electrician. He was extremely talented and was also able to work on anything mechanical. Whatever obstacle came his way, Dale could repair it with ease.\n\nAs an avid motorcycle enthusiast, he found great joy and exhilaration riding his beloved Harley. Nothing was more enjoyable for him than cruising along the open road. In his personal life, Dale cherished spending time with his loved ones who will forever hold him dear in their hearts.\n\nThose remaining to cherish his memory are his companion, Michelle Scalingi of the home; children, Leeanna Castillo-Jaurequi (Alberto) of Morehead City, Aden Brown (fianc√© Amber Buchanan) of Bridgeton, and Logan Kelly (Devin) of Havelock; step-children, Ashley Stuart, Ashlynn Arfken, and Tori Arfken, all of Havelock; father, Steven Brown Sr. (Lori) of Angier; sisters, Trina Tevepaugh of Newport and Michelle Muskelly (Jay) of Four Oaks; and grandchildren, Jasiah and Nyela.\n\nFamily and friends are welcome to submit online condolences at www.mundenfuneralhome.net.\n\nArrangements by Munden Funeral Home & Crematory in Morehead City, NC."
