        "text": "It's that time again. The summer season beckons and the Ibiza floodgates are soon to welcome in the finest DJs and parties in the world, and the dancers preparing for life-changing moments on the floor.\n\nTo help find your way among the chaos, we've compiled the ultimate guide to the best clubs and parties you can find on the White Isle in 2019. Check it out below.\n\nAddress Playa d’En Bossa s/n, 07817 Sant Josep de sa Talaia, Ibiza | Tickets from €35 | Opening times 23:00/00:00–06:00 | Capacity 5,500 | Soundsystem L-Acoustic Getting there From San Antonio, the L3B Discobus will take you directly to Playa d’En Bossa. From Ibiza Town, catch the L14 Discobus\n\nAfter their crossover sound exploded in popularity last summer, tech-house overlords CamelPhat & Solardo team up with Aussie man-of-the-moment Fisher to front a new residency, BODYWORKS. Electronica’s own modern Mozart, Recondite, is one of the highlights at Tale Of Us’ Afterlife, Latin-leaning night RICHBITCH arrives, Guetta heads up F*** Me I’m Famous! on Fridays, Armin & co. bring the euphoria on Wednesdays, Glitterbox is the Island’s finest house night on Sundays and of course, Black Coffee conjures his unique Saturday sorcery at this state-of-the-art superclub.\n\n[Photo: Roberto Castano]\n\n“When we heard Hï Ibiza wanted us to host the Theatre Room this year alongside CamelPhat, we couldn’t quite believe it. With Fisher hosting the Club Room, I don’t think you could have picked three better acts to headline. Because it’s a completely new night, the party is going to look a little different this year. We’re going to bring the stage forward, with people behind us, to the side of us and in front of us when we’re performing. We’re also going to be hosting our pre-parties at Café Mambo. There will be a weekly rotation between us, CamelPhat and Fisher every Tuesday. With this being only our third year in Ibiza, the fact that we’re hosting our own event at one of the premier clubs in the world is a massive achievement for us. I doubt we’ll realise what we’ve done and where we’ve been until the curtains close and the lights come on; I think we’re still caught up in the middle of the whirlwind. But as much as we’re bursting at the seams to get started, we’re also aware of the fact that this is our event, so we’re going to have to be a little bit more civilised when it comes to engaging the party side of Ibiza. That’s the plan, anyway!”\n\n1. Solardo x Eli Brown ‘XTC’ (Ultra)\n\n“Our next single and a secret weapon in our sets over the past couple of months. It goes off wherever we’ve played it!”\n\n2. Secondcity & A Double ‘Let The Music’ (Sola)\n\n“Proper summer vibes which will work so well in Ibiza.”\n\n3. Mason Maynard ‘Why’ (bootleg)\n\n“Mason’s been killing it over the past 12 months. We’ve closed our sets with this a couple of times.”\n\n4. Max Chapman ‘Formanto’ (Sola)\n\n“I swear this breakdown sends shivers down your spine! It’s gonna go off when we play it in the Theatre Room at Hï.”\n\n5. Dimmish ‘Brain Tornado’ (E1even Records)\n\n“Dimmish’s productions are so solid and we’ve been absolutely rinsing this new one for a while now.”\n\n“My first trip to Ibiza was also my very first gig on the island. I played the iconic Space Terrace 15 years ago in 2004, and I still get chills every time I think of it. I remember arriving at Space early in the morning and the car park was full of ravers waiting to get back in again after Carl Cox‘s night on Tuesday! My advice for Ibiza first-timers would be to watch out for promo teams on the beach and check out the early deals for ANTS. Then head over to Ushuaïa in the afternoon as the vibe by the small DJ booth is always super nice. Not to mention the fact that you can tan at the same time as dancing! Who cares if you arrive early as long as you’re in? More time to party and make new friends, and that’s what ANTS is all about. Flights to Ibiza can be crazy. I once witnessed a full-on fist fight at 30,000 feet! But I’ve also had some funny flights. Like the time when, all of a sudden, a few rows back, they started screaming my name, improvising a song just for me. I put those guys on the guest list, of course...”\n\n“I play tracks at DC10 that I wouldn’t normally play anywhere else. During the whole year I’m selecting and saving tracks in a folder especially for DC10! To me, the sets I play there are similar to what I usually do, but the difference is in the details. Depending on who is playing before me I sometimes play a bit slower, less dark. And I also like to show my groovy side. DC10 is not the kind of place where you can just jump in and out for your set. If it’s not too busy I like to dance and enjoy the sets from the artists playing before and after me. My absolute favourite place is in the middle of the dancefloor in the Main Room. It’s nice to stay there for a few hours; I always bump into people I haven’t seen for a while. This is a bit crazy, but my first time on the island was actually to play Circoloco at DC10 in 2017. I played the opening slot in the Main Room. I’m not used to playing the opening slot and had no experience in Ibiza so I felt very nervous. I expected the club to be calm at that time, but the dancefloor was packed within ten minutes! I spent eight months making an opening set playlist for this party, but people literally came in screaming my name – everyone was so excited – so in the end I never got to play any of those groovy warm-up tracks!”\n\n[Photo: Zeb Daemen]\n\n“I’d actually only ever been to Ibiza Rocks Hotel once before I started my residency there. That was in 2017 for the Elrow pool party. The party was fun and I knew it would be a great place to host a weekly show. Along with my agent, my managers and Ibiza Rocks, I’m very involved with everything that goes on – how my Area 10 Pool Party is going to look and which DJs are playing. Everything has to go past me. I wouldn’t say I’ve borrowed too much from the pool parties I go to in the US, which are mostly standard hotel pool parties. In the US, in terms of size and craziness, there’s nothing really on the same level as Ibiza Rocks. The only thing that comes remotely close to what we’re doing at Area 10 is a place called Splash House in Palm Springs. I played there a few years ago and it has the same kind of set-up: a giant pool bordered on all sides by white hotel balconies. But at Ibiza Rocks, the courtyard is decorated to take the craziness to a whole new level. Which is the way I like it, because having my own residency in Ibiza is a massive thing for me.\n\nI remember playing at Sankeys after DJ Sneak back in 2012. I had no expectations of even playing on the island again; I was just happy to play there that one time. What has happened to me since then has been incredible: a journey you can’t really plan.”\n\n1. MK ‘Body 2 Body’ (Columbia UK)\n\n“My new single is kind of sultry and it makes me think of summertime in Ibiza.”\n\n2. Leftwing & Kody ‘I Feel It’ (Toolroom)\n\n“I love this record. It’s going to be a huge track for me this year, for sure.”\n\n3. Nightlapse ‘Changed Minds’ (Area10)\n\n“This new producer/DJ team from Liverpool are amazing. This uplifting song is about changing minds.”\n\n4. Jaksan ‘LaLaLa’ (Dirtybird)\n\n“Dirtybird always kill it, and this bassline really wakes up the crowds when it drops.”\n\n5. Lee Foss, Eli Brown & Anabel England ‘Brazil’ (Repopulate Mars)\n\n“My dream team! So much talent and very cool lyrics.”\n\n“When you arrive at Pikes, the first thing you’ll wonder is, ‘What on earth have I just walked into! Is this somebody’s house?’ You’ve got beautiful gardens, tennis courts, winding paths leading off to hidden terrace areas and courtyards, stone steps taking you up to the pool area. When it comes to dancing, there are two rooms. I’m probably going to do something trippier in the Chez Fez, a little more ambient, so people can go in there and get lost. Freddie’s Room is slightly larger, but it’s still it’s hot and sweaty with low ceilings. Those walls hold so many amazing stories that the building itself seems to have manifested a soul, a certain spirit all its own. So many amazing characters have partied there: George Michael, Grace Jones, Freddie Mercury himself. We’re talking about one of the most historic, ironic dance venues on the planet. With Wax Da Jam celebrating its 10th Birthday, Pikes seemed like the perfect fit. This summer, I want to dig into a few Wax Da Jam classics: some reggae, some disco, some hip hop. At times I might have a percussionist with me; at other times a drummer. These tribal moments happen sporadically throughout the night, and are how Wax Da Jam was born. The party has evolved, and now the way we operate has definitely got a street soundsystem kind of edge to it. But we’re not genre-specific. Like Pikes, Wax Da Jam is old-skool, new-skool and totally left of centre!”\n\n1. Nightmares On Wax ‘Now Is The Time’ (Warp Records)\n\n“A staple of so many live and DJ sets for me. I play this a lot.”\n\n2. Nightmares On Wax ‘Look Up’ (Warp Records)\n\n“One of my most recent releases, this goes off when played at the right time.”\n\n3. Gang Starr ‘Who’s Gonna Take the Weight’ (dub) (Virgin Records)\n\n“A stone-cold classic, I love playing the dub version for the hip hop heads.”\n\n4. Rolls Royce ‘Do Your Dance’ (Whitfield Records)\n\n“This screams sunshine, smiles, dancing and just enough naughtiness!”\n\n5. Lonnie Liston Smith ‘Expansions’ (Danny Massure edit) (Flying Dutchman)\n\n“The perfect soundtrack for closing your eyes and losing yourself.”\n\n“The first time I went to Ibiza was in was July, 1997. Four of my mates were doing a season out there. As soon as we landed, we went straight to their apartment, which was right on the corner of the scabbiest part of the San Antonio strip. The place only had two rooms and there were already six people living there. It felt like there were people stacked on top of each other! But it didn’t seem to matter. After dropping off our bags we went straight to Manumission. The party was sold out and the only way we could get in was to pretend we were workers. So they dressed me up in a jester outfit so we could get in. The next night we went to Amnesia. Back then the DJ booth was in the middle of the Terrace dancefloor. It immediately became my number one club. Walking into Amnesia, it’s the only venue in the world where I still get that same feeling, that same rush of excitement I did when I was a raver. Whenever I arrive I still get whacked in the face by the atmosphere. But mostly I love the fact that you’re either in it or you’re not. The VIP balconies are high above the dancefloor and they don’t intrude. At Amnesia, it feels like you either dance or you go home. It’s really full-on, and that’s what I love about it.”\n\n1. What’s the ethos behind Transmoderna?\n\n“Transmoderna is a playground for me to experiment with sound, light, visuals, virtual reality, graphic design, technology and fashion: all things that surround the core element that is my music.”\n\n2. If you were visiting the island for the first time, how would you spend 24 hours leading up to your new party at Pacha?\n\n“I’d stay away from anything connected to nightlife during the day and explore the island, especially the north and north-east. Find a restaurant there and then go straight to whatever party seems the cheesiest one on the island – you can get cheap tickets on the beaches – and after that, come to us and dance the night away.”\n\n3. And the big reason why Ibiza is still relevant is...?\n\n“The people who love it talk about it and the people who hate it talk about it. It’s maybe comparable to football teams like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Manchester United or Juventus Turin. They are the most loved and hated clubs in their own countries, and the fact that people are still talking about them is a clear sign that they are still very relevant.”\n\n4. Is there anything readers should avoid in Ibiza?\n\n“Listening to a German who tells you what to do!”\n\n5. Within your circles, what’s the big Ibiza talking-point right now?\n\n“Can we turn it upside down?”\n\n“First of all, let me say that Privilege is huge. Last season I had the experience of playing in the Vista Club for Resistance. It’s the size of a small club, but at Privilege it’s only the side room! I never got to see the sunrise there, but everyone tells me it’s amazing, so hopefully I’ll be able to experience that this summer. The Vista Club is a really cosy space with a very intimate vibe, something that isn’t always easy to find in Ibiza because the superclubs are all so big. I think that’s what makes Privilege such an interesting venue: you have the enormity of the Main Room alongside the more intimate space of the Vista Club. This year I’m an official Resistance resident, which means I’ll get to perform on the Vista Club Terrace again. And I’ll also get to play in the Main Room at least once as well. Last year I performed in Ibiza more times than I did in my home country, which is one of the reasons I was actually thinking about moving to the island full time. That would mean spending more time at Ibiza airport, which in the summer is like a slaughterhouse! In the departure hall everyone is lying on the floor, there are people who haven’t slept, people who are still high. It can be quite funny to watch. Unless I’m the one that’s had to rush in from a gig without any sleep at all!”\n\n[Photo: Marie Wynants]\n\n“I was 22 when I first went to Ibiza. I’d just finished university in Bristol. I got to know a bunch of local lads who’d been going to Ibiza for years, and that summer they invited me to go with them. My first experience was Space in Playa d’En Bossa; Steve Lawler was resident and there was no roof. It was around 2004, the Deep Dish ‘Flashdance’ era. We also did Defected at El Divino, which is crazy because I never thought I’d be playing for Defected all these years later. We also did Subliminal at Pacha with Erick Morillo. Those were the big parties of the day and we tried to do all of them. We also spent a lot of time at Bora Bora, which was a really big thing back then. There were all these body-builders wearing next to nothing, cross-dressers and all the things you’re not used to when you’re a 22-year-old from Bristol! When I went to San Antonio I always seemed to get more drunk. That’s why Defected is so important; it gives the other side of the island a proper party. The line-ups are really strong and even though tech-house is a big deal right now, house music is almost more underground in a way. I think Defected have been really clever in sticking to their guns and supporting proper house music. I’m really happy to be a part of it.”\n\n“And the big reason why Ibiza is still relevant is… the music, of course! The continued exploration of house and techno. The more established sounds of trance and tech house. Ambient music at sunset. Music, music music. It’s the ability that music has to take the listener away to a different place and to mark that moment in time in an exotic place. Ibiza has maintained it’s particular allure as it provides a beautiful location for the more glamorous and sophisticated: those who love a sparkly bottle of €10,000 vodka that actually costs €29.99 along with we more humble types who, when thrown together, make a beautiful melting pot of people. The clubs are grand and legendary and the beaches gorgeous. Ibiza continues to believe in new parties and allows them a chance to tell their stories. Since its inception in 2011, I always knew that All Day I Dream and Ibiza were a match made in heaven. Nothing is ever guaranteed, of course, and sometimes you have to find that magic. Other times it’s just there, surrounding you. I think it’s a combination of factors that creates it. It can be the people you find yourself with – friends and strangers alike – or it can be the flow of your day. Maybe it’s because you’re high. Maybe it’s because you’re not. Our intention this year is to try to be a part of that summer magic; to tell a musical tale that those who join us will remember for years to come. No pressure, then!”\n\nPukka Up\n\nEvery Saturday from May 25 to September 21, sailing from San Antonio\n\n17:00–20:30\n\nTickets from €45\n\nwww.pukkaup.com\n\nFloat Your Boat\n\nMondays from June 3 to September 23 sailing from San Antonio\n\n18:00–21:00\n\nTickets from €39\n\nwww.floatyourboatibiza.com\n\nLost In Ibiza\n\nWednesdays from June 19 to September 25 sailing from San Antonio\n\n18:00–21:30\n\nTickets from €39\n\nwww.lostinibiza.org\n\nThe IBZ Boat Party\n\nEveryday from May 24 to September 26, sailing from Playa d’En Bossa\n\n13:00–17:00\n\nTickets from €69\n\nwww.ibzboat.com\n\nOceanbeat Ibiza\n\nMondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays from April 20 to September 28 sailing from Playa d’En Bossa\n\n13:30–17:30\n\nTickets from €69\n\nwww.oceanbeat.es\n\nCirque De La Nuit\n\nWednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from April 20 to August 30 sailing from Playa d’En Bossa\n\n18:00–21:00\n\nTickets from €59\n\nwww.cirquedelanuitibiza.com\n\nAddress Carrer del Romani 18, 07820, San Antonio | Opening times 17:00–02:00 | Ticket price from €20 | Capacity 3,200 | Soundsystem JBL | Travel From San Antonio, catch bus number 3 to Ibiza Town for just five minutes and ask the driver to stop at Zoo Project.
