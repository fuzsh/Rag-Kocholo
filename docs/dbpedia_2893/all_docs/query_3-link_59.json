        "text": "How did Ibiza become a party island?\n\nLet’s get one thing straight, Ibiza did not become internationally known as a party Valhalla overnight. The island has a rich history with its increasing popularity dating back to the early 20th century when having a car was still considered a privilege, and fedoras were cool. From a historical perspective, Spain was still a dictatorship not too long ago, that was ruled by Francisco Franco. During this time (1936 to 1975), many creatives found refuge in Ibiza. Painters, writers, musicians, etc. all came to find their inspiration on the beautiful balearic island.\n\nFast forward to the 1960s, a whole new generation of people, most commonly known as the hippies, was attracted to Ibiza. At this time, Spain was still recovering from the blows it had received during the Spanish Civil War. During this period, Ibiza became a very isolated place. Therefore, when the first travelers arrived, they were welcomed with open arms. The pioneers were attracted to the island because of its tolerance, open-minded people and laid back approach that made it perfect for the “flower power” movement of that time.\n\nIn the 1970s, the word started to spread about the place and the opening of the first clubs drew the attention of even more tourists. From this point forward, the party scene was established. Although many people relate Ibiza to electronic music, raves, and pool parties, it actually has a history with many different genres. Wham! recorded their Tropicana video on Ibiza where the infamous 41st birthday party of Freddie Mercury took place. Musical history ranges from “Ibiza Bar”, by Pink Floyd in 1969, on side two of their third studio album ‘More’ to Mike Posner’s “I Took a Pill in Ibiza” to show Avicii he was cool back in 2015.\n\nNowadays, Ibiza is known for drawing the attention of over three million tourists annually. Most of these tourists are British, Spanish, or Italian. The most famous place in Ibiza is Ibiza Town (or Eivissa in Catalan). Some of the largest clubs, such as Pacha, are located not far from there. When visiting the town, you have amazing views of the sea with green hills making up the scenery behind you. Ibiza counts a total population of a bit over 145.000 people. You can imagine the number of tourists the locals come in contact with yearly.\n\nWhen is the party season?\n\nLet’s set another thing straight. Ibiza is famous for its parties, however, there is more to do on the island than that. It heavily depends on the period of the year you decide to plan your visit (more about the best ways to get to Ibiza later). From May until October, you can expect the Ibiza nightlife to be as vibrant as ever, with the streets being occupied by tourists looking for a place to get on the dance floor. Between October and April, you can go to the island with more casual vacation plans. Restaurants are open for business and people can enjoy the incredible nature this Spanish island has to offer. In these months, you can expect the Ibiza weather to be warm to mild so packing for colder evenings would be a good idea.\n\nIf you’ve ever been clubbing in a big city, you know that part of the routine is waking up and realizing that your bank account has been plundered by a slightly less conscious version of yourself. In Ibiza, this could mean a very expensive trip. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding prices at clubs, with some saying they have become “too focused on VIP”. However, getting well-informed before going can reduce your odds of getting one of these unpleasant surprises. Clubs on the island frequently require you to pay an entry fee. This fee can range anywhere from 20€ to 70€ and up. Drinks are only sometimes included and getting one at the bar will most likely set you back more than 10€.\n\nTravel agencies offer very interesting packages for going to Ibiza. One week could cost you as little as 500€, it’s more about what you’re going to spend once you’re there. This is why we recommend you get your information before going, talk to your agency, trip organizers, or friends who have already been to find out what their experiences were with the place. If you plan all the essentials, you can arrive on the island without worries. This way you will have a better experience with the natural laid back vibe Ibiza creates, allowing visitors to really live in the moment for the duration of their holiday.\n\nHow to get your clubbing tickets in Ibiza?\n\nThe good thing about Ibiza is that you don’t need to worry about getting tickets to your favorite parties. They are basically sold every: On the beach, in the hotels and on the street. However, in order to get the best deals and make sure they are not sold out the best is to get them online on the Ibiza Spotlight website. They have a party calendar where you select your favorite events and conveniently purchase your tickets with a few mouse clicks.\n\nClubs in Ibiza\n\nBefore going to the many famous and mind-boggling clubs in Ibiza, you should know a couple of things. First of all, always bring your ID as it is likely you will be checked. It is also important to always check the dress code of each club, if the bouncers do not think your vibe resonates with that of the people inside, you will not be allowed enter. Taxis are the main mode of transport in Ibiza, these are often quite expensive for short rides so keep that in mind. A general rule is, if you get informed before going, you’ll most likely not experience any difficulties.\n\nUshuaïa Ibiza\n\nSince its opening in 2011, Ushuaïa Ibiza has been one of the main attractions of the party island. With an awesome stage production and mega DJs Ushuaïa has established itself amongst the most popular venues. It’s actually a hotel with a gigantic pool which transforms itself into a mega day party with the biggest international headliners. The parties usually start around 15:00 to 17:00 and end at 23:00 to permit hotel guests their well deserved rest. On the other hand, this gives you the opportunity to see your favorite artists before midnight and use the mornings for exploring the island.\n\nInsider tip: It’s not allowed to bring drinks into the venue, but if you have a hotel room you can take the drinking breaks on your balcony and save the 15€ to 20€ each drink at the bar.\n\nAddress: Ushuaïa, Carretera de Platja d’en Bossa 10, 07817 Sant Jordi de ses Salines\n\nAmnesia Ibiza\n\nAmnesia is located not far from Ibiza Town. It opened its doors back in 1976. Since then it has won multiple “Best Global Club” awards. The club has a capacity of up to 5.000 people and is divided into the “Main Room” and the “Terrace”. Both areas have a different lineup. The dress code at Amnesia is rather formal. For guys, it is advised to wear formal shoes as too casual sneakers often don’t resonate with the vibe of the club. Tickets sell for 20€ to 50€ and up and do not always include a drink. The club itself is a spectacular mix of light shows, confetti cannons, spectacular decorations, and ambiance. Amnesia Ibiza is generally known for its EDM live sets. Some well-known people who have previously gone partying there include Lionel Messi, Christiano Ronaldo, Mick Jagger, Shakira, Leonardo di Caprio, and so on.\n\nAddress: Amnesia, Carretera Ibiza a San Antonio, Km 5, 07816 Ibiza\n\nPacha Ibiza\n\nIt wouldn’t be surprising if you’ve ever been to Pacha. There are versions of this venue all over the world. Pacha Ibiza, however, was inaugurated in 1973. It is actually part of Pacha Holdings, a Spanish holding company that mainly focuses on hospitality. That’s why you can also book a stay at the Pacha hotel when you’re visiting the island. Pacha is practically located in Ibiza Town. The club is known for its 1970s vibe. This can be seen by decorations inspired by flowers, love, and bright colored lights. Main music genres include house, techno, and reggaeton. Prices for tickets vary between 20€ and 50€. Be aware that you will be charged extra if you decide to buy your tickets at the club so it’s always better to buy them online.\n\nAddress: Pacha, Avenida 8 d’Agost, 07800 Ibiza\n\nDC10 Ibiza\n\nDC10 Ibiza is known as a true underground club. The club first opened doors in 1999. It is located in what used to be an airplane hangar and comes with a covered terrace. Don’t expect to find advertisements and posters about the club everywhere. They keep promotion to a minimum and they do that for one reason, to attract a crowd that really comes for the experience. Genres include techno and tech-house, among others. The events are cheaper compared to other top venues. Make sure to check before though, bigger events will still cost 50€. Generally, prices are lower though.\n\nAddress: DC10, Carretera las Salinas, km 1, 07818 Sant Josep de sa Talaia\n\nHï Ibiza\n\nHï Ibiza is sort of a new club in Ibiza. Sort of because it was formerly known as Space, which opened to business back in 1986. Eventually, Space closed in 2016 and was subsequently bought by the owners that turned it into Hï Ibiza. The club is known for bringing some of the most famous names in electronic music on stage. The venue features a fantastic sound system and has plenty of other gadgets to top it off. Since you’re getting that kind of entertainment, you pay extra. Tickets generally cost between 20€ and 50€ but go up to 60€ and more for certain events. This is a truly modernized club located at Playa d’en Bossa. The club is divided into two rooms, Theatre, and the Club. This is the type of club where you simply cannot have seen it all in one night.\n\nAddress: Hï Ibiza, Platja d’en Bossa, 07817 Sant Josep de sa Talaia\n\nSwag Ibiza\n\nIbiza is the place to go if you’re into electronic music. However, for some time now, genres like hip-hop and R&B also have a more mainstream appeal. Swag offers partygoers an alternative with a wide variety of different styles of urban music. The club is located in the center of Playa d’en Bossa. The beauty of Swag is that, unlike most clubs in Ibiza, you can wear whatever you want. The dress code is, express your individuality. Swag is open seven days a week, meaning you can literally go dancing there every single day. Expect to pay 20€ and up for entrance with increased prices for events.\n\nAddress: Swag Ibiza, Carrer de la Murtra 5, 07817 Sant Josep de sa Talaia\n\nHow to get to Ibiza?\n\nThe most common way to go to Ibiza is by plane. Prices for flights to Ibiza heavily vary depending on the season, from where you’re flying, and (if applicable) the package you got. The airport is located about 7 km from Ibiza Town. A flight from Madrid to Ibiza is about 40 minutes. When you arrive at the airport, the easiest way to get to Ibiza Town is by getting a taxi. The trip will cost about 35€ and will take about 15 minutes until you arrive.\n\nAnother popular mode of transportation to Ibiza is using high-speed ferry connections. These depart from ports on the Spanish mainland such as Barcelona, Denia, and Valencia. The trip generally takes between two and three hours. Prices vary depending on the season, if you’re going by car or not, how many people you’re going with, etc. Make sure to check out the website of Balearia to plan your trip.\n\nJoin an organized group trip to Ibiza\n\nCitylife is a Madrid-based company that organizes group trips for mainly young internationals around Spain, Portugal and Morocco. Their trips usually include transportation, accommodation and activities. With respect to Ibiza they offer a “meet us there” version where you take care of your plane tickets and meet up with the group at the hotel. Those trips are usually organized in June for the Ibiza opening parties and in September for the Ibiza closing parties. The trips have experienced guides so you don’t need to worry about things to do in Ibiza as all is taken care of but at the same time you have the freedom to follow your own plans.

The departure of a man from single life to a new kind of adventure. Therefore, it’s of utmost importance that the stag party is a personalized unforgettable experience for the bachelor.

When it comes to clubs and other nightlife activities, this is definitely true. Clubs in the capital of Spain are known for staying open until the early morning. For you, this means there’s more to do with the limited time you have in Madrid. Put a spotlight on the group’s bachelor by booking an exclusive VIP table. Venues are often big and beautifully decorated making for a one-of-a-kind VIP experience. In Madrid, it’s really important to reserve your VIP table beforehand. Beware that many clubs utilize strict dress codes and work with reservations. Therefore, we highly recommend you reserve your tables beforehand to avoid any unexpected bumps in the road.\n\nActivity #3: Check out the incredible Real Madrid stadium tour\n\nYou could say Spain is a bit of a football country.

The simplistic mix of flavors the Mediterranean cuisine offers just never fails to bring a smile to your face. To put the cherry on top, going out for dinner in Spain is generally a lot cheaper than in more northern parts of Europe. Remember that the locals have dinner later than you might be used to, usually between 9:00 pm and 11:00 pm. If you really want to enjoy the Spanish atmosphere with your squad, going for dinner a little later will surely give you a good idea of what it’s like. If you plan on doing a food tour, we suggest you make your reservation beforehand to secure your seats as the good places are usually packed.\n\nActivity #5: The most entertaining way to get around: The beer bike!\n\nNo need to act like there’s any kind of athletic purposes here. The beer bike is maybe the most hilarious way to get around the city with your friends.

Beer bikes need to be reserved beforehand and have a maximum capacity depending on the bike you get. Make sure to check it out and make your reservation before you come to Madrid.\n\nActivity #6: Discover Madrid with a walking tour\n\nMadrid truly is a beautiful city with so much to offer if you’re interested in adding some culture to your trip.

Understanding the city’s history will definitely add a whole other dimension to the overall experience. Additionally, you might discover some cool spots you can, later on, go and revisit. Walking tours can be booked on the spot, however, if you’re coming with a bigger group, making a reservation is still the most secure way to have your experience guaranteed.\n\nActivity #7: Learn how to make the perfect cocktail\n\nThere’s a beauty to making the perfect cocktail.

Assemble the guys and experience this fun way of learning a new skill together. Make sure to reserve your cocktail class beforehand to pick the package that suits your preferences best.\n\nActivity #8: Explore the city with a segway tour\n\nSegways are hard to understand. Are they an electric bike? Are they a mobility scooter? Nobody knows. One thing’s for sure though, they are really fun to ride around. A segway tour is a fun and easy way to explore the city together with a guide who can tell all kinds of interesting stories. We advise you to reserve your segway tour before arriving in Madrid to avoid any inconveniences.\n\nActivity #9: Escape the city with a day trip\n\nThe reason for Madrid’s awesomeness also has a lot to do with what you can find outside the city center.
