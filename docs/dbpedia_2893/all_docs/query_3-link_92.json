See how many of these 100 Ibiza facts you know!\n\nNature\n\n1.On Ibiza, there is sunshine for 10 hours a day, 300 days per year.\n\n2.The ground on Ibiza is orange. This is because of the pine trees that grow across the island. When their needles fall, the tannins within seep into the ground, dying it the distinctive orange colour.\n\n3.There is no fresh running water on Ibiza, at least not on the surface anyway. The island’s only river is practically dry, and the island’s fresh water supply is welled from deep underground.\n\n4.Ibiza isn’t really an island. Millions of years ago, the Mediterranean basin was flooded by the Atlantic, creating the Mediterranean Sea and leaving the mountain tops that are now the Balearic Islands poking out of the surface.\n\n5.The rocky islands to the east of Ibiza are considered to be the 3rd most magnetic spot on the globe. Es Vedra is supposed to contain such an unusual mixture of minerals and elements that they interfere with magnetic equipment. Some of the hippy community who were around Ibiza in the 1960’s still claim Es Vedra is a beacon to guide Aliens to earth.\n\n6.Ibiza’s famous salt flats have been in use for over 2000 years. As water evaporates in the summer, a sparkling layer of pure salt is left at the bottom of the lakes – making for incredible photos.\n\n7. The water around the island is so clear because of Neptune grass, seaweed that keeps the water clean and pure.\n\n8. Wherever you stay on the island, you’re never more than an hour’s drive from a beach.\n\n9. The longest beach on the island is Playa d’en Bossa.

Techno legend Sven Vath first came to Ibiza in 1980, after hitchhiking from Frankfurt.\n\n23. In an attempt to target a quieter and more cultured tourism scene, local government now ensures all nightclubs are closed by the sensible hour of 6am.\n\n24. When it first opened in the 1980s, Amnesia’s opening hours were 3am to midday. It now opens from midnight until 6am.\n\n25. Some DJs earn over £50,000 per performance in Ibiza – even one who famously played from a pre-recorded CD.\n\n26. There are six different ‘superclubs’ in Ibiza – Pacha, Space, Amnesia, Privilege, Eden and Es Paradis.\n\n27. After 27 successful years, Space nightclub is being sold at the end of 2016. It will be taken over by the brains behind equally renowned venue Ushuaia.\n\n28. Ibiza’s Hard Rock Hotel was the first Hard Rock beach venue in Europe.\n\n29. Until the regulations changed, meaning that clubs have to close by 6am, it was possible to party for 22 hours a day in Ibiza.\n\n30. By night, you can often join in a raucous foam party, where crowds are literally covered in foam as they dance. Don’t wear anything that can’t get wet!\n\n31. This little island has a buzzing LGBT+ scene. There’s more than 30 clubs, bars and hotels with Calle de la Vilgen acting as the main LGBT+ hub.\n\n32. When famous DJ Carl Cox first came to Ibiza, he slept in the back of a car. Today he is worth millions and has run his hugely successful club night at Space for 16 years.\n\n33. The international DJ Awards happen every year on Ibiza, and includes a Bedroom DJ award for wannabe dancefloor heroes.\n\n34. Radio 1 DJ Lisa I’Anson was famously sacked from her Ibiza breakfast show after partying so hard at Manumission that she failed to arrive at the studio in time.\n\n35.

Your own VIP table at one of the superclubs could set you back as much as 6,000 euros.\n\nHistory\n\n44. According to legend, Nostradamus predicted that due to the unique winds around the island, Ibiza may well be the only place to survive an impending nuclear holocaust.\n\n45. Ibiza has previously been claimed by just about everyone – Spanish, French, Greek and Roman empires, as well as Norwegians on a crusade to Jerusalem and British sailors on their way between Gibraltar and Menorca.\n\n46. The settlers who founded Ibiza originally named it Ibozzim, and dedicated the island to Bes – the God of music and dance.\n\n47.
