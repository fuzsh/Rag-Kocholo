        "text": "Dean Burnett spent two summers in Ibiza as a resident DJ, and during his 12-year career to date has supported well-known artists such as Joel Corry, Ian Van Dhal and Judge Jules.\n\nIn recent years, though, the 31-year-old has began following a different career path and worked in palliative care with the NHS Ayrshire and Arran until 2022, when he took up a role as a care assistant with the Scottish Ambulance Service.\n\nHe said: “I love the fact I'm out on the road all day long and I get to see many new places in Scotland that I have never seen before and meet so many people.\n\n“My shifts are always different and I'm always working with different characters. I’d love to move into an accident and emergency ambulance role as I continue my career within the Scottish Ambulance Service.”\n\nHowever, Dean is still using his making use of his talents as he lends a hand to charity.\n\nIn his spare time, he now DJs at The Garage in Sauchiehall St, Glasgow for 'Include Me 2 Club', a not for profit organisation that hosts various events for kids and adults with disabilities and Additional Support Needs (ASN).\n\nHe appears at these events alongside DJs such as George Bowie, Garry Spence and Cassie from Clyde 1.\n\nDean says that while he loved his time in Ibiza, he is delighted now at having the chance to give back.\n\nHe commented: “I absolutely loved it in Ibiza but I was getting too old for the long hours and constant late nights.\n\n\"I’ve always really wanted to give back to the community and when I saw an advert looking for a DJ for this fantastic organisation, I didn’t hesitate. I’ve been doing it for over four years now.\n\n“The benefits for doing this for adults with disabilities means they can experience what a night out in a nightclub would be like but they can do so in a safe space, surrounded by their peers. They absolutely love it.”\n\nAlongside DJing for the charity, Dean also performed a 24-hour DJ set for the nursing home he used to work in where he raised more than £1,000.\n\nHis next gig will be taking place on October 26, at Arthur Street Kitchen in Ayr."
