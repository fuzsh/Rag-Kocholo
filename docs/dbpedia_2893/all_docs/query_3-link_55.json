        "text": "The world's biggest nightclub and an Ibiza institution is looking sad and decrepit after two years of Covid-induced shutters.\n\nSuperclub Privilege near San Rafael could hold 10,000 clubbers each pulsating night and hosted the likes of Freddie Mercury, Madonna and David Bowie.\n\nThe massive summer party venue covers an area of 69,968 sq ft - the size of an airport hangar.\n\nBut after 20 months of being left to the elements, Superclub is looking an absolute state.\n\nPaint is peeling off the walls, metal fixtures are rusting in the sun and decorative features are weathering outside.\n\nBuses which used to transport thousands of passionate clubbers to the hottest night in town have had their windows smashed and outsides covered in graffiti.\n\nPrivilege started in the early 1970s as an innocent restaurant and swimming pool, but after being bought by footballer Jose Antonio Santamaria in 1979 became more risqué.\n\nBy the mid-90s it had a reputation as a gay highlight of the Balearics and was renamed Privilege in 1995.\n\nThe likes of Boy George, Madonna, David Bowie, Joni Mitchell, Tina Turner, Kylie Minogue, Spandau Ballet and Freddie Mercury stepped through its hallowed doors during its heyday.\n\nThe Queen singer and Montserrat Caballe filmed the video inside the club for their song Barcelona.\n\nPrivilege is also mentioned in the film Kevin & Perry Go Large.\n\nCovid restrictions in Ibiza mean nightclubs can only operate seating and outdoor spaces.\n\nAnyone familiar with Privilege will know that's not the beach haunt's style.\n\nKnown for its heavy dance and techno nights, the super-club depended on ground-shaking crowds packed in for its unrivalled reputation.\n\nTo stay up to date with all the latest news, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters here .\n\nDuring the pandemic, that has become impossible.\n\nSuperclub Privilege has been closed for almost two years, though the true toll of its closure only became clear in recent depressing images.\n\nJust last week Ibiza changed its Covid restrictions to mean social gatherings between 2am and 6am can go ahead without restrictions.\n\nBut Superclub Privilege will need plenty of time to get back on its feet."
