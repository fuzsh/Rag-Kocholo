        "text": "Nightclub in Ibiza, Spain\n\nSpace ( , Spanish: [esˈpejs], Catalan: [əsˈpejs]) was a superclub on the island of Ibiza, Spain from 1986 to 2016,[1] owned by STANCA. In 2022 the brand opened a bar near Cafe Mambo. They sometimes run popup events around the world, but don't have a fixed club at the time of writing in 2023.\n\nIt was awarded \"Best Global Club\" at the International Dance Music Awards in 2005, 2006, 2012, 2013, and 2014.[2] Space was located in Platja d'en Bossa on the outskirts of Ibiza Town, close to the airport. In 2017, Hï Ibiza opened in Space Ibiza's original location. Space Ibiza announced in 2021 that it would reopen its doors in 2022.[3] This resulted in the new Space Bar near Cafe Mambo, though the club night is yet to return to Ibiza, however the club has since opened at a new location in Riccione, Italy.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSpace first opened in early summer of 1986. The opening night featured the opening of the water park Aguamar located behind the club, party-goers being able to take advantage of the waterslides at night.\n\nSpace in its current form began in 1989 when Pepe Rosello, Ibiza nightclub owner since 1963, took over the establishment, which in the four years since it was built had housed a conference hall with a discothèque. The opening policy agreed with Spanish licensing laws, which state that an establishment must close for at least two hours a day.\n\nFollowing the closure of three of Ibiza's clubs at the start of the 2007 season, local authorities have hinted at plans to alter the licensing regulations that allow clubs to open for 22 hours per day.[5] Suggestions at present would allow for clubs to open at noon.[6] Clubs may not open before 8 a.m.\n\nSpace, DC10 and Bora-Bora in Sant Josep allows after-hours parties.[5]\n\nThe first DJs to shape the venue into its current shape were Alex P and Brandon Block, two British club DJs/producers and residents of Sunday Space Terrace — Space's outdoor terrace, where airliners roar overhead.[7] This open terrace and the roaring sound of the airliners breaking through the booming dance music has become one of the club's defining features. Since Amnesia and Privilege have had to encase their open-air dance floors due to noise complaints from their neighbours, Space remains one of the few venues where club-goers can have this experience, and the crowd's greeting of the arriving aircraft[8][9] has also become a ritual among the club's patrons.\n\nOther resident DJs/producers responsible for the club's popularity include Reche, Jose de Divina, Jon Ulysses and Monkey.\n\nCarl Cox was most associated with the club for nearly 15 years, thanks to his \"Music is Revolution\" night.[10][11] When Pepe Rosello stepped down from the club, Cox decided to move on, playing a nine-hour final set in September 2016.[10] Space released compilations every year via the former Azuli label and now with CR2 Records.[12]\n\nPost closure\n\n[edit]\n\nSince the club closed in 2016, it has since been bought by Ushuaïa Entertainment and was reopened in 2017 under the name Hï Ibiza.[13][14]\n\nNotable events\n\n[edit]\n\n\"We Love Sundays\"\n\n[edit]\n\nSpace's Flagship Sunday sessions began in 1999. We Love... Space is a weekly party which opens at 4:30 p.m. on Sunday and keeps going until 6:00 a.m. Monday morning. The event runs for 16 weeks throughout the summer season.\n\nNotable DJs\n\n[edit]\n\nMartin Garrix,DJ black coffee,Armin van Buuren, David Guetta, Sven Väth, Nicolas Jaar, Josh Wink, Carl Cox, DJ Koze, Dr. Motte, Michel v.
