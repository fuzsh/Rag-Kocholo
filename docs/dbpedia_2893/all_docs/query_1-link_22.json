        "text": "Ibiza superclub Privilege has been approved for a major renovation by the island’s Tourism Planning Commission, Periódico de Ibiza y Formentera reports.\n\nThe San Antonio venue, which has been closed since 2019, will receive €8.2 million from the local government to install solar energy systems and improve water circulation. It comes as part of a funding scheme to rejuvenate tourist attractions on the island, and has sparked rumours that the 10,000-capacity club may have plans to re-open.\n\nFour other local tourist establishments will also receive funding including San Antonio’s Palladium del Hotel Palmyra and Apartamentos Es Cantó in Playa d’en Bossa, which will both increase in star ratings as a result of the renovations.\n\nSpeaking to Periódico de Ibiza y Formentera, The Minister of Tourism Planning, Mariano Juan, said: “We encourage private investment to modernize and make our hotel plant and other tourist establishments more sustainable with incentive policies without expanding the number of tourist places.”\n\nAccording to recent Facebook posts, Privilege may actually have been undergoing renovations since June last year, when the club shared an image of the venue with the caption: “The quiet little road leading to the Privilege under construction.”\n\nMore recently, a large “COMING SOON” message was added to Privilege’s website, bolstering rumours that the Ibiza institution might be set to re-open in 2024.\n\nPrivilege’s license was suspended in 2018 after an inspection revealed that the club had made illegal structural alterations in order to increase its capacity. For the 2019 season, the last time the night club was open, multiple sections of the venue remained closed off after being deemed unsafe.\n\nGrupo Empresas Matutes, the parent company of the Palladium Hotel Group, acquired full ownership of the Ibiza club last year through Bahía de San Antonio SA. Despite the confirmed renovations, it remains unclear whether Privilege will re-open next year."
