        "text": "Music Is The Answer I Don’t Remember The Question\n\nOn the one hand, Ibiza is a real hippie island and you can relax, but at the same time Ibiza is also known worldwide as the party mecca of Europe. We also went on an adventure a number of times in the evening and we have listed the best places to go out in Ibiza below.\n\nGoing out in Ibiza is a guarantee for a fantastic evening. The large discotheques guarantee an exciting nightlife. It is not for nothing that Ibiza is undeniably associated with clubs, music and discotheques. Ibiza is everything a person can and can expect in the party and party area. Especially during the summer, the island is a real attraction for young partygoers from all over the world who want to get in touch with what Ibiza is known worldwide for: going out, DJs and smashing parties. Since 99% of the partying takes place during the warm summer months, most clubs and discos are also only open from the beginning of June to the end of September. Exceptions to this are Pacha, open all year round, and Es Paradis and Space, which open their doors earlier in the year to welcome the nightlife crowd.\n\nPrivilege Ibiza is one of the largest clubs in the world. The club is known for the spectacular parties that are held there. What could be better than going crazy in the biggest club in Ibiza!As soon as you enter you look your eyes out. You walk down a grand staircase and are in the middle of one of the largest halls you have ever seen. The main hall of the club is just as big as a true airplane hangar.\n\nThe dance floor is also one of the largest in the world, including a real swimming pool. Above this pool you will find the DJ booth. The other clubs in Ibiza can easily fit into the main hall of this club. There is no less than enough room for 10,000 partygoers!\n\nIn addition to the largest room, you also have the Vista Club. This room is surrounded by glass and from here you have a beautiful view of Ibiza town. This is especially wonderful when the sun rises slowly while everyone is still partying.\n\nPrivilege Ibiza has been known for years because of the crazy parties like Mamumussuib. In addition, DJ Tiësto had a fixed day in the club every week for years. Today the club is best known for parties like SuperMartXe, Afterlife, I Am A Rich Bich, Creamfields, Resistance, Saura, Pure Carl Cox and Taboo Motel.\n\nTicket prices for the various parties in the Privilege Ibiza vary between € 35 and € 50. We recommend that you purchase the tickets through the club's official website or through special promotional teams often found around town and on popular beaches. This often saves a lot of money with the tickets at the door on the evening itself. In addition, you have a beer for € 10 and you can get mixed drinks from € 12.\n\nYou can find Privilege Ibiza near San Rafeal, near the Amnesesia Ibza. The club is easily accessible by car, but the car park is rather small in relation to the club. We therefore recommend that you leave on time if you want to go by car. In addition, every taxi driver on the island knows how to reach the club. For a taxi from San Antonia, Playa d'en Bossa or Ibiza stad you pay about € 10 to € 15.\n\nThere are also regular buses from these places to the club and the club also has its own disco bus that stops at various points on the island to pick up party people. It is about a 10-minute drive from Ibiza town.
