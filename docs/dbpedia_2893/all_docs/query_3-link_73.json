        "text": "Spain\n\nIBIZA\n\nIbiza takes the crown as the ultimate party destination in Europe, if not worldwide. From daytime pool and boat parties to all-night revelry in the island's mega clubs, the party scene here is like no other. With over 15 major clubs, each hosting a distinct party every night, Ibiza offers endless opportunities for round-the-clock party madness. Important to note that the Ibiza clubbing scene revolves around three main zones: San Antonio is known for its affordability and lively atmosphere, popular among English tourists. Ibiza Town, favored by locals and families, offers a quieter and more upscale experience with top clubs nearby. San Rafael, positioned between the two, hosts major clubs like Amnesia and Privilege, making it a prime party destination accessible via shuttle buses."
