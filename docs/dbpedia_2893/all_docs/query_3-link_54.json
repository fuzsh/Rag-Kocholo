At the same time, the ‘flower power’ revolution descended on Ibiza, attracting hippies from across Europe for its unspoilt natural beauty, spiritual energy and laid-back pace of life.\n\nAmnesia was the birthplace of the Balearic beat, being the first club to open on the island in the mid-1970s. A young philosopher named Antonio Escohotado signed a lease for a beautiful 18th-century country finca which, over the years, underwent a spectacular transformation to stand as one of the island’s most iconic establishments today. Originally named ‘The Workshop of Forgetfulness’, Escohotado soon discovered that the Greek word ‘Amnesia’ captured everything he wanted and more. The entrepreneur had a strong desire to create a place that people would go to forget about their problems, indulging in an unknown world that was far away from their ordinary routine.\n\nPacha followed in 1973, just a small farmhouse with a bar and dancefloor surrounded by countryside fields. The Urgell brothers, Ricardo and Piti, had found success in a small club in Sitges and decided that it was time to venture to Ibiza to try their luck with Pacha. For the locals and young Spaniards, there was an enormous gap in how they had fun, feeling the cultural void of the Franco regime. Pacha offered them something completely different, standing as a symbol of freedom, where one could cross the threshold of scrutiny, let down their hair and dance.\n\nShortly afterwards, Ku Club joined the burgeoning nightlife scene, now known as Privilege. Starting as a simple community swimming pool which still stands in its main room, in the 1980s the venue became the star attraction for the island’s first hedonistic crowds, with Freddie Mercury and Grace Jones being just some of their most famous guests.\n\nThe 1980s – Celebrity status\n\nThis was a precedent for all things to come, as gradually the reputation of the clubs spread across the world, attracting the rich and famous who wanted to experience the island's unrivalled nightlife scene. Pikes Ibiza is especially famous for its star-studded list of clientele. George Michael filmed his video for Wham's 'Club Tropicana' here in 1983 and Freddie Mercury hosted his raucous birthday party in 1987. Queen's frontman invited over 700 guests in a party that has gone down in Ibiza’s history, with Bon Jovi, Tony Curtis, Naomi Campbell, Boy George and Spandau Ballet being just some of his attendees.\n\nFrom the 1990s – Europe's party capital\n\nRave music became popular in the 1980s, with Balearic house pushing forward in the 1990s. Today, the island’s offering of music is a daring and eclectic mix of musical styles that have led the island to become one of the most fascinating places to visit in the world. New clubs have opened and old ones closed, replaced by more contemporary concepts, but Ibiza's place as Europe's party capital still hasn't been challenged. A night out in Ibiza is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, not to be missed!"
