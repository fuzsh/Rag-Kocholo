Filé, pronounced fee-lay, means thread or string in French, and refers to the dried and ground leaves of the North American sassafras tree.This essential ingredient was introduced to the Cajuns by the Choctaw Indians in the 18th century.\n\nEric McCree has traveled extensively throughout the world working as an audio engineer with stage productions. During his travels, he had the privilege to explore authentic regional cuisines across the American South, which inspired his dishes and culinary vision.\n\nWhile in New Orleans, Eric became enthralled with the food he sampled, but it was not until he reached Lafayette - the heart of \"Cajun Country\" - that he experienced the familial celebratory soul of Louisiana cooking.\n\nHere, family recipes had been handed down for centuries. Every dish was prepared by hands groomed for generations. Dishes were made from scratch with fresh seasonal ingredients, and pots simmered slowly all day in preparation for family gatherings and parties.\n\nThe food he observed was not quick and easy cooking. It was bold food with cultural significance and time-honored techniques that reflected one of America's most diverse cultures in both ritual and taste."
