If you think you can't ask for anything more from life, add the art of the great Ricardito and his band, Piki Candela and the Macumba de Mi Son.\n\nSundays: from the 12th of May to the 29th September\n\nLatin rhythms, music and dance, take over Hotel Cubanito thanks to Sherlock and José, two true lovers of salsa and its virtues. Get ready to move your hips as never before, with flavour straight from Havana.\n\nTuesday & Fridays: from the 10th of May to the 8th October."
