        "text": "On Wednesday 30th June 2010 at the worlds largest club Privilege in Ibiza, there is a very special opening party happening called Warung Brazil, Warung meaning . The party originates and has been imported from the Warung Beach Club on the fine sands of Praia Brava which has a breathtaking backdrop panorama of the Atlantic Ocean. Globally acknowledged as South Brazil’s Mecca for underground electronic skulduggery and proclaimed to be one of the best clubs in the world by the likes of Sven Vath, Luciano and Loco Dice, who’s going to argue with that? I’m certainly keen to learn more about this fascinating South American house and techno movement. Upon arriving into the rich Adobe Flash soaked website, the steady kick drum, punchy hats and skippy percussion of Hernan Cattaneo’s Pastida remix which kicks in on the sites media player has me nodding immediately. . . I’m provisionally hooked. As I scan across the page I realise I seriously need to brush up on my Portuguese as I can’t understand a bloody word . . . never mind I find the photo section which is teeming with very attractive humans and an obvious hedonistic party atmosphere, as I pick my jaw back up off the floor I am starting to accept that the Warung ethos may well be a winner.\n\nWarung’s reputation for showcasing top notch DJ’s and blooding upcoming talent will be upheld this season at Privilege with the main room hosting Felix Da Housecat, Sharam, Gui Borratto, Robert Babicz, 16B Lolitas and special live appearances by Dirty Vegas, Kevin Saunderson’s Inner City and Life is a Loop.\n\nThe alternative Coco Loco adds a different dimension to the main room, with DJ's Alex Niggemann, Coyu, Solomun, Gorge, Superlounge, Gavin Herlihy, Sebo-K, Alex Kenji, Simon Baker, Geddes, Uner, Ricky Ryan, Kasper, Robbie Romero, Matt Tolfrey and Will Saul. European labels Get Physical, 8 Bit, Mobilee, Supernature, Soulfooled, Murmurr, Leftroom, Hope & Audio Therapy and Baracca are hosting this room for the summer and this is where you'll probably find me in a dimly lit corner communicating via the medium of dance. I think it's fair to say that this has the potential to be the party of the season . . . what do you reckon?\n\nAll in all a marvelous spread, see you in Privilge on a Wednesday very soon."
