        "text": "London label and party Solid Grooves is heading to Ibiza for a second sizzling summer. The much loved party and label will take up residency each and every Thursday at the hotter-than-hot Vista Club at Privilege. Following on from an impressive season at Sankeys Ibiza last year, the 2016 season kicks off on June 9th and will raise the bar once more.\n\nVista Privilege — where Do Not Sleep and Elrow made such an impact in 2015 — is a breathtaking club with big glass walls allowing views out over the White Isle. When the sun comes up, it makes for a magical setting that is an essential Ibiza experience, especially with such great light and sound and Solid Grooves’ top headliners.\n\nThe aim here will be to bring back a hedonistic spirit away from the beaten track. Helping achieve that will be top international DJs old and new from the worlds of house and tech, plus a crack team of residents that know how to work a floor and balance a night perfectly. This includes Solid Grooves Records co-founder and inventive tech house artist PAWSA, top tech duo and Lost Records pair Leftwing & Kody, Moon Harbour’s on-form star Detlef, plus Solid Grooves’ very own Dennis Cruz and founder Michael Bibi.\n\nSays Michael on the move for 2016 – ‘We are all very excited for the big move over to Vista Privilege this summer. The team has been working hard, we have some amazing guest artists and a strong Solid Grooves crew for the season. The venue in my eyes is one of the most exciting spaces on the island for an intimate ‘off location’ vibe, but still has everything you need for a serious party. We will be sure to have a few special surprises and magical sunrise moments when the sun comes through those glass walls.’\n\nThere will be plenty of big name brand associations throughout the season, and headliners will all be revealed soon. The mouthwatering Solid Grooves season will run June 9th for twelve memorable weeks so get making plans now before it’s sold out.\n\nTickets and information"
