        "text": "Hello,\n\nI visited Ibiza for the first time last week, and went to a lot of different clubs, also Tiesto at Privilege. I had pre-ordered tickets here at Ibiza Spotlights, and was able to enter with them, but the guy at the entrance told me no digital cameras were allowed due to \"copyright reasons\". I had to leave my digital camera (really small ixus digital photo camera) at the club store, and even pay 3 Euros for deposit fees.\n\ni have some questions:\n\n- why is Privilege obviously the only club (I was at Space, Amnesia, Pacha, and some smaller clubs) that takes visiors digital cameras away at the entrance?\n\n- Why is that fact not noted BEFORE buying tickets? Why is it not in the information you receive when you buy the tickets online?\n\n- when I was in the club, I counted about 30 persons who somehow managed to bring their digital aameras into the club anyway, and were making photos and videos (and I did not count the poeple with mobile phone cameras, only real digital cameras). How did they manage to enter with their digital equipment, while I failed?\n\nI am really disappointed, because when I go to a club on a holiday, I usually make photos to share with my people at home. Had I known before that there was a non-photo regulation there, I would not have visted the club.\n\n-Its a pretty well known fact that you can't take cameras in the clubs esp Privilege (this forum is testament to that) so is it really necessary to print that fact on a ticket??? Might I suggest a little research maybe???\n\nNot all the people who buy tickets do read the forums. But they read the facts in the ticketshop, so this is the suitable place to clearly point out the facts, like the other requirements (photo-ID, credit-card bringing, etc.) Forums are nice, but optional, and it is impossible to read every tiny fact there. I have read a lot topics in forums about various clubbing topics, but nothing about a bagatelle like bringing a small digicam. Seriously, it never ever came to my mind that this might be forbidden in any club at all. I personally have visited a lot of clubs all over Europe this year, this is the first time I had problems bringing a camera in.\n\n-Maybe professional photographers/island photographers (the island community is quite small so maybe they're known on the door).\n\nProbable, but unlikely, they didn't look anything like that. I rather guess they had a good place to hide their cameras.\n\nPS. I would imagine the logistics of taking the mobiles off everyone inside privilege would be a bit of a nightmare and therefore practically impossible...\n\nOkay, but when we think that many modern mobile phones produce images and videos in a quality comparable to digital pocket cameras (we are not talking about DSLR cameras here), then it is simply unfair to have people deposit their cameras, but let the mobile-phone photographers go, only because there are too many of them. If they really fear copyright issues, then one smuggled camera or one mobile phone by the wrong person is sufficient to show it all to the whole world. But in fact, I don't understand their fussy concerns, the videos on youtube and elsewhere on the internet are free promotion, who loses money when they exist?\n\nAnother point that came to my mind when I was inside the club is, that it is really hypocritical to mess with the camera owners, but leave the drugdealers unoffended. Seriously, I was offered pills by six or seven different persons, some tried it over and over again although I clearly rejected their offers, it was really annoying. In one occasion, a security guy was standing right next to us, clearly seeing what was going on, and doing nothing against that. But that's another topic.\n\nHello,\n\nI visited Ibiza for the first time last week, and went to a lot of different clubs, also Tiesto at Privilege.

Had I known before that there was a non-photo regulation there, I would not have visted the club.\n\nnot every person gets searched hence a fair amount of cameras make it inside. i typically put mine in my back pocket and they will only find it if they frisk me. at Amnesia last time we had a VIP table so we walked in without a pat down.\n\nthe toughest places currently to get one in are Amnesia and Privilege. Pacha doesn't care... Space is more lax about it than before per posts on this message board.\n\ni've asked about the no-camera rule before, and I've been told its so the djs don't constantly see flashing lights in their eyes. I call BS on that reason (think of all of the strobe lights, etc. in the club) but i've heard it more than once at more than one venue so who knows.\n\nthis policy has been going on for as long as i've been going to Ibiza (1996) so its nothing new or related to a specific dj.\n\nThe reason that the clubs take your camera is that they charge quiet a hefty fee for any commercial footage shot in the club.\n\nIf I am a producer of a TV Documentary and I have paid 2000 for the right to exclusive footage of a particular night, I will expect not to see it appearing anywhere else. If it does, its a breach of contract.\n\nThe product that the Club is offering is much more valuable if its exclusive, therefore clubs will always try to limit all professional footage.\n\nIt all depends on who's shooting the footage. A professional cameraman can shoot broadcast quality media on most good quality DV's. Amature stuff is not much a worry to them.\n\nSo clubs have taken the easy option and restricted all use of cameras in certain clubs rather than trying to identify the professional players.\n\nthe main reason that hasn't been mentioned so far is that the clubs don't want joe public to have the possibility of recording/photographing something that could get them in trouble, if you know what i mean.\n\nalso, don't ever try and apply 'normal' logic to ibiza clubs and how they are run, you'll only end up more confused and frustrated. with regard to cameras, that is just the way it is.....\n\nHad I known before that there was a non-photo regulation there, I would not have visted the club.\n\nFINALLY, are you really telling me that you wouldn't have gone..........seriously??!! i was about to begin to counter your point, but i could go for days. suffice to say that when photos of the event become more important than experiencing the event itself, you need to give yourself a talking to."
