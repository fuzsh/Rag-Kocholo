        "text": "30 years have passed since Nicky Holloway, Danny Rampling and Paul Oakenfold returned to the UK from Ibiza and spread word of carefree, ecstasy-fuelled partying to Balearic beats.\n\nBut clubbing on the island started way before that, with Pacha opening in the late '60s and Amnesia's beginnings in the mid-'70s. Then there's the legendary Space (replaced by Hï Ibiza this year), Privilege, DC-10 and loads more.\n\nOf course, Ibiza wouldn't be the Ibiza that's loved by ravers if it wasn't for the likes of Sasha, Carl Cox, tINI and Sven Väth heading up parties through the years, either, and the likes of Nina Kraviz, Ricardo Villalobos and Cassy touching down on the White Isle shores.\n\nBasically, Ibiza's a sun-soaked party paradise and, in similar vein to the history of Ibiza in 100 tracks we gave you recently, we've decided to paint the history of Ibiza in 25 photos.\n\nFlick through the gallery above for a taste of sun, hedonism, big-name DJs and Ibiza's famous clubs.\n\nIf you're heading to Ibiza before the season ends, check this to see how to have the perfect 24 hours on the island."
