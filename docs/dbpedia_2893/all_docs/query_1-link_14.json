        "text": "The historical remains of Ibizaâ€™s superclub Privilege, once known as one of the largest nightclubs in the world as titled by the Guinness World Records, is officially coming down. Photos of the deconstruction of the famous nightclub have begun to surface, when only months earlier the venue received over 8.2m euros for renovations. We suspect that a new structure will be built in its place using those funds.\n\nKnown for hosting events that filled its floors with over 10,000 ravers and club-goers alike, the once prestigious nightclub began on a downhill course after an unfortunate closure in 2018. Due to an inspection that uncovered illegal capacity increasing modifications, the club was forced to shut its doors.\n\nA year later, Privilege Ibiza made its return, although various sections of the venue remained closed off due to conditions that were deemed unsafe. However, when the pandemic set its grasp on the world in 2020, the club once again shut its doors, leading to its ultimate demise."
