        "text": "Tomorrowland is heading to Thailand in 2026, according to local news sources in Thailand.\n\nA representative from the Thai government has confirmed that the iconic music festival Tomorrowland will head to Bangkok in 2026 for what is likely to be a ten-year run. This will make EDM history, as Thailand will be the first ASEAN nation to host the world-renowned event.\n\nIn a press conference last week, government spokesperson Chai Wacharonke said the move was prompted by Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin’s frequent claims that the country’s economy is in a “crisis.”\n\nThavisin, who assumed office in September, has identified steps like tourist visa exemptions as “quick wins” to revive Thailand’s economy. Thailand has recently promoted advertising programs to increase the time tourists spend in the country, in addition to holding festivals throughout the year to attract more international visitors.\n\nThe country’s average economic growth rate over the last decade has been less than 2 percent, whereas the standard in the area has been 4 percent, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAlong with Tomorrowland, Thailand’s government has also announced that Japan’s Sonic Summer music festival will come to Bangkok this August, marking the event’s only second-ever appearance outside of Japan. Sonic Summer Bangkok 2024 will be held at Impact Muang Thong Thani in the country’s Nonthaburi province on August 24 and 25.\n\nWacharonke added that Prime Minister Thavisin has also discussed hosting events from global entities such as Formula One Group, Formula E, and Art Basel.\n\nTomorrowland has not yet officially announced its plans to hold the festival in Thailand. However, the move will follow a precedent set in previous spin-off events such as Tomorrowland Winter, Tomorrowland Brazil, and TomorrowWorld—the brand’s U.S.-based event last held in Georgia in 2015.\n\nUpdate 2:30PM, March 28\n\nThough it is still possible that Tomorrowland could expand to Thailand, the festival has released a statement sharing that their plans are not yet final.\n\n“In December the Tomorrowland team had the privilege of engaging in discussions with various parties and exploring potential locations for a Tomorrowland festival in Thailand,” a Tomorrowland spokesperson told EDM.com. “Deeply touched by the warm support, we must clarify the recent speculation: nothing has been officially confirmed or signed at this time.\n\n“The Tomorrowland team is diligently conducting thorough research and exploration to assess the feasibility of hosting Tomorrowland in Thailand,” they continued. “There is still much to be investigated.”"
