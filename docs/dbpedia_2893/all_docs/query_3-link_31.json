        "text": "What could be better than dancing on a sleek and shiny catamaran or an enormous superyacht to great tunes as the waves lap around you and the sun blazes overhead? Add in a pitcher (or two) of fruit-filled sangria or a bottle of Champagne, and it’s hard to beat.\n\nPlus, some boat trips allow you to explore more of the beautiful island as you sail the glistening Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThere are a few commercial boat parties hosted regularly in Ibiza but keep an eye out for smaller companies. You can also grab your nearest and dearest and host your own if you’d prefer a private party.\n\nHitting one of Ibiza’s famous beach clubs for a pool party is a must-do when visiting the White Isle. Parties range from glam to chilled, and some of the best can be found at the likes of Ushuaïa, Ocean Beach, Ibiza Rocks and Nikki Beach.\n\nDepending on where you go, expect the likes of world-class DJs, Champagne-filled super soakers and fun, vivid floaties to make your Ibiza pool party one to tick off the bucket list.\n\nOf course, no visit to Ibiza is complete without a night of revelry at one of the island’s mega clubs.\n\nThe very thought of Ibiza and most people can imagine a swarm of people bopping in a trance while a famous DJ spins some well-recognised house tunes. The good news is that Ibiza isn’t far from this image.\n\nThis Balearic island is home to some of the most exciting clubs in the world, and there’s plenty of choices when it comes to styles, events, and music choices.\n\nThe iconic Pacha Ibiza claims to be the most Ibicenco club on the island, proud to have a hippie soul and combing heritage, glamour and excellent music.\n\nAnother top contender for Ibiza’s best mega clubs is Amnesia, a giant disco hosting some of the most popular DJs in the world. The likes of Sven Väth, Carl Cox, Paul Van Dyk, Tiësto and Paul Oakenfold have all hit the decks at Amnesia in the past.\n\nPrivilege is another must-visit venue, renowned as the biggest club in the world. It’s hosted DJs including Charlotte De Witte, John Digweed, Joseph Capriati, and Adam Beyer.\n\nSometimes it’s fun to share a dance party with a handful of your favourite people. For a more private affair, why not host a villa party on your Ibiza trip?\n\nIt’s pretty easy to start an Ibiza villa party. All you need is a great group of people, a pool, and plenty of space to dance. Everything else you can find on the island.\n\nRent a sound system from Digital Ibiza and they’ll even come to set it up for you any time of the day or night. If you don’t have a friend who’s talented on the decks, you can book a DJ too. If you want to go all out, you can even hire your own cocktail barman to craft some delicious drinks.\n\nThere are plenty of beautiful luxury villas and resorts all over Ibiza Island for you to relax and rest up in between all the partying.\n\nApproximately 20 minutes away from the island's bustling San Antonio party area is the lavish 7Pines Resort Ibiza. The resort sits in a pine grove on the cliffs of the west coast of Ibiza between Cala Conta and Cala Codolar.\n\nWith panoramic, unobstructed views of the sparkling Mediterranean Sea and the magical, iconic island of Es Vedra, 7Pines offers a prime vantage point to watch the sun melt into the horizon each evening.\n\nThe resort features 185 suites, four bars, three restaurants, a spa and wellness centre and three Pershing Yachts available to charter to make your trip as memorable as possible.\n\nBook your stay at the 7Pines Resort here."
