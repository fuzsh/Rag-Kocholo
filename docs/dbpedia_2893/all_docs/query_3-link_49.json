I am currently in the process of a grand life transition = expansion and actively working on bringing this soul-calling come to life; as over the second half of my 12 years as a certified Personal Wellness Chef, I have been feeling the call to offer support to others in a deeper way, as a Wellness, Vibrancy & Soul Coach offering personalized wellness guidance and at the same time offering a hub of one of a kind wellness based experiences and offerings for clients to experience. I created Whole Sacred Wellness, which offers space for nurturing our body, mind and soul in various ways. Solo Retreats, Weekend Getaways, and Day Experiences for clients needing some Body, Mind & Soul Nourishment at one of a kind, Exclusive Resorts, Hotels and Retreat Centers is what our packages will feature, as well as self-nurturing experiences and deals like Juice Cleanses, Programs and other offerings geared towards Heart, Mind & Soul healing, overall bringing the gift of balanced, optimal wellness. My intention is to grow my network of special gems around the world, which I have found to be as truly nurturing places that feel truly nourishing to the body and soul, allowing others to experience the best places for self-care. As well as supporting Wellness based partners with their special offer and connecting them with our clients. It would be absolutely wonderful to be able to feature your special wellness-based offering on https://lnkd.in/dZYbjji and on various growing media platforms. If you feel that your Sanctuary, Retreat, Program, Service or Product is of alignment, let's connect and discuss your one of a kind package you'd like to offer at a special price available only through Whole Sacred Wellness. It would be a promotion advertised on all of our growing media pages (website, Facebook and Instagram pages), starting with a simple agreement of an affiliate commission of % for every package sold through our website. We could also discuss collaboration on your retreats. At the same time I would absolutely join an established company that does this, has all components already in place, and would like extra value added from someone with much passion, ideas, collaborative and growth mindset and having me add my own one of a kind ideas for packages to create with my favorite, one of a kind places. If this is something you would like to explore, I would very much look forward to hearing from you! Warmly, Jessica Bella Lewkovitz Personal Wellness Chef, Vibrancy Coach, Wellness Travel Advisor & Aquatic Bodyworker https://lnkd.in/dxicDGK .917-497-6554.\n\nIn just under two weeks’ time we will be hosting our first-ever 5-day wellness retreat in the beautiful Ibiza! This unique experience is something we have crafted for members who are looking to deepen their wellness journey in a luxurious and invigorating setting. Why a high-ticket luxury retreat? Over the years I’ve found that offering exclusive, high-quality experiences helps keep our long-term members engaged and adds an extra layer of excitement to our core offerings. It’s about creating memorable, transformative experiences that resonate deeply with our clients' personal and wellness goals. Here are some key benefits we aim to provide through our Ibiza retreat: 1.⁠ ⁠Personalised Wellness: Tailored wellness activities that cater to individual needs, promoting personal growth and health. 2.⁠ ⁠Exclusivity and Privacy: The serene and private setting in Ibiza offers a perfect backdrop for relaxation and rejuvenation, away from the daily grind. 3.⁠ ⁠Community Building: Shared experiences in a luxurious setting foster stronger connections among members, enhancing the sense of community within our studio. For other businesses considering similar high-ticket offers, I have a couple of tips: 1.⁠ ⁠Understand Your Audience: Ensure the experience aligns with the interests and lifestyles of your members. Luxury isn't just about splendour, it's about providing value that resonates. 2.⁠ ⁠Focus on Quality Over Quantity: When it comes to high-ticket items, the quality of the experience should always surpass the quantity of offerings. Every detail matters, from the setting to the activities and the overall ambiance. I am excited to bring this new experience to our members and look forward to an unforgettable retreat that promises not just relaxation, but a rejuvenation of body, mind, and spirit. And if you’ve already ventured into creating high-ticket experiences, I’d love to hear how they’ve impacted your engagement and member satisfaction! #WellnessRetreat #LuxuryExperience #CommunityBuilding ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------U Fit Studio – your ultimate destination for a transformative fitness journey, where personalised training, energising group workouts, and calming yoga and Pilates sessions blend seamlessly.

They tend to use an integrated approach, focusing on overall health and self-care, offering many activities and experiences to contribute to your overall health and wellness. These activities and experiences can be anything – it depends on the person in question, the wellness vacation they embark on, and the destination of their choice. But some of the most common offerings include yoga, meditation, spa treatments, nutritious meals, fitness programs, mindfulness, and other outdoor activities. The goal of wellness tourism is to help you relax, unwind, and center yourself, reducing stress and restoring balance to your life – and this can mean different things for different people. But recently, there’s been a noticeable increase in the popularity of wellness vacations, and wellness tourism industries worldwide have experienced a boom over the last few years. But why are wellness vacations becoming so popular? We’re going to explore all the reasons that wellness tourism is flourishing. Fast-Paced, 21st-Century Life 21st-century life is stressful. That’s not to say that life before that was carefree or that people had nothing going on. However, daily life has become far busier and fast-paced – as the world and technology have progressed, so have the expectations for people’s productivity. There’s just far more pressure on people to do more and do it well. Unsurprisingly, this is incredibly stressful. The idea of “the hustle” and the need to always be “on the grind” is part of life, leaving little room for self-care. Thus, it’s no surprise that people have started seeking relaxation and a way to restore balance in their lives. Reconnecting with Nature When most people think of wellness vacations, we think of nature. Whether you’re staying in a remote spot somewhere in the middle of nowhere for some peace, or they offer outdoor-oriented activities and experiences. For many people, the opportunity to reconnect with nature exists in stark contrast to their daily lives, especially if they live in a city or work an office job. Indeed, people tend to seek wellness vacations that can help them enjoy nature to separate themselves from their stressful environment. Digital Detox Cell phones, social media, and constant communication have become regular parts of our daily lives, but it can be incredibly exhausting. In your everyday environment, stepping away from cell phones, computers, and the internet can be challenging, especially when working. Going away to a wellness retreat is the perfect opportunity to do just that. For some people, a digital detox enables energy, so wellness vacations are becoming more popular.
