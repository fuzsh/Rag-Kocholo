        "text": "Privilege Ibiza made the smart decision to employ the Clair Brothers C12 loudspeaker system, and some more Clair Brothers gear to cover the entire venue. As the largest nightclub putting on a special season-end event, its magnitude is difficult to ignore.\n\nThis mammoth club can host up to 10,000 guests at one time.\n\nOpen since 1993 on the Spanish island of Ibiza, this gigantic venue welcomes litterally hundreds of thousands guest over the season, each invited to be themselves and express themselves as they want.\n\nPossessing a staff two-hundred strong, a ceiling height of twenty-five meters, a dance floor for days, an impressive live stage, large windows and a glass dome for an observatory view of the stars at night, three floors, several terraces, plus a huge swimming pool with a DJ booth above it, this unforgettable club leaves nothing to chance.\n\nThe fact that this is the largest club in the world allows management to redesign the venue for individual parties and artistic shows. For this event, they didn’t hold back, calling on Clair Brothers’ Spanish distribution and rental partner, VTècnics, to recommend and design a sound system worthy of this special occasion.\n\nInternational team effort of collaboration\n\nJosep Maria Serra, production manager at VTècnics provides some back story: “The Clair Brothers team understands the concept and value of global sharing between its partners.\n\nOn this occasion four companies in southern Europe shared their equipment and knowledge which allowed us to achieve the best sound possible.\n\nMy company, VTècnics, worked with other Clair Brothers partners Grupo Friends, also from Spain, Audio Concept from France, and Prase Media Technologies from Italy. It’s a total team effort of collaboration and pitching in together!”\n\nThe downside of the venue\n\nA downside of being such a massive venue with the ornate design features, such as glass and metallic surfaces all around, the acoustics present a real challenge to finding a strong, yet balanced sound throughout.\n\nSerra points out, “The venue does not have good acoustics because it has so many reflective surface elements. And the floor has a giant swimming pool with a cover on it, which unfortunately works as a big resonance box.\n\nWe needed to create a sound system that was strong on clarity, with powerful subs, that would be easy to control. The Clair Brothers C12s and iS218s more than delivered.”\n\nAn additional challenge for setting up the sound system was the presence of a monstrous lighting system.\n\n“We had fixed anchor points to hang the C12s,” explains Serra. “It was impossible to scroll the anchors in any direction because within the structure was a twenty-ton pro-lighting rig.\n\nIt was essential to respect those loading points.”\n\nThe final sound system\n\nThe final, exclusively Clair Brothers, sound system designed for the big event consisted of twenty-four C12s, twenty-four iS218s and eight FF2s for the main stage.\n\nThey also supplied eight i212s and two iS218s in an additional hall; twelve i212s and four iS218s in VIP Zones 1 & 2; four kiTCurve12s, two kiTSubs and four C12s in VIP Zone 3; two C12s and four iS218s for the DJ set monitor; and all amplifiers were CB-PLM12K44s and CB-PLM20K44s.\n\nThe VTècnics production team that expertly pulled off the evening were sound designer, Francesc Güell; system engineer.\n\nOther members of the team were Narcis Solé; sound assistant, Juan Carlos Álvarez; and monitor engineer, Konstantinos Ftoulis.\n\n“It was a super fun night for all of us and the sound was great,” concludes Serra.\n\n“One promoter in attendance went so far as to say that this is the best sound he’s heard on the island of Ibiza in thirty years. Thanks, Clair Brothers!”\n\nMore on Clair Brothers ranges"
