        "text": "An image of the the iconic ‘Space Ibiza’ logo on the giant screen of the Hard Rock Hotel in Playa den Bossa with the words ‘coming soon’ has sent the White Isle and clubland into overdrive.\n\nThe Matutes group of companies (Usuhaïa, Hard Rock Hotel and Hī) and Space owner Pepe Rosello are sworn enemies so does this mean they have kissed and made up? Seemingly not, it looks like the situation just became even more complicated.\n\nFor now the Matutes group are staying silent but with this new turn of events can we assume they have decided to relaunch the iconic brand? This leads us to the big question: Who actually owns the trademark to the world famous Space brand? Is it 85 year old Pepe Rosello, the founder of Space, or is it the Matutes company who acted as his landlord for over 20 years in a complicated profit share deal?\n\nThe previously cordial relationship soured dramatically after Space’s lease wasn’t renewed in 2016 leading to the opening of Hī, a brand new multi million euro super club in the heart of Playa den Bossa. It made perfect business sense that the Matutes Group took back control of the area with a brand new concept that created a ‘golden triangle’ but Rosello didn’t go quietly with accusations fired by both sides leading to court papers being served alleging fraud by Rosello and slander by the Matutes group.\n\nThe Space brand as a clubbing concept has been dormant since Carl Cox played the final track stood next to Pepe Rosello in an emotional 2016 farewell but it was recently disclosed that ‘Space on Sunday’ could return in 2022 with Cox back as the front man at a new venue that was later revealed to be Es Paradis in San Antonio.\n\nHowever with this new dramatic giant screen twist it looks like the Matutes group has laid down a clear marker that they, in fact, own the Space trademark and speculation is now rife to where they might take the iconic brand with all eyes turned to Privilege in San Rafael.\n\nTo add greater confusion to proceedings the Matutes group are currently embroiled in their own protracted court case about the ownership of Privilege. The group already owns 45% of the ‘worlds biggest nightclub’ and a Balearic court has judged that they can purchase the remaining 55% at a price set by an independent auditor. This ruling has been challenged by the existing owners who think they might have to sell on the cheap but the group are confident that the judgment will be ratified by the Supreme Court very soon.\n\nSo many questions still remain. Who owns the Space brand? Will ‘Space on Sunday’ return in 2022? If so will it be in Es Paradis? Will Carl Cox keep his promise to only work with Pepe Rosello or will a potential Space/Privilege hook up by the Matutes group be too tasty to turn down? Will Space even go to Privilege and in what form? Will the Rosello v Matutes feud be resolved any time soon?\n\nThere’s plenty more legs in this story. Ibiza – always interesting, never dull."
