        "text": "There is nothing quite like a night out in Ibiza. The energy is electric, with the ocean waves rolling in, sunset over the mountains and beautiful people dancing and having a good time. From Ibiza Town to the Bay of San Antonio, there are TONS of parties to choose from, and finding the best clubs in Ibiza for your group can be tough. I’ve put together a guide of all the best clubs on the island you don’t want to miss below, along with a map to help you plan.\n\nClubs In Ibiza Guide’s Map\n\nFirst Things First – Budget Friendly Clubs & Tickets In Ibiza\n\nBefore I go into all of the best clubs in Ibiza to choose from, I’ll quickly say that Ibiza is an expensive place and a lot of the clubs can get pricy fast between the entry ticket and drink cost. If you’re on a budget, here are the best tips for how to save money in Ibiza:\n\nVisit the most budget-friendly clubs: Es Paradis, Pikes (free entry with guest-list sign up), Akaska, Eden, any of the small clubs listed in the blog below and the Ibiza Rocks & O Beach pool parties\n\nAttend an Ibiza boat party, which often comes with free entry to a club that night\n\nPurchase tickets in advance and stick with your plans. Door tickets will be more expensive\n\nSnag early entry tickets, which have you come early to the club for a discounted price\n\nGo to Ibiza club nights where lesser-known parties and DJs are playing. You can check the Ibiza Party Calendar by Ibiza Spotlight to see a comparison of all the entry prices for each night at each club\n\nBest Clubs In Ibiza : Ibiza Town & Playa d’en Bossa\n\nHi Ibiza\n\nCrowds: Intense\n\nPrices: As high as it gets\n\nHI Ibiza is known as one of the best, if not THE best nightclub in the world because of its fantastic sound and light system, and for the world-class DJ shows that are performed here. Another highlight is that the main room is transformed for each show, so that you’ll get a new experience every time you visit. Big names and shows that you can find here are David Guetta, Black Coffee and Afterlife by Tale of Us.\n\nLocated at the Ushuaia Hotel, you’ve probably seen a video from this place on TikTok or Instagram because of the mindblowing visuals. Here you’ll tend to hear tech house and Ibiza classics, with exception to the Glitterbox party which is some of the best played disco in Ibiza.\n\nKeep in mind this venue gets extremely crowded, so if you’re visiting during the high season and are nervous about the crowds, either 1.) show up right when they open and make sure you’re okay with the idea of leaving early if you need to or 2.) other option would be to show up late, around 3:00am, but there’s no guarantee at that time you will get in.\n\nBecause of how crowded this club gets, the VIP areas which gives you access to separate bathrooms and entrance lines is for sure worth it if you can afford it. Keep in mind the VIP tables at Ibiza are VERY expensive and you would need a pretty big group for these tables.\n\nSomething else to note – there are three spaces in this club to check out, including the Wild Corner which is a bathroom space where you can find up and coming DJs playing under a multi-colored light up ceiling. So fun!!!\n\nUshuaïa Ibiza\n\nCrowds: Intense\n\nPrices: Very high\n\nUshuaia Ibiza is THE venue where you’ll find the world’s leading DJs lining up each night of the week with residencies from artists like David Guetta, Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike and Calvin Harris, along with Defected, the Ibiza classic, and many more.\n\nUshuaia is by far the biggest day party in Ibiza but I do think of shows here as more like an early night time show, since although it is a pool party venue, no one is allowed in the pool and the show usually goes until around midnight.\n\nKeep in mind that you should only come to Ushuaia if you don’t mind crowds or think it’s worth it for the artist you’re seeing! I’ve been fortunate enough to see most of the artists that are featured at Ushuaia before as someone who has been to lots of electronic music festivals, so we opted to skip this venue. If I hadn’t had similar experiences before I would 100% be in to experience this. The world-class artists, lights, fog and smoke, fireworks, lasers and amazing sound system combine for an unforgettable experience.\n\nPacha Ibiza\n\nCrowds: Intense\n\nPrices: Very high\n\nPacha is THE original club in Ibiza and not to be missed. You’ve probably seen the iconic cherry logo of this worldwide brand before! Top shows / parties like Flower Power, Solomun+1 and Music On, along with the top notch electronic music and lighting system make this one of the best clubs in Ibiza. You can’t leave Ibiza without having at least one night on the dance floor at Pacha.\n\nThe Pacha Ibiza VIP areas and table experience is one of the best on the island, so if you can afford it consider splurging here for an iconic night in Ibiza!\n\nDC10\n\nCrowds: Intense\n\nPrices: Low\n\nAnother Ibiza classic, DC10 is known for its incredible music hands down. If you’re a music lover as opposed to someone who just loves partying, you have to put DC10 at the top of your list for venues to visit in Ibiza.\n\nWhen the garden closes around 11:00pm it can get insanely crowded, since everyone funnels indoors. If you don’t like crowds, plan to leave once the garden closes and head elsewhere, which is no problem and really the peak time to head to the other clubs in Ibiza anyways!\n\nLio Ibiza\n\nCrowds: Light\n\nPrices: As high as it gets\n\nLio Ibiza is a smaller, upscale club in Ibiza which has a show and dinner to start the night, which then turns into a typical club night with DJs and dancing. If you want to join for dinner and the show, the minimum spend including dinner is €250 per person, so while it isn’t cheap it does feel like an exclusive Ibiza VIP experience. Club entry only can be purchased for a more normal price once dinner and the show is over.\n\nThis makes it a great place for people who bored of the typical nightlife, for couples and groups, and for anyone looking for something different in Ibiza which feels more elite. The dress code is dressier than other clubs understandably, which is another reason that Lio feels classy and upscale. You can expect the shows to include a mix of cabaret and acrobatic, circus-like stunts.\n\nPlaya Soleil\n\nCrowds: Moderate\n\nPrices: Very high\n\nPlaya Soleil is the newest beach club in Bossa. Many days of the week Playa Soleil is your average beach club which is mainly a daytime venue, but several nights a week there are club nights including Lee’s Burridge’s All Day I Dream on Mondays. Come here for a more calm atmosphere compared to the mega clubs but still with a great sized crowd and energy. There are multiple spaces to hangout and some nights there are multiple DJs. This is the place to let loose and feel great doing it!\n\nDestino by Pacha\n\nCrowds: Intense\n\nPrices: As high as it gets\n\nDestino is Patcha’s pool venue turns into more of an outdoor venue on Thursdays during high season for the legendary Music On party. During the day it is your typical tame beach club (technically just a sprawling pool) where you can spend a low-key day in the sun with music and drinks.\n\nBars & Smaller Clubs In Ibiza Town\n\nWhile the mega clubs and most popular venues are often the highlights of the island, it’s very possible that your best night in Ibiza could be at a smaller, more intimate and random club on the island where you’ll save money and have a blast without getting squished. I’ve put together a list of some you could check out, but keep in mind that you should keep an eye out for parties that sound like fun while you’re out and about.\n\nBALOO Ibiza\n\nCrowds: Low\n\nPrices: Low\n\nBALOO Ibiza is a new little club on the island, with a terrace and late night venue called the Magic Room where you’ll find tropical jungle decor and the atmosphere to match. Latin, pop and reggaeton are the main type of music played here except for two nights a week where they play House Music, typically during their Sunnun and Magic Thursday events. You can sign up for the guest list at their website for free entry!\n\nClub Chinois\n\nCrowds: Low\n\nPrices: Moderate\n\nClub Chinois is a high-class intimate venue where you’ll find DJs performing their first residencies out of an out-of-this-world sound system. The club has a sort of asian cabernet vibe, and although it’s smaller when it comes to the best clubs in Ibiza, it is a great place to spend your night.\n\nParadise Lost\n\nCrowds: Low\n\nPrices: Low\n\nParadise Lost is a special kind of tiki bar and a hidden gem in Ibiza town, where the focus is on amazing rum-based drinks and an always-fun atmosphere where everyone is welcomed. If you have trouble finding it, try the last door on the left. 😉\n\nSWAG Ibiza\n\nCrowds: Low\n\nPrices: Moderate\n\nSWAG Ibiza is for those that are tired of the same electronic music. Come here for all things black music – think hip hop and reggaeton, with bass heavy rhythms and some techno mixed in. You’re guaranteed to be dancing by the time you leave!\n\nBest Clubs In Ibiza In Sant Antoni de Portmany (San Antonio)\n\nMost of the biggest clubs on the island are near the Ibiza Town side of the island, but the Bay of San Antonio has a few gems along with the best pool clubs & parties.\n\nEs Paradis\n\nCrowds: Low\n\nPrices: Moderate\n\nEs Paradis calls itself “the most beautiful club in the world” and they mean it! It’s one of the oldest clubs in Ibiza and inside you’ll find roman-like columns, vines, mural walls, multiple floors and a glass roof. Because they don’t book the biggest name DJs here, both entry and drink prices are very reasonable and you’re guaranteed to have a good time at their various themed parties.\n\nEs Paradis is also home to one of the best Ibiza club nights which is the Fiesta Del Agua water party night, where part of the dance floor becomes a pool after water fountains start streaming down from the ceiling, so you can dance under the water, have fun and let loose Ibiza style. The Fiesta Del Agua party happens every Saturday night during the summer season! If this is your first time in Ibiza don’t miss this one.\n\nEden Ibiza\n\nCrowds: Moderate\n\nPrices: Moderate\n\nEden is an Ibiza establishment and one of two of the major clubs in the San Antonio area. It’s not nearly as popular as the other major clubs near the Ibiza Town, but that can be a great thing! The sunken stage, fantastic sound system and expertise in Ibiza nights make for an amazing night. Each night has a difference theme in the summer season, like NOSPACE for feel good house, which is the iconic SPACE club in show form, or Peaches for hip hop. Make sure to check their website to see the full line up.\n\nPikes\n\nCrowds: Low\n\nPrices: Low\n\nPikes is another very unique place to party on the island, mainly because of its history in rock n’ roll, and is home to Freddies – one of the most intimate and best clubs in Ibiza. Pikes is an iconic party house near the port of San Antonio where Queen hosted some of the biggest parties of the century back in the 1980’s. Best part? It’s free!!!\n\nFreddies is the main “club” at Pikes, although it’s small and intimate, so very different than other clubs in Ibiza. My personal favorite part about Pikes is that there are different rooms and spaces to explore around the house and grounds, which are usually open on different nights. Hint: There’s a bath tub ball pit involved.\n\nYou can also stay at the Pikes mansion, or get a pre-party dinner here enjoying the beautiful patio and sunset before partying. Make sure to check out their weekly House Party Saturdays, where all of the spaces in the mansion are open with multiple DJs, and the infamous Sunday Brunch.\n\nThe crowd is usually older here and they have a non-strict policy of it being a 27+ venue.\n\nO Beach Ibiza\n\nCrowds: High\n\nPrices: High\n\nNot your average club in Ibiza – O Beach is one of the most popular Ibiza pool parties, formally Ocean Beach Club, and it’s known for crazy displays, acrobatics, floats, confetti and everything else wild you can imagine at a pool venue. Think over the top and sort of like a show, making it great for groups and special events, or even couples who get bored at the average pool party.\n\nSince this is a day party, head here in the afternoon/evening and the party will go until about sunset, preceding a nap before doing it all over again?! A few days that are big here are Kisstory on Tuesdays and Cinomatic in partnership with Shein on Fridays during the summer season.\n\nWhile there are some people who claim it won’t be fun without a table, there are also people who say you can find a table in the eating area if you need one and if not you can sit on the edge of the pool, hang out in the pool or on the dance floor. So either way you should have a blast! They do have lockers for a low cost to rent, so no need to get a table just to have somewhere to put your things.\n\nIbiza Rocks\n\nCrowds: Moderate\n\nPrices: Moderate\n\nIbiza Rocks is the most relaxed and classic Ibiza pool party venue, and you haven’t been to Ibiza until you’ve attended an Ibiza Rocks party! Come here to let loose, jump around in the pool, meet fellow travelers and listen to some of the best electronic music acts on the island.\n\nMost days are fun at Ibiza Rocks, but some of their weekly biggest and best parties are Ben Hensley on Sundays and the Craig David TS5 party on Tuesdays. You can either reserve a table, pool bed, or just do general admission where you’ll have plenty of space to hangout. Ibiza Rocks also has locker rentals so you don’t need to worry about your stuff.\n\nBars & Smaller Clubs In Ibiza In San Antonio\n\nCafe Mambo Ibiza\n\nCrowds: Low\n\nPrices: Low\n\nLocated right on the San Antonio sunset strip, Cafe Mambo is a mostly outdoor space is the spot for pre-party drinks on the west side of Ibiza, with headlining DJs dropping by sporadically for mini shows where you can get right up close to the action. The water and sunset view, intimacy and also delicious food and drinks make Cafe Mambo an Ibiza staple.\n\nIbiza Rocks Bar\n\nCrowds: Low\n\nPrices: Low\n\nNot to be confused with the Ibiza Rocks pool party and club at the Ibiza Rocks Hotel, there’s also an Ibiza Rocks bar by the same people along the Playa de Sant Antoni which is really popular with locals for its small but fun crowds, great music, views and of course great and decently priced drinks. They also serve dinner here, making it a great place to have pregame drinks.\n\nBest Clubs in Ibiza : The Rest of the Island\n\nAmnesia\n\nCrowds: Intense\n\nPrices: High\n\nAmnesia Ibiza is definitely one of the most legendary clubs in Ibiza. You know it’s good when it’s still getting filled to the brim while it’s placed in the middle of the island near nothing else. This one is so massive, that you can go expecting huge crowds and communal moments of electric energy with everyone’s hands in the air.\n\nThat being said, if you don’t like crowds consider getting VIP, where unlike at other clubs actually gives you a great view above the crowds.\n\nAmnesia has two spaces, one is the main room which is more of a classic club experience while the terrace is a space with a glass roof where the sun starts streaming through during the sunrise as the club goers are keeping the party going with a new sort of energy!\n\nOne of their most famous parties are the weekly Elrow parties that are carnivalesque where absolute chaos ensues (in a good way) with streamers, floats, balloons, people on stilts, dancers and more everywhere you look. Pyramid and Paradise are two of the others.\n\nCova Santa\n\nCrowds: Moderate\n\nPrices: High\n\nCova Santa was previously known for cave parties until restrictions were placed on the cave itself, but that didn’t stop the party. Now Cova Santa is one of the best outdoor clubs in Ibiza, where you’ll find a festival-like atmosphere, art and performances, more of a no-phone atmosphere and lots of happy people! The relatively remote location is well worth the journey.\n\nYou can also dine at Cova Santa, with views of the music and stage. This is the perfect option for people who don’t want quite as much of a party but still want to be around the action, or for a pre-party dinner which is more of an Ibiza VIP experience.\n\nChildren are also allowed at Cova Santa as of our most recent visit, which makes this club a great experience for families although there aren’t any kid-specific activities included here. The outdoor, festival-like party goes until about 11:00, when the party turns into a more traditional 18+ club in Ibiza.\n\nWoomoon is one of their most popular events, which has been happening on Ibiza for a while now and which takes place each Sunday night in the summer season, but they have a rotating number of events which are all exceptional!\n\nAkasha at Las Dalias\n\nCrowds: Low\n\nPrices: Low\n\nLas Dalias is a completely unique and cherished hippy market Ibiza and club experience which has a Burning Man like atmosphere and is currently celebrating their 70-year anniversary. Akasha is their new indoor club, which has events several days a week.\n\nAkaska is known for being an intimate venue where real music lovers go to share their passion and connect with people and art in the moment. The DJ booth is right in the middle of the room where colorful projections are reflected on the wall and the energy is electric.\n\nLas Dalias and Akaska’s biggest night is Sunday, when they have the night market and Nido playing, which precedes a night of dancing at Akaska.\n\nSmaller Clubs\n\nIbiza Underground\n\nCrowds: Moderate\n\nPrices: Low\n\nKnown for being a local favorite spot with real underground electronic music in an authentic setting, Underground is a must-see for music lovers visiting the island. It’s open several days a week and you can find who’s playing at the Ibiza Underground Instagram page.\n\nCLOSED: The Ibiza Underground club has recently been shut down by police for an unknown reason and we don’t know when it will open back up. I’m holding off on putting this under the Closed Clubs section, hoping it will open back up! You can find out more about the current status on the IG page linked to above.\n\nClubs In Ibiza On the Water : The Ibiza Boat Party\n\nWhile not technically a club, the Ibiza boat party is one option of things to do on the island and basically a floating day club. These boat parties depart from either Playa D’en Bossa or San Antonio area daily, and while there are tons of boat excursions, only a few actually have a club-like atmosphere. Before signing up for a boat make sure they specify that it will be a party atmosphere, along with usually unlimited drinks.\n\nAfter Sun by Ibiza Boat Club is always a party, which is a sunset cruise with a DJ, lots of dancing, unlimited drinks and even a swim stop with slides off the boat. Oceanbeat is the version which takes off earlier in the day, with the infamous champagne showers and typically going from 2:00-5:00pm.\n\nBest Clubs In Ibiza Which Have Closed\n\nPrivilege Ibiza\n\nIn case you are new to Ibiza and hear about Privilege, this absolutely massive club in the middle of the island is now closed and undergoing renovations, which are rumored to be moving toward completion by the next summer season. You can stay up to date by visiting the Privilege Ibiza Instagram page and checking the comments on the latest post."
