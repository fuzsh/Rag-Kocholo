        "text": "The on-trend spot in Ibiza Town\n\nLocated in the heart of Ibiza Town on Paseo Vara de Rey, the transformation of this historic Grand Dame hotel into a playful bolthole by the Experimental Group is part of the recent ‘glow-up’ of this part of town. Originally opened in the 1930s, it was the island’s first proper hotel and much-loved hang-out for locals. Its second life as a Hilton divided opinions and its third incarnation as the Montesol Experimental is a case of “third time’s the charm”. Sitting pretty with its iconic limoncello neo-colonial façade, the interior is like a grown-up’s doll house, decorated in pastel hues, whimsical furniture and a collage of patterns, fringes, statement pompoms and colourful rugs. In the wrong hands, this playful aesthetic would simply be a hashtag, but here, everything is cleverly counterbalanced with classic details like parquet flooring, white walls, light wood and white linens. The rooms – all vary in size and views – have all the creature comforts of a smart hotel with king size beds, espresso machines, fluffy robes and large rain showers. It draws a crowd of trendy city-breakers, keen to explore the shops, bars and cobblestones of Ibiza Town and avoid the bug-eyed party dwellers. Come sunset, they’ll be sipping mezcal margaritas on the hard-to-beat rooftop, which, even with a glossy cardinal-red floor, is a minimal space compared to the rest of the hotel, and offers uninterrupted views of the town, castle and sea. Chloe Sachdev\n\nPrice: from about £127 per night\n\nAddress: Passeig de Vara de Rey, 2, 07800 Eivissa, Illes Balears, Spain\n\nA boutique hideaway\n\nTen minutes from cool Santa Gertrudis, Can Sastre describes itself as an agroturismo. While there isn’t much sign of farm life, this five-room hotel feels like you’re stepping into the home of owner Bibi and her husband Ray. Their beautiful blonde children dash about (silently) underfoot in towel capes while their parents will ask after your night out or help with supper reservations but otherwise leave you completely unhassled. The Dutch couple bought and revamped the space in the summer of 2018 and the white finca exteriors are draped in bougainvillaea with hammocks slung in shady corners. In the bedrooms, things are simple, with whitewashed walls and wicker baskets alongside palm-fringed lampshades. There are organic Meraki lotions from Denmark in the bathroom, which you can also buy to take home from the hotel boutique.\n\nAt sundown, help yourself to an enormous glass of blush rosé at the poolside honesty bar and order the just-cooked edamame doused in salt. For breakfast, there are scooped-out wooden bowls of cool acai topped with candied fruit and nuts and beetroot juice for sipping with a bamboo straw. Ask ahead, and platters of fresh bread, Iberico ham and manchego cheese can be arranged for lunch. Things here feel homespun and instantly relaxing – it’s as good a spot to hide entirely from the rest of the island as it is a launchpad from which to explore Ibiza’s farm-to-table restaurants, beach clubs or mega-club scene. By Tabitha Joyce\n\nPrice: from about £240 per night\n\nAddress: Camí Vell de Sant Mateu, s/n, 07816 San Rafael, Ibiza, Illes Balears, Spain\n\nThe shore-side showstopper\n\nSince Nobu Ibiza Bay opened, with a buzzy beachside locale that put lo-fi Talamanca on the map and a much-hyped Nobu restaurant christened by Robert de Niro himself, the hotel has shuffled around, re-rooted itself a couple of times and finally settled into a rhythm that looks and feels just right. Yes, it’s glossy and yes, it’s on the not-quite-gentrified sands of Talamanca, arguably Ibiza Town’s last locals’ beach. But instead of being a bastion of other-ness, Nobu has integrated in a way that feels as organic as can be for a global super brand. Staff – arguably the best on the island – know guests by name; the deeply cocooning lobby bar buzzes in the thrilling way that hotel lobbies used to, with island residents who’ve dropped in for meetings, coffee or a sneaky Kloris CBD treatment at the newly opened Six Senses spa. The newly opened late-night Nobu Lounge is low-lit and discreet, with a select Nobu sushi menu and a speakeasy, members’ club vibe.\n\nBedrooms are airy and capacious, with subtly bohemian décor in blues and creams that complements the jaw-dropping sea (and sunrise) views of the craggy Illa Grossa peninsula and the headland of Cap Martinet, from where fishing boats cast off at first light. A snaking boardwalk loops and curves across the sands, packed with early-morning joggers who strip off for skinny dips in any one of the hidden sandy coves. Back on the pool deck, well-behaved children disappear into the kids’ club for pirate and princess parties while grown-ups sip fresh watermelon juice, nibble on bento boxes and dip their toes into the warm sand from billowing four-poster sunbeds. Mellow music complements a constant tinkle of ice in glasses, while methuselahs of rosé are hurried around. It’s all as barefoot and cosseting as you’d expect from the team behind Cliveden and the Marbella Club, whose Slim Aarons-esque, country club aesthetic can be felt at every turn.\n\nPrice: from about £354 per night\n\nAddress: Carrer de Ses Feixes, 52, 07800, Illes Balears, Spain\n\nThe va-va-voom Vedra viewpoint\n\nPetunia’s savvy owners got it bang on when they bought and redeveloped a clutch of 1970s coastal apartments whose saving grace was having arguably the best views on the island. Now unrecognisably overhauled (and recently ushered into the Beaumier stable), Petunia is the ultimate Ibiza escapist’s fantasy. In the far southwest of the island, the road snakes and curves through the whitewashed pueblo of San José, past Sa Talaïa, the island’s tallest mountain, and around vertiginous clifftops until suddenly, magically, shearing out of the water with all her 400 metres of granite might is Es Vedra, Ibiza’s mystical, magnetic, offshore monolith. No matter how many times you see it, Es Vedra makes your heart skip a beat, and it is the view of the rock that dominates Petunia from every poolside daybed, every bougainvillaea-clad walkway and every shimmering rooftop. But look away you must, because Petunia itself is so extraordinarily pretty, with rustic, casita-style bedrooms and suites scattered through sprawling, lavender-scented grounds and a stately central finca where a cosy boutique, bar and restaurant thrum with doe-eyed lovers (Petunia is adults-only and couples make up the majority of guests).\n\nThe vibe here is unapologetically relaxed and guests wear bikinis and bedroom slippers to float from suites to the pool, where they’ll spend endless hours reading novels and sipping rosé beneath the shade of a Panama hat. Bedrooms themselves are supremely comfortable, with creamy linens, tribal artefacts and earthy-hued raffia baskets on the walls. Tiled bathrooms, some with sunken tubs, are capacious. Given the hotel’s far-flung location there’s a real focus on great food here and the three restaurants – one upscale with a tasting menu, one relaxed with a pizzeria and a panoramic rooftop crudo bar – leave guests with few excuses to leave. If cabin fever does set in, however, it’s a short walk down the hill to pretty Cala Carbó, where a low-slung beach shack – Balneário - serves the juiciest red prawns on the sand and where Petunia’s own dayboat can whisk you away for an afternoon’s swimming and snorkelling around Es Vedra itself.\n\nPrice: from about £281 per night\n\nAddress: Carrer de Sa Pala Marina, 07830, Illes Balears, Spain\n\nThe charming converted farmhouse\n\nLike most special places in Ibiza, this agrotourism hotel is at the end of a red dirt road and opened with just a few hushed whispers. Surrounded by pineland and fragrant lemon and fig trees, this converted finca on the east coast in Santa Eulalia is part of the swing back to Ibiza’s rootsy days. The old farmhouse has kept its original bones with sloping lines, rocky plastered walls, exposed timber ceilings and smooth concrete floors. The bedrooms and suites, converted from old stables, share the same rustic minimalism.\n\nYou might have to jiggle a key or mind your head, but the simple yet stylish composition of locally crafted objects positioned just so, nubby linens, and homemade tonics and aloe vera from the garden feels like a monastic refuge from Ibiza’s flash-in-the-pan luxury scene. The pool, surrounded by plumes of bougainvillea, is lovely but it’s the primal wood-fire restaurant with its flames burning high in the open kitchen that really steals the scene. Spilling out to the garden, it has knockout views across the verdant forest with tables and rugs beneath thickly knotted carob and olive trees. Every now and then, there are art exhibitions, pop-up concept stores and melodic acoustic evenings that go late into the night, powered by natural wine, mezcal and a local in-the-know creative community keen to keep this understated hot spot to themselves. Chloe Sachdev\n\nPrice: from about £309 per night\n\nAddress: De Jesús A Cala Llonga Km 7, 5, 07819 Santa Eularia D'es Riu, Balearic Islands, Spain\n\nFeatured on our 2022 Hot List of the best new hotels in the world\n\nIt’s an apt nod to Ibiza’s bohemian character that even the full bells and whistles 116 room Six Senses resort is hidden away on a hillside and accessed only by a winding dirt track. Make the journey and you’ll be welcomed with a shamanic smoke cleansing ceremony – just a whiff of the range of wellness classes and courses on offer. The theme here is rest, refuel and reset, but at an exceptional level. The attention to detail is unmatched, from the bamboo-clad roofs that resemble Ibiza’s traditional fisherman huts to the minibars stashed with ashwagandha and CBD-infused soft drinks.\n\nInteriors are muted, tactile and sophisticated, with pale wood, leather and stone. And while there are some rustic touches in keeping with the hotel’s earthy enclave, in reality, it’s a grown-up space that attracts an international crowd of Haute bohemians. Some stay for a while, waking up to terrace, pool and sea views in a junior suite before meandering down to paddle-board from a ladder directly into the sea. And then some never leave – several Six Senses Residences are available to buy.\n\nPrice: from about £440 per night\n\nAddress: Carrer Camí de sa Torre, 71, 07810 San Juan Bautista, Illes Balears, Spain\n\nFor bright-white, cool aesthetics\n\nNot just an island for non-stop partying or wellness retreats, the opening of The Standard, Ibiza on the main square of bustling Ibiza Town, has signalled the growing appetite for louche and sophisticated boltholes in this lively and cobbled-stone part of town. Frequented by in-the-know sneaker-clad guests and jet-set music industry crowd; you might be having a late dinner next to a DJ about to hit the decks at a nearby club or hanging out with fashionable locals having discreet meetings on the sun-drenched rooftop.\n\nThe bright-white hotel in its clean-cut neutral colours feels like a tranquil but cool city escape. There are deeply comfortable rooms for various types of travellers, from the neat and small-ish to the sprawling suites and mammoth plush private residence around the corner. During the day in Jara, the street-level restaurant and bar, it’s a tranquil haven with guests drinking cortados and tapping on keyboards before heading upstairs to the rooftop to enjoy zesty poolside cocktails under pretty parasols and sprawling views across the town. As the sun sets and the Balearic beat starts to hum, a sultry mood takes over. It’s the kind of place where sundowners lead to dinner and dinner to late-night suppers. This is a well-balanced and perfectly placed hotel for the traveller who wants a bit of buzz in the centre of town without being catapulted into the heaving thumping scene.\n\nPrice: from about £163 per night\n\nAddress: Carrer de Bartomeu Vicent Ramon, 9, 07800 Eivissa, Illes Balears, Spain\n\nFeatured on our 2022 Hot List of the best new hotels in the world\n\nIf there is a place where you can find inner peace and connect with yourself, that place is OKU Ibiza. This laid-back luxury retreat is a small paradise within a paradise, and the best place to discover (or rediscover) the so-called White Island: Think wabi sabi–inspired design, two serene swimming pools, regular yoga sessions, and fusion cuisine. The hotel also has a privileged location that gives you access to the most beautiful beach spots on the island, from large and sandy shores to hidden small coves, as well as popular beach clubs and restaurants with sea views. María Casbas\n\nPrice: from about £252 per night\n\nAddress: Camí del Portixol, 2, 07820 Sant Antoni de Portmany, Illes Balears, Spain\n\nThe elegant Ibiza Town oasis\n\nIt’s over 20 years since the Ibiza Gran Hotel opened in Ibiza Town’s marina glossy district, predating the area’s multi-million-euro revival by a decade. The waterside zone is now the island’s smartest hang-out and Ibiza’s original five-star hotel is still very much at its heart. Inside, the Ibiza Gran Hotel is a paradigm of serene luxury, with restrained, cream-on-cream interiors (money talks, but wealth whispers), a sweeping, art-filled lobby and vast, airy suites, some with private plunge pools and extraordinary views across the harbour to UNESCO-protected Dalt Vila. Outdoors, two lagoon-like pools (one is adults-only) are fringed with plush daybeds, manicured lawns and towering, tottering palm trees.\n\nSo far, so laidback, but it’s not all about relaxation here. The hotel is part of an upscale demi-resort that includes a casino, an open-air rooftop Zuma restaurant and Club Chinois, Ibiza’s slickest new nightspot. The latter two opened last year beneath the watchful eye of Island Hospitality (Mikasa, Beachouse, Finca La Plaza) and have become Ibiza’s see-and-be-seen hotspots, with the island’s ritzy international set tumbling from al fresco sushi suppers at Zuma directly to Club Chinois’s red velvet privé area. If the late nights take their toll (Lío, Pacha and Roto are also on the doorstep), then lazy breakfasts fuelled by an omelette bar and pancake station will help, as will cryotherapy and oxygen treatments in the high-tech Open Spa.\n\nPrice: from about £231 per night\n\nAddress: Passeig Joan Carles I, 17, 07800 Eivissa, Illes Balears, Spain\n\nThe all-suite oasis\n\nOn top of a cliff among verdant pine groves, this gorgeous hotel has spectacular views from every angle. The designers were clearly in no doubt about the key selling points – the signature restaurant, The View, is deserving of its definite article, with infinite sea vistas and seafood-led tasting menus. Elsewhere, sunset rituals at Cone Club are nothing short of ethereal. Sink into plush chairs, take in 270-degree views, and sip on mixologist-made concoctions as the sun casts ambers and oranges across the sky.\n\nWellness is as key to a stay as gin and tonics and multi-course meals. A holistic approach is adopted across the state-of-the-art centre, where deep tissue massages ease post-party muscle knots, facials enhance holiday glows, and yoga sessions are paired with nutritional coaching sessions for optimal results. As an all-suite resort, every room has a balcony or terrace. Suites are categorised according to their location, with the most exclusive options in the cliff area. Here, panoramic views, open-plan living spaces and a home-from-home (but better) feel come guaranteed – some even come with expansive terraces decked with sun loungers and private pools.\n\nPrice: from about £254 per night\n\nAddress: Carrer Puig Delfín, s/n, 07830, Illes Balears, Spain\n\nThe legendary party hotel\n\nMention Pikes Hotel and images of flamingo pink tennis courts, terraces that tumble onto each other and pool parties, pre-parties, after-parties come to mind. Wham's ‘Club Tropicana’ video was shot here; Freddie Mercury stayed so often they named a suite after him. Opened in the late 1970s by legendary hedonist (and recently deceased ) Tony Pike, it's been in the hands of trusted party legends Ibiza Rocks for some time now. Pikes has always been a great place to party, just not the best place to wake up in. But times they are a changing. Careful to keep its rock n’ roll spirit alive, eight of the original rickety bedrooms have been revamped into smart garden suites, giving some much needed comfort to the louche party pad. Each of the finca-style rooms have been designed as retreats but stay true to the Pikes spirit with quirky and eclectic stylings – gold basins, funky wallpaper, and ample outdoor space each with wooden-clad bathtubs, some with enough room for four. The glam-up also includes mini Smeg fridges, Aesop bath products, Bluetooth speakers, silk kimonos, GHD hair straighteners and dryers and super king beds. Chloe Sachdev\n\nPrice: from about £186 per night\n\nAddress: 07813,, Carrer Torrent s/n, 07813 Puig d'en Valls, Balearic Islands, Spain\n\nThe sustainable rural estate\n\nWhen it opened in 2004, this 24-bedroom working agroturismo kicked off the farm-to-fork ethos on the island. Now, the rural movement is booming and Atzaró has evolved again, with an updated interior look that includes mother-of-pearl-inset doors, teak four-posters, polished terracotta tiling and limewash, the traditional paint of the seven-generations-old family finca. Colour comes from the tumbling towers of bougainvillaea outside every window and the fiery birds of paradise flowers that cluster around discreet, single-storey suites.\n\nThe orange-filled estate is in the rural northern heart of Ibiza, in an area deeply steeped in local tradition and history. A stroll along dusty lanes to the nearby settlement of Atzaró itself reveals an ancient well and water system and a clutch of primitive, Moorish-style houses occupied for over 700 years. The hotel’s own grounds have expanded exponentially in recent years, with 13 hectares of sprawling kitchen gardens peppered with pergolas and shady bowers where all the hotel’s organic vegetables are grown. On hot summer nights, the gardens host outdoor supper clubs and film screenings as wood pigeons coo softly in the rusting cypress groves. Atzaró’s sustainability credentials have evolved too and the whole hotel is now totally off-grid, with 200 solar panels and fresh well water powering the property.\n\nGuests (largely British and American) drift from pool to pool (there are four, plus plunge pools in many of the suites across the road) and down to the spa – perhaps Ibiza’s most well-established – for rigorous massages and hypnotic facials in the carved wooden treatment rooms, sound baths in the temples and rosemary scented steams in the hammam. An army of shaded day beds marches out across the manicured grounds, providing ample space to switch off, read a book and soak up the ethereal, orange-blossom-scented atmosphere.\n\nPrice: from about £209 per night\n\nAddress: Diseminado P 12, Sta Eulalia, 153, 07849, Balearic Islands, Spain\n\nThe next-level B&B\n\nEveryone said it couldn’t be done. But somehow Austrian owners Andreas Lackner and Andreas Oberkanins worked some wizardry and transformed the old Finca La Colina, in the hills outside of Santa Eularia, in just two months. The Seventies retro tiling, royal-blue bathrooms, low ceilings and dark-stained pine woodwork were speedily ripped out. And in their place is what the Andreases describe as pop-rustic style. The tiles of the turquoise-bright swimming pool have been painted anthracite grey, and the old wooden daybeds replaced by bespoke mattressed platforms jutting out above the water. The seven re-done rooms (two more to follow) are cool, with original foot-thick walls keeping the searing high-summer sun out and olive-tree beams on show wherever possible. Lackner designed the fabric for the spaces himself (artichoke wallpaper, screen prints of antique embroidery, and scans of delicate old lace are all reimagined as headboards and cushions).\n\nHe also befriended a local welder who made those same headboards, along with the dining chairs and almost all of the outdoor furniture, in a rusted metal that runs throughout. The winter sitting room is full of curiosities, gifts from friends (a painting of a Ken-doll torso), as well as knobbly lemon vases and knick-knacks from the inimitable Sluiz interiors warehouse down the road. This is a hotel as a house party. A help-yourself, no-rules villa where guests chatter over morning espressos and swap tips about beach trips and restaurants for supper. It feels fresh and exciting, a new shift for Ibiza.\n\nPrice: from about £275 per night\n\nAddress: 07849, Balearic Islands, Spain\n\nThe smart seaside hostel\n\nThis white-washed former hostel sits atop a row of blue-painted fishermen's huts, tickled by the gentlest of waves. The sprawling waterside terrace acts as bar, restaurant and sun deck for guests – the type of well-travelled 30-somethings who have been told about this hotel's extraordinary mid-century-tropical aesthetic. They gather with clued-up locals feasting at long tables – Portinatx is a fishing village at heart, and the menu of fish tacos and seared pulpo relies heavily on the local catch. By evening, they'll be sipping Piña Coladas at the bar, which is thatched with faded palm fronds and lined with sheepskin-topped stools. The interiors are a collage of colour, texture and artful precision; each bamboo chair in just the right spot, each slatted line of shade falling just so. Off a long, open-sided corridor are nine jewel-coloured bedrooms, where pile rugs and raffia wall hangings create a throwback-motel vibe. Rooms – on the small side but with private sea-view balconies – are decked out with burnt-orange curtains, cornflower-blue tiles and huge triple-mattress CocoMat beds. Dinky bathrooms are facelifts of the originals, so don't expect colossal showers or fancy basins. But like all other things here, they're so chic you can't look away.\n\nPrice: from about £195 per night\n\nAddress: Ctra. Vénda de Portinatx, 103, 07810 Portinatx, Illes Balears, Spain"
