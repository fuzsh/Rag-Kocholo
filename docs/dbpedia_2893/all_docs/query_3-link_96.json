        "text": "Partying in Ibiza? Know what to expect when you hit this island.\n\nAs a reward to myself for finishing my MBA program, I took a boys‚Äô trip to Spain. And since I missed out on a lot of party opportunities being pre-occupied with school and work, I figured I‚Äôd make it up at where else, but the party island of Ibiza.\n\nIbiza (pronounced ee-bee-tha) attracts millions of people with its numerous beaches and world-famous parties.\n\nDancing advertisements\n\nHere are a few helpful tips for partying.\n\nPurchasing club tickets.\n\nParty girl quote: ‚ÄúOMG. I super really can‚Äôt wait to see David Guetta at Pacha, but tix are sold out online!‚Äù Not to worry, the clubs only release a small number of tickets to online resellers. You can easily buy tickets once you‚Äôre on the island. Tickets can go from ‚Ç¨20 all the way up to ‚Ç¨90 for the big parties.\n\nTicket seller on the beach\n\nPromoters are a dime a dozen and are hard to miss on the island. You can also find them as restaurant hosts, grocery clerks, or the local barber. The only time you may want to buy tickets in advance is for the opening/closing parties.\n\nPromoters are entertaining too. One old man asked us in a deep Russian accent, ‚ÄúDo you have everything you need for party? You know tickets.. (whispers loudly) marijuana, X, heroine?‚Äù Before taking marijuana, read about what is the best way to consume marijuana. You can also seek help from a professional, and rest assured that at DocMJ, if medical marijuana is not right for you, you won‚Äôt have to pay anything.\n\nAt the party.\n\nDress code. Really, almost anything goes. My friends and I brought jeans & dress shirts and after the first night, we realized we didn‚Äôt even need them. Reality is you can be glammed up with pieces like moverse haljine I suknje or look like you just came from the beach. For guys, simple t-shirts w/ shorts & sneakers are OK. Ladies, where what you want.\n\nAvoid the lines. Arrive before 1am. I know that‚Äôs close to closing time for parties in the US, but the party‚Äôs just getting started here in Ibiza!\n\nClub scene at 1am\n\nExpensive a$$ drinks. Ibiza has to give Miami a run for its money for most overpriced drinks.\n\nBottled water ‚Äì ‚Ç¨12. That‚Äôs right. $18 freakin‚Äô US dollars for a tiny bottle of agua. Nightclubs are aware that many party goers don‚Äôt need to drink alcohol because they‚Äôre high off of something elsE. That‚Äôs license to charge up the wazoo for water alone.\n\nOnly in Ibiza, where you can get shots cheaper than beer! ‚Ç¨9 compared to ‚Ç¨10. May not look like much, but did you come to just have 1 drink?! üòâ\n\nCameras. Some nightclubs have been known to confiscate your camera if they catch you using one. Then they‚Äôll have you check it in for a price or make you buy it back for a ransom. You have better chances sneaking in shots with your smartphone.\n\nEmbrace the fist pump. These clubs aren‚Äôt your typical ‚Äòget your groove on‚Äô type clubs.\n\nThey‚Äôre more like packed concerts where most people are there to praise the DJ‚Äôs, jump and throw their hands up in the air. Looks like an adult bouncy house with really, really loud music.\n\nPopular weeknights.\n\nI visited the island from Monday ‚Äì Thursday which happens to be the biggest nights during the party season. Here is a summary with some of the week‚Äôs biggest nights:\n\nMonday\n\nMasquerade Motel @ Pacha\n\nSwedish House Mafia\n\nClub Life @ Privilege\n\nTiesto\n\nTuesday\n\nCarl Cox @ Space w/ rotating guests Norman Cook, Roni Size & Elio Riso\n\nWednesday\n\nLa Troya / Espuma @ Amensia\n\nThe only foam party & one room hosts the island‚Äôs popular gay party night\n\nThursday\n\nF*** Me I‚Äôm Famous @ Pacha\n\nDavid Guetta w/ rotating guests Afrojack, Avicii, Will.I.Am, and Taio Cruz\n\nCream @ Amnesia\n\nPaul Van Dyk w/ rotating guests Laidback Luke, Wolfgang Gartner, and Calvin Harris\n\nAdditional tips.\n\nFor all things Ibiza, check out Ibiza Spotlight. You can also purchase club tickets here.\n\nVueling is a regional budget airline in Spain that services Ibiza frequently.\n\nAnd last but not least, party hard but make sure you party safe. You don‚Äôt want to end up like this guy after your first night in Ibiza. (But just in case you have too much fun, there are pharmacies nearby where you can purchase nifty crutches for about ‚Ç¨22!)\n\nSo who‚Äôs ready to party?\n\nPhoto credit ‚Äì 4\n\nYou might like:\n\nShare and Enjoy"
