        "text": "DO I NEED ENTRY TICKETS IF I HAVE BOOKED AN AREA ?\n\nThe price of entry is included in the price of all Sunset Lounge Area, Beds, Pool Bed, Table, Cabana and Sofa bookings.\n\nCAN I ADD GUESTS TO MY RESERVATION?\n\nThe bed/table you reserve is for a maximum number of people. No extra guests will be allowed to join the reservation. Therefore, you will have to reserve for the number of guests attending.\n\nCAN I BRING LUGGAGE INTO THE DAY CLUB?\n\nWe do not store any luggage, large bags or bike helmets at the venue or at any of our venues, so they will not be permitted inside.\n\nARE CHILDREN ALLOWED IN THE DAY CLUB?\n\nUnder 18s are NOT permitted into the venue.\n\nIF IT RAINS WILL I BE ISSUED WITH A REFUND?\n\nWe have a no refund policy. However, if the day club closes due to extreme weather, you will be offered to change the date of your booking (subject to availability). Please note that bookings must be changed before 12PM. Please contact us on 0034 971 80 32 60.\n\nWILL I BE PROVIDED WITH TOWELS?\n\nGuests will be provided with towels for use on the day. For any extra towels, you will be asked to pay a 10€ deposit. When paying your deposit, your waiter will issue you with a token. On returning the token and towel to your waiter before leaving, your deposit will be returned.\n\nARE THERE LOCKERS FOR ME TO USE?\n\nThere are lockers within the day club for guests to use and cost €10 for the day with a complimentary phone charger inside. Please ask your Hostess on the day to show you where these are located.\n\nCAN WE BRING FOOD AND DRINK INTO THE DAY CLUB?\n\nFood and drink (including water) purchased elsewhere may not be consumed inside the day club, this also includes food and drink from the THB Ocean Beach Hotel. If you have any dietary requirements you will need to contact the day club in advance so we can look at accommodating your request.\n\nWHEN DO I PAY THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON MY BOOKING?\n\nYour waiter upon arrival at your bed will charge this on the day. This can be paid by either card or cash on the day. The outstanding amount of the booking can also be paid up to 72 hours before the date the bed/table is reserved, however any additional spends over the minimum spend will need to be paid on the day to your waiter by cash or credit/debit card.\n\nDO I NEED TO USE THE SAME CARD THAT WAS USED TO PAY THE DEPOSIT TO PAY THE OUTSTANDING AMOUNT?\n\nThis is not necessary. You will be able to pay using a different card or in cash on the day.\n\nCAN I BUY VIP WRISTBANDS?\n\nNo. Only guests with VIP Bed bookings will be provided with VIP wristbands.\n\nWHERE CAN I SEND MY C.V?\n\nYou can upload it directly to our Recruitment page.\n\nIS THERE A DRESS CODE?\n\nO Beach reserves the right to refuse admission for unsuitable attire which includes; body paint, fancy dress, novelty shoes hen/stag accessories (including veils, sashes & matching t-shirts ). Props including inflatables are strictly prohibited.\n\nPlease ensure you are wearing suitable attire when arriving and departing the venue.\n\nSporting team tops are strictly prohibited. To bathe in the pool we do enforce you wear proper bathing attire, you may not enter the pool fully clothed. Please note that topless bathing is not permitted in the venue.\n\nARE UMBRELLAS GUARANTEED WITH ALL BEDS?\n\nUmbrellas are not guaranteed in the Sunset Lounge Area. All other Beds and Tables do have umbrellas subject to weather conditions.\n\nCAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THE COVER CHARGE / MIN SPEND MEANS\n\nBeds are made up of a Minimum Spend plus a cover charge. The minimum spend means the minimum amount of money you need to spend on that day to secure the bed. This can be spent on food and drink of your choice, or a drinks package. The cover charge is what you pay to hire the bed for the day. The deposit amount you pay to secure the bed is deducted from the total cost of the booking, so you just need to pay the remainder of your balance on the day.\n\nSo for example, if the bed has a 100€ cover charge and 600€ minimum spend, the total cost of the bed is 700€ and you receive 600€ back to spend on food and drink of your choice.\n\n(Excluding any Ibiza Spray Event which has a Champagne package included in the price that cannot be altered.)\n\nCAN YOU TELL ME HOW MUCH THE PRICE IS IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN EURO?\n\nUnfortunately we are unable to advise you what the exact amount would be in GBP, as we charge in our local currency the Euro. This conversion rate would be determined by your bank. However I can suggest looking at www.xe.com as a guide only to view the latest rates.\n\nI HAVE BOOKED WITH THB OCEAN BEACH HOTEL DO I GET ANY PRIVILEGES?\n\nGuests staying at the THB Ocean Beach Hotel who have booked via www.obeachibiza.com only, will receive entry Monday to Sunday. Guests are also entitled to free cover charge off their first Minimum Spend bed booking (lowest priced bed in the cart, excluding loungers). One ‘free cover charge’ is given per room booked during your stay. Upon completing your booking you will be sent a discount code and told by our Reservations Team what you are entitled to. You will then be asked to book online using this code which will automatically remove the cover charge. For this to be applicable, you will need to book and remove the cover charge before the day of the booking. To redeem your coupon code please contact reservations@oceanbeachhotelibiza.com\n\nGuests booking directly via O Beach Ibiza Website and THB staying at Naeco & Los Molinos will receive FREE entry Monday to Sunday.\n\nBy booking your stay at THB Ocean Beach Hotel through a third party, you will be offered FREE entry Monday to Saturday, and 50% off the entry price on Sundays.\n\nWhen booking your stay at Naeco & Los Molinos through a third party, you will be entitled to 50% off the entry price Monday to Saturday, and the full price will be charged on Sundays.\n\n*Direct hotel bookings must arrive before 5pm and third party hotel bookings must arrive before 3pm.

You will be charged the full door/entry price if you leave and wish to return.\n\nWE HAVE BOOKED A BED FOR IBIZA SPRAY. CAN WE CHANGE THE CHAMPAGNE PACKAGE TO SPIRITS?\n\nUnfortunately for the Ibiza Spray events the Champagne Packages cannot be altered or changed. You can however buy additional drinks from our normal menu in addition to your package on the day.\n\nHowever all VIP reservations have the option of an alternative- minimum spend, for their bed or table at higher cost.

If you would like this removed, please speak to your Waiter/Waitress on the day.\n\nCAN I CHOOSE WHICH SUNSET LOUNGE AREA WE HAVE?\n\nUnfortunately you are unable to choose the specific location of any Lounge booked. The lounge area for the group is allocated on arrival by the Host/Hostess team. If you have booked a lounge area for more than one guest, we advise arriving early in order to be allocated together.\n\nWHERE CAN I SUNBATHE?\n\nIf you are looking to sunbathe then we recommend booking a bed suitable for this as we do not allow guests to lay down on the grass or around the Pool area.
