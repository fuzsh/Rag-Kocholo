        "text": "Ibiza nightclub Eden has been forced to rebrand its weekly Space Ibiza club nights following a court ruling over the rights to the residency’s branding.\n\nLast week, Diario de Ibiza reported that Space Ibiza founder Pepe Roselló’s ownership of the brand’s famous “Space” trademark was annulled in a Spanish commercial court due to its “nominative and graphic” likeness to the legendary nightclub’s original logo, the rights to which are owned by Fiesta Hotels & Resorts SL, who filed the trademark in 1991.\n\nPalladium Hotel Group, which owns Fiesta Hotels & Resorts SL and other White Isle properties like the Grand Palladium Hotel and hibernating club Privilege, subsequently ordered that the 24-date Space Ibiza-branded residency at Eden come to an end.\n\nFrom 1989 until Space Ibiza’s closure in 2016, Roselló leased the venue for his famous nightclub from the Matutes family, which owns the Palladium Hotel Group. The venue is now home to Hï Ibiza. The ruling also impacts Roselló’s adjacent brands “Space Dance Barcelona,” “Space Dance Madrid,” “Space Beach Club,” and “Space Ibz Planet.”\n\nEden has now unveiled an alternative show in its place. NOSPACE will officially launch this Friday, August 9, and run through October 4 with the slogan, “Embrace the Night, NOSPACE for Sleep.”\n\n“Due to the ongoing battle to keep our Friday night presence in San Antonio, we believe it is crucial to launch NOSPACE to protect this vital part of the Ibiza clubbing scene,” Eden wrote in a statement. “Fridays at Eden are more than just a night out; they are a tradition that defines the Ibiza experience for many and a home to a global community of clubbers.”\n\nOn Monday, Eden posted a video to Instagram unveiling the new brand replete with the words, “There is no space in this world for cowards and bullies.” A caption alongside the video reads, “We were always there, now there is NOSPACE. Embrace what we had and celebrate what is coming. You know we know. Now the rest can know too. There is NOSPACE.”\n\nLineups for the house and minimal tech club night will be announced at a later date. For more information or to purchase tickets, visit nospaceofc.com."
