        "text": "Privilege is on the mend. According to a report from Periódico de Ibiza y Formentera, the island’s Tourism Planning Commission approved major renovations for the legendary Ibiza superclub.\n\nThe venue, which has been closed since 2019, will receive €8.2 million (nearly $9 million USD) in funding from Ibiza’s local government in order to install solar energy systems and improve its water circulation.\n\nThe funding comes as part of a new program that will seek to rejuvenate Ibiza’s tourism hotspots, with other local establishments like Palladium del Hotel Palmyra and Apartamentos Es Cantó also receiving financial injections.\n\nAs a result, rumors that Privilege will reopen have begun to swirl online—fueled even further by a number of teasing messages posted to the club’s website and social media channels.\n\nRenovations may have already begun as early as June 2022, when Privilege posted an image of the club to Facebook with the caption, “The quiet little road leading to the Privilege under construction.”\n\nSpeculation of a 2024 re-opening has also been buoyed more recently by a large “COMING SOON” message displayed on the club’s website.\n\nAfter an inspection indicated that Privilege had made illegal structural changes to increase capacity, the club had its license suspended in 2018.\n\nThroughout the 2019 season—the last in which Privilege was allowed to operate—multiple sections of the venue were deemed unsafe and closed off to the public.\n\nHailed by the Guiness Book of World Records as the “world’s largest nightclub,” Privilege was home to influential events such as Carl Cox‘s Pure and Solid Grooves.\n\nAccording to Mixmag, Privilege was fully acquired by Grupo Empresas Matutes last year. Grupo Empresas Matutes is the parent company of Palladium Hotel Group, which also owns Ushuaïa and Hï Ibiza.\n\nDespite the new renovations, Privilege’s return remains unconfirmed."
