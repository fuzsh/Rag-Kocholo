Of course he’s a Tiger. He made that clear when he made his comments about the stadium reminding him of the roar of the crowd in Death Valley. That level of connection to LSU didn’t come from one year as a student alone.\n\nPosted by SportsGuyNOLA\n\nNew Orleans, LA\n\nMember since May 2014\n\n17582 posts\n\nto lsutiger2\n\nHe is 100% LSU\n\nHe is a lock on the LSU Mt.Rushmore with Shaq, Burrow, and The Pistol\n\nPosted by tigerbait2010\n\nPNW\n\nMember since May 2006\n\n29728 posts\n\nto lsutiger2\n\nSo kind of you to allow mondo the privilege of being an LSU tiger. I’m sure his Death Valley reference in the press conference watched by many millions can finally live up to the contributions of your LSU degree wow\n\nPosted by la_birdman\n\nNorthern GA via Lake Charles\n\nMember since Feb 2005\n\n31107 posts\n\nto tigerbait2010\n\nquote:\n\nSo kind of you to allow mondo the privilege of being an LSU tiger.\n\nIs he not one? He ran track for LSU, correct?\n\nThe amount of hate this kid gets on here is ridiculous.\n\nSome of y'all are acting like he's representing some terrorist organization.\n\nGet over yourselves. The guy went to LSU, so did his brother Antoinne.\n\nHe threw a shoutout to LSU after his pole vault performance.\n\nCan't just be happy for the guy.\n\nThis post was edited on 8/8/24 at 1:42 am\n\nPosted by Cuthbert13\n\nMember since Apr 2024\n\n52 posts\n\nto lsutiger2\n\nIn 6 months no one here will even remember him or speak about him.\n\nOnly reason this is the case now is no football.\n\nPosted by Geaux Guy\n\nMember since Dec 2018\n\n5520 posts\n\nto Cuthbert13\n\nquote:\n\nIn 6 months no one here will even remember him or speak about him.

He must have made the right decision.\n\nPosted by Boudreauboudreaugoly\n\nLand of the Rice n Son\n\nMember since Oct 2017\n\n1525 posts\n\nto la_birdman\n\nquote:\n\nIs he not one?

The colloquialism of \"running track\" being used for athletes who are part of the track and field teams is older than you or I.\n\nPosted by mdomingue\n\nLafayette, LA\n\nMember since Nov 2010\n\n31779 posts\n\nto drizztiger\n\nquote:\n\nquote:\n\nIn 6 months no one here will even remember him or speak about him\n\n.\n\nI quite like it when posters remove all doubt early into their posting so I don’t have to discover they’re a fool.

Not for his career at LSU, but he is the best pole vaulter in the world.\n\nNCAA indoor champion, runner up in outdoor, SEC indoor & outdoor champion still pretty damn good for 1 year. Of course we claim him as a Tiger."
