        "text": "The iconic club Space is reopening in Riccione with house and techno pioneer Carl Cox.\n\nThe announcement of the reopening of Space came from the Space Ibiza Instagram. The image featured Michelangelo’s Creation of Adam. The words in the caption refer to a new era that builds on the legacy of the old with the words freedom, friendship, and music to name a few.\n\nPreviously known as one of the best dance clubs in Ibiza, Space is reopening in Riccione to a new era of clubgoers. The club is set to have an exciting array of performers coming through the spring and summer. The high times will begin with the one and only Carl Cox.\n\nCarl Cox knew from an early age that music would always be running through his veins. With over 40 years of experience mixing and remixing beats and synths, he still continues to find innovation in bringing people together through music. Carl previously had a 15-year residency at the original Space club in Ibiza in 2001.\n\nAs the club revives the spirit of a good time and even better music, the passing of the torch has to happen with the artists who made the space what it is. The space will include multifunctional spaces for both day and night events. The venue is expected to be large enough to also give a festival feel.\n\nThe club areas will include the arena, garden, and terrace. The grand opening is an exciting time for reviving the legacy of the club. Since its closing in 2016, founder Pepe Roselló has been working to get the one-of-a-kind larger-than-life vibes of the club back to clubgoers.\n\nThe good times will start to roll on June 2nd with Carl Cox. More performers will be announced as the spring progresses. The opening of the space will be another opening in a chapter of dance club history.\n\nAbout The Author"
