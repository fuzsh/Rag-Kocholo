        "text": "Ibiza has become synonymous with some of the best parties in the world. Every summer, visitors from all over the globe make their way to Ibiza to experience the fabled nightlife that the island offers, creating some of the best vacation stories of all time. During the day, islanders typically spend their time on one of the many world-class beaches getting a tan or participating in a multitude of day parties and concerts.\n\nAs the sun sets, the island’s most popular nightclubs turn into exactly what Ibiza is known for; the best party destination in the world. Dance the night away at these energetic Ibiza nightlife destinations where you’re sure to party until the sun comes up during your island getaway.\n\nArguably the most recognizable venue name on the whole island, Amnesia serves as the quintessential Ibiza nightclub. Amnesia hosts two massive rooms; The Club Room, a dark and dungeonesque space, and the Terrace, a large area with a glass roof that allows the morning’s sunlight to flood in, marking the end of the party. Both spaces have been the backdrop to some iconic nights, and are just waiting for you to come and experience everything they have to offer.\n\nThis award-winning destination is one of Ibiza’s crown jewels, boasting wild nightlife events within the venue of the Ushuaïa Ibiza Hotel. Attend the perfect beach party that’s filled with music blasting from some of the world’s best DJs who take the stage in front of hundreds of fans. With your hotel room overlooking the performance below, you’ll have a perfect view of the action with a convenient, private space to enjoy your exciting night.\n\nElectronic music fans will relish in the atmosphere of Hï Ibiza, a nightclub that brings energetic and mystique to its crowds of excited guests. The state-of-the-art setting filled with lights and art installations attracts thousands each year to enjoy the highly-coveted space. Events featuring some of the world’s best DJs draw in plenty of EDM fans to experience a night of music and celebration.\n\nWith a world record for being the World’s Largest Nightclub, you’ll get lost in the excitement at Privilege–a nightlife superclub that holds up to 10,000 partygoers. This historic destination has been attracting Ibiza’s finest since the 70s, and hasn’t missed a beat at attracting thousands to dance the night away in the one-of-a-kind space.\n\nIbiza’s finest head to Pacha for a lavish escape into a world of entertainment. The world-renowned brand plays host to some of the hottest international DJs in an expansive venue that holds more than 3,000 guests.

With unique, Mediterranean dishes served on the beautiful outdoor terrace, the restaurant will satisfy your senses and give you a perfect view of the city’s lights. Their cabaret performances are also sure to impress with dancers taking the stage for a performance to remember.\n\nSince 1999, DC-10 has done things a little bit differently than any other club on the island. They provide little-to-no publicity or advertising for their events, which limits their customer base to those who do their research and are really there to party. DC-10 has long been known for its no-holds-barred parties that will leave even the most experienced ravers with their jaws on the floor.\n\nStart your night off at one of the most stylish and sophisticated bars in Ibiza nightlife destination, The Ninth. Located on the ninth floor of the Hard Rock Hotel, this chic rooftop sky bar supplies guests with beautiful panoramic views of Playa d’En Bossa and Ses Salines National Park. The monochrome and minimalist design of The Ninth resembles that of a modern yacht, and with vintage champagne and craft cocktails, you’ll feel the same levels of luxury.\n\nWorld famous for their “Zoo Parties,” Benimussa Park hosts some of the most mind-boggling day parties on the island that extend long into the night. Elegant dressing and intricate animal body paint are commonplace at this venue, so don’t be surprised if you end up dancing with a tuxedo-clad zebra. Fire dancing, meditation pits, break dancing competitions and high-quality techno music are all things you can expect to find at ‘The Zoo.’\n\nJust a short taxi ride from San Antonio, this exotic venue will have you feeling like you’ve been transported to a fantasy land. Kumharas is unique in Ibiza, as it possesses a mellow and relaxed atmosphere with more sophisticated drinks. This beachy hangout is great for a refined night of sipping and dining as an alternative to indulging in the energetic nightclub scene.\n\nOpened in 2013, Destino is one of the most recent additions to the Destino Pacha Resort roster. Located above the Talamanca resort on the cliffs of Cap Martinet, Destino offers some of the best views of Ibiza Town that can be found anywhere on the island. Destino is sometimes used for huge open-air parties with world-famous DJs but also hosts its own nightclub, TOX, that is hidden away in the basement of the venue."
