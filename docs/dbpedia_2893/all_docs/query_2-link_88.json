This is correct if that person is attending the party. If not, contact us and we will change the name to that of one of the attendees.\n\nEach venue has its own admission requirements and dress code. We recommend you check them before attending the event. In general, backpacks, professional photo &video cameras are not allowed in most of the venues. Also some events have specific entry requirements. For instance, you will not be allowed to get in some clubs wearing flip flops, sport or swimming clothes."
