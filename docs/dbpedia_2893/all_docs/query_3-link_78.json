        "text": "Is Ibiza’s nightlife calling out to you? Are you already imagining living it large at the parties in its famous nightclubs? If so, take note of our suggestions and tips to find out where to go and when, because it’s often easy to get lost in its wide range of parties, clubs and terraces if you’re not sure what the nightlife scene of the White Island is like.\n\nAre you ready?\n\nThe island’s relationship with nightclubs began in the 70s, when party rooms, where dinner and live musical performances were offered, gave way to a type of venue focused solely on dance. Since then, Ibiza’s nightlife scene has evolved non-stop, from the famous Balearic Sound that made the Amnesia nightclub famous to the afternoon-evening parties in Ushuaïa that end with the arrival of midnight. Nowadays, enjoying a night out in Ibiza requires knowing where they play the music you like, which DJs fit your style and which day the party you’d like to go to is on. One thing is clear: Almost all the action is found in the triangle of San Antonio – Ibiza – Playa d’en Bossa.\n\nIbiza best clubs\n\nPacha Ibiza Crédito editorial: 360b / Shutterstock.com\n\nIbiza has four world-famous mega clubs (Hï, PACHA, Privilege and Amnesia), a few smaller clubs with diverse personalities, hotels that become clubs for a few hours, bars with live music and legendary terraces that provide the soundtrack for one of the most famous sunsets in the world. And let’s not forget the Marina de Ibiza neighbourhood, with a lively nightlife that is also home to part of the island’s gay scene. So if it’s your first time in Ibiza, the first question you will have, when faced with such variety, will definitely be: So where should you go out at night in Ibiza?\n\nHow to choose which club to go to in Ibiza\n\nAmnesia Ibiza Crédito editorial: 360b / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst of all, we have to take into account that in the nightclubs of Ibiza you have to know how to choose a session in accordance with your own taste: It’s not the same going to the legendary Flower Power party that PACHA holds, where rhythms from the 60s and 70s pound out, as attending a house session at Hï, enjoying the most danceable electronic music at the Glitterbox party or joining the Circoloo at DC10, a party specially designed for clubbers who like the most underground house and techno sounds.\n\nAlthough there are a few exceptions, electronic music is the star in the main clubs on the island. Therefore, it’s advisable before choosing where to go at night in Ibiza to check the calendar of events for the main clubs (Amnesia, PACHA, Hï, Ushuaïa…) on specialist websites such as Ibiza Spotlight and Welcome to Ibiza, and see the DJ sessions scheduled for each day of the week, so you can choose the one that best suits your musical tastes.\n\nAll the nightclubs in Ibiza open during the tourist season\n\nHi Ibiza – credit hiibiza.com\n\nPlaya d’en Bossa\n\nHï Ibiza\n\nOpen where Space Ibiza used to be, this avant-garde macro-club is famous for its residences and performances.\n\nPlatja d’en Bossa, 07817 Sant Josep de sa Talaia, Islas Baleares\n\nWeb: www.hiibiza.com/\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nSwag Ibiza Club\n\nThis nightclub is known as the place to go in Ibiza to dance trap, reggaeton, hip hop, R & B and other urban music genres.
