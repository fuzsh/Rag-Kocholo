        "text": "Collaboration is key\n\nLike making movies, the theme park industry is a collaborative one, as it takes many diverse talents to put on “the show” that our guests may call “the best day ever” or at times it rises to the level of “magical” when all those diverse aspects of fun converge.\n\n“You’re only as good as your operator”\n\nThe one thing I’ve come to learn as a designer is that “you’re only as good as your operator.” What does that mean? To me, that means that the cast members and the attention to the upkeep of any attraction you design is ultimately in the hands of another to truly take it to the finish line and it lives with them. You raise the “ child”and then it moves out and lives with another “parent”. There is nothing worse than working in some cases for several years, only to have the project you help bring to life decay before your eyes or have the special effects shut off. There’s also nothing more defeating than designing a stunning restaurant environment only to have the food be practically inedible, served on sticky tables, in a sweltering room, and your server gone to lunch. It reminds us of how critical the operation is to the guest experience. Design only sets the stage, the cast acts upon it. If you have an operator that does not “get it”, then the best day a designer can expect is opening day. The rest is downhill, and believe me, I’ve seen this happen on projects I’ve worked on. They go down in flames. Take your pictures day one before the paint falls off! It’s actually a very painful experience.\n\nValues above all\n\nThis is why a park operator who is passionate about the overall guest experience is a rare and wonderful find. In my experience, Disney legend Jim Cora was that kind of operator. We worked together on Euro Disneyland and at times sat in heated conflict, but we both were fighting for the same thing. That singular vision of “Walt’s park”, and we both knew that when the dust settled, we’d land with most of what we each wanted and the guest would win in the end. It’s a healthy conflict between creative and operations and maintains the delicate balance to prevent excess on both sides.\n\n“Tell him Walt sent you”\n\nJim was an eager young man working as a ride operator walking through Disneyland in the late 1950’s when he saw Walt Disney walking the opposite way. He tried to avoid Walt, but Disney spotted the load of books in his arms and called out to him. Cora was surprised that Walt knew him by his first name, but recalled his name tag was on. Good move! They chatted about Jim’s background and Walt senses Jim’s passion for cast member training. Jim shared how important training was to him and that there was a need to do it even better. Walt agreed that Jim should pursue his ideas and directed him to seek out cast member guru Van Arsdale France and to “tell him Walt sent you.’” Jim took that life changing turn and eventually became a key part of developing what we know now as “the Disney Show” and evangelized such game changing terms as “on-stage and backstage” in relation to Disneyland being a “show” that the “cast” was a part of. Those concepts and values would be capsulized in something called the “Disney University” that Jim would have a hand in developing as well. These tenets were critical to the huge success of the parks in general.\n\nTaking the park overseas\n\nJim’s operations career soon extended far beyond training into the opening of bigger things like Walt Disney World. So when the company would “jump the pond” to Asia, Jim took on helping to found a Disneyland for Tokyo. That success led Cora on a string of heady assignments to eventually retire as Chairman of Disneyland International, after opening both TokyoSea and Disneyland Paris. This is where we first worked together and later we reunited when I managed the master planning portfolio of Tokyo Disneyland.\n\nPaving the way to success\n\nMy favorite memory of working with Jim was when we realized that using asphalt to pave the 19th Century “Main Street USA’ in Paris might seem jarring and “out of period” to Parisians accustomed to walking on cobblestone “rues” every day. What works in Anaheim won’t always play in Europe, and worse, I wanted brick pavers which meant asking for more money. Michael Eisner even sent images of brick streets from Jamestown as a reference, so everyone was in the act at one point. We met with operations. To my surprise, Jim saw the paver enhancement as a plus as they could be easily removed without cutting into the street for repairs and good for show readiness! Sure enough, no sooner had the street been laid than they had to be removed for a large leak. The brick street reminds me that great design can be a “win-win” when both parties hold the guest experience above their own priorities. Jim’s thinking was “the show must go on.” We recently laughed about that experience. Here’s how Jim approached these situations.\n\n“This is a serious project, and there are plenty of times when the hard work and the stress make it difficult to smile or laugh. But if we can’t have a good time and enjoy what we are doing it will be impossible for us to create a good time for our guests. So we keep a sense of\n\nhumor.”- Jim Cora\n\nAccording to the NY times, “Dick Dale, who was known as the King of the Surf Guitar and recorded the hit song “Misirlou,” which was revived on the “Pulp Fiction” film soundtrack, died on Saturday, March 16th, 2019 in Loma Linda, Calif. He was 81. Dale was a surfer, sound pioneer and guitarist whose unusual, percussive playing style and thick, thunderous music earned him the nickname the Father of Heavy Metal. He influenced the Beach Boys, the Cure, Eddie Van Halen and Jimi Hendrix, among others.”\n\nI saw him play live several times and have “heard” greats like Keith Richards and Rick Neilson, but only Dick Dale makes you feel those chainsaw licks right in your gut. I guess you’d have to be there. There was no one like him.\n\nI feel that in his own way, Dick Dale was every bit an “Imagineer” himself. He questioned the status quo, drove himself to make his sound and his shows everything they could be, and invented his own sound that others envied. Bob Gurr…. with a guitar.\n\n“Surf music is a heavy machine-gun staccato picking style to represent the power of Mother Nature, of our earth, of our ocean,” he told The New York Times in 1994. His almost constant tremolo created friction so intense that it melted his guitar picks and strings as he played.\n\n“The staccato is so fast it heat-treats the strings,” he said. “They turn purple and black and they snap. And when I play, you’ll see a flurry of plastic — it just falls down like snow. I used to think it was dandruff. But I grind so hard that the guitar picks just melt down.”\n\nHis quest for a sonic impact to match what he had felt while surfing also led to innovations that would change the technology of electric guitars and amplification.\n\nLeo Fender, one of the electric guitar’s trailblazers, worked with Mr. Dale to create a guitar sturdy enough to withstand his style — Mr. Dale called it the Beast — and an 85-watt amplifier that could crank up loud enough to fill a dance hall.\n\n“Leo and I went to Lansing Speaker,” Mr. Dale said in 1994, “and we said, ‘We need a speaker that will not burn, will not flex, will not twist, will not break.’ ” - NY Times.\n\nIn all the glowing obituaries you hear of his career, including this one, no mention is made of his contribution to Disneyland’s Space Mountain. Always the pioneer, (and he told me so!) little or no mention is made that his licks were part of another pioneering achievement, in 1996 the first digitally synchronized music on a Rollercoaster. Hear it here\n\nWhy Dick Dale? Then Disney CEO Michael Eisner wanted a recognizable classical score as in the film \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", but a waltz, given the dynamic speed of the ride, felt inappropriate to the action. Composer Arrin Richard and I finally settled on using a classical melody that was familiar, but with a faster tempo. Although the mood was there, it was not driven by the action and movement of the vehicle. We wanted to accentuate the G-forces guests feel when pressed into the twists, turns, and drops each rocket endures. An electric guitar \"lick\" or \"riff\" over the score might give us that effect. To that end, we wanted Dick Dale, the man who invented them. We rode Space Mountain after hours at least 30 times, listening and timing each solo of Dale's guitar over the score till they were synced perfectly to the action.\n\nPerhaps only surpassed by the renaissance in “Pulp Fiction,” was his sound exposed to more people in recent memory than on Space Mountain. Dale’s throbbing “Ghost Riders in the Sky” was synced to a music video depicting the development of the NASA space program and played on a loop for waiting guests, later Camille St. Saens “Aquarium” melody played out on a revolutionary on-board audio system attached to each ride vehicle. Arranged and performed by Disney’s Arrin Richard, Dale (who did not read music) would then add his “chainsaw” riffs that were to be triggered to compliment each twist, turn and drop of your “rocket”. Dale’s music played continuously on the attraction for millions till 2005.\n\nAlways working, Mare rose to Senior Costume Designer at Walt Disney World, where she could inspire young artists. They can speak to that. One thing that amazed me was how she embraced technology and never allowed her mind to tell her she was too old for something. When she saw that I had given up paper to \"draw\" on a Cintiq digital screen, she had to have one and demanded she be the first in her department to draw on one. How many people in their 70’s would embrace digital in order to be on the cutting edge? Only a true “Imagineer.\" Auntie Mare. Eventually she mastered it, others followed suit, and she shared her tips. She retired from a stellar career at the Walt Disney Company after nearly two decades. Even in retirement, Mare never stopped designing and at 82 she was setting the tone for the hosts and hostesses of Embraer Executive Jets. I only hope I can stay that active!\n\nMarilyn Sotto Erdmann is survived by her husband John, daughter Cynthia, brother Ed and wife Adrianne, myself, wife Deena and Mare’s grandniece and nephews, Brian and Venice.\"\n\nNot every “Disney Legend” gets a plaque, but Marilyn was a great Imagineer, at least she was to me! - Eddie Sotto (“the nephew”)\n\nMain Street USA for Disneyland Paris was designed to satisfy a European audience that was accustomed to living within \"layers of history.\" Buildings in Europe have lived and still carry on many \"lives,\" evolving to meet ever changing needs, yet sporting their 19th Century roots. Everywhere you look in your stroll down the streets of Paris, those layers of history stand out and remind you of another time just beneath the modern signage. People flock to the \"city of lights\" to experience those layers that were once called \"La belle époque.\" Far from the mid-century suburban world of Anaheim, California, (the site of the original Disneyland,) our 19th Century \"Main Street USA\" needed to reward it's guests similarly with layer upon layer of it's own changes, gas lighting becoming electric, horses yielding to cars, etc. or it would feel hollow and insincere to this historically sophisticated audience.\n\nDesigning for the audience. Details in Context.\n\nWhat would guests think if they saw our street of modern asphalt (as it was in Anaheim) when Paris still has it's cobblestones? Not a very credible representation of \"turn of the century.\" What story could the street itself tell while waiting for an hour on the curb for the parade? In addition to making the street from brick pavers, we decided to go a step further with a tribute to those boulevards of the past. I had run across a book (Manhole Covers) that brought attention to the fact that even back in the 19th Century, manhole covers were a symbol of civic pride and stunning craft, so I asked our team create a small art installation of various antique american manhole covers for guests to discover right in the street. If the guest saw how we went to that length to embed detail, they'd assume everything had that level of thought.\n\nSeen Below. In addition to the star-studded Baltimore Fire Dept. example, we installed covers from Chicago, New York's Croton Water (sporting a DWP intertwined logo), and the elaborate filagree adorning the Central City, Colorado cover. It was so pretty, we reproduced that one and used it in two locations! All of these spanned the late nineteenth century and are great examples of how cast iron was used in simple and decorative ways all at once. Story is where you find it.\n\nThanks to David Goebel for his images and research.\n\nBack on the farm after 30 years.\n\nEddie Sotto began his design career at Knott's Berry Farm in 1979 as an assistant project designer. His first ride design and production was the successful \"Soap Box Racer\" and created some of the thematic structures and iconic character Clock for \"Camp Snoopy.\" It was a great thrill to return decades later to produce a conceptual presentation and analysis for a remodel of the historic \"Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant.\"\n\nRecommendations, sketches and images samples, graphic designs, plans and market trends, even historical providence went into a slide presentation. Everything matters. Here are just a few random slides to give you a sense of the extent to which we delved into the project. We tend to be ambitious and throw the net wide to capture the vision and then rein in some of the inspiration with the client based on what they can execute in the time and budget they have. The reason we do this is that the best ideas need to get on the table and usually they can be executed in a more modest way and still retain their power. At times, the client goes with the full vision. If you never see \"the wow,\" how can you achieve it? Many of those suggestions were adopted by the in-house team that executed the final remodel. Happy to have had a part in the inspiration.\n\nBuilding mockups for scale is an experiential fundamental and something we strive to do on our current projects. Beyond computer modeling, simple mockups lend a tactile impression CGI does not. Having a sense of how a space can experientially feel can be overlooked, but when your success depends on how much people love it, it pays to focus on experiential massing. This image from the late 1980s shows Disney Imagineering Chief Marty Sklar reviewing a \"mockup\" of the enclosed arcades of Main Street USA for Disneyland Paris. We had never attempted to create an alternate route to the center of the park,let alone an indoor one. It had to feel just as warm and intimate as the rest of the park. Part of the scheme are the 80 or more flickering Gaslights (shown in white paper and styrofoam and pictured right) that highlight our path . In that dusty Imagineering parking lot within view of the Interstate 5 Freeway, Marty gave us his approval. The real arcades emerged in 1992 and the reviews have been great, thanks to the foresight of \"mocking up\" the height and width to great effect.\n\nIn fact, the Arcades were part of a mandate for the Paris park to allow the guests to warmly circulate during inclement weather. An initial proposal was covering the entire Main Street with a steel and glass roof as was done to ill effect in Tokyo Disneyland. To his credit, Tony Baxter, the executive in charge, did not want to cover the street or create an extensive network of porches and awnings, but rather to create alternate fowl weather route, which allowed the guest to experience Main Street the way it was intended, and the arcades developed from there as a way to avoid covering the entire street.\n\nIn the late 1990s, long before Johnny Depp wore mascara and brandished a sword, I was on vacation in Hawaii, sketchbook in hand when the notion of transforming Tom Sawyer Island at Disneyland into \"Lafitte's Island\" (in honor of New Orleans most famous privateer) hit me. Disneyland had references to Lafitte in the form of naming the landing after him on the Pirates Attraction, and even an Anchor in his honor along the river.\n\nThe fact behind the fiction.\n\nHistorically speaking, Lafitte had a real thieves market of stolen goods on an island (Barrataria) across from New Orleans and the wealthy would shop there, so the logic made sense to me. I quickly read his alleged memoirs where he claims to have faked his death. The \"driver\" of this while thing was that park's operators wanted to eliminate the Tom Sawyer Rafts that transported guests back and forth, even explore closing the island for economic reasons. The Lafitte suggestion set out to address this issue by improving it's daily visitation and profitability while lowering operating costs (limited by the capacity of the rafts.) By tunneling under the river and creating a 2 way \"underpass\" of sorts, we would bring an unlimited flow of guests on and off with little operational cost. How? In the form of \"Lafitte's secret crypt and Catacombs.\" Story was that Lafitte faked his death and created a burial Crypt in a small graveyard along the river in front of the Haunted Mansion. Grave robbers, knowing it was actually a secret passage had broken through to the series of catacomb like chambers, littered with treasure and the remains of Lafitte's conquests. This led to the island where a capsized series of scuttled ships hulls were covered in Earth as secret interior rooms and hideouts were there to be explored. Even though there are only a few sketches and some of them are pretty rough, others have been cleaned up in living color, so let's go!!!"
