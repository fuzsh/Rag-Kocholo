        "text": "Coastal Academy High School partners with parents to prepare students for college, career, and citizenship. Most students participate in the four-day classroom program, but select students may benefit from the flexibility of our independent study program.\n\nFour-Day Program\n\nThe Four-Day Program serves students who would like to attend class in a traditional classroom setting four days per week (Tuesday-Friday). Teachers use lectures, small group interactions, labs, field trips, and projects to deliver an engaging and rigorous curriculum. Students in this program agree to exhibit respectful conduct and academic responsibility, including the timely completion of quality work and daily attendance. Students attend Mentor Advisory weekly to collaborate with peers, hear important school announcements, and receive personalized mentoring. Students are assigned to a School Counselor to provide guidance and mentorship. Coastal Academy High School is committed to building student resilience through intentional service, learning, and leadership development opportunities. All classes are yearlong except for several semester-long electives.\n\nFive-Day Independent Study Program\n\nThe Five-Day Independent Study Program provides additional flexibility for students and families. Families may choose from several options including selecting their curriculum, online courses, working with outside co-ops or vendors, and taking community college courses. Every nine weeks, students will meet with a credentialed teacher who oversees their progress.\n\nCAH provides various activities to allow students to connect with their community. Activities include sports, clubs, school dances, and various ASB-sponsored events. The student culture at CAH is remarkably accepting, nurturing, and wholesome, and all school events are designed to help students engage with each other in a safe and supervised environment. All students are encouraged to give back to their communities and must complete 37.5 community service hours each year they are enrolled at CAH.\n\nVisual and Performing Arts\n\nThe Visual and Performing Arts possess inherent value essential in creating well-rounded students. Studying the arts enables students to connect to content in new ways and better understand themselves and others. CAH instruction follows the California Arts Standards for creating, performing/presenting/producing, responding, and connecting, as well as the Common Core State Standards for reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Visual and Performing Arts courses provide students with an academically enriching and rigorous study of the arts.\n\nAthletics\n\nView Sports Site Here!\n\nCalifornia Interscholastic Federation (CIF)\n\nPurpose: Athletic competition allows our athletes to learn the values of discipline, commitment, respect, and hard work.\n\nAthletic Department â cahathletics@classicalacademy.com\n\nFall\n\nGirls Volleyball â Hannah Wilkin â hwilkin@classicalacademy.com\n\nCross Country â Jennifer Kloeppel â jenniferward14@gmail.com\n\nFootball â Stephen Patton â spatton@classicalacademy.com\n\nGirls Flag Football â Brian Morales â bmorales@pro-cal.com\n\nWinter\n\nBoys Basketball â Dale Jaggers â coastalboysbasketball@gmail.com\n\nGirls Basketball â Tim Shelton â tnsheltonsr@gmail.com\n\nBoys Soccer â McCabe Mesa â mmesa@classicalacademy.com\n\nGirls Soccer â Chad Dodd â mcdodd@cox.net\n\nWrestling â Mario Cornejo â mariocornejo@sbcglobal.net\n\nâSpring\n\nBaseball â Glen Henton â ghenton@classicalacademy.com\n\nSwim & Dive â Eric Fragnoli â efragnoli@classicalacademy.com\n\nSoftball â Frank Contreras â fjcontreras1@yahoo.com\n\nBoys Volleyball â Hannah Wilkin â hwilkin@classicalacademy.com\n\nTrack & Field â Stephanie Flood â sflood@classicalacademy.com\n\nBeach Volleyball â Thomas Lloyd â tlloyd@classicalacademy.com\n\nYear Round\n\nCheer â ChantÃ© Amos â camos@classicalacademy.com\n\nDance â Amy Cornejo â acornejo@classicalacademy.com\n\nCompetitive Surf â Jim Balderson â balderson.james@gmail.com\n\nSailing â TBD\n\nSPORTS ADMINISTRATION:\n\nAthletic Director â Glen Henton â ghenton@classicalacademy.com\n\nAssistant Athletic Director â Cade Ukrainetz â cukrainetz@classicalacademy.com\n\nAssistant Principal â Chedly Benattia â cbenattia@classicalacademy.com\n\nFor sports schedules, practice times, and locations, please visit stingraystrong.com or download the StingraySports App on the App Store or Google Play.\n\nYearbook\n\nCAH offers a dynamic, engaging, and exciting yearbook program.
