During that span, the organization has registered over one million voters, forged alliances with hundreds of musicians and entertainers, and produced dozens of highly-successful events and initiatives.\n\nUnder his leadership, HeadCount has won multiple CLIO and SHORTY awards for excellence in social impact. He has overseen production of public service announcements starring Jay-Z, Dave Matthews, members of the Grateful Dead and the boy band Brockhampton, the most recent of which was distributed by the Ad Council. He was chosen as an honoree in the 2021 Billboard ‘Change Agents’ list and has been a featured speaker at the South by Southwest music conference, and appeared as an expert commentator on ABC, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News and several other television networks.\n\nPrior to creating HeadCount, Andy was best known in the music community as an author of \"The Pharmer's Almanac\", a guide to the band Phish that sold over 70,000 copies. He also worked in sports for over a decade, serving as media editor of Street & Smith's SportsBusiness Journal, and later as Vice President of U.S. Corporate Development at the technology company Kangaroo TV.\n\nA 1994 graduate of Brown University, Bernstein resides in a slopeside condominium at the Mountain Creek ski resort, not far from New York City. His pastime is posting GoPro videos of his \"off-piste\" ski adventures on social media.\n\nLucille Wenegieme\n\nExecutive Director\n\nLucille Wenegieme\n\nLucille Wenegieme is an executive in the civic engagement and democracy spaces with an eclectic background in political advocacy, communications, fashion, and biomedical science. Her central change philosophy is that democracy has to meet people where they are, and she focuses on culture as the vehicle to get there. That interdisciplinary approach to work and life is her greatest asset, and she brings 360 degree consideration to the organizations and projects that she leads.\n\nPrior to joining HeadCount as its sophomore executive director, Lucille served on the executive team at the Denver Clerk & Recorder’s Office where her team leveraged a $13 million budget to administer elections and provide other essential services. During her tenure, the Office launched a citizen-led campaign finance initiative to match local small-dollar donations with public funding and implemented a first-of-its-kind marijuana-themed get-out-the-vote campaign.\n\nHer career has also included a stint as vice president of communications at the National Vote at Home Institute, which helped states and municipalities rapidly scale up their capacity to handle mail-in votes during the 2020 election. She also led her own communications firm, Kleos Creative, and was an executive at the Washington, D.C.-based public affairs firm Fireside Campaigns. Prior to entering the democracy space, she worked in communications at the global luxury retail giant Tapestry (formerly Coach, Inc.).\n\nAs a first generation Nigerian-American, Lucille believes that growing up with a last name that most Americans can’t say or spell has given her a particular strength of character, which she brings into every room she enters. As a locally accomplished costume designer, Lucille has recently taken up hand embroidery, and is creating the perfect look to wear to see Beyonce on tour.\n\nTim Bramlette\n\nSenior Director of Partnerships & Marketing\n\nTim Bramlette\n\nTim Bramlette is from Ventura, CA and joined the HeadCount family in January of 2016. He has a very strong passion & background in music photography as he resided House Photographer for over 10 years at the the Majestic Ventura Theater. A few highlighted musicians he has photographed live are the Beastie Boys, Radiohead, Gwen Stefani & Tom Petty. Continuing his love for music & travel, Tim quickly found himself touring in a manager role with several different types of musicians like Boston's own punk rockers the Street Dogs, Kings of Convenience from Norway and world-renowned pro surfer & musician Donavon Frankenreiter. While working with Donavon, Tim began his passion for non-profit work and started hosting fundraisers for the Love Hope Strength Foundation, the worlds largest rock n roll cancer organization. His volunteering efforts quickly found him working full time for the foundation as their Director of Events & Artist Relations for over two full years. With thousands of miles & shows under his belt, we are excited to have him onboard as our Senior Director of Partnerships & Marketing.\n\nJamie Huntsman\n\nSenior Art Director\n\nJamie Huntsman\n\nJamie Huntsman joined HeadCount in 2006. She's been passionate about music and the business surrounding music since her college days. Jamie was a DJ and the Music Programmer for her college radio station, interned at several local radio stations, and also interned at Sony Music in Cleveland. After College she was hired at Sony Music in Chicago as a marketing assistant and graphic artist. In 2005 Jamie went freelance working as an illustrator and graphic designer for many music-related and non-music-related clients. While building her own business, Jamie volunteered her designs for HeadCount. It was apparent quite quickly that working with HeadCount meant she could be part of the music industry as well as make a social impact. As HeadCount grew, so did Jamie's role in the organization. She was named HeadCount's Art Director in 2010. Jamie lives in Pittsburgh, PA with her husband Brad and her daughter Halley.\n\nTappan Vickery\n\nSenior Director of Programming & Strategy\n\nTappan Vickery\n\nTappan is a veteran organizer with two decades of nonprofit experience working in civic engagement, environment, and social justice. Tappan started volunteering with HeadCount in its inaugural year.
