        "text": "Full Transcript\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWelcome back, everybody, Doug Shafer with another episode of The Taste. We've got a long-time fellow winemaker, vintner friend, we never see each other enough, Bo Barrett, welcome.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHi, Doug. Great to be back, man. Great to see you again.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGreat to see you. Yeah, you're at Calistoga. I'm Stags Leap. It's like it's only 25, 25 miles, but it seems like a million years away sometimes.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt is, you know, because we have the vineyards in southern Napa Valley, and I drive by, I should drop in and see Doug. But it's just, if you drag - and stuff like that, it's like s- yeah. We're just-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah, too busy.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt's, uh, you know, that's pretty typical, 'cause this is a busy business. (laughs). Ha-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWe are busy.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnd, uh, but, we usually when we do see each other, it's usually not in Napa Valley. It's on the road. We cross paths out selling wines. And, I don't know, if Bo remembers it, I think he does. 'Cause we've talked about it before. But we had the great, the best time together, years ago, on a road trip. You remember what, you know what I'm talking about?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nI absolutely do.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nI know exactly was, I think it was about 50 miles an hour and 50 feet in the air. (laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSomething like that.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. (laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWe were at the Taste of Vail. It's first weekend in April. They had, they do it to get everybody up to the hill. And we were out, it's a two or three day thing, and we were out the night before at some big tasting. We were, we were tasting, a lot.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAs I recall.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnd I think you said, “Shafer, the best run, it's Avanti. You gotta go tomorrow.” I said, “Bo, I gotta do a seminar at, at noon.” He said, “See yeah there at, you know, 9:00, 9:30 sharp. We'll get a few runs in and we can split.” So, sure enough, I showed up, and you showed up. I was really hurting. I was hurting. (laughs). And so we went up the chair lift, and we're going down this, it's a groomer run where you go like 40 or 50 miles an hour, and-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd it's blue, black, blue again.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGorgeous day. Nobody on the hill. And we're just screaming, side by side. And all of a sudden, I was in mid-air. And it's like, “Oh my God. I just went off a cliff.” (laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnd, uh, Bo hit this lip at the same time. We were fine. We landed it fine. But we both got down, we were like ... I think we looked at each other, the, it's like, “That was cool. Let's- \"\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n\" - do it again.\" (laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt was awesome. But then, we knew it was coming, and we never got as much air as we-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nNever.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... did at the first time. Yeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nNot as much fun. That was, uh, this-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat was a great day.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThat was a beautiful day. Didn't last long enough. But anyway, we've got, you know, Bo, you've got, I figure, three main stories. You got Chateau Montelena, you've got your dad's story, you've got your story. I think throughout some of your stories, you and I have a lot in common with working with our dads, which might be kind of fun. But, start with Chateau Montelena. What's the history?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWell, Montelena, by, oh, well, it was ... Let's, just start at the beginning. So, as we see, now, with the earliest success of Napa Valley, 1845 to 1860-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBy 1880, some money was starting to flow in. Because we've gotta remember, Napa Valley was started by the farmers, like Krug for example.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nStarted, started the Charles Krug Winery. And, um, you know, with the Trefethens, and all those old, wooden structures. But then, along came people like Alfred Tubbs, Senator Alfred Tubbs, or you know, the guys that started Far Niente. So, when, like we see today, some people with money saw what was happening and the potential to make great wine in Napa Valley. So, some of the wealthier people came in, and provided the capital that really started California where we started getting, you know, winning gold medals in Paris in the pre-Prohibition, it was by 1888 to-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... 1890.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nLate 1800's.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo Montelena was real successful. Alfred Tubbs, our founder, built the winery, named it the A.L. Tubbs Winery.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nUh, built, it was, the winery was, the vineyards were planted in 1882. And the winery was built in 1886.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThat's-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd it was state of the art.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWow.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt was a stone winery, 'cause you gotta remember, like, Krug, for example, the wineries here were made out of redwood. So they froze in the winter and baked in the summer.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, when he went to France, because he had this whaling fleet, so Tubbs had a cordage company. And as-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHuh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... a result, he had ships that sailed all around the world. So, he hired a European architect. And still, we do know the original one.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHuh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThe winery was credited to the Napa Valley architect, Hamden McIntyre. But it is not one of his buildings.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBecause now we're on the National Registry of Historic Places. So we know it is not a McIntyre building, like Far Niente, for example.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt's very different. So, anyway, the winery's successful. By about 1890, it's the fourth largest winery in Napa Valley. It's bigger than Beringer.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI didn't know that.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nReally?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt was. And he also started the Napa Valley Co-op, which is w- at that time, 'cause it, and again, going in the time machine in the history of Napa Valley, they would put the wine in barrels, and then put it on barges and take it to the city.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd the merchants in the city would then, you know, step on it, and to use a drug colloquial term -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs)\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs). They would cut it with stuff from like Lodi or wherever. And so, then, and they had a, there was only two wine merchants in California. And they definitely were conspiring to drive the prices down. So A.L. Tubbs being a very savvy businessman from San Francisco, he basically founded the co-op, where that the growers up here then had the fighting power to go against this monopoly.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd keep the prices up. So, he was a, he was a very active guy in the early days of-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHow neat.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nNapa Valley. And his winery, it was quite large. Um, in his first year in 1886-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... they did 137,000 gallons of wine.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWow.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd that is actually the agreed stipulated agreement. What we produce today at Montelena, we actually don't make that much. But in year one, day one, year one, first harvest-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThey did that much.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThey made 100,000, 130,000 gallons.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWhich is how many cases? That's, uh-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nLike 70, 80.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah. 70, 80,000 cases.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nBut-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut remember they didn't use cases.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThat's right. That's right. That's because they were making, basically, bulk. Selling, selling, so they didn't really bottle it right here, they sold it bulk, and merchants bottled it. Is that-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat's correct-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... how it was? Okay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... in San Francisco. It was the Uncle Sam Company, and the, the name is still lasts through today, not quite as big as it was during our life, but Groezinger's Wine Company-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight, right.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo the two merchants in San Francisco were Uncle Sam Wine Company-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... which I still think that's a great one. And Groezinger's. So those are the two merchants in San Francisco that controlled the market.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnd you -\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nKind of like the Gallo and Bronco of the day.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it. And so-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... you've done the research. What were they, what were they making? Do you know what grapes would, or varietals they were making? Or was it just kind of red, kind of white?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nOddly enough, we, we've only, so far, most of the bottles we've ever found for, for from the post-Prohibition periods. 'Cause his grandson, Chapin Tubbs restarted the winery. So, the winery is very successful, of course, over time.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nA.L. Tubbs dies. Prohibition comes along. The winery goes out of business. His grandson had a stop-start through 1932 through '36. But by-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n...really by the beginning of World War II, Montelena was closed up for good. And, uh-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, happily, so. You know, Prohibition, it's quite interesting. The, at the Bank of America foreclosure sale-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThe brands went with it. You know, when they say, “Lock, stock, and barrel.” There's a, there's a ... armaments, you know, reference to that, but also in prohibition, lock, stock, and barrel is, you know, the barrel, the stock inside, and the lock on the door. So during Prohibition years when they sold off a winery, it was lock, stock, and barrel.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nLock, stock, and barrel.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. So, and-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nStrangely, yeah. So, Montelena goes long, sleepy. It's been abandoned, the roof's collapsed, the vineyards are down. And I'll circle back, here. To-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... what the original plans-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd just let me finish the history.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nNo, no, I love it. Don't worry about it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, what happened was, they go belly up in about '38, '39. And they sell the brand, Chateau Montelena gets picked up by a guy, that is where Freemark Abbey is now. I think it was called Martini, or something like that.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI'm gonna jump in. It was called Chateau Montelena then? Or was this-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nNo, that was in the '30s.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, that so, during prohibition, they operated as Montelena Orchards and Montelena Vineyards.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay, okay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo some of the vineyards actually did survive prohibition. Yes, most, a lot of it was planted to prunes-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... during that period of time. So, and we got the- when we got there in '72, there was still some prunes.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut, so, then, they operate as Montelena Vineyards. So his grandson, Chapin Tubbs, is the one who came up with the name Chateau Montelena.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo he came up with that. 'Cause that was one of my questions-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, and so that's the prohibition.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... later, it's like where did that come from? Cool.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nExactly. So, yeah. So, they came from Montelena Orchards.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMontelena Orchards, that was the-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat was a Prohibition farming company name.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... origin. Got it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd obviously, Mount Saint Helena, you know, being at the foot of Mount Saint Helena-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, happy for those, who, those of us who drink once in a while, it's like, did ...\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt's not Chateau Mount Saint Helena, it's, you know, Chateau Montelena.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMontelena.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nOr, my dad used to call it, Chateau Monteleoni.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut, anyway.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBack to the history that, yesterday that, so, really a story about Napa Valley in the early days, in the '72 when we're gonna restart the winery.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo they had sold to, to the guys over at Freemark Abbey, and then the brand later got sold to Bob Trinchero's dad. So, Sutter Home has it.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSutter Home had the Chateau Montelena brand name.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat's correct.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHe had the trademark, the TTB brand name. And for free, for $0, because it needed to go back, Bob Trinchero gave us the name back.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHe did?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat's what kind of, that's the kind of welcome we got to Napa Valley, when we got here, yeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWell, the Trinchero family is still great.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYes. They're just the best. And he's still one of my good buddies, as you know, so-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut, yeah, it was just, just very welcoming when we got here.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHow cool.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut what they had planted when I got there ... So, now, we had the prohibition varieties, when I got there.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, we had, I don't know if you ever talked to the podcast before about, you know, Bergers or Sauvignon Vert?\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nOkay those-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWe have some of that planted here.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nRight. Those were the Thompson seedless of the day.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo they were just bulk, cheap, high producers, you know, probably dry farm, doing like eight, ten tons an acre-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... you know, so, eight by eight, or ten by ten vineyards. So, Sauvignon Vert. Then we had some Alicante Bouschet-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWhich, that was, we actually crushed some of that. And, uh, we had Mondeuse.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd we had Petite Sirah and quite a bit of Zinfandel. So, when we got there in '72, my dad's idea was to make a great Cabernet vineyard. Because of the elevation, and the soil, and our, you know, we're on the Napa River, so we have a-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nMontelena's on the alluvial fan of the Napa River. So if you know about Napa, historically, a lot of the great vineyards, here, on the alluvial fan is whether it's Araujo, Caymus-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThe To-Kalon.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd so, our alluvial fan is of the Napa River itself. So, you know, as you go down, you know, the Three Palms -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThey're all ... So we got that. So, and everybody said, “Okay, Cabernet's gonna be the future.” And my dad had really wanted to make Cabernet. So as we replanted, we took out everything except the Zin, and the Mondeuse, and the Pets. And so-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWhen I started working in the cellar in '73, we were still crushing a little bit of, Zinfandel, Mondeuse, and Petite Sirah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, and, but those went away in our '74 plantings, that's when we really, uh, swept over most. And so the only original vineyards we have from that period are some, we have two acres of Zinfandel left. From-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... uh, 1968, I think.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nNice.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd we have about five left of the 1970, no, seven left of the 1974 Cab.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nCool.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, our legacy stuff.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nCool. Coming back to the history, because I've gotta bring this up. You know, there's this ... You guys have a, a lake on the property, right by the Chateau. And the reason (laughs) I bring it up is 'cause, I remember a couple of toga parties -\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah. But, um, a little side note, Bo used to host toga parties after harvest.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAfter we were all beat, and so, uh, it was always a great-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt was actually at like-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... get together.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n80% through harvest when everybody would be-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah. You know. Yeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt's kind of like the cowboys riding into town and really cutting loose.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs). And still -\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd the people like Doug would ask me, “What should I bring” I said, “Bring a wheelbarrow for your wife to cart you home in.” (laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs). Um-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut, yeah, the toga parties, there's nothing like a bunch of people in sheets -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nUh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... paddling around a lake in the Chinese junk.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nBut the lake. So, so tell me, Jade Lake. Where'd that, where'd that come from? Was that your dad?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nNo, not at all. So, we actually have the ad. So, the heirs and descendants of Alfred Tubbs -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n...were land rich and cash poor. So, over the years, the properties got sold and broken up. And the 16 acres that the winery sits upon was sold in the early '60s to a Chinese guy named Yort Frank Wing.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHuh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYort Frank Wing's family had fled the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. But he grew up in Los Angeles -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh, wow.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n...so, he had had to leave China when he was an infant, or a very young man. So, when he got Chateau Montelena, he had just the winery and the grounds -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs), Uh-huh (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... right in front of it, right by the Napa River, there.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, he decided to build a lake -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... and build a Chinese garden. So, Yort Frank Wang. So he only owns the 16 acres, and he's not operating the winery, clearly.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd we still have, if you come to our tasting room and visit, on the, you know, the displays, you can see the advertisement from about 1965 in the Chronicle. And -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... it says, you know, “Old Chateau Available for Retreats, Spa, Hotel, Restaurant.” Not one single mention of wine. That's how sleepy the wine world was.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWow.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, because before your dad and my dad got here, there is no question. Even as late as 1976, they're saying, “Napa Valley used to be the center of American wine making.”\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n\"But now it's clearly Modesto.” And that was as late as '76. So -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWe've gotta compare those stories in a second -\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. So, but, so, anyways, Yort Frank built a Chinese lake. And then, as crazy as it might -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... seem, over where the Araujo’s are now.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nUh, that was the Eisele Vineyard.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nRight?\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nOkay. So, Eisele... Yort Frank has a Caterpillar that he used to build the lake, right? And old D-4, six-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight, right, yeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, the one with the cables -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... on the front. So he's got this Cat. And Eisele wants to build a pond.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd he's got, guess what? A 26-foot Chinese junk that he bought in Seattle. So they (laughs), so Yort Frank trades the Caterpillar for the Chinese junk and puts it on Jade Lake. So that's why we had that junk-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThat, it, we ...\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... that we used to party on.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nIs it still there? No.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nNo.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nIt's long gone.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt'd be-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nDid it sink?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIf the insurance company called it I, wha- (laughs)\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWhen you were out there, it sank all the time.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo what we decided to do was fill up with that Formula two part foam, kind of how great stuff is, now?\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThere was this foam. So we filled the bilge s-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... with this foam -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... so it wouldn't sink.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWe were young and stupid. We didn't understand ballas t-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... all that well-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n...that the boat's not supposed to float that high. So that's why it was-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWell, you just, you-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... so tippy, and when we had the party, everybody fell (laughs) in the pond.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah, it's not young and stupid. It's just-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... we didn't have the nautical background. That's all. It's just, you know-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWe had this-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nIt's all about experience.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. But, the lake ... And then, so, over the years, and he had built the plywood pavilions and stuff, and then-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWhen I went to China, probably ten years ago, and I was giving a talk on, actually, the history of American Chardonnay in Beijing.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nRight before the Americans started it, you know, trying to import into the PRC. I saw, at the summer palace, what Jade Lake was supposed to look like.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd subsequently bought all the Chinese tiles. And that's where the upgrade, now. So, now it really is a, is a very good American version of the, uh, summer palace in Beijing.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nVery cool.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nVery cool. So, getting to your dad, 'cause I'm real curious about it. Because I don't know your dad's story, and how he got to Napa Valley. But, so where'd your dad grow up? Where'd, where'd he come from?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWell, he was born in the south side of Chicago, in the Irish ghettos. My grandparents were Irish immigrants. I actually still have them, you know, EU-Irish Passport.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThat's right.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYep. So I got that. But, so, I grew up, and his father was a fireman, and a railroad cop. And, and then he also worked for Sears Roebuck, during the day.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, he was a railroad cop at night, um, my grandparents had met in the U.S., didn't like it. Oh, they had gone back to Ireland, uh, one-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHuh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... of the brothers was either born or conceived there, the middle brother Vincent. And then he moved back to the U.S. for good, uh, I don't know the exact years.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut it was definitely after World War II. Uh, he got his citizenship in the U.S. working for the Navy in World War I. So, we have always been a hard-core Navy family. My dad served in the Navy -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... submarines, my uncle's buried at Annapolis. He was a rear admiral.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, a big time Navy family. But, anyway, my uncle got transferred to Los Angeles when my dad was eight. So, he grew up in Los Angeles.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHuh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd, like the Irish trifecta, it was four kids, the, the youngest daughter passed away early. But, the first brother, Annapolis grad.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWow.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nRear admiral. Next one, priest. Monsignor.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd the next one was an attorney. So -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nMy dad used to say it his mom was so proud, 'cause it was the Irish trifecta.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know?\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut my father, uh-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnd he was, he was the attorney?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYour dad-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHe's the attorney.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHe got it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, uh, he was an attorney in southern California. And his lead client was the, uh, a guy named Ernie Hahn and there's-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... two companies in the U.S. that say they invented the regional shopping center, aka mall, the Di Bartolos and the Hahn Companies. So, as the Hahn Company started building malls around the world, my father was his lead guy. And by the time he was getting ready to do something else, he did 30 years, he had had like 36 lawyers, and all these people, and all they did was real estate and tax development.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHe did 30 years as a lawyer?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat's right. Yeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHe didn't get to move, you know, we won the Paris Tasting in '76. But he didn't get to move to Napa Valley 'til about '85.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay. That's what-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHe was a lawyer for a long time.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThat's what my question was. Because since he bought the property, '72 you said.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, late '71.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nLate '71. So, okay. Before we go any further, what was the, was he, was he a wine guy? Was he into wine?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nNot at all. What happened was, as his clientele got more and more sophisticated, you know, 'cause he'd come out of the Navy, and he still, you know, 'til the day he died, continued to drink Jack Daniels and stuff like that.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nJack and soda. And, um, so, what happened was, as his clientele became more and more sophisticated, he had to go to these, you know ... fancy dinners-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThe dinners.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... at like the Brown Derby, and all these, you know-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... what was Piero Selvaggio's restaurant in L.A.?\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nValentino's?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nValentino, yeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo he's down in L.A.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo he's in L.A. So he just-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHe decides that he has to learn about wine.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nUh-huh (affirmative). Funny.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo to learn about wine, he goes up to the UCLA extension.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo the night class at UCLA, Chroman, Nathan Chroman, famous name in the business. So, old Chroman's teaching the UCLA Appreciation of Wine extension class. And my dad learns four things.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWell, really, one thing. That the great wines of the world are German Riesling,\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... Burgundy, Chardonnay, and Pinot. And so that's just one. We'll just call it, Chardonnay and Pinot the same thing.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat's, you know-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBurgundy, basically-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... as one. The Rhone wines, and-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... the Grand Cru of Bordeaux.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo that's what he did, so that's how my father learned about wine. And I was in high school at this time and I'm sitting there at the dinner table, and, you know, my dad's got this bottle of wine. And I, you know, my dad has not been drinking wine. Like, seriously, my brothers and I are his-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... bartenders. And we're making Tom Collins, and-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSure.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... gin and tonics, and-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGin, gin and tonics.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nI cannot remember pulling any glasses of wine at all these big parties that they would have, you know-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... at my house in Palos Verdes. My dad would have big parties. And we were the bartenders, and seriously, I can remember learning how to make a Tom Collins, and a gin and tonic-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... and all this kind of stuff. But nobody ever asked for wine. So I see my dad with a bottle of Chardonnay as it's the Bouchard Père & Fils, the real one? You gotta little Amon Rouche . And he goes, “Gol, man, this is amazing. You gotta taste this.” I was probably 15. And it was pretty amazing.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWell, this, okay, I gotta, I gotta stop you quick. Don't don't lose your train of thought. But, we're tracking the same way. So I'm in Chicago. Dad, Mom, they're, you know, cocktails. Bourbon and beer. There was never wine in the house. Same thing. My brothers and I would bartend parties. (laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYep.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnd so I remember this lady teaching me how to shoot gin and tonics. So, like I had a shot glass, Dad said, you just pour a shot of gin, and then fill it up with tonic, and so I did. The lady looks at me, she goes, “Honey, let me show you how to make a real drink.” (laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nShe basically did a, a shot glass full of tonic and filled it with gin instead.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. (laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nBut, how funny. So that's, uh, because dad, you know, a lot of people I run into and say, “Oh, how cool that your dad was into wine and did this.” It's like, No. He did it because he heard it as a good investment. Like he came out, it was the, the wine boom was coming. So that's where he came from.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, when-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo how, so did your, but now, but yours started getting into wine. So is that what triggered it to come up to here?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nNo. And so this is a ... that ... and you know that, that you've heard it in our business, the class of '72, or the class of '73?\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWhere all the sudden 25 wineries start up all of a sudden. And-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou might have been at that CEO conference where I talked about that.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n'Cause you gotta remember, in '72, the Vietnam war is raging.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThe combined tax rate, the federal tax rate's like 73 to 78% because they have the war surcharges. And so, so what happened was, we've got John Connelly as the Speaker of the House. And the, you know, the taxing and Richard Nixon's President. And they conspired to write a tax law signed, gotta remember, my dad's a tax and real estate attorney.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nIt's his, right in his wheelhouse.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nRight. So, the, the, I, the Restoration Act, I'd actually have to look at my notes to find the exact name of it. But basically, there was a whole - and American agriculture was also dying at the same time. So we have this really crushing tax rates-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... uh, the Vietnam War, things are not going all that great in '72. So, to reinvigorate American agriculture, they pass a reinvestment tax credit where whole dollars. So if you make $1,000,000 on your shopping center development you can put that $1,000,000 into agriculture and not pay the 78 taxes, but you ... 78% tax. But you can put the whole dollars to work in American agriculture. And if you th- that's right.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWow.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou're looking at me ... now-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI'm looking, I'm looking-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... this is passed for the Midwest. This is for Tannico, and all the giant agribusiness stuff.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut what happened, what Napa really needed was the money. 'Cause, you know, you own a winery, you know wineries run on two things, money and water.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, this, this business is insane, how much money we have to invest, where you're growing grapes for five years. And then you get-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nEquipment.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... to buy barrels, and you get to buy a bottling line, then you get to buy a warehouse, and a forklift, and more people, and-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnd then you get to sell wine.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt's just insane.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs). I remember the first time my dad was bragging to his buddies, he goes, “We finally made a million bucks.” And he goes, “You did all that work, plant those-\"\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n\"... grapes, crush them, and what what? For a lousy million bucks?”\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah and it took ya-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt's like-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n...it took ya 15 years.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nTalk about getting your balloon popped. Oh, yeah. It took more than that. But, so, anyway, um-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, basically, my dad's job was to find an agricultural enterprise for his clients.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo they looked at cattle. And in those days, you know, nobody in the United States knew what an avocado was, much less a pomegranate. You know?\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAll this, and so the oranges, there's taxes and stuff. So my dad really went around, he was a pilot by that time. And he had his airplane. He flew all around California. Luckily I got to go with sometimes, and we'd go look at cattle operations. You know, I only went on a couple, but he went on a lot.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo we looked at some cows, we looked at some oranges. And the pomegranates and avocados, all that stuff. And none of were ha- were getting to any traction. So, they're up at like the Brown Derby, again, or Valentino in L.A.-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd they're drinking a bottle of Mondavi Cab. (laughs). And the way my dad always told the story, is he takes a sip of the wine, and all of the sudden, he just went, “What about this stuff?\", as he points to the bottle.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd that's, so, that. And he's, the next, probably, day or two, he was up here, flew up to Santa Rosa. Started looking around-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo he, he was on a search.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. He was on a search. He was looking for an agricultural investment.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nA product.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd, I'm, and I am quite sure that, you know, I've told, you know, the Wetzels, and stuff like that, 'cause a lot of their dad's, because I was so involved with my dad, you know, that he thought I was gonna be a lawyer, too, so as we went along, he was, you know, keeping me a press, uh-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... apprised of all these, um, the complexities of life. Um, where, you know, people think of us that are successful in our business that we're just, you know, farmers, and grape growers, and I go to great lengths to say, “Oh, you know, aw shucks. I'm just a grape grower, and working hard.”\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut the fact of the matter is, is, you know, half the time, we have to be a lawyer, and a diplomat, and a politician, and, you know, fight hard for things like the direct to shipping thing.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative)\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd all the things we've done in our careers, you know, a lot of it is making wine is the fun part. You know?\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut some of the more heavy lifting that you and I have done of things like the direct shipping, and all these, all these things-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAh just-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n...that we've, that we've made the difference in. So, anyway. That's how we got into it, basically, a class at L.A. and looking for real estate investment.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nCame up here, and looked around, found, so he found this place. So he found, it was all, it was abandoned at that point.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat's right, yeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThe Chateau.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThe roof had collapsed in two places, the vineyards were totally run down. Uh, the winery was actually on a separate parcel. It had to be reunited with 100 acres of-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... the vineyard. So that was the first thing. And, a guy had got here, Lee Passage our first partner, who had actually successfully done that. So, Lee Passage got the name back from Bob Trinchero.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHe didn't give it to Jim Barrett, he gave it to Lee Passaage, one of our first partners. And then, we started replanting the vineyard. But my father knew that he didn't know, really, anything about farming, seriously.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... to the day he died, you know, you see in the movies, he's in the winery, and stuff, no. You know.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIf you told him, “Hook up this disc and pull down that row, or we'll shoot your dog.” The dog would die.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThe dog would die.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs). Oh, no.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, or hook up this pump and empty this barrel, or crush these grapes, the dog's gonna die.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThe dog- (laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, yet, but he was a v- excellent, excellent, along the lines of Ronald Reagan. A very laissez faire, a hard task master, and a very fair, what would you call it, not a dictator, but, benevolent monarch.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nNo, he, he spoke his mind and it was by ... I, I adored your dad. He-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... was a g-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI loved seeing him, it was great.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, so, so he put together a team, and, uh, our first vineyard manager that was his first hire, his name was John Rolleri. John Rolleri had plowed grapes for Madame Du Pins with a mule. That's how long-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... his experience was. And so-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWow.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nOur first vineyard manager, the day he came to work, he was my age, now, 65. He was an old guy.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n'Cause in those days, 65 was actually pretty old.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nNowadays, it's like, bah, doesn't matter.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nNo.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nNo way.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut, but, but anyway so he got that, and then, he hired this wine maker Mike Grgich, who had a pretty good, uh, track record.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah, where'd, where'd Mike come from at that point?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nMike, you probably read Dick Peterson's book.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHe was over there. He was a lab tech over at BV. And I believe he was a lab tech over at Mondavi, too. And then I think he was on the wine making team at Mondavi.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThat's right, I think you're right.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut, uh, you know, it's, with all these wineries, that were starting in '72, it was, you know, a great opportunity for Mr. Grgich, and he did, he did a great job for us, you know. Clearly, he was-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, he was, so, that was, you know, if you look at me, I did my, uh, apprenticeship under Mike Grgich, you know.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd then after we won the Paris Tasting course, you know, he took off to start Grgich Hills. So-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight but-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... more power to him.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI'm with you. So, I'm going back. So your dad buys it '71, '72, you get the vineyard go- so you had 100 acres of vineyard.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nRight.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWhich was great. And then, uh, you're fixing up the winery to getting going. First crush was '72?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat's right.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnd, but your Dad's still, he lived in L.A. and he kept lawyering? So-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nRight, yeah. Because in '72, we had to replant the vineyard.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo we don't make the estate cabernet until 1978.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBecause we plant in ‘72 and '74. So we don't have enough grapes until we crush the '78. '78, at that time, we were on a four year cycle. So, the, I was like 30 months in barrels, not the typical 20, 24-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... we're using nowadays.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo it was a four year cycle under capsule. We're not selling our first estate cabernet until 1982.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd so, is that gonna work or not? We don't know. So, that's why he doesn't get to really wind down his law business 'til about '85.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo he kept, he wanted to, he kept his day, day job.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHe kept it.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSmart guy. Okay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHe, yeah. Yeah, he-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo he-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHe had to keep his day job.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nExactly.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it. Okay. S- just for fun, we moved here in '73. Same type of, 30 acres of 60 year old vines, same varieties you mentioned. You know, Dad started to develop Hillside Cab. His first vintage they bottled was '78. Sold it in '81. He wanted to get going fast.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nRight.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWell, that, if you think about back to, you know, my dad had gone to that UCLA class.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd if you look at Chateau Montelena today, you know, 40 something years later-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWhat do we make Riesling, German ... remember? The four wines from UCLA: Riesling-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRiesling.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... Chardonnay, Zinfandel, Cabernet. The Zinfandel, put an equal sign, equals our Rhone wine.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd so, that's what we make, and we still have some.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYou still make the four wines.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, we still make the four wines. (laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYou still make 'em.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. We still got Riesling, too. So, but basically, that was a cash flow deal. See, 'cause the Riesling's a one year wine. You crush it in-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... September, October, you can start selling it, basically, the following June. So it's, and the next year, you get to start selling Riesling. Chardonnay, at that time, was a two year wine.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nZinfandel was a three year wine. And then the Cabernet -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnd Cabernet was a four.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... was an eight to 10 year project.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo the Chardonnay and the Riesling, and the Zinfandel were all cash flow products to get the winery up and running, and to basically fund, uh, the-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... the Cabernet program.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd it worked, you know.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nIt worked.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, yeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo, circling back to you, you're growing up in Palos Verdes.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHeh (laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYou graduate from high school right around-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n'72.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nDad's bought the winery. And so-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYep.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWhat happened to you? Where'd you go to - well, wait. What was, what was high school like?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHa.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI don't remember hearing about it. What'd you do?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWell, I went, I was incarcerated-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... in sports, what?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... at Bishop Montgomery High School, the Catholic high school-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... incarcerated.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt was about-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nIncarcerated.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt was all the way down in Torrance. We lived in Palos Verdes in a town called Lunada Bay. It's now called Rancho Palos Verdes.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt's all the million dollar houses. When I grew up, out there, it was garbanzo beans and barley-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... and strawberries, of all things.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nNo, seriously, it was. It was all farms out there. So I had a really good free-range childhood. You know, at the, going out into the ocean, uh, my Huck Finn days were completely at the ocean. Uh-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nRa- you know-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nUh, shooting fish, and roasting 'em on the beach kind of thing. Building forts out of driftwood, it was a very, um-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nFun.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... like I said, it was a very free-range childhood. Mostly, around the ocean and water, then in high school, I played water polo, swam-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... did not play football or baseball, that stuff. Yeah, I was always, always aquatic-based.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAlways was on the beach.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAlways on the beach. Um, but then, when I graduated from high school, um, Pa- Palos Verdes is quite famous for, there was a very tribal, surf zone wars. My beach, my wave, my girl. And it was being quite violent. And I didn't like that at all.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWere you a surfer?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, definitely.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nEarly days. Like when they gave us the surf leash after Jack O'Neill invented the, uh, invented the lea- Do you know why Jack O'Neill had eye patch? You know, in the O'Neill wet suits? The eye patch?\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Why?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n'Cause he invented the surf leash. The first one was all shock cord.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd it broke and knocked his eye out.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThe, the thing he invented-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... (laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh, no.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, Jack O'Neill. He's one of the greats of the aqua, aquatic world.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYou know, I learned more s- things on this, this, doing this podcast. (laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nOkay. So, anyway, so, my dad ... So I graduated from high school-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... and my dad says, “What are you gonna do now?” I said-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n\"I wanna surf.” He goes, \"Where are you gonna live? I said, “Oh, well, right here.” He goes, “Great.” My dad's a successful lawyer, we've got a Mexican cook and she-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... makes tacos for me at lunch every day.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHe goes, “No. In this family.” Remember, the Irish immigrant parents. “In this family, you gotta be a full-time student or have a full-time job to live in this house.” That's the bad news-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI just love your dad.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat's the bad news.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nNo, he, he was tough. And, but, tough in a good way. And, so, I said, “Okay, well ...” You know, and in high school, I was clearly one of the guys that just looked out the window the whole time. I-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nMy brother got way, my brothers and sisters got way better grades than I did. I always maintained a B average. Because if I got a B average, I could go ski and take weeks off in the winter, and stuff like that.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHow, how many siblings?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nFive.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nFive.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. So, I, I'm-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo six kids.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nI'm the oldest boy.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, one ... oldest daughter, three boys in a row, and then, uh, a baby sister.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGreat.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, I was the oldest of the boys. And so, I had to always set the example- of\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... the oldest son, you know, that deal. So, anyway, um, he said, “I can get you a job at the construction company. And I can get you a job at the vineyard. I want you to try out both this year.” So I went down and poured concrete, building shopping centers with the Hahn company, for about $7.50 an hour in 1972. Really huge union money. Big money.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nBig money.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nI got to buy a motorcycle to commute to work in, and stuff like that. And we were building, I think that one was in, maybe Long Beach or Anaheim-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nKinda out there. So, I poured concrete for about a month and a half. And then, I decided, he goes, “Go try the winery, now.” And they-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... were making a dollar an hour.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs). And look what job I chose as a career. (laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n$1.00 an hour.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n$1.00, yeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo you come up through wineries. So, and Grgich is at the winery.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nRight. Though the winery's not really running yet. This-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... was '72. So, the 1968, uh, Zinfandel had to be watered with a bucket. So that was my job, was basically-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh, my gosh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... pull the old grape gondolas and trailers, and a five gallon bucket-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nA buck- walking through the fields.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... you dig a ditch around each vine-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... dump in the bucket. And then, pulling star-thistle by hand. And then, by '74, I was working summers, you know, putting in end posts and stuff.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut then, Grgich he liked my work product and he moved me to the cellar in '73. So the first harvest, I worked was '73.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it. So, uh, and, and you've been there ever since.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWell, meanwhile, so, I started working there, and I worked all summer long. And I said, “To hell with this. I want to go to college, too.”\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. So-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay. That's cool. All right good.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. So I decided to go to college. And, uh-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... hard, hard labor-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou'll appreciate my dad.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMy-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThe first day, the Snowbird tram was open, he, the first lift, we were on the second lift. Not the first, the first day the Snowbird tram was open, he had me and my brothers out there to ski Snowbird.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYou dog.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nI know. The first-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYou dog.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... that was 1971.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n1971.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThe winter of '71-'72, Snowbird opens. First day we're there.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAll right. Time out, time out, time out. You're a surfer. You're a beach boy. When did you get into skiing?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nMy dad got us into that.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHe, no, my dad got me into all the fun stuff in the world. He dove, he skied.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAll right.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHe flew airplanes. Uh, so all the stuff that I still-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... do today-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnother thing-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd I told you I just came back from a dive-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... trip. My whole family dives-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... and skis. So, I grew up, like my dad, he was, he was, he liked the outdoors.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay. Don't lose your Snowbird. I'm gonna come back to it. But, gotta jump in. Same deal. Chicago, Illinois, Dad took up skiing at 20, 21. And turned us all on.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYep.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nFrom age nothing to, you know. And he used to, we used to ski these little, wimpy hills, and ... Well, not wimpy. There are hills in Wisconsin. But, but then he'd drag us out west. And went to Vail and all that stuff. And he and his buddies discovered Alta Utah, just a mile up the road from Snowbird. And so right about the same time, I'm like a sophomore in high school. He was dragging us out to Alta, Utah. Because I remember Snowbird was opening and we thought that was the new, cool thing. But it was a really cool thing. All right. So you're on the second tram up.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah well but it's also like this, we were from L.A. and my dad was a-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n...we were told a Alta Park City. My dad, like I said, if I got a 3.2 average, he'd let me and my brother take a week off of school during the middle of winter. And we would take the train, two boys, like, 13 and 12, we got to go with the local ski club from L.A. Path Ski Club. And he would let us go on the train, by ourselves, stay in the dorms at Park City or Alta Gold Miner's Daughter, you remember, that-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGold Miner's Daughter, yeah. (laughs). I know it well.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd so, and he would let us. And we'd go out there, by ourselves, and ski. And then we'd get on the-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWow.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... train and come home. It was, like I said, it was a very free-range childhood. It was awesome. So our dads were the same. It was like-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMy father-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... they were encouraging us to get into the good things of life. So-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nVery cool.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nLike I said, my, my neighborhood is getting into this very tribal ... There's actually book about it. The-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh, yeah. Yeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... tribes of Palos Verdes and stuff. And it became part of southern California surf lore for those-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, those of us on the West Coast, they're into the surfing, and, you know, I still surf a little bit. Not ... In waves about waist-high, now.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nI'll only stand up, because of my back. But-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... the, um. So with that, I decided to go to the University of Utah. And my dad-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... said, “That's great. I'll pay for your tuition and your books.” And I said, “Well, what am I gonna eat?” He says, “Eat snow. I know where to go in Utah.” I said, “Where am I gonna live?” He goes, “Live on your skis. I know where you're gonna ... “ So I actually had to take my hard-earned money-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... from the winery, and then, be ... and so then ... And then, he was right. I went, I took classes at the University of Utah. So I, I'm a Ute. I went to the University of Utah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAfter 3:00 in the afternoon. So whatever they had: oceanography, chasseur whatever it was. 'Cause I, remember, I'm gonna be a lawyer, and his judge buddies have said, “It doesn't matter. Your BA or BS doesn't matter. The law school barely matters. It's just, pass the bar. And then work hard.” 'Cause the law business is a lot like ours, actually. Everybody gives Harvard all the credit, 'cause the rabbits get into Harvard. But, really, the snails or the tortoises are the ones who really are the best lawyers.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nInteresting. Interesting.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut, anyway, so I s-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo you're saying-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... spent four years-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYou're, Y-You're skiing-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... four whole years.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYou got four years?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nFour winters, skiing 100 days a year. So I had work at the winery, never had a car-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... always had, always pick, choose your roommates carefully. Pick one with a good four-wheel drive car to drive you up skiing.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd, uh, so, then, the, by '76, I had found out there was, that's before Red Bull, or anything like that.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd we were into mountaineering. So, I decided to, uh, go to Fresno State. And so, I switched over to-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nBut you did four years at Utah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nDid you get-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWith part-time. Only two semesters.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... a degree, or just part-time?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n'Cause I never went up, 'cause I always worked, uh, summer and fall.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo I would really leave the winery when things get slow after the harvest, just like-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... when you let cut your interns loose, basically, that was my job. I was the summer and fall-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSummer and fall.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... full-time intern, yeah. And, so then, I go to Utah, and when I ran out of money, I'd, uh, go up to Idaho Falls and fish for a while, and then when I really ran out of money-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nI'd come back and start working the cellar around May. So I usually did May through the end of November at the winery. And that is until I went to Fresno State in '76.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo '76 Fresno State. Now, Fresno State, and what'd you study?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWell, viticulture and enology. Again, you gotta get in your time machine. In 1976, UC Davis, enology is under fermentation science.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt is not part of the, it's not part of the Ag school yet. I don't, I don't know, I didn't go to Davis, so I don't know when they combined 'em there. So I went to, was accepted to both the University of Davis and Fresno. So I go to uh, Davis, and I'm talking to 'em I said, “Well, um, I have a bit of work in a small winery, I need to do viticulture and enology.” They said, “Oh, that's perfect. You can get your bachelor's in one, and then your master's in the other.” And I said, “How long is that gonna take?” They said-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nLike six years.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n\"Oh, six or seven years.”\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd this is '72. The wine business, or this is '76, the wine business is exploding, right?\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nI go down to Fresno, and this is a true story. So I go to Fresno, same thing. Go in and start talking to the guys at the department, the, uh, counselor.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nI said, “Well, what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna be a winemaker, and I need to manage a small winery. So I need to do ... I don't need to do microbiology. I need to do the business management stuff.” 'Cause Fresno had a pretty good business school at the time. And that, and, and I'm not kidding, in one day, in four hours, I went from that counselor to see Vince Petrucci. Vince Petrucci walk me across the street to see the dean, and his name was King. And so I went from, so I got to, Petrucci was second, I talked to the enology next.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd then he got me in front of Vince, Vince Petrucci. The, you guys could look him up, he is just super famous in the California business.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd so-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI've heard of him.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... Vince, then, walks me across the street to talk to the Dean. This is in the same day, no appointment and I walk up there, and I tell the dean exactly my same story. He goes, “Great. We'll put you in AgEcon as your minor.”\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n“And, uh, and then you can take all the business classes.” And he waved me in and that was in one day. So that's why I went to Fresno State. And then I said, “But I need to take 20 units at a whack.” He goes, “Well, see how you do on the first 15.” So the dean ... So, then, I had to go see him after every semester and, 'til eventually I was taking like 22 units. And, uh-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, I got a -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWell-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nI was a man on a mission at that point.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWell, okay. But that's, that's the difference. So, at that point, you know, you, you'd had those four years, and you're skiing, and you're working in the winery, so it's like, not that you got serious, 'cause we'd never want to get serious in our lives. But, you had-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut, I found that there was a job-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYou were, you were-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nI found the ideal job, where you don't have to be in an office all the time. You can earn, at that time, it was an honest living. You know, you gotta remember. Montelena doesn't make any money-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... 'til really about 1990. You know, until we started really being profitable. It took, took forever. But, I found a job where I could be outside most of the time. And, you know, you have a winery. You know, it's not like an office. It's, you go into the winery, it's like your fort with all your friends and your toys. And it's not like having a job. You know, during harvest, you get, the, the stuff, it's, you know, you had tractors, and equipment, and-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nNo.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt's, it's, it's a gas, man.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nIt's ... I'm, I'm, I'm...\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWe track the same way. 'Cause I'm a junior in high school in '73. We move out here, a year and a half finishing up. Dad's, you know, all of the sudden, I'm living on this ranch in this funky little house coming from suburban Chicago. This little, you know ...\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThere's no winery, here. We didn't build the winery 'til '80. You know, but I'm coming back from high school seeing Dad on a tractor, with a shit-eating grin on his face, you know with a straw hat. I've never seen him so happy in my life. I'm working on the weekends, hauling rocks out of the vineyard, hating it but kind of loving it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnd now I see him working with these guys, who, who, their office is a pickup truck. There's the, the, the water consultant, the irrigation guy, the, you know, the guy selling grapevines. And basically, that's when it clicked for me and said, “You know.” 'Cause I didn't know he was gonna do a winery. I just thought he was gonna grow grapes, I really didn't. So, you know, I think he did. But he wasn't telling anybody, including my mom.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnd, when I said... I, I went to Davis to be a farmer. So I went to t- 'cause I just wanted, I wanted to wear jeans and live in a pickup, live, work out of a pickup truck. So I went to Davis to do the viticulture thing. And, uh, the lo and behold, I took some enology, but actually, I went another direction. I said, I wanted to teach, so all of the sudden, I started taking education classes, and went and taught school for a while. But that, too-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat's actually a big part of the job.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nBut the whole, the whole allure of the outdoor thing, you know, not being in an office, and, you know, now 30, 40 years later, I'm in an office most of time, or on an airplane. But, you know, God, you know, this first 10 or 15 years, here in the cellar, you're out in the vineyard. I mean, it's just, it's great. It's a great life.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nIt's fun.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt is.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nDid you know that were gonna have a... Did you know that, you know, you were doing this gig at Fresno State and it was like, you had a job to go to? Did you guys talk-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nNo, not at all.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat, that was a big surprise to me-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n'Cause knowing, knowing your Dad.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWell, what happened, so, we're there, this is before we win the Paris Taste, remember I'm in Fresno.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd you gotta remember, I don't know, your winery was, our winery was, OSHA wasn't really part of our job. And they had a couple of injuries. And so, I was at Fresno and at the California State Ag schools, you can get a waiver out of school and miss some school and not get kicked out. So, I had to go in, so they had a broken arm and a chopped off finger. So, Grgich called me, and said, “Hey, I need some help for like 10 days.” And so, same thing, you go in and tell the guy, “I need to take the, uh- “\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n“... the Ag school waiver for harvest to help out my family business.” So they let me go. And I'm, you know, everything's fine.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd, but, it, not really uh, what happens is, that we win the Paris tasting. And, um, Mike Grgich leaves the company. Basically, the next day. He's off with Austin Hill starting his winery and God bless him.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nGood for him. That's his dream, he's always following his dream, and this is wonderful. But, my dad now doesn't have a winemaker. And Grgich took his whole wine-making team with him.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh, no, no, no, no, no.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThat's, um-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat's the cellar master, Aaron Mosley-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOhhh, no.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThe lead cellar worker, and they left us one recent graduate of Fresno State, Gary Galleron, you know, who Galleron is?\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah. I remember Gary.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo Galleron, Galleron is the only cellar worker, Gustavo Brambila all those guys, they go off to Grgich, 'cause they're loyal to their maestro.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh, man. Like, you know-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnd I can, you know and I can see your dad lighting it up, and he deserves to do as much as he wants. That's, that's-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. No.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThat's tough.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. That was tough. So, but, you know, the golden lining, here, is, unbeknownst to most people, there's a famous American winemaker Jerry Luper.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd he had made all those great Freemark Abbey wines. And then at the Paris tasting. The didn't win, either. You know, the wild card team from five years ago, who the hell was it? Nobody remembers. But, Luper-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIs the only winemaker that had two wines qualify for the Paris tasting. He had the Freemark Chardonnay and the Cabernet Bouchet. So Luper-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI forgot about that.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... Luper is just coming back from France. Now, you gotta remember who Luper trained; me, Tom Rinaldi, Heidi, I mean, this guy's ... He was a absolutely genius maestro. Like, that, whether he really separated himself as, for his own wines, it, to, his strength was his coaching.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHuh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd, so, but anyway, Luper comes back. So my dad lucks out. Now he's got a straight up, straight shooting, honest as the day is long, hard working, really intelligent guy, Jerry Luper. Who's made a lot of good wines and we love him 'cause he's cool, he can play the guitar, he can play Eagles songs, he's-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... got a beard, he's kind of hip. And he's cool. So all the younger guys, uh-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... just like ... so my dad hires Luper. So Luper ... Now, I'm down in Fresno. I don't know any of this is going on.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah. Yeah. 'Cause you were-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo my dad's-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nIn Fresno, yeah-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n...not calling me.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nI'm gone, I'm at Fresno State. So, the, so, Jerry says to, uh, this guy, Gary Galleron, “Hey, I, I need an assistant wine maker, here.” And Galleron says, “You should talk to Bo Barrett. He's down at Fresno State and he worked for Grgich for five years, here.”\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd he's been around. He, I, and, so Galleron says, “He's actually the boss when he comes back here. He's actually Gus' boss when he comes, when he shows up for harvest.” So, Luper calls me up, out of the blue at Fresno. “Hey, this is Jerry.” “Jerry, what are you calling me about?”\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHe goes, “I want you to come to work for me as an assistant winemaker up at Montelena.” I said, “Well, I gotta, I gotta do an independent study this fall.”\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHe goes, “That doesn't matter. You can do an independent study.” So, I guess I only needs like three more units or something at Fresno to get out of there. So, so, actually, so I didn't really, actually work for my Dad 'til '82 when I came back after I'd quit Montelena so I, I worked for Jerry all the way through the harvest of 1980.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo it's, moving up to 1980, the wine business is, now, it's really starting to explode. And people are walking out of Davis, and lead winemaker jobs with no experience whatsoever. Like maybe one internship in France. And so, now I got, you know, at least, you know, five year’s experience as, I've done my apprenticeship from Mike Grgich, my journeymanship with Jerry Luper, I got my credentials from Fresno State. So now, I'm ready to be a, a winemaker.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd so-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n'Cause you'd be, 'cause you'd been more or less at, off and on at Montelena for like eight or nine years.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, for 10.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah, 10 years.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, really, yeah-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... eight or nine years by this time.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, I had told my dad I was ready for, to be a winemaker. And he said, “Good luck.” And he sent me on down the road. (laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI know, I know that ... by the way, I know that conversation.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, yeah, I know- I'm ready to be the winemaker. And he goes, “Jerry's my winemaker. Good luck, kid.” You know? And so, so then I take off.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd, um-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI'm sorry. Mine's(laughs) ... I'm sorry.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, it takes two for that.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI was teaching school, it was my second year, Christmas-time. I was back for Christmas. I knew I was gonna come back to the wine business, you know. And so I was actually said to Dad, and, at this point he had a winery, he had a winemaker. But I just said, “Hey, I'm gonna leave teaching and come back to the wine business.” Never even thinking I was gonna work with him at all. I just wanted to come back and start working in the cellar somewhere. And so, I told him I'd come back to the wine business. He goes, “Well, I don't have a job for you.” (laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. (laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nIt's like, “Wow, can you be a little nicer about that?”\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nBut -\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut it was go- it ended up good, and-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... you know, our d- we learned a lot from our dads. You know, what to do, and what not to do-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... it seems like. But like, my daughter, Chelsea, she's a winemaker down here at Materra now. It's the same, you know, the anti-nepotism thing that our dads taught us it, it's really important-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nVery important.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBecause you see so many wineries that are crushed by nepotism. You know, they get Junior in there, and they're driving his Ferrari, and the winery's in the toilet-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nNo, no-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... five years later-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI'm with ya.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n...And, or wholesalers, you know, we, you, how many times have you seen that happen? Nepotism, it just crushes businesses. But, anyway, so, and then, I was down in, um ... So finally I took a job, it's you know where Ancient Peaks is now? It's called cra- it was called Indian Creek at the time, later, Creston-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nRemember Alex Trebek's place-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIn Creston, California?\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nDown in San Luis Obispo... So, the first winery I designed was, is now Ancient Peaks. Is their tank room, now. But it was a cut and cover, I adapted some Idaho potato technology. The guys didn't have a lot of money. So, I did a cut and cover before it'd been invented. I took it from the, actually, from the spud business. I had seen-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHow fun.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... in Idaho-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHow neat.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n.... so many times, so I did a cut and cover for these guys and it's still working. And so, I was happily designing a winery, gonna start, do this build-out thing. And my dad calls me up, and said, uh, “Jerr- Jerr-” and this was completely out of the blue. I mean, I'm just moved to Fresno. I've only been ... I've been in Creston and, you know, Saint Luis Obispo for, I don't know, b- um-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nA year?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nMaybe six months.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSix months.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSix, eight months-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo it's like '81-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, less than a- it was definitely less than a year.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo I'm all down there, and I got this-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... vineyard it's gonna be 400 acres. It's going to be big. It's going to, it's a good project. I'm like a total monk.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWell, you're the winemaker, right?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, I'm the winemaker. GM, everything. It's like designing the vineyards, I'm just, this whole thing, I got this whole deal. And Dad calls me up, and says, “Hey, I, uh, Jerry got a partnership job.” 'Cause that's when Jerry got the partnership job at Bouchaine. So, Garret and Tatiana had offered Jerry a partnership. Which my dad did not do, 'cause Grgich had been a partner, and getting rid of that partner was not easy. So, my dad, he, You work for Jim, you're not a partner. You know?\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, um-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo Bouchaine down in Carneros\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, he went to Bouchaine in Carneros. And, so now my dad needs a winemaker. And he, and so he goes, “Well, Jerry, who should I hire?” My Dad and Jerry were really tight. It was, it was-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... a tough decision for Jerry. I mean, I'm not kidding. Jerry and I have been trading e-mails this week.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHuh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, okay. He lives in France, now.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI know. Because he, he left town, and there's so many people in this valley, in this business that don't know-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHe, yeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWhat a, A, what a great guy he is and B, what a fantastic winemaker. And what he did, and how many winemakers' lives he touched.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. And, the, his tr- like I said, the training, you know, 'cause the Duckhorn, when Tom Rinaldi was there, you know.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... was there, you know, Heidi, up at La Sirena, I mean, and, uh, not La Sirena but, you know, the Dalla Valle, and the Screaming Eagle, all that stuff. That really, you know, he was the coach that taught us a lot about how to do stuff. Now, Heidi with her dad, that you, you can't downplay that. That's just-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYou can't. (laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut, in my case, you know, and I got to train under Mike Grgich and Jerry Luper. So, you know, I had, I had a benefit of having, you know, several excellent mentors, coaches-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... in the business, you know, including Justin Meyer you know but, 'cause as you know, I married up. (laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThat's right.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo I got to meet Justin and Joe Heitz and all those guys by the simple fact of marrying, you know, one of the most intelligent and articulate, and at that t- and, and beautiful young ladies in Napa.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWell, she didn't do too bad herself.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. So, but anyway-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... circling back, so the old man called me. And, uh, offered me a job in '82. And that's actually when I first started working for my father, it wasn't 'til then. Because it had always been the Navy. I worked for John Rolleri or I worked for Mike Grgich, I worked for Jerry. I'd never worked for Jim Barrett, I always worked for his officer corps.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd it was a very da- and I still, d- typically do run Montelena in very much in Navy style. We have an officer corps, enlisted corps, and everybody knows where they fit in the-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHuh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... chain of command. And it's very ... The thing is, when you have a very tightly run ship, you can be very relaxed.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nInteresting. That's why you're so relaxed all these years.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. (laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnd you know you look at me, and go, “Shafer, why are you so uptight?”\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWell, because-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... you work at the office. But I make other people do that. (laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWe're gonna have to go have a long lunch. So he, so he called you up, 'cause Jerry said, “Hire Bo.”\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnd, and and y-you went for it. Did you guys-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, no, well-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n...long discussion?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. That was, it took about three days because my father, I knew him by then, and he knew me pretty well, and basically what we said is, “I will take this job, if you will treat me like you've treated every other of the professional winemakers that you've had.” 'Cause he treated 'em very well. He treated Grgich well, he treated Luper well. He was a very responsive, authoritarian, you know, firm, but unreasonable boss but you could always count on him.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHm.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd he was, he was non-interfering, which is, you've been in the business enough. When the owner are interfering with the creative side, that's, gets to be a problem. Like, I need you to make the wine just like Silver Oak-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSomeone else.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... or something. That, that's a recipe for disaster. And he never did that. He said, “I need you to make Montelena Wines.” So basically, my c-conditions were, uh, you have to treat me like the other guys. You can never treat me like sunny boy and he goes, “You're darn, you're damn right, you know-”\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWow.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n“I can't treat you like sunny boy, if you make shitty wine, I'm gonna fire your ass.” And I said, “That's a totally straight up deal. I'm ready for that.” So, it a, so, then we would limit our father and son stuff. It was, he was good at compartmentalizing, too. So we always fished together, and flew together, and like when I flew with him, I was his, by that time, I was a better pilot, I was his chief pilot, and he-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... eventually conceded that. But on the wine making and things like that ... And he, uh, he'd he he kept a good check on me. Lots of time when I wanted buy a vineyard, you know, these were screaming deals, that we should have bought.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAs I looked at it through, you know, the times we have recessions and I'm, I'm really glad that he had that rule to keep Chateau Montelena small, that we're, you know, still the same size we were in 1990. And it really is a nice size that be, and he did it, just 'cause the Bordeaux first growth, so, 35, to 50,000 cases. And he didn't ever want to make more.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, and that, we're still a small winery, and we're still, you know, making 100,000 gallons of wine and we don't have to be all things to all people. It is, so, a lot of his things that we didn't agree with, I could certainly agree with his philosophy. But that we passed up on a couple of vineyards. Yeah, there's several that I, I wish we would have had a buy-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... had boughten. The wineries that we went in to buy, I'm probably glad that those deals fell through, uh, now.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI had a couple, I've had a couple of those.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, that-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, the Lord works in mysterious ways.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah, like, oh my gosh. I'm so glad we didn't do that.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. Exactly.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd so, and e-especially, you know, when times are great, like the last five years are, you know, it's our bus- I was talking to David Duncan do you talk to him yet? Yeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nDave Duncan 'cause I had, we were yucking it up about how great things were. This was probably, I don't know, 10 years ago when it was a really, one of the good cycles.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd he goes, and, uh-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... wh-what did he say? He says, “Yeah. Uh, it's never been better and it's never gonna end, again.” (laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs). So true. I think, well, you and I've been, you've been doing this the same length of time. We've had a good two or three cycles.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nHm.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYou know. For sure.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nDefinitely. Yeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nUm, so, s- help me out on s- dates. 'Cause I'm losing track. So you're, so you've, you became winemaker at Montelena, '82, '83?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. '82.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it. Got it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnother similarity. '83 for me, here-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYep.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... at Shafer. So we-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... were tracking, no wonder I never saw you-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... 'cause we were busy.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat, that was a busy time, in '83. Then my dad finally moved up around '85. So there was, that was the toga party you're just like, when I'm running the show.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, that was the, the inmates are in charge of the asylum. You know, and then the old man moves up and things kind of calm down a little bit.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGood.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd then I stayed through-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWhen, when, when-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nwell-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... when you jumped on board, did, did you make a lot of changes, or just kinda keep going? 'Cause you guys had a pretty good prior-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWell, yeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... track record with-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThe where, my ... Jerry really was terrific, uh, on shaping the Estate Cab program.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, he was, he was clearly more masterful, uh, in the Cabernet world. And even though he had some pretty crappy equipment at that time. You know, you gotta remember, we're still picking in the day, and it's 100 degrees. But-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah, Yeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut, so Jerry's mastery was really the estate Cabernet. And that was really his job. To make sure, you know, cement that program. 'Cause, you know, he takes over in '77. And that's 75% of Estate Cab. So, Jerry really develops the Montelena Estate Cab.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, then, I came up-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI'm with you.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... in, uh, two th- in '82, and it wasn't 'til like '84, where we started filtering into barrels, uh, 'cause we had a lot of Brett.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... and, you know, and back in those days, you know, what, they used to call it terroir, that you and I both, know, was really the Brett the terroir was really a-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nIt was Brett.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nW-was, was a buy, you know, was a microbial signature of the house.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nMm-hmm (affirmative).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo our Brett tasted different then your Brett, which is different then, you know, Heitz's Brett and everybody else's Brett. And you know, and-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYou know, I never thought-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThe most amazing, those are amazing wines still.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI never thought about that, but I think you're really right.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nNo terroir it was definitely and-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nIt's all Brett.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... and it lasted longer in France than it did here.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWe, the wineries in Cal- this is what, that's a- really when Napa Valley took over the world, if you think about it. Where we really started making run of successes of Bordeaux Chateau is when we stopped using so much Brett and started using our, our great vineyard flavors.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd that was really-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat really suited Napa's niche in the world, where, you know, your vineyard, your Cabernet, it could be the same rootstock and the same clone, and the same farming. But your Cabernet's gonna taste so different then mine.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo different.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut, your Brett's gonna be more similar-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... than dis-similar, you know what I mean? And you can use the same cooper, so this is where the Americans in Cabernet, or Napa Valley, in particular-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... really starts-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nBut once we start-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... really impacting the world.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOnce we cleaned up our wines-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... it happened with us.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI mean, amazing.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. So in '84, I started filtering. And these are tough-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... decisions you're making. And I, like taking out the press, making different press cuts and so, yeah, sure, I made some changes that were all, you know, in that progression, that, you know, Shafer has done, all of the successful wineries have done the exact same thing. Take your core mission to make these amazing wines. But then to make 'em as the bar of quality. You remember, the '70s, '80s, it was easy to find crappy wines.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nFrom anywhere-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... around the world.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh, yes.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nNow, you go to a wine sh- you can go to the cheapest, most inferior wine that you find at Long's Drugs, I'm not even talking about Costco.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nIt's solid.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWe, there, these-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nIt's okay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... are solid products.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo in the early days, you make a wine, and it was decent. This is great.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut, now, you know, everybody's making such amazing wine. So, then, you know, well, whether it's here at Shafer, or us, or all of our, you know, in our league certainly, we all have to work really hard to, you know, keep up, you know, 'cause you're after my customers, and I'm after yours. (laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYou bet.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know what I mean?\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYou bet.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd that's a very, odd, it's a, keeps us honest. It, but, you know the beneficiary of it is our customers.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh there's-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThat they get-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThere's never been more great choices across the spectrum of, for the consumers.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo it's great.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, but anyway, back to the Brett. So, yeah, sure, we changed things over the years.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd, you know, the other funnier thing is as you get through equipment. Because you think-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... the old Healdsburg crusher destemmer -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nDid you have one of those, too?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThis is called a Healdsburg crusher stemmer, and man, it was (laughs) it's like a Waring blender of the stemmer crushers.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, we call it the Cuisinart.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd, like ... our Chardonnay, our Chardonnay always had this green color. And, um,-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs)\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nI was talking to Warren [Winiarski] one time. And he goes, “I can always pick Montelena out of a tasting.” I said, “Why?” He goes, “I love the green color. How do you accomplish that?” I'm going, uh.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs). It was that old Healdsburg grape disintegrator.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut, yeah, we didn't change that 'til '89. 'Cause, you know, remember '87, '88.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRemember -?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nOkay.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWe used to crush Chardonnay in that thing.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOhhh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nRiesling.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh, no. You did Riesling?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThis is before whole, this is before whole cluster pressing, where we put everything through the crusher.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAnd it was just like ... And with white grapes, it's just kind of, uh, it's kind of ... not really a good thing to.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWe crushed, well, we do still about half Chardonnay, still.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWe have, but we have the, which is totally different, you know.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo we're not using the green part. Actually, I want to put some green in, this year. Just see how it-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... works out.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nAll right.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut, uh-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, I mean so Warren said “I could always tell the Montelena Chardonnay, because the thing.” ... And also, remember how long we used to use barrels. That was the most amazing thing. Like our Chardonnay-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... barrels, like 12 year old Chardonnay barrels.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nNo kidding.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nOh yeah. (laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYou know something? Can I, can I j- I'm interrupting again. But, I, I'll, you know. I'm on board. I'm the winemaker. I've been here, I don't know, five, six, seven, eight, you know, eight or nine years. Elias has been with me six or seven of 'em, we're starting to turn the corner. You know, we've still got a ways to go. I'm trying to be, you know, but I, but I'm close with Dad, and, you know, he's, you know, I'm in the loop on budgets and financials, so cash flow. So I'm, you know, I'm tracking with that. 'Cause he's teaching me, which is great. And you know, so I'm real sensitive about that. You know, I don't want to spend too much money. So, you know, I had barrels. I had old barrels. I had, like, eight, nine year old barrels around here. You know, we'd get a few new ones every year, but you know, like -. You know? And, you know, doing the right thing. And then, within a year or so of that, we promoted Elias to winemaker, 'cause Dad says, you know, “Doug, you gotta be president.” I said, “Great. Great.” So the first thing Elias does, is he walks into Dad's office, now that he's winemaker, and says, “John, this is what I need.” And it's like, you know, I need, he needed like ... (laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHe needed like a whole lotta new barrels. And it's like, the, the price tag was major. And, and Dad goes, “Great. We can do that.” And I'm like going, “Wait a minute.” (laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI was trying to be... So, no more nine year old barrels around here.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nBut I remember that.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nNo Jim, Jim on the other, my dad, that was what, because he didn't really know exactly what we were doing in the winemaking.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGot it.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd then, his mantra was, If it makes the wine better-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nHm.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... and it makes your job easier. I will find the money for it.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nBut, we were always very responsible about that. I'm I am not joking. We still have a 1984, the first forklift we ever, the first new piece of equipment-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... we ever bought was an '84 Cat forklift.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWe still have it. It's out at the vineyard shop. So, when you learn up, 'cause everything was borrowed in those days. Like, when we bottled-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, Mike Grgich had sent me down to see Roy Raymond over at-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... Beringer-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... and I'd borrow a hand labeler.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd then I'd go to somebody else, and I'd scrounge up, uh, you know th-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... the corkers and stuff like that.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOr you need a hand spinner from somebody-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... hey can I borrow it-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nOh yeah, all that stuff-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... you know that type thing-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... just we were always, you know, borrowing, or you needed a-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n... dump truck. You gotta go get it and-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt was, you know, it was pretty, you know ... I don't know, I can't remember when the first year we bought a brand-new tractor, it was probably about 1990.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSomething like that.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWe had a lot of old tractors-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n... around here. (laughs).\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nOh.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nUm, you mentioned, uh, her name earlier, uh, at some point in this whole timeline, you meet your bride, Heidi. How'd you guys meet?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nWell, we met t-two ways (laughs).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nOkay. We met professionally first, and it didn't work out so hot, but she was out of that great class at UC Davis, there was a class at Davis that got finished I dunno, '80, '81, whenever it was, where it was Heidi, and both Rose and Bruce Cakebread, and Randall Graham, and Rollin Soles, and-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, a whole... So she came out of there and Jerry Luper had hired the Texan Rollin Soles, who later had the great career at Argyle-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay, right.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, up in Oregon, and now ROCO Wines, but so... Jerry Luper hires Rollin and Rollin comes from Davis.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd I happen to have an apartment in the upstairs of my house called 'The Hovel,' and Rollin moved into The Hovel...\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs)\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo Rollin says, \"Hey, let's start a tasting group!\" And I hadn't been in a tasting group, 'cause I had this infant son, I was- by this time I'm a single divorced parent will full custody of a two-year-old child.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWow.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo I have an extremely busy life, I'm workin' in the cellar full-time-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd have a baby all by myself. My folks still live in LA. You know, I have no back-up here, so I was-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnyway, Rollin starts this tasting group, people come to my house, and he invites, you know Bob Levy and Heidi, and all of his mob from Davis, and so then there's-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs)\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n-me and Gerard Zanzonico, you remember him\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI remember Gerard, yeah. Yeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd so Gerard... So I give this tasting group and, uh... But, it was, you know, Heidi walked into my house, saw what was goin' on, and she had no interest at all, what was goin' on there. So then I-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs)\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nI quit Montelena, and I went to Europe, and I came back, and I was coming home from Parke Hafner's wedding down in Berkeley, you know Hafner, up in Alexander Valley, and of course now I've got my skinny tie, and I'm all cleaned up-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nParke and...Parke and I -\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nParke and Sarah-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nParke and I were lab partners at UC Davis freshman year.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nOkay, so anyway, Parke gets married to Sarah down in, uh, in Berkeley-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo I'm comin' home with my 80s skinny tie-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n-and all that stuff. And I walk in the Yountville Saloon, which I'm sure you remember.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nOf course, yeah. So I walk in the Yountville Saloon, and Heidi's sittin' there in a UC Davis crew sweatshirt, you know, so I'm dressed up and she's not, and it was just a lightning bolt. We looked across the room, next thing you know we were goin' on a date.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh man.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n33 years later...you know, two kids, and she helped me... So then, you know, she, even with my... I was kind of a project that-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs)\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n-you know 'cause I've got this kid, and all I did was hunt and ski and fish, and, you know...\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nDo whatever I wanted. And it turns out, and fly airplanes, and so Heidi was takin' flying lessons, she skied ... She didn't hunt or fish, but I taught her how to fish, which is one of my greatest regrets of my life, 'cause she always catches more-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs)\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n-and bigger fish than I catch. And then for hunting, she didn't like the blood part, but I got her into mushroom huntin' and so-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThere you go.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n-foraging, so she likes that. So it turned out, uh... She's just, we just had so many mutual-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh, that's-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n-interests, and I told you what I... When we walked in today, we just finished, you know, 24 hours under water, you know 20... 24 dives in 14 days.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nWow.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, she was with me on every single one.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nNice.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo that was good.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nNice.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah. So I met Heidi, and clearly she, with Dick Peterson having been the winemaker at BV... Uh, at that time he was down building the Monterey, had built\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n-the Monterey vineyard.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight. Right.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo I went down, met him down there, but, you know, he was already a big name in the business by then.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYeah.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd Heidi was working with Justin Meyer, so when I- When I met Heidi\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nThat's what- that's what I didn't catch earlier, okay. I didn't know she, I didn't know she worked with Justin.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, when I met Heidi, that's where, clearly that I married up.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSil- sil- Silver Oak.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSi- Silver Oak, yeah, and this is when Silver Oak is still at Franciscan, 'cause she's workin' a lot with Franciscan, so, before they built Silver Oak, uh... Franc- uh, they were makin' the Silver Oak at Franciscan, 'cause Justin was the winemaker there.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo in the early days of Silver Oak Heidi was part of that, and so, by... started hangin' out and event- and eventually marryin' Heidi, then I got to meet, you know, all, all that circle that she'd grown up with when it was, you know, the Heitzes-\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh yeah-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nThe Martinis, and basically everybody. And so it was definitely I went, you know, from the bush leagues into the big leagues (laughing).\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs)\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd like I said, I very proudly say I married up, there is no question about that.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh no, yeah, I'd say it's mutual.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs)\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nI'd say it's mutual. I'd say it's mutual. You know, Heidi's great, you're great, you're uh, you're no slouch, my friend. And you're, you know, we were all projects at that age.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, that's true.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nYou know, I mean... I can't go there 'cause-\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs)\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nM- my- I have to- my kids are great, th- they said, \"Dad, we love all your stories.\" I said, and they go, \"God, you were a derelict.\" It's pretty funny to listen to.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\n(laughs)\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nBut, uh... Rollin' along, I gotta talk about 2008, 'cause all sorts of things happened in 2008 for you guys. I think the winery was almost purchased, you were in the, you, you had the Bottle Shock movie based on Montelena, and you and Heidi started a wine brand. Anything else happen that year (laughs), or is that the big three?\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nNo, the financial crisis happened.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOh, yeah, yeah!\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nDon't forget about that.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSo- so what, so- let's start with the story. You guys were in contract with some French folks.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYeah, it was, actually it was a Swiss guy, Rebier, that owned Cos d'Estournel and he had been putting money in build, rebuilding that one. And my dad had come to the conclusion that his estate was too complicated and Montelena was difficult and it -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nSure.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd that probably, for the family business would probably not survive the estate tax business and.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nGood point.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou got to remember, before the economic collapse of late 2008, it was a boom time on everything.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nBoom.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd the prices were really high out here because Mountain Valley was still just crazy. So, people were offering him crazy money for the winery, and he said, \"I'm going to sell it.\" because we were a monarchy at the time and a lot of us did not want to sell it. My mom in particular who owned 47.5%, me who owned 5, but it was a limited partnership and that general partner is the king.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo, we worked for a while to find the right buyer for the place and the Rebier guys, uh and the Cos d’Estournel, they had the right idea because we saw what they had been doing and the investments they made. So anyway, we made a deal with them, and we actually sold the winery. And, I quit being the winemaker for them and that's when Cam Perry was promoted to winemaker\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nOkay\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd I was, then I was master winemaker, and basically stepping away and I was going to be like titular staff for the three to five years and then.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nYou know, they're going to own the winery.\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nRight.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nAnd it was good because their winemaker was a super pro guy. He was Basque guy, he wasn't a Bordelaise, and so we got along great, but the Bordelaise, the Champagne guys, who was running it. I'm not going to name names but this guy was like a champenoise guy and we're all saying nice things like, we're going to work together, but he was a -\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\nNot going to happen.\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nIt wasn't going to happen, you know there, like he, people that know me know exactly what I was going to say right there. (laughs)\n\nDoug Shafer:\n\n(laughs)\n\nBo Barrett:\n\nSo anyway, "
