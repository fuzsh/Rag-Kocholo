Sharma would grow up in Canada during the 1960s, coming to make a name for himself as an author. Developing his voice over the years, he would gradually learn his craft, whilst also becoming a confident speaker as well. Working as a litigation lawyer until he was twenty-five, he would then move on to become an author, as well as a motivational speaker.\n\nPublishing his first book, he would publish it himself, and this would ultimately lead to his career, as he would become a successful writer full time. Founding the training company known as Sharma Leadership International, he’s gone on to successfully publish over twelve books and counting. Speaking at numerous corporate events for big names, including Microsoft and Nike, he continues to be a successful writer to this day.\n\nWriting Career\n\nIn 1994 he would publish the book ‘Megaliving!: 30 Days to a Perfect Life,’ which would go on to become a resounding success. His second book, ‘The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari,’ would also be self-published in 1997, and would later be picked up by HarperCollins. Largely writing books on stress management as well as spirituality, he has helped countless others through his words and his work.\n\nOften teaching on leadership and motivation, he inspires others to make the best of themselves, really taking his career to a new level each time. His writing has helped many and he does a lot of work through his foundation too, providing assistance and services to those in need. Acclaimed by both readers and critics alike, he’s won numerous awards, and his writing career continues on strong.\n\nThe Monk Who Sold His Ferrari\n\nOriginally published in 1996, this would come out through the HarperOne publishing label on the 21st of April to much acclaim. Self-published at first, it would later get a book deal, allowing him to become a huge name in the self-help genre and scene. Reaching a global audience, it would see Sharma becoming a success, and would set the tone for much of what was to follow.\n\nFollowing Julian Mantle, this sees him as a lawyer confronting his own life, facing a spiritual imbalance and crisis. Journeying on an odyssey into an ancient culture, he begins to make discoveries that lead to him learning wise and fulfilling lessons. These truths help provide insight, advancing his life, and creating a sense of well-being, allowing him to lift himself up. Developing joyful thoughts, following life’s personal calling and mission, and acting courageously, he learns to make the most of everything.\n\nWorking as a fable essentially, this gives the reader plenty of life lessons through its engaging story and interesting premise. Providing the reader with a clear message, it gives them something concrete to take away, allowing them to really prosper. There would be other books similar to it as well from Sharma, but this would definitely set the benchmark for much of his writing career.\n\nThe Saint, the Surfer, and the CEO\n\nFirst brought out in 2002 on the 1st of October, this would be another stand-alone self-help book from Robin S. Sharma. Released through the Hay House publishing label, it continued the career of Sharma with more of his insights and learning. Finding more fans around the world, it would incorporate a number of different ideas, essentially becoming its own complete book. There’s a lot to it, and many have found solace and comfort in what it has to say and offer the reader over the years.\n\nThis provides an in-depth guide and insight into living the best life, and really making the most of everything available. Teaching the reader, it takes them on a journey, allowing them to really benefit and live a far more fulfilling life in the process. Showing readers how to live their destiny, it helps them conquer stress and balance their life feeling good about themselves overall. This is something that really helps, offering practical wisdom in a straightforward and easy to follow manner.\n\nIt’s a well written resource with a lot to offer its audience, and fans of Sharma as a writer definitely won’t be disappointed. It’s practical and intelligently written, really allowing the reader to invest themselves in what’s being said to them directly. Anyone reading this will take something away from it, which goes some way towards explaining why it’s been so successful worldwide."
