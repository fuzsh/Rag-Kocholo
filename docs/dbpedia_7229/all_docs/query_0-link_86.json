        "text": "Get laid tonight!\n\nI don’t have many occasions to feel good about my surfing ability. I know who I am, what I am, not that it robs any pleasure, any joy, I feel at bogging a roundhouse cutback. At doing a “floater” going “backside.”\n\nZero disillusionment. Full transparency. Still, pure joy.\n\nAnd today that joy was enhanced by the realization that I likely surf* better than the great Laird Hamilton.\n\nYou do too, since you surf* better than me.\n\nAnd let me explain.\n\nLaird Hamilton is the name that pops into every fringe-surfer, non-surfer’s mind when they hear the word “surf”, no?\n\nThe Maui now Malibu legend cemented his position in the VAL and/or VAL-adjacent hierarchy decades ago.\n\nHe is who your grandma thinks about when she thinks about a “surfer.”\n\nHe is who hangs on the World Surf League’s new CEO and Lord Commander’s office wall.\n\nHe is a saint.\n\nAnd you surf* better.\n\nI surf* better.\n\nDon’t believe?\n\nWhen was the last time you saw Laird Hamilton paddle himself into a wave on any respectable surf craft?\n\n30 years ago?\n\nNever?\n\nThat’s right. Laird is perpetual Waterperson of the Year (apologies to Dirk Ziff), inventor of modern day SUPping, hydrofoil, strapped tow-in master but…\n\n…if the ice bath frozen cro-magnon paddled out to your lineup, with his own arms, on a surfboard*, you’d smash him.\n\nNo?\n\nHe hasn’t put his toes in that sorta wax in forever. Since losing to Rick Kane.\n\nFor sure. He only does weird surfing shit plus longboarding. He’d have no idea how to even pump down a straight line.\n\nNo?\n\nListen and then tell me how we wouldn’t smash that cro-magnon in a surf-off.\n\n*surf, surfboard, surfing all refer to the real stuff. Some sort of shortboard paddled with arms.\n\nAlso, if you listen to podcast I say Justin Timberlake and Jessica Beal were at Sugarfish. In real life it was Brian Austin Green and Meghan Fox but you can certainly understand my confusion.\n\n\"An amazing human being!\"\n\nRemember when, last week or maybe two weeks ago, once proud Hurley’s corpse was being paraded through the streets mourned so woefully? Non-surfing east coast interlopers swinging in, cutting the brand into pieces and licensing those pieces out. A beard oil line launched. Employees fired in droves. Team riders disappeared each and every one. John John Florence walking away from, allegedly, millions of dollars in disgust. Stab magazine’s Ashton “Bilbo” Goggans, spilling every ounce of ink, declaring it the “story of the decade.”\n\nHurt, rage, sadness.\n\nWell, today the very famous Carissa Moore “extended her partnership” with the new owners and let’s press release together.\n\nThe Hurley Brand (“Hurley”) is proud to announce it has extended its multi-year partnership with Olympian and 4X World Champion surfer, Carissa Moore.\n\nA prodigious talent, Carissa Moore has been a massive presence in competitive surfing since the moment she put on a jersey, racking up eleven national titles in her amateur career before arriving on the World Championship Tour in 2010, winning World Titles in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2019. Following her storied 2019 season, Carissa qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, where she will go for the gold as part of Team USA.\n\n“Carissa is an amazing human being, in and out of the water. We couldn’t be more excited to have her continue to partner with us and we can’t wait to see what she accomplishes in Tokyo and beyond,” said Brandon Guilmette, Chief Marketing Officer at Hurley.\n\nWith a larger focus being placed on the Hurley Women’s business, and exciting new partnerships with Hybrid Apparel for sportswear and InMocean for swim, Carissa will be the center of this evolving division for Hurley.\n\n“I’m excited to be extending my partnership with Hurley. There has been a lot of change recently but I’m optimistic about the future and opportunity for growth. Hurley’s innovation has helped me perform my best in and out of the water. I am looking forward to contributing to the design process with the team for 2020 and beyond,” said the 4X World Champion, Carissa Moore.\n\nThis signing on the heels “quiet negotiations” to bring back some of the once-greatest surf team ever assembled amid “furious backlash” according to BeachGrit’s own Derek Rielly, stealing the “story of the decade” from poor Ashton Goggans while the boy had his lovely, soft eyes on the buffet bar, wondering how high prime rib can be stacked and wondering how many succulent ribs can fit alongside.\n\nNow, in light of… all things, will these newly resigned surfers be hailed as financially prudent heroes unbent by the cries of a flimsy public or scabs crossing a picket line?\n\nMoore as the story develops.\n\nIt's a greenwash!\n\nAs reported, yesterday, and with its teat still being squeezed today, Kelly Slater has joined hands with resort developers to build a twenty-acre tank in the Coachella Valley, near Frankie Sinatra and Elvis’ old hang-out Palm Springs and home to a sort of retirement music festival with acts twenty-years beyond their peak.\n\n“The largest, rideable open-barrel, human-made wave in the world,” according to promotional literature.\n\nAnd Slater’s pool is only one of three being built.\n\nThree pools, different techs, different angles, different pro surfer touts etc.\n\nRead, here, here, here and here.\n\n(Kelly Slater was made sad by coverage and sent DM to BeachGrit that read, “You guys love nothing more than clickbait.”)\n\nThe area’s newspaper, The Desert Sun, has paid particular attention to the Slater country club which is going to be built, approvals pending, between 58th Avenue and Avenue 60 and across from Andalusia, in La Quinta.\n\nA quote that I enjoyed very much from the story comes from Noah Hahn, a partner at the resort developer Meriwether Cos.\n\n“Kelly Slater and the WSL are … the perfect partners to feature as we create a revolutionary new way to live and travel.”\n\nAccording to The Desert Sun, the resort, called Coral Mountain, “the ethos of the community is designed to revolve around the raw natural setting with a focus on sustainability.”\n\nThe pool will require 18-million gallons of water, significantly less, says the developer, than the 18-hole golf course that was previously approved for the site.\n\nRevolutionary? Sustainable?\n\nLet’s do a fun little math exercise.\n\nWhat’s the rainfall in the Coachella Valley?\n\nTwo-and-a-half inches or sixty-seven mm?\n\n18,000,000 gallons fills the pool.\n\nOne gallon of water = 231 cubic inches.\n\nMultiply that by eighteen-million and y’get…\n\nA little over four billion inches.\n\nDivide by the yearly rainfall and…\n\nIf the pool was filled by rain (sustainable!), it would take one-point-six billion years to fill it.\n\nEven eco-paradises need a little help from man, yes?\n\nBack to the drawing board!\n\nIf there is one thing that the world’s biggest surf adjacent website does better than any, it’s kicking a dead horse. Kick, kick, kick. And yesterday’s announcement by famous surfer and noted philanthropist* Kelly Slater is laying there, bloated in the desert. And there I stand so happy, so overjoyed, kick, kick, kicking.\n\nThe angles covered thus far: Kelly Slater is building a wave tank that features homes, a hotel and multiple dining venues. Kalani Robb and Cheyne Mag announced theirs a year ago in the already existing Wet n Wild. The Hobgoods, Josh Kerr and Shane Beschen announced a new Wavegarden months ago. CJ Hobgood taunted Kelly.\n\nThe angles yet to cover: Dirk Ziff’s relationship with Michael B. Schwab and various levels of jealousy as to who is better friends with Kelly Slater, how Shane Beschen got the invite into the Hobgood x Kerr duo, what sort of food will be served at Kelly Slater’s “multiple dining venues,” how the flood of surfers will mesh with Palm Spring’s exiting lesbian community, pricing, Kelly Slater’s teased “new wave, stand alone design, seen nowhere in the world.”\n\nWhoa!\n\nCan we unpack** that last one?\n\nLet’s read the entire quote, in full, once again, paying attention to each and every word.\n\n“We’re excited to make another KSWaveCo design and I’m personally excited to create a new wave that will be a stand alone design that nowhere else in the world has. This can become the blueprint for new developments around waves and surf parks going forward and is in line with some of my original ideas from when we started this project.”\n\nOk.\n\nSo.\n\nSurf Ranch, there in Lemoore, was built as a test facility, no? The probable future. Does the fact that Kelly Slater and co. are designing a new wave, a stand alone design, nowhere else in the world, “in line” with some of his “original ideas” strike you as wild?\n\nFamous commenter and noted champion of disabled surfers Negatron mentioned in yesterday’s discussion “No way it’ll be a train running down a straight line.”\n\nBut what will it be?\n\nWhat can it be?\n\nAnd does this whole thing mean that Surf Ranch was a failure?\n\nOr was Surf Ranch a red herring?\n\nWill the Webber Wave Pool finally be unveiled except with the name “Webber” scribbled out and “Kelly Slater” written over top?\n\nHelp!\n\n* It is unknown if Kelly Slater has ever given money to charity.\n\n** Do you like when “unpack” is used in this context?\n\nA \"green light\" for the Big Wave Invitational presented by Husqvarna.\n\nAnd while we have all had our eyes pointed towards California’s desert, where the world’s most famous surfer and noted environmentalist, Kelly Slater, just declared war on one-time friend Kalani Robb and one-time neighbors CJ and Damien Hobgood, climate change has descended upon North America’s Great Lakes which just received a “green light” for its inaugural Big Wave Invitational presented by Husqvarna.\n\nUnbelievable but true and let’s quickly turn to CNN and its lauded meteorologists for the latest.\n\nTowering waves are forming Thursday on the Great Lakes, with swells that could reach 20 feet, CNN meteorologists said.\n\nHuge waves already have been spotted over southern Lake Michigan, following a mass of cold air that pushed a north wind over the region, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said.\n\nLake Ontario could get waves of up to 20 feet near its center, Guy said. Waves as tall as 10 feet could form on Lakes Huron and Erie, peaking on their southern shores.\n\nMore than 2 million people south of Lakes Michigan, Erie and Ontario are under lakeshore flood warnings Thursday, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said.\n\nImagine. 20 foot waves, towering 20 foot waves even, in those bodies of freshwater straddling Canada and The United States. 20 foot waves. Kelly Slater struggles to get a wave over 4 feet in his body of freshwater and could it be that God has built a better wave tank than the greatest surfer of all time?\n\nLet’s not let our minds wander there. Let’s force them, instead, to wander over to Ben Gravy. The famous YouTuber and noted novelty wave pioneer has to be there, no? Has to be waxing his gun even as I type these words. There are absolutely zero critiques of Gravy’s ability etc. but if there was one it would be that he enjoys very little waves and can only ride very little waves.\n\nA 20 foot novelty wave?\n\nIf Ben Gravy had one critic that one critic would bury his head in shame at the sight of the longer hair’d boy carving down a monster.\n\nDon’t you agree?\n\nMore as the story develops."
