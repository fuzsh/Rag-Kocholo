        "text": "Giles Bristow, CEO, RNLI crew, and luckiest person alive\n\nI joined this outstanding team in 2023 and could not be more impressed by their passion and ability to campaign and work for a thriving ocean and thriving people.\n\nI made my way to SAS via a career as an environmental lawyer and then working at a senior level in environmental NGOs in climate & energy, food, and marine systems. I am in love with the ocean and share my passion for swimming, sailing, wing-foiling, and surfing with the crew at SAS, friends, and my wife and daughters. I feel incredibly fortunate that I work for the ocean.\n\nBeing RNLI crew in Lyme Regis, I may need to run if my pager sounds.\n\nI’m a wild swimmer, stand-up paddleboarder, and rockpool gazer, with a deep love of nature and our blue spaces, both inland and coastal.\n\nI am so excited to be joining Surfers Against Sewage at this pivotal moment when we need to keep up the pressure on polluters and governments, and press for the changes we need.\n\nI joined SAS in November 2022 and as the Financial Director I am responsible for ensuring the finances of the charity run smoothly.\n\nMy love of the ocean started at a young age when I used to go dinghy sailing. In my 20s I sailed across the Atlantic and the beauty and vitality of the ocean has stuck with me ever since! These experiences motivate me to help protect it for the future.\n\nAdriana Ciontea (she/her) – Communications Officer\n\nDavid Attenborough, nature and ocean activist extraordinaire, said that “Saving our planet is now a communications challenge. We know what to do, we just need the will.”\n\nFuelled by my passion for words and the ocean, I joined SAS in August 2022 as a Communications Officer. I oversee our social media channels, and love to inspire and connect with other ocean activists.\n\nI only surf the bookish/watery corners of the internet (for now).\n\nAloha, I’m Yvette. I joined SAS in May 2023 as the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Manager. I have spent several years campaigning for blue spaces (any open water) to be a more diverse and equitable place and I am so very happy that I now get to work on amplifying voices from all communities to help protect the blue spaces we love and encourage more people to engage with them.\n\nI love spending time in the ocean, or anywhere, with my partner, 3 children and 2 dogs and of course the many amazing women and girls we surf with at Wave Wahines.\n\nI joined SAS in July 2023 as their Senior Fundraising Data Development Officer. You’ll find me diving into all things data and systems within our fundraising team to enable more Ocean saving work!\n\nI love the Ocean. And data! So I’m thrilled to part of a Surfers Against Sewage, campaigning and taking action. Although – you won’t catch me surfing any waves – just enjoying the beauty of them!\n\nChloe Flood – Campaigns Officer\n\nPronouns: She/Her\n\nI joined SAS in January 2023 as the Campaigns and Policy Coordinator and have recently moved into the role of Campaigns Officer. I help support the delivery of all of our ocean saving campaigns and activations!\n\nI have always felt connected to the ocean. Whether it’s a coastal walk, a quick dip, a snorkel or an attempt at surfing, I am my happiest by the sea!\n\nEmily van de Geer (she/her) – Philanthropy & Partnerships Manager\n\nI joined SAS in January 2019 and after 4 years leading on our education work I now look after our Philanthropy and Partnerships team.\n\nMy role involves, securing funding for our work through Trusts & Foundations, and working with the philanthropists and businesses who support us.\n\nI’ve spent almost a decade working to protect the ocean. When I’m not in the office, you’ll find me in or by the sea.\n\nI joined SAS in January 2024 as the Executive Assistant supporting the CEO, Trustees and Leadership team in all matters governance. I feel incredibly privileged to be working with such an amazing team doing incredible campaign work protecting the ocean.\n\nI swim in the sea every morning before work and whenever else I can, it resets my soul and reminds me how lucky I am to live and work in Cornwall.\n\nEmma O’Neill (She/her)\n\nBefore coming to SAS I worked in the marine mammal rescue field for over 10 years, and have seen the devastating impacts of pollution on our marine life here in Cornwall. It has led me to be passionate about reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, so I was thrilled to join SAS as Communities Officer for Plastic Free Communities in Jan 2023. I support a network of volunteers in the UK, all working to tackle avoidable single-use plastics in their own communities. I love spending time with my family and crazy spaniel around the Cornish coast, and never pass off a chance to jump in the sea!\n\nEmma Piper (she/her) – Operations Officer\n\nHola! I joined SAS in May 2022 and love looking after the office and everyone in it. Heading up our Net Zero Project as well as diving into IT, supplier due diligence and Health & Safety are just the tip of the iceberg for my role, ensuring no two days are the same!\n\nI am working to protect the ocean as I adore the world’s aquatic wildlife, and want to help keep them safe from present day dangers.\n\nHello!\n\nI joined SAS in April 2023 as the Science and Research Officer. I am a freshwater ecologist by background, having recently finished my PhD in river health in late 2022. Now, I coordinate water quality research at SAS, in both the marine and freshwater space. I usually have my feet firmly planted in Celtic waters, whether that’s the rivers of Wales or the waves of the South West, and I am so happy to be here driving effective science-backed campaigns to help protect them.\n\nFranka Fueller (she/her) – Head of Public Fundraising\n\nI joined SAS in the summer of 2019 to grow our income and fund our ocean saving work. My job involves leading a talented and passionate team to create campaigns and communications that inspire people to fundraise and donate.\n\nI’m here because the ocean needs help and wonderful people like you want to help – and connecting the two creates real change that I’m incredibly proud to be part of.\n\nHello,\n\nI originally joined SAS in 2020 and after taking a year out for an extended surf adventure re-joined in 2023 as Policy and Research Manager.\n\nI’m working with a great team to convince politicians all over the UK to deliver research and evidenced policy solutions to tackle pollution and climate change.\n\nI’m based up in Scotland and if I’m not surfing I’ll be up a munro.\n\nJacey Price (she/her) – Senior Database Officer\n\nI joined SAS way back in 2016 and during that time my role has evolved into what it is today, which is all things data!\n\nI grew up in Cornwall and have always been lucky enough to live by the sea, which inspires me to work hard to protect it.\n\nJade Chapman (She/her)\n\nCommunications Officer\n\nHey! I joined Surfers Against Sewage in April 2021.\n\nI work in communications and handle our email campaigns and media. I’m essentially a professional keyboard warrior, and I love it. If you get our monthly newsletter, thanks, that’s from me!\n\nI’m here because I want to give nature the chance to thrive, and fighting the good fight with SAS puts me, and the ocean, in good stead. From one ocean lover to another, I hope you stick around!\n\nJosh Harris (he/him) – Head of Communications\n\nI’ve been at SAS since moving back home to Cornwall in early 2021. My role is focused on ensuring that all our communications motivate audiences to engage in Ocean Activism, in whatever way fits their preference.\n\nGrowing up in Penzance, I’ve always felt a deep connection with the sea and coastal communities so I feel deeply privileged to be able to spend my working life protecting the ocean.\n\nI joined Surfers Against Sewage as an HR Officer in January 2023. This is a new role in the ever growing SAS and I am happy to be part of that journey – exciting times!\n\nI am thrilled to not only work for a charity I believe is extremely important to everyone, but also with a team of people that are committed and passionate about the sea and the climate.\n\nI have just returned to Cornwall, left for 9 months and missed it so much. I even missed swimming in the sea when its freezing, walking on the cliffs when it’s gale force winds 😊 and I am never leaving again!!\n\nKirsty Davies (she/her) – Community Water Quality Manager.\n\nI joined SAS in March 2022 in a role to improve the water quality of our inland waterways. I feel privileged to work with passionate communities across the UK who are applying for bathing water designation.\n\nLike for many people the water is my happy place. Ensuring the water quality of our rivers, seas and lakes are monitored and protected for people to enjoy and nature to thrive, is what drives me in my role at SAS.\n\nLara Jeffries (she/her) – Education Manager\n\nI joined SAS in May 2023 following a career in education, as a teaching assistant, teacher and Headteacher.\n\nI work with an incredible Education Team, whose goal it is to develop Ocean Activists and build Ocean Literacy through educational resources, events and activities.

(Still true.) As part of the fundraising team, I look after our incredible members, donors and legacy-leavers – and help raise ocean-saving funds. Since that July, my love of the ocean has only grown. My surfing ability, however, has not.\n\nMy life has revolved around the Ocean, in the UK, Canada and South America and there’s nothing that makes me happier than surf and sunsets over the sea. I’ve worked with communities in humanitarian, conservation and activism settings and I am stoked to be supporting the amazing communites of Surfers Against Sewage.

In my free time you are most likely to find me in the surf or on the beach.\n\nRachel Yates, Senior Communities Manager (Plastic Free Communities)\n\nPronouns: She/her\n\nI was born overlooking the ocean, it’s lodged in my heart. That and a desire to do what I can to look after the planet and people. I started my SAS journey as a Rep and when the Plastic Free Communities campaign came along it was a perfect fit. After leading Penzance to become the first place to get Plastic Free Communities status in 2017, I joined HQ to manage the national movement.\n\nSam Blandford – Individual Giving’s Coordinator – She/Her\n\nHiya!

My main job is to provide everyone with lots of love and cuddles, and my fur is incredibly soft – quite therapeutic to stroke, some say.
