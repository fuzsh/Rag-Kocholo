        "text": "Many actors have attempted to crack both genres of drama and comedy. Few have succeeded, among them the genial Andre Braugher (pronounced 'Ahn-drey Braw-ger'). A two-time Emmy Award winner, he is especially remembered for two seminal roles: as the intense, often explosive Detective Frank Pembleton (signature character in the first six seasons of NBC's gritty drama Homicide (1993)), and, in stark contrast, as droll, deadpan father figure Captain Ray Holt in eight seasons of the hilarious spoof Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2013). The latter got him nominated for another four Primetime Emmys as Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. What made the Holt character special was Braugher's unerringly perfect comic timing, great punchlines and moments of endearing pathos.\n\nA Chicago native, Braugher was an alumnus of Stanford University and a 1988 Juillard graduate with a Master of Fine Arts degree. Originally a Shakespearean actor (noted for his portrayal of Henry V on the New York stage), he debuted on screen in the Civil War drama Glory (1989), as an erudite corporal, the first volunteer to enlist in one of the Union Army's African-American regiments. His inaugural portrayal of a police officer was as Kojak's sidekick, Detective Winston Blake, in a slew of made-for-TV movies. From there, Braugher became a popular casting choice for determined, no-nonsense authority types. To name but a few: Lt. Col. Benjamin O. Davis, commanding officer of Die Ehre zu fliegen - Tuskegee Airmen (1995); Detective Satch de Leon in Frequency (2000); General Hager, who falls victim to arch villain Dr. Doom in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007); Army General George Mancheck in Andromeda: Tödlicher Staub aus dem All (2008), the miniseries; the Secretary of State in Salt (2010). Then there was, of course, his defining role in Homicide, as the compelling, intense interrogation expert Frank Pembleton.\n\nBraugher had a leading non-military role as an angel named Cassiel (no, not Castiel!) in the romantic fantasy Stadt der Engel (1998), starring Nicolas Cage. He then headlined as the title character in the medical drama Gideon's Crossing (2000), loosely based on the career of a real-life professor of medicine, Jerome Groopman. His performance earned him a Golden Globe nomination. Braugher next co-starred in Die Straßen von Philadelphia (2002), another crime drama, in which he played a Philadelphia cop who aids his former partner (David Morse), who, after having left the force under a cloud, has turned into a hero vigilante.\n\nFor once on the wrong side of the law, he starred as a master criminal in the acclaimed miniseries Thief - Der Millionenjob (2006) for which he won an Emmy for Outstanding Performance by a Lead Actor. His first major foray into comedy was with Men of a Certain Age (2009), the story of three friends, each experiencing their own mid-life crisis. Braugher's character (Owen) was an angst-ridden diabetic father who hated his job as a car dealer. This was yet another strong performance which resulted in two further Emmy nominations, perhaps because Braugher abandoned his stock-in-trade authoritarian persona by playing someone insecure and vulnerable. He explained in another interview on Today, that he needed new challenges in order to grow as an artist.\n\nIt also set the scene for his famous role as Raymond Holt on Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Curiously, the actor remained oddly reticent and self-deprecating about his comedic prowess. He confessed to an interviewer that he considered himself merely \"a voyeur at the funny person's table\". Yet, some of the show's funniest moments arise from Holt's relationships: those with his team (an excellent ensemble cast led by Andy Samberg (the Halloween specials rock!), with his partner Kevin (played by the very funny Marc Evan Jackson, who also featured memorably in Michael Schur's other off-beat comedy hit, The Good Place (2016)) and with his corgi named Cheddar.\n\nAndre Braugher's unexpected death on December 11, 2023, at the age of 61, was a great loss to the entertainment industry.\n\nMaximilian Carlo Martini was born in New York to an Italian father and an American mother. He is a citizen of the United States, Canada, and Italy and speaks Italian fluently. His Roman father was a sculptor and Doctor of Philosophy and Phenomenology and instilled in him an appreciation for all things creative. His mother was a Texas law enforcement officer. After moving around a bit as a child, Martini made his way back to New York City and began to study acting. He started out at the Neighborhood Playhouse intensive he but did the majority of his training privately with Michael Howard in Manhattan. After launching Theater North Collaborative (NYC) and staging new works from both the United States and Canada, Martini took a break from the stage to focus on his early love of fine art. He attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan where he received his BFA in painting and sculpture while working as an artist assistant to Julian Schnabel. After completing university Martini began to work steadily in both film and television.\n\nMartini starred George Clooney's (dir) feature 'The Tender Bar' (2022) for Amazon Studios as well as the recently aired USA network television series The Purge. He also starred in the recently released Netflix original movie Eli. In 2019 he completed directing his second feature film The Manson Brothers Midnight Zombie Massacre. His directorial debut; Sgt.

Max Martini also starred in the television series The Unit which ran for four years on CBS. Max Martini has over 32 film titles and 200 segments of television.\n\nMax Martini is heavily involved in charitable work benefiting veterans.

Martini sits on the board of both. He also supports Higher Ground USA and The Gary Sinise Foundation in any way possible.\n\nOne of modern TV and moviedom's most sturdy and reliable character actors, David Paymer dreamed of being an actor from early childhood. Although he came from a traditional middle-class Jewish family that urged him to become a doctor or lawyer, Paymer felt more at home in the world of the thespian. At 14, he used a fake I.D. to see The Graduate, which starred a young Dustin Hoffman. He grew up in Oceanside, New York, where his father was in the scrap metal business. His mother, a homemaker, had fled Belgium with her family to escape the Nazis. When his father quit the scrap metal business to pursue music, it inspired young Paymer to give his acting dream a try. His aborted big break came when he was cast in the TV series, St. Elsewhere, as \"Dr. Wayne Fiscus\"\n\nthen promptly dumped and replaced by Howie Mandel. Luckily, his real\n\nbig break was destined to be on the big screen, as \"Ira Shalowitz\" in the Billy Crystal vehicle, City Slickers. Crystal was so pleased with Paymer's work that he wrote the part of \"Stan Yankelman\", beleaguered brother of the titular character in the movie, Mr. Saturday Night, especially for Paymer. The part earned Paymer an Oscar nomination in 1993.\n\n\"That was like getting my passport stamped\", said Paymer and he was quickly in demand by directors such as Spielberg (\"Amistad\"), Redford (\"Quiz Show\"), Oliver Stone (\"Nixon\"), David Mamet (\"State & Main\"), Steven Soderbergh (\"Ocean's 13\"), and Sam Raimi (\"Drag me to Hell\"). Chameleon-like in his portrayals, Paymer has since starred in hundreds of roles in film & television, notably \"The American President\", \"Get Shorty\", \"Payback\", \"The Hurricane\", \"In Good Company\", Francis Ford Coppola's \"Twixt\" and Kenneth Branagh's \"Jack Ryan: Shadow One\".\n\nPaymer received Golden Globe nominations for \"Mr. Saturday Night\" and for HBO's \"Crime of the Century\". Paymer became a hyphenate in 2002, directing the acclaimed comedy short \"Candor City Hospital\" for Showtime. He has since directed over 60 episodes for broadcast television, including such hits as \"Grey's Anatomy\", \"The Mentalist\", \"Brothers & Sisters\", \"Medium\" & \"The Unit\". He is also a producer and director on the CW series \"Hart of Dixie\". Paymer resides in Santa Monica, CA with his wife and two daughters.\n\nRoger Guenveur Smith is an internationally acclaimed actor, writer, and director who has created a prolific body of work on stage and screen.\n\nHe adapted his Obie Award-winning solo performance of A Huey P. Newton Story into a Peabody Award-winning telefilm, directed by his longtime colleague Spike Lee, with whom he continues to collaborate in a relationship which is unparalleled in the American cinema.\n\nFor Lee's Oscar-nominated Do The Right Thing, Smith improvised the stuttering hero, Smiley, after his debut as fraternity pledge Yoda in Lee's first studio film, school daze. The eclectic range of characters expanded with a Russian roulette-playing gangster in Malcolm X, a guitar-playing cop in Get On The Bus , the street philosopher Big Time Willie in He Got Game, a hardnose detective in Summer Of Sam, and an opportunistic insurance salesman in Chi-Raq.\n\nAlso among Smith's recent credits are The Birth Of A Nation, and Bitch, which have achieved distinction in three consecutive Sundance Festivals, and the acclaimed indies Mooz-Lum, and Better Mus' Come, in which he plays the Prime Minister of Jamaica.\n\nSmith's astonishing range is further demonstrated in the cult classics Deep Cover and King Of New York, Eve's Bayou, Hamlet, All About The Benjamins, and American Gangster, for which he was nominated for the Screen Actors' Guild Award. On HBO, Smith has starred in Steven Soderbergh's K Street, Oz, and Unchained Memories: Readings From The Slave Narrative.\n\nBefore entering the Yale School of Drama ( into a class which included Angela Bassett, Charles S. Dutton, and John Turturro) Smith studied history, earning an undergraduate degree in American Studies at Occidental College.\n\nHe has continued to combine his interests through an ever-evolving stage repertoire which includes Frederick Douglass Now, Christopher Columbus 1992, The Watts Towers Project, In Honor Of Jean-Michel Basquiat, Two Fires, Patriot Act, Juan and John, The End Of Black History Month, Who Killed Bob Marley?, Iceland, and, with Mark Broyard, Inside The Creole Mafia, a \"not too dark comedy.\"\n\nSmith's work is frequently developed through intense archival immersion and improvisation, a process which informs his performing history workshop, which he currently directs at Cal Arts.\n\nKatori Hall's The Mountaintop, Steven Berkoff's Agamemnon, and the Bessie and Ovation Award-winning Radio Mambo, are also among his directorial credits.\n\nSmith frequently collaborates with composer/videographer Marc Anthony Thompson (Chocolate Genius Inc.) and presents his work at the Bootleg Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nSmith was born in Berkeley, and raised in Los Angeles, where he resides with his wife, the writer LeTania Kirkland, and their three children. He has an adult daughter from a former marriage.\n\nJohn Slattery was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Joan (Mulhern), a CPA, and John \"Jack\" Slattery, a leather merchant, both of Irish descent. John landed his first TV gig on the 1988 series The Dirty Dozen (1988) and has worked steadily since then. His television career has included the short-lived series Under Cover (1991), Homefront (1991), Maggie (1998) and Feds (1997); and the mini-series Wechselspiel des Lebens (1995) with Sally Field and From the Earth to the Moon (1998), in which he played Walter Mondale. By having recurring roles on Will & Grace (1998) as Will's big brother, \"Sam\"; Für alle Fälle Amy (1999) as Amy's estranged husband; and Sex and the City (1998) as a very kinky politician, John has become one of the most in-demand character actors. In 2001, he had a role on NBC's comedy-drama Ed - Der Bowling-Anwalt (2000), where he played the confident, cool, aloof high school principal \"Dennis Martino\". This role earned him much notoriety, and made him the subject of debate among Ed - Der Bowling-Anwalt (2000) fans. John has also had a long, successful and diverse career in the theater. He made his theater debut in the 1989 play \"The Lisbon Traviata\", which also starred Nathan Lane. He has had several successful collaborations with the playwright Richard Greenberg and appeared in the author's \"The Extra Man\", \"Night and Her Stars\" and \"Three Days of Rain\", for which he earned critical praise for his dual roles of father and son.

Returning to the theater in 2000, John starred in a revival of Harold Pinter's \"Betrayal\". Making his feature film debut in 1996, John had a small role in the movie City Hall (1996). He then appeared in the movies Eraser (1996), Jagd auf Marlowe (1998), Traffic - Macht des Kartells (2000), and the Anthony Hopkins/Chris Rock vehicle Bad Company (2002)_, before finding greater fame as one of the stars of the television series Mad Men (2007).\n\nA tall, wavy-haired US actor with a deep, resonant voice, Clancy Brown has proven himself a versatile performer with first-class contributions to theatre, feature films, television series and even animation.\n\nClarence J.

Drafted into the Navy, he served as a cook in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and was on board an LST during the Battle of Okinawa. He then returned to the University of Kentucky to appear in a production of \"Pygmalion\", before heading out to California and honing his craft at the prestigious Pasadena Playhouse. Stanton then toured around the United States with a male choir, worked in children's theater, and then headed back to California.\n\nHis first role on screen was in the tepid movie Alarm in Fort Bowie (1957), but he was quickly noticed and appeared regularly in minor roles as cowboys and soldiers through the late 1950s and early 1960s. His star continued to rise and he received better roles in which he could showcase his laid-back style, such as in Der Unbeugsame (1967), Stoßtrupp Gold (1970), Jagd auf Dillinger (1973), Der Pate 2 (1974), and in Alien: Das unheimliche Wesen aus einer fremden Welt (1979). It was around this time that Stanton came to the attention of director Wim Wenders, who cast him in his finest role yet as Travis in the moving Paris, Texas (1984). Next indie director Alex Cox gave Stanton a role that brought him to the forefront, in the quirky cult film Repo Man (1984).\n\nStanton was now heavily in demand, and his unique look got him cast as everything from a suburban father in the mainstream Pretty in Pink (1986) to a soft-hearted, but ill-fated, private investigator in Wild at Heart: Die Geschichte von Sailor und Lula (1990) and a crazy yet cunning scientist in Die Klapperschlange (1981). Apart from his film performances, he was also an accomplished musician, and \"The Harry Dean Stanton Band\" and their unique spin on mariachi music played together for well over a decade. They toured internationally. He became a cult figure of cinema and music and when Debbie Harry sang the lyric, \"I want to dance with Harry Dean...\" in her 1990s hit \"I Want That Man\", she was talking about him. Stanton remained consistently active on screen, lastly appearing in films including Angst und Schrecken in Las Vegas (1998), The Green Mile (1999) and In stürmischen Zeiten (2000).\n\nAn intense, versatile actor as adept at playing clean-cut FBI agents as he is psychotic motorcycle-gang leaders, who can go from portraying soulless, murderous vampires to burned-out, world-weary homicide detectives, Lance Henriksen has starred in a variety of films that have allowed him to stretch his talents just about as far as an actor could possibly hope. He played \"Awful Knoffel\" in the TNT original movie Evel Knievel (2004), directed by John Badham and executive produced by Mel Gibson. Henriksen portrayed \"Awful Knoffel\" in this project based on the life of the famed daredevil, played by George Eads. Henriksen starred for three seasons (1996-1999) on Millennium: Fürchte deinen Nächsten wie dich selbst (1996), Fox-TV's critically acclaimed series created by Chris Carter (Akte X: Die unheimlichen Fälle des FBI (1993)). His performance as Frank Black, a retired FBI agent who has the ability to get inside the minds of killers, landed him three consecutive Golden Globe nominations for \"Best Performance by a Lead Actor in a Drama Series\" and a People's Choice Award nomination for \"Favorite New TV Male Star\".\n\nHenriksen was born in New York City. His mother, Margueritte, was a waitress, dance instructor, and model. His father, James Marin Henriksen, who was from Tønsberg, Norway, was a boxer and merchant sailor. Henriksen studied at the Actors Studio and began his career off-Broadway in Eugene O'Neill's \"Three Plays of the Sea.\" One of his first film appearances was as an FBI agent in Sidney Lumet's Hundstage (1975), followed by parts in Lumet's Network (1976) and Prince of the City - Die Herren der Stadt (1981). He then appeared in Steven Spielberg's Die unheimliche Begegnung der 3. Art (1977) with Richard Dreyfuss and François Truffaut, Damien - Omen II (1978) and in Philip Kaufman's Der Stoff aus dem die Helden sind (1983), in which he played Mercury astronaut Capt. Wally Schirra.\n\nJames Cameron cast Henriksen in his first directorial effort, Fliegende Killer - Piranha II (1982), then used him again in Terminator (1984) and as the android Bishop in the sci-fi classic Aliens: Die Rückkehr (1986). Sam Raimi cast Henriksen as an outrageously garbed gunfighter in his quirky western Schneller als der Tod (1995). Henriksen has also appeared in what has developed into a cult classic: Kathryn Bigelow's Near Dark - Die Nacht hat ihren Preis (1987), in which he plays the head of a clan of murderous redneck vampires. He was nominated for a Golden Satellite Award for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in the TNT original film The Day Lincoln Was Shot (1998).\n\nIn addition to his abilities as an actor, Henriksen is an accomplished painter and potter. His talent as a ceramist has enabled him to create some of the most unusual ceramic artworks available on the art market today. He resides in Southern California with his wife Jane and their five-year-old daughter Sage.\n\nDonal Logue's versatility and talent makes him one of the most well respected and beloved actors today. Born in Ottawa, Canada, Logue moved all over the United States, from the Boston area as an infant to various towns on the Mexican border. He returned to Boston to attend Harvard University, where he majored in Intellectual History and discovered his love for the performing arts. While in college, he appeared in over thirty plays, worked for two summers in the American Repertory Theatre's Harvard/Radcliffe Summer Stock Company, and spent a short time doing theatre in England. After graduating, Logue joined the Cornerstone Theatre Company which developed community theatre in rural parts of the United States. From then on Logue dedicated himself to pursuing his passion for acting. In his 20 plus years in the industry, Logue has starred in films such as, The Tao of Steve, the story of a larger-than-life, philosophizing lothario, which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, and won him a Special Jury Prize for Outstanding Performance. His other film credits include Sneakers, Gettysburg, Blade, Runaway Bride, Reindeer Games, The Million Dollar Hotel, Comic Book Villains with Michael Rapaport, Confidence, Just Like Heaven, and The Groomsmen with Ed Burns. Recently, Donal co-starred in Max Payne with Mark Wahlberg, as well as Charlie St. Cloud with Zac Ephron. He also appeared in Zodiac, directed by David Fincher, based on the Robert Graysmith books about the notorious Zodiac serial killer. Following the US release of Zodiac, he co-starred in Mark Steven Johnson's Ghost Rider with Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes. Logue made his directorial debut with the independent film Tennis, Anyone?, which appeared at the US Comedy Arts Festival. He wrote, starred, and directed the film about two Hollywood has-beens who try and find meaning in their lives through a series of celebrity tennis tournaments. In television, Logue joined the cast of the NBC series \"LIFE\" about a former police officer who returns to the force after having been wrongly imprisoned for years. In 2007, he headlined the critically lauded ABC comedy \"The Knights of Prosperity\" in which a group of blue collar guys band together to plan a heist of Mick Jagger's New York City apartment. Prior to \"The Knights of Prosperity\" Logue starred in the Carsey-Warner produced show, \"Grounded for Life\" which aired for five seasons. He was also featured in a recurring role on \"ER\" as Sherry Stringfield's love interest. In 2010, Logue finished a critically acclaimed season on \"Terriers,\" a television series created by Ted Griffin and Shawn Ryan for FX. He begins production on the Marc Cherry pilot \"Hallelujah\" for ABC in March of 2011. Logue lives in Los Angeles and has two children.\n\nMichael Ironside has made a strong and indelible impression with his often incredibly intense and explosive portrayals of fearsome villains throughout the years. He was born as Frederick Reginald Ironside on February 12, 1950 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Ironside was a successful arm wrestler in his teenage years. His initial ambition was to be a writer. At age fifteen, Michael wrote a play called \"The Shelter\" that won first prize in a Canada-wide university contest; He used the prize money to mount a production of this play. Ironside attended the Ontario College of Art, took acting lessons from Janine Manatis, and studied for three years at the Canadian National Film Board. Ironside worked in construction as a roofer prior to embarking on an acting career.\n\nIronside first began acting in movies in the late 1970s. He received plenty of recognition with his frightening turn as deadly and powerful psychic Darryl Revok in David Cronenberg's Scanners - Ihre Gedanken können töten (1981). He was likewise very chilling as vicious misogynistic psychopath Colt Hawker in the underrated Das Horror-Hospital (1982). Other memorable film roles include weary Detective Roersch in the sadly forgotten thriller Gehetzt (1983), the crazed Overdog in the immensely enjoyable Spacehunter - Jäger im All (1983), the hard-nosed Jester in the blockbuster smash Top Gun (1986), ramrod Major Paul Hackett in Ausgelöscht (1987), loner Vietnam veteran \"Ben\" in Die Unbarmherzigen (1987), the ferocious Lem Johnson in Watchers - gnadenlos gejagt (1988), and lethal immortal General Katana in Highlander II - Die Rückkehr (1991).\n\nMoreover, Ironside has appeared in two highly entertaining science fiction features for Paul Verhoeven: At his savage best as the evil Richter in Total Recall - Die totale Erinnerung (1990) and typically excellent as the rugged Lieutenant Jean Rasczak in Starship Troopers (1997). Ironside showed a more tender and thoughtful side with his lovely and touching performance as a hardened convict who befriends a disabled man in the poignant indie drama gem Raw Deal (1991); he also co-wrote the script and served as an executive producer for this beautiful sleeper. Michael was terrific as tough mercenary Ham Tyler on the epic miniseries V: Die außerirdischen Besucher kommen zurück (1984), its follow up V: Die außerirdischen Besucher kommen (1984), and subsequent short-lived spin-off series.\n\nIronside also had a recurring role on the television series SeaQuest (1993). Among the television series he has done guest spots on are Das A-Team (1983), Polizeirevier Hill Street (1981), Mike Hammer (1984), Hitchhiker - Unglaubliche Geschichten (1983), Geschichten aus der Gruft (1989), Superman (1996), Walker, Texas Ranger (1993), Outer Limits: Die unbekannte Dimension (1995), Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994), Smallville (2001), Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994), Desperate Housewives (2004), Die Liga der Gerechten (2001) and Masters of Horror (2005). More recently, Ironside garnered a slew of plaudits and a Gemini Award nomination for his outstanding portrayal of shrewd biker gang leader Bob Durelle in the acclaimed Canadian miniseries The Last Chapter II: The War Continues (2003).\n\nIn addition to his substantial film and television work, Ironside has also lent his distinctive deep voice to TV commercials and video games.\n\nIncisive, gravelly-voiced screen tough guy Powers Boothe was born on June 1, 1948 in Snyder, Texas, a sharecropper's son. Used to hard physical work \"chopping cotton\" as a youngster, he went on to become the first member of his family to attend university. He then proceeded to study acting via a fellowship with Southern Methodist University and graduated with a degree in Fine Arts. His performing career began in repertory with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.\n\nIn 1974, Boothe arrived in New York after theatrical stints in Connecticut and Philadelphia. It took another five years before he made his breakthrough on Broadway as a swaggering Texas cowboy in James McLure's comedy play \"Lone Star\". His Emmy-winning performance as Reverend Jim Jones in the miniseries Guyana-Massaker - Tor zur Hölle (1980) led to a permanent move to Los Angeles. Lucrative screen offers followed and Boothe became firmly established as a leading actor after being well cast as Raymond Chandler's hard-boiled Philip Marlowe (1983), HBO's first drama series, set in 1930s Los Angeles.\n\nThough his portfolio of characters would eventually comprise assorted sheriffs, military brass and FBI agents, Boothe appreciated the indisputable fact that bad guys were often the \"last in people's minds\" and playing them could be \"more fun\". Arguably, his most convincing (and oddly likeable) villain was snarling gunslinger Curly Bill Brocius, confronting the Earps in Tombstone (1993). He went on to tackle such complex characters as White House Chief of Staff Alexander Haig in Oliver Stone's Nixon - Der Untergang eines Präsidenten (1995), hawkish Vice President Noah Daniels on 24: Twenty Four (2001) and industrialist power broker Lamar Wyatt in Nashville (2012).\n\nOne of his best remembered roles remains that of Cy Tolliver, the (fictional) owner of the (historical) Bella Union saloon and brothel, chief nemesis of Al Swearingen on HBO's Deadwood (2004). Boothe particularly enjoyed his lengthy soliloquies which reminded him of his time on the Shakespearean stage. The tall Texan with the penetrating eyes was rather gleefully (and enjoyably) over-the-top fiendish as Senator Roark in the post film noir Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For (2014) and managed (at least near the end) to inject some humanity into the role of Gideon Malick, the sinister head of HYDRA, in Marvel's Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013).\n\nAs is so often the case with actors of the 'hard-boiled school', Boothe has often been described as the very antithesis of the characters he essayed on screen. Sin City director Robert Rodriguez fittingly eulogised him as \"a towering Texas gentleman and world class artist\". Powers Boothe died in his sleep, in Los Angeles, at age 68 on the morning of May 14, 2017 of a heart attack after battling pancreatic cancer for six months."
