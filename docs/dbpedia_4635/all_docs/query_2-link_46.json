But if you want, here is what Vegeta said in Dragon Ball Super anime.\n\nThe Dragon Ball Super anime material actually states that Ultimate Gohan was stronger than Goku in the Boo Saga.\n\nPlus, Vegeta didn't actually say that in Herms's translations (which are word-for-word and more literal to the original Japanese):\n\nMinute: 10~11\n\nContext: Vegeta thinks about Goku as he gets increasing frustrated with being stuck at the resort instead of training (and people in the crowd keep bumping into him)\n\nVegeta: \"After defeating Majin Boo, there should be no doubts that he's Number One…But he stills keeps on training anyway…And so…I…can't…stay here…and fall…even further…\"\n\nHe states that Goku is Number One, not that he is the number one in the entire universe. He says the same thing when Goku is fighting Kid Boo, after basically making a recap of their entire rivalry together. The context is heavily only on their rivalry.\n\nPlus, Vegeta also states this in the same episode:\n\nMinute: 19~20\n\nVegeta: \"Kakarot…The one I've acknowledged as the strongest Saiyan…But Kakarot, I have no intention of being content with staying Number Two forever! Someday I will surpass you! No, I'll surpass every living being in this universe…and become the supreme Number One!\"\n\nVegeta makes a distinction between surpassing Goku and being the supreme Number One who stands above everyone else in the universe - this means that Vegeta knows Goku isn't the strongest in the universe, and he knows there is someone on Earth who surpasses even Goku. Who is that? Gohan, of course.\n\nGohan is stated multiple times, once in the Daizenshuu and twice in the original manga, to have become the mightiest warrior and the strongest in the universe after having his potential drawn out by Elder Kaioshin. Goku was literally two feet away from Gohan both times the statement were made:\n\nChapter: 479 (DBZ 285), P10.1-5\n\nElder Kaioshin: Hey, you over there [Gohan], you were the one who pulled the sword out, right? Come over here a little. If someone could pull that sword out and swing it around, then once I get through with them they'll de~~efinitely be able to become the best in the universe.\"\n\nAfter Elder Kaioshin is introduced, he states that, if he drew out Gohan's dormant potential, he'd become the strongest in the universe. Gohan himself, after sensing his own power after his potential was drawn out, confirmed the description as true:\n\nChapter: 496 (DBZ 302), P4.1-2\n\nGohan: \"Ho-how can I turn into this mightiest of warriors!?\"\n\nElder Kaioshin: \"You transform into that Super whatever-it-is a lot, right? You'll be fine if you just get the gist of that, and throw in a kiai.\"\n\nGohan: \"The gist of Super Saiyan…I-I got it…!\"\n\nSo yeah, Gohan is the strongest and always was.\n\nKepekley23 said:\n\n> The second, fourth, and fifth image isn't anime-inclusive.

Makes sense.\n\nKepekley23 said:\n\nPlus, Super Saiyan Gotenks Pre-RoSaT was stated by Goku to surpass himself as a Super Saiyan 3 - and Piccolo actually states Gotenks is as strong as expected upon his transformation.\n\nBase Gotenks was further implied to have become even stronger than his Super Saiyan self after his training in the RoSaT, and he still has SSj and SSj3 to boost himself.\n\nGoku is just an ant in the Boo Arc.\n\n1. Goku doesn't even know how strong Gotenks is since he never witness them fuse in person, he was just making an hyperthentical guess. Kamiccolo never said anything about Gotenks being stronger than Goku either, upon seeing Super Saiyan Gotenks, he stated can you move. That doesn't say anything much.\n\n2. We sadly do not know that for sure if base Gotenks after RoSaT is stronger than his past Super Saiyan self, that is considered an headcanon unless someone said so.\n\n3. Let's look at Goku's position everytime he meet Super Buu shall we?\n\nFirst time was Buutenks, well obviously he would get screwed up like Gohan did.\n\nWhen he meet Buuccolo, he was laughing in confidance stated even his son can beat him now. Who was the one fighting and standing against Buuccolo at the time? Both Goku and Gohan. That's even part should easily tell you why Goku is stronger than Gohan, because Goku was indirectly making fun of Buuccolo saying Super Buu has gotten so weak that even the weakest fighter among them standing can kick his ass. Also notice Super Buu enjoys testing and fighting stronger opponents, by absorbing weaker opponents to surpass them like he did with Gohan when he absorbed Gotenks and Kamiccolo, now it's Goku's turn when he absorbed Gohan.\n\nThe Buuhan part is easily self-explanatory.\n\nLet's look at Goku and Vegeta being trapped inside of Super Buu's body. THEY WERE A FREAKING MOLECULE SIZED CELLS TRAPPED INSIDE OF SUPER BUU'S BODY!!! PUT EITHER GOTENKS OR GOHAN IN THEIR POSITION, THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING MUCH EITHER!!! CAN WE AT LEAST LOOK AT THEIR POSITION FIRST BEFORE WE JUMP TO CONCLUSION?!\n\nThere you have it. Goku wasn't an ant in Buu Saga.\n\n> 1. Goku doesn't even know how strong Gotenks is since he never witness them fuse, he was just making an hyperthentical guess. Kamiccolo never said anything about Gotenks being stronger than Goku either, upon seeing Super Saiyan Gotenks, he stated can you move. That doesn't say anything much.\n\nGoku's estimates for Gotenks were never contradicted. When they first fuse as Base Gotenks, Piccolo straight up shoots them down and say they're no match. When they finally refuse as Super Saiyans, Piccolo states that their ki really was just that incredible - and tells him that his power was okay, but his speed needed to be tested.\n\nWhen Gotenks actually tells Piccolo the tests are over and he will go kill Fat Boo, Piccolo only tries to tell him that he only has one minute left to stay fused before they drift off. He never commented on Gotenks not having power - he actually implies he has, several times.\n\nPlus, the Japanese summary for the volume where Gotenks is born confirms that Goten and Trunks perfected the Fusion to at last kill Fat Boo, before he is changed into Super Boo.\n\n> 2. We sadly do not know that were sure if base Gotenks after RoSaT is stronger than his past Super Saiyan self, that is considered an headcanon unless someone said so.\n\nWhen Piccolo senses Super Boo's ki, he tells Krillin to go wake Goten and Trunks up and tell them to train in the RoSaT because they now had no chance:\n\nChapter: 487 (DBZ 293), P13.5\n\nContext: as Piccolo plans on having Goten and Trunks train in the Room of Spirit and Time\n\nPiccolo: \"Can't you tell…?! As they are now, even if they perform Fusion they can't win, no doubt about it…! Tell them that if they don't want to die while they're still just little brats, then they should train as much as they can…!\"\n\nHowever, when Piccolo senses Base Gotenks's ki after he trains, he states that Gotenks has massively powered up and that this just might mean a miracle. This was before it was revealed they could go SSJ even after fusing, so the statement is about Base Gotenks:\n\nChapter: 489 (DBZ 295), P11.5\n\nContext: seeing Gotenks after he'd trained in the Room of Spirit and Time\n\nPiccolo: \"He-he really is different…! He really has greatly powered up…! Th-this just might…!\"\n\nTrunks also states that Base Gotenks would be about as strong as Super Boo (who was suppressed at the time), and Piccolo's statement above confirms this. However, due to Super Boo being initially suppressed, their original predictions fail when they start to fight.\n\nSo that means Base Gotenks (post-RoSaT) > SSj Gotenks (Pre-RoSaT)\n\n> When he meet Buuccolo, he was laughing confident at his power stated even his son can beat him now. Who was the one fighting and standing against Buuccolo at the time? Both Goku and Gohan. That's even part should easily tell you why Goku is stronger than Gohan, because Goku was indirectly making fun of Buuccolo saying he is so weak that even the weakest fighter among us standing can kick your ass.\n\nHe doesn't say that at all.\n\nChapter: 502 (DBZ 308), P10.4-5\n\nContext: after Gotenks-absorbed Boo's time limit runs out and Gotenks inside him turns back into Goten and Trunks\n\nGoku: \"Your power's fallen a whole lot. Cheh…I'm a little disappointed. This way, Gohan will be able to beat you even on his own…\"\n\nHe states that Gohan would be able to beat Boo even on his ow. This is because Goku and Gohan were planning to merge with the Potara before Gotenks's fusion runs out inside Boo:\n\nChapter: 501 (DBZ 307), P6.2-6\n\nContext: Elder Kaioshin gives the Potara to Goku\n\nElder Kaioshin: \"Here! Put this Potara on your left ear! [ ] Put the other one on Gohan's ear. Just by doing that, you two will be able to merge together! Like with Fusion.\"\n\nGoku: \"Huh! Re-really!?\"\n\nElder Kaioshin: \"Of course. And what's more, the effect is greater than with Fusion! This has been the trump card treasure of the Kaioshins since long ago.\"\n\nGoku stated he was no match for Super Boo later on.\n\n> Let's look at Goku and Vegeta trapped inside of Super Buu's body. THEY WERE A FREAKING MOLECULE SIZED CELL TRAPPED INSIDE OF SUPER BUU'S BODY!!! PUT EITHER GOTENKS OR GOHAN IN THEIR POSITION, THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING EITHER!!!\n\nExcept Goku didn't know he was small until Super Boo actually told him so, and that was after his statement about being no match for Boo. He had an arrogant smirk when he thought he could just blast Boo from the inside and escape, but his smirk dropped and he became extremely frightened when the blast just bounced back - Super Boo then amusingly told him he was smaller than a flea.\n\nPlus, Goku stated that if they went outside, they'd still lose. When they actually went outside after ripping out Boo's pod, they instantly returned to normal size.\n\nSorry but you're wrong."
