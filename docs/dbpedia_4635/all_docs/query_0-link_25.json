        "text": "@herecomestheboom_headshot: No in fact he does not, but for a majority of spells he might need them. We rarely see him perform Wandless magic even if he can do it.\n\nWands are used to channel magical energy more effectively, non-verbal and wandless spells can be cast but are not as powerful.\n\nHowever, without the ability to cast Avada Kedavra he has limited chances to kill or KO without getting far closer to Sylar to insure a win.\n\n@nerx: He cannot regen like Buu I think he was being funny. Claire has been seen to be frozen entirely solid and shatter and then be standing there good as new less then a minute later (Scared the hell out of the girl who froze her on accident too)\n\n@herecomestheboom_headshot: Lol too true, its hard to keep up on which one when I see your name.\n\n@kingjohnrocks:\n\nExploding Charms and Severing Charms won't work on a guy who can regenerate the way Sylar does. And none of the fire spells outside of Fiendfyre have shown serious damage with their flames.\n\nAlso he has never been shown to create his own spells on the fly. Creating spells takes time this is why people are impressed with Snape for making so many.\n\n@shadowpro:\n\nVolde has only ever used Wandless magic in the movies, not once in the books. In the books he always uses his wand. Dumbledore has been seen using it in the books, this doesn't mean Volde can even use it if this is Book Volde. Even so it takes a powerful and disciplined wizard to perform them effectively meaning they are weaker in that they cannot be cast as casually. Also all shown versions of spells seemed to be weaker. This may have just been portrayal rather then a real weakness.\n\n@ssjlozza said:\n\n@shadowpro: Ok then what evidence do you have that Sylar's powers wouldn't work against someone just because they use magic?\n\nwell for starters there is the fact that the series is only SCIENCE FICTION not MAGIC, and his powers have never beeing tested against such power, also there is no prove that it would work either\n\n@perpetr8rmike said:\n\nVolde has only ever used Wandless magic in the movies, not once in the books.

Even so it takes a powerful and disciplined wizard to perform them effectively meaning they are weaker in that they cannot be cast as casually. Also all shown versions of spells seemed to be weaker. This may have just been portrayal rather then a real weakness.\n\nso, what you are saying, is that Lord Voldemort, the dark lord, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the most powerfull dark wizard ever known by men or women in HP verse, is incapable of something so simple for experienced wizards as doing wandless magic? ('cuz that's what I got)\n\nbesides, the op doesn't say if is only the book versionor the movie one, so it's probably both\n\nalso, he even without knowing anything about the magic world, he was helluva wizard when he was just a child\n\n@kingjohnrocks: I am aware that they can create spells, but not on the fly on the spot. Spell Creation takes time. This is why Luna has no mommy, she tried to make a spell and it backfired and killed her. On the fly it is impossible.\n\nAnd I pointed out that only Fiendfyre had any damage feats, the others do not. I was agreeing Fiendfyre could kill Sylar.\n\n@shadowpro: During battles like this we must forgo the 'But magic might not work' mentality because it makes the Battle Thread Moot.\n\nI am saying in the movie was the only time he was shown using it, showing he favors to use his wand. The Wand channels the magic into a more focused form, thus it is going to be stronger due to focus. I did not say they where weak as in they where impossible to effect someone just weaker then when the Channeling Device (AKA Wand) is used.\n\nVolde was not a helluva wizard as a child, he used unfocused wandless magic to make people see horrible things. He created scary things to other children. Harry was flying, Shrinking Clothing, Disappearing items, etc. Neville made himself bounce after being dropped from the second or third story window of his home by his uncle.\n\n@shadowpro said:\n\n@ssjlozza said:\n\n@shadowpro: Ok then what evidence do you have that Sylar's powers wouldn't work against someone just because they use magic?\n\nwell for starters there is the fact that the series is only SCIENCE FICTION not MAGIC, and his powers have never beeing tested against such power, also there is no prove that it would work either\n\n@perpetr8rmike said:\n\nVolde has only ever used Wandless magic in the movies, not once in the books.

Why do you say that when there is no evidence of it? By that token Voldemort could beat Goku as his powers technically aren't magic either, and if you say that I will KNOW you're trolling! You have no evidence whatsoever for what you're saying. So, tell me when have Voldemorts powers ever been tested against science fiction, afterall they're only magic, not science fiction.\n\nSylar was able to react to a guy who could run something like 700 miles per hour. From only a few meters away when the guy sped up.\n\nHe can shoot telekinetic bullets IIRC, he can provide enough force to lift a prisoner transport vehicle off the ground and bring it to himself.\n\nAnd he has one weak point, which he can move around at will within his body.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into the creative stuff.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nFloopay\n\nMy vote is for Sylar. He has many ways to win and Voldemort has only Avada Kedavra.\n\nThese are the powers that Sylar has in the episode Five Years Gone:\n\nIntuitive aptitude\n\nTelekinesis\n\nShattering\n\nFreezing\n\nMelting\n\nEnhanced hearing\n\nArtistic Precognition\n\nInduced radioactivity\n\nRapid cellular regeneration\n\nFlight\n\nPhasing\n\nIllusion\n\n@perpetr8rmike said:\n\nHe cannot regen like Majin Buu who can regen from smoke.\n\nI think he was referring to the speed with which Sylar regenerates.\n\nIncidentally, Buu's regeneration is only at the cellular level but that's another topic.\n\n@floopay said:\n\nSylar was able to react to a guy who could run something like 700 miles per hour. From only a few meters away when the guy sped up.\n\nDo you mean Edgar? That guy could reach at least the speed of Mach 2."
