        "text": "I think it doesn't work narrative and feat wise, Freeza Got the best feats so Far in the story and narrative wise Goku doesn't believe all 3 of them are cable of defeating Freeza\n\nAnd that ofcours ignoring Galactic patrol arc and Granolah arc\n\nThe fuck you mean all 3 of them?\n\nRaw PL is now portrayed as being only one aspect of what makes a good fighter and the mental element is a huge component. Goku has been regressed to being a novice who’s too stupid to figure out that he needs to do more than just beef up his muscles if he wants his power to reach new heights.\n\nFrieza has trained for a decade and seemingly figured out some stuff Vegeta and Goku haven’t.\n\nThe narration works, even if it’s rife with stupidity.\n\nThe fuck you mean all 3 of them?\n\nRaw PL is now portrayed as being only one aspect of what makes a good fighter and the mental element is a huge component. Goku has been regressed to being a novice who’s too stupid to figure out that he needs to do more than just beef up his muscles if he wants his power to reach new heights.\n\nFrieza has trained for a decade and seemingly figured out some stuff Vegeta and Goku haven’t.\n\nThe narration works, even if it’s rife with stupidity.\n\nBy narrative I mean Freeza being matched in a 1on1 by anyone right now (doesn't matter if it was Hax or fighting skills)\n\nAnd honestly I hated the \"novice Goku\" part because didn't Goku pull the same thing vegeta aim for against Ginya ?\n\nMoro and later Gas are said to be the highest ki Goku ever felt.\n\nSo doesn't that mean they were stronger than LSSJ Broly?\n\nI tried to headcannon Broly being surpassed was just his Base and not his highest form. (Assuming he couldn't jump to it at will.)\n\nBut narratively, I have to concede that was never stated.\n\nIf Moro and Gas are the highest Ki's Goku ever felt, then Broly has already been surpassed.\n\nBlack Frieza by extension, is above them all.\n\nThey're probably comparable. Impossible to say for sure who is stronger.\n\nBut I'm going to go with Freeza if Moro at his best is actually superior to FP-SSJ Broly.\n\nManga Scaling:\n\nTier 0\n\nWhis\n\nTier 1\n\nMSSJB Gogeta/Vegetto\n\nTier 2\n\nGohan Beast, Freeza Black, Beerus\n\nTier 3\n\nGas, UI Goku, UE Vegeta, Granolah, Moro-73, FP-SSJ Broly\n\nTier 4\n\nCell Max\n\nTier 5\n\nJiren & Orange Piccolo\n\nMoro is not stronger than Broly.\n\nPlease can you provide the evidence for this. I'm interested in seeing it.\n\nGoku claims Moro was his toughest opponent yet. But it’s not a PL statement. He meant difficult to fight, just like Majin Buu was due to how pesky handling him was.\n\nMy bad I meant Super Saiyan\n\nHard to see.\n\nWe know in the movie that SSJ Gogeta outperformed SSJB Goku. In the Mangaverse that'd be MSSJB Goku.\n\nThe Gamma's are said to be comparable to Goku & Vegeta, but I think they were compared to their Moro Arc MSSJB selves, as opposed UI-Omen Goku & SSJBE Vegeta. I'd say Orange Piccolo is comparable to Moro Arc UI-Omen Goku & SSJBE Vegeta.\n\nSo current SSJ Gogeta/Vegetto would probably be around as strong as Orange Piccolo & Jiren if not a bit stronger. But I couldn't see him beating Cell Max without going higher than SSJ.\n\nTo be honest I'm not positive though.\n\nBroly is the benchmark by Toriyama\n\nBroly is comparable to Beerus\n\nBlack Freeza got called weaker than Beerus by V-Jump\n\nBroly still is stronger at the moment unless stated otherwise.\n\nBefore people say \"But Goku is hiding Broly from Freeza!\", he was doing the same thing in the movie timeline, where Freeza doesn't have anything above Golden. He's hiding Broly from Freeza because Freeza can manipulate him and use him against the universe. I thought Black Freeza was stronger but they still put him below Beerus while Broly is put on his level. So we'll see. I hope he's stronger though, can't be a decent threat if this caveman can handle you if he gets mad enough.\n\nBroly is the benchmark by Toriyama\n\nBrenchmark by one of the no-name staff which Toyataro didn't agree on.\n\nBroly is comparable to Beerus\n\nAccording to Goku who doesn't know Beerus's full power, and the same Goku proceed to claim Moro is stronger than anyone he has ever fought before from the following saga.\n\nBlack Freeza got called weaker than Beerus by V-Jump\n\nThe same Frieza who one-shotted the strongest mortal in Universe 7, ask yourself this question if Broly is a mortal or not.\n\nBroly still is stronger at the moment unless stated otherwise.\n\nToronbo to Granolah: So your wish is to become the strongest mortal aside from Gods themselves?\n\nBefore people say \"But Goku is hiding Broly from Freeza!\", he was doing the same thing in the movie timeline, where Freeza doesn't have anything above Golden. He's hiding Broly from Freeza because Freeza can manipulate him and use him against the universe. I thought Black Freeza was stronger but they still put him below Beerus while Broly is put on his level. So we'll see. I hope he's stronger though, can't be a decent threat if this caveman can handle you if he gets mad enough.\n\nMeanwhile Broly in the same movie/saga is stated weaker than Cell Max according to WOG, the same Cell Max who couldn't make Gohan Beast flinch with his punch.\n\nBefore people say \"But Goku is hiding Broly from Freeza!\", he was doing the same thing in the movie timeline, where Freeza doesn't have anything above Golden. He's hiding Broly from Freeza because Freeza can manipulate him and use him against the universe.\n\nWasn't that always obvious lol?\n\nGoku and Vegeta can't even readily rely on Broly to aid them if they have to face Black Frieza. He's as likely to attack them as he's to attack Frieza if he snaps. Frieza is perfectly aware of this and cunning enough to just go get Broly and somehow convince him that he should get revenge for Paragus because Goku and Vegeta killed him even though they did not."
