Could you be one of those legendary creatures, in the flesh? I have heard about all the planets you've destroyed- you are evil incarnate! I never thought I would ever meet a Majin! ” —Lord slug, the evil Namekian\n\nPhysical Description[edit]\n\nMajin are beings made entirely out of magic. With the only consistent trait being that touching a majin feels like touching bubblegum, a majin can have almost any look a person can imagine. Majin do not possess a gender, instead simply going by the pronoun that fits the form they are currently using. They also do not have any hair. Instead, they use chunks of their own body to make it look like they have something that looks like hair. Most majin also have black in their eyes instead of white, but that color, like their skin, can be as varied the majin itself. Their entire body is made of a shapeable substance resembling bubblegum, and they lack any form of internal organs. Due to being the \"umpteenth\" generation of majin, newer majins quickly loose their shapeshifting abilities a day or two after their birth, leaving them in the form they were currently using for the rest of their lives.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nAt the creation of the universe, the manifestation of pure evil was born, and it called itself \"Majin Buu\". After many centuries of erasing entire galaxies, Majin Buu absorbed an entity of pure good and became a childlike, neutral, creature, that merely followed its master’s order for the promise of candy. But when Majin Buu was sealed and sent to his master’s next target planet, its master died, and after awakening once more, the neutral entity separated. After fighting both its good half and the mighty warriors of earth, the evil Majin Buu was destroyed, leaving only the good half alive. Feeling lonely being the only one of its kind, the good Majin Buu separated once more, multiplying into the hundreds, thus creating the majin race.\n\nSociety[edit]\n\nThe majin do not possess a society of their own, but instead try their best to integrate with the society it finds the most interesting. Due to their innate, childlike behavior and curiosity, most majin never settle down, instead opting to spend their immortal lives traveling the world to find the most interesting people and the tastiest candy.\n\nMajin Names[edit]\n\nDue to their innate simplicity, almost all in the majin race simply calls themselves \"Majin\" followed a noise they think is funny. Later generations of majin take on names associated with magic. The rarest majin naming convention comes from those who live in coexistence with a creature they have absorbed, in which case they rise the two names together.\n\nSample names: Majin Buu, Majin Bob, Majin Mani Mani, Majin Kabra, Majin Salaga, Majin Goma, Majuub, Janembuu, Majitan.\n\nMajin Traits[edit]\n\nMajin race from the Dragonball series.\n\nAbility Score Increase. Your Strength score and Constitution increases by 2. Your Intelligence score is reduced by 2.\n\nAge. A majin are born with a mature body and a majin has never been documented to die of old age. A majin rarely mature mentally, remaining the childlike personality of its progenitor.\n\nAlignment. Although all majin are born with a liking to violence, they value friendship over any fight, and food even more so. Being children at heart, almost every single majin is as chaotic as a person can get, and being beings of pure hearts, most majin are good. Some have been known to be neutral, but since the death of the evil Buu, evil majins are extremely rare.\n\nSize. Standing from barely 5 feet tall to just below 7 feet tall, and weighing somewhere between 120 and 360 pounds, a majins looks can vary vastly, to the point where you may question if two majin even belong to the same race. When a majin has found a shape they like, or if they spent to much time deciding form, they remain in that form for the rest of their lives. Your size is Medium.\n\nSpeed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\nRubber Limbs. Although most newborn majin’s shapeshifting abilities have been lost, they still possess a small portion of the magic their originator wielded. As a bonus action to elongate your limbs, extending your reach to 10 feet. If you attack using a weapon with the heavy weapon property while using this trait, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your limbs remain elongated until you use a bonus action to shorten them.\n\nBubblegum Body. You are immune to diseases, resistance to poison damage and have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.\n\nLanguages. You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. This language should have something to do with the culture the majin was raised in.\n\nSubrace. The majin race has three subraces. Those are the mighty majins, the wonder majins, and the pure majins.\n\nMighty Majin[edit]\n\nBuu Buu Volley. Most Mighty majin live, eat, and breath for fighting and the evolution of their bodies have adapted to show off their combat prowess. Your fists are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier.\n\nBuu Absorption. When you or an ally reduce a Medium or smaller creature with 10 feet of you to 0 hit points, you can absorb it destroying its body and gaining hit points equal to your level. When a majin does this they often take on aspects of the personality of the person they just absorbed.\n\nWonder Majin[edit]\n\nChocolate. The magical nature of the majin race has left them with a great magical reserve inside themselves. A Wonder majin is a majin who has begun to tap into said power and has found a use for it both in combat and in everyday life. As a reaction, when you or an ally reduce a creature to 0 hit points you can transform the body of that creature into a piece of candy for 24 hours. If eaten anytime during those 24 hours the creature's body is destroyed and the creature that consumed the candy gains 1 max hit point.\n\nChildlike Wonder. Almost every majin lives their lives with the mind of a child in an adult body, and the wonder majin has the hardest time of all majins to \"grow up\". You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened, as most wonder majins don't fully comprehend fear.\n\nPure Majin[edit]\n\nBuu Explosion. When backed into a corner, a pure majin throws away all thoughts of self-preservation, and will unleash all of its inner energy reserves in order to kill whatever is unfortunate enough currently be standing in its way. As an action, you can force all creatures in a 20-foot radius centered on you to make a Dexterity saving throw or take force damage equal to all your remaining hit dice. This trait consumes all hit dice used and cannot be used again until the end of a long rest if you have no hit dice remaining. The saving throw for this ability equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. You automatically fail this saving throw and creatures that succeed take half as much damage.\n\nDead Focus. The mindset of most pure majins is dead set on killing everyone and everything that stand in their way, and they have become exceptionally good at doing just that. When you miss an attack roll you can make the attack again taking the new result. Once you use this trait you cannot use this trait again until you have complete a long rest.\n\nRandom Height and Weight[edit]\n\nBase\n\nHeight Height\n\nModifier* Base\n\nWeight Weight\n\nModifier** 5′ 0'' +2d10 120 lb. × (2d6) lb.\n\nSuggested Characteristics[edit]\n\nWhen creating a Majin character, you can use the following table of flaws to help flesh out your character. Use these tables in addition to, or in place of your background's characteristics.\n\nd6 Flaw 1 If people do not share food, I steal their food. 2 I get angry at seemingly nothing. 3 I seek to kill anyone who steals my food. 4 I won't share, even if not sharing leads to the death of another. 5 I cannot read, and I fail to understand basic logic. 6 A murderous demon rests within me, telling me to kill everyone I see."
