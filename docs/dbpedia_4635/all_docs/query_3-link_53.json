His crazy op magic aside, does everyone for the most part think he’s between SSJ1/SSJ2 Vegetto tier or could he actually match the fusion in strength?\n\nSorta hard to believe he could, even after all of his absorptions over the years. Unless he got ahold of some real power houses we don’t know about. Still didn't think he could close the gap and be on SSJ2 Vegettos level but I also never thought that SSJ3 Vegetto would ever be needed to put SSJ2 Bra down until that happened. So unless that was just rule of cool for the arts sake I’m not so sure where he’s at anymore.\n\nGuess it also depends on how serious Buu might have been during his fight with the buffed up U18 Gotenks who seemed to be around SSJ1 Vegetto level if I remember hearing right. Vegetto was sweating a little bit watching that fight to be fair, while Buu honestly looked like he wasn’t trying at all.\n\nI suppose Buu could have also trained over the years but that’s still quite a gap to close. But I could see DBM just fudging his strength up to make him a match for Vegetto with how lax the power scaling seems to be lately, though I think SSJ2 should still be able to handle him.\n\nThough i’m also in the camp thinking that SSJ1 Vegetto should be able to handle SSJ2 Bra without too hard of an effort and don’t think she’d stand much of a chance against a serious Zen Buu. So him being at least SSJ1 Vegetto level seems likely, if not a bit stronger.\n\nWould he need to be stronger or would his added op magic close the gap enough between Vegetto and himself if they threw down?\n\nPost by Skarr on\n\nThe in-universe reason is that the universe is big and Zen Buu could've absorbed a lot of people on top of fight others to get so strong.\n\nThe real reason is Zen Buu is a goddamn Mary Sue and can be wanked to be as strong as Salagir likes him to be. No recent developments have not changed my stance on that.\n\nI suppose the character isn't for everyone. I've always like alternate universes in like DC and Marvel where a villain wins and seeing what they do after. Some have great potential but can't be allowed to get that far in the main continuity or the heroes lose. Buu had the most potential out of any DB villain with all his abilities so I liked seeing a more powerful version after he won in his universe. It was his first time having the freedom to do more than his original purpose when he was created.\n\nSalagir seems to just blurt out random bs when asked about his top tier power characters anymore, Though I know he should be the best source when it comes down to where they stand and also where these top tier titans are strength wise when they throw down with each other.\n\nTo be fair, Twitch doesn't offer the chance for detailed answers due to how many questions are being asked. People can email him or ask questions on the DBM discord since he can go into more detail on there.\n\nPost by godjacob on\n\nThe in-universe reason is that the universe is big and Zen Buu could've absorbed a lot of people on top of fight others to get so strong.\n\nThe real reason is Zen Buu is a goddamn Mary Sue and can be wanked to be as strong as Salagir likes him to be.

Least on a concept level.\n\nMy issue with Zen Buu is his abilities have shifted from logical extensions of himself and who he absorbed into literal reality warping powers without rhyme or reason. How much the plot seems to favor him compared to other characters and just in general becoming less interesting as time has gone on (Then again I dislike \"smart\" Buu in general so that is less a DBM complaint and more a Buutenks/Buuhan complaint).\n\nPost by godjacob on\n\nMy issue with Zen Buu is his abilities have shifted from logical extensions of himself and who he absorbed into literal reality warping powers without rhyme or reason. How much the plot seems to favor him compared to other characters and just in general becoming less interesting as time has gone on (Then again I dislike \"smart\" Buu in general so that is less a DBM complaint and more a Buutenks/Buuhan complaint).\n\nThat's fair but I didn't really see it that way. He already had basic reality warping powers since he can turn people into food or materialize matter in the Buu saga. The Dragonballs were created by the Nameks so I thought it made sense that the strongest magical entity in the series could replicate their power. I think everything he's done so far has been based on existing magic from the original. Absorbing the strongest and smartest people in universe just allowed him to use the same power in more ways.\n\nBiggg difference between what a Namekian can do, and what an Eternal Dragon could do. If what they could do were comparable to that degree, then there wouldn't even need to be dragon balls and Piccolo could make wishes on his own.\n\nThere's based on existing magic and then \"stretch it past any direct comparison to something dumb\" which again is only one of my problems with Zen Buu.\n\nPost by Solus on\n\nBeen lots of talk in the main current chapter about this and I know DBM uses a tier system but things seemed to have changed a bit over the years.\n\nSo power wise, how strong do you all think U4 Buu actually is?

So him being at least SSJ1 Vegetto level seems likely, if not a bit stronger.\n\nWould he need to be stronger or would his added op magic close the gap enough between Vegetto and himself if they threw down?\n\nThose are a lot of questions. Starting with Vegetto vs. Bra, it needs to be considered, that Goku also used SSJ3 to block Cold's attack, when it really wasn't needed. Salagir stated, that characters tend to go to their highest level unless they deliberately want to hold back. So it is to assume that Vegetto didn't need to go SSJ3 against Bra. When they fought initially, it was told that Vegetto only matched Bra's transformations because he wanted to lure Ginyu into changing by showing him his superiority. Going SSJ3 again after the revolt might have been out of anger not out of need.\n\nRegarding how Buu got that strong. Well, it was never stated that Buu can't train, was it? He just never needed to because his power even as Kid Buu was astronimically huge that there never has been anyone rivaling him untill he met South Kaioshin. And then he simply absorbed him and was the strongest. Absorption was always an option for him and at that it was always way more potent than any training could be. An opponent that forces Buu to absorb him would be stronger than him. So absorbing him automatically more than doubles Buu's pl. Now the question is, if all the absorbed people's strength stacks or if Buu can only access the power of the strongest. In canon he said that he has access to both Gotenks' power and Piccolo's intelligence at the same time. But when he fought Vegetto, he never made an attempt to add Gotenks' strength back on top of Gohan's. So there's the question, if Buu is able to stack powers of absorbees at all. Also it is unclear, if he can make Goten and Trunks fuse again while they are absorbed. If he could, which was never shown in canon, he could probably make any other absorbees fuse also for a temporary boost in power. Since he does know the secrets of a better fusion dance, he could make Goku and Vegeta fuse infinitely, which adds the power of Vegetto (or rather Gogeta) on top of his own and on top of Gotenk's and Gohan's. So there you have your answer.\n\nOr, if we assume, that Buu cannot train nor make absorbees fuse again, once the split, he still could absorb millions of beings like Cell did. Look how much of a power boost Cell got by simply draining life energy from a few cities. I doubt that this way of sucking blood is as effective as Buu's absorption. So Buu could even gain more power of it, even by only absorbing regular humans (or human level aliens). I don't think it's far fetched at all that Buu has that much raw strength."
