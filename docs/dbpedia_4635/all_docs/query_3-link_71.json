        "text": "Gohan doesn't have to be above Dabura imo. Gohan could just be a better fighter hand to hand wise, he doesn't have to necessarily be stronger.\n\nAgreed. While Dabura seemed to avoid a hand to hand combat, Gohan really does seem to be struggling more than Dabura was. After the battle, the \"pufs\" indicating exhaustion seems to come solely from Gohan, I confirmed the same in the anime. Goku's \"it's not like Gohan is completely losing\" also confirms his son is in the losr side at the battle. Not to mention Dabura's arrogance later, saying it won't be hard to dispose of the trash, a confidence that's a nice contrast compared to Gohan's concern visible on his face:\n\nWhile it might come off as arrogance (and is, to a certain extent), I think it's safe to give them more or less the same battle power, with Dabura having a slight advantage in skills. Gohan being superior comes off as a little forced to me, analyzing the big picture.\n\nI question if Goku was holding back in his Base/Ssj forms while dealing with Yakkon. The characters generally only speak about each other's full power as in highest power possible, but I would find it odd it Goku was able to do decently against Yakkon and Vegeta in Base wouldn't be able to.\n\nI guess he was holding back initially as SSJ (when they read him as 3000 kiri), but not in base. I like to think the Kiri reading works linearly with battle powers, therefore full power SSJ Goku would be at 7,500 kiri (applying the 10x multiplier).\n\nI don't think there's a need to have him holding back in base. Better saying, Vegeta suspected Goku SSJ2 was ahead of Cell Games Gohan (Goku's burst wasn't stronger than kid Gohan, therefore he wasn't at full power) so I can only make sense of Vegeta's estimations by him knewing base Goku full power and calculating the SSJ2 from there.\n\nBesides, Dabura was pretty surprised at Babidi already sending Yakon (which seems to be the last warrior before Dabura). According to Babidi's spaceship designer drawned into a introduction chapter page, there seems to be 2 stages separating Pui Pui from Yakon, and I'd say a gap of 2x between Pui Pui and base Vegeta should already be plenty (even though I have it as a multifold one). Not to mention Dabura's supreme confidence that Yakon was too much and that he'd take the energy from the three Saiyajin in a matter of seconds. This implies a massive gap between Pui Pui and Yakon, so this latter being able to handle base Vegeta doesn't come off as weird to me.\n\nThe shock Vegeta receives from that is more profound in that manner imo.\n\nVegeta's shock seems to come more from the fact that Goku also surpassed the SSJ wall --> \"so this bastard has also surpassed the SSJ wall\". Upon seeing base Goku in action, Vegeta most likely already knew Goku would end up ahead of him if he really achieved the SSJ2 and he confirmed his rival's superiority after this latter showing he had in fact the form.\n\nI think you have Goten and Trunks a bit too close to Gohan for my tastes. I don't think Gohan can take out the boys in a 2 vs 1 situation, but I also think Gohan should be able to handle them both rather easily in a 1v1 situation. At the end of their sparring, Goten comments how he couldn't even hit Gohan. I'd say the boys are around 80% of Gohan or a bit higher.\n\n80% seems a little too far apart for me. Gohan is visibly struggling to avoid Goten's blows and had to fly in order to not get hit. The 2nd sparring session shows both with an aura and Gohan with all the signals of someone who's struggling (sweating, gree* the teeth). Based on how easy Gohan was avoiding suppressed Cell's attacks, which I have like a 80% gap, Goten has to be closer than this to me. I'd even like to have Goten as high as 93%, but that'd make his base noticeably ahead of #18, which doesn't feel right to me.\n\nHell, even Vegeta seems to have a harder time avoiding Chibi Trunks' punches than he had when avoiding handsome Zarbon's:\n\nI'm not saying with this that Chibi Trunks is closer to Vegeta than Zarbon was since Vegeta was already a bit tired to begin with, but it should show how relevant are the kids power level-wise.\n\nAlso, I get the feeling that the boys are weaker than Piccolo at the Budokai. Piccolo is absolutely shocked by their power at the Lookout and they seem to make a big deal of their power up then.\n\nAgreed. Piccolo doesn't seem overwhelmed by their powers until they displayed their full power, to which he was pushed back quite similarly to when Goku powered up to 100% in the Cell Games. Gonna include a suppressed level for the kids at the Budokai.\n\nI would prefer that Buu Power Up 1 would be at 17,500.\n\nWell, I like to put him still in the realm of Majin Vegeta and Goku SSJ2 due to the latter thinking it's still a power they should surely handle while working together. A monster Zarbon-24k Vegeta gap might work, I guess, but not even after powering up even further against Vegeta, Fat Boo seems to be so ahead of the Prince, enough that Vegeta was still confident on taking Majin Boo and Babidi to hell with him and enough that all of Vegeta's attacks were connecting just fine.\n\nI also think Super Saiyan 3 at 4x is unnecessary. I think 2-3x is more realistic.\n\nI like the 4x multiplier due to Good Boo (who is << half of fat Boo's power) still being considerably above Majin Vegeta SSJ2, as shown in the Kid Boo's fight, whereas even taking aside the regeneration, Good Boo seemed to conect some hits while Vegeta was just utterly useless. A 4x multiplier still allows someone who is was below fat Boo's power being above Majin Vegeta.\n\nPrecisely for this reason, the gap between Majin Vegeta and fat Boo must be pretty big. Upon doing that huge explosion, Majin Boo was already way ahead of Majin Vegeta, as seen by everyone's reactions (with Piccolo flat out ignoring Chibi Trunks' question about his father's chance) and the fact that fat Boo was already considerably above Majin Vegeta even before doing the explosion. He also didn't use full power against Vegeta because...\n\nand I don't think there are any suggested power ups between his fight with Vegeta and his fight with Goku.\n\nthe title of the chapter whereas fat Boo resume his fight with Son Goku SSJ3 is translated as \"Majin Boo begins to show his true worth\" or something like this, showing he still wasn't serious against Vegeta.\n\nSSJ3 being like a 2x multiplier also works rather well with fat Boo being implied to be only a little 2x SSJ2 Gohan, since this latter filled almost half of the energy needed to revive Boo. But this does clash with Good Boo being still >> the SSJ2s, so I just explain that Gohan-sequence, which is quite more explainable than vice-versa imo.\n\nYou've chosen the Super Saiyan Gohan path. Now explain why he couldn't transform into Super Saiyan 2 against Dabura, also explain why they speak about Gohan becoming enraged opposed to doing what he did at the Budokai to win.\n\nI won't deny that are pretty good reasons for Gohan to be a SSJ2 story wise, but the narrative is already fishy either way, with a lot of plot holes, so going with the clearly portrayal of a simple SSJ aura comes as better to me, since this was probably AT's intents, whereas he depicted all confirmed SSJ2 with a consistent electric aura.\n\nIt also makes more sense for Vegeta to have been a SSJ vs Pui Pui, since he knew this latter was a pretty powerful warrior chosen by Babidi, until then a incognit of a character, not to mention Kaioshin's surprise towards base Vegeta's power, while he didn't show such attention towards SSJ2 Gohan in the Budokai. Yet we all know how Vegeta was consistently portrayed as being in base and nothing will change AT's consistent depiction.\n\nSuper Saiyan being a 10x boost ain't going to work mathematically. It's too small to cover the massive gaps in power suggested.\n\nI was pretty much only considering the Boo saga when making this list, without being so much influenced by others sagas. And at the Boo saga, the 10x multiplier seems to be pretty decent to me. Also, doesn't it flow better the kids being ~10x above #18 as opposed 50x? I know when we reach a multifold gap it really doesn't make much difference, but a 10x increase seems to flow better with me for some reason, as well as Son Goku not being at a fraction of his SSJ power when he was read as 3000 kiri.\n\nHow do you explain the massive boost in power Gotenks Base receives, yet the boys don't receive.\n\nIt's pretty hard to give a explanation that lets no room for doubt, but I think the training was more centred on Gotenks than in the kids themselves, therefore mastering the fusion and increasing the multiplier behind it. Yes it's still lets some questions, like \"then how Gogeta wields the same boost as post RoSaT Gotenks if Goku and Vegeta didn't master the fusion\", so, like I said, nothing of an \"end be all\" explanation. But still doesn't change the fact that Piccolo was still cetic about they defeating Boo when tue kids showed themselves in base, but quickly changed of opinion upon they turning Gotenks, meaning the Gotenks' boost was far more considerable than the kids'.\n\n2x Super Saiyan boost for Fusion powers seems very likely.\n\nIndeed. Gotenks being 10x ~ 50x above Goku sounds way better to me than the gap reaching 1000x, and at the same time, the lower multiplier still allows you to have base post >>> ssj pre. Then it's better to lessenen the multiplier than ignoring aspects of the narrative imo."
