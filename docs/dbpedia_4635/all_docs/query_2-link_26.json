        "text": "could it be? i was reading a theory that says that Beerus created Buu in order to keep the balance.\n\nit makes kind of sense, because in one of akira toriayama's interview he says that babidi nor bibidi created buu, they just learnt how to awake him,\n\nit doesn't make sense at all, because inmediatly after that we got the battle of god movie, why would he say that then?\n\nprobably beerus didn't recognize Buu because he saw the fat-one that looks completely different from his original form.\n\nEDIT: but then again, we know that the kaioshin from 15 generations ago was sealed by an evil fellow' that evil fellow was BEERUS'.\n\nand kaioshin says that it was not as strong as BUU.\n\nCurrent Beerus > Beerus 15M years ago > Super Buu > Beerus 75M years ago\n\nIs what we know, take these statements at face value.\n\nBeerus was GoDing about for quite away before that 75M time, so Prime Buu would have had to be quite a bit earlier than that. (Then again, Beerus still acts like he's the strongest in the universe, even travelling with Whis... and Frieza was all high and mighty even knowing about Buu and Beerus... and Vegeta acted like he was undefeatable even knowing about Frieza, Cui, Zarbon, Dodoria, Ginyu Force, King Cold)\n\nI use Herms translations (resident translator from Kanzenshuu), which I trust far more than VIZ or any other translations and his translation has the statement being ambiguous at best. In his translation he never says \"Although not as STRONG as Buu\"\n\nTranslation:\n\nChapter: 479 (DBZ 285), P6.5, P7.2, P8.2-3\n\nElder Kaioshin: “That’s ri~~~ight. Lo~~~ong, lo~~~ong ago, there was this ridiculously strong and ba~~~ad dude. Well, he wasn’t as bad as this Majin Boo guy now, but still~~~. He did it, he se~~~ealed me away inside that sword. Me here. He was freaked out by how fearsome I am. Yep, sure wa~~~as.”\n\nGoku: “…He don’t look like that amazin’ an old-timer…I’ll test him out a bit.”\n\n*Goku blasts Elder Kaioshin, who gets really hurt*\n\nGoku: “…Like I thought, he’s just an old blowhard…”\n\nElder Kaioshin: “It-it wasn’t my power that my enemy was freaked out by…! It was my ferocious ‘ability’!”\n\nHerms about said translation:\n\nHerms wrote:\n\n悪い/warui is \"bad/evil\", pretty straightforwardly. However, the 今の魔人ブウほどじゃないがな/\"not as much as this Majin Boo guy now though\" bit could be referring both to the unnamed bad guy's evilness and strength. The wording I used in the Strength Checker makes it sound like he's talking exclusively about Boo being eviler than the evil guy who sealed him away, but it's not really clear cut like that in Japanese. I should probably get around to fixing it.\n\nThe Elder Kai could be referring to strength, mentality (evil/good), or both when making the statement. It's unknown, but as Herms said, it points more to him referring to Beerus not being as evil as Buu than him not being as strong as him.\n\nI use Herms translations (resident translator from Kanzenshuu), which I trust far more than VIZ or any other translations and his translation has the statement being ambiguous at best. In his translation he never says \"Although not as STRONG as Buu\"\n\nTranslation:\n\nHerms about said translation:\n\nThe Elder Kai could be referring to strength, mentality (evil/good), or both when making the statement. It's unknown, but as Herms said, it points more to him referring to Beerus not being as evil as Buu than him not being as strong as him.\n\nTo support that, the French translation I have(which is pretty damn freakign accurate after comparing it to several translations from Herms) makes it pretty clear he meant Buu was more evil and not more powerful than Beerus. He flat out says ''not as bad as Majin Buu''.\n\nSorry to English speakers but Viz is complete garbage as a translator. Too many inaccuracies that led to countless misconceptions.\n\nFrom what Herms said\n\nI do hear that the French manga translation is really top-notch, especially for the kanzenban.\n\nbeerus was not invented til now tho.\n\nhe didn't exist back then, there is no point in discussing it that much\n\njust pointing out that perhaps in the future buu can be stronger or that Beerus was weaker back then.\n\nStill doesn't mean you can't tie him up to previous events. For example, Goku was obviously based off Sun Wukong from Journey to the West, don't think he was originally planned as a Saiyan at all.\n\nIt's still a simple theory but it makes a lot of sense. Don't see anything pointing that Beerus created Majin Buu though...\n\nEdit: Never mind, keeping the balance in check.\n\nThen why are you attempting to use a statement from back when Beerus didn't exist as a way to validate your theory?\n\njust wanted to discuss a little, it's okay i'm not trying to prove you wrong,\n\nSpoiler:\n\ni just wanted to know if you guys actually believed this was all planned since the beggining,u know i doubt toriyama had beerus in mind when he said that he was not as 'evil' or 'strong' as buu."
