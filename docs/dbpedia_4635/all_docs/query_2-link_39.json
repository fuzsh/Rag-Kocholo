        "text": "Introduction\n\nHello all, my proposal for this thread is for the universal arguments to be taken into account from the buu saga. First off, we have goku's universal kid buu statement. .\n\nSaying kid buu will make the universe go \"poof\" all the way from the kaioshin realm which is currently accepted as another spacetime. If we take this statement into account, this would upgrade buu to \"Low multiverse level\" Or \"Universe level\". Vegeta also says the universe is at stake: . Also the manga page says \"battle for the universe\". . So just some supporting evidence.\n\nCounter arguments:\n\n\"Buu could've just destroyed the kaioshin realm and then destroy the rest of the macrocosm\". You would have to prove that to be the case, goku saying it would go \"poof\" seems to imply one big explosion if they lost, with everything being instantly gone.\n\n\"The destruction could have been overtime\"\n\nEven if this was the case, overtime doesn't really matter for tier 2, it would still be a low multiverse level feat for destroying all the realms and their respective spacetimes.\n\nWe know that super buu is capable of affecting spacetime, albeit on smaller scale, he was still able to destroy spacetime, even goku's energy from going super saiyan 3 was able to hit the kaioshin realm which is another dimension, without any of the characters there even having to sense his energy, it just hit them, despite being in another spacetime entirely. , , https://imgur.com/ZiEBR7f. Now this is just some evidence that up to this point, characters can affect spacetime, not saying this is definitive evidence for tier 2 buu, but just something to consider.\n\nOptions: If you happen to disagree with tier 2 buu, i feel like \"3-A\" should be a possibility, even 3-B or 4-A would suffice, seeing as how he would be a universal threat stated multiple time within the manga. But to me 3-A makes the most sense.\n\nAgree: CraigTucker, SSJGeminiJJ, OmegaBronic, Speedster352, Hiryu-Z, Guacomolefletcher\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNeutral:\n\nDisagree: Damage3245, NullFlowerBush, SamanPatou, KingTempest\n\nI agree with an at least 3-B possibly 3-A Buu for the poof statement. Even if it was considered overtime, there's an indicated maximum timeframe of the lifespan of the living beings in the universe, and the poof makes it extremely quick at worst (even though there's some evidence that points to it being one attack). Could really just a stick a calc similar to Z Broly destroying the universe on it (which is way into 3-B) and call it a day and whether he's 3-A can be it's own discusion.\n\n2-C is a complete reach because Kid Buu could easily just teleport back to the universe and blow it up. Just delete all the Tier 2 stuff it's as flimsy as it could be and won't go anywhere.\n\nVegeta also says the universe is at stake: . Also the manga page says \"battle for the universe\". . So just some supporting evidence.\n\nHow do we know that it is \"universe\" as in the entire macrocosm instead of being just the living universe? Since that is what most characters call it when they say \"universe\" in Z\n\nCounter arguments:\n\n\"Buu could've just destroyed the kaioshin realm and then destroy the rest of the macrocosm\". You would have to prove that to be the case, goku saying it would go \"poof\" seems to imply one big explosion if they lost, with everything being instantly gone.\n\nHe said \"poof\" which implies that buu would have made the universe disapear instantly, which would be true regardless if he destroyed the kaio realm first and then went to destroy the universe immediatly after\n\n\"The destruction could have been overtime\"\n\nEven if this was the case, overtime doesn't really matter for tier 2, it would still be a low multiverse level feat for destroying all the realms and their respective spacetimes.\n\nagain, how do we know that he would have destroyed all the realms instead of just the universe/living world?\n\nWe know that super buu is capable of affecting spacetime, albeit on smaller scale, he was still able to destroy spacetime\n\nwe accept that super buu>>>>>kid buu on this site, so not really a good comparison\n\n, even goku's energy from going super saiyan 3 was able to hit the kaioshin realm which is another dimension, without any of the characters there even having to sense his energy, it just hit them, despite being in another spacetime entirely. , , . Now this is just some evidence that up to this point, characters can affect spacetime, not saying this is definitive evidence for tier 2 buu, but just something to consider.\n\nthis is a range feat for ki dimensional travel, nothing here implies space time being affected\n\nOptions: If you happen to disagree with tier 2 buu, i feel like \"3-A, possibly 2-C\" should be a possibility, even 3-B or 4-A would suffice, seeing as how he would be a universal threat stated multiple time within the manga. But to me 3-A or 2-C makes the most sense.\n\nAgree: CraigTucker\n\n​\n\nNeutral:\n\nDisagree:\n\nAgree on 3-A, possibly higher for kid buu\n\nIt relies on unofficial translations, generous interpretations and results in a very significant outlier for the series at the time.\n\nWhy is it an outlier if it's being made an important point by the narrative? It'd only be an actual outlier if they were weighed down by a different feat which is asserted of a limit for ap, not DC.\n\nYou can't really prove a previous DC feat is where their AP caps at in any reliable manner.\n\nThat's hardly solid proof when it can easily just be a figure of speech.\n\nThat still implies the destruction is gonna happen fast and all at once, not a slow over-time \"destroying one solar system at a time,\" of which keep in mind, we accept Kid Buu's speed at 50k times the speed of light, so he couldn't really feasably achieve this in any short time frame.\n\nI don't agree with that. The more extraordinary the claim requires more evidence.\n\nCan you prove that a higher AP is inherently more extraordinary?\n\nJust like how when he spontaneously decided to destroy the Earth, he just shot a Ki blast at it. So if Kid Buu wished to destroy the Universe (as your interpretation of Goku's statement would suggest), why didn't Kid Buu just do that as he did to the Earth?\n\nWe don't really know kid buu's motivations or anything related to that at all\n\nIt means Kid Buu will be free to rampage and destroy the Universe at his leisure.\n\nWe can contextualize this with DBS, where beerus was about to show up and within their knowledge (of the kais)\n\nIt means Kid Buu will be free to rampage and destroy the Universe at his leisure.\n\nNot that Kid Buu would spontaneously decide to destroy the entire Universe in a single attack.\n\nIf that was Kid Buu's aim, he could have easily done that at any time.\n\nJust like how when he spontaneously decided to destroy the Earth, he just shot a Ki blast at it. So if Kid Buu wished to destroy the Universe (as your interpretation of Goku's statement would suggest), why didn't Kid Buu just do that as he did to the Earth?\n\nWhat? That is not what is being implied at all, its implying some instant explosion that makes the universe disappear instantly AFTER he was done fighting goku and vegeta. He wanted to fight goku and vegeta. He sensed goku and vegeta's energy so he went to fight them."
