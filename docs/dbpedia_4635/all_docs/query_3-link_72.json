        "text": "In Dragon Ball Super, as well as Battle of the Gods, Beerus did not know about Majin Buu. The manga has not given a definitive answer as to why they don't know each other, but we can narrow down the potential answers.\n\nIn an interview, Akira Toriyama has stated that contrary to Supreme Kai's statement about Bibidi creating Buu, Buu has actually been around since the beginning of time. Bibidi just knew how to wake up Buu from his long slumber.\n\nWe also know that gods aren't born as gods in Dragon Ball. They obtain the god title after training and fulfilling their duties. Thus we know that Buu existed before Beerus became a god.\n\nThis means that Beerus not knowing Buu can be attributed to any of the possibilities below -\n\nBeerus and Buu never met each other - possible due to the excessive amount of time they spend asleep.\n\nBeerus might have met Buu, but in kid Buu form. He has never seen Mr. Buu before.\n\nThere was no reason to meet. Beerus destroys planets to maintain the balance of the universe. With Buu also destroying planets, he essentially did Beerus' job for him.\n\nWe also know that Beerus sealed Old Supreme Kai into that sword. During that time, Buu was also asleep, so there was no chance for Beerus to meet Buu during that time.\n\nWe should also note that Old Kai described Buu as more evil than Beerus while Beerus was more powerful than Buu. It's possible that Beerus didn't need to seek Buu for a challenge if he was already stronger than him.\n\nMaybe beerus did know buu just didn't care about him only wanted pudding plus there's no real way to destroy buu so they could have met before and that's the reason buu didn't want to share his pudding cups, buu isn't really that self-centered, beerus could have beaten buu to a pulp once upon a time and that's how bibidi discovers him or beerus could have delegated his destroying responsibilities to him but I c this unlikely because kid buu seems unruly, proof that they met I believe is in the fact beerus knew to block his candy beam probably because he seen it before or it was used on him and also beerus is forgetful, all the ancient people n the universe knew buu and feared him and beerus from king cold to the kias\n\nIt is possible that they have met before. And you who are saying Buu is indestructible, he kind of is. If they battled for millions of years, eventually Buu would win. Remember when Beerus fought Goku, used one super move, and then after that he had run out of energy. If Buu, and I am talking kid Buu, has instant transmission, he could teleport away and have Beerus without any energy left. Goku only did not teleport away because then it would have hit the Earth. Kid Buu could not have cared less about if the Earth or any planet was destroyed. He destroys planets."
