Something is coming, someone from his past, and it's time to prepare.\n\nCitune is a cyberpunk-inspired world. Alexios is the leader of Destiny's Maelström, a rebel gang and crime circuit. They own various warehouses in the conflict zones or around the Nightlife District in the Midnight City. Before forming his gang, centuries prior, he had been a nomad on his own with nothing more than a motorbike, his belongings, and a dark past. Now, his gang operates on the black market selling various antiquities, oddities, equipment for docs, and weaponry, all while raking in more money than they have the right to.\n\n(Here you will find a glossary for any and all science fiction fantasy terms used in this story. Everything here is either original or terms used within science fiction or cyberpunk universes, so this glossary will also be included in the novel when/if it ever gets published.)\n\n♡ REWRITTEN & NEW ♡\n\nClone Force 99, along with hundreds of their fellow clones, have happily settled into society on Medina Station with the help of the Rocinante crew.\n\nA request for help recovering clone prisoners from Mount Tantiss has been received, as well as a threat from the Empire.

The night was filled with fun and laughter as he expected it would be, but one surprise he didn’t count on was admiral April showing up in his ready room, with an upset and scared 16-year-old girl. More so he didn’t expect that the 16-year-old would be his daughter. (Flashback 16 years ago when Captain Pike turns 31 during a drunken night on Risa newly promoted and maybe overly adventurous, Pike meets a woman named Evangeline and they fall in love for a short time and she ends up pregnant. Evangeline is dead now and so Saela is now in the care of Pike and the Enterprise. Chris doesn’t know how to be a dad let alone to a teenager but he has Una and the rest of the crew to help him out.\n\nVegeta, as the First Prince and soon-to-be King of Planet Vegeta, is bound to supervise the Toshi Ni Ichidou No Kouhai Gishiki - the ritual annual Saiyan mating ceremony - like every year. He's the Alpha Prince and legally obliged to make Saiyans abide by the rules. He doesn't like it - he has more important things to do.\n\nKakarot is back in VegetaSei after ten years in space. He didn't want to return, but the mating ceremony is here. He's a Saiyan Beta Male and is legally obliged to participate. He doesn't like it - he doesn't want a mate.\n\nWhat would happen when the two meet again after being separated for years?\n\nWhy suddenly does Kakarot look so enticing to Vegeta?\n\nWhy suddenly does Vegeta heat Kakarot's body and mind so much?\n\nSonic is so caught up in his thoughts he doesn’t react to the hand grabbing his muzzle— gently too— with said alien hedgehog inspecting him with childish curiosity. It’s not a gentility he was expecting in such sharp talons, not to mention from someone who basically amounts to an enemy.\n\n******\n\nBasically Shadow got yoinked by Black Arms a bit earlier than expected.\n\nREAD THE TAGS (They get updated if I forgot to add something), most characters here are aged up for a reason. My first fic, yay?\n\nAn alien threat suddenly appears over the skies of Metropolis and the Man of Steel is the only one who can face this threat head on! After all, the Kryptonian's big, beefy, muscle body seemed to hold all the might needed to get the job done. But what if this mysterious entity coveted that same might? What if Superman's own thick and juicy body is the key to his downfall? Would he be able to rise above, or will the Muscle Milf of Steel prove himself to be too ripe for his own good and fall right into the most perverted clutches of this lecherous invader?\n\nravon and his family are infected with an alien virus that forces them to crave and eat flesh. He hates commiting the crime, but he does what he can to survive, and one day, he desperately finds his next victim, just to meet a woman who will change his life.\n\nAmbrosia is a scientist/paranormal researcher who injected herself with a serum she created that makes her regenerate from any injury without a mark.
