        "text": "The video above shows how to farm Majin Buu food quickly.\n\nThere are blue orbs all over Conton City. They often contain food items. You can find them on water, but also also in the hills and countryside near the town. See the video for a farming route. Once you picked up all blue orbs you can play a match and they will respawn. The instructors have some very easy and short matches. I was going around the countryside oustide Conton City, picked up all blue orbs, then played a match against Vegeta and everything respawned. Rinse and repeat. It took me 2 runs (5 minutes) with this method to completely fill up Majin Buu’s stomach.\n\nFeeding Majin Buu at his house will make him bear children. You get access to this area after making a bit of progress in the story. When he has 6 children he’ll give you a Distorted Time Egg, needed for the alternate game ending and to complete the story 100%.\n\nIt is also required for the following trophies / achievements:\n\n– The Most Powerful Majin is Born!\n\n– I Feel a Little…Different!\n\n– Defiance in the Face of Despair!!\n\nFeeding his children can yield some good rewards (such as new clothing and super souls). Feed a child multiple times and it will change its color (which unlocks a trophy).\n\nShould Buu stop having children you must level up some more. I was level 75 when he had all six children."
