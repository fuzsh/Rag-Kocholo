        "text": "Like the past Budokais, you were able to play through the Dragon Ball world and re-experience the events that took place, even lending a hand in making it all happen. Well, it's back and even better than ever. Playing as one of the 11 characters, you can view the story through their eyes and fight the battles they fought in the series, all while building their levels, collecting Zenie, Dragon Balls and Capsules.\n\nFor each playthrough, the contents of Capsules and Zenie vary. The best way to cover a map is to start at the bottom SW map, fly north and once you \"zone\" back to the bottom, move over to the east a bit and fly north again. Repeat and you'll cover the whole map and easily find each Capsule, Dragon Ball and all the Zenie. (Also, do this at least once every saga to find all the items.)\n\nWhen you beat a character's story and if you have collected all seven Dragon Balls, you'll be able to get a wish from Shenron, either it being that character's Breakthrough Capsule, his Memories (less valuable than the Breakthrough Capsule)or a nice Capsule item. Also, once you beat each of the 11 character's story, you'll unlock Dragon Arena.\n\nFinally, make a note as you play through, during battles, you may be able to recreate a scene from the show. For example, Tien using the Neo Ki Cannon on Imperfect Cell. That happened in the actual show, if you recall, so doing it here will unlock a bonus for you. Nothing upscale or on the wow effect, but hey, it's something. Just try using any attacks available at least once to see if that battle had a bonus to unlock. With that said, on to the Dragon Universe story!\n\nDragon Balls in this Area - 7Note: During the second playthrough, you can unlock Supreme Kai. Here's how: defeat Goten, then head to where you found Videl. Afterwards, go to the Plains near Goku's House, then the Plains north of West City and fight Vegeta. Afterwards, go to the NE mountains and talk to Vegeta, then head to the mountains near Goku's House to find Videl again. Next up, fight Dabura and then head to the next marker to fight Majin Vegeta. Finally, head to the Plains west of Central City to find Supreme Kai and unlock him. Now, you fight Kid Buu and after, head to the NW part of the world and look for a island with trees to find a area where you get the Potara Earring, which then tosses you into a fight with Broly.\n\nNote: To unlock Android #16, during the second playthrough, playthrough and defeat Frieza the first time, then on the map, head to the marker to the east to find Ginyu as a frog. After this, continue and fight Frieza again and the game will continue into the Android/Cell Saga. Now, head to the Plains near the World Tournament Arena to find Android #16. Take him to West City so Bulma can help him and you'll unlock Android #16 and afterwards, you'll have to fight Perfect Cell."
