        "text": "Depends on how strong Super Buu is compared to full power super saiyans.\n\nWe know for a fact Base Goku is > Final Form Frieza, which is at least a 200x increase in powerlevel from his initial form, said form can fodderize SSJ Gohan, who should be at the very least on par with Buu era Super Saiyans.\n\nDunno. It was stated in BoG that Base Goku still couldn't match up with Frieza's then-final form; then again, I might've read the DB wiki wrong. If I recall correctly, the pattern I interpreted was this.:\n\n1% (or 10% depending on what you've read or watched) Frieza easily owned Vegeta after Vegeta's last zenkai boost in the Namek Saga.\n\nGoku took 1%/10% Frieza with mid-difficulty\n\n50% Frieza owned 10x Kaioken Goku\n\n50% Frieza took 20x Kaioken Goku with mid-to-major difficulty\n\nSSJ Goku owned 50% Frieza\n\nSSj Goku and 100% Frieza (initial) fought rather evenly\n\nSSJ Goku beat 100% Frieza (worn out) with minor-to-mid difficulty\n\nSSJ Future Trunks owned Mecha-Frieza (who's more or less around Frieza at 50%)\n\nSSJ Future Trunks owned King Cold\n\nSSJ Goku casually defended himself against SSJ Trunks\n\n---New Saga---\n\nSSJ Vegeta owned Android 19 or beat him with minor difficulty\n\nAndroid 18 owned SSJ Vegeta\n\nAndroid 18 owned SSJ Trunks\n\nAndroid 17 is more or less equal to Android 18\n\n---Pattern Break---\n\nImperfect Cell easily defeated Kami/Piccolo\n\nKami/Piccolo fought evenly with Android 17\n\nImperfect Cell easily defeated Android 17\n\nAndroid 16 would've beaten Imperfect Cell with mid-to-major difficulty\n\nTenshinhan held back Semi-Perfect Cell with an ultimate move\n\nAscended SSJ Vegeta would've easily defeated Semi-Perfect Cell\n\nAscended SSJ Trunks would've easily defeated Semi-Perfect Cell\n\nAscended SSJ Vegeta fought relatively evenly with Ascended SSJ Trunks\n\nAscended SSJ Vegeta would've one-shotted Perfect Cell with an ultimate move\n\nPerfect Cell easily defeated Ascended SSJ Vegeta\n\nHuh. Whaddya know. That's how far I went. Yeah, you can fill in the blanks from there.\n\nVegito fodderized Buuhan, and Goku stated that even he wouldn't be enough to stop Beerus. Mind that this is a) a much stronger Vegito since Goku and Vegeta kept training after the Buu saga and b) a Beerus who was just clowning around, meaning Goku couldn't have begun to realize how strong he was.\n\nSo:\n\nBeerus > BoG Vegito >>> Casual Buu Saga Vegito >>> Buuhan\n\nGod Goku ended up giving Beerus a good fight, meaning he is likely much stronger than a hypothetical BoG Vegito.\n\nGoku absorbed the god ki and so became roughly as strong in his base as he was in red god form.\n\nAdded to that are the 3 years in the ROSAT with Vegeta\n\nAfter that time, base Goku should be above Buu Saga Vegito by a huge margin\n\nSo, universe 6:\n\nBase Goku was above Botamo, but the latter could still put up a fight\n\nGoku and an equal Vegeta had to go SSJ to beat Frost's final form\n\nMagetta Ceena'd all of SSJ Vegeta's attacks and was strong enough to hurt him\n\nVegeta and Cabba fought evenly while in base form.\n\nSo yeah, pretty much all of them should completely stomp Buuhan.\n\nKinda makes you wonder why Beerus wanted to bring Majin Buu into the tournament, don't it?\n\nThough this part is rather confusing, while the recent Frieza movie showed Golden Frieza initially owning SSJB (Super Saiya-jin Blue) Goku, Akira Toriyama still claimed Frieza was below Beerus. I dunno if it's Toriyama's memory or if he's trying to push his opinion that Beerus is the strongest there is. You know, a Beerus wanker.\n\nIf I watched the clip correctly, SSJ2 Vegeta somehow managed to land a punch or two against Beerus and push Beerus into going into 10% of his power. Of course this was Vegeta in a fit of rage, so it wouldn't really factor into Vegeta's real strength.\n\nI just brought in more questions, did I?\n\nWhy does everyone think base Goku is as strong as he was at the end of the Beerus fight? That's quite clearly not the case, as he goes SS on top of that (x50 boost still judging by the Cabba battle), then goes SSB, then goes KK x10, and still isn't above Beerus. If his base could put up a decent fight against whatever percentage Beerus was at- heavily implied to be at least 10%- then going SS would make him far exceed Beerus. Without even bothering with SSB. Also, why do people think Tagoma is special? SS Gohan smacked him around with ease, and he's all but directly stated to be weaker than SS Gohan from the Buu arc (he can barley use SS, for Kami's sake, and comments on how much he's slacked off; it doesn't sound like he just lost a form, he's probably weaker in base as well).\n\nThe U6 arc makes everything fairly clear, imo. As already noted, Goku specifically said that Mr. Buu was \"crazy strong\", while acting dismissive of Piccolo. Buu is also Goku and Vegeta's first choice for the tournament, while Piccolo is an afterthought. We later see post-training Piccolo somewhat hold his own against final form Frost, when even his 3rd \"Assault Form\" was stronger than base Goku. So, Mr. Buu should be able to pound the crap out of Botamo, Cabba, 1st/3rd form Frost (he starts in his 1st by default), and probably even final form Frost. And Super Buu, even at his base, is much stronger than Mr. Buu.\n\nI know some will try to say that Piccolo is just god-tier now thanks to 1 year of sparring with Gohan, but no one comments on Piccolo enormously spiking in power, and it defies both in-universe and narrative logic that he'd get such a power-up from such a small amount of training with no one saying anything about it. It just really has no evidence going for it in the story. Moreover, we can see he's still weaker than Gohan, or at best on par with him (if you assume that what we saw Piccolo spar with was some weakened version of his \"Ultimate\" form). Not only is Gohan treated as being weaker than Mr. Buu as well (and Goku and Vegeta have no real reason to underestimate him), he's at the very least confirmed as being weaker than he hwas in the Buu arc. Gohan states, literally, that \"I'm having Piccolo retrain me from scratch by now\". \"Starting from scratch\" means \"going back to the basics\". If he is saying \"Piccolo is helping me going back to the basics\" it mean he's not quite done with that. This doesn't make a lick of sense if he's not in the \"scratch phase\", alas, he's stronger than ever so he's done the scratch and way more.\n\nBoth of these comments are pretty explicit and expository.\n\nGohan [prime] > Mr. Buu > Gohan (\"retraining from scratch\") > Piccolo [post-training]\n\nAlso, canonically, this whole thing takes place before the Uub epilogue, right? That'd mean that, after whatever training he does for the rest of Super, Goku should still be weaker in his base than Uub. Goku states in that epilogue that Uub was amazing as he'd thought he'd be- so, at most, as strong as Pure Buu.\n\nWith that in mind, Super Buu should cream everyone on this list, since he's dimensions above Mr. Buu who's still stronger than Piccolo and Gohan. Botamo, Cabba, and 1st/3rd form Frost are on par with or weaker than base Goku, and final form Frost is stronger, but still probably not by that much if Piccolo has a chance against him. Magetta might be the sole exception- he still gave Vegeta a hard time when he went Super Saiyan, meaning he's much much stronger than the rest of his team and possibly stronger than Buu. Even then, though, his size and lack of mobility will make him the perfect target for one of Buu's Candy Beams, while none of his techniques are sufficient to completely wipe out Buu.\n\nWhy does everyone think base Goku is as strong as he was at the end of the Beerus fight? That's quite clearly not the case, as he goes SS on top of that (x50 boost still judging by the Cabba battle),\n\nnope.\n\nthe 50x multiplier only exists as a fan interpretation that isn't contradicted.\n\nSSJ gave a boost = to kaio-ken x50 the first time that it was used, but in general, it's not only not treated exactly like that in later sagas, but it's pretty well implied that SSJ's power boost is variable on how much you use and abuse it. FPSSJ is stronger than regular SSJ back in cell saga despite it not being an actual transformation but more or less training to use SSJ better, and it was equivalent to ASSJ which by Databooks was a 1.5 boost IIRC.\n\neven when it comes to that boost, it was implied to only apply to PL, which is a nebulous concept.\n\nAll we got from the Cabba battle was that SSJ makes you stronger, not that it creates a 50x boost. Vegeta was able to punk Dodoria, Zarbon, and Qi far harder with an advantage that was 33% difference in Qui's case and even less in Zarb and Dodoria's.\n\nGod knows if the multipliers still mattered, Goku wouldn't be holding off on using SSJ2 or 3.\n\nThe U6 arc makes everything fairly clear, imo. As already noted, Goku specifically said that Mr. Buu was \"crazy strong\", while acting dismissive of Piccolo.\n\nHe was also somewhat surprised to find Gohan and piccolo training, IIRC.\n\nIn the BoG/RoF arc Piccolo WAS inferior to Buu, but it's obvious he stepped things up.\n\nit's not exactly the most consistent thing regardless, as Tori seems to forget where he wants to put Piccolo (18 comments her power level is higher than all the Z warriors, when we know for a Fact Piccolo hasn't been inferior since he fused with Kami... Certainly not since he further cemented the gap with training in RoSaT back in Cell saga)\n\nI know some will try to say that Piccolo is just god-tier now thanks to 1 year of sparring with Gohan, but no one comments on Piccolo enormously spiking in power, and it defies both in-universe and narrative logic that he'd get such a power-up from such a small amount of training with no one saying anything about it.\n\nIt doesn't defy in-universe or narrative logic.\n\nDragon Ball has done this time and time again where the moment one arc finishes people train just enough to only be a little irrelevant the next arc.\n\nPiccolo got to near SSJ levels just by training in the early bits of the android saga,\n\nMoreover, we can see he's still weaker than Gohan, or at best on par with him (if you assume that what we saw Piccolo spar with was some weakened version of his \"Ultimate\" form)\n\nIt's one random part of a sparring session.\n\nnot really something to judge from, especially if it's for the purpose of training him.\n\nWhy would he seek training from piccolo if he was stronger than him?\n\nGohan [prime] > Mr. Buu > Gohan (\"retraining from scratch\") > Piccolo [post-training]\n\nAlso, canonically, this whole thing takes place before the Uub epilogue, right?

Goku states in that epilogue that Uub was amazing as he'd thought he'd be- so, at most, as strong as Pure Buu.\n\nThat's already gotten an explanation from Tori.\n\nUub epilogue doesn't happen for years yet and as he explains by the time that Goku gets around to starting to train Uub, he and the rest of the cast had finally had age catch up to him.\n\nMore or less, this means Goku is far weaker at the time.\n\nGM puts it better than I could in regards to Base Goku's power in Super\n\n> What's intended by the story\n\nHave you reviewed ALL of the material to be saying this?\n\nProof 1 (here is what is REALLY intended, but what you conviniently ignore in an effort to invent some intent that is not there):\n\nProof 2:\n\nProof 3:\n\nProof 4:\n\nThey clash, producing the trademark SSJB energy in Base Form, Whis then comments that they came so far in a short amount of time, how far? Much further than you're trying to claim considering the entire point of the training is to become GOD TIER. Why is it important that he mentioned Beerus? Because Beerus' investment is that they become as strong as him as soon as possible. Being anything less than baseline God Tier would not be good progress. Especially since Freeza became well into God Tier in months.\n\nProof 5:\n\n1. It is stated that they have just now reached the level where they can sense the ki of a God. Now, for this to mean anything there must be a level to REACH before this is possible. What kind of a level? Perhaps GOD LEVEL?\n\n2. As you can see here, the aim was to increase the power of Base so the SSJ Multiplier actually meant that they'd be more than scrubs. More proof that Base is some degree of God Tier.\n\n3. Also, I left out the screenshot where the Oracle Fish implies that the training would still be difficult as shit even if they were SSJ's. Again, more proof that Base is some degree of God Tier.\n\nProof 6:\n\nI'm probably missing something. Perhaps I'll fill in the blank space later.\n\nWhere is YOUR proof? What you think does not matter with all due respect. Facts are what matters.\n\nBase/SSJ do not use God Ki. We have seen this twice now. This is why everyone should review ALL of the material.\n\nWhen Goku's SSJG Form ran out and he reverted back to SSJ it was noted that he not only did not lose power but that they (the Z-Fighters) could now sense him. It doesn't use God Ki, but he IS God level. You don't need God Ki to be God level. See Freeza. See Magetta. Absolutely nothing weird with Cabba being that strong. Super's powerscale really does not use logic. Freeza became stronger than a form that surpasses SSJG in MONTHS.\n\n> \"I seriously doubt \"God Ki\" base is being considered by the creators/concept artists as bridging God level transformations\"\n\nAgain, .\n\nYou're trying to approach this with your own sense of logic because you can't believe it. But you are certainly incorrect. I've watched pretty much every episode at least twice, there's far more proof that Base is God Tier than vice versa.\n\nRemembered my sixth point of proof:\n\nGoku remarks on Vegeta's ki being of a different \"quality\". Yes, the level of quality which separates those of the God tier bracket and the rest.\n\nnope.\n\nthe 50x multiplier only exists as a fan interpretation that isn't contradicted.\n\nSSJ gave a boost = to kaio-ken x50 the first time that it was used, but in general, it's not only not treated exactly like that in later sagas, but it's pretty well implied that SSJ's power boost is variable on how much you use and abuse it.\n\nWhat? No it isn't. Its multiplier is given as x50 in official material and never implied to change at any point.\n\nFPSSJ is stronger than regular SSJ back in cell saga despite it not being an actual transformation but more or less training to use SSJ better, and it was equivalent to ASSJ which by Databooks was a 1.5 boost IIRC.\n\nIt wasn't any stronger as a boost. It was specifically only stated to be SS without as much of a stamina drain.\n\n\"ASSJ\" was never given any official boost.\n\neven when it comes to that boost, it was implied to only apply to PL, which is a nebulous concept.\n\nNo it isn't, it's pretty clearly meant to be a simple measurement of your actual power. When Freeza says he'll use 50% of his strength, for example, the databooks give his power level as 50% of his full power level. When Goku says Kaio-ken multiplies \"speed, strength, and power\" by whatever number he shouts, the guys with scouters read it as literally multiplying his power level by that number. Et cetera.\n\nAll we got from the Cabba battle was that SSJ makes you stronger, not that it creates a 50x boost. Vegeta was able to punk Dodoria, Zarbon, and Qi far harder with an advantage that was 33% difference in Qui's case and even less in Zarb and Dodoria's.\n\nWhat we got from the Cabba fight is that the SS mutliplier is the same it has always been.\n\nGod knows if the multipliers still mattered, Goku wouldn't be holding off on using SSJ2 or 3.\n\nOr, Super Saiyan Blue is just stronger.\n\nHe was also somewhat surprised to find Gohan and piccolo training, IIRC.\n\nNah, he wasn't. And even if he was, it wouldn't have any baring on whether or not he thinks Piccolo is a worse option than Buu after seeing it.\n\nIn the BoG/RoF arc Piccolo WAS inferior to Buu, but it's obvious he stepped things up.\n\nGoku and Vegeta don't agree.\n\nit's not exactly the most consistent thing regardless, as Tori seems to forget where he wants to put Piccolo (18 comments her power level is higher than all the Z warriors, when we know for a Fact Piccolo hasn't been inferior since he fused with Kami... Certainly not since he further cemented the gap with training in RoSaT back in Cell saga)\n\nWhat? She never says that. She just says she has a higher power level than \"you guys\", without specifying who it is that she's referring to. It's pretty obvious that she's not talking about the whole group, as Gohan was also there.\n\nIt doesn't defy in-universe or narrative logic.\n\nDragon Ball has done this time and time again where the moment one arc finishes people train just enough to only be a little irrelevant the next arc.\n\nWhenever Dragon Ball does this, it's always explicitly spelled out, and there's an explanation for it. No such thing happens here. Speaking of which, there's no point in Dragon Ball where one character is said to be weaker than another but is actually stronger, with the person making the statement never being revealed as wrong. If Goku considers Buu a better option than Piccolo, he's a better option than Piccolo. The idea that Piccolo was secretly hiding SSG-levels of power doesn't really have anything going for it.\n\nPiccolo got to near SSJ levels just by training in the early bits of the android saga,\n\nHe trained 5 years straight after a fusion (\"1 year and 260 days\" from the destruction of Namek to Goku's return, 3 years from then to the arrival of Gero), three with a Super Saiyan, and was still implied to not be as strong as SS Goku was when they started their training. So, he became maybe around a hundred times stronger? That's a completely different situation than \"trains one year, becomes thousands of times stronger\". It'd be like if, by the time Mecha Freeza arrived on Earth, Piccolo had suddenly and secretly become way stronger than him with no explanation given. Then someone else says he's weaker than say, base Vegeta. Then Piccolo doesn't bother to correct him, the person who said that never corrects themselves later, he never fights Freeza anyway, and it's never mentioned again.\n\nIt's one random part of a sparring session.\n\nSo now he's holding back when sparring with Gohan? Where's the evidence for that? Furthermore, why the heck would he be stronger than Gohan now when they've been training together the whole time and Gohan started off strong enough to beat Piccolo with his pinky?\n\nnot really something to judge from, especially if it's for the purpose of training him.\n\nWhy would he seek training from piccolo if he was stronger than him?\n\nThe same reason Goku trains with Kaio. Are you doubting Gohan was stronger than Piccolo when he went to Piccolo for training? We know for a fact that he was.\n\nThat's already gotten an explanation from Tori.\n\nUub epilogue doesn't happen for years yet and as he explains by the time that Goku gets around to starting to train Uub, he and the rest of the cast had finally had age catch up to him.\n\nMore or less, this means Goku is far weaker at the time.\n\nThat was two years ago, and said in the context of why he set up BOG when he did. His exact wording is that he chose the BOG timeline placement because \"everyone is at their maximum strength\".\n\nThat clearly is not the case anymore, with everyone except Gohan becoming stronger in ROF and then Super. Furthermore Goku weakening so drastically by the tournament doesn't really make any sense. Bulma states that Vegeta doesn't appear to have aged by then, and Vegeta responds that he's still in his physical prime because saiyans stay in their prime for a long time before becoming very old very fast. Plus Goku's not even 50 by the end of the series.\n\nGM puts it better than I could in regards to Base Goku's power in Super\n\nEh, none of these are really proof, especially compared to explicit stuff like the Uub epilogue or Piccolo's performance in the tournament, or Super Saiyan Goku not being stronger than Beerus.\n\n1. is just an artistic choice, like the Oozaru appearing behind Goku when he punches Piccolo. That doesn't mean he was 10 times stronger in that moment. This is also the non-canon (or at least in a different continuity) manga.\n\n2. is during the Beerus fight; since we know Goku lost power based on how long he was fighting, it's not really honest to pass this off as evidence that he's that strong in base normally.\n\n3. is clearly BS. If Beerus was actually hitting Vegeta with his \"unrestrained\" attacks, Vegeta would be dead. It wouldn't matter if his base was God-tier. It wouldn't matter if he was in Super Saiyan Blue mode. We see in the latest Super episodes that Beerus in is over ten times as strong as Goku. That is far, far beyond \"killing someone in one hit\" level. He was hitting Vegeta with some arbitrarily restrained level of power. That's all we can really glean from that scene.\n\n4. is just saying that they're stronger now. Nothing more specific. I don't see why they need to be god-tier in base for Beerus to care about them, since SSB mulitplies their power probably hundreds of times over.\n\n5., I don't even know why that's being taken as evidence that they're really strong. You don't need to be really strong to sense the ki of a god. Unless Kaioshin is Beerus-tier now? Or Piccolo, since he could sense Kaioshin's ki?\n\n6. \"Your ki has a completely different quality\" is a generic comment used as a flowery way of saying that someone has become stronger, much like the multiple times someone says \"your ki has a completely different feel\", \"you're a completely different person than before\", or \"your ki is in a completely different dimension\". It has nothing to do with anyone supposedly being \"god-tier\".\n\nMoreover, I should note that Super and the movies explicitly have a different power hierarchy.\n\nThere's this too\n\nBase Goku would have been atomized by SSJB Veggie if he was weak.\n\nIt's pretty silly to attempt to use this as evidence. Even if you ignore the Cabba fight entirely, and the SS multipliers, Super Saiyan Blue is at the very least x20 stronger than base (because Goku thinks SSB is better than just stacking Kaio-ken on his apparently now godly base). So base Goku is at most 1/20 of base Vegeta. We've seen many, many times in Dragon Ball that an attack doesn't even need to be twice as strong as someone to kill them with one hit. He wasn't shooting Goku with anywhere close to his full power.\n\nthe statement of Buu's relevance flies in the face of what actually happens in the show, so I'd discard that, unless Buu is shown to be plot-haxxed somewhere along the line\n\nThe same show where Piccolo puts up a fight against Frost? Where SSG Goku can put up a good fight against ~10% Beerus, and then base Goku can multiply his power by more than 50 and still not be above Beerus? The assumption that their bases are god level seems like the problem here, not Buu or Piccolo being somewhat relevant.\n\nEh, none of these are really proof, especially compared to explicit stuff like the Uub epilogue or Piccolo's performance in the tournament, or Super Saiyan Goku not being stronger than Beerus.\n\n1. is just an artistic choice, like the Oozaru appearing behind Goku when he punches Piccolo. That doesn't mean he was 10 times stronger in that moment. This is also the non-canon (or at least in a different continuity) manga.\n\n2. is during the Beerus fight; since we know Goku lost power based on how long he was fighting, it's not really honest to pass this off as evidence that he's that strong in base normally.\n\n3. is clearly BS. If Beerus was actually hitting Vegeta with his \"unrestrained\" attacks, Vegeta would be dude. It wouldn't matter if his base was God-tier. It wouldn't matter if he was in Super Saiyan Blue mode. We see in the latest Super episodes that Beerus in is over ten times as strong as Goku. That is far, far beyond \"killing someone in one hit\" level.\n\n4. is just saying that they're stronger now. Nothing more specific. I don't see why they need to be god-tier in base for Beerus to care about them, since SSB mulitplies their power probably hundreds of times over.\n\n5., I don't even know why that's being taken as evidence that they're really strong.

The assumption that their bases are god level seems like the problem here, not Buu or Piccolo being somewhat relevant.\n\nAll I see is your opinion: \"I don't believe it because xyz\" blah blah, no scans nor evidence. I'm not interested.\n\nIt's almost a trend among God Tier Base Goku deniers to have ZERO evidence and just their opinion. I wonder why there is never any evidence to show for ANY of your ridiculous claims... hmmm...\n\nAll I see is your opinion: \"I don't believe it because xyz\" blah blah, no scans nor evidence. I'm not interested.\n\nIt's almost a trend among God Tier Base Goku deniers to have ZERO evidence and just their opinion. I wonder why there is never any evidence to show for ANY of your ridiculous claims... hmmm...\n\nI offered evidence. Did you read any of it?\n\n3 and 7 are non-viable because as I pointed out we know that the gaps in power are such that the base saiyans would have died if the god-tiers hit them with full power.\n\n1 wasn't even evidence at all, it was just an artistic choice; I debunked that by bringing up the fact that we have another example of the same thing happening without the implication you suggest.\n\nWith 5, I brought up multiple examples of non-powerful people sensing god ki, proving that being able to sense god ki doesn't actually prove that you're extremely strong. It just proves that you have that specific skill.\n\n4 and 6 also were not evidence, they were just generic \"this person got stronger\" comments. They don't have prove any of your assumptions.\n\nDo you have any evidence? I have the Uub epilogue, Frost's fight with Piccolo, Gohan's comments on re-learning the basics, and Buu being considered relevant in the tournament, at least.\n\nRofl, people still putting up with this? Even though Base Goku was taking blows from Hit left and right and center, the same guy who just finished putting SSB Vegeta into a clinic\n\nHe later matches SSB KK x10 Goku, so we know he was holding back against both Goku and Vegeta. Why are we assuming he was using the same arbitrary percentage on both of them all the time?\n\nThe Cabba fight should have immediately put to bed any notion that SSB is anywhere close to their base forms, if nothing else. If not that, then the fact that the Kaio-Ken still exists, yet back in the ROF arc Goku still thought using SSB was a better option than stacking KK on top of his base. SSB is many many times stronger than their base forms.\n\nThe SSJ multiplier was contradicted the second it supposedly became a thing.\n\nAfter the x20 kamehameha, Goku was completely out of juice and after the consequent beatdown by Freeza, he could barely even stand on his own. Despite this, going super allowed him to hand Freeza his ass.\n\nIf SSJ was a multiplier, then Goku should have gone from \"fuck all\" to \"fuck all x50\". Instead, it brought him from \"almost zero\" to a level above 100% Freeza.\n\nGoing Super Saiyan seems to energize you in addition to multiplying your power. When Goku drops out of Super Saiyan later in the battle, he seems perfectly healthy in base.\n\nThis makes a lot more sense if transforming simply adds a flat amount to your power level, and that flat amount just happened to be a little larger than 100% Freeza's total power.\n\nThis makes little sense. If that was the case, going Super Saiyan wouldn't actually add any noticeable power after a while, since they'd be so strong that Freeza-levels of power aren't even worth mentioning. Yet it quite clearly does.\n\nIt also explains how Future Trunks, who has absolutely no business being on the same level as Namek Goku in his base, could shitstomp Mecha Freeza as a SSJ.\n\nWhy does he \"have absolutely no business being on the same level as Namek Goku in his base\"?\n\nWithout the multiplier, ASSJ, USSJ and FPSSJ all make a lot more sense as well. SSJ2 supposedly is only SSJ x2, meaning the margin for the SSJ subforms would be extremely small. Given how huge the boosts from all 3 of these is portrayed to be, it doesn't fit at all. Meanwhile if SSJ is just \"base + X\", then ASSJ, USSJ and FPSSJ can just be \"base + X + A/B/C\" with a lot more flexibility and less need for plot contrivance.\n\nThe multipliers for the subforms (or at least grade 2) ARE extremely small. Goku doesn't even consider ASSJ's boost to be worth its ambiguous hit to stamina. Trunks implies that Vegeta didn't even ASSJ to hand Cell his ass (chapter 377, he acts surprised that Vegeta's using it, implying he didn't need it). USSJ is portrayed as a big-ish boost, but it doesn't need to be anywhere close to x2 to be considered \"big\". Do remember that this is a series where, if you are half again as strong as your enemy, you can move faster than they can see and beat them down like three hits (see: Goku vs the Ginyus, followed by Ginyu's estimation of Goku's power level; or see Tenshinhan vs Saibaman).\n\nFPSSJ also isn't a subform. It's literally just Super Saiyan without the stamina drain.\n\nif you want explicit\n\nand Beerus never says Goku lost power, he explicitly says even though SSJG's time ran out, his power remained the same\n\nLet's use some common sense here. Taking that scene at face value, base Goku > SSG Goku. SSG Goku was putting up a decent fight against ~10% power. Yet Goku can't just use KK x20 to kick Beerus's ass later after their training. Why? Also, Vegeta goes SS, which officially multiplies his power by 50, and still isn't stronger than Beerus. Both of them also prefer SSB to SS or, in Goku's case, Kaio-ken.\n\nalso, Buu Saga SSJ3 Goku couldn't sense Beerus's ki, yet when he can sense it in base, it's treated as a significant milestone in his progress\n\nI'd say it's a great power-gain\n\nAs noted, Piccolo could sense Kaioshin's godly ki, and Kaioshin could sense Beerus's. It's not a strength thing.\n\nthe problem is taking Buu's hype at face value when all he did in Super was get fuckstomped by Beerus\n\nPiccolo put up a decent fight against a base Goku+ tier fighter, and he's said to be weaker than Buu."
