Buu's profile says that he matched SSJ3 Goku (which the Daizenshuu supports), while Manga Goku's profile says that his SSJ3 form easily beat Innocent Buu.\n\nWhile the Daizenshuu supports Buu equally SSJ3 Goku, Kid Buu stomped Fat Buu but matched SSJ3 so to me that seems to indicate that SSJ3 Goku is far above Innocent Buu, but if anyone disagrees let me know.\n\n2. Ok, I'm astonished at how the wiki has not accepted this yet despite all the evidence, but restrained Jiren should scale above Belmod.\n\nA. Whis's statement in 110 was blatantly saying that Restrained Jiren > Belmod.\n\nB. No one ******* scratched Restrained Jiren, he wasn't even hurt by Vegeta's attacks. He only went serious due to Vegeta and Goku being too tenacious to take down normally.\n\nC. He scared Beerus with his casual aura.\n\nD. To quote @Zamasu_Chan : As we know, it's taboo for Gods of Destruction to fight each other. Or else it'll result in the destruction of more than one universe when they fight. When Arak, Iwen and Liquir fight each other, despite it being taboo, their fight has no effect on the World of Void. However, Jiren, while suppressed, and UIO1 Goku, shook the World of Void.\n\nThe only, and I mean only people who should scale to him are all of his states, the angels, and MUI Goku.\n\nNone of those people did any damage to Jiren.\n\nAnd…? UIS Goku matched restrained Jiren during their fight in 110, who was using more power than when he shook the World of Void, and every other Low 2-C character scales off of UIS Goku in some way.\n\nHe didn't even think Kefla was worth his time.\n\nAnd he thought Kale and Maji Kayo were, that’s not a good argument.\n\nAnd…? UIS Goku matched restrained Jiren during their fight in 110, who was using more power than when he shook the World of Void, and every other Low 2-C character scales off of UIS Goku in some way.\n\nHow do they all scale off UIO Goku again?\n\nAnd he thought Kale and Maji Kayo were, that’s not a good argument.\n\nMaji Kayo was threatening to maim his teammate.\n\nThis is fine.\n\nIs there anything we can compare this to? Like any attack that Jiren said was weak?\n\nAnd what does this mean scaling-wise?\n\nMy point still stands. Whether or not they were “worth Jiren’s time” is irrelevant, unless you want to argue that Kale is stronger than Kefla.\n\nHe one-shot Kale, who mind you scales =< SSJG Goku in a later and stronger form, and only intervened against Kayo to save Dyspo.\n\n1. Buu's profile says that he matched SSJ3 Goku (which the Daizenshuu supports), while Manga Goku's profile says that his SSJ3 form easily beat Innocent Buu.\n\nWhile the Daizenshuu supports Buu equally SSJ3 Goku, Kid Buu stomped Fat Buu but matched SSJ3 so to me that seems to indicate that SSJ3 Goku is far above Innocent Buu, but if anyone disagrees let me know.\n\nGoku said SSJ3 could've defeated Fat Buu. Which is a different form from Innocent Buu, although they look the same. Fat Buu still has Evil Buu inside him, so he is almost as strong as Super Buu. Innocent Buu lost a chunk of its power when he expelled Evil Buu.\n\nThese examples are not quite comparable. Kid Buu beating Innocent Buu tells us nothing about SSJ3 vs Fat Buu.\n\nSince we're still arguing about the meditating Jiren part, what about the other points:\n\n1. Buu's profile says that he matched SSJ3 Goku (which the Daizenshuu supports), while Manga Goku's profile says that his SSJ3 form easily beat Innocent Buu.\n\nWhile the Daizenshuu supports Buu equally SSJ3 Goku, Kid Buu stomped Fat Buu but matched SSJ3 so to me that seems to indicate that SSJ3 Goku is far above Innocent Buu, but if anyone disagrees let me know.\n\n2.\n\nA.

Kid Buu beating Innocent Buu tells us nothing about SSJ3 vs Fat Buu.\n\nOh, yeah, that.\n\nAlthough, Innocent Buu—which is the complete Buu—is evidently weaker than Super Buu, lacking the body necessary to draw out the full extent of his absorbed power.\n\nThat being said, though, the fact that Evil Buu could even defeat Good Buu proves that fissioning made Buu weaker, which is why Kid Buu could ragdoll him.\n\nAlso, Goku only said he could have beaten Innocent Buu, with no mention of how difficult such a feat would have been. In fact, to Piccolo, he expressed uncertainty of the matter.\n\nOh, yeah, that.\n\nAlthough, Innocent Buu—which is the complete Buu—is evidently weaker than Super Buu, lacking the body necessary to draw out the full extent of his absorbed power.\n\nThat being said, though, the fact that Evil Buu could even defeat Good Buu proves that fissioning made Buu weaker, which is why Kid Buu could ragdoll him.\n\nAlso, Goku only said he could have beaten Innocent Buu, with no mention of how difficult such a feat would have been.

However, Jiren, while suppressed, and UIO1 Goku, shook the World of Void.\n\nJust wanted to remind everyone of the above 2 points.\n\nIIRC the 2nd point was literally accepted until a certain mod threw a temper tantrum and reversed it without permission basically because he said so.\n\nAs for Jiren, I've always thought this made sense. His ki alone could shake the World of Void, and this is clearly an intentional move as UI Sign Goku then proceeds to perform the same feat. Meanwhile, 3 GoDs couldn't accomplish this, despite a fight between 2 being stated to result in the destruction of 2 universes. The GoDs also would have zero reason to not be at full power, as they were specifically testing the arena's durability and also would not want to disappoint the Zen-Oh twins, given how fickle they are. Also, Jiren's ki being enough to make Beerus sweat bullets is another point in its favor, especially when he specifically says \"Is this really the ki coming from one warrior?\"\n\nThough I will say, more people would scale than what you're saying.\n\nA lot of people scale to Restrained Jiren, including:\n\nPost-2nd UI SSB Goku, Broly/Super Hero Saga SSB Vegeta, SSBE ToP Vegeta, all forms of UI Sign Goku, all states of Jiren, the angels, SSJ2 Kefla, Wrathful, SSJ, and FPSSJ Broly, all forms of Gogeta, GoD Toppo, all forms of Super Hero Piccolo, all forms of Super Hero Gohan (except base), Transformed Anilaza, and Android 17's Barriers and Self-Destruction\n\nMost of this looks good, but why again do the first 2 scale?\n\nAnd doesn't Ultimate ToP Gohan scale to Koichirator who matched the first 2?\n\nA lot of people scale to Restrained Jiren, including:\n\nPost-2nd UI SSB Goku, Broly/Super Hero Saga SSB Vegeta, SSBE ToP Vegeta, all forms of UI Sign Goku, all states of Jiren, the angels, SSJ2 Kefla, Wrathful, SSJ, and FPSSJ Broly, all forms of Gogeta, GoD Toppo, Orange Piccolo, Beast Gohan (maybe Ultimate Piccolo and Ultimate Gohan in Super Hero too), Transformed Anilaza, and Android 17's Barriers and Self-Destruction\n\nBasically every Low 2-C that isn’t Infinite Zamasu gets their scaling from restrained Jiren in some way.\n\nAlso Beerus and Champa arguably scale, as Broly Saga SSB Goku was only stated to be nearing the level of the gods, and ToP Goku only surpassed Beerus with UIS2\n\nMost of this looks good, but why again do the first 2 scale?\n\nAnd doesn't Ultimate ToP Gohan scale to Koichirator who matched the first 2?\n\nThe first one is because Post-2nd UI Goku (though it's actually more like Post-Anilaza Fight Goku) can fight a Jiren who was starting to show a hint of his true power. As for the second one, in the Broly Saga and Super Hero Saga, Goku and Vegeta are portrayed as equal (even by the end of the last DBS episode, SSB Goku and SSB Vegeta are equal)\n\nAlso as for Ultimate Gohan in the ToP, again this is my mistake, it's more like Anilaza Fight SSB Goku, as he was still recovering his stamina up until that final beam clash with Anilaza, where he's able to go full power\n\nThe first one is because Post-2nd UI Goku (though it's actually more like Post-Anilaza Fight Goku) can fight a Jiren who was starting to show a hint of his true power. As for the second one, in the Broly Saga and Super Hero Saga, Goku and Vegeta are portrayed as equal (even by the end of the last DBS episode, SSB Goku and SSB Vegeta are equal)\n\nDidn't Jiren one-shot him and Vegeta just by flexing his energy field?\n\nAlso as for Ultimate Gohan in the ToP, again this is my mistake, it's more like Anilaza Fight SSB Goku, as he was still recovering his stamina up until that final beam clash with Anilaza, where he's able to go full power\n\nThat's fair, especially since Base Toppo was > Gohan.\n\n17 should probably get the same scaling as SSJB Goku for doing just as well against a serious Jiren.\n\nHell, when that energy field one-shot Goku and Vegeta he was fine.\n\nDidn't Jiren one-shot him and Vegeta just by flexing his energy field?\n\nThat's fair, especially since Base Toppo was > Gohan.\n\n17 should probably get the same scaling as SSJB Goku for doing just as well against a serious Jiren.\n\nHell, when that energy field one-shot Goku and Vegeta he was fine.\n\nYeah, I always hated that we treated 17 as weaker than SSB×20 Goku and SSBE Vegeta even though he fought the same Jiren they did and did just as well as them and took hits from that Jiren intended for them as well. He should've been scaling outright to them.\n\nKinda contradicted since Suppressed Jiren's ki had Beerus scared\n\nNot necessarily. Beerus could be shook since Jiren’s power is so close to him (all he says is; “Is this really the energy from just one warrior?!”), it doesn’t have to mean Jiren is stronger than him.\n\nAnd there’s more evidence for Beerus to scale above Broly Saga SSB Goku/Vegeta than there is for him being below restrained Jiren, UIS1 Goku and the others.\n\nThis is Full Power Jiren, not Suppressed Jiren. Again, there's a difference between his full power and just a hint of his true power.\n\nAlso, Goku and Vegeta were both really tired by this point.\n\nThat's fair, especially since Base Toppo was > Gohan.\n\n17 should probably get the same scaling as SSJB Goku for doing just as well against a serious Jiren.\n\nHell, when that energy field one-shot Goku and Vegeta he was fine.\n\nNo, because 17 was being overwhelmed by Toppo. He was only fine because androids of his model don't get tired"
