        "text": "The core of Majin Buu is that he's inscrutable. No one knows exactly how strong he is, no one knows the limits to what he can do, no one knows how smart he is or what he's thinking. I think Super Buu was at the best for that, since he'd seem dumb and then suddenly it turns out that your assumptions were wrong and things go sour. Kid Buu's still got a love of that but there aren't enough moments where you see that there's clearly more intelligence than he generally presents.\n\nManga Super Buu has a subtle design difference in that he starts off with hands that are somewhat malformed, between human hands and Super Buu's glove-like hands, but his fingers gradually separate and turn into more defined human hands as he absorbs more people, just like his face gets more defined.\n\nFat Buu is, on his own merits, a perfect Dragon Ball villain after the total snoozefest that is Cell. He's a cartoon idiot with stupid powers and an annoying voice, except he's a being of phenomenal cosmic power so the heroes just kind of fail at him over and over until Mr. Satan makes friends by telling him that murder is wrong.\n\nKid Buu's also fun by being a really pure Dragon Ball villain; he's nothing but violence and power levels, except there's no ego or desire for challenge. He just warps in, blows up your entire planet, reforms, and does it again over and over, and there's zero ability to reason with him, and the sheer lengths the heroes have to go to finally take him out land so much better than the bullshit conclusions of Freeza and Cell.\n\nSuper Buu is just Cell, and Cell is fucking lame. All he's got going for him is that part where he kills all of humanity one by one, so they just gave that to Kid Buu in FighterZ and called it a day.\n\nFat Buu is, on his own merits, a perfect Dragon Ball villain after the total snoozefest that is Cell.

Look, I like me some Cell saga goodness but Freeza is boring as shit. I fell in love love with DBZ when Cell and then, especially, Buu came into their own. Something literally 'tick'd' in my brain watching those. What a one-two punch of arcs.\n\nFat Buu is, on his own merits, a perfect Dragon Ball villain after the total snoozefest that is Cell.

Something literally 'tick'd' in my brain watching those. What a one-two punch of arcs.\n\nFreeza's cool (fnar fnar), but the great build up is all Namek really has and once Goku hits him with the Spirit Bomb, that's it. Goku just transforms and now his Number is bigger than Freeza's and the entire final battle is already decided, but let's drag it out a few chapters anyway.\n\nHey, Super Buu actually has moments where he's thought ahead. He outsmarts the heroes sometimes.\n\nI only like Super Buu when he's being weird, like when he summons an hourglass and stares at it to kill time.\n\nKid Buu easily. Super Buu is awful. Hate his personality.\n\nFat Buu is, on his own merits, a perfect Dragon Ball villain after the total snoozefest that is Cell.
