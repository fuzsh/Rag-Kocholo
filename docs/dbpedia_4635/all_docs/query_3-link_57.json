        "text": "We're hoping Windham teen, Eliott Kullman, known to his friends as \"Big Red\" is at least credited in his yearbook superlatives as having the \"Best Hair\" because let's be honest...it is an impressive set of locks.\n\nKullman's locks are so impressive that they have earned him a seat at the table of a national Mullet Champion competition.\n\nAccording to an interview he gave with MulletChamp.com, while it may look effortless most of the time, taming and shaping those firey red strands has been a bit of a challenge for this challenger. He had to go to 4 different stylists before one finally styled his mullet just the right way.\n\n\"I've gotten used to it and taking care of it. I get it cleaned up every 4 weeks. Also I thought I wouldn't be able to pull it off until a lot of people gave me confidence and I kept going. So here I am in 2024 with a nice amazing mullet and it's so nice to talk about it and a lot of people like taking pictures and talking about my mullet. It just amazes me and I am going to keep my mullet for a long time.\"\n\nAccording to the websites, there are 3 different categories for this premier \"Best Mullet\" competition; kids 0-1, kids 5-7, kids 8-13, teens 13-17, and adults 18+.\n\nBut it's not just bragging rights that these champions are fighting for, but some pretty sweet prizes!\n\n\"Participants across all age categories can compete for significant cash prizes, including $5,000 for both the kids and adult contests and $1,000 for the teens contest. Additionally, winners will receive an epic custom championship belt and a GoPro HERO12 Black Action Camera.\"\n\nSince its inception in 2020, the Mullet Champ contest has also been raising money for a good cause.\n\n\"100% of the donations made during the 2024 competition will directly benefit JAH4WW, allowing them to continue their mission to 'Serve Those Who Serve Us'.\n\nJared Allenâ€™s Homes for Wounded Warriors is a nationwide 501(c)(3) organization committed to providing Veterans who were wounded in combat with accessible, mortgage-free, injury-specific homes.\"\n\nIf you would like to support this Maine man's mullet, or any of the other sweet mullet contestants in this year's competition, you can vote here.\n\nBest of luck, Red Rooster! We're rootin' for you!"
