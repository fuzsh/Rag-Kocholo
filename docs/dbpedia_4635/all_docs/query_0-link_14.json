        "text": "@queen_marceline: Well I will kick this off.\n\nI dont really see a need to discuss who Spawn is. If you dont know who he is, then you been living under a rock. Go watch the movie or watch the HBO series you comic haters lol. But I will get into what he can do. Spawns powers are base on two things. His suit K-7 Leetha and his Necro powers.\n\nNecro Powers\n\nSimmons main source of power is Necro powers. This energy is hell base form of energy, that allows magical effects limited only by the imagination of the user, within limits of the necro counter. Think of the limits of this reality warping like magic in terms of a bucket. The energy can do anything, as long you have the water supply in the bucket to pour out. In Classic Spawn's case he had a limit of 9999 Energy. When it drains without refilling, he dies. However this is Divine Spawn and much like Hell King or higher, he has no limit to his Necro outside the scope of what he can affect with his imagination.\n\nThis Necro power is summed up well by the US Army who term it as Psycho Plasma due to the mind shaping it.\n\nHoudini explains magic is tricking the universe into believing something, thus warping the reality. Source of Spawn's power. Houdini also stated the K7-Leetha suit can perform many functions in itself to save energy.\n\nK-7 Leetha\n\nLeetha of the House of K. A parasitic suit, and potentially the strongest weapon in the universe as stated by God and Satan. These suits are specially made in the 4th Level of Hell for the Malbolgia's 8th Level Hellspawn. These suit allow Hellspawn to save Necro energy, and perform varying abilities. Simmons suit was specially made from him and 100% unique. Intended to be used by Lucifer as the ultimate weapon in the universe.\n\nLeetha suits are stated to eat souls for power, and to grow. Something that came to ahead in later Spawn comics with Downing.\n\nLeetha is fully able to act on its own, and was the top predator of its section of Hell.\n\nViolator states the suit is the greatest weapon ever conceived.\n\nViolator states against that the suit alone trumps the power of the Demon, Hell Kings, and Angels.\n\nMalbolgia states the suit at the time of Downing to be the most powerful weapon in the universe.\n\nThese two things of Necro and the Suit will be the crux of what beats Buu here. Now the next big question is what separates Divine Spawn from the rest?\n\nForbidden Fruit\n\nFor Spawn to be as all powerful as God or Satan, he first needed to eat the forbidden fruit from the Garden of Eve.\n\nMan of Miracles explains the real Adam and Eve story, and the secret of becoming equals with God and Lucifer.\n\nComic summary confirms Spawn is equals with God after eating the fruit.\n\nSo now some exposition on my part is dealt out, lets talk simple shit like strength and durability.\n\nStrength\n\nSpawn is stronger, that simple.\n\nSpawn using necro boost to one shot 100+ toner Savage Dragon.\n\nViolator who is also a 100+ toner wails on Spawn with his best blows, and Spawn easily blocks them, then ragdolls Violator.\n\nUrizen is an incredibly power Dark God. His size and mass is huge. Urizen can fissure the earth to the lava below. Urizen and Spawn's fight created small mountain where there was none from the forces being applied.\n\nSpawn's strength is more than able to throw multi story buildings, and over power Dark God Urizen who fissure the earth with his strength easy.\n\nSpawn breaks every bone, and busts every organ in Zera's body. Only the curse of unable to die ever from God keeps her living. Spawn still takes her head. Zera is the most powerful Angel that God ever made. God's version of the King of Hell, or on par with someone like Mammon who can create worlds, but only made for fighting. Just for some scale of this, Malebolgia and Mamon are world wreckers and creators. Dark God Urizen can physically manhandle the terrain of a planet. Zera trumps them. Yet Divine Spawn trumps her.\n\nWhy strength is important here? Well to be frank its the weakest aspect of DBZ guys. They have never shown lifting feats of any measure of impressiveness. Goku being weighed down by 40 tons without Super Saiyan for example. Ten Times Gravity being a insane work out by Frieza level. Spawn has reshape mountains, valleys, and lift casually over 1000 tons easy. He has the strength edge.\n\nDurability\n\nAs a God, Spawn was pretty much unkillable. Even when fighting equals in power he cannot be killed. He must will himself to die.\n\nEven before being Divine, Spawns healing factor is insane. Spawn is dragged into the Dead Zone, where his powers dont work, and has his head blown off. The moment his friends bring him out of the Dead Zone, Spawn regens his head. Showing decapitation is not enough anymore.\n\nSpawn allows Zera to cut him in half with her holy weapon. Instantly reforms while mocking her best shot.\n\nAs Divine Spawn, Spawn becomes equals with the raw awesome, and unlimited power of God and Satan. Stating they will just fight for eternity if Spawn wanted. Only way for Divine Spawn at that power level can die was if he allowed himself to be killed, which he did as part of Man of Miracles plan to remake a new universe with no God or Satan.\n\nHonestly Spawn is will beyond Planet Busting. He has true immortality to multi world and dimension creating beings. It would take Skyfather level being to harm or KO Spawn at this stage. Something I dont think Buu can live up to.\n\nIn the end, I feel Spawn has the better Hax, and will last longer than Buu to find a way to win. I will touch on more later.\n\n@sirfizzwhizz:\n\nMajin Buu's Introduction:\n\nBackground:\n\nBuu is the creation of Bibidi, who- wait, what? That's not true? What do you mean Toriyama retcon'd it? Whatever. Buu is a being who existed since the dawn of the universe, spending great amounts of time in hibernation while absorbing evil elements from mankind. He was the being Bibidi, who apparently didn't create him, was able to summon to spread destruction. Apparently.\n\n.....\n\nStupid retcon.\n\nPower-Output:\n\nBuu is easily above casual planet-busting, with a single attack being said to be able to destroy the planet Earth multiple times over. Not only this, but at 0:35 of the video it can be seen that Buu just screaming is enough to shake the Earth and spawn(heheh) natural disasters.\n\nLoading Video...\n\nIn his most powerful state, with Gohan absorbed, even Goku was afraid to fight him. Now, at first that may not sound very impressive....but you then have to consider the following; Goku was treating Fat Buu like a literal punching bag.\n\nNot only that, but his major character trait is loving to fight people as stronger or even stronger than himself. In Super, he even hires Hit(Universe 6's greatest assassin, who already beat Goku while using a handicap) to try to kill him just so they can fight. Not only this, but the current arc literally has his universe on the line, yet he acts like he isn't even bothered by it. Yet this guy was afraid of fighting Buu(Gohan absorbed).\n\nRegeneration:\n\nOne of Buu's greatest and most notable assets is his physiology. He can seem to regenerate from practically nothing. Below is Vegeta, using every bit of energy he has(and I mean everything, his body was petrified stone that turned to dust after he did it) in a super condensed blast:\n\nBuu reforms like nothing happened:\n\nBuu has two other unique abilities in his arsenal for when his raw power isn't enough.\n\nThe first, absorption. He can trap and absorb other beings within his flesh:\n\nThe second is the \"candy beam\", a beam that turns anything it touches into various candy.\n\nLoading Video...\n\nJust one thing I wanted to point out in your post:\n\nWhy strength is important here? Well to be frank its the weakest aspect of DBZ guys. They have never shown lifting feats of any measure of impressiveness. Goku being weighed down by 40 tons without Super Saiyan for example. Ten Times Gravity being a insane work out by Frieza level. Spawn has reshape mountains, valleys, and lift casually over 1000 tons easy. He has the strength edge.\n\nAre you really bringing this back into the debate? After we already went over it during our CaV with Raditz? Fights in Dragon Ball are constantly warping the land around them, if not destroying the planets themselves(more relevant with Buu since he literally just went around blowing them up until Goku/Vegeat lured him to them).\n\n@deathhero61 said:\n\n@sirfizzwhizz: Tag me for votes, I thought you hated debating against DBZ characters? I didn't think of all characters you would deal with Buu.\n\nQueen said he take on Spawn. I been wanting to Debate Spawn. It seem like the best chance.\n\n@queen_marceline:\n\nCounters\n\nAre you really bringing this back into the debate? After we already went over it during our CaV with Raditz? Fights in Dragon Ball are constantly warping the land around them, if not destroying the planets themselves(more relevant with Buu since he literally just went around blowing them up until Goku/Vegeat lured him to them).\n\nDBZ characters are Small mountain to island level at best in striking feats. In the show and manga they have issues with anything over 1000 tons much less millions. Its notable to point out. Now back to the debate of how I see this going down.\n\nRegeneration:\n\nOne of Buu's greatest and most notable assets is his physiology. He can seem to regenerate from practically nothing. Below is Vegeta, using every bit of energy he has(and I mean everything, his body was petrified stone that turned to dust after he did it) in a super condensed blast:\n\nBuu reforms like nothing happened:\n\nBuu has great regen, so does Divine Spawn. The argument here is who can put the other down first. This includes who will take the most damage, and deal the most damage, and who has the better hax. All in Spawn's category IMO.\n\nBuu has two other unique abilities in his arsenal for when his raw power isn't enough.\n\nThe first, absorption. He can trap and absorb other beings within his flesh:\n\nAhh yes, though this Absorption failed on someone as powerful as Vegito who not only took the absorption of their own free will, but then screwed Buu up from the inside. I dont see Spawn with his power level and abilities like Teleport succumbing to this.\n\nThe second is the \"candy beam\", a beam that turns anything it touches into various candy.\n\nAnother ability Vegito overcome being too powerful, however Spawn can manipulate his body, and create something out of nothing via Transmutation anyway via Necro.\n\nSpawn creates a Marble Statue out of air for practice.\n\nSpawn makes beer out of thin air.\n\nSpawn tries to make himself look normal but finds its limitations is only to look like other people. A built in curse from Malbolgia at the time.\n\nFew examples of Spawn shapeshifting into hundreds of bats to get around.\n\nSo I doubt this will work at all. In the end I can see Spawn simply outlasting Buu's finite power levels. Another Move Spawn can make is use telepathy to flat out beat Buu.\n\nSpawn mentally implants into Wynn's head that his skin was ripped off when it was not. Living in pain of being flayed alive everyday.\n\nSpawn casts a black magic user into a world of illusion, his personal hell, and makes him commit suicide.\n\nSpawn forces this murderer to feel the pain and terror of every victim she ever had.\n\nSpawn absorbs the sins and pains of every living person in Manhattan, and bears it.\n\nSpawn gains power of the Green World to have empathy of every living thing on the planet.\n\nEvery living thing on the planet becomes Spawn's eyes and ears.\n\nSpawn is able to listen and feel the thoughts of every human on earth at all times.\n\nI do not recall any defense for this."
