        "text": "WordPress blogger “asexualfeminist” published a post talking about the men of Dragon Ball Z. He/She criticizes the show, because he feels like the show portrays women and men in a bad light. After reading the post, I concluded that the author was discussing Dragon Ball Z in a more superficial light and seems to be more concerned with political correctness than the entertainment aspects of the show. I’ll bring up the examples.\n\n“The comment thread began with an explanation that Akira Toriyama treats his male characters poorly as well as his female characters. My first point is that yes, this is true. Akira Toriyama is constantly playing up stereotypes of both genders, but in the Dragon Ball/Dragon Ball Z Universe, you earn respect of both fans and the characters in the show by being the toughest and the strongest. Each character’s worth is hinged upon their ability to hold their own in a fight. If you cannot compete with that arc’s big bad then your character is shafted to a more minor role. It’s very convenient that the stereotype for men is to be a tough, strong badass.”\n\nYeah, “tough, strong badasses” is a male stereotype, but there’s more to the characters than just being strong fighters. Goku constantly wants to test his limits, and enjoys fighting, and training. He fights for the people and represents the good. Piccolo’s the son of a demon king(sounds badass to me) who knows martial arts and who used to be evil, Vegeta lived under another man’s control as a soldier, had his parents and entire race destroyed by said man, and was a prince of a race of powerful warriors who prided themselves on strength. Gohan’s actually a smart kid and arguably kind of nerdy with that superhero costume but he’s been forced to fight and watch friends die since a young age. He never really liked to fight all that much, unlike the others. These guys don’t exactly have normal upbringings. It’s not muscles, yelling, and cool moves that make them the”tough, strong badasses” we perceive them to be. It’s the stories and personalities of the characters, (along with the cool moves). They’re all martial artists who constantly have to save the world from extremely powerful beings,of course they’re going to be tough and strong, even the weaker ones.\n\n“While there are exceptions, which I’ll get into later, these are the stereotypes Akira Toriyama presses. There are too many male characters to go person by person like I did for the women of DBZ, but in Toriyama’s series men are the epitome of typical masculinity. They are incredibly muscled (which is fine as the show is so action based and requires them to be so) and they do not show serious emotions other than anger. If they do then the audience knows something is serious. The male characters don’t cry very often. I can count the number of times a male character cries on one hand: Vegeta cries when Frieza kills him, Trunks crieswhen the androids kill Gohan in The History of Trunks movie, and Gohan cries when Piccolo dies and when Goku sacrifices himself to destroy Cell. It is rare for someone to cry; it is not manly. Goku doesn’t cry when he realizes Vegeta and Nappa killed Yamcha, Tien, Piccolo, and Chiaotzu; he gets angry. Vegeta doesn’t cry when Cell kills his son Trunks; he gets angry. Unless the character is young, as in the case of both Gohan and Trunks, or the situation is incredibly serious, the more acceptable response is anger.”\n\nYeah, the acceptable response is anger because being angry means you want to beat the shit outta someone, which is usually what we want to see anyways. When Goku was turning Super Saiyan because of Krillin dying, he was speaking through a cracking voice. He was sad because his best friend had been killed, again, in front of him.. I know I’m not the only one who remembers how Vegeta would stop at nothing to become a Super Saiyan, just like Goku. Hearing him talk about how he trained so intensely and how angry he was that Goku was a Super Saiyan, and he wasn’t , and his mental state during the training inspired you, because he spoke with conviction. The desire to surpass Goku was so strong, he was obsessed. Even though his goal was selfish, you could still feel his pain, without him needing to cry or be overly sad about it. Just because you don’t shed tears doesn’t mean you aren’t sad on the inside, it’s just that you usually need anger to fight or to push yourself to a new limit. We know the characters are sad, but we don’t want to see them break down in front of the enemy they still have to defeat. We want to see them rise up, get angry, and beat the crap outta them! The victims are usually healed or revived by the Dragon Balls anyways, or there’s a time-skip, so there’s really no chance to see someone mourn a loss over a long period of time. The number of time people cry doesn’t mean shit, it’s the reaction to the event that matters the most. Another example of a superficial look at the show.Do you want them to be vulnerable sometimes, or do you just want to see these macho men cry some more?\n\n“This becomes a problem because although the series is so deeply rooted in action scenes, almost all of the plot arcs are character based. It is severely limiting to the characters when the emotional responses are kept within a neat box of what’s acceptable for men. I do understand that this is Japanese culture and the cultural norms are bound to be different, but no matter what culture it comes from sexism is still sexism. Boys should not be exposed to the idea that men can only solve problems through violence. This is the first way Akira Toriyama treats his male leads poorly: he doesn’t let them be fully developed and provides a poor image for young boys.”\n\nMore bullshit. DBZ doesn’t tell boys that problems can only be solved by fighting, it tells you that problems can be solved by never giving up and persevering. Vegeta’s determination to become a super saiyan, Goku’s fight against Frieza, and Gohan saving the world from Cell are just some examples.All the problems solved with fighting are usually with assholes who want to rule the universe, and they’re not interested in peace. Goku always asks his opponents to surrender and shows mercy to his opponents, so it’s not like he hasn’t tried to be peaceful. Gohan also warned Perfect Cell not to push his anger to a boiling point by killing his friends.\n\nThe author then explains how the “less masculine” characters, like Oolong, Master Roshi, and young Krillin are pervs and sexist pigs and that Master Roshi has tried to inappropriately touch Bulma on several occasions. Yes, they do those things, and it’s not honorable, but that doesn’t really mean anything. Krillin was a teenager, Master Roshi has been living by himself on an island for God knows how long, and Oolong is LITERALLY a selfish, obnoxious pig. They’re on an island isolated from society! What do you expect? It doesn’t make it right, it just tells you why it is.\n\n“For all that I love DBZ the portraits of the male protagonists are not progressive and only further distance the ideals that men and women should strive for. By highlighting such different and and harmful ideals for the two sexes DBZ and Toriyama promotes a sexist society”\n\nHe concludes that although he loves DBZ, he accuses Toriyama of pushing a sexist agenda. Just because there’s no lesbians out of the women or none of the characters are sensitive hipsters, doesn’t make the show sexist. No one who watched DBZ gives a shit about a “sexist agenda”. The show is dramatic when it needs to be. The women don’t have prominent roles because none of them like to fight and train as much as the men. They’d rather support the men who do, and their kids. Even #18, Krillin’s wife, later in the series, who’s stronger than Krillin, prefers to stay with the child while Krillin goes off with the others to find Babidi’s base.\n\nDragon Ball Z is a classic, as we all know. Nothing’s politically accurate in a show with aliens, talking animals, and super-powered martial artists. It’s not a representation of what you think society should be like, It’s a show about never giving up and pushing yourself to new heights.\n\n“When there’s a will, there’s a way”-Goku"
