        "text": "Although he never really was a villain, N is my favorite. Because all he really wanted was for Pokemon to be free from abuse, and have the ability to be free.\n\nMyotismon made a pretty believable villain. He abducted Gatomon when she was still in her rookie form, and forced her to carry out assassination missions, and all the while, Gatomon was waiting for her chance to leave him and get her revenge on him. When she finally breaks free and finds happiness as the Digimon of the 8th Digi Destined, Myotismon kills the one who was her only friend for years, Wizardmon, therefore setting himself up for his own downfall by enabling Gatomon to digivolve.\n\nAlso, he almost killed Lillymon as well, and also killed the Tyrannomon that he sent after the Digi Destined after Lillymon used an ability to turn him good D:\n\nThe 4 Masters are probably worse, especially Piedmon (then again, I think Machinedramon was probably worse than Piedmon, haven't watched those episodes in ages though)\n\nEdit: Lex Luthor is probably my all time favorite villain. Because he's a master criminal, but manages to use the law to successfully hide/justify his crimes. And he even sometimes helps the good guys out when the Earth is in danger.\n\nEdited June 3, 2014 by Pegasus\n\nOnce upon a time, prior to even my fandom for Sonic, I was hugely into DBZ as a younger kid, as many young boys were and still are. I loved the explosions, the cool attacks, the amazing fight scenes, and the intense music. Just recently, thanks to boredom and Youtube, I've been able to re-watch almost any fight scene imaginable, in its' entirety. I watched Goku and Frieza, I watched every battle the Z fighters had with Cell, but I was soon reminded why my peak of interest in DBZ was actually more towards the end of its' first TV series, than its' beginning.\n\nThis pink fucker.\n\nFor those who didn't watch DBZ at all (what kind of childhood and or young adulthood did you have?), or who didn't keep up with the show (or manga) far enough to encounter this demonic hellspawn made of bubblegum, Majin Buu is not only the most powerful and final villain of the DBZ initial series, but also has the most interesting back story. He's a timeless entity that's been around since near the beginning of time, who goes on rampages every few millennia, then goes back into hibernation. He has the power to absorb others and transform based on their powers, and even traits of their personality. He was awakened by the evil wizard Bibidi a long time before the start of the series, absorbed many powerful individuals, and then was locked away for a while more. A long while later, Bibidi's descendant, Babidi, unleashed him upon the world again.\n\nBibidi, Babidi, Buu :3\n\nBuu is the quintessential bad guy for many young boys, I think, he certainly was for me. In two of his three major forms, he's incredibly child-like, resorting to even the most amusing of visual gags and taunts while in the heat of battle against even the legendary OP protagonists, like Goku and Vegeta; taking these two on at the same time later on, in fact.\n\nDo you like what you see, Vegeta?\n\nYet, at the same time, he's incredibly lethal, having demonstrated to wipe out all of humanity with little effort, being capable of coming back and regenerating from big name attacks that bested many past super baddies, and generally being an itch that took the DBZ cast an entire season to finally be rid of.\n\nKid Buu is my favorite, because he's completely insane, debateably the most powerful (though many say his prior form, Super Buu is more powerful), and undoubtedly the most dangerous, due to his violent and unpredictable behavior.\n\nBuu's known for being pink, doing crazy things that most other characters can't, liking candy, and being a goofball.\n\nGuess who he gets crossovered with quite a lot? x)\n\nMy favourite villains, hm?\n\nWell, I think on mlp its quite obvious: Discord.\n\nBut Chrysalis is awesome, too.\n\nOver all, there is one villain who beats even Discord in Epicness: Saint Dane.\n\nThere is no villain better than this manipulating, Chaos-bringing, time-and-dimensions-traveling Shapeshifter.\n\nHe is just plain awesome.\n\nAnother Villain I absolutely love, is Scapegrace. Where other villains stick out with their badassery, this guy sticks out with his lack of skills in being what he wants to be. First, he was the \"Supreme Ultimate Killer\", the one who ascends murder to an Art - but he never ever managed to kill anyone. Later, he got himself killed, and comes back as a Zombie. Now, he is the leader of a large horde of Zombies (a moron called Thrasher), and calls himself \"The Ultimate Zombie King\". But he has always to keep some glue with him because his nose and ears keep falling of, and to travel in an iceselling wagon with a penguin on top. This villain is just hilariously ridiculous.\n\nAnd a fourth villain I love is Seth, from the Kane Chronicles. God of Chaos and so on, another Discord-type villain.\n\nSo I come to my fifth favourite villain: Mr. Teatime. An Assassin tasked with inhuming the Hogfather (the Discworld-Equivalent of Santa Claus). No problem for him, since he makes plans to kill such entities for an hobbie from childhood on. The plan: Kidnapping the Toothfairy and making her hand him the teeth from all the children, then making some voodoo to make the kids not believe in the Hogfather anymore. Since such entities live on believe, he dies of starvation, and Death has to do his job while his granddaughter tries to stop Teatime. (Long Story).\n\nEdited June 25, 2014 by YetAnotherDiscord"
