        "text": "Majin Buu was the last antagonist of the DB manga and Z anime\n\nSo due to this, I was wondering, how do you feel about Buu and his arc overall? I mean to me, his entire concept and powers are outright absurd and in a franchise like Dragonball, that is saying something. Like, regenerating from smoke, turning people into candy? As well, his first form is one of the biggest examples of mood whiplash ever. For his other forms, I admit, I personally like Super Buu at first but when he absorbs people, in the words of TeamFourStar, he just becomes a blander version of Perfect Cell. As for Kid Buu....he's just insane and whacky, which can be entertaining but doesn't have much going for him. When I was younger, I did dislike this arc compared to the others and its still my least favorite Z saga overall honestly.\n\nI thought Toriyama was testing how much deranged shit he could trick people into eating, and by the time he realized how much shit people would happily eat, he was too far into it to close down the shit wagon.\n\nNote, I also have the same reading into Frank Herbert's Dune, particularly in the God Emperor phase.\n\nthe last wheels came off the train. Even taking into account the sillyness of Dragonball in general, all the nonsense of Buu saga was what defined a lot of the terrible aspects of DB that are still going on today. Multiple super saiyan forms stupid fusion transformations, stupid deus ex machina bullshit, completely taking the piss of characters you either just introduced or just had waste time pretending to be relevant. DBZ would have been better as an overall work if Toriyama had ended off on Freiza or Cell saga\n\nGoing to join the others and call it the weakest \"canon\" saga. It starts off great, but goes downhill around the time the grey Majin Buu shows up and afterwards falls off a cliff when Buu starts absorbing people, and then it just becomes tedious. I mean the saga retcons itself numerous times by the end and Buu got extremely old with all of his forms and regeneration, and the saga wastes your time with multiple narrative fake outs that could have ended the whole thing.\n\nSSJ3 also happens to be weak new form it comes out of nowhere with no build up looks dumb and its completely useless in every appearance. The only real bright spot of the saga is Vegeta's character development, and fusion is a cool concept.\n\nI actually like the whole Buu insanity a lot, as well as the increased humor, but I just despise the entire underlying writing of the saga regarding its handling of the main cast. Suddenly everyone who wasn't a Saiyan was weaker than the Saiyans, to the point of Android 18 being scared by the power of Goten and Trunks and Piccolo being considered weaker than the base (older) Saiyans by Dabura, but when we last saw him in the Cell Saga he easily was stronger than a standard Super Saiyan.\n\nFollowing that, later Piccolo was just relegated to a humorous mentor role where he doesn't really get to be portrayed as knowledgeable, making several goofy mistakes. Then there's the awkwardness of the protagonist shift from Gohan back to Goku which leaves a lot of early set up completely sidelined by the end.\n\nI like the arc inasmuch as it's the point where basically everyone has gotten so used to being so strong that they got complacent enough to let this shit go on until it got out of control lmao\n\nBuu is literally tearing the fabric of the universe apart there at the end and Gojeta just keeps playing games\n\nExecution wasn't the best but rewatching the Kai cut was a lot of fun for me & my friends picking the Z fighters apart for their shitty foresight\n\nNamek arc is the best one though\n\nEh the end of it always seem like it dragged for me. I recently reread the whole manga and i still felt like it drags. I don't think it's bad of course, just not as good as the Saiyan.\n\nIffy start with the slice of life shenanigans (which people hate on too much, honestly), AMAZING execution and execution to both the Majin Buu birth and Majin Vegeta fight (honestly my favorite part of dbz, regardless of how I feel about the saga in general), good build up to Mystic Gohan,\n\nand then Gotenks happened...\n\nand then Goku and Vegeta took the reigns again...\n\nEasily the worst saga in manga Dragonball.\n\nThe pacing in the original anime was absolutely ridiculous as well, even compared to the past arcs.\n\nI've only sat down and went through the whole thing a few times. Outside of some key scenes, it's so messy and underwhelming I usually lose interest before I finish. A pretty \"meh\" arc to end the series on overall.\n\nHas a lot of fun parts like Gohan's high school adventures and everything with Mr. Satan and Fat Buu, but overall it just drags too much and is very meandering. Super Buu was terrible and easily the worst stretch of the show.\n\nI would've loved if that arc was just Gohan just going to high school and getting up with shenanigans with his super hero alter ego. I agree that was the best part of the arc.\n\nThen again, I'm one of those dorks who liked Dragon Ball when it was exclusively an Action Comedy manga, as Toriyama works best with comedy."
