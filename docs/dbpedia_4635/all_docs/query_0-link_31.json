        "text": "One of the worst things you can ever do with a hero is to do something that gets them well and truly furious, because rage makes good guys unbeatable. They will go into a frenzy and become stronger, faster, braver, more agile and more indestructible than they've ever been, and they will annihilate you. This holds particularly true if the character in question is generally meek and feeble. Often indicated with Angry Eyebrows in animation. Caution must be employed by the character, since such tantrums can sometimes lead to a Heroic BSOD.\n\nUsed widely in Sh≈çnen manga-based anime. Perhaps because the young male demographic likes to see fast and brutal retribution against enemies who most likely brought it on themselves.\n\nSometimes referred to gaining Heroic Resolve, particularly if it's in response to a threat against somebody or something that the hero cares about. This is a common result of pressing the character's Berserk Button, and especially occurs if a nice person is pushed a little too far. They might cry but won't stop their attacks. Characters in the grip of an Unstoppable Rage are prone to a Foe-Tossing Charge. They might Kick Them While They Are Down without realizing that they are doing it.\n\nFor the quantum leap in badassery achieved without an emotional overflow, see Let's Get Dangerous. In videogames, this is often a Limit Break, or a Eleventh-Hour Superpower.\n\nInterestingly enough, this usually has the opposite effect on villains. Making them angry usually causes them to lose focus, and make poor decisions. Unless they are a video game enemy.\n\nCompare with Super-Powered Evil Side. See also Rage Breaking Point and Rant-Inducing Slight, where this is set off by a multitude of things piling up until a final event proves to be the last straw.\n\nContrast with Tranquil Fury, often preceded by a Death Glare. May be instilled in Actual Pacifists with Teach Him Anger. A character who lives by this and counts on it may be The Berserker. A Roaring Rampage of Revenge (or its smaller, arguably more spontaneous counterpart, Extreme Melee Revenge) may include this.\n\nExamples of Unstoppable Rage include:\n\nAnime and Manga\n\nDragonball Z: Gohan. Though suffice to say, nearly every Saiyan character qualifies at one point or another. But Gohan is the outlier, because his potential since the beginning was defined as Unstoppable Rage.\n\nOnly when he gets into his early adulthood is he actually able to fully access it without any emotional assistance. Other than that, the power disappeared soon after Gohan went Super Saiyan 2; Vegeta even later comments that he was a lot stronger when he was a kid.\n\nLikely due to being calmer with age, since at first, all someone had to do is down Krillin to get Gohan to go crazy. Later, Cell had to practically torture his friends and family to make Gohan lose it and after that, he only lost his temper after feeling shame and realizing Majin Buu was going to be released.\n\nGoku's first Super Saiyan transformation also qualifies. He's out of power, then has to watch Piccolo, his rival and valuable ally at the time, and his best friend, Krillin, both get attacked by Frieza, with Krillin murdered outright. This pushes Goku over the edge.\n\nBroly is Hulk without the green skin. As he gets madder, his power increases, but sooner or later he has to cool off.\n\nSonic X in its third season had the eponymous character Sonic at one point absorb negative energies from fake Chaos Emeralds which unleashed when he became angry upon seeing his friends badly beaten and at risk of execution. The resultant fight involved him beating the everloving crap out of two robots specifically designed to be difficult to defeat. His long-time nemesis, Dr. Robotnik/Eggman, convinces him to stop his rage.\n\nNaruto has the Nine-Tailed Fox form that Naruto engages during instances of extreme emotional disturbance. The first time is when Sasuke defends him from Haku's lethal technique, followed by several later instances when Naruto is angered. said Rage will inevitablely cause Naruto's lifespan to be shortened, due to his constantly dying/regenerating cells while the form is active). Also, if Naruto completely loses it, the Fox will take possession of his body.\n\nOrochimaru invokes this trope. And boy does he not learn his lesson.\n\nFor Code Geass, with all a lot of characters being over-protective of another, this happens a number of times. Suzaku stands out particularly, despite being two-thirds pacifist and displaying warrior-like grace, the moment when he witnesses Euphy being shot causes him to go berserk, charging through the battlefield and through two mechas that posed a serious threat to him in order to rescue Princess Euphemia following which he abandons the battle entirely. This later seemingly pushes him past his Moral Event Horizon.\n\nRanma ¬Ω: A more comedic use of the trope, if Ranma's fear of cats reaches a critical point (especially when surrounded by them and unable to get away), his mental state becomes like that of a cat. He can only use the Neko-ken (cat fist) when in this state, which manifests as an increase in speed and agility, and the ability to attack enemies (or anything else that annoys him) with invisible claws sharp enough to slice through seemingly anything. As mentioned before, though, his mind and personality are those of a common cat, making this also an example of Sanity Has Advantages: Ranma is distractable, unfocused and generally stupid in this mode, meaning that he can be outthought fairly easily. In this state, Akane finds herself the Kid with the Leash, as Ranma will joyfully savage his/her own Jerkass father without a second thought, he curls up with her like a happy kitten, even though he is insistent that She Is Not My Girlfriend.\n\nIn Princess Mononoke, this happens to Nago and almost to Okkoto, who are rhinoceros-sized wild boars to begin with. Their rage is the source of their whole tribes being slaughtered by humans and only end when they are killed.\n\nIn Eyeshield 21. After Taiyou's defeat against the Hakushuu Dinosaurs, a stupid fan (recurring Jerkass background character Satoshi of Deimon's soccer team) mocked one of Taiyou's offensive linemen, Banba, who was beaten brutally by Gaou Rikiya despite his best effort. This pissed off Gaou, who admired Banba's determination, and he demand the idiot to show himself. When the coward didn't show up, he decided to just completely freak out on the spectators until the guy fessed up. Luckily, Riku saves the day by taking the blame (although Gaou can see that Riku didn't say that, he let it off, impressed by Riku's courage).\n\nIs also subverted numerous times such as when Tetsuma charges at Gaou after he severely injures Kid and is still soundly defeated\n\nIn Mobile Fighter G Gundam, this is initially played straight with Domon Kasshu's Shining Gundam and its Super Mode. He even yells \"Take this! My love, my anger, and all of my sorrow!\". This is later subverted as he finds out this is the \"imperfect\" mode. His more powerful Hyper Mode can only be used when he is in a completely zen state of peace, calm, and focus.\n\nIn the finale of Gao Gai Gar, after the final super Zonder's (Mikoto) barrier is weakened, you would expect Guy to wrap it up and finish the fight quickly. Instead, he completely brutalizes the Zonder, ripping off one of its wings, stomping on its head, punching its arms off. To top that off, he didn't even bother with Hell and Heaven, he just aimed at the core and ripped it out. All of this while screaming in anger.\n\nSee Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. See Kira get angry. See Kira go crazy, and completely disable all of his enemies in seconds.\n\nThat's not Kira angry. Go watch the episode where He and Athrun succumb to their rage and try to kill one another. Both of them convey their rage very well with the sheer brutality of their attacks. No more hesitation, no more clever tricks. Their minds are set on the same part of the dial: \"Two men enter, one man leaves.\" Unfortunately for Kira, between the two of them, Athrun is the better of the two in melee combat.\n\nTo say nothing of Shinn from Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny.\n\nIn Gundam Wing, Heero enters an Unstoppable Rage during his first use of the Gundam Epyon because of the ZERO System's side effects.\n\nSetsuna F. Seiei from Gundam 00 generally keeps very good control of himself if he gets mad, but he does have one case of pure rage: during the intervention in Azodistan, he witnesses a scene that reminds him of the horrific war he participated in as a child, which causes him to snap and go completely ballistic on the attacking Suits. Most of the time, in Gundam 00, blind rage = quick death for pilots, be they flying a Gundam or not.\n\nFuyuki Hinata in the manga/anime Keroro Gunsou becomes so frightening when angry that all other characters shrink back in horror. It takes a very serious personal offence to rile him.\n\nNeon Genesis Evangelion such as when Shinji goes berserk and EVA begins to eat one of the angels.\n\nIn Rebuild of Evangelion Shinji gets angered again and goes into an unstoppable rage.\n\nAyato Kamina from RahXephon seems to be quite capable of working himself into an unstoppable rage in combat. His common method of combat is very much the raging badass screaming his way into battle, and as a general rule, the second Ayato releases a soul-tearing scream of pure rage, the enemy Dolem is about to die.\n\nThe slightly related Engels and Tagers get a little irritated if you knock out their pilots, and Engels become enraged if the wrong pilot gets in the cockpit. During this state, they'll try to kill anything that looks remotely threatening that isn't of the same type of being. They don't gain strength or do more damage, but they make all skill rolls as if they had three points in each skill, and don't suffer wound penalties.\n\nChimchar in an episode of Pok√©mon. That was enough for Paul to try everything he could to bring out that power again.\n\nAfter being knocked unconscious by Paul's Ursaring in a later battle, the true extent of Chimchar's power is unleashed and it needs a Cooldown Hug when it doesn't go back to normal. This unnatural power has been explained as its ability, Blaze.\n\nLater on, after it's evolved into Monferno, it does this again, and requires another Cooldown Hug from Ash in order to calm down. Then it evolves into Infernape, after which it's able to control the Ability.\n\nAlso seen with the Pokemon Mankey, and more so with its evolved form Primeape, which has a Hair-Trigger Temper and goes into an Unstoppable Rage at the drop of a hat.\n\nPlayed for Laughs with Jessie, especially when her hair gets damaged. Poor Seviper found out the hard way.\n\nNone of the above hold a candle to a pissed-off Mewtwo.\n\nYu-Gi-Oh naturally turned this effect into a card, \"Berserker Soul\", and had it used by Yami Yugi during one of his own moments of Unstoppable Rage. \"DORO! MONSUTAA KAADO!\"\n\nThe best and aforementioned example the third season, after Yugi's soul is taken by the Oricalchos and Insector Haga taunts Yami by tearing up a card in front of him claiming it was Yugi's, just \"as a joke\", and Yami completely loses it.\n\nEven worse for Haga: Since a duel within the Seal is effectively a Shadow Game, he physically felt each and every blow Breaker dealt to him. The true chill-down-the-spine moment, however, comes shortly after he reveals his ruse:\n\nYami: Wash your neck and wait, Haga.\n\nThis order was traditionally given to prisoners before being executed, meaning Yami had gone past saying \"I'm going to kick your ass\" and into \"I am going to kill you, Haga\", which he then proceeded to carry out with brutal efficiency.\n\nIn full swing for Judai by Season 4 of Yu-Gi-Oh GX‚Äîif he says \"This Is Unforgivable!\".\n\nIn Saint Seiya, Phoenix Ikki goes into unstoppable rage mode when his master, Guilty, kills his Morality Pet Esmeralda specifically to provoke him into fighting. It ends very badly for Guilty.....very.\n\nSubaru of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Striker S is normally a happy and energetic sort... until you hurt and threaten to take away her sister, that is. Then her eyes go glowy as rocks around her float from residual energy. Her resulting rampage sent two of the Quirky Miniboss Squad scurrying and put one of their strongest and most experienced members out of commission for the rest of the season.\n\nAlso, Vita in A's after her hat got damaged by Nanoha.\n\nCaro is no slouch either. The response when she found that her squad's home is destroyed: she summons Voltaire. (\"Godzilla with wings\" wouldn't be an inaccurate description.)\n\nTsukasa Domyoji from Hana Yori Dango rules the elite private school he attends not because he's an absurdly rich pretty boy but, because when pissed off (and he has an infamously short temper), he will try to kill anyone in his path. And he's the male romantic lead; the reason why he's at first interested in the female lead Tsukushi Makino is because she's the first Eitoku student who defies him openly, to the point of bitchslapping him often.\n\nBerserk put it in the title, so it's a major part of the series.\n\nA particularly notable example from the anime comes during the Griffith rescue arc, when Guts finds out just what had been done to Griffith. After holding him for a few moments with tears in his eyes, he smashes through a thick wooden door to take out the bastard who had tortured him, and then proceeds to go utterly berserk on every last Midland guard standing between the Hawks and the way out. They don't call this guy the \"Hundred Man Slayer\" for nothing.\n\nThe most extreme example came when the Eclipse happened, when Guts sees the only other survivor of the massacre, his lover Casca, being assaulted by demons, he goes flying into an extreme rage and goes barreling toward the horde, only to have his left arm clamped down on by another demon. Then, to make matters worse, newly made demon lord Griffith-turned-Femto flies down and begins raping Casca, which serves to piss Guts off to the very extreme, and when his sword breaks against the flesh of the demon who is holding him captive, so embroiled in rage he is that Guts doesn't so much as to even twitch at the pain of HACKING OFF HIS OWN ARM TO ESCAPE. He's covered in his own blood, screaming Griffith's name, white-eyed with fury and everything else. Nothing can stop this fucker now. Unfortunately, Guts' rage is anything but unstoppable, and isn't enough to save Casca.\n\nIt's generally not smart to get Wolfgang Grimmer of Monster angry. It's generally not survivable either.\n\nIn Elfen Lied, the main character Lucy is almost constantly in this state when she isn't in her alternate personality Nyu, due to a lifetime of almost constant abuse, deprivation, and trauma. Considering that her powers as a diclonius are a recipe for an all-out gorefest, triggering the Lucy persona may well be the last thing you ever do.\n\nWhen the Major is beating the crap out of you with a stoic expression, she's actually just toying with you until you realize the futility of trying to fight her. If you somehow manage to really make her pissed, it will be very obvious, but you will probably never get the chance to fully comprehend what's happening to you. This womans normal range of expression consists entirely of stoic and smiling politely. When her anger is showing, the point of reasoning with her is long over. And being a cyborg, she doesn't even care if she gets limbs torn off or her body crushed, making her truly unstoppable. The only two opponents who ever defeated her were inside Humongous Mecha, which she attacked bare handed.\n\nIn Slam Dunk, the first thing Heavy Sleeper Kaede Rukawa clearly says is \"My name is Rukawa Kaede, I'm a freshman, and I will never forgive whoever wakes me up when I'm napping.\" Cue to him beating up the gangsters who woke him up from his nap.\n\nSeveral players in The Prince of Tennis have a penchant for injuring their rivals during games. The most infamous ones are Akaya Kirihara from Rikkaidai, Jin Akutsu from Yamabuki and Kippei Tachibana from Fudomine. Subverted in Tachibana's case: after he seriously injures his best friend and teammate Chitose, he becomes The Atoner and refuses to use violent tennis anymore. Which makes him easy prey for Kirihara's Devil Mode later.\n\nPeople who piss off Kenshiro (usually by going too far in their cruelty to others) usually don't live to tell the tale. In fact, if they do, they're already dead. This is at least explained in the series by the fact that his fighting style is designed to increase in power proportional to exactly how angry he is. At normal levels of anger, he can break concrete with his fists. When he is at full power, he can make a tank explode by punching the driver.\n\nIf you're an Akuma, and you tick off Allen Walker of D Gray Man too much, you're likely to make his Innocence upgrade. Or you might make it angry. That would be a bad thing.\n\nThink about it in this way: a permanent upgrade to his weapon will only hamper your goals in the long run, but if you get the weapon mad you will lose so much of your force, that the scales will probably balance.\n\nKazuya Ryuuzaki in Daimos is generally an all around nice guy, especially towards the Earthlings, and he tries to be good for some Not So Different aliens. But after seeing Miwa's racism towards innocent aliens too many times... he snaps, jumps dodging an attempted shot from Miwa and starts beating the crap out of him using Karate (thankfully on foot, rather than stomping him with the eponymous mecha) while screaming that Miwa was actually worse than the aliens (which is actually true). Kyoshiro and Nana managed to stop him after hearing that Miwa would be arrested for his crimes, but even after being restrained, Kazuya cannot stop to scream at them telling them to stop restraining him. This also gets taken to Super Robot Wars Advance, done with full amounts of awesome.\n\nBoth Takato and Guilmon of Digimon Tamers simultaneously go into an uncharacteristic rage upon the death of Juri's Leomon, with disasterous results. Guilmon and his evolutions even have a hazard symbol to hint that you really shouldn't piss him off.\n\nSpeaking of uncharacteristic rage, T.K.'s/Takaishi Takeru had moments of intense anger in Digimon Adventure 02. The first time said anger was shown has him physically beating the Digimon Kaiser while shrugging off the blows of the latter's whip.\n\nAnd he looks and talks so damn calmly just before doing that.\n\nIn the very final chapter of Tekkaman Blade, Blade's brain breaks down completely because of his Deadly Upgrade. Right when it looks like we're all doomed, he suddenly lets out a roar and zips off to the moon to have a nice, dramatic final battle. Did he get better? Nah. It's just that a single aspect survived the complete destruction of his entire personhood - his rage toward the Radam for taking away his family. It really puts the \"unstoppable\" in Unstoppable Rage.\n\nIn Chrono Crusade, Chrono has moments when his Berserk Button is pressed where he taps into his demonic power and starts to attack indiscriminately. In one particularly bad moment of this, he sets part of a city ablaze and nearly kills Rosette because of the massive drain on her soul. Which sends him into a Heroic BSOD afterwards. A major key in the events leading up to the climax is Chrono learning to control his rage.\n\nPrincess Tutu has an example of this trope, but not in with the character you'd expect. Is it Fakir, who prides himself on being the Knight? Nope. Is it Mytho, the heroic Prince from a fairytale? Not him, either. It's actually Autor‚Äîa nerdy, Drosselmeyer-obsessed scholar. When Fakir's hands are nearly cut-off by the Bookman trying to stop the story, Autor flies into a rage and defeats the axe-wielding man using only his bare hands. Not nearly as impressive as some of the other examples on this page, and it only appears briefly, but it's still surprising considering the sort of character he's portrayed as.\n\nIn Mai-HiME, this happens to Mai, of all people, when Mikoto (accidentally) ends Takumi's life under the influence of her own Unstoppable Rage. She grits her teeth so hard that blood starts to form, and summons her CHILD to attack. Mikoto gets better... but not in the way Mai expected. PROTIP: Never anger a girl with an enormous pet dragon.\n\nIn Hellsing, Zorin Blitz kills Pip as he tries to carry a blinded and severely wounded Seras to safety. He requests for Seras to drink his blood so \"they can defeat them together\" just before he dies. Filled with intense sadness which quickly becomes rage, Seras fulfills his last wish and her true vampiric abilites awaken. She then proceeds to go batshit insane and slaughters Zorin's mooks, and finally grinds Zorin's head on the wall like a cheese grater.\n\nAlso during the Valentine Brothers attack on the Headquarters.\n\nAlexander Anderson from the series seems to fit this trope as well when he is in combat, typically demonstrating nothing but sheer joy at the prospect of battle. He attacks Integra, a high ranking British official who didn't even want to start a fight, head on, killing her bodyguards and decapitating one of them before threatening to paint to walls with her blood. He runs into gunfire without even trying to dodge and due to his augmentations is able to slaughter hundreds of undead mooks without any difficulty. In the TV version, at one point he gets both of his arms shot off. He simply kneels to the ground and grabs his knife with his teeth, and then proceeds to run at his opponent with it while he's still being shot at.\n\nSubverted? In a Sh≈çnen manga anime? Unnatural! But in Shaman King, rage clouds your mind, and causes you to squander your energy. It's specifically considered something to be avoided.\n\nDemonstrated quite well in the Yoh vs. Faust VIII fight. Faust taunts and enrages Yoh from the start of the fight by harming Manta, and when Yoh is on his last legs, his last-ditch strategy is to punch Faust's Berserk Button as hard as he can. And it probably would have worked if Yoh had had just a little more furyoku to spare.\n\nIn Gintama: Not exactly conscious rage, per se, but it is brought about by rage. In her fight against Abuto, Kagura loses all control against her Yato instinct and flies into what can be fairly called an Unstoppable Rage - though the look on her face says she's actually enjoying it in a detatched, psychotic way.\n\nBusou Renkin has a good chunk of rage, with a Victorized Kazuki duking it out with Victor. There's also Tokiko, who pumps rage through her veins instead of blood.\n\nIn Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann Simon flies into one in the middle of taking over the Dai-Gunzan when Kamina appears to have died. He then releases so much Spiral Energy that the whole ship starts to glow, blows all the Mooks out of the ship, and he sets off a nearby volcano. It took a whalloping from Kamina to get him out of it.\n\nFull Metal Panic!: In episode 5, Sagara and Tsubaki really piss off the school janitor, who transforms in to a chainsaw-wielding monstrosity that easily fends off their combined attacks, swallows hand grenades, and chases them around the school like puppies.\n\nHamel in Violinist of Hameln, when he transforms into a monster.\n\nOne Piece. Pressing any of the Straw Hats' Berserk Buttons will inevitably lead to this.\n\nDo not anger Luffy enough to make him take off his hat. God help you if you make Luffy take off his hat. How can you do this? Insult anyone's dreams, hurt his friends, mock anything to do with a pirate's pride, threaten anyone close to him...\n\nAnd if you want to make it several billion times worse, if you step on Luffy's hat or do anything to damage it, 2 steps will follow:\n\nExemplified in One Piece Film Strong World, where the Big Bad manages to get Luffy the angriest he's been in a long time.\n\nTo put it in perspective, the character Luffy said that to had spent over twenty years developing his plan, and it was so far along that the only way it could fail is if he happened to blab too many of his secrets to someone who would oppose it, allow that someone to discover the remaining secrets, bring that someone to his home base, and refrain from killing that someone when he had the chance. But even if a someone was armed with all that, they would need to have an absurd amount of power to stop him. And who does he do that to except for the Straw Hat Pirates? And he made it infinitely worse by kidnapping their navigator ‚Äî whose meteorology skills are unrivaled in that world ‚Äî in order to remove the only possible threat to his plan. He learned the hard way that the unpredictable cyclones of the Grand Line were nothing when compared to the Straw Hats' Unstoppable Rage.\n\nTell Sanji that his chivalry is na√Øve, that he can't protect anyone, mock his status as a chef, waste food or insult a beautiful lady in his presence. For maximum effect, do all of the above at the same time.\n\nAlthough this could also go under Tranquil Fury, there's also Whitebeard in the War of the Best, where after everyone witnesses Ace's death and despite sustaining heavy injuries from being shot, stabbed, slashed, burned and having half his face melted off, he defeats Akainu in 2 hits, the second hit destroying most of Marineford and separating the pirates and Marines with a giant chasm. In short, never, ever piss the old man off.\n\nRecap of the past few Big Bads. Number 1: Arlong. Killed Nami's mother and enslaved her and her home island. Promised to free them if Nami paid him a hefty amount of money. Utilized Loophole Abuse to ensure she doesn't get the amount after eight years of hard, hard work. Mocked her and provoked her entire village to attack him in what would inevitably be a Curb Stomp Battle with everyone she loved ending up dead. The culmination of this? Nami bursts into tears, and asks Luffy for help. He and his other three cremates march off to Arlong Park, and a couple of hours later, Arlong is unconscious and half-dead beneath the rubble of what used to be his base, and all of his henchmen aren't much better off.\n\nRoberta from Black Lagoon normally spends her days as a bad maid, but if you kidnap or kill her masters, she will hunt you down through single photographs and kill you. You have a slight chance of surviving if you are a member of the Green Berets, otherwise you are dead.\n\nShortly after Kiyomaro of Zatch Bell comes Back from the Dead and completely wipes the floor with his opponents, one of them taunts Kiyomaro with mention of his fallen allies and receives an epic beating with epic use of Demon Head on Kiyomaro's part.\n\nRyoma from New Getter Robo flies into a berserker rage near the end of the series, after absorbing an enormous amount of Getter Energy. The character was already known as \"Batshit Ryoma\" among fans due to his crazy expressions and Determinator status, so the idea of him having an \"Unstoppable Rage\" mode distinguishable from his regular personality seemed impossible. They found a way [1].\n\nMiu gets this when she finds her friends badly beaten by Shou Kanou during the D of D arc in Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple. How does Kenichi snap her out of it? By groping her chest. Which was apparently a technique that Ma Kensei taught him.\n\nBado from DOGS Bullets and Carnage} goes into Unstoppable Rage whenever he has a nicotine fit and can't find cigarettes.\n\nNegi Springfield of Mahou Sensei Negima goes into one of these when he finally meets the demon who petrified his home town on that snowy day. Actually a subversion, since he almost meets the same fate. It's only after collecting himself that he mixes it with Dissonant Serenity and starts kicking ass.\n\nIt happens again when Kurt Godel starts taunting Negi about his past. The fact that Kurt claims to be responsible for Negi's Doomed Hometown, combined with the fact that Negi's Black Magic is starting to get out of his control means that bad things are starting to happen.\n\nYue and Beatrice don't take it well when one of the demons erases Emily.\n\nBleach:\n\nIn the earlier parts of the manga, pushing Ichigo too far was an invitation for his Inner Hollow to come out and play. Eventually, he's driven into an unstoppable form of pure instinct as a result of Orihime being left vulnerable to Ulquiorra. This results in both Ulquiorra and Ishida (who tries to calm Ichigo down) to take the full brunt of Ichigo's state.\n\nWhen Captain Aizen appears to have been murdered, it's Hinamori who finds the body. Convinced the grinning Gin is the culprit she flies into an Unstoppable Rage, causing one of her best friends, Kira (Gin's Number Two) to step in to defend his captain. Even then, Hinamori won't stop, calm down or see reason and it takes the intervention of another captain to get the situation back under control (by arresting both Hinamori and Kira).\n\nOmamori Himari: Himari has one of the Heroic BSOD variety Yuuto appears to have been killed by her opponent. It's also her Crowning Moment of Awesome.\n\nWolfs Rain - Toboe + Walrus = Crowning Moment of Awesome.\n\nEdward in Fullmetal Alchemist goes into one of these when he finds that Shou Tucker, an alchemist famous for making chimeras, turned his own wife into one, and then later turned his daughter and his dog into one. Shou makes it worse however, by provoking Edward about the use of human lives, and saying that they aren't so different, leading Edward to continually scream \"YOU'RE WRONG!\", whilst punching him repeatedly. Ouch.\n\nWhen Al sacrifices himself to give Ed his arm back, Ed goes berserk on Father Homunculus ...and HOW.\n\nAl almost does this too.\n\nRiza also goes into Unstoppable Rage when she thinks Lust managed to kill Mustang, and promptly empties her gun's magazine into her, reloads and repeats. Several times. Worth noting because it is a subversion rather than a straight portrayal, as when she's run out of bullets, she collapses and cries, while Lust gets back up after shrugging off the barrage without breaking a sweat.\n\nWhen Mustang finally finds out that Envy killed Hughes.\n\nRoy Mustang: \"That's that... you killed Hughes..... that's all I needed to know... You don't need to say anything more, Envy. The first thing I'm gonna turn to ash is your tongue.\"\n\n‚ÄîHe makes damn good on this promise, He then proceeds to alternate between full, body-consuming explosions, and pinpoint attacks that target the most sensitive and painful areas, notably the eyes. Repeatedly. OUCH!\n\nNotably averted, however, with the Homunculus Wrath. Despite being a ruthless fighter, he is always calm and composed in a fight.\n\nFather as well in the Final Battle he shows much anger\n\nIn the first part of \"Jupiter Jazz\" from Cowboy Bebop, a gang leader made the mistake of calling Spike Spiegel by the name of his rival, Vicious. Spike went berserk and handed a supreme asskicking to the entire gang before laying into him.\n\nIt's never wise to threaten/try to kill Yukiteru in front of Yuno in Mirai Nikki; this chick put the yan (sick) in Yandere.\n\nOne: Do not mess with Senri's friends. Two: Do not remove Senri's eyepatch. Three: When white hair appears on his forehead (after you have ignored number two), you run away as quickly as possible, through that really isn't going to help, you're going to be clawed to bits anyway. Even if +Anima is a childen's manga, it doesn't skimp on the violence when neccessary.\n\nYou get to see Senri go into an Unstoppable Rage two times. Once while he is a young child, and the other time he's in Moss Mountain with Cooro, Nana, and Husky.\n\nIn Death Note, Touta Matsuda has an awesome moment in the final episode in which he Took a Level in Badass for some and was Rescued from the Scrappy Heap for others. When Light Yagami is exposed as Kira, Matsuda slumps to the floor under the weight of it all, but springs into action faster than anyone else when Light attempts to escape by murdering everyone with the Death Note piece in his watch. Matsuda then shoots him in the hand, with the most ultimate Manly Tears coming down as he calls Light out on leading his father (and Matsuda's Obi Wan) to slaughter for nothing. When Light tries to convince Matsuda that the only way to make Soichiro's justice worth it is to save Light and kill the SPK and investigation team, he's only more enraged, and snaps when Light once again tries to write names in the note fragment with his own blood. He shoots him multiple times, and tries to finish him off with a shot to the head, but is held back by the other members of the investigation team. Coupled with the fact that he was the only member of the team to have any doubts about whether Kira really was evil, Matsuda's Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass moment is even more impressive.\n\nKatekyo Hitman Reborn: Averted when the berserk rage is only powerful for five minutes and it is in itself not unbeatable. Tsuna is at his best when he is on the other side, straight past normal, straight past calm, all the way onto the other side where he is completely empty of feeling and is thus at his most level of head. Results in loads of arse kicking. But... there comes the time when he just has to lose it for a moment, and that's when he kinda hit Byakuran with an X-burner so hard that Byakuran vaporized. Scary...\n\nThe otherwise peaceful and docile Ohmu of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind fly into an Unstoppable Rage if the Sea of Decay or any of its insects are harmed, killing and destroying everything in their path in an attempt to claim vengeance against whatever is responsible. In the manga, we're privy to their thoughts through Nausicaa's empathic link with them, and they seem to regret their actions once they regain their senses.\n\nNausicaa herself flies into a rage and annihilates a roomful of trained soldiers with just a staff.\n\nEngland of Axis Powers Hetalia flies into one of these during the War of American Independence. Despite America's formidable Super Strength and the fact that England doesn't seem to have any backup, he still manages to disarm America and level a musket point-blank at his face. Unstoppable Rage, indeed... which, for worse, is followed with a Crowning Moment Of Heartbreaking once England realizes what happened and breaks in tears.\n\nThe Nodos in Heroic Age are Nigh Invulnerable Kaiju possessed of incredible destructive power to begin with, but under certain circumstances (such as when more than two at a time are engaged in a fight) they can go into \"frenzy\" (or \"madness\" or \"mental chaos\", depending on the translation), becoming even more monstrous and destructive. The Heroic Tribe apparently destroyed several entire star systems through such rages during their civil war, hence why the Golden Tribe sealed the survivors within members of other tribes, making them slaves to these \"lesser\" beings.\n\nIvan Isaac's superpower in Priest is his sheer rage and contempt for Temozarela. He doesn't even care whether or not he wins against him, he just wants Temozarela to see how angry he is.\n\nShizuo Heiwajima in Durarara!!. He actually doesn't like violence, but set him off‚Äîand many things set him off‚Äîand he can't stop himself from throwing something unreasonably heavy at you.\n\nIn episode 11 of the Tenchi Muyo Spin-Off Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari the antagonists' latest and dirtiest attempt to kill Kenshi pisses him off so much that he goes utterly apeshit. His Seikijin partially transforms into a horrible black giant thing that mercilessly beats down his opponents and actually kills one of them (the one that came up with the scheme in the first place). It's so terrifying that Dagmyer has a Freak-Out that segues into a two episode long Villainous BSOD. This is a subversion‚ÄîKenshi's rage overloads the Seikijin even faster than normal and causes it to fall apart midway through the battle. This is the only reason Emera was able to rescue Dagmyer.\n\nIn Bakugan Battle Brawlers, never let Ditzy Hybrid Monster Rabeeder overhear that her sister is defeated or possibly dead. The ditz who hit on the main character and challenged you to silly races before might only give you a single death's glare warning before beating the ever loving tar out of The Dragon, that dragon's Dragon, and their little dog, too!\n\nHajime no Ippo: Don't make Takeshi Sendo angry while in the ring. You'll live longer. Shigeta and Ippo both have been victims of his flip-outs. It's not a nice situation to be in, really.\n\nIn his fight against Bryan Hawk, in the moment that is beyond doubt the CMOA of CMOAs, Takamura goes into a state of pure, uncontrolled rage (while half-unconcious to boot) and proceeds to beat the flying shit out of Hawk. It's so unbelievably awesome that words cannot capture the moment.\n\nIn a recent Soul Eater, after spending 800 years waiting, having his boss and partner killed, and going so far as to grow a second, back up body, Giriko is all sorts of insane with rage. Unfortunately, he's built up so much rage that he overloads his soul. He rages so hard his soul explodes and he dies.,Then The new Noah appered representing Wrath and is the idol of Rage seriously.\n\nSorcerer Hunters protagonist Carrot Glace suffers a unique combination of conditions. His body naturally absorbs any spell that hits him, and the energy from that spell transforms him into some nigh-unstoppable beast. The only two people who seem consistently able to snap him out of it are his coworkers and the two girls he normally avoids whenever he can: the Misu sisters, Chocolate and Tira.\n\nAfter spending almost the entire second season as nothing but a hostage, Kojuro of Sengoku Basara escapes, and finds out that Hanbei, the jerk who had constantly tried to convince him that Masamune was dead, gave his lord a scar across his back. He is less than pleased about this. He promptly rides off without a sword , finds Hanbei's unit, and proceed's to beat all of the mooks bare handed. He then steals a sword, and goes berserk on Hanbei himself. His definite CMoA. This is Mitsunari's raison d'etre. Whoever may be on the receiving end of his anger, nothing is gonna get in his way until he hunts them down and chops them into mush.\n\nIn an episode of Halo Legends, Harka has the wife of Fal 'Chavamee, the original Arbiter, killed to provoke him into a duel after he refuses to serve the Covenant. Fal wipes out an elite hit-squad, hundreds of Covenant infantry, a Wraith and three gigantic Hunters before dying along with Harka in the eponymous duel.\n\nIf you kill one of Yuna's friends, she won't care how much of a Badass Villain Sue you are. She will tear you to shreads.\n\nIn the second series of Beyblade, Kai has a major guilt-induced Heroic BSOD while fighting Goki, because Goki's Mind Control Eyes reminds him of Wyatt, who is dead/insane depending on the version and it was Kai's fault. (\"I can't fight you. Not you.\") He snaps out of it on his own, but still isn't strong enough to take down uber!Cyber Dranzer. Then Goki refers to Wyatt as \"your wimpy little friend\" and, well. Dranzer hits Battle Aura and the title trope ensues.\n\nDon't mess with any Fairy Tail members.\n\nIn Trigun, Vash is normally a pacifist who refuses to kill anyone, trying his very best to non-lethally shoot at people (unrealistic, but for the context of the story one just has to roll with it) which puts him in bad situations with the major villains of the series who don't go down as easily as a normal person would from his non-lethal shots. On one notable occasion, the villain was unaffected by Vash's attempts to non-lethally defeat him but when he murdered a lot of people right in front of Vash's eyes Vash pulls out his machine gun arm and quickly immobilizes the villain. In his weakened state, Vash knows the villain can't fight back but in his rage he seriously considers killing him. However, he holds true to his morals and lets him go. This shows you that Vash would be an unstoppable gunfighter if he went in for the kill from the start.\n\nIn the Mega Man NT Warrior manga, Megaman's Super Mode starts out as this until he learns to control it. Another example comes a few chapters later when Shademan threatens Lan. Megaman rips him apart.\n\nIn Vinland Saga Canute has a divine revelation that transforms him from a frightened sissy into an incredibly charismatic and powerful leader. And the very first thing he does is to calm down a raging berserker four times the size, that is about to crush him, with a Cooldown Hug. After that, he only has to look at people to make them worship him.\n\nIn Blue Exorcist, Rin has some... problems with restraint once he draws his sword to transform into his demonic form. This was especially visible in his fight against Amaimon in the anime as he started off as a bit angrier version of himself but ended up as a snarling and growling bundle of Ax Crazy, behaving more like a feral dog than a human. Right in front of his Nakama who up until that point thought he was a Badass Normal and definitely not the son of Satan himself. Good thing Shiemi was on-hand for a Cooldown Hug, otherwise it would've gotten real ugly real quick.\n\nComic Books\n\nThe Incredible Hulk in every incarnation and medium.\n\nIn Marvel's World War Hulk storyline, he's busy with a particularly Unstoppable Rage, mopping the floor with everyone in his way. The truly frightening thing was that he had gone into Tranquil Fury at the same time, leaving him with enough mind to keep his head and employ strategy and trickery.\n\nThis is also one of Wolverine's defining traits. He's usually composed and calculating when he fights, but when he's pushed beyond a breaking point, he gives in to his animal instincts and his fighting style becomes more erratic and feral, and it's usually in these occasions where his body count rises the most.\n\nIf Hulk weren't the poster boy for this trope, the Red Lantern Corps in Green Lantern would be. Their rings are powered by their rage, which is strong enough to the point where all but their leader are mindless berserkers.\n\nIn the Hush storyline, Batman goes into one of these when it seems that The Joker killed his childhood friends. Flashing back through all the people the Joker's victimized and killed over the years (mostly Barbara Gordon, Jason Todd, and Sarah Essen), he goes into an Unstoppable Rage, taking down Harley Quinn and Catwoman (the latter of which was on his side, but simply trying to stop him from killing the Joker), and stalking the Joker through an alley. It takes Jim Gordon to snap him out of it, and, even then, Gordon had to shoot him to get his attention. Even after getting shot, Batman's still thinking of all the different ways he could kill Joker (something along the lines of \"pushing his skeleton through his mouth\"), but at least he wasn't choking him any more.\n\nIn Superman/Batman #1, Batman finds himself witnessing a similar situation between Superman and Lex Luthor. He notes the similarities between this and what happened in Hush, and then, instead of talking him down like Jim Gordon did (he even notes that he wouldn't do that), he notes to Superman that he could make Luthor's death look like an accident, and then he gets Superman to stop by directing his attention to something else that needs to be done that's more important.\n\nIn the film adaptation, Superman/Batman: Public Enemies, Supes goes even further when Batman, instead of Captain Atom as was the case in the comics, attempts a Heroic Sacrifice by manually piloting Toyman's rocket to destroy the asteroid. He then gives Luthor the beatdown of his life and only stops fuming when he learns there's a chance Batman is still alive.\n\nOther triggers include trying to kill Nightwing, having killed Robin, making him relive Robin's death... If you do any of the above, you'd better hope someone is there to stop him.\n\nSimilarly, Nightwing flies off the handle and kills Joker (Batman revived him, mostly because his proteges have no business becoming murderers) when he believes Joker has killed Robin III and Joker has also taunted him about killing Robin II (Jason Todd).\n\nHuntress, in her Secret Identity, is a teacher. She doesn't take well to people threatening her students.\n\nTends to happen to Spider-Man whenever the important things in his life, especially his family, are threatened (although this isn't an explicit power of his).\n\nThe most famous of these was when Gwen Stacy was killed. He very nearly killed the Green Goblin with his bare hands.\n\nAnother example happened during the \"Back In Black\" story arc following Civil War. Aunt May lay dying after taking a sniper's bullet meant for Spider-Man. Donning his black costume, Spider-Man tracked down the man responsible, The Kingpin (who was serving prison time at that point), broke into the prison, confronted The Kingpin and then proceeded to give him a very savage beatdown. No jokes, No quips. He ends it by threatening to fill Kingpin's throat with enough webbing to kill him if he ever comes for Spider-Man again.\n\nSpidey is a nice guy even for a superhero, but when he goes off, you better be damn sure you aren't standing in his way.\n\nSuperman is normally one of the nicest guys on the planet (despite what some people may have to say), but he's a terror when he's pushed.\n\nIn For the Man Who Has Everything, Superman loses it on Mongul after waking-up from a Lotus Eater Machine, but his innate morality prevents him from actually killing Mongul off.\n\nIn the Elseworlds story Kingdom Come, Superman enters into an Unstoppable Rage when most of the metahumans are killed by a UN-launched nuclear warhead and nearly tears down the United Nations.\n\nIssue 6 of Final Crisis, after Batman's death. A quite frankly shit-scary Superman, roaring with grief and his eyes on fire, tears through the battle to recover the body.\n\nJLA-Avengers. Superman becomes so outraged while fighting The Mighty Thor, he knocks him out while even lampshading \"Up to Eleven\".\n\nThis is followed by another crowning moment of awesome when the combined Marvel heroes, upon seeing Thor taken down flip out and all attack Supes, managing to actually keep him off balance for a short time.\n\nThe Punisher, despite being something of an unstoppable killing machine, is typically a very calm, methodical man. That is until Nicky Cavella, a mob boss with a grudge, dug up his family's remains and urinated on them. This did not go down well. A pissed off Mr. Castle proceeded to pack up his M-249 and consecutively attack various criminal hideouts, racking up 68 bodies... in one night.\n\nIt was so bad that he wasn't even really aware of what he was doing each time until the recoil from his gun kicked in. He was in a sort of perpetual hallucination until his family was returned to their grave.\n\nThe final arc from the Star FOX comic run in Nintendo Power had Fox McCloud going berserk upon learning that Andross was responsible both for his mother's death (a car-bomb meant for his father) and his father's disappearance in the Black Hole (because Andross sabotaged his ship). He proceeds to sport Glowing Eyes of Doom and tear the bad guys apart before going after Andross in person, but in a rare moment of not getting in the last shot like he usually does in battles, he allows Andross to escape into the Black Hole because he knows his father is going to find him and \"he deserves the last shot after all these years.\"\n\nSleepwalker had plenty of reason to be angry at his archenemy Cobweb in the final issue of his comic series, not least because Cobweb tricked Sleepwalker into furthering his plans to conquer Earth, and because he committed mass murder on Earth and pinned the whole thing on Sleepwalker. Throwing aside Cobweb's minions like they were nothing, Sleepwalker catches up to Cobweb and proceeds to rip his MacGuffin right out of Cobweb's body, before using it to banish Cobweb once and for all.\n\nA possible variation on this is Rorschach from Watchmen. He begins as a relatively capable hero, holding his own alongside Nite Owl. Following the murder of Blair Roche, Rorschach simply goes insane, and removes all traces of mercy from his actions in his blind hatred towards the \"evil ones,\" rendering him strong enough to scare the shit out of most of New York without any weapons.\n\nIn the Disney Ducks Comic Universe Scrooge McDuck has many famous Comic book iterations of this, but none quite as amazingly awesome as these three pages. A 45 Kg Duck destroying a riverboat with his bare hands, and a concert piano.\n\nTycho Celchu in the X Wing Series, at least in the comics - in the novels, Isard apparently managed to neatly excise his ability to be angry - gets mad and starts swinging very easily.\n\nColossus, normally the Gentle Giant of X-Men, is also one of the last people you ever want to get mad. Just ask Riptide. Just ask Ord from Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men run! Trust me, imprisoning and torturing him for two years to create a \"mutant cure?\" Very bad idea.\n\nWulf in Strontium Dog, being a Viking, becomes a literal berserker when he gets really mad. In this state, he's capable of beating up even Johnny.\n\nRaghnarok, a french comic about a young dragon features this. When Raghnarok (the young dragon) disappears, and his mother can't find him, she gets increasingly violent as time goes by and her eyes turn red. Over time, her purple scales turn black and she goes from being perhaps 12 feet tall to dwarfing skyscrapers. She then goes on to violently wreck everything in her way while shouting her sons name. This goes on uninterrupted for ten years, and she has the entire world fearing her. All armies run at sight. Her anger is only quelled once she meets her son again- and it's notable that she is a lot smaller after stopping her rampage.\n\nSupergirl was once so angry she overloaded Sakki, The Hate Furnace and Gakidou.\n\nAlso, Supergirl during her mini-series discovered that her lover Lex Luthor had made thousands of clones of her from the residue he collected after her fight with Doomsday. She was very close to killing him too.\n\nIn Archie Comics Sonic the Hedgehog , the eponymous character suffers this at times despite his calm and carefree nature, particularly when his family and friends are in danger.\n\nIn the \"EndGame\" arc (issues #47-#50) when Knothole Village was seemingly destroyed by Robotnik's doomsday weapon (but in the end learns that it was trapped in another timezone for a short time).\n\nLikewise in the same arc, a character named Hershey the Cat pummeled her ex-boyfriend Drago Wolf to a pulp after learning that he tricked her into killing Princess Sally (the princess herself survived, however).\n\nKnothole was recently destroyed (for real, this time) by Eggman's air fleet, angering Sonic. It wasn't until he was taunted about the limit of his abilities when Sonic snapped and launched a devastating, but failed, Sonic Boom attack on Eggman's most powerful robot.\n\nTo paint a better picture, after the taunt mentioned above, Sonic ran off and in a few seconds was on the other side of the continent before turning around and making a beeline toward Eggman's robot. It was one of the more impressive things Sonic has done, short of being Super Sonic.\n\nTails, at one point, fought Sonic because he was tired of being treated as a little kid, but mainly because Sonic at one time had dated his friend's love interest, Fiona Fox. Tails was heartbroken that Fiona never loved him because of age difference, and instead loved Sonic. He was even more devastated because she was really in love with Sonic's evil twin, Scourge. He eventually went all out on Sonic while trying to rescue his dad. After Sonic learned that his friend's rage came from that fact that he took Fiona away from him, he apologized and explained his actions, and they soon made up.\n\nMighty is also prone to these when something bad happens to Ray the Flying Squirrel. The results are never pretty.\n\nThe Hard Goodbye from the Sin City series features Marv going on on for about a week straight, eventually taking on one of the most powerful crime families in the country. This was all because they killed one of the few people that was nice to him.\n\nFor Wonder Woman and other Amazons in their pre-Crisis incarnations, the Bracelets of Submission acted as a check against the use of unrestrained power. If Wonder Woman's bracelets were removed, she became intoxicated with power, violent and nearly unstoppable.\n\nIn Runaways, during the \"Home Schooling\" arc, a missile strikes the team's Malibu house, killing Old Lace and injuring Klara. Upon regaining consciousness, Klara freaks out and causes a forest of vines to grow and consume the house.\n\nSimilar to the Wonder Woman example above, Orion from the New Gods has a intense, building rage inside him that's held back by a Mother Box. The reason for this is that his father is Darkseid, and the burning hatred for all living things is In the Blood.\n\nFan Works\n\nKyon: Big Damn Hero. If you do anything to harm the SOS Brigade, Kyon - or if you hurt him, Haruhi - will lose it and you will suffer.\n\nAn example shows up in the Mass Effect Self-Insert Fic Mass Vexations. Author Avatar Art flies into one after Shepard tells him to radio Joker in the Virmire mission. The only thing he remembers after radioing Joker? Blurs, falling geth, and someone pulling him away from the scene.\n\nIn the Firefly fic Forward, Jayne flies into one of these when River takes a bullet for him during the assault by Niska's goons. It is described as Jayne \"seeing red.\" Jayne periodically has these moments throughout the story, when his anger overrides good sense. Later on, River goes into one of these rages when a Hand of Blue shoots Simon, and in the resulting scene reduces his face to hamburger by repeatedly stabbing it in a hysterical, savage frenzy.\n\nLogan Wright from Dalton has some rather serious anger issues, causing him to violently lash out at virtually everyone on a semi-regular basis.\n\nBlaze from The Legend of Spyro: A New Dawn enters this when the curse preventing him from helping his daughter fight the Warden is broken. He shoots the Warden a Death Glare, plows straight through everything between him and his target (including the cage he was in and a mob of Gargoyles), and sends the Warden flying clear across the room twice in a row. He then leads the former slaves and his daughter in a No-Holds-Barred Beatdown on the Warden, ending it by blasting the Warden through a wall. Do not mess with Blaze's daughter!\n\nA Hero gives us Dalek Sec, who's like this. All the time. Considering the general disposition of his species, this is actually an improvement.\n\nSleepwalker will explode into this trope when confronted with his Arch Enemy Cobweb, who trapped him on Earth, or his Evil Counterpart Psyko, who murdered the parents of his Heroic Host Rick Sheridan. Sleepwalker's anger typically pushes him beyond his normal limits when dealing with Psyko, although even then the result is a bloodbath from which Sleepwalker typically emerges more dead than alive. An unusual twist on this trope is that Cobweb has also played on Sleepwalker's anger to manipulate him into losing focus and making bad decisions that would get him killed...at least until Rick serves as a Spanner in the Works and sets Sleepy straight.\n\nPterosaurs are not Dinosaurs. Adam Squall is a pterosaur. He flies into one of these whenever somebody calls him one.\n\nIn Ace Combat: The Equestrian War, when Night Raven tells Fluttershy he fights and kills the ponies not because he hates them, but because he sees it as \"fun\", she becomes furious.\n\nFilm\n\nThe Blind Side: Michael, normally a Gentle Giant, gets his Berserk Button hit and hulks out when a drug dealer makes sexual comments about Leigh Anne and Collins.\n\nIn Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Big Chris, for all his ruthless coercion and threatening demeanor, is rather a reasonable chap . . . until a man takes his son prisoner. He goes full Papa Wolf on the man, smashing his head repeatedly in a car door while roaring incoherently.\n\nStar Wars:\n\nLuke Skywalker spends most of the original trilogy actively not giving into anger, because that leads to The Dark Side, but when Darth Vader makes the mistake of attempting to threaten to do something terrible to Leia, he immediately goes berserk, interrupts Vader's sentence, and beats Vader on sheer, Force-augmenting aggression (despite being a full foot shorter and with the corresponding reach disadvantage), only stopping after he chops off Vader's mechanical hand and realizes just how close he just came to becoming like him.\n\nIt runs in the family: when Anakin completely destroys a village of Sand People after they killed his mother.\n\nThe final Luke-Vader duel would be the Ur Example of sometimes-Force-enhanced psychological warfare gone wrong. Although, sometimes spurring someone into this (particularly with repressed anger) was actually the intended effect; Palpatine had actually been attempting this on Luke right before and after the duel... but his obviousness of intent probably helped Luke pull himself back from the brink.\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi after Darth Maul mortally wounds Qui-Gon Jinn.\n\nSubversion: In Mystery Men, Ben Stiller's character Mr. Furious was a superhero seemingly built around Unstoppable Rage - except that when he raged, he wasn't much less stoppable than a \"normal\" adrenaline-fueled angry person. He didn't become substantially stronger, tougher or faster, which wasn't very useful. During the final battle, however, his rage apparently gave him enough momentum to overcome the Big Bad. In fact, it is implied that his \"rage\" had really been an act until that point.\n\nLancelot in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\n\nThis is a trait of the character in the original legends.\n\nOddly enough, in both Goodfellas and Casino, Joe Pesci seems to have a dangerously psychotic Unstoppable Rage that goes off from something as simple as a misunderstood compliment.\n\nActually averted in Pesci's famous \"You think I'm funny?\" scene from Goodfellas. He's just screwing around with Henry Hill. What he does to Billy Bats and Spider, on the other hand...\n\nEquilibrium's John Preston goes into a Tranquil Fury version of this after DuPont spends a moment to gloat about how Preston played right into his hands. No one survives the resultant Gun Kata asskicking spree.\n\n\"No. Not without incident...\" Good times.\n\nIn Serenity, River Tam is rendered catatonic and helpless by the madness of the Reavers pushing in on her mind during the final battle, until her brother gets shot. Ass-kicking results.\n\nThe name in the Latin American dubbing is Serenity: Unstoppable Rage.\n\nReavers are like this ALL THE TIME.\n\nStraw Dogs has this in it.\n\nGodzilla destroys cities because he's angry.\n\nIn Three Hundred, the Captain flies into such a rage when he sees his son Astinos get his head chopped off on the battlefield during a lull in the action. A decent amount of single-handed ass-kicking ensues, until three of his fellow Spartans have to physically restrain him and drag him back to their camp.\n\nThis is even more Badass when his screams are carried all the way to the Persian camp, and scares them more than the deepest battledrums.\n\nThe 3rd act of the Jackie Chan film Police Story features a rare look at Jackie's typical happy go lucky character snapping and going to town on everyone that's done him wrong. This includes beating the crap out of people who can't fight worth a damn like a doctor and a lawyer, but they've all been such huge jerks through the whole film that we're cheering him on every step of the way.\n\nFrench & Indian War veteran Benjamin Martin is fueled with unstoppable rage when his second-oldest son is shot point blank by the evil British Cavalry officer Col. Tavington in The Patriot. With minimal help from his two pint-sized sons, Ben brutally takes down a contingent of British Redcoats, not satisfied with making them dead but burning through all of that rage by hacking at one soldier's bloody corpse.\n\nIn the film adaptation of Legends of the Fall, Brad Pitt's character Tristan Ludlow goes on an Unstoppable Rage-fueled Roaring Rampage of Revenge after he watches his younger brother die on a WWI battlefield from machine gun fire and mustard gas. He not only slaughters every German in the vicinity but arrives back at field camp the next morning wearing warpaint of mud and blood and strings of fresh German scalps.\n\nIn Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Optimus Prime fights Megatron, Starscream and Grindor by himself and is eventually overpowered and blasted halfway across a forest area. After Megatron tries to justify his means for wanting to kill Sam, Optimus denies his reasoning, charges right into the midst of them, slices off Grindor's arm, beats down Megatron, slices off Starscream's arm (and whacks him across the face with it) then leaps onto Grindor and tears his face in two, killing him. Crowning Moment of Awesome.\n\nIn DOTM, Optimus might as well be fueled by Unstoppable Rage.\n\nSpider-Man flies into a fit of rage anytime his loved ones are threatened or harmed, usually resulting in beatdown for the villains.\n\nIn the first film Green Goblin taunts that after finishing him in their fight, he will kill Mary Jane, whilst making her death 'nice and slow', Spider-Man quickly recovers and beats the crap out of him.\n\nAfter kidnapping Mary Jane in the second film, Dr. Octopus rather smugly refuses to give up her location and Spidey attacks him in retaliation.\n\nThis happens several times in Spider-Man 3, once where he confronts and almost kills the Sandman for killing his uncle, the next where he thrashes Harry Osborn in his own home for ruining his life with Mary Jane, the next where Harry takes a blow (two spikes attached to his board) from Venom meant for Peter and is killed because of it.\n\nRalphie, in A Christmas Story. After getting a C+ on his \"What I Want For Christmas\" essay, and feeling really despondent, neighborhood bully Scot Farkus pelts him in the face with a snowball. After verbally taunting Ralphie, Ralphie snaps and beats the everloving crap out of him, while other neighborhood kids look on, reducing Farkus to a sobbing, miserable wreck.\n\nDistrict 9: Wikus in the final battle.\n\nKham in Tom Yum Goong (aka The Protector). After discovering that his elephant had been butchered and the bones set with gold and jewels, he goes into serious Heroic BSOD mode. He doesn't notice the horde of thugs beating on him until one makes the mistake of stabbing him in the side. This snaps him out of his grief and turns his BSOD into a Roaring Rampage of Revenge.\n\nThe titular character from The Iron Giant when he's threatened.\n\nExplicitly stated to be part of his programming, that has absolutely nothing to do with rage and he has no conscious control over it initially. To be clear, he resists with his little friend's help and runs away, but when the attacks persist and his friend appears to be dead, the giant emotes some very clear rage and engages his attack-response programming\n\nThe Fugitive: Richard Kimble displays this upon finally encountering the man who murdered his wife, and upon confronting his so-called friend who set the murder plot in motion.\n\nWhen a Psi-Cop attempts to shut down Juri Arisugawa's mind in a late installment of The Symphony of the Sword from Undocumented Features, the cool, elegant fencer instead explodes into unstoppable berserk frenzy that the Psi-Cop cannot even begin to control.\n\nLiterature\n\nOlder Than Feudalism. After Patroclus' death in The Iliad, Achilles cuts a bloody path through the Trojan forces and doesn't stop for a couple more books. It's implied he was able to do this before, but now he's really mad. Actually, the whole epic is dedicated to 'menin', wrath. The opening line and invocation is:\n\nHonor Harrington goes on several during the course of the novels, usually when someone she cares about is set upon by goons. Additionally, the entire Grayson Navy goes on one when Haven attacks Basilisk station again, as they believe that their most beloved Steadholder has been murdered by the Peeps. \"Admiral Yanakov to all Grayson units,\" it said, and White Haven could almost hear the clangor of clashing swords in its depths. \"The order is--Lady Harrington, and no mercy!\"[1]\n\nIn Mission of Honor this is what Mike Henke has Baroness Medusa and her staff do to Admiral Crandall.\n\nCommander Vimes in the Discworld novels has occasional moments of unstoppable rage, most notable when fighting the dwarfs in Thud!, where \"the Beast\" that takes over at such moments is augumented by an evil psychic force. Being Samuel Vimes of the Night Watch, his sheer inner stubbornness to be a good guy and not let chaos and lawlessness win has created an inner Watchman in his psyche, to keep the Beast in check.\n\nThe rogue drow fighter/ranger Drizzt do'Urden from Salvatore's Forgotten Realms D&D novels is prone to falling into berserk rages when his self-defense reflex is triggered. Drizzt dubbed this mental state \"the Hunter\", as he becomes a merciless and calculating killing machine and virtually unstoppable.\n\nIn Wizard's First Rule, the first book of the Sword of Truth series, when Kahlan is told Richard has died, which he hasn't, she goes into a \"blood rage\", killing the men who had her held down against the ground and ready to be raped without breaking a sweat.\n\nThe badgers in the Redwall series are prone to a \"bloodwrath,\" in which they become unstoppable berserkers who are blind to all but their target.\n\nOccasionally other creatures will go into a similar state as well, particularly Redwall Warriors if their loved ones are threatened.\n\nThe Major from High Rhulain. Especially during his Heroic Sacrifice.\n\nDaine, of The Immortals: \"I thought you were dead. I lost my temper.\" By way of an explanation for having leveled the entire Imperial Palace with zombie dinosaur skeletons in book three.\n\nMost of Tamora Pierce's protagonists get at least one of these moments.\n\nBoth Sam and Hailey in Only Revolutions.\n\nThe entire Hradani race of the Bahzell series. The race was originally more Elf like, being taller and having fox like characteristics along with a longer life than humans (at a cost at not being able to use magic as direct as humans). Then Wizards start experimenting with the Rage a few had. During the last war they were converted into an evil force of berserkers. Until the few with natural unstoppable rage were able to rebel. It's to the point that if you give yourself to the rage you're immune to nearly all magic. The main character nearly kills the only good wizard left on the planet when he hears the word \"wizard,\" triggering his rage.\n\nHradani didn't start with the Rage - it was forced into their species by dark wizards serving the evil pantheon of that world. Even twelve hundred years later, you wouldn't want to face one of them - Hradani come in two sizes: large and ginormous. Bahzel falls in the ginormous category himself - he's nearly eight feet tall, weighs nearly four hundred fifty pounds, and he moves like a cat. And that's when he isn't using the Rage.\n\nDeepgate Codex: Carnival is dangerous enough at the best of times, but when she gets sick of something she goes into god mode, at which point not even the laws of physics can stop her single-handedly slaughtering half an army using a regular everyday handheld gardening fork.\n\nHarry Dresden tends to cause a lot of property damage when he's pissed off, and has, at various points: killed an enormously more powerful wizard, Justin DuMorne; redirected a lightning bolt at a demon that was chasing him; thrown a werewolf all the way through two buildings; burned down a building containing hundreds of vampires because they grabbed his girlfriend; brought out all the ghosts under said building at once, collapsing it; killed several incredibly powerful demon-possessed psychos; shredded a mob of vampires with an antipersonnel mine; blasted a huge torrent of fire straight into the middle of the Winter Court of the Sidhe... Well, you get the idea.\n\nAnd all that pales in comparison to \"Blackstaff\" McCoy, who in a fit of rage over a threat to someone he cares about yanks a old Soviet satellite out of orbit and drops it on a vampire nobleman's estate just to make a point. Or later, when defending his family and friends simply rips the life out of dozens of people. No fire, no explosions, he just points at them and they die.\n\nA particularly extreme example of this is Icarium from Steven Erickson's Malazan Book of the Fallen. Icarium, normally a gentle and creative fellow verging on pacifism, has a tendency to go into a berserker mode that's downright genocidal when provoked, usually followed by an inability to remember what just happened. In milder cases, this means he wakes up confused among the gutted bodies of whatever ferocious pack of creatures just attacked him. In a few more extreme cases, he woke up among the shattered ruins and dead citizens of entire civilizations, completely unaware of what had just transpired.\n\nErik in The Phantom of the Opera is prone to these, especially when you hit his Berserk Button and ask him to remove his mask.\n\nIn The Pendragon Adventure, Saint Dane has a habit of confronting Bobby in order to smack him around for the hell of it. For the most part, though, he's just egging Bobby on as part of his Mind Screw technique. This changes in Rivers of Zadaa when Bobby - in the midst of being smacked around - stands up to Saint Dane and claims that the villain is getting desperate because he is losing the overall war. Saint Dane utterly snaps and proceeds to beat the living shit out of Bobby, to the point where Bobby spends a month in a hospital before he can walk again.\n\nEach of the villains in the Keys to the Kingdom series represents a deadly sin, with Sir Thursday representing wrath. He beats his subordinates for minor failures and deeply enjoys battle. At one point he kills children who have been enchanted into motionlessness just because they are not obeying his orders. They're not \"following orders\" BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MOVE. Thursday doesn't care.\n\nThe part of the Will he guards, which symbolizes Justice, has anger issues as well, spitting in the face of someone during a parley.\n\nDarkest Powers: Although Derek keeps his cool when he's the one in danger of being seriously hurt, possibly tortured, or killed, the same does not hold true when other people are at risk. Being a werewolf, Derek's rational mind will shut down and give way to pure \"protect my pack\" instinct when the tiny number of people he actually cares about are in danger. At least one person is already spending the rest of his life regretting having threatened Derek's brother.\n\nMrs. Weasley shows a bit of this in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows with her famous line \"NOT MY DAUGHTER YOU BITCH!\" followed by the death of a certain loyal female Death Eater. That proves never to mess with one of Mrs. Weasley's children. (This includes Harry, who earlier in the series she outright declared was her own son in all but blood.)\n\nHagrid may be a Gentle Giant, but if you do manage to get him into a real temper you'll find out that he's partially immune to spell damage and has more than enough strength to take down five armed attackers with his bare hands.\n\nFor the villains' side, if you bring Voldemort bad news... he'll flip out and indiscriminately kill anyone who happens to just be hanging around.\n\nIn Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian story \"The Phoenix on the Sword\", an Evil Eye attack by a sorcerously-summoned demon arouses this in Conan.\n\nTouchstone in the Old Kingdom series, in the first book, Sabriel is shot with an arrow and he runs very, very fast. Later a Noodle Incident is mentioned in which a fake ambassador (in this case a 2 metres tall barbarian) tries to kill Sabriel with a toasting fork. Touchstone grabs him and throws him down the table while roaring with rage. He then tries to throw the throne after him. Counts as a CMOA for Sabriel, who just sits there calming him down while everyone else is having a WTF moment, until he stops trying to pick up and throw the throne.\n\nIn the Lonely Werewolf Girl books, Kalix's unstoppable rage when she goes wolf has been the downfall of more than one werewolf hunter.\n\nThis trope is an inherited characteristic of the Viking-descended Barnikel lineage in Edward Rutherfurd's multi-generation historical novels. Do not anger a member of this family, whether it's by threatening to expose their role in La R√©sistance or abusing a puppy in front of a fifteen-year-old Barnikel boy.\n\nVisser Three in Animorphs had one of these several times a book practically. <You have failed me!!!> *body parts begin flying off*\n\nLive-Action TV\n\nThe show The Incredible Hulk is all about the Unstoppable Rage, and provides the page quote above.\n\n'Nuff said.\n\nIn Heroes, Niki Sanders's alter ego \"Jessica\", who has super-strength, mostly appears whenever somebody else threatens her son or otherwise angers her.\n\nIn The A-Team episode \"Without Reservations\", Face is shot during a hostage situation in a restaurant. Murdock spends most of the episode in a state of Tranquil Fury, until right near the end, when he finally gets his hands on the guy who shot Face, starts pounding him relentlessly, and actually has to be restrained before he finally stops. It's really not a good idea to hurt someone Murdock cares about.\n\nIn the Doctor Who episode \"The Runaway Bride\", after seeing the Doctor bring down the wrath of a Time Lord on his enemies, Donna points out just how creepy Unstoppable Rage is, especially coming from the hero, and questions whether we should be rooting for it.\n\nAs seen in \"Turn Left,\" he would've died there had Donna not been there to stop him from going too far.\n\nDo NOT threaten his companions. Seriously.\n\nCase in point: After a companion is kidnapped in series 6, the 11th Doctor blows up an entire legion of Cyberships just for some information (and to prove a point) and forms an army storm the guilty party's base. This quickly backfires in a spectacular fashion, but still.\n\nIn the episode Dalek it took an entire team of security officers to drag the Ninth Doctor away from the \"last\" Dalek when he was trying to kill it. It really skirts the boundaries between unstoppable rage and Tranquil Fury, but he shows to much emotion for it to count.\n\nJack Harkness of Torchwood, while a generally calm man, does go into a rage whenever his team is threatened and, due to his immortality, he's hard to stop.\n\nAlthough usually the epitome of The Stoic, really piss Teal'c off, such as what happened in the episode \"Talion,\" and he will stop at nothing until you are dead. It's a Jaffa revenge thing, y'see.\n\nThis also almost happens in an earlier episode when he finds out that his wife remarried.\n\nMiss Piggy of The Muppets, especially in The Muppet Movie. Step away from the frog if you know what's good for you.\n\nJeff of Community at two points in particular: in \"Cooperative Calligraphy\" when he starts tearing apart the room looking for Annie's pen, and once in Intermediate Documentary Filmmaking, after Pierce impersonates his father.\n\nData gets a brief one of these in the first part of the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"Descent\", resulting in him killing a couple of Borg with his bare hands. This was also, technically, his first ever experience of emotional rage.\n\nCommon on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, usually as a result of a loved one being harmed.\n\nWhen Glory drives Willow's girlfriend insane, Willow attacks her with black magic, actually managing to hurt her despite Glory being a hellgod. This foreshadows her Dark Willow phase - when Warren kills Tara, Willow flays him alive, goes after his partners, fights her own friends when they try to stop her, and nearly destroys the world.\n\nGiles goes after Angelus after the latter murdered Jenny Calendar. With a flaming baseball bat.\n\nSeen several times with Buffy herself; during her first fight with Angelus, he initially has the upper hand before he goes overboard with his taunts, after which she beats him up and backs him into a corner, but stops just short of killing him, instead settling for kicking him in the groin and walking away.\n\nOn the Angel end, we have Angel's near-killing of Wesley after the kidnapping of Connor. Gunn, Fred and several orderlies could barely haul him off of Wes.\n\nNever ever make Admiral William Adama angry, because not only will you get the most terrifying Death Glares on TV but he'll make sure you are dead within three episodes. For instance, when he suffers a mutiny, he flies into a Foe-Tossing Charge to the CIC, and the mutiny leader surrenders before he gets there...\n\nIn season one of Twenty Four The Mole Nina Myers tells Jack Bauer that the Drazens have murdered his daughter Kim. This proves to be the single biggest mistake that the bad guys ever made that season, as Jack then proceeds to storm their compound in a truck and go to town on everyone with both guns blazing.\n\nIn season 8, it gets turned Up to Eleven when they off Renee Walker. When you mess with someone Jack's that close to, nobody is safe.\n\nIn the iCarly episode \"iMake Sam Girlier\", Sam snaps out of her attempts to become more feminine and launches right into a bout of screaming rage after the new bully in town pushes her best friend Carly to the floor.\n\nCrops up in Professional Wrestling at times; it's typically called 'Hulking Up'. The bigger you are, the more you can get away with here.\n\nHulk Hogan built a whole career on this trope, getting beaten badly in the early minutes of his fights only to become unstoppable and nearly invulnerable to his opponent's attacks once he hulked out.\n\nParodied in The Avengers. Normally unflappable spy Steed gets thrown around by a bigger, better fighter. His eventual victory takes place off screen, with Steed's boss Mother narrating the villain's fatal error: He made Steed angry.\n\nMork from Ork, at least twice. Once when Klansmen deface Mindy's home when they find out she's Polish (he returns the favor to their lodge), and again when a robber hits and bullies Mearth in a bar. Also counts as Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass.\n\nSimilar to the example in Sword of Truth, the show Legend of the Seeker takes it one step further by having Kahlan's eyes go blood-red, scream loudly, and gain the abity to confess multiple people remotely (which, apparently, also allows her to confess a Mord'Sith without killing her). The first time it happens when Darken Rahl taunts her by saying that he will use her powers to confess Richard. She actually expels the needles stuck in her with such force that they stick into Rahl's wizard's neck, leaving Zedd the last wizard of the First Order. The second time happens when she finds out that Cara killed her sister, forcing Richard to hold her down, as Cara escapes. The last time (due to cancellation) happens in the finale, when a Sister of the Dark manages to confess Kahlan. When the heroes, with assistance from Mord'Sith, try to kill the Sister, Kahlan again flies into the Con'Dar state, confesses the Mord'Sith and has them kill each other. She then tries to confess Richard but fails, so she stabs him instead.\n\nThe title character from Kamen Rider Kuuga is normally a pretty nice guy that wants nothing more than to protect people's smiles. That said, do not piss him off. When a sadistic Grongi by the name of Go-Jaraji-Da pushed him too far in episode 35, the result was a brutal No-Holds-Barred Beatdown that ended with Godai finishing him off with a rage-fueled Rising Calamity Titan attack.\n\nThis is at the core of Kamen Rider Agito's Burning Form. The angrier Agito gets, the more powerful it becomes. However, somewhat subverted as it's not as strong as its evolution, Shineing Form, which doesn't require rage.\n\nIn the Criminal Minds episode \"100\" Aaron Hotchner gets into a fight with George Foyet a spree killer who is obsessed with him after he has kidnapped and murdered his wife, Foyet has gained the upper hand in the fight and tells him that once he kills him he's going after his young son who is hiding somewhere in the house, upon hearing this Hotchner suddenly regains his strength and beats him to death in a fit of rage, after his colleagues arrive they manage to restrain him assuring him that he's already dead.\n\nLucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo from Rome. They are deadly enough when they are just doing their job as Roman soldiers, but insult their legion or threaten/harm their loved ones? Yeah, been nice knowing ya, No matter how many henchmen you have to back you up.\n\nCSI: Catherine Willows was a good example of this in \"Lady Heather's Box\". Eddie's girlfriend started griping about wanting to save Eddie more than Lindsey, and it was all the team could do to hold Cath back.\n\nStargate Atlantis has this scene:\n\nSheppard: \"Ronon has some things he wants to take care of first.\"\n\nMcKay: \"Are you insane? There's at least twenty-five Wraith down there!\"\n\nBeckett: \"...twenty-three.\"\n\nTeyla: \"Also, Ronon appears to be quite angry.\"\n\nfive minutes later, all the Wraith are dead, mostly at Ronon's hands*\n\nTommy Oliver flies into this once in Power Rangers Dino Thunder. Zeltrax taunts him with his students' impending deaths at the hands of the episode's extra-strong giant monster. Tommy responds by beating Zeltrax within an inch of his life and then killing the monster with the Brachio Staff's newly-activated powers. Without growing or anything.\n\nBabylon 5: Some idiot makes the mistake of throwing a knife at John Sheridan, who is saved because Delenn throws herself in front of it instead. Sheridan's response is to attempt to kill the being responsible with his bare hands, and he would have succeeded if Security hadn't intervened.\n\nOral Tradition, Folklore, Myths snd Legends\n\nOlder Than Dirt: Sekhmet, an Egyptian goddess of war, pestilence, and healing, went on a bender when some mortals dared suggest that her father, the sun god Re, was getting a little old. She had no intention of stopping and nearly exterminated humanity. Finally Re himself stopped her, and then only by making a literal sea of beer mixed with pomegranate juice. Sekhmet, mistaking it for blood, drank herself stupid, and thus the world was saved by alcohol.\n\nCuchulainn from Irish mythology has a prime example of the \"monster within\" kind of unstoppable rage. In the epic, T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge, he enters a \"r√≠astrad\" or \"Warp Spasm\". In this state he transforms into a horribly mutilated monster who doesn't know friend from foe. At one time, they broke him out of his rage by dunking him into three separate water barrels. The first one exploded, the other began boiling, and the last one finally cooled him down.\n\nThis would later be co-opted into 2000 AD's Slaine, where they got really creative.\n\nIn Classical Mythology, Hercules killed his wife and children in a rage induced by Hera. Less supernaturally, as a kid Hercules killed his music teacher with a lyre.\n\nThe normally gentle Hindu Mythology goddesss Uma can transform into death dealing, world ending Kali. She does this to kill the demon Raktabija, after all the gods cut into the demon, only to find that his blood creates clone of himself once it hits the ground. Kali fixes the situation by inhaling all the blood before it touches the ground as she goes on her killing frenzy. Some legends continue that she would have turned her violence on the gods if Shiva, her husband, didn‚Äôt lie amongst the dead in a desperate gambit to get her to stop. This is particularly sobering as Shiva has the ability to unmake all of creation and was pretty sure the only thing that could stop his wife from killing everyone was to gamble on his importance to her.\n\nNorse Mythology is the very source of the word 'berserker' (from an Old Norse word meaning \"bear shirt\"), and was full of them, most famously Thor.\n\nAccording to Japanese Mythology, the storm god Susano-o flew into a drunken rage and did everything possible to mess up his sister Amaterasu's life. He defiled all her shrines, killed her handmaidens, and threw shit in her temples. The gods were unable to stop his overwhelming douchedness.\n\nTabletop Games\n\nIf the Black Templars from Warhammer 40,000 see a comrade die, they will charge at whoever or whatever killed him, in an attempt to avenge the dead. Add this to the fact that they cannot feel fear, and this means that Black Templars can get into very stupid situations. Lone man charging the physical manifestation of all disease, anybody?\n\nAnother WH 40K example is the Blood Angels group of Space Marines, who are occasionally affected by the Red Thirst or Blood-Rage, a berserker rage which grants them a whole heap of Heroic Resolve at the cost of any sense of self-preservation. This can go even further - on the eve of battle, a Blood Angel can succumb to the Black Rage, in which he relives the genetic memory of the chapter's Primarch (super-powered leader and genetic template) dying in a duel with the leader of the forces of Chaos. These individuals are quietly taken away, and used as berserker suicide squads. In gameplay terms, a random number of your soldiers, potentially including your souped-up general, are taken away and replaced with a squad of uncontrollable marines who rush into hand-to-hand combat with the most powerful enemy available. Your normal squads can periodically fall into the same rage, abandoning any fortifications they were manning to rush into close combat. This is not necessarily a bad thing if you are playing offensively, as it means your army can potentially cross the table in a few turns.\n\nMost obviously, Chaos Berzerkers of the Chaos God Khorne. Their quintessential crazy special character, Kharn the Betrayer, always hits in melee; if he rolls a miss, he's hit his own side. Frequently portrayed in the fiction as slaughtering his own men when he runs out of enemies.\n\nOne of the special abilities of the Tau Ethereal leader Aun Va is that he is so beloved by his troops that if he dies, he triggers an Unstoppable Rage in all Tau troops in line of sight - except in this case, the Unstoppable Rage is with plasma guns.\n\nThe World of Darkness gamelines feature this trope, mainly with the vampire and werewolf games in both systems.\n\nWhen a vampire character in White Wolf's Vampire: The Requiem or Vampire: The Masquerade enters a Frenzy and lets the Beast within take control, he or she can tear lesser foes to shreds and overwhelm another vampire, as they are able to ignore all wound penalties. A more powerful (and usually elder) vampire can still take a frenzied vampire down, especially if he goes into frenzy himself. Vampires interested in maintaining the Masquerade frown on those who frenzy, while those who aren't tend to embrace it.\n\nWerewolves from Werewolf: The Forsaken and Werewolf: The Apocalypse have the Frenzy ability as well, and alternately embrace it and fight it (noted that vampires, in game terms, roll to resist going berserk; werewolves roll to both resist and trigger it). They tend to have an even easier time than vampires, since frenzy is always accompanied by turning into a 9 foot-tall lupine death machine... that paradoxically makes their Masquerade easier to maintain due to something called the Delerium. Still, Forsaken calls it \"Death Rage\" for a good reason.\n\nIn Werewolf: The Apocalypse, going too deep into Frenzy causes the werewolf to enter \"Thrall of the Wyrm\" in which they go absolutely bonkers. This results in either shredding everything in sight, eating everybody in sight, or violent necrophilia, and always a ton of shame when the perpetrator regains their wits. There are also a few Gifts, such as the wereleopard Gift Shiva's Might, that lets the character deliberately enter a (normal) Frenzy.\n\nBoth gamelines' vampires, and Forsaken's werewolves, can instead enter Unstoppable Terror -- or \"R√∂tschreck,\" as it's known for vampires -- with the victim fleeing in blind panic from the trigger, tossing aside or shredding anything that stands in the way of doing so. In New World of Darkness it's treated as another facet of the Unstoppable Rage, while Vampire: The Masquerade treats it as an unrelated phenomenon also originating with the vampire's Beast. Werewolf: The Apocalypse has human witnesses freak out any time they see a werewolf or other shapeshifter in their hybrid form.\n\nPrometheans also have their own state of emotional disarray, known as Torment. How rage-filled Torment really is depends on the element of the Promethean's humor, but each one has some elements of Unstoppable Rage. Frankensteins (fire) and Tammuz (earth) have the more traditional \"Hulk Smash!\" rages, Galateids (air) tend to go all Fatal Attraction when it comes to obsessing with others, Osrians (water) go cold and emotionless, and Ulgans (spirit) lock onto whatever spirit is closest and copy its traits. And then you've got the rare nuclear Prometheans, the Zeka, whose Torment tends towards \"destroy everything.\"\n\nAnd, for added fun, instead of prompting normal Disquiet in vampires and werewolves, Prometheans instead cause an unsettling feeling in them that makes it increasingly more difficult for the other supernatural to resist Frenzy or Death Rage the longer they stay together.\n\nIn Dungeons & Dragons, a base class, the Barbarian, is built around this idea. Rage is the Barbarian's primary special ability, allowing them a marked increase in their physical prowess and mental fortitude in exchange for a slight decrease in their willingness to dodge blows and think straight. The ability becomes more potent as the character's level rises. Unlike most fictional versions of this trope, Barbarians may invoke and end their Rage at will (but are limited to one rage per encounter), not in response to any specific trigger.\n\nThird Edition also has an \"on steroids\"‚Äîor perhaps, \"on 'roid rage\"‚Äîprestige class version of the barbarian: the Frenzied Berserker. The main difference is that there are few defensive benefits to a frenzy (but see below) as opposed to a rage, that its bonuses and penalties can stack with a rage, that frenzy will continue until its time limit expires or the character forces himself out (rage can be ended at will, but you need to make a Will save to end a frenzy) -- and if he runs out of enemies the character will attack anyone in the vicinity, including allies‚Äîand finally that it can be triggered by damage as well as entered at will. Finally, he can also inspire frenzy in his allies, which if you consider that most frenzied berserkers probably hang around a lot of barbarians and fighters as opposed to wizards and rogues is a very scary thought.\n\nThis is a very good example of the trope, as a properly built Frenzied Berserker is one of the most powerful physical combatants possible under 3rd and 3.5 edition rules‚Äîwithout even going into epic level, a half-orc Frenzied Berseker could have a Strength of 36 while in a raging frenzy. This is enough to match or out-muscle most high-level fiends and celestials, all but the oldest and mightiest dragons, and many lesser deities in terms of raw strength.\n\nThe berserker's frenzy has a tropetastic defensive benefit. While Frenzying, HP damage will not kill him until the Frenzy is over. There's also a feat which lets him delay the effect of any attack until the end of the Frenzy. This can lead to some very interesting moments if he's hit with the big bad's Wave Motion Gun during his Frenzy. Also a notable counter for many damage-output Min-Maxing builds. See Glass Cannon. Sadly, this can be stopped suddenly by a 2nd-level spell called \"Calm Emotions\".\n\nWhat's not mentioned yet, and which elevates them from supremely powerful to Game Breaker, is that they get an improved version of the power attack feat, allowing use of a two handed weapon to deal 4 points of damage for every -1 to hit, and with the use of the Leap Attack feat, which triples power attack damage, it becomes 12 damage for every -1 to hit. Combine this with the fact that using a two hander multiplies your to hit bonus from strength by one half(there are ways to improve that bonus, naturally), and you can kill anything with a lucky shot.\n\nAnd now there's Fourth Edition, which introduces the Barbarian again. The 4E Barbarian is a bit more primal than his 3E counterpart, and his Daily powers, known as Rages, give effects that last for the entire encounter or until he enters a new Rage, give his At Will powers more power, and allow him to dish out Rage Strikes that expend unused Dailies to deal more damage against an enemy.\n\nPathfinder allows barbarians the option of performing any number of superhuman feats, or shaking off any number of incapacitating effects, while raging.\n\nExalted\n\nLimit Break in this game is part Heroic BSOD and part Unstoppable Rage. After having their virtues pushed to the breaking point, many Exalted will either A) act towards them with little thought of restraint, or B) act against them with little thought of restraint. This can get messy fast when the Exalt in question values Compassion or Valor. The two Solar Limit Breaks that best exemplify this are Berserk Anger and Red Rage of Compassion. RROC is slightly less psychotic but still tends to cause collateral damage on par with a very cranky airstrike.\n\nThe Lunars can become the very embodiment of this trope using the aptly-named Endurance Charms. One charm lets you shrug all damage as long as you channel Essence to it, another lets you not drop dead even if you, by all rights, should be. The fluffs say that Lunars using those charms raged for days as the world arrayed to kill them and their Solar mates.\n\nSolars also have a Resistance Charm that allows them to do this. Prematurely ending it takes a significant mental toll (it costs a ton of Willpower points and accumulates a lot of Limit) unless they are restrained by a friend or loved one.\n\nRighteous Fury mode is the Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel RPG version of Unstoppable Rage. A character can spend two Drama Points to go into Righteous Fury mode, but only in response to something very bad and deeply personal happening, like a brutal attack on a loved one, an unexpected and very nasty betrayal, or the raising of a monstrous former lover killed years ago. When in this mode, the character gets a + 5 to all attack actions for the rest of the fight, which is cumulative with Drama Points spent for Heroic Feats. Even a White Hat can kick serious ass when properly motivated like this.\n\nSeveral races in Talislanta have some sort of innate rage ability. However, there's usually a catch: For example, if your Ahazu goes \"shan-ya,\" you're a danger to everyone...and if your Vajra evokes the Dark Fire, you're probably going to need a new character.\n\nTheatre\n\nIn Romeo and Juliet, Romeo goes into unstoppable rage after Tybalt kills Mercutio (\"...Mercutio's soul/is but a little ways above our heads.../either you or I or both must go with him.\") Also seen again when he kills Paris (\"Tempt not a desperate man\"). Romeo's always in some exaggerated emotional state or another.\n\nHamlet is theoretically in unstoppable rage after the last soliloquy of the play (\"...from this point forth/my thoughts be bloody or nothing worth\"), but, given that this is Hamlet, two scenes later he's cracking jokes with a gravedigger.\n\nThe Winters Tale is about what happens when an extremely powerful man gives in to paranoia and unstoppable rage and takes it out on his subjects.\n\nVideo Games\n\nIn the Yakuza series, hurt a kid in front of Kazuma Kiryu. Then count how many teeth you have left after he's done beating you within an inch of your life.\n\nAssassin's Creed: Revelations Ezio goes berserk when he finds Yusuf's body and launches a full scale assault on Istanbul's arsenal. Only one person is spared.\n\nSplinter Cell: Sam Fisher hits this at the end of mission eight of Conviction, where he learns that Lambert was behind faking his daughter's death in Double Agent, at which point, at least for the rest of the mission, Mark and Executes are free, as in no need to CQC enemies to earn them, and the meter is up to a max of six at this point.\n\n\"Unstoppable Rage\" sums up Kratos from the God of War series. Plus, he has an ability named \"Rage of the Gods/Titans/Sparta\", that makes him more unstoppable.\n\nIn Ghost of Sparta, Kratos may have topped himself after seeing Thanatos kill his brother. The man truly becomes rage incarnate at that moment.\n\nFairly late in Super Robot Wars: Original Generation, the hero's girlfriend is kidnapped by a traitor, and brainwashed into not only attacking him, but also aiming deliberate, emotional attacks at him. The result: His mech becomes nigh-unstoppable for the duration of the battle as he performs a Foe-Tossing Charge towards the traitor.\n\nPartially subverted in that Kyosuke never actually shows any real emotion.\n\nKatina: Wow. He can stay calm even through this?\n\nRyusei: No. I've never seen him this angry before.\n\nThe Kaiser Dragon from Breath of Fire III and IV. If Ryu transforms into this from without some tweaking (in III it was a specific combo of Dragon Genes, in IV it required you to gather the various breath weapons of dragons), he'll kill his allies.\n\nThe scene where he unlocks it in IV is particularly noteworthy. After he easily exterminates the army officer who pissed him off to such a degree (by slaughtering a village of innocent civilians and THEN setting an absurdly powerful monster on your team, which Ryu also destroyed), he's STILL angry and ready to kill, quickly turning his sights on another officer (who can only point her gun at him while shaking in terror), getting his only lines in the game by screaming in rage the entire time. The whole scene is decidedly scary, and it takes a Cooldown Hug from Nina to bring him back to normal.\n\nAs the said Cooldown Hug occurs, Fou-lu is driven to rage when his girlfriend is used to fuel a nuke.\n\nArcueid of Tsukihime most notably loses her cool during another heroine's route, when you turn down her offer to turn you into a vampire and slice her nearly in half. The humiliating, excruciatingly painful, and oh-so-temporarily debilitating injury drives her insane, removing the self-imposed restraints on the majority of her power...\n\nIn Arcueid's own route, when she gets cut in half by Roa and dies in Shiki's arms, Shiki goes berserk. Roa is several kinds of Deader Than Dead by the time Shiki comes down from it.\n\nActually, nearly all of the routes have a tendency to end with Shiki falling into this mode. In Akiha's route, after SHIKI hurts Akiha, Shiki completely loses it and goes into his killer mode. Later, in the same route, when SHIKI Mind Rapes Akiha, it takes all of Shiki's willpower to not kill SHIKI immediately. He does kill him, but not before SHIKI tells him how to bring Akiha back to normal. Then, in Hisui's route he goes into a similar homicidal rage when SHIKI either badly wounds or, if it's your first playthrough, kills Akiha and slice him in half in a single stroke. Finally, Kohaku's route features an aversion, when Akiha seems to murder Kohaku in cold blood, Shiki loses any semblance of reason and attempts to kill his own sister. In the end, despite all the wrongs Akiha has committed against Shiki during the course of the route, Shiki still finds himself unable to kill her, realizing that, no matter what she's done to him, she's still his irreplaceable sister. In fact, he even cries when he realizes this. Luckily, as it turns out, Akiha was unable to kill Kohaku either, so all's well that ends well.\n\nOccasionally occurs as a plot device in the Final Fantasy series, often against the villain. Often enough though, the character dies afterwards. An example is Tellah in FF 4.\n\nEdge in Final Fantasy IV as well. It's what unlocks the ability to use his Ninjitsu techniques after Rubicante taunts him about letting his emotions get in the way.\n\nHappens before the plot of Drakengard, so the protagonist is in almost a constant state of Unstoppable Rage throughout the game. His rage abates by the time any of the endings r"
