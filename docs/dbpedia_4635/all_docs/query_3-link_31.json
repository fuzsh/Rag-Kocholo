        "text": "Taking this article series in a slightly different direction, we wanted to address a common and contentious rulings issue that has arisen out of the Sensei Deck changes for the Retro Format.\n\nThe Trick: Can you perform Hercule’s Amazing Techniques after a Majin Buu’s Fury has been played?\n\nMajin Buu’s Fury only allows you to perform two actions during combat: perform an attack or pass. Hercule’s Amazing Techniques allows you to immediately play a card that performs an attack. So the question is, can Hercule’s Amazing Techniques be used after Majin Buu’s Fury has been played since the end result is an attack? To figure that out, we have to look at a few things, including what Fury actually does. Fury limits your options during the “Attacker Attacks” phase to two actions: perform an attack or pass. The word perform is key there.\n\nWhen we look at the CRD, there is actually a clear definition of the actions that can be performed in the “Attacker Attacks” phase:\n\nWhat to do in an Attack Phase.\n\nYou can do one of the following things in an Attack Phase:\n\n1. Play a card that can perform an attack from your hand and use it to attack your\n\nopponent with a physical or energy attack.\n\n2. Use a card you have in play that can perform an attack to attack your opponent.\n\n3. Use a Non-Combat card for its effects and then discard it after use.\n\n4. Play a card, use its effects and then discard it.\n\n5. Use a Personality power. If a personality has a power that you can use during your\n\nAttack Phase, you may use it.\n\n6. Perform a Final Physical Attack.\n\n7. Pass.\n\nSo using this breakdown, we can see that Majin Buu’s Fury allows you to do #1,2,6 and 7. Personality powers and non-combat cards that perform attacks would fall under #2, so we must ask ourselves what category would Hercule’s Amazing Techniques (HAT) fall under. It would not fall under #1, since the card in your hand (HAT) does not actually perform an attack. As per the card text, you are playing another card from your Sensei Deck. HAT would not be a card in play, so it’s not #2 and it goes without saying that HAT is not #6 or #7. HAT would best fit under #4, a card that has an effect and then is discarded (being removed from game is part of its effect in this case). Because it does not perform an attack, it could not be played.\n\nFurther we must consider the probability of failure for the HAT to perform an attack. The most simple example is canceling the HAT with a Trunks Energy Sphere. If you sphere the HAT, the action instantly becomes illegal. Sure there are attacks that can be sphered like Red Double Strike and Namekian’s Strike, but those are still attacks that can be performed. Further, with Retro Rules you could simply fail the search of your Sensei Deck, allowing you to make the play illegal at any time. This means that special rules would have to be in effect for HAT that you could not “fail the search” when using it after hat, but then that opens up other issues that we’ll get into in the next section.\n\nIt has been ruled that Sensei Deck is not common knowledge in the game, meaning you don’t have to reveal its contents to your opponent. This means that when you play HAT after Fury, your opponent has to essentially trust that you have a legal target in your Sensei Deck. At this point, the play is contingent on one player’s personal knowledge of game state and their own deck’s content that cannot be confirmed by the opponent. So even if we have the “cannot fail the search” ruling, there has to be yet an additional ruling that the card cannot be played unless there is a legal target in your Sensei Deck, a situation that the opponent cannot verify at all. So this leads us to the most relevant card for precedence outside this scenario: Android 16 Lv. 4.\n\nAdmittedly, this card is incredibly unlikely to see play, but it provides valuable insight into how HAT works. Like HAT, this power doesn’t directly perform an attack and can fail (remember, HAT can be sphered or just fail the search). So even though the likelihood of Android 16’s power failing is much higher than HAT’s, in game terms they are both cards that may result in an attack but also have a probability of failure. So can Android 16 use his power after a Fury, since like HAT, there’s a chance it may result in an attack.\n\nLet’s go back to the whole Sensei Deck not being common knowledge issue. So using the logic that I know what’s in my Sensei Deck and you don’t, I’m allowed to use HAT after Fury because I (and not you) know that there is a legal target there. So how about Android 16? What if I also know that based on the contents of my discard pile, only cards that can perform physical attacks are left in my deck. So can I just tell you “I know the contents of my deck (and not you), so the power will not fail” and use Android 16’s power? Does my personal knowledge of my deck’s content that you cannot verify, allow me to perform actions that I normally could not? Am I simply allowed to use Android 16’s power, like HAT, because there is a chance, like HAT, that it could end in an attack? The answer is no.\n\nBottom Line: Hercule’s Amazing Techniques has a probability of failure and in itself does not perform an attack. Personal knowledge of your deck’s content does not allow you to override rules or restrictions placed upon you by Majin Buu’s Fury. Hercule’s Amazing Techniques cannot be played after a Majin Buu’s Fury.\n\nTrick: Busted (whatever that means in this situation)."
