        "text": "American rapper (born 1988)\n\nFor the Dragon Ball character also known as 'Kid Buu' and Santiago's namesake, see Majin Buu.\n\nMusical artist\n\nMarkquez Lao Santiago (born April 11, 1988), known professionally as Kid Buu, is an American rapper and singer based in South Miami, Florida. His career has been marked by his attempts to generate controversy as well as his run-ins with the law, including allegations of domestic and child abuse.\n\nEarly life and career\n\n[edit]\n\nMarkquez Santiago was born on April 11, 1988, at St. Elizabeth Child Care Center in Jersey City, New Jersey. He later moved with his brother, Jason, and his mother to South Florida, specifically the Hialeah and Opa-locka areas, in search of a better life. As a child, Valentine took martial arts classes. He attended public school before being home-schooled. He recalls the death of friends in harsh neighborhoods as well as having come from poverty as motivators for a better life. He is of Sicilian and Puerto Rican descent.[1]\n\nIn late 2018, Santiago changed his stage name from \"Humongous The God\" to \"Kid Buu\", in reference to his favorite Dragon Ball Z character Majin Buu,[2] and for his love of anime. The \"Majin\" tattoo between his eyes, his fangs and his pink hair further promote this persona.[3][4]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2019, Santiago was convicted on charges of child abuse following a domestic dispute with then girlfriend Blac Chyna.[5]\n\nSantiago is a RaÃ«lian.[6]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of albums, with selected details Title Studio album details Revenge of the Clones\n\nReleased: November 8, 2019\n\nLabel: Island Records\n\nFormat: CD, digital download, streaming\n\nMixtapes\n\n[edit]\n\nList of mixtapes, with selected details Title Mixtape details Man vs God\n\nReleased: August 6, 2011\n\nLabel: Self-released\n\nFormat: Digital download, streaming\n\nMan vs God 2: Agape\n\nReleased: March 7, 2014\n\nLabel: Self-released\n\nFormat: Digital download, streaming\n\nMan vs God 3: HXTXG\n\nReleased: September 11, 2014\n\nLabel: Self-released\n\nFormat: CD, digital download, streaming\n\nIn Gwalla We Trust\n\nReleased: February 3, 2016\n\nLabel: Global Gwalla Gang Records\n\nFormat: Digital download, streaming\n\nGwalla 16\n\nReleased: December 25, 2016\n\nLabel: Global Gwalla Gang Records\n\nFormat: Digital download, streaming\n\nKaneda\n\nReleased: April 13, 2017\n\nLabel: Global Gwalla Gang Records\n\nFormat: Digital download, streaming\n\nBlind For Love\n\n(with Oohdem Beatz)\n\nReleased: February 13, 2018\n\nLabel: Self-released\n\nFormat: CD, digital download, streaming\n\nBlind For Love 3\n\nReleased: January 24, 2020\n\nLabel: Island Records\n\nFormat: CD, digital download, streaming\n\nWhat the Game's Been Missing\n\nReleased: March 3, 2021\n\nLabel: Valentine Enterprise\n\nFormat: Digital download, streaming\n\nBlind for Love 4: A Perfect Luv Letter\n\nReleased: January 22, 2022\n\nLabel: Valentine Enterprise\n\nFormat: CD, digital download, streaming\n\nPink Planet\n\nReleased: June 2, 2023\n\nLabel: Valentine Enterprise\n\nFormat: CD, digital download, streaming\n\nPink Planet 2.0\n\nReleased: December 23, 2023\n\nLabel: Self-released[7]\n\nFormat: Digital download, streaming\n\nExtended plays\n\n[edit]\n\nList of EPs, with selected details Title EP details Blind For Love 2\n\nReleased: February 14, 2019\n\nLabel: Island Records\n\nFormat: CD, digital download, streaming"
