        "text": "In 1816, Archduchess Clementina married her uncle Leopold, Prince of Salerno, her mother's youngest brother. Shocked? The Hapsburgs were notorious for their consanguineous marriages. Her parents were double first cousins; nor was Clementina's marriage the first uncle/niece marriage among the Habsburgs. One can say it was the rule rather than the exception.\n\nCarlos II of Spain (1661 - 1700), dubbed \"The Hexed\", was the product of an uncle/niece marriage and his grandfather Philip III was also born of an uncle/niece marriage. Indeed, it is now believed that excessive inbreeding led to the extinction of the Spanish Habsburgs, ending with Carlos II in 1700, dead at age 39, suffering all his life from various genetic disorders. (read: Demise of the Spanish Habsburg Dynasty)\n\nScientists also point out the high rate of stillbirths, infant, and child mortality in the Habsburg families. Only about 60 percent of infants survived to age 1 and only half of the children born to the dynasty survived to age 10. Given these statistics, it is interesting to note that three of Archduchess Clementina’s four children died within their first year. Only one child, Princess Maria Carolina, survived into adulthood and she married her first cousin Henri d'Orléans, Duc d'Aumale. They had seven children. Sadly, three were stillborn and two died within the first year. Her two surviving sons didn't live past the age of 21, leading to the eventual demise of the d'Orleans line."
