        "text": "DBWI: What if No Second Napoleonic Wars\n\nAs we all know the reign of Napoleon II is seen by most historians as the one of the most unexpected and pivotal moments in history. After the final defeat of Napoleon I at Leipzig or \"The Battle of Nations\" as the Coalition powers dubbed it, the French Empire quickly fell apart with France...\n\nWI: Franz Joseph I gets to marry Princess Anne of Prussia\n\nContext, a young Franz Joseph I fell in love with Princess Anne of Prussia, and wanted to propose to her, but she was already engaged, and Prussian statesmen didn’t like the possibility of a Prussia-Austrian alliance. Anne would have an unhappy married life, while Franz Joseph married Sisi...\n\nAHC/WI: Alternative for Austria-Hungary - no Ausgleich\n\nMany people people blame the collapse of Austria-Hungary in it's own political structure which derives from the Ausgleich (A-H Compromise) of 1867, the union clearly had various issues and the Empire never really managed to reform after it, due to neither the Austrian nor Hungarian sides wanting...\n\nWI: Austria doesn't interfere against Russia in the Crimean War\n\nIn the lead-up to the Crimean War, Nicholas I of Russia expected Franz Joseph I of Austria to not interfere against him, and possibly even join him. This was partly because they were both members of the Holy Alliance, and partly because Russia had earlier helped Austria to put down the Hungarian...\n\nEmperor Charles VI has younger brother\n\nChange is simple-youngest child of HRE Leopold, in 1690 is a boy (Ferdinand? Maximilian?) who lives to adulthood. His existence likely would not change much until death of Emperor Joseph, but what would happen then? In 1711 case of Charles in Spain was practically lost, so Philip eventually is...\n\n[ONGOING] What REALLY would have happened if the Ottomans won the siege of Vienna 1529\n\nNow I know what most of you are thinking. You've probably seen this scenario/POD dozens of times on this forum. But the reason why I think it deserves a better assessment is that most of the time the answers to this generally misunderstand the aims and state which the Ottoman Empire was in...\n\nHapsburg Spain continues WI\n\nI know there have been threads on Hapsburg Spain continuing before but I thought it would be nice to hear what u guys think of this. It’s often believed that Louis the sun king would have accepted peace in the war of Spanish succession in 1710 against the Austrian alliance if this clause was...\n\nOttomans march on Vienna... after 1683?\n\nAfter the Ottoman defeat at the Battle of Vienna, the Habsburgs won several victories and expelled the Sultan's armies out of Hungary. However, after 1790, with Austria distracted by a war with France, the Turks went on the offensive and began to retake lost territory, until they were finally...\n\nDaughters of Empress Claudia Felicitas live to adulthood\n\nSecond wife of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold Habsburg had two short living daughters-Archduchess Anna Maria Josepha born in 1674 and Archduchess Maria Josepha Clementina born in 1675. So assuming that they're more lucky than IOTL and survived to adulthood, what would be their fate? @Vitruvius...\n\nWI: Austria retains South Tyrol after WWI?\n\nBasically, what if the Republic of Austria, after 1918, had managed to negotiate its way to retaining the majority German province of South Tyrol (minus the Trentino region, which imbues some confusion into me as it could theoretically be considered “Middle Tyrol”), thus preventing 150.000...\n\nWhat if France won the Franco-Prussian War? (1870-1925)\n\nThis is an expanded version of my earlier post, please feel free to comment! In this alternate scenario, Bismarck must retire during 1870 due to ill health. This isn’t that far fetched- his quasi-depression at seeing what he thought was a Prussian humiliation caused significant ill health...\n\nHave Post-1848 Austria-Hungary Partitioned in a War or Series of Wars\n\nSo during the 1848 revolutions or after that period, what likely scenarios can occur where a bunch of nations and factions decide to gang up on Austria (or Austria-Hungary) and just partition the hell out of it? Who would participate in this? What would they gain? And how does this impact the...\n\nWI: Suleiman captures Vienna\n\nIn 1529, Suleiman the Magnificent led an Ottoman-Transylvanian force to attack the city of Vienna. They besieged the city for more than two weeks, but failed to capture it and were forced to withdraw. Let us suppose they captured the city. What would change?\n\nWI: Mongols had besieged Vienna?\n\nHello all, During the reign of Odogei Khan, Mongol forces led by Batu Khan and Subutai won a great victory at the Battle of Mohi in 1241, and Hungary and Croatia were subjugated. Mongol forces began moving into Austria. Wiener Neustadt, located just south of Vienna, was raided in 1241. After...\n\nNo WWI and Volkish wank, how far they can get?\n\nIn OTL there were many moviments in Germany and Austria that tried to return some pagan-pre roman ancient customs to Germany and Austria hungary. How far can these moviments go if there is no WWI and they are allowed to continue? Could they create some kind of mix of art noveau with ancient...\n\nBest reform plan for the Austrian Empire?\n\nEveryone seems to be in agreement that the Austro-Hungarian compromise was a bad deal for long term stability of the country. It gave too much to the Hungarians and nothing to anyone else. What would in your opinion be a good way to structure the Austrian Empire? The 2 most common proposals...\n\nAHC- More San Marinos and Liechtensteins\n\nAs the title suggests how would we get more nations like San Marino and Liechtenstein, small nations part of ethnic groups of larger nation-states but left out of consolidation because of geography or politics. San Marino left out of Italy not because they arent Italians but because of politics...\n\nFate of Non-German Hapsburg Lands in Großdeutsche Germany?\n\nIn a scenario where Austria is high favorable to German unification, with it accepting leadership of a united Germany at the Frankfurt Assembly, what would then happen to the non-German lands under Emperor Ferdinand and later Franz Joseph. While an Austrian-led Germany can be acceptable at the...\n\nThe Stillborn Empire: What if the Austrians lost the War of Austrian Succession?\n\nThreadmarks: Part One: The Drums of War\n\nPart One: The Drums of War King Frederick II, seen here venerated by the Silesian estates, by Wilhelm Camphausen, 1882 The first drums of war were heard all over Europe when the hooves of the Prussian cavalry horses began to step into Silesia.
