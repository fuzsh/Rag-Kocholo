        "text": "A carte-de-visite portrait of the duchesse d’Aumale (1822-1869).\n\nBorn Princess Maria Carolina Augusta of Bourbon-Two Sicilies in Vienna on 26 April 1822, her parents were Prince Leopold of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Prince of Salerno, and his wife, the Archduchess Maria Clementina of Austria, daughter of Emperor Francis II.\n\nOn 25 November 1844 she married Prince Henri, duc d’Aumale, fifth son of King Louis-Philippe of France. The couple had four children, of which two survived infancy. Her eldest son died in 1866, aged only 20, and Maria Carolina remained inconsolable for the few remaining years of her life. She died in exile at Twickenham on 6 December 1869 from infectious tuberculosis. Her husband remained a widower until his death in 1897."
