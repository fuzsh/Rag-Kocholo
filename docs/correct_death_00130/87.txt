John Diefenbaker, Canada's 13th prime minister, was buried on the University of Saskatchewan campus when he died in 1979. His second wife Olive, who died three years earlier, was disinterred from an Ottawa cemetery and reburied beside him. The grave is beside the Diefenbaker Centre, a museum and archive named in his honour.
