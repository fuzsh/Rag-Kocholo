        "text": "Above: Canadian Houses of Parliament, from H2O (2004)\n\nA Screen Capture I Took Via PowerDVD\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nJOHN GEORGE DIEFENBAKER (SEPTEMBER 18, 1895-AUGUST 16, 1979)\n\nLeader of the Progressive Conservative Party (1956-1967) and Prime Minister of Canada (1957-1963)\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nTHOMAS CLEMENT DOUGLAS (OCTOBER 20, 1904-FEBRUARY 24, 1986)\n\nPremier of Saskatchewan (1944-1961) then Leader of the New Democratic Party (1961-1971)\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nLESTER BOWLES PEARSON (APRIL 23, 1897-DECEMBER 27, 1972)\n\nLeader of the Liberal Party (1958-1968) and Prime Minister of Canada (1963-1968)\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nToday I add to the Ecumenical Calendar of Saints’ Days and Holy Days three Canadian statesmen who, despite their political differences, were each partially responsible for creating the national health care system.\n\nOur story begins, however, with Prime Minister Richard Bennett (1870-1947), who led his country from 1930 to 1935. In 1935 he, the leader of the Conservative Party, was seeking another mandate. The Prime Minister proposed a set of social programs, including national medical insurance. Bennett lost the election and his proposal died. Within a few years, however, a Baptist minister (whom some accused of being a Communist) influenced by the Social Gospel picked up the torch.\n\nAbove: Tommy Douglas\n\nImage Source = http://www.pittmeadowstoday.ca/education-canadians-voted-tommy-douglas-our-greatest-canadian-in-2004/\n\nThomas Clement Douglas (1904-1986), son of Thomas Douglas and Annie Clement Douglas, was born in Falkirk, Scotland. The family immigrated to Canada when he was six years old. His father, an iron moulder, suffered from an injury which almost led to the amputation of one leg. Douglas, whose future depended greatly on his father’s ability to earn a living, became convinced that quality health care should not depend upon one’s ability to afford it. The family returned to Scotland during World War I then went back to Canada. Douglas, shaped by the Social Gospel and by social injustices (many of them economic), earned his B.A. at Brandon College, Manitoba, in 1930 (the same year he married Irma Dempsey), and is M.A. at MacMaster University in 1933. Then he became pastor of a Baptist congregation at Weyburn, Saskatchewan.\n\nPolitics beckoned Douglas. He ran unsuccessfully for the provincial legislature on the Farmer-Labour ticked in 1934. The following year he ran successfully for the federal House of Commons as a candidate of the Co-opearative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), a Fabian Socialist party. Douglas, elected to a second term in 1940, resigned four years later to run successfully for Premier of Saskatchewan.\n\nThe CCF, founded in 1932, during the depths of the Great Depression, was an outgrowth of Progressivism. It received much support from trade unionists, farmers, and urban intellectuals. Causes the CCF supported included:\n\nClearing slums;\n\nElectrifying rural areas;\n\nEstablishing public works programs;\n\nSocializing financial institution and public utilities;\n\nCreating national health insurance;\n\nEstablishing pensions for disabled people;\n\nSubsidizing affordable rental housing;\n\nSupporting agricultural prices; and\n\nPassing a national bill of rights.\n\nMany of these goals became realities in governments led by Progressive Conservative John Diefenbaker and Liberal Lester Pearson.\n\nDouglas, Premier of Saskatchewan from 1944 to 1961, instituted important and historical reforms. He granted public employees the right to bargain collectively. The Premier’s administration granted equality of access to public places and ownership of property regardless of race, creed, color, or nationality. And, in 1947, the provincial government began to offer a variety of insurance programs (including medical).\n\nIn 1961 the CCF ended its existence; the New Democratic Party (NDP), more moderate than the CCF, took its place with Douglas as the first federal leader. He, returned to the House of Commons in 1962, remained there through 1979, except for a brief gap in 1968-1969. Douglas, who left the national leadership of the NDP in 1971, received the honor of the Order of Canada in 1980. The staunch defender of civil liberties died at Ottawa, Ontario, in 1986.\n\nImage in the Public Domain\n\nNow we turn our attention to John Diefenbaker (1895-1979), a man who defended his opinions vigorously then acknowledged that those fellow countrymen who disagreed with him were also loyal Canadians. National unity mattered greatly to Diefenbaker, as did how decisions which governments and corporate boards made affected common people. “Dief the Chief” was a Western populist whose principles made him unpopular with elements of his political party, the Progressive Conservatives.\n\nDiefenbaker, born at Neustadt, Ontario, in 1895, was son of William Thomas Diefenbaker and Mary Florence Bannerman Diefenbaker. The future Prime Minister, who moved to the Fort Carlton region of the North-West Territories with his family in 1903, relocated with them to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, seven years later. He graduated from the University of Saskatchewan with his B.A. in 1915 and with his M.A. the following year. Diefenbaker served in the Army in 1916 and 1917 then entered law school, graduating in 1919.\n\nThe Saskatchewan attorney entered political life. In 1925 and 1926 he ran unsuccessfully for the House of Commons on the Conservative Party ticket. In 1929 and 1938 Diefenbaker ran unsuccessfully for provincial offices. Yet, from 1936 to 1940, he led the provincial Conservative Party. And from 1940 to 1979, he sat in the House of Commons. Diefenbaker, federal leader of the Progressive Conservative Party (renamed in 1942) from 1956 to 1967, served as Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.\n\nAlong the way Diefenbaker married twice. His first wife was Edna Mae Brower (1899, 1951), whom he married in 1929. He remarried in 1953, wedding Olive Freeman Palmer (1902-1976).\n\nAs Prime Minister Diefenbaker had some important accomplishments. As a matter of principle he opposed government favors for millionaires. This policy disturbed many members of the Eastern, big business-oriented wing of his party yet pleased his fellow Western populists. Diefenbaker, like Tommy Douglas an advocate of a national bill of rights, secured passage of it in 1960. The Prime Minister led the international movement to isolate the Apartheid government of the Republic of South Africa. And, in 1961, he appointed a Royal Commission on Health Services. Three years later the Royal Commission endorsed the Saskatchewan model–mandatory health insurance. (This had been mandatory in the province since 1961.)\n\nThe Canadian Bill of Rights (1960) was a landmark law. It was the first national legislation to protect human rights and basic freedoms. This bill of rights lasted until 1982, when the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms superceded it.\n\nDiefenbaker, a Baptist, died at Ottawa, Ontario, in 1979.\n\nAbove: Lester Pearson, July 16, 1956\n\nCopyright: Copyright assigned to Library and Archives Canada by copyright owner Duncan Cameron\n\nCredit: Duncan Cameron / Library and Archives Canada / e007150483\n\nMikan number 3727308\n\nhttp://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&lang=eng&rec_nbr=3727308&rec_nbr_list=105124,3727311,3840421,3727310,3840420,3727308,3840408,3840418,3840414,3727312\n\nThe final luminary in our Canadian triad is Lester Pearson (1897-1972), Diefenbaker’s frequent political adversary. Pearson was born at Toronto, Ontario. He, the son of a Methodist pastor, attended public schools at Peterborough and Hamilton. Pearson served in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I. His military service ended when a bus ran over him and the Corps sent him home. Then Pearson attended the University of Toronto (B.A., 1919) and Oxford University (degrees in 1923 and 1925). Next he worked as a Lecturer (1924-1926) then as an Assistant Professor (1926-1928) of History at the University of Toronto.\n\nThen Pearson commenced his career as a diplomat. He, married to Maryon Elspeth (1901-1989) since 1925, became a first secretary in the new federal Department of External Affairs in 1928. This led to a series of diplomatic postings and service on two royal commissions then a stint as Secretary (later Counsellor) of the Canadian High Commissioner’s Office in London. Pearson, nearly the first Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN), served as the first Ambassador to the United States in 1945-1946. Next, in 1946-1948, he was the Undersecretary of State for External Affairs. In 1947 Pearson served as Chairman of the UN’s Political and Security Committee; he proved instrumental in the partition of Palestine in 1947.\n\nThen, in 1948, Pearson entered politics, his arena for the next two decades. The future Prime Minister, a member of the Liberal Party, joined the House of Commons and became Secretary of State for External Affairs. His diplomacy continued–he was ever a diplomat–into political life. In 1956, during the Suez Crisis, Pearson proposed the creation of a UN peacekeeping force, thereby aiding British and French withdrawal from Egypt. For this he won the Nobel Peace Prize the following year. In 1957, with Diefenbaker’s rise to the office of Prime Minister, the Liberal Party became the main opposition party. Pearson led that party from 1958 to 1968, when he retired from public life.\n\nPearson became Prime Minister in 1963. He led two successive minority governments (1963-1965 and 1965-1968). His tenure was eventful. In 1965 Pearson signed the Canada Pension Plan (similar to Social Security in the U.S.A.), something for which Tommy Douglas also advocated. Pearson also presided over the centennial of Canadian confederation in 1967. Of great importance also were two other laws.\n\nIn 1966 the Government of Canada created Medicare–socialized medicine–via the Medical care act. This accomplishment also had the fingerprints of Richard Bennett, Tommy Douglas, and John Diefenbaker all over it.\n\nAbove: The Flag of Canada, 1957-1965\n\nImage in the Public Domain\n\nAnd, in December 1964, Parliament voted to change the national flag, switching from a flag with the Union Jack prominent in it to the current banner, the one with the maple leaf symbol.\n\nAbove: The Flag of Canada Since 1965\n\nImage in the Public Domain\n\nThis was not a universally popular decision. John Diefenbaker, a defender of Canada’s British heritage, opposed the new flag. He spoke of the two founding nations of Canada–Britain and France–and of how the flag should show both heritages. The former Prime Minister also spoke of the Canadian soldiers who had died fighting under a Canadian flag with the Union Jack on it.\n\nPearson, ever the diplomat and mediator, tried to resolve a variety of disputes, sometimes unsuccessfully. In 1965, for example, the Prime Minister, in a speech at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, criticized U.S. policy in Vietnam and suggested that, if the United States were to halt bombing in Vietnam, there might be an opening for a negotiated settlement. President Lyndon Baines Johnson took great offense and invited him to Camp David. There the President demonstrated his displeasure by grabbing the Prime Minister’s lapels and scolding him. Canada, Johnson said, did not do its fair share to spread freedom around the world, so Pearson had no right to criticize U.S. foreign policy. The Prime Minister came away from that encounter convinced that the President was a bully and that the United States was not a senior partner but a nation to view from a distance. Pearson’s subtle description of the encounter to his cabinet was to recount\n\nthe story of a British policeman giving evidence at a murder trial. “My Lord,” the policeman told the judge, acting on information received, I proceeded to a certain address and there found the body of a woman. She had been strangled, stabbed and shot, decapitated and dismembered. But, My Lord, she had not been interfered with.”\n\nAt Camp David, the Prime Minister concluded, he had at least not been\n\ninterfered with.\n\n–Quoted in Robert Dallek, Flawed Giant: Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1961-1973 (New York, New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), page 259\n\nPearson, a member of the United Church of Canada, died at Ottawa, Ontario, in 1972.\n\nI have been pondering and studying Canada for years. It is an interest which many people do not understand. This interest has led me, however, to learn of these great men–statesmen, really–who left Canada better than they found it.\n\nKENNETH RANDOLPH TAYLOR\n\nJANUARY 31, 2014 COMMON ERA\n\nTHE FEAST OF CHARLES FREDERICK MACKENZIE, ANGLICAN BISHOP OF CENTRAL AFRICA\n\nTHE FEAST OF HENRY TWELLS, ANGLICAN PRIEST AND HYMN WRITER\n\nTHE FEAST OF MARY LUNDIE DUNCAN, SCOTTISH PRESBYTERIAN HYMN WRITER\n\nTHE FEAST OF MENNO SIMONS, MENNONITE LEADER\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nHoly and righteous God, you created us in your image.\n\nGrant us grace to contend fearlessly against evil and to make no peace with oppression.\n\nHelp us, like your servants John Diefenbaker, Tommy Douglas, and Lester Pearson,\n\nto work for justice among people and nations,\n\nto the glory of your name, through Jesus Christ, our Savior and Lord,\n\nwho lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever.
