        "text": "The Right Honourable John G. Diefenbaker’s legacy is the dream of a united Canada, one which would find strength in its diversity. Regardless of whether he was in the House of Commons or a farmer’s field, Diefenbaker maintained his stance as being the voice of the “Average Canadian.” His perseverance in pursuing leadership in politics and his dedication to creating the Bill of Rights should inspire us all to work together to build a better Canada andto be active citizens.\n\nJohn George Diefenbaker, Canada’s 13th prime minister from 1957-63, was born in Neustadt, Ontario on September 18, 1895, and later died on August 16, 1979 in Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nAn articulate speaker and supporter of civil rights, Diefenbaker was a passionate defense lawyer before he turned to his attention to politics. During his campaigns, Diefenbaker called for “One Canada”, a united country, coast to coast, where everyone no matter their religion, race, or region were all equal under one name as Canadians. As one of Canada’s longest running Members of Parliament, he held the highest percentage of seats won in the House of Commons. While in office, he championed the Canadian Bill of Rights, appointed the first female cabinet minister and Indigenous senator, welcomed the first Chinese-Canadian and Ukrainian-Canadian members of parliament, and extended the vote to First Nations people in Canada. He later turned his attention to the international community and took a stand against apartheid, a system of legislation that upheld segregationist policies against non-white citizens of South Africa."
