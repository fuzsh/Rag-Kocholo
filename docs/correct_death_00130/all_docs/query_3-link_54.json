        "text": "December 14, 1956\n\nOttawa Coliseum\n\nChair: Dick Bell\n\nBattling illness, George Drew resigned in the fall. The stage was set for two of his former opponents to seek the leadership.\n\nTHE CONTENDERS\n\nJohn Diefenbaker ran for the third time as the best hope for breaking two decades of Liberal rule.\n\nFrom his campaign literature: \"BORN IN ONTARIO, BROUGHT UP IN THE WEST DIEFENBAKER IS FOURTH GENERATION CANADIAN WHO HAS MADE HIS MARK IN LAW AND POLITICS ... THE MAN OF THE HOUR AT THE TURNING POINT IN THE FORTUNES OF OUR PARTY\"\n\nDonald Fleming al\n\nTHE CONVENTION\n\nNew Brunswick Premier Hugh John Flemming and British Columbia MP George Pearkes officially nominated Diefenbaker on the floor.\n\nThe failure to include a French speaker cost him some Quebec supporters, according to reports. But other Quebec delegates paraded the floor with “We’re For Diefenbaker” signs on voting day.\n\nThe major development was when the province’s 300-plus delegates met and considered a unanimous anti-Diefenbaker push.\n\nFleming was preceded by a majorette and fife-and-drum band, while Fulton had bagpipers in advance of the candidate speeches.\n\nFulton said national unity was a pressing task for the party. Diefenbaker’s speech promised “fairness to all and favour to none.” Fleming discussed federal relations with the provinces and cities.\n\nSuccessful policy resolutions included:\n\nExtra funding for allowances for veterans without pensions and Old Age Security\n\nA health insurance plan\n\nA new Canadian flag\n\nUsing budget surpluses to reduce taxes\n\nAll liquor tax revenue assigned to the provinces\n\nSubsidies for exporting wheat to famine-affected areas\n\nA general foreign policy statement supporting NATO and the United Nations\n\nIndependent regulator for radio and television instead of the CBC\n\nTHE VOTE\n\nVoting began at 2:15p.m. Diefenbaker won a first-ballot victory.\n\n“I believe that with your help the Conservative party can do its part for good government in Canada,” he said. \"I want this party to speak for the underprivileged. I want each of us to be dedicated to the welfare of all the people.\"\n\nMORE\n\nAttempts to remove the word “Progressive” from the party name were rejected.\n\nNova Scotia Premier Robert Stanfield, elected just six weeks earlier, delivered a keynote address.\n\nAs the convention opened, Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent was playing golf at the famed Augusta National course with U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nOttawa Mayor Charlotte Drew awarded Drew a key to the city.\n\nDiefenbaker backers played the accordion and rewrote the words to “Coming Through the Rye” in support of their candidate.\n\nTotal cost was estimated at $76,000, including renovations to the Coliseum, TV installations, and the platform.\n\nA party memo recommended Ottawa as the location: \"At this particular convention, it is believed that the greatest hay will be made through the media of television ... the best mass market for television is in Eastern Canada.\"\n\nThis party declaration also passed:\n\n“We believe in freedom of worship, speech and assembly; loyalty to the Queen of Canada; and the rule of law. Believing these things, we hold, with history, that vigilance over our parliamentary institutions is the best guarantee of such traditional freedoms.\n\n“We believe the state should be the servant of the people and that our natural progress depends on a competitive economy which, accepting its social responsibilities, allows to every individual freedom of opportunity and initiative, and the peaceful enjoyment of the fruits of his labor.\n\n“We believe that progress and stability can best be achieved by building on the firm foundations of those things proved good by experience.\n\n“We believe in a Canada founded on these principles, a nation of many creeds and many cultures, united in its aims and accepting its obligations among the nations of the world.”"
