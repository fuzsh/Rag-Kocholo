        "text": "Mission\n\nThe Authority is a leader in providing quality, safe, secure, sustainable and affordable air transportation services to the airport’s customers and communities and be a driver of economic growth within Canada’s Capital Region.\n\nVision\n\nTo be the world class gateway for Canada’s Capital Region and an economic engine that drives prosperity for our community.\n\nPurpose\n\nBuilding on teamwork and sustainability, YOW safely connects people, moves goods, and creates economic prosperity for our community.\n\nStrategic Directions\n\nTo grow strategically\n\nTo increase the economic footprint of the airport within the National Capital Region\n\nTo optimize operational performance, ensuring safe and secure operations\n\nTo pursue excellence\n\nTo provide additional flight frequencies and destinations\n\nOrganizational Values\n\nThe Authority conducts its business with:\n\nResponsibility;\n\nSustainability;\n\nAccountability; and\n\nIntegrity.\n\nA Brief History\n\nWhile the first powered flight over Ottawa occurred in 1911, it would be nearly the 1920s before the landing field at Bowesville Road would become known as the Hunt Club Field.\n\nEarly in its history, the Hunt Club Field made its mark in aviation. When Canada celebrated its Diamond Jubilee of Confederation in July 1927, aviator Charles Lindbergh arrived in his “Spirit of St. Louis” Ryan N-X-211, landing on the small field, welcomed by some 60,000 spectators. The historic visit was commemorated when the site was renamed Lindbergh Field.\n\nWith the incorporation of the Ottawa Flying Club on January 14th, 1928, the industry gained momentum; the first airport licence was granted to the Club on July 26th of the same year, and the airfield’s name was once again changed – this time to the Uplands Aerodrome.\n\nIn November 1936, the first Ministry of Transport was formed by the federal government, with C.D. Howe at the helm. Minister Howe was tasked with developing connections to the rest of the country and with the British Commonwealth. To accomplish this daunting task, he established Trans-Canada Airlines in April 1937. The success of Trans-Canada was contingent on establishing a cross-country service, which would require suitable landing fields along the way. The Ottawa Flying Club, not financially able to make the necessary improvements to the landing strip, eventually abandoned the site. Fortunately, Laurentian Air Services, one of the oldest bush flying services in Canada, saved the day when they leased the airfield site in 1937.\n\nOver the next few years, enhancements were made to the site by Laurentian Air, including a hangar and other facilities, and the Ottawa Flying Club returned to the site under an extended lease. Ultimately, the work required to serve Trans-Canada proved too much and the Department of Transport purchased the 300-acre aerodrome from Laurentian Air. DOT set about, almost immediately, to construct new facilities and two hard-surfaced runways. On August 20th, 1938, Transport Minister Howe cut the ribbon inaugurating the Uplands Airport.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, the Department of National Defence acquired the airport land and established its own facilities. Uplands became a Service Flying Training School for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), and additional lands to the east of the airport were acquired for the eventual construction of five hangars and a military camp.\n\nOn August 1st, 1940, the British Commonwealth Air Training Program School opened at Uplands. The sky was filled with RCAF Harvards and various other training aircraft during the war, and many earned their wings and took their newfound talent to the skies over Europe.\n\nAt the end of the war, the military activity at Uplands did not diminish. In fact, with Canada’s commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Ottawa was set to become an important base for international flights. Runways 14/32 and 07/25 at 8,800 and 6,200 feet respectively, became operational at the end of 1951. One of the more enduring military roles that played out at Uplands was the 412 Squadron of the RCAF, which provided transport for many important visitors to the nation’s capital.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, combined military and civilian traffic gave Uplands the distinction of having the highest volume of aircraft movements of any Canadian airport, and made the air traffic control tower the busiest in the country. An amazing 307,079 takeoffs and landings were recorded in 1959 alone.\n\nCatering to civilian travel\n\nConstruction of the airport terminal building began in 1957. As the project neared completion, a military demonstration proved disastrous; a U.S. Airforce F104 Starfighter broke the sound barrier and virtually every window in the structure. There was also significant structural damage inflicted on the building. This mishap added approximately one year to the construction schedule, and $300,000 to the budget of $5 million. The terminal was finally opened by Prime Minister John Diefenbaker on June 30th, 1960.\n\nThe terminal, which was designed by local architects Gilleland and Strutt, was built to accommodate up to 900,000 passengers per year. To better accommodate different aircraft, the two main runways were extended in 1961; 14/32 to 10,000 feet and 07/25 to 8,000 feet.\n\nThe airport’s official designation was changed to Ottawa International Airport on August 24th, 1964.\n\n1975 was an important year for the region and the airport; the National Capital Commission opened the Airport Parkway, as an extension of Bronson Avenue, thereby providing a vital link between the community and the airport.\n\nBy 1980, approximately 2 million passengers per year were travelling through the airport – more than double its capacity. A renovation plan was announced in 1982 and ultimately unveiled in 1986. The renovated space included extensive use of skylights, glass and steel. According to architect Patrick Murray, “we wanted to bring back the excitement of coming to the airport”.\n\nFurther evolution included the airport’s control tower and radar service moving to the Combined Air Navigation Facility and Regional Training Centre, located off Limebank Road, in 1991.\n\nIn June 1993, the federal government officially renamed the airport Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International in honour of two of Canada’s Fathers of Confederation.\n\nOver to the Community\n\nIn the early 1990s, the federal government recognized the need for a national system comprised of safe, efficient and effective airports that would meet the needs of the communities they serve. To meet that need, the National Airports Policy was introduced in 1992. The Policy was officially launched in 1994 with the creation of local airport authorities across the country. Under the plan, the federal government would maintain its role as the regulator, but would change its role from owner/operator to owner/landlord.\n\nThe Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport Authority (OMCIAA) was established on February 1st, 1997 after the assembly of a 14-member, community-based Board of Directors which was tasked with overseeing the management of the airport. More commonly referred to as the Ottawa International Airport Authority (OIAA or the Authority), the organization is part of a 26-airport National Airports System."
