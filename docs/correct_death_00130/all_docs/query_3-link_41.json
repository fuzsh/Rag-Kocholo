        "text": "Nine stars\n\nA long-time student of Canadian politics, I was pleased to discover this book by John Ibbitson. In it, the author tells of two larger than life politicians—John Diefenbaker and Lester B. ‘Mike’ Pearson—who grew up in modest means and asceneded to the competitive ring of federal politics. While both men had vastly different lives, their passion for Canada and determination to make a difference while serving in government, led them to become two powerful prime ministers whose choices helped shape modern Canada. Ibbitson shapes his story as parallels biographies, eventually melding together when both men faced off across the aisle in Canada’s House of Commons. Brilliantly penned and with so many great vignettes, Ibbitson leaves the reader feeling informed.\n\nAs John Ibbitson opened his tome, he depicts the modest lives of both John G. Diefenbaker and Lester B. ‘Mike’ Pearson. Growing up in rural Ontario, they came from vastly different families and had different values stitched into their moral fabrics, but could be seen to have similar foci. While Diefenbaker knew he wanted to get into the law and making a difference, Pearson’s religious upbringing left no doubt he would have a spiritual presence wherever he went. Both boys used their academics to vault them to the top of the class, where Diefenbaker chose the law and Pearson history.\n\nContinuing the biographical narrative, the author explores many of the victories and foibles both men faced in their early careers. It could be said that they were destined to end up in the same place, though Diefenbaker was never sure he could get over the hump of an electoral victory, while Pearson wanted to remain on the bureaucratic side of Canadian politics. Ibbitson explores their various struggles and how both sought to change the Canada they knew growing up, with ideas on both domestic (Diefenbaker) and international (Pearson) policies along the way. Their passion for Canada could be seen and this helped them set their paths with Ottawa as the end result.\n\nWhile Diefenbaker found himself in the House of Commons first as a Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), he struggled to get his feet. He tried to fit in, though some of his colleagues were much sharper, more outspoken, and with little thought of the little man. Diefenbaker never forgot his roots, nor did he let it slip his mind that he was representing the common man back in his riding of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. Pearson, on the other hand, sought international control as a deputy minister in the External Affiars Department, where Canada cut its teeth on many an international conflict and sought to serve as arbitor between some of the larger powers of the day. Pearson had a great deal to say and was respected by those around him, as many wondered how long he would wait before joining the ranks of the Liberals in Parliament and serve as their leader.\n\nIbbitson examines the rise to leader for both men, something that Diefenbaker wanted but had a hard time achieving, while Pearson was almost handed the job when he was ready to take the plunge. Both sought to make significant changes to the Canadian political system and the country as a whole, which they would do in due time. It was when both men faced off against one another as leaders of their respective parties that things got truly intense. Diefenbaker, who had become prime minister leading the Progressive Conservatives to power in the late 1950s sought to make headway through a number of key changes to the system of governing and made sure that Canada had a keen place on the international scene. Diefenbaker’s key legacies included a Bill of Rights, ensuring the vote for Indigenous Canada, and opening up pensions for all Canadians. Pearson, in opposition, sought to support yet also cut his opponent down to size. These clashes could be said to be some of the best times in Canadian parliamentary history, which Ibbitson supports with his various vignettes.\n\nWhen the shoe was on the other foot, Pearson took his Liberals to victory in 1963 and made sure to change some of the key aspects of Difenbaker’s government, though a number of programs started by Diefenbaker continued into the Pearson era. Pearson ensured that Canada had a more friendly approach on the international scene and “Canadianised” the country with its own national flag. This contrasts of government styles and efforts is key to Ibbitson’s central portion of the book.\n\nWhile Pearson’s time in office was shorter than many might have hoped, Diefenbaker stood by, eventually losing the leadership when the party wanted fresh blood. He refused to retire, sitting on the backbenches for the rest of his life. An elderly statesman with a great deal to share, while Pearson drifted away into retirement and let other big names guide the Liberals into the late 1960s and beyond. The impact both men had in Parliament and Canadian history cannot be dismissed by anyone. Difenbaker received less than admirable play in the history books, though his decisions remain with Canada to this day, Pearson, seen more as the life-long political activist, has his mark on the international aspect of Canada’s govenerment over the years, but he was also there through many tumultuous moments.\n\nWhile John Ibbitson uses his excellent prose to depict both men, providing chapters to serve as time periods where both men and their efforts were gauged, neither man could have been said to have beaten the other in their personal and professional antics. Both served Canada well and sought to make a difference in their own way. Diefenbaker may have been the Prairie boy who never let the views of the little guy disappear, while Pearson had much more grandiose views when it came to how Canada should be seen. Both men loved their country and their jobs, something few politicians could be said to equal in today fragmented country and ideals!\n\nKudos Mr. Ibbitson, for this amazing book I thoroughly enjoyed!"
