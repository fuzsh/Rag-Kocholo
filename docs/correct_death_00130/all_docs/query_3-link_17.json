        "text": "SECRET\n\nAugust 12th, 1957\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRIME MINISTER:\n\nWhen we returned from London about a month ago, you asked me to have prepared a memorandum on the possibilities and means of diverting some 15% of Canadian imports from the United States to imports from the United Kingdom.\n\nIn discussion with Mr. Fleming and Mr. Churchill and officials in connection with the Commonwealth trade conference preparations, this problem was assigned to the Department of Finance. They have worked on it intensively and have revised their original paper to take into account comments from Trade and Commerce and External Affairs. They have now furnished me with their revised paper which I attach hereto.\n\nThe memorandum makes clear there are many serious difficulties. The pattern of our trade reflects far more than measures of commercial policy and indeed the latter have hardly been a dominant influence in the past decade. Consequently, to divert as much as 15% in the way considered would require quite drastic action.\n\nYou may like to think of having some study somewhat along these lines prepared in a form that could be published or that could form the basis of a detailed speech by one of your colleagues. It seems to me there would be some value in a good public understanding of the nature of the problems involved here. The matter of timing, however, is a very substantial one and perhaps it would be better to do this in Parliament on a suitable occasion.\n\nR.B.B.\n\nDownload PDF\n\n019082\n\nSECRET\n\nOttawa, September 7, 1957.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE MINISTER\n\nRoyal Visit -\n\nTelevision Programme on Sunday evening\n\nAs you may recall (our memorandum of August\n\n30), you were to discuss with the Governor-General\n\nthe question of the Queen's speech on the Sunday\n\nevening.\n\nWe have prepared in the Department the\n\nattached text. You will see that paragraphs 1,\n\n2, 3 and 7 are repeated in French. If this were\n\ndone, and given the speed at which the Queen\n\nspeaks, this material would provide a television\n\naddress of approximately ten minutes.\n\nIf you consider that the text is suitable\n\nI could pass it on to Lionel Massey for onward\n\ntransmission to the Queen.\n\nDRAFT\n\n019083\n\nSECRET\n\nOttawa, September 9, 1957.\n\nI am happy to be in Canada again. In 1951 Prince\n\nPhilip and I had the opportunity of seeing much of this\n\ncountry and meeting many of you. On the present visit\n\nmy stay will be short, so I welcome the more the opportunity\n\nof speaking to you in your homes, as I have been able\n\nto do before on Christmas morning.\n\n2. Near where I am sitting in Rideau Wall the ageless\n\nOttawa river speaks, as it winds its way past the Capital, of\n\nthe early march of Canadian history; and embraces on its\n\nshores the two great cultures, the combination of which\n\nforms one of the greatest assets of this country.\n\n3. Je suis heureuse de me trouver de nouveau au Canada.\n\nEn 1951 le prince Philippe et moi-meme avons eu l’occasion\n\nde voir une bonne partie de ce pays et de rencontrer un\n\ngrand nombre d’entre vous. Cette fois mon sejour sera\n\nde courte duree et c'est pourquoi j'apprecie tellement\n\nl’occasion qui m’est offerte de vous parler dans\n\nl‘intimite de vos foyers, comme j’ai pu le faire deja\n\nle matin de Noel.\n\n4. Non loin d’ou je suis en ce moment a Rideau-Hall,\n\nla riviere des Outaouais, en serpentant le long de la\n\ncapitale, nous rappelle les premieres heures de l’histoire\n\ndu Canada; ses rives sont marquees par les deux grandes\n\ncultures, dont le melange forme l’une des plus grandes\n\nrichesses de ce pays.\n\n2.\n\n019084\n\n5. Canada has been much blessed by Providence with\n\nwide acres, great forests, plentiful fisheries, and riches\n\nbelow the soil. But without the energies and skills of\n\nthe men and women of the country, these would form no\n\nmore than a promise. This is a busy and a prosperous\n\nland with great cities and many industries, but it is one,\n\ntoo, that has not neglected the spiritual and intellectual\n\nvalues. This morning I worshipped in Christ Church\n\nCathedral; and this afternoon I saw the pattern and\n\ncolour of the Gatineau Hills in autumn. Religion and\n\nbeauty are woven into life in Canada.\n\n6. La Providence a pourvu le Canada genereusement de\n\nvastes espaces, de grandes forets, d’abondantes pecheries\n\net d’un riche sous-sol. Mais sans l’energie et les\n\ntalents des habitants du pays, ces dons ne seraient\n\nqu’espoir. Terre active et prospere, ou s’elevent de\n\ngrandes villes et de nombreuses industries, le Canada\n\nn’en oublie pas pour autant les valeurs spirituelles et\n\nintellectuelles. Ce matin j’ai pris dans la cathedrale\n\nChrist-Church; cet apres-midi j’ai vu les collines de la\n\nGatineau dans leur splendide parure automnale. Religion\n\net beaute s’entrelacent dans l’existence des Canadiens.\n\n7. Tomorrow I shall take my part, as did my father, in\n\nthe proceedings of Parliament, the orderly and democratic\n\nmeans by which Canadians seek to find just and effective\n\nsolutions to the problems of the national and international\n\ncommunities.\n\n8. In many continents, in many capitals, Commonwealth\n\nparliaments perform their tasks of striving toward the\n\ngoals of freedom, of peace, and of human well-being.\n\n3.\n\n019085\n\nThese are amongst the bonds which draw together the many\n\ncountries of the Commonwealth. We are not an exclusive\n\nsociety: we exclude only the forces of tyranny and\n\naggression. Developed in freedom and fashioned by common\n\nagreement and understanding, the modern Commonwealth is\n\nmade up of many peoples and races. But it is no accidental\n\nor temporary grouping of countries, for it stands for\n\nlasting purposes and ideals.\n\n9. Speaking as I do now to my fellow Canadians,\n\nI like to recall the particular ties between the peoples\n\nof Canada and of the United Kingdom. These, for many of\n\nyou, are of tradition and ancestry; for a11 of you, of\n\nproblems shared and perils met; of common hopes and ideals.\n\n10. I look forward to returning to Canada next year\n\nto open the great St. Lawrence Seaway. I am happy to be\n\nwith you now and to give to you -- all of you, from sea\n\nto sea -- my best wishes for your own happiness and for\n\nthe continued well-being of Canada.\n\n11. J'envisage avec plaisir la perspective de\n\nrevenir l’an prochain pour inaugurer la grande voie\n\nmaritime du Saint-Laurent. Je suis heureuse de me trouver\n\nau milieu de vous et de vous offrir, a tous d’un ocean\n\na l’autre, mes meilleurs voeux de bonheur personnel et de\n\nprosperite nationale.\n\nDownload PDF\n\nOffice of the Prime Minister\n\nCanada\n\nPress Release Ottawa, July 9, 1957\n\nAnnouncement\n\nThe Prime Minister, the Honourable John Diefenbaker, announced this afternoon that Her Majesty the Queen had today graciously consented to open the first session of the Twenty-third\n\nParliament of Canada on Monday, October 14th.\n\n\"I am confident that all parties in Parliament will welcomes this unique opportunity to have Her Majesty open our Parliament and greet us as we take up our duties there\", Mr. Diefenbaker said, \"It will be the first occasion in our history when the Sovereign has personally presided over the opening of Parliament in Canada, It seems wholly appropriate that this historic event should take place on our Thanksgiving Day, which will make it possible for many more Canadians to see Her Majesty on this occasion than would otherwise be the case.”\n\nHer Majesty will arrive in Canada on the afternoon of Saturday, October 12th, and will leave Ottawa for the United States on the morning of Wednesday, October 16th. In view of the shortness of the Queen’s stay in Canada, it will not be possible for Her to visit any place other than Ottawa.\n\nThe usual formal proclamation on calling Parliament together on October 14th for the despatch of business will be issued in due course,\n\nCanada's French-Speaking Victory\n\nTwo nations with one government - that is Canada, the country that \"could not be,\" and is.\n\nOne monarchy with seemingly contradictory functions - that is the regime that Queen Elizabeth heads.\n\nBritish and French live side by side without mingling in Canada. Monarchies and republics stand shoulder to shoulder in the British-led Commonwealth of Nations, with a Queen at their head.\n\nNow to these crosscurrents add a new one: Queen Elizabeth, in Britain the defender of a Protestant faith, approving as her Viceroy in Canada a noted Roman Catholic.\n\nThere are other paradoxes in the naming of General George Philias Vanier to be Governor-General of the one-time Dominion, now a fully independent nation in a vast commonwealth. One is that he belongs to French-speaking Canada but was appointed by a Prime Minister, Mr. John Diefenbaker, who is perhaps more than usually pro-British among Canadians.\n\nGeneral Vanier's appointment is another milestone on the long march of French Canadians toward equality in fact as well as theory with the Canadian Anglo-Saxons. That some of the latter seem inclined to oppose the gains of their French-speaking countrymen is not a sign of opposition to equality itself, however, but of apprehension. Some of the Anglo-Saxon Canadians fear that the basis of equality and responsible government that has been preserved under British institutions in Canada may be lost in a gradual acquisition of political power by a community which employs religion, language, and culture as bulwarks against national fusion and allegedly as instruments for exacting privilege from the rest of the population.\n\nHowever, Canada has had two French-speaking Prime Ministers. They left records of great national service. They are honored today by both Canadas, which are nearer to being one because of them. General Vanier seems to belong in their company. His appointment should help French-speaking Canadians to identify their interests more closely with those not only of Anglo-Saxon Canada but of Britain and the Commonwealth.\n\nDownload PDF\n\n094344\n\nINSTALLATION OF THE GOVERNOR GENERAL\n\nHis Excellency Major-General Georges P. Vanier, D.S.O., M.C., C.D., was installed as Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Canada at a stately ceremony in the Senate Chamber on Tuesday, September 15.\n\nThe Governor-General Designate and Mmme [sic] Vanier arrived in Ottawa by train from Montreal on Monday evening, and were met by the Prime Minister, the Right Honourable John G. Diefenbaker and Mrs. Diefenbaker. Later on Monday evening, the Prime Minister gave a dinner in honour of the Right Honourable Vincent Massey, C.H., who retired as Governor General on Major-General Vanier's installation.\n\nMr. Massey left Ottawa by train for his home, Batterwood House, at Fort Hope, Ontario, an hour before the installation of his successor.\n\nThe First Battalion, Regiment of Canadian Guards, provided the Guard of Honour for the Installation of General Vanier.\n\nOn their arrival at the Parliament Building, the Prime Minister conducted General and Mme Vanier to the Senate Speaker's Chambers, and from there, a procession composed of members of the Governor General's Household and with the Chairman and Chiefs of Staff in attendance, conducted General and Mme Vanier to their places at the foot of the dais in the Senate Chamber.\n\nThe Ceremony commenced with the reading of General Vanier's Commission of appointment, signed by Her Majesty The Queen in Halifax on August 1, at the conclusion of her tour of Canada.\n\nThe Chief Justice, Hon. Patrick Kerwin, administered the three oaths of office--theoath [sic] of allegiance, the oath of office of Governor General, and the oath of office as Keeper of the Great Seal of Canada. Following the signing of the oaths, General Vanier took his place on the Throne, and, after curtsying to him, Mme Vanier took her place on his left.\n\n094345\n\nThe new Governor General then signed and sealed his first xxxxx Proclamation, bringing his Commission of appointment into effect. When the Proclamation was read, the band of the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps, Montreal, played the Royal Salute, and a 21-gun artillery salute was fired from Nepean Point as the Governor General's standard was raised on the Peace Tower.\n\nPrime Minister Diefenbaker, who sat during the ceremony at the head of the council table in front of the xxx dais, spoke of the significance of the installation ceremony, and the distinction that Major-General Vanier brought to the office of Governor General. He expressed best wishes on behalf of the government and people of Canada to Their Excellencies for their term of office.\n\nOn his departure from Ottawa, Mr. Massey was accorded a Royal Salute by the First Battalion Canadian Guards at the Union Station, and said farewell to the Prime Minister and Mrs. Diefenbakers, to members of the Cabinet and their wives, to the Chief Justice and Mrs. Kerwin, and the dean of the diplomatic corps, His Excellency Francis Lacoste, Ambassador of France.\n\nDownload PDF"
