Its economic activities range from the traditional farms of Old Order Mennonites to the innovative enterprises of \"Canada’s technology triangle.\" Compared with neighbouring counties of southern Ontario, Waterloo is also more urbanized and industrialized. A region of great historical interest not only to its own residents but also to researchers across Canada and elsewhere, it is notable for the activity of its local historians and genealogists reflected, for example, in the unbroken publishing record of the Waterloo Historical Society since 1912. The Waterloo Regional Project has created a bibliographic database with abstracts and detailed indexes for over 4,500 printed items - books, booklets, theses, reports, journal articles and chapters in books -- that relate to the history of Waterloo County prior to the introduction of regional government in 1973. This reference work has been designed to meet the needs of a wide range of researchers, including amateur historians, genealogists, house histoiy detectives, journalists, neighbourhood groups, landscape architects, museum workers, librarians, archivists, municipal officials and staff, as well as teachers and students at all levels from elementary school children to postgraduates. Elizabeth Bloomfield is an historical research consultant who uses computer- assisted methods to create information bases and research tools for urban, business and regional history. She has also directed the Guelph Regional Project and the Canadian Industiy in 1871 Project. Linda Foster and Jane Forgay are librarian-bibliographers who worked for the Waterloo Regional Project in 1991-92. The Waterloo Regional Heritage Foundation is an organization representing most historical and heritage societies in the Region of Waterloo and supported by the Regional Municipality. The Foundation chose to publish this volume to mark the 20th anniversary of regional government. .

What better legacy could the Foundation leave for this milestone than publication of Waterloo County to 1972: an annotated bibliography of regional history, compiled by Dr Elizabeth Bloomfield with Linda Foster and Jane Forgay? This annotated bibliography with its diverse and cross-referenced subject areas will provide a helpful and convenient tool for regional research. The resource material will assist not only the serious researcher but also the student, businessman or layman. In research, finding the source of information is often the most difficult task. The indexes of this bibliography volume, along with computer searches of its database, will relieve researchers of hours of work and allow them to concentrate on finding new information. I commend and praise the work of Dr Bloomfield, Linda and Jane. Their thorough searches of library collections and their concise annotations and detailed indexes of authors, places, topics, persons and organizations will lead users to exact sources of information. From these sources, one can trace our history and lead future historians into new fields perhaps presently ignored or under-researched. Patricia Wagner, Chair Waterloo Regional Heritage Foundation ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The production of this bibliography owes a great deal to the Waterloo Regional Project’s Research Associates, Linda Foster and Jane Forgay. Funding for the project allowed us to employ qualified librarian-bibliographers who also brought other abilities to the project, Jane in German language and Linda in Scottish history. Both were strongly dedicated to the project’s goals and went far beyond their formal job descriptions of searching library holdings, reading the material, writing abstracts, assigning index terms, and entering the data into the computer. Their passion for thoroughness and accuracy is reflected in the pages of this volume. Sharing the challenges of such a project has made us all firm friends. The interest and support of the project’s advisory panel are much appreciated. Two members were very closely involved throughout the project. Thanks are especially due to Susan Saunders Bellingham (Head of Special Collections, University of Waterloo Library) for her constant encouragement and key roles in chairing the advisory group, arranging working space for the team in the Arts Library, and facilitating financial support from the Waterloo Regional Heritage Foundation. And to Susan Hoffman who, with her colleagues in the Grace Schmidt Room, generously accommodated the team for the many months we worked in the local history collections of the Kitchener Public Library and the Waterloo Historical Society. Other members of the advisory group who advised and encouraged the team were Patricia Wagner (Waterloo Regional Heritage Foundation); Mary Johnston, Kathryn Lamb, Grace Schmidt and Ernst Ritz (Waterloo Historical Society); Erich Schultz (for the Wilfrid Laurier University Library and the Archives of the Eastern Synod, Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada); James Quantrell (City of Cambridge Archives); Scarlett Janusas (Regional Archaeologist); Mary Anne Kirkness (Elmira Library); Elizabeth Macnaughton (Doon Heritage Crossroads); Janet Seally (Waterloo Public Library); Kenneth McLaughlin and Gary Draper (St Jerome’s College); Garry Peters (Emmanuel Bible College); Reg Good (Conrad Grebel College Library); Lorna Bergey (Mennonite Historical Society); Diane Fitzpatrick and Ruth Lamb (Dana Porter Library, University of Waterloo); and Ron Lambert and Ryan Taylor (Waterloo- Wellington Chapter, Ontario Genealogical Society). We greatly appreciate the help given by all these and by others, including Rosemary Willard Ambrose, Tom Arnold, Gerald Bloomfield, Victoria Bloomfield, Jane Britton, Lorna Ferguson, Father John Finn, Virginia Gillham, Marion Hall, Norma Huber, Linda Kearns, Nancy-Lou Patterson, Marie Puddister, Lorraine Roth, Shelley Saunders, Bertha Thompson and Sandra Woolfrey. We are grateful to all librarians and archivists in more than 40 university, public and special collections for their co-operation and practical help. Ralph Daehn (now in Cataloguing in the University of Guelph Library) consulted on various aspects of the project and provided substantial assistance with data communication, notably in downloading of bibliographic information from the region’s three computerized library systems. For this service we thank him and also those who facilitated it, notably Ruth Lamb in the University of Waterloo Library, Herb Schwartz in the Wilfrid Laurier University Library, and Kathy Dutchak of the Kitchener Public Library. This publication and the Waterloo Regional Project itself were made possible by generous grants from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (Canadian Studies Research Tools Program), the Waterloo Regional Heritage Foundation, and The Good Foundation Inc. We thank officers and staff of these organizations for their assistance. INTRODUCTION Waterloo County (administered as the Regional Municipality of Waterloo since 1973) has several qualities that distinguish it from the rest of southern Ontario. It is a complex region settled by peoples from various ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Its diverse forms of economic activity range from the traditional farms of Old Order Mennonites to the innovative enterprises of \"Canada’s technology triangle.\" Compared with neighbouring counties of southern Ontario, Waterloo is also more urbanized and industrialized, its growth for the past century fuelled by manufacturing industry. Waterloo County is an area of great historical interest, not only to its own residents but also to researchers across Canada and elsewhere. It is notable for the activity of local historians and genealogists, and especially for the unbroken publishing record of the Waterloo Historical Society, founded in 1912. The contents of the Society’s annual volumes, as well as other printed materials relating to the history of settlement and development of Waterloo County from about 1800 to 1972, have now been abstracted and indexed, using a sophisticated methodology of creating research tools for local and regional history. The purpose of this bibliography is to provide clear guidance to printed sources of information on the history of Waterloo County so that users with various interests can know what items are likely to be useful and where they may be found. Here we introduce Waterloo County and the Waterloo Regional Project, outlining how this bibliography has been created and suggesting how it may be used. This reference work has been designed to meet the needs of a wide range of researchers, including amateur historians, genealogists, house history detectives, newspaper reporters, neighbourhood groups, landscape architects, museum workers, librarians, archivists, municipal officials and staff, as well as teachers and students at all levels from elementary school children to postgraduate researchers. WATERLOO COUNTY In 1972, Waterloo County had a population of about 260,000 in an area of about 530 square miles (134,000 hectares), occupying the middle section of the Grand River valley in midwestern Ontario. From 1850, Waterloo County comprised Waterloo Township (the largest, with 39,000 ha) in the centre, flanked by the townships of North Dumfries (19,583 ha) to the south, Wilmot (25,833 ha) and Wellesley (27,860 ha) to the west, and Woolwich (24,167 ha) to the north. The county area is surrounded to the east and north by Wellington County, while to the west and south its neighbours are Perth, Oxford and Brant Counties. Though closely connected with Wellington County in location, physiography and hydrography and in early district administration, Waterloo County’s history provides many points of contrast. Figure 1: Incorporated municipalities and villages, 1871. Named places each had at least 100 population in the 1871 census. Introduction Mii During the founding period of white settlement, organized group settlements were significant in and around the Grand River valley lands of the Six Nations Indians. Three important ethnic groups have shaped the history of Waterloo in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In the very early years of the nineteenth century, Penn- sylvania Mennonites purchased the German Company Tract as the first inland block of land to be settled by whites in Upper Canada; this later became Waterloo Township. Similar groups of Mennonites or Amish settled much of Woolwich Township to the north and Wilmot Township to the west. Still etched in the landscape, particularly of the former townships of Waterloo and Woolwich, is evidence of the distinctive pattern of land subdivision that, among other things, did not provide for surveyed road allowances. As the Mennonite pioneers intended a farm-based culture, townsites were not usually surveyed either. So the small hamlets and villages such as Berlin, Waterloo, Elmira and Hespeler began informally and grew organically at crossroads and millsit.es- The Mennonite cultural heritage includes many distinctive elements from folk art to food preparation. Those who adhere to the Old Order still maintain a visibly different culture and landscape in the north and northwest of the region. The well-established Pennsylvania Mennonite settlements attracted some of the thousands of German migrants who came to North America from the 1820s. Generally, those who came between the 1820s to the 1840s were from the southwestern German states and some were Catholics; later migrants tended to be Lutherans from the centre and east of Germany, including Prussia. There were also Polish immigrants from the late nineteenth century and others from central and eastern Europe in the twentieth century. These immigrants from Europe settled throughout the northern and central parts of Waterloo County, but particularly in the villages and towns. Berlin became the centre of an enclave of German language and culture in British Ontario. German newspapers and other printed materials were published and distinctive institutions flourished, such as musical societies and Evangelical, Lutheran and Swedenborgian churches. Migrants of Lowland Scots origin developed the south of the region, following the initiative of William Dickson in 1816 in founding the town of Galt and the township of North Dumfries. The Dumfries-Galt settlement had more in common with the directed settlements of Guelph, Fergus and Elora in Wellington County. Deliberately founded as a town, Galt was the largest urban centre of Waterloo County till the late 1870s, though Berlin was the administrative and judicial centre from 1854. In town and country, the Scots origin of the settlers was expressed in the styles and stone materials of farm buildings, houses, churches and factories. In ethnic composition, Waterloo County’s population became quite exceptional, compared with Ontario as a whole or with neighbouring counties. By 1871, the peak census year for rural population in most of southern Ontario, the four largest ethnic groups in Waterloo County and in Ontario as a whole were the Irish, English, Scots and Germans. But, in Waterloo County, people of German ethnic origin formed the largest group with nearly 55 per cent of the total, compared with just under 10 per cent in Ontario generally. Germans, including both those of Pennsylvania Mennonite and European German origins, greatly outnumbered the Scots (18 per cent), the English (12.6 per cent) and the Irish (8 per cent).

Sources: compiled from Census of Canada and Elizabeth and Gerald Bloomfield, Urban growth and local services: the development of Ontario municipalities to 1981 (Guelph, 1983). Introduction xu The population of Waterloo County grew quite rapidly from about 26,500 in 1851 to 38,750 in 1861, and then only modestly to reach 42,740 in 1881. In 1901, about 52,600 people were counted in Waterloo County, compared with 55,600 in Wellington County. In the twentieth century, Waterloo County has expanded steadily and on average at least twice as fast as neighbouring areas to reach a population of 126,000 in 1951 and 254,000 in 1971. In the 1991 census, 377,762 people were recorded in the Region of Waterloo. One factor in the steady growth of Waterloo County was the urban-industrial development that occurred from 1880 mainly around the poles of Berlin-Waterloo in the centre and Galt, Preston and Hespeler in the southeast. Galt was incorporated as a village in 1850, a town in 1857 and a city in 1915. Preston, a village from 1852, gained town status in 1900 while Hespeler, a village from 1859, was declared a town in 1901. Berlin, incorporated as a village in 1854, attained town status in 1871 and cityhood in 1912. Waterloo, a village from 1857, became a town in 1876 and a city in 1948. New Hamburg, a village from 1858, became a town in 1966. Elmira was incorporated as a village in 1887 and a town from 1922. Three other urban centres did not progress beyond village status: Ayr incorporated in 1884, Bridgeport in 1951, and Wellesley in 1962. Six smaller centres in the more rural parts of the county gained the more limited powers of police villages: St Jacobs in 1904; Hawkesville in 1906; Baden, Conestogo and St Clements in 1907; and Linwood in 1917. Berlin (renamed Kitchener in 1916) is an outstanding example of urban growth driven by manufacturing industry; it made the most spectacular gains in rank and size between 1871 and 1931 of any urban centre in southern Ontario. The proportion of Berlin’s population working in factories grew from 11 per cent to 22 per cent in 1881, 28 per cent in 1901 and 36 per cent in 1919. In 1943, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce described Kitchener as a \"microcosm of industrial Canada.\" As recently as 1986, the Kitchener Census Metropolitan Area still had the highest industrial proportion in the labour force of any major urban centre in Canada. In Waterloo County as a whole, a diversified industrial complex evolved, with large, medium and small enterprises producing a wide range of fabricated and consumer goods. The region’s factories employed significant proportions of women and girls as well as men and boys. For longer than in other Canadian centres, entrepreneurs were locals rather than outsiders though this began to change after about 1912. Waterloo County has consistently ranked among the most highly urbanized and industrialized regions of Canada while also maintaining a productive mixed farming system. The cultural and economic complexities of the region were recognized in the restructuring of its local government in 1973. Waterloo County was reorganized into the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, and fifteen municipal units were subsumed into seven lower-tier municipalities. Most notably, Galt was amalgamated with Preston and Hespeler to form the new City of Cambridge. Kitchener (absorbing Bridgeport) and Waterloo were each enlarged by annexing parts of Waterloo Township, while the remainder of Waterloo Township was split between Cambridge in the south and Woolwich Township in the north and east. Smaller urban centres were amalgamated with their respective townships -- Elmira with Woolwich Township, New Hamburg with Wilmot Township, Ayr with North Dumfries, and Wellesley Village with Wellesley Township. The main effects of regional restructuring on the municipal units of Figure 2: Incorporated municipalities and villages, 1971. Named places each had at least 100 population in the 1971 census. The inset shows the effect of restructuring lower-tier municipalities with the introduction of regional government in 1973. See also Table 1. Introduction XUll Waterloo County are summarized in Table 1, together with the population data from the censuses of 1871 and 1971. Though the number of formally incorporated places has been reduced by the regional reorganization of local government, Waterloo County has many villages and hamlets with rich historical associations. The fortunes of small communities have waxed and waned during the past two centimes. Central places with at least 100 population counted in the censuses of 1871 or 1971 are named in Figures 1 and 2. WATERLOO REGIONAL PROJECT This volume is one product of a larger project of creating research tools for regional and local history. The Waterloo Regional Project was conceived with the objectives of: * Increasing access to a large body of print and documentary materials on an important region that has great interest in its own right and can also illuminate larger themes in Canadian studies; * Supporting research by scholars from various subject backgrounds and the interests of community historians and members of the public and encouraging interaction among these users; * Facilitating use of computer-based research tools and finding aids by academic and community users by making finding aids available in both print and machine-readable formats and by demonstrating the flexibility and specificity of machine search and retrieval; * Co-operating with the efforts of local librarians, archivists and heritage groups in promoting awareness of the value of local history materials; * Refining the methodology of creating the research tools as a model for increasing access to materials on other Canadian regions and themes. During 1991-92, the Waterloo Regional Project team created a large bibliographic database of references to printed items about Waterloo County history up to the inauguration of regional government in 1973. The project was supported for eight months of 1991 by a Canadian Studies Research Tools grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. For eight months of 1992, a grant from the Waterloo Regional Heritage Foundation subsidized staff costs. These funds made it possible to employ qualified librarian-bibliographers. Computer-based methods were used to identify, abstract and index the bibliographic records and to make the information accessible in both printed and machine-readable formats. Project procedures were based on those designed for the Guelph Regional Project (1987-1989) which in 1990 won an Award of Merit for its innovative research tools from the American Association for State and Local History. A detailed account of this methodology was published as \"Building a better bibliography: computer-aided research tools,\" Canadian library Journal 46, 4 (1989): 239-249. The XUlll Introduction research tools that illustrate the project procedures were published as Guelph and Wellington County, a bibliography of settlement and development since 1800 (1988, 329 p.) and Inventory of primary and archival sources: Guelph and Wellington County to 1940 (1989, 628 p.). Between May and August 1991, the Waterloo Regional Project team practised and refined the methodology by indexing and abstracting over 1,250 articles published in the annual reports of the Waterloo Historical Society from 1913 to 1990. These items were described in great detail, to match the interest of historians and genealogists in precise information about places, people, organizations and themes. For example, we indexed names of 12,500 individuals mentioned in the articles and notes in the Waterloo Historical Society’s annual volumes, as well as the names of over 2,500 corporate organizations, such as businesses, churches, schools, clubs and societies. The results of the project’s first phase were printed in a limited edition for members of the advisory panel and others in the heritage community as Waterloo Historical Society bibliography (1991, 390 p). Next, the project team looked for all books, booklets, theses and reports that are relevant to the history of settlement and development of Waterloo County before 1973. We began with the results of an electronic search of the computerized catalogues of three major libraries in the Region of Waterloo -- the University of Waterloo Library, Wilfrid Laurier University Library and the Kitchener Public Library. Further searching in these and other libraries found other relevant imprints as well as articles in journals and magazines, chapters in books, printed reports, theses, newspapers, directories and gazetteers. Altogether, over 4,530 items are abstracted and indexed in this bibliography. Finally, the whole bibliographic database was edited for accuracy and consistency, in readiness for both print publication and release in computer-searchable formats. The main features of the project methodology are: * Inclusion and personal verification of annotated references to most kinds of printed and secondary literature relating to Waterloo County up to the introduction of regional government at the end of 1972. Books, booklets, theses, journal articles and shorter notes, chapters in books, special newspaper issues and series, and special reports published right up to the present are all included if they concern the history and development of Waterloo County before 1973. Virtually all items were located and personally examined by a member of the team. As well as the conventional bibliographic details there are abstracts or brief summaries of the scope of each item as index terms for subject headings for people, organizations, places and topics. * Computer methods including use of InMagic software for storing, searching and retrieving the bibliographic data and for formatting them into displayed and printed reports. Portable microcomputers were used in library settings to reduce time and transcription errors. * A record structure that can systematically describe all kinds of printed items relating to the region and is also appropriate for describing primary source materials in any later extension of the project. The record structure includes all the conventional bibliographic fields, a descriptive abstract, and assigned index terms and subject headings. The record structure is designed to be MARC-compatible, to match the Introduction xix MAchine-Readable Cataloguing systems used extensively in libraries and archives. Because of the computer methodology, items in this bibliography are also known as records. * Use of authority lists for authors, places, personal and corporate names and a thesaurus of thematic subject headings relating to regional history, with the assistance of Instant Authority software to maintain consistency. The thesaurus of subject headings was based on the National Library of Canada’s Canadian subject headings, elaborated to describe events, topics and emphases of local and regional history. * Inclusion of library symbols or location codes for each item, so that the bibliography serves as a union list of library holdings within the Region of Waterloo. We have included references to printed items relating to the region held in special library collections, usually only if these items are uniquely accessible in that collection and if their custodians are willing to grant ready access to users. Such special library collections include the Regional Archaeologist’s office, the library of Doon Heritage Crossroads, and various denominational archives and collections of rare books. Nearly 50 libraries holding relevant printed materials are listed in the final bibliography and at least one library location (often three or more) is noted for each item. For items not held in a library in the Region of Waterloo, the nearest outside library location is given. * Design for accessibilily to users in both machine-readable and print formats. The needs of a wide range of community users have been considered, especially through consultation with the project advisory panel consisting of local archivists, librarians, local historians, and representatives of historical and heritage organizations. Users should note that this volume is not concerned with what are usually called primary sources - original manuscripts, papers, or record groups created by individuals or corporate bodies such as businesses, churches, voluntary associations, municipal governments - that are usually held in archives rather than libraries. The methods used to create the bibliography are appropriate and may be extended to describe these archival resources in future. Meanwhile, researchers may depend on the useful guidance to collections of primary materials provided by Elizabeth Macnaughton and Pat Wagner in Guide to historical resources in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo (Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1989) and by Ryan Taylor in Family research in Waterloo and Wellington Counties (Waterloo-Wellington Chapter, Ontario Genealogical Society, 1986). Nor does this bibliography include references to individual maps, as we plan to produce a separate guide later. For maps and plans dating from 1867 or earlier, users may consult Joan Winearls’ Mapping Upper Canada 1780-1867: an annotated bibliography of manuscript and printed maps (University of Toronto Press, 1991). A bibliography of secondary literature can only include items that historians, other authors and researchers have written and had printed. Our aim is to provide a clear guide to what has been written and printed on the history of the region, through the thematic arrangement of the references and the abstracts and indexes. We have not set out to appraise the quality of the history or the writing. The omission or scant treatment of some subjects (themes, persons, organizations or places) should not be taken to mean that they were unimportant in the history of Waterloo County. The contents of the bibliography reflect the interests and perceptions of past historians XX Introduction and other writers. There may well be scope for interpreting many new subjects. Users of the bibliography will be able to judge the extent to which some topics of great potential have so far been neglected in the printed literature. We did try to include references to books, articles and chapters that refer to Waterloo County or its component communities in the context of larger themes or topics. So we searched abstracts, bibliographies, indexes and reviews and asked local authors for references to likely items. Our criteria for inclusion required that there must be specific and fairly detailed references to Waterloo County or one or more of its communities. However, we have probably missed some bibliographic references of this kind. We request details of such items that may be added to the bibliographic database and thus made accessible through electronic search. References to books, booklets and ephemera printed in Waterloo County before 1901 were included even if they did not specifically discuss local topics and communities. We have included such pre-1901 imprints as a form of co-operation with the Canadian Institute of Historical Microreproductions project, noting which items had been identified and microfilmed by CIHM. RECORD STRUCTURE A key feature of the project methodology is the finely indexed record structure which may be used also for describing and indexing primary and archival materials. The main fields used in handling bibliographic materials are listed (with their MARC codes in brackets where applicable): * unique retrieval key or record number (001) * main subject code, controlling sequence of records in printed Bibliography * document type * personal author/s (100) * corporate author, (110) * title of chapter/article etc that is part of a published book/journal * published title of book/joumal/report/thesis (245) * series * names of editors/s of book containing component chapters * place of publication * publisher * year of publication * details of collation including page length and illustrations, etc (300) * medium (340) specified if other than paper * alternate physical form, such as microform as well as paper (530) * abstract of scope and content in natural language (520) * library location symbols (535) * language, if other than English (546) * personal subject headings (600) * corporate subject headings (610) * topical subject headings (650) * places or geographic subject headings (stressing Waterloo County) * start date of the time span of subject matter (in relation to Waterloo County) * end date of the time span of subject matter (in relation to Waterloo County) Introduction xx a The sample computer record presented here illustrates the use of the various indexed fields in the structure of a record for B. Mabel Dunham’s Grand Biver. The numbers of subject headings (personal, corporate, topical and geographic) vary from item to item. Articles and notes published in the annual reports and volumes of the Waterloo Historical Society were indexed in great detail, to include names of all persons and organizations mentioned. About 50 other imprints, such as major histories of each municipality, were also indexed very intensively. Examples include Young’s Reminiscences of Galt and North Dumfries, Eby’s A biographical history of Waterloo Township. , Uttley’s History of Kitchener, Taylor’s Our todays and yesterdays, McLaughlin’s histories of Kitchener (with English), Cambridge and Waterloo, More than a century in Wilmot Township, Leibbrandt’s Little Paradise, 100 years of progress in Waterloo County: semi-centennial souvenir 1856-1906, Berlin Canada: a self-portrait of Kitchener (Tiessen reprint), Confederation number Diamond jubilee, 1927, Martin’s The early history of Jakobstettel, Taylor’s Family research in Waterloo and Wellington Counties, Macnaughton and Wagner’s Guide to historical resources in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, and Stewart, Kitchen and Dietrich’s The Maple Leaf journal: a settlement history of Wellesley Township. For the remaining 70 per cent of bibliographic items, indexing was somewhat less detailed: persons and organizations had to be more than simply mentioned for their names to be included in the subject indexes. The simple example of Miss Dunham’s book also shows how much of the original record in the database is printed out in the formatted bibliographic reference. The conventional elements of author, title, place of publication, publisher, year of publication and collation are concatenated with library location codes into the first paragraph of each reference. Most punctuation in this part of the entry is formatted in the report program, as is the bolding of the published title. The abstract of scope and content follows in a second paragraph, with the period or time span covered in the work. The various subject heading fields entered in the machine-readable record provide points of access to it through the indexes. Our bibliographic and typographic conventions are designed for simplicity and clarity of presentation, and generally follow The Chicago manual of style (13th edition). They are influenced by some constraints in the process of converting the InMagic record into camera-ready copy. In particular, the computerized sort order depends on the first 59 characters (including punctuation and spaces) of an entry. Thus we had to design the data structure and report formats so that the key bibliographic elements would be included. For this reason (as well as for clarity of presentation), we omit reference to missing bibliographic elements. For items in which the corporate author and publisher are the same, we do not repeat the full name. In some series of related items, such as directories, we insert the year(s) closer to the beginning of the title, to ensure that the references print out in chronological order. We use initial capital letters sparingly, only for proper names and incorporated entities (including titles of newspapers and journals) and the first word of sentences. We use periods to indicate abbreviations only if the final letter of the whole word is not used in the abbreviation. Thus we print \"St Jacobs\", \"Mr Breithaupt\", \"Mrs Kaufman\" or \"Dr Vardon\". But we abbreviate \"Reverend\" to \"Rev.\" and \"Company\" to \"Co.\" All authors’ names have surnames and forenames reversed, so that the author index matches the annotated references. xxu Introduction SAMPLE RECORD IN DATABASE AND AS PRINTED IN BIBLIOGRAPHY a) In Database REC 001 D-0310 CLAS A DOC B ADT 100 Dunham, B.

A popular account of the history of the valley by the former chief librarian of Kitchener Public Library. The treatment of the Six Nations Indians by land speculators, the arrival of the pioneers, and the development of the area into a modem industrial society are all vividly described. The book is illustrated with drawings by Edward Cleghorn. Period: 1800 - 1910 Introduction xsdii THEMATIC ORGANIZATION The numbered references in the printed bibliography are arranged by main theme or topic and then presented alphabetically by author, title and year of publication. This order allows the reader to browse among related items in subject areas as one can browse along the shelves of a well-ordered library. The sequence of entries in sections and sub-sections is determined by a special code in the machine- readable record. The number printed in the margin for each entry in the printed bibliography is not part of the machine-readable record. As in any display or printout of references from the database, the sequential numbers are relative to others retrieved according to specific selection criteria. In this bibliography, each reference is printed only once, in one of the following sections set out below. The various index terms provide additional points of access. Choosing the most appropriate thematic code to control the place of references in this printed volume was far from easy, given the infinite variety of scope and emphasis in the printed materials. Our intent was to assign a code based primarily on the main thematic emphasis of the work. Thus an article about railways across Waterloo County will be found under Transportation and Communications and a thesis about industry in Galt and Preston will be coded to appear with other studies of Manufacturing Industry in the major section on Economic Development. A report on heritage buildings of Bridgeport will be found under Buildings and Architecture under the major on the Landscapes and the Built Environment. Only where an item about a particular community touches on so many topics that it could not be assigned to any one thematic category would it be coded to appear in the final section for specific townships and incorporated urban centres. * General Surveys and Sources General surveys and descriptions of the whole region Directories and gazetteers Newspapers, including commentaries on their value as historical sources Other sources for regional history including bibliographies (except those of very specific themes or communities) * Settlement Processes Prehistory, aboriginal people and archaeology (mainly before 1800) Pioneer settlement, including travellers’ accounts, land surveys and land development, studies of place names (mainly in the nineteenth century) Urbanization and settlement systems (mainly since 1900) * Demographic and Social Structure General demographic studies Demographic data sources for genealogy, notably cemetery transcriptions and church registers Ethnicity, including language, distinctive social features and cultural symbols (but not churches and religion) Mennonite and Amish German Scottish Other ethnic groups XXIV Introduction Family history and genealogy Genealogies arranged in order by surname Social structure, class and elites General studies Biographies, autobiographies and obituaries of individuals arranged in order by surname * Economic Development Economic development processes Agriculture and farming Finance, land and capital Manufacturing industry, including studies of specific businesses Transportation and communications, including railways, roads and highways, telephone, postal and radio systems Trade and commerce Trade catalogues * Landscapes and the Built Environment Natural landscapes, including conservation movements Buildings and architecture, including conservation and restoration efforts for specific buildings and heritage districts Urban environments, including planning policies * Cultural and Social Institutions Schools and education Colleges and universities Literary works Libraries Music and performing arts Visual arts, including folk art and handicrafts Folklore, pastimes and festivals Food customs and cookbooks Churches and religion Mennonite, Amish, Brethren in Christ, Missionary Baptist Catholic Anglican Evangelical and United Brethren Lutheran Methodist Presbyterian Swedenborgian Other churches and religions Sports and recreation Voluntary associations (except historical and heritage) Heritage and historical associations and projects * Government and Politics Definition of areas and jurisdictions in 19th century Restructuring local government from the 1960s Administration of justice: law, order and police Local government and services Military history Politics (municipal, and local aspects of provincial and federal politics) Introduction xxv * Specific Townships and Urban Centres Ayr, Bridgeport, Dumfries (North) Township, Elmira, Galt (including some combined studies of Galt, Preston and Hespeler which joined to form Cambridge in 1973), Hespeler, Kitchener (Berlin to 1916; including some studies of both Berlin/Kitchener and Waterloo), New Hamburg, Preston, Waterloo (village, town, city), Waterloo Township, Wellesley Township (and village), Wilmot Township, Woolwich Township * Local Imprints, published or printed in Waterloo County before 1901, are listed in brief form, with references to the fully annotated references in the body of the bibliography LIBRARY LOCATIONS Library location symbols follow the National Library system, and are elaborated for more specialized or branch libraries within the Region of Waterloo. All symbols and libraries are listed below and on the bookmark provided with this volume. For articles and notes in the Waterloo Historical Society annual reports and volumes, we have simply entered the word \"all\" in the location field. The two university libraries, the Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge public libraries, branches of the Waterloo Regional Library system and the City of Cambridge Archives are all believed to hold sets of the Waterloo Historical Society volumes.

A few Mennonite history items are held only in library collections of Bluffton College, Ohio; Goshen College, Indiana; or Lancaster County Historical Society, Lancaster, Pennsylvania. INDEXES The various subject headings entered in the index fields of the record structure provide additional points of access to bibliographic items according to their alternative and more subtle characteristics and subject areas. These index terms are also important in electronic searching of the bibliographic database. The average article from the Waterloo Historical Society volumes is indexed in the database with at least 20 personal subjects, eight corporate subjects, six places and six topical subject headings. Most other items have fewer personal and corporate subjects and more topical subject headings but about 50 books or reports are indexed in great detail, some having over 500 personal subjects and more than 200 corporate subjects each. Entries in the author index, compiled from all in the AUT field, allow users to find works by any one of over 1,900 personal authors represented in this bibliography. It should be noted that we standardized the forms of authors’ names when we knew that slight variants referred to the same individuals. Compiled from subject headings in the SUT field according to a thesaurus of terms for regional and local history, the subject heading index has a controlled vocabulary of nearly 700 terms. This index is particularly useful for gaining additional points of access to the resources of the bibliography. For example, an article primarily concerned with the pioneer period of settlement in Waterloo Township would be Introduction xxuii programmed to print out among other works on Pioneer Settlement. But in assessing the scope and content of the article, we might have found that it contained important material on the ethnicity of the settlers, the migration process and the establishment of churches and schools. We would then have included in its machine-readable record the subject headings for \"Settlers, Pennsylvania\", \"Migration process\", \"Churches, Mennonite\", \"Schools, Rural\" and \"Landowners\". The sequential number of the reference thus appears under each of those index entries in the printed volume. A place index of over 1,000 geographic locations was compiled from the SUG field in the record structure. Urban centres such as Berlin/Kitchener, Galt, Waterloo, Preston, Hespeler, Elmira, New Hamburg and the five townships have at least 300 entries each in the place index. But smaller places have surprisingly large numbers of entries: Ayr (240), Baden (183), Bamberg (183), Blair (146), Breslau (138), Bridgeport (209), Conestogo (138), Doon (186), Erbsville (419), New Dundee (154), St Agatha (148), St Clements (101), St Jacobs (217), and Wellesley (125) all have at least 100 references each. Places located within Waterloo County receive primary emphasis in the index and are not followed by \"Ontario\", \"Ont.\" or \"ON\". Places outside the region may be included when apparently significant, as sources of migrants for example. Foreign place names usually begin with the country or national name, then the name of an intermediate province or county, with the locality name last. Thus the place of origin of some of Berlin’s pioneer settlers would be expressed as \"Germany, Baden\" with smaller locality names sometimes added, such as 'Wilferdingen\" or 'Weiler\". Locations in the United States are specified by state name first, then county, city or village, such as \"Pennsylvania, Lancaster County\". * Compiled from entries in the SUC field of the record structure, the index of corporate subjects contains about 4,700 names of organizations such as businesses, churches, schools, clubs or municipal governments. Most corporate entries have only one to three references each but the variety of corporate entities and the numbers of citations for some of them are illuminating. About 315 corporate bodies are mentioned in least ten records, 60 of these in at least 25 records. Most commonly mentioned are the Waterloo Historical Society (193), German Company (91), Grand Trunk Railway (79), Doon Pioneer Village (67), University of Waterloo (66), St Jerome’s College (63), Six Nations Indians (62), Mutual Life Assurance Co. of Canada (54), Berliner Journal (51), Knox’s Presbyterian Church, Galt (47), Central Presbyterian Church, Galt (46), Kitchener Public Library (46), Economical Mutual Fire Insurance Co. (44), Berlin Board of Trade (43), Berlin Town Council (43), Galt Collegiate Institute (42) and Kitchener City Council (42). We tried to standardize the references to these organizations, choosing the most commonly used name if possible. Users should note that rural schools are identified by their School Section number within each township before the reorganization of boards of education in the 1960s. Thus the nine references to the Maple Grove School are given under 'Waterloo Township, S.S.#20, Maple Grove\". The personal subject index, compiled from the SUP field, lists about 21,500 names of individuals identified as subjects of the works listed in this bibliography. This is an impressive number of people, though we should remember that probably well over 750,000 different individuals lived in Waterloo County at some time before 1972. Most of these persons are mentioned in only one item each. But nearly 500 are mentioned as subjects in at least ten items each, and almost 100 of these in at least 25 items each. The persons mentioned most often are Benjamin Eby (in 149 items), William Dickson xxviii Introduction (101), Absalom Shade (94), John Erb (90), E.W.B. Snider (90), Richard Beasley (80), Abraham Erb (64), Jacob Erb (64), Jacob Hespeler (61), Henry William Peterson (60), James Young (59), B. Mabel Dunham (56), L.J. Breithaupt (55), W.D. Euler (55), Jacob Y. Shantz (54), D.B. Detweiler (53), the Rev. Frederick Bindemann (52), Otto Klotz (52), W.H. Breithaupt (51), and Moses Springer (50). As with the author index, we tried to standardize the form of personal names, but we did so cautiously. For example, only when Mr Eby, B. Eby and Benjamin Eby were positively known to be the same person, did we standardize all citations to the form that appeared most commonly in the literature or was least ambiguous. When we could not be fairly certain, we left the alternative renderings, in the hope that local historians and genealogists will be able to give definitive advice. If at all possible, we have tried to standardize personal names to include at least one full forename and the initial of a middle name. Women’s names can pose problems, especially for researchers who would like to raise the profile of women as historical subjects. In a fair proportion of the references that name women at all, they are identified only as married to their husbands. Where possible, we modified this in the authority list, to include a woman’s own name (and often her patronym as well) and to retain a reference to her husband. For example, we expanded \"Breithaupt, L.J., Mrs\" to \"Breithaupt, Emma Devitt (Mrs L.J.)\". We were able to do this for several hundred women’s names. To implement this convention for all women named in the database would involve considerably more research. As a result of creating the Waterloo Regional History Bibliography in print and electronic formats, we hope that: * Groups and individuals can better assess the significance of their subjects and know where to go for the most useful source materials; * New research on historical themes will be stimulated by the project’s very detailed indexing of the published literature; * The general level of historical awareness in the community will be raised by facilitating access to historical materials; and * Efficient use of computer-based research tools and finding aids will be encouraged in future studies of the region’s history. We welcome any points of constructive criticism, large or small, which will guide us in revising the bibliographic database.
