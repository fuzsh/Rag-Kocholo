        "text": "John Diefenbaker was the 13th Prime Minister of Canada, serving from 1957 to 1965.\n\nDiefenbaker became the leader of the Progressive Conservatives in 1956. Progressive Conservative victories in the general elections of 1957 and 1958 catapulted Diefenbaker to the position of Prime Minister and unparalleled levels of popularity. Diefenbaker was strong in his support of civil rights; many minorities gained government positions, the Canadian Bill of Rights was passed, and the right to vote was given to First Nations and Inuit peoples. The Prime Minister stood strong against the civil rights abuses of both South Africa and the United States.\n\nThe domestic decline in the latter nation led to Diefenbaker promising a strong Canadian nation, capped off by the detonation of Canada's first nuclear weapon in 1963. Ever ambitious, Diefenbaker took some of America's role in world affairs, including sending troops to the Middle East and Vietnam to support the British.\n\nThe bloodshed abroad, as well as an economic downturn, resulted in popular opinion going against Diefenbaker. He managed to limp along until 1965, when the election crisis in America caused a successful vote of no confidence and subsequent election in Canada. Diefenbaker and the Progressive Conservatives would be defeated by Lester B. Pearson and the Liberals."
