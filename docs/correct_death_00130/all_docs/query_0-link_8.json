        "text": "Archive 1\n\nI posted a comment to the discussion section on the page for that party, but I see from the banner that discussion should take place here, so I'll post my comment here - I was wondering if maybe that party shouldn't be considered Christian Democratic? From their platform and description, it looks like their socially-conservative/economically-left-wing views could be viewed as being on the radical side of Christian Democracy, but I would like to know what others might think on that point. 24.32.220.158 James\n\nCurrently the page says \"All names should be in English.\". Is this intended to apply to Quebec provincial parties? Looking at Category:Provincial political parties in Quebec, it seems we normally use the French name, even if there's a commonly used official English name, such as the Quebec Liberal Party having the name Parti libéral du Québec. --Rob\n\nWikipedia's own naming convention policy says articles should have the titles in English. My own opinion is that they should be in English, but if consensus is to drop that line, I'll abide by that. Ardenn\n\nSee: Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English) --Ardenn\n\nIt makes sense to me that the French party names should be in French, as is most common here in Canada. Does the Bloc even have an English name? If so, I've never heard it. People are going to be looking for the party names as they are referred to in the news and in conversation, not according to \"wikipedia naming conventions\" Moonbug\n\nTo be clear, the convention on Wikipedia is not that a name must be in English — it's that the name must be what a typical speaker of English in the appropriate country would most easily recognize. In Canada, there are unquestionably a lot of cases — Bloc Québécois, Parti Québécois, Action démocratique du Québec, etc. — where a speaker of Canadian English would more naturally recognize the original French name than an English translation, so those should, and do, stay at the French titles. In other cases, such as Quebec Liberal Party and Rhinoceros Party of Canada, a normal English speaker in Canada uses names that are translated into English, so those are at the English titles.\n\nBut the defining characteristic in Wikipedia policy is not that the words necessarily have to be in English. The title merely has to be whatever a speaker of the appropriate English dialect would most likely recognize as the usual name of the topic in actual day-to-day usage. I sincerely doubt that there's one single solitary person in this country, regardless of their primary language, who would expect a Wikipedia article about the party of René Lévesque and Jacques Parizeau to be titled \"Quebecker Party\", frex. And neither would anybody expect the party of Françoise David and Amir Khadir to be titled \"Quebec in Solidarity\", nor the party of Mario Dumont to be titled \"Democratic Action of Quebec\". Even a unilingual English speaker would look at those titles and think we'd gone insane. Bearcat\n\nFor those joining this section's discussion, it is in regards to the line in the \"Naming conventions\" section that currently reads: \"Political parties: As their common name is. Such as the Alberta Greens, not Green Party of Alberta.\" The section above (regarding English or French names) is a separate discussion. --Ckatz\n\nThe party articles should really be named with their proper names, with redirects from the common names. What's currently proposed is the opposite - any particular reason why? --Ckatz\n\nCurrent policy says to use the common name, and re-direct to the proper name. Ardenn\n\nIndeed. See Joe Clark. The article is not \"Charles Joseph Clark\". However, let's not assume that the common name is the English name. The Parti Quebecois, Bloc Quebecois, Quebec Solidaire and Action Democratique du Quebec do not even have English names, and it would make no sense to translate them. Real Caouette's party is now commonly called the Ralliement creditiste, even though, at the time, some English-language newspapers called it the \"Social Credit Rally\". I think the only real question is, what is the common name of the Liberal Party of Quebec/Parti Liberal du Quebec? The article currently uses the French name as the common name, and I am not sure that that is the correct conclusion. Ground Zero | t\n\nI can concede that the PQ name should possibly stay french. But the Liberal party should be in English. Ardenn\n\nWhich \"current policy\" - Wikipedia, or just this project? If it's the latter, it should be discussed, as this is different from the French-English debate above. --Ckatz\n\nIt's the guideline, I posted the link in the above section. Ardenn\n\nI believe there's a slight misinterpretation of the guideline. What you're referring to applies to common names, and using the most common version. This would include English translations, the most common spelling, and so on, and it is more appropriate to the discussion over French vs. English names. That's a different issue from the question of what to label a political party. The project page's example (Green Party of Alberta vs. Alberta Greens) sides with the popular name, which is perhaps not the best approach. Using that same example of the Greens, their own web site is titled \"Green Party of Alberta\", and there are numerous references to that title throughout the page. I'd think that the natural choice would be to use the official party title, as registered with Elections Canada, along with redirects from all the common names. Something to discuss, before the project adopts it as a policy. --Ckatz\n\nFor that article, that's a good point. For the French vs English, we need to keep the guideline in mind. --Ardenn\n\nYes, but let's keep this discussion on track. If there's no objection, I'd like to revise the naming convention to call for official party names, as I described earlier, along with appropriate redirects. --Ckatz\n\nThat's fine with me. We can debate the English bit still. Ardenn\n\nGiven that no-one has objected to the proposal, I've revised the \"Political parties\" naming convention as follows: \"*Political parties: By their official name, as registered with Elections Canada, accompanied by redirects from all appropriate common names. (Example: article is Green Party of Alberta, with a redirect from Alberta Greens.)\" --Ckatz\n\nSo should Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist) be a redirect to Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada instead of the other way around? (Please say yes; I've been dying to do this since I became an editor). Carolynparrishfan\n\nWhile I think it is a noble endeavour to create articles on all of the parties on the List of political parties in Canada, we should remain aware that there are some editors who do not agree that every party should have an article. There have been attempts to delete articles on small parties on the basis that they are \"not notable\". Indeed, the AfD was successful on Direct Access Democracy Canada, an attempt to create a new party that nominated one candidate in 2004. The article outlined the party's policy, which was fairly well-developed for a fringe group. creating articles for fringe parties could be wasted effort if the articles are subsequently deleted. Any thoughts on how to avoid this? Ground Zero | t\n\nMy feeling is, we only create it, if they're registered with Elections Canada, or the provincial elections office. Ardenn\n\nI'm not certain I agree with this. There are some unregistered parties that have been around for years, and that are obviously \"notable\" in their local scene. I could point to the Humanist Party of Ontario as an example -- they've been fielding candidates since the 1980s, but have never sought official party status. CJCurrie\n\nThat could be the flip side of the coin. If they've done one or the other, the article is fine to be created. Ardenn\n\nWhat is the minimum number of candidates that an unregistered party has to field to qualify for an article, then? There are lots of \"parties\" that fielded only one or a few candidates in the days when you could represent yourself in an election as being a candidate of a party without going through any formal registration process. Ground Zero | t\n\nGood question. I'd say it would most certainly need more than 1. My gut says they'd have to run 5, but then that's just an arbitrary number. Ardenn\n\nOnly problem is that that creates an inequality in that today, Elections Canada will register a party that runs only one candidate. - Jord\n\nIf they're registered, that's the threashold for me. If they're not registered, then I'm not sure. Ardenn\n\nYes, but the courts ruled only a few years ago you needed only one candidate to be registered; prior to that you needed 50 for many years. How is a party that registers one candidate in 2006 under the new rules and gets registered more notable than a hypothetical party that ran 49 candidates in 1988, 1993 and 1997? - Jord\n\nAt least if they're registered, it's a sort of commitment. It's better than not being registered. Ardenn\n\nI usually follow the standard of \"is there enough material to write a decent article\". If the party in question is just one person's vanity project, the answer will usually be \"no\". CJCurrie\n\nThat's another good rule. We don't want perpetual stubs. Ardenn\n\nI just wanted to alert this Wikiproject that User:Durin has been removing party logos from all templates because of so-called \"fair use policy\" (his explanation here). The template for federal political parties is now just a bunch of words, as opposed to what it was before.[1] He seems to be going after all templates that are like this. Is it likely that political parties in Canada will sue Wikipedia for using their logo in a template? Do the template still look any good without logos? -Royalguard11Talk\n\nIt's not a question of whether or not an individual organization will sue or not, in a particular jurisdiction. Nor is it a \"so-called\" fair use policy - it's a Wikipedia policy. (I can certainly understand your concerns, though, and I empathize with the frustration at not being able to use images as we see fit, but it's what we have to work with.) --Ckatz\n\nWell you have some partially good advice, lets work to change the policy, since it's all user created, and the users that created seem to love rules and bureaucracy, lets get it amended --Cloveious\n\nI call the members of the community who work on articles related to political parties and politicians that are Canadian related to vote on a consensus to keep political party logos in templates, provided those templates are not used in a defamatory matter, and are used on relevant pages, that further the goal of creating an encyclopedia.\n\nArticle #9 which was used to remove the logos from the templates, comes complete with it's own notwithstanding clause. I have pasted the relevant clause.\n\nExceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis if there is a broad consensus that doing so is necessary to the goal of creating a free encyclopedia (like the templates used as part of the Main Page).\n\n--Cloveious\n\nAgree. I believe the use of the party logos in this manner actually falls within the definition of Fair Use (both legal and WP) because it is specifically in the context of presenting information on those parties. (Although I'm sure there are folks who see it differently, I believe they are mistaken.) —GrantNeufeld\n\nAgree per above. —Nightstallion (?)\n\nOppose The rule is against having a logo specified (e.g. hardcoded) in the template. You can still have a logo visually appear inside an info box (made by template). It just doesn't automatically appear in every transclusion of the same template. I want a specific example of something we can't do now, which we should be able to do. Specifying fairuse images in a template is bad, because it means the template can only be transcluded in cases where a clear fair use rationale can be made. We're essentially making templates \"unfree\" and restricted, which seems pointless. For instance, such unfree templates could never be transcluded ouside of article space. --Rob\n\nOppose, not because I don't want to debate this issue, but instead on the basis that this is not the correct forum for such a discussion. I agree with Rob's reasoning above. I'd also add that this straw poll is not exactly in keeping with the clause quoted above, as we cannot claim to have a \"broad consensus\" when the question is only posed to a very small number of community members. It would be more appropriate to take up this discussion at the talk page for the policy, or somewhere similar, so that any conclusions are reached with the involvement of the wider Wiki community. (That aside, I'd say that - as nice as it would be to have logos - they're certainly not necessary for the template. There was an argument posted a little while back suggesting that many people identify the parties by their logos, and not by their names. If there's proof of that assertion, please present it - otherwise, I would find it highly unlikely that such a thing were true. If it were, then we would certainly see something to reflect it on the ballots and in official Elections Canada publications of results.) --Ckatz\n\nAgree. Using the logo of a political party in such a way is fair use. It makes the page more visually appealing, and more likely to resonate with viewers of the page. Moonbug\n\nI've made a proposal to split the existing {{Canada-politician-stub}} type, which is qetting quite large. If you have any objections, modifications, or additions (or offers to help with the heavy lifting), please comment there. Alai\n\n\"All names should be in English.\"\n\nAfter reading that quote, I thought that we were going to have to cange Jean Chrétien to John Christian. NorthernThunder\n\nHello. The WikiProject Council has recently updated the Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory. This new directory includes a variety of categories and subcategories which will, with luck, potentially draw new members to the projects who are interested in those specific subjects. Please review the directory and make any changes to the entries for your project that you see fit. There is also a directory of portals, at User:B2T2/Portal, listing all the existing portals. Feel free to add any of them to the portals or comments section of your entries in the directory. The three columns regarding assessment, peer review, and collaboration are included in the directory for both the use of the projects themselves and for that of others. Having such departments will allow a project to more quickly and easily identify its most important articles and its articles in greatest need of improvement. If you have not already done so, please consider whether your project would benefit from having departments which deal in these matters. It is my hope that all the changes to the directory can be finished by the first of next month. Please feel free to make any changes you see fit to the entries for your project before then. If you should have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you. B2T2\n\nHold on, here !!!!!!!!\n\nDrew and Frost, being called \"anti-French, anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant\" is a very, very broad and general statement. I can not see any specifics in the article, only vague references to 'strains' of the above thought process. GROSSLY UNFAIR !\n\nThe author has these 2 men convicted without citing any evidence of his charge. It may be better to say, that Drew and Frost were 'thought to have anti-so and so tendencies by this academic/advocate'. Or better yet, to say that this is what they did/did not do/did not support that lent credence to the belief that they were anti-this or that.\n\n207.144.205.124 07:39, 1 December 2006 (UTC)Eric207.144.205.124\n\nSeems someone's added the provincial flag of the birth place and death place of every PM to their info box? Is this really wise considering most provinces just used the Union Jack until well into the 20th C? Kevlar67\n\nHi Folks:\n\nIt looks like you put a lot of effort into making the Canadian MP infobox. I would suggest though, that it follows more of the standard of the Infobox Politician (IBP). Currently, there isn't a provision to make a multiple office citation, like IBP. As well, the portfolio section is not set-up to have term dates (yes there is term2 start/finish, but that should be reserved to offices). A better descriptor for portfolio term would be pterm. That way, we could just import the IBF categories and have the same flexibility that that box offers. This came up, when I tried putting David Lewis (politician)'s leadership info, and it looked like whoever added his second term as an MP, added it in the Portfolio term section. I think the proposal i'm suggesting should fix this. I think we should also have four or five portfolio's, because many of these politicians held several like C.D. Howe, Marc Lalonde, Allen MacEachen to name a few. What do you think? Abebenjoe\n\nWikiProject Government of Canada and Wikipedia:WikiProject Political parties and politicians in Canada are very similar and sometimes overlap. I propose that they are both merged to Wikipedia:WikiProject Canadian Politics (as a full WikiProject) or Wikipedia:WikiProject Canada/Politics (as a task force of WikiProject Canada). Any thoughts? Greeves (talk • contribs • reviews)\n\nI think that makes sense. There will still be a few policies that will be different between the politician articles and the structure articles, but those would be easy to differentiate between under one Wikiproject. I don't think it makes a big difference whether we put it at WikiProject:Politics or WikiProject:Canada/Politics. Either way we will be treated as a sub-project by the v1.0 assessment team. --Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nBut do you think it should be as a task force (Wikipedia:WikiProject Canada/Politics) or a child project (Wikipedia:WikiProject Canadian politics)? I'm leaning towards the task force myself. Also, could we throw WikiProject Electoral districts in Canada into the mix too? Greeves (talk • contribs • reviews)\n\nAgainst of merging it to Wikipedia:Wikiproject Government of Canada, because of the provincial parties and provincial politics. I would prefer Wikipedia:Wikiproject Canadian politics as Greeves suggested above.--JForget --\n\nI agree that \"Wikiproject Canadian politics\" is our best name. Existing projects like \"WikiProject Electoral districts\" could become task forces of the new project. I say we let this proposal sit for a bit longer and if no one objects, we go through with it. --Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nI oppose any merge. The two projects have very distinct purposes. GreenJoe\n\nThey have \"distinct purposes,\" but they could easily be one project. WP:POLITICS is not two projects. Greeves (talk • contribs)\n\nSeeing as there has been no discussion in over a year, and no further movement towards a project merge, should this merge proposal be withdrawn? Dl2000 (talk)\n\nI haven't spotted a Wikiproject:Quebec politics or any similarities, so I've posted it here. I've recently started created articles on former Quebec provincial electoral districts (i.e Dorchester, Beauce, Megantic, etc.) after all the current districts have been done. I've merged some of them to the current districts or at times merged two or more into one. See Category:Former Quebec provincial electoral districts and Category:Quebec provincial electoral districts.JForget\n\nThere is a listing for John A. Dawson, in Pictou riding, Nova Scotia which someone may want to disambig. It is the wrong guy. --Stormbay\n\nDoes this mean we should rename Jean Chretien to John Chretien? NorthernThunder\n\nThe debate about how to organize the colours of historical Tory parties in tables has started up again at Template talk:Canadian politics/party colours in case anyone here is interested. --Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nHello, I am from Wikipedia:WikiProject Succession Box Standardization (WP:SBS), a project group that works on cleaning up succession boxes across Wikipedia, and standardizing them to meet a specific set of rules. I realized a number of days ago that your group has a LOT of templates currently in use, most of which do not fall under the guidelines we are attempting to standardize across the mainspace. It seems that there would be little objection to changing the actual succession boxes to the standard format, but the objections arise from the colored headings that this project currently uses. I have become quite adept at creating and working with headers and would like to offer my help in making a more standard header that would allow you to use just one template instead of 16+, as you currently do. In the meantime, I'd like to get some feedback from you and see what kind of ideas you all have. The header Template:s-par currently acts as a switch header which allows nearly all of your headers as an option. The main problem comes with the different governments. You seem to be the only project that differentiates titles between different governments. There also seems to be an issue of colors standardized for different governments, or something of that nature. Would someone please fill me in on the information and what would be required so I could create something that could help standardize these more and avoid the creation of so many templates? Thank you!\n\n–Whaleyland ( Talk • Contributions )\n\nOur project uses specialized templates to designate members of each ministry, \"colour-coded\" in accordance with party affiliation. I realize that this approach has resulted in the creation of a disproportionately large number of templates, though I would argue that the end result serves the project well: providing a significant amount of information for our readers in a concise format. (I could note that our project also uses separate succession boxes for legislative and executive positions.)\n\nMy objections to the proposed changes are not particularly strong, but I don't see the need for a \"one size fits all\" model when the existing system seems to be working fairly well for us. CJCurrie\n\nIt's less works well with \"us\" as works well with everyone else. We are attempting to standardize succession boxes so they can be standard across wikipedia. Currently, the succession boxes you use are unique solely to your project and those, I find in desperate need of standardizing to those used with all the other pages. The headers are less of an issue and I was simply offering to make something that may work a little better and create less mass template creation. I am not quite sure why you use separate succession boxes for legislative and executive positions. That seems a little redundant since they are nearly identical but it may just be me.\n\n–Whaleyland ( Talk • Contributions )\n\nI'm not opposed to standardization in principle, but I cannot see the logic of accepting a system that provides less information to readers, standardized or not. (I wouldn't object to the harmonization of legislative and executive succession boxes, btw; I was just noting that we've done it differently in the past). CJCurrie\n\nThere is a limit to the amount of information that can be given through a succession box, and all of the information can be found in the article anyway. The important thing to note is that most of the important personalities that have been in a Canadian cabinet also have other titles which are categorised under different headers (with standardised colouring—see Template:S-start/doc for an overview), and the multiple colours of the cabinet headers may confuse the reader. The purpose of the colouring of the headers in SBS is to help the reader find titles more easily within large succession boxes, as all titles are supposed to be categorised under headers.\n\nAnd add to all this that party leaders and deputy leaders will have a succession line for that office anyway (and under a dedicated \"Party political offices\" header) and thus it will be possible for the readers to see what party the subjects were in in the succession box anyway.\n\nFurthermore, our standards are still being formed; it might actually be a good idea to add a \"Cabinet\" parameter to succession lines for cabinet positions, complete with a link to the appropriate cabinet page. Waltham, The Duke of\n\nA fortnight has passed... Surely this silence means that there is some kind of consent? Waltham, The Duke of\n\nNot always. GreenJoe\n\nI recently created Template:British Columbia provincial political parties. In the \"Parties recognized by Elections BC, not active in the previous general election\" section, I added articles for any of these parties that did not yet have a page, and the remaining red links did not have a web page. Are there any experts that can fill in the blanks? Morgan695\n\nI just wanted to let everyone know that there is a discussion occurring about \"standardizing\" the template. GreenJoe\n\nI would like to remove all reference to the {{PPAP}} banner on this page and instead encourage people to use {{WikiProject Canada | ppap=yes}}. My reason for this is that anything which is relivant to this project will also be relivant to WikiProject:Canada, and the later project has a Version 1.0 assessment table. Are there any objections? --Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nIn fact, I am going to replace the PPAP template with the WPCANADA template with the PPAP parameter turned on. Hopefully the template will be slowly replaced with the WPCANADA one as people rank articles. --Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nHello again. I have given Pierre Trudeau a succession box conforming to the templates, guidelines, and standards of WikiProject Succession Box Standardization, to serve as a sample for examination. Please have a look at it and let me know what you think. I am rather confident that very little information from the previous box structure has been lost, while there are several new benefits. Waltham, The Duke of\n\nI set up a v1.0 assessment table for the project. It only has a few articles listed in it now, but it will add more as the bots and job queue catch up. --Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nThe party is being Afd'd due to notability reasons. You opinions will help with the outcome.--Lenticel (talk)\n\nJust a few notes on various projects that I've undertaken recently:\n\nAs of right now, articles exist for all but one of the 191 women who have ever been elected to the House of Commons — Margaret Mary Macdonald is the last remaining straggler for whom I haven't created at least a stub. (Men, of course, are a much larger story.)\n\n\"Current MLAs\" templates now exist for every province and territory except British Columbia and Nova Scotia. These are as follows: {{Alberta MLAs}}, {{Saskatchewan MLAs}}, {{Manitoba MLAs}}, {{Ontario MPPs}}, {{Quebec MNAs}}, {{New Brunswick MLAs}}, {{Prince Edward Island MLAs}}, {{Newfoundland and Labrador MHAs}}, {{Yukon MLAs}}, {{Northwest Territories MLAs}} and {{Nunavut MLAs}}. I've created basic stubs for many, but not all, of the politicians who were still redlinked — though many obviously still need expansion, and redlinks should be filled in when possible. BC and NS templates will follow soon.\n\nConversely, the \"federal caucus by province\" templates, which were being used for a few provinces' MP and senator contingents but not for others, have been taken off all remaining articles for the time being. We need to either use them consistently or not at all — we can't have Manitoba's and Nova Scotia's MPs using them if Quebec's and Saskatchewan's MPs aren't. I've also consequently experimented with redesigning some of them into a cleaner and less obtrusive navbox format; the alternate templates can be viewed at Template talk:Canada Provincial Parliamentary Delegation.\n\nI've created a starter infobox template, currently located at WP:CWNB/Parliament Infobox, for discussion and input with the ultimate goal being that all 39 going on 40 Canadian parliaments should have a standardized summary at the top of the article. Please review this infobox and suggest or implement any changes you think appropriate.\n\nSimilarly, all 39 going on 40 Canadian elections should eventually have a similar infobox. I've tried playing around with {{Infobox Election}}, which does have a \"parliamentary\" set of parameters, but I find it uncomfortably British and not quite what we need.\n\nOn a bit of a piecemeal \"as-I-come-across-them\" basis, I've been adding {{Infobox Canadian provincial riding}} to provincial electoral districts. In most cases I don't, however, have access to most of the information that's called for in the template — I've often been able to add only the province and the name of the incumbent MLA/MPP/MHA/MNA. Whenever possible, I've also arranged incumbent lists into a table much like the one seen, for example, on Nickel Belt (provincial electoral district), though many of the provincial electoral district articles don't even have incumbent lists to work from.\n\nUltimately, I'd like to initiate some discussion around standardizing our presentation of Canadian political topics — because as it stands right now, everybody goes for their own preferred format on their own subset of articles that they bother with, and as a result we don't even necessarily have a consistent format between electoral districts in downtown Toronto vs. those in North York, let alone Ontario vs. British Columbia. Bearcat\n\nWe should probably also rank the class and importance of the 242 unassessed articles in this WikiProject; I've set up a draft importance rankings for that purpose. As for the parliaments and elections pages, I've previously put in a bit of work trying to standardize them, and I think infoboxes would be a big help. I'll look into making a few changes to the one you made and then we can start adding them to pages. --Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nFurther information: Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Government of Canada#Proposal to standarize coverage of PMs\n\nAt some point we should work on assessing the last 241 articles in this project. --Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nA debate over the inclusion of the monarch in the infoboxes of Canadian prime ministers, similar to what is done at a number of other PM articles throughout Wikipedia, has re-emerged at Talk:Stephen Harper#Re-open discussion: Infobox -- include GG and monarch?. Opinions on the matter are welcome, if not necessary! --G2bambino (talk)\n\nI notice that User:Lol57yeung is changing ordinal rankings inside the infobox for Prime ministers where they served more than one term (John A. Macdonald) et cetera. Was there some previous discussion or consensus the user can be referred to? Flibirigit (talk)\n\nI don't think there is any official policy, whether here or in law, but every academic and news source that I have seen counts Canadian prime ministers once even if they served two or three times, unlike the American numbering which gives a split-term president two ordinal numbers. Stephen Harper is always called the 22nd Prime Minister, never the 27th. --Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nI figured there was a consensus, and tried to follow the precedent at List of Prime Ministers of Canada, which does not count anyone twice. Flibirigit (talk)\n\nIs it possible to find some more sources of information on this topic FemINist INitiative of Canada?

Mostly innocuous, although suspiciously insider-style in the way of updates; I think I already cited WP:COI and WP:AUTO in a casual way, not like more formal notices on some BC political party pages, but continued activity by a discontinuous series of SPAs made me decide to write this just now. I tried not to be heavy-handed, and I think my points there about playing along and also about some originally-single-agenda contributors learning to be good Wikipedians is valid enough; my note here is just to ask others to keep an eye on this page, and on those of all major p.r. consultants and political party operatives; it's like we should have \"PPPOV Watch\" - Professional Politician Point-of-View Watch (Professional meaning private sector as well as elected politicians....; likiewise environmentalist bios and FN bios)- just in case one spins out of control, as was going on with the Bornmann and Ledge raids articles; Railgate, as it should be titled (that's a redirect) needs an update; I've been following it on the BC Mary blog (linked there) but there's too much volume of material, and needs someone with an eye for pure citation because of the legalities involved, even though the court ban is now effectively complelteyl lifted (it's just there's too much evidenced for anyone to geeet a chance to, or have thte dough to get acces s to; oh, it's complicated....and I'd be a bit POV. Marissen has nothing to do with it, so far as anyone knows anyway; the only reason these were connected is some of the same SPAs worked on the respective bios, don't think there was a Marissen SPA who also worked on Railgate; the only further connection is a one-degree-of-separation in that Bornmann and Marissen knew each other from the party, and maybe Bornmann had once had a contract with him. I haven't really looked at David Bercuson or David Frum or Michael Campbell or other similar pollitical commentattor bios to compare; I imagine to some degree you'd expect it in consultant bios just as much as I've come to on MP bios...anyway hope I wasn't too heavy-handed....Skookum1 (talk)\n\nAs you may have heard, we at the Wikipedia 1.0 Editorial Team recently made some changes to the assessment scale, including the addition of a new level.

He was elected in Iqaluit West three times, February 15, 1999, February 16, 2004 and October 27, 2008. CambridgeBayWeather Have a gorilla\n\nI know what that box is for, I set up the layout of the first ministers tables 2.5 years ago. The article is a list of premiers, not a list of ridings won by people who once served as premiers. Paul lost the election to be first minister in the third election; we don't mention any of the other non-premiers, so why should we mention him? Look at all of the other lists of first ministers in Template:Canadian_First_Ministers. When Harper replaced Martin for federal Prime Minister, we didn't start listing both Martin's and Harper's elections, we stuck to Harper's because he was the new Prime Minister and the list is about Prime Ministers. --Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nThen why have the box say Elections (Riding)? That's unclear. Anyway I fixed it now so that it's clear what it means. CambridgeBayWeather Have a gorilla\n\nI agree that it should be clearer, but I think that the links to the election articles were useful, so we shouldn't take those out. Do you think it would be clearer if we listed the links to the general elections in a separate column from the ridings like they do in List of premiers of Quebec? --Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nAgh, I had a reply with links typed up and hit some key and it all vanished. Which is why this reply took way longer than it should have.\n\nAfter looking through the various articles I see that there are only three that use \"Elections (riding)\", List of premiers of Ontario, List of premiers of Saskatchewan and List of premiers of British Columbia. I think that they would be better if they were somewhat like Quebec, although \"General elections\" might be a better title. Others such as List of premiers of Newfoundland and Labrador are still a little confusing. Look down the list to \"Premiers of the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador\" and #2 Frank D. Moores or #5 Clyde Wells. Did they resign before the election? Did they run in their riding but weren't elected so the party picked another leader?\n\nLook at List of premiers of the Northwest Territories and List of premiers of Nunavut, because there is no party politics in either territory there is no way to tell from the box that Joe Handley had not run again nor that Paul won his riding, but lost the seperate election for the premiership. It's explained earlier in the Nunavut article but there is nothing in the NWT one. Now it's easy enough to add the wording \"Did not run\" or something like that for Handley and any others in the same list that have no explanation. But there also needs to be an explanation in the box for ones like Paul. Looking at the NWT ones I see that Dennis Patterson was premier from 1987-1991, was re-elected in his riding in 1991 but Nellie Cournoyea became premier but it's not shown that Patterson ran again, nor if he ran for the premiership.\n\nAt the same time I am making the assumption that, in the south, if a person is no longer leader of their party they are not running in the following election. That's why it would be necessary to have something in the Clyde Wells section in Newfoundland and Labrador. Of course then there's this province that is different to all the rest.\n\nI just noticed, for a non-Canadian it's not always clear that the leaders are elected as part of the party and not in a seperate election. CambridgeBayWeather Have a gorilla\n\nI've also lost many posts from hitting the wrong key.\n\nRidings are missing in most lists because most provinces' archives don't have that information online for the historical elections. Ideally, all ridings will be included one day. Then again, it might be better to split the ridings into a seperate article like List of Prime Ministers of Canada by constituency.\n\nFor the elections column, \"general elections\" would, indeed be a better heading, as that is where the links go and is what we are trying to convey; that column was never meant to talk about the premiers individual riding elections.\n\nAlberta is different just because it is an older list. It will be updated to match the other provinces eventually.\n\nThose examples on the Newfoundland list do need to be cleared up, I doubt that the transfer of power happened right after the election in the same way that it does after a new party is elected. In NWT and Nunavut, I'm not sure whether it's relevant whether the Premier ran again. The way that I had it set up implies that Paul lost the primiership as a direct result of the election.\n\nWe could make all of the provinces' and the territories' lists clearer by adding a line at the end of each premier's box saying \"defeated\" or \"transfered power\" and giving the date of the election, but that seems a bit redundant with the election link in the next premier's box. I guess we should alway err on the side of clarity for non-specialists, so that might be a good idea. --Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nActually, maybe \"General Elections\" wouldn't be a good header since that column contains other events like \"died in office\" and \"designated\". We could call the column \"events\", although that doesn't make it clear that we are talking about general elections. I wonder if something like \"General elections and appointment dates\" would work. --Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nIt might be best to remove the ridings altogether, as they may use the same name but change over time. General elections and appointment dates might work. Am I correct in thinking that it's only the NWT and Nunavut where the premiership race is seperate from the general election? If so, then is it also correct that only in the NWT and Nunavut is it a requirement that the person must hold a seat before they become premier? As opposed to being the leader of a party that is in power and thus being premier but not gaining a seat until a by-election. CambridgeBayWeather Have a gorilla\n\nOkay, ridings are out. In NWT and Nunavut premiers are appointed in the exact same way as everywhere else, they are chosen by the MPs/MLAs. The only difference is that in NWT and Nunavut they do not have political parties, so you have to ask your local candidate who they will be supporting as premier. In provinces or territories, the MPs/MLAs can choose someone not in the legislature (i.e. the party leader), but that person has to get a seat via a by-election asap. --Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nOK now I'm more confused. I thought that, in the south and the Yukon using either a Leadership convention or One member, one vote, a party would choose the leader, and assuming the party won the election, that person would become premier. And that going into the election, you as a voter would know which people had the potential to become the next premier. However, it appears to me that you are saying that only the MPs/MLAs choose the leader or am I mis-reading that? In the NWT and Nunavut there is no way to tell before the election who will become premier and for the most part who is interested. In the last Nunavut election I don't recall seeing anything that indicated who would be interested in running for premier. While this is probably not the most authoritive of sources it is from the legislative assembly and says that the premier must be picked from the members and would not be picked from a non sitting memeber. CambridgeBayWeather Have a gorilla\n\nOn paper they work the same way, and MPs/MLAs in the provinces could support someone other than their party leader, though they never would for the sake of their own carriers, so it's a safe bet that if you vote for a Liberal MP/MLA, they'll support the Liberal leader for premier. In the provinces, you can have independent candidates who might support anyone for premier, although they can say something like \"I'll support the Liberals on everything except for issue X\". In NWT/Nunavut all candidates are independents, so you can't be sure who they'll support, although you could have an MLA who says while campaigning \"I really like Paul as premier and will vote as he votes\". --Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nMinor overhaul\n\nWhat do people think of this layout? I made the \"assembly\" column length change to encompase all the PMs and events within it, so one can visualy scan what is going on and when.\n\nAs in another discussion elsewhere, the use of \"assemblies\" here is just not how sittings are described; the term is capital-P \"Parliaments\". I don't know where you're getting \"Assemblies\" from but it just looks odd....Skookum1 (talk)\n\nI'm sure that there are a bunch of semantic errors to be found in the first ministers lists, but that's not what I'm looking for here. This proposal is regarding the change to layout, specifically giving each Parliament its own row rather than the current practice of listing them all together in the same box. --Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nPremier\n\n(party) Period Parlia-\n\nments General Elections & Key Events - William Lyon Mackenzie King\n\n(Liberal)\n\n(3rd time of 3) October 23, 1935\n\nNovember 14, 1948 18th Elected October 14, 1935 19th Re-Elected March 26, 1940 20th Re-Elected June 11, 1945[1]\n\nBy-Election August 6, 1945\n\nResigned (Retired) 1948 12th Louis St. Laurent\n\n(Liberal) November 15, 1948\n\nJune 20, 1957 Designated August 7, 1948 21st Re-elected June 27, 1949 22nd Re-Elected August 10, 1953 13th John Diefenbaker\n\n(Progressive Conservative) June 21, 1957\n\nApril 21, 1963 23rd Elected June 10, 1957 to a minority government 24th Re-Elected March 31, 1958 25th Re-Elected June 18, 1962 to a minority government 14th Lester B.

It seems to me that his press-kit designers are peppering Wikipedia's BC articles with mentions of the Premier, who's in a public relations morasse right now and facing an election date of his own making next year (and at this point doesn't seem likely to win). So keep your eyes open for this kind of \"fluff\"; it's not just Campbell, although insertions of his name are all pretty pointedly artificial; there's other instances of \"plugs\" for politicians when \"the provincial/federal government\" is the more neutral phrase.

I suggest it's not a key point in their public career. You hardly ever hear of Canadian politicians' religious views in the news, and it's typically not even a key point in the articles.--Ducio1234 (talk)\n\nI am inclined to agree. It was occasionally a minor point of discussion in Canada's early days but, even if it was a important issue, it is better represented by discussion of that issue in the article rather than a line without any context in the infobox. At the same time, it is not only a political biography but also a personal biography and we do not need to lose that information. It should probably be mentioned, with a reference, within a personal life section and, with luck, some context on what importance it had on the subject's life. In the case of someone like John Sparrow David Thompson, it is easy because it is firstly documented that he was born and raised a Methodist but sought and tried out other denominations like Anglican before finally converting to his wife's Catholic religion and secondly, he was the first Catholic prime minister. Others may be more difficult (I don't know) to connect their religion with any context but, in that case, may be is not a well-enough publicly known influence and should be kept out of our biography. DoubleBlue (talk)\n\nI completely agree. I'm in favour of removing religion from the infobox because it is not necessarily a significant issue in the politician's personal biography or public career. Plus, I don't believe having one word to represent the religious views of someone helps the article, as it may give false impressions of his or her complex outlook and backgroud. Religion is better considered in the article rather than one word lacking contextual background.--Ducio1234 (talk)\n\nIt seems very sensible to me; so much so that I'd like to see a wide consensus on the idea to justify removing it generally and will invite requests for comment from WP:CANBOARD. Please indicate your rationale for supporting or opposing a general guideline to omit the religion from the infoboxes of biographies of Canadian politicians. DoubleBlue (talk)\n\nI have a slight preference against removing the field. While it should certainly be used with restraint (i.e. only where there are reliable sources and no particular disagreement), I think it's at least as relevant as the spouse, children, alma mater, etc. fields. For some politicians, like William Aberhart, Mackenzie Bowell, or Ujjal Dosanjh, it's probably substantially more relevant. I can live with any decision, but my preference would be for the field's continued inclusion. Sarcasticidealist (talk)\n\nI would support omitting religion from the infoboxes, based on the opinions above, esp. Ducio1234's comments. Mentioning religion in the article allows it to be referenced in proper context where it is relevant to do so. --Skeezix1000 (talk)\n\nI completely support omitting religion from the infobox. It's occasionally relevant to some individual politicians, but can be more effectively handled by actually discussing it in a properly referenced and sourced context in the article itself — but for most politicians it's not really relevant, and especially these days for a good many of them the religious denomination that they ascribe to isn't even on the public record at all. Oftentimes it can only be added by making assumptions, e.g. \"they have a French surname, so they must be Catholic.\" (Whither Huguenots?) For what it's worth, though, I suspect the field is present in the infobox because there are still some other countries in the world — it is a standard international template, after all — where religion is a more prominent factor in day-to-day political life. Bearcat (talk)\n\nSo it looks like we have consensus to remove religion from the infobox?--Ducio1234 (talk)\n\nI advise removing it without fear from all Canadian politician infoboxes. An edit summary linking to this discussion or an suggestion that if it is relevant, it should be included with context in the article might help get the message to concerned article-watchers. DoubleBlue (talk)\n\nI support the suggestion to remove religion from infoboxes. GiuseppeMassimo (talk)\n\n-It was a very unfortunate idea to remove a politician's religious affiliation from the infobox. Paul Martin is a practicing Roman Catholic and he spoke publicly about his faith during the debate on same-sex marriage. Having the information in the infobox serves as a quick reference, and does not require the reader to try to find it buried somewhere in the article. I couldn't find any reference at all in the Martin entry to his faith. If we remove the religious affiliation of Canadian politicians why leave the names of their children? It seems to me that it is more important to know that Harper is a member of the Christian Missionary Alliance than the fact that his children are called Benjamin and Rachel. Please restore the religious affiliation for Canadian politicians, and context can be provided in the article. Removing the religious affiliation of each politician does not improve the infobox in any way--it simply makes unavailable a piece of information that you often cannot find elsewhere. If you are looking to find Layton's faith, Wikipedia was one of the few places to visit in order to discover that he is a member of the United Church of Canada. [Chris] —Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.51.21.252 (talk)\n\nI found the information about a politician's religious affiliation in the infobox quite handy. If it is to be removed from the infobox however, it should be at least added in the personal section of the biography. Just removing it reduces the informational value of the article. Gugganij (talk)\n\nIf religion is important in the politician's biography, it should be included, discussed and referenced in the article. Automatically including it in the infobox is misguided in my opinion, because it's often not significant in the article and acts simply as a label posted on to the politician to describe his or her complex outlook on life--which I believe does not improve the article or advance knowledge.--Ducio1234 (talk)\n\nHi, I think religious affiliation is an important bit of personal information (as long, stating the obvious, it is backed up by sources). It does by no means reduce the person's complex world views, it just provides the simple information that a person (at least nominally) belongs to a certain religious institution. Gugganij (talk)\n\nHello, in the article on Paul Martin, for example, there's no mention of his Catholic beliefs. I don't see why the infobox should include his religion as Roman Catholic if it's not notable enough to be included main text. If someone wants to explain in the article why his religious beliefs are important to his career or biography, that's great. But there's no reason to summarize his beliefs in the infobox if it's not mentioned in the article. For some politicians religion isn't important and it does not necessarily relate to his or her biography and career. In cases like these, it doesn't make sense to include religion in the infobox because its not significant.--Ducio1234 (talk)\n\nI think since its standard practice for other countries' politicians to have their religion in their infoboxes, that there is no reason why we should be any different. And really, do we have any jurisdiction to be different? -- Earl Andrew - talk\n\nWe should not simply follow the established pattern if it does not reflect the consenus of editors interested in Canadian political parties and politicians. Despite the recent concerns, I believe the consensus remains to remove religion from the infobox for the reasons discussed. As for jurisdiction, someone else will have to clear that up.--Ducio1234 (talk)\n\n*sigh* This is exactly what happened to music genres in infoboxes. After people realized how stupid the idea of removing them was, they came back. Same thing will happen here. There is no reason why religion shouldn't be in the infobox (properly sourced). What we have here is a couple users who think it's pointless. That is absolutely no justification for removal. --Pwnage8 (talk)\n\nI would appreciate if you wrote why there's no reason to remove religion and doing so is stupid. This started because I asked a question and no one provided a convincing explanation why religion should be included in the infobox.--Ducio1234 (talk)\n\nI found it interesting to read mini biographies of politicians who were historically active in the early 1900s and the inclusion of their religion. It would also be relevant to those who are still living who are very involved in both politics and religion, for example Robert Ogle and Lorne Calvert. Otherwise it probably has no direct pertinence and of no real notability for current contemporary politicians in an article directly related to politics. If it is in the infobox, I am in agreement it should be in the article proper and sourced. My two cents worth. SriMesh | talk\n\nStrongly oppose removing them. Should Canadian politicians be treated differently than politicians in other countries in the world??? CrazyC83 (talk)\n\nNo, irrelevant and insignificant information should be removed from all biographies. Infoboxes should summarize the article, if religion isn't even in the article it shouldn't be in the infobox.--Ducio1234 (talk)\n\nAny Canadian political scientist (or political scientist period) worth his salt would agree that religion has an effect on politics and politicians, and Canada's is no different. If Pierre Trudeau's Catholic beliefs were such a strong part of his ideals, and Mackenzie King's own mysticism a part of his, and the Reform Party/Canadian Alliance/Conservative Party having closer traditional values involving Christianity, then why remove it in the first place? Stop trying to be so damn politically correct. It's biographical information, and is not useless. --TheAxeGrinder (talk)\n\nNo one is saying that religious affiliation should not be included in the article; just not added to the infobox without any context. The proper place is within the article with explanation. DoubleBlue (talk)\n\nI strongly oppose removing this information. I use it regularly to quickly identify a politicians religious affiliation without having to search for it in an article.

This group has been created after discussion regarding possible changes to the A-Class review system, and that may be one of the first things discussed by interested coordinators.\n\nAll designated project coordinators are invited to join this working group. If your project hasn't formally designated any editors as coordinators, but you are someone who regularly deals with coordination tasks in the project, please feel free to join as well. — Delievered by §hepBot (Disable) on behalf of the WikiProject coordinators' working group at\n\nHi, the template used on James Stock for \"Leaders of the Ontario Libertarian Party\" has blue text on dark green background and is virtually illegible.

PamD (talk)\n\nHi....an interesting issue raised itself because of an IP interloper's objection to an inlince cmoment of mine calling for $$ figures to balance the half-information on the \"Tax Reductions\" section of the Gordon Campbell 1st Term article-section; best to sum up by having you read this but while writing it i realized that POV-washing during the election campaign, and any article that reads like advertising, pro or con, is theoretically subject to BC's new gag law, which limits (severely, and expensively if fines are levied) third-party advertising and editorial content. Even Rafe Mair has his tongue tied by the law (see his latest article on The Tyee http://thetyee.ca where he mentions it in passing). The Campbell article in particular is going to need a \"Protect\" during hte election campaign, and it needs a lot of work to get it to POV and not read like a p.r. brochure; I added some mention of other non-p.r.-friendly materials, but a read through the earlier talkpage posts demonstrates that this article has had a troubled history of censorship, I haven't looked at the history but I suspect it's a lot of activity from IP and SPA users....fine, it's a political football. The thing is that if it's a political brochure, it falls under gag law restrictions. Such that people in Canada can't edit it without being subject to rulings by the BC Elections commissioner; those in other countries are theoretically exempt unless a \"political firewall\" is put up around the province, a la the People's Republic of China...this is obviously not a good thing. Anyway the IP user who provoked me to write this seems intent on tryingt to provoke me enough to silence me altogether; curiously enough their IP address is in Minnesota, I've even identified the company it comes from....so why are they so interested? Alleging nothing here, just questioning, and also seeking a policy/action on making sure Wikipedia and wikipedians don't fall afoul of the current BC elections laws; which not incuriously weree put in place by Campbell's government.....Lots of BC political bios, and BC political-issue articles, need more attention; I know simply out of political nausea most of us stay away from them ,national politics is almost more palatable....but given teh history of the article, its current state, and the dangers implicit in the new elections law, I think this article needs some more attention, and perhaps, once the election campaign starts, some form of protection.....Skookum1 (talk)\n\nUser:Cool3 has nominated List of premiers of Saskatchewan for featured list removal here.

Dabomb87 (talk)\n\nI've just started looking through the candidates linked in British Columbia general election, 2009 to see who doesn't have the WPCAn/PPAP/BC template; many have the WP/BLP template and lots need anti-resume/POV cleanup as well as references for a lot of the usually-needless personal detail that are chocked into them. Is there a switch for \"article issues\" that addresses \"Wikipedia is not a resume\" properly? \"Essay\" and \"POV\" and auto/coi just don't seem to fit the bill; two examples are Terry Lake (Liberal, Kamloops) and Robin Austin (NDP, Skeena); older political bios like Nelson Riis are also full of similar bumpf, it's non-partisan as a wiki-vice. I've spent quite a bit of time trying to bring balance and less of a personal \"Gordon worked hard to pay for his education\" bumpf in the Premier's article, but it's clear that between the NDP party machine on the one hand and the $23 million Public Affairs Bureau (British Columbia) with its 223 well-paid staffers working out of hte legislature basement that there's a LOT of p.r. information that's been fed into Wikipedia to serve as election-pamphlet material. A \"resume\" or \"no political brochures\" template seems more than necessary, and not just in the current instance; no doubt this is a widespread problem in other provinces/countries as well....Skookum1 (talk)\n\nPlease see this on the main WP Canada talkpage.Skookum1 (talk)\n\nAs you can see this is a redlink, indicating it's missing from the roster of defunct ridings; Clark held this seat from 1996 to 2001, when it was adjusted into Port Moody-Westwood, her seat until her retirement from politics.

I am running AWB, went through the items listed at first alphabetical list of Canadian house of commons members (List of Members of the Canadian House of Commons (A)). It seemed to me that 111 needed Wikiproject Canada tag, while 170 did not. Seems like about 40 percent of all pages lack Wikiproject Canada, if i am doing this right. Could someone check these, before i do more? I applied {{WikiProject Canada|ppap=yes}} to talk pages. Most are politicians, but also some electoral districts and the Labour Party of Canada. I applied ppap to all, hope that is okay/good for the electoral districts too. Thanks! --doncram (talk)\n\nIn my contributions history, i am refering to this edit and the 110 preceding. I do see i could have added \"importance=low\" to all/most of these entries. I did not add province-specific subtags, but could not do so easily in AWB, which i had set up to bring me to the Talk pages (and i could not see the corresponding article to identify the relevant province). So i am leaving it to project members to add the \"the province=yes switch (bc=yes, ab=yes etc) as applicable\", which Skookum1 already suggested to me. Skookum1 also suggested \"If they're retired sports people, also add sports=yes....(as so many, in fact, are...)\", also not easily doable by me. --doncram (talk)\n\nYou did some edits to some of the articles that I am either watching or editing, and they seemed fine to me.--Abebenjoe (talk)\n\nDid through H's within List of Members of the Canadian House of Commons (B), adding {{WPCANADA|ppap=yes|class=stub|importance=low}} when the Talk page omits any mention of \"Canada\" so cannot be in WikiProject Canada, by my reasoning for fine-tuning AWB.

Hundreds of federal and provincial candidates ran on its slates, though none were elected. (Magician Doug Henning was their most prominent candidate.

Others to watch are Christy Clark, Pat Bell....so this is just a heads-up; I've not watchlisted most of them, I guess I might as well......NB \"reliable sources\" in Briitsh Columbia often excludes the newspapers/TV stations, though I realize in Wikipedia \"rules\" they're allegedly \"more reliable\" than blogs; but in BC the political blogs are where teh real news is.....even this morning's Sun made the HST movement's numbers only 550,000, whereas it's a well known and highly citable fact that it's well over 700,000 people.....the problem with citing the Sun is the Sun doesn't give its sources, and distorts what their own soruces say as a matter of habit....all the more especially in regard to the BC Liberal Party. NB for other Canadians, please bear in mind with all BC Liberal articles they're not the same as the federal Liberals, so avoid linking the two in any logic/descriptions.....the BC Liberal Party has lots of Tories adn ex-Reform and ex-Socred in it, and relations with the federal party are at arsm-legnth, despite sharing common backroom players and fund raisers (e.g. Mark Marissen and Patrick Kinsella.Skookum1 (talk)\n\nI noticed this when a DB tag showed up on Judi Tyabji Wilson, which was the original title and I'm not sure it was moved properly; the current item is a bare stub and is sporting a seven-day delete tag.

Elizium23 (talk) (Using {{Please see}})\n\nI noticed on British Columbia Liberal Party leadership election, 2011 that the \"colour\" field in the infobox was \"Liberal\", which just ain't right due to the BC Liberals being a very notable blend of ex-Socreds, REformers, Tories, with only a smattering of \"real Liberals\". We've gone over this before and I thought some solution had been arrived at; properly that party's colours are red and blue, not just red, but it's important in hte current context because the Clark campaign is notable for its federal connections - to the point where she had to fire a campaign manager becaues he's a federal Tory - so another colour has to be found....purple maybe? I checked on the party colour listings and {{Canadian_politics/party_colours/BC Liberal/row}} has the same shade of reddish pink that the main \"Liberal\" colour does; not acceptable and MUST be changed.Skookum1 (talk)\n\nOK so User:177 Avenue has put in the right template, \"BC Liberal\", but it's just the same colour. \"This cannot be\".

For example some politicians articles are \"MHA for Virginia Waters\" while others have the MHA spelled out. One contributer I've noticed though is only putting \"Member of the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly\" as the office and then under the predecessor and successor section it lists the constituency. Is there a proper format for this because I haven't noticed this third way really used before? Newfoundlander&Labradorian (talk)\n\nI'm not really sure if this is the best place to put this but I'm looking for other Wikipedians suggestions.

Newfoundlander&Labradorian (talk)\n\nThere does not seem to be a lot of action here, but just in case: Is there no way to standardize the dates in Ontario_general_election,_2011#Opinion_polls/ Manitoba_general_election,_2011#Opinion_polls/etc. so that the list can be sorted?

Me-123567-Me (talk)\n\nYeah, we still have yet to find consensus on the issue, and we began a discussion above.Bkissin (talk)\n\nFYI: Merging the CanElec templates —Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nThere has been an ongoing edit conflict regarding the inclusion of third parties, (i.e. the Green Party) in the leader's infobox of future elections. This has been a hot topic on the talk page of the next federal election, but the situation has spread to future provincial elections in Quebec, Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, Manitoba and New Brunswick. Rather than edit war all of these situations, I suggest that we create a policy to deal with this in the future. To get the ball rolling here, my original idea for this was to only include parties that have representation in the legislature where they are located. If a new party enters the legislature, as the Wildrose Alliance did in Alberta, then they should get added to the leader's infobox as well. As for other minor parties, they can/should be added to the results table, provided the party is registered with the Chief Election Officer. Your thoughts? Bkissin (talk)\n\nI agree with that suggestion.Eiad77 (talk)\n\nI think the leader should also be added to the infobox if the party gains a seat in that election, but it could be added after. Me-123567-Me (talk)\n\nYes, of course, Me-123567-Me. If, say, the Green Party wins a seat in an election in Nova Scotia or whatever, then the leader can be added once the seat has been won. Bkissin (talk)\n\nWhereas the federal Green Party would be included in the next election infobox because it has one seat. Me-123567-Me (talk)\n\nExactly. Bkissin (talk)\n\nI would also include them if they were in the televised leaders debate. I also think the Wildrose would be relevant to the article even if they hadn't won a few byelections, so we should make a WP:IAR exception when many sources predict that a party will win a substantial portion of the seats (ie, more than just a few seats. —Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nSeats or popular vote? The Green Party was included in the infobox for the 41st federal election before the election, because it was in the polls, not because a win was predicted. 117Avenue (talk)\n\nBut the policy regarding the Green Party federally was a stop-gap compromise measure aimed at appeasing those who supported the party. Had they not won a seat in the election, they would have been deleted from the infobox. Bkissin (talk)\n\nI'm not sure about whether we were only appeasing supporters. If a party is getting a substantial portion of the news coverage during an election, I think that makes them an encyclopedicly notable part of the election campaign (not just the election results) even if they don't win any seats. The difficult part is finding a way to measure \"substantial portion\". —Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nWhich is what we followed when the CAQ was polling high in Quebec and could have formed the government (even before they had seats in the National Assembly). Now that they do, they have a reason to be added. Yes, when there is a chance for a party to win seats, it should be added. However, if it doesn't, then it shouldn't be added to the infobox. It can always be added to the article's text and the results infobox. Bkissin (talk)\n\nAre you suggesting different standards for past and future elections? I don't think that's fair. Popular vote should count as opinion polls for past elections. 117Avenue (talk)\n\nWe're not here to discuss the fairness of the First-past-the-post system, ours is to give readers the information and draw their own conclusions. While it may not be \"fair\" that these minor parties get a decent percentage of the vote but no representation, but that is the way our system works. We can show that these minor parties played a role in the text of the article, but if a leader's infobox is supposed to summarize the article, then it should show the important wins/losses in the election. Bkissin (talk)\n\nWikipedia's content should be guided by secondary sources. If Party x is being included in national/provincial polling then they should be included in the infobox summary. Remember, the infobox is intended to be a summary of the election, not the past/future parliament. maclean (talk)\n\nIve dealt with this issue in US and Israeli elections. In a case like 41st Federal, Green I think was mentioned as possibly getting a seat, so during the campaign, it can go either way. Since they did actually win a seat and there is no 6th, 7th, 8th, etc. parties with similar small results, its fine to have them. In the case of Alberta 2012, I brought it up because altho the Alberta party had a seat before dissolution, they didnt win that seat, it was a floor crossing. In addition, they didnt win any seats in 2012. Thus, its just clutter. As for the US elections, we unfortunately rarely have the privilege of third parties, but in one case I was involved in, we decided to omit a candidate because she didnt clear a 5% threshold. Around the same time, I tried to forge a Wikipedia consensus on this issue. None ever really came together I think because I abandoned it, but there was support for a 5% threshold. For Israeli elections, the question was whether to have the top 6 or all the parties that won seats (usually about 10!). Personally I preferred 6, but there never was really any debate on it and I didnt care.\n\nIn the current dispute, Alberta didnt win a seat in 2008, any by election, or 2012, didnt clear 5%, wasnt even in the debates. Theres absolutely no sense in having them clutter the infobox. Plus, having it 2x2 makes a clearer contrast between the major and minor parties. Broadly for Canada, I think winning a seat should be how it goes, since third parties do actually have a chance. If theres ever a concern with two or more parties getting a seat or two each, you could include up to the 6th party.--Metallurgist (talk)\n\nActually it was an edit to New Brunswick general election, 2010 that sparked this again. 117Avenue (talk)\n\nI wish we didn't have to be this formal, but this debate will keep coming up every election, so how about this? For past elections, up to six parties are included if they meet one of these criteria: (1) won a seat in the election, (2) won 5% of the vote in the election, (3) were in the televised debate, or (4) were always (or nearly always) included in opinion polls and published summaries of the election. For future elections, they are included if they either met criteria 1 or 2 for the last election and still exist, or meet criteria 3 or 4 for this election. —Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nI agree with criteria 1-3, but I think pollsters like to include parties in their published results that they don't need to. I think criteria 2 and 4 should be replaced with won at least 5.0% of the popular vote, if the election is past and consistently garnering at least 5.0% in opinion polls, if the election has yet to take place. 117Avenue (talk)\n\nI'm fine with dropping the opinion poll option for past elections. However, I realized that a party that completely collapses can still notable for that election, for example, the Bloc in the 2011 federal election just barely met the vote criterion. Maybe we should say a party is notable if it met the seat or vote criteria in this or the previous election. With that, we would probably never need the debate criterion. —Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nNo, the previous election shouldn't be used. If a party wins a seat in that election, it's a given they are included. I don't think anyone is arguing that, unless Canadian politics changes, and we exceed the nine party maximum the box can handle. 117Avenue (talk)\n\nI'm not in favour of using an arbitrary number, like 5%. Maybe we should be getting back to Wikipedia:Core content policies. We shouldn't be deciding which party is relevant to the election when there are published secondary sources (pollsters who are interpreting polling data for us). If no polls or published summaries are available, then going strictly by who gained/lost seats should be fine as a basic summary. maclean (talk)\n\nI agree with 117 that it should be based on if they win a seat. This isnt like US elections where candidates might win 8%, but not win a seat. If we ever get to exceed the 6 parties, we can just do the top 6 obviously, or the major parties. As for NB2010, I see no reason to include the NDP (and I am a federal NDP supporter, altho I would probably support the Tories in NB). They didnt win any seats.--Metallurgist (talk)\n\nI'm in agreement with 117 and Metallurgist that it should be if parties win a seat in a previous or current election. In terms of the Alberta Party, I think we followed the same conventions as the Canadian federal election, 2008 with the Green Party. Percentages and polling data are not what I would follow. I mean, the Reform Party won a large percentage in 1988, but they aren't mentioned in the infobox. The People's Alliance of New Brunswick, the NB Green Party and the NB NDP were all mentioned in the polls, but did not play a deciding role in the New Brunswick general election, 2010. In our FPTP system, seat totals should be the basis of the infobox. Minor parties can be mentioned in the text of the article and the results infobox. IF we want to set a percentage level for the infobox, it should be higher than five percent, and closer to 10-15%, but setting an arbitrary number is problematic. Bkissin (talk)\n\nIn the 1988 federal election the Reform Party only got 2% of the vote, so they aren't very notable. The five percent rule is more for cases like the Green Party in the 2008 federal election. They didn't win a seat, but they got 6% of the vote. More importantly, there were many sources talking about the Green Party and they were listed in the polls; they were an encyclopedicly relevant part of the campaign despite not winning a seat. Our formula needs some way to include parties that have a strong presence during the election campaign but won't win seats because of the way their supporters are distributed across ridings. —Arctic Gnome (talk • contribs)\n\nI still think 5% is a good \"arbitrary\" number, because parties have won seats with less (Canadian federal election, 2011). 117Avenue (talk)\n\nAs I think about my example, I think maybe the Green Party did win a seat in 2011, because there are so many seats. Perhaps our formula should be tied into the number of seats available. For example, if a party gets a popular vote greater than the percentage of ten seats in the Assembly. 117Avenue (talk)\n\nFor Canadian legislative election articles, I think it should be by who wins a seat. The 5% rule works for single seat races where there are 3+ candidates, such as the New Jersey gubernatorial election, 2009. But for this, seats make more sense.--Metallurgist (talk)\n\nI completely agree. Bkissin (talk)\n\nConsensus\n\nI don't know if we've reached consensus on this issue. Part of me feels like we have agreed that infobox inclusion should be based on seats won in the previous/current election, with minor parties mentioned Before the election if they are polling at a level higher than 5%.\n\nHowever, I don't know if this is actually shared by everyone. I'm just going from the last part of the conversation above. Is that a policy we can live with? Bkissin (talk)\n\nA new issue has popped up. Are party presidents notable? I found one previous precedent when searching through WP pages or the term Party president. Comment over at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bill Hewitt (teacher). Me-123567-Me (talk)\n\nSome are. There is a nice size article written on former Liberal President Alfred Apps, but he has had a bit of a prominent career and was a candidate in the 80's. Just being president isn't enough to justify an article, especially if you can only write a stub.
