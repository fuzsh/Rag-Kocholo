        "text": "Here are two items reflecting on the applause all members of the House of Commons gave to a former Nazi soldier of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS. I intended to include these on Sunday, but they fell into a pothole.\n\nAbout the SS Officer in the Gallery\n\nThose Who Forget The Past…are doomed to screw up royally.\n\nWhat about others?\n\nA member of the Nazi Party and major in the Allgemeine SS. He escaped justice for his Nazi war crimes due to the US desire to beat the Soviets in the space race. That’s Werner von Braun.\n\n“the enemy of my enemy is my friend”\n\nMiscellaneous items I found of interest during the week.\n\nMost popular baby names in 2022 in Canada\n\nRank Boys Girls 1 Noah Olivia 2 Liam Emma 3 William Charlotte 4 Leo Amelia 5 Theodore Sophia 6 Oliver Chloe 7 Benjamin Mia 8 Thomas Ava 9 Lucas Lily 10 Jack Mila\n\nIn 2022, Noah was the most popular boy name for the second straight year. It has been in the top 10 for the last 18 years.\n\nAmong girls, Olivia kept the top spot, undefeated for seven years now. Emma and Olivia have been vying for the number one spot since 2003.\n\nHow the Poor LiveHorrible London\n\nFor those who expressed appreciation for the post on Living London by George R. Sims, two more by Sims that may be of interest, and should be read by those who hold that children were better off on the streets of London than on a Canadian farm.\n\nThanks to this week’s contributors: Anonymous, gail benjafield, Nick Mcdonald, Sheila, Sunday Thompson, Teresa, Unknown.\n\nLambeth Electoral Registers\n\nAn additional 1,312,044 records now appear in the Lambeth Electoral Registers 1832-1886 collection, complete with names and addresses.\n\nA search returns the First name(s), Last name, Year, Street, District/ward Parish with links to a transcript and the printed register.\n\nElectoral registers only recorded those eligible to vote, almost all male. There was a property qualification. More people became eligible with The Representation of the People Act 1867. Many in poverty, and most women, were not eligible.\n\nKent Burials\n\nThere are 8,635 new burials from the county of Kent, spanning from 1542 to 1992. Additions are from Dartford, Watling Street Cemetery; Ightham, St Peter; Kemsing, St Mary the Virgin; and Kilndown, Christ Church. The total collection is now 3,052,145 transcription entries with some images.\n\nDo you know of the 3 volume work Living London; its work and its play, its humour and its pathos, its sights and its scenes; by Sims, George Robert, 1847-1922? As it was published in 1902 – 1903 it’s a resource worth knowing if you’d like a view of the place and times.\n\nEach volume has nearly 60 chapters with copious illustrations. Do you want to know about football, rugby, cricket or athletics? There are chapters on those. Others include London Awakes, Marrying London, Russia in East London, Sweated London, Trial at the Old Bailey, Artistic London, Christmas London. It goes on.\n\nThis extract from the start of the chapter on the Thames Police gives an idea of the style.\n\nA dark narrow flagged passage between two waterside buildings in a dingy East-End street, with a solitary figure in uniform stationed beneath the rays of the blue lamp at the entrance : on one of the flanking walls a long array of placards, of which the headline ” DEAD BODY FOUND ” is alone discernible : and beyond, a vague, blurred vista of the great river, its darkness studded with the glow-worm lights of the shipping and its distant wharves silhouetted against the night sky. Such is the sombre and striking picture presented after dusk by the headquarters of the Thames Police at Wapping ; a scene that haunts the memory, and seems fitly to symbolise much in the lifework and the associations of the river force.\n\nAccess the volumes in various formats from https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp65278\n\nIt’s free, even better value than the original 7d price.\n\nOn 7 February 2018, the House of Commons unanimously passed a motion reading:\n\nThat, in the opinion of the House, the government should recognize the contributions made by the over 100,000 British Home Children to Canadian society, their service to our armed forces throughout the twentieth century, the hardships and stigmas that many of them endured, and the importance of educating and reflecting upon the story of the British Home Children for future generations by declaring September 28 of every year, British Home Child Day in Canada.\n\nFor the few not familiar with their story, as explained by the OGS British Home Children Special Interest Group — “From 1869 to 1939 various workhouses, sheltering homes, orphanages and child care organizations in Great Britain immigrated over 100,000 orphaned, abandoned, pauper children ages 1 to 18 to Canada. Known as the British Home Children (BHC), life for these children coming alone to Canada to work as domestics and farm labourers forging ahead in a new land was not always easy.”\n\nSome would have you believe agencies, notably Barnardo’s, tore children away from a loving but impoverished British home, knowing there was a high likelihood they would be abused in Canada, so that the agency could benefit from a government subsidy.\n\nFollowing the death of his father in 1899, my grandfather was placed in the care of the Edmonton Board of Guardians. He was in the orphanage at Chase Farm School, Enfield. His mother died in 1903. On reaching school leaving age, about 13 he would have left the orphanage. At the time of the 1911 census, age 18, he was working as a coal hewer in South Wales.\n\nWas he better off in the mines of Wales than he would have been on a farm in Canada? Like many, my grandfather never mentioned his experience.\n\nPerhaps you remember the late Ryan Taylor, a highly respected Canadian genealogist. He made no secret that his grandfather was a British Home Child. It tuned out we had something in common — origins in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Ryan told me his fisherman grandfather’s father was drowned, mother was convicted of abusing her children. Ryan told me the family would get down on their knees to thank Dr. Barnardo for rescuing the children from that awful situation.\n\nThere were certainly many difficult situations for children in Canada, and in the UK. Despite claims that many in Canada were abused, and one is too many, I’ve seen no evidence the children were worse off in Canada than they would have been in the UK. Is that one of the myths perpetrated by “advocates”? Is it another myth that 12% of Canadians have a British Home Child ancestor? Where did that figure come from? Perhaps it’s an example of “lies, damn lies, and statistics”!\n\nLet’s celebrate British Home Child Day 2023, remembering them as builders of Canada, like so many other British immigrants over the years.\n\nTNA presents online talks for everyone, delivered by experts, specialists and guest speakers.
