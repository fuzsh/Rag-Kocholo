She was born in the Witchekan District, near Leoville, Saskatchewan to Lucy & George Cooling. She was the fourth of five children – Myrtle, Albert, Lorne and later Brenda. She moved to Mossbank where she attended school. She lived in the Nurse’s Residence with her Mom and sister Brenda, while her mother worked as a cook at the Hospital. They then moved to the house where Gramma Hutchinson lived. She met Werner at a house party and were married soon after on August 8, 1959 at the Central Lutheran Church in Moose Jaw. They moved to the farm and lived in the “Honeymoon Shack” until Werner built a new house for their growing family. They were blessed with three children – Kevin, Dale and Lisa. Irene was very well known for her sense of humour. For example, when she was in the hospital a couple weeks ago, the nurse came to check her blood sugar. She said, “Are you here to poke me again?” The nurse said, “Yes, which finger would you like to give me?” Irene quickly replied, “Guess!” Irene had many passions that enhanced her life. She always had a large vegetable garden and enjoyed many flower gardens. She sewed clothes for the family, knitted, crocheted and enjoyed quilting. Irene was an avid curler and usually curled locally with Joyce Stark, Erna Woit and Adeline Lizee. She often went into provincial playdowns with Pat Potts, Gwen Kowalski and Vivian Bath. Irene was active in the church and the Lutheran Ladies Group. She was the Church Council Secretary until January of this year. She was a hard-working farm wife. She baked the best bread and we didn’t even know what Town Bread tasted like. She cooked many field meals and filled in wherever help was needed on the farm– from raising chickens, turkeys and very mean geese, building bins, pouring concrete, filling diskers, driving truck during harvest or whatever was going on at the time. She was very happy when the boys got big enough to drive truck at harvest so she didn’t have to get in trouble all the time. She apparently never had the truck in the right place. They moved off the farm to Mossbank in 1984 to a new house that Werner built. They later moved into the Furrows and Faith Retirement Villa in the spring of 2023. Family was everything to Irene. Kevin married Denise and they have two sons, Clay (Taylor) and Cole (Mercedes). Dale married Merilee and they have two children; Daniel (Colleen) and their children Brody, Tessa and Calder; Brittany (Dillon) and their children Mya and Rylan. Lisa married Mike and they have two children Lane (Chaydin) and their children Wells and Bowen. Shelby (Clint) and their son Rudy. She put on many miles driving kids to swimming lessons, ball games and anything else they were involved in. Later when the grandchildren arrived she loved being with them and watching all their sports and activities. She loved having them around to help bake bread, play games and dig worms in the garden. The Great Grandchildren brought even more joy. She enjoyed watching their activities and just cuddling and visiting with them. There were many large family gatherings but most notably in the Christmas season. Christmas Eve was always a special time when the family went to the Candlelight Service and then came back to Gramma’s to open presents. Her birthday was on December 27 and that day was almost like another Christmas – Turkey dinner and lots of family fun.

He was born on May 28, 1948 at St. Joseph's Hospital, Gravelbourg to Wilfred and Frieda Bassendowski, a brother to Garry, Judy and Joyce. As all farm boys do, he grew up participating in all aspects of farm life - fieldwork, cattle and always repairs to whatever implement needed fixing at the time. In that, he had a learned and experienced mentor in his Dad. After school in Shamrock and Hodgeville, he bought the original Bassendowski homestead land and farmed with his Dad until Wilfred retired. He loved farming, especially harvest, but his passion was engineering He loved dreaming up new inventions that would make farm work easier or more efficient. His ultimate achievement in this was building his own header for the combine. In 1972 he married the love of his life, Daphne Busch, daughter of Ernest and Winnie Busch. After three years of living in the two-room \"honeymoon cottage\" in Shamrock, he built a house on the farm with help from numerous friends and neighbours. They welcomed Brendan Edward and Reilly Erin into their lives and their family was complete. It is impossible to express the joy they brought into his life. It is hard to list his interests because he was interested in everything, He loved sports - playing ball and hockey himself and later coaching his kids He golfed, he fished, he skied. He was an ardent Blue Jays fan. He loved playing cards. Every occasion at his Mom and Dad's or with the Arnolds or the Busch's included some very competitive card games. These last few years it was his delight to teach his grandchildren how to play and nothing pleased them more than to beat Papa at his own game! He was dedicated to the Shamrock community. He sat on several boards; Co-op, hall, rink, RM council, and United Church at various times but found he would rather do the work than go to meetings. As a teenager, he worked on building the rink and later remodelled the kitchen. He helped build the addition to the hall and built all the cupboards. He made a metal bridge to cross the river at the golf course in Shamrock Park. Finally, he built the gates to the cemetery where he will be laid to rest. He loved going on holidays. He had so much fun with the kids going on trips together. When he retired, he and Daphne went on innumerable holidays in Canada and internationally. He had such a deep love for his family - Daphne, his wife of almost 52 years; his children Brendan and Reilly, and his \"favourite son-in-law\" Levis Lavoie. He was so proud of his grandchildren: Emery, Kieran, and Easton Bassendowski, Lucy Lavoie, and Ryann and Roman Remple. He loved his extended family: brother Garry (Sharon), nieces Carol (Don) and Darcie; sister Judy (Jake) Hort, nephews Todd (Sandra), Trevor (Charlene), Trent, John, and niece Pattie; sister Joyce (Robert) Berge, nephew Caldon (Brandy) and niece Lexi (Patrick); brother-in-law Don Osicki, nephew Ryan (Ashley), and niece Tenile (Douglas); brother-in-law Kim (Penni) Busch, niece Janaya (Al), and nephew Tyler (Malia); mother-in-law Winnie Busch. He had a special attachment to the great nieces and nephews and his cousins always played a special role in his life. He was predeceased by his parents: Wilfred and Frieda Bassendowski, his father-in-law Ernest Busch and his beloved sister-in-law Dale Osicki. He will be missed by everyone who came into contact with him. His smile, his warm personality, and his kindness drew people to him and he was their friend for life. We cannot say thank you enough to Drs. Pillay and Ramlakhan and the staff at St. Joseph's Hospital for their care and compassion when treating Wayne. Between his accidents and various illnesses, they got to know him very well. A Celebration of Wayne’s Life will be held on Saturday, May 11, 2024 @ 1:00 p.m. at the Shamrock Community Hall.

Ken dearly loved and cherished his wife and family;he was so proud of them and all of their accomplishments. Ken was best known for his giggle and laugh, it was contagious and could be heard at a distance, sometimes that giggle would come out at inappropriate times. Ken had a very kind and caring personality, children were drawn to him as he always tried to make time to play, listen or even just sit and watch sports or a special show on tv. He always showed interest in any activity, dance or sport the grandchildren were involved in. Ken enjoyed visiting family and friends always joking while playing cards, laughing and reminiscing about the “good times”. Ken loved his sports whether playing or watching. He always held out hope for the Toronto Maple Leafs and would cheer for them relentlessly. Ken was involved in many sports himself. He spoke of playing hockey with the Glen Bain Helicopters and other rec teams. He enjoyed the family curling team as well as curling with friends. He played baseball with the Glen Bain Tramps and later years played slow pitch. Fun times. Good memories. He may have been a little competitive but always fought for fairness one way or another. Ken’s grandchildren loved to hear grandpa’s stories, especially the ones that may have gotten him into trouble. The family had cattle up until the early 2000’s, but farming was truly his way of life and he loved it. Taking care of the land was so important to him. Harvest was his favorite time of the year. There were lean and bountiful years, but over time things became easier with newer and more efficient equipment. The kids always came home to help, especially with seeding and harvest and continued to do so with their families. Grandpa would never turn down a combine ride. He was always so proud of what we had accomplished and worked so hard for. Ken loved traveling with the family to various destinations to the Caribbean, Mexico, Hawaii, Canada and the USA. Even with the ambulance rides, sting ray incident, or armed soldier interrogations, etc, etc. It was all part of the great adventure. For his 60th Birthday, a special trip was made to LA to watch his Toronto Maple Leafs play for the first time live, and to Ontario to visit family and see his first Blue Jay game. Ken was no stranger to hard work from a young age working on the farm with his father and brothers a mile west of Glen Bain. He started out working elevator crews and loading grain ships at the port of Churchill. After he married, he farmed during the summer and during winters worked at a ranch in Tompkins and Frontier as well as oil rigs and others to get through high interest rates and droughts of the 1980’s. Ken drove Glen Bain fuel truck for many years along with other part time work. He was a Glen Bain CO-OP board member for 30 years until he was no longer able to physically contributed. Also, an active member of the Glen Bain Lions club for almost 20 years, always willing to help anyone wherever or whomever when needed. Ken is predeceased by his father Joseph Kornaga and mother, Evelyn Kornaga, and his brother Stanely who died at birth (1952). Ken will be lovingly remembered and greatly missed by his wife of 45+ years, Judy, son Clinton Kornaga (Katrina) Emily & Grace, son Justin Kornaga (Amanda) Joe & Heath, daughter Kendal Wallace (Gord)Gavin & Kenzie. Siblings Edward, Fred and Shirly (Robert Laverdiere), and all the rest of the families and friends in Ken’s life.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nLorne Roger Lightbody - December 15, 1931 - March 09, 2024\n\nDeparted: 03/09/2024 (Assiniboia)\n\nObituary Preview: Lorne Lightbody of Gravelbourg, Saskatchewan passed away peacefully on March 9, 2024, at the age of 92 years.

Dale is survived by his sister, Lois Feucht (Schreiner); brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, Bruce (Sandra) Handley, Marie Keenan, Joseph (Theresa Handley), Belinda Johnstone, Mark (Kim) Handley, and numerous nieces and nephews. Predeceased by his wife of 55 years, Opal Feucht; his parents, Carl and Edna (Lunam) Feucht; infant brother; brother-in-law, Bob Schreiner; parents-in-law, William and Antoinette (DeLaronde) Handley; brothers-in-law, John Keenan and Garnet Johnstone. Dale and Opal met in high school in Meadow Lake and were married on November 3, 1962. While Opal attended business college in Saskatoon, Dale worked briefly at the Nickel mine in Thompson, Manitoba. Missing his family too much, he moved back to Saskatchewan and started working at the Co-op in North Battleford. As Dale’s career advanced with the Co-op, so did the frequency of relocations. Dale and Opal moved to Lloydminster, then Vermillion, and then returned to Lloydminster. During this time, Opal was employed as a ward/unit clerk in the hospital labs of each city/town. Dale became Co-op General Manager in St. Paul, then Wadena/Kuroki, and finally Assiniboia/Crane Valley/Willow Bunch. In 1985, Dale and Opal bought the Macleods franchise in Assiniboia. When Macleods became True Value, they also purchased the building/parking lot beside. They ran the store until 2006 when they decided to retire at ages 63 and 61 so they could permanently travel, which they enjoyed. They continued to lease the building/parking lot to Fields. They did mention at times after retiring that they missed visiting and seeing their customers. Dale and Opal both enjoyed visiting with family and friends, hiking, curling, kayaking, skiing, walking around Assiniboia for miles daily, and volunteering in the community. Mainly anything that allowed them to be outdoors and active until they each became ill. They traveled to other countries, took two cruises, and were \"snowbirds\" traveling South to meet up with family for 14 years. They met so many wonderful people and have strong friendships to this day. After Opal passed away in 2018, Dale continued to travel South meeting up with friends and/or to Comox Valley, BC, where his son and family reside. Hiking, kayaking, and swimming up until heading home in mid-September 2023. In February 2023, Dale went with his daughter and family to Costa Rica where he was snorkeling, fishing, kayaking, and playing with his great-grandchildren. Dale also went to Las Vegas, his son's wedding in Calgary, Calgary Stampede, and camping/hot springs all through BC with traveling friend Merna (Powell River) during Spring/Summer 2023. Dale was enjoying every minute of life until he became ill in late October/November 2023. Dale loved his family and being around his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. We are all so sad to lose this wonderful kind man but grateful to have so many memories. Many people have told me over the years they have never met such a genuine and truly kind man. During the past four months while in the hospital, he did not ring his call buzzer - as he did not want to bother the busy nurses - even as sick as he was at times. My brothers and I have never heard my father say an unkind or judgmental statement about anyone ever - instead, he always found the good in people. He loved living and often told his kids “If I wake up in the morning and the sun is shining it's a good day - just live and enjoy life - don't worry so much about things, everything always works out. We will miss you Dad - especially being able to call/Facetime or visit you almost daily. A family prayer service and graveside service will be held and scattering of ashes in various places Dad and Mom loved to spend time. Tributes in Dale’s memory may be made to the Allan Blair Cancer Centre, 4101 Dewdney Ave., Regina, SK S4T 7T1.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nJoseph Victor Guy Lalonde - September 27, 1931 - March 05, 2024\n\nDeparted: 03/05/2024 (Assiniboia)\n\nObituary Preview: Victor Lalonde It is with deep sorrow that the family of Victor Lalonde announces the passing of their much-loved Husband, Dad, Grandpa, Papa, and Great-Grandpa on Tuesday, March 5, 2024, at the Foyer d'Youville in Gravelbourg, SK, with his daughters by his side.

Perry passed away in the loving presence of his family on Wednesday, February 28th, 2024, after battling cancer for over two years. While he fiercely fought past his original prognosis of only 6-12 months, it is not easy to accept this passing. Perry endured many health issues throughout his life, including a severe tractor accident in 2000, but always fought hard with the grace of God to recover. Perry now leaves behind in mourning his daughter Mattesyn (Jase), mother Kay Jones, brothers Emerson (Karen) and Donald, and sister-in-law Michelle (Terry). He is also survived by numerous nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, cousins, & friends who held a special place in his life. Perry is predeceased by his father Charlie Jones and brother Leonard (Michelle) Jones. Perry will be greatly missed by many. He was an active asset in his community by serving many years on various boards including Bengough Parks & Rec., Bengough RM 40, & St. Michael’s Catholic Church Board. Perry was always willing to lend a helping hand or volunteer where help was needed. If you were nearby, he would rope you into volunteering too! Perry entered the workforce full-time at the age of 17 shortly after his father suffered a heart attack. Perry made many connections throughout his years in the oilfield and gained knowledge that would often come in use while managing his own endeavors after he became a full time mixed farmer in 1998. His daughter Mattesyn admires how he always knew a way to do anything, and if he didn’t have experience doing it, he could always think up a way to get it done. She also admires his courage. Whether it was facing off with angry cows or pushing through every health battle and obstacle, her Dad was very brave. Even in his final hours, Perry displayed strength, reassurance, and comfort. While Perry fought hard to remain here, he knew he had salvation in Jesus. He is going to be so deeply mourned and missed, but we have peace knowing that there is a place prepared for him where he will suffer no more. Prayer Service will take place Wednesday, March 6th, 6:30pm, at St. Michael’s Parish in Bengough. Funeral service will take place on Friday, March 8th, 1:00pm, at St. Michael’s Parish in Bengough.

Loved ones left to hold his memory close include his wife Verna, daughter Michelle (Jody) Friemark, Brett BeBeau, Devin (Krista) BeBeau; grandchildren Carter (Jerrica) Freimark, Corey Freimark, Jaclyn (Brett) Roach; Jaycie (Justin) Hodel; Madison (Kaylor) Freimark, Shayna (Shadoe) Konan, Brayden (Morgan) BeBeau, Ayana (Zack) BeBeau, Nerissa BeBeau, Bostin BeBeau; and great-grandchildren Everly and Harlow Roach; Connor Hodel; Emberlee, Dawsyn, and Keira Konan; Blaike, Beckham, Beckett, and Bowie BeBeau; and Haven Fleury. Along with siblings Yvonne Fender, Denyce Coldwell, Beverly (Les) Coldwell, Blaine (Yvonne) BeBeau, Brenda (Mike) Newman, and sister-in-law Joan BeBeau; and numerous nieces, nephews and friends. He is preceded in death by his parents Louis “Buck\" and Marion; parents-in-law Eleanor and Harold Moore; brothers Wilfrid and LaVerne, brothers in law Harvey Fender and Edmund Coldwell, and sister-in-law Kathleen BeBeau, Brian was born in Park Falls, Wisconsin on April 9, 1949 to Louis “Buck” and Marion BeBeau. In 1952 the family moved to Canada settling in Willows, Saskatchewan where they owned and ran BeBeau’s General Store. Brian attended the Willows School until it closed and then the Assiniboia Roman Catholic School. Brian met the love of his life, Verna Moore, on November 11, 1966. Shortly after they met, he told his mom that he was going to marry that girl. On August 16, 1969 he did marry her and they spent the next 54 years building their life together in Assiniboia and farming their land outside of Limerick. In 1973 they welcomed their first child Michelle and over the next three years they added Brett and Devin to the family. Brian was a proud and dedicated father, always putting his children’s needs ahead of his. Family time was the best time. Many memories were made taking trips to Alaska, Wisconsin and Hawaii, as well as spending summers at Thomson Lake. He made sure that every Christmas was as special as it could be. The traditions created will forever be passed down. Brian started working at John Deere when he was 15 years old. He started cleaning and organizing parts all while learning the ins and outs of the machinery. In 1975 he bought into Southern Equipment where he would proudly run the parts department for the next 31 years. There were many family dinners interrupted by after hour parts calls, but he never complained as he knew how important it was for his customers to get the part they needed. On Friday afternoons, you’d often find Brian and his partners enjoying a few drinks upstairs in the office telling stories and laughing the week away. His sense of humour and distinctive laugh were two of his best traits. He was fortunate to travel the world with his John Deere family and continued to travel with Verna after his retirement in 2006. They spent their winters RVing in Arizona where many new friendships were formed. Their last vacation together was to Toronto in September 2023. Together they explored the city and watched the Blue Jays play baseball. Brian was a trooper, always hauling around the many packages Verna would purchase. Brian was a true outdoorsman spending his free time fishing, hunting, and trap shooting. He was a founding lifetime member of the Assiniboia Trap Club and won many division shoots across North America at the provincial, state, and national levels. He spent many years teaching the youth around Assiniboia hunter safety and was a member of the Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation. Conservation was important to him, and he could often be found raising and releasing pheasants and volunteering with Ducks Unlimited. While Brian had many passions in life, his true passion was his family. His steadfast love for them was undeniable. From the time his children were born, up until the day he passed, there wasn't anything he wouldn’t do to for them. He lived his life for his family and spent as much time as possible with them. Being together for the little things was just as important to him as being together for the big things. Brian and Verna put many miles travelling to watch their grandchildren compete in hockey and football games and attended as many piano recitals and drama productions as they could. Brian passed on many lifelong lessons that will forever be cherished by his family and friends.

After meeting and marrying Mom they began raising their family and moved from Montreal to the small Quebec towns of Portneuf Station and Pont-Rouge. They started their migration west when Dad began his career with Parks Canada, first living and working in Ottawa and then in Point Pelee, Riding Mountain, Elk Island and Yoho National Parks. The next move was to Winnipeg in 1973, to Parks Canada’s Prairie and Northern Regional Office. The family lived there while the boys pursued their education, after which Mom and Dad moved to Calgary in 1985. Dad retired in 1991 after a long and rewarding career. He loved being in the parks and “out in the field”, and especially enjoyed the after work down-time spent with his park warden and biologist friends at some remote patrol cabin. Mom and Dad shared many adventures over their years together. They travelled abroad several times and they toured Canada and beyond in their bright red camper van post-retirement. Hiking and skiing in the mountains with their Calgary friends were favourite past-times and kept them both hale and hearty. Mom and Dad always looked forward to time spent with the kids, grandkids and great-grandkids at the Calgary home-base or wherever we kids happened to be living. Dad made Christmas visits particularly special for the young ones by ensuring that Santa made a personal visit. We’ll remember Dad for his gentle and caring nature, the smell of pipe tobacco (before he wisely gave that up!), his love of a good scotch and his signature laugh. He will be dearly missed. A celebration of his life will be scheduled in the near future.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nJoharma Van Meesen - January 06, 1958 - February 11, 2024\n\nDeparted: 02/11/2024 (Assiniboia)\n\nObituary Preview: Joharma Van Meesen, beloved mother, grandmother, partner, and friend, passed away at her home on February 11, 2024, at the age of 66.
