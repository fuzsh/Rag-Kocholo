        "text": "(1895–1979). John Diefenbaker was the prime minister of Canada from 1957 to 1963. During his career he worked to include people of many different backgrounds in Canadian life and government.\n\nJohn George Diefenbaker was born on September 18, 1895, in Neustadt, Ontario. In 1903 his family moved to Saskatchewan, where they lived on a small farm. He went to high school in Saskatoon and then attended the University of Saskatchewan. After serving in World War I, he returned to the university and got a law degree. He became a lawyer in 1919.\n\nIn 1956 Diefenbaker became the leader of the party, which by then had been renamed the Progressive Conservative Party. The following year the Progressive Conservatives won the elections, and he became the prime minister. During his time as prime minister he introduced several laws to help people in need. He set in motion a bill of rights for Canadians, and he gave Canada’s native peoples the right to vote in national elections. He also appointed the first woman to head a major government department.\n\nDiefenbaker worked for social justice outside of Canada as well. He spoke out against the system of apartheid in South Africa. He also supported independence for Britain’s colonies in Africa.\n\nIn 1962 Diefenbaker’s government faced a difficult issue. The Soviet Union had placed missiles on the island of Cuba. The missiles could have reached either the United States or Canada if they were launched. The United States therefore asked Canada to place its troops on high alert. Diefenbaker did not decide what to do right away, but he did go along with the request from the United States eventually.\n\nSome people were unhappy with the way Diefenbaker handled that situation. The following year his party lost the elections and Diefenbaker lost his job. Although he was no longer prime minister, Diefenbaker kept his seat in the House of Commons. He continued to be active in the Parliament, and he often questioned the actions of the new government. He died on August 16, 1979, in Ottawa, Ontario."
