        "text": "15 November 1965\n\nAt 10:00am on the morning of Monday, 15 November 1965, a workman at the Lemieux Island filtration plant released sodium fluoride into Ottawa’s water mains. A few hours later, the same thing occurred at the Britannia filtration plant. Fluoridation had finally arrived in the Capital after ten years of sometimes bitter fighting that pitted most of city council and the medical profession against an alliance of grassroots anti-fluoridation advocates. The waterworks commissioner said that it would take roughly a half a day for the newly-treated water, fluoridated to a level of 1 part per million, to reach household taps. Dr. Joseph Greenblatt, president of the Ottawa Academy of Medicine, applauded the news as did city dentists who said the children would no longer have to take fluoride tablets or drops to protect their teeth from cavities. Opponents were dismayed seeing fluoridation as a violation of civil liberties and a danger to health. One anti-fluoridation activist went so far as to say he would dig his own well to avoid drinking municipal water.\n\nResearch into fluoridation of municipal water dates back to 1909 when two American dentists, Frederick McKay and G.V. Black began to study why the teeth of residents, particularly children, of Colorado Springs, Colorado were being discoloured—an affliction known as Colorado Brown Stain. Inexplicably, sufferers of the affliction seemed resistant to dental decay. While the researchers postulated that the explanation might be found in the water, the culprit, fluoride, was not discovered until the 1930s when Dr. H. Trendley Dean of the U.S. National Institute of Health and his staff determined that the people in Colorado Springs were suffering from overdoses of fluoride in their drinking water. They subsequently concluded that fluoride of up to 1 ppm in drinking water was safe with only a small percentage of drinkers suffering mild fluorosis at this level of concentration. Recalling the earlier findings of McKay and Black, Dean wondered whether low levels of fluoride would deter tooth decay. To test this hypothesis, Grand Rapids, Michigan began to artificially fluoridate its municipal water supply in 1945 initially under the auspices of the U.S. Surgeon General and later the National Institute of Dental Research. The multi-year test confirmed the effectiveness of fluoride in improving dental health in children, with the rate of dental caries falling by 60 per cent in the cohort born after the introduction of fluoride into the municipal drinking water.\n\nThis result was later replicated in other studies both in the United States and Canada. The first Canadian city to fluoridate its municipal water was Brampton in 1946. The ten-year experiment conducted by Ontario’s Health Department examined the effectiveness of a 1.2 ppm concentration of fluoride in the water on children’s teeth. As controls, the study also looked at Sarnia, whose municipal water supply had a very low level of natural fluoride, and Stratford, whose water contained a high level of natural fluorine. The study confirmed the Grand Rapids, Michigan results. The rate of dental caries in Brantford children, which had been roughly comparable to the situation in Sarnia, had fallen sharply and was now similar to the rate of tooth decay in Stratford’s children. The cost was small; roughly twelve to seventeen cents per person per year but could be reduced still further to about six cents per person per year if the municipality switched to a cheaper compound, sodium silicofluoride. Yet another ten-year study, this time in New York state, corroborated the results. This experiment looked at the effectiveness of fluoridated water in reducing caries in the town of Newburgh, compared with the “control” community of nearby Kingston whose water was not treated.\n\nBy 1955, fluoridated water had been endorsed by the U.S. Public Health Service and the American Dental Association. Here in Canada, the Dental Health Division of the Department of National Health said that “research has clearly indicated that fluoridation of water results in a two-thirds reduction in tooth decay.” With only 20 per cent of dental needs of Canadians being met by dentists, it was argued that fluoridation would have a marked positive impact on the dental health of Canadians. Following the release of the Brantford study, fluoridation was also endorsed by Ontario’s Health Minister, the Canadian Medical Association, the Canadian Dental Association, and the Canadian Public Health Association.\n\nThese developments were being closely watched in Ottawa where the level of natural fluoridation was low (roughly 0.2-0.3 ppm) and the rate of caries among children was high—three times the rate as in similar age groups in communities with fluoridated water. Ottawa’s Board of Control (akin to a municipal “cabinet”) discussed adding sodium fluoride into municipal water as early as the spring of 1953, citing among other things, the Brantford study. However, the idea was shelved, principally owing to the cost, estimated at $60,000 per year.\n\nIn 1955, fluoridation was again discussed by Ottawa’s municipal authorities, first by the Board of Control and later by the entire City Council. Following a Board of Control recommendation, City Council voted 17-6 in favour of fluoridating the capital’s water supply. Controversially, City Council voted against holding a plebiscite on the issue by the same 17-6 vote. Mayor Whitton, who objected to both decisions, noted a recent ruling by the Chief Justice of New Brunswick that municipalities in that province were not empowered to fluoridate their water. In reply, one alderman on the side of the majority, tartly replied that Ottawa came under the Ontario Municipal Act, and that the New Brunswick ruling did not apply.\n\nHowever, the issue quickly came to Ontario courts when Forest Hill, a community that purchased its water from Metropolitan Toronto, challenged Metro Toronto’s decision to fluoridate its water. Forest Hill contended that “metro powers did not extend to administering medicine on a mass scale.” The lawyer for Metro Toronto contended that it could fluoridate the water as long as it provided pure and wholesome water to Forest Hill as specified under its contract. The lawyer contended that had Metro Toronto blended naturally fluoridated water from another source with its local supply, there would have been nothing to argue about.\n\nThe issue went all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada. In June 1957, it ruled in a 5-2 decision that Metro Toronto had no legal right to fluoridate water sold to Forest Hill.\n\nAlthough Ottawa sold water to Eastview (Vanier) and Rockcliffe Park under contract in a similar fashion, the situation was not the same as the water contracts permitted fluoridation if it were to become legally possible. Ottawa City Council, led by fluoridation activist Alderwoman May Nickson, passed a motion for a municipal bill in the Ontario Legislature to permit Ottawa to fluoridate its water.\n\nIn February 1958, Don Morrow, the Progressive Conservative MLA for West Ottawa, introduced a private member’s bill to allow Ottawa to fluoridate its municipal water. It was turned down by the Legislature’s Private Members Committee. The following year, Alderwoman Nickson brought forward another fluoridation motion that was subsequently passed by Ottawa’s City Council. Two days before going to the Legislature, Premier Frost, faced with what was becoming a serious political football, did what every good politician would do in this situation, he punted. He announced his opposition to additional fluoridation and appointed a three-person commission headed by Justice Kenneth Morden to study the issue. Ottawa withdrew its motion. Oddly, the eight Ontario communities, including Brantford, that fluoridated their water could continue to do so. However, a plebiscite could reverse this. This principle was not two-way. Municipalities that opted to fluoridate following a positive plebiscite could not do so.\n\nIt took two years for the Morden commission to report back to government; many thought the commission was dragging its feet. The commission overwhelming endorsed fluoridation and recommended that the government empower municipalities to fluoridate their water. It rejected the argument that fluoridation was a denial of a fundamental civil liberty or a violation of the Food and Drug Act. On the basis of the evidence, the commission maintained that there was no danger, and no fluorosis of esthetic significance associated with a level of fluoride of one part per million. (To give a sense of the magnitude of this amount, its the equivalent to one inch in a distance of sixteen miles.) The Ontario Government dropped its opposition to the fluoridation of municipal water.\n\nHere in Ottawa, city authorities again endorsed fluoridation but this time the issue would go to Ottawa voters for approval. The same battle lines as in the past were drawn. Opponents were a mixture of people, led by R.D. Richardson, a high school teacher and president of the Civil Rights Association. Some argued that fluorine was a deadly poison, and fluoridation caused everything from bone disorders, kidney problems, and Down’s Syndrome, to sinus conditions, loss of memory, diarrhoea, constipation, nail-biting and bed-wetting. Others objected on religious grounds with some against all public health measures, including chlorination, pasteurization, vaccinations and immunizations. Still others saw fluoridation as an attack on civil liberties and even as a communist plot to take over the city.\n\nThe vast majority of the medical and dental professions was in favour of fluoridation. For them, the results were clear. Fluoridation substantially reduced dental decay with few if any side-effects. While they agreed that fluorine, the element in fluoride compounds, was a deadly poison, the same was true for chlorine, used to purify water, and for iodine, added to common table salt to ward off goiter. They also denied that there was any evidence of long-term ill effects from trace amounts of fluoride in the water.\n\nA plebiscite was held during the civic elections held in December 1962. Despite the endorsement of fluoridation by officialdom, Ottawa citizens turned it down in a close vote—45,702 versus 43,924. In contrast, Toronto residents voted in favour in a similar referendum. This was not the end of the story, however. After renewed calls for fluoridation, another plebiscite was held in Ottawa in December 1964. This time, Ottawa residents voted in favour—58,234 to 36,079. It took a few months for the civic machinery to call for tender and buy the equipment before fluoridation finally beginning in mid-November 1965.\n\nWhat is the situation today, you may ask? Ottawa continues to fluoridate its municipal water but at a rate of 0.7 parts per million, the level currently advised by Health Canada in light of other sources of fluoride in people’s diets. (FYI: trace amounts of fluoride are present in a variety of foods and drink. Tea has a lot of fluoride in it, ranging from 0.30 to 6.5 parts per million or mg/L, 0.07 to 1.5 mg/cup when brewed with distilled water. The safe upper limit of fluoride has been set at 10 mgs per day by the United States and 7 mgs per day by the European Union.) Municipal wells operated by the City of Ottawa are not artificially fluoridated. Water from these wells have naturally-sourced fluoride ranging from 0.05 parts per million (0.05mg/L) in Greely to 0.65 parts per million (0.65mg/L) in Munster.\n\nOpposition to fluoridation continues today in some quarters despite continued endorsement of health professions and organizations around the world including the World Health Organization, Health Canada, the American and Canadian Dental Associations, and the US Centers for Disease Control. (The CDC believes that fluoridation is one of the ten greatest public health achievements of the twentieth century.) Owing to this opposition, some Canadian municipalities have stopped fluoridating their water in recent years. In 2022, the water of only 39 per cent of Canadians was artificially fluoridated, down from 44 per cent in 2007. However, there is evidence that the cessation of fluoridation causes a rise in caries in children. For example, a recent study funded by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research that examined the experience of Calgary, which stopped fluoridating their water in 2011 and Edmonton, which has fluoridated its water since 1967, concluded that Calgary’s children had a significantly higher rate of caries that children in Edmonton.\n\nSources:\n\nBerger, David. 2021. “A tale of two cities finds that community water fluoridation prevents caries,” ADA News, 21 August.\n\nCity of Ottawa, 2024. “Adding fluoride to drinking water.”\n\nGovernment of Canada, 2022. “The State of Community Water Fluoridation in Canada.”\n\nHarvard T.H.

This remarkable Tudor-Gothic castle, reminiscent of Hampton Court Palace in Britain, complete with towers and crenellations, was named in honour of H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, the youngest son of Queen Victoria, who was governor general of Canada from 1911 to 1916. The structure was originally built to house the Customs Department and Ottawa’s Customs Examination Warehouse. It opened for business with the public on 17 July 1916. Staff had earlier moved into the building in stages. The Connaught Building is currently the head office of the Canada Revenue Agency.\n\nIn 1906, the Dominion government publicized its intention to acquire the western side of Sussex Street (it did not become Sussex Drive until 1953) from Rideau Street to Bruyère Street. It had already purchased the neighbouring block from Bruyère Street to Cathcart Street the previous year as the site for the Royal Mint. The newly purchased real estate was initially planned as the location for at least two monumental departmental buildings to house the growing federal public service which was then spread around the city in rented premises. However, changing governments and priorities led to many delays. After the Sussex Street location was declared unsuitable in 1912 by the Borden government, federal authorities expropriated the northern side of Wellington Street, west of Parliament Hill for these buildings in the area then known as Upper Town. Further delayed by World War I and government indecision, these two buildings—the Confederation and Justice Buildings as well as the neighbouring Supreme Court—were finally constructed in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nPart of the Sussex Street property that the government had acquired in 1906 was repurposed as the site for a new Customs building. The chosen architectural plan for the structure was a scaled down version of an earlier design that David Ewart, the Dominion Chief Architect, had drawn up for one of the two proposed departmental buildings. Its Tudor-Gothic style complemented the design of the Parliament Buildings a short distance away. This architectural style had been chosen for the neighbouring Mint building, and the Victoria Memorial Museum (now the Museum of Nature). Both were designed by David Ewart of the Public Works Department. All three structures share many design elements.\n\nThe architectural community’s initial reception to Ewart’s design for a departmental building was decidedly negative. According to a May 1910 article in Construction, a journal for the Canadian architectural engineering and contracting industry, Ewart’s design either looked like “a packing box” or “a cross between a fancy jail and a chocolate factory with a dash of high school thrown in.” Part of this response likely reflected discontentment with the government’s decision to set aside the winning design for this building proposed by a private Montreal-based architectural firm in favour of Ewart’s design—a possible case of sour grapes. Construction called the government’s decision “a gross breach of faith.” In the end, neither building was constructed.\n\nWhen the smaller Customs Building was finally completed in 1916, essentially using the same Tudor-Gothic design, views had mellowed. In an April 1917 article, Construction now called the building “an imposing addition to our public buildings” that “harmoniz[ed] with other fine structures of the Capital.”\n\nThe site, dimensions and general character of the Customs building was approved by Order-in-Council in the spring of 1912, with excavation work for the foundation beginning shortly thereafter using unskilled “day labour.” However, this work was discontinued when the workers could not find bedrock. The Public Works Department called in the Foundation Company of Montreal to take over. After taking borings where the foundation piers were to be installed, the company discovered large boulders, sand, gravel and water. It concluded that the site of the building was either over a fault or a deep depression in the bedrock. The close proximity of the Rideau Canal might also have been a factor, as the water level in the canal was roughly ten feet above the level of the building’s basement floor. The Foundation Company got a good deal from the government to excavate and build the foundation in these challenging circumstances—its cost plus 12 per cent.\n\nThe call for tenders for the construction of the actual building went out in the spring of 1913. The Simcoe Construction Company made the winning bid of $993,000, considerably lower that the $1.4 million cost estimated by David Ewart. Simcoe then transferred the project to Crockett and Tharle of Rivière du Loup and Fort William. However, when little work had been accomplished by mid-1914, a fed-up Public Works Department cancelled the contract and gave it to the P. Lyll & Company, one of the losing initial bidders, for $1,173,000, less any expenses the government had incurred up until that point.\n\nThe building, completed in the spring of 1916, was 332 feet long and 88 feet deep. It had six above ground storeys, with an additional two in the tower, and a basement level. The structure was considered fire-proof with its outer walls stone-backed with brick and lined with terra cotta blocks. The lower storey facing Sussex Street and the ends of the building were faced with granite, with the remainder Nepean stone and Wallace stone edgings. All interior floors were made of concrete, with hardwood finishes in the offices. Hallways and staircases were clad in marble and marble mosaic. Elevators served all floors.\n\nThere were three main staircases to the upstairs offices, accessible from the Mackenzie Avenue side, which was a floor higher than on the Sussex Street side, owing to the slope of the land. The main staircase was located in the principal entrance off of Mackenzie Avenue. The wide marble and bronze staircase went to the top floor. Secondary staircases were located at each end of the building. The Sussex Street level was used for the Customs Examining Warehouse, the interior of which was finished with grey silicate brick. The goods entrance to the warehouse was at the rear of the building accessible via a covered driveway under Mackenzie Avenue.\n\nDuring World War I, the ground floor of the building was also used by the Red Cross Society where it made up parcels that it sent overseas every two weeks. On the fifth floor, the Maycourt Cutting Society had an office. Anybody in need of yarn to knit socks for men at the front could go there to acquire yarn.\n\nExterior and interior pictures as well as floor plans for the new Customs building can be found in the April 1917 edition of Construction magazine. Oddly, there is no reference to David Ewart, the designing architect in the article. Ewart had retired in 1914 as Dominion Chief Architect, a post he had held since 1896. An excellent Urbsite Blog story on the Connaught building hypothesises that Ewart’s resignation may have been partly due to problems with the Victoria Memorial Museum that he had designed a decade earlier. (See Tales from Castle Connaught by Urbsite.BlogSpot.com.) Shortly after the museum was completed in 1911, cracks had begun to appear in its tower owing to settling, its foundation having been laid on unstable clay. Much of the tower had to be dismantlement in 1915 for safety reasons. However, age was more likely the reason for his departure. Ewart was 73 years old when he retired from Public Works, long past the typical retirement age.\n\nEwart was replaced by the politically well-connected Edgar Lewis Horwood as Dominion Chief Architect in 1914. Horwood had been the architect of the Carnegie Library (the site of the main branch of the Ottawa Public Library on Metcalfe Street) and the Citizen Building on Sparks Street. (Both structures were later demolished.) Oddly again, as the Urbsite blog story notes, the Construction article seems to give credit for the Customs building’s design to Horwood, but consistently misspelt his name as “Harwood.” His name was even misspelt on blueprint-type drawings of the building printed by the magazine. Presumably, however, the Public Works Department provided these plans to Construction, so perhaps all the blame shouldn’t rest with the magazine. Horwood did not last long in his post, resigning in 1917 to return to private practice in Ottawa.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1973, the interior of the Connaught Building received what was described as a “facelift” by the Ottawa Journal, at a cost of roughly $2.8 million. It was more of a hatchet job than a tasteful remodelling. Gone went the building’s old, biaxial plan. Taking advantage of high ceilings, new floors were also installed that did not line up with existing windows. When the Connaught Building was designated as a heritage building in 1988, its underlying heritage character statement called the 1973 renovations “generally unsympathetic to the heritage character of the property” and recommended that “every opportunity should be taken to reintroduce a more compatible continuity between exterior and interior, particularly in the lobbies and circulation areas, and to enhance the symmetrical, Beaux Arts intentions of the original design.”\n\nDespite the butchering of the interior space, we can still appreciate the exterior of this magnificent building. The Connaught Building remains an important part of Ottawa’s built heritage, and an enduring element of David Ewart’s architectural legacy in the city.\n\nSources:\n\nCanada’s Historic Places, 2024. “Connaught Building.”\n\nConstruction, 1910. “Proposed Government Building, Ottawa,” Vol. 3 No. 6, May.\n\n—————-, 1917. “New Customs Examination Warehouse, Ottawa,” Vol. 10.

Tales from Castle Connaught.\n\n28 August 1919\n\nIt was August 1919. Less than nine months had passed since the guns fell silent in France and Belgium, and scarcely two months had elapsed from the signing of the Treaty of Versailles that officially ended the Great War. While everybody was elated that the fighting was finally over, and their boys back home, even the victors in this brutal conflict were traumatized. Although Canada had been largely spared the property destruction caused by the war, close to 500,000 men had served in the trenches, on the sea and in the air. More than 60,000 never came home. Tens of thousands more bore the scars of wounds, both physical and mental. It was a rare Canadian family that had not lost a loved one or friend. To make matters worse, the economy was in a shambles. Inflation was high and rising, the consequences of massive wartime spending. Unemployment too was on the rise as servicemen were de-mobilized with few jobs to go to as factories slowed production as government orders for munitions and other war-related supplies dried up.\n\nBut spirits were lifted by a Royal Visit by Edward, the Prince of Wales, the oldest son of King George V. The prince had served during the Great War in France, and was widely known as the soldier-prince. Although he had volunteered for active service in 1914, he was not permitted in the front lines owing to his position as heir to the throne. Joining the Grenadier Guards, he became a staff officer to Sir John French, commander of the British Expeditionary Force in France. He also visited troops from the Dominions, including Canada. For a time, he was attached to the staff of Sir Arthur Currie, commander of the Canadian Corps. Young, handsome and debonair, the prince was extremely popular.\n\nThe Royal Tour began in St. John’s, Newfoundland, then a separate Dominion from Canada. Prince Edward arrived on 12 August 1919 aboard the battle cruiser, HMS Renown, which was accompanied by the light cruiser HMS Dragon. After an enthusiastic welcome in St. John’s, he went by sea, first to Saint John, New Brunswick, then Halifax, Nova Scotia, and finally Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, before docking at Quebec City. It was here that he met the Royal Train that would be his home over the next two months, travelling close to 9,000 miles across the Dominion and back. The special CPR train consisted of two baggage cars, the Chinook (a sleeping car), the Canada (a sleeping car), the Carnaven (sic), a dining car, the Chester, the Chromarty, and the Killarney. Royal standards flew from the train’s engine.\n\nWherever the prince stopped, he was greeted with wild acclaim. This included his stops in Quebec. Decades before the Quiet Revolution, Quebeckers were staunchly pro-monarchy. From Quebec City, Prince Edward travelled to Toronto, where among other things, he attended the Canadian National Exhibition and was greeted by a crowd estimated at 350,000-400,000 strong. From Toronto, he travelled to Ottawa, arriving at the Central Station at 11:00am on Thursday, 28 August 1919. With his train running a bit early, there was an impromptu 30-minute stop at Manotick Station. There, the prince took a stroll through the countryside, stopping to talk to local farmers. He accepted a gift of some apples from a little girl.\n\nThe Ottawa Journal said that the prince’s arrival in the capital was met with the “wildest enthusiasm and happiness.” In just a few minutes, Prince Edward “had charmed Ottawa with his happy smile and pleasant manner.”\n\nThe city was elaborately decorated with flags and bunting. The Château Laurier Hotel was adorned with three electric signs, one saying “Welcome,” another “Bienvenue,” and the third portraying the three ostrich plume insignia of the Prince of Wales. The Rideau Club, located immediately across from Parliament Hill, bore a large electric sign of the prince’s crest. Union Jacks lined Wellington Street and covered the Langevin Block. Parliament Hill was also bedecked with flags and heraldic shields attached to white posts. The entrance way into the new Centre Block where the cornerstone of the new clocktower would shortly be laid by the prince was draped with dark blue and golden cloths. A canvas-roofed platform, erected at the top of the front steps, was covered with red, white and blue bunting, flags and garlands of cedars. The night before the prince’s arrival in Ottawa, searchlights played over the still unfinished Centre Block.\n\nImmediately prior to the prince’s arrival, streetcar service along Bank and Sussex Streets was suspended. Vehicular traffic was also banned from the processional route. However, before the streets were cleared, disaster almost struck when baskets of tomatoes fell off the back of a truck on Connaught Square leaving a squished red mess on the road. Fortunately, everything was cleaned up in time.\n\nAs the Royal Train pulled into the station, the first blast of a 21-gun salute rang out from Cartier Square. On the platform to greet the Prince of Wales were Sir Robert Borden and his Cabinet, Sir Arthur Currie, now the inspector general of Canada’s armed forces, Admirals Halsey and Kingsmill, and Mayor Harold Fisher. The first cheers came from a group of railway workers standing at the end of the platform. A group of newspapermen, forgetting that they were now civilians, snapped to attention with their hats in hand. The prince smiled, saluted them and then moved to inspect the guard of honour, stopping to talk to those with service ribbons. The band of the Governor General’s Foot Guards played the National Anthem.\n\nThe crowds in front of the train station surged when they got a glimpse of the prince dressed in the uniform of a colonel of the Welsh Guards. Cheering men and women rushed through the ropes and the mounted police to surround the royal carriage. Anxious officials reportedly relaxed when they saw the prince waiving, saluting and smiling. The Ottawa Journal said that “the very air seemed to pulse and tremble with terrific vibrations of sound” coming from the shouting, and cheering crowds.\n\nSlowly, the carriage made its way to Parliament Hill where 20,000 people were assembled. At the main gates, a guard of honour comprising of members of the Great War Veterans’ Association held the cheering hordes back. In command of the contingent was Lt.-Colonel R. de Salaberry, a descendent of the great Charles-Michel de Salaberry who defeated invading American troops in 1813 at the Battle of Châteauguay.\n\nAccompanied by Mayor Fisher, the prince walked up the steps to the platform erected in front of the new Centre Block. Lining those steps were men, wives, and mothers who lost sons and husbands in the war. At the top of the steps on the flag-bedecked podium, Sir Robert Borden, the Prime Minister, met the prince and officially welcomed him to Canada. After the customary speeches, the prince inspected 1,000 boy scouts and girl guides dressed in their full regalia, as well as members of the Army and Navy Veterans’ Association, including a number of ex-soldiers in wheelchairs.\n\nThat afternoon at 4:00pm, there was a garden party at Rideau Hall hosted by the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire. In ninety minutes, the prince shook hands with more than 2,000 guests. One was that of an elderly woman, Mrs Henry McLeod (née Murney), who had danced with his grandfather, then Prince of Wales and later King Edward VII, when he visited Ottawa in 1860 to lay the cornerstone of the old Centre Block that was destroyed by fire in 1916. The prince’s day ended with a dinner at the Country Club on the Aylmer Road.\n\nExhausted from days of nonstop “meeting and greeting”, the prince cancelled most of the events scheduled for the Friday and the following weekend, including a trip to view the construction on Parliament Hill, a visit to the Mint and a trip north to Lac Blue Sea in the Gatineau Hills. However, his “quiet” Friday still included an official luncheon at the Château Laurier hosted by Sir Robert Borden. Addressing guests, the prince talked about Canadian achievements during the Great War, both at the front and at home, underscoring the heroism of Canadian soldiers. He also thanked Canadian women, calling their achievements, both overseas and at home, “inestimable.” He mourned the loss of so many gallant men who died for King and Empire. He added that many Canadians had befriended him during the war, and now being finally in Canada he found himself “entirely at home.” “Although not born a Canadian, I have the mind and spirit of a Canadian and aim becoming more of a Canadian every day.” He said he looked upon Canada as a second home and asked for people to look at him “as a Canadian who belongs to the Dominion.”\n\nDirectly following the luncheon, he attended a huge reception at City Hall on Elgin Street, open to all as the prince wanted to meet the people who did “the dirty work” during the war. Ottawa residents began to line up two hours before the event to get their chance at meeting the Prince of Wales. At 3pm, attendees began to be ushered into the council chamber where there was a small podium erected. The prince, apologizing for only having two hands, personally greeted 2,500 people in 52 minutes—a rate of 45 persons per minute. Among those shaking his hand was Mrs Alice Woolley of 469 Parkdale who told Prince Edward that he should marry soon and raise more little princes like himself. (Advice he should have taken.) The prince also recognized and paused to chat with Sergeant Scoby, a one-armed veteran, who had served in France as a runner for Sir Arthur Currie.\n\nIn total, roughly 25,000 people attended the function. The prince signed the City Hall’s visitors’ book “29-8-19 Edward P.” The pen and blotting paper he used disappeared as mementos of the event.\n\nThe weekend passed quietly—sort of—with the prince playing 36 holes of golf at the Royal Ottawa Golf Club, with lunch at the Country Club on the Saturday and divine services at St. Bartholomew’s Church on the Sunday, followed by visits to Lady Borden and the recently widowed Lady Laurier. That night, the prince also paid an incognito visit to Parliament Hill to view the illuminations. He was accompanied by John Pearson, the architect of the new Centre Block.\n\nOn Monday, Labour Day, the Prince of Wales officially laid the cornerstone of the Victory Tower (later known as the Peace Tower) of the new Centre Block with the full pomp and pageantry expected of such an event. (The cornerstone to the building proper had been re-laid by his great uncle, the Duke of Connaught, in 1916 when work commenced on reconstructing the new Centre Block.) Inside the cornerstone was placed a parchment scroll outlining the history of the building, as well as a prayer thanking God for peace after the long devastating war, a list of attendees and the day’s program, a set of current Canadian coins, local newspapers and other memorabilia. On the outside of the cornerstone was the following inscription:\n\nBY EDWARD PRINCE OF WALES\n\nTHIS STONE WAS LAID\n\nSEPT. IST\n\nIN THIS YEAR OF VICTORY\n\nFINIS CORONAT OPVS\n\nThe inscription was written in the form of a chronogram with each underlined letter representing a Roman numeral which when added together made 1919. (The Latin inscription means “The end crowns the work.”)\n\nAfter the ceremony, Prince Edward visited Hull’s City Hall to deafening cheers, and participated in yet another reception, shaking hands with more than 500 people. He also stopped at the new club house of the Great War Veterans’ Association in the city.\n\nThe prince departed the Capital on the following day for Smiths Falls for a round of golf at the Dixie golf course before resuming his cross-country tour which was to take him to British Columbia and back.\n\nThe Prince of Wales made another five-day stop in Ottawa at the end of his Canadian tour. On 6 November 1919, he was back for a gala charity ball at the Château Laurier in support of the May Court Club. He, along with the governor general and his wife, arrived at the hotel at 10pm to be received by the president of the Club, Miss Sarah Sparks. Supper was held at the Tudor Room at midnight.\n\nThe next day, he conferred a knighthood—the Order of St. Michael and St. George—his first ever, on General Morrison at Rideau Hall. Morrison was the last Canadian to be gazetted to a knighthood following the Nickle Resolution over the granting of titles to Canadians. That night, the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire held a “small” dance for two hundred guests in the prince’s honour. He attended yet another dinner-dance at the Country Club on the Saturday after paying an informal visit to the G.W.V.A.’s Ottawa club house. Nursing sisters and members of the Volunteer Aid Detachment (V.A.D.) were also in attendance. There was no handshaking as the prince’s hand was virtually crippled from meeting so many people.\n\nOn Sunday, the prince’s last full day in Ottawa, he unveiled the magnificent memorial window, commissioned by the Duke and Duchess of Connaught in honour of Rideau Hall staff who died in the Great War. Afterwards, he walked to MacKay Presbyterian Church to unveil two memorial tablets—one to honour the nineteen members of the church who fell in the Great War and the second to commemorate all of the 140 congregation members who served in the conflict.\n\nThe next morning, the Prince of Wales boarded a special train for Washington D.C. to meet President Wilson followed by a stop in New York before heading home.\n\nPrince Edward was to make many further trips to Canada, both formal and informal—his avowed love of the country was not just diplomatic words. In 1919, he purchased the E.P. (Edward Prince) Ranch at High River in the Alberta foothills where he bred livestock imported from his farms in the Duchy of Cornwall. He owned the 100-acre ranch until 1962.\n\nThe much loved and admired Prince of Wales was to severely blot his copybook when he took up with the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson during the early1930s. On 11 December 1936, after only ten months on the throne, he abdicated as King Edward VIII so he could marry the woman he loved.\n\nSources:\n\nCanada’s Historic Places, 2024. E. P.

After months of political wrangling and name calling, ten urban municipalities and rural townships amalgamated with the old City of Ottawa to create a super City of Ottawa. Many likened the amalgamation to a shotgun wedding, forced upon unwilling communities by the Ontario provincial government. Gone were the cities of Nepean, Kanata and Gloucester, Cumberland, and Vanier, each with their distinct histories and characteristics. Gone was the affluent Village of Rockcliffe where Canada’s Governor General resides. Swept into the dustbin of history were the rural farming townships of Rideau, West Carleton, Goulbourn and Osgoode. Erased too was the old Regional Municipality of Ottawa that had hitherto co-ordinated regional services. The eleven regional and municipal governments were replaced by a single-level government. The population of the new Ottawa more than doubled from 327,000 to 775,000 people, while is geographic size increased more than twenty-fold from 110 to 2,778 square kilometres—equivalent to the combined size of Toronto, Montreal, Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver. Much of this land was countryside. Consequently, when entering Ottawa from the south, a visitor to the Capital will see stables and placid bovines instead of office buildings and harried civil servants.\n\nThe amalgamations and the accompanying angst were nothing new. Since it became a city in 1855, Ottawa has annexed many towns and villages that were once distinct as it grew from its original, downtown core. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it took over Mount Sherwood (located in the neighbourhood of Bronson Street and Gladstone Avenue), Rochesterville (where Rochester Street is today close to Dow’s Lake), the Village of New Edinburgh, Ottawa South, and Ottawa East. (Main Street, which is located in Ottawa East, was the main street of that community. This explains why Main Street, typically the principal thoroughfare in any town, is located in a comparatively out-of-the way place in modern Ottawa.) Other annexations included Hintonburg, Bayswater, and Orangeville.\n\nIn 1950, Ottawa annexed the Village of Britannia and large chucks of Nepean and Gloucester Townships. Losing 7,420 acres, Nepean became a rural township, stripped of urban Westboro, as well as Westboro Beach, and its beloved Nepean High School. It even lost its town hall then located on Richmond Road. Gloucester was also gutted, losing 14,000 acres, including Billings Bridge. Many protested. Legal suits followed, largely to no avail.\n\nWith the continued growth of Ottawa and the neighbouring communities, the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton was established in 1969 to help co-ordinate the delivery of region-wide services and development. Originally, regional councillors were appointed by the municipal councils with the regional chair elected in turn by the regional councillors. This changed during the early 1990s when the regional chair and the regional councillors begun to be elected directly by voters.\n\nThe switch to directly-elected regional councillors was the writing on the wall for the region’s future. In 1992, Graeme Kirby, the reform commissioner appointed by the NDP government of Bob Rae, had shied away from recommending regional amalgamation, having met very stiff opposition. However, he strengthened the authority of the regional government by recommending its direct election by the people. As well, the regional municipality took over the delivery of the bulk of municipal services including police, water, sewage, mass transit, garbage collection, arterial roads, and regional planning. Could full amalgamation be far behind?\n\nThe death blow came with the 1995 election in Ontario of the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris and its “Common Sense Revolution.” Faced with a record budget deficit, the new Ontario government was determined to cut municipal transfers by achieving efficiencies through the reduction the number of municipal governments in the province by roughly half from approximately 830 to about 400. The governments of cities, towns, and townships across the province were shocked. The infighting over who would survive began.\n\nHere in Ottawa, Peter Clark, the Regional Chair, favoured a strengthened regional government. Jacquelin Holtzman, the mayor of Ottawa, wanted a single, region-wide, municipal government. Meanwhile, most other area mayors advocated replacing the regional government by an unelected, cross-boundary service board that would be run by the eleven municipalities. All these positions seemed self-serving. Subsequently, views coalesced into two alternatives—a single big city solution and a three-city solution consisting of Ottawa, an eastern city centred on Gloucester and Cumberland, combined with other eastern townships, and a western city centred on Nepean and Kanata, combined with other western townships.\n\nA Compass poll of 500 persons undertaken in October 1999 concluded that a narrow majority of 52 per cent of respondents across the region favoured a single mega-city. However, most of these supporters lived in Ottawa where 61 per cent of residents polled preferred the one-city solution. In Nepean and Kanata, the single city option garnered only slightly more than a third of the votes. This was seen as a “win” by supporters of the single-city option as it could have been worse. However, Mary Pitt, Nepean’s mayor at the time, indicated that in the 1997 municipal elections, 84 per cent wanted an independent Nepean, but if amalgamation was to occur, three-quarters of Nepean residents supported the three-city solution.\n\nIn November 1999, Glen Shortliffe, a former clerk of the Privy Council, who had been appointed by Ontario government as special adviser on amalgamation reported that in his opinion “the case for one city [was] overwhelming.” He also rejected the creation of boroughs to represent neighbourhoods, arguing that a simple, uncluttered system was best. Neighbourhood issues could be dealt with by individual councillors. He also recommended the merger of the five municipal hydro companies. In recognition of the large Francophone minority in the region, the new city would be bilingual. He also recommended that a transition board be established to develop a new governance model and administration for Ottawa with a one-year mandate.\n\nThe provincial government of Mike Harris accepted Glen Shortliffe’s recommendation and passed a special City of Ottawa 1999 Act to implement them.\n\nThe Transition Board, headed by Claude Bennett, a former Progressive Conservative cabinet minister and former Chairman of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, consisted of seven people chosen by the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Premier Harris. The group became widely known as the “gang of seven.” Alex Munter, a regional councillor at the time, called the Transition Board “an undemocratic junta, appointed by Queen’s Park.”\n\nThe Board placed the cost of amalgamation at $189 million, of which the province would pay $142 million. The city would only have to pay the remaining $47 million. Of the $189 million in costs, $4 million was for transition board operations, $102 million was due to severance costs, and $83 million was allocated to investments in information technology. The Board also estimated the savings from amalgamation, in large part due to a reduction in personal of roughly 1,100 positions, would amount to $30.7 million in the first year, $55.7 million in 2002 and $84 million in 2003. Contrary to many hopes and expectations, the Board did not forecast any tax reductions owing to amalgamation.\n\nThe Board also identified the decision-making process and the roles and responsibilities of the new city council, set out the organizational structure of the new City of Ottawa, hired senior staff, developed a 2001 budget, and provided recommendations on city services and service levels. It furthermore made recommendations regarding staff levels, municipal utilities and public works. (See the Transition Board’s final report released in January 2001.) The Board also developed a new coat of arms for the new city. However, this was one recommendation that was later quickly rejected by the incoming City Council after amalgamation. Instead, Council voted to keep Ottawa’s historic coat of arms granted to the city in 1954 by letters patent of the King of Arms, the Duke of Norfolk. Critics of the proposed coat of arms called it “meaningless,” “sterile” and “an embarrassment,” and even a “heraldic abortion.”\n\nKicking and screaming, amalgamation took effect on 1 January 2001. In the lead-up to the big day, some municipalities took the opportunity to celebrate, or perhaps more accurately to hold a wake. Kanata reportedly spent $15,000 on renting the Corel Centre (now the Canadian Tire Centre) on New Year’ Eve as a venue for a series of performances. The afternoon show included singer and songwriter Jack Grunsky, followed by a battle of bands and acts playing cover songs of the Backstreet Boys, Ricky Martin, Britney Spears and others, with fireworks at 5:00pm. At 9:00pm that night, there was dancing and performances of the Legends of Rock n’ Roll, playing cover tunes of Patsy Cline, Buddy Holly, Mick Jagger, Elvis Presley, Tina Turner, the Village People, and more. Tickets costed $9 for the afternoon performance and $32 for the gala evening show.\n\nAfter amalgamation, the massive work on harmonizing eleven different sets of municipal by-laws, fees, and service levels began. Personnel, buildings, IT systems also had to be combined and rationalized. Duplicate street names had to be renamed to avoid postal confusion; you don’t want two Elm Streets in the same city. Sixteen years after amalgamation, at least 60 streets remained to be renamed, owing to the lengthy consultation process with stakeholders.\n\nWas amalgamation a success? It depends on who you talk too. Taxes were reduced in the 2001-2002 by ten per cent across the board. A 2010 article looking at the first ten years of amalgamation cited an unnamed city report saying that taxes of 80 per cent of homeowners in four of five rural municipalities—Goulbourn being the one exception—declined post amalgamation (Amalgamation Yes.)\n\nHowever, savings have been offset by the downloading of services from the province and investment costs associated with rehabilitating downtown Ottawa’s old infrastructure. A 2015 study by the Fraser Institute of eight Ontario amalgamations (Ottawa was unfortunately not included in the study) found that the intended benefits of greater efficiency, lower taxes and reduced bureaucracies did not materialize (Miljan and Spicer). A similar 2013 study of Toronto’s amalgamation concluded that gains from economies of scale were unlikely to be achieved by large city mergers, though there might be other benefits such as addressing externalities (Slack and Bird).\n\nThe urban-rural divide within Ottawa continues to be problematic. Urban issues, such as rapid transit and densification, are of major concern for urban voters, but not so much for rural voters, who resent paying for things they don’t use. While rural Ottawans may have better access to certain services post amalgamation, for example libraries, other services, such as city water and sewage service, count for little if you use a well and a cesspit. Rural residents also have resented increased regulation over land use and the loss of police services as policing resources are concentrated downtown where the bulk of crime occurs. On the other hand, urban councillors are outnumbered by rural and suburban councillors on city council. Sometimes, it may seem that the tail is wagging the dog.\n\nNot long after amalgamation, a rural, grassroots movement emerged with the aim to “de-amalgamate” the rural areas from greater Ottawa, and recreate the old Carleton County. Signs reading “Carleton County—Now” began sprouting on utility poles in rural parts of the city. However, as it became increasing clear that amalgamation was not to be reversed, combined with meetings to thrash out rural problems, this quixotic movement began to fade with the focus shifting toward working to improve governance and to find ways of ensuring that rural needs were not overlooked by the city.\n\nStill, many have looked back in regret. Ten years after amalgamation, Mary Pitt, the last mayor of Nepean, reportedly thought that amalgamation was a “big mistake,” as did the Marianne Wilkinson, the last mayor, and later councillor, for Kanata. Clive Doucet, a long-time former city councillor, has also been very critical of amalgamation. He argues that amalgamation, not just in Ottawa but across the province, killed the political voice of old communities leading to a lack of accountability. He cites the myriad problems associated with Ottawa’s light rail transit system as symptomatic of the problem. Urban sprawl and overdevelopment are worse than ever.\n\nAlmost a quarter century after amalgamation, the jury is still out. We can only hope that Ottawa can live up to its motto—”Advance-Ottawa-En Avant.”\n\nSources:\n\nAmalgamation Yes, 2010, “Ottawa Amalgamation 10 Year Anniversary,”2 January.\n\nDoucet, Clive, 20??, “What amalgamation did ,” Glebe Report.\n\nMijan, Lydia and Spicer Zachery, 2015. “Municipal Amalgamation In Ontario,” Fraser Institute.\n\nOldfield, Amy, 2023, “Stuck with the suburbs,” The Leveller, February.\n\nOttawa Citizen, 1947. “For Unified Control In Annexation Areas,” 7 August.\n\n——————, 1949. “Court Dismiss Appeal In Issue of Annexation,” 25 February.\n\n——————, 1950. “Will Ottawa Be Short Changed?”, 7 January.\n\n——————, 1995. “Harris says region over-governed,” 28 November.\n\n——————, 1995. “Tory cuts offer a challenge to Ontarians,” 30 November.\n\n——————, 1996. “Holtzman promotes vision of one-tier government,” 19 January.\n\n——————, 1996. “Selective municipal mergers wasteful if one-tier is the real goal,” 2 May.\n\n——————, 1996. “The city fixer almost no one wants,” 18 December.\n\n——————, 1996. “Rural areas have valid concerns about regional police takeover,” 11 June.\n\n——————, 1997. “Merger Mania,” 9 January.\n\n——————, 1999. “We want one city, residents tell pollster,” 9 October.\n\n——————, 1999. “Day 2: Urban versus rural,” 14 October.\n\n——————, 1999. “Shoreliffe sees end to political division,” 27 November.\n\n——————, 2000. “One city, one hydro, board says,” 14 March.\n\n——————, 2000. “A worthy city’s worthy coat of arms,” 29 May.\n\n——————, 2000. “Board unveils coat of arms for new city,” 8 November.\n\n——————, 2000. “New city coat of arms is sterile, meaningless,” 15 November.\n\n——————, 2000. “Denying the past,” 20 December.\n\n——————, 2000.

The best known is the razing of LeBreton Flats during the late 1960s, only for government to leave the former neighbourhood fallow for decades. Great swathes of Lowertown were also torn down in the name of urban renewal. Previously, historic Upper Town disappeared under the wrecking ball to be replaced by the Supreme Court and other government buildings. The government expropriated the Russell Theatre and Russell Hotel in 1928 to make Confederation Square. Ten years later, it levelled the old Post Office and the old Knox Presbyterian Church to make room for the War Memorial and to widen Elgin Street. (Prime Minister Mackenzie King, a staunch Presbyterian, apologized to church members for the Church’s destruction.) The former Supreme Court building on the side of Parliament Hill was knocked down in 1956 to build a parking lot. Most recently, the Daly Building was demolished in 1991 after years of neglect. As well, many of today’s cherished historic buildings, including the West Block on Parliament Hill, Union Station, Elgin Chambers at the corner of Sparks and Elgin Streets, and the Museum of Nature, were once slated for destruction but were spared only by the vagaries of government planning or pinched government budgets.\n\nThe Roxborough Apartments was another NCC victim.\n\nConstruction of what was to become Ottawa’s largest and most desirable apartment building began in the spring of 1909 on northern side of Laurier Avenue close to Elgin Street. It was owned and built by Imperial Realty of Ottawa. Mr. H.C. Stone of Montreal was its architect.\n\nNo expense was spared in the Roxborough’s construction. Its basement sat on a steel reinforced concrete slab three feet thick. The frame of the fireproof, eight-storey building contained more than 600 tons of steel. Its external walls were made of brick and stone, with stone being used on the first two storeys and brick with stone trim on the upper six stories. Interior walls were soundproofed.\n\nThere were eighty suites, ten per floor. There were “bachelor” suites consisted of two or three rooms. These suites did not contain kitchens. (Apparently, bachelors were incapable of cooking for themselves so kitchens were unnecessary.) The larger “light-housekeeping” apartments were suitable for families. These suites were equipped with a kitchen, a butler’s panty, and servants’ quarters. Parlours and dining rooms had fireplaces.\n\nThe apartment building was designed as a figure eight, permitting all rooms to have windows; there were no interior rooms. An elevator ran through the waist of the building. On the ground floor was a dining room for tenants, a marble vestibule, a lobby, furnished with comfortable chairs, tables and carpets, and an adjoining waiting cum writing room. Tenants could enjoy the views from the building’s roof garden. In the basement was the caretaker’s suite, a large kitchen and laundry, the latter fitted out with the most modern drying facilities. There was also a mail chute for the convenience of tenants.\n\nThe interior woodwork, including floors, was made from top quality red oak, sourced from the New Edinburgh Mills of W.C. Edwards. Each apartment door was made from a single panel of five-ply red oak. Interior halls were also panelled in red oak, and ornamented by pilasters decorated with hand carved capitals.\n\nApart from the first-rate physical environment, what distinguished the Roxborough Apartments from other apartment building of the time was its amenities. Its apartments featured all of the most modern and practical conveniences of the age. In addition to maid service, the Roxborough had top-of-the line plumbing, heating and ventilation systems. A water filtration plant ensured the cleanliness of water delivered to tenants. (This was a considerable health and safety feature as municipal water, which was drawn from the Ottawa River, was not chlorinated at this time. Each year many fell ill or even died from water-borne diseases.) Hot-water radiators provided heating to the apartments, their temperature settings under the control of the tenants. The building had its own telephone exchange provided by Bell Telephone. As well, kitchens were equipped with refrigerators, linked to a central refrigeration plant constructed on its own foundation to eliminate potential vibrations. (This was years before the home electric fridge became available. At this time, most people, if they had anything, made do with ice boxes, with ice delivered weekly by the iceman.) Each apartment also came equipped with a central vacuum cleaning system. Residents ate breakfast in “The Palm” dining room on the ground floor, or they could order meals delivered to their suites.\n\nThe Roxborough opened its doors on 1 May 1910. Its eighty apartments were quickly leased to Ottawa’s great and good—prime ministers, cabinet ministers, senators, MPs, judges, diplomats, etc. It was the place to live, just a short walk from Parliament Hill.\n\nOne famous tenant was William Lyon Makenzie King, who had an apartment from 1910 until January 1923 when as prime minister he moved to Laurier House which he had recently inherited from Lady Laurier, the widow of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. In his diary dated Wednesday, 10 January 1923, Mackenzie King wrote: “I am spending my last night in the rooms at Roxborough in which I have lived since 1909 [sic]. Their associations are very sacred to me and I feel as if I was parting with something akin to a very dear friend. I love the quiet and comfortable atmosphere; the notes of beauty and refinement are all a part of what is most dear to me.”\n\nKing was not the only prime minister to call the Roxborough Apartments home. Sir Arthur Meighen lived there as did Louis St. Laurent, before he moved into 24 Sussex Drive in 1951, following the home’s purchase and renovation as the official residence of Canada’s prime minister. John Bracken and George Drew, Conservative leaders of the Opposition also resided at the Roxborough. Lady Byng, the widow of Lord Byng, Canada’s governor general from 1921 to 1926, lived there through World War II, persuaded by her Canadian friends to weather the conflict from the safety of Ottawa. Governor General Georges Vanier was also a Roxborough resident before moving to Rideau Hall.\n\nLife at the Roxborough went on serenely until January 1965 when the NCC expropriated the property to make way for a proposed $20 million Museum of Human and Natural History to replace the Canadian Museum of Man and Nature (now known as the Canadian Museum of Nature) located on McLeod Street. Residents and heritage advocates were outraged, especially as the site of the Roxborough was not needed to construct the museum, but rather was to be used for landscaping.\n\nH.W. Herridge, the MP for Kootenay West, presented a petition to the House of Commons on behalf of the Roxborough’s staff and residents, excluding residents Finance Minister Walter Gordon and John Nicholson, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, who weren’t asked to sign the petition to avoid embarrassing them. Petitioners cited the historic nature of the building, and proposed that it be used as a residence for official government guests, a Canadian version of Blair House in Washington D.C. One of leaders of the resident group fighting the destruction of the Roxborough was Mrs. Adolphe Caron, the widow of the clerk of the Senate and the daughter in law of the late Sir Adolphe-Philippe Caron, Minister of Defence and Militia in the government of Sir John A. Macdonald. Mrs. Caron, then almost 90 years of age, had been a resident of the apartment building since 1913. She recalled seeing Mackenzie King pushing his mother in a wheelchair through the Roxborough’s hallways.\n\nDespite the high-power pressure, the petition failed. The NCC formally bought the building for $1,450,000.\n\nFor a short time, it looked like the Roxborough was going to be reprieved owning to a freeze on government construction as an anti-inflation measure announced in June 1965. However, two months later, Public Works Minister George McIlriath ended such hopes, saying that all tenants must clear out of the building by 30 September 1965. According to once secret Cabinet documents, the decision to proceed with demolition was due to the site being needed by the contractor building the nearby National Arts Centre.\n\nIt wasn’t only Roxborough’s residents who had to vacate. The order also applied to La Touraine, arguably Ottawa’s top restaurant at that time, that operated out of the former tenants’-only restaurant on the ground floor. La Touraine had an international reputation, hosting and catering to innumerable weddings, and diplomatic events, feeding such luminaries as HM Queen Elizabeth II, HRH Princess Margaret, Winston Churchill and General Charles de Gaulle. In the last five years of existence, it had served close to a quarter million meals. So popular was La Touraine that the Danish Embassy in Washington would ask it to cater dinner parties.\n\nOn the night of 30 September, La Touraine hosted a farewell dinner for two hundred patrons. Flowers and candles decorated each table. Head chef Hlinovski served shrimp cocktail, consommé with sherry, baked beef tenderloin with Burgundy wine sauce, potatoes, broccoli in Hollandaise sauce, coffee, Baked Alaska, and chocolates. At the stroke of midnight, a kilted Highland Cameron bagpiper paraded through the restaurant playing the piper’s lament.\n\nThe last tenant to leave the Roxborough Apartments was the Venezuelan Embassy early on 1 October, a few hours after the NCC deadline.\n\nTwo weeks later, all the fittings and furnishings in the building and restaurant were sold off to the highest bidder in a multi-day auction. Thousands flocked to the Roxborough to buy a piece of history. One of the most expensive items to be sold was the carpet in La Touraine, complete with the restaurant’s crest woven into the design. It went for $2,000. Even the mail box, the swinging bar doors, and the iron gates and lamp standards that stood at the front door were sold. The big red oak apartment doors were cut into two by fours that sold for 25 cents each.\n\nBut this wasn’t quite the end of the Roxborough. Tearing it down proved to be challenging and deadly. Being so close to the sidewalk, the city wouldn’t allow the wrecking company, Eastern Demolishers, to use a wrecking ball to demolish the stone, brick and steel structure. It had to be done by hand. Eastern Demolishers got in repeated trouble for safety violations. But even with safety inspectors frequently on site, Maurice Cardinel, a brother of the company’s owner and father of six, fell six floors to his death in a tragic accident in April 1966. At the subsequent inquest, a Crown attorney said that the method of demolition breached every conceived safety regulation. The jury concluded, however, that a lack of communication between the three levels of government—federal, provincial and municipal—contributed to Cardinel’s death.\n\nWith the building levelled, the site of the Roxborough Apartments was turned into a temporary parking lot. In February 1967, Public Works Minister McIlraith indicated his concern about a loss of green space in the area and thought that the new Museum of Human and Natural History might go elsewhere. In the end, it was never built.\n\nThe site of the Roxborough Apartments became part of Confederation Park in 1969.\n\nSources:\n\nGovernment of Canada, Cabinet conclusions, 1965. “Demolition of Roxborough Apartments,” RG2, Privy Council Office, Series A-5-a Volume 6271, Access Code 90, date 1965-08-04.\n\nElliott, Andrew, 2022. “History Lost: The Roxy Apt’s,” Blacklock’s Reporter, 7 August.\n\nMackenzie King, William Lyon, 1923.

Pauline Johnson, with the “E” standing for Emily. Born on 10 March 1861 at “Chiefswood” on the Six Nations Indian Reserve near Brantford, Upper Canada (Ontario), her father was Chief George H.M. Johnson also known as Onwanonsyshon, who was an interpreter for the Anglican Church as well as Crown interpreter for the Six Nations (the Seneca, the Cayuga, the Onondaga, the Oneida, the Mohawk, and the Tuscarora). Her grandfather was John “Smoke” Johnson (Sakayengwaraton) who fought for the British along side Joseph Brant (Theyendanegea) during the War of 1812 and was a pine tree (elected) chief of the Iroquois. John and George Johnson and another Iroquois chief made Prince Arthur, the youngest son of Queen Victoria, an honorary chief of the Six Nations in 1869. Prince Arthur, better known as the Duke of Connaught, was Canada’s Governor General from 1911 to 1916.\n\nPauline Johnson’s mother, Emily Susanna Howells, was born in Bristol, England. She had emigrated with her parents to the United States as a child and met her future husband while visiting her sister in Brantford. Her mother, who was much interested in the literary arts, was a significant influence on young Pauline. The other major influence was her paternal grandfather, Chief John Smoke Johnson. Proficient in the Mohawk language, Pauline learnt at his knee the stories of his youth and the legends of the Six Nations that were to form the basis of many of her poems.\n\nPauline Johnson first came to literary prominence during the early 1880s when various US and Canadian literary magazines began to publish her poems. One such American magazine was Gems of Poetry which published her poem The Rift under her nom de plume, Margaret Rox. The poem speaks of grief, loss and hardship. It first verse reads:\n\nNature has wept today, her pent-up grief,\n\nIn tears still trembles on the lily bell,\n\nRemorseless raindrops fleck its bending leaf,\n\nAnd crystallize its yellow coronal.\n\nBut Pauline Johnson really broke into the public consciousness in the early 1890s, overcoming the daunting hurdles of being both a woman and part Indigenous. According to Ottawa author Charlotte Gray, who wrote a biography of Pauline Johnson, her breakout moment occurred in January 1892 when she performed at the Toronto Art School Gallery at the invitation of the Young Men’s Liberal Association. In front of a packed house of literary luminaries, she moved the audience with the reciting of A Cry of an Indian Wife which tells the story of a First Nation warrior going off to fight the Canadian militia in the North-West Rebellion, otherwise known today as the North-West Resistance. In the poem, Johnson writes:\n\nThey but forget we Indians owned the land\n\nFrom ocean to ocean; they stand\n\nUpon a soil that centuries agone\n\nWas our sole kingdom and our right alone.\n\nThey never think how they would feel to-day,\n\nIf some great nation came from far away,\n\nWrestling their country from their hapless braves,\n\nGiving what they gave us–but wars and graves.\n\nHer poems touched a cord within the hearts of her audience. Never before had people heard someone, let alone a young mixed-race woman, speak so eloquently of the conflict, so fresh in people’s memories, from an Indigenous point of view. The Globe newspaper opined that “we are apt to feel our sorrows [for friends and relatives who died] tinged with a shade of remorse.” It added: “we wounded hearts as sensitive as our own, and brought sorrow to many a family circle held together by ties as strong and true in their domestic affections that dwell in our happiest homes.”\n\nFrom that point on, the beautiful and exotic Pauline Johnson was a star. A great performer, she became an eloquent advocate for First Nations. She went on repeated tours throughout Canada, United States and England giving recitals. For parts of her performances, she dressed in native-style attire of her own fashioning, complete with doeskin tunic, fringes, beads, silver brooches, wampum belts and even the scalp of a Huron enemy warrior. (This costume has been preserved at the Museum of Vancouver.) Around her neck was a necklace of bear claws.\n\nThis was not traditional Mohawk dress by any stretch, but one designed specifically to impress and allure a white audience. The bear claw necklace was reportedly the gift of Horace Martin of Montreal, at the time the well-known author of Castorologica, a book on the Canadian beaver. Charlotte Gray described Johnson’s garb as an “entirely synthetic creation” that was inspired by the then-popular Buffalo Bill Wild West Show. For other parts of her performances, she dressed in the usual clothes of a late Victorian woman.\n\nPauline Johnson’s first performance in Ottawa took place on 2 November 1892 at St. John’s Hall with the patronage of Lord Stanley, the Governor General, and Lady Stanley. The hall was crowded to hear “the Indian maiden.” The vice-regal couple sat in comfortable easy chairs placed on bearskin rugs. For the first part of her performance, Johnson was attired in an evening dress made of cream Henrietta cloth (twilled fabric with a silk warp) with an orange girdle and a white, fluffy boa. She recited A Red Girl’s Reasoning, a newly published short story of a mixed-race daughter of a Hudson’s Bay agent marrying a white man. The young man is aghast when he finds out that his bride’s parents were married by Indian rites instead of by a clergyman. His wife defends Indigenous traditions saying: “Priest? Law? My people have no priest and my nation cringes not to law, our priest is purity and our law is honour.”\n\nLater, wearing her deerskin costume, her shoulders wrapped in a red Hudson’s Bay blanket, she recounted A Cry of an Indian Wife. She also recited the tale of an Indigenous girl who got lost in a storm hunting for her white lover.\n\nChanging into boating gear, Johnson read her famous poem The Song My Paddle Sings.\n\nI stow the sail, unship the mast:\n\nI wooed you long but my wooing’s past;\n\nMy paddle will lull you into rest.\n\nO! drowsy wind of the drowsy west,\n\nSleep, sleep,\n\nBy your mountain steep,\n\nOr down where the prairie grasses sweep!\n\nNow fold in slumber your laggard wings,\n\nFor soft is the song my paddle sings.\n\nBut for the audience that night, the pièce de résistance was her retelling her poem A Red Man Dies, the poignant story of a Iroquois warrior captured by the Hurons and given a choice of either sitting with the old women or walking to his death on a bed of fiery coals. The Iroquois warrior chooses death.\n\n“Wilt thou walk o’er the bed of fire that waits thee now–\n\nWalk with uncovered feet upon the coals,\n\nUntil thou reach the ghostly Land of Souls,\n\nAnd, with thy Mohawk death-song please our ear?\n\nOr wilt thou with the women rest thee here?”\n\nHis eyes flash like an eagle’s, and his hands\n\nClench at the insult. Like a god he stands.\n\n“Prepare the fire!” he scornfully demands.\n\nJohnson’s performance was met with wild applause. The vice-regal party, also rivetted by what they heard, unusually stayed for the entire event.\n\nTekahionwake retuned many times to the Ottawa area over the next twenty years, playing at the Opera House or in crowded church halls. In 1895, she published her first book of poetry, The White Wampum, a slim volume of only 36 poems. Two more volumes were to follow; Canadian Born in 1903 and Flint and Feathers in 1912. She also published in 1911 Legends of Vancouver; a collection of stories told to her by a Squamish chief. Two other collections of short stores were published posthumously, The Moccasin Maker and Shagganappi.\n\nHer work was well received, especially the stories and legends related to Indigenous life. She became the voice of native peoples, something unique at the time. However, in her obituary, the Ottawa Journal thought that in an attempt to become the voice of Canada in her second volume, Canadian Born, she had lost her way, essentially selling out. She had become, “a negation of her own race drowning in the white element.” The newspaper opined that she should have stayed on the reserve writing poems about native life rather than touring and attempting to become cosmopolitan.\n\nThis was a harsh assessment. Performing was the way she made her living. Moreover, Pauline Johnson straddled two realities, both Indigenous and settler, and was trying to bridge the gap. Indeed, according to Charlotte Gray, she was trying to weld them together to form a stronger Canadian society—a quixotic goal given the growing suppression of Indigenous rites and ceremonies and cultural assimilation through the residential school system by the Canadian government. Still, Canadian Born was an expression of her pride in both her Anglo-Canadian and Indigenous roots. The first verse read:\n\nWe first saw light in Canada, the land beloved of God,\n\nWe are the pulse of Canada, its marrow and its blood\n\nAnd we the men of Canada can face the world and brag\n\nThat they were born in Canada beneath the British flag.\n\nThe last verse of the poem also displayed an anti-American sentiment that rejected the significant annexationist element that existed within late nineteenth century Canadian society. It still resonates today in the Canadian psyche. It might also have reflected the fact that Indigenous peoples were being being treated far worst in the United States than in Canada. South of the border, First Nations peoples were widely considered as vermin, and treated as such.\n\nThe Dutch may have their Holland, the Spaniard have his Spain,\n\nThe Yankee to the south of us must south of us remain;\n\nFor not a man dare lift a hand against the men who brag\n\nThat they were born in Canada beneath the British flag.\n\nPauline Johnson, Tekahionwake, died in Vancouver on 7 March 1913 of breast cancer. She was only 52 years of age. A week before she died, the Duke of Connaught, who was touring the west coast, came to pay his respects. Her ashes were buried in Stanley Park in Vancouver.\n\nOver the following century and more, Johnson’s popularity has waxed and waned in popularity. For some, she relied on romantic tropes, such as “the Indian princess,” to sell her recitals to settler audiences. For these critics, she was as fake as the contrived costume in which she performed. They downplay her contribution to Canadian literature relative to the likes of Canada’s Confederation poets—Charles Roberts, Bliss Carmen, Archibald Lampman and Duncan Campbell Scott. Reportedly, Robertson Davies and Mordecai Richler called her work “schlock.” However, Johnson overcame rampant prejudice to demonstrate to a largely ignorant settler audience the richness and depth of Indigenous legends and life, and gave voice to Indigenous grievances that remain unresolved to this very day.\n\nE. Pauline Johnson was short-listed to appear on Canada’s ten-dollar bill, losing out in 2018 to Viola Desmond, the black woman who challenged racial segregation in Nova Scotia in 1946.\n\nNote: A short essay like this can hardly do justice to the life of such an extraordinary and complex person. To learn more about Pauline Johnson, I would encourage you to read Charlotte Gray’s excellent biography of this remarkable Canadian whose work still has relevance and meaning today.\n\nSources:\n\nBrantford Daily Expositor, 1884. “The Rift by Margaret Rox,” 31 October.\n\nBuffalo Courier Express, 1898. “Poet of the Mohawks,” 27 March.\n\nDaily Herald, 1913. “Notes of the Day,” 1 April.\n\nDaily Mirror, 1906. “From Wigwam To Concert Platform,” 4 July.\n\nDerby Daily Telegraph, 1894. “Our London Letter,” 26 May.\n\nGazette, 1887. “Ephemerides,” 5 February.\n\nGlobe, 1892. “Impressions,” 18 January.\n\n——–, 1892. “Music And The Drama,” 19 February.\n\n——-, 1892. “Music And The Drama,” 12 March.\n\nGray, Charlotte. 2002.

Think of Johnny Wayne and Frank Shuster, Leslie Nielson, John Candy, Dan Aykroyd, Catherine O’Hara, Norm Macdonald, Andrea Martin, Rick Moranis, Mike Myers, Martin Short, and Jim Carey to mention just a few.\n\nOne possible reason for this phenomenon is the relative size of the “creative economy” in Canada compared to that in the United States. A 2016 British study by Nesta (National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts) found that in 2011 Canada’s creative economy accounted for 12.90% of Canadian employment, compared to 9.75% in the United States and 8.76% in the United Kingdom. Others have speculated that Canadian comedians owe their success in the United States by spending years honing their craft outside of Hollywood, developing their own unique comedic styles before trying their luck down south. Many earned their chops on SCTV in Toronto. Still others have suggested that Canadians know their American neighbours but at the same time have an outsider perspective that allows for observational humour, impressions, and parody that appeal to Americans.\n\nOne comedian who excelled at an early age in impersonations is Rich Little. Little was born in Ottawa on 26 November 1938, the second of three sons of the eminent physician, athlete and boy scout leader Dr. Lawrence “Bones” Little and his wife Elizabeth. The family lived at 114 The Driveway. From a very early age, young Rich was doing impressions for his mates in the St John’s 57th Wolf Cub Pack and at school. At Lisgar Collegiate he did impressions of his teachers, often answering questions in class in their voices. (That must have gone over well!)\n\nAs a teenager, he joined up with Geoff Scott of Glebe High School to do comic impersonations at schools and other local events. In late August 1955, young Rich, age sixteen, and Geoff, age seventeen, travelled to Toronto to see Ed Sullivan who had flown in from New York City to host the Canadian National Exhibition and introduce Marilyn Bell who had swum across Lake Ontario in 1954 and who had just swum across the English Channel. Sullivan was also in Toronto to scout out new talent for his show. Somehow, the boys managed to speak to Sullivan and even get their photograph taken with him. The duo also did some impersonations for the variety show host. Little reported that Sullivan’s poker face broke into a smile saying “Boys, you have some great imitations there. But you lack audience experience. Come back in two years.” Little said that meeting Sullivan was the “thrill of [his] life.”\n\nLittle and Scott took Sullivan’s advice to heart and began to perform wherever they could. In November 1955, Little provided entertainment at a parish dinner of the St. George’s Anglican Church. The following year, the duo performed at such events as a picnic for the handicapped in Aylmer, an open house at Connelly Motors in Westboro, and a springtime party for the Ottawa Philharmonic. In addition, they were introduced to radio listeners to Ottawa when Gord Atkinson of radio station CFRA asked them to perform on his show.\n\nLittle and Scott got their first big break in February 1956 when they were invited to be one of the acts on the CBC television show Pick the Stars in which a panel of celebrities judged up-and-coming entertainers for cash prizes. The show was hosted by Dick MacDougal. With Little doing great Dick MacDougal and Ed Sullivan impressions, the duo came in tied for first place despite their “nervousness that made them look a shade amateurish,” according to the Ottawa Journal. However, the reporter added that Little and Scott were “a good deal funnier” than Joey Bishop who the CBC had hired at a cost of $2,500 to make a guest appearance on the Denny Vaughan Show, a musical variety series. Prophetically, the newspaper said that Little and Scott had the ability to become great comics should they choose a career in show business. Their appearance on Pick the Stars led to a call to perform from the Gatineau Country Club, the premiere night club in the Ottawa area. However, Little’s parents put their foot down with a firm “no!” After all, Rich was only 17 years old. However, the duo got more gigs on CBC television, including an appearance on the Jackie Rae Show in April 1956 where Little introduced his Charlotte Whitton (Ottawa’s mayor) impression to a national television audience.\n\nAs well as doing impersonations, Little got in as much radio and acting experience as he could. While still at school, he worked at CFRA during summer vacations doing everything, including a woman’s show called Helpful Hints for the Homemaker which apparently included one helpful hint for bald men: “Pour sour cream over the scalp twice daily; rub vigorously.” Little also performed in countless plays at the Ottawa Little Theatre and Ottawa’s Children’s Theatre. In a 1955 production of The Tinder Box by Hans Christian Anderson, Little was “third dog.” He was later the “sandwich man” in Pinocchio. In 1958, he played summer stock in North Hantley, Quebec in which he did the lighting, staging and sound, in addition to acting. Also that year, he won best actor in the Eastern Ontario Drama Festival for his role as “Bo Decker” in the play Bus Stop. By the early 1960s, he was doing two or three plays annually, with the view of eventually making the stage his career, with his sights set on Broadway.\n\nWhile Rich Little and Geoff Scott performed frequently together during the late 1950s and early 1960s, they eventually went their own ways. Following his graduation from Glebe High School in 1957, Scott became a staff reporter at the Ottawa Journal. Two years later after leaving Carleton University, he joined CHCH-TV in Hamilton, where he became the face of the station. In 1978, he entered a new profession as a federal MP representing the riding of Hamilton Wentworth for the Progressive Conservative Party, a job he held until 1993. He died in 2021.\n\nAs for Little, after his graduation from Lisgar Collegiate, he took a job at the Smiths Falls radio station CJET where he had two shows daily, doing take-offs of popular television programs. One episode featured a Zorro take-off called “The Stroke of Burro,” in which “Peter Lore” played the burro. It also featured “Jimmy Cagney” and “Charlotte Whitton.” In 1961, he had his own show on CBOT, CBC’s Ottawa station, called Folderol—a half-hour program of light humour and interviews that aired at 6:00pm. The show also starred the Ottawa folk singer Tom Kines, and Jim Terrell who handled “helpful hints for the handyman.” He also formed a partnership with Joe Potts called Little-Potts Productions, selling commercials, station breaks and impersonations to radio and television stations. As well, he continued to hone his stage impersonations at Le Hibou, Ottawa’s renowned coffee shop, and the Gatineau Country Club where he was now old enough to go. Among his impressions were President Kennedy, Prime Minister Diefenbaker, “Mike” Pearson, and Charlotte Whitton.\n\nSo good was his Whitton impersonation that in an Ottawa Journal article Little said that he frightened Lloyd Francis, one of Whitton’s “punching bags” on city council. It seems that while Little was driving down Elgin Street one Sunday, he pulled up alongside Francis who was in a car in the lane beside him looking at the construction of the Queensway overpass. Francis, who was oblivious to Little’s presence, almost jumped out of his skin when Charlotte Whitton’s voice shouted at him “Why don’t you look where you’re going, you stupid oaf!”\n\nThrough 1962 and 1963, as his popularity rose, Rich Little began appearing on many Canadian radio and television programs, including the Tommy Ambrose Show, and the Pierre Burton’s Show, television specials such as Little’s take on Charles Dickins’ Christmas Carol on CRFA, and a CBC show called Six for Christmas, as well as hosting a regular three-hour CRFA show, six days a week. He also released with Les Lye and Elsa Pickthorne his first album called My Fellow Canadians that spoofed well-known Canadian personalities. The record was a huge success. Mike Pearson, the leader of the Liberal Party, was a good sport about Little’s imitation of him, accepting an autographed copy of the album from Little. However, Prime Minister Diefenbaker and his wife Olive were not amused, advising the record company that neither were interested in receiving a copy.\n\nExpecting to premiere excerpts from the record on the Tommy Ambrose Show in late February 1963, it ran afoul of the spring 1963 federal election. While Little’s impersonations were reportedly neither particularly political or controversial, CBC cancelled the program owing to “the troubled political scene and election campaign.” Public reaction to the news was swift; if anything, it boosted Little’s profile and popularity. A St John NB radio station declared a “Rich Little Day,” playing excerpts from the album and other Little material through the day.\n\nA second album called Scrooge and the Stars, was released in mid-November 1963. It featured the voices of popular American entertainers, including “Jack Benny” as Scrooge and “Ed Sullivan” as the Ghost of Christmas to Come. “President Kennedy” featured as the Ghost of Christmas Present. Just a few days after the album’s release, tragedy intruded into the mirth. President Kennedy was assassinated.\n\nRich Little’s work on CBC and his records brought him recognition in the United States. He reportedly auditioned for The Jimmy Dean Show in 1963, thanks at least in part to two Canadian writers for the show, Frank Peppiatt and John Aylesworth. But it was no avail. He also auditioned for NBC’s Tonight Show. In an interview, Little recalled that the producer said, “Okay, you’re Rich Little from some place on the Arctic Circle. Make me laugh.” He didn’t get a guest spot, the producer apparently underwhelmed by Little’s sketch about Jack Benny’s birthday party attended by Fred MacMurray, George Burns, Rochester, Alfred Hitchcock and other US celebrities.\n\n1964 was Rich Little’s breakout year in the United States. After coming off of an appearance on the Juliette Show in Toronto in early January, he went to Hollywood to audition for the Judy Garland Show. Again, the opportunity to audition came from John Aylesworth who had seen his try-out with The Jimmy Dean Show and was now a writer for Judy Garland. He had also been greatly impressed by Little’s two comedic albums. Rich Little appeared on 26 January 1964, along with Martha Raye and Peter Lawford. (Rich Little on Judy Garland Show.) Unfortunately, Little’s family and friends probably didn’t see the show when it aired on CBS, unless they had a special aerial to pick up the signal from Watertown, New York. Cable television was not yet available in Ottawa.\n\nFrom that point on, there was no looking back. Rich Little was now a bone fide star. For the next twenty years or so, he was on the top of his game, appearing on sit-coms, variety shows, including the Dean Martin Show, The Ed Sullivan Show, The Jimmy Dean Show, The Kopycats and The Julie Andrew’s Show. (Here is a 1967 CBC interview with Rich Little: CBC interview.) During the 1970s, he was a regular on the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts, and became famous for his impression of President Richard Nixon. As well, for a time he was a regular on The Johnny Carson Show.\n\nWhen his television career went into decline, Rich Little took on the nightclub scene in Las Vegas. In 2024, at 85 years of age, he continues to perform at the Tropicana.\n\nRich Little was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2022.\n\nSources:\n\nCBC News, 2018. “Rich Little looks back on his time at Lisgar,” 4 May.\n\nGlobe and Mari, 1955. “At the CNE: Swimmers Flashback for Sullivan,” 25 August.\n\nHistory of Canadian Broadcasting, 2024, Rich Little (1938-).\n\nNesta, 2016.

Campbell of 193 Gloucester Street, was organizing an Ottawa company of boy scouts. Campbell had recently returned from Britain where he had been the scout master of the 1st Whitehead troop and the Secretary of the North Irish Division Council of boy scouts. Reportedly, he had been trained under the “eye” of General Baden-Powell. Boys aged between 12 and 18 interested in joining the scouts were urged to contact Mr. Campbell at his home address.\n\nThe boy scouts were a new youth organization at the time. Its founder, General Robert Stephenson Baden-Powell, had launched the movement just two years earlier in Britain. Baden-Powell was British officer and former military scout in several colonial wars in South Africa in the late 19th century. In 1900, he became famous as the “Hero of Mafeking” during the Second Boer War. Then a colonel, Baden-Powell had commanded the town’s garriso"
