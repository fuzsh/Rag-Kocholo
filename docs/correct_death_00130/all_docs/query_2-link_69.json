        "text": "The residence was built in 1868. Its first three owners comprised of successful businessmen and members of Parliament. Since its inception, it has welcomed the political elite of Canada. The residence was later purchased by the federal government and refurbished as an official residence for the prime minister in 1950.\n\nTraditionally, part of the house has been reserved for the use of the Prime Minister’s family. The other part is where the prime minister welcomes official guests for public functions. These rooms are adorned and furnished in a manner suitable to the important public functions they play. The residence is designated as a “classified” heritage building by the Federal Heritage Buildings Review Office (FHBRO).\n\nPlace of peace\n\nIn the early 19th century, Canada was a magnet for young, ambitious immigrants. One of them was Joseph Merrill Currier from Vermont. He came to Ottawa in 1837 at age 17, and stayed to make a fortune in the lumber trade. In 1868, as a wedding gift to his third wife, Hannah, he constructed a house near the forests and water that had made his fortune. He called the house Gorffwysfa, which means “place of peace” in Welsh.\n\nPolitics and business\n\nAfter the death of Hannah Currier in 1901, the house passed into the hands of William Cameron Edwards, a member of another prominent lumbering family. Like the first owner, Edwards was both a successful businessman and a prominent politician. From 1893 on, his company owned all the mills east of Rideau Falls, eventually turning them into an important wood-manufacturing complex. Edwards also served as a member of Parliament from 1891 to 1900, after which he was appointed senator. When Edwards died in 1921, the house eventually passed on to his nephew, Gordon Edwards, who later became a member of Parliament for Ottawa in 1926.\n\nExpropriation\n\nThe battle to bring 24 Sussex into public hands was long and hard-fought. By 1943, the federal government owned almost all the land stretching along the Ottawa River – from the French Embassy to Earnscliffe, the former home of Sir John A. Macdonald. There were fears at the time that the shoreline would be “commercialized,” which the government wanted to prevent at all costs. In 1943, an eviction notice was served to Gordon Edwards, who spent the last few remaining years of his life disputing the order. The government won the dispute, but even after the courts settled the matter in 1946, it seemed uncertain as to what to do with the house.\n\nIn 1950, a decision was finally taken to refurbish the property as an official residence for the prime minister. This was an era of rampant “modernism,” and during the renovations, many Victorian features of the house — both inside and out — were removed: including the bay windows, wood paneling, several of the fine fireplaces and even the elaborate wooden trim.\n\nOfficial life\n\nThe last thing Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent wanted in 1950 was to move in the official residence. He eventually consented, as long as he could continue to pay rent (a practice that continued until 1971). Since then, the house has been occupied by a succession of government leaders, including John Diefenbaker, Lester B. Pearson and Pierre Elliott Trudeau. The list of dignitaries who visited the house is also impressive, including Sir Winston Churchill, Queen Elizabeth II, and John and Jacqueline Kennedy, just to name a few."
