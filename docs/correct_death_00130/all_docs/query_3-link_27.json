        "text": "[Enclosure]\n\n4\n\nSPECIFIC TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION BY THE PRESIDENT AT OTTAWA\n\n1. Continental Defense\n\nOur relationship with Canada in cooperative efforts to improve the defense of the North American Continent has been most fruitful and is of an especially intimate character. Consultation is maintained through a number of joint committees of which the best known is the Permanent Joint Board on Defense. We would like to have the Conservative Government’s assurance that this relationship will continue. We have been pleased to note recently that the Canadian Parliament has ratified the establishment of the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) under General Partridge and Air Marshal Slemon. We view this Command as part of the NATO concept.\n\n2. Atomic Energy Cooperation\n\nCooperation between Canada and the United States in the peaceful uses of atomic energy has been closer than with any other country. The Canadians will be interested to know that under our amended Atomic Energy Act, agreements for greater cooperation in non-weapons military applications, e.g., power reactors for propulsion and other purposes, will be possible.\n\n3. Development of the Columbia River Basin\n\nWe should call the attention of the Prime Minister to the rising concern among people of the Pacific northwest states over General McNaughton’s public statements reflecting his interest in the possible future diversion of Columbia River waters into the Fraser. We hope that the Canadian Government shares, and will continue to share, our belief that the Columbia Basin should be jointly developed on a cooperative and equitable basis to obtain maximum benefits for both countries.\n\n4. Meeting of Joint Cabinet Committee on Economic and Trade Affairs\n\nWe have suggested to the Canadians that the next annual meeting be in Ottawa on August 4. Although my trip to Brazil will prevent my attending, Mr. Dillon will be able to represent the State Department, and [Page 689] the other Cabinet officers concerned on our side will be available. The Canadians may prefer a date later in the Fall. We should try to get them to accept an August date, in order to provide an early forum for detailed discussion of matters which would otherwise take too much of the time of your visit. Moreover, we consider it important to have such a meeting prior to the Commonwealth Economic Conference opening in Montreal September 15, so as to forestall any action at that Conference directed against the United States.\n\n5. Specific Economic Problems\n\nAs regards individual problems such as our wheat disposal programs under PL 480,5 the restriction of oil imports and the tariff on lead and zinc, I would suggest that you should avoid being drawn out further than the statements contained in your speech. The valid objections of the Canadians to our wheat disposal effort centered on the operation of our barter programs. This program was drastically revised and curtailed over a year ago and since then Canadian experts admit that our wheat disposal program is no obstacle to Canada. This is borne out by this year’s Canadian wheat export figures. Virtually all other questions can be deferred until the Joint Cabinet Committee can discuss them.\n\n6. Opening of St. Lawrence Seaway\n\nYou may wish to indicate to the Prime Minister your expectation of participating in an international ceremony marking the official opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. Tentative plans call for the ceremony to be held on Cornwall Island (Canadian territory) on June 23, 1959.\n\n7. Visit of Prime Minister Diefenbaker\n\nI recall that a few months ago when you suggested to Prime Minister Diefenbaker that he visit Washington, he urged you to come to Canada instead and you agreed. In this context you might tell him, without mentioning any date, that you hope your next meeting with him will be in Washington.\n\n8. Trade with Communist China\n\nWhile Canada does not recognize the Communist Chinese Government and maintains controls over trade with that country, it does permit trade in non-strategic commodities. There has been recent criticism in Canada that the United States’ China trade policy operates to prevent U.S.-owned Canadian companies from selling merchandise, particularly automobiles, to Communist China. To meet this problem we are prepared to propose during your visit a modification in the Treasury [Page 690] Department’s licensing practices governing the operations of American subsidiaries established in Canada. While we should not publish the details of our proposal, the Canadian Government will want to be in a position to indicate that some accommodation has been reached on this score. This will result in pressures for similar treatment for United States subsidiaries in Japan, Indonesia and elsewhere and might also lead to similar pressures from some U.S. domestic interests. We assume in this connection that the Canadian Government will not recognize Communist China and will continue to support the moratorium formula in the United Nations.\n\n9. Concessions to Canadians in COCOM\n\nWe hope to obtain Canadian support for the continued embargo of nickel and cobalt if the U.S. agrees to a removal of copper from the multilateral embargo list. In this connection it can be noted that, of the 7 metals items which Canada wishes to delete from embargo (iron and steel scrap, molybdenum, aluminum, copper, cobalt and nickel) the U.S. in the COCOM negotiations has already made significant concessions on the first three.\n\n10. Arctic Inspection Zone\n\nPrime Minister Diefenbaker has not yet replied to a letter from Khrushchev dated May 30, in which the Soviet leader took sharp exception to Diefenbaker’s earlier disapproval of the Soviet attitude regarding the U.S. proposal in the UN for an Arctic inspection zone. We have agreed, at the Canadian request, to postpone the transmission of your reply to Khrushchev’s letter to you of May 9 until after your visit to Ottawa. Now there is the new Khrushchev letter to you, received July 2. This subject should be discussed.6\n\n11. NATO Food Bank\n\nPrime Minister Diefenbaker has referred on several occasions recently to the desirability of setting up “something in the nature of a food bank whereby there will be available under NATO direction food for distribution among those countries that today stand in danger of being overrun by the Soviets by economic means”. In view of the generalized nature of his suggestions we are not clear whether the Prime Minister is suggesting jointly controlled stockpiles or individual national stockpiles. The Canadian proposals are now properly before the NATO Food and Agricultural Committee for further study.\n\n[Page 691]\n\n12. Other International Questions\n\nIn developing the theme of the interdependence of independent nations, it would be useful to refer to Canada’s recent effective participation in the solution of major international problems, for example: their contribution of forces to the United Nations command in Korea; their participation in the International Control Commission in the Indo-China States; and their participation in the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East. We hope to encourage the Conservative Government to continue playing this kind of effective role in international affairs. The Canadians may also be interested in learning our thinking on Lebanon and on problems faced by De Gaulle in Algeria and Tunisia. These and other wide-ranging international questions whose bilateral aspects are of interest to the Canadians might most appropriately be discussed in detail by me when I meet with the Minister of External Affairs, Mr. Smith.\n\n13. Communiqué\n\nFor our purposes, a communiqué or joint statement following your visit is not necessary. Your meeting with the Prime Minister is to be of the same informal nature as Prime Minister Macmillan’s recent visit with you. A communiqué would impair this aspect of informality, and it is preferable to avoid focusing public attention on specific matters, since the problem troubling the Canadians cannot be wholly resolved at this time. However, it is probable that the Canadians will press us for either a communiqué or joint statement. If they do, I believe that, rather than let the matter become a major issue, we could agree to generalized language emphasizing mutual cordiality and cooperation."
