He studied in University of Saskatchewan and become a Lawyer.\n\nDiefenbaker became Canadas best criminal lawyer and a great debater. He also had a quote remarkable newsboy, and Sir Wilfred Laurier gave this quote to him. At the age of fifteen, Diefenbaker walked with Laurier for half an hour while delivering the newspaper.\n\nDiefenbaker always has an interest in politics. Diefenbaker was chosen conservative leader at a convention in Ottawa in 1956, and the following year, his party won 112 seats, more than any other group.\n\nAfter won those seats, Diefenbaker formed a government. After that Diefenbaker won 208 seats out of 245 because of the deal between in the House Membership and Diefenbaker party. In 1965, the liberal position improved very well and John remained leader of the opposition. One of the outstanding measures of the Diefenbaker party was containing Bill of Right, and Aboriginal right to vote."
