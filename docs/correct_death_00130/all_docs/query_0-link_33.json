Some of the entries were taken from the 2008 edition of Chase’s Calendar of Events, the standard reference book that for 50 years has provided librarians and the media with events arranged day-by-day. Hundreds of entries were written especially for The Teacher’s Calendar. For example, among the “Birthdays Today” entries are birthdays for authors of children’s books. We’ve also added the dates of national professional meetings for teachers, children’s book conferences and other events of interest to professional educators.\n\nSponsored Events: We obtain information on these events directly from their sponsors and provide contact information for the sponsoring organization. Other Special Days, Weeks and Months: Information on these events is also obtained from their sponsors. Process for Declaring Special Observances How do special days, weeks and months get created? The president of the United States has the authority to declare a commemorative event by proclamation, but this is done infrequently. In 2000, for example, the president issued about 100 proclamations. Many of these, such as Mother’s Day and Bill of Rights Week, were proclamations for which there was legislation giving continuing authority for a proclamation to be issued each year. Until 1995, Congress was active in seeing that special observances were commemorated. Members of the Senate and House could introduce legislation for a special observance to commemorate people, events and other activities they thought worthy of national recognition. Because these bills took up a lot of time on the part of members of Congress, when Congress met in January 1995 to reform its rules and procedures, it was decided to discontinue this practice. Today, the Senate passes resolutions commemorating special days, weeks and months but these resolutions do not have the force of law. It is not necessary to have the president or a senator declare a special day, week or month; many of the events in The Teacher’s Calendar have been declared only by their sponsoring organizations.\n\nTypes of Events Presidential Proclamations: We have included in the dayby-day chronology proclamations that have continuing authority with a formula for calculating the dates of observance and those that have been issued consistently since 1995. The president issues proclamations only a few days before the actual event so it is possible that some dates may vary slightly for 2008–2009. The most recent proclamations can be found on the Federal Register Online: www.access.gpo.gov. ★ in the text indicates presidential proclamations. National Holidays and State Days: Public holidays of other nations are gleaned from United Nations documents and from information from tourism agencies. Technically, the United States has no national holidays. Those holidays proclaimed by the president apply only to federal employees and to the District of Columbia. Governors of the states proclaim holidays for their states. In practice, federal holidays are usually proclaimed as state holidays as well. Some governors also proclaim holidays unique to their state but not all state holidays are commemorated with the closing of schools and offices. Religious Observances: Principal observances of the Christian, Jewish and Muslim faiths are presented with background information from their respective calendars. For dates of Jewish observances, we refer to Arthur Spier’s Comprehensive Hebrew Calendar. We use anticipated dates for Muslim holidays. There is no single Hindu or Buddhist calendar; therefore, we are able to provide only a limited number of religious holidays for these faiths. Historic Events and Birth Anniversaries: Dates for these entries have been gathered from a wide range of reference sources. Most birth anniversaries here are for people who are deceased. Birthdays of living people are usually listed under “Birthdays Today.” Astronomical Phenomena: Information about eclipses, equinoxes and solstices, and moon phases is calculated from the annual publication, Astronomical Phenomena, from the US Naval Observatory. Dates for these events in Astronomical Phenomena are given in Universal Time (i.e., Greenwich Mean Time). We convert these dates and times into Eastern Standard or Eastern Daylight Time.\n\nWebsites Web addresses have been provided when relevant. These URLs were checked the first week in January 2008. Although we have tried to select sites maintained by the government, universities and other stable organizations, some of these sites inevitably change or disappear.

To escape deportation to concentration\n\nAugust 2008\n\ncamps, the Jewish family of Otto Frank hid for two years in the warehouse of his food products business at Amsterdam. Gentile friends smuggled in food and other supplies during their confinement. Thirteen-year-old Anne Frank, who kept a journal during the time of their hiding, penned her last entry in the diary Aug 1, 1944: “[I] keep on trying to find a way of becoming what I would like to be, and what I could be, if . . . there weren’t any other people living in the world.” Three days later (Aug 4, 1944) Grüne Polizei raided the “Secret Annex” where the Frank family was hidden. Anne and her sister were sent to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where Anne died at age 15, two months before the liberation of Holland. Young Anne’s diary, later found in the family’s hiding place, has been translated into 30 languages and has become a symbol of the indomitable strength of the human spirit.

Virginia planter Robert Carter III confounded his family and friends by filing a deed of emancipation for his 500 slaves. One of the wealthiest men in the state, Carter owned 60,000 acres over 18 plantations. The deed included the following words: “I have for some time past been convinced that to retain them in Slavery is contrary to the true principles of Religion and Justice and therefore it is my duty to manumit them.” The document established a schedule by which 15 slaves would be freed each Jan 1, over a 21-year period, plus slave children would be freed at age 18 for females and 21 for males. It is believed this was the largest act of emancipation in US history and predated the Emancipation Proclamation by 70 years. FIRST US CENSUS: ANNIVERSARY. Aug 1, 1790.

It first bloomed in cultivation at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in England in 1889 and in the US at the New York Botanic Garden in 1937.

That is the sum of money Aaron Montgomery Ward used to launch the ﬁrst mail-order catalog on this date in 1872. Aaron Montgomery Ward (1844–1913) started working for a department store both as a salesclerk and a traveling salesperson. A true visionary, he realized that ordering items by mail could be a great convenience, especially for rural customers. They would not have to spend the time traveling to towns and cities to purchase the items they needed. Aaron Montgomery Ward established the ﬁrst mail-order business in Chicago. The ﬁrst catalog was only a single 8- by 10inch sheet of paper, which listed items for sale along with ordering instructions. The catalog continued to grow, offering more items and a “satisfaction guarantee.” The company expanded to include retail stores, with the ﬁrst Montgomery Ward store opening in 1926. By 1929 Montgomery Ward had become a successful chain with over 500 stores. The 1960s saw a decline in Montgomery Ward’s mail-order business, and the last catalog was sent in 1985. The last retail store closed in 2000. Aaron Montgomery Ward paved the way for other mailorder catalogs. Ordering items by mail is still a way that many people prefer to shop. Students can gain an appreciation for placing orders by mail by going on a catalog shopping spree. Obtain catalogs from family, colleagues and friends. Set a spending limit for each student. They should select items and complete the order form, including shipping costs and applicable sales tax. As students total their ﬁnal cost, they should check to see that they have stayed within the limit. Shipping and handling charges, which are often based on the cost of the order, lead to a great graphing activity for older students and provide a real-life application of an abstract concept. By using the x-axis to represent the total cost of the items and the y-axis to represent the shipping cost, students can graph a special type of function called a step function. The mail-order business will continue to thrive and provide a shopping venue for consumers, thanks to the foresight of Aaron Montgomery Ward. —Judy Muschla\n\nBIRTHDAYS TODAY Norm Coleman, 59, US Senator (R, Minnesota), born Brooklyn, NY, Aug 17, 1949.
