        "text": "928, Friday November 9, The Almonte Gazette front page\n\nJohn Neilson Passes After A Brief Illness\n\nWas One of the Outstanding Citizens of Almonte for Many Years\n\nWas Born on the Pioneer Homestead of the Neilsons in Ramsay.\n\nHe was 78 Years of Age. His Wife Died 22 Years Ago.\n\nAlmonte has lost a valued and honoured citizen, in the death of Mr John Neilson, who passed away on Sunday evening. His death was a great shock to the town and district, for he had been ill only a few days. Mr Neilson was one of the outstanding citizens of the town, and was held in the highest esteem by a very large circle of friends, both in town and throughout the surrounding district. He was the son of the late Mr and Mrs James Neilson and was in his 79th year. Born in March 1850, in the old pioneer homestead on the 12th line Ramsay, where his grandfather, John Neilson, who came out from Scotland, settled there in the year 1820. Mr Neilson later moved to the 11th line Ramsay, where he successfully followed the occupation of farming for many years until he retired in 1916 and moved to Almonte, where he had since resided.\n\nActive Church Worker\n\nIn religion the late Mr Neilson was a staunch Presbyterian. he took an active part in church work, and was a member of the Board of Session for many years. At the time of church union he held the opposite view and adhered to the Continuing body of that denomination and was a member of the Session of that church, up to the time of his death. He was predeceased by his wife, Janet McIlquam, who died twenty-two years ago, in May 1906. He is survived by four sisters, Agnes, Mrs Wilkie, of Toronto, widow of the late Rev John Wilkie, formerly of Indore, India; Marion, Mrs David Forgie, of Cleveland, Ohio; and the Misses Sarah and Jessie, both of whom resided with him at the family home here. Two brothers Matthew and William, and two sisters, Margaret and Mary, died some years ago.\n\nThe Funeral\n\nThe funeral took place on Tuesday from the family residence to the Presbyterian Church, and thence to the Auld Kirk Cemetery. Impressive services were conducted by the Rev W.H. McCracken, assisted by Rev George Thom. Mr McCracken made reference to the high character and staunch personality of the deceased elder, and there was a large congregation of mourners, many coming from long distances to pay a final tribute of respect and friendship. There were many floral offerings and messages of sympathy. The pallbearers were: Messrs Stanley Neilson, Montreal; James Neilson, Toronto; John Neilson, Welland; Robert Neilson, Ottawa; George McCallum, Carleton Place, all nephews of deceased, and Mr W. D. Aikenhead, of Pakenham.\n\nContributor: Gary J Byron (49329383)\n\nRead–When Corn Doesn’t Grow- Neilson Chocolate Will\n\nRemember These? The Neilson Dairy\n\nSuspended Teacher —Appleton School 1931 — Miss Annie Neilson\n\nPhoto-Brent Whiten‎Hershey Friends and Family\n\nDocumentation thanks to—-Harrison Barconnor\n\nThe Former Hershey Factory in Smiths Falls:\n\nIt was a 470,000 sq. ft. chocolate factory opened by The Hershey Company in 1963 and was the first Hershey plant to be opened outside the United States.\n\nGrand Opening 1962\n\nThe Rise\n\nThe story begins in 1960 when the Smiths Falls Chamber of Commerce stood at the end of one street in Smiths Falls attempting to stop the first car with foreign licence plates. They devised the clever plan so they could hopefully sell the occupants of the car on the town. The first car they stopped happened to contain the occupants of the Hershey Chocolate Company looking to open a new Canadian facility– and by 1961 construction had started.\n\nSmiths Falls was selected because of its adequate source of labour, plentiful supply of milk, water, and its location with direct railway lines. It was also situated conveniently between the main marketing areas of Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa. On June 16th, 1963 the Smiths Falls Hershey plant was officially opened.\n\nThe Smiths Falls factory was the first to incorporate a Visitors Gallery which was an elevated walk way where visitors could view the factory’s production. The Visitor Gallery received over 960 visitors on opening day, and the Smiths Falls facility was also the first plant opened outside Lancaster, PA.\n\nThe Smiths Falls facility began with 200,000 square feet of production space capable of producing 200,000 bars a day. Its first products produced at the factory were 5 and 10 cent chocolate bars, instant chocolate, cocoa, chocolate chip and chocolate syrup. In 1965 Hershey’s introduced the Peanut Butter Cup and production lines where soon added to the Smiths Falls plant. By 1966 the plant had employed around 105 people.\n\nHigh Sales\n\nIn the mid 70’s the cost of a chocolate bar had risen to 25 cents a bar and sales for the Smiths Falls plant had reached approximately $20,000,000 dollars per year.\n\nArsonist Attack\n\nOn March 17th 1973, a lit flair was thrown through a window into the plant which\n\nsubsequently set the factory’s bean warehouse on fire. There was no major damage done to the facility and the fire was under control within a few minutes..\n\nThe 1989 Expansion\n\nDuring 1989 a new warehouse was constructed allowing the factory to store more goods.\n\nFreezer Snacks—On December 31, 1996 Hershey Canada purchased the shares of Leaf Canada Inc. acquiring the rights to Mr. Freeze (a water based freezer snack). In 1998 all of the freezer snack production moved to the Smiths Falls plant.\n\nThe Plant’s 3 Millionth Visitor\n\nOn Feb 7th, 1998, three year-old Garett Sanderson became the factory’s 3 millionth visitor, a huge milestone for the plant’s shop, and on August 13th, 1998, the plant received 86 visitor buses, a new record.\n\nThe 2001 Shop Expansion\n\nDuring the late 90’s it was discovered that the Smiths Falls factory store was inadequate, and during 1999 and 2000 plans were made to expand the plant’s store. Construction for the new shop was done throughout spring 2001, and on July 19th, 2001, the newly renovated shop was officially opened.\n\nThe 2001 – 2006 Plant Renovation\n\nBetween 2001 and 2006 Hershey’s spent over 100,000,000 US dollars modernizing the plant and its production lines.\n\nThe 2004 Strike\n\nOn March 14th 2004, Hershey workers went on strike, demanding they receive the same benefits of their American counter parts.\n\nRecord Numbers of Visitors\n\nThroughout 2005 the plant received 450,000 visitors, the largest amount of visitors in a year.\n\nThe Contamination\n\nOn November 9th, 2006, salmonella was detected on a routine inspection of the plant which prompted a recall and the plant and shop had to be temporally closed. The source of the salmonella was confirmed to be soy lecithin, a product used to help chocolate retain its sheen. It seems the soy lecithin got contaminated at some point during shipping, possibly due to improperly refrigerated shipping containers. The Hershey Co. attempted to sue the supplier of the soy lecithin, but was unsuccessful due to a contract which stated: “All contents of sale is final”.\n\nMore Contaminated Goods\n\nIn 2009, some of the contaminated goods were stolen from a recycling plant where they were set to be destroyed and they managed to find their way back onto store shelves in Eastern Toronto. The thieves where caught and fined. There was also a separate case of 2 young teenagers finding a box of the contaminated products in a dumpster and bringing them to school. Thankfully the teachers caught them right before anyone had consumed any of the contaminated chocolate. Hershey slowly rehired 200 workers to help sanitize the plant, and by December 2006 the plant was back up and running.\n\nThe Closure\n\nOn February the 11th 2007, Hershey announced the Falls plant would close. The closure of the plant was part of a global restructuring plan. Hershey confirmed the plant would remain open throughout 2007 and 2008 although production would slowly be fazed out.\n\nThe Rally Against The Closure\n\nOn February 24th 2007, Hershey workers, the Canadian Autoworkers Union, and local residents of the surrounding area’s joined forces in a rally in front of the Hershey factory tried to prevent the now impending closure. Unfortunately, the rally did not change the company’s decision to close the 47 year-old complex.\n\nThe Final Closure\n\nBy late November 2008 the plant was only running at 20% capacity. This was largely due to a high Canadian dollar, which had been caused by the 2008 recession. On December 23rd 2008, the factory’s production shutdown along with the associated shop. Hershey’s would then open a new plant in Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nResults of the Closure\n\nThe closure of the Smiths Falls plant caused a 650 worker layoff combined with spin off jobs such as producing dairy and packaging for the plant.\n\nThe Auction\n\nIn the summer of 2009 Hershey sold off 76 million dollars of former chocolate and confectionery equipment to local plants as well as plants in countries as far away as Africa and China.\n\n“Aquablue”\n\nDuring that time a company named “Aquablue” announced it would be opening a water bottle plant in the former Hershey plant and possibly hire over 200 workers. They also said that they would open a recycling plant as well and an amusement park which would bring in as many tourists as Hershey did.\n\nBy 2011 Aquablue still hadn’t purchased the Hershey plant and it was revealed that the company’s CEO had transferred over $100,000,000 dollars in investors money into his personal account. The water bottling plant never opened, and the building sat vacant.\n\nSold\n\nOn May 24 2012, the plant was finally sold to Icon international. The building was listed in 2009 for around 10 – 9 million Canadian dollars and it was puchased in 2012 for an estimated 2.6 million.\n\nClose Call to Demolition.\n\nIn 2013 plans were being written to demolish the plant, and in November 2013, Tweed Inc. along with Saumure Building Group purchased the plant and it’s exterior building.\n\n“Tweed & Saumure Building Group”\n\nIn 2014 Tweed Inc. transformed the plant’s former shipping room into a medical marijuana grow-op. Construction on the grow-op continued through 2015 although useage was only around 1/3 of the plant’s space.\n\n“Summit Energy”\n\nIn January 2015 Summit Energy Inc. announced it would be taking over the former peanut production section of the plant and hiring around 20 workers. Summit Energy had plans to covert plastic waste such as water bottles to diesel. However residents living near the plant had concerns about a potential fire or dangerous fumes in the air. Trying to rezone the old factory also had its issues and by March 2015 plans for the waste to diesel plant ended.\n\nThe Tweed Expansion\n\nIn spring 2016 Tweed announced it would be expanding its operations for the impending legalization of marijuana. On December 24th 2016, Tweed purchased the rest of the former Hershey plant from Saumure building group and investors.\n\nAs of 2017 is unclear as to what will happen with all of the ex-Hershey confectionery equipment and former tour infrastructure, but according to Tweed they have big plans for the empty building.\n\nDocumentation thanks to—-Harrison Barconnor\n\nMike\n\n10 hours\n\nHello from Montreal Linda, well compiled article, i’m hoping you can help me solve a mystery. Only a couple years ago i could purchase hersheys chocolate syrup (sauce?) in a small yellow can, i believe it had a picture of a chocolate sunday on the front.
