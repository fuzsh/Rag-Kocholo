We convert these dates and times into Eastern Standard or Eastern Daylight Time. Sponsored Events: We obtain information on these events directly from their sponsors and provide contact information for the sponsoring organization that is given to us. Other Special Days, Weeks and Months: Information on these events is also obtained from their sponsors.\n\nThis edition of The Teacher’s Calendar contains more than 4,500 events that you can use in planning the school calendar, creating bulletin boards and developing lesson plans. Some of the entries were taken from the 2010 edition of Chase’s Calendar of Events, the standard reference book that for 53 years has provided librarians and the media with events arranged day-by-day. But most of the entries were written especially for The Teacher’s Calendar. For example, among the “Birthdays Today” entries are birthdays for authors of children’s books. We’ve also added the dates of national professional meetings for teachers, children’s book conferences and other events of interest to professional educators.\n\nProcess for Declaring Special Observances How do special days, weeks and months get created? The president of the United States has the authority to declare a commemorative event by proclamation, but this is done infrequently. In 2000, for example, the president issued about 100 proclamations. Many of these, such as Mother’s Day and Bill of Rights Week, were proclamations for which there was legislation giving continuing authority for a proclamation to be issued each year. Until 1995, Congress was active in seeing that special observances were commemorated. Members of the Senate and House could introduce legislation for a special observance to commemorate people, events and other activities they thought worthy of national recognition. Because these bills took up a lot of time on the part of members of Congress, when Congress met in January 1995 to reform its rules and procedures, it was decided to discontinue this practice. Today, the Senate passes resolutions commemorating special days, weeks and months but these resolutions do not have the force of law. It is not necessary to have the president or a senator declare a special day, week or month; many of the events in The Teacher’s Calendar have been declared only by their sponsoring organizations.\n\nTypes of Events Presidential Proclamations: We have included in the day-by-day chronology proclamations that have continuing authority with a formula for calculating the dates of observance and those that have been issued consistently since 1995. The president issues proclamations only a few days before the actual event so it is possible that some dates may vary slightly for 2010–2011. The most recent proclamations can be found on the Federal Register Online: www.access.gpo.gov. A ★ in the text indicates presidential proclamations. National Holidays and State Days: Public holidays of other nations are gleaned from United Nations documents and from information from tourism agencies. Technically, the United States has no national holidays. Those holidays proclaimed by the president apply only to federal employees and to the District of Columbia. Governors of the states proclaim holidays for their states. In practice, federal holidays are usually proclaimed as state holidays as well. Some governors also proclaim holidays unique to their state but not all state holidays are commemorated with the closing of schools and ofﬁces. Religious Observances: Principal observances of the Christian, Jewish and Muslim faiths are presented with background information from their respective calendars. For dates of Jewish observances, we refer to Arthur Spier’s Comprehensive Hebrew Calendar. We use anticipated dates for Muslim holidays. There is no single Hindu or Buddhist calendar; therefore, we are able to provide only a limited number of religious holidays for these faiths. Historic Events and Birth Anniversaries: Dates for these entries have been gathered from a wide range of reference sources. Most birth anniversaries here are for people who are deceased. Birthdays of living people are usually listed under “Birthdays Today.” Astronomical Phenomena: Information about eclipses, equinoxes and solstices and moon phases is calculated from the annual publication, Astronomical Phenomena, from the US Naval Observatory. Dates for these events in Astronomical Phenomena are given in Universal Time (that is, Greenwich\n\nWebsites Web addresses have been provided when relevant. These URLs were checked the ﬁrst week in January 2010. Although we have tried to select sites maintained by the government, universities and other stable organizations, some of these sites inevitably change or disappear.\n\nCurriculum Connections These sidebars were written by Laura Schocker, Sally Walker, Luisa Gerasimo, Denise Frank, Erin Muschla and Judy Muschla, as well as the editor, to give teachers ideas for integrating some of the events in The Teacher’s Calendar into the classroom.\n\nAcknowledgements Special thanks to my colleagues at McGraw-Hill: Marisa L’Heureux, Holly McGuire, Denise Fieldman, Gigi Grajdura, Julia Anderson Bauer, Lyzette Austen, Rebecca Silvers and Handel Low.

To escape deportation to concentration camps, the Jewish family of Otto Frank hid for two years in the warehouse of his food products business at Amsterdam. Gentile friends smuggled in food and other supplies during their conﬁnement. Thirteen-year-old Anne Frank, who kept a journal during the time of their hiding, penned her last entry in the diary Aug 1, 1944: “[I] keep on trying to ﬁnd a way of becoming what I would like to be, and what I could be, if . . . there weren’t any other people living in the world.” Three days later (Aug 4, 1944) Grüne Polizei raided the “Secret Annex” where the Frank family was hidden. Anne and her sister were sent to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where Anne died at age 15, two months before the liberation of Holland. Young Anne’s diary, later found in the family’s hiding place, has been translated into 30 languages and has become a symbol of the indomitable strength of the human spirit.

Virginia planter Robert Carter III confounded his family and friends by ﬁ ling a deed of emancipation for his 500 slaves. One of the wealthiest men in the state, Carter owned 60,000 acres over 18 plantations. The deed included the following words: “I have for some time past been convinced that to retain them in Slavery is contrary to the true principles of Religion and Justice and therefore it is my duty to manumit them.” The document established a schedule by which 15 slaves would be freed each Jan 1, over a 21-year period, plus slave children would be freed at age 18 for females and 21 for males. It is believed this was the largest act of emancipation in US history and predated the Emancipation Proclamation by 70 years. FIRST US CENSUS: ANNIVERSARY. Aug 1, 1790.

Aug 3, 1900. Central ﬁgure in a cause célèbre (the “Scopes Trial” or the “Monkey Trial”), John Thomas Scopes was born at Paducah, KY. An obscure 24-year-old schoolteacher at the Dayton, TN, high school in 1925, he became the focus of world attention. Scopes never uttered a word at his trial, which was a contest between two of America’s best-known lawyers (William Jennings Bryan and Clarence Darrow). The trial, July 10–21, 1925, resulted in Scopes’s conviction “for teaching evolution” in Tennessee. He was ﬁned $100. The verdict was upset on a technicality, and the statute he was accused of breaching was repealed in 1967. Scopes died at Shreveport, LA, Oct 21, 1970.

Commemorate what would have been his 100th birthday in your classroom with a celebration of music. Schuman ﬁrst discovered his musical talent as a child, when he began to study the violin and other instruments. Growing up, he played music with his family and even started his own jazz band while he was still in high school. Remind your class of Schuman’s early beginnings and then get them started with their own music projects. Start by listening to a few of his songs for inspiration—the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, for instance, has a recording that includes his Symphonies 4 and 9, as well as his Orchestra Song and Circus Overture ($8.99). Schuman’s music was often inspired by poetry. This link between words and music can make for a nice exercise in your classroom. Assign students to choose a favorite song without lyrics. Then ask them to take a few days to ﬁnd a poem that ﬁts well with their song. Play each one for the class and have the students read their poems aloud. More advanced students may want to write their own poem, or lyrics, to accompany their song instead. Ask them to explain why the music made them feel the way it did and how they came up with the words to accompany their song. William Howard Schuman was also known for working with preexisting music. Ask your students to choose a favorite song and then adapt the lyrics. You may ask them to take a childhood song and make it applicable to their current lives or to take a well-known song and alter it to evoke a different emotion—whether it’s making a serious song funny or a childish song more mature. —Laura Schocker\n\nBIRTHDAYS TODAY Tom Brady, 33, football player, born San Mateo, CA, Aug 3, 1977.

In a time when woman weren’t expected to become superstars, she opened doors for other females and made a name for herself as an athlete and a record-breaking sports shooter. Oakley (born Phoebe Ann Mosey) also fought for the everyday woman’s right to bear arms and helped to train thousands in gun safety. She died on Nov 3, 1926, but her life and work are often credited with breaking down barriers that women have faced in society. Bring this modern-minded woman into your own modern classroom with some of these books: Who Was Annie Oakley? by Stephanie Spinner (Grosset & Dunlap, 978-0448424972, $4.99 Ages 9–12) Annie Oakley by Charles M.

Remind them that the everyday victories count just as much as the extraordinary ones. Alternatively, you can assign each member of your class another woman to learn about. Younger children may want to get dressed up as this person and do a small presentation, while older students may beneﬁt from a research paper—possible subjects could be Marie Curie, Anne Frank or Rosa Parks. —Laura Schocker\n\nBIRTHDAYS TODAY Michael Bennett, 32, football player, born Milwaukee, WI, Aug 13, 1978.

By signing the bill into law, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was fulﬁlling a 1932 campaign promise. For more info: www.ssa.gov.\n\nAUGUST 14 THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT IS SIGNED INTO LAW: 75th ANNIVERSARY President Franklin D. Roosevelt ﬁrst signed the Social Security Act into law on Aug 14, 1935. The two major goals of the original act were to support state welfare programs for the aged and to create a new old-age insurance program that would pay a wage to primary workers after they retired at the age of 65. Social Security is a complex and sometimes controversial topic. To introduce it to your students, create a monetary system in your classroom. Assign students one job each week on a rotating basis. The jobs can be anything from cleaning the board to writing the day’s homework at the end of the day to feeding the class pet—whatever you need to help the classroom run smoother. Tell the students that they will be paid one “classroom” dollar each week for the successful completion of their projects. Distribute these checks at the end of the week and ask students to keep track of their wages in a “checkbook” spreadsheet that you will provide to them. Tell them that there will be a 10 percent tax each week for the greater good of the classroom. At the end of the year, the total amount of this money can be “cashed” in for a large event, whether it’s a party or a ﬁeld trip or an extra-long recess. Also, tell them that there will be a 10 percent Social Security tax. In the last month of the school year, everyone will “retire” from their classroom jobs and will have to live off of what was saved in Social Security, divided among the students. The children are responsible for calculating and deducting these amounts from their paycheck each week. Once a month, bring out a “store” where students can spend or save their money—you can offer products like school supplies or free homework passes. Older students may want to do a research project based on the Social Security Act. One of the major challenges when the act ﬁrst began was to create Social Security numbers for everyone. Along these lines, students may choose to write a paper about protecting Social Security numbers in the modern world of identity theft. Or, they may be interested in researching how an act changes through time to adapt to different circumstances, as has happened with the Social Security Act. —Laura Schocker\n\nV-J (VICTORY OVER JAPAN) DAY: 65th ANNIVERSARY.
