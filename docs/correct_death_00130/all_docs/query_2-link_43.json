        "text": "Visit the John & Olive Diefenbaker Museum at 246-19th Street West, and learn about the personal life of Canada's thirteenth Prime Minister. The Rt. Hon. John Diefenbaker lived in the house from 1947 to 1957, and the house is furnished with artifacts from both his Prince Albert and Ottawa homes. Diefenbaker was an admirer of Sir John A. Macdonald and two artefacts originally belonging to Macdonald are on display as well. The museum was designated a national historic site on January 12, 2018 by the Government of Canada.\n\nJohn Diefenbaker transferred ownership of the house to the City of Prince Albert for the purpose of becoming a museum. The museum opened to the public in 1983, with the help of the Prince Albert Historical Society and the Diefenbaker Canada Centre.\n\nThe staff at the John & Olive Diefenbaker Museum look forward to welcoming you! The summer phone number is 306-953-4863."
