He was also seen in the first episode of \"Out of Jimmy's Head\". He fondly remembered George Clooney, and how George was so polite and called him \"Mr. Bliss\" and offered him food on the set of Intolerable Cruelty.\n\nHe had many stories to tell of his life's adventures, and was a very talented actor.Fact|date=March 2008 During some of his storytelling, he told us he was born to acting parents in Peoria, Illinois, but moved from time to time (Florida, New York, Europe). When he was a child, acting on the stage with his parents, they rarely told others of their true profession of acting, because it was \"looked down upon in those days.\"\n\nExternal links"
