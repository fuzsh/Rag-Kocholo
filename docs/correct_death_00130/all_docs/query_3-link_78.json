        "text": "I should like to begin by thanking Tom Maddux and Diane Labrosse of H-Diplo for setting up and preparing the roundtable, Mike Carroll for his précis, and the four reviewers for their insightful commentary on my book. Both as scholars and colleagues, I deeply respect Stephen Azzi, Jack Cunningham, Daniel Macfarlane, and Robert Rakove, and so I am delighted to receive their feedback, particularly as it is so positive. Indeed, given their warm words, there is little to which I feel I should respond, other than to emphasize my hope that Americans will read this book and be prompted to take Canada-U.S. relations more seriously. Canadians are wont to make this point, but happily it is one made too by Rakove in his review.\n\nReaders of the roundtable will note one area of disagreement between Macfarlane and myself: the issue of linkage and the wider matter as to whether a special relationship exists between Canada and the United States, or at least between Ottawa and Washington. I have known Dan since our grad school days together in Ottawa (I count him as a friend and fellow Dief-enthusiast), I knew that this issue would be a point of difference between us, I take his point, and I doubt very much whether either of us will agree with the other. While no doubt I am expected to play my assigned role and sally forth to defend my interpretation, it seems to me that far too much time is wasted by historians on questions, which are, simply put, academic. On the issue of linkage, suffice it to say that I believe in a difference between threat and action. Furthermore, what one historian might read as a threat can be better interpreted as a helpful warning or even lament, particularly when a diplomat is referring to actions that might inflame public or legislative opinion and thereby complicate the practice of diplomacy. And given the interdependent nature of Canada-US interaction, the United States Congress is particularly well-placed to complicate matters.[31] As for specialness, beyond the absence of actual (as opposed to threatened) linkage, I think there is something to the notion if only to describe the depth and breadth of Canadian and American interaction on everything from intelligence-sharing to trans-boundary water management (IR theorists Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye’s complex interdependence), the lack of genuine animosity (faculty clubs notwithstanding), and a shared and generally cooperative—or at least sympathetic—worldview (though now we enter the age of President Donald Trump). Admittedly the term ‘special relationship’ may be semantically lazy, but it’s where I’ll hang my hat.\n\nAs none of the reviewers criticized me for it, I should like to raise one small failing myself: my lack of attention to French Canadian opinion. I do indeed ignore Québec; so too did American officials, who began to pay serious attention to Québécois nationalism only in the mid to late 1960s. While Camelot and Canada is fundamentally about U.S. foreign policy toward Canada, I spend considerable time looking at Canadian reactions to American moves, whether in Cuba or Berlin, or on the question of nuclear weapons, and I overlooked Québécois viewpoints. Je suis désolé.\n\nTo conclude, again I thank Azzi, Cunningham, Macfarlane, and Rakove for their reviews and for taking the time to read and comment upon my study. It is gratifying to know that at least four people (plus my mum, dad, and a copyeditor) read it."
