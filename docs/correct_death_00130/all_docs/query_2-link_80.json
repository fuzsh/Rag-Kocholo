        "text": "Originally published as a “Historicist” column on Torontoist on April 30, 2011.\n\nPrime Minister Louis St. Laurent addressing the audience at a Liberal party rally at Maple Leaf Gardens under the gaze of William Lyon Mackenzie King and Wilfrid Laurier, June 7, 1957. City of Toronto Archives, Fonds 1257, Series 1057, Item 4210.\n\nThe 1957 federal election campaign was not going well for the Liberals. The party had run Canada for 22 years and believed it had the power to do anything it wanted. While the ruckus over its attempt the previous spring to force closure on debate over building a national gas pipeline had cost them some popularity, wouldn’t Canadians appreciate all the Liberals had done for them during the postwar economic boom?\n\nParty brass was content to run a campaign based on the status quo, but they hadn’t foreseen the charismatic abilities of new Progressive Conservative leader John Diefenbaker. As crowds at Tory rallies grew, the Liberals panicked. The party hoped that a giant rally at Maple Leaf Gardens three days before the election would provide a final burst of energy to reverse the surge in Tory popularity. Instead, what started out as a glitzy night of entertainment and policy speeches nearly turned to tragedy.\n\nJeanne and Louis St. Laurent at Liberal party rally, Maple Leaf Gardens, June 7, 1957. City of Toronto Archives, Fonds 1257, Series 1057, Item 4213.\n\nWhile Diefenbaker provided the Tories with an energetic leader who had the ability to connect with the concerns of voters, the Liberals ran a prime minister who wasn’t aging well. While the staunchly Liberal Toronto Star declared that Louis St. Laurent was a “vigorous, dignified man of 75,” he showed signs of decline. During the pipeline debate, St. Laurent quietly let his ministers take the lead in defending the government’s actions. As the pre-election parliamentary session wore on, St. Laurent was increasingly prone to fits of temper, possibly provoked by growing bouts of depression. As historian Michael Bliss has speculated, “we do not know how often the septuagenarian prime minister was clear-headed and in command of the government between 1953 and 1957. Like the British Cabinet during [Winston] Churchill’s final years as a senile figurehead in the early 1950s, St. Laurent’s ministers had every interest in minimizing his debilities.” St. Laurent’s advisors portrayed him as kindly, soothing patriarch “Uncle Louis,” but this image faltered when he grew irritated during campaign stops to the point of snapping at children to whom he was supposed to be teaching a history lesson. Unlike Diefenbaker, St. Laurent adapted poorly to the new medium of television—he believed the use of makeup and teleprompters was dishonest and refused to give up the comfort of using hand-held notes. St. Laurent was not helped by the arrogance of leading ministers like C.D. Howe, who had developed a penchant for offending voters and local party officials during campaign stops. The public was starting to sense that the Liberals were out of touch.\n\nThe Star heavily promoted the June 7, 1957 rally, promising readers that it would be “in the old fashioned tradition of hoop-la and bands.” In his study of the campaign, John Meisel summed up the entertainment lineup that night at the Gardens: “There were massed bands, bagpipes, dancing girls, the Leslie Bell Singers, drum majorettes, cheerleaders, cowbells, noisemakers, Lorne Greene as Master of Ceremonies, and a tandem bicycle.” All of the local candidates were seated on stage while their supporters waved signs on the arena floor. Some faithful came in costume, like a group of stereotypical “Indians” who whooped it up when High Park candidate Pat Cameron was introduced.\n\nPrime Minister Louis St. Laurent addressing the audience at a Liberal party rally, Maple Leaf Gardens, June 7, 1957. City of Toronto Archives, Fonds 1257, Series 1057, Item 4211.\n\nThere were also plenty of hecklers ready to spoil the fun. Among those waiting to toss barbs at the stage was 15-year-old University of Toronto Schools student William Hatton. According to his mother, William’s class was encouraged to take an active interest in politics and received credit for attending rallies. Her son supported the Tories and was shocked to see some of the nasty attacks the Liberals desperately made against Diefenbaker. As Mrs. Hatton told the Star, “Adults read what the leaders say about each other; but they know the leaders still go out and have a coffee together afterwards. Teenagers get to take these things pretty seriously. Bill had been reading in magazine articles how the art of heckling was dying; so I guess he decided to do something about it.”\n\nWhile a group of Tories paraded around the floor with pro-Diefenbaker signs, Hatton was handed a small St. Laurent placard. When the prime minister attacked the Conservatives for acting selfishly during the pipeline debate, Hatton took action. Without anyone noticing his approach, Hatton climbed the steps leading to the platform. He stepped in front of St. Laurent and made his feelings clear by tearing the placard in half, which brought a look of disgust upon the prime minister’s face. “As I was doing this,” Hatton later told the Telegram, “some fellow approached me from the side. I’m not sure what he said. Something about ‘what are you doing? You have no business up here.’ I thought he was going to call an officer.”\n\nCaption when this photo was used in the June 8, 1957 edition of the Telegram: “Teen-age heckler William Hatton starts to fall from platform stairway after brief tussle with Vincent Regan, president of Toronto and Yorks Liberal Association. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent watches in consternation.” City of Toronto Archives, Fonds 1257, Series 1057, Item 4215.\n\nThe “fellow” was F. Vincent Regan, president of the Toronto and Yorks Liberal Association, who leapt from his chair and lunged toward Hatton. Depending on the account, Hatton was either pushed from the stage by Regan or lost his balance as he moved backwards. Both men tumbled down the steps leading from the stage, but while Regan regained his balance, Hatton hit his head on the concrete floor. “When the boy crashed to the cement floor,” reported the Telegram, “all the steam—all the fun—went out of the meeting. The 12,000 in the audience who had been enjoying the traditional combat of speakers versus hecklers were stunned into a sickened silence.”\n\nThe Globe and Mail reported what happened next:\n\nNewsmen at tables surrounding the stage and members of the 48th Highlanders band reached to assist Hatton, whose grey flannel suit had flown open in disarray. His glasses had fallen off and his shoulder-slung camera caught him in the kidneys as he hit the floor. An attendant opened the stunned boy’s collar. Meanwhile a crowd formed around him. One spectator shouted: “This is what happens under a Liberal government!” Before reporters could get Hatton’s name, he was whisked out of the arena into the gymnasium on the east side. As he left between a policeman and an attendant, the crowd began to boo vigorously.\n\nCaption when this photo was used in the June 8, 1957 edition of the Telegram: “Youth tumbled down stairs and struck his head on the floor. Mr. Regan looks worried as he bends to give the injured boy aid. He was examined in hospital for a head bump and released.” City of Toronto Archives, Fonds 1257, Series 1057, Item 4216.\n\nThe police slammed the door on the press. Hatton was held for 10 minutes before going to St. Michael’s Hospital for examination. Apart from a bump on the head, he was deemed to be fine and taken to his aunt’s home (his parents were out for the evening—they later referred to the incident as a “schoolboy prank”). Police Inspector Charles Bond told reporters that, because it was “politically impossible” to figure out what really happened when Hatton toppled, no charges would be laid. Bond noted that “I have never known a lad of his age to have such strong convictions. It is very unusual for a boy let alone a man to be so radically Progressive Conservative and so violently anti-Liberal in his thinking.” Had the Liberals imposed any 2011 Conservative-style blacklists for those attending party rallies, we imagine Hatton wouldn’t have been let anywhere near future Grit gatherings.\n\nBack on stage, St. Laurent gripped the lectern and waited a few minutes before resuming. “It is, of course, unfortunate that this young man fell from these steps,” he told the crowd. “I hope that those who are attempting to prevent me being heard realized that this was not the right thing for this young man to do. I am sure that this is not the way Toronto audiences usually act. I hope there are no further consequences from this unfortunate incident than this momentary disturbance.” St. Laurent carried on with his planned speech with minimal heckling.\n\nThe Telegram, June 8, 1957.\n\nReactions in the press the following day were generally negative toward the rally. Sharp criticism came from Charles King of the Ottawa Citizen, who called it “the most unnerving thing I have witnessed in six weeks of campaigning across nine provinces with both national party leaders.” King felt the show was so over the top with its slick, expensive Hollywood aspirations that “it invited demonstrations.” Hatton’s fall “ruined a night that Liberals had counted on to bolster their sagging popularity with a splash of publicity in the newspapers.” Toeing the party line, the Star downplayed the incident in favour of the colourful aspects of a rally that otherwise went well. Unlike the other Toronto papers, the Star failed to mention Hatton’s fall on the front page, which bore the headline “CHEERING LIBERALS OUTDO ALL HECKLERS RALLY LIVELIEST EVER.”\n\nHow did the Tories react? Diefenbaker joked that if anyone disagreed with his policies, he would shove them off a platform—“if they break their necks, that’s just too bad.”\n\nThree days after the rally, voters cast out the Liberals and handed Diefenbaker a minority government. St. Laurent gave the impression of barely comprehending what had happened when he gave his concession speech. Within a few months, St. Laurent was replaced as Liberal leader by Lester Pearson. The party wasn’t accustomed to being in opposition and its lingering arrogance cost it dearly in the 1958 federal election. William Hatton later became an executive for British Petroleum and landed a seat on the train that took Diefenbaker’s body from Ottawa to Saskatchewan after the Chief died in 1979.\n\nSources: Pendulum of Power by J.

Big ideas. Big government. The classic mid-century institutional appeal. St. Laurent is front and centre in this 1957 magazine ad, but the Liberals are really selling the party and the government itself: a pair of mega-institutions towering above the lowly voter.\n\nLeader as individual: The Tory 1957 campaign pitch couldn’t have been more different. As in this ad, every piece of party propaganda presented Diefenbaker’s human qualities: intelligence, intensity, passion. These qualities are sung in the third-party endorsements, a proxy for voters’ voices. Power to the People!\n\nToronto Star, April 26, 1957.\n\nThe Progressive Conservatives kicked off their campaign at Massey Hall on April 25. Beyond Diefenbaker, the rally’s key speaker was Ontario Premier Leslie Frost, patching up (pardon the pun) the frosty relations between the provincial and federal parties that had existed during George Drew’s federal leadership. Frost saw provincial power as a major issue, criticizing the Liberals for their centralization efforts.\n\nHere in our own province I can say to our people that the Progressive Conservative Party is dedicated to the development of our resources, to meeting the challenge and opportunities of this mid-part of the 20th century, to the betterment of the standard of life of our people, to the expansion of opportunities. In other words, balanced development and human betterment. We here in Ontario, as in Canada, offer to our people a party which provides every man and woman with the opportunity of serving his or her country without regard to race, creed or colour – a party which is the same everywhere, providing a political home and a political opportunity for people of every walk of life wherever they may be.\n\nToronto Star, April 26, 1957.\n\nDiefenbaker gave a 45-minute speech touching on taxation, increasing immigration to spur national development, improving pensions, and Liberal arrogance. He promised the packed house that the party was moving toward its “date with destiny.”\n\nThe Telegram, June 8, 1957.\n\nLet’s quickly check in on the other parties who ran in the 1957 election. The CCF finished third with 25 seats, 3 of which were in Ontario. This checklist is as exciting as their Toronto-area advertising got. Heart issues caused party leader M.J. Coldwell to take it easier on the campaign trail.\n\nGlobe and Mail, April 15, 1957.\n\nGiven their western base, it may seen odd that the Social Credit Party decided to kick off their national campaign in Toronto, but they hoped to displace the CCF as the third largest party in parliament. Previewing future splits in the party, party brass refused to associate with its Quebec satellite, the Union des Electeurs, calling its organixation fascist, anti-democratic, and anti-Semitic (national leader Solon Low having recently repudiated his own past anti-Semitic statements).\n\nCovering the rally, the Globe and Mail observed that:\n\nSocreds don’t campaign, they carry “the word.” And this was the tone of the rally as the party’s three major figures exhorted their audience with declarations that Social Credit’s “new vigorous, dynamic policy based on freedom and free enterprise for all” would bring about a Canadian Utopia.\n\nThe Star observed that a “sparse, middle-aged crowd of 1,800 cheered wildly the prospect of a $100-a-month old age pension but appeared unimpressed with some other planks in the Social Credit platform.”\n\nThe party never broke through in Ontario. Though they gained four seats, their 19 MPs remained the fourth-place caucus. When Diefenbaker steamrolled to his monster majority in 1958, the entire Socred caucus was wiped out.\n\nToronto Star, June 3, 1957. Click on image for larger version.\n\nSailing into the Maple Leaf Gardens rally, the Liberal promoted their front line ministers.\n\nOn rally day, a highly partisan Star editorial had this to say about “The Man Himself”:\n\nMembers of tonight’s audience who have never seen the prime minister may be wondering what to expect when he appears on the platform. If they have read the Tory propaganda, they will be surprosed and, if they have come for a show, a little disappointed. For Louis St. Laurent the man bears no relaton to the bogeyman figure conjured up by the opposition. Instead he is a vigorous, dignified man of 75, manifestly sincere in what he says and quite obviously dedicated to certain rock-bound political and personal principles. His oratory strikes no sparks, but the logic and reasonableness of his words have a compelling quality of their own.\n\nToronto Star, June 8, 1957.\n\nIn terms of pictures published of the rally, you have your “bouncing cheerleaders” shot…\n\nToronto Star, June 8, 1957.\n\n…and your whoooping-“Indians”-in-redface photo. From today’s standpoint, neither is a good look. Neither of these groups of supporters helped on election day, as Cameron and Hollingsworth were defeated by Tory candidates.\n\nThe Telegram, June 9, 1957.\n\nHatton’s account of the rally.\n\nMaclean’s, June 22, 1957.\n\nThe dangers of preparing a publication for print before election results are in: readers of Maclean’s June 22 edition may have been shocked to see an editorial written as if the Liberals had won with a comfortable majority.\n\nMaclean’s, July 6, 1957.\n\nThe editors apologized in the following issue.\n\nOriginally published on Torontoist on October 16, 2015. Numbers at the end adjusted to include the 2019 federal election.\n\nCartoon urging readers to defeat Louis St. Laurent’s Liberal government, the Globe and Mail, August 10, 1953.\n\nIn the offices of Toronto’s major dailies, editorial boards have been cracking their knuckles tapping out each paper’s official election endorsement. As this article was being written, those which have been published for the 2015 campaign have not strayed from their traditional stances: Liberal for the Star, Conservative for the Sun (which we also expect from the National Post based on other Postmedia papers), and head-scratching caveats from the Globe and Mail, a paper whose choices depend on who’s running the presses and which side of the bed the editorial board woke up on.\n\nDuring the Victorian era, endorsements were hardly necessary. Party organs pushed their backer’s platform. The Globe filled this role for the Liberals under founder George Brown, while the Conservatives bounced from paper to paper (usually the Mail) as owners developed independent streaks or were deemed useless. Feistier, populist papers like the News, Telegram, and the World supported the Conservatives, but did so on their own terms.\n\nToronto Star, November 6, 1900.\n\nOccasionally, a paper rose above the fray, determined to appear impartial by backing nobody. Having declared itself independent of the Tories prior to the 1887 election, the Mail used its editorial page to criticize hyper-partisanship in ways which are still relevant:\n\nThe party organs furnish some extremely entertaining reading just now. All agree that what the Mail says favourable to their side is correct, and all are equally of the opinion that what the Mail says against their gods is wrong. If the party press is to be believed, the sheep and the goats have already been separated. The righteous are in one political camp and the wicked in the other. This being the case, the people, it seems, have no right to enquire further into the merits of the applicants for their suffrages. They must be content with such one-sided information as they can get from the partisan press, and the journal which tells them the unvarnished truth is criminal, except, of course, when the truth it relates is pleasant to the taste.\n\nSeveral 19th-century newspaper proprietors ran for office, which affected their picks. For example, when Telegram owner, John Ross Robertson, was approached to run by Tories in Toronto East disgruntled with leader Charles Tupper in 1896, the paper backed fellow “independent Conservative” candidates.\n\nHow to fill out a ballot in Parkdale for the 1917 federal election. Graphics such as these were used by many papers to depict how they felt readers should vote. Toronto Star, December 14, 1917.\n\nWartime united all the major dailies together for the first time in 1917. Conservative Prime Minister Robert Borden’s successful overture to pro-conscription Liberals to form a Union government was viewed as a patriotic act. The degree of jingoism varied between papers, with the remaining Liberal rump depicted as an unpatriotic bunch spreading Quebec’s evil influence. The World’s endorsement gives a flowery idea of where our media stood:\n\nNo Canadian will ever be able to look another American in the face again, nor a Briton either, if the soldiers’ cause and the new government is not sustained on Monday. It is the duty of every voter to cast his ballot for that sacred resolution taken by the whole civilized world that the sword will never be sheathed until the cause for which it is unsheathed has been won. Let us stand apart from those who wait, with infamous treachery to our gallant dead, ready to sheathe the sword of Canada on Monday. Let us be a solid phalanx to stand behind our armies to give them good courage, good faith, and good cheer.\n\nUntil the 1920s, the Globe stood solidly behind the Liberals. When the Brown family sold the paper during the 1880s, the new owners understood that the Globe would be “in perpetual trust for the Liberal party to act as its mouthpiece.” This disintegrated when William Gladstone Jaffray gained control. He despised William Lyon Mackenzie King, partly because he felt our longest-serving prime minister was an opportunist who’d do anything to stay in power, and partly because King failed to push through bills banning what Jaffray saw as one of the greatest evils plaguing humanity: the publication of horse-racing results. The Globe refused to back anyone during the tight campaigns of 1925 and 1926, but returned to the Liberal fold during the Great Depression.\n\nAdvertisement for George McCullagh radio speech where he supported the Tories and attacked the Toronto Star. The Telegram, June 23, 1949.\n\nThe Globe’s lasting break with the Liberals came after George McCullagh merged it with the Conservative Mail and Empire in 1936. The new owner had a messianic complex, regarding it his personal destiny to save Canada, a worldview that didn’t mix with the federal Grits. He naively believed the country needed a non-partisan, pro-imperalist government, which citizens would unquestioningly rely on to solve all of its problems. In 1940, McCullagh’s Globe and Mail officially backed nobody, urging voters to elect MPs willing to eventually participate in a coalition government as the Second World War wore on.\n\nBy war’s end, McCullagh backed the newly renamed Progressive Conservative party. His hyper-partisanship grew after purchasing the Telegram in 1948, as did his goal to drive the Liberal Star out of business. “I’m going to knock that fucking rag right off its pedestal,” he told his staff. The 1949 federal election showed both sides at their worst, as news coverage was distorted in a partisan manner unseen for decades. McCullagh puffed up Tory leader George Drew, and attacked the Star for being a Commie rag, which allegedly dodged sales tax payments. The Star responded by depicting Drew as being in league with wartime isolationists like Montreal Mayor Camillien Houde. One headline was so over the top that Star execs scratched it for late editions. When the campaign was over, editors at all the papers agreed to exile excessive partisanship to the editorial page.\n\nDief as Nero. Cartoon by Duncan Macpherson, Toronto Star, April 6, 1963.\n\nEndorsements rolled out as usual until 1963. Prime Minister John Diefenbaker’s Progressive Conservatives were in disarray: an election the year before reduced them to a minority government, cabinet ministers fled the sinking ship, and the thin-skinned PM’s paranoia was operating at full tilt. The press’s desire to ditch Dief was so strong that, for the first time in its history, the Telegram backed the Liberals. In its March 30, 1963, editorial, the Tely declared that Diefenbaker had compromised the Progressive Conservatives’ principles so much “that Canada’s position at home and abroad will immeasurably deteriorate under his continued leadership.” The move confused longtime readers; one told columnist Douglas Fisher that the act was as if “devout Christians have had to face the fact that the Bible is a false, spurious document.” Publisher John Bassett’s decision also resulted in something that hadn’t happened since 1917: unanimous support for one party among all major Toronto dailies.\n\nBassett felt bad about the situation and sent Diefenbaker an apologetic response. Dief called him an SOB.\n\nIf the Tely’s support of the Liberals came as a shock in 1963, its rival’s turn in the opposite direction a decade later was equally stunning. The headline atop the Star’s October 19, 1972, editorial said it all: “After 50 Years—Liberals have forfeited our support.” Publisher Beland Honderich observed that the state of the Canadian economy under Pierre Trudeau was a shambles, and that poor management of foreign ownership threatened our nation’s independence. While dubious about both Progressive Conservative Leader Robert Stanfield and the NDP’s David Lewis, the Star sided with Stanfield (“an honest, sincere man”) for promising tax stimulus measures. “The easy way for a newspaper, as for a citizen, would be not to support any party in this election,” Honderich wrote. “But this is not a responsible course for a citizen in a democratic society—or for a newspaper that believes it has a responsibility to provide comment and opinions on the issues of the day.”\n\nThe Sun, covering its first election, hailed Honderich for “courage and the strength to break tradition. Canada may be better because of it.” Ironically, the Sun has never shown similar courage as federally it has never officially endorsed any party, other than the Canadian Alliance, which didn’t have “Conservative” in its name.\n\nFront page, Toronto Sun, February 3, 1980.\n\nWhile the Globe backed Trudeau in 1972, it joined the Star and Sun on Stanfield’s side in 1974. Unfortunately for Stanfield, he literally fumbled the ball during that campaign. In 1979, the Star became the first Toronto paper to back the NDP (admiring its stands on social justice), but returned to its traditional Liberal support the following year.\n\nAs the political landscape realigned itself during the 1990s, our papers seemed lost. Both the Globe and Mail and the Sun continued to support the Progressive Conservatives after the party collapsed in 1993. But reading between the lines, it’s easy to see the editorial writers at both papers really wanted to back Reform and the Canadian Alliance, but felt they weren’t quite ready to hold power—they went out of their way to show that the new right movement weren’t evil, just occasionally wrong. Conducting strategic voting on the right passed for endorsements.\n\nCartoon of Jean Chretien by Theo Moudakis, Toronto Star, November 25, 2000.\n\nFor elections where editorial writers united in feeling “meh” about the choices at hand, it’s hard to top the 2000 campaign. All endorsements came with heavy caveats. The Globe and Mail backed the Liberals as long as the party dumped Jean Chrétien in favour of Paul Martin ASAP. The Star, disappointed by a divisive campaign where none of the leaders impressed them, reluctantly stuck by the Grits; while Chretien was “an impediment to the renewal that Canadians seek,” the party “provided competent government and reflect the values Canadians cherish.” Though the Sun despised the Chrétien government, it believed Stockwell Day’s Canadian Alliance still wasn’t ready for prime time. It recommended right-wing strategic voting, backing whichever Canadian Alliance or Progressive Conservative candidates had the best chance of knocking off Liberals. Sun editor Lorrie Goldstein offered a list of 50 reasons voters should choose the “ABC” route: Anybody But Chretien.\n\nInternal fissures were evident in the National Post, which was covering its first election. While columnists like Andrew Coyne, David Frum, and Mark Steyn favoured the Canadian Alliance, the paper officially endorsed a Liberal minority, while owner Izzy Asper penned a separate editorial promoting a Grit majority. The Post hoped that the NDP would lose their official party status “and one hopes their will to survive might go with it.” In the following elections, the Post lined up behind Stephen Harper.\n\nRecent years have seen little deviation from traditional party lines, with the exception of the Star’s backing of the NDP in 2011. Sticking with the known has raised hackles among readers, especially when choices don’t mesh with public opinion. How much they still matter is debatable, but they offer an opportunity to argue about the role of the media in politics.\n\nAfter having gone through nearly 150 years of election coverage, we’ve compiled stats on endorsements in Toronto’s major papers:\n\nGlobe/Globe and Mail\n\nElections: 43 (1867-present)\n\nLiberal: 20; Conservative/Progressive Conservative: 17.5, Nobody: 4; Unionist: 1, Reform: 0.5\n\nEndorsements realized: 21\n\nMail/Mail and Empire\n\nElections: 17 (1872-1935)\n\nConservative: 14; Nobody: 2; Unionist: 1\n\nEndorsements realized: 6\n\nTelegram\n\nElections: 25 (1878-1968)\n\nConservative/Progressive Conservative: 23; Liberal: 1; Unionist: 1\n\nEndorsements realized: 11\n\nNews\n\nElections: 9 (1882-1917)\n\nConservative: 6; Nobody: 2; Unionist: 1\n\nEndorsements realized: 4\n\nWorld\n\nElections: 9 (1882-1917)\n\nConservative: 8; Unionist: 1\n\nEndorsements realized: 5\n\nToronto Star\n\nElections: 36 (1896-present)\n\nLiberal: 31; Conservative/Progressive Conservative: 2; NDP: 2; Unionist: 1\n\nEndorsements realized: 21\n\nToronto Sun\n\nElections: 15 (1972-present)\n\nConservative/Progressive Conservative: 14.5; Canadian Alliance: 0.5\n\nEndorsements realized:6\n\nNational Post\n\nElections: 7 (2000-present)\n\nConservative: 6; Liberal: 1\n\nEndorsements realized: 4\n\nAdditional material from Scrum Wars by Allan Levine (Toronto: Dundurn, 1993); the February 7, 1887, edition of the Mail; the November 27, 2000, edition of the National Post; the October 19, 1972, May 21, 1979, and November 25, 2000, editions of the Toronto Star; the October 20, 1972, and November 26, 2000, editions of the Toronto Sun; the March 30, 1963, edition of the Telegram; and the December 15, 1917, edition of the Toronto World.\n\nOriginally published on Torontoist on April 19, 2011.\n\nDon Mills Mirror, June 6, 1957.\n\nIf you think we’ve headed to the polls one too many times to elect a federal government over the past decade, then you’ll feel a twinge of sympathy for the average Canadian voter who had the opportunity to exercise his or her democratic privilege five times between 1957 and 1965.\n\nThe unifying figure through all of those elections was Progressive Conservative leader John Diefenbaker and his roller-coaster ride of popularity. Running alongside him: a Metro Toronto candidate whose fortunes mirrored those of Dief the Chief.\n\nAnd so, a chronicle of five elections in five election ads…\n\n1957: Frank McGee had politics in his blood. One grandfather served as an MP for eight years, while another was the longest serving Clerk of the Privy Council in Canadian history. His great uncle was assassinated Father of Confederation D’Arcy McGee. His father-in-law was Senator Grattan O’Leary. Shortly before his 32nd birthday, department store merchandise buyer McGee was chosen to carry the Progressive Conservative banner in York-Scarborough. During the February 25 nomination meeting, McGee promised to hold Liberal incumbent Frank Enfield accountable on the government’s role in the pipeline debate and the Suez crisis. The vigour of the national Tory campaign, as opposed to the stay-the-course mode the Liberals adopted, must have left an impression on York-Scarborough voters, as McGee received the largest personal majority in the country on June 10 (just under 20,000 votes more than Enfield).\n\nDon Mills Mirror, June 13, 1957.\n\nOf the 18 seats in Metro Toronto, the Tories captured all but one (rookie Liberal Stanley Haidasz won Trinity). Twenty-two years of Liberal rule was replaced with a Diefenbaker-headed minority government.\n\nDon Mills Mirror, March 13, 1958.\n\n1958: McGee and Diefenbaker experienced a record-breaking election night. When the ballots were counted on March 31, the Tories captured a record number of seats—with 208 seats out of 265, they still hold the federal record for the highest seat percentage in an election. Every seat in Metro Toronto went blue. York-Scarborough voters did their part by giving McGee the largest majority ever received up to that time in a single riding as he defeated Enfield by 35,377 votes (the current record holder is Vaughan Mayor Maurizio Bevilacqua, who crushed his closest opponent in York North by 51,389 votes in 1993). During the 24th Parliament, McGee introduced a private member’s bill to abolish capital punishment. Though McGee’s proposal met the fate usually meted out to such bills, it helped pave the way for the eventual abolition of the death penalty.\n\nToronto Star, June 13, 1962.\n\n1962: It didn’t take long for internal squabbling and Diefenbaker`s penchant for nursing grudges to cause rancor within the Tories. As John Duffy summed up in his book Fights of Our Lives, by 1962 “John Diefenbaker was already the doomed Tory hero, wrapped in a Union Jack and battling alone against the dragons of Americanization, big business, and technology itself.” Diefenbaker’s government was reduced to a minority, thanks to a resurgent Liberal party and the success of Social Credit in Quebec. Of the 20 candidates shown in this ad, only McGee and six others headed to Ottawa to take their place in Diefenbaker’s minority government. Our man’s margin of victory dropped to just over 5,000 votes over the resurgent Liberals. In the short-lived session that followed, McGee served as parliamentary secretary to the minister of citizenship and immigration.\n\nDon Mills Mirror, April 3, 1963.\n\n1963: Shortly before Diefenbaker’s minority government fell amid disarray over nuclear defence policy, McGee was made a minister without portfolio. By this point, he was campaigning on his own merits without comparisons to Diefenbaker. Voters decided that McGee wasn’t a good enough MP as he lost to Liberal Maurice Moreau by 21,500 votes. He wasn’t the only Tory out of a job; Diefenbaker lost the reins of power to Lester Pearson. Following his defeat, McGee became a political columnist covering the Conservative point of view for the Toronto Star and hosted a public affairs program on CBC Television.\n\nDon Mills Mirror, October 27, 1965.\n\n1965: When another election loomed, McGee left his media gigs in an attempt to regain his old seat. There’s no mention of Diefenbaker in McGee’s ad, which may reflect the ever-increasing animosity within the party toward the former PM. Local officials blamed Diefenbaker for turning local voters away from McGee, who was tied with Liberal Robert Stanbury for a time before losing by just under 4,000 votes. Still, it was a slight improvement on McGee’s performance in ’63, just as the Tories modestly upped their standing in the House of Commons by a couple of seats.\n\nMcGee came oh-so-close to returning to office during his final political run in the suburban riding of Ontario (which included parts of present-day Durham Region stretching from Pickering to Uxbridge) in 1972, but lost to the Liberals by four votes in a recount. Before his death in 1999, McGee also served as an executive at a public relations firm, a member of the Security Intelligence Review Committee, and a citizenship judge in Toronto.\n\nAdditional material from Fights of Our Lives by John Duffy (Toronto: HarperCollins, 2002), the November 10, 1965, edition of the Don Mills Mirror, and the February 26, 1957, edition of the Toronto Star."
