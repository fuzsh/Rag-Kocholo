If one of your requests has been moved here by mistake, please accept our apologies and undo the archiving edit to the peer review page for the article.\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because I would like to know how to further improve it. The style and reception sections will probably need the most looking at. I would eventually like to nominate it at GAN and then FAC. Thanks, Kaguya-chan (talk)\n\nBrianboulton comments: Because I am pressed for time at the moment, I have confined myself to comments on the lead and \"Plot\" section.\n\nLead\n\nThe lead must specify name of publisher and date of publication.\n\nOverlinking: \"widow\", \"domestic servant\" (possibly other terms throughout article)\n\n\"a common bond\" sits oddly in the list of \"similar situations\". The common bond between the two women is that they have shared experiences - abuse, loneliness etc\n\nThe word \"descendant\" is generally used for several generations down the line. I would not call my children my \"descendents\", or if I had any, my grandchildren, any more than they would call me their ancestor. Perhaps \"dependents\" would be a beter choice of word.\n\n\"the social class in India\" - delete \"the\"\n\n\"and whom Umrigar had much admiration for\" → \"and for whom Umrigar had much admiration\".\n\nAs the setting is modern India, why \"Bombay\" not Mumbai?\n\nPlot\n\nThis section is weak at present, difficult to follow if you don't know the book. I found the summary rather confusing, with a lot of awkwardness in the prose. Here are a few examples of problems:-\n\n\"six-five\" → \"sixty-five\" (or 65)\n\n\"after getting into a work-related accident which caused him to lose three fingers\" Clumsy. Try: \"after a work-related accident caused him to lose three fingers...\"\n\nMore awkwardness in prose and punctuation: \"Her other child, Pooja married, only to die of AIDS along with her husband, and orphaned Maya at a young age.\" Perhaps \"Her daughter Pooja had married, but had died of AIDS together with her husband, leaving Maya an orphan at a young age\"\n\n\"Meanwhile\" is superfluous, as is \"own\" in \"her own physically abusive husband\"\n\nIs \"Sera\" the same person as \"Serabai\"? If so, use one form of the name. But this sentence is at present very difficult to follow: \"abusively forced her superstitions about menstruation on her\" needs more clarity. Then, \"tends to her pregnant daughter Dinaz while she pays for Maya's abortion\" - is a very awkward combination of two distinct events.\n\nWhat does the reference to the balloon seller mean?\n\nOne general point: the book itself should not be listed among the references.\n\nBrianboulton (talk)\n\nThank you for taking the time to look over the article. Your comments are appreciated. Kaguya-chan (talk)\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because…this has been a GA for a while, and I'm playing with the idea of taking it to FAC. An overall eye for horsey jargon would be appreciated, as well as a feeling for comprehensiveness. This article is shorter than the ones that I generally take to FAC, so I'm wondering if there are any holes that I'm missing. Also, comments on whether I've focused too much on a few refs - although there's really not that much out there on this breed. Thanks in advance, Dana boomer (talk)\n\nRuhrfisch comments: Thanks for your work on yet another interesting horse article, here are some nit-picky suggestions for improvement. I think this is nearly ready for FAC.\n\nThe lead says The American Cream Draft is a rare draft horse breed, the only such breed developed in the United States. but the body of the article qualifies that statement as The American Cream is the only breed of draft horse developed in the United States that is still in existence today.[4] The led makes it sounds as if this the only draft horse breed ever developed in the US, the body seems to say it is one of several such breeds developed, though the only one still in existence.\n\nTweaked.\n\nBy the way, it might be useful to mention the other extinct breeds (assume there are not many, if there are many name a few). Also if the date of extinction of the last other breed is known, that would be useful to include (so something like \"The American Cream is the only breed of draft horse developed in the United States that is still in existence; the X BREED went extinct in YEAR.\") Not great, but gives you an idea hopefully\n\nI understand your point, but I honestly don't know what other breeds the source is discussing. They could be meaning the draft types that were prominent in early America, but these were more styles than actual breeds. Or there could have been some smaller breeds that died out in the early to mid 20th century as mechanization became more prominent.\n\nProblem with conversion Mares stand 15 to 16 hands (60 to 64 inches, 152 to 163 cm) high and weigh 1,500 to 1,600 pounds (680 to 730 kg), while stallions and geldings stand 16 to 16.3 hands (64 to 67 inches, 163 to 170 cm) for mares 1 hand difference is 4 inches (60 to 64), for the stallons 0.3 hands difference is 3 inches (64 to 67).\n\nActually, the conversion is correct. A hand is four inches (it's linked by the conversion template used), and to count portions of hands you use .# of inches. So, 14.0, 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 15, etc.\n\nI would briefly explain or link foundation stock in A cream mare with dark skin and a light mane and tail can be accepted for \"foundation stock,\" while ...\n\nDone.\n\nIs this an error? Purebred American Cream foals that are too dark are accepted into the main breed registry may be recorded into an appendix registry.[4] If they are too dark how are they accepted in the main breed registry?\n\nThat was supposed to be \"to be accepted\". Fixed.\n\nAvoid vague time terms like current Based on current knowledge, [the?] breed also does not carry the cream gene, even though breeders refer to the desired color as \"cream\".[6] Since the source cited is from 2003, I would use that year to define the knowledge.\n\nFixed.\n\nShouldn't the verb eb plural (are produced, not is produced)? ...and the gold champagne body color, ivory mane and tail, light skin and light eyes associated with the American Cream Draft is produced by the action of the champagne gene on a chestnut base coat.[11][12]\n\nFixed\n\nLink foal on earlier first use and why is it capitalized here? The eyes of champagne Foals are blue at birth, darkening as they age, and a foal's skin is bright pink.[14]\n\nFixed.\n\nAny way to avoid \"map[ping] the gene\" twice in one sentence? The mapping of the gene was announced in 2008, and an American Cream Draft Cross was one of the animals used to help map the gene.[16]\n\nFixed.\n\nTweak The breed descends from a foundation mare named Old Granny, who [which?] was probably foaled between 1900 and 1905. She was first noticed at an auction in Story County, Iowa in 1911 and purchased by Harry Lakin, a well known stock dealer.[5]\n\nI think that \"who\" is correct in this instance. \"Which\" sounds to me like an object, rather than an animal.\n\nI assume the breeding program mentioned in the last sentence is specific to Colonial Williamsburg In the villiage they are used for wagon and carriage rides, and there is breeding program there that is working to increase breed numbers.[21] If so, it would help to say so, as breeding programs to increase numbers have already been mentioned.\n\nFixed.\n\nRefs used look OK to me and there does not seem to be an over-reliance on any one source.\n\nImages are also fine (though I did not check all)\n\nPlease make sure that the existing text includes no copyright violations, plagiarism, or close paraphrasing.

Dana is correct on the conversion and we can't seem to find any other draft breeds developed in the US, most stuff here other than the American Cream is, at best, crossbreds from stock of the European breeds. To the extent some American-developed breeds had workhorse uses, they were the all-purpose breeds like the \"foundation type\" Morgan, which is not at all a draft-type animal, just a sturdy one.

GeeJo (t)⁄(c) •\n\nFinetooth comments: Thanks for your work on this interesting article about an especially clever ad. I remember finding the ad especially entertaining the first time I saw it (or bits of it online). Here are a few suggestions for further improvement.\n\nSequence\n\n\"On the other end of the seesaw is a 12 V battery.\" - Should \"volt\" be spelled out? Can the viewer really tell for sure that it's a 12-volt battery, or is that an assumption? Would \"car battery\" be better?\n\nBackground\n\n\"The stated goal of the campaign was to increase Honda's share of the UK market to 5% within three years and to change the public image of the brand to from dull but functional to warm and consumer-friendly, all on a lower marketing budget than their predecessors had demanded.\" - Two things: (1) \"Percent\" or \"per cent\" is preferred to % in simple cases like this. (2) The \"to from\" combination appears to be a typo. Probably this should read \"... change the public image of the brand from dull but functional to warm and consumer friendly.\"\n\nLink \"strapline\" to Advertising slogan? I had never heard of \"strapline\", although I could guess at its meaning from the context.\n\nPre-production\n\n\"Approval for the script took another month, with Honda requesting several specific features of the Accord appear in the final cut... \" - Insert \"that\" between \"requesting\" and \"several\"?\n\n\"Approval for the script took another month, with Honda requesting several specific features of the Accord appear in the final cut, such as a door with a wing-mirror indicator and a rain-sensitive windscreen, as the company were looking to highlight these features in sales brochures. - On the other hand, it might be better to recast the whole sentence since the \"with plus -ing\" construction is somewhat awkward, and the sentence seems a bit too complicated. Maybe: \"Approval for the script took another month. Honda insisted that several specific Accord features, such as a door with a wing-mirror indicator and a rain-sensitive windscreen, appear in the final cut. The company planned to highlight these features in sales brochures.\" Or something like that.\n\nDo \"direct\" and \"music videos\" need to be linked. Most readers already know what they mean, I think.\n\nProduction\n\n\"during the moment when the muffler rolls across the floor.[18]) - I think the ref number should come after the end parentheses rather than before.\n\n\"The Accord shown at the end of Cog was, at the time, one of only six hand-assembled models in the world... \" - This is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean \"car models\" rather than models of any sort? Does it mean \"Accord models\"?\n\n\"Flame artist Barnsley (aka Andrew Wood[20]),\" - Here I'd move the ref number to right after the comma.\n\nPost-production\n\n\"Even so, the constant movement of parts on-camera meant that there were no good lighting references to work from when the time came to stitch the two 60-second shots into a single seamless piece.\" - It won't be clear to most readers what a \"good lighting reference\" means. Could the technical importance of a lighting reference be briefly explained, maybe in a note if adding it to the main text damages the prose flow?\n\nSchedule\n\n\"The full 120-second version of the advertisement aired only ten times in all, and only in the ten days after the initial screening.\" - Generally, numbers larger than nine appear as digits. Maybe \"10 times\" and \"10 days\"?\n\nLinking \"remote control\", \"documentary\", \"brochure\", and \"music video\" seems unnecessary.\n\n\"Sales of Honda vehicles in the United Kingdom jumped by 28%... \" - I'd recommend \"percent\" or \"per cent\".\n\nAwards\n\nThe collapsing list might be better at the bottom of the article. I would think about a horizontal, non-collapsing format and about checking WP:FA for models of how this might be done.\n\n\"It receiving more awards than any commercial in history;\" - Should that be \"received\"?\n\n\"with the jury's chairman Charles Inge commenting\" - Generally, it's best to recast the \"with plus -ing\" constructions. \"With\" isn't a conjunction.\n\n\"tradition holds that it is bad form for the chairman of the jury to vote for a piece by his own agency.\" - Since the chair could in some cases be a woman, should this be recast to remain gender-neutral? Maybe: \"tradition holds that it is bad form for the chairperson of the jury to vote for a piece by his or her own agency.\"\n\nIn advertising\n\n\"an 30-second animated advertisement for Heinz Tomato Ketchup\" - Shouldn't this be \"a\" rather than \"an\"?\n\nOther\n\nI count 20 red links in the article, which is quite a lot. Generally, before heading to FAC with something, I try to create articles for the red links, partly to avoid trouble but mainly to expand the encyclopedia. The total of 20 can be quickly pared down somewhat by eliminating duplicate red links. For example, Sense is redlinked in three places.\n\nThe link checker tool at the top of this review page finds one dead URL in the citations. It's in citation 52.\n\nTo citation 76, you might add \"registration required\".\n\nPlease make sure that the existing text includes no copyright violations, plagiarism, or close paraphrasing.

There are many FA political biographies at Wikipedia:Featured_articles#Politics_and_government_biographies which should have some useful model articles.\n\nThe lead does not really follow WP:LEAD. It should be an accessible and inviting overview of the whole article, and as such nothing important should be in the lead only - since it is a summary, it should all be repeated in the body of the article itself. However the fact that he was one of the 23 victims of the regime's Massacre of 1951 is only in the lead.\n\nFor expansion ideas, my rule of thumb is to include every header in the lead in some way\n\nThe article leaves me with more questions than answers. What did his company do? WHy did the regime arrest him? What is the background of the massacre? Why was he singled out as one of the victims?\n\nA good rule to remember is provide context to the reader - my guess is that readers from Albania will know much more about the massacre, but the general reader needs some background and context.\n\nThe image File:Junuz Kaceli.png has to specify the source - where did the photo come from? It cannot be PD if the source etc are not specified (and even then I assume it is WP:FAIR USE as I imagine the image is still under copyright)\n\nInternet refs need URL, title, author if known, publisher and date accessed. {{cite web}} and other cite templates may be helpful. See WP:CITE and WP:V\n\nLots of little typos. June is the ENglish spelling (not Juni). He received the death penalty, not the \"dead penalty\" - this needs a copyedit.\n\nNot much else to say as it is so short an article\n\nPlease make sure that the existing text includes no copyright violations, plagiarism, or close paraphrasing.

Thanks, morelMWilliam\n\nReview\n\nThis looks like an interesting film, but I think more can be done with the article. Here are some suggestions:\n\nNeeds a copyedit for prose and WP:MOS problems. Perhaps someone at the WP:Guild of Copyeditors can help.\n\nEach of the sections can do with more expansion. Here is a sampling of information that should be incorporated. Perhaps somebody of Wikiproject Films could help with finding industry sources:\n\nDo you know the shooting schedule?\n\nHow long did it take to shoot the film?\n\nWas the film set primarily outdoors, or were indoor scenes shot in a studio or someplace?\n\nWhat did it cost to make the film? How much money did the film earn?\n\nThe cast section should be more that a bulleted list. Depending on what the sources tell you, try to fill information about the cast in relation to the film. For example:\n\nHow did the actors become involved?\n\nDid the director want specific actors?\n\nThe \"screening\" should also be more than a bulleted list. Do any of the sources give reactions or post-screening reviews of the film?\n\nThe critical reception section isn't too bad. The link to the Arizona Reporter should be reformatted to link in the references section, and the names of magazines and newspapers should be in italics.\n\nThe Awards section needs to be tidied.\n\nThe article needs a themes and maybe style section. What are the themes in the film? Does the filmmaker use a specific style?\n\nUse the toolbox at the top of the page to identify links to be disambiguated, and fix.\n\nI don't know a lot about film articles, but I'd suggest having a look at other articles about films that are featured articles, found here.\n\nI hope this is helpful. Thanks. Truthkeeper88 (talk)\n\nComments\n\nThanks for your time, Truthkeeper88.

Since he is a living person it is theoretically possible to obtain a free image of him, so Wikipedia policy is not to allow fair use images of such people.\n\nI see this article was failed at WP:GAN with the comment Oh this is very bad, spelling and grammar mistakes throughout. Please get this copy-edited. Then it had a peer review without a copyedit. The first peer review said in part Your lack of activity means that a PR review is likely to highlight exactly the same issues as arose in the GA review.\n\nReview processes like GAN and PR identify problems with articles, but are not usually places where such problems are fixed. Reviewers are almost always in short supply and do not have time to fix the problems, just point them out for the nominator to fix them. Having reviewed quite a few articles you have nominated at PR, I can say that poor grammar and spelling is a consistent problem in those articles. The problem is that a reviewer reads such articles and cannot get past the poor grammar to other problems.\n\nThat said here are a few issues I noticed. The first sentence does not follow WP:LEAD which says in part The article should begin with a declarative sentence telling the nonspecialist reader what (or who) is the subject. Since this man is best known as Selena's father that should be in the first sentence.\n\nThe italicized Abraham in the first sentence does not follow WP:ITALIC\n\nIn the second sentence, why is past yense (was) used? Since the man is still alive, it should be is.\n\nYet another problem sentence: Abraham is mostly known as the father of Selena, whose passion for music arose in his teens when he joined the group Los Dinos (English: The Guys) in the 1950s[3]. Here \"whose\" seems to refer to Selena (the noun right before it), but the phrase refers to her father.\n\nPer WP:CITE references come AFTER punctuation, and are usually at the end of a sentence or phrase\n\nLots of spelling errors and odd word choices - \"decent\" is used where \"descent\" is meant\n\nArticle just does not make logical sense in places - for example in the lead two sentences in a row say Abraham quit the band in the early 1970s to support his family.[9] During the mid-1970s, while trying desperately to leave the music world... WHich is it it - did he quit the band in the early 1970s, or was he still trying to leave music in the mid-1970s?\n\nOr what is the middle number of six? ...the middle child of six siblings...\n\nOr a choir with only three members? raham attended Ray Miller High School and soon joined with two of his friends to form a high school choir called the Gumdrops\n\nPlease make sure that the existing text includes no copyright violations, plagiarism, or close paraphrasing.

Its recently had a copyedit but as FAC is very stringent I feel a peer review beforehand would help improve the article to the standard required. Thanks, NapHit (talk)\n\nRuhrfisch comments: Thanks for your work on this - I enjoyed reading it and it looks pretty good to me, here are some suggestions for improvement - mostly nitpicks, and a few places where citations are needed.\n\nLead\n\nSince the stadium is mostly known as the home of Liverpool FC, I think I would include that in the first sentence.\n\nTighten The ground is due to host matches during the 2015 Rugby World Cup, with pool matches taking place at the stadium. to just The ground is due to host pool matches during the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\n\nWhen I first read this sentence I was not sure what these four were - could this sentence make it clearer that they are stands? Perhaps something like Over the course of its history the stadium has gone through various stages of renovation and development, resulting in the current configuration of [four stands:] the Spion Kop, Main Stand, Centenary Stand, and Anfield Road.\n\nMore tightening Notable features of the stadium include two gates named after former Liverpool managers: the Bob Paisley gate and the Bill Shankly gate.\n\nIn the lead I would put the distance from the train station in the same paragraph with the public transit information - currently they are in two separate paragraphs.\n\nI would start the third paragraph of the lead with the year of the initial plans. I would also mention the changes in ownership of the club as these seem to be involved in the changes in plans.\n\nThe infobox says the surface is grass, but the article does not repeat this.\n\nHistory\n\nAny idea of how much the land / stadium cost originally? Or what exactly the facilities were like when it opened? Perhaps include the etymology of Anfield?\n\nMOS says just Houlding in Everton's landlord changed when John Houlding purchased the land from Orrell in 1885, charging direct rent.\n\nIs Mr. Orrell of the first paragraph the same as John Orrell in the second? If so, why not call him John Orrell on first use?\n\nWhen was the topmast of the Great Eastern added (year)? SInce the ship was broken up in 1889 or so, the chronology confuses me (unless the topmast was in the shipyard for decades before moving to the Kop).\n\nI would give the year in this sentence Floodlights were installed at a cost of £12,000. and just say on 30 October of that year in the next sentence.\n\nI would add that this was adopted during Shankly's time as manager in Across the Shankly Gates are the words You'll Never Walk Alone, the title of the hit song by Gerry & The Pacemakers adopted by Liverpool fans as the club's anthem.[14]\n\nI would make the Liverpool connection to the Hillsborough disaster clearer - this is done nicely for the Kop. I realize most British readers will know this already, but I had to follow the link to find out what exactly it involved.\n\nHistory section is pretty long - could it be split into two or perhaps three subsections?\n\nStructures and facilities\n\nCould File:Anfield outline.svg be color coded so that the 4 different stands are clearer - the labels are too small to read as it is in the article. If colors can't be added, the caption should make it clearer (top, left, right, bottom)\n\nWP:MOSIMAGE says not to sandwich text between two images but the outline diagram and image of the Kop sandwich the text. Since Future and Other uses have no images, could one of the images from this section be moved down - the Kop is described as being unrivaled in the Future section, so could the Kop image be moved there and the caption tweaked? Or could a {{Doubleimage}} template be used?\n\nCan the Reduc@te centre either be linked or briefly explained?\n\nMake clearer that Shankly was Scottish so this make sense The Shankly Gates, in tribute of Bill Shankly, Paisley's predecessor between 1959 and 1974, are at the Anfield Road end. Their design includes a Scottish flag, a Scottish thistle, the Liverpool badge, and the words \"You'll Never Walk Alone\".[30]\n\nFuture\n\nTweak ter attending a number of games at Anfield, Henry stated that \"the Kop is unrivaled\", and \"it would be hard to replicate that feeling anywhere else.\"[40] to ...unrivaled\", adding \"it would be hard to replicate that feeling anywhere else.\"[40]\n\nOther uses\n\nNeeds a ref Wales have staged three matches at Anfield—against Scotland in 1977, Italy in 1998, and Denmark in 1999.\n\nIndicate who won or lost? on 12 June 1934 Nelson Tarleton [lost a bout?] fought for the World Featherweight title against Freddie Miller\n\nWhen was this Professional tennis was played at Anfield on boards on the pitch. US Open champion, Bill Tilden, and Wimbledon champion, Fred Perry, entertained the crowds in an exhibition match.\n\nAny reason not to have these events more in chronological order (at least within a paragraph)?\n\nRecords\n\nNeeds a ref or two - The highest average attendance at Anfield over a league season was 48,127, set in the 1972–73 season. The lowest average attendance at Anfield was 29,608, set in the 1960–61 season, whilst the team was in the Second Division. The highest total seasonal attendance was recorded during the 2000–01 season, when the aggregate was 1,328,482. Also some FAC editors do not like \"whilst\" (I find it charming, though very British)\n\nGeneral\n\nI would try to make captions more descriptive - I think many readers look at the pictures and read the captions first, so explaining a bit more helps.\n\nPlease make sure that the existing text includes no copyright violations, plagiarism, or close paraphrasing.

Yours, Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nLevin was, in my view, technically and aesthetically the finest writer of English since Wodehouse (of whom he was a great admirer) as well as an idealistic journalist, a champion of individual freedom and implacably hostile to tyranny, whether of the left or right wing kind. There is no printed biography of him (nor, I suspect, any imminent prospect of one) and in overhauling this article I have been reliant entirely on online resources and Levin's own books. I don't, therefore, suppose that this article can be got up to FA standard, but I hope it might be possible to get it to GA. Any comments on the content and the prose will be gratefully received. Tim riley (talk)\n\nSsilvers comments: From a quick look at it, I wonder if you can break up the long section called The Times into two sections? -- Ssilvers (talk)\n\nDone. Thank you for that. Tim riley (talk)\n\nBrianboulton comments: I shall enjoy reading this at leisure, later today or tomorrow. Just one comment, meanwhile: I think the first sentence needs a stronger summary characterisation of Levin, rather than the bald facts of \"English journalist, author and broadcaster\". He was a lot more interesting than that. Brianboulton (talk)\n\nDone, I think, but happy to be steered towards other additions. Tim riley (talk)\n\nMore BB comments: As anticipated, I really enjoyed this. I read a lot of Levin, and though I was never a particular admirer, particularly in his later manifestations, he could be extremely funny, though cruel at times. Here are some areas for consideration:-\n\n\"Levin hoped to go to the University of Cambridge, but, as his obituarist in The Times wrote, he \"was not considered Oxbridge material\".[9] Instead, he enrolled at the London School of Economics (LSE), where he studied from 1948 to 1952.[1]\" These two sentences, as presently written, give the unaware reader a very odd idea about how the English higher education system works, or worked. You need to reword; I suggest you at least indicate who it was that didn't consider him Oxbridge material, (and incidentally explain what \"Oxbridge\" means), and replace \"Instead, he enrolled at...\" with \"However, he was accepted by...\" or some such wording that doesn't suggest that LSE is somewhere you can just enrol at.\n\nI can't do much with the first bit: that's all the source says. My guess would be that as admission to Oxbridge in those days was more by Establishment contacts than nowadays Macnutt and/or the Cambridge authorities earmarked Levin as \"Not One Of Us\", but I can't support that with a citation. I've redrawn the bit about getting into the LSE and blue-linked Oxbridge. – Tim riley (talk)\n\n\"From...to...\" is a normal construction, but I am less sure about \"From...to...to...\", which reads very awkwardly. See the sentence beginning \"He wrote on a wide range of subjects...\"\n\nI rather like it, but have redrawn. – Tim riley (talk)\n\nIn the same paragraph, it would help to explain that Gilmour remained the Spectator's proprietor after he relinquished the editorship.\n\nYes. I wondered about that when writing it, and am happy to add it for clarity. – Tim riley (talk)\n\nSome referencing has been overlooked. See, for example, first paragraph of \"The Spectator\" section and third para of \"Television and The Pendulum Years\" section\n\nDone (I think) – Tim riley (talk)\n\n\"He compiled his own [index] for this book\" - can you clarify which book (last title mentioned was Chatterley)?\n\nDone. – Tim riley (talk)\n\n\"Music was a frequent theme, not only Wagner...\" You have mentioned Wagner once before, briefly, in a list of topics that Levin wrote on, but haven't indicated that Levin wrote copiously and frequently on Wagner, so as to justify the phrase \"not only Wagner\". I think this aspect of his work needs a little more fleshing-out; he was devoted to Wagner's music to the point of obsession, or so it seemed.\n\nGood point. I've added a bit. – Tim riley (talk)\n\nWhy is the number of words in Levin's Shakespeare paragraph significant?\n\nRedrawn. – Tim riley (talk)\n\nPolitics: you mention Levin's early enthusiasm for Marxism, and indicate his general sympathy for Labour and the left at least until the early 1970s. You don't mention the distinctly right-wing slant he took from the mid 1970s; I remember articles and TV appearances in the late 1970s or early 1980s, in which he lauded aspects of Thatcherism and derided the left. At the time I placed him firmly in that group of journalists (Paul Johnson was an even more outstanding example) who crossed from the left to the right under the baleful spell of That Woman. But I also remember that when Tony Blair became leader of the Labour Party in 1994 Levin, in one of his later articles, hailed him as the hope of the future. So much for that, but I would like to see in the article a more detailed reflection of Levin's political journey, whatever form it took.\n\nDone. I think you will like the Levin quote I have added. – Tim riley (talk)\n\nCBE: I am regularly called to account by knowledgeable people for writing that so and so was \"awarded\" a CBE etc. I am informed that CBEs are appointed. (See elegant wording in Ferrier article).\n\nIt takes all sorts! I suppose, as Fowler said, \"my pedantry is your scholarship, his reasonable accuracy, her irreducible minimum of education and someone else’s ignorance\" – he said nothing of lunatic obsessions, but we must be all-embracing and I have redrawn. – Tim riley (talk)\n\nThat's really all I have. It's certainly within range of GA and with a little more research could, I believe, make the top rank. Brianboulton (talk)\n\nMany thanks for these points. All very much ad rem. I think I'll keep my sights on GA. The absence of a proper biographical book makes me feel FA would be not quite the thing. – Tim riley (talk)\n\nWell, I got C. R. M. F. Cruttwell through FAC on little more than Evelyn Waugh's harassment of the poor sod, and on that basis I'd say that there is plenty of material on Levin, but perhaps you are less of a chancer than I am. Brianboulton (talk)\n\nGuillaume Tell comments: I've just had a brief glance through and wonder if there could be a bit more on Conducted Tour than just note 11. In particular, The Year of the Missing Lemon Juice - please try not to fall off your chair laughing - deserves a mention and perhaps a quote, IMO. I've got a copy somewhere if you need page numbers. --GuillaumeTell\n\nLead me not into temptation! I have all Levin's books except the Shakespeare and Utopia ones, and in particular I've long had the entire Vestale episode transcribed in my commonplace book, and would love to quote it, but I can't think how to do so effectively. As Simon Hoggart said, \"It's hard to quote Levin, since his pieces depended on a long build-up, beginning with the simple and even the banal, ending with an assault which could make you come close to doubling up with laughter\". I'd be happy to include a sample if you can home in on a bite-size chunk, though. Tim riley (talk)\n\nComments: An interesting article! It feels as if I'm nit-picking but I would recommend the following minor alterations:\n\nWith your block quote \"Until then sketch writers ...\", I would use Template:Quote or something similar, as you have to include the attribution after the quote.\n\nYou have used semicolons in a liberal way, (e.g., \"...prosecuted for criminal libel;\"), but I think colons are more correct. Ignore this if you know better!\n\nBritish Empire, not empire.\n\nMany of your quotations are cited - I would write \"...gfngn fgfngm\".[1] and not \"...gfngn fgfngm.\"[1] --Amitchell125 (talk)\n\nSome very interesting and helpful points there – thank you! I have dealt with the third and fourth points, will ponder the first (terra incognita to me) and will comb through to see if any semicolons ought to be colons – I hope not, but we shall see. Many thanks for your suggestions. – Tim riley (talk)\n\nComments by Wehwalt\n\nI am forced by circumstances (exhaustion) only to do part of this tonight, and a small part at that. What I have seen looks quite good, but I have a few comments:\n\nLede\n\n\"The Times as \"the most famous journalist of his day\". \" Ultimately it is editorial judgment but I would say that I'd rather have a fact than an opinion so early in the lede. I suggest stating something outstanding Levin did.\n\nI'll look something up on those lines and substitute. – Tim riley (talk)\n\nPerhaps combine the two small paragraphs?\n\nDone – Tim riley (talk)\n\nEarly years\n\n\"The father abandoned the family when Levin\" I suggest \"Philip Levin abandoned his family when his son ...\"\n\nDone – Tim riley (talk)\n\n\" were still children.\" Can you be more specific? Because right now it is just stating the obvious.\n\nDone – Tim riley (talk)\n\n\"Kreisler or Heifetz\" This will be easier in the reader if you use the word \"violin\" before mentioning these virtuosos.\n\nRedrawn – Tim riley (talk)\n\n\"his mother encouraged him\" Suggest finding a verb that will imply that he actually won the scholarship.\n\nRedrawn – Tim riley (talk)\n\nI would suggest swapping the second and third paragraphs of this section.\n\nDone – Tim riley (talk)\n\n\"gentile\" Suggest, if the source will support it, \"Christian\n\nNow recast, and much the better for it – Tim riley (talk)\n\nI will hope to get in a few more licks in the morning (early afternoon your time), unfortunately, being on the road, these things take a little longer!--Wehwalt (talk)\n\nWarmest thanks for these points. There is absolutely no hurry with this article – please only look at it further when you have time, inclination and enough sleep! – Tim riley (talk)\n\nMore points:\n\nContinuing with Early years:\n\n\"it struck Levin as so appalling\" perhaps \"According to Levin, it was so appalling\"\n\nDone. Tim riley (talk)\n\n\" It was suggested that he should study for the Bar,\" By whom? Also, there may be a better term for \"study for the Bar\", which might confuse American readers as the course of study for the bar exam is separate from \"law school\".\n\nDeleted the law bit. Tim riley (talk)\n\n\"selecting cuttings\". They weren't cut yet, were they? Perhaps \"selecting articles\". Nice work, if you can get it.\n\nDone. And yes, I had this as part of my job many years ago, and it was bliss. Tim riley (talk)\n\nJournalism\n\n\"Ronald Staples, who, together with his new editor Vincent Evans, was determined \" I would cut at least two of the commas, possibly retaining the one after \"Staples\" (Frankly, that one could go as well).\n\nDone Tim riley (talk)\n\n\"Levin's noticeably Jewish surname, together with such skills as he had acquired in shorthand and typing, gained him immediate acceptance.\" You mean if Levin was a goy, he would not have been accepted? Oy gevalt. I suggest a rephrase.\n\nYes, that is pretty much what I mean. When the editor heard that he had an applicant with a non-WASP name he said, \"Send him in – he's got the job\". No doubt being called Makhaya Ntini or Sachin Tendulkar or Imran Khan would have been equally advantageous, but the point is that the idealistic new brooms at Truth grappled to them with hoops of steel someone who was patently anathema to the paper's previous Mosleyite galère.\n\n\"He gave the opening programmes\" Is \"He\" Levin or Mooney?\n\nDealt with. Tim riley (talk)\n\nThe Spectator\n\n\"against the attempted takeover by the Egyptian dictator Colonel Nasser\" If you leave it like this, you are going to get POV concerns. I would avoid, in this paragraph, detailed info about the Suez Crisis, and either call Nasser, er \"Nasser\" or call him president (or whatever his title was).\n\nI wondered how long I'd get away with this. (POV? You should see the Suez Crisis article, which seems to have been written by Colonel Nasser and John Foster Dulles!) I shall ponder on a more emollient phrasing. Tim riley (talk)\n\n\"had already spotted Levin and\" Delete these words, change the word him a couple of words later to \"Levin\".\n\nDone Tim riley (talk)\n\n\"Lord Stillborn\" I'm not sure if you should link Stillborn to the article about still births, but at least give it a thought.\n\nPondered, but I think not. Tim riley (talk)\n\n\" three Arabs unjustly imprisoned by the British authorities\" Is it unanimously held, even by the British government, that these three were unjustly imprisoned? If not, avoid the term. Also consider a few words to describe the book there, since not everyone may have read LC'sL.\n\n\"Unjustly\" deleted. Have worked up a few words about Lady C. (Not a word to the vicar about this.) Tim riley (talk)\n\n\" professing himself\" A little flowery! Perhaps \"stating\". Also, end the paragraph after this sentence, and start a new one.\n\nI'll fight for flowery in re Levin of all people! Para - good idea. Tim riley (talk)\n\nMore later.--Wehwalt (talk)\n\nAll marvellously helpful, thank you. I look forward to more, but I repeat, please deal with this article only when you have world enough and time. Tim riley (talk)\n\nResuming with Television\n\n\"In 1963\" suggest somewhere in the sentence you throw in the term \"short-lived\" so readers understand that when you wrote \"In 1963\" you did not mean \"From 1963\".\n\n\"In 1966\" \"In 1970\". I would not begin consecutive paragraphs like this. It will probably get cleaned in the wash, but for future information, I see no reason why the one is followed with a comma, and the other is not.\n\nWas Levin a panelist throughout Face the Music's run?\n\nYes Tim riley (talk)\n\n\"Among his topics \" This is awkward. You've put a little known figure (well, in 2011) before two PMs, yet because you comment on the PMs, it is awkward if you rearrange things. At least take a second look at this sentence.\n\nAs you say, St. Mugg is now rather forgotten, and I have removed reference to him. Tim riley (talk)\n\nI would clarify the image caption to make sure people understand that it is an image from 1871.\n\n\"A by-product\" I would make the interest in indexes the subject of this sentence, as in: Levin's interest in indexes developed ...\n\nThe Times\n\nI would move the clause about the general election campaign to immediately following \"In June 1970\".\n\n\"He commandeered a desk in the anteroom\" Suggest ending the sentence after the words \"affairs of the paper\" and spin off the rest into its own sentence with the words \"In addition\" beginning it.\n\n\"Levin caused a lawsuit\" Perhaps \"provoked\"?\n\n\"After Levin's death The Times published an article showing that information \" I think this is a bit POV; after all The Times only has to print one side of the evidence. Something along the lines of \"stating\" or \"alleging\" might be in order rather than \"showing\".\n\nJust as a thought, you might want to make the Shakespeare quote a blockquote.\n\nExcellent idea!\n\nAll your suggestions acted on. Thank you so much. Looking forward to your last lot of comments (when you are good and ready, that is). Tim riley (talk)\n\nI will finish, I hope, tonight, then read through for a doublecheck.--Wehwalt (talk)\n\ni won't be finishing the review.--Wehwalt (talk)\n\nGrateful for what you have been able to do already. Thank you very much. Tim riley (talk)\n\nArriana:\n\nThe name rang no bell with me until I saw \"Huffington\" when of course I recognized it. As she is best known under that name, esp in US, perhaps put it in the section name perhaps in parens? It might catch the eye of the casual browser. And I would certainly at least mention her present name in the caption.\n\nDone – Tim riley (talk)\n\n\"still a youth\" Strike \"still\".\n\nDone – Tim riley (talk)\n\nBhagwan: As he is (at least among those who remember) notorious in the US for the Oregon commune (joined, famously by Bill the Cat), it might be worth a phrase or a parenthetical saying that he relocated to Oregon. Wonder if Levin wrote later columns about him ...\n\nI'll read up on this and add a few words if I come up with something suitable. An interesting sidelight.\n\n\"For the BBC, Levin travelled to musical festivals around the world,\" reverse the clauses.\n\nDone – Tim riley (talk)\n\nI don't think you have to list all the festivals he went to.\n\nDone – Tim riley (talk)\n\n1980s\n\n\"Within a year \" split sentence, perhaps also say when the falling out/replacement occurred.\n\nDone – Tim riley (talk)\n\nUltimately your choice but I think it's more effective if you mention the 1982 phrase first, then say something like \"This recalled Levin's first column after a 1979 printer's strike, when he ...\"\n\nYes, I wondered about this when I was writing it. Now done – Tim riley (talk)\n\n\"another leading Jewish intellectual \" The word \"Jewish\" is a can of worms here. First, you tell us Levin did not consider himself Jewish. Now, there is a school of Jewish thought that says you are a Jew no matter what if you are born as such, some even go to far as to say even a Jew who has converted, using the proof text, as I recall, \"until the day of his death God waits for him\". But you don't want to know all that. Additionally, unless they were depicted as Jews (straggly beards, prayer shawls) I don't see the relevance of even Miller's Judaism. Unless there is a strong reason for describing them as Jewish, I wouldn't.\n\nDone. I felt uneasy at the time that there was (it seemed to me) a whiff of anti-Semitism in the caricatures of Levin and Miller, but I have no citation to back this up, and have deleted as suggested. – Tim riley (talk)\n\n\"The nearest Levin came to publishing an autobiography was his book Enthusiasms published in 1983:\" Perhaps better as: Levin never published an autobiography, though his 1983 book Enthusiasms contains chapters on ...\" Break out that lenghy parentetical into a sentence of its own, perhaps ending the paragraph.\n\nDone, and much improved thereby. – Tim riley (talk)\n\n\"visited the home of eau de Cologne\" If you are saying he went to Koln, say so. If you are saying he went to a manufactory, say so. If you are saying both, say both.\n\nDone – Tim riley (talk)\n\n\" from a sword-swallowing unicyclist to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Donald Trump, and a bag lady in Central Park.\" I see a from/to construction as the demonstration of a contrast. Some of that is lost by the inclusion of the bag lady; I'd either strike that or move it to after the unicyclist. Better yet, strike the unicyclist and put the bag lady in his place, reading a clear contrast based on wealth.\n\nRedrawn, splitting into famous and not famous. – Tim riley (talk)\n\nLast years\n\n\" delivering the eulogy described Levin as\" Better, \"eulogised Levin as\"\n\nThat reads oddly to a British reader's eye: pithier undeniably, but somehow unidiomatic – Tim riley (talk)\n\nHonours\n\n\"He was appointed CBE\" Is this the proper terminology for one who is made a CBE? I would doublecheck. And while what the Times said is great, I'd put the CBE first.\n\nDone (and Brianboulton has sternly enjoined me to use \"appointed CBE\") – Tim riley (talk)\n\nGood luck with it.--Wehwalt (talk)\n\nI am so grateful for the very considerable detail of your suggestions. Heartfelt thanks. Tim riley (talk)\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because… I need all sections especially the epidemiology to be reviewed because I want to know that this will be beneficial to the public in gaining and understanding the topic of drop foot. Bavill (talk) 00:27, 10 June 2011 (UTC) Thanks, Bavill (talk)\n\nComment: Your objective is praiseworthy. However, the article is not yet in a sufficiently prepared state to warrant a full-scale peer review - articles with major cleanup banners are specifically excluded by WP:PR, which stipulates that PR is \"intended for high-quality articles that have already undergone extensive work\". At present the article contains bare links to a few online sources; it needs to be properly referenced per the requirements of Wikipedia:Citing sources, with attention to the section \"How to format and place citations\". Sources should be high-quality - the best available - and I doubt that Sweed-O would qualify. There are also prose issues, in particular the tendency to write material in very short paragraphs. I note that you have not contributed much to the article thus far; maybe your first step should be to contact other editors who are knowledgeable in the area and work with them on improving the article before bringing it back here. Brianboulton (talk)\n\nPlease note also:\n\nThe tool on the right indicates two links to disambiguation pages.\n\nOne of your external links (in the \"Features\" section) is dead.\n\nThe link marked \"Drop Foot Explanation\" goes to a completely unrelated page.\n\nBrianboulton (talk)\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because this has recently been promoted to GA and I am very interested to help this get to FA. Among the primary concerns are the inconsistent histories published by several reliable sources (Associated Press, APO's own website, several Philippine newspapers).\n\nThanks, Moray An Par (talk)\n\nRuhrfisch comments: Thanks for your work on this interesting article, here are some suggestions for improvement with an eye to FAC.\n\nI am not sure that the lead follows WP:LEAD. Nothing important should be in the lead only - since it is a summary, it should all be repeated in the body of the article itself. However the name \"Ritual Dance of the Brave\" and the Tagalog translation of the name of the play as \"Naked Hero\" are only in the lead, and need to be repeated in the body of the article.\n\nI would start the History section with a little more background. I would include a sentence that says the UP was founded in YEAR and as of 2011 has seven campuses. I would also include a sentence on APO's founding date in the UP system. Then I would include one or two sentences on the Oblation statue, including its original year (1939), the fact that it is a nude male statue (though now covered with a fig leaf), and that it is on every UP campus and seen as a symbol of the university. This would be one paragraph.\n\nI would then have some sort of blanket statement along the lines that while sources disagree on many of the details, they all (or almost all agree) that the Oblation Run started in 1977 on the UP Diliman campus to promote the play Hubad na Bayani (Tagalog for Naked Hero). Then I would go into the details of the different accounts.\n\nIt seems to me that the film vs. play should be fairly easy to figure out - films are more major and I owuld think there should be some place to find out if there was ever a Filipino film of this name produced (my guess is it is just an error, and it was a play). So the source could be cited and then some sort of statement that the BIG SOURCE OF PHILLIPINE FILMS (or whatever) lists no such film could follow.\n\nThe article is geographically fuzzy - for example the location of the naked women protestors is not stated in the article that I can see.\n\nThere are a lot of short (one or two sentence) paragraphs in the article which interrupt the flow of the article's prose. They should be combined with others or perhaps expanded wherever possible.\n\nProblem sentence in several ways Women participating in the event, however, is not unheard of.[7] First off, having read the article, there were only two women who ran along one year and the APO organizers made it very clear that they were not participating officially. The other problem is that I checked the reference and there is NO (zero) mention of the women running in that reference.\n\nThe lead does not need generally references as it is a summary of the article and the refs are supposed to be there. The exceptions are direct quotations and extraordinary statements in the lead.\n\nNitpicky point, but references should be in numerical order.\n\nWas the Centennial Run in addition to the regular run that year - this is unclear.\n\nThe article uses {{cquote}} but according the documentation at Template:Cquote this is for pull quotes only, and this should probably use {{blockquote}} or a {{quote box}} instead.\n\nIn Criticism what was the outcome of Pimentel's call for investigation? I would also include the year for the various criticisms - when was the Catholic criticism, for example?\n\nOnce these other points have been addressed, I would get a copyedit - WP:WIAFA 1a is a professional level of English. This is the most difficult FA criterion for most articles to meet - the language here is decent, but not great.\n\nPlease make sure that the existing text includes no copyright violations, plagiarism, or close paraphrasing.

I do not watch peer reviews, so if you have questions or comments, please contact me on my talk page. Yours, Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nThank you very much. Your concerns have been addressed. As for the status of the Oblation run after Pimentel's outcry, it's very much obvious that it still continuous today. I was unable to research on its aftermath. It seems that he just complained and no actual investigation precipitated. I will request a copy-edit once this peer review gets done. Thank you again. Moray An Par (talk)\n\nThe Centennial Run seems to be extraordinary of the usual run. How do I indicate this? Moray An Par (talk)\n\nWhile it seems clear that the run continues, it would be interesting to know for sure if there was no investigation, or if there was one that went nowhere, or whatever happened. Assuming that the run is annual with extra runs for special occasions (and there are refs to back this up), I would say something like \"While the Oblation Run is typically held each year on DATE, additional runs are sometimes held. For example, in YEAR, a special Centennial Run with 100 members was held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of...\" Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nI'm sorry. I really can't find anything regarding its aftermath. It's a privilege speech and not an actual senate proceeding. Moray An Par (talk)\n\nOK, if there is nothing to be found, then there is nothing to be found. Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nHere's a Peer Review (PR) of this article. It's called \"The Downward Spiral\", and it's about a Nine Inch Nails album. I expanded and improved it starting in Spring 2011, and reworked the article, succeeded by a Good Article Nomination (GAN) by me. User:IHelpWhenICan reviewed it in a mixed critical consensus, and the first Good Article Review (GAR) was a failed scab to bring it up to Good Article (GA) status.\n\nMost recently, I have listed \"The Downward Spiral\" for peer review, so please... Don't give any fuck about it. Just talk about the article and suggest to me any improvements to mend the article. I appreciate my move, just because it's a easy job. By the way, the GA review lasted for a few weeks, and was declared an epic failure.\n\nAccording to the paragraph above this one, make any comments about it and give me suggestions to improve it. All right? Okay. Just make comments and suggest random improvements to me. 'I () () `'/ I><pron0un¢ed \"On£-ThouSand-$e7enT¥\">\n\nI am removing this PR request from the backlog and closing it as the nominator has been indefintely blocked for disruptive editing. Ruhrfisch ><>°°\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because History of Tranmere Rovers F.C. recently made it to GA status and I'd like to get the parent article to the same standard. However, it's quite a different type of article (more lists, less prose), so would appreciate advice as to the best way forward.\n\nThanks! U+003F?\n\nI'm away until 4 July and probably won't be able to respond to any comments until then. U+003F?\n\nRuhrfisch comments: Thanks for your work on the article and enjoy your time away. I think this would need a lot of work before it would be able to pass GA, here are some suggestions for improvement.\n\nA model article is useful for ideas and examples to follow - there are several FAs on British football clubs at Category:FA-Class football articles and I would think these would be useful models.\n\nThe current lead is not detailed enough and needs to be expanded. The lead should be an accessible and inviting overview of the whole article. Nothing important should be in the lead only - since it is a summary, it should all be repeated in the body of the article itself\n\nFor exapnasion, my rule of thumb is to include every header in the lead in some way. Please see WP:LEAD\n\nThe GA criteria include broad coverage of the material - to me this seems too sparse and needs more detail. The History section is very short - since there is a GA history article on the club, more of that material should be included here - see WP:Summary style. I think every section in the History article should be represented with a few sentences here.\n\nArticle needs more references. There are some citation needed tags and the whole In popular culture and Rivalries sections have no refs.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that every quote, every statistic, every extraordinary claim and every paragraph needs a ref.\n\nInternet refs need URL, title, author if known, publisher and date accessed. For example ref 6 (BBC) has an author listed but that is not shown here. {{cite web}} and other cite templates may be helpful.\n\nThe article should use independent third-party sources wherever possible. It is OK to use the club's website for some things, but more independent sources would be very useful. See WP:CITE and WP:V\n\nArticle has a fair number of short (one or two sentence) paragraphs which interrupt the narrative flow - wherever possible, these should be combined with others or perhaps expanded.\n\nAvoid bullet point lists wherever possible - In popeular culture would read better as straight prose, as would the crest description.\n\nThe articler needs more images - I note that there is one of the stadium in its article, and a historic one of the team in the history article.\n\nMy guess is that there are free images of at least some of the players and managers mentioned in the article.\n\nPlease make sure that the existing text includes no copyright violations, plagiarism, or close paraphrasing.

Done Calvin • 999\n\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by Anthony Mandler and filmed outside of Los Angeles.

First, change the \"song has also received part\" to \"The song has been covered\". Second, what do you mean by multiple covers? Done Calvin • 999\n\nBackground and composition\n\n\"Only Girl (In the World)\" is the lead release from Rihanna's fifth studio album, Loud, and premiered on Ryan Seacrest's radio station on September 7, 2011.[2][3] Mention the radio station. Done Calvin • 999\n\nContinuing...\n\n\"Only Girl\" is an up-tempo dominant dance-pop song that incorporates elements of eurodance in its production.[7][1][8] - dominant dance-pop? Also, arrange the refs according to their number. Done Calvin • 999\n\nThe song was written by Crystal Johnson, Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen and Sandy Wilhelm.

Maybe you could include a few of them?\n\nMusic video\n\nIn an interview, Rihanna - with whom? Done Calvin • 999\n\nThe video mimics the carefree lyrics to the song, which suggest that she is the \"only girl in the world\".[45] The video features Rihanna as the only person in the video singing and dancing among different surroundings and props.[45] The majority of the video features Rihanna prancing around hillsides wearing a mohair sweater and shorter skirt, a bustier and mini floral skirt, and lastly, a white bra and \"boy shorts.\"[44] Other scenes in the video include Rihanna surrounded by multi-colored balloons, riding on a swing that hangs from the sky, lying in a bed of flowers and then dancing in front of a tree covered with blinking lights that adds to the surreal imagery.[47] - \"the video\" repeats. Done Calvin • 999\n\nThe Music Mix is Entertainment Weekly's blog. It need not be italicized or put in quotes. Same with CBS.

Also, why is skit within single inverted commas? Done Calvin • 999\n\nThe performance featured Rihanna at a masquerade ball, which then resulted in the dancers having an on stage \"cake fight\" as well as having a fire backdrop.[4 - rewrite. Done Calvin • 999\n\nElsewhere in Europe, Rihanna performed the song at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2010 in Madrid, Spain, on November 7, 2010, where she was surrounded by flowers on a set which resembled that of a fairytale,[5] in addition to performing on The X Factor in Italy on November 9, 2010, which featured Rihanna wearing a red pig-tail wig and a flowered bikini,[6] as well as performing on Le Grand Journal in France on November 10, 2010.[7] - tense. Rewrite and maybe split a sentence or two off. Done Calvin • 999\n\nShe was sitting on a stylized tree hovering above a field of sable-colored blades of grass.

Done Calvin • 999\n\nBrit Awards and BRIT Awards. Be consistent. Done Calvin • 999\n\nHmm, This was due to the BRIT Awards corporation trying to avoid receiving similar complaints about Rihanna on the final of the seventh season of The X Factor on December 11, 2010, for wearing a provocative outfit and performing a suggestive dance routine before the watershed.[13] is a very huge point. I feel it needs a few more (two or three more) sources to backup the claim. Daily Mail is considered unreliable, so, yeah, it needs more reliable sources. Done Calvin • 999\n\nThe song was covered by British singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge in late 2010 and featured as a B-side to Goulding's single \"Lights\" in 2011. - source?

Here are some suggestions for improvement:-\n\nProse\n\nThe opening sentence needs some attention. It is hard to make sense of it at the moment.\n\nAs this is a list, it would make sense to merge the brief lead and the Background sections. This would avoid some repetition in the prose.\n\nI have copyedited the first paragraph of the Background section, but further work is necessary on the remainder of the prose. Examples:-\n\n\"the team competes\" → \"the team has competed\"\n\n\"from top division\" → \"from the top division\"\n\n\"a feat repeated six times to date\" → \"a feat it has repeated six times to date\"\n\n\"first built in 1962\" → \"built in 1962\"\n\nTables\n\nThese are generally good. A couple of points:-\n\nThe keys to column headings and colours should precede, not follow, the tables to which they relate.\n\nColumn headings should be defined in the keys, not by links (e.g. \"SC\" in second table.\n\nGeneral\n\nIt is not necessary to specify language when sources are in English.\n\nAs I cannot watch individual PR pages, please contact me on my talkpage if you have questions arising from this review or if you want me to look again. Brianboulton (talk)\n\nComments from PeeJay\n\nThe most glaring thing I can see is the infobox. I think you should delete it and increase the font size in the tables back to 100%. The infobox really adds little to the list, in my opinion, and the list would benefit from having full sized text, as some users may have trouble reading text when it is smaller than normal. – PeeJay\n\nComment: I'm wondering if it would be better to merge the background info up into the lead. Right now the lead is quite short, and modifying that all into 4 paragraphs or so would make it a solid, potentially FLC-ready list. Wizardman Operation Big Bear\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because…\n\nI'm hoping to improve this article, with the possibility of FA status my long-term goal. Therefore, I am looking for all manner of suggestions. I understand that the two main concerns raised over this article's history has been lack of RS and a need for expansion of the reception section. I acknowledge these, but also point out that there seem to be no other editorial reviews of the novel in question that I haven't found yet, and that few sources exist for this topic. Therefore, style-related suggestions are greatly appreciated, and if any sources can be suggested, those would be helpful too.\n\nThanks, Brambleclawx\n\nMostly style-related suggestions from Nikkimaria\n\n\"reviewers such as Booklist and Horn Book Review, who\" - those publications aren't reviewers (or people - can't use \"who\" as written), but publish reviews by reviewers\n\n\"The\" in \"The New York Times\" is part of the title and should be italicized\n\nCan the \"series editor\" be included in the infobox?\n\nMedia type in infobox excludes the e-book format mentioned in the lead\n\n\"it was hard to write the death of Feathertail at the end of Moonrise because death is a difficult subject\" - that doesn't really tell us anything. If she gives more info (as in why it's a difficult subject), then include that; if not, rephrase to something like \"noted that the death of Feathertail at the end of Moonrise was particularly difficult to write\" and leave out the attempted explanation\n\nWP:ENGVAR - use consistent spellings. For example, you currently have both \"travelling\" and \"traveling\"\n\nIs Sharptooth killed by crushing or from a pierced throat? If this is not specified in the book, it shouldn't be specified here\n\nEllipses shouldn't be in square brackets\n\nReferencing format needs some cleaning up for consistency.

Poor Jamaica. I have several suggestions for further improvement.\n\nLead\n\n\"Due to the asymmetric structure of Nicole, torrential rains fell along its eastern periphery across the western Caribbean, particularly Jamaica.\" - This can be understood in two quite different ways. It might mean that the asymmetric structure caused the rains to be torrential. Or it might mean that the torrential rains normally associated with a tropical storm were concentrated along its eastern periphery. Could the intended meaning be made more clear?\n\nI've tried to clarify; I'm not sure if this is alright. ★ Auree talk\n\nMeteorological history\n\n\"Only hours after formation, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system observed a similar composition as initially discerned, with the deepest convection dislocated from the center.\" - This sentence seems a bit fuzzy to me. Would this be better: \"Only hours after the storm's formation, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system observed a composition similar to the one initially discerned, with the deepest convection dislocated from the center\"?\n\nYes, that does seem better. Thanks ★ Auree talk\n\n\"In addition, the center did not consist of but relatively light winds and sporadic convection — a structure rather characteristic of a monsoon depression.\" - Tighten to \"In addition, the center consisted of relatively light winds and sporadic convection—a structure characteristic of a monsoon depression\"? Or am I misunderstanding the meaning? The em dash, by the way, normally appears without spaces in Wikipedia articles.\n\nTweaked. ★ Auree talk\n\n\"about 27 hours later than the estimated time of formation revealed by post-analysis.[12][7]\" - Refs should appear in ascending order; i.e., [7][12] rather than [12][7].\n\nDone. ★ Auree talk\n\n\"By 2100 UTC, the storm circulation had become increasingly elongated to the extent of being untrackable, prompting the NHC to discontinue advisories on the storm while it was located about 165 mi (270 km) west of Nassau, Bahamas.\" - Tighten to \"By 2100 UTC, the storm circulation became increasingly elongated and untrackable, prompting the NHC to discontinue advisories when Nicole was about 165 mi (270 km) west of Nassau, Bahamas.\"\n\nTweaked. ★ Auree talk\n\nFile:TS Nicole over Cuba - water vapor 2010-09-29 1415z.png purports to show heavy rain in the southeast quadrant. However, the dark purple seems to indicate that the heaviest rains were falling in the southwest. Am I misunderstanding something, or do the text and image not quite match?\n\nWhoops, my bad. Altered text. ★ Auree talk\n\nCaribbean\n\n\"In anticipation of a tropical storm, warnings were issued on September 28 for the Cayman Islands, the northwestern and central Bahamas, and the Cuban provinces of, and those between Matanzas and Ciego de Avila.\" - Something seems to be missing after \"and the Cuban provinces of\". More clear would be to name them all.\n\nMentioned all of the provinces between those two. ★ Auree talk\n\nJamaica\n\n\"a house succumbed to the effects of the storm next to a pave gully\" - Should \"pave gully\" be briefly explained or linked to something, perhaps street gutter?\n\nGood call. Gully is synonymous with gutter, so I changed it to street gutter instead. ★ Auree talk\n\n\"Associated monetary losses totaled J$274.3 million, of which an estimated J$75.6 million was required to replace destroyed units.\" - Since most readers are unfamiliar with the J currency, could these two also be rendered in U.S. dollars?\n\nAck, I can't believe I forgot to do that. Added. ★ Auree talk\n\n\"In Kingston, underpasses suffered severe flooding due to the overwhelming of storm water drains.\" - Smoother might be \"In Kingston, underpasses suffered severe flooding when storm drains were overwhelmed.\"\n\nThat is much smoother, thanks! ★ Auree talk\n\nElsewhere\n\n\"Florida was spared of direct impact\" - I think that should be \"from\" rather than \"of\".\n\nOops. Fixed ★ Auree talk\n\nPost-tropical system\n\n\"moreover, the Neuse River was predicted to crest in Goldsboro that day, as well as in Kinston on October 5.\" - I think you need to specify the crest height and compare it to other crest heights. Otherwise, it has little significance since rivers often rise and fall with no special consequence.\n\nThat part doesn't add much to the article anyway, so I removed it. ★ Auree talk\n\nAftermath\n\n\"Approximately J$4 million (US$46,806.44)\" - I'd round the US figure to $47,000, especially since the J$4 million is approximate. Ditto for the other J to US conversions. Even when the J number is exact, rounding will make the US numbers more readable, and the smaller units (pennies, dimes, individual dollars) are not significant.\n\nI agree; I was just unsure if that was allowed. Thanks for noting ★ Auree talk\n\nLink ruminant and plantain.\n\nReferences\n\nThe date formatting needs to be the same throughout the citations. Citation 2, for example, uses two different formats. Either is OK but not both. Most take the form 2011-01-09 already, so switching them all to that form would be fairly easy.\n\nNewspaper names should appear in italics. In citation 32, for example, it should be Jamaica Gleaner. Actually, it should be The Gleaner, since that seems to be the actual name of the newspaper. You can use the \"work\" parameter for the name of the newspaper, and the software will italicize it automatically, or you can italicize it by hand.\n\nCitations to web sites should include the name of the publisher. For example, The Gleaner is published by Gleaner Company Ltd. For another example, the publisher of citation 29 is ABC News. In this case, I would probably use Reuters in the author slot and let \"staff writer\" be assumed.\n\nPlease make sure that the existing text includes no copyright violations, plagiarism, or close paraphrasing.

Finetooth (talk)\n\nThanks for the suggestions! ★ Auree talk\n\nThis peer review discussion has been closed.\n\nI've listed this article for peer review because the article has been extensively revised and reworked over the past few weeks and months. The number of references has increased from 18 to about 90 since the revisions started, and each major heading has been heavily revised to include information on numerous topics related to Louisiana Tech University.\n\nI need the article reviewed to identify and correct any deficiencies with the content, spelling, and grammar. The article is rated as Start-Class, and I am working with a few other people to turn the article on Louisiana Tech into a featured article. This is the first step of our process to review and improve upon our work on this article so far.\n\nThanks for your work and any comments on the article, Arkansas3544 (talk)\n\nRuhrfisch comments: Thanks for your work to improve this interesting article, here are some suggestions for improvement.\n\nA model article is useful for ideas and examples to follow. There are many FAs on univeristies at Category:FA-Class Universities articles, which seem like they would be useful model articles.\n\nThe toolbox on this PR page finds one dab link which needs to be fixed.\n\nI am not sure that the lead follows WP:LEAD. The lead should be an accessible and inviting overview of the whole article. Nothing important should be in the lead only - since it is a summary, it should all be repeated in the body of the article itself - however the space grant is only in the lead and infobox (did not check everything in the lead)\n\nMy rule of thumb is to include every header in the lead in some way, but I do not see anything about Traditions or University presidents or notable alumni in the lead (to name a few).\n\nBiggest problem I see with this article is a lack of references. For examp;le the last three paragraphs of the \"Establishment of the Industrial Institute and College of Louisiana\" section have no refs and all need at least one.\n\nANy time there is a reference in a paragraph with one or more unreferenced sentences after, those sentences need at least one ref too - one exampole (from the same section) The act established \"The Industrial Institute and College of Louisiana\", a first class industrial institute created to provide education in the arts and sciences. Control of the school was entrusted to a board of trustees, which elected Colonel Arthur T. Prescott of Baton Rouge as the first president of the college.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that every quote, every statistic, every extraordinary claim and every paragraph needs at least one ref.\n\nMany of the existing refs are incomplete. Internet refs need URL, title, author if known, publisher and date accessed. {{cite web}} and other cite templates may be helpful. See WP:CITE and WP:V\n\nMake sure that refs follow WP:RS - what makes campusgrotto.com a reliable source (why not link to Kiplinger's directly)?\n\nArticles are also supposed to use independent third-party sources wherever possible - this article depends pretty heavily on LA Tech sources (some are OK, but try to use as little as possible)\n\nThe current state of references would be enough to result in a quick fail for the article if it were at WP:GAN (and FAC is even more stringent)\n\nAvoid vague time terms like \"currently\" as these can become out of date quickly Currently Louisiana Tech sponsors men's intercollegiate baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, indoor track and outdoor track along with women's intercollegiate basketball, bowling, indoor track, outdoor track, volleyball, soccer, softball and tennis. Use things like \"As of 2011...\" instead\n\nArticle has a lot of short (one or two sentence) paragraphs and sections that break up the narrative flow. These should be combined with others or perhaps expanded wherever possible.\n\nMake sure section headers follow WP:HEAD - usually section headers on Wikipedia are more concise (telegraphic)\n\nI would spread the images through the article and not just put them in galleries. See some model FAs for ideas.\n\nSOme of the images are problematic. File:Techxx.JPG is almost certainly a copyvio.\n\nSInce the Lady of the Mist was created after 1923, it is probably still under copyright, so photos of it have to be WP:FAIR USE. So File:Revised Lady of the Mist at LA Tech IMG 3767.JPG needs its license changed and has to have a fair use rationale.\n\nPlease make sure that the existing text includes no copyright violations, plagiarism, or close paraphrasing.

I've done two (failed) FA reviews for another article, so I'm somewhat familiar with the prose issues (flow and grammar!) that can always be tweaked. But I thought this time I'd go the PR route before I attempt FA—learned a little lesson there, methinks. My goals are to tighten the article a bit as well. Any edits I've done in the last couple days have been to prep it for PR. From this point forward, I'll most likely be concentrating on prose, triple checking the citations, etc. Essentially, I'll be working constantly before, during, and after any comments here at PR.\n\nTwo things before I continue:\n\nI believe that my writing style has a slight dependency on quotes/quotations. I will do my best to incorporate this information in my own words if I find a quote to be more or less unnecessary. Please feel free to point out any quotes you feel aren't needed or are just puffery or should be \"absorbed\" into the text better.\n\nAt the moment, I believe there are two {{citation needed}} tags. These are brand new, temporary, and I tagged them myself due to a dead link. They are connected to information that's pretty filler material at this point and will most likely be removed entirely.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is essentially a super B-class checklist, I think: Does the article seem comprehensive? Was there too much information, does it get bogged down with facts at any point? Or is the information spread out nicely, and you learned about the album without feeling overwhelmed? One goal here, as said above, is to tighten the article and I may get rid of some superfluous information that seemed important at the time but now, a year later, is probably junk. Are there any terms that you may not be familiar with, like genres or production lingo that I have a tendency to ignore out of familiarity, but that you may notice sticks out like a sore thumb?\n\nFA really emphasizes excellent grammar, and I would love to have several reviewers keep an eye out for any awkward phrases (any grammatical issue) that I most likely haven't noticed simply because I'm \"used\" to the way I write. How is the style of the article? Several FA reviewers use the term \"flow\" and as it stands, this article is probably on the clunky side. It was written with the facts in mind, and to regurgitate the facts. One thing FA reiterates is the usage of simple English, so I will undoubtedly by rewriting as much of the article as I can in an easier-to-read format.\n\nIn conclusion, I want the article shorter, but just as comprehensive. Any help, even the tiniest most random thing you wish to contribute, will be immensely appreciated.\n\nThank you – Kerαunoςcopia◁galaxies\n\nComments by Bradley0110\n\nFirst of all I'll say I know exactly what you mean when you say you're used to the way you write. I can't count the number of times an obvious error has been pointed out to me that I haven't seen because when copyediting my own work I've read what I want to read. Alas. The article was a pleasure to read and though there are grammatical issues, they did not make me want to vomit.\n\nAs I read the article, I didn't so much get the impression that there was that much of a problem with flow per se, but there's something about the language itself. It has a too much of a narrative style, like the voice-overs on Behind the Music. Although the band's reformation does make a good story, it's important to present the information factually.\n\nYou've got a lot of conditionals in there that don't need to be there, e.g. \"Scott Weiland would hear new material from Robert and Dean DeLeo while the band performed sound checks during the tour, but he would not collaborate in the songwriting process until he was through promoting his solo album, \"Happy\" in Galoshes.\" Weiland heard new material but did not collaborate. \"Woulds\" appear throughout the article and need to be changed.\n\nAs for the quotes, my philosophy on using them is a bit like using a non-free image; is the only way to get the correct meaning across to the reader to use a quote? If not, it should be paraphrased. For example in the background section, probably the only thing that should have the quotation is the Robert quote at the end of the section. Other quotes can simply be recast as prose; in the fourth paragraph you could just put \"Weiland later clarified that he did not want to work with Atlantic because he did not know any of the staff, though since the original negotiations he had become familiar with the label's personnel.\" (or something along those lines).\n\nIn terms of \"puffery\" quotes (your word!), consider whether they are just being used for decoration. You've got a pull-quote from Robert in the Background section. My eyes are drawn to it immediately, as it should be with a pull-quote, yet I don't understand the context without having read the section. If you feel this quote is important, maybe you could describe it a bit more in the quote box (e.g. \"Robert DeLeo in the Toronto Sun on the band's reformation\").\n\nThe reviews section is primarily where quotations are most likely to be used, but, again, some can be paraphrased, e.g. \"USA Today's Jerry Schriver praised the band for releasing a \"cohesive, self-produced reunion album\", but admitted the tracks were not \"timeless\". The songs were found to be \"pleasant\" but \"disposable\" and inoffensive. Schriver commended Dean DeLeo for keeping the \"well-constructed tunes\" moving forward, despite Weiland's lyrics.\" There are a lot of one-word quotations in there and the prose of the article would definitely flow better if it was either rephrased or the quotes around single words just removed.\n\nRe the citation tags you've added, I wouldn't consider information about a limited-edition cover to be \"filler\". I notice that the Peters Billboard article makes reference to \"a deluxe version with expanded artwork\" and then mentions Target. If you rephrase the sentence in the article you could probably weasel this in as a reference, if you cannot find another citation. There are a few reference issues that I think will come up at FAC. There are a lot of citations to GrungeReport.net (sometimes formatted as \"GrungeReport.net\" and \"Grunge Report.net\" - this needs to be consistent). Is this a high-quality reliable source? What standard of fact-checking do they have? In the references section, websites like GrungeReport.net, Blabbermouth.net, Allmusic, PopMatters.com, etc, should not be presented in italics.\n\nThe factual style of the writing is generally good and unbiased. One thing that stuck out was \"The album was prevented from reaching No. 1 by the television soundtrack Glee: The Music, Volume 3 Showstoppers.\" The use of \"prevented\" makes it sound like the sentence was written by a very disgruntled hard rock fan! I don't see that much production lingo but the music-specific language is written well enough for the uninitiated to understand what it refers to.\n\nAs I write this review, the article is at 4272 words and c.88kb (the high file size compared to the word count is presumably due to the use of cite templates). What sort of size were you looking for when you say you want it to be shorter? I'll put this PR on my watchlist so I can come back to you"
