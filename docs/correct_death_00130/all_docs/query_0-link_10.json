        "text": "Thanks to Larry Clark for sending these vintage Numerology magazines\n\nWhat Are Life Path Numbers?\n\nIn numerology, the answers (as you might guess) are in the numbers. Numbers can help you break down the patterns of the Universe and uncover important information about the cosmos’ plan for you. It can also give you the ability to recognize specific obstacles that are in your path, helping you overcome them so you can evolve individually and spiritually.\n\nYour Life Path Number is arguably the most significant one in numerology. It is a road map to your future — it provides insight into why you’re here, what you excel in, and how you can use your talents to fulfill your destiny. It also tells you what, specifically, you’re here to learn in this lifetime. Your Life Path Number reveals your strengths and your weaknesses, which are very important to your soul’s evolution. If you want to increase your understanding of yourself and find the answers to questions about why you’re here or what you’re meant to do, your Life Path Number may just be the key.\n\nCalculating Your Life Path Number\n\nLife Path Numbers run from 1 through 9, though they also include the “Master Life Path Numbers:” 11, 22, and 33.\n\nWhen calculating your Life Path Number, you will almost always simplify it down to a single digit unless you get one of the Master Numbers, which do not need to be reduced.\n\nNumerology calculations are very literal. In other words, if you come up with a 12, in order to reduce that to a single digit you would add 1 + 2 to get the Life Path Number 3. If you get 14, you would add 1 + 4 to equal 5, and so on.\n\nBelow, you’ll find the formula to calculate your Life Path Number. First, write down your birthday as shown in the example, reducing any double-digit number to its lowest possible single digit. Second, write out the full equation, and do the math. If the answer you get is more than one digit long, you should then reduce it down to a single digit (excluding Master Numbers 11, 22, and 33).\n\nAfter that, you will finally have your Life Path Number! Once you’ve completed your calculation, scroll down to the appropriate description to learn more about what it means for you!\n\nAn Example of a Life Path Number Calculation\n\nLet’s use this example birth date: December 22, 1987 (or 12/22/1987).\n\nNote: The day of the month is the 22nd. In this case, we would still reduce it down to a single digit. The Master Numbers (11, 22, and 33) are only kept if they show up in the second step.\n\nStep One: Reduce each number—month, day, year—to its lowest individual digit.\n\nDecember 22, 1987 or 12/22/1987\n\nMonth (12): 1 + 2 = 3\n\nDay (22): 2 + 2 = 4\n\nYear (1987): 1 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 25. Then simplified again to 2+5 = 7\n\nStep Two: Add the three numbers together and reduce that answer to the lowest singular digit (no longer reducing Master Numbers).\n\n3 + 4 + 7 = 14\n\nThen: 1 + 4 = 5\n\nThus, this person’s Life Path Number would be 5.\n\nWhat Your Life Path Number Says About You from California Physics\n\nLook below for your Life Path Number and read on to discover what it reveals about your personality and inner nature. Note that these are more general descriptions, but if you have specific questions, a Life Path or Numerology Psychic can give you insight into how your Life Path Number can guide you through any number of situations that you may find yourself in.\n\nLife Path Number 1 — Independent\n\nYou are a hard worker and born leader, and you would do best as your own boss. You overcome obstacles more easily than most other people. There’s something unique and special about you that drives you and doesn’t allow you to give up on something if you’re sure that it’s worth the effort. You have a pioneering spirit, and you prefer to live and work without restriction. People are drawn to the strong leadership abilities that you develop over time. No one starts out as a leader, but people born under the Life Path Number of 1 also possess maturity and humility.\n\nLife Path Number 2 — Partnership\n\nYou see the best in everyone. You are loyal, honest, sensitive, and sincere, and you make an excellent mediator. You’re a visionary who has the ability to analyze almost any situation and bring it to an amicable resolution. You also have an affinity for music and a knack for creating a healing environment. You’ll excel in roles where you can help other people, such as massage or physical therapy. On the flip side, people with the Life Path Number 2 can be indecisive or even pessimistic. You expect a lot from yourself. Luckily, you can quickly turn any negative emotion into a more positive experience.\n\nLife Path Number 3 — Creative\n\nMany people with the Life Path Number 3 are writers, actors or artists. Your optimistic nature often uplifts the people around you. You live in the moment. You can be a force of nature, using your talents to inspire others. You can also be very sensitive, so it’s important that you don’t put too much emphasis on any negative comments or feedback you receive. If you do, you’ll hide yourself away for a time — though this may help you realize your next greatest project. There’s always an upside!\n\nLife Path Number 4 — Organized\n\nYou like to build things from the bottom up. You’re an earthy soul who never shies away from hard work. Your loved ones will say that you’re reliable and responsible, and while you work well with others, you may also be slightly bossy. You’d do well to remember that not everyone has your sense of discipline or proclivity toward tenacity, and it can sometimes be beneficial to adopt a less rigid approach. You can excel in careers that revolve around management, law, banking, construction, and even agriculture or science.\n\nLife Path Number 5 — Adventurous\n\nYou can’t seem to sit still. Your energy is magnetic and persuasive, and you enjoy your freedom. With your gift for speaking and expressing yourself, as well as your ability to motivate other people, you’d do really well in sales, promotional work, or even as a life coach or motivational speaker. You have the ability to accomplish anything you set your mind to. However, you like it most when it’s exhilarating and utilizes your gift of gab. You’ll benefit if you work on being more disciplined and less impulsive.\n\nLife Path Number 6 — Compassionate\n\nYou have a warm, loving disposition. You love nurturing other people, and your favorite things are family and home. People often admire you; they find your kindness and your other positive traits attractive. You have an ability to ground those who are going through trying situations, so nursing or counseling may be interesting vocational options for you. People with the Life Path Number 6 also tend to be gifted in the areas of art, music, and healing. Additionally, they’re frequently good with animals.\n\nLife Path Number 7 — Thinker\n\nYou don’t mind being alone. You have a deep spiritual side and are intuitive, often possessing a broad view of life and beyond. When it comes to socialization, you can be the life of the party, and you may even come forward and sing a song or perform a magic trick. At work, however, you prefer a more solitary environment. The challenge of people born with the Life Path Number 7 is maintaining and enjoying independence without also cutting off the outside world. Working in the fields of science, religion, or research can help you find that balance.\n\nLife Path Number 8 — Visionary\n\nYou are often focused on security. You’re ambitious and good with business, possessing a strong grasp of how things work in the material world. Therefore, the acquisition of wealth isn’t unusual for people born under the Life Path Number 8. In fact, of all the Life Paths, 8 attracts financial success more than any other. You never have trouble getting people excited about your visions for greatness and expansion, but you’re also convinced that they don’t see things quite as you do, so you need to promote and encourage things from beginning to end. Publishing, real estate, politics, and finance are all endeavors that you could get involved in, as long as you leave room for yourself to expand.\n\nLife Path Number 9 — Humanitarian\n\nYou like helping other people. You have a compassionate spirit. Like people born with the Life Path Number 1, you are a born leader. You tend to be socially conscious, but you’re also a dreamer who wants peace not just for you and your loved ones but for the world at large. Your desire for justice and fairness could lead you to experiment with fields related to the law, medicine, or environmentalism. Money made for the sake of accruing wealth alone will not fulfill you. As a giver, trying to better the lives of other people will bring you both spiritual and financial success.\n\nLife Path Number 11 — Master Intuitive\n\nYou are highly sensitive and intuitive. You also connect with those in the spiritual realm quite easily. You could be a healer, a masseuse, an energy therapist, or a counselor. Once you’ve found your specific gift, you should use it to help others. You are related to Life Path Number 2 (Partnerships), representing your connection to both the spiritual world and the world of earthly, material reality. You were born with a specific role to play in life and your challenge is to find exactly what that is. To realize your gifts and fulfill your life’s path, you must prevent yourself from succumbing to self-doubt.\n\nLife Path Number 22 — Master Builder\n\nThis is arguably the most powerful Master Number. You are very spiritual and may find yourself compelled to help others succeed. You are related to Life Path Number 4, but with twice the magnitude. Your thoughts have the power to manifest in reality. The saying “be careful what you wish for” is a literal statement for those with the Life Path Number 22. Your dreams will take time and maturity to realize, as it is through living life that you’ll find your true calling. Your challenge is to share your gift of vision with other people and to let people use that knowledge to build their own dreams — with your influence, and not your control. Learn to be more flexible so that you might better align with the flow of life.\n\nLife Path Number 33 — Master Teacher\n\nThis is the rarest of the Master Numbers. You may be a spiritual leader and teacher. You have endless amounts of energy, as the combination of the 11 and 22 Master Numbers. You are also related to Life Path Number 6 (Compassionate), and your core is that of a humanitarian. Personal ambition is not a factor — unless that ambition is uplifting the energetic frequency of mankind. You might enjoy hobbies such as cooking, finding it a good way to relax after working on raising the consciousness of the earth’s inhabitants.

Slade (son of Levi), Herber L. Slade (son of Levi), and Henry Dillingham (son-in-law of David and husband of Anna Jeanette, David’s daughter, of course).They began to buy spice and sell it, and since they were sticklers for quality, they did very well and the company grew rapidly.They refused to put fillers in their spice, and they soon became the largest seller of unadulterated spice (something that was hard to find in those days).Besides the mill in Revere, they had a factory in Chelsea, and offices in Boston.When Bell Seasoning’s went on the market, they purchased that company, which had also been family-owned, but they retained the name of Bell’s on all its packages.Somehow the same nicety was not extended to the Slade’s brand when it was finally acquired by a large food corporation, and the Slade’s Spice name no longer exists.\n\nTHE SLADE MILL\n\nThe mill was one of several tide mills dotting the New England coast – an innovation that some say originated in the area. Tide mills worked by using a set of flood gates. When the tide surged in, the flood gates swung open to allow the ocean water to fill the marsh and mill pond. When the tide turned and began to exit the marsh, the gates closed, trapping the water. From this impounded water the mill drew off a steady stream to turn its machinery – similar to the way a mill on a river used the flow to drive its works.\n\nIn 1918 Slade would make the investment that keeps its legacy alive today. It bought out the Bell’s Seasoning Company. In 1867, William Bell had begun selling his blend of poultry seasoning through his market in Boston. Bell had started as a grocer in Lowell, Mass. before moving south to Boston where he could buy spices directly off the ships arriving in port.\n\nOver the next 40 years Bell continually expanded the popularity of his Bell’s Seasoning – a blend of rosemary, ginger, oregano, sage and marjoram – until his sudden death at age 76. Sensing opportunity, Slade purchased the brand, but wisely did nothing to change the name or formula. Instead, he incorporated Bell’s into his own lineup, which had expanded to baking powders, cumin, pepper and a wide range of spices. The company promoted them in its own cookbook.\n\nThe Slade name finally disappeared from the grocery shelves in the 1970s when the Slade family sold the company. Only the Bell’s brand name remains today – touted by a wide range of cooks as still the best poultry seasoning for a Thanksgiving turkey.\n\nThe Slade Mill, though, still lives on. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, its owners converted it to apartments in 2004.\n\nHat tip to: The Spice Mill on the Marsh by Thomas P. Smith\n\nComments from Larry Clark\n\nDrove from North Bay to Ottawa with a wedding cake for my sister in law. My wife baked the cake (3 layers) and had it iced professionally here. The baker was a little dubious when told of our mission but completed the cake. Everything went well until the time to cut the cake. They ended up using a hammer on the knife to break the cake open. The cake (and icing, when you managed to soften it) was delicious.
