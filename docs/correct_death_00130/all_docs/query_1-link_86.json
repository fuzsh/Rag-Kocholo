        "text": "(6 of 8)\n\nTwo and a half years after his wife's death, Diefenbaker began once more to see his old friend from Wakaw daysÂ—Olive Freeman Palmer, by then the widowed mother of a grown daughter, and assistant director of guidance for the Ontario Department of Education. In December 1953 they were quietly married in Toronto.\n\nOn to Leadership. Twice Diefenbaker tried unsuccessfully for the leadership of his party, losing the second time to George Alexander Drew, who as a powerful premier of Ontario had maintained excellent relations with his party's big-money contributors on Toronto's Bay Street. As starchy George Drew led his party twice to electoral defeat, Diefenbaker built up successively bigger votes for himself.\n\nCanada's prosperity was hard to argue against, but one aspect of the boom increasingly disturbed the Britain-oriented Tories, and particularly John Diefenbaker: the extent that control of the nation's natural resources was passing to U.S. investors. Canadians, investing heavily in such safe and sound ventures as mortgages, public utilities and business expansion, put up three-fourths of the capital for their postwar growth; but U.S. investors, plunging heavily into high-risk mineral explorations, managed to sew up 75% of Canada's oil and gas, half its mining. The fact that U.S. investment more than balanced Canada's trade deficit and raised the value of the Canadian dollar only sharpened Tory fears that \"it can't go on like this.\"\n\nAll the tensions generated by Canada's historic postwar rise vibrated through the House of Commons one day in May 1956, when the Liberal government's economic czar, Trade and Commerce Minister Howe, brought in a bill to ensure the construction of a gas pipeline from Alberta to Eastern Canada. The franchise had already been granted to Trans-Canada Pipe Lines Ltd., a corporation controlled by U.S. oilmen; now Howe proposed to lend the company $80 million to start construction. In addition, Howe planned to set up a government corporation to build an uneconomic section of the line. Angrily, the Tories in the House tried to shout down the loan. If government aid were needed, argued Tory Leader George Drew, let it go to a company controlled by Canadians. Minister Howe bulled ahead; the Liberals invoked a rarely used and unpopular closure motion to shut off debate and whip the bill through.\n\nThe struggle left Drew ill and exhausted. From a Toronto hospital room, he resigned as party leader. At a convention in Ottawa in December, John Diefenbaker won the leadership on the first ballot. Diefenbaker opened his campaign for the June election with the simple charge that the entrenched Liberals had become too powerful and arrogant. The Tories, he promised, would put an end to the \"concentration of overwhelming power in the Cabinet.\"\n\n\"I Love Parliament.\" Although Tory old pros in his party warned that such high-mindedness had no political sex appeal, Diefenbaker plunged ahead. \"I love Parliament,\" he said, and described the occasions when the Liberal government had held it \"in contempt.\" Quoting Howe's \"Who's to stop us?\" Diefenbaker thundered: \"The road of the Liberal government leads to the extinction of parliamentary government in Canada.\""
