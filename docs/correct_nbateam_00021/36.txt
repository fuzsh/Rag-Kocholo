First reported by Shams Charania of The Athetic, Chauncey Billups has joined the Los Angeles Clippers’ coaching staff as the team’s lead assistant.

Billups is joining the staff of newly hired head coach, Tyronn Lue, the former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach who won the 2017 NBA Finals. Lue was the lead assistant for the Clippers this past season, ultimately signing a five-year deal to replace long-time head coach Doc Rivers.

The Denver native has never been a coach during his post-playing career, but coaching experience is not necessarily required for veteran NBA guards. Billups was the consummate floor general and on-court coach during his playing days, which included winning the 2004 Finals and appearing in seven straight Conference Finals from 2003 to 2008.
