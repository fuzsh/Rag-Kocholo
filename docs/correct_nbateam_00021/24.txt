Mired in a four-game losing streak, the Los Angeles Clippers got some good news today. Veteran guard Chauncey Billups will play tonight against Minnesota, the first action he has seen since an Achilles tendon tear ended his season on February 6.

After a failed stint with the Knicks, Billups was claimed off waivers by the Clippers before last season and started 20 games for them before being injured. He averaged over 30 minutes and scored 14.9 points per game while providing the young team with veteran presence.
