        "text": "AUBURN HILLS – He may wear a different uniform these days and play his home games more than 2,000 miles away, but The Palace will always be like home to Los Angeles Clippers guard Chauncey Billups.\n\nAnd if Monday night's game is any indication, Detroit Pistons fans will forever consider Billups to be one of their native sons.\n\nBillups was back at The Palace for the Clippers' 88-76 victory over the Pistons but rather than being in uniform, he was wearing a suit and watching from the bench because of peroneal tendinitis in his left foot.\n\nBut that didn't mean he went unnoticed.\n\nDuring the first half, two fans across the court stood up and saluted the man who led the Pistons to the 2004 NBA championship and in the second half dozens of fans near the floor chanted \"Chauncey! Chauncey! Chauncey!\" during a stoppage in play.\n\nIt touched Billups, a 16-year veteran who has played for seven NBA teams but enjoyed his greatest success during six seasons with the Pistons.\n\n\"It's great man, it's great,\" Billups said. \"It's home. This is like home. It's great to come back. I wish I could have played. But it's great to see everybody. They're so nice to me.\"\n\nDuring Billups' six seasons in Detroit, the Pistons went to the Eastern Conference Finals four times, lost in the NBA Finals once and beat the Lakers in a five-game series in the 2004 NBA Finals.\n\nIt's no coincidence that the Pistons' fall from being an elite NBA team began with the disastrous Nov. 3, 2008 trade that sent him to the Denver Nuggets for Allen Iverson. The Pistons haven't won a playoff series since and this season are one of the NBA's worst teams with a 7-20 record.\n\n\"It's hard to see The Palace like this,\" Billups said of the building that was always packed when he wore No. 1 for the Pistons but these days is more than half-empty on most nights. \"It sticks at you a little bit.\"\n\nAfter the game, Billups went up into the stands between sections 104 and 105, signed dozens of autographs for fans who waited patiently to see him and posed for almost as many pictures before finally catching the team bus to the airport.\n\nAt age 36 and coming off an Achilles tendon injury that sidelined him most of last season, the future is obviously uncertain for Billups, who has played in just three of the Clippers 24 games this season.\n\nWould he consider returning to Detroit if the Pistons wanted him in some capacity?\n\n\"Maybe,\" he said. \"It's possible. It's always definitely possible. You never know where life takes you.\"\n\nAnd what does he think of the Pistons?\n\n\"They've got some good young talent.\"\n\n–\n\nDownload the Detroit Pistons on MLive app for iPhone and Android\n\n–\n\nFollow Brendan Savage on Twitter\n\n–"
