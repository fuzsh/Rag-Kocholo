        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. — Last week, during a game at Utah, Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups looked down his bench and did a double take. He could not believe his eyes.\n\nAs Portland was being dominated by the Jazz, there on the bench were Jerami Grant and Matisse Thybulle … smiling.\n\n“I went crazy,” Billups recalled.\n\nBillups marched down the sideline and confronted the duo, who are among his most veteran and better players.\n\n“What the f— we laughing at?” Billups remembers shouting. “I don’t see nothing funny right now! We are getting our asses kicked …”\n\nIt was a moment that could make or break a coach. Players don’t like to be embarrassed. Many don’t like to be challenged. And a coach is rarely on solid ground when confronting veteran players with status, such as Grant, who this summer signed a $160 million contract, or Thybulle, who signed with Portland for $33 million.\n\n“Guys can take that stuff personal,” Thybulle said.\n\nBut a funny thing happened as Billups was laying into two of his leaders: They absorbed his criticism, considered who was saying it and acknowledged their mistake.\n\n“Yeah. We were goofing off and laughing in a game we were losing, and he comes down and has some choice words, and we were like … ‘Yeah, you know what? He might be right,'” Thybulle said, wincing at the memory.\n\nGrant and Thybulle eventually returned to the game and helped the Blazers eliminate a 16-point deficit to force overtime, where Utah prevailed 118-113.\n\n“I was proud of our ability to go back in the game and play well,” Thybulle said. “And it wasn’t ‘Go back in and play well to spite coach’ … it was play well because we were losing and it’s what the team needs.”\n\nSaid Billups: “I put my heart and soul into this. I had to let them know I don’t put up with none of that. We ain’t that type of team. And they accepted the coaching. They didn’t take it personal.”\n\nIn a season where wins and losses aren’t as important as growth, the sideline scene between Billups and his two veterans — and the subsequent response by Grant and Thybulle — underscored an important development: in his third season, Billups’ imprint on the Blazers is becoming more visible.\n\nTo the outside world, the Blazers’ 6-13 record is unsightly, a reminder of the rebuilding project ahead. But to those behind the scenes, Billups and general manager Joe Cronin have already laid the foundation to something sustainable. Cronin has acquired players with character, and Billups has started to form them with lessons rooted in togetherness, unselfishness and effort.\n\nSometimes, Billups has to raise his voice. Other times, he simply observes. But always, he is looking for the word that he has used since the first day of his first training camp: connection.\n\nWith snow falling outside, the Blazers last week settled into Jaja restaurant in downtown Cleveland for dinner, a break from the team’s normal procedure. The Blazers on the road usually offer a dinner buffet for the players served in the hotel ballroom, but Billups this season was hoping periodic group meals in a restaurant would inspire more, and better, interaction within the team.\n\n“I believe in communicating,” Billups said.\n\nIt was the second time this season the Blazers have rented an entire restaurant for two hours the first was preseason in Utah — and in Cleveland Billups said he could see his plan progressing.\n\nThe first experience in Utah fell a little flat. The season had yet to start, the players still didn’t know each other, and there was more time spent looking at phones than in each other’s eyes.\n\n“The first time we did it, guys ate, then started leaving,” Billups said. “And I’m always on them about being on their phones, and that night, I remember going around and teasing different guys ‘If you are going to be on your phone, you might as well have stayed in your room. I mean, what are we doing here?”’\n\nBut in Cleveland, Billups noticed more interaction. There was laughing. Debates. And after the meal, one table broke out into a card game.\n\n“It was snowing outside, the guys were staying longer, it was great,” Billups said. “It became a fun thing.”\n\nRookie Toumani Camara says at the Cleveland dinner he quizzed Grant — who became a first-time parent this summer — about fatherhood.\n\n“I’ve been with my girlfriend for five years, and I hope to eventually have a kid,” Camara said. “So Jerami was telling me how to do stuff, and just learning about what it is like to be a first-time father.”\n\nAnd Camara said he soaked in knowledge about finances from Malcolm Brogdon.\n\n“Malcolm talked a lot to me about financial literacy,” Camara said. “Investing … being careful … having plans. We have all this money thrown at us, and being able to control it is crucial.”\n\nIn all, Camara said many “life stories” were exchanged by teammates.\n\n“Stuff like (the dinner) helps you get to know your teammates better,” Camara said. “Especially in the NBA, because it’s such a business. People forget it is a team sport. But with our group, it’s becoming easy because we have good veterans who are trying to make sure we all get along. You don’t even feel the competition, because with us it’s all about love and getting better and seeing people succeed.”\n\nThe night after the team dinner in Cleveland, Billups went from smiling to smoking hot. The Blazers came out against the Cavaliers and were sloppy, unfocused and lethargic. Cleveland led by as many as 16 when Billups lit into the team at halftime with what he said might be the harshest he has been in his three seasons as coach.\n\n“I was upset because I just had a talk with them in the morning, and it took us too long to understand who we were playing against,” Billups said. “Everything we talked about, we didn’t do in the first half. All the progress we had been making, we took a step back in that moment. That happens, but I can’t let it happen without addressing it.”\n\nWith their ears ringing from Billups’ rant and led by a strong showing from its bench, the Blazers ambushed Cleveland in the second half and won 103-95, prompting boos from the Cavaliers’ home crowd. Part of the victory was keyed by that trait Billups holds so dear: connection. Early in the season, the team would sometimes have a breakdown when Thybulle, a defensive ace, would use his instincts to create pressure. Often times, that would leave the backside vulnerable. But against the Cavaliers, Billups saw better communication and rotations as Thybulle created his havoc.\n\n“I think our connection is getting stronger,” Billups said. “For instance, we know Tisse is a wizard, he’s all over the place. I allow him to be an artist out there … and now guys are understanding that OK, when he goes (off script) we have to get his man … well, that’s big time growth, and it comes from understanding each other.”\n\nThe season is but a quarter of the way through, but already Billups’ vision is coming to light. The team is talking more, the team is closer, and the team is enjoying each other more. Brogdon, an eight-year veteran who has played in Milwaukee, Indiana and Boston said he thinks this Portland team is unique.\n\n“The difference between this team and other teams I’ve been on is when things get tough … I’ve been on teams that separate, or guys go their own way. Or some guys get selfish, some get quiet,” Brogdon said. “But this team never does that. We have a bunch of young guys who genuinely want to win and more than anything, get better everyday.”\n\nDuring Blazers’ film sessions, Billups has a special segment. It’s called the G.A.S. Level and it stands for “Give A S— Level.” He shows it when a player goes above and beyond with his effort. The latest entry came from last week’s loss to Utah, when Camara sent the game to overtime after he pinned Jazz guard Collin Sexton’s potential game-winning layup to the backboard.\n\nIt was one of a growing number of incredible plays by Camara this season, but this particular clip had a dual purpose. Not only was it supreme effort by Camara but also Billups made separate edits to highlight reactions. There was a clip showing the coaches in the second row. A clip of the players on the bench. A clip of the players on the court. Each clip featured everyone losing their mind in excitement.\n\n“It’s been a theme,” Thybulle said. “This season he has shown a couple clips of the bench, and the reaction to the plays, and early in the season it was more of a criticism. Like, ‘You guys have to celebrate your teammates more.”’\n\nIncluded in that celebration was Thybulle, the player who was chewed out earlier in the game, and the player who lost his starting small forward job to Camara 10 games into the season. Thybulle said he is naturally a supportive teammate, but adds that Billups’ constant preaching about the benefits of enjoying others’ success is a good reminder.\n\n“He’s always reminding us it’s not so much about you, and that we should celebrate what the guys on the court are doing,” Thybulle said. “And that Toumani play, first of all, if you don’t get up for that, there is something wrong with you. But more than that, that game in Cleveland, the bench played more than we usually do, and it was the starters who were up on the bench saying ‘Keep going, keep doing it, you are killing it’ to all of us. It was reversed. There was no ego.”\n\nThat doesn’t happen, Thybulle said, unless you truly care about your teammates.\n\n“That’s why I think that was special. Because around the league, you see how some guys don’t want others to succeed more than them,” Thybulle said. “They want to see you do well, but not better than them. I think we have a special situation on this team, where guys just want to see other guys play well. Like, some of us veterans were talking today about Toumani. He’s had trouble getting offensive rebounds recently, but at the same time he is wreaking havoc on the offensive glass. And we were celebrating that. And Scoot coming back and facilitating better than before he got hurt … celebrating that. Because in the long run, that’s what is going to pay off. It’s all bigger than one game, or one play.”\n\nCamara said he feels the support from Thybulle and others, and being the star of the GAS Level clip just reinforced what he felt.\n\n“I feel like we have a lot of love and respect for each other,” Camara said. “So when we see each other succeed, it’s like a brotherhood, a family. When somebody does good, we all do good.”\n\nTo Billups, the reaction he saw from Camara’s block showed him everything he needed to see. The team is coming together, and the team cares about each other.\n\n“It’s my favorite clip of the year. By far. My favorite clip of the year,” Billups said. “To me, that’s where we’ve made a ton of improvement: We are connected. We need to make improvement in a lot of other ways, but we are connected. We like each other, we play hard for each other. And I love that.”\n\nSo how does a group play for each other, and become one?\n\nFor starters, it helps to have players of character. It’s a small thing, but one Billups couldn’t help but take notice of during a recent team event at the Portland Boys & Girls Club: This Blazers team is filled with character.\n\nThe Blazers were at the youth center to interact with the community. They served food, decorated cookies, played bingo. Sometimes at events like this, the player presence can feel forced, as in they are only there because they have to be. But as Billups took a step back and soak in the scene, he was filled with pride.\n\nScoot Henderson was building a Lego set with a child. Camara was eating with an elderly gentleman, having a conversation. Thybulle was talking smack with a child as they played Jenga.\n\n“I went to Scoot and told him, ‘Don’t ever not be that guy you are today,'” Billups said. “No matter how high you go in this league, never stop being you. And then I looked at Tisse, and he’s competing so hard with these two little kids, all of them talking stuff to each other, trying to win. And Toumani, and he was sitting with this elderly person and they were having this conversation … and I just love that.”\n\nBut also, to mold a team into one takes a leader, and one that has everyone’s respect. The Blazers players say they have that in Billups.\n\nIt’s why Thybulle and Grant didn’t take offense to Billups chewing them out in the middle of the Utah game.\n\n“With Chauncey, it’s never personal. And he makes that very clear,” Thybulle said. “I think some coaches may say that, just so they can get those little personal jabs in there to disguise it, but Chauncey is straight up. He’s really honest.”\n\nThat trust is earned over time, and Thybulle said he has taken notes on how Billups treats not only himself, but also other players. And he sees nothing but consistency and honesty.\n\n“When you know and trust that it’s not personal, it allows what he has to say land,” Thybulle said. “As opposed to when players get defensive or shut out what a coach is saying, or we want to hold a grudge. So for me, it’s his consistency. I think it’s easy to say and do the right thing in the moment, but to do it over time, and time again — and when it’s difficult — that’s what Chauncey has shown me. That’s why I’ve been able to do whatever he says — whether it’s coming off the bench, or I need to stop laughing, x-y-z … you got it. Because I’ve seen how he has treated me, and how he has treated other player, and how he has stayed true to who he said he was in all those interactions.”\n\nHe is a players coach, but that doesn’t mean he is easy. He has chewed out the team in Cleveland, gone at players during the game in Utah. And he has made lineup changes throughout.\n\n“I coach the s— out of my guys,” Billups says matter-of-factly. “There are times when I have to be critical. Times I have to go at my guys.”\n\nAnd now, more than ever, he is starting to see results. The Blazers are 6-13, but have had key players like Anfernee Simons, Brogdon, Henderson and Robert Williams all miss significant time. Their last trip included wins at Indiana and Cleveland and included leading Milwaukee by 26 before losing by six.\n\n“We’ve lost a lot of games this year, but you can lose games and get so much better, just as you can win games and get worse,” Billups said. “But I sit back with my coaches after a lot of these games and say ‘This is fun.’ Coaching these guys is fun because everything we say, they try it. And the reward is being them do it right.”\n\nAnd now, the right is starting to happen more often.\n\n(Photo of Chauncey Billups: Dylan Buell/ Getty Images)"
