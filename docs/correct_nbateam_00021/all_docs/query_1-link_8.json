        "text": "Six years after retiring from the Detroit Pistons in 2014, Chauncey Billups is back in the NBA. But this time, he's on the sideline.\n\nBillups has been hired as the lead assistant coach for the Los Angeles Clippers and will join a staff led by new head coach Ty Lue, The Athletic's Shams Charania reported on Thursday. Lue is replacing Doc Rivers, under whom he was an assistant last season.\n\n[ 2020 NBA mock draft: Pistons look for game changer between Killian Hayes, RJ Hampton ]\n\nAs one of the greatest point guards in franchise history who led the Pistons to a championship in 2004, Billups' name has appeared in the rumor mill as a potential candidate to join Detroit's front office. Until recently, Billups had primarily been interested in leading a front office himself. He has also been considered for front office roles with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nIn September, Billups reportedly began eyeing coaching jobs. He played for the Clippers from 2011-13, and was hired as the game analyst for the Clippers' TV broadcasts ahead of the 2019-20 season. Now, he and Lue will attempt to take the franchise to new heights, following a second-round exit in the playoffs this year.\n\n[ Pistons mailbag: Talking through a Blake Griffin-Buddy Hield trade with Kings ]\n\nBillups is a five-time NBA All-Star, two-time NBA All-Defensive Second Time selection and earned Finals MVP with the Pistons in 2004."
