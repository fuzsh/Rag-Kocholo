        "text": "The backstory to how Chauncey Billups pivoted his career into coaching still makes him chuckle.\n\n“We literally could have had a reality television show about it,” Billups said. “The cameras should have been running. It was that funny. It was crazy.”\n\nThe scene was his 15,000-square foot home in Denver during the opening weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. The main characters were Billups and Tyronn Lue, one of Billups’ closest friends who was then an assistant with the LA Clippers. The supporting cast was Damon Jones, the former NBA player and former Lue assistant in Cleveland, Jay “Doodles” Carter, the cousin of Lue, and Billups’ brother, Rodney.\n\nThe plot was turning Billups, 44, the former NBA star, into an NBA coach.\n\nFor six weeks, while the NBA and the world were on pause, Billups’ home transformed into a coaching camp, conducted by Lue. With the blessing of Billups’ wife, Piper, the trio of Lue, Jones and Carter moved into their home. There was daily film study. Discussions on philosophies and strategy. And on the basketball court in Billups’ backyard, plays were put to life.\n\n“I couldn’t wait until the next day,” Billups said. “We would get done, and I would be like, ‘Tomorrow, I want to see if he has something for this … .’ ”\n\nThe daily sessions would last four to five hours. There was enough comedy throughout the six weeks — Jones getting a bad haircut from Doodles, the playful arguments during games of dominoes and cards — to keep it entertaining. But behind the laughs and jokes, everyone could sense something more serious was taking form. Billups was beginning to love, and understand, coaching.\n\n“He just dove into it, full steam ahead,” Lue said.\n\nThis summer, just more than a year after Lue schooled Billups on the nuances of coaching, the Trail Blazers hired Billups to be their head coach.\n\nWhen the Blazers hired Billups, his only experience was serving on Lue’s staff last season with the Clippers. So last week, when Billups met with his coaching staff in Portland, he leveled with them: they all had more experience than him, and as a result, he was going to have to lean on them.\n\n“I’m not afraid to raise my hand and admit that,” Billups said.\n\nBut the truth is, Billups is not as inexperienced as his résumé would suggest.\n\nThose six weeks at his home with Lue were an incredible foundation.\n\n“It propelled him to be where he is today because he had a longer time to work on all that stuff — learning how to draw the plays up, learning the plays, all the different defenses and everything,” Lue said. “For that six weeks, we worked hard and grinded.”\n\nWhile the formation of the six-week coaching clinic was rather impromptu — who can predict a pandemic after all? — the concept of turning Billups into a coach had long been a pursuit of noted coaches such as Larry Brown, George Karl and Lue.\n\n“I tried to get him to come coach with me in Cleveland,” Lue said. “Love his personality. Love how he can tell the truth, how guys respect him. I wanted to bring him along, but he wanted to be in the front office.”\n\nBillups had long been set on a front office position in the NBA, stemming from his respect for and connection to former Detroit Pistons executive Joe Dumars, who built the championship team that Billups led as a point guard.\n\n“I felt like I learned from Joe D. what it takes to be a champion — from a personnel standpoint and personality standpoint — not only on the teams I was on and the way he built them, but the personality he has in really connecting with people,” Billups said. “I felt I could be really good at that job. Really good.”\n\nBut there was a shift in his thinking in the last couple of years when he did some consulting for Milwaukee Bucks general manager Jon Horst. He would travel to Milwaukee two to three times a year and pick Horst’s brain about the day-to-day of being an executive. It was during these trips when he realized a good front office executive was more or less hands-off during the course of the season.\n\n“When you sit in the seat of Neil (Olshey), Jon (Horst) or Joe D., you have to allow the coach the opportunity to really touch the guys every day; pour into them every day, every day,” Billups said. “That’s what you are hiring him to do. You have to be on the back burner. If things slip through the cracks, then you clean it up. I feel like my best gift is every day, every day. That’s when I began to think maybe I should go the other way.”\n\nAround that same time, Billups was being drawn back into the game. When the pandemic hit, he was doing television work for ESPN and the Clippers. Doc Rivers, then head coach of the Clippers, was allowing him to observe practices and sit in on coaching meetings.\n\n“I went to every practice,” Billups said. “Ty was an assistant, and we were spending a lot of time together, and I just really started thinking about the coaching thing.”\n\nBroadcasting the games was enjoyable, but it didn’t satisfy his competitive edge.\n\n“I could call a game and do a really good job, and (ESPN announcer) Doris Burke would be ‘Chaunce, that was good, you did a good job’ … but it didn’t feel like I had won,” Billups said. “The game was over and I didn’t win or lose. It was just … cool, the game is over. So I enjoyed it, liked it, but I was missing something.”\n\nHe was missing the competition of games. Missing the strategy. Missing the challenge. And that’s what Lue, and his two companions brought when they showed up to his front door.\n\nThe friendship between Billups and Lue started when they were 16 and playing on the AAU circuit, Billups for the Oakland Soldiers and Lue for a Kansas City team. Lue torched Billups and the Soldiers and the two started interacting more and more as they ran into each other at other tournaments. Both went on to attend then-Big 12 schools — Billups went to Colorado and Lue Nebraska — during which they kept in close contact.\n\nEventually, they became so close that Billups asked Lue to be the godfather to Cydney, the first of his three daughters.\n\n“We just have this really special relationship. I don’t know what it is, we have a few things in common — he’s down to earth, humble, loves basketball … and is just such a loyal dude,” Billups said. “But at the same time, we have different personalities. He’s been pretty much a single guy his whole life, and I’ve been with my wife for what seems like my entire life. But we just started to talk at these tournaments and it just continued to grow.”\n\nWhen both were drafted into the NBA, they started training with each other and living together in the summer, first in Bradenton, Fla., and then Las Vegas. Soon, about 20 NBA players would congregate to Vegas for the daily runs with Lue and Billups.\n\nIt was then when Billups first got wind that Lue had a special eye for the game. For the pickup games, Lue was in charge of selecting the teams. Billups would always end up with the big-name players, while Lue had a carefully selected team that played to his pick-and-roll strengths, including a center who could shoot and a smart, versatile small forward who could defend.\n\n“The night before the games, we would be at home and he would be thinking about who is on his team and the actions that he wanted them to play,” Billups said. “I’m sitting back like, ‘Bro, you talking about the games tomorrow?’ And he was like, ‘Yeah, I got Jared Dudley because Duds …’ and I’m like, you can have Dudley … and then they would always win. Even back then he was such a tactician.”\n\nSo when Lue kept on him about his coaching future, Billups listened. But when he opened his front door he had no idea how in-depth they were about to get.\n\nA key moment in the transformation of Billups from a broadcaster into an aspiring coach started with the hiring of a chef.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit in March 2020, and Lue suggested that he, Jones and Carter join Billups in Denver, Billups had to think it through. The pandemic was offering Billups a rare opportunity to spend quality time at home with his wife and three daughters. Did he want to jeopardize that?\n\nAlso, he wasn’t going to thrust the responsibility of cooking for three more people upon his wife. She had given him the blessing to have the guests stay with them, but before Billups would commit, he wanted to find a chef. Luckily, with the pandemic shutting down many of the restaurants, Billups was able to hire the top chef from Ocean Prime, who moved in and cooked for the family.\n\n“We worked a deal where me and Ty split the chef … and the rest is history,” Billups said.\n\nWith the logistics worked out, the sessions began.\n\nOne morning, Lue would spend hours going over the best ATO (after timeout) plays around the league. The next day, he might highlight all the best late-game plays. Another day, the topic would be the best defensive sets.\n\n“He would go over who he from a coaching standpoint really respects the most in all those areas, and then we would watch film about what he was talking about,” Billups said. “And we would go through it, I would ask, ‘Why do you think this is so special? … And he would show me something I wasn’t looking for … and I would be, oh shit, that was good.”\n\nFor every point Lue made, there were two questions Billups asked.\n\n“He said he wanted to learn, he wanted to get involved, and he dove into it,” Lue said. “So every day, four or five hours a day, he’s drawing up plays, he’s watching film. We’d go onto the basketball court in the back of his house — me, him, Doodles, D. Jones, his brother Stick — and we’d go through plays on the court.”\n\nOnce it began to look like the NBA might return, Lue spent much of his days in Zoom meetings with the Clippers. Although it cut down on the hands-on teachings, it created another opportunity for Billups to learn about game planning. The Clippers were beginning to prepare and discuss potential playoff opponents, and how to attack and defend.\n\n“He would dip off and do his things in coaches meetings, so I would sit back and let him do his thing, and then ask questions,” Billups said. “I would ask, oh, I don’t know, ‘Why you running Floppy Double against Denver?’ And he would say, ‘Well, they switch a lot and we want to get Joker in the second screen …’ and I’d be, oh shit, that makes sense. OK, what if you played Dallas … .”\n\nIt was an eye-opening experience for Billups, who always considered himself a cerebral player. He learned it was one thing to be a point guard running a team, but it was another thing to be a coach in charge of making all the parts work as one. And it was yet another thing in how to scheme, and how to prepare a counterattack, for opponents.\n\nEach day, he said it felt like he was peeling back a different layer of the game.\n\n“It opened my lens up,” Billups said. “I always took pride in being cerebral and being two or three steps ahead of the play. I was always ahead. But that was as a point guard. As a coach, if you think only from the point guard position, you are behind.”\n\nThe game he had played for so long was suddenly new to him. And he loved it.\n\n“I damn near felt like a rookie,” Billups said. “And that made me feel like, this is dope. I have so much to learn.”\n\nOne night, as he was watching television with his wife, she mentioned that she was noticing a change in him.\n\n“She said, ‘There is a different energy about you with this basketball thing,’ ” Billups recalled.\n\nShe was right. And that’s when it became official. His passion was no longer the front office or broadcasting. He had caught the coaching bug.\n\n“I told her, ‘I found my next move,’ ” Billups said.\n\nWhen Lue replaced Rivers last summer as the Clippers’ head coach, he hired Billups as an assistant. And Lue said Billups made an instant impact.\n\n“He’s unbelievable, coaching our player development games, drawing up plays,” Lue said before the Blazers hired Billups. “Just him working with (Paul George) all season long, how to make plays, what reads to make on pick-and-rolls, and just being there for PG mentally. When he speaks, guys listen. Pat Beverley, all those guys go to him for advice.”\n\nNow, is the biggest move of all: leading a Trail Blazers team that is under pressure to not only win but win big. Now.\n\nHe inherits a team that had the NBA’s second-best offense last season, but second-worst defense. A buzzword at the end of the Terry Stotts era in Portland was accountability and how the lack of it led to such poor defense.\n\nBillups said to improve the defense he will lean heavily on the experience of his lead assistant, former NBA head coach Scott Brooks, and the knowledge of Roy Rogers, who he poached from Lue’s staff. But ultimately, he knows it will come down to his voice and whether he can move this group to defend.\n\nThat voice, he says, will not come in the form of a screaming, in-your-face coach.\n\n“I’m big on respect,” Billups said. “There’s going to be some tough conversations that are going to be had, and it may be in the heat of the moment, but it will be handled with respect. To me, accountability is pretty simple. If we are expecting x-y-z from you, and you know that, and you actually don’t do that, then that’s also a form of disrespect. It just is.\n\n“Like, this is what we talked about, you know it’s important, and you just don’t want to do it, and don’t even give me the effort to do it? That’s fine, but somebody else is going to be willing to do it.”\n\nBillups says it is a two-way street with defense. If you give him effort, and the results aren’t there, then it is incumbent upon him to make changes schematically. But there has to be effort.\n\n“I can deal with effort,” Billups said. “Because you are telling me you are all in. Everybody’s skill set is different. We don’t have a lot of lockdown defenders — not only on our team but in the league — so if you give me effort and bust your behind out there, I’m OK with that. But if you don’t give me effort, and it’s just happening out there, then you are going to be watching the game (he chuckles). You are going to be watching the game.\n\n“But if you give me effort, now it’s on us as a staff to either adjust or do a different coverage, because something is not working. But all I ask for is effort. Give me what you got.”\n\nWhen the time came for the NBA to restart, it was time for Lue and his crew to depart Billups’ home. Lue was headed to Orlando for the NBA bubble. Billups was headed back to Los Angeles, where he would call the Clippers games.\n\nOn the last day, they couldn’t help but reflect on what had transpired over the last six weeks. All the laughs. All the film study. All the long talks about philosophies and strategy. For Billups in particular, it was a time of growth.\n\n“The day they all left we had a big breakfast and we sat around and talked about all the stuff we did for the last month-and-a-half,” Billups said. “It was like the last day of school. Just like a special day. Almost bittersweet, because we had so much fun.”\n\nIn the days before, he had let Lue know that he had changed him, that he was indeed going to pursue coaching.\n\n“I told him I’m all in,” Billups said.\n\nBy then, Lue already knew.\n\n— The Athletic’s Joe Vardon contributed to this story\n\n(Top photo of Billups and Lue: Adam Pantozzi / NBAE via Getty Images)"
