        "text": "Chauncey Billups is officially back with the Clippers. (Getty Images)\n\nB-b-b-ack.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers announced on Friday that they have re-signed unrestricted free agent guard Chauncey Billups. It was first reported that the Clippers would re-sign Billups last week to a reported 1-year deal that could be worth up to $4.3 million.\n\nBillups, 35, was originally claimed by the Clippers after the New York Knicks used the amnesty clause to waive him in December 2011.\n\nHe posted averages of 15.0 points, 4.0 assists and 2.5 rebounds in 20 games for the Clippers before his 2011-12 season was cut short when he suffered an Achilles injury that required season-ending surgery in February.\n\nBillups' timetable is unclear but he's not expected to be available for the beginning of the 2012-13 season.\n\nA trusted veteran voice and team leader, Billups plugs into a backcourt that includes All-Star point guard Chris Paul, up-and-comer Eric Bledsoe and newcomer Jamal Crawford.\n\nThe Clippers also signed Crawford, who was an unrestricted free agent, this week.\n\nBillups is entering his 16th NBA season and has spent time with the Boston Celtics, Toronto Raptors, Minnesota Timberwolves, Denver Nuggets and Detroit Pistons. He won a title with the 2004 Pistons."
