        "text": "Even with Chauncey Billups as the head coach, the Portland Trail Blazers still sunk to the bottom of the Western Conference this season. Now, the former Detroit Pistons star may be on the move as rival NBA teams are closely monitoring his situation in Rip City.\n\nBillups first entered the league as the Boston Celtics’ third overall pick in the 1997 Draft. After several years of bouncing around the league, the 6’3″ guard found a home with the Detroit Pistons in 2002. A year later, he would form a championship core with Rip Hamilton, Rasheed Wallace, Tayshaun Prince, and Ben Wallace to defeat a Los Angeles Lakers team that just won the championship three seasons prior to them.\n\nBillups spent 10 more years playing for different teams in the NBA, such as the Los Angeles Clippers, Denver Nuggets, and New York Knicks. After his time as a player, the one-time champion returned in 2020 as an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Clippers. From there, he caught the attention of front offices as a potential head coach, particularly the Trail Blazers.\n\nIn 2021, Billups assumed the job in Portland with a roster headlined by All-Star guard Damian Lillard. But after two seasons, the front office traded him to the Milwaukee Bucks, leaving the former Pistons guard an inexperienced squad to coach. As a result, the Trail Blazers had one of the worst records in the NBA this season with 21 wins and 61 losses.\n\nRival NBA Teams Are Monitoring Chauncey Billups’ Situation With The Portland Trail Blazers\n\nDue to the Trail Blazers’ horrible performance this season, there might be some changes made for the upcoming campaign later this year. Chris Mannix reveals what Billups’ part in the front office’s plan in a post he shared on X:\n\n“Teams are monitoring Chauncey Billups situation in Portland, league sources told @SInow. The Blazers are rebuilding and just parted ways with two assistants, including Billups’s brother, Rodney. If Billups/Portland split, Billups would quickly emerge as a candidate for other jobs,” Mannix tweeted.\n\nAs it stands, there are several franchises that can use Billups’ services, The Los Angeles Lakers don’t have a head coach, and the Phoenix Suns might possibly let go of Frank Vogel after getting swept by the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nIn any case, there’s always room for Billups in some team around the NBA. With the right situation, the former Pistons star can do some magic down the line.\n\nFor More Great Basketball Content"
