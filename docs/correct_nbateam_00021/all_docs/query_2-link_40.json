        "text": "Chauncey Billups has signed a new multiyear deal with ESPN, continuing his expanded role as an NBA analyst, the network announced Friday.\n\nBillups, a Denver native and the 2004 NBA Finals MVP, has worked as analyst at ESPN since the 2014-15 season, when he was used primarily to provide analysis on “SportsCenter” and other programs throughout the network. He joined “NBA Countdown” for Wednesday night broadcasts during the 2015-16, and this season he became a full-time “NBA Countdown” analyst, working on the network’s lead team alongside host Michelle Beadle and fellow analyst Jalen Rose.\n\n“The insight, dedication, and leadership that made Chauncey an NBA Finals MVP also make him a tremendous NBA analyst,” Kevin Wildes, ESPN’s vice president of original content, said in a statement. “His team-first approach to the show makes him a pleasure to work with and a joy to watch.”\n\nBillups’ work with ESPN will include the upcoming conference finals and the NBA Finals.\n\nBillups has also been making time to pursue a second career on the court. The 17-year NBA veteran will be playing in the upcoming Big 3, a professional three-on-three league founded by rapper Ice Cube that tips off in Brooklyn on June 25. Billups is a player-captain for the Killer 3s, a team that is coached by former New York Knicks bruiser Charles Oakley and includes former Nuggets player Reggie Evans."
