        "text": "Veteran free-agent point guard Chauncey Billups is returning to the Detroit Pistons.\n\nBillups, who helped the Pistons to an NBA championship and was named Finals MVP in 2004, agreed to a two-year, $5 million deal with Detroit, a person with direct knowledge of the deal told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal has not been officially announced.\n\nThe deal was first reported by Yahoo! Sports.\n\nBillups spent the past two seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers after the New York Knicks used the amnesty provision on him shortly before the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season. But Billups played in just 42 games in two seasons with the Clippers. He tore his left Achilles early in the 2011-12 season, and he battled a left foot injury last season.\n\nBut he is healthy now, and the Pistons believe he can be a valuable asset to young guards Brandon Knight, entering his third season, and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, the No. 8 pick in last month's draft. Billups recently won the NBA's first Twyman-Stokes Award, given to a teammate who displays \"selfless play, on and off-court leadership as a mentor and role model to other NBA players, and his commitment and dedication to his team.\"\n\nAfter landing free-agent forward Josh Smith, Pistons general manager Joe Dumars was in the market for a point guard and shooting wing. He landed Billups and also reached a two-year deal with Italian league MVP Luigi Datome, who at 6-9 has 3-point range.\n\nThose moves, including the decision to bring back backup guard Will Bynum, should be the end of Detroit's big free-agent decisions."
