        "text": "The Portland Trail Blazers hired Los Angeles Clippers assistant Chauncey Billups as their next head coach, they announced on Sunday.\n\nBillups, 44, is in his first season on an NBA staff. The Clippers currently trail the Phoenix Suns 3-1 in the Western Conference finals.\n\n\"Chauncey is a proven leader with an elite basketball IQ that has won everywhere he has been,\" Portland president of basketball operations Neil Olshey said in a news release. \"He is prepared for the challenge of developing the championship habits and strategic approach we need to achieve the expectations and goals for our franchise.\"\n\nBillups played 17 NBA seasons with seven teams, earning five All-Star selections and winning NBA Finals MVP in 2004 after leading the Detroit Pistons to the title.\n\n\"I'm very excited and humbled to be the next coach of the Trail Blazers,\" Billups said in a statement. \"Portland is a special place and a unique franchise. As a player I always loved playing here because the passion and knowledge of the fans brought out the very best in me as a competitor.\n\n\"Now I'm looking forward to being on the other side of that energy and engaging with the Portland community on a whole other level.”\n\nThe Blazers parted ways with Terry Stotts earlier this month after nine seasons leading the team. He led the Blazers to a 402-318 regular-season record and made the playoffs the last eight seasons, compiling a 23-44 postseason record.\n\nAfter Stotts and the Blazers parted ways, Portland All-Star Damian Lillard told The Athletic he liked Billups and Lakers assistant Jason Kidd as potential replacements. Kidd, who in early June said he wouldn't pursue the Blazers' job, will be the next coach of the Dallas Mavericks, sources told The Athletic on Friday.\n\nWhy Billups fits\n\nJovan Buha, Lakers beat writer: Billups has dabbled with the media side of the league and a management opportunity, but he’s always made the most sense as a coach. His decision to join his friend Tyronn Lue’s staff this season was hardly surprising. Mr. Big Shot’s cool, calm demeanor is the type of leadership and communication style that appeals to the modern generation of players.\n\nHe has the cache, too, with a championship and Finals MVP to his name. Learning from Lue — a championship coach and one of the best tacticians in the game — this season makes him even more appealing of a candidate, as the Blazers could use a boost in their schemes.\n\nWhat Billups brings to Portland\n\nSam Amick, senior NBA writer: From the very beginning of the coaching search, sources said Billups was the No. 1 preference of Olshey. And it's not even close. From his championship playing days to his media career and this brief stint as a Clippers assistant coach, Billups brings the kind of profile that Olshey clearly feels is an upgrade from the Stotts.\n\nHe's dynamic, respected, and held in very high regard by the best players in today's game. The real question going forward, of course, is what Lillard thinks of this hire.\n\nWhat's next for other final candidates?\n\nAmick: Brooklyn assistant Mike D'Antoni was seen by sources as the likely next option behind Billups, with Spurs assistant Becky Hammon third. The D'Antoni future will be fascinating to monitor, as his trailblazing experience (pun intended) as one of the offensive innovators of his time is indisputable. But will he get another shot at this late stage of his career? We shall see.\n\nAs for Hammon, she will likely continue to be widely considered a top candidate for head jobs. Blazers' chairman Jody Allen was known to be very interested in making history by hiring Hammon, but Billups won this particular coaching race.\n\n(Photo: Chris Elise / NBAE via Getty Images)\n\nBlazers make official announcement:"
