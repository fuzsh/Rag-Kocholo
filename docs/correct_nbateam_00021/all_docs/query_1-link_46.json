        "text": "Before Billups hung up the phone, he wanted to be clear of this: No one needs to write the obit on his pro career, no one had better count him out. “I’m focusing in a major way on coming back, and, without a doubt, my career is not over. You will see me again,” he said. “I know that. You will see me playing again.”\n\nBillups has spoken with doctors who have told him a rehabilitation period of six to nine months is possible. He’s resolved that his illustrious career won’t end with this injury. He plans to reach out to several athletes who have suffered the Achilles injury – including Isiah Thomas, Dominique Wilkins and David Beckham – to gather information and advice. “I’ve talked to a couple different doctors, gotten some opinions and I’m going to get a couple of more,” Billups said. “This injury is not what it was 10 or 12 years ago. It’s not an easy injury, but it’s gotten a lot better and easier to come back from. I’m telling you: I will definitely be back.”\n\nAfter a basketball life of comebacks upon comebacks, Los Angeles Clippers guard Chauncey Billups is determined to make the greatest of his career: a full recovery from a torn Achilles tendon. “I will be back,” Billups told Yahoo! Sports by phone. “I’m not done. I’m not retiring. I will definitely be back. This has been the story of my career, coming back, fighting, scrapping and I will play again.”"
