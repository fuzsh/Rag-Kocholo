        "text": "Ever since Ty Lue was hired to become the new coach of the LA Clippers, Chauncey Billups and Larry Drew have been rumored to be joining Lue’s staff as assistant, with Billups taking the role of lead assistant.\n\nNow, those moves have been made official, per reporting from Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Billups hasn’t been explicitly been mentioned as the associate head coach, but confirmation of that title will likely come in the next few days.\n\nLue, Billups, and Drew have a long-standing friendship that includes a boys trip to the Dominican Republic back in the day. They are rumored to be joined by both Dan Craig and Kenny Atkinson on the staff, though those hires have also not been made official by the Clippers organization.\n\nLue has done fairly thorough job of cleaning house from last year’s staff. Doc Rivers took Sam Cassell with him to Philadelphia, as well as video coordinator Pete Dominguez and Agua Caliente head coach Brian Adams. Meanwhile, Rex Kalamian — the team’s defensive coordinator each of the last two seasons — made his way to Sacramento.\n\nThe Clippers will presumably hold on to Jeremy Castleberry, who is close friends with Kawhi Leonard and has followed Leonard from San Antonio to Toronto and now Los Angeles. However, the fates of Armond Hill, John Welch, Brendan O’Connor, J.P. Clark, and Natalie Nakase remain up in the air.\n\nThe coaches that the Clippers just hired presumably didn’t come cheap. Now, the pressure is on to prove that they were worth the investment."
