        "text": "It’s almost unfathomable to believe there was once a time in Chauncey Billups’ career that he thought he might simply fade away and become a footnote in NBA history.\n\nHe was injured and traded and injured and traded some more. He hadn’t played well. Billups had been on the mountaintop. But about the time Detroit Pistons president of basketball operations Joe Dumars phoned to tell Denver’s King of Park Hill that he was bringing him to Detroit in 2002, the royal wasn’t so sure he’d ever be royal again.\n\nBut then an NBA Finals happened. A championship happened. An NBA Finals MVP happened. Getting back to the player he always knew he could be happened. Billups was flying high, and not even Kobe, Shaq and the Lakers could bring him down.\n\nBut Billups, ever wiser as the years wore on, became more and more acutely aware of this:\n\n“Father Time,” he said in an interview during last season, “is always undefeated.”\n\nYes, even the King of Park Hill has to relinquish the throne.\n\nBillups is now doing just that. Yahoo Sports first reported Tuesday night that Billups is retiring at the ripe old NBA age of 37, with 17 years of professional basketball under his belt.\n\nIt has been the ride of his life.\n\n“I think when I first came out of college, I really envisioned this for me,” he told The Post WHILE sitting in a hotel during a road trip in 2008, soon after he was traded to the Nuggets. “But there was no reason for me not to envision that. Because I had been a high school All-American, a college All-American, No. 3 in the draft behind Tim Duncan, one of the best of all time. So I had no reason not to believe that my career could go like this.”\n\nThe most disappointing part of it all is how it ended — with injuries. Billups spent the better part of the last three seasons rehabbing this and that, always hoping to return soon only to have his body consistently put the brakes on those plans. He played in just 61 games from 2011-14, after averaging 76.7 games played in each of the previous 11 seasons.\n\nYet none of that takes way from the fact that Billups leaves the game as one of its all-time best clutch players and leaders. His cellphone ought to be preserved, it has so many basketball dignitaries and young studs looking for early-career advice on speed dial. Billups’ leadership in his first year back in Denver was the final piece the Nuggets needed to go from a being good team to a team that came within two wins of advancing to the franchise’s first NBA Finals.\n\n“In my stay here, he was great,” former Nuggets general manager Masai Ujiri said. “I couldn’t have asked for a better leader.”\n\nYet Ujiri had to make the tough call of attaching Billups to a trade that sent Carmelo Anthony to New York in 2011. It was the second time Billups been dealt by the Nuggets, and though he loved the city and loved playing for the hometown team, Billups knew he’d never come back to play here again.\n\n“No,” Billups would say. “I’ve seen that movie before.”\n\nIf not for his time in Detroit, Billups’ best, most sustained success was with the Nuggets. He played five seasons in two separate stints with averages of 16.9 points, 5.3 assists, and nearly 40 percent shooting from the 3-point line.\n\nAnd countless big shots made.\n\n“We don’t call Chauncey ‘Big Shot’ for nothing,” Mo Williams, who played alongside Billups with the Los Angeles Clippers, once said.\n\nColoradans have watched him grow, watched him become a hometown legend and watched him never turn his back on the city that raised him. The state’s fans’ love affair with him won’t die, because he’s eternally in love with Colorado. From multiple state titles won at George Washington High School to a one-half scare of powerhouse North Carolina in the second round of the 1997 NCAA Tournament, Billups has always been Colorado’s.\n\nAnd Coloradans loved watching him work. He wants to be an executive now; why not do that in Denver? So many people ask just that.\n\nBillups once was asked if he was a Hall of Fame player.\n\n“The way that my career has gone, you could really only start to think about that the second half of my career,” he said. “The first part of my career was so up and down, not really finding my niche. So obviously if my whole career had gone like this, I would say, yeah. But it’s tough to say.”\n\nAnd maybe some of that has faded.\n\nBut the memories of what he has done on and off the court never will.\n\nChauncey Billups. Mr. Big Shot. King of Park Hill. NBA Finals MVP and NBA champion. Seven-time all-star. Coloradan. Winner. Leader.\n\nAnd now? A well-deserved rest."
