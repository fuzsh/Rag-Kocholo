        "text": "Chauncey Billups has reached an agreement on a five-year deal to become the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nBillups, a five-time NBA All-Star over a 17-year playing career, has never been a head coach but has served as an assistant with the Los Angeles Clippers for the past season.\n\n\"Portland is a special place and a unique franchise,\" Billups said in a statement Sunday night.\n\n\"As a player I always loved playing here because the passion and knowledge of the fans brought out the very best in me as a competitor.\n\n\"Now I'm looking forward to being on the other side of that energy and engaging with the Portland community on a whole other level.\"\n\nThe 44-year-old becomes the 15th head coach of the franchise.\n\n\"Chauncey is a proven leader with an elite basketball IQ that has won everywhere he has been,\" said Neil Olshey, Portland's president of basketball operations.\n\n\"He is prepared for the challenge of developing the championship habits and strategic approach we need to achieve the expectations and goals for our franchise.\"\n\nThe Blazers were also interested in Brooklyn Nets assistant Mike D'Antoni, as well as San Antonio Spurs assistant Becky Hammon.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers assistant Jason Kidd withdrew his name from consideration after it was reported that Blazers guard Damian Lillard had endorsed him for the job.\n\nOver the course of his career, Billups played for Boston, Toronto, Denver, Minnesota, Detroit, New York and the Clippers. Known as 'Mr Big Shot', he was voted the 2004 NBA Finals MVP while with the championship-winning Pistons.\n\nClippers coach Tyronn Lue named Billups to his staff last November.\n\nWord that the Blazers had settled on Billups was first reported on Friday. The decision was met with backlash in Portland because of allegations that he was involved in a sexual assault in 1997. No criminal charges were ever filed.\n\nThe Blazers fired Terry Stotts shortly after the team was eliminated by the Denver Nuggets in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nStotts coached the Blazers for nine seasons, taking them to the playoffs in the last eight. But Portland failed to advance past the first round in four of the last five years."
