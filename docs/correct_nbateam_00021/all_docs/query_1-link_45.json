        "text": "He’s forever Denver’s.\n\n“At guard, from Park Hill Colorado, No. 1, Chauncey Billups!”\n\nAnd as in the glory days of 2009, the Pepsi Center crowd cheered with pride.\n\nChauncey was back home Thursday night, and PA announcer Kyle Speller gave the Clippers guard a special shout-out during pregame introductions.\n\nBillups plays for Los Angeles, but he’s always this town’s guy, a former George Washington High School standout who starred at Colorado and had two stints with the Nuggets, the second featuring a trip to the 2009 conference finals.\n\n“I just think Chauncey’s a winner — he’s a class human being, he cares about the game, he cares about the city of Denver,” Nuggets coach George Karl said. “He’s just one of those guys, whenever he retires, I’m sure the Nuggets will figure out how he can be part of the Nuggets organization if he wants to be part of the Nuggets.”\n\nBillups missed 49 games after foot surgery but is back in the Clippers’ lineup, playing in the backcourt with all-star Chris Paul.\n\n“Chauncey is a tremendous leader, and he’s been in the league a long time and has a tremendous amount of experience,” Clippers coach Vinny Del Negro said. “We’re trying to get him some type of consistent minutes out there coming back from his injury.\n\n“He’s had a big impact on our team and organization, and I expect him to have a big impact moving forward with the 19 or 20 games left to go.\n\n“His experience, there’s no question that it’s valuable. He knows how to play, takes pressure off everybody with his ball handling, big-shot making and free throws.”"
