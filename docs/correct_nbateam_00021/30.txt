After failing to complete a deal for Chris Paul, the Los Angeles Clippers have claimed Chauncey Billups off amnesty waivers. Yahoo! has the details: “Billups, 35, gives the young Clippers another veteran leader. The team also signed forward Caron Butler to a three-year, $24 million contract in free agency. The New York Knicks had used their amnesty clause on Billups to clear salary-cap room to acquire Dallas Mavericks center Tyson Chandler. Under terms of the league’s amnesty police, any team under the salary cap can put bid on Billups. The bid will offset part of the $14.2 million the Knicks owe Billups in the final year of his contract. The Clippers can’t trade Billups this season. ‘After a while, you just kind of get taken advantage of in these situations,’ Billups said on Saturday. ‘I’ve been known as a leader – and I am a leader – but a leader can be as disruptive as he can be productive, especially when you carry a strong voice and people rally around you. This is about me now. This is about me, and teams should know that right now.'”
