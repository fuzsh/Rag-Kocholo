NBA analyst Chauncey Billups loves the Los Angeles Clippers' move to get Kawhi Leonard and Paul George.

Per Broderick Turner of the Los Angeles Times, Billups admitted that for the first time in a long while, he doesn't know who'll win the title because there's now good parity in the league.

“I was so happy, just because I love parity and I love going into an NBA season and it’s like, ‘Man, I don’t know who is going to win it because there are so many good teams.’ I missed that,” Billups said.

“We haven’t had that in a long time, and the fact that Kawhi was able to go there and Paul George will be there and them join what already is a good team … I loved it.”

Billups echoed the sentiments of the majority of NBA fans on the Leonard and George team-up on the Clippers. For the past five seasons, it's been the Golden State Warriors who were considered the most dominant team in basketball. The Toronto Raptors' recent win seemingly broke the mold. Yet, little did we know that Leonard had another trick up his sleeve.

Now, he has teamed up with a fellow two-way player in George. And not just that, but they'll be joining forces with a competitive Clippers squad comprised of three-time Sixth Man of the Year winner Lou Williams, defensive stalwart Patrick Beverley, and championship-winning coach Doc Rivers.

Like Billups, fans and experts alike believe there is now competitive balance in the NBA.

Leonard has been tagged as a dynasty killer after ending the championship runs of the Miami Heat and the Warriors. Now, it seems that he's about to embark on his own regime.
