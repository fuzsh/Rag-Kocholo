Biography

German-American chemist, he emigrated to the United States in October 1848 and founded the Pfizer pharmaceutical company with his cousin Charles F. Erhart in 1849 as Charles Pfizer & Co.

Erhart died in 1891, and Pfizer remained as the head of the company until 1900, when it was incorporated and Charles Pfizer, Jr. became its first president.

Pfizer died on 19 October 1906 at age 82 at his summer home "Lindgate" in Newport, Rhode Island. His death came a few weeks after a fall down stairs in which he broke an arm and was otherwise badly injured.

Today, Pfizer Inc. is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies.
