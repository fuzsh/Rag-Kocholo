Charles Pfizer (March 22, 1824 in Ludwigsburg as Karl Pfizer â€“ October 19, 1906)

German chemist who immigrated to the United States seeking new opportunities in the early 1840s who in 1849 founded the Pfizer Inc. pharmaceutical company as Charles Pfizer & Co. with his cousin Charles Erhart.

They borrowed $2,500 from Pfizer's father and purchased a small brick building on Bartlett Street in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, where they produced santonin, a drug used to combat parasitic worms, as well as other fine chemicals. Over time they expanded their product line to include iodine salts, mercurials, and bismuth salts for pharmaceuticals use. The cousins' insistence on quality was virtually an obsession, and their products very quickly won widespread recognition for "Pfizer Quality," a slogan that was later used on all Pfizer packaging.

In 1857, Pfizer opened an office in downtown Manhattan on Beekman Street, in the heart of the drug and chemical district. Eleven years later, this office was moved to a four-story building at 81 Maiden Lane in the Wall Street area where, in 1878, the Company installed one of the city's first telephones.

Charles Pfizer Sr. remained at its head until 1900, when the company was incorporated and Charles Pfizer, Jr. became its first president. When Charles Jr. retired, his brother Emil succeeded him in his post.

He made frequent trips to Europe where he maintained contacts with providers of raw materials, which the Company converted into preparations for wholesale and retail chemists. On one of these trips he met his wife Anna Hausch, and married her in 1859, in his hometown of Ludwigsburg. They had five children.

By 1860, the Company was manufacturing borax and boric acid. The company was the first important producer of these chemicals in the United States. During the Civil War, a protective tariff against imported tartars enabled the Company to start local production of tartars, which were made from encrustation residues left in wine casks. Tartaric acid carried in battlefield medical kits helped to treat the wounds and diseases of Union Army soldiers.

Expansion continued after the war chiefly in the manufacture of citric acid from imported citrate of lime. Just prior to retiring in 1900, Charles Pfizer incorporated the Company with authorized capital of $100,000 divided into 1,000 shares, with a par value of $100 a share. At the time of his death in 1906 at age 82 Chas. Pfizer & Co., Inc. had sales of about $3.4 million and nearly 200 employees.

He died at his summer home, Lindgate, in Newport, Rhode Island; his year-round home was in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.

His death came a few weeks after a fall down stairs in which he broke an arm and was otherwise badly injured.

Two daughters, Alice, Baroness Bachofen von Echt and Mrs. Frederick Duncan of Vienna, were with him when he died.
