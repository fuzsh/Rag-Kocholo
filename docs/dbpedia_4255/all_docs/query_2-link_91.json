        "text": "Yasmin Ghochani, MD, PhD\n\n3rd Year Resident\n\nYasmin attended the University of CA, San Diego (UCSD) for her undergraduate studies, double majoring in Biochemistry/Cell Biology and Cognitive Neuroscience. As internships at The Scripps Research Institute’s MIND, and Pfizer Global R&D – La Jolla got her interested in research, she then continued to obtain her Master’s Degree at UCSD in biology with emphasis in neuroendocrinology of reproduction in the Mellon Lab. With aspirations for an academic career, she then conducted her Ph.D. studies at the University of CA, Los Angeles in Molecular Biology. Her dissertation research was more translational, as she studied the Glioblastoma perivascular niche in search of vascular mediators of tumor growth and invasion with the Kornblum lab. Newly interested in translational research, and to appease her passion to provide direct care to patients, Yasmin attended medical school at the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix. She continued to conduct research at the Barrow Neurological Institute, where she studied the safety and efficacy of various endovascular techniques and adjuvant therapies in treatment of Basilar Tip Aneurysms with Dr. Ducruet. Yasmin learned a great deal regarding neurological vascular interventions through this project and continues to have a keen interest in vascular neurology today. Yasmin has completed her PGY-1 with the UCLA Department of Medicine based at the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center. Outside of work, Yasmin is the proud Mom of her curious 6-year-old son and 2.5-year-old daughter. She is a fan of walking around town while shopping with friends and family, enjoys yoga with her kids, and is a lover of all water activities. She and her spouse also love travelling near and far and try to get out of town at every opportunity.\n\nErick Martínez Juárez, MD\n\n3rd Year Resident\n\nBorn in a small town called Bainbridge and raised in a migrant farmworker camp in deep rural southwest Georgia, Erick is the second of five proud children to Mexican immigrant farmworkers. After becoming the first Hispanic valedictorian of his high school, he briefly attended the United States Military Academy at West Point in New York before changing his career goals. After leaving the Academy, he enrolled at Harvard University, where he graduated with a BA in neurobiology in 2015 and became the first person in his entire family history to graduate from college. Prior to medical school, Erick spent a year in Medellín, Colombia, as a teaching fellow for former child soldiers through the Princeton in Latin America program. He also worked briefly for a growing bioplastics company near his hometown before matriculating at the Medical College of Georgia (MCG) at Augusta University. It was at MCG where he followed through with his passion for neurology. He will have completed PGY-1 with the incredible UCLA Department of Medicine based at the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center. Within neurology, Erick is currently interested in vascular neurology, movement disorders, and EDI, but he is open and excited to explore everything that neurology and UCLA has to offer! He aspires to uplift all communities, especially Latinxs and farmworkers, in earnest through medicine and (likely) public service. During his free time, Erick loves dancing to Latin music (Bad Bunny, reggaeton, cumbia, salsa, merengue, etc -- he hopes to improve his budding skills here in SoCal!), eating tacos, reppin Georgia, running, watching & playing sports, and exploring new cultures & their cuisines.\n\nRebecca Jules, MD\n\n3rd Year Resident\n\nRebecca was born and raised in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, then moved to South Florida as a teenager. Her initial interest in the neurosciences was sparked in high school during a lecture on neurotransmitters. She then attended the University of Florida where she majored in neuroscience. She remained at the University of Florida for medical school in the hopes of becoming a neurologist. After medical school, she traveled from one coast to another to complete her intern year at UCLA-Olive View and remained in LA for her neurology training at UCLA.
