        "text": "Arrived at the College: 1936\n\nBrother Denis zealously served the Brothers, students and alumni of Manhattan College as a member of the School of Engineering for 50 years. His legacy is marked by a reputation for dynamic action and a genuine concern for his students and confreres. An expert in the field of descriptive geometry, Br. Denis arrived at Manhattan in 1936 to teach in the Civil Engineering department and to serve as head of the Graphics Engineering department. He was beloved by the engineering students, who dedicated the 33rd Annual Engineer’s Ball to him and awarded him the 1961 Engineers “Mug of the Year.” “Men like Br. Denis,” they proclaimed, “make an institution like Manhattan College human.” In addition to his masterful teaching skills, Br. Denis also served as a moderator for the track team and, for over 30 years, an ardent fundraiser for the Christian Brothers’ missions.\n\nArrived at the College: 1957\n\nBrother Gerard came to Manhattan as a teacher in chemical engineering in 1957, but his tenure was relatively short; for a few years at the College, he was simultaneously assigned as Director of Physical Plant. Br. Gerard's first task was to transform the garage area (where the parking garage exists today) into a chemical laboratory. Practically, creatively, and daringly, he went to work on this vast project, spending months sweating out the details of intricate piping, valves and gauges required for chemical engineering experiments. The building later became the Paulian Laboratories. By 1965, Br. Gerard left the classroom for good and remained at Manhattan College as Physical Plant Director and Prefect until the mid-1970s.\n\nArrived at the College: 1957\n\nBrother Michael served his entire career as a professor of electrical engineering at Manhattan College. When he was appointed in 1957 to the Electrical Engineering department in the School of Engineering, amid the excitement of “the transistor age,” Br. Michael ushered all electrical engineers into that challenging milieu. In addition, Br. Michael always instilled in his students a sense of the power and potential dangers of electricity. He also strongly believed in its healing powers. What began as an interest in electrostimulation led to additional professional activities. For more than 25 years, Br. Michael worked with Dr. Yoshiaki Omura in the field of biomedical electronics and acupuncture. Together, they were instrumental in the work which led to a “needle-less” method of diagnosis, to ascertain the presence of bacterial viruses or malignant tumors. Br. Michael also helped prepare doctors and dentists for certification in acupuncture by the New York State Board of Medicine. He served on the Board of Directors of the Heart Disease Research Foundation and was a literary associate on the foundation’s journal of the Foundation and regular contributor. Br. Michael unexpectedly passed away at age 67.\n\nArrived at the College: 1930\n\nBrother Aubert served at Manhattan for over three decades as a professor and leader in the Civil Engineering department. A lecturer on technical topics, he authored a treatise, “Review Problems in Statics and Dynamics,” and was an active member of the New York Society of Professional Engineers as well as the American Society of Civil Engineers. Through his many years of teaching and prefecting, Br. Aubert knew and guided many Manhattan students to success in the field. He also saw many go off to war, and through a voluminous exchange of letters, provided them with counsel and prayer during their service. But beyond his commitment as an engineer, teacher and assistant dean, Br. Aubert was an exceptional humanitarian, for example, launching Manhattan College’s blood bank efforts. Shortly before Br. Aubert’s death in 1960, New York City Mayor Robert Wagner issued a proclamation recognizing his accomplishments with the Blood Bank program.\n\nArrived at the College: 1912\n\nIn 1910, Br. Azarias was assigned to the original De La Salle Institute to supervise engineering courses that ultimately would become part of Manhattan College’s School of Engineering. A few years later, he was assigned to head the College’s Mathematics department, which he continued to serve during the last eighteen years of his life. Br. Azarias drew recognition for abiding interest in the welfare of his students. He twice declined the presidency of Manhattan College, convinced that his best work was in the classroom. In 1921, however, he did accept the position of Dean of the School of Engineering. Br. Azarias was instrumental in enlarging the curriculum and securing up-to-date laboratory equipment and facilities. Under his guidance, courses in Industrial and Architectural Engineering were initiated and the College gained membership in the American Society of Civil Engineering. He also taught surveying and railroad engineering at the College’s engineering camps.\n\nArrived at the College: 1959\n\nBrother Bill joined Manhattan’s electrical engineering faculty in 1959. In those early days, engineering courses were taught in the somewhat primitive conditions of the temporary classrooms on the hill where the old ballfield used to be. During the 1960s, Br. Bill served as the Career Day Moderator and city-wide coordinator when the College played host to other schools. He also moderated the publication Manhattan Engineer and for a few years ran the annual engineering ball. Summer experiences included NSF study grants and research opportunities in aviation, feedback systems and nuclear energy at such places as Argonne National Labs, Purdue University and the University of Santa Clara. As enrollment expanded in the engineering school, Br. Bill became its first assistant dean, an acting dean, and assistant dean again. He eventually returned to full-time teaching, particularly the senior elective courses and his special area of expertise, electrical networks. He also taught religion and English literature while serving as the debate team’s coach and moderator. Br. Bill played a pivotal role in the College’s power engineering concentration, teaching energy conversion and power systems, in addition to teaching the nascent field of computer programming.\n\nArrived at the College: 1935\n\nBrother Bernard of Mary, founder of the Electrical Engineering department, was a dynamic teacher, notable author and outstanding administrator. Foreseeing the needs of modern industry, he was chosen to steer the newly formed Electrical Engineering department with an emphasis on the power and the communication fields. A formidable mathematician and physicist, he was the first Christian Brother inducted into the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the first religious in the United States to receive the second highest grade as a member. He also served as acting dean of engineering under the Army Specialized Training Program during World War II.\n\nArrived at the College: 1955\n\nBrother James came to Manhattan College to teach electrical engineering and a few religion classes in addition to serving serve as prefect of student residences. Br. Jim demonstrated a sincere desire that his students master the intricacies of electricity and electronics. As new courses developed in the field, he quickly absorbed the material and dedicated the preparation required to fashion new content. Br. Jim had special expertise in computer science, engineering mathematics and electromagnetic topics. In the summer of 1962, he — along with other engineers and Christian Brothers — worked in California designing the Apollo spacecraft, which eventually went to the moon.\n\nBr. James was also a pioneer in teaching and using computers on campus, especially main frames. In 1963, when Br. James inaugurated the first Computer Center in Leo Hall, he and Br. Albert Welsh moved the old main frame from Manhattan Hall (now Miguel) stairs and onto a borrowed truck for its journey down the road. Br. James retired in 1989 after three decades in the classroom.\n\nArrived at the College: 1889\n\nThe formation of the School of Engineering was, of course, the work of many dedicated scholars and administrators. Yet Brother Cesarius enjoys the title of founder. His years of scholarship at McGill University and his services as a practical and accomplished engineer in Canada and the western United States brought him in 1889 to De La Salle Institute in New York. There, he reorganized the science department and established an engineering curriculum. This ultimately gave rise to Manhattan College’s School of Engineering.\n\nArrived at the College: 1954\n\nBrother Albert was dedicated to serving others through teaching. Even when he was not offering formal instruction to his students, he was always looking for ways to reach out to others. A brilliant scientist, Br. Albert began his Manhattan College career as a professor of electrical engineering and became chairman of the department in 1961. A skilled engineer, Brother Albert pulled the forces of nature and the materials of his discipline together to create new approaches to problems, developing novel devices and ideas to push forward the thresholds of knowledge. He had a “moving laboratory” installed in the Electrical Engineering department, where he worked on various prototypes, computers, “heat-saving” inventions and solar energy. As a member of the local district planning board, Br. Albert engaged his chemical engineering students to study causes of and possible solutions to the erosion in the south end of Riverdale Park. He was especially giving to those who faced physical obstacles. Toward the end of his life, Br. Albert co-developed a computer program designed to teach visually impaired people the sign-language alphabet in less than one hour.\n\nArrived at the College: 1955\n\nBrother Timothy was one of the giants of Manhattan College engineering. He arrived in 1955, when the School of Engineering was located in temporary buildings on the athletic field and only electrical engineering and civil engineering were offered. With this basic engineering program in place and preparations underway for a new engineering building, Br. Tim established the Chemical Engineering department for the freshman class of 1957. The original undergraduate program quickly burgeoned into a robust department with modern laboratories. It was eventually followed by a successful graduate program that saw the development of research programs involving faculty and students. Through Br. Tim’s efforts, Manhattan’s Chemical Engineering department became one of the most respected in the nation.\n\nUnder his direction, the School of Engineering developed the Particulate Solid Research, Inc. and engaged the support and sponsorship of leading corporate engineering firms across the nation. This resulted in the funding of numerous public and private grants. Serving as a professor, department chair and eventually dean of the School of Engineering, Br. Tim ensured that quality education remained the trademark of the School. In 2002, alumni and friends of the College established the Brother Conrad Timothy Burris Endowment, a chemical engineering tuition and research scholarship.\n\nArrived at the College: 1896\n\nBrother Potamian was a renowned scientist and pioneer in x-ray technology. Not only was he a leading authority on magnetism and electricity; he also was conversant with every branch of science. Progress in science in the 1870s was rapid, and Br. Potamian enhanced the general understanding of many new inventions. For example, his first scientific article on the electric lamp was published in 1873. Br. Potamian was aided by friendship on both a personal and scientific level with such electrical pioneers as Lord Kelvin, James Wimshurst and Gilielmo Marconi. Reflecting his own scientific acumen were his personal experiments in magnetism, electronics and telegraphy. Shortly after the first clinical x-ray photograph was produced in 1895, Br. Potamian, using a spark coil, focus tube and wet plate, made a radiograph of a young woman’s hand showing a splinter of steel. It was a one-minute exposure. When the plate was developed, the splint was distinctly seen and promptly removed.\n\nIn 1896, Brother was assigned to Manhattan and appointed the first Dean of the School of Engineering. It was under his guidance that the School expanded its science and engineering facilities and developed into a strong, healthy institution. He also became secretary of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and continued to publish papers on electricity and magnetism.\n\nArrived at the College: 1943 or 1954\n\nWhen World War II broke out, Brother Andrew was called upon to improve math courses in the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP), which Manhattan College had developed for the Army recruits of college age. Although mobilization for the Battle of the Bulge ended the program and Br. Andrew was reassigned, he eventually returned to Manhattan in 1954 to teach in the Mathematics department. In addition to full-time teaching, Br. Andrew served as a residence hall prefect and as director of the Brothers community. He became known as one of the College’s most effective math teachers and a pillar of the Manhattan College community.\n\nArrived at the College: 1956\n\nBrother Austin’s work at Manhattan College spanned thirty-five years. Teaching science and mathematics, he was known as an instructor of immense patience and commitment. Undergraduate students appreciated his dedication, scholarship and gentle sense of humor. In addition to teaching, Br. Austin engaged in numerous professional activities as well as research. He worked at Brookhaven National Laboratories in neutron spectroscopy, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in nuclear reactor theory and at Argonne National Laboratory in Mossbauer spectroscopy. His areas of expertise also included medical physics, which brought him to the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Br. Austin held membership in many prestigious honor societies and prominent professional organizations.\n\nArrived at the College: 1964\n\nBrother William began his career at Manhattan College in 1964. During this time, he conducted critical research on the neutrino, which is an element smaller than a neutron. Br. William taught and collaborated with other Manhattan College greats including Brothers Gabriel Kane, Bernard Thomas Kelly and Austin Bernabei in the Physics department. For close to 30 years, Br. William also served as the chief administrator and creative force behind the Computer Center. Training and directing the Center’s staff for over a decade, Br. William retired in 1989.\n\nArrived at the College: 1955\n\nBrother Edward joined the Manhattan College faculty in 1955 as an instructor of mathematics. In 1964, Br. Stephen Sullivan, the Academic Vice President, asked him to take a year off and learn all he could about the computer. And he did. Br. Edward was responsible for bringing the first computer to campus and is considered the founding director of the present Computer Center. On his way to becoming a computer wizard, Br. Edward had to step away from the classroom in 1965 when he was sidetracked by administrative work. He was appointed Vice President for Student Services at the beginning of an era of student unrest. Admiring students dedicated the 1966 Manhattanite yearbook to him. The loyalty and love that Br. Edward had inspired in Manhattan College students made him a most likely candidate for the position of director of alumni relations in 1973. With a spirit of creativity and sensitivity, Brother initiated the Alumni Athletic Hall of Fame, the first Career Day, and revitalized the Alumni Banquet.\n\nArrived at the College: 1955\n\nBrother Frank taught for 54 consecutive years, right up to the end of his life. He joined the Manhattan College faculty in 1955 as a teacher in mathematics, physics and religious studies. Students regularly commended him for his dedication, clarity of his lectures and availability for outside help. When the College acquired its critical low-power nuclear reactor, Br. Frank was tapped as its operator. He was well prepared, having attended the American Society for Engineering Institute for nuclear engineering at Cornell and Brookhaven in addition to studying advanced specialized courses in reactor operation sponsored by ASEE and the Atomic Energy Commission at Argonne National Lab and Stanford. He often conducted the reactor demonstrations at the College’s Nuclear Science Laboratories in the Engineering Building. Though he retired from full-time teaching in 1983, Brother Frank remained an important, active lecturer at the College.\n\nArrived at the College: 1936\n\nBrother Alfred served on the College’s mathematics faculty for 38 years. During that time, he chaired the undergraduate department and later served as the head of graduate Mathematics department. Br. Alfred's teaching schedule was heavy and his classes large. Besides math, he also taught religion and orientation. Throughout the postwar era, Br. Alfred became Chair of the Metropolitan Section of the Mathematics Association of America, as well as an active participant in the American Math Society, the National Council of Math Teachers and the New York Academy of Sciences. Over the years, Br. Alfred also authored several articles on mathematics. In addition, Br. Alfred directed the College’s Mathematics Institute, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, which offered courses to math teachers in secondary schools throughout the metropolitan area. In 1963, Br. Alfred earned a Fulbright scholarship to serve as a visiting lecturer at Al-Hikma University in Baghdad, Iraq. There he taught advanced mathematics as a member of the department of Civil Engineering. An avid golfer, Br. Alfred also moderated the College’s varsity golf team.\n\nArrived at the College: 1942\n\nBrother Bernard brought his passion for mathematics to Manhattan College in 1942, where he taught for 17 years. His interest in the subject led to positions of honor among his peers: he served as the associate editor of the New York Math Teachers Journal, chair of Bronx County Math Teachers and as a member of the Association of Math Teachers in New England. Br. Bernard had a very warm personality and related well with his students. He continued to teach until his health failed in 1959, when he stepped away from the classroom.\n\nArrived at the College: 1956\n\nBrother Thomas joined Manhattan’s physics department in 1956. He proved a tireless force in improving and updating all research activities and experiments in electronics at the College. In 1958, he published “Electronic Measurements and Electronics,” a laboratory manual designed to support textbooks used in the physics department. He also adapted for student use a manual on analog computers published by Electronic Associates Incorporated. Br. Thomas was a member of such prestigious organizations as the American Association of University Professors, the Association for the Advancement of Engineering Education, the Association of Physics Teachers, and Sigma Pi Sigma, the national physics honor society. The Manhattan College community was shocked and saddened by the news that he suffered a fatal heart attack at only 57 years old.\n\nArrived at the College: 1932\n\nJoining the College faculty in 1932, Brother Anthony taught physics, religion, and mathematics. He was noted for his kindness to students and fellow colleagues. He also helped to improve physics laboratories in the newly constructed Hayden Science Building. During WWII, Br. Anthony dedicated himself to establishing a laboratory that explored advanced electrical equipment; he also spent time fixing radios for the College. A lifelong educator, he moved on from Manhattan after fifteen years, continuing to teach physics at high schools in New York, Rhode Island and New Hampshire. He was also a member of the American Association of Physics Teachers and the Instrument Society of America, now known as the International Society of Automation. With an appreciation for the natural world, Br. Anthony also wrote a well-known account of one of his many trips into the mountains.\n\nArrived at the College: 1939\n\nManhattan College’s Physics department was born with Brother Gabriel’s arrival in 1939. He quickly set about its founding, changing it from a service department to a distinct major with excellent laboratories and a strong esprit de corps. He remained as the department chair until 1960, when he set out to develop at the College’s New York City’s first critical low-power nuclear reactor. In 1964 the reactor became operational and for several years after, Br. Gabe remained its operator and consultant. Later in his career, he received a patent for an electronic calculator for the blind. Br. Gabe authored numerous scientific articles and held membership in several prestigious societies. During his long career he never lost interest in primary research, co-authoring two books and sixteen articles. Twice he won grants from the National Science Foundation for nuclear research; twice he addressed the American Physical Society. Governor Nelson Rockefeller appointed him to the General Advisory Committee on Nuclear Energy and in 1967 named him chair of the Committee for Nuclear Studies. In 1977 the Physics Department created the Brother Gabriel Kane Medal to reward excellence in discipline.\n\nArrived at the College: 1959\n\nBrother Bill Batt had an extensive career at Manhattan College. Arriving in 1959, Br. Bill quickly distinguished himself as a popular professor in the field of biochemistry; he also conducted research on thrombin, an enzyme involved in blood clotting. The National Institute of Health awarded him several grants for research in better treatments of blood disorders and chemical reactions of blood. At Manhattan, Br. Bill went on to wear many hats, including chair of the Chemistry Department and director of admissionsAfter more than a decade in the admissions office, he received a Master’s Degree in Computer Science at Manhattan and continued to teach in the School of Busines, becoming head of that department as well. After a brief appointment as President of St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute, Br. Bill returned to teach at Manhattan in 2005. He remained an eminent scholar all his life.\n\nArrived at the College: 1959\n\nBrother Edward joined the biology faculty at Manhattan College in 1959, launching a 30-year career teaching and advising students who aspired to success as biologists, physicians and dentists. Br. Edward’s most serious concern was that Manhattan remain a great Catholic college and keep its high standards of honesty, integrity, industry and freedom of inquiry. Over the years, he became a close friend of many biologists from other colleges and universities. Shortly before his death, he joined a colleague from the University of Washington’s School of Medicine to co-author a comprehensive study entitled “A Century on Integrating the Biological Sciences.” Although biology was his first love, American history was a close second: he wrote two books on the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.\n\nArrived at the College: 1936\n\nBrother Cyprian James arrived at Manhattan College in 1936 as a biology instructor. In 1947, he was named to succeed Brother Celestine as chair of the department, a post he filled until 1969. As head of biology and chair of the Premedical Advisory Committee, Br. James was responsible for guiding hundreds of young men who aspired to become physicians. During his career, Br. James held memberships in the Entomological Society of America, the American Genetic Society, the American Society for the Advancement of Science, the New York Academy of Science and Sigma Xi. In addition to a series of lab manuals that he wrote for college students, Br. James was co-author with Brothers Gabriel Kane and Alfred Welch of a college textbook in Apologetics entitled \"Foundations of Catholic Belief.\" In 1969, after 23 years as departmental chair, Brother James stepped down to pursue research in marine biology in the Bahamas as part of a program he had inaugurated with the College of Mount St. Vincent. He continued to lecture part time long after retiring.\n\nArrived at the College: 1953\n\nBrother John began teaching mathematics at Manhattan in 1953; only a few years later, he became head of the department. As a member of Sigma Xi, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the Association for Computing Machinery, Br. John spent many years preparing math contests for Catholic secondary schools. He also taught graduate math classes on Saturday mornings and during the summer. When the College decided to install computers, Br. John prepared himself to use software and taught the new discipline. He learned and taught programming, and for a while took stacks of punched cards to another college several times a week to have them processed. Br. John received a number of National Science Foundation (NSF) grants for Institutes in Math and Computer Science at Purdue and New Mexico State. He continued teaching a full schedule of math and computer science until he retired in the late 1980s.\n\nArrived at the College: 1974\n\nArriving at Manhattan in 1974 to teach chemistry, Brother Leo remained until his retirement in 2001. He quickly became an active and dedicated member of the department and a talented and a teacher much loved by his students. In his more than 20 years at the College, Brother Leo held offices in Sigma Xi, the National Research Honor Society, and served as project director of the National Science Foundation CAUSE program. Besides chemistry, Br. Leo loved music and joined the Manhattan Singers. He traveled to Europe with them in the summers throughout the 1980s, and in 1984, they all sang for the Pope.\n\nArrived at the College: 1910\n\nSoon after entering the Christian Brothers in France, Brother Celestine was forced into exile due to the suppression and expulsion of religious from that country. He arrived at the College in 1910 to teach biology and French, but soon exclusively taught the former, having been appointed head of the biologydepartment in 1923. From 1933 to 1939, Br. Celestine also served as dean of the School of Science. He returned to the classroom and laboratory to teach the influx of students that arrived after World War II. While Br. Celestine had always prepared students for medical school, in 1945 he officially organized the Premedical Advisory Committee and served as its first chair. During the next five decades, Brother readied a veritable army of doctors and dental surgeons. In 1952, for example, the Manhattan Alumni Directory listed 265 doctors and 70 dentists whom Br. Celestine prepared for entrance to medical school. Hundreds of other alumni followed his courses in religion and French. Br. Celestine continued to work with students in the histology laboratory at the newly built Hayden Hall until 1960, when he received the Faculty Golden Jubilee Medal in recognition of his half-century of devoted teaching.\n\nArrived at the College: 1970\n\nWhen Brother Kenneth joined the Mathematics department in 1970, little did his new colleagues realize the eventual impact his presence would have on them, the student body and the College as a whole. His expertise in numerical analysis made him especially welcome due to the growing popularity of computer science. Long hours outside of the classroom were devoted to helping students who struggled academically. Underlying Br. Kenneth’s teaching philosophy was the assumption that the initiative in the learning process was a student responsibility. He also supervised the construction of the De La Salle Hall nursing home for Brothers in Lincroft, New Jersey, and the development of the College’s Research and Learning Center. In addition, Br. Kenneth served as moderator of the Gaelic Society at Manhattan College where, in 1981, he founded its pipe band. He was also a delegate to the New York City St. Patrick’s Day Parade. In 2014, a year before his death, The Brother Kenneth Fitzgerald, FSC Restricted Gift Scholarship was established, to be made annually to two students pursuing a bachelor’s degree in mathematics."
