        "text": "Jack Charles Smith was born January 18, 1951 to Jack and Betty Smith of Portage, MI. On October 28, 1972 he married Gretchen Klauss. Jack was employed by The Upjohn Company/Pfizer for 32 years as a journeyman pipefitter. After retirement he worked at Vicksburg Hardware as the Stihl mechanic. Jack passed away on October 26, 2020 after an 8-month battle with cancer. He was brave, never complained or asked why. He knew where he was going as a believer in Jesus Christ. He looked forward to Heaven. Indeed, his faith has been his source of strength and courage. Jack was an avid sportsman looking forward to hunting season each fall. He loved being in the woods and enjoying all of God's creation. He took much pleasure in retelling his hunting escapades. He also enjoyed fishing and time spent with his hunting and fishing buddies. He had many interests and filled his life with action. His was a life well-lived. He was admired by many and passed on his knowledge to all who showed interest. He was kind, fun and intense! His biggest delight was his family. Jack and Gretchen were married 48 years and were devoted to each other. He was so proud of daughters Regan (Pete) and Lauren (Jesse) and delighted in his grandchildren: Claire (12), Willem (9), Charlie (7), and Alora (9 months) and step grandchildren Tucker and Annabelle. His greatest heartache was that he would not be here for them as they grow up. He was called the funny grandpa. He relished this role above all others. He is also survived by his sister Diane. Jack will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved him. Our hearts are broken. Thank you for your inner strength and courage as you faced the hardest days of your life. Your strength gave us strength and your love will see us through. You will be in our hearts always. Due to Covid19, there will be no services at this time. A Celebration of Life will take place in the late spring.\n\nPlease visit Jack's personalized webpage at https://www.langelands.com"
