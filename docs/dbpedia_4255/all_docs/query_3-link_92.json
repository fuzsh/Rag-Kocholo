        "text": "February 18, 2024\n\nOnce upon a time, speaking up for biopharma innovation didn't seem all that important, or even necessary. We didn’t worry about public opinion because the benefits of new therapeutics, the case for continued progress, and the value of medicine to people and society were so clear, there seemed to be no need to promote our ongoing quests to improve health.\n\nWhen our industry did speak, it was typically through drug-specific DTC ads that always ended in those comical speed-reads of adverse reactions. Sick people watching cable reruns and YouTube preroll were well informed of our latest accomplishments.\n\nBut in exclusively targeting the sick, we ignore the healthy people who pay the premiums that fund the insurance plans that pay for novel medicines and fuel the entire biotech ecosystem. If true customers are the ones who provide companies with revenue dollars, then healthy people are our industry’s true customers. Our DTC ads pitch our breakthroughs to patients, but what do we offer our true customers who were also watching but don’t need this or that drug because they are still mostly healthy?\n\nThe answer should be obvious but we’ve long overlooked it. To take a page out of the NFL playbook, consider this: fans LIKE games, but they LOVE the stories behind them – the hard work, rivalries, history, and context that make a game worth watching. For true fans, the wins are just part of the stories and struggles that play out over many games, over many seasons. We invented medicines and marketed the wins, but we didn’t inspire anyone with stories of the journeys. If they don’t see the struggles and losses, the wins aren’t all that interesting.\n\nOf course traditional DTC ads aren’t just about touting wins but also making sure patients get the help they need, but we focused on the utility as if that was the only kind of public relations that mattered. Since healthy people didn’t need our products (yet), we mostly ignored them. But we are starting to see our error.\n\nAbsent hearing about us from us, our customers heard about us from others. The political and cultural conversations about healthcare, access to medicine, and drug costs became polarized, politicized, weaponized. The US population’s trust in science declined. Mass consolidation and vertical integration of insurers and benefit managers forced patients – patients with insurance – to shoulder more of the out-of-pocket (OOP) burden. People got angry, policymakers acted, and we learned the price of our silence. When the IRA imposed price controls on small molecules just nine years after launches, that was our true customers deciding to pay us less. After all, why should they pay more?\n\nFor most of them, the first time they heard from us about R&D and innovation was in our objections to them wanting to pay us less. Where was that message before?\n\nFor the last several years, the RA Capital team has been trying to make up for lost time. We helped found No Patient Left Behind (NPLB) to advocate for affordability and innovation, went on-the-record to promote and protect the US biotech innovation ecosystem, helped build consensus for improvements to existing legislation, called for proper insurance with low out-of-pocket costs, acknowledged the merits of all medicines going generic without undue delay, and helped people understand the true value of medicine. By publishing Community Quest stories in regional newspapers, we worked with scientists and innovators leading our companies to show how their communities were vital to their quests to tackle a particular disease (e.g. through the investments their pension funds make in biotech, by making medicines affordable to patients thanks to the insurance premiums they pay).\n\nOver time, we’ve noticed more and more members of the biotech ecosystem get involved in this effort to inspire the public, both by supporting NPLB and writing their own op-eds.\n\nThen on Sunday, February 4th, a biopharma giant joined in.\n\nSeven days later on Superbowl Sunday, so did another.\n\nOver the course of those seven days, we saw two biopharmas do cannonballs into the collective cultural pool with marketing efforts that just might impact the trajectory of the national conversation about medicine, science, and progress. Game on.\n\nSunday, February 4th: Lilly Gets Better\n\nMaybe you liked it, maybe you didn’t. Not every promising therapy becomes a blockbuster. But whether “Here’s to Science” was subjectively good (it was) is almost beside the point: Pfizer took 123.7 million people on a whirlwind tour of historical scientific quests culminating in an invitation to join Pfizer’s quest to “outdo cancer.” It was a great example of purpose over product and a quantum leap beyond DTC featuring people singing about lowering their A1C in increasingly absurd town squares (though there’s a place for good pharma earworms, too).\n\nA lot more people now know Pfizer is on a quest to cure cancer, that Pfizer is making significant investments in treating and curing cancer, and that Pfizer’s efforts will benefit us all. Viewers are more likely now to mentally link Pfizer to that effort, give Pfizer some credit for shouldering the challenge, and maybe even root for Pfizer to win, because it’s hard to hate on someone who’s just told you they’re trying to cure cancer.\n\nGold star, Pfizer, for re-engaging an increasingly skeptical public (with an assist from Queen) in one of the greatest quests of all time.\n\nBonus: Pfizer gave their employees a reason to be proud of the work they do. One pharma marketing expert told STAT:\n\n“I think that there’s some need to re-engage the public. But I also think it’s more than just the consumers: This is perhaps also a signal to employees of the company who might be wondering, ‘Should we continue to be working for this company?’ to say, ‘Some great things have come out of this company and you’ve got to do great things.’”\n\nPradeep Chintagunta\n\nProfessor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business who specializes in pharmaceutical marketing\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nAfter a slow start, this Superbowl turned out to be one of the best ever (among those that didn’t feature Nick Foles, anyway). KC won in OT, Pfizer found a lot of eyeballs, dads bonded with teenage daughters, memes were born.\n\nOver the course of a week, two biopharma players entered the cultural conversation in big ways with messages that speak to our collective quest, not the usual FYIs of their past accomplishments. Pfizer and Lilly are using their marketing dollars to make the case for continued progress. We’re excited for them and hope more pharma will participate in the critical national conversations about health and biomedical innovation.\n\nMomentum is building and March is coming: who will be next to come off the sidelines? where might their stories appear next? March Madness? The Oscars? Wherever it is, we’re here for it.\n\nAnd stay tuned for more from us about how to make all these new biomedical innovations affordable that (spoiler alert) may change the way you see insurance.\n\nFor anyone who cares about the future of affordable innovation, it’s game time."
