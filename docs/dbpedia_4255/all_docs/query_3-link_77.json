        "text": "PHARMACEUTICAL giant Pfizer has one of the most effective coronavirus vaccines available.\n\nBut who owns Pfizer and where is the company based? Here is everything you'll need to know...\n\nWho owns Pfizer?\n\nPfizer is a Pharmaceutical corporation that was founded in New York City in 1849 by Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart.\n\nThe company does not have one specific owner but rather owned by the people who make up its share registry.\n\nAccording to Investopedia, the top shareholders in Pfizer are Frank A. D'amelio, John Douglas Young, Mikael Dolsten, Vanguard Group Inc., BlackRock Inc. (BLK), and State Street Corp.\n\nWhere is Pfizer located?\n\nPfizer's headquarters is located in New York, USA.\n\nThe company has five locations, working within commercial business, research and development (R&D), manufacturing, packaging and distribution operations, across the UK.\n\nIts UK commercial headquarters are located in Walton Oaks in Surrey and it also has centers in Sandwich, Kent, Havant, Cambridge and Hurley in Berkshire.\n\nWho is the CEO of Pfizer?\n\nThe current CEO of Pfizer is Albert Bourla.\n\nBourla has been working with Pfizer for more than 25 years and has held several senior global positions across a range of markets in the business.\n\nPrior to his position as CEO, Mr Bourla acted as COO in 2018 and served as Group President of Pfizer Innovative Health from 2016 to 2017.\n\nBourla began his career in Pfizer in the Animal Health Division in Greece after receiving a PhD in Veterinary Medicine from the Veterinary School of Aristotle University.\n\nWhat is the Covid vaccine?\n\nOn Wednesday, December 8, 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech announced in a press release that three jabs of their Covid-19 vaccination may be enough to neutralize the Omicron variant of the virus.\n\n\"Although two doses of the vaccine may still offer protection against severe disease caused by the Omicron strain, it's clear from these preliminary data that protection is improved with a third dose of our vaccine,\" Bourla said in a statement.\n\n\"Ensuring as many people as possible are fully vaccinated with the first two dose series and a booster remains the best course of action to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\"\n\nThe vaccine developed by Pfizer is a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine.\n\nConventional vaccines are produced using weakened forms of the virus, but mRNAs use only the virus's genetic code.\n\nAn mRNA vaccine is injected into the body where it enters cells and tells them to create antigens.\n\nThese antigens are recognised by the immune system and prepare it to fight coronavirus.\n\nThe vaccine was tested on over 43K people in six countries and no safety concerns were raised before its rollout.\n\nOn August 23, 2021, Pfizer was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nWhat other medicines and vaccines does Pfizer produce?\n\nPfizer has made many well-known drugs that are used by people every day.\n\nThe corporation's brands include Advil, Viagra, Xanax and include many consumer products including Chapstick.\n\nPfizer has had many triumphs including the discovery of citric acid as well as its mass production of penicillin and vitamin C."
