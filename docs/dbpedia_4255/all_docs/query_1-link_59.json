        "text": "Visitation with people committed to the Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections (DPS&C) is a privilege. Visitation may be restricted, denied or suspended if an imprisoned person and/or visitor does not follow the Department’s visitation rules. Prospective visitors may refer to Department Regulation OP-C-9 for specific rules governing visitation. The regulation may also be obtained by requesting a copy from the facility. Items considered to be contraband, including any type of weapon, firearm or any other item detrimental to the security of the facility, are not allowed. Prohibited items and other personal possessions (wallet, purse, cash, etc.) must be left in the visitor’s locked vehicle for the duration of the visit. The following are rules that a visitor must follow in order to be allowed to visit with a person in prison.\n\n1. Visiting List: In order to visit a person in prison, the visitor must be on the person’s approved visiting list. The imprisoned person has been given information on how to add someone to their visiting list. If you are uncertain as to whether you are on a person in prison’s approved visiting list, please contact the person you wish to visit. Do not call the facility for this information; it will not be provided over the phone.\n\n2. Searches: All visitors, including minors, are subject to searches of their property, automobile and person. These searches shall be conducted by trained staff in a professional manner that minimizes indignity to the visitor while still accomplishing the objective of the search. Additionally, visitors shall be subject to additional searches using metal detectors and ion scanning equipment. Specially trained search dogs (K-9s) may be used as a part of the search process both prior to a visitor entering the visiting area and in the actual visiting room during visits. Any person refusing to be searched at any time shall not be permitted to enter the facility and a visit may be terminated if a visitor refuses to be searched, or if contraband or other prohibited property or items are found on the visitor or in the visitor’s property. If a visitor does not wish to be searched either by hand or by using other means, the visitor should not attempt to enter a DPS&C facility.\n\n3. Registration: Visitors must register with staff prior to entering the visiting area.\n\n4. Identification: All visitors who are 18 years old or older shall be required to show a picture identification each time they visit. The forms of identification accepted by the DPS&C are:\n\nValid driver’s license from the state of residence\n\nValid state photo identification card from the state of residence\n\nValid military photo identification card (active duty only)\n\nValid passport\n\n5. Children: Visitors under the age of 18 years of age must be accompanied by their parent or legal guardian at all times while on facility grounds. Children shall not be left alone at any time while on facility grounds. Parents or legal guardians shall be responsible for the behavior of their children and a visit may be terminated if the children become disruptive.\n\n6. Dress standards: Visitors shall wear clothing that poses no threat to the security or maintenance of order at the facility. The following standards are to be met:\n\nClothing that is similar in appearance to the clothing worn by imprisoned people is prohibited.\n\nClothing that is similar in appearance to the clothing worn by correctional officers, i.e. camouflage, blue BDU’s, etc. is prohibited.\n\nSheer or transparent clothing is not permitted.\n\nSwim suits are not permitted.\n\nSkirts, shorts, skorts, culottes, and dresses must be no shorter than three inches above the kneecap and not have deep or revealing slits.\n\nStrapless, tube and halter tops, tank tops, and strapless dresses are not permitted.\n\nTops that expose the midriff are not permitted.\n\nTight fitting pants, such as stirrup, spandex, lycra, or spandex-like athletic pants, aerobic/exercise tights or leotards shall not be worn.\n\nUndergarments must be worn at all times and cannot be exposed.\n\nClothing with revealing holes or tears higher than one inch above the kneecap is not permitted.\n\nClothing or accessories with obscene or profane writing, images, or pictures is not permitted.\n\nGang or club-related clothing or insignia indicative of gang affiliation is not permitted.\n\nShoes must be worn at all times, except for infants who are carried.

These items, except the baby blanket, must be stored in a single clear plastic container (i.e., gallon size zip-lock bag.) All items are subject to search.\n\n10. Money: Visitors shall not give any money to an imprisoned person. All state correctional facilities utilize JPAY for money deposits to people in prison. JPAY allows family members and friends to make a deposit to an person in prison’s account in a number of ways via U.S. mail, internet, telephone, kiosks at the correctional facility, and Moneygram locations.\n\n11. Contact between people in prison and visitors: People in prison who have contact visits may embrace (hug) and exchange a brief kiss, to indicate fondness, not a lingering kiss, with their visitor at beginning and end of the visit. During the visit, the only contact permitted is holding hands. Excessive displays of affection or sexual misconduct between people in prison and visitors is strictly prohibited. Small children may be permitted to sit on the lap of the visitor or person in prison. Any improper contact between a person in prison and visitor shall be grounds for stopping the visit immediately. Some people in prison are restricted to non-contact visits. In these cases, there shall be no physical contact or touching at all between the person in prison and the visitors. Restroom breaks may be authorized, however, visitors will be subject to the entire search process again.\n\n12. Restrictions on visits with minors:People in prison who have a current or prior conviction for a sex crime involving a minor child family member, or who have a documented history of sex abuse with a minor child family member, are ineligible to visit with any minor child, including their own biological or step-child. People in prison who have a current or prior conviction for a sex crime involving a minor child who is not a family member are ineligible to visit with any minor child. The imprisoned people affected by these restrictions have been informed of possible exceptions that may only be approved by the warden.\n\n13. Generally prohibited: The giving or receiving of any item(s) to/from a person in prison without the prior approval of staff is prohibited. Violators are subject to arrest and criminal prosecution and suspension of visiting privileges. The only exception is that the visitor may purchase soft drinks, snacks or concessions in the visiting area and share them with the person in prison. The person in prison is not permitted to take anything out of the visiting area when the visit is finished, other than with approval as noted above.\n\n14. Visiting hours:See Hours of Operation section for each individual facility on our locations page.\n\n15. Public transportation: Some DPS&C facilities have public transportation available to the facility. Information is provided at the facility to the people in prison if public transportation is available. There may be a cost for use of this transportation and the DPS&C does not endorse or claim any liability for the use of the transportation provider. The visitor may contact the person they wish to visit in prison to obtain specific information regarding any types of transportation that may be available to the facility where the person is housed.\n\n16. Directions: Driving directions may be found on the facility page the visitor wishes to visit.\n\n17. Termination of visits: The warden of the facility or staff designated by the warden may terminate a visit at any time if they believe that ending the visit is in the best interest of the safety and security of the facility or the persons involved.\n\n18.

Request for ADA accommodations: For ADA accommodations, please contact the facility in advance of your visit.\n\nFamily and friends can send funds to people in prison in the following ways:\n\nMail\n\nWalk-up locations for MoneyGram\n\nInternet (including JPay’s mobile app)\n\nTelephone\n\nKiosks\n\nMail\n\nFamily and friends may continue to send money orders via mail. There is no charge for sending money orders via mail. JPay requires a JPay deposit slip to accompany the money order. This deposit is mailed to JPay’s Miami, Florida address. This means that mail time to Florida is probably longer than to a DPS&C facility and that should be taken into account when mailing funds.\n\nAlso, there is a two-day processing time for JPay to put the funds into the DPS&C account. Then, there is a two-day processing time allowance for getting funds into the imprisoned person’s account. The maximum amount that can be sent via mail is $999.99. Deposits of $500 or greater are subject to investigation.\n\nDownload an English money order deposit form here.\n\nDownload a Spanish money order deposit form here.\n\nWalk-up Locations for MoneyGram\n\nMoneyGram is located in Walmart and CVS Pharmacy locations.

There is a 2-day turnaround on funds being placed into the imprisoned person’s account. The maximum amount that can be sent via MoneyGram is $4,999.99. Deposits of $500 or greater are subject to investigation.\n\nInternet\n\nFamily and friends may go online to www.JPay.com and send funds using only Visa and MasterCard credit/debit cards.

Deposits of $500 or greater are subject to investigation. All deposits are still subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by Department Regulation B-09-003 Offender Banking. Regardless of which method of payment family and friends are using to transmit deposits to people in prison, all deposits totaling $500 or greater will continue to be investigated and will delay funds being available to the imprisoned person until the investigation is completed."
