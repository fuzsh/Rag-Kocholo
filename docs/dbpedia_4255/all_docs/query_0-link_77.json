        "text": "A1 Human dirofilariosis in Europe: basic facts and retrospective review\n\nF Simón1, V Kartashev2,3, J González-Miguel1, A Rivera1, A Diosdado1, PJ Gómez1, R Morchón1, M Siles-Lucas4\n\n1Laboratory of Parasitology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, 37007, Spain; 2Rostov State Medical University, Rostov-na-Donu, 344022, Russia; 3North Caucasus Research Veterinary Institute, Novocherkassk, 346421, Russia; 4Laboratory of Parasitology, IRNASA, CSIC, Salamanca, 37008, Spain\n\nCorrespondence: F Simón (fersimon@usal.es)\n\nIn Europe domestic and sylvatic canines and felines are the reservoirs of Dirofilaria immitis and D. repens, while different culicid mosquito species act as vectors of these species. Many mosquito species feed indiscriminately on animal reservoirs and man, thus where there is canine dirofilariosis, the risk of zoonotic infections exists. There are three forms of human dirofilariosis: Pulmonary dirofilariosis (PD), usually causing a solitary pulmonary nodule attributed to D. immitis; subcutaneous dirofilariosis (SD) manifesting as subcutaneous nodules located in different parts of the body and ocular dirofilariosis (OD) in which worms cause nodules or remain unencapsulated in the eye area, being the last two variants mainly caused by D. repens. Most of the information on human dirofilariosis is generated by the clinical cases reported and their retrospective review, but there is very scarce other kind of studies. In Europe continues the sharp increase of SD/OD cases unlike the extremely low number of reports of PD cases, without being able to indicate the objective causes of this fact, since both species are present in animal reservoirs of the continent. Most of these cases have been reported in Ukraine and the Russian Federation [1], although a significant number were detected in recent years in Belarus, Balkan and central European countries. The increase in case reports revealed new locations and clinical implications, which are forcing to reassess the prognosis and severity of many cases. Molecular techniques established that worms of D. repens with ocular localization are genetically identical to those located in the subcutaneous tissue and the participation of D. immitis in OD in Ukraine, where this species seems to be the causal agent of the ocular variant in the 13.8% of cases. The routine application of non-invasive techniques such as ultrasound and Doppler helps to establish a rapid prognosis and diagnosis, consistent with the non-malignant nature of nodules in both SD and OD. Studies using \"in vitro\" cultures of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells have demonstrated the ability of some Dirofilaria molecules to activate the fibrinolytic system and enhance the generation of plasmin. Plasmin plays a dual role contributing to remove thrombi, but also participating in the stimulation of mechanisms leading to villous endarteritis, such as cell proliferation and migration [2]. Although not specifically focused on human dirofilariosis, these studies can contribute to a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of human dirofilariosis.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Clinical problems of human dirofilariasis become an issue and need be thoroughly analyzed. A patient self-assessment, the parasite anatomical location and clinical manifestation determine diagnostic workup. Five patients with peritonitis were operated immediately and Dirofilaria was unexpectedly found in peritoneal cavity. In contrast – five patients with “silent” pulmonary dirofilariasis were diagnosed late and accidentally. Affected eye (37% of all patients, variations 22 – 48% in different years) in the case of a foreign “moving entity” in an eye or eyelid conjunctiva (19%) or with eye acute inflammation (25%) strongly motivated a patient to visit a doctor in the contrast with patients with slowly growing “silent” nodule (56%). Anyway as many as 86% of the patients with eye located Dirofilaria were addressed to a doctor during the first month of the disease. Nearly equal proportion of patients (around 62%) with head (28%), or trunk (12%), or man’s genitalia (3%) located parasite also visited a doctor in the first month of the disease. Female patients with breast location (3%) were consulted earlier and were undergone surgery in short time (in the first 2 weeks) mostly because the main diagnostic hypothesis was breast cancer. In the cases of extremities located parasitic nodule (hands – 9.4%, legs – 8.6%) only 31% and 36% of patients (accordingly) decided to be consulted by a doctor in the first month from the onset because they did not regard their condition as life-threatening. The next important issue is doctor information about dirofilariasis, his specialty and previous experience. Everything had great influence on timely and correct diagnosis or at least on inclusion of dirofilariasis in the list of diagnostic hypotheses. In the territories with sporadic morbidity only few doctors (7%) suspected dirofilariasis before surgery – they mostly diagnosed benign or malignant tumors (72%). There is a contrast with endemic territories where dirofilariasis was suspected by doctors in the much higher proportion of the patients (85%). Preliminary ultrasound and color Doppler examination of patients with dirofilariasis made great input in the diagnosis. The findings include hypoechoic encapsulated linear structures without internal blood vessels and sometimes (47%) with detectable movement of the parasite. Those findings allowed to exclude malignancies before surgery in all ultrasound examined patients. Medical community has to be better informed about dirofilariasis. Ultrasound should be a standard procedure in patients with subcutaneous nodules.\n\nA3 A few thoughts about the recent epidemiological situation of dirofilariosis in Hungary with particular regard to quick spread and high prevalences in certain areas\n\nÉva Fok1, István Kucsera2\n\n1Department of Parasitology and Zoology, University of Veterinary Science, István utca 2., H-1078 Budapest, Hungary; 2Department of Parasitology, National Center for Epidemiology, Albert Flórián út 2-6., H-1097 Budapest, Hungary\n\nCorrespondence: Éva Fok (hanavica.fok13@gmail.com)\n\nDirofilariosis is an emerging zoonosis in Hungary. The first autochthonous Dirofilaria repens infection of dogs were diagnosed in the end of the 90’s, then soon in 2007 the first dog infected with D. immitis was detected and in 2010 a pet ferret case was published, too. A first comprehensive countrywide survey showed that most of D. repens infected dog cases (prevalence: 18-46%) occurred in the eastern part of Hungary, namely on the Great Hungarian Plain along the Tisza river and its branches [1]. The findings of this earlier study were partly confirmed by later surveys [2, 3, 5], but these studies mainly focused on the heartworm incidence. It is stated [5] that the climate of the Great Hungarian Plain is the most suitable region for the establishment of D. immitis in Hungary. Although sporadic cases in wild canines (such as foxes and jackals) and domestic dogs also occur in other regions of the country it is slightly worrying that the main habitat of D. immitis might be in Szeged town or in the Southern Great Hungarian Plain. This assumption may strengthen by earlier (unpublished) and newer necropsy records [5]. Moreover the first molecular screening of the vector mosquitoes collected in Szeged revealed that not only D. immitis was present in the specimens but also DNA of D. repens [4]. So far, in Hungary human dirofilariosis is caused by D. repens. Since the first reported human case, 115 further episodes were diagnosed in Hungary [6]. Evaluation of the territorial distribution of human episodes revealed that most infections occurred in patients living in the Danube-Tisza interflow region and eastern part of the country. The spread of the “greenhouse effect” lead to the extension of the Mediterranean climatic belt to the north giving better opportunities for both vectors and worms to thrive and spawn infection. A close cooperation not only with the parasitologists, but also between practicing veterinarians and medical doctors is necessary to organise the control against both Dirofilaria species.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Both species are known to be zoonotic. Dirofilaria repens and D. immitis seem associated with climate change and a spread from historically endemic countries in Southern Europe to Central Europa was observed. Until very recently both species were known not to be endemic in Austria [1]. In Austria most cases of Dirofilaria spp. in humans and dogs are introduced. However, rarely infections with D. repens were discussed to be autochthonous. The introduction of D. repens to Austria was confirmed within a mosquito surveillance in Burgenland (Eastern Austria) for the first time in its vector [2,3,4]. We summarize not only introduced and possible autochthonous cases of Dirofilaria sp. in humans, dogs and vectors in Austria, but will also present data of mosquito screenings conducted after the first findings of D. repens in Anopheles algeriensis and the An. maculipennis-complex [3]. Moreover novel diagnostic tools for these filarioid helminths will be presented.\n\nThis study was funded by the ERA-Net BiodivERsA, with the national funders FWF I-1437, ANR-13-EBID-0007-01 and DFG BiodivERsA KL 2087/6-1 as part of the 2012-13 BiodivERsA call for research proposals.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

In the past decade several studies have been performed on its diagnosis, treatment and prevention, but knowledge on vector competence of Central European mosquito species for D. immitis under local climate conditions is still scarce.\n\nThe aim of this study was therefore to analyze the vector competence of three different mosquito species (Aedes vexans, Ae. geniculatus and Culex pipiens biotype molestus, endemic in Serbia and Switzerland) for D. immitis at constant and realistic fluctuating temperature regimes under laboratory conditions.\n\nMosquitoes were kept in the laboratory at 24-27 °C, with 85% of humidity and fed with sugar solution. Six groups of female mosquitoes (30-52 individuals), were fed with blood containing D. immitis microfilariae (6,000 mf/ml) obtained from a naturally infected dog using artificial feeding methods (Hemotek, a blood sausage, cotton stick method). After inoculation, blood fed mosquitoes were incubated at constant or realistic fluctuating temperature of 27 °C (17.5-35 °C, with average 27 °C). Parameters determined were: feeding rate, infectious dose, mortality rate, infection rates and infectivity rates. Mosquitoes were dissected under a stereomicroscope on days 2, 4, 7, 10, 14 post inoculation (p.i.), to observe the developmental stages of the filariae. Additionally, PCR analysis was performed. The feeding rate ranged from 26% in Cx pipiens biotype molestus to 61-63% in Ae.vexans groups and to 74% in Ae.geniculatus. The observed infectious dose was 7-10 microfilaria in Ae.vexans. No live microfilariae could be observed in the other species in samples taken on day 1 p.i. Mortality rate was rather high, it was altogether, 78% during the 14 days of incubation period and ranged from 12.5% in Cx.pipiens biotype molestus fed with cotton stick to 100% in those fed with Hemotek. The highest percentage (73.9%) of mosquitoes died until day 4 p. i (feeding). In Ae.geniculatus and Ae.vexans groups, microfilariae were found until day 7 p.i., L1 from day 4-10p.i. and L2 were found only in Ae.vexans groups on day 10. In Cx.pipens biotype molestus no larval stages were found by microscopy. PCR analysis revealed the highest number of specimens positive for Dirofilaria in Ae.vexans, kept at constant 27 °C. All of the Cx pipiens biotype molestus mosquitoes that died during the experiment were PCR positive. Female mosquitoes developing infectious L3 stages (infectivity rates), L3 were identified only in Ae. vexans at day 14 p.i. Total infection rates (microscopy and PCR) were 72% for Ae vexans kept at constant 27 °C, 56.6% for Ae vexans kept at 27 °C fluctuating, 70% for Ae. geniculatus and 37.5% for Cx pipiens biotype molestus fed with the Hemotek. To conclude, vector competence for D. immitis was shown for the flood water mosquito Ae. vexans both at constant and fluctuating 27 °C. The respective results were not yet conclusive for Cx pipiens biotype molestus and Ae.geniculatus and further studies will be necessary with these species.\n\nA9 Use of histochemical analysis for updates about canine filarioids upon new cases in two dog shelters in the surrounding of Bucharest, Romania\n\nCristian-Ionut CN Florea1,2, Poliana Gh Tudor1, Stefan P Olaru2, Anca M Dobrica2\n\n1Department of Parasitology and Parasitic Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Agronomical Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, Bucharest, 050097, Romania; 2Praxis Vetlife, Bucharest, Romania, 021374\n\nCorrespondence: Cristian-Ionut CN Florea (florea_christian@yahoo.com)\n\nDogs represent the main natural reservoir for numerous helminths, including some species of filaria that have microfilariaes circulating in the blood flow. Of these, the most known canine filarioid species are Dirofilaria immitis, D. repens, Acanthocheilonema reconditum and A. drancunculoides transmited by different vectors (i.e. mosquitoes, fleas, lice and ticks) [1]. In Romania, stray dogs still remain an unsolved issue, despite the efforts made by the authorities in the attempt to gather and place them in shelters towards adoption. The aim of this study is the screening of the infestation with filarioids in new cases brought in two enroled dog shelters surrounding Bucharest, Romania. During November 2014 and October 2015, 282 stray dogs have been brought in two shelters near Bucharest and have been tested. Morphometric analysis of microfilariae canine blood from the enrolled dogs were made by Knott’s modified test. For the detection of the D. immitis antigens it was used an in-clinic rapid assay test based on enzyme immunoassay technique (SNAP® 4Dx®, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME, USA). The identification of the species was made by a histochemical technique to demonstrate acid phophatase activity patterns in the microfilariae, using a comercial kit test (Leucognost SP®, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Out of 282 enrolled dogs, 32.62% (n = 92) were positive for at least one filarial species. The modified Knott’s test showed the presence of circulating microfilariae in 78 samples (27.66%), and the serum of 67 samples was positive for D. immitis antigens using an immunoenzymatic assay. As a result of the histochemical technique there were identified three species of microfilariae and the global prevalence was 23.76% (n = 67) D. immitis, 9.57% (n = 27) D. repens and 0.71% (n = 2) Acanthocheilonema spp. In addition, coinfection with D. immitis and D. repens was found in four samples. Morphometric evaluation showed the following measurements of the length and width of microfilariae: 298.27/5.9 μm of D. immitis, 358.81/7.2 μm of D. repens and 264/4.6 μm of Acanthocheilonema spp. The results of this study highlight the presence of three species of filarioids from the dogs brought to the enrolled shelters with a high prevalence of D. immitis (23.75%). This raises public health concern that merits more consideration by both veterinarians and physicians.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Since first cases were diagnosed almost 10 years ago, now the infection is considered as an increasing epidemiological problem. The extensity of infection in some areas in Poland was estimated over 12-36% [1,2] within the local dogs’ populations. Veterinarians have found this infection as a real threat, so general aim of this research was to find objective features of the infection which could be used to establish the treatment algorithm for vets. The investigation was based on cases reported to Small Animal Clinic of the Warsaw Faculty of Veterinary Medicine as well as of those admitted to other veterinary clinics of Warsaw area. There were 428 dogs preselected (suspected for dirofilariosis) included to this research. Animals underwent physical examinations and blood tests (morphology and biochemistry). At the end of the study results of this preselected group were compared with results obtained from finally diagnosed – infected dogs. Microfilariae were found in 42.8% of examined dogs. Subsequently, PCR and ELISA tests were performed to confirm the infection in possibly infected ones. PCR with differential primers was performed to reveal parasite DNA in blood [3]. ELISA tests were based on adult D. repens somatic antigens to detect specific IgG in infected dogs. PCR revealed the additional 8.8% infected dogs. PCR tests also confirmed that all individuals were infected with D. repens. Results of ELISA indicate that D. repens infection results in high specific IgG titers in more than 80% of infected dogs. ELISA allowed to diagnose over 1/3 additional infected individuals, which have been previously found negative (by blood smear). The blood morphology and biochemistry revealed statistically significant erythropenia, limphopenia, thrombocytopenia, reduced haematocrit, and increased levels of alkaline phosphatase and creatinine in infected dogs. Results suggest that infection is associated with general symptoms and problems of liver and kidneys.\n\nAdditionally, the comparison between infected and not-infected groups showed that skin dirofilariosis was more often (2.6x) found in dogs which did not received any anti ecto-parasite treatment. The results were used to set up the treatment algorithm for practitioners who are not familiar with this newly emerged disease. It is allowed to suspect infection when similar blood results are obtained, and afterwards PCR and ELISA should be performed to check false-negative patients. It is concluded that such algorithm may help in prevention of this zoonotic infection in Poland.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Osińska B, Demiaszkiewicz AW, Pyziel AM, Kuligowska I, Lachowicz J, Dolka I.

In order to evaluate the perception of veterinarians on the prevalence and their experience on diagnosis, treatment and prevention of HW, a questionnaire survey was designed. The questionnaire was distributed by e-mail to the veterinary practitioners registered to the two major Hellenic veterinary scientific societies. Twenty questions were included, investigating the frequency of HW in each practice and the routinely implemented strategies on diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Until today, 134 questionnaires have been completed; 51.5% from the Northern and Central Greece (NCG) and 48.5% from the rest of the country (RC, continental and insular). The percentage of veterinarians reporting that they see at least one HW case per month, trimester, semester and year was 22.3%, 18.5%, 16.1% and 16.9%, respectively, while no cases of HW was reported from 26.1% of the participants. The criteria for suggesting prevention included the geographical area where the animal lived (88.8%), its lifestyle (72%), breed (13%), and the owner’s compliance (41.1%). Most of the veterinarians (61%) suggest prevention measures all year round, while some (35.5%) only during the warm season of the year. Regarding treatment, 50% of the veterinarians consider as first choice the protocol endorsed by the American Heartworm Society (AHS) and the European Scientific Counsel Companion Animal Parasites (ESCCAP), while 16% apply a “slow kill” protocol. For the prevention of pulmonary thromboembolism 84% of the veterinarians suggest strict activity restriction, 67% administer prednisolone while 28% use aspirin.\n\nThere is a recorded difference of awareness of HW between the NCG and RC veterinarians that could be attributed to the indication of higher prevalence of HW in NCG. Indeed, only 10.3% of the NCG veterinarians report absence of HW in their area, while the corresponding percentage in RC is 40.9%. In NCG, 73.5% of the veterinarians suggest appropriate preventive measures (endorsed by the AHS and the ESCCAP) while in RC only 42.4% suggest such measures. Moreover, 85.3% of NCG veterinarians advise HW prevention for all dogs, while the respective percentage in RC is only 12.1%. These results suggest that although the majority of small animal practitioners in Greece appear to generally comply with the updated guidelines on the prevention and treatment of HW, the geographical area-based perceived risk for HW substantially affects the preventive strategy implemented.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Additionally, early developing stages of the heartworm, Dirofilaria immitis, are rarely reported in subcutaneous localization from humans and dogs. To our knowledge, evidence of this condition has not been described in the cat yet, even if the feline host can be affected either by the classic adult-related heartworm form or heartworm-associated respiratory disease (HARD) caused by immature stages. A 2 year- old, spayed male cat was presented for three subcutaneous nodules on the head and trunk. The cat lived in Northern Italy and was regularly vaccinated and treated monthly with an antiparasitic spot on formulation containing selamectin (Stronghold®, Pfizer). One of the three nodules was surguically excided and examined. Histology showed in the subcutis the presence of a nodular lesion characterized by a severe inflammatory infiltrated composed by macrophages, small lymphocytes, with fewer eosinophils and mast cells, supported by a proliferation of mature fibroblasts (fibrosis). Inflammatory cells were multifocally surrounding sections of parasites identified as nematodes. The parasites were characterized by a thick cuticle with a smooth external surface, prominent and large lateral chords and a polymyarian-coelomyarian musculature. Microscopic features were compatible with D. immitis morphology. [2] After extraction from the paraffin block, DNA of the parasite was amplified with a PCR (ribosomal 5.8S-ITS2-28S region), the PCR product were purified, cloned and thereafter sequenced. A BLAST search revealed 97% identitiy to D. immitis isolate EU182331 and only 79% of identity the next related sequence of Dirofilaria genus (D. repens). The cat tested negative for D. immitis antigenemia and the two remaining nodules disappeared spontaneously in a few months. Identification of a filaroid nematode with smooth cuticles in the subcutaneous tissues can be challenging. All species of the genus Dirofilaria are characterized by cuticular ridges, except from D. immitis and D. lutrae [2], with the latter described so far only in USA in the North American river otter. The parasite in the present case most likely represents an immature stage of D. immitis which developed in the subcutis (L3-L4) and was successively entrapped in this localization. The immunity of the cat, which is not a suitable definitive host for D. immits, likely played a role in preventing migration of the immature stage to the pulmonary arteries.\n\nTo author’s knowledge this is the first reported case of subcutaneous localization of D. immits in a feline host.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

A lot of suburban and rural areas may have overall prevalences up to 50% in dogs, and treating them is of great concern for veterinarians in the field. Two limitations make adulticide treatment almost impossible: 1. Immiticide® is not available on the Serbian market and ordering it abroad is expensive for the majority of owners whose dogs are confirmed as Heartworm (HW) positive; 2. It is very difficult, especially in the countryside to do appropriate diagnostics (echocardiography) in order to estimate prognosis after melorsamine treatment. Therefore, the „slow kill“ treatment is the only reliably choice for the majority of veterinarians in the field. We have gathered data about HW positive dogs from eleven general practises. The total number of antigen positive dogs was 258. Owners of only 105 dogs were interested to treat their pets. Seven of them have stoped visiting their veterinarians after one month, and 32 dogs with severe disease (respiratory distress, right sided heart failure, caval sindrome) died within the first 3 months after diagnostistics. A total number of 66 dogs, with mild and moderate disease, have continued with „slow- kill“ treatment. Schedule for treatment was intermittent application of doxicyclin (10 mg/kg every third month) and prophylactic dose of ivermectin (10 mcg/kg every 15 days). Therapy was given until the first negative antigen test. During the first 3 months 9 (13.64%) patients became antigen negative, between 3 and 6 months 3 (4.54%), between 6 and 9 months 29 (43.94%) and 14 (21.24%) between 9 and 12 months; 11 (16.64%) dogs become negative after more than 12 months. All dogs from the last group did not visit veterinarians regularly and were not on continuous therapy. We also want to remark that a lot of dogs in the study were not tested each month. Most of them were retested twice annualy, due to financial capabilities of their owners. Data from the study shows frequent owners neglecting to do any further dignostics and treatment of their HW positive dogs in suburban and rural areas. Those dogs persist as a reservoir for the disease. This fact demands more active education of the owners. On the other hand, dogs of committed owners, with mild and moderate disease, which are going to „slow kill“ treatment, have a good chance to be cured.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Since then, Dirofilaria infection was repeatedly reported in dogs [2] and, recently, D. repens was detected also in mosquitoes [3] and in humans [4]. The presence of D. immitis in the Czech Republic was established only on detection of antigen using the commercially available test. In past 10 years, detection of D. immitis microfilariae, PCR detection or clinical case of canine dirofilariosis caused by D. immitis were not reported from the Czech Republic. The aim of presented survey was to confirm or exclude the autochthonous infection of D. immitis in dogs from the Czech Republic and to determine the extent of endemic distribution of D. repens within the Czech Republic. A total number of 392 blood samples from dogs were examined using the modified Knott test, IDEXX SNAP® 4Dx® test and PCR amplifying the fragment of COI gene of filarial nematodes [5]. Only D. repens was detected by Knott test and /or by PCR with prevalence 6.4% (25/392). Six out of 25 positively diagnosed dogs had no travel history outside the Czech Republic, so the autochthonous infection was proven in 3.4% animals. Almost all positive dogs had originated from Southern Moravia region except a single one, which was from Zlín region, 100 km north of other positive localities. D. repens prevalence demonstrated in our sample set is lower than previously published (9–24%), however, distribution of positive animals corresponds well with published presence of D. repens positive mosquitoes and with occurrence of cases of autochthonous human dirofilariosis from the same region. Our study confirmed the endemic occurrence of D. repens in the region of Southern Moravia in the Czech Republic. Importantly, no D. immitis was detected. Based on these results, and considering total absence of published clinical cases, microfilariae or PCR detection of D. immitis in the Czech Republic, we strongly recommend not to consider the Czech Republic as currently endemic for this parasite.\n\nThis study was supported by COST CZ LD14048; survey was organized in the framework of the EurNegVec COST Action TD1303.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

All dogs had a history either originating from an endemic country or staying abroad for a certain time. Dogs were identified by accidental finding of microfilaria in blood or urine samples or by the directed detection of adult D. immitis or D. repens [1, 2]. From 2008 on case numbers increased rapidly regarding both infections. The typical origin from Mediterranean countries in dogs with heartworm disease has been replaced by the origin from Eastern countries, led by far by cases from Hungary (Fig. 1). Several animal welfare associations located in Austria financially support foreign animal shelters in neighbouring countries and organize dog importation to Austria and Germany on a large scale. Unfortunately, most of these animals are not tested for dirofilariosis prior to importation and they are not protected by microfilarizides to avoid local transmission to mosquitos. First canine cases of D. repens infections with probable autochthonous background have been diagnosed in Austria in 2008 [3]. In 2014 first detection of D. repens in vector mosquitos has been reported [4] and confirmed by additional autochthonous canine cases. An obvious increase of imported dogs from eastern countries to Austria has been recognized within the last five years, concurrently canine heartworm disease cases increased markedly, too (Fig. 2). Several criteria turned out to be important in the consultation talk to the dog’s owner for the decision to have these animals on therapy:\n\n1)\n\nSeveral animal welfare association members refuse heartworm therapy in dogs due to possible side effects. Side effects and lethality rates were massively overstated and erroneously reported to the owners.\n\n2)\n\nEstimated costs are high, especially when following the guidelines from the American Heartworm Society\n\n3)\n\nNone of the owners was informed about the possible influence of importing infected dogs to Austria regarding endemicity and zoonotic hazards.\n\nTo offer a safe and affordable therapeutic regime, a modified scheme has been introduced to these animals including two injections of melarsomine three days apart, and oral medication of macrocyclic lactones and doxycyclin. Transmission risk was reduced immediately and 22/26 became negative in the antigen test within 4-8 months after melarsomine injections. Informing and advising animal welfare associations and dog owners as well as identification of imported and infected animals and the rapid onset of a safe therapy is the only way to delay or even avoid heartworm disease becoming endemic in Austria.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Wild canids constitute a reservoir for many vector-borne diseases, by harbouring their vector-transmitted etiological agents [1, 2]. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are the most abundant wild carnivores in Europe, their populations are increasing and they are invading many urban areas due to a good adaptation to human environments [1]. Portugal is an endemic country for dirofilariosis in domestic dogs [3], although information on the occurrence of D. immitis in wild canids is sparse. An epidemiological survey was conducted to investigate the prevalence of D. immitis in red foxes from Portugal and to evaluate their potential role in the epidemiology of dirofilariosis. Blood (n = 94) or meat juice (n = 25) were obtained from 119 wild red fox carcasses shot during the official hunting season or killed on the road due to traffic accidents between 2008 and 2010. These animals came from eight districts of northern (Braga, Bragança, Porto, Viana do Castelo and Vila Real), central (Aveiro) and southern Portugal (Évora and Setúbal). D. immitis circulating antigens were detected using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigen kit, (WITNESS® Dirofilaria; Synbiotics, Europe). Out of the 119 foxes, 10 (8.4%; CI: 4.1-14.9%) were found infected with D. immitis, with positive animals found in five districts (Braga, Bragança, Évora, Viana do Castelo and Vila Real), in northern and southern areas of Portugal. One of the samples that were positive to D. immitis was obtained with meat juice, a finding which suggests that it could be used as an alternative sample to serum for the antigen detection of antigen, in post-mortem analysis. The present report demonstrates that infection with D. immitis is prevalent in red fox populations in Portugal, showing an increase of prevalence compared with recent reports [4, 5] and suggesting a role of these animals as potential reservoir hosts for domestic pets and even to humans. Given the complex interaction between wildlife and domestic animals, humans and parasites, a robust health risk surveillance assessment should be implemented in Portuguese fox population to allow a better management of its vector-borne infections and diseases, in line with the 'One Health' concept.\n\nFunding\n\nPhD Research Grant SFRH/BD/85427/2012; Projects UID/CVT/00276/2013 CIISA-FMV-ULisboa and GHTM-UID/Multi/04413/2013, supported by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT), Portugal.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

However, data on cardiopulmonary dirofilariosis, a zoonotic mosquito-borne disease that is potentially lethal to companion animals, is non-existent. To assess the potential occurrence of infection with Dirofilaria immitis in canids, 103 domestic dogs presented to a veterinary medical centre in Luanda were evaluated. Luanda was chosen as it is both the capital and the largest city in the country. Based on physical examination and clinicopathological data, 50 dogs were classified as apparently healthy and 53 as clinically suspected of a canine vector-borne disease. The population tested comprised 62 males and 41 females, with ages ranging from 3 months to 14 years (median: 1.0 year; interquartile range: 0.6-4.0). A commercially available D. immitis antigen test (WITNESS® Dirofilaria; Synbiotics, Europe) was used. Plasma was heat treated (at 103 °C for 10 min in a dry heat block and the resultant clot was centrifuged) to destroy potential blocking antibodies or inhibitors, favouring accurate diagnosis [3]. Out of the 103 dogs tested, none was positive in the antigen test. Commercially available D. immitis antigen kits are highly specific and sensitive diagnostic methods, recommended for mass population screening [4]. Despite the various pathogens previously described in this population [1, 2], D. immitis antigen were not found in any of these dogs. D. immitis has already been reported in other sub-Saharan African countries, including Kenya [5], Mozambique [6] and Zambia [7], although to the best of the authors’ knowledge there is no report of D. immitis in Angola. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the existence of D. immitis or another related species (Dirofilaria repens, for example) that is not detectable with this routine test. Unfortunately, no blood was available to perform the modified Knott’s technique to assess potential microfilaremia. Considering the zoonotic risk of this parasite and the presence of potential vectors, further studies are needed to characterize the current epidemiological scenario of filarial species in vertebrate hosts and vector insects in Angola.\n\nFunding\n\nPhD Research Grant SFRH/BD/85427/2012; Projects UID/CVT/00276/2013 CIISA-FMV-ULisboa and GHTM-UID/Multi/04413/2013, supported by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT), Portugal.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

This was the case in a 20 month-old Tosa dog that came to the surgery consultation of the Small Animals Veterinary Hospital of Alfort, France in February 2016. The dog had a subcutaneous skin nodule on the head. The medical imaging examination, performed the day of the consultation, showed a well-defined nodule of 1.5 cm of large and 5 mm of depth, with several hyperechoic lines inside. The nodule was punctured with a small needle and polynuclear granulocytes as well as microfilariae were detected, after staining. Blood analysis revealed the presence of microfilariae both in the smear and in the sediment following the Knott technique (mean 176 larvae/mL). After the surgical removal of the skin nodule, one nematode of 8 cm of length was found inside, identified by means of PCR (ITS) as Dirofilaria repens. Blood analysis performed 6 weeks later, in the absence of any treatment, demonstrated a decrease of microfilariemia of 22%. The dog was imported from South of Romania, at the age of 3 months, and since then, the dog never left Ile de France region. Since both in Romania and in Ile de France region, several cases of subcutaneous dirofilariosis have been described so far in dogs and cats, it is not possible to identify with certainty the place where the initial contamination occurred. However the region of south Romania, where the dog was born is highly endemic for mosquitoes.\n\nA19 Serological survey of Dirofilaria in humans from Romania and Republic of Moldova\n\nLavinia Ciuca1, Rodrigo Morchón2, Ruxandra V.

The high prevalence of both Dirofilaria species in dogs in Romania represent a constant threat for animal and public health. However, only few cases of human infections by D. repens have been reported from various regions of Romania so far. In the present study a serological screening was performed on a cohort of patients from Romania (n = 187) and Republic of Moldova (n = 263) for a total of 450 patients (166 male and 284 females; aged 7 to 78 years). Sera samples were collected from December 2015 to March 2016 and analyzed by a non-commercial IgG-ELISA for the detection of IgG anti-D. immitis and anti-D. repens. Of 187 patients from Romania 13 (6.9%) were positive for D. immitis, and only one patient reacted against both antigens of D. immitis and D. repens. Of 263 patients from Republic Moldova, 36 (13.6%) were positive for D. immitis and three (1.4%) patients recognized both antigens. Only one patient was found positive for IgG-anti D. repens. Moreover the results from the present study were confirmed by Western blot analysis, which gives even greater support to these results. Our results confirmed the public health significance and zoonotic impact of Dirofilaria infections in Romania and the Republic of Moldova. Considering that the main resevoir is represented by the microfilaremic dogs and the infections are transmitted by mosquitoes, entomological surveillance and monitoring of dogs are needed in both countries, in order to define the risk areas of infection.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The litter consisted of 3 female and 4 male kittens. The age of kittens was estimated around 8 weeks. During physical examination all of them were found in poor condition. The family was severely infested with fleas. Fecal examination results showed that the queen was infected with Toxocara sp., Ancylostoma sp., and Dipyllidium sp., and the offspring with roundworms and hookworms. Some of the kittens manifested diarrhea and also conjunctivitis was noticed. A blood sample was collected from the adult cat to check its general status. During the examination some individual microfilariae were found. Blood samples were then taken from three kittens and blood smears revealed the presence of single microfilariae in two of them. Regarding the severity of the circumstances the veterinarian decided to apply moxidectin/imidacloprid topical solution (Advocate®, Bayer) and other necessary treatment. Two days later the veterinarian contacted our laboratory in the Division of Parasitology at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. We asked for blood and serum samples which were then taken from the queen and the kittens and delivered to our laboratory. In order to confirm the infection genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and PCR was performed [1]. PCR product specific for D. repens was amplified only in the sample originating from the queen which was taken before treatment. In queen and kitten blood samples which were taken after treatment PCR results were unambiguous. The presence of D. repens specific antibodies in all examined sera was confirmed by ELISA. The highest titer was noted in queen serum (1/25600). Titers in kitten sera were lower and ranged from 1/3200 to 1/800. Vertical transmission of filarial infections is uncommon. Only few cases of transplacental transmission of microfilariae have been reported: Brugia phanangi in the cat [2], Dirofilaria immitis in the dog [3], Wuchereria bancrofti and Onchocerca volvulus in humans [4, 5]. Our results allow to hypothesize that D. repens vertical transmission occurred in investigated cats. At the same time, it is very unlikely that kittens had been infected by another way at this age. In conclusion, there are many questions to be answered. What was the actual route of transmission in this particular case? What is the pattern of immune response against D. repens in cats? More research should be conducted in order to provide the adequate control measures to prevent skin dirofilariosis in pets and humans.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Recently, the parasite was identified by molecular techniques in Culex pipiens and Aedes vexans in Serbia [4]. About 37 cases of superficial (subcutaneous and eye infections) and visceral infections were reported in Serbia till 2015 with predominant subcojnunctival and periocular infestation. Aim of this paper is to report new D. repens infections diagnosed in our country, and to address attention that this mostly benign infection may have serious clinical course. We present three cases of human dirofilariasis, two autochthonous and one imported, diagnosed from February 2015 till April 2016. All patients were adults, one male and two females, two with subcutaneous infection on the limbs and one with infection of the eye. The male patient, 57 years old is a resident of Belgrade who frequently travelled to Novi Pazar which is located in the southern part of Serbia. He presented with five days history of pain, swelling and redness on the anterior part of the right thigh (6 ˣ 12 cm) near inguinal area, temperature 38 ° C and eosinophilia (10.3). According to the clinical picture and ultrasound findings phlegmona and cellulites were diagnosed and ceftriaxone (2 g IV 5 days) was prescribed. Although pain and redness disappeared, and nodular swelling was clearly defined (5 cm), needle puncture was performed and white thread like 8 cm long mass was extracted and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (100 mg twice/day for 15 days) was prescribed. Diagnosis of a D. repens infection was made in pathohistological preparations and the infectiologist prescribed ivermectin (200mcg/kg PO once). He has been on follow-up for two months without any signs of recurrence. At the ocular case, a 64 year old woman from Belgrade was presented with history of progressive swelling, redness, pain and unpleasant feeling in the right eye conjunctival area. Under ophthalmic examination mass with thin, very active and movable worm wrapped in circles was found. The 8 cm worm was surgically removed under local anesthesia (Figs. 3 and 4). The third case of Dirofilaria infection was imported from Tivat, Montenegro in a 22 year old female. The infection was manifested as two weeks increasing subcutaneous nodule (3.5 cm) of the anterior forearm near elbow crease accompanying with pruritus, erythema and pain (Fig. 5). Routine blood tests, including eosinophil count were within normal limits. Abscess was diagnosed, incision was performed and 9 cm worm was extracted.\n\nIn the previous two cases D. repens was identified according to morphological features in histological sections. All patients provided agreement for participation in this study.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Its transmission depends mainly on weather conditions, which must be favorable for their development and survival. Europe is a continent where heartworm disease is expanding, but, at the same time, there are very few studies about the transmission vectors. Our aim is to review the current distribution of potential vectors in the European continent, the changes and their possible causes. Various studies had reported several species of mosquitoes infected by D. immitis larvae such as Haplotype H1 of Culex pipiens in Spain; Cx. pipens complex in Italy, Turkey, Germany and Belarus Republic; Cx. torrentium in Germany and Belarus; Cx. theileri in Madeira (Portugal) and Canary Islands (Spain); Aedes albopictus, Ae. caspius and Coquillettidia richiardii in Italy; Anopheles maculipennis in Italia; Ae. vexans in Turkey, Slovakia and Czech Republic. On the other hand, a few species of mosquitoes have been described as D. repens potential vectors: An. maculipennis and An. algeriensis in Austria; An. daciae, Culiseta annulata and An. maculipennis in Germany; Ae. vexans in Slovakia and Germany and An. claviger s.l. in Belarus. In these studies have been employed or CO2 or animal or human-bait traps [1-7]. Several factors can exert an influence on the emergence or discovery of species or new species to act as vectors, such as the climate change caused by the global warming or the interest in studying this disease in countries when new cases of canine heartworm are diagnosed. The activity of these species is another factor to consider. Mainly, their activity develops in spring and summer and their behavior depends of the different feeding patterns of each specie. For example, Cx. pipiens, Anopheles spp. are active only during the night while Ae. Albopictus predominantly at dawn or during the day. More studies and new programs of control of vectors in the current and new endemic countries, and control measures should be carried out to prevent the spreading of this disease.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

In the province of Salamanca (West-central Spain) the disease is known from many years, appearing in an area with extensive irrigated crops along the river Tormes [2]. Because recent demographic changes have occurred in this area, the present study has been carried out with the aim to monitoring the distribution and prevalence of the disease in the canine population of this area. For that, 191 dogs were analysed through antigen and microfilariae tests and geo-referenced in a map. The general prevalence is 5.76%, although the disease is only present in dogs from municipalities with irrigated crops in which the prevalence is 16.67%. These results indicate that D. immitis continues to be present in the province of Salamanca and that it is associated with the presence of irrigations but with a clear decrease in the prevalence. Causes of the prevalence decrease as well as the potential zoonotic risk are discussed.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

So far, after many studies, it can be pointed out that Vojvodina, (Northern Serbia) is an endemic region for dirofilariasis in dogs caused by D. immitis. During the period of the last 10 years, prevalence of D. immitis infection in dogs went from 7% to 26,9%. Today, clinical symptoms in dogs can be observed, a regular health check-up in dogs is provided by the veterinary service. Herein we report a very high prevalence of D. immitis infections in dogs from one dog shelter with a total of 19 dogs near Novi Sad, Vojvodina and good outcomes after Ivermectin therapy. The shelter is situated 20 km away from the city of Novi Sad, close to the river Danube, with a lot of trees and grass surfaces around. Out of a total of 19 dogs, 13 dogs had D. immitis infections which were diagnosed at clinical examinations (dogs presented cough and weakness during the regular everyday activities), snap test (SNAP 4DX Idexx) and by Knott test for detection of microfilariae in peripheral blood. In all infected dogs, therapy was started with Ivermectin, with a dose of 0.6 mg/kg per body mass every week for 4 weeks, then every two weeks, followed by once per month. The monitoring of therapy effectiveness was performed every month in all of the dogs due clinical examination and Knott testing. After therapeutic procedure, microfilariae were not detected in blood of all cured dogs. Therapy with Ivermectin and Knott test were repeated for the next 6 months and there were no parasitological positive findings of dirofilariosis. In addition, eight months after the first therapy was given to all of the dogs, parasitological and clinical examinations showed that all dogs were without clinical symptoms and using Knott test microfilariae were not found in blood of examined dogs.\n\nA25 Detection of Dirofilaria spp. in dogs from Greece: Preliminary results\n\nElias Papadopoulos1, Athanasios Angelou1, Eleftherios Gallidis1, Kyriakos Spanoudis1, Roland Schaper2, Ramaswamy Chandrashekar3\n\n1School of Veterinary Medicine, Aristotle University, Thessaloniki, 541 24, Greece; 2Bayer Animal Health GmbH, Leverkusen, 51368, Germany; 3IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, Maine 04092, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Elias Papadopoulos (eliaspap@vet.auth.gr)\n\nDirofilariosis is an important parasitic disease of dogs, cats and wild carnivores worldwide. It is among the most common canine vector-borne disease and represents a serious threat to both animal and public health [1]. Greece is a typical Mediterranean country with reported cases of Dirofilaria-infected animals [2] and has favourable climatic conditions for mosquitoes, including new invasive species. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Dirofilaria spp. in clinically healthy dogs and to create a prevalence map including all geographic parts of the country. Blood samples were collected from a total of 276 dogs. They were animals of different breeds, both indoor and outdoor and used for different purposes (hunting, guarding, pets, shepherds, stray etc.). All samples were tested with the SNAP® 4Dx® Plus Test to detect Dirofilaria immitis antigen. In addition, samples were examined by Knott test to identify microfilariae of D. immitis and D. repens. Additional data were collected in order to identify potential risk factors. Thirty-two D. immitis antigen positive samples (11.6%) were detected by serology and19 of 32 were amicrofilariaemic. D. repens microfilariae were identified in 4 (1.4%) dogs. Infected dogs were originating significantly more from Northern than Southern parts of Greece (p < 0.01). Also, dogs at higher risk were the ones spending more time or activity outside the house (i.e. hunting) and with minimum preventive antiparasitic administration. These results revealed a high occurrence of Dirofilaria spp. in clinically healthy dogs in Greece and highlight the need to maintain a comprehensive and regular prophylaxis to reduce the contact between dogs and mosquito vectors. Furthermore, the findings of this study confirm that clinically healthy dogs need to be routinely screened for this parasite, as early diagnosis may be an important component of successful treatment and public health protection.\n\nThe study was funded by Bayer Animal Health GmbH.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

It enables an insight into the morphology of a lung field and cardiac silhouette. Radiographic changes associated with HWD can be assessed both subjectively and objectively. The aim of this work is to score subjective changes associated with canine heartworm disease in order to make them more comparable and useful for clinicians. Within objective measurements, in addition to the determination of a heart size, sizes of relevant blood vessels were determined according to the vertebral heart scale (VHS) system. Thoracic radiographs from 20 dogs with natural heartworm disease were measured. Both recumbent lateral (LL) and dorsoventral (DV) radiographs were available from 16 dogs whilst lateral recumbent radiographs were available from 4 dogs. The diagnosis of the heartworm infestation was established according to the results of wet blood smears, modified Knott test [1] and heartworm antigen test. Radiographs of each dog were assessed subjectively (vascular, alveolar and interstitial pattern and right-sided cardiomegaly) [2] and objectively (VHS) [3, 4]. A stage of heartworm disease was determined for each dog. Results were statistically analyzed and presented as percentages (qualitative variables) and mean ± standard deviation (SD) (quantitative variables). In this descriptive retrospective study we defined an incidence of each radiographic change and scored them, and calculated sizes of a heart and blood vessels relevant to the HWD among examined dogs. The most common radiographic changes subjectively assessed were increased sternal contact (95%) and rounding of the cranial border (90% of dogs). Scores for subjective assessment of radiographic findings in examined dogs were in the range 2/9 to 5/9 for cardiomegaly and 1/12 to 6/12 for lung pattern. Average heart sizes measured in LL and DV radiographs were 10.75 ± 0.78v and 11.04 ± 0.42v, respectively. Measurements of relevant blood vessels were as follows: vena cava caudalis 0.83 ± 0.10v, right cranial lobar artery 0.31 ± 0.08v and right caudal lobar artery 0.96 ± 0.42v. Further studies are needed to compare these results with results of dogs without HWD in order to define the most important changes that could be used as a diagnostic or prognostic tool. Objectivity in the assessment of the radiographs of dogs with HWD is possible to achieve by scoring the findings and using objective radiographic measurement.\n\nThis work is part of the research done in the project TR31084 granted by the Serbian Ministry of Education and Science.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

However, in many practices a screening of blood donors for canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) is not a mandatory procedure. So far dogs have been not tested for the occurrence of microfilariae in most Polish canine blood banks, which indicates lack of available data regarding microfilariosis among canine blood donors. The survey was carried out in the second half of year – between May and December 2015 what corresponds to the highest levels of microfilariae per ml observed in peripheral blood of dogs from Central and Eastern Europe. A total of 350 blood samples from healthy dogs - blood donors, were analyzed using microscopic and biomolecular methods. Microfilaraemic samples were further analyzed by standard PCR methods. Circulating microfilariae were detected in fresh smear in 20 samples with prevalence of 5.7% (3.6-9.0). PCR analyzed revealed that, in total 16 out of 20 samples were positive for D. repens while 4 samples were negative. Other filarial species (D. immitis, Acanthocheilonema reconditum, A. dipetalonema dracunculoides) occurring in Europe were not detected in the analyzed material. Canine dirofilariosis has been spreading during the last years in Central Europe countries [1]. D. repens is a dominant causative agent of canine microfilariosis in Poland [2], which was confirmed in our study. Currently a cross-serological survey also revealed a circulating antigen of D. immitis in these geographical areas. In Poland 0.015% dogs were positive for circulating antibodies D. immitis [3]. Despite the fact that dogs cannot infect Dirofilaria spp. via blood transfusion, the risk of spreading the reservoir invasion and possible immune reactions of the host (blood recipient) indicate that screening tests for dirofilariosis are essential.\n\nReferences\n\n1 Miterpáková M, Iglódyová A, Čabanová V, Stloukal E, Miklisová D.

Several studies have shown that Dirofilaria species are present in the southern and south-eastern areas of Romania [1]. However, information about the vectors in the Danube Delta and their vector competence is lacking. In July 2015 more than 5,000 mosquitoes were collected in the Danube Delta in Romania at various locations (including mosquito traps next to a dog infected with both D. immits and D. repens). Mosquitoes were classified to species-level using the key after Becker et.al. [2]. In one part of the study specified mosquitoes were pooled (up to 25 individuals per day/trap/mosquito species). DNA was extracted and the samples were screened for filarioid helminths using conventional PCRs. For the second part of the study 300 specified mosquito individuals caught at the trap next to a microfilariaemic dog positive for D. immitis and D. repens were segregated into head/thorax and abdomen prior to DNA extraction. Each thorax/head and abdomen was screened for the presence of filarioid DNA separately. All positive PCR products were further analysed by sequencing.\n\nMosquitoes were sampled within the training school of WG1 under the frame of EurNegVec COST Action TD1303. Parts of this study were funded by the ERA-Net BiodivERsA, with the national funders FWF I-1437, ANR-13-EBID-0007-01 and DFG BiodivERsA KL 2087/6-1 as part of the 2012-13 BiodivERsA call for research proposals.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The most recent works have focussed on various aspects of the infection. First of all, the expansion of A. vasorum in dogs and in wildlife in Europe seems to persist. New reports include cases in dogs from Belgium, Portugal, Bulgaria and Slovakia, all surrounded by countries where A. vasorum had previously been observed. In parallel, studies in wildlife have confirmed that foxes represent the most important reservoir, with prevalences over 70%.\n\nRecent epidemiological studies in foxes and dogs showed that annual precipitation and temperature influenced the distribution of A. vasorum, and that in the Alps, altitudes above 700 m asl represent a limiting factor for parasite transmission. Field studies illustrated the variability of spatial distribution and the variability of the slug fauna acting as intermediate hosts, which was suggested to explain the clumpy distribution of A. vasorum. An additional confounder may be represented by birds: in addition to previously described frogs, experimental studies have shown that chicken (and therefore potentially other bird species), may also act as paratenic hosts.\n\nIn dogs, the classical larval detection in faeces is frequently complemented with PCR performed on different substrates, including bronchoalveolar fluid. Comparisons performed between coproscopic, biomolecular and serological methods testify to the high performance of serological methods. A commercially available test kit for A. vasorum antigen detection allows the diagnosis of canine angiostrongylosis within 15 minutes. It also proved highly sensitive when analysing cardiopulmonary tissue fluid of foxes. Last but not least, the broad variety of clinical signs associated with A. vasorum infection accounts for an excellent camouflaging of the disease, including manifestations in the eyes, neurological disorders, bleeding from various surfaces or internally or even by nematode dermatitis, hepatic abnormalities or concurrent infections with the heartworm Dirofilaria immitis. In clinical patients with respiratory distress the occurrence of pulmonary hypertension was proposed as a negative predictor of survival to the infection Importantly, bleeding seems to occur in up to one third of clinical cases, however results of tests evaluating the coagulation system are not fully consistent and the reasons behind the impaired coagulation are still debated.\n\nIn conclusion, the clinical diagnosis of angiostrongylosis represents a challenge, therefore disease awareness is pivotal. Moreover, a wide range of open questions remain to be addressed.\n\nA30 Angiostrongylus vasorum in its intermediate hosts: an epidemiological survey in Germany\n\nMalin Lange1, Felipe Penagos1, Carlos Hermosilla1, Roland Schaper2, Anja Taubert1\n\n1Institute of Parasitology, Justus Liebig University, Gießen, Germany, 35392; 2Bayer Health GmbH, Leverkusen, Germany, 51368\n\nCorrespondence: Malin Lange (malin.k.lange@vetmed.uni-giessen.de)\n\nInfections with the French Heartworm Angiostrongylus vasorum represent neglected diseases of dogs in Germany. Due to the localization of A. vasorum in the right heart and pulmonary artery this parasite causes a multi-factorial disease being represented by general, respiratory, circulatory, bleeding and neurological disorders that occasionally lead to death. Recent European surveys indicate that this parasite is spreading in Europe. Actual data on prevalences in dogs and foxes (acting as reservoir hosts) reveal several endemic foci in Germany. The life cycle of A. vasorum is obligatory linked to an intermediate host being represented by a wide range of slugs and snails. Given that actual data on A. vasorum infections in intermediate hosts are missing for Germany, we here conducted an epidemiological survey on slugs in selected regions of Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate. To account for seasonal variations slugs were collected throughout the season in spring, summer, autumn and winter in four different areas (two spots for Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate, each) that were previously proven to be hyperendemic for A. vasorum fox infections. Thus, a total of 2701 slugs were collected and examined for lungworm larvae using the techniques of artificial digestion and microscopy. The confirmation of the lungworm species will be made by specific PCRs. Preliminary data revealed a total A. vasorum prevalence of 4.6% in slugs based on microscopic analyses. The number of A. vasorum larvae per slug varied considerably (1-546 larvae per specimen). Considering the different sampling areas, some hotspots with relatively high A. vasorum prevalences in slugs (up to 10%) were identified. A vasorum prevalences varied with the season since highest prevalences were detected in summer (9.1%), whilst the lowest number of infected slugs was found in winter (0.8%). Besides A. vasorum, we additionally detected other lungworm larvae in slug samples: Crenosoma vulpis/striatum (lungworm of dog/hedgehog, 2.2%) and Aelurostrongylus abstrusus (feline lungworm, 0.2%). Overall, the current data demonstrate that dogs are at a permanent risk for A. vasorum infections (even in winter) when living in the investigated areas.\n\nA31 Seroprevalence of Angiostrongylus vasorum in Swedish dogs: a national survey\n\nGiulio Grandi1, Eva Osterman-Lind1, Roland Schaper2, Ulrika Forshell3, Manuela Schnyder4\n\n1Department of Microbiology, National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, 75189, Sweden; 2Bayer Animal Health GmbH, Leverkusen, Germany; 3Bayer HealthCare - Animal Health, Copenhagen, Denmark; 4Institute of Parasitology – University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland\n\nCorrespondence: Giulio Grandi (giulio.grandi@sva.se)\n\nAngiostrongylus vasorum, the French heartworm, is a parasite of dogs described in several parts of the world, including continental Europe and the British Isles [1]. Regarding parasite occurrence in Scandinavia, endemic foci are widely present in Denmark and recently the parasite has been found in foxes in Norway [2]. In Sweden the parasite was first identified in 2003 on the island of Sydkoster (Västra Götaland County) [3]. Since then Swedish sporadic endemic cases of A. vasorum were diagnosed through positive canine faecal samples every year since 2011. A progressively increasing number of faecal samples has been submitted to SVA (National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala), however the prevalence in dogs appears to be quite low. A large-scale collection of canine serum samples was planned in order to identify the presence and distribution of A. vasorum in Sweden using more sensitive methods, i.e. serological methods able to detect parasite antigens and antibodies developed against the parasite. In this first large scale survey, 3886 sera from pet dogs were collected from the Clinical Chemistry Laboratory of the University Animal Hospital (UDS-SLU, Uppsala) as well as from SVA and 3309 (85% of 3886) have been tested until now by an ELISA for the detection of circulating antigen of A. vasorum and by a separate ELISA detecting specific antibodies against the parasite. Among the analysed samples a total of 0.39% (n = 13, 95% Confidence Intervals, CI: 0.21-0.67%) of the animals were positive in both ELISAs, while 0.70% (n = 12, CI: 0.44-1.04%) of the tested dogs were antigen-positive only and 1.48% (n = 49, CI: 1.48-1.10%) were positive for specific antibodies only. These preliminary results confirm that A. vasorum is established in Sweden with a prevalence comparable to other European countries. Definitive results from ongoing analyses will provide a deeper insight on the dissemination of the parasite over the country.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

In Europe, red fox (Vuples vulpes) is considered as major reservoir host of these species. With regard to successful anti-rabies vaccination programmes and their urbanisation, red foxes represent significant infection risk for dogs. Despite it, data on the occurrence of these parasites in fox populations are very scant in a lot of European countries. In Slovakia, A. vasorum in dogs was for the first time reported in 2013 and then in 2014 [1, 2]. Consequential serological survey confirmed circulating A. vasorum antigen or the parasite-specific antibodies in 6.22% of dogs investigated [3]. A. vasorum was not previously reported in Slovak red foxes. On the other hand, C. vulpis was noticed in 1960ties and 1980ies in red foxes from Tatra National Park, Northern Slovakia, but its distribution and prevalence rate has never been formally surveyed. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to uncover real occurrence of A. vasorum and C. vulpis in fox population throughout Slovakia and estimate the "
