        "text": "McKesson has mobilized resources during some of the most threatening health crises throughout history. From distributing medicines and vaccines to deploying personal protective equipment (PPE), the company has been dedicated to making care possible for more than 187 years.\n\n1833 – McKesson is founded by John McKesson and Charles Olcott to import and sell therapeutic drugs and herbal products.\n\n1918 – A severe flu pandemic infects a third of the world’s population, claiming the life of an estimated 50 million people worldwide. McKesson distributes lozenges with the hope of preventing the spread of the deadly influenza.\n\n1940s – Penicillin becomes widely available to reduce illness and death from infectious diseases. McKesson Laboratories deploys an experimental production of penicillin carrying it out under license by the government. The company is officially recognized by the War Production Board for its part in this wartime effort.\n\nMcKesson has mobilized resources during some of the most threatening health crises throughout history. From distributing medicines and vaccines to deploying personal protective equipment (PPE), the company has been dedicated to making care possible for more than 187 years.\n\n2006 – Uninsured and underinsured children are threatened without access to vaccines. McKesson is selected by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to distribute vaccines for the Vaccines for Children Program to reach more than 1.8 million children via approximately 44,000 participating healthcare provider sites.\n\n2009 – H1N1 Flu poses a major threat to human health. McKesson partners with the CDC as the sole vaccine distributor. The company deploys over 125 million doses to as many as 90,000 sites across the U.S., making it the largest public health initiative of the time.\n\n2014 – Ebola breaks out in West Africa with more than 21,000 cases. McKesson responds with a donation of medical relief supplies, including 4 million pairs of latex gloves, 8,000 gallons of disinfectant and personal protective equipment kits.\n\nPresent Day – The World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020.\n\nMcKesson uses its longstanding expertise in managing complex logistics to partner with the U.S. government to deliver critically needed medical supplies to frontline healthcare workers across the country.\n\nThe strength of McKesson’s supply chain makes it possible that needed medications are sent daily to pharmacies in North America and Europe.\n\nAll Rexall and Retail Banner Group pharmacies in Canada and Lloyds pharmacies in Europe remain open despite the crisis to provide access to medications. Additionally, COVID-19 testing is offered in select U.S. Health Mart pharmacies, Rexall and Retail Banner Group pharmacies in Canada and McKesson subsidiaries in Europe."
