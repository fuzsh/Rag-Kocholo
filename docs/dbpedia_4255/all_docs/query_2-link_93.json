        "text": "It’s hard to believe less than 60 days have passed since I joined Sanofi. But for me, counting each day reminds me of the urgency I set out with when I accepted this role, and how encouraging it’s been to witness that same pace matched by my new colleagues: the heart of Sanofi. When I started, I undertook an in-depth exploration of our diverse portfolio, which revealed a clear vision to build a long-term, sustainable pipeline. One with an equity growth story that continues to expand to meet the needs of our patients and stakeholders. Armed with my dual expertise in science and venture capital, I am now poised to make daring decisions, driving Sanofi’s vision forward to revolutionize the practice of medicine. One way I know we can accomplish this is by embracing groundbreaking technologies and platforms that are revealing exponential opportunity for innovation. Having analytics tools in place, we are already improving our productivity and outcomes and leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for better decision making every day. With these tools we will move more aggressively in precision research, shorten our clinical trial timelines and streamline our work with regulatory authorities. In fact, the global market for AI in drug discovery, alone, is estimated to grow at a CAGR of nearly 30% over the next five years. And our partnerships with AI start-ups are amplifying our R&D capabilities and ensuring that we stay inter-connected across our organization and across the innovation ecosystem. I am grateful to join Sanofi at this important moment in our company’s history, where increased funding of our pipeline will bring us closer to realizing the potential of our first and best-in-class assets. I am confident in our mission to bring more novel and innovative treatment options to patients at a pace like never before. In the coming weeks and months, I look forward to explaining in further detail how we’re reshaping our pipeline priorities and doubling down on our investments in R&D. Stay tuned for more exciting developments.\n\nIt was my pleasure to represent Chiesi Global Rare Diseases in two sessions at the Paradigm Global Events Orphan Drugs & Rare Diseases 2023 Americas congress this week. My key takeaways from participating in the day-1 keynote panel on Orphan Drug Commercialization with Craig Martin and Monique Mulkern were that - tightening financial markets for early stage companies will require creativity and new partnerships to ensure promising programs advance - the regulatory landscape continues to take 2-steps forward, 1-step back as they add flexibility for rare disease programs, but deal with potential \"unintended\" consequences of new legislation - engagement with the rare disease patient community is essential and all stakeholders must play their part My day-2 presentation on Patient Community Engagement in Drug Development stressed three important elements 1) Engage the community in all aspects of drug development from discovery to lifecycle management; 2) engage early and often; and 3) build trust with the community through transparency, partnership and co-creation. #raredisease\n\nEarlier this year, I announced that I was joining Abionyx Pharma as a part-time Chief Medical Officer and Head of R&D. That announcement came as quite a surprise to my friends and colleagues who knew that I intended to stay away from operating roles when I retired from Abbvie. Life in semi-retirement, focusing on board and advisory work was really agreeing with me and I was enjoying having time for my many other passions. What changed? The answer is that an opportunity came up to make a difference for a group of patients who have not benefited from the many revolutions in recent years. Over the last thirty years, every attempt to develop a specific therapy for this group of patients has failed. I believe that with all I have learned about running successful outcome studies over the last thirty years and with a therapy that intervenes at the heart of the disease process, I might have the opportunity, and the honor, to help these patients. Over the next several weeks, I am going to release a post every week talking about sepsis, why it is such a huge unmet need, how the underlying problem in sepsis is actually a runaway host defense, why the many previous attempts have somewhat predictably failed and how this host defense can be successfully modulated by augmenting the existing host control mechanisms. In my first post, I am going to focus on the size of the problem in the US but the problem is equally large in Europe and even more so in LMICs.\n\nOver 8,000 investors, leaders, and innovators congregated in San Francisco for the 2024 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference to explore the future opportunities in healthcare. Often dubbed as the “birthplace of healthcare deals”, the conference did not disappoint, especially in the wake of the flurry of M&A activity seen in Q4 2023. Here are a few of Solici’s top picks: While Eli Lilly and Company and Novo Nordisk continue to remain a dominant force in the obesity market, the former commended long-time rival Novo Nordisk for pursuing high-dose GLPs for weight loss, thus fostering healthy competition. As several other companies have joined the #obesity gold rush, competition in the landscape is greater than ever. While Amgen is spearheading its obesity program with #MariTide and AMG786, AstraZeneca paid ECCOGENE 诚益生物 $185 MN (with up to $ 1.825 BN in future milestone payments) to secure global rights to ECC5004, and Regeneron is set to dive straight into a Ph2 program in mid-2024. However, Eli Lilly and Company quickly pointed out that “some of them will succeed and some won’t” as the obesity landscape continues to evolve. Bristol Myers Squibb emphasised its acquisition of Karuna Therapeutics for $14 BN. The company has high hopes of bolstering its neuroscience portfolio with #KarXT, which is set to launch in the US for the treatment of #Schizophrenia following the anticipated PDUFA date in September. As the #Keytruda patent cliff draws closer, MSD remains optimistic as it expects to generate more than $20 BN (previously $10 BN) from its diversified oncology pipeline by mid-2030. This is supported by its acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics to secure #HPN328 for SCLC and NETs, as well as the collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. to gain access to three of its Dxd ADCs for $5.5 BN over two years. What were your main highlights from the 2024 J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference? #JPMHC24 #healthcare #pharma\n\nBUILDING THE FUTURE, CELEBRATING THE PAST #pfizerproud This week marked a milestone for Pfizer in Finland, Iceland, Norway and Denmark. On 3rd and 4th of June, the first days of summer, we gathered in Copenhagen to mark the creation of our FIND-cluster. However, 4th of June didn’t just mark that we could FINDally meet all of us in the same place. It also marked the 175th anniversary of Pfizer. This overlap provided a wonderful framework for our meeting and reminded us of the foundation we’re built on: The first bricks for this foundation was laid in Brooklyn back in 1849 by two cousins, Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart. In 1924, Pfizer celebrated it’s 75th anniversary for its 306 employees. By 1939 Pfizer was recognized as a leader in fermentation technology, and in 1950, the first pharmaceutical product was sold under the Pfizer brand. The rest is history. History that we are incredibly proud of. We’re proud to have been at the forefront of some of the most profound changes in medicine and technology, and we aren’t planning to rest on the laurels – we believe we are on the cusp of an era where technology and innovative therapies intersect like never before. That’s why we are excited to press forward with a renewed focus on oncology and our ongoing dedication to finding new treatments and medications for myriad other diseases and conditions. And that loops us right back to the present, and to our FIND-meeting in Copenhagen. Bringing everyone together was an important step in our efforts to realize the potential synergies that exist between our countries, our people and our goals. Further, it was an important step in establishing our FIND culture. And it was just great to finally meet in person and see new connections being made and friendships formed. Now, FIND is all fueled up and ready to bring the next generation of breakthroughs to patients across Finland, Iceland, Norway and Denmark - for the next 175 years and beyond. #sciencewillwin"
