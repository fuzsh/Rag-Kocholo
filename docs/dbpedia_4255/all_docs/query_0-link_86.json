        "text": "Heike Leiacker - Your contact person for probate research\n\n29. January 2024, Heike Leiacker - General, Genealogy, Personalities\n\nOur colleague Heike Leiacker is our specialist for probate research. But she also enjoys the exciting research she does for various private clients – and their delight at the information she finds!\n\nHeike Leiacker - Your contact person for probate research\n\nRalf Stullich - Our man on the phone\n\n26. January 2024, Heike Leiacker - General, Genealogy, Personalities\n\n\"When you drive into the office in the morning with a grin on your face, you know you have chosen the right job.\" (Quote from Ralf Stullich)\n\nAccording to him, he has achieved this with his work for us.\n\nHe is your first point of contact with us when it comes to whether and how we can help you. In most cases, you will receive a written offer from him after a brief review of the information you have provided. If there are any uncertainties or questions, he will often pick up the phone and discuss them with you personally.\n\nRalf Stullich - Our man on the phone\n\nAndrea Bentschneider - Our founder\n\n24. January 2024, Heike Leiacker - General, Genealogy, Hamburg, Historical Events, Personalities\n\nAndrea Bentschneider at the grave of her great-great-great-great-grandfather in the USA\n\nShe hardly needs an introduction: the founder of Beyond History, Andrea Bentschneider. Well known from television and various newspaper articles, she is not only the heart of the company, but also its face.\n\nAndrea Bentschneider - Our founder\n\nCrazy Times: How Germany dealt with over 30 time zones before 1893!\n\n08. April 2023, Andrea Bentschneider - General, Germany, Historical Events, Knowledge\n\nImagine living in 19th century Germany and having to adjust to a different time zone every time you travel within the country. This was reality until the introduction of a single time zone exactly 130 years ago. But how did it come about?\n\nCrazy Times: How Germany dealt with over 30 time zones before 1893!\n\nThe German War Graves Commission and a very special project\n\n08. December 2022, Heike Leiacker - Archives, Societies, Museums, Genealogy, General, Germany, Historical Documents, WW I, WWII\n\nThe Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge e.V. (German War Graves Commission) is probably known to most German genealogists - or it should be. Mainly, because information on fallen or missing persons from the First and Second World Wars can be found via an online searchable database or a search request.\n\nBut the War Graves Commission also looks after German war grave sites abroad, supports the institutions looking after the ones in Germany, is involved in the culture of remembrance and offers educational programs for young people.\n\nThe regional association in Saxony is currently pursuing a very special project. And perhaps you can help with it!\n\nThe German War Graves Commission and a very special project\n\nRemembrance Day and Sunday of Commemoration of the Dead - Days of Remembrance\n\n19. November 2022, Andrea Bentschneider - Germany, Holiday\n\nThe golden October is over. The holiday season has not yet begun. Fall has arrived with rainy showers and the first storms of the year.\n\nHowever, November has always been known as the \"Month of Mourning\" or even the \"Month of Remembrance\" not because of the weather. The Sunday of the dead, All Saints' Day, All Souls' Day or also the People's Day of Mourning fall in this month. On these days, the deceased are remembered, which is why they are also called silent holidays.\n\nRemembrance Day and Sunday of Commemoration of the Dead - Days of Remembrance\n\nTop 10: Emigration and Immigration Museums\n\n10. November 2022, Andrea Bentschneider - Archives, Societies, Museums, Emigration, Genealogy, German-American\n\nDid your ancestors (or their family members) emigrate? If they did, you are probably interested in learning more about their journey and the conditions the might have had to endure.\n\nHopefully, our blog series on emigration from Germany can give you some interesting insight. If you would like to get a more direct feeling, emigration and immigration museums can be a great way to walk in your ancestors footsteps. We can highly recommend the following ones.\n\nMany of them will also give you the opportunity to access documents and information that could help with your genealogical research.\n\nTop 10: Emigration and Immigration Museums\n\nEmigration from Germany: Sources for overseas research (destination country)\n\n20. October 2022, Andrea Bentschneider - Archives, Societies, Museums, Emigration, Genealogy, German-American, Germany, Historical Documents, Knowledge\n\nAre you looking for traces of your emigrated German ancestors in their destination country? Then you are exactly right here, because after we have already presented a number of sources and contact points in Germany recently, today will write about sources for research in the respective immigration countries (destination countries).\n\nOf course, these differ greatly according to the respective country of arrival/immigration so that we can only give an overview for some countries here.\n\nSome of the sources are also available online through a wide variety of platforms (including paid ones). As always in genealogy, you should keep an eye on the seriousness and reliability of the source before adopting the information.\n\nNorth America\n\nArrival passenger lists\n\nIn some countries, for example in the USA, all arriving passengers of emigrant ships were registered. Due to the variations from nation to nation, we cannot give an exact list here. However, the lists of passengers arriving in the US on ships from all over the world are collected in the National Archives in Washington, D.C. The original lists were destroyed after being backed up on microfilm. Various databases record arriving passengers by port of arrival or nationality. The collection \"Germans to America\" should be mentioned here, one of the various efforts to at least partially reconstruct the Bremen passenger lists in particular on the basis of the arrival lists in the USA.\n\nFor the Port of New York, there is also a separate database for arrivals at the immigration center at Castle Garden on the southern tip of Manhattan from 1820 until the official founding of Ellis Island in 1892.\n\nCensus records\n\nCensuses have been taken in the United States every ten years since 1790. Lists of these censuses are also preserved at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. Other regional census lists may also be of interest for your genealogical research if, for example, they document stops of your ancestors along the way to the US. Changes of residence in the destination country and family members, occupations, etc. can also be traced through census lists if you are lucky.\n\nObituaries\n\nIn the USA, it is customary at the time of a person's death to list in an obituary his or her life story with the various stages, occupations, places of residence, spouses, children, and grandchildren. These were published in local newspapers and some are searchable online.\n\nImmigration museums\n\nThe best-known example here is the Immigration Museum in New York Harbor on Ellis Island. Its Immigration Center was established in 1892. There, much can be learned about the stages of emigration, arrival in the US, and the quarantine period on the island. A database is also available at the in-house research center.\n\nSouth America\n\nImmigration organizations and societies for the study of immigrants\n\nThe Martius-Staden Institute in Sao Paulo for the cultivation of German culture in Brazil and Latin America provides a fine example.\n\nAustralia\n\nNewspaper articles about arriving ships\n\nEspecially in Australia, it was often common to publish the arrival of ships, sometimes even listing the arriving passengers.\n\nImmigration museums\n\nA fine example of such a museum in Australia is the Immigration Museum of the State of Victoria in Melbourne.\n\nYou do not even know where to start? Of course, we will be happy to try to help you with your research abroad. Please contact us!\n\nEmigration from Germany: Sources for research in Germany\n\n06. October 2022, Andrea Bentschneider - Archives, Societies, Museums, Emigration, Genealogy, General, German-American, Germany, Hamburg, Historical Documents, Knowledge, Tips and Tricks\n\nIf you have found among your ancestors some who dared to emigrate despite all the risks of the journey and adversities of arrival, you may want to shed more light on their path. But how do you go about it? Here, as in other genealogical researches, there are always various possibilities, depending, among other things, on the circumstances in the various states and countries.\n\nEmigration from Germany: Sources for research in Germany\n\nWhy can't I visit my ancestor's grave?\n\n17. September 2022, Heike Leiacker - Genealogy, General, Germany, Knowledge\n\nRiensberg cemetery, Bremen, Germany\n\nToday we would like to address a frequently asked question from our foreign clients, the answer to which always causes astonishment.\n\nIn the USA and also in other countries, graves are usually laid out for eternity. In Islam or Judaism, too, eternal rest for the deceased is supposed to be guaranteed. Accordingly, we often receive inquiries about the resting places of ancestors to be visited during a trip, or requests for photos of the gravesites. Unfortunately, this is often not possible in Germany.\n\nOf course we can try to find out where an ancestor was buried, but whether the grave still exists is a completely different question.\n\nWhy can't I visit my ancestor's grave?\n\nHow it all began\n\n01. July 2022, Andrea Bentschneider - Anniversary, Birthdays, Genealogy, General\n\nOn 01 July 2004 I started my own business with my hobby, genealogy, and founded Beyond History. Looking back, this was one of the best decisions I ever made - even though it was not always sunshine and roses. I always like to remember the beginnings and would like to take you with me today on a short journey through the history of our company.\n\nHow it all began\n\nComing of age - then and now\n\n24. June 2022, Heike Leiacker - Genealogy, General, Germany, Hamburg, Historical Documents, History, Knowledge\n\nFinally being an adult and thus beeing self-determined! The age of majority is often longed for. In Germany, for example, you have then full legal capacity to conclude contracts of all kinds, the ability to legally buy alcohol and tobacco products, to go to nightclubs, to vote, to freely determine your place of residence, and to marry without the permission of your legal guardians or a family court. However, you also have to live with the consequences of your own actions.\n\nTo be considered legally as an adult has therefore advantages and disadvantages (even if there are still transition periods e.g. in the criminal law). In the last 150 years or so, the legal age of majority in Germany has been lowered several times. Today it is 18 years.\n\nFor genealogy the age of a person and especially the age of majority play a not unimportant role, too. Depending on the age of a person, other sources may become relevant for the research. Also additions like \"volljährig\" (of full age), “grossjährig” (of “great” age), \"majorenn\" (from Latin majorennis which comes from maior annis, meaning greater in years), \"major\" or, in contrast, such as “minderjährig” (minor), “halbwüchsig” (half-grown), \"minorenn\" or \"minor\" can also help to determine the approximate age of a person and thus, for example, to find out (or at least to find a hint) which of potentially several persons with the same names a particular one might be.\n\nComing of age - then and now\n\nHamburger Feuerkasse - the oldest existing insurance company in the world\n\n30. November 2021, Heike Leiacker - Anniversary, Genealogy, General, Germany, Hamburg, Historical Documents, Historical Events, Knowledge\n\nOn 30 November 1676, the General-Feuer-Cassa - the world's first insurance company still in existence today - was founded in Hamburg. The city's pre-existing fire contracts were combined and a public insurance company was created, which still exists today under the name Hamburger Feuerkasse, albeit now as part of a large insurance group. The historical holdings stored in the State Archive Hamburg are also relevant for genealogical research.\n\nHamburger Feuerkasse - the oldest existing insurance company in the world\n\nCharles Pfizer & Company - How two entrepreneurs from Ludwisgburg, Germany founded a global corporation\n\n19. October 2021, Heike Leiacker - Emigration, General, German-American, Historical Events, Knowledge, Personalities\n\nMemorial plaque at the birthplace of Karl Pfizer, photo by Florian Hoffmann, CC BY-SA 3.0 DE (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/de/deed.en), via Wikimedia Commons (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gedenktafel_Pfizer.jpg)\n\nThe pharmaceutical company Pfizer is one of the largest in the world and internationally known - currently especially due to the cooperation with BioNTech in the development, production and distribution of the first vaccine against COVID-19 \"Comirnaty\" (usually better known under the company name BioNTech), which was approved in the US, Europe and many other countries. But did you know that the company was founded in the US in 1849 by two people from Ludwigsburg, Germany?\n\nCharles Pfizer & Company - How two entrepreneurs from Ludwisgburg, Germany founded a global corporation"
