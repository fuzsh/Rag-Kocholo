Retrospective Cohort Study Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is wide global variance in survival from breast cancer, both in developed and developing country. However, the effect of estrogen receptor status has not been widely evaluated in Ethiopia where the incidence of breast cancer is rapidly increasing. Hence, the current study aimed to determine the effect of estrogen receptor status on the overall survival of breast cancer patients who were treated at Black Lion Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia. METHODS: In this institution-based retrospective cohort study a total of 368 study participants were included with a one-to-one ratio of estrogen receptor negative to estrogen receptor positive. The main outcome of interest for this study was death due to breast cancer. The authors compared the women with estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer for overall survival rate using log rank test. The incidence density rate of mortality was calculated for each exposed and non-exposed variable. The effect of estrogen receptor status on breast cancer mortality was estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The incidence density rate of mortality among breast cancer patients for estrogen receptor positive were found to be 5.48 (95% CI=3.94‚Äì7.64) per 1,000 person years observation; while for estrogen negative receptor status the mortality rate was found to be 10.47 (95% CI=8.19‚Äì13.37) per 1,000 person years observation.

In this Q&A interview for ‚ÄúHCA Healthcare Today,‚Äù Dr. Navneet Majhail, board-certified hematologist and physician-in-chief of blood cancers at the Sarah Cannon Transplant and Cellular Therapy Network (SCTCTN), discusses his work at HCA Healthcare‚Äôs Sarah Cannon Cancer Institute, and the value of CAR T-Cell Therapy as an important blood cancer treatment. CAR T-cell therapy, or Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, is a novel immunotherapy that programs a patient‚Äôs immune system to recognize and fight cancer. With the technology we have available now, cells can be taken from the body and their DNA modified such that they can start identifying cancer proteins and antigens directly during treatment. Learn more about CAR T-Cell Therapy and how Dr. Majhail and the Sarah Cannon team combine compassion, cutting-edge research and innovative technology to positively impact the lives of blood cancer patients across HCA Healthcare: https://bit.ly/46sAXvd. #HealthierTomorrows #BloodCancer\n\n100% of cancer patients cured long-term in 'remarkable' human trial In what researchers have called an \"unprecedented\" response, a new drug that treats locally advanced rectal cancer has shown to have completely eradicated tumors in all 42 patients who took part in the Phase II trial. The drug, Jemperli (dostarlimab-gxly), had earlier shown great potential for eliminating mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) cancers, which make up 5-10% of colorectal cancers. Following the Phase II trial, the first 24 patients assessed showed a \"sustained complete clinical response\" ‚Äì no cancer evident ‚Äì after an average of 26.3 months. \"These findings demonstrate the potential of dostarlimab-gxly as a novel approach to treating locally advanced dMMR rectal cancer that leads to durable complete tumor regression without the need for life-altering treatment,\" said Dr Andrea Cercek, researcher and oncologist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). \"As a clinician, I‚Äôve seen firsthand the debilitating impact of standard treatment of dMMR rectal cancer and am thrilled about the potential of dostarlimab-gxly in these patients.‚Äù https://lnkd.in/guWzg_h8\n\nLymphocytes as a living drug for cancer: The FDA approval of lifileucel hallmarks the availability of the first cellular therapy for solid cancer. This adoptive cell transfer (ACT) immunotherapy uses the patient‚Äôs own tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which are isolated from a resected growing tumor, expanded to large numbers in the laboratory using interleukin-2 (IL-2) and then reinfused under specialized conditions into the same patient where they target tumor cells. These TILs represent a ‚Äúliving drug,‚Äù capable of proliferating many thousandfold as they circulate in the cancer-bearing patient. The attached paper from Steven Rosenberg in Science nicely describes the development of that novel therapeutic modality since first publications in 1988 and outlines current challenges and possible solutions of TIL therapy. The process of generation and expansion of patient-specific TILs is laborious and costly, but can be achieved in a reproducible manner. It should be noted that most metastatic solid epithelial cancers can still not be cured by any available treatment and account for 90% of all deaths from cancer. It is our hope that next generation ACT therapies (‚Äúliving drugs‚Äù), such as engineered TILs, CAR-T and TCR-T, will provide a solution to this major challenge for cancer therapy. Initial studies have been promising and there is hope that TIL immunotherapy may become useful for patients with common epithelial cancers. Congratulations to Steve Rosenberg and his colleagues/coworkers for decades of perseverance and excellent work!

They've uncovered a unique group of supercharged immune cells called T-cells within the blood of a late-stage cancer survivor. These T-cells possess an extraordinary ability to recognize and attack tumours with incredible precision, potentially targeting various cancer types simultaneously. This finding builds upon the success of tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy, a method that harnesses a patient's own white blood cells to enhance their cancer-fighting capabilities. Recent clinical trials have shown impressive results, with success rates exceeding 80%. However, the exact cellular mechanisms behind these outcomes remained a mystery-until now. Researchers observed that patients who effectively cleared their cancer through TIL therapy maintained strong T-cell responses over a year later. What's even more astonishing is that some of these T-cells exhibited a \"multi-pronged\" approach, suggesting they could potentially tackle different cancer types beyond their original origin. This discovery holds promise for more targeted and effective cancer treatments in the future, potentially leading to complete remission. The researchers are now delving deeper into these multi-pronged T-cells to unlock their full potential and understand their role in successful therapy outcomes.\n\nScientists have developed a saliva test that screens for breast cancer. Researchers from Florida and Taiwan, recently developed a new hand-held, reusable device that detects breast cancer biomarkers from a tiny sample of spit. The testing time is under five seconds per sample. During testing, the device was able to distinguish between healthy breast tissue, early breast cancer, and advanced breast cancer. Looking forward to seeing this tested in a large sample. The saliva test now joins many other early detection tests under development, including the fingerprint test and the portable bra ultrasound. In other news, a breast cancer vaccine in now in early clinical trials. The vaccine only targets triple-negative breast cancer which impacts about 10-15% of women and is the most aggressive form of breast cancer. The vaccine is currently being designed to stop the recurrence of cancer in patients who‚Äôve already been treated for triple-negative breast cancer. The vaccine's first clinical trial, the results of which were published recently, found that the vaccine achieved a good immune response in 75% of patients. The next phase of research will focus on using the vaccine to prevent the onset of triple-negative breast cancer. Hopefully, good news ahead!
