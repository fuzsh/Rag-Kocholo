The company's global portfolio includes medicines and vaccines, as well as many of the world's best-known consumer healthcare products. It collaborates with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. It operates its business through three operating segments: the Global Innovative Pharmaceutical, the Global Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare, and the Global Established Pharmaceutical. The Global Innovative Pharmaceutical segment is focused on developing, registering and commercializing novel, value creating medicines that significantly improve patients lives. The Global Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare segment focuses on the development and commercialization of vaccines and products for oncology and consumer healthcare. The Global Established Pharmaceutical segment includes the brands that have lost market exclusivity and, generally, the mature, patent-protected products that are expected to lose exclusivity through 2015 in most major markets and, to a much smaller extent, generic pharmaceuticals. Pfizer was founded by Charles Pfizer Sr. and Charles H. Erhart Jr. in 1849 and is headquartered in New York, NY."
