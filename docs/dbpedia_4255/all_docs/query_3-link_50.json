We will not be held liable for your failure to do so. Further, we reserve the right to remove any content at any time.\n\nTermination\n\nWe reserve the right, at any time, without notice and without reason, to cancel or terminate the account of any individual or refuse their current or future access. We may also terminate the account of any individual for violation of the Terms of Use. Upon termination, all rights granted to you will also terminate.\n\nAccess\n\nAccess to certain of the events, documents, articles or forums on the Site may be restricted. Registration does not guarantee your access to those items. This may be particularly true for certain webinars where the audience profile is defined by our partners. Webinar registrations should therefore be viewed as an application and not a guarantee of access to the content.\n\nNo Warranty\n\nWe do not warrant that the Site will be secure, error-free or function without disruption.\n\nControlling Law and Severability\n\nThe Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms of Use shall continue to be in full force and effect."
