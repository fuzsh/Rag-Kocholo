        "meta_description": "Immigrants are immense assets to the United States health care system. On the whole, foreign-born residents create a net benefit to the United States by paying more into the system than they receive in government-funded medical benefits. As workers, they fill crucial roles at every level of the health care system, from badly needed home health aides to surgeons and researchers. Their work has been particularly vital throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. With more inclusive policies around health care access, visas and licensing, immigrants could offer even more to the U.S. health care system.",

        "text": "Immigrants pay more into government health care programs than they use in benefits, creating a net surplus. For example, immigrants paid $51 billion more in taxes that pay for Medicare than they used in Medicare-paid services between 2012 and 2018. The Medicare program has been famously running a deficit for some time and is predicted to become insolvent by 2026. So, how is it that immigrants are creating a surplus? Medicare is funded primarily through a payroll tax that applies to all U.S. workers regardless of immigration status, including more than half of undocumented immigrants. The program is used by eligible U.S. residents who are 65 or older. On average, immigrants are younger, healthier and more likely to be in the workforce than the U.S. born, and many are simply ineligible for government benefits.\n\nImmigrating is hard. Most immigrants choose to come to the U.S. when they are relatively young and healthy and looking for work. That’s why immigrants are more likely to be working age and make up an outsized portion of the workforce. Seventy-six percent of immigrants and 63 percent of U.S. born are “working age” (15 to 64), and while the foreign-born make up 13.6 percent of the U.S. population, they represent 17.4 percent of the workforce.\n\nAccording to a study published in the American Journal of Public Health, immigrants use fewer medical services across the board, reporting “fewer medical visits, inpatient admissions, outpatient hospital visits and emergency medical visits.” The disparity is even more pronounced among undocumented immigrants. Researchers at Tufts School of Medicine and Harvard Medical School found that undocumented immigrants account for just 1.4 percent of health care spending in the U.S. despite making up five percent of the total population.\n\nWhen migrants do need to seek health care, they have limited access to government-funded programs. Only U.S. citizens and permanent legal residents (green card holders) are eligible for Medicare, meaning many more pay into the system than benefit from it. Non-citizen immigrants have limited access to programs like Medicaid, and most undocumented immigrants can’t get federal health care at all, including Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces, although some states fund access to these services. Refugees also have limited access to Medicaid and ACA marketplaces. In addition, policies like the public charge rule take rights away from immigrants who use or are predicted to use government benefits. While the public charge rule currently does not include health care benefits, uncertainty around the policy has still had a “chilling effect” that has decreased immigrants’ participation even in the programs that are available to them.\n\nThe combination of immigrants’ high tax contributions, fewer medical needs and limited access to government health care creates a surplus that benefits all Americans.\n\nImmigrants could contribute even more to the U.S. health care system if they weren’t held back by outdated policies regarding health care access, immigration and licensing requirements. As noted above, immigrants have limited access to health care, particularly government-funded health care. This reduces costs in the short term, but lack of access to preventative care increases long term health care costs. For example, one study found that prenatal care can cut medical costs in half over time, but immigrant parents are less likely to receive this vital form of health care.\n\nResearch indicates that expanding immigrants’ access to health care, as well as clarifying and codifying the public charge rule so immigrants don’t fear using the benefits they are entitled to, could ultimately save all Americans significant amounts of money. Research also indicates that increasing access to health care is not a pull factor and does not lead to increases in immigration. Improving health care access is not likely to increase in-migration, but it would improve contact tracing, a vital tool for fighting the COVID-19 crisis that has been hampered by some immigrants’ fear of engaging with the health care system."
