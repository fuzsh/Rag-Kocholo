        "text": "The sitter, Alice Marguerite Henriette, was born on 16 September 1877 in Brooklyn to Charles Pfizer (1824-1906) and his wife Anna Pfizer, and died in New York on May 19, 1959. She was the sister of Charles M. Jr., Ann, Gustav and Emile Pfizer. She married Reinhart Clemens Friedrich Justus Bachofen von Echt (born October 7, 1877 in Vienna) at Newport, Rhode Island on September 5, 1904. She had no children. She died in 1959 after suffering for some time from Parkinson’s disease. The sitter was the aunt of, but apparently the same age as, Lulu Pfizer..\n\nThis portrait was rediscovered by Simon A. Stock in 1999.\n\nShe wrote two books: Haus Sonnenuhr: Geschichten aus Altweimar, Weimar 1935, and an auto-biography Sketches on the Sands of Time, which was published privately in New York, during the Second World War.\n\nThe Brooklyn Daily Eagle said: “Of interest to Brooklyn and Manhattan as well is the reproduction on this page of one of the best known of Brooklyn girls of the day, Miss. Alice M. H. Pfizer of Washington Avenue. This is a photograph form a painting by A. Muller-Ury, who has an extraordinary faculty in the catching of personalities. Muller-Ury has painted Miss Pfizer well and vividly.”"
