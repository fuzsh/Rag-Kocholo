This exhibition of over 100 images reveals the more private side of Marco Ferreri. Besides the set stills which piece together his rich and varied filmography, there are photos showing Ferreri joking with his actors, observing them amusedly, or protecting them with his gaze like an ironic jester. There is also a series of photos showing him as he flirts with the camera with a knowing look during the filming of The Seed of Man.\n\nThere are portraits by important still photographers (Bruno Bruni, Divo Cavicchioli, Angelo Frontoni, Angelo Pennoni, Claudio Patriarca and Gianfranco Salis) and photographs taken by the Ecuadorian artist Fabian Cevallos: 78 photographs, both in black and white and in color. Images taken on seven different film sets that draw us into the extraordinary universe of light and darkness Cevallos crafted with his lens, giving us new keys to interpreting the tales of ordinary madness told by Marco Ferreri.\n\nMarco Ferreri’s wife, Jacqueline, has donated the director’s precious archives to the Museum.\n\nTwo publications have been printed: the catalog “Photographic accounts by Fabian Cevallos” which includes all the photos by Cevallos shown at the exhibition, and the book “Marco Ferreri” by Adriano Pintaldi.\n\nThe exhibit is available to be set up in other locations."
