        "text": "Zineb Sedira‘s exhibition Dreams Have No Titles is in her words, a ‘love letter to cinema’.\n\nOn entry, the visitor encounters a cinematic world of carefully constructed film sets, each drawing from that pivotal moment in the history of cultural, intellectual and avant-garde filmmaking during the 1960s and 70s, particularly across France, Italy and Algeria. A selection of films that have inspired this exhibition can be seen for free every day in the Zineb Sedira Presents… screening programme.\n\nInspired by Zineb’s exhibition, independent British film label CultFilms have pulled together your guide to stand-out world cinema and cult classics from the 60s and 70s. Featuring stories of romance, betrayal and moral ambiguity, these films are not to be left behind.\n\nThe Battle of Algiers (Gillo Pontecorvo, 1966)\n\nGillo Pontecorvo’s The Battle of Algiers tells the story of the life-and-death struggle between the French colonial government of Algeria and the Algerian Liberation Front, the FLN, who wanted the French out and were willing to set off bombs to do it. It’s a true story, done on location with many of the FLN appearing in it, including the producer who was an FLN leader.\n\nA Special Day (Ettore Scola, 1977)\n\nEttore Scola’s period drama A Special Day poignantly portrays the lives of a housewife and her neighbour amid a pivotal historical event: Adolf Hitler’s visit to Benito Mussolini in Rome. Starring Italian cinematic icons Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni, A Special Day explores enduring societal themes and earned the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film\n\nA Bullet for the General (Damiano Damiani, 1966)\n\nDirected by the politically charged filmmaker Damiano Damiani, and written by Franco Solinas (also Oscar-nominated writer of The Battle Of Algiers), A Bullet for the General is a gripping spaghetti Western delving into themes of revolution, betrayal, and moral ambiguity against the backdrop of the Mexican Revolution. Drawing parallels with the era’s political events, the film offers thought-provoking commentary on power and ideology complexities.\n\n8 1/2 (Federico Fellini, 1963)\n\nFederico Fellini’s timeless masterpiece, 8 1/2, embarks on a cinematic odyssey that delves deep into the intricacies of artistic expression and existential introspection. Revered as a cornerstone of cinematic brilliance, this opulent creation beckons viewers into the enigmatic realm of a visionary maestro.\n\nThe Night Porter (Liliana Cavani, 1974)\n\nLiliana Cavani’s controversial masterpiece challenges societal norms with its unflinching portrayal of a taboo relationship between a former SS officer and a Holocaust survivor. Through its provocative narrative and haunting imagery, The Night Porter continues to find resonance with its unyielding examination of human desire and trauma.\n\nThe Ape Woman (Marco Ferreri, 1964)\n\nThe Ape Woman, the most acclaimed work of the iconoclastic director Marco Ferreri, adds a poignant layer to his oeuvre with its tragic cinematic adaptation of Julia Pastrana, a young carnival performer entirely covered in hair. The film’s Palme d’Or nomination at Cannes underscores its significance and recognition within the cinematic landscape."
