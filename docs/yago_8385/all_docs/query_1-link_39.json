        "text": "Aside from their hilariously clunky titles, the rebooted Planet of the Apes series has repeatedly delivered while surprising me in a number of ways. Going back to the first film, 2011’s “Rise of the Planet of the Apes”, the series has told thematically rich and emotionally impactful stories to go along with state-of-the-art motion capture and visual effects. So I was expecting more of the same with the long-awaited fourth installment, “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes”.\n\nDirected by Wes Ball, “Kingdom” is a standalone sequel to 2017’s “War for the Planet of the Apes”. Its story takes place 300 years after “War”, but the DNA of the previous three films can be seen all throughout it. Unfortunately the execution doesn’t quite live up to its predecessors. To no surprise “Kingdom” looks great and it hits a few good emotional beats. But it struggles mightily to capture the vision and narrative breadth of the Caesar trilogy.\n\nThe issues with “Kingdom” grow more evident over time. First, it’s incredibly slow developing and it takes a long time for the story to gain any traction. That’s made worse by the fact that the movie is far longer than it needs to be. We tread a lot of familiar ground in the arduous 145 minutes which leads to another issue – “Kingdom” has a tough time distinguishing itself, not just from the other three Apes movies, but from other dystopian sci-fi adventures. It walks its own path but utilizes a few too many formulas to get where its going.\n\nSet generations after the death of Caesar, apes have become the dominant species while humans are considered wild and untamed. A young chimpanzee named Noa (Owen Teague) is part of an ape clan devoted to nurturing and training eagles. While out collecting an eagle egg as part of his coming-of-age ritual, Noa witnesses a party of raiders, led by a foreboding gorilla named Sylva (Eka Danville), heading towards his village. Worried, Noa rushes home to find his village under siege.\n\nSylva attacks Noa and leaves him for the dead in the ashes of his village. But Noa survives and when he wakes he finds his father dead and his clan abducted. Heartbroken and driven, Noa sets out to find and rescue his clan. On his journey he crosses paths with Raka (Peter Macon), an erudite orangutan who is faithful to Caesar’s teachings. Raka begins to enlighten Noa on Caesar’s message of peaceful coexistence, especially after noticing they’re being watched by a human girl who they name Nova (Freya Allan).\n\nAfter saving Nova from another roundup by Sylva, the girl reveals that she can speak. She tells them that Noa’s clan has been taken to a coastal settlement ran by an ape monarch named Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand). We learn Proximus is obsessed with a heavily sealed vault that he believes contains old human tech. His zeal has led him to abduct and enslave several ape clans, forcing them to work on opening the vault. As you can probably guess, Noa’s journey leads to a clash with Proximus which is both inevitable and surprisingly unremarkable.\n\nUnremarkable best describes “Kingdom”. There’s nothing glaringly bad about the film. It just never comes close to the thrilling or emotional highs of its predecessors. Neither Noa or Nova are especially compelling, and (judging by the ending) the film seems too focused on setting up yet another Apes trilogy. But perhaps most discouraging is how dull the movie can be. There is plenty of fat that could have been trimmed to make this a tighter and more riveting experience. As it is, “Kingdom” will sit as a serviceable but rather prosaic early summer feature."
