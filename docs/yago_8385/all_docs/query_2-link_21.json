        "text": "A curiosity. It gave Carroll the money to stay in Italy despite that it wasn’t successful. And it’s no wonder why when watching. It’s a wandering drama that could be a proto Italian sex comedy (which Carroll would explore in 3 films later in her Italian period). It draws upon the idea of Carroll Baker as the sex symbol from “Baby Doll.” There’s three men who look alike (and make comments on that in the film). It explores polyamory centered around a woman instead of the more culturally accepted male taking multiple lovers. Of course, the men can’t accept her.\n\nWhen re-watching these Carroll Baker films and giallo, it’s interesting to see how sexuality is teased yet restrained. It’s…\n\nThe launch of Carroll Baker’s excursion (exile?) into the Euro (largely Italian) film industry - but not a Giallo (like in tinges in her quartet of films with Umberto Lenzi), impish provocateur Marco Ferreri doesn’t really do genre. Darkly comic battle of the sexes role reversing stuff that in Ferreri’s hands is never laugh out loud funny but more parable-like and schematic. A scenic meandering film where Baker’s sexy brunette(!) heroine of sorts spends the vast majority of the film in complete power over an array of doting man-children (her “harem”) but one just knows the tables simply must be turned and there will be no equality at the finish line. Carroll, I’m afraid, the cinema can only offer you a long and sordid path leading to perpetual victimhood.\n\n➡️ Marco Ferreri, Ranked\n\nMarco Ferreri's subversive take on gender dynamics is every bit what you would expect it to be, deconstructive, amusing and totally him. Carroll Baker shines in her first Italian role, she's strong in her sexuality as she is beautiful as she toys with the men in her life. It's fitting that she has a pet cheetah as these fickle pathetic men really are her mice to play with... that is until the end. I would be a lot kinder to this film but it shifts into being a look at misogyny leaving me feel rather uncomfortable, obviously the point but it goes against all the fun we had before hand.\n\nI would definitely be a fool subjected to Carroll Baker's games yet I'd like to think I would still treat her with more respect whilst enjoying the 60's vibes and Italian sunshine.\n\nMarco Ferreri directs a 92 minute starring Carroll Baker as a well off attractive woman, courted by several men.\n\nFerreri understands that at heart we're really just stupid animals, the cheetah's placement that had me joking \"bringing up Baker\" kind of makes a case for that.\n\nAlso the cheetah steals the scenes it happens to be in.\n\nThere's the friendly sap, the conservative guy, the obnoxious American guy, the square momma's boy, what's linking them is they've their own ideas about women we're not likely to agree on, Carroll's character is a shallow teaser of a woman, but you understand she wants some respect.\n\nThe dumb costumes they dress up in is a culmination of how daffy these characters are.…\n\nGreat cinematography with Carroll Baker looking absolutely stunning in this film in her European debut. Also it has a great score by Ennio Morricone.\n\nPlot wise, this film started off as fun and sexy and it just went downhill from there with a depressing finale.\n\nThe Cheetah was the high point for me and especially seeing it eating spaghetti."
