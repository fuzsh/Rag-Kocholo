        "text": "To judge from \"El Pisito\" (\"The Little Apartment\"), an excessively noisy, dark comedy directed by the Spanish film maker Marco Ferreri, New York City's real estate squeeze in the 1980's was nothing compared with Madrid's in the 1950's. In the movie's vision of real estate hell, middle-class people who can't afford modern housing -- and that seems to be almost everyone -- often live eight to an apartment in a space that is more appropriate for two. Because of overcrowding, thin ceilings and frequently raised voices, apartment living often borders on bedlam.\n\nRodolfo (Jose Luis Lopez Vazquez), a novelty-store clerk, is a typical victim of the squeeze. Along with several others, he leases a room in the four-room apartment of Dona Martina (Concha Lopez Silva), a crotchety woman in her 80's who is dying.\n\nUntil he can afford his own place, Rodolfo cannot marry Petrita (Mary Carrillo), his increasingly embittered fiancee of 12 years. So desperate has the situation grown that Petrita persuades her meek boyfriend to propose to Dona Martina. If he marries her, he can inherit the apartment at its current affordable rent. When Rodolfo balks, Petrita takes matters into her own hands and forces the arrangement.\n\nBut marriage agrees with Dona Martina, who dotes on her new husband in the same way she dotes on her cat. To everyone's dismay, she lingers on for more than two years."
