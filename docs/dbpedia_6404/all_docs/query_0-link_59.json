Now that you are equipped with this vocabulary, you can more accurately convey time in English.\n\n10\n\nTime Expressions\n\nTo effectively communicate time in English, you need to be familiar with common time expressions.\n\nAt the crack of dawn: Very early in the morning.\n\nAt dawn: When the day starts, at sunrise.\n\nIn the morning: The period after sunrise and before noon.\n\nAround noon: Approximately at midday.\n\nIn the afternoon: The period after midday and before the evening.\n\nAt dusk: The period just before the night begins, at sunset.\n\nIn the evening: The period after sunset and before bedtime.\n\nAt midnight: Precisely at the start of a new day.\n\nPast/After: Used to indicate minutes after the hour, such as \"ten past eight.\"\n\nTo/Before: Used to show minutes before the next hour, like \"quarter to nine.\"\n\nBeing able to use and understand these time expressions is key to your daily communication. These phrases give you the power to be specific about timeframes, which will make your English conversations more precise and meaningful.\n\nPhrases and Questions\n\nNow you're ready to build and understand sentences about time.
