Whether you're using these terms to specify an exact hour, minute, or even a fraction of an hour, they are the fundamental components of English time.\n\nClock Terminology\n\nNow, let's explore some common terminology related to clocks, which are the primary tools for telling time.\n\nClock: A device used to measure and display time.\n\nHand: refers to one of the pointing devices attached to the center of the clock face that rotates to indicate specific units of time.\n\nHour Hand: The shorter hand on a clock that indicates the hour.\n\nMinute Hand: The longer hand that points to the minutes.\n\nSecond Hand: The hand that moves fastest, showing the seconds.\n\nFace: The front part of a clock where the hands and numbers are displayed.\n\nO’clock: Used to indicate a precise hour, such as \"seven o’clock.\"\n\nMidnight: The start of a new day, or 12:00 at night.\n\nNoon: The middle of the day, or 12:00 in the afternoon.\n\nA.M.: Stands for \"ante meridiem,\" Latin for \"before midday.\" It is used to denote morning hours.\n\nP.M.: Stands for \"post meridiem,\" Latin for \"after midday.\" It indicates afternoon and evening hours.\n\nFamiliarity with clock terminology not only helps you to tell time but also allows you to describe and understand various aspects related to clocks. Now that you are equipped with this vocabulary, you can more accurately convey time in English.\n\n10\n\nTime Expressions\n\nTo effectively communicate time in English, you need to be familiar with common time expressions.\n\nAt the crack of dawn: Very early in the morning.\n\nAt dawn: When the day starts, at sunrise.\n\nIn the morning: The period after sunrise and before noon.\n\nAround noon: Approximately at midday.\n\nIn the afternoon: The period after midday and before the evening.\n\nAt dusk: The period just before the night begins, at sunset.\n\nIn the evening: The period after sunset and before bedtime.\n\nAt midnight: Precisely at the start of a new day.\n\nPast/After: Used to indicate minutes after the hour, such as \"ten past eight.\"\n\nTo/Before: Used to show minutes before the next hour, like \"quarter to nine.\"\n\nBeing able to use and understand these time expressions is key to your daily communication. These phrases give you the power to be specific about timeframes, which will make your English conversations more precise and meaningful.\n\nPhrases and Questions\n\nNow you're ready to build and understand sentences about time.
