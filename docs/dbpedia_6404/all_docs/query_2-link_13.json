        "text": "\"I have a bad feeling about this\" is a well-known phrase in Star Wars and has become a running gag throughout the saga, as well as several different Lucasfilm stories and other works. The phrase is spoken for the first time in Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope by Luke Skywalker when he says he has a \"bad feeling\" about the small moon (The Death Star, unknown to him) he and his friends in the Millennium Falcon were approaching. The phrase reappeared at least once in each subsequent movie. It is also heavily featured and referenced in other Star Wars media, such as books, comics and video games, where the locution can vary in its exact wording. When spoken, the A in \"bad\" is sometimes drawn out, as \"I have a baad feeling about this.\" The phrase is also occasionally referenced by having a character say \"I have a good feeling about this,\" or something to that effect.[2]\n\nStar Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi is the first Star Wars film to not feature \"I have a bad feeling about this\" spoken in Galactic Basic Standard.
