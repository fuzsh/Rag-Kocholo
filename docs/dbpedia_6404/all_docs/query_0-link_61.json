GUR: ACOM.\n\nA writing course designed to prepare students for college-level creative, critical, and reflective writing. Because writing looks and works differently in different contexts, this course teaches the rhetorical competencies that students need to write across multiple disciplines. The course introduces students both to the processes of building and analyzing ideas, and to ways of communicating those ideas in context-specific genres for targeted audiences. This course has the immediate goal of preparing students to succeed in their writing at Western, but it will also serve them personally and professionally. Students needing to satisfy Block A of the communications section of the General University Requirements, which ENG 101 does, are required to do so prior to completion of 45 credits. Students with a 4 or 5 AP score are encouraged to take this class so they can learn to adapt their test-taking skills to college coursework.\n\nOVERRIDES / CAPACITY OVERRIDES ARE NEVER GRANTED FOR ENGLISH 101.\n\n200-Level English Courses\n\nENG 201 Writing in Humanities: Reimagining Representation 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 101 or 4/5 AP English Language Exam.\n\nCRN: 22076 DAY/TIME: MWF 08:30-09:50 am Instructor: Redwoman, Zoe\n\nAgainst what do we measure? Who decides what matters? What’s “normal”? What’s right? How do we internalize those ideas and beliefs? How do contemporary authors help us redefine or reimagine “what counts”? In this course, we will examine representation, influence, and the ways in which we are “measured against” in the various fields of humanities. We will ground our work in contemporary literature (TBD) and venture from there to where our curiosity leads us. As a class, we will follow the same overarching questions, but where you follow them, down which rabbit-hole you go, will be up to you.\n\nENG 202 Writing About Literature 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 101.\n\nCRN: 20125 DAY/TIME: TR 12:00-01:50 pm Instructor: Bridges, D'Angelo\n\nIn this course, students will learn strategies for the close reading of and writing about literary texts. We will primarily focus on works written by twentieth-century African American writers.\n\nCRN: 20240 DAY/TIME: MWF 11:30-12:50 pm Instructor: Forsythe, Jenny Marie\n\nA writing course designed to help students develop the skills of close reading and careful analysis of literary texts, with particular attention to how language, style, and form contribute to a text’s social or political claims. Introduces students to the challenge of situating themselves in relation to a literary text and the critical conversation about that text, and crafting multi-draft critical essays with a focused, arguable thesis supported by thoughtful sequence of claims and carefully selected textual evidence.\n\nCRN: 20654 DAY/TIME: TR 08:00-09:50 am Instructor: Prichard, Tony\n\nThis course directs attention to where literature and madness overlap by examining texts that either include characters experiencing hallucinations or texts that claim to produce madness. We will inquire into the differences between madness, weirdness and that which is yet to be articulated and made habitual.\n\nRequired Texts\n\n• Clark, P. Djèlí. Ring Shout\n\n• Shadows of Carcosa: Tales of Cosmic Horror by Lovecraft, Chambers, Machen, Poe,\n\nand Other Masters of the Weird\n\n• A People’s Future of the United States\n\n• Solomon, Rivers & clipping. The Deep\n\nCRN: 24214 DAY/TIME: TR 10:00-11:50 am Instructor: Lee, Jean\n\nIn this course, we will learn the close reading of literary techniques, literary interpretation, and literary argumentation by engaging deeply with Caribbean literature foregrounding how race, gender, and sexuality constitute feminist subjectivities. We will read poems, short stories, essays, song lyrics, and novels that respond to postcolonial and diasporic contexts. Throughout the quarter, we will query how Caribbean women define “freedom” from a racialized, gendered, and sexualized perspective that destabilizes ethnopatriarchal and heteronormative conditions of visibility and citizenship in postcolonial nations and abroad.\n\nCRN: 20660 DAY/TIME: TR 10:00-11:50 am Instructor: Bell, Michael Patrick\n\nThis section of English 202 involves critical inquiry into the literary effect of “speculative fiction,” which for our purposes we can define as the literatures of the imagination: fantasy, science-fiction, horror, alternate history. Such fiction has become arguably the dominant mode of contemporary narrative production, so there is rich opportunity to explore the power these literatures have had on history and culture. The specific forms we will study will of course include the written word, but because so much of our contemporary culture is expressed and reflected in the visual realm, we will be making constant connection to TV, film, comics, and game narratives in our inquiries.\n\nAll of our study will assume that whatever form it takes, fictional narrative has the power to construct and inform our worldly experience, even our reality. To sometimes great extent, we model our identities on literary stories, and build our perspectives from them. By making connection to our experiences and histories, stories illuminate the world, permitting us to see more texture and variety and possibility in our lives. Through intensive reading, discussion, activity, and writing we will further develop our ability to make meaning from the texts we study, focusing our analyses through formal critical practices as well as rigorous play and experimentation. You will emerge from the course a stronger analytic writer and reader with greater appreciation of the power of literature to bring you to deeper self-knowledge and increased awareness of a wider, richer, more complex world.\n\nTEXTS: The Fifth Season, N.K Jemisin, This is How You Lose the Time War, Max Gladstone, A Dreamer’s Tales, Lord Dunsany, Palimpsest, Catherynne M. Valente, A Psalm for the Wild Built, Becky Chambers\n\nASSIGNMENTS: In addition to reading assignments and participation in class activities, requirements will comprise one formal analytical paper, several informal writing assignments, and a final project.\n\nCRN: 20661 DAY/TIME: MWF 10:00-11:20 am Instructor: Redwoman, Zoe\n\nWhy do Indigenous Literatures matter? That is the question asked by Cherokee scholar and writer, Daniel Heath Justice in his book of the same name. In English 202, we will work to answer that question (and a few more) by carefully reading contemporary Indigenous Literature and responding, in writing and discussion, to all the work that Indigenous Literature is doing. We will learn to read and work closely with our course texts and produce writing that engages with the larger discourses of literature, storytelling, and representation.\n\nCRN: 21081 DAY/TIME: MWF 08:30-09:50 am Instructor: Wise, Christopher\n\nCourse Description\n\nIn this course, we will analyze and interpret various literary genres, including poetry, plays, films, as well as literary fiction and nonfiction, with the goal of preparing students for advanced work in literary study, especially writing college-level essays in literary criticism. In addition to studying prominent works of literature, student papers may sometimes be workshopped in class.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nStudents will be required to regularly attend class, perform all reading and film assignments, and turn in all formal and informal assignments. No laptops or cellphones are allowed in the classroom. Students are also required to bring writing paper and pens to class, as informal written assignments will often be turned in during class. Students should come to class having already read the required literature and/or viewed required film listed on the course schedule.\n\nWriting Assignments [70% of grade]:\n\nWritten assignments will include the following: (1) miscellaneous short story analyses; (2) miscellaneous poetry analyses; (3) translation exercises; (4) film analysis; (5) play analysis; (6) comparative formal paper on long narrative; (7) take-home final essay exam. Written assignments will comprise 70% of grade. There is not a set number of assignments we will perform, as the total number of writing assignments will depend upon how much we are able to accomplish during each class session; however, it is likely you will write approximately 5-7 different writing assignments that will be graded. An average will then be calculated based on these assignments to determine the 70% total average.\n\nIn addition to formal and informal writing assignments, students will select one long narrative and be assigned to a group comprised of approximately 3 students. Students will then meet in groups outside of class to prepare oral reports on their assigned long narrative. More instructions about oral reports will be forthcoming; however, students will divide the tasks in preparation for reports of approximately 25-30 minutes total per group. Students will also each select a short poem to memorize and recite to the class from memory. They will also write a brief essay on the poem that they have memorized that will be due the same day as their oral recitation.\n\nParticipation-Attendance [30% of grade]\n\nAttendance will be taken for every class session. Participation-attendance will comprise 30% of grade. Sometimes, ungraded in-class writing will be factored into your class participation grade, rather than your written assignments grade. Class participation grade will also include poetry recitations, group meetings in preparation for group reports, and the group reports on your selected long narrative. You cannot receive the full class participation grade without fully participating. Informal writing assignments submitted during class cannot be made up.\n\nCourse Texts\n\nWilliam Shakespeare, Hamlet\n\nJames Joyce, Dubliners\n\nCRN: 21822 DAY/TIME: TR 02:00-03:50 pm Instructor: Rivera\n\n“Books are a form of political action. Books are knowledge. Books are reflection. Books change your mind.” These words, voiced by Toni Morrison, whose work we will encounter this quarter, endow literature with a tremendous amount of value and power. Literature effects change, prompts reflection, and shapes minds. Yet how does it do this? What separates ‘literary’ texts – novels, short stories, poetry – from non-literary texts – instruction manuals, catalogs, hiking guidebooks? How does literature interact with the broader social, cultural, and political structures and systems that influence our daily lives? Why are some texts considered more beautiful than others? What makes some interpretations of literary texts stronger than others? In this class we will work together to answer these questions, or at least try to answer them, by examining literary texts across three distinct genres: short fiction, novels, and poetry. We will also center the work of Black writers in the United States, including Toni Morrison, Tracy K. Smith, Claudia Rankine, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.\n\nENG 215 British Literature 5cr\n\nCRN: 23923 DAY/TIME: MWF 01:00-02:20 pm Instructor: Amendt-Raduege, Amy Michelle\n\nAnalysis, interpretation and discussion of a range of texts in British literature with attention to cultural contexts.\n\nENG 216 American Literature 5cr\n\nCRN: 23635 DAY/TIME: TR 10:00-11:50 am Instructor: Roach Orduña, José\n\nFight the Power – Contemporary American Writers Take on the Empire\n\nIn this class we will read literary essays, short stories, and poems written by contemporary US-based authors that dare to take on the systems of oppression in force in this country. We will examine how they do this in ways particular to literary art, how language and form can come together as a weapon in the struggle for justice, how writers participate in social movements through their literary output. We will read writers who write from different vantage points in relation to the US empire, writers like Karla Cornejo Villavicencio, Kiese Laymon, Joe Bageant, Nafissa Thompson-Spires, Solmaz Sharif, and Javier Zamora among others. We will read supplementary texts that engage the social problematics our literary texts do. Much of our class will be lecture and discussion based, but we will also have plenty of in-class activities and group work. We will write reading reflections, do group presentations, take weekly quizzes, and take a short answer midterm and final exam.\n\nENG 227 Queer Literature 5cr\n\nCRN: 23637 DAY/TIME: MWF 11:30-12:50 pm Instructor: Roach Orduña, Caitlin\n\nThis course will serve as an introduction to contemporary American queer literature. In it, will examine a variety of contemporary works of poetry, fiction, nonfiction, graphic nonfiction, film, and photography. Among many questions we’ll investigate in this course, we will constantly ask: in what ways do queer authors, texts and narratives intersect with broader social, political, and cultural contexts, and how do they contribute to discussions of identity and power?\n\nENG 239 Latina/o Literatures 5cr\n\nCRN: 23638 DAY/TIME: TR 12:00-01:50 pm Instructor: Rivera, Lysa\n\nAnalysis, interpretation and discussion of a range of texts in English and in translation by Latina/o authors.\n\n300-Level English Courses\n\nENG 301 Wrtg Stds: Writing for Change 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 101; junior status; or instructor permission. Major restrictions will be lifted on Thursday Feb 29 at 4:30pm.\n\nCRN: 20072 DAY/TIME: MWF 01:00-02:20 pm Instructor: Redwoman, Zoe\n\nIn this section, we will examine the different forms in which people write to effect change. We will explore, among others, grant writing, op-eds, letters to your government, and stories representing unheard voices. What are the rhetorical strategies these writings use? What are the constraints or conventions of these genres? What is at stake in each situation? As a class, we will work to examine how, as writers, we can work to contribute to the worlds in which we live.\n\nENG 302 Technical Writing 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 101; junior standing. Major restrictions will be lifted on Thursday Feb 29 at 4:30pm.\n\nCRN: 20135 DAY/TIME: TR 10:00-11:50 am Instructor: McGuire, Simon Leonard\n\nStudents engage with the rhetorical and technical practices for creating artifacts that help people do things with technology, such as usability testing, screencasting, web authoring, document design, and information architecture. The course covers a variety of technical genres and focuses on the ethical and social implications of a technical writer's choices.\n\nCRN: 20319 DAY/TIME: TR 12:00-01:50 pm Instructor: Forsberg, Geri\n\nEnglish 302 is the English department’s introductory 300-level workshop course in technical writing. It is for juniors and seniors. It is a 5-credit writing proficiency course. English 302 emphasizes the writer-reader relationship in a variety of nonacademic writing situations. Students learn to identify their audience, develop objectives, organize the content of their documents and revise documents for readability. Students write and design a resume, letters, memos, a proposal, a formal report, an infographic, and a visual presentation. Students also learn to work in small breakout groups, collaborate on writing, and give peer feedback. The final project in this course is a professional portfolio which provides examples of your strongest work. When you have completed this course, you should be ready to write in the professional world.\n\nCRN: 20378 DAY/TIME: TR 02:00-03:50 pm Instructor: Forsberg, Geri\n\nEnglish 302 is the English department’s introductory 300-level workshop course in technical writing.

The course covers a variety of technical genres and focuses on the ethical and social implications of a technical writer's choices.\n\nCRN: 20432 DAY/TIME: TR 10:00-11:50 am Instructor: Sarkar, Rachel Diane\n\nEnglish 302 addresses the essential elements of technical writing—or writing in action. My underlying objective for English 302 is to explore the power of language to change people, events, and self. We’ll explore ways to use writing skills to accomplish personal, professional, and ideological goals. In the process, we’ll also consider the use of humor, empathy, ethics, and storytelling in technical writing.\n\nCRN: 20520 DAY/TIME: TR 08:00-09:50 am Instructor: Bell, Michael Patrick\n\nIn this section of English 302 you’ll develop your skill in generating reader-centered documents that work: documents that do things as well as say things, performing specific functions for specific kinds of readers. Given that so much of our culture now communicates and conducts its business in the visual realm, your work in the course will be focused as much on document design as written language. Through this work you will gain an understanding of how all the elements of a document work together to communicate within specific contexts, for specific audiences.\n\nEnglish 302 is not simply a skills-acquisition course however. We will use technical communication as a field in which to conduct analytic inquiry appropriate to study in the humanities. This quarter the analytic component of the course will take us into a study of games and the culture surrounding them: both table-top and video games. As a student of the course, you will be collaborating with other students on a series of documents, presentations, and prototypes leading to the development of an original tabletop game. The design of your game will be based in part on contemporary game studies and critiques. Every stage of this inquiry will generate documents in accord with the guidelines of effective technical and professional communication. (And yes, we will be playing games in class!)\n\nYou will emerge from the course with the ability to respond effectively to the requirements of technical communication. You will also have a complex understanding of what is becoming a vital aspect of our contemporary culture.\n\nENG 307 Seminar: Medieval 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 202. Major restrictions lift for Creative Writing Majors (without an endorsement) on Monday Mar 4 by 10am. All major restrictions will be lifted on Tuesday Mar 5 by 10am.\n\nCRN: 22354 DAY/TIME: MWF 08:30-09:50 am Instructor: Amendt-Raduege, Amy Michelle\n\nThe seminar and survey time periods are not repeatable. Do not take ENG 307 if you have taken ENG 307 or ENG 317.\n\nThe Middle Ages spanned 1000 years of some of the most dynamic and fascinating growth in world history. In this iteration of the class, we focus on the literature and culture of England, but this tiny island offers us a microcosm of the medieval period at large. We wrestle with ideas of kingship and heroism with Beowulf, watch the rise and fall of nations with Gildas and Bede, struggle with the purpose of life with the Wanderer and the Seafarer, and laugh at the double meanings of riddles. We’ll also experience tangible aspects of the period in the form of physical artifacts: you’ll get to touch a real medieval manuscript and even make your own masterpiece. The wonders of the medieval world await.\n\nENG 308 Seminar: Early Modern 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 202. Major restrictions lift for Creative Writing Majors (without an endorsement) on Monday Mar 4 by 10am. All major restrictions will be lifted on Tuesday Mar 5 by 10am.\n\nCRN: 22078 DAY/TIME: MWF 10:00-11:20 am Instructor: Lester, Mark M.\n\nThe seminar and survey time periods are not repeatable. If you have taken ENG 308 or ENG 318, do not take ENG 308.\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThis course is a survey of 16th and 17th century fiction, poetry and drama focusing on the cultural significance of early modern representations of nature in general, and of the forest in particular. In Shakespeare’s As You Like It, the forest is contrasted to the court and is said to have a great deal to teach us. The majority of the action of Loves’ Labours’ Lost takes place in the park surrounding the royal court. The manner in which such representations have shaped our relationship to the woods, our sense of our place in the world, will also be explored.\n\nTEXTS:\n\nNorton Anthology of English Literature: vol b – 16th Century/Early 17th Century; Shakespeare: As You\n\nLike It and Love’s Labours’ Lost (Arden Shakespeare Editions). Additional materials will be distributed in\n\nclass or posted on Canvas.\n\nENG 309 Seminar: The Long 18th Century 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 202. Major restrictions lift for Creative Writing Majors (without an endorsement) on Monday Mar 4 by 10am. All major restrictions will be lifted on Tuesday Mar 5 by 10am.\n\nCRN: 21283 DAY/TIME: TR 02:00-03:50 pm Instructor: Loar, Christopher F.\n\nThe seminar and survey time periods are not repeatable. Do not take ENG 309 if you have already taken ENG 319 or 309.\n\nThe long eighteenth century in Great Britain used to be thought of as a time of religious reconciliation. After the bloody religious conflicts of the 1640s and 1650s—which claimed tens of thousands of lives--the decades that followed have often been seen as a time of reconciliation. In this course we’ll challenge that assumption: this period’s writing and thought are still characterized by a conflicts between competing versions of Christianity, as well as by emerging forms of religious skepticism (including both deism and outright atheism), as well as an ongoing interest in supposedly “exotic” religious practices and beliefs found in Asia and among indigenous peoples in the Americas and the Pacific.\n\nThese topics were of course addressed in somewhat dry theological works and sermons. We’ll look at a few of those, but most of our attention will go to the vibrant works of poetry, fiction, and autobiography that characterize this period. While the reading list is still taking shape, we will certainly engage with writings by Aphra Behn, this period’s most prominent female playwright and poet; John Milton, John Dryden, Anne Finch, and Alexander Pope, brilliant and controversial poets whose writing struggled over the relationship between religious belief and political life; Olaudah Equiano, a formerly enslaved writer and political activist; and Phillis Wheatley, an enslaved poet whose writing challenged readers on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nNo special knowledge of Christianity or other religious traditions is needed for this course—lectures and readings will give you all the information you need. It should also be clear that no religious belief (or nonbelief) is expected, though respect for the beliefs of others in the classroom is of course a basic requirement of this course (as for any course at WWU).\n\nCourse requirements will likely include regular engagement in class meetings; several informal response papers (2-3 paragraphs); and a longer culminating writing project.\n\nENG 310 Seminar: The Long 19th Century 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 202. Major restrictions lift for Creative Writing Majors (without an endorsement) on Monday Mar 4 by 10am. All major restrictions will be lifted on Tuesday Mar 5 by 10am.\n\nCRN: 21284 DAY/TIME: TR 04:00-05:50 pm Instructor: Yeasting, Jeanne Ellen\n\nThe seminar and survey time periods are not repeatable. Do not take ENG 310 if you have already taken ENG 320 or 310.\n\nA research and writing intensive course in the context of the literary history of the long nineteenth century. Students will develop the skills to research and write about literary texts and participate in the critical conversations about them.\n\nENG 311 Seminar: The 20-21st Century 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 202. Major restrictions lift for Creative Writing Majors (without an endorsement) on Monday Mar 4 by 10am. All major restrictions will be lifted on Tuesday Mar 5 by 10am.\n\nCRN: 21285 DAY/TIME: MWF 11:30-12:50 pm Instructor: Prichard, Tony\n\nThe seminar and survey time periods are not repeatable. Do not take ENG 311 if you have already taken ENG 321 or 311.\n\nA research and writing intensive course in the context of the literary history of the 20-21st century. Students will develop the skills to research and write about literary texts and participate in the critical conversations about them.\n\nENG 313 Critical Theories & Prac I 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 202. Major restrictions lift on Tuesday Mar 5th by 10am.\n\nCRN: 20073 DAY/TIME: MWF 02:30-03:50 pm Instructor: Lester, Mark M.\n\nIn this course, we will examine a series of questions concerning the nature, function, and value of literature. What is a work of literature? How does it work? What is if for? On what grounds should it be judged or assessed? Under what circumstances might it be censored? Should the literary work of art be conceived of strictly as an object of analysis (something to be interpreted and explained) or do works of literature themselves have a distinct, dynamic, critical and constructive dimension in their own right? What can we say about the authors and readers of literary works and the sort of knowledge to which they lay claim? Using Plato as the starting point of our survey of theory and criticism from ancient times through the Enlightenment, we will follow a number of trajectories or threads that will allow us to explore the intersections of literature, philosophy, politics, and science.\n\nTexts\n\nVincent B. Leitch, et al. (ed.),The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism, Third Edition); Benjamin Jowett\n\n(trans.), Selected Dialogues of Plato. Other materials will be made available on Canvas.\n\nCRN: 23121 DAY/TIME: TR 12:00-01:50 pm Instructor: Vulic, Kathryn Rajam\n\nCourse Description:\n\nIn this class we will explore and demystify some of the vocabularies and ideas that are the foundations of modern cultural thought and criticism. This course has some similarities with a philosophy class, because we are going to be exploring big and important concepts, breaking them down in our discussions to better understand them. But because this is an English class, we will be focusing our attention on how these ideas help us better understand language, literature, and other forms of human expression, and we will use these ideas for our own literary analysis and interpretation. ENG 313 and ENG 314 are organized in terms of time periods, so ENG 313 takes on the early history of the field, up to the 19th c. Theory classes can seem daunting to those who have never studied this kind of material before, so let me assure you: you can do this. You just need to be willing to engage with big ideas, to think about thinking, and to devote some time to learning unfamiliar terms and ways of expressing ideas.\n\nClass expectations:\n\nConsistent attendance, active engagement. We will be depending heavily on class conversation to help us work though and understand the texts.\n\nReading journal. I will ask you to keep a handwritten journal of your thoughts, questions, and reactions for each day’s text. (If you have a formal accommodation, we will discuss alternatives.)\n\nOccasional in-class writing to review and reflect on the class texts.\n\nOne short paper (4-5 pages) drawing on one of our class theoretical texts to help you interpret a text of your choice.\n\nCourse Text:\n\nThe majority of our readings will be from The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism, 3rd edition, which is a fantastic resource for the history of ideas (use ISBN: 978-0-393-60295-1 to verify you have found the right edition). This can be an expensive book when bought new, but used copies are widely available, and you may also be able to check out a copy from the library (double-check the edition!). If cost is a barrier, let’s talk about options.\n\nENG 314 Critical Theories & Prac II 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 202. Major restrictions lift on Tuesday Mar 5th by 10am.\n\nCRN: 22357 DAY/TIME: MWF 01:00-02:20 pm Instructor: Dietrich, Dawn Y.\n\nRequired Texts:\n\nThe Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism (3rd edition), Leitch, Cain, Finke, et al.\n\nExcerpts from A Critical and Cultural Theory Reader (2nd edition), Antony Easthope and Kate\n\nMcGowan (Canvas PDFs)\n\nCourse Description\n\nWant to think about how we construct identities? Why gender, sexuality, and race matter? Why texts are political? How capitalism, immigration, and climate change are related? How power is embedded within our institutions and practices? And how to create meaningful change within our communities and the broader world? This class will utilize critical and cultural theories to help us think about literary texts and methodologies--as well as engage the pressing issues of our day. We will do so through so a wide range of readings and examples from contemporary culture.\n\nThe course will begin by providing an overview of structuralist and post-structuralist literary and critical theories, from Ferdinand de Saussure’s insights about language as a sign system to N. Katherine Hayles’ analysis of cognitive assemblages and Bruno Latour’s work on politics and climate change. We will engage a full range of readings and media selections from post-Marxism; new materialism/object-oriented ontology; eco-criticism/Anthropocene; feminism, gender and sexuality studies; disability studies; critical race theory; post-colonialism; and Indigenous knowledge systems. Course questions and themes will investigate the embodied perspectives we assume in the material world and how these perspectives shape our reading and writing practices as well as our behavior, generally. The digital context in which we find ourselves necessitates our thinking about our relationship to “things” and “machines” as well as peoples and cultures. And the current climate crisis requires us to think about the relationship of all systems and networks, including those involving non-human animals, geological processes, and inanimate objects. By the time you’ve completed this course, you will be able to identify the ideological perspectives and inherent biases embedded within texts, whether written, spoken (aural), or visual; and you will understand how to use critical thinking to inform your agency and advocacy in the larger, civic world.\n\nAssignments\n\nCourse work will include the assigned readings; class discussions and small group problem-solving; and multimodal blog writing.\n\nEvaluation\n\nCourse evaluation will be determined by writing critical/multimodal blogs, working with small group assignments, and engaging in workshops and peer response.\n\nENG 317 Survey: Medieval 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 101.

Do not take ENG 317 if you have taken ENG 307 or ENG 317.\n\nPRE-16TH CENTURY Survey\n\nCourse Description and Objectives: This course covers the first era in our Literature and Culture sequence, starting with the origins of English literature from its earliest surviving writings to the advent of the printing press in England. This is an exciting time in English literature and history when enduring literary conventions were being established, and iconic literary subjects such as King Arthur and courtly love were first being written down. This course celebrates the fascinating and sometimes bizarre (to 21st century readers) literature of the past and offers models for how any modern reader can develop expertise with a body of literature with which they may have little in common. To explore these subjects, this class will sample a broad array of genres, techniques, forms, and themes of the literature of medieval England.\n\nBy the end of the quarter you will understand the ways in which English language and literature waned and waxed over the course of the Old English and Middle English periods, and how English vied with French and Latin as a medium of communication. You will learn to recognize the characteristics of many of the common medieval literary forms, as well as the reasons for their use (e.g., polemical, pedagogical, recreational). You will learn about medieval culture and literary tastes, as they are reflected in the course readings.\n\nThis class aims at breadth of coverage (with course readings consisting of excerpts as well as whole texts), rather than depth, though this course could be designed productively either way. This class focuses on what it meant to read and write in Middle English, and therefore strives not only for a general understanding of the politics and other social factors that influence writing in English, but also examines the range of writing interests expressed by those who chose to compose in English.\n\nTextbook: Broadview Anthology of British Literature, Vol. 1: The Medieval Period (3rd ed. 2014, or Revised 3rd ed. 2023 – either one is fine) and supplements posted to Canvas.\n\nAssignments and evaluation: This class uses contract grading to help you work toward a grade of your choosing. The assignments are a mix of daily reading and discussion preparation, small research or creative projects meant to help you explore connections between our class material and our contemporary lives, and a series of check-ins that let me see what you are learning and how. Your course grade will be determined by the grading contract as well.\n\nENG 318 Survey: Early Modern 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 101.

These are such dynamic years in the literature of what becomes the United States. We will read literary works by people of various races, ethnicities, religions, and economic positions that explore vital issues of the day such as liberty, literacy, revolution, and science. We will examine the various ways in which a dominant rich male Whiteness is challenged as America and American identities are formed and defined.\n\nASSIGNMENTS: Two essay exams (a midterm and a final), a participation grade, and much reading, writing, and thinking, along with steady attendance, group work, and various out-of-class assignments.\n\nTEXT: Norton Anthology of American Literature, Vol. A, Beginnings to 1865\n\nISBN 978-0-303-88617-7\n\nENG 321 Survey: The 20-21st Centuries 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 101.

Focusing on handmade comics and contemporary Indie presses, we will explore the intersectional themes of identity, community, and agency. Through our diverse range of texts, we will try to articulate and understand the strange, the beautiful, the complex, and the interesting . . . in these graphic narratives. The selected texts feature marginalized and under-represented characters and themes, including topics such as love and friendship (relationship building), depression, sexuality, resiliency, and loneliness/isolation. We will celebrate comix as a potentially queer space where openness, fluidity, and non-conformity represent textual strategies as well as characters’ identities. The themes in these writers’ works intersect and overlap with politics and rebellion while highlighting the complex ways in which individuals are situated in larger generational, regional, and national contexts. We will also study comix form and technique and you will have the opportunity to write about comix and create your own small comix in the course. No artistic experience or illustrating talent is required for the Studio Comix assignments. Students receive full credit for playing with the prompts! I invite you to share your favorite comix or web comix on the Canvas Graffiti Board throughout the quarter.\n\n*Please note: this class content contains adult language and themes.\n\nAssignments and Evaluation\n\nYou will have the opportunity to read fabulous graphic novels and learn about the Seattle art scene. Reading comics requires a knowledge of the artform and an introduction to technical aspects of graphic art, which is super fun and interesting in itself. You will have the opportunity to write multimodal blogs during the quarter as well as practice your own comic-making with Studio Comix exercises that come with full credit for completing the assignment! No artistic experience or illustrating talent is required. This seminar is geared for both literature and creative writing students as well as students in other majors who are interested in comix.\n\nRequired Texts\n\nUnderstanding Comics, Scott McCloud (PDF available)\n\nComix Criticism (Selected PDFs available)\n\nComix Samples, Eroyn Franklin (in-class demonstration and online)\n\nSkim, Mariko Tamaki and Jillian Tamaki\n\nLaura Dean Keeps Breaking Up with Me, Mariko Tamaki and Rosemary Valero-O’Connell\n\nMegahex, Simon Hanselmann\n\nHot Comb, Ebony Flowers\n\nMy Favorite Thing is Monsters (vol. 1), Emil Ferris\n\nSabrina, Nick Drnaso\n\nENG 335 Global Texts Outside N.Am&Eur: Global Horror 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 101 or equivalent.\n\nCRN: 22698 DAY/TIME: TR 10:00-11:50 am Instructor: Prichard, Tony\n\nWe will examine the literature of horror and the weird throughout the world.\n\nRequired Texts\n\n• Jenkins and Cagle eds, The Valancourt book of World Horror Stories Vols 1 and 2.\n\n• Vandermeer, Ann and Jeff ed.

At this time, large numbers of women began to self-consciously craft careers and literary identities as professional writers, and we will read their work in their historical and cultural context. Political, economic, and cultural forces profoundly affected the literary professionalization of American women writers: the Industrial Revolution gains momentum, the middle class begins to grow, literacy rates increase, and white middle-class women’s work becomes increasingly relegated to the home. We will consider how this context leads to a specifically racialized ideal of womanhood that becomes intimately associated with motherhood and domesticity. Finally, we will look to the strategies these women relied upon to participate in the more public work of reform, especially as it relates to slavery. Writers will include Ann Bradstreet, Phillis Wheatley, Emily Dickinson, Harriet Jacobs, Louisa May Alcott, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Lydia Maria Child, and Zorah Neal Hurston.\n\nENG 342 Studies in Literary Genres 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 202.

These books all address complex notions about identity, power, race, sexuality, gender, class, love, and voice. We’ll explore the texts from a variety of angles, asking questions of the texts themselves and readers’ responses to the texts. In addition to exploring the books, we’ll think about the histories of childhood and adolescence, and how youth culture is represented. We’ll address issues of consumerism, popular culture, and technology, looking at their effects on this genre of literature and its target audience. You should expect much intensive reading and lively discussion.\n\nTEXTS: may include: Trung Le Nguyen, The Magic Fish; Isabel Quintero, Gabi, A Girl in Pieces; Andrea Rogers, Man Made Monsters; Neal Shusterman, Challenger Deep; Ibi Zoboi and Yusef Salaam, Punching the Air.\n\nASSIGNMENTS: Reading responses; discussion questions; culminating mixed-media project\n\nENG 350 Intro to Creative Writing 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 101. Major restrictions lift on Tuesday Mar 5th by 10am.\n\nCRN: 20136 DAY/TIME: TR 10:00-11:50 am Instructor: Gulyas, Lee R.\n\nThis course will introduce you to the process of writing—the reading, drafting, craft elements, analysis, extensive revision, focus, and discipline that are essential. You will explore, develop, rethink, and revise with the final goal of a portfolio of creative work. This is a skills class, one that will require practice and participation. We will work in fiction, creative nonfiction, and poetry.\n\nAssignments include: exercises, readings, analysis, discussions on a variety of topics, and extensive revision of your own drafts into your final portfolio, held together by an analytical discussion.\n\nCOURSE GOALS\n\nYou will practice reading published work as a writer.\n\nYou will work with craft elements and literary techniques in fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, and read examples from a variety of authors, perspectives, genres, and forms.\n\nYou will experiment and take risks to create drafts, then cut, hone, and explore possibilities through revision.\n\nYou will actively work to increase your knowledge and skills, aim for professional standards, participate effectively in our writing community through discussion, develop useful feedback, work with revision and deadlines, and locate resources and opportunities both in and out of our classroom.\n\nCRN: 20438 DAY/TIME: MWF 10:00-11:20 am Instructor: Pagh, Nancy\n\nIn this section of Introduction to Creative Writing we will examine and practice the fundamentals of craft: imagery and figurative language; sound; character and setting; voice and perspective; form and structure. We will focus on “close reading” of model poetry and prose; brainstorm creative expression and response; draft poems, stories, and creative nonfiction personal essays; share some of these projects with peers; and revise selected works--learning how to communicate about and make practical use of feedback on drafts. Evaluation will be based on completion of a sequence of activities and full participation in the class.\n\nRequired Textbook: Write Moves: A Creative Writing Guide & Anthology\n\nCRN: 21421 DAY/TIME: MWF 01:00-02:20 pm Instructor: Pagh, Nancy\n\nIn this section of Introduction to Creative Writing we will examine and practice the fundamentals of craft: imagery and figurative language; sound; character and setting; voice and perspective; form and structure.

How do we write what we know when we’re writing a novel about a demonically infested high school, a poem about environmental policy, a memoir that includes our grandmother’s immigration story, a game about fighting alien world conquest, or... anything else, really? Our real lives are filled with tedious waits in grocery store lines, frightening and sudden visits to the ER, long shifts at work, vibrant dreams that make no sense when retold, and anecdotes about our friends that are only funny if you were there.\n\nIn this Introduction to Creative Writing course, you’ll learn the foundations of creating memoir/essays, poems, and short stories. In our observation journals, we’ll make brief daily entries to learn how to draw on real-world details like sensory information, voice, character, and setting in our creative work. Each week, you’ll read and analyze a creative work, learning how to read like a writer. We’ll also write a reading response to a craft essay to situate our classwork within a larger writing community. You will write one story, one poem, and one essay and select one of these pieces to workshop in class. We’ll write feedback letters and revise in class. Through in-class writing, we’ll explore idea generation, tropes, and stylistic conventions. For our final project, I’ll work with you to create an individual work of creative written art that reflects your goals as an aspiring writer.\n\nCRN: 22361 DAY/TIME: TR 02:00-03:50 pm Instructor: Winrock, Cori Anne\n\nThe Observatory\n\n‘The task of the right eye is to peer into the telescope, while the left eye peers into the microscope.’ –Leonora Carrington\n\nThis Introduction to Creative Writing course will be an observatory in which we attempt to understand what it means to be readers and writers in this strange moment in time. You will learn to peer through the microscope to look at the nitty gritty of how pieces in different genres are crafted. And peer through the telescope to look out at the wider skies of yourselves and the world around you in relation to writing. Have we changed as readers and writers during the last three plus pandemic years? Can we imagine a different way of reading and writing the current world? Across the span of the quarter, you will study specimens of craft while witnessing and conversing with your classmates about your findings. You will consider what it means to read actively as writers, with intention toward discovery and curiosity and acceptable bewilderment—to admire the paintbrush hairs left in the painting, the traces of process. You will learn to read as thieves—to borrow and try out and try on different styles and elements. And lastly, to read with an eye toward the playful and what might be enjoyable precisely because it doesn’t make “sense.” You will, of course, also write and write and write—cataloging all this beauty and difficulty and constraint through notebooks + poems + essays + stories + hybrid forms.\n\nENG 351 Intro to Fiction Writing 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 350. Major restrictions lift on Tuesday Mar 5th by 10am.\n\nCRN: 20299 DAY/TIME: TR 12:00-01:50 pm Instructor: Westhoff, Kami Dawn Marie\n\nThis course is designed to introduce you to the craft and culture of writing fiction as well as the complex world of critique and workshop. We will read established authors of various identities and study the ways they make their writing shine through unique use of voice, description, language, dialogue, character development, and experimentation. While reading and studying these authors, you will begin your own journey into short story fiction writing with the help of various writing exercises and assignments, revision, and most importantly, your imagination and individuality.\n\nCRN: 20439 DAY/TIME: MWF 11:30-12:50 pm Instructor: Araki-Kawaguchi, Kiik\n\nAs a community of writers, we will strengthen our competencies through reading, writing, discussing and reflecting. You will be tasked with developing fictional worlds, characters and predicaments. We will have conversations about the fundamental elements of fiction (e.g. tense, pov, dialog, voice, conflict), as we examine a diverse body of published works and the early drafts (stories) written by you and your peers.\n\nExpect this to be an exciting and challenging course. We hope you will develop new ways of thinking, working, writing and communicating. We hope you will take risks. Count on being brave, respectful, and a hard worker.\n\nParticipation in a 5-credit course is equivalent to 150 hours of work over the quarter. This will include 4 hours of classroom time weekly (lecture, discussions, workshop) and approximately 10 hours of outside preparation (reading, writing, investigating, reflecting, projects). You are also encouraged to visit me in office hours, attend literary events, and (safely) connect with your peers.\n\nWe will examine a diverse body of published work across genre boundaries. I attempt to keep course costs as low as possible, but I require access to a few critical materials:\n\n• Wonderbook by Jeff VanderMeer\n\n• An electronic device (e.g. smartphone) that will allow you to access podcasts\n\nCRN: 23640 DAY/TIME: TR 02:00-03:50 pm Instructor: Westhoff, Kami Dawn Marie\n\nThis course is designed to introduce you to the craft and culture of writing fiction as well as the complex world of critique and workshop.

Major restrictions lift on Tuesday Mar 5th by 10am.\n\nCRN: 20074 DAY/TIME: TR 04:00-05:50 pm Instructor: McGuire, Simon Leonard\n\nIn this introductory course we will practice reading poetry and writing poems. Through in-class writing exercises and structured assignments, we will extend our sense of how poems work (on) and move (through) us. Each week we will attend to different elements of poetic creation – including imagery, metaphor, repetition, soundplay, traditional form, and -making and -breaking. Investigating how these elements and structures are woven together in poems we’ll read & write will both create a classwide understanding of poetic possibility and prompt us as poets to weave our own phonotextual tapestries.\n\nProjects in this class require you to blend your reading and analytical skills with your poetic practice. Several assignments ask you to choose, read, analyze and present to the class poems and writing that engage you or are examples of forms or structures we’re studying. We’ll also spend classtime sharing and responding to the pieces of poetic practice you produce each week. As a class sharing work with each other, we’ll seek to listen carefully, be both considerate and critical, and open for each other potential avenues of revision and rewriting.\n\nCRN: 21823 DAY/TIME: TR 10:00-11:50 am Instructor: Winrock, Cori Anne\n\nExquisite Forms\n\nWhat are the forms a poem can take? What are the forms a poem can make? Is a poem a container? Is it contained? What is the velocity of a poem? What might be the motion of its form? In her essay “The Rejection of Closure,” Lyn Hejinian argues: “Writing’s forms are not merely shapes but forces; formal questions are about dynamics—they ask how, where, and why the writing moves, what are the types, directions, number, and velocities of a work’s motion.” This Intro to Poetry class will deep dive into the possible forms of poetry and what it means to consider these forms as forces. Across the course of the quarter, we will ransack the museum of poetics—from ancient forms up to the hyper contemporary moment. We will read widely and weirdly. We will explode sonnets, diagram lines, solve for X, and search for the self. We will consider video poems, create poetry comics, and carry one form over to another as we learn to riff and repeat and reform.\n\nENG 354 Intro to Creative Nonfict Writ 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 350.

We will explore a broad spectrum of content and form, as we strive to translate personal experience, perspective, and research into effective work. Students will submit drafts, provide feedback, and practice discussions in critical exploration of readings. Coursework will include in-class writing exercises, reading responses, writing assignments, and extensive revision. Since this is a five-credit course, the university expects fifteen hours of work per week: five hours in class and ten hours on your own.\n\nMy goals for this class are that you will:\n\n1) read a variety of creative nonfiction, grasp basic concepts about what the term implies, the variety of forms it can take, and the craft elements, reworking, and revision integral to its success.\n\n2) begin thinking about the ethical implications involved when writing about your life and the lives of others.\n\n3) read published nonfiction as models for your own work, and read your colleagues’ writing with empathy, compassion, and insight.\n\n4) participate effectively in our writing community through discussion, developing useful feedback, working with revision and deadlines, and locating resources and opportunities both in and out of our classroom.\n\n5) gain a better understanding of yourself as a writer, learn how to incorporate feedback into your revision process, and be able to critically analyze your own work.\n\nCRN: 20517 DAY/TIME: MWF 10:00-11:20 am Instructor: Westhoff, Kami Dawn Marie\n\nWelcome to English 354.

It was a sound that combined rap and dance music and featured prominently in urban culture.\n\nThe phrase New Jack Cinema was coined by Steven D. Kendall in his book titled New Jack Cinema: Hollywood’s African American Filmmakers. He uses the phrase to connect Riley’s musical sound with a new movement in Hollywood cinema evolving around the same time. Kendall describes this movement as a time, the late 1980s and early 1990s, when a new crop of African American filmmakers served as the “cultural vanguard” for their generation. Kendall asserts they had to be the best at their craft “in order to survive the Hollywood system, as they were not often afforded the same access and opportunities as their white counterparts” (vi). And we indeed witness this cultural shift as more Black filmmakers are given opportunities to direct major Hollywood productions than ever before.\n\nWhile New Jack Cinema gave voice to a marginalized group, it also inadvertently painted that group with a broad brush. Black films during this period prominently featured urban settings, eliding other Black voices in rural and suburban settings. New Jack Cinema would soon become identified not for its varied Black narratives, but for its gangster films.\n\nThe music, movies, and political climate that created New Jack Cinema serves as the impetus for this course. We will study the early films of such directors as John Singleton, Julie Dash, the Hudlin Brothers, and of course, Spike Lee. Some questions we will attempt to answer are as follows:\n\nHow did New Jack Cinema reflect and shape the socio-political climate of the late 1980s and early 1990s?\n\nIn what ways did New Jack Cinema provide a platform for marginalized voices, and how did it confront or perpetuate stereotypes?\n\nHow did the intersection of music, particularly New Jack Swing and rap, influence the thematic and stylistic elements of New Jack Cinema?\n\nWhat were the challenges faced by African American filmmakers during this era, and how did they navigate the Hollywood system?\n\nHow has New Jack Cinema influenced contemporary filmmakers, and what is its lasting legacy in American cinema?\n\nAssignments: Course work will consist of activities, quizzes, and writing assignments.\n\nRequired Textbook: Course readings will be provided on Canvas.\n\nENG 385 Sustainability Literacy II 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: One course from: UEPP 116, SUST 116, ENG 203, ENG 302, or SALI 201; or instruction permission.\n\nCRN: 21454 DAY/TIME: MWF 10:00-11:20 am Instructor: MacIntyre Witt, Jill\n\nSystems Thinking\n\nThis course will take a human-centered approach to understanding complex systems through research, story, and information sharing. By shifting focus from the parts to the whole and from nouns to verbs, this course offers an introduction to the specialized language, habits-of-mind, and methodology of systems thinking to understand human and beyond-human materialities as interdependent and co creative elements that form a complex and unified whole. Systems thinking can be applied to every discipline and context. It engages with different cultural, ecological, technological, and disciplinary perspectives to find problems, reframe stories, and discover leverage points for enacting systems change.\n\nCourse projects include weekly writing assignments that incorporate visual and verbal elements, including experimenting with new media and/or multi modal compositions. For the major project you will be a part of a team that applies a systems thinking approach to writing about sustainability issues in a professional or public context you care about. We will use these models to articulate solutions through written and oral proposals. The course also invites guest visits from social change leaders in our community. This broad spectrum of disciplinary viewpoints will offer unique perspectives on systems thinking as a practice and field of study and work. Together we will identify the properties and engage in the process of writing/building a viable, desirable, and sustainable future.

Focused primarily on the study of how African American writers cast visions of the rhetorical force and power of their writing, students will learn about how Black writers have theorized the exigencies of their work. Essays from writers to be considered include James Baldwin, W.E.B. Du Bois, Ralph Ellison, Jesse Redmon Fauset, bell hooks, Zora Neale Hurston, Alain Locke, Audre Lorde, Toni Morrison, Gloria Naylor, Margaret Walker, and Richard Wright.\n\nENG 406 Topics:Critical/Culturl Theory 5cr\n\n***ENG 406 was cancelled by the English Department on 3/13/2024 after notifying all students registered via Western email.

As a course in literary history, the literature we study will also be situated in the context of the era of decolonization and the rise of the post-colonial nation-state following WWII. We will read the literature of Arab and Jewish people in Israel and Palestine, including Sephardic, Mizrahi, and Ashkenazi Jews. We will also explore non-Arab Muslim views of political Arabism and Zionism, including those of Amazigh, Black African, Fulani (“Black-Arab”), and Persian peoples. Course discussion will include the complex history of regional conflicts after the creation of Israel in the aftermath of the Shoah/Holocaust and the Palestinian Nakba of 1948, the Six-Day War of 1967, the Yom Kipper War of 1973, and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East prior to the Gaza conflict of 2023, especially following 9/11. Significant time will be devoted to the analysis of poetic, literary, and theoretical texts in historical context. Two regional poets will occupy much of our attention, Mahmud Darwish and Yehuda Amichai. We will also read theorists and figures such as Freud, Herzl, Faisal, al-Husri, Rabbath, Nasser, Aflaq, Fanon, Khomeni, Shahak, Chomsky, Finkelstein, Vattimo, Said, Derrida, Shohat, Ngom, Rose, Gaddafi. Students will work in groups, give oral presentations on pre-assigned topics, write in-class, and perform significant independent research. Regular in-class attendance and participation is mandatory. Some documentaries will be viewed outside of class, and there will be some on-line lectures that will require written responses.

We now live in a “post-9/11” world, defined by our obsessions with security, warfare, terrorism, ethnicity, and national identity. Certainly, 9/11 is frequently described as a defining event of the 21st century for the United States, but what about the rest of the world, Western and otherwise?\n\nIn this senior capstone seminar, we’ll examine the literary response to the events of September 11th, 2001 and their aftermath. Throughout, we’ll consider the distinctive identity of a body of twenty-first century writing (often called post-9/11 literature) that is transnational as well as American. Our discussions will be framed by our attention to both our writers’ aesthetic choices and their cultural and political claims. Our class will be different from (and perhaps more difficult than) many others because of the contemporary relevance of the material. Discussions will inevitably involve an attention to contemporary politics, both national and global, and I ask that you engage each other with mutual respect and sensitivity. Some of the topics we’ll consider include: the ability of literary writers to help us understand the consequences of terrorism and war on our imaginations the adequacy of language to represent this kind of world-shifting event; the extent to which representations of the events can be said to have changed as time has elapsed; how texts written by non-western authors present a challenge to the U.S.-centric narratives that have dominated the post-9/11 moment; and how historical events preceding 9/11 connect to and contributed to the event.\n\nCourse Objectives:\n\nIn addition to offering an introduction to critical terrorism studies, the concept of terrorism, and the production of knowledge about political violence, this course interrogates the influence contemporary writers have on the ways we shape our cultural narratives about 9/11, terrorism, warfare, security, ethnicity, religion, politics, globalization, and national identity, and conversely, the way cultural narratives about those things influence contemporary writers.\n\nStudent Learning Objectives (what you’ll get from your work in this class):\n\nAdvanced capacity to compare and contrast texts of different forms or genres, making connections between different literary texts and/or critical theories.\n\nAdvanced ability to analyze contemporary, transnational literature published since September 11, 2001 and to relate its concerns and its modes of expression to historical and cultural contexts.\n\nAdvanced ability to perform and then apply proactive research.\n\nAdvanced ability to write cogent literary criticism.\n\nIncreased autonomy in assessing literary texts and critical theories.\n\nIncreased ability to participate in an ongoing academic conversation.\n\nIncreased self-awareness of personal reading, writing, and methodological practices.\n\nContent Warning: Some of our texts contain reference to sexual and/or racial violence, suicide, and/or various verbal denigrations. I did not assign these texts lightly, nor is it my intent for us to dismiss the problematic things they depict. Rather, it is my goal for us to confront those elements sensitively, thoughtfully, and deeply, as I hope we do when we encounter them in the real world. Literature exists in part to help us bear witness to, process, and cope with human crises, trauma, and atrocities, and in asking us to confront these things, it also actively encourages our empathy with and for others. Please be certain when signing up for this class that you can commit to reading and discussing this material and further, that you can do so in a mature, respectful way.\n\nRequired texts will likely include:\n\nDon DeLillo, Falling Man\n\nLaila Halaby, Once in a Promised Land\n\nMohsin Hamid, Exit West\n\nMohsin Hamid, The Reluctant Fundamentalist\n\nJane Mayer, The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned\n\ninto a War on American Ideals\n\nIan McEwan, Saturday\n\nKamila Shamsie, Burnt Shadows\n\nRequired theoretical/critical readings will be available on Canvas as PDFs.\n\nENG 418 Sr Sem: Literary Time 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: Senior status; ENG 313 or ENG 314; and one course from: ENG 307, ENG 308, ENG 309, ENG 310 or ENG 311.

Time travel, flash back, simultaneity, linear progression. Feminist theorist Elizabeth Grosz has argued that “time remains the central yet forgotten force that motivates and informs the universe, from its most cosmological principles to its most intimate living details.” It is also, necessarily, a central component of literature. Time is literary structure, organizing principle, subject matter, emotional catalyst. From the “timeless” lyric to the immersive novel through whose duration you feel yourself to exist simultaneously in multiple planes, writers and readers play with time. In this senior seminar, time will not be ancillary to other literary or theoretical concerns: we will home in on the representation, manipulation, and creation of time. We will explore widely across genres and media and through the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, engaging with writers and artists like Emily Dickinson, Claudia Rankine, Frank O’Hara, Virginia Woolf, Marcel Proust, Octavia Butler, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Chantal Ackerman, Ed Roberson, and Yoko Ono. We will also research political, cosmological, theological, and literary arguments about the organization and apprehension of time. Throughout the course, students will work through a set of scaffolded writing assignments (including creative experiments, low-stakes writing-to-think activities, peer workshopping, and revision) toward the completion of an original 10-15 page analytical paper.\n\nENG 423 Maj Auth: Hawthorne's Major Works 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 202; plus three from: ENG 307, ENG 308, ENG 309, ENG 310, ENG 311, ENG 313, ENG 314, ENG 317, ENG 318, ENG 319, ENG 320, ENG 321, ENG 331, ENG 333, ENG 334, ENG 335, ENG 336, ENG 338, ENG 339, ENG 341, ENG 342, ENG 343, ENG 347, ENG 364, ENG 371.

He says No! in thunder; but the Devil himself cannot make him say yes. For all men who say yes, lie.” Herman Melville, 1851\n\nCONTENT: This course looks at the completed novels of Nathaniel Hawthorne, cultural icon and major US writer. We will read the texts in the order he wrote them, pay attention to their interactions with the larger culture, ask why Hawthorne often altered historical accounts, and watch him create characters who underread and suffer the consequences. We will consider issues of gender, history, symbology, and identity, among others. Our reading culminates with Hawthorne’s most complex, wonderful novel, The Marble Faun.\n\nASSIGNMENTS: This will be a small class devoted to reading and writing. The reading load, while full of interesting texts, will be heavy. There will be class presentations and a fifteen-page seminar paper, due at the end of the term. As part of the seminar paper process, expect draft days and in-class writing.\n\nEVALUATION: Evaluation will be based on the criteria above.\n\nTEXTS: Fanshawe, The Scarlet Letter, The House of the Seven Gables, The Blithedale Romance, The Marble Faun. We will also probably a look at a few early and later film revisions of the novels and other materials on how we read Hawthorne and why it matters.\n\nENG 423 Maj Auth: H.G. Wells and Ursula K.

Le Guin\n\nThis course provides deep analysis of the writing of two of the “Shakespeares” of Anglophone science fiction (SF): H. G. Wells and Ursula K. Le Guin. In the late-nineteenth century, the British Wells, an eventual socialist who staunchly advocated for free love, was perhaps the most famous contributor to a genre known as “scientific romance”: an early form of science fiction that placed science at the center of its plot, using it to create tension, anxiety, or fear, as well as revealing the darker desires of humanity and frequently attributing those darker desires to evolutionary inheritance. Although Wells himself eschewed the term “scientific romance,” the power of his early SF novels continues to resonate all over the world.\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century, British SF writers established a New Wave in the genre. New Wave SF was more literary and experimental, including a willingness to experiment with postmodernism. It strayed from the traditional focus on “hard” science in favor of the “soft” sciences, and it foregrounded sexual liberation. More women writers also appeared on the scene during the New Wave. Across the pond in the US, Le Guin, the daughter of anthropologists, began her career as an SF legend and literary giant by writing stories that blended British New Wave sentiment with American genre imagery and her own anthropological interests into tales of loss, companionship, isolation, redemption, and love.\n\nWells and Le Guin are two of the most influential SF writers of all time. You will exit this class with a more sophisticated understanding of their respective contributions to literature, including their representations of gender and sexuality; race and ethnicity; class, capitalism, and socialism; utopia/dystopia; war; apocalypse; and scientific experimentation and technology, as well as a firmer grasp of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Anglophone cultural and literary history.\n\nStudent Learning Outcomes (what you’ll get from your work in this class):\n\nAdvanced ability to analyze nineteenth- and twentieth-century literature and to relate literature’s concerns and modes of expression to its historical context as well as our present moment.\n\nAdvanced capacity to compare and contrast texts of different forms or (sub)genres, making connections while noting evolutions in form, style, and content over an author’s oeuvre.\n\nAdvanced capacity to analyze literary genealogy via a comparison of major authors working at different historical moments in the same genre\n\nAdvanced ability to perform and then apply proactive research.\n\nAdvanced ability to write cogent literary criticism.\n\nIncreased autonomy in assessing literary texts and critical arguments.\n\nIncreased ability to participate in an ongoing academic conversation.\n\nIncreased self-awareness of personal reading, writing, and methodological practices.\n\nRequired texts will likely include:\n\nH. G. Wells\n\nThe Island of Doctor Moreau (1896)\n\nThe Time Machine (1895)\n\nThe War of the Worlds (1898)\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin\n\nA Wizard of Earthsea (1968)\n\nThe Dispossessed (1974)\n\nThe Left Hand of Darkness (1969)\n\nRequired visual text: Epix’s War of the Worlds, season 1 (2019, 8 episodes, streaming on Amazon with trial subscription)\n\nAdditional required short texts and secondary readings are available on Canvas as pdfs.\n\nContent Warning: Some of our texts may contain reference to sexual and/or racial violence, suicide, and/or various verbal denigrations. I will not assign these texts lightly, nor is it my intent for us to dismiss the problematic things they depict. Rather, it is my goal for us to confront those elements sensitively, thoughtfully, and deeply, as I hope we do when we encounter them in the real world. These realities are particularly important to consider in relation to the intertwined histories of imperialism, colonialism, slavery, patriarchy, and white supremacy that accompanied the British Empire and literary canon and that continue in our present political moment. Literature exists in part to help us bear witness to, process, and cope with human crises, trauma, and atrocities, and in asking us to confront these things, it also actively encourages our empathy with and for others. Please be certain when signing up for this class that you can commit to reading and discussing this material and further, that you can do so in a mature, respectful way.\n\nENG 424 Major Directors: Jane Campion 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 364 or instructor permission.\n\nCRN: 23642 DAY/TIME: TR 02:00-03:50 pm Instructor: Odabasi, Eren\n\nFilm Viewing DAY/TIME: W, 05:00-07:50 pm\n\nTwo-time Academy Award winner Jane Campion is one of the most significant and influential figures in contemporary world cinema. She became the first woman in history to win the prestigious Golden Palm, the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival, in 1993 with The Piano. Her adaptation of celebrated author Janet Frame’s autobiography An Angel at My Table (1990) was awarded the Grand Jury Prize in the Venice Film Festival, where Campion also won the award for best director in 2021 with The Power of the Dog. She remains the only filmmaker ever to win the Golden Palm awards for both short and feature films. Throughout a career spanning more than 35 years, she has distinguished herself as the most decorated film director to emerge from New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIn this course, we will study Campion’s complete body of work through the lens of auteur theory. We will identify the central themes in all Campion films (such as female subjectivity and autonomy, desire and societal oppression, mental illness, painful family ties etc.), analyze her work in a variety of formats (multi-episodic series and short films in addition to her narrative features), and explore the unusual cinematic techniques that she frequently uses as a part of her visually inventive style. We will watch and discuss all the feature films directed by Campion, survey many scholarly accounts written about Campion’s cinema, and read Campion’s own comments about her films.\n\nThroughout the course units, we will investigate the literary roots of Campion’s films, identify the notable artists with whom she collaborated repeatedly, and discuss her influence on contemporary films from around the world. The requirements for this course include two short film analysis papers and a substantial final essay that comparatively examines two or more works by Jane Campion.\n\nTEXTS\n\nAll books are available as free e-books through WWU Libraries, no purchase is necessary.\n\n“Jane Campion” by Deb Verhoeven, Routledge, 2009.\n\n“Jane Campion: Authorship and Personal Cinema” by Alistair Fox, Indiana University Press, 2011.\n\n“Jane Campion’s The Piano” edited by Harriet Elaine Margolis, Cambridge University Press, 2000.\n\nAdditional readings will be available online on Canvas.\n\nFILMS\n\nFeatures:\n\nTwo Friends, 1986\n\nSweetie, 1989\n\nAn Angel at My Table, 1990\n\nThe Piano, 1993\n\nThe Portrait of a Lady, 1996\n\nHoly Smoke, 1999\n\nIn the Cut, 2003\n\nBright Star, 2009\n\nThe Power of the Dog, 2021\n\nSeries:\n\nTop of the Lake, 2013\n\nTop of the Lake: China Girl, 2017\n\nWe will also see several short films directed by Campion.\n\nENG 441 Language and the Sec Classroom 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 301, ENG 302 or ENG 371; ENG 347; ENG 350, ENG 351, ENG 353 or ENG 354; two from: ENG 307, ENG 308, ENG 309, ENG 310, ENG 311, ENG 317, ENG 318, ENG 319, ENG 320 and ENG 321.

Students will conduct an analysis and assessment of their own writing and publishing aims and engage in exercises and assignments geared towards individual goals. To that end, we will read, respond to, analyze, and try our hand at composing and refining a wide range of essential texts, including cover letters and query letters, synopses, back cover copy, blurbs, bios, book reviews, and interview questions. Additionally, students will exercise and cultivate research, copyediting, and proofreading skills and closely examine how an author may utilize and refine grammar, syntax, and other elements of style to improve their writing and begin to take part in wider literary community and conversations.\n\nCRN: 23124 DAY/TIME: TR 02:00-03:50 pm Instructor: Trueblood, Kathryn R.\n\nCourse Goals: This is a capstone course that offers practical information not only about the business of publishing books but also about literary careers that exist behind the scenes. The course will include a brief history of the book industry in the United States; corporate versus independent publishing; the roles of book reviewers and reps; agents, editors, and publicists. An overview of the literary arts scene in the Northwest will be included with a discussion of internship opportunities in the region. We will have guest speakers who are professionals in the field, so the syllabus will have to bend here and there to accommodate.\n\nIn this class, students will role-play the part of editor, publisher, and writer, learning the protocol and diplomacy of the industry. The course will offer an introduction to useful skills such as copyediting, proofreading, and promotional writing. The assignments for this course are designed to heighten students' awareness that publishing is key to the democratic process i.e., one of the ways ideas are disseminated in an open society. Historically, communities whose access to the public forum was limited have begun their own publishing movements; students will be encouraged to understand the roles of editor and publisher in that context.\n\nAs advanced workshop graduates, students are expected to be conversant with the principles and techniques of good writing and aim for the standards of professional copy. This is a course in professional development, and a high level of fluency in writing is expected.\n\nTexts:\n\nThe Poets & Writers Complete Guide to Being a Writer, edited by Larimer & Gannon\n\nA People's Guide to Publishing by Joe Biel\n\nCopyediting & Proofreading for Dummies by Suzanne Gilad\n\nENG 460 MultiGenre: 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 351, ENG 353 or ENG 354.

Major restrictions lift on Tuesday Mar 5th by 10am.\n\nCRN: 20368 DAY/TIME: MWF 11:30-12:50 pm Instructor: Colen, Elizabeth Jane\n\nIn this generative, workshop-based class we will examine what it means to forgo the standard expectations of genre and venture into the space of attempting to allow content itself to generate form. We will read closely (as closely as possible, given the constraints of a 10-week quarter) many examples of odd forms and delve into them in our own writing through exercises in imitation and by questioning our own content in order to determine what odd forms might be possible for our work. This exploration will culminate in a portfolio (3 pieces) final of fully revised work of 10-15 pages.\n\nENG 461 Interns in Eng: Prof Identity 5cr\n\n***ENG 461 was cancelled by the English Department on 3/4/2024 after notifying all students registered via Western email.

We’ll all learn that stuff together, and it’s easier than you may think. You also do not need to buy any digital technology for this class; we’ve already got what you need.\n\nAlright, here’s the class description:\n\nEverybody seems to have a podcast. Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen have a podcast; Snoop Dogg has a podcast; the lovely middle-school kid down the road from me has a rad podcast. We are stumbling and tripping over so many podcasts!\n\nAnd still, podcasting offers us ways to consider important notions related to digital circulation, the fascinating nature of sound, our own emotional and affective responses to ideas, and, most importantly for this class, the differing ways storytelling practices play a critical role in nearly every aspect of what the field of Technical Communication calls ‘community engagement.’\n\nSo in this class, we are going to get a bit obsessive about story-driven podcasting. I say “story-driven” because so many popular podcasts are interview shows where a host spends an hour talking with guests. Many of those are great, but we won’t deal much with interview shows. And quite a few popular podcasts sound like a group of friends hit the ‘record’ button and just chatted for an hour. In the podcasting industry, those get called, ‘chum-casts,’ and while some of those are pretty delightful, we won’t spend any time with those either.\n\nTogether, we’ll center story-driven podcasting.\n\nWhat that means is that we’ll explore how podcasting can highlight the ways storytelling is baked into all (all!) our communication practices; we’ll wonder about the ways podcasting can challenge the traditional shape of story; we’ll obsess over the ways podcasting blurs the distinction between sound and writing, which allows us to better reflect on the supposed distinction between orality and literacy.\n\nTo help us chase after those fairly lofty goals, together we will:\n\nListen to heaps and heaps of story-driven podcasts\n\nListen to different types of music to help us think about storytelling in terms of melody and countermelody\n\nRead a little in the field of Storytelling Research, which draws on Technical Writing and Sociology\n\nRead a little in the field of Sound Studies\n\nCreate and share soundscapes, mini audio stories, and of course, story-driven podcast episodes.\n\nENG 464 Topics in Film Studies 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 364 or instructor permission.\n\nCRN: 22706 DAY/TIME: TR 10:00-11:50 am Instructor: Odabasi, Eren\n\nFilm Viewing DAY/TIME: T, 04:00-06:50 pm\n\nEven though film festivals have been in existence in one form or another for more than ninety years (with the Venice Film Festival, initiated in 1932, often cited to be the first major one), scholarly work on the festival phenomenon is relatively recent. In the early 1990s, with the extremely rapid proliferation of film festivals around the world, many scholars have started to analyze the various types of festivals, the groups of agents who participate in this circuit, and the impact of festivals on filmmaking, film financing, distribution, and reception.\n\nThis course offers a comprehensive review of major theoretical and methodological approaches employed in the growing field of film festival research. The first unit of the course is devoted to the theoretical frameworks through which film festivals can be understood as subjects of academic work. The second unit considers the social and political aspects of film festivals, looking at the historical contexts under which major festivals were born and analyzing the influence of external factors on their structures, programming, and development. The final unit examines the economic and institutional dimensions of festivals, with a particular focus on their involvement in the funding, sales, and distribution of films. Various questions about the active role festivals play in forming a world cinema canon and cultivating local film cultures are raised throughout.\n\nRequirements\n\nWritten requirements include 2 reading responses (approximately 1000 words each) and a substantial final project, which may take the form of a comprehensive literature review or original research (10-12 pages).\n\nBooks\n\nde Valck, Marijke. “Film Festivals: From European Geopolitics to Global Cinephilia.” Amsterdam University Press, 2007.\n\nWong, Cindy H. “Film Festivals: Culture, People, and Power on the Global Screen.” Rutgers University Press, 2011.\n\nBoth books are available as free e-books through WWU Libraries, no purchase is necessary.\n\nENG 466 Screenwriting 5cr\n\nNotes & Prerequisites: ENG 364 or one from: ENG 350, ENG 351, ENG 353 or ENG 354.

We will focus on the writing of narrative screenplays, both short and feature-length. To guide our efforts, we’ll explore and analyze a range of examples, both as screenplays and final films, ranging from art cinema to indie films to mainstream Hollywood movies. Although our focus will be on linear narrative storytelling, we may also look at examples of screenwriting for other genres and formats, such as television, online video, and interactive storytelling.\n\nYou will often work collaboratively in class on exercises geared toward developing stories, characters, dialogue, and screenplays. Although some time will be set aside for in-class writing, most of our time together will be devoted to inspiring and guiding the projects you’ll be working on outside of class. The term will culminate in substa"
