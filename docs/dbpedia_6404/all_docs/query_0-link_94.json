        "text": "Hey Marcel! @marcelkriegs\n\nThanks for the question and you have reached the German community here in case you want to discuss this in German instead. But English is fine too!\n\nMost cross-border-selling translation apps offer a convenient lang-switcher in the header bar and you can choose to use country flag icons to improve the language switching experience for your customers. Do you also want to allow for currency switching?\n\nThe Geolocation App is a GeoIP redirect app from Shopify and it ties in nicely with these apps to automatically detect the location of the visitor to your shop and switch the language as well as the currency (if you are using Shopify Payments multi-currency feature) accordingly (see some recommended GeoIP Redirect apps here). A lot of translation apps also have this feature built in and they also manage your domain suffixes.\n\nTwo translation apps that use the Shopify API, as far as I know, are Langify and LangShop. Perhaps their demos can give you a good idea how they work:\n\nWeglot - bottom right corner\n\nLangShop\n\nDo you have the Shopify Markets feature activated in your shop? This feature is a one-stop-shop for all your cross-border selling needs and requirements. See more on that here.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nGabe | Social Care @ Shopify\n\n- War meine Antwort hilfreich?

I am also using the translate and adapt app to translate a customers website. However currently the language switchter only provides a text link to switch the languages. @Gabe you mentioned it would be possible to use language flags in the dropdown selector. Unfortunately I cannot find any option or guide on how to implement that. Would you be so kind and let me know where the documentation is or how to do that.\n\nmany thanks in advance.\n\nHey @rocket-dev\n\nA language selector with country flags is definitely a much improved customer experience, you are right there! So there are a few ways to achieve this and I'll go into that here. How are you with a bit of coding?\n\nYou can build a language selector to allow customers to manually choose their preferred language. For accessibility purposes, you should create a custom component for your selector. Native select elements can make navigation difficult for screen readers, and can lead to unexpected behavior for the user.\n\nThe selector needs to be placed inside a localization form. This form can be created using the Liquid formtag and the 'localization' parameter. The selector also needs to contain an input with the attribute name=\"language_code\", whose value will be the selected language.\n\n{% form 'localization' %} form_content {% endform %}\n\nThis code generates a form for customers to select their preferred country so that they're shown the appropriate language and currency. Thelocalizationform can contain one of two selectors:\n\nA country selector\n\nA language selector\n\nThe available languages are accessible through the available_languages attribute of the localizationobject, and the currently selected language is accessible through the language attribute.\n\nThe localization object can be used in a localization form. To learn about how to offer localization options in your theme, refer to Support multiple currencies and languages.\n\nHere a list of the properties and their links to our resources:\n\nNote: You should only output a country selector if there's more than one available language.\n\nThe following example includes a button and a popover containing each language option:\n\n{% if localization.available_languages.size > 1 %} <localization-form> {% form 'localization' %} <div class=\"disclosure\"> <button type=\"button\" class=\"disclosure__button\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"LanguageList\"> {{ localization.language.endonym_name | capitalize }} <svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" role=\"presentation\" class=\"icon icon-caret\" viewBox=\"0 0 10 6\"> <path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M9.354.646a.5.5 0 00-.708 0L5 4.293 1.354.646a.5.5 0 00-.708.708l4 4a.5.5 0 00.708 0l4-4a.5.5 0 000-.708z\" fill=\"currentColor\"> </svg> </button> <ul id=\"LanguageList\" role=\"list\" class=\"disclosure__list\" hidden> {% for language in localization.available_languages %} <li class=\"disclosure__item\" tabindex=\"-1\"> <a href=\"#\"{% if language.iso_code == localization.language.iso_code %} aria-current=\"true\"{% endif %} hreflang=\"{{ language.iso_code }}\" lang=\"{{ language.iso_code }}\" data-value=\"{{ language.iso_code }}\"> {{ language.endonym_name | capitalize }} </a> </li> {% endfor %} </ul> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"language_code\" value=\"{{ localization.language.iso_code }}\"> </div> {% endform %} </localization-form> {% endif %}\n\nFor an example of JavaScript that manages the visibility of the option list and submits the form on selection, refer to JavaScript submission of the localization form.\n\nTo implement a language selector with country flags in the Shopify storefront, you can follow the steps you provided with slight modifications. Here's a step-by-step process:\n\nGather Country Flags:\n\nFirst, you'll need a set of country flag images. You can find various free sources online that offer SVG or PNG flags by country or language code.\n\nMake sure to host these images in a place that can be accessed from your Shopify store, such as within your theme assets.\n\nModify the Liquid Template:\n\nUpdate the existing code you provided to display flags next to the language name.\n\nHere's a modification of the example code above:\n\n{% if localization.available_languages.size > 1 %} <localization-form> {% form 'localization' %} <div class=\"disclosure\"> <button type=\"button\" class=\"disclosure__button\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"LanguageList\"> <img src=\"{{ 'path_to_flags_folder/' | append: localization.language.iso_code | append: '.png' }}\" alt=\"{{ localization.language.endonym_name | capitalize }}\" /> {{ localization.language.endonym_name | capitalize }} <!-- SVG for dropdown icon --> ... </button> <ul id=\"LanguageList\" role=\"list\" class=\"disclosure__list\" hidden> {% for language in localization.available_languages %} <li class=\"disclosure__item\" tabindex=\"-1\"> <a href=\"#\"{% if language.iso_code == localization.language.iso_code %} aria-current=\"true\"{% endif %} hreflang=\"{{ language.iso_code }}\" lang=\"{{ language.iso_code }}\" data-value=\"{{ language.iso_code }}\"> <img src=\"{{ 'path_to_flags_folder/' | append: language.iso_code | append: '.png' }}\" alt=\"{{ language.endonym_name | capitalize }}\" /> {{ language.endonym_name | capitalize }} </a> </li> {% endfor %} </ul> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"language_code\" value=\"{{ localization.language.iso_code }}\"> </div> {% endform %} </localization-form> {% endif %}\n\nReplace path_to_flags_folder/ with the correct path to your flag assets. If you're using SVGs, change .png to .svg.\n\nUpdate the JavaScript:\n\nIf you're using the Shopify provided JavaScript for managing the visibility of the option list and submitting the form on selection, ensure that this script is included and working correctly.\n\nStyle and Accessibility:\n\nEnsure that the flags are visible and appropriately sized.\n\nMake sure to use the alt attribute for the flag images to provide a textual description of the image. This is vital for screen readers and overall accessibility.\n\nTest:\n\nMake sure to test the language selector on various devices and browsers to ensure it works as expected. Testing with a screen reader is also essential to ensure that your website remains accessible to all users.\n\nWith these steps and modifications, you'll be able to add country flags to your Shopify language selector, providing a visual cue for your users.\n\nGabe | Social Care @ Shopify\n\n- War meine Antwort hilfreich?
