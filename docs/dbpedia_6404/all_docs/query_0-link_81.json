        "text": "Poem 26: Cill Aodáin by Antoine Ó Raifteirí\n\nHello everyone-\n\nI’ve just managed to get February’s poem in by the skin of my teeth, posting on the last day of the month – and the poem I’ve chosen is less about analysis and more about the tradition of Irish poets and the history of poetry. We are going to be talking about a poem called Cill Aodáin which was composed by an poet called Antoine Ó Raifteirí (1779 – 1835) a nomadic bard who wandered around the West of Ireland, reciting poetry and playing music. He was one of the last of the Gaelic Irish poets, as by then, the whole traditional infrastructure that supported the poets and the musicians had collapsed, and Ireland was on the brink of catastrophe, with a rapidly increasing population who were barely surviving on poor land, struggling to pay rent, struggling to find food, and very much subject to an uncaring and absent political system.\n\nÓ Raifteirí, like the poets gone before him, did not write anything down- all of the poems were composed, memorized and recited. It is very likely these poems would have disappeared completely, if it was not for the efforts of collectors in the late nineteenth century, who were part of a cultural revival of the Irish language and Gaelic culture. I am always fascinated that it was the elites of Irish Society – well-heeled Protestant families whose descendants would have been originally British – that rescued Irish language and literature and much of the history and mythology from oblivion. To unpack exactly why this happened is complicated, some of it was timing, and a general European interest in antiquity and history, I think it also had to do with the liminality of people coming from the British colonial tradition, but who felt separate and different from the English. Something similar happened with the British who colonised and settled in America too, they also developed a new identity for themselves, but they did not dig into the indigenous culture or languages to do this – arguably, the founding fathers was considered the ‘starting point’ of the culture. I would like to study why this is so, but not today.\n\nHowever, what prompted me to choose this poem was its opening line, which translated very loosely would mean something like ‘Hey, here comes Spring’. To be more forensic, or literal, its opening line goes like this- ‘Anois teacht an Earraigh’, – ‘Now comes Spring’. You can probably find a reading of the poem in Irish online, but if you want to have a bash at pronouncing it, it sounds like this\n\n‘Anois teacht an Earraigh’\n\nAnish chawckt an Arry.\n\nMost Irish persons of a certain age would have learned this poem, in Irish, in school, and back in the day, when you were made to learn something in school, it was repeated until it became embedded in your brain forever. There are many of us who, when in the nursing home, having forgotten the name of our first born child, will still be able to recite prayers, poems and irregular Irish verbs, for they were scalded into us like a branded calf. So, it wasn’t really a surprise when, as I went for my usual Saturday ramble, and came to a little cottage on the side of the road with clusters of beautiful new snowdrops on display, the first words that came into my head were ‘Anois teacht an Earraigh’.\n\nThose of you who know us from this blog, and from the Facebook posts will know that I absolutely adore Spring flowers, and the sight of these little flowers just energised me so much – the snowdrops come first, and then there will be crocuses, daffodils, primroses, and before we know it, the hour goes forward, the days are long and sunny again, and we get to really enjoy our beautiful surroundings.\n\nSo, I came around the corner, saw the snowdrops, thought ‘Anois, teacht an Earraigh’ – and I knew I should bring you to this poem.\n\nI have not printed the whole poem here, and the translation is adapted from Frank O’Connor’s, any errors or liberties taken with the Irish are all mine, but rather than be too faithful to the syntax, I’d rather try to get you to the sense of this poem, which I think is so full of hope and faith. Having had the year we’ve had, I think we need poems like this.\n\nThis poet declares that Spring is coming, and that he is going to go home. Home for him is County Mayo, on the west coast – not too far from where we are in Donegal, and it’s a similarly rural county, absolutely breath-taking in its beauty. Also, like Donegal, Mayo was one of the counties worst affected by the horrors of nineteenth-century poverty and famine, and for poets like Ó Raifteirí, who no longer had patrons, but depended on the largesse of the public, making a living as a wandering poet was almost impossible, especially in his home county of Mayo.\n\nNow, there are various stories surrounding the poet’s intention for writing this poem, including one that suggests he was trying to get back into the good books of a previous patron. But it’s also clear that some of the scholars who rescued Ó Raifteirí’s words were not averse to shaping the work to suit their own agenda, so let’s not get distracted by that. For me, it’s a poem about wanting to go home, back to the bosom of the family, the birthplace, the familiar towns and landmarks, the smells and sounds that we recognise. I think we can find this theme across literature, from Yeats’ Lake Isle of Inisfree to Paulo Nutini’s These Streets. I wanna go home!\n\nAnd, in the poet’s imagination, home is plentiful, it’s warm, it’s hospitable, and it will rejuvenate him. It’s the antithesis of the hostile, unkind world he has to navigate.\n\nThis poem, just like ‘The Lake Isle of Inisfree’, is aspirational. The poet uses either the future tense, or the conditional tense (that famous ‘Modh Coinníollach’ we also got beaten into us at school), so he hasn’t gone anywhere yet. And this is another technique that is common to all of us – constructing pleasure in our mind, fantasising about our return to a place we love. All of us are capable of imagining wherever this might be, but a good poem often does this for us, fast-tracking us to a sensual experience that can keep our fears at bay.\n\nEnglish poet William Wordsworth wrote this passage in Tintern Abbey, which I think explains how restorative an imaginary return to home can be;\n\nThese beauteous forms,\n\nThrough a long absence, have not been to me\n\nAs is a landscape to a blind man’s eye:\n\nBut oft, in lonely rooms, and ‘mid the din\n\nOf towns and cities, I have owed to them,\n\nIn hours of weariness, sensations sweet,\n\nFelt in the blood, and felt along the heart;\n\nAnd passing even into my purer mind\n\nWith tranquil restoration:\n\nI mention this, not just to remind everyone that I think Dorothy Wordsworth was the poet in that family, (ha!) but also because Ó Raifteirí was blind from the age of six, and in both poems, sensation is the key to the escape, not the literal viewing of the landscape, but the feelings that they can inspire.\n\nWhich means, that even in these days of no travel, we can go anywhere we want. All we need is the right poet! When I read this poem, I am, in seconds, transported to beautiful county Mayo, in springtime. If I fancy somewhere warmer or more exotic, I can read Marmalade by Louis de Paor, or Lines Written on a Seat on the Grand Canal, Dublin by Patrick Kavanagh. Also, it’s interesting that my joy in the snowdrop scene immediately triggered the first line of the poem in my head. And that has to be such a compliment to the poet – that not just can poetry bring beauty to us, but beautiful scenes transmit to us in the expression of the writer. Once upon an eighteenth-century roadway, a Gaelic poet thought ‘Anois, teacht an Earraigh’, and we’re still saying it.\n\nThat’s brilliant.\n\nCill Aodáin Antoine Ó Raifteirí\n\nTranslation by Frank O’Connor (with adaptation by Niamh Hamill).\n\nAnd now, Spring! The days grow longer\n\nAfter St. Bridget’s day, I’ll raise my sail\n\nI’ll head off, and nothing will stop me\n\nTill I find myself back in the County Mayo.\n\nI swear that my heart swells\n\nLike the wind and the mist rises,\n\nThinking of Carra and Gallen beneath it,\n\nScahaveela and all the wide plains of Mayo;\n\nCill Aodan’s a town that’s lush and verdant,\n\nBerries and fruits of all sorts\n\nAnd if I were amongst my own kin,\n\nOld age would vanish, I’d be young again.\n\nCill Aodáin le Antoine Ó Raifteirí\n\nAnois teacht an Earraigh\n\nbeidh an lá dúl chun shíneadh,\n\nIs tar eis na féil Bríde\n\nardóigh mé mo sheol.\n\nGo Coillte Mach rachad\n\nní stopfaidh me choíche\n\nGo seasfaidh mé síos\n\ni lár Chondae Mhaigh Eo.”\n\nFágaim le huacht é\n\ngo n-éiríonn mo chroí-se\n\nMar a éiríonn an ghaoth\n\nnó mar a scaipeann an ceo\n\nNuair a smaoiním ar Cheara\n\nnó ar Ghaileang taobh thíos de\n\nAr Sceathach an Mhíle\n\nnó ar phlánaí Mhaigh Eo.\n\nCill Aodáin an baile\n\na bhfásann gach ní ann,\n\nTá sméara is subh craobh ann\n\nis meas de gach sórt,\n\nIs dá mbéinnse i mo sheasamh\n\ni gceartlár mo dhaoine\n\nD’imeodh an aois díom\n\nis bheinn arís óg.\n\nPoem 25: Passage to India by Mamo McDonald\n\nIt is January 6th, 2021, a day celebrated in Ireland as ‘Woman’s Christmas’, or ‘Nollaig na mBan’. In parts of Ireland, Jan 6 was the day that hardworking women of Ireland took the day off from their chores, and gathered together to chat, sew and knit, and eat Christmas cake and pudding – and whatever other goodies were left over from the season. The sentiments of the day have been revived in recent times, as a celebration of women’s solidarity.\n\nSo it is appropriate that our first poet of 2021 is Mamo McDonald. I was delighted to receive her collection of poems, Circling as a Christmas gift. I already knew of Mamo, as she was a very visible public figure for years, former President of the Irish Countrywoman’s Association, and an advocate for older women through her work with OWN, the Older Woman’s Network. I also am familiar with Mamo’s home town, and know some of her adult children through family connections, but I did not know she was a poet until last week. Always delighted with a new volume of poems, especially if the author is an Irish woman, I sat by the fire and absolutely devoured the collection, inspired and delighted by the warm, vital, sensual voice that spoke from the verse.\n\nFor some time, my work has engaged me in a study of the activism of women in the twentieth century. Although the Irish revolutionary period was inspired and aided by many women activists, the subsequent Republic that came about after revolution became a very cold house for women. Successive Irish governments not only failed to deliver on the promises of revolution, they actually removed many of the rights of women that had existed pre-independence. From 1922 until at least the 1980s, (and arguably the 1990s), women’s lives were bound to the kitchen, bedroom and labour ward – or they emigrated. The twentieth century is as dark a place for women as you could imagine, with policies of incarceration for those who did not conform to the required template of the Irish woman- married, mother, housewife and devout.\n\nOn the surface, it appears that the confinement of women to the domestic rendered women neutral and powerless, but some recent excellent research, combined with the testimonies of women like Mamo, have revealed that the burst of activism in the late 70s through to the Repeal movement in 2018 could only have been successful because of the subtle, stealthy activism of women during the dark years. The Irish Housewives Association and the Irish Countrywoman’s Association were two seemingly ‘domestic’ organisations that mobilised, lobbied, found workarounds and chinks in armour to make the changes that were necessary to improve women’s lives, and the lives of their families.\n\nMamo McDonald was a key figure in this revolution. Initially, the Irish Countrywoman’s Association was considered a more conservative, traditional organisation, at odds with some of the more radical feminist organisations. It was Mamo who recognised the commonalities between women’s groups, and forged important links and strategies to pursue shared goals. She describes herself as a born-again feminist, which obviously makes me love her, but more importantly, she and our other grandmothers made this transition by both enduring the traditions that were thrust upon them, and quietly ensuring that the world would be easier for future generations of Irish women.\n\nMamo was born in 1929, and married Eugene McDonald in 1950. As the law demanded, Mamo had to resign from her job at the bank when she married, and she and Eugene went on to have eleven children – yes, eleven kids folks, yikes! Tragically, her husband died suddenly in 1979, leaving her with five children at home and a business to run. She is most definitely an Irish Mammy, and was too soon, a widow in the country town of Clones, Co. Monaghan. So what do we expect from the poems? I was not sure, but from the first poem, I was mesmerized by a voice I can best describe as tender, passionate, sensitive and witty. Primarily, it’s a woman’s voice, very rooted in the domestic and the rural Irish townland, but it is also a confident, worldly voice. She embraces her femininity and sexuality, not through reminiscing, but in the present, as essential as all of the other aspects of her womanhood. I had to very quickly check my own response, which was somewhere between surprise and delight, to read such uninhibited honesty in the poetry of an older woman, but it was simply because I have not read this kind of poem before.\n\nThe poem I’m going to select from this collection is called ‘Passage to India, but before I do, I want to refer to the opening poem, which is called Growing Old Disgracefully, which really sets the tone for the collection. The poet remembers being young, and undressing under her nightdress, ‘and never wore shiny shoes/ in case they reflected my knickers’. In the second verse, the poet tells us she now ‘sashays’ around her bedroom naked, enjoying body lotions and lingerie. In the third verse, she aspires to be like Marilyn, going to bed in only Chanel No 5, ‘and my panic button/just in case’. Isn’t this magnificent, to reverse the usual movement from younger and sexy to being neutralized by age? And to assert, unapologetically, that one’s sensuality can co-exist with whatever the latter years bring?\n\nI loved this, and almost chose it for you, but then I read ‘Passage to India’, and it’s so loaded and lovely and also seasonal, so you’re getting this one today.\n\nThe poem is only two verses long. It is addressed to her husband, Eugene, therefore referring to sometime between the fifties and late seventies. It opens with a reference to the couple’s financial hardship; no surprise for this period in Ireland, when the economy was in a sorry state. However, despite the leanness, husband and wife scrape together the price of an Indian rug, which they purchase from a well-known department store in Dublin. The poet notes that when they pay for the carpet in Dublin, the vendor does not return any ‘luck money’, – ‘They lacked the country way of dealing’.\n\nI like this low-key observation from the poet, because again, there is a reversal of a common idea that the city is the sophisticated or civilized space. There is a Kavanagh-esque rejection of Dublin here, preferring the established, understood ritual of neighbourly trade.\n\nAt this point, I thought, this is going to be about the house-proud wife, who wants a good carpet for Christmas, and assumed that’s where the poem was going to go. Wow. Wrong.\n\nThe second verse fast forwards to post Christmas dinner, when the children are ‘deep in Santy loot’ – the language here is colloquial- Santa, or Father Christmas is called ‘Santy’ in various parts of the country, and loot is treasure or the fruits of a burglary, – but what does strike you as you read this is that despite the fact that ‘times were tough’, the children were not left wanting from either treats or gifts. So it seems that the presents that were taboo were only the presents to each other.\n\nThe revelation of the way in which the Indian carpet becomes pertinent to the poem is wonderful. I love the exoticism and escapism of it, the ability of their love to transform the domestic artifact to a fabulous, transcendent journey. There is also something wonderfully unbridled and impulsive about their timing and location – the kids are in the kitchen, the couple are not in the marital bed, they are not in darkness- for those of us reared in the pulpit-fearing era of twentieth century Ireland, this revelation that our parents might have been ‘at it’ on the carpet in the front room once more turns expectation on its head. The poet’s revelations are important. In the last twenty years, it has personal narratives, honest stories of sexuality and experience that have changed Ireland to a more tolerant and humane country. This touching and intimate poem is a confident expression of a healthy, happy, close relationship, one that could transcend all obstacles. Enjoy!\n\nPoem 24: Advent by Patrick Kavanagh\n\nSometimes I spend time debating which poem to choose each month, and sometimes I know precisely what I want to share with you. For this December, in the year of 2020, I cannot but bring you to Patrick Kavanagh, and this beautiful, profound poem called ‘Advent’.\n\nMovie buffs will be familiar with the film ‘Jaws’, and the assertion that it’s not really about a shark. I’m going to channel this idea and say that although this poem is called ‘Advent’, the period of preparation before Christmas, and it refers specifically to the arrival of Christ, I do not think it is a poem about Christianity. It can be, if you want it to be, but I don’t think it is about a particular belief system, or religion, but a way of living.\n\nTo digress a little, you must remember that Ireland was first written about by Christians. Our earliest literature was penned by monks and abbots, for whom it was essential to express Irish tradition in a Christian framework. Even the old pagan mythology, a sturdy part of the oral tradition, was articulated from Christian perspectives. It was these monks and priests who literally expressed Ireland, in the Irish language, and embedded into it almost indelible Christian ideology. Thankfully, however, they did incorporate much of the folklore and superstition of the pre-Christian world. It seems contradictory, and yet we can still see plenty of evidence of the pagan and the Christian co-existing comfortably in much of the literature of Ireland.\n\nAfter the reformation in England in the 17th Century, a series of laws, named Penal Laws, were prescribed to stamp out Catholicism. Ironically, this caused a more intense devotion to what now was part of the Irish tradition, and also created a significant link between politics and faith, i.e., nationalism and religion. So much so that when the Irish Republic came to be in the early twentieth century, the Irish Constitution was unmistakably Catholic in its construction. This was very problematic on many levels, and therein lies a debate for another day, but I think it is correct to say that for anyone growing up in rural Ireland in the twentieth century, everything you did was under a very stern eye of priest and doctrine. It was a very present and consuming reality, so we should expect to see it in rural Irish poetry.\n\nAnd we do see it in Kavanagh, all the time. However, I am going to suggest to you that Kavanagh’s ideas of faith and redemption, while inevitably dressed in Christian metaphor, are actually much more earthed in the natural world. We see, in his poetry, all the time, an urge to reach spiritual clarity through an immersion in nature. I think this poem will not only illustrate that this is his modus operandi, but I hope you’ll agree with me that it’s a poem that can easily be accessed by anyone, Christian or otherwise.\n\nSo let’s look at the obvious metaphor- Advent is a period of four weeks, before Christmas, when Christians deny themselves certain pleasures. People would give up the drink, the cigarettes, or go to mass daily, or eat very plain food, – it was a familiar ritual, meant to enhance the appreciation of the Christmas celebration. This poem is titled ‘Advent’, and Kavanagh clearly works through this idea that asceticism has benefits. But look how he does it.\n\nThe opening lines are wonderful.\n\nWe have tested and tasted too much, lover- / Through a chink too wide there comes in no wonder.\n\nBy using the word ‘lover’ in the opening line, the poem immediately sheds any pretense of piety. Lovers are intimate. Lovers have sex. He doesn’t say wife, or husband, or friend, or brother, or sister. It’s a very deliberate word, one that was definitely not used by Irish priests back in the day, unless it was with condemnation. Even Adam and Eve, the first lovers, weren’t openly called lovers. There was an apple, and a serpent, and a fall – but does anyone call them ‘lovers’?\n\nThe second line sounds like a proverb, but the ‘chink too wide’ makes me think of the child, peering through the keyhole, or a crack in the door.\n\nSo, Kavanagh has juxtaposed two ideas here- sexuality, and child-like innocence. Which makes me think that what he really seeks here is love- not adult love, which was then, binary, and challenging, and subject to rules and (in an Irish context) very much tinged with guilt and shame, but the love a child has for everything; an unbridled happiness that can see magic in everything.\n\nIn the second section of the poem, (another seven lines- we’ve got a double sonnet going on here), the poet reveals what would be gained in this return to childhood. It’s very much rooted in rural, mucky Monaghan, (which is a county in the province of Ulster – Kavanagh’s home county), with its ‘spirit-shocking’ Ulster hills and ‘prophetic astonishment’ in the ramblings of addled elderly neighbours, and a journey back to the ‘bog holes, cart-tracks, old stables where Time begins’. It’s interesting that he sees the child and the old fool capable of conversations – adults have no time for either.\n\nI love the language in this section. Its run-on lines, breathlessly speaking as a kid would, gasping from joy to wondrous joy among the most banal and mundane of things. Who else, but Kavanagh could attach romance to a bog hole? Well, Seamus Heaney, but remember, he came after!\n\nThis reinforces my theory that Kavanagh is really talking swapping the jaded cynicism of adulthood for the unchained freedom of childhood. You’ll find this theme also in Dylan Thomas’ Fern Hill – ‘And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barns/\n\nAbout the happy yard and singing as the farm was home’. He wants to journey back to his sinless self, before self-consciousness, before self-regard.\n\nIn the third part of the poem, Kavanagh describes the rewards of a return to innocence. All of the images he uses to do this are rural, agricultural, and in other contexts (including his own poems – see ‘Stony Grey Soil’, for example…), they would not necessarily seem like glittering prizes. Not only does he include farmers’ arguments and loitering village boys, but he actually includes barrows of dung. He is literally talking about ordinary shit. He wants to be able to enjoy and embrace being alive.\n\nHe does clarify this in the last few lines. He says he does not want to ‘ask for reason’s payment’ or ‘analyse’ what is around him. This appears to be a rejection of an intellectual or scientific approach to life. Kavanagh was not formally educated, and did not feel comfortable in the literary circles. I think the only neighborhood he knew as well as his agricultural heartland was the learnt-by-heart Catholic philosophy. It served the poet like the beanstalk – it was a complex, difficult climb, but the only alternative to existential despair.\n\nI absolutely adore the line ‘the heart-breaking strangeness in a dreeping hedge’. Observe the long vowel sounds. ‘Dreeping’ is a form of Ulster-Scots, it means wet (dripping). Every time I see a glittering, wintery rain-soaked hedge, or a crooked, pot-holed boreen, I feel a combination of love, nostalgia, a sense of place and time and belonging, and I love that Kavanagh gave me a phrase to understand it- heart-breaking strangeness. It lurks in all sorts of corners; especially in our rural, unkempt, Atlantic-blustered Northwest.\n\nI’ll let you read the last three lines for yourself. I think you can read them anyway you want, faithful or faithless, and still feel that you’ve made a powerful human journey with this poet and been rewarded. Not everyone loves this poem – some critics have described it as awkward, enigmatic, clumsy. But I do love it, because I think it is about love, and about finding the capacity to be in love, not just with each other, but with ourselves, and to be at peace with the world in which we find ourselves. I said at the beginning that I thought his address to a ‘lover’ was particular, and intimate, and unusual, but I think its important that we read this poem as a conversation, and not an introspective Hamlet-like soliloquy. It is worth noting that he believes the journey will not only enrich his life, but also that of his partner, his lover. It is not a selfish journey, but one aspiring to altruism. Won’t we be rich, my love and I.\n\nFor Kavanagh, there is healing and wisdom and love at the end of a journey that may appear daunting and punishing at the outset. It struck me that 2020 is the year that most of us have been forced into circumstances we would never have chosen, and that have challenged us utterly. We all look forward to January, and a better year ahead.\n\nWishing you peace and love for 2021.\n\nAdvent by Patrick Kavanagh\n\nWe have tested and tasted too much, lover-\n\nThrough a chink too wide there comes in no wonder.\n\nBut here in the Advent-darkened room\n\nWhere the dry black bread and the sugarless tea\n\nOf penance will charm back the luxury\n\nOf a child’s soul, we’ll return to Doom\n\nThe knowledge we stole but could not use.\n\nAnd the newness that was in every stale thing\n\nWhen we looked at it as children: the spirit-shocking\n\nWonder in a black slanting Ulster hill\n\nOr the prophetic astonishment in the tedious talking\n\nOf an old fool will awake for us and bring\n\nYou and me to the yard gate to watch the whins\n\nAnd the bog-holes, cart-tracks, old stables where Time begins.\n\nO after Christmas we’ll have no need to go searching\n\nFor the difference that sets an old phrase burning-\n\nWe’ll hear it in the whispered argument of a churning\n\nOr in the streets where the village boys are lurching.\n\nAnd we’ll hear it among decent men too\n\nWho barrow dung in gardens under trees,\n\nWherever life pours ordinary plenty.\n\nWon’t we be rich, my love and I, and please\n\nGod we shall not ask for reason’s payment,\n\nThe why of heart-breaking strangeness in dreeping hedges\n\nNor analyse God’s breath in common statement.\n\nWe have thrown into the dust-bin the clay-minted wages\n\nOf pleasure, knowledge and the conscious hour-\n\nAnd Christ comes with a January flower.\n\nPoem 23: Take Care by Michael D. Higgins\n\nThis month’s poem was written in 1993, but it seems extremely relevant in 2020, especially as we consider the many challenges we have had this year. You might be surprised by the poet; his name is Michael D. Higgins, and his current job is President of Ireland! He is very much loved by (almost all) Irish people, who elected him for his first seven-year term in 2011, and relected him in 2018. He is affectionately known as ‘Michael D.’\n\nHe was born in 1941 in Limerick city and was raised in County Clare. He was a factory worker and a clerk before becoming the first in his family to access higher education. He became a lecturer in political science and sociology, and then as a public representative, 9 years in the Senate and 25 in Dáil Éireann (the Irish House of Representatives). He also used to write in an Irish music magazine called ‘Hot Press’ in the 1980s- this was the Irish equivalent of ‘Rolling Stone’ magazine, and I used to read his columns back then. During his electoral campaign in 2011, he came to the Seasessions festival in Bundoran, and promised to return to the festival as President- and he did! He is that cool.\n\nHe was Ireland’s first Minister for the Arts, and his achievements included the reinvigoration of the Irish film industry, and the establishment of TG4, (Irish Language TV channel). He’s a human rights campaigner, and was the first recipient of the Seán MacBride Peace Prize in recognition of his work for peace and justice in many parts of the world. And he’s a poet, and published four collections of poetry — The Betrayal; The Season of Fire; An Arid Season ; and New and Selected Poems.\n\nThis poem really does not need a lot of unpacking; but I do love the analogy with nature, and the poet’s assertion that ‘the tree is your teacher’; so we see how trees bend and flex with the wind, but deep roots ‘more firm from experience’ keep them rooted. I think this is a really reassuring idea, offering us respite from the exhaustion of constantly fighting the good fight. It’s ok to take some time out, and the energy will come again.\n\nThe poet also suggests that thinking in terms of the ‘I’ alienates us from happiness. Anger and rage weaken us.\n\nI also love that the poem ends with two words, ‘home’ and ‘together’. For most of us, home is wherever we go for sanctuary, peace and friendship. It’s where our kin are, and it’s where we feel loved. I don’t think it necessarily is a physical place, or a domestic space, I think ‘home’ is a state of mind for many- for me, it is Donegal, always, for you, you’ll have your own space. We must recognize that not everyone has made it home yet, but the poem suggests we will make it, and perhaps we can reach out and bring others with us.

It being October, and finding myself out in the mountains and the hills a lot, I think I have to go back to Yeats today, and offer you what I consider to be one of his finest poems, ‘The Wild Swans at Coole’.\n\nA good friend was in Hazlewood, in Sligo last week, a favourite haunt of Yeats, and she send me some wonderful photographs of the swans there. We are very lucky, in this part of the country, so dotted with coastal inlets and lakelands, to see these beautiful creatures everywhere we go.\n\nEvery child in Ireland learns the story of ‘The Children of Lir’ at school – the poignant tale of four children, Fionnuala, Aodh, Fiachra and Conn, who were turned from humans to swans by a jealous stepmother, and condemned them to nine hundred years on the inhospitable seas and lakes of Ireland. Aoife, the stepmother, allowed them to retain their human voices, and so they would sing beautifully to their father as he sat on the lake shores. Aoife, was punished by being changed into a demon, so she got her comeuppance! The story ends with the eventual return to human form of four very old swans, who are baptised before death. It is a myth that operates within the transition of Ireland from pagan to Christian systems, marrying the magic and ritual of the old Gods with the transformative power of the new.\n\nI recall being in the lakelands area of Florida onetime, and commenting on the beauty of the swans nearby. My companion snorted derisively, and described them as ‘hissy, nasty birds’. I was surprised and wondered if having this story told to us from kindergarten predisposed us to thinking about the swans as symbols of innocence, faithfulness, and endurance. If so, it is interesting to think about how mythology operates within culture. There is a political aspect to consider as well – since the 15th Century, swans were considered property of the British Crown, and were carefully marked and tracked, to prevent anyone but the rich from eating them. Yes indeed, swans often furnished as ambitious centrepieces on the dinner tables of royalty, but there were severe penalties if ordinary folk were caught poaching them. When, in Victorian times, a more delicate sensibility prevailed regarding the butchering of these graceful creatures, the wealthy stopped eating them. Now, in both Ireland and England, swans are protected birds, and while it is technically legal to eat one, it does not happen.\n\nYeats was influenced by Irish and Greek mythology, and swans are present in both. To him, they do symbolise beauty, immortality, and endurance. In this poem, he uses the presence of the swans on the lake at Coole as markers of Time. They are constant, patient, faithful and beautiful, and they remind him of a changed world since he first saw them as a young, frisky poet, and as he now regards them, nineteen years later.\n\nI just love the opening lines of this poem.\n\n‘The trees are in their Autumn beauty/ the woodland paths are dry’\n\nIt is so very simple, and yet we are immediately transported into those gorgeous crisp October evenings, when the leaves crunch underfoot, and the fall foliage is in at its most glamorous. There is a delicious musicality to the combination of the vowels of ‘Autumn’ and ‘Beauty’. We are told it is evening time, and the water is a mirror to a ‘still sky’. And at the end of the first verse, we meet ‘nine-and-fifty swans.\n\nThere is something very measured about Yeats’ count of the swans- it also sounds archaic, as if harking back to medieval times. It does lend a sense of timelessness to the creatures, as if they belong to an old, magical world. The scene itself is truly lovely, the stillness of the evening, the reflected sky in the water, and the presence of these ethereal creatures. It is an opening for Yeats, a prompt to reflections of his own.\n\nHe explains that it is nineteen years since he first saw the swans in this same place (Coole was the home of his friend and collaborator Lady Augusta Gregory, and often a refuge for this peripatetic poet.) A lot has changed for Yeats during the nineteen years, but he summarizes his problems quite efficiently- ‘now my heart is sore’. As you will know, if you have even the whisperiest association with Yeats, his unrequited love of Maud Gonne is a constant theme in his personal poetry, and here it is again- his failed attempts to be loved by her. I do, again, love the simplicity in the language here. Many’s the poet has fallen over his sentences to forensically document his or her broken heart; Yeats strikes to the core here in five monosyllabic words. Even the word ‘sore’ is exactly right – it’s got the long vowel sound to fit in with the echoes of the ‘bell beat’ of the swan wings, it suggests, not a dramatic crisis, but a chronic, enduring unhappiness that, while it won’t kill him, is with him constantly.\n\nThe older, world-wise Yeats is sad, as he sees the swans move on the water. He envies their enduring beauty, their fidelity to their partner, their ageless freedom to ‘wander where they will’. He seems very conscious of his mortality, his insignificance even. They are full of energy, movement, clamour, they are brilliant, they are lovers, they are ‘mysterious, beautiful’. He is a mere observer, marked by disappointment, stasis, and envy.\n\nIt is easy to dismiss whiny old William, who would go on to have many more affairs with younger women, an apparently accommodating marriage with a young wife, a Steinach operation (believed to rejuvenate male sexual potency) at the age of 69, as a foolish man with, as we would say here in Ireland, ‘notions’, but it his dexterity with language, the simple art of the perfect word in exactly the right place, that makes him a pleasure to read. In one of his poems, ‘Adam’s Curse’, Yeats says of poetry-\n\nA line will take us hours maybe/Yet if it does not seem a moment’s thought, /Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.\n\nAnd it is the ability of these words to transport us beyond Yeats’ own condition and into our own realm of nostalgia, regret, insecurity, admiration.\n\nHe has to be good, to take us into our own moment. We have the dubious privilege of knowing about Yeats’ complicated private life, but we can piggy-back on his self-pity to indulge our own moments of melancholy, with this beautiful verse. A little self-indulgent perhaps, but heartsore people need it every now and again!\n\nEnjoy the poem.\n\nThe Wild Swans at Coole W.B. Yeats\n\nThe trees are in their autumn beauty,\n\nThe woodland paths are dry,\n\nUnder the October twilight the water\n\nMirrors a still sky;\n\nUpon the brimming water among the stones\n\nAre nine-and-fifty swans.\n\nThe nineteenth autumn has come upon me\n\nSince I first made my count;\n\nI saw, before I had well finished,\n\nAll suddenly mount\n\nAnd scatter wheeling in great broken rings\n\nUpon their clamorous wings.\n\nI have looked upon those brilliant creatures,\n\nAnd now my heart is sore.\n\nAll’s changed since I, hearing at twilight,\n\nThe first time on this shore,\n\nThe bell-beat of their wings above my head,\n\nTrod with a lighter tread.\n\nUnwearied still, lover by lover,\n\nThey paddle in the cold\n\nCompanionable streams or climb the air;\n\nTheir hearts have not grown old;\n\nPassion or conquest, wander where they will,\n\nAttend upon them still.\n\nBut now they drift on the still water,\n\nMysterious, beautiful;\n\nAmong what rushes will they build,\n\nBy what lake’s edge or pool\n\nDelight men’s eyes when I awake some day\n\nTo find they have flown away?\n\nPoem 21: Dublin by Louis MacNeice\n\nWelcome back to the poetry blog. Today, I am going to discuss Louis MacNeice’s ‘Dublin’ with you. I found this poem a long time ago, and immediately loved it, as I imagine, would anyone who knows Dublin City. But the poem is also a synopsis of a very ‘Irish’ condition, and, indeed, of MacNeice himself, and that is an identity that is not stable. We’ve often seen movies or TV where it’s been said that the real ‘star’ of the show is the city – be it New York, London, Paris, and it’s interesting to think about how a city can be a metaphor for the lives within it (or without it). Almost all cities have a tension between their wealthy shiny surfaces and a seedy underbelly that’s lurking just below the surface. From Athens to Gotham and everything in between, the city absorbs and exudes the history and culture of its inhabitants, it wears the scars of its battles, and the ostentatiousness of its victories as its architecture, it has an underworld, a charade for the tourist, it belongs to some and repels others.\n\nDublin City has a complex history, well represented in literature. James Joyce probably created the definitive Dublin novel in ‘Ulysses’ but James Plunkett’s ‘Strumpet City’ is also a magnificent novel, and in twentieth century literature, Roddy Doyle delivers the suburbs with the same nuances of comedy and tragedy as his eminent predecessors. I’m not confident about the voices of women in the city, at least as far is the novel is concerned, but poet Paula Meehan has brought forth these voices in her poetry, and I will return to her, for comparison, in the next poem. It is unfortunate, to say the least, that the women in Irish literature that we know, are characters, framed and presented to us by our male writers, but it could not be otherwise, as twentieth century culture, politics and economics tethered women firmly to the kitchen sink, or waved them off on the emigrant boats. I would speculate that what is often pejoratively described as ‘chick lit’, and hence, dismissed, has multitudes of authentic stories of the modern Dublin woman, (I’m thinking of authors like Marian Keyes), because it has been really difficult for people to accept domestic themes as anything other than lightweight; while knowing well, that domestic was really the only permitted realm of the Irish woman for most of the twentieth century.\n\nLet’s return to MacNeice, and why this poem is a valuable history lesson about Irish identity. MacNeice himself was born in Belfast, to Protestant parents, and grew up in the very Unionist town of Carrickfergus. By all accounts, his father was bothered by the acute polemics of Northern Irish politics, but MacNeice was sent to school in England, and is usually associated with a very British clique of poets, including W.H. Auden and Cecil Day-Lewis. You may remember my previous blog on Seamus Heaney’s traditions, when I spoke about Shakespeare, Henry V, and the character of MacMorris, Shakespeare’s only Irish character, and I wrote about the liminal Irish identity – MacNeice is this, as was Oscar Wilde, William Allingham, and a host of other Irishmen who went to England, and were at odds with themselves. There is a text written by Gerald of Wales about the Norman Conquest of Ireland in the twelfth century, that records the sentiments of one Maurice Fitzgerald, who says\n\n“For as we be odious and hatefull to the Irishmen, even so we now are reputed, for Irishmen are become hatefull to our owne nation and countrie, and so we are odious both to one and the other”\n\nAnxiety about ethnic and cultural identity is a theme that runs through Irish literature from the beginning of conquest, and you’ll find it in everywhere in the ruminations of Irish men in England. So it’s no surprise to find it in MacNeice’s oeuvre.\n\nWhat’s interesting here is that he parallels this insecurity with the unstable, schizophrenic identity of Dublin itself.\n\nA short history of Dublin; we think of it now as Ireland’s capital city, major population center, and the usual entry point of millions of visitors, the hub of our industry and trade, the locus of our President, our government, and arguably the most ‘known’ place in Ireland. However, in Gaelic times, the major centres of population and assembly were not in Dublin – there were monastic cities in the midlands that had far more influence and sway, and before that, we have evidence of pre-Christian settlements in the provinces. Dublin Town came into being when the Vikings sailed up the river Liffey, and established a settlement, and a couple of centuries later, they were followed by the Normans. The Dublin area evolved as a landing point for invaders, a center of administration, and a territory constantly under threat from the powerful Irish tribes that ruled the rest of the island – the Dublin hinterland became known as ‘The Pale’, and beyond the Pale was a dangerous place, hence the expression.\n\nIn the early 1600s, Elizabeth 1 and her successor, James VI had defeated the Gaelic lordships, and the project of colonizing Ireland proceeded at full force. The British Ascendancy became well established in Dublin, seat of Parliament, and in the eighteenth century, Dublin was the second largest city in the British Empire. Modern restructuring of the streets and the construction of Georgian buildings resulted in a wealthy, beautiful and impressive city in the eighteenth century, but the Act of Union, and the impact of the Great Famine reduced nineteenth century Dublin to a townscape of slums and incredible poverty. This poverty endured through into the early twentieth century, and it was not until the 1960s that a comprehensive program of addressing the problem of tenement buildings began. Now, of course, Dublin is a modern and wealthy European City, and much of its grandeur has been restored, to the delight of the modern visitor, but even among the Irish, there is still a ‘difference’ between Dublin City, and all of the other regions in Ireland.\n\nMacNeice, who was not around to witness Dublin’s rebirth during the Celtic Tiger, saw the city in terms of the contradictory elements of its history. He opens the poem with the images of the architecture, and the statues around the city center of Daniel O’Connell, Henry Grattan and Thomas Moore. The city’s focal point was, and still is, the river Liffey, around which the city was built. The Guinness Brewery is built on the quays, and MacNeice notes the tug boats and the swans on the river. I love his description of the iconic Georgian doors, which have a semi-circular window above them. He describes the ‘bare bones of a fanlight/ over a hungry door’, and ‘Nelson on his pillar/Watching his world collapse/.\n\nIn this section, Dublin is a haunted city. The ghosts of O’Connell, Grattan and Moore, all men who aspired to a future for Ireland, are frozen upon pedestals. The once-grand doorways of Georgian Dublin became chthonic passages to squalor and poverty, and lamenting the death of the grandeur of the Empire is Horatio Nelson, whose statue rested in a tall pillar which dominated Dublin’s Main Street until 1966. (Nelson’s Pillar was blown up by the IRA, and never replaced.) There is no energy or colour in this first section, with the exception perhaps of the description of the creamy pint of porter; is alcohol the only salvation available in the town? MacNeice would not be the first or last writer to see the city through the blurry lens of booze…\n\nIn the second section, MacNeice speaks of his own relationship with the city. Neither born, bred or schooled in Dublin, it seems he has no reason to feel connected, ‘but yet she holds my mind’. He has personified the city, made her female, and he suggests an inexplicable seduction. Ah yes, following in the footsteps of many before him, he has to think of the complex in terms of the female, and it is all about deception; veils, facades, bravado – he appears to be suggesting that there is a swindle at play, lipstick and paint hiding something more sinister. I’m going to pause here to make an observation; the extent to which Irish and British writers employed women as metaphors for the mysterious, subversive, treacherous and unreliable, serves to demonstrate the damage done by the ‘separate sphere’ philosophy of post-Enlightenment Britain and Ireland. The imagery works, because it’s a trope we recognize, but we should also recognize this ubiquitous image as problematic, and its employment responsible for the transmission of inequality.\n\nThankfully, he moves on from the femme fatale idea to a literal reflection; the lights of the city riverdance, and the sunlight and the mist and the breath of the river become indistinguishable, as, he thinks, are the various types of Irish to each other – peasants and landlords, Irish and Anglo-Irish, the killer and the victim. This is interesting, and more original, although I hear whispers of Oscar Wilde here, ‘each man kills the thing he loves’ (from The Ballad of Reading Gaol) perhaps? I think what he’s exploring here is how large resentment and alienation can loom, when the space that divides is only marginal; – the juxtaposition of the killer and victim, and moment following moment pairs a deeply unnatural image with a natural, tying in with the tugboats and the swans of the first section. I also think of MacMorris’ outburst in Act 3 Scene II of Henry V, who exposes that love/hate of identity.\n\nIn the final two sections, he explores these contradictions of identity. Dublin herself is neither Irish nor English, she is MacMorris’ bastard and villain, full of painful histories, including the immolation of justice itself- and yet, he recognizes that there is a dark magic about Dublin, refusing conquest, and instead, ‘appropriating all the alien brought’. Perhaps this is where MacNeice wins me over; I have met so many people who have come to Ireland, and despite not being born, bred or schooled here, they find something compelling in the history and the landscape. The many invaders, over centuries, did not ever stamp an identity on Ireland, Ireland stamped her identity on them. If this is a sentimental conclusion by MacNeice, I’m on board with him!\n\nIt’s your turn now, to read it and see how you respond.

Today’s poem comes from Vona Groarke, one of Ireland’s best contemporary poets, and one who has quite a few readings and interviews in the online universe, I recommend a listen, she is a really interesting and engaging person, with a way of tethering all sorts of abstract ideas to a sturdier framework of understanding. She has a self-assuredness about writing that I think is a characteristic of Irish women poets in the twenty-first century – women who have received accolades for writing, have taught in Universities, have settled comfortably into a hard-won space, and these women writers repeatedly demonstrate how valuable and important a contribution they have made to Irish writing. We talked before about the work women had to do to legitimize domestic issues as valid subjects for poetry – I am very interested in the obstacles that were created for Irish poets by British influences- not just the obvious colonization stuff, but the shaping of a literary landscape that was alien to its own inhabitants. Looking back on the last seventy years or so, I think there has been a process of deconstruction and rebuilding of this landscape, not necessarily adding to it or taking from it, but rearranging it so that we fit into it.\n\nThis poem, which is titled ‘Going Out’, is addressed to the poet’s daughter, and while it can be read as an intimate and loving acclamation, I think it maps out this idea of evolving in positive ways through generations, through time, and through experience. I think the poem captures the mood of a generation of women born in Ireland fifty, sixty, seventy years ago, who are simply in awe of the young women of today, and all they have achieved, and it does so in the most generous spirit, joyously revelling in the prospect of excitement and fun. There is no sense of envy, or self-pity, which is probably the embodiment of true parenting; I do think that any new parent will tell you that one of the most shocking aspects of guardianship is the degree of selflessness that arrives with the wee pink bundle. I also think that any parent will tell you that the selflessness can be severely tested in the teenage years, when it is time for us to release our child into the adult realm. This may explain why many of the poems about motherhood or fatherhood will focus on the new-born, toddler or the wide-eyed eight-year old ingénue. I am not sure I know too many paeans to the truculent teenager who ‘didn’t ask to be born’ J\n\nHowever, Groarke celebrates everything about her daughter’s night out. It struck me that the opening line of the poem uses language that was once flung at women in a derogatory way – ‘out on the town’ and ‘glad rags’ often came at me with wagged fingers and warnings of ruin: but here, the opacity of the first line is suddenly given sound and vision in the second line – the word ‘laugh’ is repeated so we get two laughs, and an image of the floribunda rose in the girl’s hair. This line of poetry is packed with energy (this is a typical feature of Groarke’s poetry, she makes words work hard, and still makes the line look easy). In terms of sound, we have the two laughs and the sheer deliciousness of the expression ‘florabunda rose’ rolling off the tongue. In terms of image, is there anything more beautifying than a young girl laughing? We are tricked- or I was anyway, into imagining the girl with a rose in her hair – but the poet actually uses the word ‘like’ – ha, so we have to think about why she chose this particular simile, it’s an odd one. I looked it up, – here’s a definition from the internet –\n\nFloribunda roses were originally produced by crossing Hybrid Teas with Polyantha Roses. They are prized for creating a mass of colour by bearing many flowers held in large clusters – in fact, few plants can produce so much colour over such a long season.\n\nWow! This opens up many more suggestions – a laugh that has been created by ‘cross pollination’ that arrives in clusters celebrated for its viability –what an amazing bundle of gorgeousness delivered in this image.\n\nThe poet continues to celebrate her daughter’s beauty, – note, she says ‘in her’, the beauty is organic and innate, elemental rather than cosmetic, and to drive home this point, not even the sights or sounds of the summer evening can compete. And there are lots of sounds- heels on the road, phone voices and pooled high talk – I love this, it’s the dramatic, gossipy clamour of a crowd of effusive young people, ( and sorry for always nipping back to Kavanagh, but is this not the ‘ half-code talk of mysteries, the wink-and-elbow language of delight?)\n\nAnd where are these friends going? The poet does not say they are all females, but I cannot help thinking that they are, maybe because I want them to be – and because I love to think that ‘the city’s open door’ is for women, – and it’s easy and safe and welcoming for them.\n\nIt’s all good so far, but the second verse introduces a new idea. ‘Do me a favour, daughter’, the poet asks. And her request is that at some time, she will dress in her mother’s ‘glad rags’ – these sound a little old-fashioned – the sweetheart neckline, the slingback shoes – and proceed on her life’s adventures. This reminded me of two poems – Yeats, in ‘Sailing to Byzantium’, begging to be reimagined as a golden bird, and Kavanagh’s ‘Canal Bank Walk when he asks to be enraptured and encaptured by the unworn world of nature. In both these poems – and I am referencing them because they are the granddaddies of Irish poetry, and are in the ether no matter whether you like them or not- but they both used the idea of escaping to some kind of immortality through recostuming. I’m not sure what Groarke is asking – is she asking her daughter not to forget her, or is she asking to vicariously enjoy her daughter’s future, or is it a bit of both? Would you agree the clothes the poet refers to are her own?\n\nThe poet creates a symphony of not just sound but vision again- her ‘music’ reaches all the sense, – the raucous merry cackling of starlings, the conjunction with the sun of a new moon, ‘traffic lights and weirs’. These images, in addition to the references of ‘door’ and ‘doorway’ earlier in the poem, also suggest (to me) the removal of obstructions that were there for the mother, but will not be, for the daughter, because, as the final line suggests, the daughter will rearrange these familiar things for herself.\n\nI think this poem expresses real pleasure in having reared a self-confident child, in a place that she will navigate in a much more unafraid way. I also read it, as I mentioned above, as an address to the next generation of Irish women – maybe writers, maybe activists, maybe just women in general, to go and do their thing, but to take with them something of their predecessors.\n\nI love the complete embrace of admiration and love in this poem – I have a daughter, who has often dressed up my old clothes with her own style, I constantly am in awe of her power and resourcefulness, her luminousness and her confidence, and I must admit that occasionally I see her and think that all of the good in me, and her grandmothers, and the generations before has been distilled and liberated in her, and for her. That’s my take- see what you think! Enjoy!\n\nGoing Out by Vona Groarke\n\nGoing Out\n\nfor Eve\n\nMy daughter, heading out on the town in her glad rags,\n\nlaughs a laugh like a floribunda rose pinned in her hair.\n\nShe has so much beauty in her, more than this summer\n\nevening, in all its frippery.

Today, I want to tackle the subject of commemoration of historical figures and events. Ireland is currently moving through a period of centenary commemorations- our evolution to political Independence (technically) began with the 1916 Rising, followed by the War of Independence (1919-1921), and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921. As is common to most conflicts, there is no single narrative that can comfortably and calmly embrace the memories, sensitivities, and legacies of what happened, and this can make commemoration complicated and divisive.\n\nMost recently and dramatically, we have seen a type of reversal of commemoration – statues torn down, flags and emblems removed, buildings un-named. This suggests a fluidity of history that, while controversial, implies that the honour or reputation of significant persons of the past depends on their presence in the minds of those here now. The fragment above is by a nine-year old James Joyce, and it refers to Charles Stuart Parnell, a celebrated Irish politician, whose memorial sculpture was begun in 1890. Joyce’s take on Parnell’s immunity to the ‘rude din’ of public opinion seems gravely misjudged – the pedestals on which we hoist our heroes or heroines are neither timeless nor immovable.\n\nCivic duty is in the eye of the beholder.\n\nThis brings me to the poem ‘Kilmainham Gaol, Dublin 1991’ by Theo Dorgan. Kilmainham Gaol (pronounced ‘Jail’) opened in 1796 and closed in 1924. It is now synonymous with the struggle for Irish Independence. Almost anyone who was engaged in militant or constitutional nationalism spent some time in Kilmainham, (including Joyce’s buddy, Parnell). Its deleterious impact was brought to its apogee in May 1916, when, following the Easter 1916 Rising, 14 men were executed by firing squad in the Gaol courtyard, including all seven signatories of the Irish Proclamation of Independence.\n\n1991 was the 75th anniversary of the 1916 Rising, but it was also a fraught period in Anglo-Irish relations. The Irish government, fearful of political sensitivities, abdicated any responsibility for an official commemoration. It fell to independent committees and organisations to arrange events, and one such event, ‘The Flaming Door’, (yes, from a Yeats poem, of course), was curated by a group of artists, poets and musicians, including Theo Dorgan. They hired out Kilmainham Gaol and held a concert in the very venue in which so many Irish men and women were incarcerated, and in which the founding fathers of the Irish state were executed.\n\nDorgan’s poem begins with the construction of the set – the preparation for illusion, for spectacle. His description of roadies, beers and sound-checks creates a festival feel to the event- this is the circus, this is performance, smoke and mirrors, sound and vision. Excitement is added to by the gathering crowd, ‘the hum of expectation’, although the reference to the narrow gate below the gallows hook suggests that the people filing in and ‘becoming an audience’ are passing into an underworld, one that can accommodate the living and the dead. There is a palpable sense of pre-performance adrenaline, anticipation, anxiety – and a suggestion of eroticism as ‘before the lights go down, we examine each other, shyly’.\n\nI love this introduction, because it captures the spirit of theatricality, and the tension between failure and success that always exists in any performance. ‘Break a leg’, say actors, a traditional shibboleth that recognises superstition as an ingredient of performance; rehearsal, ambition, talent, and skill will dissolve in the darkness, and luck becomes the defining factor. Dorgan also recognizes that the gathering of individuals will merge into oneness in the darkness, ‘an audience’ that will share the experience and offer a collective response. Any collective of people is a daunting prospect for the performer; you win the room, or you lose the room. It is all up for grabs.\n\nI want to pause here, just to draw the comparison between Dorgan’s construction of the audience, and the volatility of the commemoration process. Joyce, above, calls Parnell’s contemporaries a ‘rude din’. I also thought of Yeats’ address to the audience who rioted at the performance of Synge’s Playboy of the Western World at the Abbey Theatre – ‘you have disgraced yourselves again.’ Both Yeats and Joyce see the audience as a congregation, with one collective response, one in which the individual may disappear. Can an audience be trusted? Can audience approval or opprobrium be meaningful, or is it simply subject to the vagaries of taste, timing, and tone? The reluctance of the Irish Government to arrange a formal commemoration for the 75th anniversary of 1916 was because they feared that events might be hijacked for propaganda purposes by various organisations, and so they chose not to arrange anything. They, like Yeats, had no faith in a collective Irish audience, and that says something about the government at the time – Haughey led, of course, so no shocks there.\n\nDorgan has created a suspenseful opening, and now the performance begins. The stage is decorated with two flags, the Irish tricolour, and the Starry Plough. The presence of two flags reminds us that the Rising meant different things to different participants, and this is a salient point when we consider the whole concept of commemoration. This is not the place to debate the entire premise of the 1916 Rising, but I feel safe in telling you that there were several differing agendas on the minds of the participants – some prioritised workers’ rights, some were involved for women’s’ rights, some fought for idealistic principles- but there was a collective belief among the insurgents that Ireland should be self-governing. We will return to this point later.\n\nThe singer is on the stage, the heat rises up from the audience, and the show begins. The first song is a lament for James Connolly, written by Patrick Galvin. Connolly was one of the founders of the Irish Citizen Army, one of the signatories of the proclamation, and one of the men executed in the Gaol.\n\nAs the song is performed, Dorgan, almost casually, declares\n\n‘We are joined by the dead’.\n\nDorgan has brought us through a narrow gate, and under the gallows. He remains calm but insists that the spectres of the dead men of the prison have appeared, ‘shirtsleeved, disbelieving’.\n\nOnce more, I have to stop here, and think about what the poet has just done. He has brought in ghosts. Theatrical magic – and I cannot help but think of the most famous ghost of them all, in Act 1, scene 1 of Hamlet. A ghost who is restless and perturbed, who will not be at peace until his son rights the wrongs. Is something rotten in the Free State? It seems so.\n\nThe poet tells us that ‘the guards had long since vanished’ – British rule is long gone – but the ghosts are gaunt, pale, and still traumatised by the violence of the rising. (Dorgan’s pale warriors also brought to mind Keats’ La Belle Dame Sans Merci’ and Yeats’ September 1913 – the notion of being ‘in thrall’ or ‘maddened’, or ‘faoi geasa’ (under a spell); there’s a bookcaseful of Irish poems that use the female as a cypher for patriotic fervour, and ‘pale’ triggered this for me).\n\nDorgan reminds us that these men suffered. Their last living memories were filled with pain and fear. Dorgan imagines their confusion as witnesses to the hateful gaol now filled with lights, music, action. Flags last seen on bomb sites are now backdrops on a stage. WTF, you imagine them think.\n\nAnd then comes that phrase, (every good poem has that phrase,) that does the heavy lifting –\n\nOnly the dignity of the singer’s art had power to release them.\n\nOh God. What a line. What a word! Dignity.\n\nLet’s unpack this. I think that Dorgan is telling us that respect and honour is manifest in the artist’s treatment of the subject. Art is where truths are revealed, and reputation resides. Returning to my point about commemorative hijacking, I think Dorgan is landing a very interesting idea here. He appears to trust neither audiences, nor governments, to commemorate. He trusts Art. To quote Mandy Rice Davies, ‘well he would, wouldn’t he’ – but in fairness, in this instance, Dorgan is reporting as a witness, as one who ‘felt it’, one who ‘saw it’, one who would never be the same again.\n\nThe dead depart, and let me digress here for a second. The audience came into the gaol in twos and threes, and the dead men depart in twos and threes. And sitting on a wall in Inniskeen, (see my blog post on Inniskeen Road; A July Evening), poet Patrick Kavanagh describes the happy teenagers of Monaghan go by in twos and threes, as he, by virtue of being a poet, remains alone, but gifted with an artist’s sensibility. Another vindication of the role of artist, methinks. Anyhow, returning to Dorgan, as the dead depart, he sees their souls ‘fan upwards, like leaves from a dry book’. Is this a jab at historians, who, in the least imaginative way possible, have rendered these men as slim, two-dimensional footnotes to a process? Dorgan says it again; ‘That soft-footed gathering of the dead into their peace was like something out of a book’. But not a dry book this time. A novelist’s creation, perhaps? A poet’s?\n\nThere is a profound sincerity and honesty in the last line of the poem, completely antithetical to any hint of appropriation or chest-beating. Dorgan has successfully documented a moment of transcendence, delivered by a singer on a stage. His message seems to be that commemoration need not be discordant, if one can reach beyond politics, to humanity. The boatmen and boatwomen who can take us on this journey are the artists, and the transport is the dignity of art. If we trust this, we will pay the due respect to the dead.\n\nDoes this offer us any solution to the issue of statues, flags, and buildings? Well, it may be useful to borrow Dorgan’s repeated insistence on calmness and kindness, for starters. It may be useful to distinguish between the political and the artistic. It may be constructive to seek out where dignity lies. It might be wise, before the lights go down, to examine each other shyly.\n\nEnjoy the poem!\n\n( For a reading of this poem by Theo Dorgan, please visit here )\n\nKILMAINHAM GAOL, DUBLIN, EASTER 1991 by Theo Dorgan\n\nRoadies in ponytails stringing lights and cables,\n\na beer can popped in the corner, echo of sound check.\n\nOutside in the filling yard, hum of expectation.\n\nWe pour through the narrow gate under the gallows hook\n\nin twos and threes, becoming an audience.\n\nBefore the lights go down we examine each other shyly.\n\nThe singer surveys his audience, heat rising\n\nto the tricolour and Plough overhead.\n\nAs the first words of Galvin’s lament climb to invoke\n\nJames Connolly’s ghost, we are joined by the dead.\n\nI say this as calmly as I can.

Snowdrops are tiny white flowers, usually the first to appear after winter, telling us that Spring, growth, renewal, warm weather- all the pleasant resurgence of nature is on its way. Meehan takes this idea and juxtaposes it a very opposite reality – a friend is dying, poised to leave the world and enter the realm of the unknown. We don’t find this out until the end of the poem, so she is gently and carefully leading us to this revelation, with a study of the little flowers; a forensic investigation ‘under the hood’.\n\nThe title of the poem sets up what will become a deception. The reader is lured into believing the poem is about snowdrops, and the first two lines reinforce our assumption with the word ‘them’ – it must be the eponymous flowers. She has been grappling with their form, with reproducing them – not the flower itself, but their ‘shadows on the concrete path’. Therefore, the snowdrop is not a simple thing, nor is it independent of its situation or its place in time; there is a concrete path nearby, there is a shadow cast by a moving, low February sun.\n\nShe continues her inspection: they are not really white flowers either. The poet gets on her knees now, to get closer, and her investigation ‘under their petticoats’ reveals surprisingly wonderful riches and excitements. Her imagery here is suggestive of both the religious and the erotic; obedient and licentious, civilization and circus. It is a surprise that the obeisant little flower can contain such a ‘frantic small scale festive air’.\n\nAnd then, the poet locates herself in time and place- shadows and concrete. We learn she is directly addressing a dying friend. This has become a private and intimate conversation, and we have become eavesdroppers. Loss is on her mind as she studies the snowdrop, and so now we must contextualize her discoveries. Her friend, we are told, prefers to leave the spring flowers to endure, die, and ‘wither back into the earth’ as nature intended. In a powerful last line, we learn of her friend’s philosophical outlook on allowing nature to take its course. It is then I understand the snowdrop to be a metaphor for what I might call the ordinary person’s life – it may appear fragile, or simple, or fleeting, but it is not what it seems, and holds within it extraordinary riches, and contradictions, and secrets, and excitements. And ultimately, our lives are never wasted or forgotten; in some way, in mysterious ways, our small lives add, contribute, nurture, enable that which comes after us.\n\nEveryone has their own preference when it comes to poetry, and language. I love poems of comfort, and it is interesting here, and not uncommon, I think, that it is the poet-friend who is interrogating the natural process, and the dying friend who supplies the comfort. I think anyone who is dealing with the imminent death of a loved one is often much more challenged by its reality than the person facing the journey. In my experience, it is the stoicism of the dying that give strength and courage to those who will be left behind. I am not sure, despite the best attempts of the poet, that she really believes that bereavement can be kind. ‘You tell me’ is indeed, telling.\n\nI do love Paula Meehan’s poetry, and she is well worth reading; I will return to more of her poems in due course. In a shameless exercise of name-dropping, I will tell you that I know Paula, (although we have never discussed this poem – she might say I am not even close to interpreting it as she meant it!) But that doesn’t matter either – a poem, like the snowdrop, is for us to examine, and see it as we see it. This is a lovely, gentle, conflicted goodbye for a friend, and one I hope you enjoy reading.\n\nSnowdrops, by Paula Meehan.\n\nSo long trying to paint them, failing\n\nto paint their shadows on the concrete path.\n\nThey are less a white than a bleaching out of green.\n\nIf you go down on your knees\n\nand tilt their petals towards you\n\nyou’ll look up under their petticoats\n\ninto a hoard of gold\n\nlike secret sunlight and their\n\nthree tiny striped green awnings that lend a\n\nkind of frantic small-scale festive air.\n\nIt is the first day of February\n\nand I nearly picked a bunch for you,\n\nmy dying friend, but remembered in time\n\nhow you prefer to leave them\n\nto wither back into the earth;\n\nhow you tell me it strengthens the stock.\n\nPoem 17: Inniskeen Road: July Evening by Patrick Kavanagh\n\nHello again. There was a few things that inspired the choice of poem this week. I was speaking to a colleague about the importance of bicycles as a means for escape for people in rural Ireland- not just travel or transport, but actually a means of liberation. I had read, in particular, about the freedom the bicycle gave women, in various ways- they were able to go places alone, fashion evolved to allow for more practical clothing, and it allowed suffragettes to campaign effectively. So I had bicycles on my mind. The second thing that we all probably have on our minds these days is isolation, and perhaps, the anger and frustration you might feel if you are excluded from ‘normal’ social interaction. I, and half the world have either read, or are watching, Sally Rooney’s ‘Normal People’, and the inarticulacy of the Irish male is explored- and this is an oft-visited theme in Irish literature; perhaps the best example of this is the character of Gar in Brian Friel’s ‘Philadelphia, Here I Come’ – Friel actually has two actors play the part of one man – the inner self is loquacious, witty, garrulous – and his external self is thick-tongued and awkward. Both these thoughts took me straight to Patrick Kavanagh, and this terrific sonnet about the isolation of the rural Irish lad. However, this poem takes a very interesting twist in the second part; I want to see what you think about it. But let’s look at the opening.\n\nThe title tells us very specifically where the poem is set. It is on Iniskeen Road, on a July evening. Iniskeen is the tiny rural town where Kavanagh lived, and we know it’s the summertime, when darkness does not fall until the small hours. The days are long. In the first four lines, we hear about lots of activities – those bicycles appear, not singularly, but in ‘twos and threes’ – there’s a dance, and people are chatting and signalling to each other using ‘the wink and elbow language of delight’. Isn’t that a fantastic way to suggest the fun, innuendo and double entendres of a gang of teenagers on their way to a party. This is a club, a closed group of happy people who can communicate with each other in intimate and confident ways.\n\nIn the second quatrain, we learn that the narrator of the poem must still be by the roadside, because he describes it as utterly empty. There’s not even a hint of a person, or the sound of a person. So he is not part of the codes or secrets of the passers-by. He is left behind, on a mile of road, alone.\n\nPause for a second to see how the poet uses language to make the first half of the octet full of motion and noise. There’s a lot of alliteration, short vowel sounds and the ‘ands’ convey a sense of breathlessness and excitement. By ‘half-past eight’ the poet changes the sound, using long vowel sounds – ‘mile’, ‘road’, ‘shadow’ ‘thrown’ ‘stone’ – he slows everything down, enhancing the sense of loneliness and isolation.\n\nSo we’ve learnt a lot in those two short verses. There’s great craic happening somewhere, everyone in the village is going, except for one fellow, who is left behind. And we wonder why? The explanation is, I believe, not what we expect.\n\nIn the second part, we get more information about the narrator. We learn he is a poet, and he is conflicted about what this gift brings to him – he mentions the ‘solemn talk and contemplation’, presumably about art, or the artist – one gets a whiff of disdain here, perhaps for academia, or intellectual society, (which would fit with Kavanagh’s experience- there is always, in this rural poet, signs of self-consciousness about his lack of formal education; read ‘Stony Grey Soil of Monaghan’ for a poignant and vehement expression of this condition). He does not find an equivalent with another writer or artist, so he rejects any philosophical argument about artistic sensitivity being some kind of exclusive privilege – he compares himself to Alexander Selkirk, an eighteenth century privateer, who was marooned on a desert island for four years. It is a very interesting association, with lots of implications; the obvious one being the unwanted isolation visited upon him; but Selkirk not only survived the island experience, but became resourceful, skilful, and more at peace with himself. The captain who rescued Selkirk observed “[O]ne may see that solitude and retirement from the world is not such an insufferable state of life as most men imagine, especially when people are fairly called or thrown into it unavoidably, as this man was.”\n\nSo in the last few lines, when Kavanagh declares himself ‘King/ of banks and stones and every blooming thing’, I do think he recognises that it is not the talent itself that isolates the artist, it is the responsibility it brings- in other words, (Shakespeare’s words actually,) ‘Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown. ’ It is also worth noting that Kavanagh once again contrasts movement and inertness – but he reverses it this time; he speaks of talk and contemplation, (I feel he really wants to say ‘bullshit’) and then moves to Selkirk, a man who busied himself building and hunting, and mastering his territory in measurable and visible ways. So it makes me think that this little poem, far from being a pity party for a lonely poet, is a much more important reflection on art and the artist. It is also gloriously dressed in the Irish landscape, and speech rhythms, and folkish locality, which in itself distinguishes it from more ‘solemn’ reflections, (Yeats anyone?) and once again, Kavanagh demonstrates a way of performing inside the lesser-celebrated spaces of Irish culture that is as meaningful and successful as any other.\n\nI hope you enjoy the poem.\n\nInniskeen Road: July Evening -Patrick Kavanagh\n\nThe bicycles go by in twos and threes –\n\nThere’s a dance in Billy Brennan’s barn tonight,\n\nAnd there’s the half-talk code of mysteries\n\nAnd the wink-and-elbow language of delight.\n\nHalf-past eight and there is not a spot\n\nUpon a mile of road, no shadow thrown\n\nThat might turn out a man or woman, not\n\nA footfall tapping secrecies of stone.\n\nI have what every poet hates in spite\n\nOf all the solemn talk of contemplation.\n\nOh, Alexander Selkirk knew the plight\n\nOf being king and government and nation.\n\nA road, a mile of kingdom. I am king\n\nOf banks and stones and every blooming thing.\n\nPoem 16: The Lake Isle of Inisfree by W.B. Yeats\n\nHello again everyone. I hope you are all doing well. Today’s poem is one of the most popular Irish poems, and written by probably Ireland’s best known poet, William Butler Yeats. If you’ve read the earlier poems, you’ll have already been introduced to W.B., he was a bit of an odd fish, but when it comes to love, or landscapes, he is definitely one of the best. All of the Yeats family – Jack, Susan, Elizabeth and William were somewhat peripatetic and outside of the safety of the cultural cocoon that most people land in, and stay in. Their family circumstances were unusual, and their ‘outsider’ status is often expressed through their respective art forms. William, in particular, always seemed to be searching- literally and artistically, for an ideal, or an answer, or for respite, or release.\n\nThe fact that there is a region in Ireland known as ‘Yeats Country’ testifies to the time spent, and inspiration borrowed, by the Yeats family in the counties of Sligo and Leitrim. It is truthfully, a staggeringly beautiful and dramatic landscape, with an abundance of heart-stopping scenery. In a relatively compact area, the glens of Leitrim are snugged into the Dartry Mountains, which in turn sweep down to the exhilarating, ragged Atlantic coastline. Irish weather is well-known for its rainy reputation, but the plentiful water supply gives us acres of lakelands, waterfalls, streams and hidden loughs, draining the boglands and gurgling down into the sea. There is a very low population density in this area of Ireland, a legacy of famine and emigration, and the absence of industrial development, so you can truly travel for miles through the landscapes, uninterrupted by modernity or technology. The sturdiest buildings in the valleys are often stalwart towerhouses of long-since deposed chieftans, the crumbling ‘big houses’ of the Anglo-Irish, and the deserted, roofless cottages of the evicted peasants. The scars of the history are everywhere, and while the narrative is relentlessly grim, the ability of nature to grow through and over and above and below these places, polka-dotting a door frame with wild daisies, or quilting an old wall with ivy, creates this unique palimpsest, a tapestry that links history, culture, folklore, ritual, pagan, Christian, conflict, community, geography, weather, beauty and loss.\n\n‘The Lake Isle of Inisfree’ is W.B. Yeats attempt to channel the healing and therapy that a landscape like this can provide. His dream-space is called Innisfree. ‘Innis / Inis ’ is Irish for island, it’s a common prefix for Irish places, in fact, there are a few Inisfrees around, but the island he’s referring to is a very small, overgrown hillock in a large lake nestled between the counties of Sligo and Leitrim. The Lake itself is called ‘Lough Gill’, in Irish, ‘Lough Geall’, meaning bright, shiny – and it really is – there is extraordinary light and shade across the lake, in all seasons. Perched on the shores of Lough Gill is the old castle of the O’Rourke chieftains, later, the home of the English Parke family. The O’Rourkes contribute many dramatic historical stories to the area, not least the hospitality offered to a lost Spanish sailor, and the subsequent hanging at Tyburn of Brian O’Rourke for his generosity. Up to, and including Yeats’ own time in the Sligo area, stories, legends, myths, and anecdotes abound, immersing the lake and its islands in a cultural mist that is inseparable from the terrain.\n\nIn terms of nature, the lake and its islands are ambrosial, teeming with verdant, prolific growth almost all year round. And so it is not surprising that Yeats’ concept of a personal utopia is set in this remarkable place. What you might note though, is that the poet writes about his intention of escaping to the lake isle- it is all in the future tense. He’s not actually there. He will arise and go. And this is why I like the poem – similar to Wordsworth’s ‘Tintern Abbey’, the poet is not actually living in the place he describes- but he uses the memory of it as a mental salve, as an antidote to anxiety and stress. I think it’s a very human trait (especially in these lockdown days) to dream of escaping to an beloved location – and to idolise its virtues and imagine it as the perfect space. Yeats writes that he will build a cabin for himself, and have beans, bees, and all the eco-friendly, self sufficiency of the hippest hipster ever.\n\nI’m going to come back to this thought shortly – but suspend it briefly, and allow yourself to luxuriate in the sounds and the imagery of the second verse. Look at the repetition of the words ‘peace’ and ‘dropping’, with their long vowel sounds, look at the ‘l’ sounds of ‘veils’, ‘glimmer’, ‘linnet’ and ‘purple’, and the sibilance ( the ‘s’ sounds) of peace, veils, slow, sings, and how these sounds are folded into words describing a day on the island- misty mornings, starry nights, birds and insects and every hour more lovely than the last. The line ‘Peace comes dropping slow’ is delicious – its going to ooze through like the honey from the hive, its going to be pervasive, steady, enduring.\n\nIn the final verse, the poet snaps out of his reverie, and we see what’s really going on. He’s in a place of roadways and grey pavements. Real life feels colourless and tiring, mitigated only by imagination, the sensations prompted by memory, the power of the inner self to transport itself to somewhere else when necessary.\n\nAt the risk of spoiling what is undoubtedly a beautiful poem, I do want to raise two talking points with you. First of all, it is highly unlikely that W.B. Yeats would abandon his social circuit and perquisite lifestyle to go and live on an island by himself – and secondly, this romantic and fanciful idealisation of the simple, country life smacks somewhat of privilege. This poem was written in the 1880s, – Yeats would have been in his early twenties, so hardly beaten down by the world quite yet, it is thirty years after the famine, and it is still a period of atrocious poverty in Ireland, in both the city and countryside. Now obviously, everyone has the right to a fantasy where the insects don’t sting you, and you don’t become sick of beans and honey – but the invisibility of hardship, or the transformation from poor to ‘rustic’ and ‘simple’ in Anglo-Irish literature is problematic for me- a type of colonial blindness, that can extract – borrow, really, the aesthetic without any responsibility to the social, the economic, or the cultural.\n\nHowever, my gripes aside, escapism is wonderful, and we all do it, – and the fact is that the corner of the West of Ireland that Yeats is describing is as beautiful as is suggested by the poem. But you’ll have to come and see for yourself ! Enjoy the poem!\n\nThe Lake Isle of Innisfree By W.B. Yeats\n\nI will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,\n\nAnd a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;\n\nNine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,\n\nAnd live alone in the bee-loud glade.\n\nAnd I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,\n\nDropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;\n\nThere midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,\n\nAnd evening full of the linnet’s wings.\n\nI will arise and go now, for always night and day\n\nI hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;\n\nWhile I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,\n\nI hear it in the deep heart’s core.\n\nPoem 15: A Disused Shed in Co. Wexford by Derek Mahon\n\n‘Everything Is Going to Be All Right’ by Derek Mahon from New Selected Poems (2016) reproduced by kind permission of the author’s Estate and The Gallery Press. https://www.gallerypress.com/product/new-selected-poems-derek-mahon/\n\nHello everyone. Welcome back to the poetry blog. I hope you are all doing well. Our next poem today was prompted by various conversations I’ve witnessed on twitter lately. Social media appears to be a see-saw dialogue of acts of enormous kindness, and acts of unbelievable self-interest. You may have seen (and many people sent me the New York Times link) that a fund set up to support the Navajo Nation was inundated with donations from Irish donors, who remembered that during the Great Hunger in Ireland, the Choctaw nation sent a donation of $170 to the starving Irish. It was an incredible gesture from one nation to another, during very hard times for both. Here’s the link if you haven’t read it\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/world/coronavirus-ireland-native-american-tribes.html\n\nI was profoundly moved, and proud of this generosity, but please believe me that there are plenty of people in all of our communities that are spewing out despicable sentiments, and following them up with dangerous and provocative actions. It’s hard to understand why people become clustered into blinkered and inhumane mobs, but they do, and we all seem to be getting so bogged down in the fight, we are not really exploring why it is that this situation has come about.\n\nOne of the reasons that I will always advocate for the importance of the humanities in education (it will be the hill on which I’ll die!) is that history and literature can often help us make sense of our own world, in a way that is less aggressive or confrontational. When I say history, I do not mean the very narrow narrative we learnt at school, which was mostly a sequence of kingship and wars, I mean an understanding of the broader past, and how we might use it to navigate the present. Most people love history, when they don’t think of it as a school subject, and it lurks around everywhere, hiding in novels, TV and movies, your grandmother’s pearls, the tree with your parents’ initials carved into it. Poetry works the same way, although people seem even more afraid of it. I have gotten lots of emails saying ‘I don’t do poetry, but I like your photograph blogs’ and quite frankly, I don’t buy it. If you sigh at a sunset, or gasp on a starry night, you do poetry. Like history, poetry can be a scary label, but it’s waiting right there when you’re ready to embrace it.\n\nAnyhow, this brings me to the next poem, which is another one by Derek Mahon, and the poem that came to mind when I read about the Navajo. This is an absolutely beautiful poem, and as Irish as a poem can be, – and yet, it is not about Ireland at all. It is loaded with images of nature, wild plants, fungi, – but it’s not about any of these things. This is a poem about humanity, and it is riveting.\n\nLet’s start with the title. A Disused shed in County Wexford. I don’t think we have to explain what a disused shed is, but for non-Irish readers, Wexford is a county on the east coast of Ireland. It’s not (with apologies to Wexford people) a county known for dramatic land or seascapes, – it’s not on the Wild Atlantic Way, or associated with the ‘to hell or to Connacht’ counties – it’s relatively benign as a location. So- the entire title, paraphrased, might read ‘ an old outhouse somewhere nobody is excited about’. What is this poem going to say, then?\n\nWe have a quote after the title, which may be to encourage us to read on, in spite of the title. There’s a mention of ‘weak souls among the asphodels’. Asphodels are lilies, with associations to the underworld. But even if we don’t know that, the poet is hinting that the disused shed story might be about something more profound than the title suggests.\n\nSo- the first verse is just a masterclass in setting a mood. Old places, that are deserted, abandoned, forgotten by time and progress. Look at the sentence ‘a slow clock of condensation’. Not only does the image suggest the stuporous pace, but the long vowel sounds and consonant combination of ‘slow’ and ‘clock’ literally drags our eyes / tongue along the line. Same with ‘an echo trapped for ever’ ‘wildflowers in the lift-shaft’ – the sounds are languorous and evocative, and the mind’s eye is transported to scenes of dereliction, silence, an interminable vacancy of action. And what about the line that says ‘a door bangs with diminished confidence’ ? Isn’t that a hell of a sentence? And finally we get to the shed.\n\nIt’s on wasteland, ‘on the grounds of a burnt out hotel.’ And amongst all of the clutter and rubbish, there is a clutch of mushrooms, all straining to a keyhole for light. They become the story now- a thousand sweaty fungi that nobody loves, or cares about. The poet wants you to start thinking about this cluster of ugly little fellows as human – he does this by attributing human qualities to them – they have learnt to be patient and silent. They listen to the birds. They are waiting for something to happen. We learn that a mycologist – a mushroom scientist, if you like, – once came to see them, but we hear about his ‘gravel crunching departure’. He closed the door on them after taking a look – he closed the light on them.\n\nStop here, and again, luxuriate in the way the poet describes the desperation and the loneliness of being forgotten. Once a day they hear something- a noise that signals hope- but it turns out to be nothing. ‘A lorry changing gears at the end of the lane’ – is it- is it someone coming?\n\nNo.\n\nAs you read on, you see where the poet is going now. People who have suffered, and have been forgotten. Victims of circumstance who cannot help themselves. People who are not seen, and depend on others to act on their behalf. All they are able to do is survive, and wait.\n\nThere are so many lines here that continue the plant metaphor, but are loaded with horror and distress, torture and torment. The last verse is a desperate appeal for empathy and activism. Look at the way we have moved from torpidity to turmoil. What appeared to be inert and invisible reveals itself to us to be immediate and urgent.\n\nRead the poem a few times, and let the imagery and the language do its work. See how you feel when you finish it. Then do something kind for someone who does not have a voice.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nA Disused Shed in Co. Wexford by Derek Mahon\n\nA Disused Shed in Co.

As you probably know by now, my choice of poems is quite random- I’ve no real plan here, other than to pick poems by Irish writers that I love, offer you a little context and direction, and then I leave it to you to see what you think! Today’s choice was prompted by a conversation I heard on the radio, about the T.V. series of Sally Rooney’s novel, ‘Normal People’. I haven’t seen it myself, but apparently some of the good folk of Ireland have been offended by the scenes of intimacy – particularly, it seems, by the male (or ‘full frontal’) nudity. Straight away, I was reminded of a poem by Irish writer Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill, titled ‘Gan do Chuid Éadaigh’, which translates directly as ‘without your clothes’. This poem was translated from Irish by Paul Muldoon, and given the title ‘Nude’.\n\nBefore we get to the poem, we have to consider that the original text is written in Irish language, and a second poet has been involved in its transition into a different language. So you might wonder how that alters the poem, in terms of rhythm, theme, meaning, and imagination. I feel very lucky that I am able to read both texts, and I think that Muldoon did a great job preserving the coquettish sense of fun and mischief that Ní Dhomhnaill laces through each line. And to quote Ní Dhomhnaill, ‘It doesn’t really matter if the words mean different things. The important thing to get is the voltage that is behind the words’. So if you don’t read Irish, you’ll have to take my word that the translation is faithful. I’ll also include the Irish language text here for you.\n\nThe poem is a celebration of the male body, and it is very much subject to the gaze of the female writer. This, of course, is a (welcome) change; gender roles are swapped, and the poet opens with a blunt, explicit admission addressed directly to the subject of a poem, a man, which is that she prefers to see him naked. Even before we go any further, this is quite shocking! It’s an overt statement, loaded with raw desire. I think it does one of two things to the reader – it either makes you feel acutely aware that you are eavesdropping on an intensely private conversation, OR it immediately pulls you in to the dialogue as the speaker – giving you the vicarious thrill of indulging yourself as a lusty, sexually charged voyeur, and admitting it. I think this is a very clever manipulation of the traditional male gaze, and its honesty in risqué is totally refreshing – especially considering the historically censorious and judgmental culture in Ireland towards women and sexuality.\n\nThe poet then has some fun at the man’s expense- detailing very specifically how he is dressed. He’s a bit of a dandy, with a three-piece suit, a hat at a just-so angle, gloves and an umbrella under his arm. Muldoon translates this as ‘a brolly under your oxter’, which suggests a mocking tone – for all this man’s finery and almost feminine garb, the poet doesn’t seem that impressed. She describes his clothes as ‘the icing on the cake’. She becomes more intense as she describes what she knows is underneath. The language changes from comic to feral, from cartoonish to powerful, physical and sensual.\n\nShe’s not afraid of the penis either – describing it as ‘the pleasure source’, and detailing its texture and scent. She acknowledges, refreshingly, that sensuality and sexuality impacts not only on men, but also on women.\n\nThe poem concludes with a leap to a date the couple will have later, when they will dance together. She wants him to know she’d prefer him naked, but to keep the other women at bay, she suggests he keeps his clothes on. I love this, because it implies confidence, intimacy, and security.\n\nWhile there is a communion between the poet and subject here, more powerful is the intimacy between the poet and the reader, especially the Irish woman reader. Very few public texts I’ve ever read have articulated this raw joy and celebration of the male body, but it’s not an unusual conversation among girlfriends, where the space to be bawdy and explicit exists. It’s interesting to contemplate the difference between men lusting "
