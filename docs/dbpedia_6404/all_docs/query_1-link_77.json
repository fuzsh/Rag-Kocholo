        "text": "Happy Friday, and welcome to your weekly roundup of everything new that’s come to Netflix over the past seven days. It’s been a busy week for new releases with titles from all around the world.\n\nBefore we dive in, if you want to see what’s still to come throughout the remaining few weeks of July, check out our preview here. We’re also now cataloging all the August 2024 releases planned here.\n\nNo more waffle! Let’s dig into some highlights for the week, the full list of new titles, and what’s been trending over the last seven days.\n\nBest New Movies and Series Added to Netflix This Week\n\nThe Long Game (2023)\n\nRating: PG\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Drama, History, Sport\n\nDirector: Julio Quintana\n\nCast: Jay Hernandez, Dennis Quaid, Cheech Marin\n\nWriter: Jennifer C. Stetson, Paco Farias, Julio Quintana\n\nRuntime: 112 min / 1h 52m\n\nMaking its streaming debut via Netflix today is a sports biopic that debuted in select theaters earlier this year and caught the imaginations of the audiences that watched it.\n\nThe plot revolves around a golfing veteran who takes a chance to get a group of underdog golfers to pick up a club and compete in a highly competitive state competition.\n\nTickled (2016)\n\nRating: R\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Documentary, Crime, Mystery\n\nDirector: David Farrier, Dylan Reeve\n\nCast: David Farrier, Dylan Reeve, David Starr\n\nRuntime: 92 min / 1h 32m\n\nNetflix has some bizarre documentaries, but there’s no way around it. Trying to take the top spot is the addition of the 2016 documentary that looks to delve deep into the work of competitive tickling. No, that’s not a typo.\n\nIf you fancy a David Farrier binge, this addition adds to two others from the Kiwi director that are currently streaming. You’ve got the single season of Dark Tourist, released in 2018, and more recently, we’ve seen the release of Mister Organ.\n\nExploding Kittens (Season 1)\n\nNumber of episodes: 9\n\nRating: TV-14\n\nLanguage: English\n\nGenre: Animation, Comedy\n\nCast: Suzy Nakamura, Kenny Yates, David Gborie\n\nRuntime: 26 mins\n\nAdult animation on Netflix has had a rough go of it lately, but a new adaptation of the world-famous card game, which even got a Netflix mobile entry in recent years, is hoping to turn Netflix’s fortunes around.\n\nSome early reviews have been mostly positive, with Angie Han for The Hollywood Reporter saying the cast carries most of the humor, concluding that if you’re “looking for light humor, you could do worse than watching Godcat warm to the joys of Whac-A-Mole and Bruce Willis, or strike up a flirtation with Beelzebub over cocktails and Snow Patrol’s “Chasing Cars.”\n\nFull List of New Releases on Netflix This Week\n\n18 New Movies Added This Week\n\nBad Boys (1995) – R – English\n\nBad Boys II (2003) – R – English\n\nBlame the Game (2024) Netflix Original – TV-MA – German\n\nBoruto: Naruto the Movie (2015) – PG – Japanese\n\nHannah Berner: We Ride at Dawn (2024) Netflix Original – TV-MA – English\n\nIt’s Only Life After All (2023) – TV-MA – English\n\nKuyang (2024) – TV-MA – Indonesian\n\nLobola Man (2024) Netflix Original – TV-14 – Zulu\n\nMaharaja (2024) – TV-MA – Tamil\n\nRoad To Ninja -Naruto The movie- (2012) – TV-14 – English\n\nThe Champion (2024) Netflix Original – TV-MA – Spanish\n\nThe Last: Naruto the Movie (2014) – TV-14 – Japanese\n\nThe Long Game (2023) – PG – English\n\nThe Neon Highway (2024) – PG-13 – English\n\nThe Peasants (2023) – R – Polish\n\nTickled (2016) – R – English\n\nVanished into the Night (2024) Netflix Original – TV-MA – Italian\n\nWild Wild Punjab (2024) Netflix Original – TV-MA – Hindi\n\n9 New TV Series Added This Week\n\nAnother Self (Season 2) Netflix Original – TV-MA – Turkish\n\nBest of The Great Indian Kapil Show (Season 1) Netflix Original – TV-MA – Hindi\n\nEva Lasting (Season 2) Netflix Original – TV-MA – Spanish\n\nExploding Kittens (Season 1) Netflix Original – TV-14 – English\n\nKinnikuman Perfect Origin Arc (Season 1 – New Episodes Weekly) – TV-14 – Japanese\n\nReceiver (Season 1 ) Netflix Original – TV-MA – English\n\nSugar Rush: The Baking Point (Season 2) Netflix Original – TV-PG – Spanish\n\nThe Boyfriend (Season 1 ) Netflix Original – TV-MA – Japanese\n\nVikings: Valhalla (Season 3) Netflix Original – TV-MA – English\n\nMost Popular Movies on Netflix This Week\n\nA full house of points for Eddie Murphy’s return to his iconic role of Axel Foley this week following its premiere last Wednesday, with A Family Affair still performing strongly two weeks after its initial debut.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F (80 points)\n\nA Family Affair (71 points)\n\nMinions (61 points)\n\nThe Blind Side (41 points)\n\nWarcraft (38 points)\n\nThe Little Rascals (24 points)\n\nThe Super Mario Bros.
