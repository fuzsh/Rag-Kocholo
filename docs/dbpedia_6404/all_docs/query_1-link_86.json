        "text": "There aren’t many people who would willingly publicise themselves as a “huge twat,” least of all a celebrity. But actress, comedian and writer, Dawn French, is exceptional in every sense. Her latest standup show – an extension of her recent memoir The Twat Files – is all about embracing your failures and relishing every minute of it.\n\nThe Vicar of Dibley star has returned to Australia for her first shows since 2016 and it was as wonderful as she is. While this was billed as a one-woman ‘stand-up’ gig, the production was more multifaceted than that. French delivers a full, multimedia experience with clips, photos and music from her larger-than-life experiences and glorious career in comedy.\n\nFrench’s show is an utterly relatable one. We have all made mistakes and French reminds us that this is all a part of being human. At times she is so candid in what she is sharing with us that it feels like we are sitting down for a heart-to-heart with the comedy legend rather than watching a gig.\n\nThere is a lot of celebrity name-dropping in “Dawn French Is A Huge Twat,” which in some ways is to be expected. French talks about her partner-in-crime, Jennifer ‘Fatty’ Saunders and the first Mr Dawn French AKA Lenny Henry. There are hilarious anecdotes about a faux pas with a Hollywood superstar and a tragic costume choice for Elton John’s over-the-top 50th birthday party. We can all relate to being fashion victims but let’s just say French and Henry take this to a whole new level.\n\nThe 66-year-old gives us a behind-the-scenes look at some of her famous shows and plays, which will delight fans. It is hilarious that while French is a fiercely funny comedic actress, she also has moments where is can be a fangirl like the rest of us. Her show proves she is unashamedly English- she includes some local references to her beloved UK, which may not have always resonated with the Sydney crowd. She also talks about how she just had to be an Englishwoman in Kenneth Branagh’s Agatha Christie-adaptation, Death On The Nile.\n\nThere are some highly musical moments in this show. French tells us about her dream to be in a musical and how she was considered for a part in Mamma Mia! and everyone was disappointed she missed out. But French had the last laugh by delivering a showstopper from Oliver, in an efficient turn that was both a gift and dream realisation.\n\nDawn French Is A Huge Twat was two hours of self-deprecatingly endearing, sarcastic and hilarious storytelling. This comedy legend was true to her silly self by describing some of her biggest gaffes and cringeworthy moments. This was both highly entertaining and helpful, as it makes us realise that we are all fallible, even the picture-perfect celebrities.\n\nFOUR STARS (OUT OF FIVE)"
