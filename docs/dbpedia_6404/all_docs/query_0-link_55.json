Academic content must be taught alongside equally important competencies such as social-emotional skills, problem solving, critical thinking, self-regulation, and learning dispositions. When taught discretely, this can become an overwhelming task. But when intentionally integrated they become a synergistic and mutually supportive curriculum. This is where cooperative learning truly shines. As one of the most widely studied instructional techniques, cooperative learning addresses content alongside other curricular competencies, allowing teachers to effectively cover multiple standards simultaneously. Unfortunately, cooperative learning is often tried and dismissed because it does not seem to work for a particular developmental range, population, or subject area. This is often due to a misapplication of the technique. This course will explain the philosophical underpinnings and walk participants through the necessary components of cooperative learning. Participants will see examples of what works, what doesn't, and why. If you are looking for a fun way to cover a diverse curriculum while keeping students engaged and learning, this course is for you.\n\nNote: We do require you to be enrolled in the course for two weeks before the course is completed.

It reviews each component of S.T.E.M. and will increase understanding of what is meant by Integrated STEM Education. Through eight modules teachers engage in learning experiences that will increase understanding of organizing concepts for thinking about and using Integrated STEM teaching and learning in the classroom. Participants will learn about the interdependent nature of STEM and other subjects such as English Language Arts and Social Studies and explore ways to integrate other subjects into Integrated STEM learning. They will learn about the high-value strategies that are integral to using and planning Integrated STEM experiences for students. Teachers will have the opportunity to engage with and evaluate examples of integrated STEM lessons/units developed by other teachers and will be guided through the development of their own Integrated STEM lesson/unit. Participants will have formative, self-assessment opportunities that revolve around learning, questions, and developing an understanding of Integrated STEM and how to get started with richer and more effective student learning experiences.\n\nNote: We do require you to be enrolled in the course for two weeks before the course is completed.

Learners will gain the knowledge needed to transform their STEM program into a robust STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math) program. The course begins with a history of art in STEM, and the importance of artistic thinking in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. The course will also include information on how art enhances critical thinking, abstract problem-solving, creativity, collaboration, and communication within STEM/STEAM courses. The course wraps up with an exploration of existing STEM programs, STEAM best practices, resources for makerspaces, and strategies to introduce art into your own STEM classroom.\n\nNote: We do require you to be enrolled in the course for two weeks before the course is completed.

Engineering design, an integral part of STEM education, is an engaging, hands-on method focused on problem-solving, perseverance, and integration of content. It is also a ripe environment for developing interpersonal skills like communication and collaboration. As such, this course will present engineering design as the central vehicle for learning rather than a fun add-on to a lesson or unit. Learners will understand what engineering design looks like at the elementary level, how to plan meaningful engineering projects for students, and how to guide students through the process.\n\nNote: We do require you to be enrolled in the course for two weeks before the course is completed.
