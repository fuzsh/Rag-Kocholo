        "text": "July 14th is Shark Awareness Day, and to celebrate, we are going to discuss the importance of sharks to our planet, and how exciting it can be to dive with them! We will share our top shark safety tips and how to react to different shark behaviors if you encounter sharks while diving or swimming.\n\nYou are very unlikely to ever be attacked by a shark, but it is important to remember they are wild animals that can be dangerous and need our respect. Whether you are a diver, snorkeler, or a swimmer, our top safety tips will boost your confidence in the water, so you can enjoy these magnificent animals and stay safe.\n\nWhy sharks matter.\n\nSharks have existed on our planet for hundreds of millions of years and there are more than 500 species of sharks in the oceans today. It is our responsibility as stewards of our world to keep them here for many more.\n\nBut why do sharks matter for our oceans? Sharks are an indicator of healthy reef ecosystems. Only a balanced reef with a consistent and abundant food supply can support these large marine animals, and they fill the role of one of the top predators on the reef.\n\nThese top predators play a vital role in keeping our oceans healthy. Sharks do this by preying on weak, diseased, or injured animals, as they are easier to catch. This keeps the healthiest and strongest marine species in check.\n\nThis phenomenon is called ‘top down control’ and ensures balanced, thriving ecosystems that support diverse life. It can be seen in many different environments around the world, not just the oceans. Lions on the African plains, or Wolves in North America are other great examples.\n\nFun shark facts.\n\nSharks have many unique features, such as:\n\nTheir skeletons are made out of cartilage instead of bone.\n\nTheir skin is covered by dermal denticles: Quite literally modified tooth cells with an enamel plate.\n\nThese dermal denticles make sharks exceptionally hydrodynamic in the water. So much so, that scientists have designed shark-inspired surfaces for boat hulls, swimwear, and wind turbines, to try and mimic this hydrodynamic efficiency.\n\nSharks can detect electromagnetic fields such as heartbeats and muscular contractions using special pores around their snouts called Ampullae of Lorenzini.\n\nThese pores contain electroconductive jelly, and each one has a nerve cell directly attached to it. This allows sharks to see in complete darkness and to detect hidden prey in crevices within reef structures.\n\nI think we can all agree, sharks are pretty cool.\n\nDid you know that sharks are one of the 6 common worries of first time scuba divers?\n\nEssential shark safety guidelines for scuba divers.\n\nMany divers hope to one day swim alongside these beautiful creatures but they can be nervous of doing so. Although sharks have been portrayed as mindless eating machines by the media for many years, less than eight people are killed by sharks each year.\n\nHaving said that, they are still large, powerful, and sometimes unpredictable apex predators, and they must always be respected. Here are our essential shark safety tips and things to look out for when scuba diving with sharks to stay safe.\n\n1.Stay alert while also remaining calm and confident.\n\nSharks are often curious creatures and will make close passes towards divers to check them out, especially in locations where they are not used to seeing people. The first thing to do when you see a shark is to stay calm and be confident.\n\n2. Be aware of body language – yours and the shark’s.\n\nBody language is the next most important factor in shark safety; both your body language as a diver and understanding the body language of sharks.\n\nSharks are relatively easy to read on a visual basis if you pay attention to the shark’s shape and movement.\n\nThe first and easiest area to assess the shark’s mood is the pectoral fins; the large \"plane wings\" of all sharks. In a calm shark, the pectoral fins are almost flat out to the sides, whereas an agitated shark will display pectoral fins that are almost pointing straight down toward the seabed.\n\nAn agitated shark will also display a hunched appearance as their belly contracts (imagine it like holding tension in the abdominal muscles). The movement of the shark will also change from a maintained slow gentle pace, to displays of acceleration/deceleration, rapid depth changes, and also zig zagging or erratic swimming.\n\nSharks might also come to investigate objects or divers, which can include \"bumping\" with their snouts.\n\nAny one of these behaviors alone is not cause for concern. But if the shark exhibits some of these behaviors together, it is wise to leave the area or end your dive and move locations.\n\n3. Stay with your dive group.\n\nStaying close together with other divers on your safety stop is wise as sharks will often ascend with divers. Make yourself appear as large as possible and point your fins towards the shark to ensure your safety and de-escalate a potentially bad situation.\n\nFollowing basic good habits as a diver or dive group is also very important when diving in places that sharks are regularly seen.\n\nDivers who exhibit good buoyancy control with their equipment neatly stowed have less chance of attracting sharks than divers who ascend or descend erratically and use their hands to scull.\n\nIf the last diver in a group ‘checks their six’ (looks behind them), any sharks approaching from behind will not startle the group. The resulting surprised reactions from the divers will also not startle the shark.\n\nMake sure you remain as a group throughout your dive. Being strung out along the reef with large distances between buddy pairs is not ideal as sharks instinctively approach animals isolated from a larger group.\n\nCarrying a carabiner or some other noise making device is also very useful to gain everyone’s attention if needed.\n\nWant to hover like a pro? Here are 5 tips to perfect your buoyancy.\n\nA guide to shark safety for swimmers and snorkelers.\n\nThe same advice about reading shark behavior applies to snorkelers or swimmers as well. However, being at the surface means there are a few extra things to bear in mind.\n\n1.Wear fins and keep a mask handy.\n\nIt is advisable to always have goggles or ideally a mask with you, so that you can maintain a visual on sharks. Wearing fins in areas where you may encounter sharks is also highly recommended.\n\nSwimming using the legs as opposed to the arms is much better for endurance, plus the fins make you look larger in the water.\n\n2. Keep an eye on the shark and watch its behaviors.\n\nIf you spot a shark while you are swimming or snorkeling, simply observe the animal and look for any of the behaviors mentioned above that might show it is not relaxed.\n\nDo not make a fast and aggressive swim away from the shark. Erratic movements on the surface with lots of splashing will arouse the shark’s curiosity and draw it towards you.\n\n3. Use your fins as a barrier.\n\nIf a shark approaches you on the surface, use both of your fins together to create a barrier between you and the shark. If you are in a group, get together and maintain visual contact with the shark. Stay calm and slowly swim away while keeping your fins underwater to minimize disturbance.\n\nNew to swimming with sharks?

Respect and caution should always be shown around sharks.\n\nThere are some species that are deemed less of a risk, and others that require more caution when interacting with them. These include, bull sharks, oceanic whitetips, tiger sharks, and great white sharks.\n\nStatistics show that you are more likely to be involved in a car crash or be struck by lightning than attacked by a shark. In 2022, 57 reports of shark incidents or attacks were recorded globally, with only five fatalities.\n\nIt is statistically safer to swim in water where sharks are found than to drive to buy your groceries.\n\nConsidering the millions of people that use waters on a daily basis where sharks are found, the number of shark incidents is incredibly low. Although movies like Jaws show sharks as eating every human they encounter, this is absolutely false information. Unfortunately, it leads to mass fear, and culling of these important, ancient creatures.\n\nLearn how to identify different sharks: Here are 7 interesting species of sharks: how they differ and where to see them.\n\nExtra shark safety tips to boost your confidence in the water.\n\nHere are a few extra tips to stay safe in waters where sharks are present:\n\nAvoid diving at dusk or dawn. Sharks use these low light conditions to look for prey.\n\nDive with reputable and knowledgeable dive operators that know the locations they are diving and also the species you will encounter.\n\nUse neutrally colored dive equipment. Black or dark colors are favored by most dive professionals that interact regularly with sharks.\n\nAsk around for local information about which water spots are best avoided.\n\nAvoid diving in river mouths or any areas that may have fish scraps present from commercial activities.\n\nSharks are beautiful creatures that generally do not need to be feared.
