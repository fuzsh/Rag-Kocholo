        "text": "\"Play it by ear.\" \"Gone to pot.\" \"In like Flynn.\" The English language is full of phrases that we casually throw into conversations, often without any idea of what they really mean or how they originated. Take, for example, the phrase, \"The Real McCoy.\" We use it when referring to something that's the real deal -- the genuine article. But just who was \"the real McCoy?\" Where did this phrase come from?\n\nThe name McCoy might immediately bring to mind the Hatfield and McCoy clans, who quarreled along the West Virginia-Kentucky border in the 19th century, but there's no absolutely no evidence linking the phrase's origin to this famous family feud. Depending on which account you believe, the \"real McCoy\" was a boxer, an inventor, a rumrunner or a Scottish clan leader. Here are just a few of the phrase's possible origins:\n\nThese are all great stories, but the real origin of the phrase most likely lies in the misspelling of a Scottish name. A few possible contenders include a popular Scottish actor, a bandit or the chief of a Scottish clan, all of whom shared the name MacKay.\n\nOnce it became popular, the phrase was quickly adopted to promote one of Scotland's most famous exports -- whiskey. A reference in the 1856 Scottish National Dictionary mentioned, \"A drappie (drop) o' the real MacKay,\" which was possibly the first time the phrase appeared in print. Messrs A. & M. Mackay of Glasgow used the slogan, \"the real McKay,\" to advertise their whiskey brand in 1870. Once the saying reached the U.S., it was changed to its current form --\"the real McCoy,\" likely thanks to the famous men who shared the name."
