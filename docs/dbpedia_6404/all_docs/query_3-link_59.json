        "text": "We Dive at Dawn on DVD\n\nLieutenant Taylor (John Mills) and the rest of the crew of the submarine Sea Tiger are given a week's leave after an unsuccessful patrol. Hobson (Eric Portman) goes home to save his marriage, while a reluctant Corrigan (Niall MacGinnis) heads off to his own wedding. The crew are then called back to duty as Sea Tiger is assigned the top secret mission of sinking Nazi Germany's new battleship, the Brandenburg, before it begins sea trials in the Baltic Sea. When the Brandenburg is spotted, Sea Tiger fires all of it's torpedoes, then dives to evade German destroyers dropping depth charges. By expelling oil and other debris, Taylor fools the Germans into believing that the submarine has sunk. They leave, but Sea Tiger no longer has enough fuel to return to England. Taylor decides to have his crew abandon ship near a Danish island. Hobson persuades Taylor to let him go ashore to find oil. Do they find oil for re-fueling? And can they sink the Brandenburg? Watch this powerful WWII drama to find out. It's a classic epic you won't soon forget! 93 minutes - 1943 - Black & White - 4:3."
