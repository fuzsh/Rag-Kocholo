WE DIVE AT DAWN

(1943)

NOW IN COLOR.

Starring

John Mills, Eric Portman and Jack Watling.

The crew of submarine H.M.S. Sea Tiger have their leave (and assorted family problems) cut short when they are recalled for a special mission: sink the new German battleship Brandenburg. En route, they learn that their target has entered the heavily defended Baltic. But rather than give up and return to port, they follow it into dangerous waters. Tension builds as they approach their target. After the attempt, escape seems impossible, unless they can refuel at an enemy port.

Originally filmed in Black and White, we have colorized it.

All the pictures displayed are actual screen shots taken from the movie.
