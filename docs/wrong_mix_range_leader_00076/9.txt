Al-Rahman Mosque (Arabic: جامع الرحمان; transliterates: Mosque of The Most Merciful) in Baghdad, was intended to be one of the largest mosques in Iraq. It was begun by Saddam Hussein in 1998, but work was cut short during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and it was never completed and only its skeleton remains today. It remains uncompleted in Baghdad's Mansour neighbourhood, in the place of the old race track. Its main, uncompleted dome, is surrounded by eight smaller, independent domes, which in turn feature eight even smaller domes integrated into their walls. It is approximately 250 metres (820 ft) in diameter, and occupies 4.5 hectares (11 acres).[2][3][4][5]
