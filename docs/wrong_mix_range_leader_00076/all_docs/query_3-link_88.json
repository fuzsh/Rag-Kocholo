        "text": "The essay sets out to re-examine the events and processes of inter-state and commercial competition that accompanied the arrival of the first Portuguese fleets in the Indian Ocean after the voyage of Vasco da Gama (1497–99). Focusing on the ‘long decade’ from 1498 to 1509, a series of differing perspectives on the challenges caused by the Portuguese to other rival powers is laid out and examined in detail. These include the Venetian conception of the Portuguese enterprise, which tended to be divided between an ‘optimistic’ view (suggesting that the Cape route would collapse quickly), and a more ‘pessimistic’ one, which saw the Serenissima itself as gravely threatened. The geo-political vision of Venetian observers, and the place given by them to the Vijayanagara empire in South India is duly noted with regard to the pepper trade in particular. This view is then contrasted with the abundant but uneven Portuguese documentation available from the time of the viceroyalty of Dom Francisco de Almeida (1505–09). The essay finally sets out to explain and contextualize the Mamluk maritime intervention in the affairs of the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, culminating in the defeat of the fleet of Amir Husain al-Kurdi off Diu in 1509.\n\nWe remind you that you should always take great care to send some men to discover (a descobryr), both to Melaka and to any other parts that are so far not that well-known, and you should send them with some goods in some local ships which are going there, so long as they can carry them safely. And those whom you send for this purpose should be men who know how to act upon it properly (devem ser homens que ho bem saybam fazer).\n\nRoyal instructions to Dom Francisco de Almeida, 3 March 1505.1\n\n3 See Elias, Lipiner, Gaspar da Gama: um converso na Frota de Cabral, Rio de Janeiro: Nova Fronteira, 1987Google Scholar; Sanjay, Subrahmanyam, The career and legend of Vasco da Gama, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997, pp. 146–7Google Scholar. It is clear that Gaspar was aware that the information he provided was erroneous, and he had already begun to modify it somewhat in other reports of 1499–1500; see Jean, Aubin, Le Latin et l’Astrolabe, 3: Études inédites sur le règne de D. Manuel, 1495–1521, Paris: Centre Culturel Calouste Gulbenkian, 2006, pp. 285–7Google Scholar. Two of these reports have recently been identified and will appear in a forthcoming study by Luís Filipe F. R. Thomaz, ‘Gaspar da Gama e a génese de estratégia portuguesa no Índico’, in Actas do Colóquio Comemorativo do 5 centenário de D. Francisco de Almeida, Lisbon: Academia de Marinha, forthcoming. It has been claimed that Gaspar was a Polish Jew, a position supported recently in Rubiés, Joan-Pau , Travel and ethnology in the Renaissance: South India through European eyes, 1250–1625, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 170.CrossRefGoogle Scholar\n\n46 Godinho, Os Descobrimentos, vol. 3, pp. 100–01, fails to see that the root cause of the Egyptian defeat was the abandonment of Amir Husain by Malik Ayaz. Instead, he argues that the problem lay in the fact that ‘the Mamluks above all formed a body of horsemen without any experience of naval combat; they did not possess a body of well-trained mariners’, and cites the decidedly outdated study by Stripling, G. W. F., The Ottomans Turks and the Arabs, 1511–1574, Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1942, p. 30Google Scholar. The situation was quite to the contrary, as Aubin notes (Le Latin et l’Astrolabe, 3, p. 460): ‘Since the Circassians refused to campaign outside Egypt and Syria, and otherwise than on horseback, it was using blacks and European Mamluks that the expeditionary force of 1506 to India was formed’."
