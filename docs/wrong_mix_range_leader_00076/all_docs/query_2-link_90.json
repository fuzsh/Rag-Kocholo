        "text": "Women in different parts of the world generally experience low acceptance in different aspect of public representation as a result of gender preference. Majority of the Gulf States have taken steps to improve representation and participation of women on public platforms although these efforts have not been fully achieved due to many issues and challenges facing the region. The government of Iraq have in many ways shy away from the violation of women’s rights for many years. This violations has resulted to 75% of them being dependent on male counterparts (Al-Ali & Pratt, 2013), this lack of independence has made Iraq a male dominated country supported by religious and cultural doctrines which are less favorable to women as they made victims of the experiences. This paper explains the rights of women from the times Iraqi women were active participants of the country’s development to the Saddam Hussein’s led 1991 Gulf War, to the 2003 invasion by the United States and weather the rights of women have increased or decreased since post Saddam regime. How have women copped and how have they continued to fight for their rights? It also aims to examine how the economic meltdown the country experienced during sanctions affected their rights to public participation.\n\nThe paper explores the changing role of women and gender in Iraq from the 1950s pre-revolutionary period, throughout 35 years of Ba'th regime, economic sanctions to the current post 2003 period. Against the historic background of both state repression and state feminism, gender relations changed rapidly during the period of economic sanctions (1990-2003) which was marked by a drastic turn towards greater social conservatism. But it is in the current context of occupation and the rising influence of Islamist political parties and militias that gender ideologies and relations are at the centre of political contestations, increasing violence and the instrumentalization of human rights issues. This paper aims to challenge the notion of diversity in the context of Iraqi women as represented in the prevailing political and media discourses which focus on ethnic and religious differences. Historically, as the paper will argue, social class, place of origin and political orientation cut across ethnic and religious boundaries and present the main\n\nProfessor Nadje Al-Ali is a professor of gender studies at SOAS, University of London. She has authored several books and articles on the history and present state of Iraqi women including Iraqi Women: Untold Stories From 1948 to the Present and What Kind of Liberation?: Women and the Occupation of Iraq, and was one of the editors of We Are Iraqis: Aesthetics and Politics in a Time of War. The Iraq War has given rise to a number of contradictory stories about women in Iraq. One is that Iraqi women were liberated and on the rise under Saddam, and then all that was reversed after the 2003 invasion as religious parties gained control and attempted to impose their views upon society. An opposing view was that Iraq was a typical Arab Muslim country where women had a secondary role, but then the Americans freed them from these restrictions. To try to provide a clearer picture of what women have gone through both before and after the fall of Saddam Hussein is an interview with Prof. Al-Ali.\n\nThis article examines the ever changing position of women in post-monarchical Iraq. Ironically, many women’s gains obtained under Saddam’s Ba’athist regime were subsequently lost under the same regime. The end of Saddam’s government in 2003 likewise led to contradictory outcomes for Iraqi women, empowering them in some ways and making them more vulnerable in others. Iraqi women themselves have also displayed a variety of dispositions, from the pre-2003 Ba’athist controlled General Federation of Iraqi Women, to Shiite religious conservative women’s groups, secular progressive Kurdish women’s associations operating in autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan, and American sponsored progressive women’s organizations based in Baghdad. Dis-entangling the myriad experiences and trajectories of Iraqi women thus stands out as an important, complex and overdue project for both gender studies and Middle East scholars. This article provides one of the first systematic and contemporary attempts to fill such a void."
