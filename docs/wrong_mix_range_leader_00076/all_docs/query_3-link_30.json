The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:00 a.m., in Room 311, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Jane Harman [Chair of the subcommittee] presiding. Present: Representatives Harman, Kirkpatrick, Green, Himes, King, Broun, and Souder. Also present: Representatives Jackson Lee, Pascrell, and Lungren. Ms. Harman [presiding]. Good morning. Good morning. The subcommittee will come to order. This subcommittee is meeting today to receive testimony on the current threat al-Qaeda poses to the United States. Our hearing is called, ``Reassessing the Evolving al-Qaeda Threat to the Homeland.'' Just over a year ago, this subcommittee held a hearing at which I noted that al-Qaeda's desire and intent to attack us remained undiminished. Peter Bergen and Lawrence Wright, both renowned terrorism experts, testified at that hearing. Bergen asserted that al-Qaeda is losing the long-term battle for hearts and minds, but yet, has rebuilt its capacity along the Af-Pak border, and remains capable of launching large-scale attacks in the West. He predicted that the next terror attack in the United States will probably be committed by someone holding a European passport. Wright said that al-Qaeda attacks will continue. The only real question is scale. He described the organization as adaptive, flexible, and evolutionary, and a long way from extinction. We return to this topic today, because I, for one, believe al-Qaeda is more dangerous now than ever. I am just back from a trip with committee staff and some other colleagues, not on this committee, to Afghanistan and Pakistan, where meetings with foreign and American intelligence officials confirm that al-Qaeda is spreading from its safe haven along the Af-Pak border into Yemen, Somalia, and the Maghreb--and into the United States. Since 9/11, al-Qaeda has morphed from a top-down, vertically integrated entity into a loosely affiliated, horizontal structure. No doubt, we will hear more about that from Dr. Crenshaw. Despite considerable success by the United States and allies in taking out many high-value targets, Westerners continue to train in al-Qaeda camps in the FATA. Peter Bergen is our witness again today, and he in his testimony, which he will deliver shortly, puts the number at 25 American citizens or residents who have been charged with traveling to such training camps since 9/11. Al-Qaeda is also inspiring copy-cat-type attacks, which may be what the Hasan case is about. The ``new terrorist template,'' as TIME magazine calls it this week, will prove an even more difficult threat to mitigate than that posed by the original al-Qaeda. I have been focused on this threat for 8 years--first as the Ranking Member on the House Intelligence Committee, and now as Chair of this subcommittee. In fact, my exposure to it pre- dates 9/11, as I served on the congressionally mandated Commission on Terrorism in 1999 to 2000, which predicted, along with several other studies, a major terrorist attack on U.S. soil. There is much unfinished business. Our homeland remains vulnerable. Recent indictments in the United States against Najibullah Zazi and David Headley are of huge concern. I am concerned. These indictments are important, and I applaud the excellent work of the law enforcement and intelligence agencies involved, including the NYPD. Since 9/11, we have successfully tried and convicted more than 200 individuals with a history of or nexus to international terrorism--in the United States. Consistent with this strong record, I support Attorney General Holder's decision to refer Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other Gitmo detainees for trial in the Southern District of New York. I believe Holder's decision was carefully considered, that our prosecutions will be successful, that all five are likely to be convicted, and that by doing it this way, we will demonstrate to the world that we live by our values-- principal among them the rule of law. Today's hearing will update the subcommittee on the al- Qaeda threat, and we welcome back Mr. Bergen, as well as terrorism experts Paul Pillar, Dr. Martha Crenshaw and retired General David Barno. Our witnesses seem to agree that al-Qaeda is still potent, although less capable of pulling off an attack of the same magnitude or larger than 9/11. It is Mr. Bergen's assessment that al-Qaeda now poses a ``second order threat in which the worst case would be an al- Qaeda-trained or inspired attack.'' Mr. Pillar cites the importance of placing the threat from al-Qaeda within a larger context, one that includes other radical Islamist cells and individuals that may be motivated by grievances and sentiment al-Qaeda seeks to exploit. General Barno agrees. Finally, Dr. Crenshaw, who, as I mentioned, briefed us several weeks ago, asserts that sponsoring terrorist attacks in the West is an ideological imperative essential to the al-Qaeda identity and brand. I personally hope that President Obama's emerging Pak-Af strategy--and my emphasis on Pak is deliberate--will include a broad strategy for targeting al-Qaeda and any other terror group with worldwide reach, and mitigating their threat to the United States. I look forward to a very, very useful conversation, and want to welcome all of you. I will now recognize the gentleman from New York, Mr. King, who is Ranking Member of the full committee, who is sitting in for the Ranking Member of the subcommittee, for an opening statement. Before I do that, without objection, the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Pascrell, is authorized to sit on the dais for the purpose of questioning witnesses during the hearing today. Hearing no objection, so ordered. Mr. King. Mr. King. Thank you, Madame Chair. I, like you, remember the hearing that was held back in, I guess, the summer 2008. It was a fascinating hearing. I look forward to similar testimony here today, of similar insights today. To a large extent, I agree with what the Chair said. I also believe that al-Qaeda central, if you will, is much diminished since September 11. However, al-Qaeda has more. I do believe that. As we saw in London, Madrid--certainly in London--it is second and third generation. It is homegrown terrorists we have to be concerned about. Just in my own region, on Long Island, right outside my district, there was the Vinas case of a young man who was actually trained in an al-Qaeda camp. I think, Mr. Bergen, in your testimony you point out that our intelligence community has not been able to locate these camps, but a not particularly bright person from New York was able to find his way over there and receive the training, and which raises all sorts of questions. But it also shows that he was homegrown, he was active in the community, and he ended up in an al-Qaeda training camp. We have the Fort Dix case. We have the Zazi case, which probably would have been the most serious attack since September 11, had it not been stopped. Again, it was a person who, while he was born in Afghanistan, was to a large extent raised in New York, in Queens, played high school basketball and, in many ways, you would have thought was the typical young American. Yet, he came back to engage in jihad. Then, the Headley case in Chicago, which is very significant. So, this does seem to be, if not a change, certainly a morphing of al-Qaeda. So, I do look forward to your testimony on that. I know Mr. Pascrell and I have had differences on this over the years. To the extent to which the Muslim community in the United States is cooperative with law enforcement, and to the extent that they are not cooperative--I think it is a very real issue that has to be addressed, and political correctness put aside. Which also, I think, bears on the case of Major Hasan. To me, it is extraordinary some of the evidence that was there, that no action was taken against a senior officer in the United States Army with a security clearance. Yet, that was allowed to go on for as long as it did, leading to the tragedy which it did. While I did not intend us to bring it up, I will have to give my response to what the Chair said about the trial in New York. I think it is a dangerous mistake. I believe that we do comply with the law when we hold military tribunals. Military tribunals are part of our law. That is what should be done when we are dealing with enemy combatants. Also, as far as impressing the rest of the world, we had the first World Trade Center case tried in open court. We had the blind sheikh case tried in open court in the 1990s. We showed the world how honest we were, how fair we were, how just we were. During all that time, the USS Cole attack was being planned. There was Khobar Towers. There was the African embassies--and, of course, 9/11. All during and in the aftermath of these public trials, where so much coverage was given, and obviously, it did not seem to impress anyone. Also, much of--it was given in evidence at that trial, despite the best evidence of the prosecutors and the judges, which did help al-Qaeda. If nothing else, just the list of unindicted co-conspirators was very helpful to al-Qaeda. I would just ask the question that Senator Graham asked yesterday. If we capture bin Laden, is he going to be questioned by the military, or by the FBI? Are we allowed to question him? If he is questioned, can he then be brought to a civilian trial? Or does he have to be brought before a military tribunal? Will the soldier on the scene who captures him--if he does capture him--know what he is to do and not do? So, in any event, these are all issues that are probably not the purpose of today's hearing. I had not intended to bring it up, but lest my silence be interpreted as acquiescence, I thought I had to go on the record. With that, I yield back the balance of my time. Again, I commend the Chair for this hearing, as for the great hearing she had in summer 2008. I look forward to the testimony. Ms. Harman. I thank the Ranking Member. We may disagree on a few issues, but not only do I have great respect for him, but I am counting on him to keep my seven children and stepchildren, and all my grandchildren safe, because they all live in New York. Other Members of the subcommittee are reminded that, under the subcommittee rules, opening statements may be submitted for the record. We have large attendance here, I notice this morning, because the subject is important to all of us. So, let me now welcome our witnesses, beginning with Mr. Peter Bergen, who is currently Schwartz senior fellow at the New America Foundation in Washington. He is also a print and television journalist, reporting for publications such as the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Wall Street Journal, and he serves as CNN's senior security analyst. In 2008, he was an adjunct lecturer at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and has also worked as an adjunct professor at the School of Advanced International Studies, SAIS, at Johns Hopkins University. He has authored two well- known books on al-Qaeda, ``Holy War, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of bin Laden,'' and ``The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader.'' Mr. Bergen brings unique experience, and is someone that I have consulted over the years. Welcome to the subcommittee. Let me introduce the rest of you right now, too, and then we will go down the row. Dr. Paul Pillar is a professor and the director of graduate studies overseeing the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University. He retired in 2005 from a 28-year career in the U.S. intelligence community, his last position being national intelligence officer for the Near East and South Asia. Dr. Pillar also served on the National Intelligence Council as one of the original members of its analytic group. Dr. Pillar was a Federal executive fellow at Brookings Institution from 1999 to 2000, and is a retired officer of the U.S. Army Reserve, and whose service included a tour in Vietnam. Dr. Martha Crenshaw is currently a senior fellow at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, where she also works as a professor of political science. Prior to this, she worked as a professor of government at Wesleyan University from 1974 to 2007. She is a lead investigator with the National Center for the Study of Terrorism and Response to Terrorism at the University of Maryland and has served on the executive board of Women in International Security, and chaired the American Political Science Association task force on political violence and terrorism. Finally, Lieutenant General David Barno is currently the director of Near East South Asia Center at the National Defense University. General Barno was recently appointed as the chairman of the Advisory Committee on Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom Veterans and Families by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. He holds degrees from West Point, Georgetown University, and the U.S. Army War College. In 2003, he deployed to Afghanistan for 19 months, commanding over 20,000 U.S. and coalition forces as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. Without objection, the witnesses' full statements will be inserted in the record. I would now ask Mr. Bergen to summarize his statement for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF PETER BERGEN, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW, AMERICAN STRATEGY PROGRAM, AND CO-DIRECTOR, COUNTERTERRORISM STRATEGY INITIATIVE, NEW AMERICA FOUNDATION Mr. Bergen. Thank you very much for the invitation to speak. Thank you very much, Chair Harman. We have already heard from both the Chair and also from the Ranking Member about Najibullah Zazi, Vinas, and Headley. If we had been having this discussion, I think, a year-and-a-half ago, I would have presented, I think, a much more optimistic picture of the threat, or a more sanguine picture of the threat. But I think when you have American citizens showing up in al-Qaeda training camps, when you have somebody like Headley, who the allegation is met with senior militants in the tribal areas, was going to conduct an operation against a Danish newspaper, or may even be involved in the Mumbai attacks, we are in a kind of different frame than we might have been 18 months ago. Chair Harman mentioned this figure which NYU is coming out with a study, the Center of Law and Security, that 25 Americans--either citizens or residents--have been convicted or charged with traveling to an overseas training camp. Now, of course, that number undercounts the real number, because, for instance, in the case of the Somali-Americans, there are probably about two dozen, most from Minnesota, who traveled to Somalia. Only three of that number have actually been charged or convicted of a crime. So, this number undercounts the number. I think it is a fairly large number, given the fact that it is going to a training camp that really makes a difference. I mean, it is one thing to be radicalized over the Internet. Anybody can watch a beheading video, and that does not really get you anywhere in terms of becoming a serious terrorist. If you look at the most serious terrorist attacks in the West in the last two decades, they have one thing in common, which is, at least the leader of the cell, and maybe several others, have actually gone to a war zone or gone to a jihadi training camp. If you do not have that experience, it is very hard to conduct a terrorist operation. You have to learn how to kill people, which is not something that is very natural to most people. I am also concerned about the fact that two Americans have conducted suicide operations in Somalia. The reason I am concerned about that is, once this idea sort of becomes part of the DNA of these groups, it can come home. The reason I say that with some certainty is the British were quite, I think, naive about the idea that British citizens would actually attack in the domestic United Kingdom--even though there had already been attacks by British citizens in Tel Aviv, a suicide attack in 2003, a suicide attack in Kashmir in 2000. The British government officially concluded that it was very unlikely that British citizens would conduct operations at home--suicide operations. Then, of course, 7/7 happened, and that conclusion collapsed. Which brings me to Major Hasan. We still do not know Major Hasan's exact motivations. Is he mostly an oddball with jihadist tendencies? Is he mostly a jihadist guy who is also an oddball? We do not quite understand the proportions. But the more we know about him, the more interesting his case becomes, and the more I would put it in the jihadist column. Here is a guy who dressed in white the morning when he went to the convenience store, the morning of the massacre. He dressed in white, which is a color associated with martyrdom in Islam. He gave away all his possessions. He told his neighbors that he was going to do God's work. He shouted ``Allahu Akbar.'' He screamed it at the top of his lungs as he conducted this massacre. He posted postings on the internet about suicide bombings. He made inquiries about the killings of innocents, and he also contacted an al-Qaeda--basically, an al-Qaeda apologist in Yemen--a cleric. Taken together, that, I think, adds up to a picture of somebody who is planning, essentially, a sort of jihadist death by cop. Major Hasan raises another issue, which is, if you are somebody with jihadist tendencies, the biggest, the most favorable target for you is the U.S. military. We have had a whole series of cases that I would point to. First of all, Abdul Hakim Mujahid--or Abdul Mujahid Hakim-- a case that has not gotten enough attention yet--was a guy who shot up the Little Rock recruiting center in Arkansas earlier this summer, killing an American soldier and wounding another. By the way, the middle name, Mujahid, it means ``holy warrior.'' It is a very unusual--it is not at all a common Muslim name. The fact that he changed that to make it his middle name, I think is significant. He also traveled to Yemen. He was on the FBI's radar screen, but managed to accumulate weapons, and then conduct an attack on this military center in broad daylight--one case. Another case, of course, is Hasan himself. Another case, of course, is the Fort Dix case. Another case which Chair Harman knows very well is the case in Torrance, California, where a group of guys who got radicalized in prison described themselves as al-Qaeda in California and had plans to attack synagogues during Yom Kippur and U.S. military bases and recruiting stations all around the country. So, just one final thought in the 20 seconds I have left. I think that we may have been a little complacent about the American Muslim community, which, on average, is much better educated than most Americans, has higher incomes, does not live in ghettos. But if you look at--and therefore, looks very different from their European Muslim counterparts. But if you look at Najibullah Zazi, who is basically, you know, a guy driving a shuttle bus at Denver airport, or the Somali-Americans who come from one of the most disadvantaged American communities, or if you look at Vinas, the guy from Long Island--you know, this is a guy, a high school drop-out. So, the profile of these people looks a bit more similar to the profile we have seen of European Muslims who might be attracted to jihadist ideology, and 30 years ago might have been attracted to some other revolutionary ideology. But militant jihadism is the ideology of the moment that also attaches itself to attacking the United States. [The statement of Mr. Bergen follows:] Prepared Statement of Peter Bergen November 19, 2009 Chair Harman, committee Members, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. My testimony aims to address the evolving threat from al-Qaeda to the homeland, to include the threat from al-Qaeda itself, groups affiliated or allied to al-Qaeda, and those ``homegrown'' militants influenced by al-Qaeda ideas who have no connections to any formal jihadist group. This testimony does not aim to be exhaustive but to cover the most serious cases of recent years and to provide some overall threat assessment. Najibullah Zazi, a lanky Afghan-American man in his mid-twenties, walked into the Beauty Supply Warehouse in Aurora, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, on July 25, 2009, in a visit that was captured on a store video camera. Wearing a baseball cap and pushing a shopping cart down the aisles of the store, Zazi appeared to be just another suburban guy, although not too many suburban guys buy six bottles of Clairoxide hair bleach as Zazi did on this shopping trip. He then returned to the same store a month later where he purchased another dozen bottles of ``Ms. K Liquid,'' which is also a peroxide-based hair bleach. Aware that these were hardly the typical purchases of a heavily-bearded, dark-haired young man, Zazi--who had lived in the States since the age of 14-- kibitzed easily with the counter staff joking that he had to buy such large quantities of hair products because he ``had a lot of girl friends.''\\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ This section draws on my piece in The New Republic, ``The Front,'' October 19, 2009. http://www.tnr.com/article/world/the-front. Also USA v. Najibullah Zazi, Eastern District of New York, Indictment. http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/1063.pdf and Michael Wilson, ``From smiling coffee vendor to terror suspect,'' New York Times, September 25, 2009. http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/ nyregion/26profile.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In fact Zazi, a sometime coffee cart operator on Wall Street, was planning to launch what could have been the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11 using the seemingly innocuous hair bleach to assemble hydrogen peroxide-based bombs, a signature of al- Qaeda plots in the past several years. During early September 2009, at the Homewood Studio Suites in Aurora Zazi mixed and cooked batches of the noxious chemicals in the kitchenette of his motel room. On the night of September 6, as Zazi labored over the stove he made a number of frantic calls to someone who he asked for advice on how to perfect the bombs. Two days later Zazi was on his way to New York in a rented car. By now President Obama was receiving daily briefings about Zazi, sometimes as many as three or four a day.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Anne Kornblut, ``Obama team says Zazi case illustrates balanced approach to terror threat,'' Washington Post, October 6, 2009. http:// www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/05/ AR2009100503989.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Zazi was spotted in downtown Manhattan on Wall Street on the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks just a few blocks from the gaping hole where the World Trade Center had once stood. By then he was under heavy FBI surveillance and 8 days later, after a series of voluntary discussions with Bureau agents, Zazi was arrested. Likely directed at various targets in and around Manhattan, America's leading authority on terrorism, Bruce Hoffman, described Zazi's plan as ``Mumbai-on-the- Hudson.''\\3\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ Interview with Bruce Hoffman, Washington, DC, September 2009. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Zazi appears to have been the first genuine al-Qaeda recruit discovered living in the United States in years. Zazi had travelled to Pakistan in late August 2008 where by his own admission he was given training on explosives from al-Qaeda members in the Pakistani tribal regions along the Afghan border. On Zazi's laptop computer the FBI discovered he had stored pages of handwritten notes about the manufacture and initiation of explosives and the components of various detonators and fusing systems, technical know-how he had picked up at one of al-Qaeda's training facilities in the tribal regions sometime between the late summer of 2008 and January 2009, when he finally returned to the United States. The notations included references to TATP, the explosive used in the London 7/7 bombings.\\4\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ USA vs Najibullah Zazi, Eastern District of New York, 09-CR-663 Memorandum of law in support of the Government's motion for a permanent order of detention (Via IntelWire). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Zazi case was a reminder of al-Qaeda's ability to attract recruits living in America who are ``clean skins'' without previous criminal records or known terrorist associations and who are intimately familiar with the West. Similarly, Bryant Neal Vinas, a twenty- something Hispanic-American convert to Islam from Queens, New York traveled to Pakistan's tribal areas in the summer of 2008, where he attended al-Qaeda training courses on explosives and handling weapons such as Rocket Propelled Grenades, lessons that he put to good use when he participated in a rocket attack on an American base in Afghanistan in September 2008.\\5\\ Vinas was captured in Pakistan the same month and was turned over to the FBI.* He told his interrogators that he had provided al-Qaeda members details about the Long Island Rail Road commuter train system, which the terror group had some kind of at least notional plan to attack.\\6\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ USA vs Bryant Neal Vinas, Eastern District Court of New York 08-CR-823. http://intelfiles.egoplex.com/2009-07-22-Bryant-Neal-Vinas- Court-Docs.pdf. He pled guilty on January 28, 2009 to the charges against him. * The fact that 7 years after 9/11 a kid from Long Island managed to waltz into an al-Qaeda training camp, a feat that no American spy had done, despite the some $40 billion that the United States spends a year on its intelligence agencies, says a great deal about how the U.S. intelligence community actually works. \\6\\ William K. Rashbaum and Souad Mekhennet, ``L.I. man helped al Qaeda, the informed,'' New York Times, July 22, 2009. http:// www.nytimes.com/2009/07/23/nyregion/23terror.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Surprisingly, even almost a decade after 9/11 a number of Americans bent on jihad managed to travel to al-Qaeda's headquarters in the tribal regions of Pakistan. In addition to Zazi and Vinas, David Headley, an American of Pakistani descent living in Chicago--who had legally changed his name from Daood Gilani in 2006 to avoid suspicion when he traveled abroad--also allegedly had significant dealings with terrorists based in Pakistan's tribal areas.\\7\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\7\\ Headley information comes from United States vs. David C. Headley, Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, Affidavit in Support of Criminal Complaint. http://media1.suntimes.com/multimedia/ headley%20complaint.pdf_20091027_09_57_00_15. imageContent. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sometime in 2008 Headley hatched a plan to attack the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten which 3 years earlier had published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that were deemed to be offensive by many Muslims. In a message to a Pakistan-based Yahoo group on October 29, 2008 Headley wrote, ``Call me old fashioned but I feel disposed towards violence for the offending parties.'' The cartoons of the Prophet have been a particular obsession of al- Qaeda. In March 2008 bin Laden publicly denounced the publication of the cartoons as a ``catastrophe'' for which punishment would soon be meted out. Three months later, an al-Qaeda suicide attacker bombed the Danish Embassy in Islamabad, killing six. For al-Qaeda and allied groups the Danish cartoon controversy has assumed some of the same importance that Salman Rushdie's fictional writings about the Prophet had for Khomeini's Iran two decades earlier. In January 2009 Headley traveled to Copenhagen, where he reconnoitered the Jyllands-Posten newspaper on the pretext that he ran an immigration business that was looking to place some advertising in the paper. In coded correspondence with militants in Pakistan Headley referred to his plot to take revenge for the offensive cartoons as the ``Mickey Mouse project.'' On one of his email accounts Headley listed a set of procedures for the project that included, ``Route Design,'' ``Counter Surveillance'' and ``Security.'' Following his trip to Denmark Headley met with Ilyas Kashmiri in the Pakistani tribal regions to brief him on his findings. Kashmiri is one of the most prominent militant leaders in Pakistan and runs a terrorist organization, Harakat-ul Jihad Islami, closely tied to al- Qaeda. Headley returned to Chicago in mid-June 2009 and was arrested there 3 months later as he was preparing to leave for Pakistan again. He told investigators that he was planning to kill the Jyllands- Posten's cultural editor Flemming Rose who had first commissioned the cartoons as well as the cartoonist Kurt Westergaard who had drawn the one he found most offensive; the Prophet Mohammed with a bomb concealed in his turban. Headley said that he also cased a synagogue near the Jyllands- Posten newspaper headquarters at the direction of a member of Lashkar- e-Taiba in Pakistan, the same group that had carried out the Mumbai attacks that killed some 165 people in late November 2008. The Lashkar- e-Taiba militant Headley was in contact with mistakenly believed that the newspaper's cultural editor was Jewish. When he was arrested Headley had a book entitled ``How to Pray Like a Jew'' in his luggage and a memory stick containing a video of a close-up shot of the entrance to the Jyllands-Posten newspaper in Copenhagen. Indian authorities are presently examining if Headley also had any role in LeT's 2008 massacre in Mumbai. Reportedly Indian investigators have found that Headley visited a number of the Mumbai locations that were attacked including the Chabad Jewish Center, which was a particular target of LeT's gunmen and would help further explain why Headley had the book about Jewish prayer rituals in his luggage at the time of his arrest.\\8\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\8\\ Vishwa Mohan, ``Headley, Rana may have been part of 26/11 plot,'' Times of India, November 18, 2009. http:// timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Headley-Rana-may-have-been-part-of- 26/11-plot/articleshow/5241252.cms; Visha Mohan, ``India to move for extradition of Headley from US,'' Times of India, November 13, 2009. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-to-move-for-extradition- of-Headley-from-US/articleshow/5224592.cms. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- For many years after 9/11 the United States Government had largely worried about terrorists coming into the country. David Headley is an American exporting the jihad overseas. But he is far from only the only one. According to an as-yet unpublished count by New York University's Center on Law & Security, 25 American citizens or residents have been charged with travelling to an overseas training camp or war zone since 9/11: Two who trained with the Taliban, seven who trained with al- Qaeda; ten who trained with the Pakistani terrorist group Lashkar-e- Taiba; four with the Somali al-Qaeda affiliate, Al Shabab, and three who have trained with some unspecified jihadist outfit in Pakistan. (The actual number of Americans who have travelled overseas for jihad since 9/11 is significantly more than 25 as not everyone who does so ends up being charged or convicted of a crime.) In September 2009 the Somali Islamist insurgent group Al Shabab formally pledged allegiance to bin Laden following a 2-year period in which it had recruited Somali-Americans and other U.S. Muslims to fight in the war in Somalia. Six months earlier bin Laden had given his own imprimatur to the Somali jihad in an audiotape released titled ``Fight On, Champions of Somalia.''\\9\\ Many of Al Shabab's recruits from the States hailed from Minnesota where the largest number of the some 200,000 Somali-Americans in the United States is concentrated. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\9\\ ``Fight on, champions of Somalia,'' Osama bin Laden tape, translated by NEFA Foundation, March 19, 2009. http:// www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/nefaubl0309-2.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In 2006 with American encouragement and support Ethiopia, a predominantly Christian country, invaded Somalia, an overwhelmingly Muslim nation, to overthrow the Islamist government there known as the Islamic Courts Union (ICU). While far from ideal the ICU was the first government in two decades to have brought some measure of stability to the failed Somali state but its rumored links to al-Qaeda-like groups had put it in the Bush administration's crosshairs. Perhaps two dozen Somali-Americans, motivated by a combination of nationalist pride and religious zeal, traveled to Somalia in 2007 and 2008 to fight the Ethiopian occupation. Most of them associated themselves with Al Shabab--``the youth'' in Arabic--the insurgent group that would later proclaim itself to be an al-Qaeda affiliate. Al Shabab managed to plant al-Qaeda-like ideas into the heads of even its American recruits. Shirwa Ahmed grew up in Portland and Minneapolis. After graduating high school in 2003 he worked pushing airline passengers in wheel chairs at Minneapolis Airport and delivered packages for a medical supplies company. FBI director Robert Mueller said that some time during this period Ahmed was ``radicalized in his hometown in Minnesota.'' The exact mechanisms of that radicalization are still murky but in late 2007 Ahmed travelled to Somalia. A year later, on October 29, 2008 Ahmed drove a car loaded with explosives towards a government compound in Puntland, northern Somalia blowing himself up and killing as many as 30. He was the first American suicide attacker anywhere. It's possible that 18-year-old Omar Mohamud of Seattle was the second. On September 17, 2009 two stolen United Nations vehicles loaded with bombs blew up at Mogadishu airport killing more than a dozen peacekeepers of the African Union. The FBI is investigating if Mohamud was one of the bombers.\\10\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\10\\ Spencer Hsu and Carrie Johnson, ``Somali Americans recruited by extremists,'' Washington Post, March 11, 2009. http:// www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/10/ AR2009031003901.html; ``FBI investigating Seattleite in suicide bombing,'' Associated Press, September 25, 2009. http:// www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33025395/ns/world_news-terrorism/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Al Shabab prominently featured its American recruits in its propaganda operations, releasing two videos in 2009 starring Abu Mansoor al Amriki (``the father of Mansoor, the American'') who is in fact Omar Hammani, a 25-year-old from Alabama who was raised as a Baptist before converting to Islam while he was at high school. In the video Amriki delivered an eloquent rejoinder to President Obama's speech in Cairo a month earlier in which he had extended an olive branch to the Muslim world. Mansoor addressed himself to Obama in a flat American accent: ``How dare you send greetings to the Muslim world while thousands of Muslims are being detained in your facilities. And how dare you send greetings to the Muslim world while you are bombing our brothers and sisters in Afghanistan. And how dare you send greetings to Muslims while you are supporting Israel, the most vicious and evil nation of the modern era.'' Another Al Shabab video from 2009 showed al Amriki preparing an ambush against Ethiopian forces and featured English rap lyrics intercut with scenes of his rag-tag band traipsing through the African bush.\\11\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\11\\ IntelCenter, transcript of al Shabaab video from Abu Mansoor al Amiriki, ``A response to Barack Obama's speech in Cairo,'' July 9, 2009. http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/ nefa_abumansoor0709.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The chances of getting killed in the Somalia were quite high for the couple of dozen or so Americans who volunteered to fight there; in addition to the two men who conducted suicide operations, six other Somali-Americans aged between 18 and 30 were killed in Somalia between 2007 and 2009 as well as Ruben Shumpert, an African-American convert to Islam from Seattle.\\12\\ Given the high death rate of the Americans fighting in Somalia and also the considerable attention that this group has received from the FBI it is quite unlikely that American veterans of the Somali war pose much of a threat to the United States itself. It is however plausible now that Al Shabab has declared itself to be an al-Qaeda affiliate that the group might recruit U.S. citizens to engage in anti-American operations overseas. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ Spencer Hsu, ``Concern grows over recruitment of Somali Americans by Islamists,'' Washington Post, October 4, 2009. http:// www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/03/ AR2009100302901.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The fact that American citizens had engaged in suicide operations in Somalia raises the possibility that suicide operations could start taking place in the United States itself; to discount this possibility would be to ignore the lessons of the British experience. On April 30, 2003, two Britons of Pakistani descent walked into Mike's Place, a jazz club near the American Embassy in Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital. Once inside one of the men succeeded in detonating a bomb, killing himself and three bystanders, while the other man fled the scene.\\13\\ Similarly, Birmingham-born Mohammed Bilal blew himself up outside an army barracks in Indian-held Kashmir in December 2000, killing six Indian soldiers and three Kashmiri students, becoming the first British suicide bomber.\\14\\ Despite these suicide attacks the British security services had concluded after 9/11 that suicide bombings would not be much of a concern in the United Kingdom itself. Then came the four suicide attackers in London on July 7, 2005, which ended that complacent attitude. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\13\\ Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Details of April 30, 2003 Tel Aviv suicide bombing, dated June 3, 2003. http://www.mfa.gov.il/ MFA/Government/Communiques/2003/ Details+of+April+30+2003+Tel+Aviv+suicide+bombing.htm. \\14\\ Emma Brockes, ``British man named as bomber who killed 10,'' The Guardian, December 28, 2000. http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2000/dec/ 28/india.kashmir. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The case of Major Nidal Malik Hasan, a Palestinian-American medical officer and a rigidly observant Muslim who made no secret of his opposition to America's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and went on a shooting spree at the giant army base at Fort Hood, Texas on November 5, 2009 killing 13 and wounding many more, seems to have been an attempted suicide operation in which Hassan planned a jihadist ``death- by-cop.'' In the year before his killing spree Major Hasan had made web postings about suicide operations and the theological justification for the deaths of innocents and was in touch via email with a cleric in Yemen who is an al-Qaeda apologist.\\15\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\15\\ Sudarsan Raghavan, ``Cleric says he was confidant to Hasan,'' Washington Post, November 16, 2009. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2009/11/15/AR2009111503160_pf.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Early on the morning of the massacre, the deadliest ever on a U.S. military base, Major Hasan was filmed at a convenience store buying his regular snack dressed in white flowing robes.

Neighbor Lenna Brown recalled, ``I asked him where are you going, and he said Afghanistan.'' Asked how he felt about that, Major Hasan paused before answering: ``I am going to do God's work.'' He gave Brown a Koran before he left for what he believed to be his last day on earth.\\17\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\17\\ Scott Shane and James Dao, ``Investigators study tangle of clues on Fort Hood suspect,'' New York Times, November 14, 2009. http:/ /www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/us/15hasan.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As he opened fire in a room full of fellow soldiers who were filling out paperwork for their deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq, Hasan shouted at the top of his lungs Allah Akbar!

But while Hasan was undoubtedly something of an oddball, in what he assumed to be his final days he seems to have conceived of himself as a holy warrior intent on martyrdom. Hasan survived being shot by a police officer and was put in intensive care in a hospital in San Antonio, Texas. After he woke up he found himself not in Paradise but paralyzed from the waist down and being interrogated by investigators to whom he has so far divulged nothing about the motivations for his rampage. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\19\\ Joseph Rhee, ``Accused Fort Hood shooter was a regular at shooting range, strip club,'' ABC News, November 16, 2009. http:// abcnews.go.com/Blotter/accused-fort-hood-shooter-nidal-hasan-visited- strip/story?id=9090116. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- For Americans fired up by jihadist ideology, U.S. soldiers fighting two wars in Muslim countries were particularly inviting targets. Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, an African-American convert to Islam, shot up a U.S. military recruiting station in Little Rock, Arkansas a few months before Hasan's murderous spree, killing an American soldier and wounding another. Despite the fact that the FBI had had him under surveillance following a mysterious trip that he had recently taken to Yemen, Muhammad was able to acquire guns and attack the recruiting station in broad daylight. When Muhammad was arrested in his vehicle police found a rifle with a laser sight, a revolver, ammunition, and the makings of Molotov cocktails.\\20\\ (The middle name that Muhammad assumed after his conversion to Islam, Mujahid or ``holy warrior,'' should have been a red flag, as this is a far from a common name among Muslims.) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\20\\ District Court of Little Rock, Arkansas, County of Pulaski, Affidavit for Search and Seizure Warrant. http:// www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/988.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A group of some half dozen American citizens and residents of the small town of Willow Creek, North Carolina led by a charismatic convert to Islam, Daniel Boyd, who had fought in the jihad in Afghanistan against the Soviets, are also alleged to have had some kind of plan to attack American soldiers. Starting in 2008 Boyd purchased eight rifles and a revolver and members of his group did paramilitary training on two occasions in the summer of 2009. According to Federal prosecutors, members of Boyd's cell conceived of themselves as potential participants in overseas jihads from Israel to Pakistan. And Boyd obtained maps of Quantico Marine Base in Virginia, which he cased for a possible attack on June 12, 2009. He also allegedly possessed armor- piercing ammunition saying it was ``to attack Americans'' and said that one of his weapons would be used ``for the base,'' an apparent reference to the Quantico facility.\\21\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\21\\ USA vs Daniel Patrick Boyd et al Indictment in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, filed 7/22/09 http:// www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/1029.pdf; and the superseding indictment in the same case dated September 24, 2009. http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/1075.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Similarly, in 2007 a group of observant Muslims, a mix of Albanians, a Turk and a Palestinian, living in southern New Jersey angered by the Iraq War told a Government informant they had a plan to kill soldiers stationed at the Ft. Dix Army Base. One of the group made an amateur mistake when he went to a Circuit City store and asked for a video to be transferred to DVD. On the DVD a number of young men were shown shooting assault weapons and shouting Allah Akbar! during a January 2006 training session.\\22\\ An alarmed clerk at the Circuit City store alerted his superiors and quickly the FBI became involved in the case and an informant was inserted inside the group. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\22\\ Much of this information comes from the NEFA Foundation report, ``Fort Dix Plot,'' January 2008. http://www.nefafoundation.org/ miscellaneous/fortdixplot.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- One of the plotters, Serdar Tatar, knew the base well because he made deliveries there from his family's pizza parlor, Super Mario's Pizza. The Fort Dix plotters assembled a number of rifles and pistols and regularly conducted firearms training in the Pocono mountains of Pennsylvania and also went on paintball trips together, a common form of bonding for jihadist militants. The plotters also looked into purchasing an array of automatic weapons.\\23\\ And on August 11 2006 the ringleader, Mohamad Shnewer, conducted surveillance of the Ft. Dix base telling the Government informant: ``This is exactly what we are looking for. You hit four, five, six Humvees and light the whole place [up] and retreat completely without any losses.''\\24\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\23\\ USA vs Mohhamad Ibrahim Shnewer, Dritan Duka, Eljvir Duka, Shain Duka, Sedrdar Tatar U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, Criminal No 07-459. http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/ case_docs/564.pdf. \\24\\ USA vs Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer Criminal Complaint U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey filed May 7, 2007, page 11. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Another group that planned to attack U.S. military installations was led by Kevin Lamar James, an African-American convert to Islam who formed a group dedicated to holy war while he was jailed in California's Folsom prison during the late 1990s. James, who viewed his outfit as ``al-Qaeda in California,'' cooked up a plan to recruit five people, in particular those without criminal records, to help him with his plans. One of his recruits had a job at Los Angeles Airport (LAX), which James thought could be useful. In a list he made of potential targets James listed LAX, the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles, a U.S. Army base in Manhattan Beach and ``Army recruiting centers throughout the country.''\\25\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\25\\ USA vs Kevin James et al U.S. District Court for the Central District of California Case No. CR 05-214-CJC and exhibits. http:// www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/1089.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- James' crew planned to attack a U.S. military recruiting station in Los Angeles on the fourth anniversary of 9/11 as well as a synagogue a month later during Yom Kippur, the most solemn of Jewish holidays. They financed their activities by sticking up gas stations and their plans only came to light during the course of a routine investigation of a gas station robbery by police in Torrance, California who found documents that laid out their plans for jihadist mayhem. The constellation of terrorism cases that surfaced during the second Bush term and during Obama's first year in office suggests that a small minority of Americans Muslims are not immune to the al-Qaeda ideological virus. And quite a number of those terrorism cases were more operational than aspirational, unlike many of the domestic terror cases that had preceded them following 9/11. The jihadists in these cases were not just talking about violent acts to a government informant but had actually traveled to an al-Qaeda training camp; had fought in an overseas jihad; had purchased guns or explosives; were casing targets, and in a couple of the cases, had actually killed Americans. The cases in the past few years have also presented an interesting mix of purely ``homegrown'' militants who are essentially lone wolves like Major Hasan and Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad, who nonetheless both were able to pull off deadly attacks against U.S. military targets; ``self-starting'' radicals with no connections to al-Qaeda but inspired by its ideas, like the Torrance cell who posed a serious threat to Jewish and military targets in the United States and whose plans for mass mayhem were, crucially, not driven forward by an informant; homegrown militants opting to fight in an overseas jihad with an al- Qaeda affiliate as the Somali-Americans recruits to Al Shabab have done; militants like David Headley who is alleged to have played an important operational role for the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is acting today with an increasingly al-Qaeda-like agenda, and finally those like Zazi and Vinas who managed to plug directly into al- Qaeda central. According to the forthcoming study by New York University's Center on Law & Security since 9/11 the Government has charged or convicted at least 20 Americans and foreigners who have direct connections to al- Qaeda and were conspiring with the group to carry out some type of attack; a further nine have attended one of al-Qaeda's training camps but did not have an operational terrorist plan, and a further two dozen ``homegrown'' militants aspired to help al-Qaeda in some other way but were either ensnared by a Government informant or simply failed to connect with the group because of their own incompetence. This raises the question of what kind of exact threat to the homeland is posed by this cohort of militants who run the gamut from incompetent ``homegrowns'' to American citizens who have been trained by al-Qaeda itself? If the Government's allegations are correct and Zazi had managed to carry out his plans, he could have killed scores of Americans as his plan looks similar to that of the al-Qaeda-directed bombers in London who killed 52 commuters on July 7, 2005 with the same kind of hydrogen peroxide-based bombs that Zazi was assembling in his Denver motel room. But the Zazi case also represents the outer limit of al-Qaeda's capabilities in the United States today. Some have suggested that the reason that al-Qaeda has not attacked the United States again is because the group is waiting to match or top the 9/11 attacks. Michael Scheuer, the former head of CIA's bin Laden unit, has said that, ``They're not interested in an attack that is the same size as the last one.''\\26\\ This proposition cannot be readily tested, as the absence of a 9/11-scale attack on the United States is, in this view, supposedly just more evidence for the assertion that al- Qaeda is planning something on the scale of 9/11 or larger. In fact, the Zazi case forcefully demonstrates that al-Qaeda is not waiting to launch ``the big one'' but is content to get any kind of terrorist operation going in the United States, even a relatively small-bore attack. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\26\\ Joel Roberts, CBS News, June 18, 2006. http://www.cbsnews.com/ stories/2006/06/18/terror/main1726666.shtml. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Indeed, it is my assessment that the al-Qaeda organization today no longer poses a direct National security threat to the United States itself, but rather poses a second-order threat in which the worst case scenario would be an al-Qaeda-trained or -inspired terrorist managing to pull off an attack on the scale of something in between the 1993 Trade Center attack, which killed six, and the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995, which killed 168. While this, of course, would be tragic, it would not constitute a mass casualty attack sufficiently large in scale to reorient American national security policy completely as the 9/11 attacks did. An important element in al-Qaeda's much degraded capability to launch a mass casualty attack on the American homeland is the pressure it is under in Pakistan; including ramped-up U.S. drone attacks in the Pakistani tribal regions where the group is headquartered; far better intelligence on the militants based in those tribal areas, and increasingly negative Pakistani public and governmental attitudes towards militant jihadist groups based in Pakistan. There are, however, three important caveats on the success of the drone operations: First, the Afghan-American Najibullah Zazi was still able to receive training on explosives from al-Qaeda in the tribal regions of Pakistan during the fall of 2009 after the drone program had been dramatically ramped up there. Second, militant organizations like al-Qaeda are not like an organized crime family, which can be put out of business if most or all of the members of the family are captured or killed. Al-Qaeda has sustained and can continue to sustain enormous blows that would put other organizations out of business because the members of the group firmly believe that they are doing God's work and tactical setbacks do not matter in the short run. Third, it is highly unlikely that the drone program will be expanded outside of the tribal regions into other areas of Pakistan because of intense Pakistani opposition to such a move. Understanding that fact, some militants have undoubtedly moved into safer parts of Pakistan. The threat posed by al-Qaeda to American interests and allies overseas continues to be somewhat high. Despite all the pressure placed on al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan since 9/11, training has continued in Pakistan's tribal areas and is the common link between the terrorist group's ``successes'' and its near-misses since then; for instance, the deadliest terrorist attack in British history--the four suicide bombings on London's transportation system on July 7, 2005--was directed by al-Qaeda from the tribal regions. The four bombs that detonated in London on what became known as 7/7 were all hydrogen peroxide-based devices. This has become something of a signature of plots that have a connection to Pakistani training camps. Two weeks after the 7/7 attacks on July 21, 2005 there was a second wave of hydrogen peroxide-based bombs set off in London, this one organized by a cell of Somali and Eritrean men who were first- generation immigrants to the United Kingdom. Luckily the bombs were ineffective. Hydrogen peroxide-based bombs would again be the signature of a cell of British Pakistanis who plotted to bring down seven passenger jets flying to the United States and Canada from the United Kingdom during the summer of 2006. The plotters distilled hydrogen peroxide to manufacture liquid explosives, which they assembled in an apartment- turned-bomb factory in East London. The case resulted in the immediate ban of all carry-on liquids and gels, and rules were later put in place to limit the amounts of these items that travelers could bring on planes. The ``planes plot'' conspirators were arrested in August 2006 and in subsequent congressional testimony Lieutenant General Michael Maples, the head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, said the plot was ``directed by al-Qaeda leadership in Pakistan.''\\27\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\27\\ Michael Maples, ``Current and Projected National Security Threats to the United States,'' Statement for the record, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, January 11, 2007. http://www.dia.mil/ publicaffairs/Testimonies/statement26.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the trial of the eight men accused in the ``planes plot'' the prosecution argued that some 1,500 passengers would have died if all seven planes had been brought down. The plot, which was entering its final stages in the summer of 2006, seemed designed to ``celebrate'' the upcoming fifth anniversary of 9/11 by once again targeting commercial aviation, another particular obsession of al- Qaeda. Most of the victims of the attacks would have been Americans, Britons, and Canadians. The seriousness of the intent of the plotters can be seen in the fact that six of them made ``martyrdom'' videotapes recovered by British investigators. At their trial prosecutors played the video made by the ringleader, 25-year-old Abdullah Ahmed Ali. Against a backdrop of a black flag adorned with flowing Arabic script and dressed in a Palestinian-style black-and-white checkered head scarf. Ali lectured into the camera, ``Sheikh Osama warned you many times to leave our lands or you will be destroyed. Now the time has come for you to be destroyed.''\\28\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\28\\ Cahal Milmo, ``You will be destroyed: bombers convicted of Heathrow plot,'' The Independent, September 9, 2008. http:// www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/you-will-be-destroyed-bombers- convicted-of-heathrow-plot-923467.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In September Ali and two of his co-conspirators were found guilty of planning to blow up the transatlantic airliners. Some of the key evidence against them was emails they had exchanged with their handler in Pakistan Rashid Rauf, a British citizen who has worked closely with al-Qaeda, who ordered them ``to get a move on'' with their operation in an email he sent them on July 25, 2006.\\29\\ Those emails were intercepted by American spy agencies which led to the arrests of Ali and his cell. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\29\\ Henry Chu and Sebastian Rotella, ``Three Britons convicted of plot to blow up planes,'' Los Angeles Times, September 8, 2009. http:// www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-britain-verdict8- 2009sep08,0,7134412,full.story. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pakistan's tribal regions have continued to attract Westerners intent on inflicting jihadist mayhem against American targets, like the two Germans and a Turk residing in Germany who were planning to bomb the massive U.S. Ramstein airbase there in 2007. Before their arrests, the men had obtained 1,600 pounds of industrial strength hydrogen peroxide, enough to make a number of large bombs. Today the al-Qaeda the organization continues to pose a substantial threat to U.S. interests overseas and could still pull off an attack that would kill hundreds of Americans as was the plan during the ``planes plot'' of 2006. No Western country is more threatened by al- Qaeda than the United Kingdom, although a spate of arrests and successful prosecutions over the past 4 years have degraded the terrorist's group's capability in the United Kingdom. Despite the relatively serious terror cases emerging in the United States in 2008 and 2009 America did not have a jihadist terrorism problem anywhere on the scale of Britain where an al-Qaeda-directed cell had launched the deadliest terrorist attack in British history in 2005, and where 4 years later British intelligence had identified as many as 2,000 citizens or residents who posed a ``serious'' threat to security, many of whom were linked to al-Qaeda, in a country with only a fifth of the population of the United States.\\30\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\30\\ Michael Evans, ``MI5's spymaster Jonathan Evans comes out of the shadows,'' Times of London, January 7, 2009. http:// www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article5462528.ece. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Why is the threat from al-Qaeda lower in the United States than it is in the United Kingdom? There is little doubt that some of the measures the Bush administration and Congress took after 9/11 made Americans safer. First, the Patriot Act accomplished something quite important, which was to break down the legal ``wall'' that had been blocking the flow of information between the CIA and the FBI. Second, the creation of the National Counter Terrorism Center led to various Government agencies sharing data and analyzing it under one roof. (Although it should be noted that the center was the brainchild of the 9/11 Commission--whose establishment the Bush administration fought tooth-and-nail for more than a year.) Third, it became much harder for terrorists to get into the country thanks to no-fly lists. Before 9/11 the total number of suspected terrorists banned from air travel totaled just 16 names; while 6 years later there were at least 44,000.\\31\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\31\\ CBS 60 Minutes, October 8, 2006. http://www.cbsnews.com/ stories/2006/10/05/60minutes/main2066624.shtml. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The most dramatic instance of how the no-fly list prevented potential terrorists from arriving in the United States was the case of Raed al Banna--a 32-year-old Jordanian English-speaking lawyer who was denied entry at Chicago's O'Hare airport on 14 June 2003 because border officials detected ``multiple terrorist risk factors.'' A year and half later al Banna conducted a suicide bombing in Hilla, Iraq on 28 February 2005 that killed 132 people--his fingerprints were found on the severed hand chained to the steering wheel of his bomb-filled truck.\\32\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\32\\ Scott Shane and Lowell Bergman, ``Adding up the ounces of prevention,'' New York Times, September 10, 2006. http:// www.nytimes.com/2006/09/10/weekinreview/10shane.html; Scott Macleod, ``A jihadist's tale,'' Time, March 28, 2005. http://www.time.com/time/ magazine/article/0,9171,1042473,00.html; Charlotte Buchen, ``The man turned away,'' PBS Frontline, ``The Enemy Within,'' http://www.pbs.org/ wgbh/pages/frontline/enemywithin/reality/al-banna.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Finally, cooperation between U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies has been generally strong after September 11. For instance, al-Qaeda's 2006 plot to bring down the seven American and Canadian airliners was disrupted by the joint work of U.S., British, and Pakistani intelligence services. That said, a key reason the United States escaped a serious terrorist attack has little to do with either the Bush or Obama administrations. In sharp contrast to Muslim populations in European countries like Britain--where al-Qaeda has found recruits for multiple serious terrorist plots--the American Muslim community has largely rejected the ideological virus of militant Islam. The ``American Dream'' has generally worked well for Muslims in the United States, who are both better-educated and wealthier than the average American. More than a third of Muslim Americans have a graduate degree or better, compared to less than 10% of the population as a whole.\\33\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\33\\ Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, The Next Attack (Macmillan, 2006). P. 119. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- For European Muslims there is no analogous ``British Dream,'' ``French Dream,'' or, needless to say, ``EU Dream.'' None of this is to say that the limited job opportunities and segregation that are the lot of many European Muslims are the causes of terrorism in Europe--only that such conditions may create favorable circumstances in which al- Qaeda can recruit and feed into bin Laden's master narrative that the infidel West is at war with Muslims in some shape or form all around the world. And, in the absence of those conditions militant Islam has never gained much of an American foothold--largely sparing the United States from the scourge of homegrown terrorism. This is fundamentally a testament to American pluralism, not any action of the American Government. An important caveat: Some of the men drawn to jihad in America in recent years looked much like their largely disadvantaged and poorly integrated European Muslim counterparts. The Afghan-American al-Qaeda recruit, Najibullah Zazi, a high school dropout, earned his living as an airport shuttle bus driver; the Somali-American community in the Cedar Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis where some of the young men who volunteered to fight in Somalia had lived, is largely ghettoized. Family incomes there average less than $15,000 a year and the unemployment rate is 17%.\\34\\ Bryant Neal Vinas, the kid from Long Island who volunteered for a suicide mission with al-Qaeda, skipped college, washed out of the U.S. Army after 3 weeks and later became a truck driver, a job he quit for good in 2007.\\35\\ The five men in the Fort Dix cell were all illegal immigrants who supported themselves with construction or delivery jobs. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\34\\ Abdirahman Mukhtar, testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, March 11, 2009. http:// hsgac.senate.gov/public/ index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=c762508c-3694-4894-808a- 229fafb1d8d9. \\35\\ TIME magazine profile by Claire Suddath, July 24, 2009, http:/ /www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1912512,00.html and Michael Powell, ``U.S. recruit reveals how Qaeda trains foreigners,'' New York Times, July 23, 2009. http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/nyregion/ 24terror.html. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Decades ago the anger and disappointments of some of these men might have been funneled into revolutionary anti-American movements like the Weather Underground or Black Panthers.

Ms. Harman. Thank you very much. Dr. Pillar. STATEMENT OF PAUL R. PILLAR, PROFESSOR AND DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES, SECURITY STUDIES PROGRAM, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY Mr. Pillar. Thank you, Madame Chair, and Mr. King and Members of the committee. Although the title of this hearing refers explicitly to al- Qaeda, I take the committee's interest to be terrorist threats in general to the U.S. homeland, which are not solely a matter of al-Qaeda or any other single group. By al-Qaeda, I am talking about al-Qaeda Central. Although there is a widespread tendency to gauge the seriousness of any incident to the extent that we can draw links to someone or something connected to al-Qaeda, the whole notion of links needs to be handled more carefully than it customarily is. Links can and do mean anything from command and control on the one extreme, to the most casual or feckless contacts on the other. They do not themselves indicate where the initiative came from. A key question to consider is why and how individuals become radicalized to the extent that they commit or attempt or even contemplate politically motivated violence. A terrorist group or leader can provide an ideological framework or inspiration, but individual, pre-existing anger or discontent that is sufficiently strong for the blandishments of a terrorist group to have any appeal in the first place, is a necessary ingredient. That predisposition, in turn, can have any or all of several sources--and we have seen some of this in the recent incidents--ranging from personal frustrations to anger over controversial public policies. To the extent that we want to understand U.S. citizens or U.S. persons turning to terrorism against the United States, those are the sources to which we have to look. I would summarize the most important patterns in international terrorism with particular reference to threats to the U.S. homeland in the 8 years since 9/11 with two observations. Madame Chair, you basically touched on this yourself in your opening comments. First, the group that accomplished 9/11, al-Qaeda Central, although still a threat, is less capable of pulling off something of that magnitude than it was in 2001. For that, we have in large part to thank many of the variety of measures that the American people's outrage over 9/11 made possible, politically possible, in a way that was not possible before that event. That includes enhanced defensive security measures here at home, as well as a variety of offensive measures overseas. The other observation is that the broader, violent jihadist movement--of which al-Qaeda Central is a part--is probably at least as large and widespread as it was 8 years ago. Here again, some of our own actions have been major contributors, especially, I must add, the war in Iraq. The overall result of these trends is a more diffuse threat, in which the initiative for violence and attacks comes from more different places than it did a few years ago. It is against this backdrop that we have to view the specter of people here in the United States--including, possibly, U.S. citizens--perpetrating terrorist attacks within the United States. Homegrown perpetrators have certain advantages over outsiders, after all. They do not have to cross the borders, where we have enhanced our security. They do not stand out. In short, they are harder to detect. This does make them more attractive, potential recruits for foreign terrorist groups. But for the same reason, any U.S. persons who do turn to terrorism would present a significant counterterrorist challenge, whether or not they are affiliated with a foreign group. Peter Bergen has already addressed quite well the comparison between the United States and Europe as far as the American Muslim community is concerned. I agree with everything he said. I would just say that, incidents to date here in our country do not add up to a significant homegrown Islamist terrorist problem in the United States, at least not yet. But episodes like the shooting at Fort Hood suggest the possibility of more, and they suggest the sorts of reasons and motivations that could make for more. Finally, I was asked, Madame Chair, to comment on what effect U.S. policies and warfighting have on threats to the United States. Here is basically two points, as well. Some uses of force overseas--including, for example, the firing of missiles from unmanned aircraft in Pakistan--have contributed to the eroding of the organizational capabilities of foreign terrorist groups, and, specifically, al-Qaeda. On the other hand, the use of military force can and does exacerbate the terrorist threat by stoking anger against the United States and U.S. policies, largely because of inevitable collateral damage. We have seen this take place in Pakistan. We have seen it take place in Afghanistan. The same sort of sentiments can arise here in the United States. However one chooses to characterize or label what Nidal Hasan did at Fort Hood, his reported sentiments about America's current overseas wars and how they figure into the action he took, illustrate a phenomenon that we should not be surprised to see more of. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. [The statement of Mr. Pillar follows:] Prepared Statement of Paul R. Pillar 19 November 2009 Thank you for the opportunity to testify to the subcommittee regarding the nature and evolution of the terrorist threat to the U.S. homeland. The title of the hearing refers to a single terrorist group, al-Qaeda, but it is important to place the threat from that group within a larger context that includes other radical Islamist cells and individuals--some that may have already gotten into terrorism, and some that may do so in the future--that also constitute portions of that threat. Many of those cells and individuals may be motivated by grievances and sentiments that al-Qaeda has sought to exploit. Some may even be sympathetic to some of al-Qaeda's aims. But this does not necessarily mean that their activity has been instigated, organized, or directed by al-Qaeda. There is a widespread tendency to gauge the seriousness with which one ought to view any instance of political violence or attempted violence according to whether or not it is ``linked'' to al-Qaeda, or linked to something or someplace that is in turn linked to al-Qaeda. The existence of such links is taken as an indicator that we ought to be concerned; their absence is taken as reason not to worry, or to worry less. This manner of interpreting incidents or plots is a misleading way of assessing terrorist threats to the U.S. homeland. The whole notion of ``links'' needs to be used with far more care and caution than it customarily is. Links can--and do--mean anything from operational control to the most innocuous and casual contacts that tell us nothing about the impetus for terrorism. Even if a link is firmly established and goes beyond casual contact, it does not by itself tell us from which end of the link the initiative to establish it came. It is appropriate that the committee should reexamine the terrorist threat to the U.S. homeland in light of several incidents or alleged plots that have been in the news in recent months. Such episodes do raise important issues about the nature of that threat. As a private citizen, I cannot add to the factual knowledge about any incident beyond what you already have read in the newspapers. In any event, caution is required in drawing conclusions about larger patterns from individual incidents. We tend to take one incident as a pattern and two as a trend, even if it is not. roots of radicalization With those caveats, one key question to consider is why and how individuals become radicalized to the extent that they commit or attempt, or even contemplate, terrorist violence. A terrorist group or leader may provide an ideology that rationalizes extreme acts and in some cases an organizational structure that facilitates carrying them out. A necessary ingredient, however, is individual pre-existing anger or discontent that is sufficiently strong for the blandishments of a terrorist group to have any appeal in the first place. That predisposition in turn may have any or all of several sources, ranging from frustrating personal circumstances to public policies that incur more widespread ire and controversy. To the extent that people in the United States, including U.S. citizens, are turning onto the malevolent path of terrorism against the United States itself, such sources provide the most important part of the explanation for why they doing so. Even the most adept and aggressively proselytizing foreign terrorist group could not make gains without raw material in the form of disaffected and alienated individuals. And even when a foreign terrorist group, be it al-Qaeda or any other, does manage to get involved, the initiative is as likely as not to come from the individual. Najibullah Zasi--although there is much about his case that is not publicly known and more that we probably will find out in the future--appears to have become radicalized during his days selling coffee and pastries from a cart in lower Manhattan. This was before, not after, he reportedly spent time at a training camp in Pakistan. And of course, one needs a prior motive to do something like trekking to the other side of the globe to attend such a camp. To the extent that a foreign group such as al-Qaeda is having any influence on disaffected Americans, it is less through face-to-face direction or instruction and more through an extreme ideology. Al-Qaeda and in particular the leadership of al-Qaeda, in the persons of bin Ladin and Zawahiri, is today less relevant to the security of the U.S. homeland as a source of operational instigation, direction, and control than as a source of malevolent ideas. major trends The most important patterns in international terrorism, with particular reference to threats to the U.S. homeland, in the 8 years since 9/11 can be summarized in two trends pointing in different directions. The first is that the group that accomplished 9/11, al- Qaeda, is--although still a threat--less capable of pulling off something of that magnitude than it was in 2001. This is possible in large part because of a variety of measures that the outrage of the American public made politically possible in a way that was not possible before 9/11. These include enhanced defensive security measures at home as well as expanded offensive efforts overseas that have eroded al-Qaeda's organizational infrastructure. The other major pattern or trend is that the broader violent jihadist movement of which al-Qaeda is a part is probably at least as large and strong as it was 8 years ago. Here again, some of our own actions have been major contributors. The war in Iraq was one such action. It provided a jihadists' training ground and networking opportunity similar to what the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan had provided two decades earlier. And in the words of the U.S. intelligence community, the war in Iraq became a ``cause celebre'' for radical Islamists. The overall result of these two trends is a terrorist threat that is more diffuse than it was several years ago. The centers of action and initiative for possible attacks, including against the U.S. homeland, are more numerous than they were several years ago. home-grown terrorism Against this backdrop is the specter--raised anew by some of the recent incidents--of people in the United States, including U.S. citizens, in effect adopting some variant of radical Islamism and perpetrating terrorist attacks within the United States. The possibility is worthy of attention, if for no other reason because of the operational advantages and opportunities this represents for terrorists. Home-grown perpetrators have significant advantages over foreign operatives who, like the 9/11 terrorists, come into the country from abroad to commit their deed. The natives do not have to deal with enhanced border control procedures. They do not stand out. They are, in short, harder to detect. And they are more familiar with the territory and with their targets. These operational advantages would make U.S. citizens or residents attractive recruiting targets for foreign terrorist groups hoping to conduct operations within the United States. But for the same operational reasons, any U.S. persons who do become terrorists would present a significant counterterrorist challenge even without having any affiliation with al-Qaeda or some other foreign group. A common and reassuring observation among those who have studied the problem of home-grown terrorism is that the United States is less vulnerable than most European countries to terrorism and other political violence committed by their own Muslim populations. The reason is that American Muslims are better integrated and less ghettoized than their counterparts in Europe. This is true, but ghettoes are not a necessity, and community integration is not a foolproof safeguard, when it comes to individuals or small groups committing what still can be significant acts of violence. Incidents to date cannot be described as yet adding up to a significant home-grown Islamist terrorist problem in the United States. But episodes like the shooting at Fort Hood suggest the possibility of more, and the sort of reasons and motivations that could make for more. And this does not depend on any recruiting successes or training activity by the likes of al-Qaeda. methods of attack The security measures implemented since 9/11 increase the importance of lone individuals or very small groups that may emerge within the United States, relative to the importance of an established foreign terrorist organization such as al-Qaeda. Those security measures have made it harder to conduct a terrorist spectacular like 9/ 11, where the resources, sophistication, and experience of such an organization would be most relevant. The hardening of the civil aviation system in the United States has made it much more difficult to conduct an attack a lot like 9/11. This leaves the many more mundane but less rectifiable vulnerabilities in American society. A disturbing and unavoidable fact is that just about anyone can stage a shoot-'em-up in any of countless public places in the United States. This is low- tech and unsophisticated, but it can cause enough carnage to make a significant impact on the American consciousness. The likely shape of future terrorist methods of attack in the United States is best represented by what happened at Fort Hood, or by the ``D.C. sniper'' episode that traumatized the National capital area a few years ago, an episode about which we were reminded when the principal perpetrator was executed just last week. effects of military operations overseas All of this has implications for the effect, if any, of our own counterterrorist and military operations overseas on the level of threat to the U.S. homeland. Some such operations, including the firing of missiles from unmanned aircraft at individual targets in northwest Pakistan and elsewhere, have contributed to the eroding of the organizational capabilities of foreign terrorist groups and specifically al-Qaeda. To the extent those capabilities are relevant to possible attacks on the U.S. homeland--and for the reasons I mentioned, that relevance is limited--they may have some positive effect on homeland security. Kinetic operations do not diminish the ideological and inspirational role that now is probably the more important contribution that al-Qaeda makes to threats to American security. The larger use of U.S. military force now under discussion is, of course, the counterinsurgency in Afghanistan. Pursuing and expanding that counterinsurgency would not reduce the threat of terrorist attack to the U.S. homeland. The people we are fighting--Afghans loosely grouped under the label ``Taliban''--have no interest in the United States except insofar as we are in Afghanistan and frustrating their objectives there. Their sometime allies in al-Qaeda do not require a piece of physical territory to conceive, plan, prepare, and conduct terrorist operations against western interests. To the extent the group finds a physical haven useful, even a successful counterinsurgency in line with General McChrystal's strategy would still leave such havens available to the group in Pakistan, in the unsecured portions of Afghanistan, or elsewhere. Meanwhile the use of military force can exacerbate the terrorist threat by stoking anger against the United States and U.S. policies, largely because of the inevitable collateral damage. The anger increases the likelihood of people sympathizing with or supporting anti-U.S. terrorism, and in some cases joining or initiating such terrorism themselves. We already have seen such angry anti-Americanism in response to some of the missile strikes, and on a larger scale in response to military operations on the ground in Afghanistan, where previously dominant pro-American opinion has in large part dissipated. An expansion of the counterinsurgency would add resentment against the United States as a perceived occupying power to the anger over collateral damage. We also have already seen such sentiments translate into anti-U.S. violence in Afghanistan in the form of many Afghans who have no liking for Taliban ideology or rule but have taken up arms to oppose American forces. Similar sentiments can have similar effects far from the field of battle, including in the U.S. homeland. Of all the elements of terrorism and counterterrorism that move easily across continents and oceans in a globalized world, emotion-stoking news about controversial policies and events is one of the easiest to move. However one chooses to characterize what Nidal Hasan did at Fort Hood, his reported sentiments about America's current overseas wars and how these sentiments figured into the action he took illustrate a phenomenon that we should not be surprised to see more of, albeit in different forms. The indirect effects of anger and resentment are inherently more difficult to gauge or even to perceive than the direct effects of military action in seizing or securing territory or in killing individual operatives. But this does not mean they are less important in affecting terrorist threats. They are the main reason that in my judgment, expansion and extension of the counterinsurgency in Afghanistan is more likely to increase than to decrease the probability that Americans inside the United States will fall victim to terrorism in the years ahead. Ms. Harman. Thank you very much. Dr. Crenshaw. STATEMENT OF MARTHA CRENSHAW, SENIOR FELLOW, CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND COOPERATION, STANFORD UNIVERSITY Ms. Crenshaw. Thank you. Thank you Chair Harman, Representative King and Members of the subcommittee. I do not disagree profoundly with what my colleagues have said so far. I think that al-Qaeda, although seriously weakened in the past 8 years, poses a serious threat, and that our policies in Afghanistan and Pakistan are going to impact the future of that threat in ways that we do not really know, but that we need to watch very carefully. I base my judgment on two things. One is the organizational capacity of al-Qaeda, and the other is their ideological intentions and their belief system. It is a very simple dichotomy, but still, I think, quite real. Now, in terms of organization, again, I do not disagree with my colleagues, but I will point to what I regard as the all-important middle level of organization in al-Qaeda. Sometimes we treat it as though it were al-Qaeda Central at the top, which may indeed be growing in influence again, and then rank-and-file recruits or volunteers at the bottom, when I see an intermediate level as critically important That intermediate level, to my mind, has two components. One is radical clerics, who, in the cases in Britain, in Denmark, and the United States now, have encouraged, if not recruited, individuals who have a predisposition to be recruited, which is all too important. Second, we do not want to neglect the role of organizations in conflict zones, as in Yemen, Somalia--in Pakistan, Lashkar- e-Taiba, who are real, functioning, structured organizations to which these individuals can make contact, as well. So, it is not just al-Qaeda Central in terms of a leadership and a structured organization, and arenas for training camps. So, the training camps do not have to be in Afghanistan-Pakistan. If they are elsewhere, they will probably be even harder for us to locate, if they are in Yemen or in Somalia. In terms of the intention behind terrorism, as the Chair noted, it is a very important thing to al-Qaeda to be able to recruit in the West. It is a legitimizing device. It may not necessarily matter to them whether they are actually directing what people are doing, or whether they are simply inspiring them to be imitators of what they have already seen. If there are attacks within the West, al-Qaeda at some level will take credit for it. So, they will say there is a connection, even if we do not think--or our intelligence agencies do not think--that there was a connection. If you look at the writings of Abu Musab al-Suri, who was an important ideologue in al-Qaeda, who was captured by our forces in 2005, he lays out a very clear plan for recruiting in the West and points out that, under Western pressure, the only sensible way to keep the al-Qaeda movement going is to encourage small cells to be created in the West. Now, in looking at this kind of relationship, one thing I want to stress, I think, is that, in my view al-Qaeda is not what we would call a social movement. It is often referred to as a movement, and in many ways it is. But to me, just calling it a movement implies that it has a lot of grassroots support. I regard it as more of a transnational secret society composed of clandestine cells around the world. It has very little above-ground support. It has some, but it is very small. So, I think we need to keep in mind that the number of people who are attracted to al-Qaeda or who belong to its organized branches, wherever they are, is actually a very, very small number of people. It may be growing. It is very, very hard for us to tell, because, as I put in my testimony, we cannot count the number of people at recruiting stations. We do not know how many people might be susceptible to recruitment, how many people are out there. But it is important to remember that it is a very small number of people. In terms of the intention behind the use of violence against the West, I will just point to one encouraging dimension, although I have to say that I am not completely encouraged, and that is divisions within the ranks of al-Qaeda ideologues. During the past 8 years, there have been more figures who were affiliated with al-Qaeda breaking ranks and saying they disapprove, either of attacks on civilians or attacks on Muslim civilians, with that qualification. I myself am not sure how much influence these clerics have. In most cases they are clerics or leaders. I am not sure how many people find them credible. But I think we can regard that as sort of a source of very cautious optimism that there may be some splits and fissures within the overall movement that may give us an opportunity for making inroads into the movement and into halting this process of recruitment. However, in my talks with people in counterterrorism agencies in other democratic governments, they feel that the sorts of young people who are susceptible to radicalization do not feel that the more moderate figures are at all credible or exciting or interesting. So, they do not really have much sway with the kind of people that we are particularly concerned about. So, on that note I will stop, and thank you again. [The statement of Dr. Crenshaw follows:] Prepared Statement of Martha Crenshaw November 19, 2009 Chairwoman Harman, Ranking Member McCaul, and distinguished Members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today to discuss al-Qaeda's threat to the homeland. Although al-Qaeda is substantially weaker than it was on the eve of the 9/11 attacks, it still poses an active and immediate threat to the United States and its allies. Uncertainty about future policy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan and its effect on homeland security heightens concern. I have studied terrorism for almost 40 years, and if we look at the big picture of all terrorism over time, most terrorism is local. Targets, audiences, and grievances are local, and for most groups attacking close to home is simpler and easier. Since the late 1960s, anti-American groups have spent most of their time and effort on their home territory, and it was rare for them even to target Americans or American interests abroad, much less mount attacks in the United States. Al-Qaeda is the exception. Transnational reach is central to its identity, and it is organized to carry out this mission. As American military strikes pressure the core leadership in Pakistan, those remaining may grow more desperate to activate supporters in the United States in order to continue the struggle. Local militants may be motivated to act in order to avoid failure and the collapse of the cause. It is likely that al-Qaeda's leaders have given up the idea of a repetition of the destructiveness of 9/11 and would settle for less spectacular but lethal attacks on civilian targets. My statement analyzes al-Qaeda's current organizational capacity and evaluates its intentions toward the United States. what is al-qaeda? Recent estimates place al-Qaeda's strength at around 100 members in Afghanistan and 300 in Pakistan. Others simply say that the numbers are ``below 2,000.'' These varying estimates are misleading, perhaps even meaningless. Al-Qaeda has always been an organization that depended as much on local initiative as on top-down direction, and in the aftermath of 9/11 it has dispersed even more. Its complex organizational structure is something between a centralized hierarchy and a decentralized flat network. It is a flexible and adaptable organization that has survived well beyond the lifespan of most other terrorist organizations. In my view, al-Qaeda is not a global social movement. I offer this observation because defining it as such implies that it is a popular movement with extensive grass-roots support in its constituent communities. I do not think this is the case. Instead it is a web of overlapping conspiracies, often piggy-backing on local conflicts and grievances. In many ways it is a transnational secret society. Clandestine cells are the norm, not rallies and demon"
