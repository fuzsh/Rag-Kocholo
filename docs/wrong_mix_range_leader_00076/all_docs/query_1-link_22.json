Abuses escalated again in early November. The attackers committed other serious abuses such as torture, rape, and looting. More than half a million refugees from West Darfur have fled to Chad since April 2023. As of late October 2023, 75 percent were from El Geneina.",

        "text": "III. Forces and Mobilization in the El-Geneina Conflict\n\nThe abuses documented in this report took place in the context of a conflict in El Geneina between the RSF, its predominantly Arab allied militias, and the Third Front-Tamazuj armed group on the one hand, and the Massalit forces of Governor Abbakar’s Sudanese Alliance and members of the Massalit “self-defense groups,” on the other.\n\nRSF, Militias, Tamazuj\n\nIn many incidents described in this report, the RSF, Tamazuj and allied militias appear to have acted with a common purpose, starting on April 24 and culminating in the attack against the convoy to Ardamata the night of June 14-15 (see Section VI on Climax of the Campaign: June 15 Massacre and its Aftermath).\n\nRapid Support Forces\n\nRSF forces, identified by witnesses through their uniforms and vehicles, were central actors in the coordinated, large-scale attacks on majority-Massalit neighborhoods, in the abuses against civilians, and in the efforts to establish military ascendency and territorial control over El Geneina.\n\nSince its founding, the RSF has recruited overwhelmingly from sections of Darfuri Arab communities. A joint report by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) described the relationship between the RSF and Arab communities in Darfur as “rooted in ethnicity… sustained by common economic, social and political motivations.” The RSF recruits through its officers’ tribal networks and by rewarding with money, cars, and military ranks the traditional Arab leaders who enlisted their kinsmen through the formal tribal hierarchy.\n\nWitnesses on the ground told Human Rights Watch that RSF officers allowed new recruits to go on extended unpaid leave with their RSF uniforms, weapons, and even vehicles, with the result that those recruits could be rapidly mobilized in their area of residence, often alongside local tribal militia.\n\nArab Militias\n\nArab militias appear to have provided the bulk of the manpower in the alliance with the RSF. The mobilization was “all in the hands of Arab leaders,” many of whom also hold ranks within the RSF, a journalist from El Geneina with close ties to the local Arab community told Human Rights Watch. “The RSF does not have [sufficient] manpower in El Geneina or West Darfur in general, but Arabs do,” the journalist said. Aqeel, an activist, said he saw “heavy mobilization and movement of Arab militias, mainly moving ammunition in broad daylight” within El Geneina between April 15 and April 24, before the outbreak of violence in the city.\n\nArab interviewees spoke openly about the widespread involvement of Arab men and “youth”—which in the local context includes teenage boys—in the fighting. Arab tribal leaders, such as Amir Massar Abdelrahman Assil, have also spoken publicly about their involvement in what they described as a “war.” In a press conference in El Geneina on August 21, 2023, Assil denied his forces were aligned with the RSF, describing the events as a purely tribal conflict between the Massalit and Arab communities of El Geneina.\n\nArab tribal militias are not permanent forces, but rather mobilize on an ad hoc basis via tribal channels when the community perceives a threat from outside. In episodes of tribal mobilization, known as Faza’, the Amir or Umda—traditional leaders (see Section XIII on RSF, Tamazuj and Arab Community Leaders in Positions of Command)—contact the Agid (field commanders or war chiefs) representing each of the subsections under the paramount chief, another journalist from El Geneina told Human Rights Watch.\n\nAn Arab militia fighter from al-Jabal neighborhood said each Agid is appointed by members of his tribe at the neighborhood level on the basis of perceived skill and bravery. The Agid, in turn, can mobilize 50-60 men and receives a percentage of the loot, the same journalist said. The fighter said that in al-Jabal neighborhood only, there were 12 groups of Arab militia fighters, each led by its own Agid. An Agid al-ugada (“Agid of the Agids”) commands the Agids.\n\nArmed Arab residents established checkpoints on the edges of their neighborhoods. Three interviewees said Arab tribal leaders urged residents of Arab and mixed neighborhoods that came under attack to fight and defend their houses, and that they armed them. They said the groups included people from other non-Arab groups who were not Massalit.\n\nThird Front-Tamazuj Movement\n\nTamazuj, an armed group (see Section I sub-section on The End of the Al-Bashir Era and the Juba Peace Agreement: 2019 to 2020), was among the forces that participated in the fighting alongside the RSF and militias.\n\nA 2022 UN Panel of Experts report said Tamazuj was made up of fighters from nomadic communities in border areas between Sudan and South Sudan, as well as former Chadian rebels in El Geneina. The Sudan Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), an armed group operating in Southern Kordofan state, denied Tamazuj’s claim that it originated from the SPLM-N, adding to speculation that Tamazuj was a creation of the SAF’s Military Intelligence and Sudan’s security services.\n\nLike other armed groups that signed the Juba Peace Agreement, Tamazuj had close ties with military leaders prior to the outbreak of conflict in April 2023. In an August 2022 visit to El Geneina, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo “Hemedti,” the commander of the RSF, publicly accused the movement of “instigating” violence in the city, vowing to hold them accountable. No action was taken against them, at least not publicly.\n\nIt is unclear when Tamazuj entered an alliance with the RSF, but witnesses, fighters, and human rights monitors all described the movement’s role in key attacks on, and abuses in, majority-Massalit neighborhoods. For instance, two survivors identified Tamazuj commander Musa Angir as directing forces during an attack on a site for displaced persons and as manning a checkpoint littered with bodies (See Section XIII on RSF, Tamazuj and Arab Community Leaders in Positions of Command). Khalil, 35, recognized one man who is a Tamazuj colonel participating in an attack on June 5 in al-Shati where people in RSF uniform and other forces looted homes. On the evening of June 14, two Massalit fighters saw men they identified as Tamazuj commanders at checkpoints within El Geneina where the convoy heading to Ardamata later came under attack.\n\nAqeel, an activist, said there was a heavy presence of Tamazuj on the western side of the Sudanese-Chadian Joint Force headquarters, where the fighting erupted on April 24.\n\nIn August 2023, after most of the events described in this report, Tamazuj formally announced its alliance with the RSF in the war against the SAF. The RSF formally integrated Tamazuj fighters within its ranks, including in El Geneina. A video posted to Telegram by the RSF on September 18, 2023, shows Tamazuj fighters alongside the RSF, with commentary saying that 34,000 fighters from Tamazuj had agreed to join the RSF in El Geneina.\n\nOther Militias and Alleged Foreign Fighters\n\nMultiple witness said they saw gunmen participating in RSF and militia attacks who they believed were not from local Arab tribes, as well as alleged foreign fighters. Some witnesses said fighters who appeared to be non-Arab participated in the attacks alongside RSF and Arab militias, while Arab interviewees said that some non-Arab residents received weapons from Arab tribal leaders. Other witnesses said they believed some militia members were not Sudanese.\n\nFive interviewees said that in some mixed areas of El Geneina, the RSF distributed weapons to residents, including some non-Arab people from the Tamma and Bargo communities who went on to build barricades and checkpoints to protect their neighborhoods. One Arab resident of al-Kifah said checkpoints in her neighborhood were manned by “members of all ethnicities… except Massalit,” which in this case included Arabs, Zaghawa, Bargo, Borno, and Fallata.\n\nSeveral witnesses reported seeing fighters who they believed hailed from French-speaking African countries such as Chad and the Central African Republic. Six interviewees said they encountered perpetrators they believed were from Libya. One interviewee also said he thought some were from the Central African Republic. Researchers were unable to confirm the alleged identity of these fighters.\n\nCoordination\n\nSurvivors of abuses in El Geneina and interviewees who were locally active—senior government officials, political advisers, prominent activists, and journalists—described the significant coordination between the RSF and fighters from Arab militias throughout the conflict. In addition to carrying out military operations and abuses together, these forces jointly manned checkpoints and together ran formal and informal detention sites (see Section VII sub-section on Unlawful Detentions, Inhumane and Degrading Treatment). Eleven interviewees also implicated fighters from Tamazuj in abuses alongside RSF members and Arab militia members and said the RSF provided materiel support to Tamazuj.\n\nFor instance, Muneer, a policeman who was on duty when the violence began on April 24, said he was in the police headquarters, when a force he estimated to be 5,000-strong attacked the neighborhood at noon, using artillery, Dushkas (heavy machine guns), and RPGs. Some of the attackers wore RSF uniforms, while others were armed men in civilian clothing, he said. Muneer recognized the logo of Tamazuj on some uniforms and vehicles.\n\nCoordination expanded well beyond El Geneina itself, all the way to the border with Chad. Among the many checkpoints interviewees said the RSF ran within and on the road out of El Geneina, some were jointly manned with militias. These checkpoints were the sites of widespread abuse, in particular in mid-June.\n\nTwo interviewees described seeing RSF forces entering militia “bases,” and vice versa. Omar, 46, was detained and tortured at the RSF headquarters in El Geneina in July. He told Human Rights Watch he saw vehicles of the Central Reserve Police (CRP) and RSF at the headquarters, as well as armed Arab militiamen and Tamazuj members entering the base to refuel. Mali, 17, said he was detained in a house used jointly by the RSF and its allied militias.\n\nThe UN Panel of Experts found that several Arab tribal leaders from El Geneina met with the RSF leadership in Khartoum in January 2023, and “in exchange for money they recruited members of their communities.”\n\nMassalit Forces\n\nWhen fighting erupted on April 24, the coalition led by the RSF came into conflict with the Massalit forces of Governor Abbakar’s Sudanese Alliance allied with members of self-described Massalit “self-defense groups.” Hundreds more Massalit young men and adolescent boys mobilized when the fighting escalated. They were joined by Massalit individuals with experience with weapons who mobilized on an ethnic basis, including current and former members of military and security institutions (the police, the General Intelligence Service, and the SAF) and of armed groups that were party to the Juba Peace Agreement, including the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the Sudan Liberation Army-Minni Minnawi, two major Darfuri, non-Arab armed groups.\n\nA journalist from El Geneina said he believed the forces of the Sudanese Alliance numbered 1,000 to 2,000 men at most, and the self-defense groups, 500 to 1,000. Hassan, a 62-year-old Massalit man who took up arms in al-Madaress neighborhood, estimated that a total of 1,500 non-Arabs mobilized against the RSF and allied militias. Interviewees said military coordination within the Sudanese Alliance and the self-defense groups was largely informal and ad hoc.\n\nThe newly mobilized Massalit fighters used weapons they looted from the police storage facilities in El Geneina and Ardamata when the conflict broke out. In addition, there are claims that the SAF provided some weapons to Massalit fighters at the start of the attacks.\n\nThese forces were unable to protect the population from the impending campaign of atrocities.\n\nSudanese Alliance\n\nMassalit fighters of the Sudanese Alliance had about 20-25 vehicles in El Geneina at the onset of the conflict, bases in al-Madaress, in the governor’s office, and in the General Secretariat of the Government opposite it, Massalit interviewees said. Yahya, 60, a government adviser and a member of the Sudanese Alliance, said his forces also maintained a presence around the former UNAMID base in al-Jabal neighborhood during the fighting. Adnan, a Sudanese Alliance fighter, was in a base with around 70 fighters across the street from the RSF headquarters in al-Jamarek where, he said, his men were attacked “immediately” on April 24 as clashes broke out between the SAF and the RSF.\n\nSelf-Defense Groups\n\nThough Massalit self-defense groups had formed in majority-Massalit neighborhoods since 2019, the outbreak of fighting and the looting of police weapons led to a sudden wave of additional mobilization.\n\nOn at least two occasions, government arms depots were overrun by predominantly Massalit community members looking for weapons.\n\nMid-morning on April 24, as the initial attacks unfolded in Dunkey 13, al-Jabal, al-Jamarek, and other neighborhoods, youth from the neighborhoods came in waves to the police headquarters around al-Majliss avenue, asking for protection and to be armed. Muneer, the policeman, joined the Massalit self-defense groups. He said the police director general, who commands police forces in the city, was present but did not give orders to respond to the unfolding attacks. Eventually the crowds entered the depots, in circumstances that are disputed. Muneer said people removed Kalashnikov-type rifles, Goryunov machine guns, and ammunition.\n\nA witness and two observers with knowledge of the events said civilians also obtained weapons at a SAF depot in Ardamata. Safa, a women’s rights activist, said:\n\nOn April 26, police commanders told the people in our camp to come to get weapons from their depot in Ardamata. People started to head there. Then I saw hundreds, if not thousands, running toward the camp. They wanted to get weapons, but the police wanted to give weapons to selected groups, so they could register them. Some people tried to break into the SAF garrison, but the SAF shot at them. The SAF started to fire from [armored vehicles] to warn people to stay away. People insisted [they get weapons], and broke into the depot.\n\nResidents of al-Jabal, al-Jamarek, al-Madaress, al-Mansoura, al-Salam, al-Tadhamun, and al-Thawra neighborhoods all said they saw Massalit men, youth, and children, pick up guns around that time to protect their neighborhoods in an ad hoc fashion. Rubab, a teacher, said:\n\nWe were abandoned, so our young men came together to defend us. There were nine attacks on our area, and the young men were able to push them back each time… We were surprised they knew how to defend us.\n\nAn Arab resident of majority-Massalit al-Jamarek described the spread of weapons in her neighborhood from April 24:\n\nFrom that day, if you went out, everyone had a gun. In front of my door, they would sit there… They were covering their faces and had weapons, sometimes machetes, rifles. Most had rifles. Sometimes they had two. And grenades. This was everywhere, everyone had it… There were boys who were like ten years old preparing rifles to try to make them work.\n\nThree individuals, one of whom is a human rights monitor, said that some Massalit forces also possessed RPGs.\n\nIV. Escalating Attacks on Massalit Displacement Sites and Neighborhoods: April 24 to June 14\n\nStarting on April 24 and through mid-June, the RSF and Arab militias led three major waves of attacks on majority-Massalit neighborhoods where Massalit forces were present.\n\nThey deliberately looted and burned down neighborhoods identified as Massalit. They also systematically targeted the sites in the city where internally displaced persons (IDPs)—largely Massalit—and other non-Arab communities were living. They did so on foot and in vehicles, attacking with gunfire, but also with explosive weapons, which increase the risk of unlawful killings and injuries from indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. RSF forces looted and burned down site after site, shooting civilians as they fled.\n\nTargeted areas included long-established IDP camps, where people had moved, following attacks on their communities in the 2000s, as well as the roughly 100 more recently-established IDP “gathering points”—smaller, informal, densely populated sites housing displaced persons within the compounds of schools and government offices. These were located along the A5 road (the main artery that crosses El Geneina from east to west through al-Jabal, al-Jamarek, al-Madaress, al-Majilis, al-Tadhamun, al-Thawra, and al-Zuhur neighborhoods. Since late 2019, tens of thousands of predominantly Massalit community members had gathered at these sites, having fled the large-scale attacks on the Krinding and Abu Zar IDP camps and other locations in the city in 2019 and 2021.\n\nFollowing the initial attacks in late April, almost all these IDP sites along the A5 road were destroyed. New gathering sites emerged, notably in al-Zahra girls’ boarding school and in the alleyways of residential areas, only to be targeted and destroyed in subsequent waves of attacks in May and June (see Section VII box on Al-Zahra girls’ boarding school).\n\nThe events of 2023 described in this report mirrored the previous attacks in El Geneina in 2019 and 2021, and indicate the deliberate targeting of displaced communities in the city. Arab community representatives in 2021 had called for the removal of IDP sites from El Geneina, saying Massalit fighters were living inside them (See Section I on Background).\n\nThe timeline presented in this section draws on witness interviews and on human rights activists’ notes and messages written or exchanged during and after the events.\n\nApril 24 to 28\n\nThe attacks occurred in several phases, the first starting on April 24 and continuing through April 28.\n\nOn April 24, the RSF and allied militias attacked the neighborhoods of al-Jabal, al-Jamarek, al-Madaress, al-Mansoura, and al-Tadhamun, according to witnesses and residents.\n\nAn activist said that on April 24, he collected the bodies of civilians killed earlier in the day inside a gathering site in the government’s Labor Office. With a group of volunteers, he collected 31 bodies, including of 8 women and 4 children, “with gunshot wounds, some to the chest or stomach, some to the legs…” from throughout the building, he said.\n\nOn April 25, there were widespread attacks on at least 5 neighborhoods and 12 IDP camps and sites, three human rights monitors said. Marajan, a 37-year-old man, said that morning he woke to the sound of gunshots and saw RSF and allied Arab militias attack several sites for displaced persons in al-Jamarek. Within minutes, there was a trail of smoke “from the Council of Zakat office and Imam al-Kazem school [to] the Salah al-Din school and all the IDPs gathering sites.”\n\nAisha, 52, said her 20-year-old son and her 30-year-old brother were killed in an attack by the RSF on the Ministry of Education gathering site, where nearly 300 families, including hers, were living at the time. Eight others were said to have been wounded in the attack. This was the first of at least two RSF attacks on that site in the span of two weeks, Aisha said.\n\nFatin, a 40-year-old day worker, survived an attack on Abu Zar camp. Men in RSF uniform and civilian clothes were shouting “Nuba! Nuba! Nuba!”—an ethnic slur—while shooting at children, older people, and women, she said.\n\nAfter targeting the offices of the El Geneina locality administration in al-Majliss, assailants continued onto al-Majliss mosque next door, killing five displaced persons, including one child and one woman, said Jamal Abdallah Khamis, a human rights monitor, whose colleague went to the mosque to document the killings.\n\nYasin Adam Ahmad, a man in his mid-30s, was shot in the neck and killed on April 25, while he and a group of children and women were running by al-Qadima school, which was burning at the time, said Muna, Yasin’s sister-in-law who was with him at the time.\n\nOn April 27, the RSF and allied militias attacked six neighborhoods, targeting at least seven gathering sites. In one, on al-Burhania square, human rights monitor Mansour said he found the bodies of seven men.\n\n“More than 20 RSF [fighters] came in,” said Zainab, 15, who sheltered at what she called the Child Protection gathering point:\n\nWe were seven or so [women and girls] in the room and my father. They started beating my father. My mother said: ‘Don’t beat him!’ They shot my father in the chest and my mother in the throat… They told everyone to leave, and then they burned it [the site].\n\nSatellite imagery corroborates witness accounts and attests to the scale of the destruction. Imagery recorded on April 25 shows the first signs of arson concentrated on an IDP gathering site around al-Farouq school. By April 30, widespread and apparently deliberate fires had affected almost all IDP sites located along and near the A5 road, including the Abu Zar camp.\n\nA video posted to the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) on April 30 and verified by Human Rights Watch shows the aftermath of the burning of the Imam al-Kazem school gathering point, an 8,000 square-meter compound in al-Majliss. Most of the structures on this site have been burned to the ground, and smoke is still visibly rising from the charred remains of what appears to be furniture and other flammable objects. Fire damage is already visible on satellite imagery dated April 28. No damage is visible on satellite imagery dated April 25.\n\nAfter the heavy destruction of these early days, local peace talks led to a ceasefire on May 1, but sporadic attacks continued.\n\nMay 12 to 14\n\nStarting on May 12, there occurred three days of heavy, continuous attacks on neighborhoods and IDP sites, centering on the neighborhoods of al-Jamarek, al-Madaress, and al-Mansoura, which were attacked every day through May 14. The areas of al-Ghabat and al-Jabal were also targeted on May 13.\n\nAqeel, an activist who volunteered at makeshift clinics established after the conflict started, said that on May 12 the clinics received people injured in the RSF and allied militia attacks on the Gilani and al-Hashab camps located in al-Ghabat, as well as bodies of people killed in these attacks. He said he saw 80 injured people arriving from the two camps at the Ingaz clinic, and 27 bodies being brought there. “All [had] gunshot wounds, most in the stomach and back and neck… [they were] mostly young men,” Aqeel said.\n\nSatellite imagery recorded on May 17 shows several IDP sites affected by fire in al-Jamarek. An image from June 29 shows all the sites destroyed by fire. The eastern part of the city was also affected, with several pockets of structures destroyed by fire in Krinding IDP camp.\n\nMay 21 to 27\n\nA lull from May 15 through 20 gave way to renewed large-scale attacks by RSF and militia targeting al-Jamarek on May 21. The forces burned three gathering points and killed people.\n\nBy that time, Massalit fighters from the Sudanese Alliance and the self-defense groups had fallen back to six neighborhoods abutting the A5 road, with the General Secretariat of the Government as their stronghold, according to Jamal Abdallah Khamis, the rights monitor.\n\nOn May 24, assailants carried out another wave of attacks, targeting at least four IDP locations as well as six neighborhoods and the governor’s office, according to monitors. On May 25, they targeted at least three gathering sites and two neighborhood blocks. On May 27, they attacked six neighborhoods.\n\nJune 6 to 14\n\nAfter a quiet spell from May 28, attacks started again on June 6. RSF forces targeted at least six neighborhoods and four IDP sites on June 7.\n\nYousra, 27, described the attack on al-Gandoul center, which was hosting around 200 people, including many Massalit activists and their families. She said 30 RSF fighters entered the building:\n\n[They] started shooting, and beating, and looting. I saw at least 30 people get killed as they were fleeing. They weren’t distinguishing between women, children, men. As they entered, we started [climbing] over the wall. We fled to Zahra [boarding school] gathering point but when we got there, there were mortar attacks coming.\n\nMansour, 23, was also present. He said the attack started in the early morning and was led by Musa Angir, a commander of Tamazuj (see Section XIII sub-section on Tamazuj). Some attackers wore RSF uniforms while others were in plainclothes, covering their faces. “We were attacked from the southeast direction… It was a heavy attack and those who were unable to leave… were killed inside the center,” Mansour said. He knew four activists who were killed on that occasion.\n\nBesides these ground offensives, residents described shelling on gathering sites during the week of June 7 to June 14, including on three IDP sites in schools, including al-Zahra girls’ boarding school (see Section VII box on Al-Zahra girls’ boarding school).\n\nOn June 7-8, attacks resumed on the neighborhoods that had been targeted on May 27, a monitor said. On June 9-10, at least five neighborhoods and one gathering site were attacked. On June 12, four neighborhoods and another gathering site were attacked.\n\nJune 14 saw the culmination of this wave of attacks, leading to the collapse of the defense of nine neighborhoods still held by Massalit armed groups, concomitant with the killing of the governor.\n\nBy the end of June, all the IDP gathering sites had been burned down, with the exception of the new site inside al-Zahra girls’ boarding school, satellite imagery showed.\n\nV. Mass Exodus: June 14\n\nOn June 14, the areas of the town held until then by Massalit armed groups and sheltering the Massalit population in central El Geneina collapsed against an ultimate wave of attacks by the RSF, Tamazuj, and militia forces, enabling these forces to establish control over the city. A mass exodus ensued, starting the morning of June 14 and spiraling after the killing of the governor, Khamis Abbakar, later that day. The RSF and allied forces targeted the crowds trying to flee the city, which were mainly civilian, but in which fighters were also present.\n\nOn the evening of June 14, a dense column, kilometers long, of civilians and fighters from majority non-Arab neighborhoods, attempted a mass exodus toward the suburb of Ardamata to the north where, people hoped, the presence of a SAF garrison would deter further attacks.\n\nProceeding extremely slowly overnight, the convoy came under attack at sunrise on June 15, when the RSF and its allies opened fire from many locations along the crowd’s route. Witnesses described fighters going on a rampage, summarily executing and indiscriminately killing a vast number of civilians. The RSF forces killed and wounded people who were in vehicles, ran over civilians on foot, and shot at hundreds of people who tried to swim across the Kajja, a seasonal river that flows through the city. They chased people through side streets and in places of refuge, killing women, men, and children either as they tried to flee or execution-style.\n\nThroughout June 15 and in the following days, the RSF and allied militias went from house to house in the neighborhoods they newly controlled, allegedly searching for men and weapons, killing and abusing Massalit people, and expelling large groups of vulnerable civilians from their homes. The forces, joined by Arab civilians, continued to pursue civilians along the 20-kilometer-long route to Chad, carrying out further mass killings, beatings, and widespread pillage. Of the 2,600 people who interviewees said they had seen being killed or dead, 547 were killed on June 14 and June 15 alone; and 283 people who interviewees saw being wounded, occurred over these two days.\n\nTens of thousands of people arrived in Adré, Chad, in the days following June 14, including around 1,400 with serious injuries. By July 27, 179,000 new refugees had arrived in Adré, the vast majority from El Geneina.\n\nCollapse of Massalit Defenses\n\nJune 14 marked the culmination of a week in which the RSF and allied militias carried out among the most intense wave of attacks on Massalit-held neighborhoods, witnesses said. That day, attacking forces penetrated nine neighborhoods in the center of El Geneina, attacking the General Secretariat from the south and the southwest. About 250 vehicles were involved in the attacks, including from the RSF, allied militias, and Tamazuj, said a former policeman and fighter from a Massalit self-defense group. After almost running out of ammunition, the Massalit forces were forced to withdraw, another fighter said.\n\n“We suggested attacking the RSF to get ammunition, or opening the road to Chad,” said the coordinator of one of the Massalit self-defense groups. “We talked to the governor, he refused, [saying] he had an agreement with the RSF that neither side [neither the RSF nor the Massalit armed groups] would attack the other.”\n\nThousands of people started to flee that morning. Interviewees said the RSF and allied militias opened fire on fleeing civilians on El Geneina’s western outskirts, on and near the A5 road linking the city to Chad.\n\nMustafa, a civil servant, was among thousands of civilians fleeing through al-Hashab neighborhood in that direction. They were blocked by the heavy buildup of RSF and allied forces along the way. Further west, near the Central Reserve Police (CRP) headquarters, Sudanese Alliance fighters were advising civilians to turn back because of the heavy RSF presence, Mustafa said. Two other witnesses also turned back after hearing reports of shooting by the RSF and allied forces on the city’s western outskirts.\n\nLatifa, a 25-year-old student, was injured by the RSF and allied militias around midday on June 14 in al-Mansoura. She said: “There were so many people in the streets [of al-Hashab area of al-Mansoura], kids, women, old people, men…. Arabs and the RSF… on the road… opened fire on us and shot me in the left foot. I saw 20 people get killed.” On her way to al-Salam while injured, she counted 200 bodies before she stopped counting, Latifa said. Another civilian, 38-year-old Tariq, also said he saw many dead people while running past the RSF headquarters, from where he said forces were firing at civilians.\n\nThe Killing of the Governor\n\nKhamis Abbakar, by virtue of his position as governor of West Darfur and his role as the head of the Sudanese Alliance, was the de facto civilian and military leader in majority-Massalit neighborhoods.\n\nOn June 14, Abbakar was sheltering in the UN International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) compound—evacuated by UN staff weeks earlier—across the street from his office, which had been bombed. “His area was under siege,” said Zeina, a government official. That day, in an interview with al-Hadath TV, Abbakar said: “Civilians now are being killed in a very indiscriminate way and in large numbers… we have a large number of injured people who haven’t found treatment.” He warned that “there [is] nowhere for [the people of El Geneina] to go,” and called on the international community to directly intervene to protect civilians “and save those who are left” from the “genocide in this area.”\n\nInterviewees close to the governor told Human Rights Watch that Abbakar appeared to be holding out hope for negotiations. In the afternoon, he went to the CRP headquarters on the western edges of El Geneina, reportedly to secure the CRP’s support to evacuate the wounded to Chad (see Section XIV on Government Forces’ Inability or Unwillingness to Protect). There, he was detained by the RSF, according to one of his advisers. A video first published on X (formerly known as Twitter) at 6:18 p.m. on June 14, the location of which was confirmed by Human Rights Watch, showed Abbakar in RSF custody at the force’s headquarters and in the presence of the RSF’s West Darfur commander, Gen. Abdel Rahman Joma’a Barakallah.\n\nIn the evening, news started to circulate that Abbakar had been killed. At 10:04 p.m., the first video appeared on a well-known pro-SAF Telegram channel showing a body that appears to be that of Abbakar lying motionless on the ground with visible wounds. Human Rights Watch discovered five different videos uploaded to Telegram and X (formerly known as Twitter) between June 14 and 15 showing what appears to be the body of the governor. In two videos, the governor’s body is dressed and is surrounded by a small number of people. A second body is seen next to the governor, which Human Rights Watch was unable to identify. In two later videos posted to Telegram, Abbakar’s body has been stripped to its underwear. A large crowd is surrounding the body and throwing rocks at it, and also desecrating the body using other forms of mutilation, including slowly driving over it with a white Toyota pick-up truck. Human Rights Watch was not able to determine the location of these videos.\n\nAfter the conflict broke out on April 24, many civilians had found refuge in the strongholds of Massalit armed groups, around the General Secretariat and the governor’s house. Abbakar’s killing left his forces in disarray and civilians feeling even more vulnerable and served as the final trigger of the mass exodus of both the Massalit forces and the Massalit community from the city.\n\nFleeing to Ardamata\n\nOn the evening of June 14, after the governor was killed, dense crowds of people from 13 Massalit-held areas converged on the center of El Geneina around the central road near the General Secretariat and the governor’s house, and in the neighborhoods of al-Ghabat, al-Jamarek, and al-Madaress.\n\nSamir, a Massalit fighter, said he heard that a meeting was held between commanders of the self-defense groups and the Sudanese Alliance, and the commander and members of the SAF unit deployed in central El Geneina, to discuss the way forward. A majority of commanders in the meeting agreed to move their forces and their families to Ardamata, the suburb of El Geneina, seven kilometers northeast from the General Secretariat, that hosted a SAF garrison. Some attendees reportedly objected that the plan was unsafe.\n\nMousa, a lawyer, was in a house roughly 400 meters from the governor’s residence. Around 6 p.m., he heard that the two tanks and three armored personnel carriers stationed nearby were soon to leave. “’Whoever is willing to go, we are leaving at 8 o’clock. You should follow us,’” one of the soldiers said.\n\nWord of the fighters’ decision to move spread through the crowd, witnesses said. A vast number of civilians tagged along for fear of being targeted should they go west to Chad; people hoped the SAF garrison would provide protection. The convoy set off from al-Jamarek and al-Mansoura shortly after sunset.\n\nThe Crowd and its Armed Escort\n\nProceeding overnight, the crowd stretched for kilometers. Witnesses described extremely restricted movement in many places, at times near a standstill, due to the crowd’s density. Movement was also hampered by barricades that had been erected throughout the town since April. Hassan Zakaria Ismail, a nurse, said two armored vehicles from the SAF led the convoy, followed by six “technicals” (pickups mounted with Dushkas or heavy machine guns) from the Massalit armed groups, then three armored vehicles in the middle of the convoy, each cluster separated by crowds of civilians. Fighters from the Sudanese Alliance were reportedly covering the back of the convoy.\n\n“It was the whole of El Geneina. I have never seen something like this,” Mustafa said. There were hundreds of civilian vehicles, Saif, 17, recalled. “Some people carried others on their backs, [some were] on vehicles, some on donkey carts. There was a truck carrying many older people. The rest were [uninjured] civilians, mostly women and children,” Jamal Abdallah Khamis, the rights monitor, said. People pushed injured people in wheelbarrows. Civilians brought along goods—food, valuables, donkeys.\n\nWitnesses estimated the number of people in the crowd at anywhere from over 5,000 people to tens of thousands. “Women [were] losing their children,” Taher, a medical worker, said.\n\nThe vast majority of people were unarmed civilians, but witnesses said there were also many people with guns— at least 1,000, according to Adnan, the Sudanese Alliance fighter, who was carrying his rifle at the time of the events. The weapons were small, “AK47s, M16, and machine guns,” said Saif. Ammunition was in dire supply and “[we] had only enough… to provide coverage for the [unarmed] civilians to pass,” recalled Idris, a retired SAF officer who had joined a Massalit self-defense group.\n\nThe Convoy’s Route Through RSF-controlled Areas\n\nOvernight the convoy moved north through neighborhoods held by the RSF and its allies, amid intense tension and sporadic abuses.\n\nThe column had to cross al-Shati, an ethnically mixed area where many Arab people lived, as well as al-Nasseem and al-Salam, two mostly Arab neighborhoods.\n\nDuring the night the convoy split, with one section, led by the two armored vehicles, heading north along the parallel Ardeba road, and a second cluster of vehicles and six Dushka-mounted “technicals” remained on the A5. In the prevailing confusion, the crowd also split.\n\nThere were many armed Arab forces in both uniform and civilian clothes along the A5 road, witnesses said. “Some [were] up in the houses, including some snipers, and some [were] on the road,” Saif recalled. Along with residents, these forces also stopped people to rob and harass them, in particular between al-Nasseem, al-Shati, and El Geneina Hospital, witnesses said.\n\nVI. Climax of the Campaign: June 15 Massacre and its Aftermath\n\nAmbush and Massacre at Dawn\n\nThe killings began at dawn on June 15, in the middle of El Geneina. The conditions under which the first shots were fired remain unclear. Shooting broke out in the neighborhoods of al-Shati and al-Nasseem, on the A5 road north of El Geneina hospital, along the Kajja river. RSF and Tamazuj forces, accompanied by militias, exchanged fire with the Massalit fighters in the convoy using assault rifles and heavy machine guns. At the same time, they also shot indiscriminately at civilians in the convoy. They forced people into the river where many women and children, under fire, drowned while trying to swim across.\n\nBefore the shooting started, some members of the RSF initially appeared to be trying to screen the passage of people. Two witnesses described RSF checkpoints on the A5 road at al-Shati bridge, where forces stopped the crowd around 5.30 a.m. Mousa recalled:\n\nArmed personnel, some in RSF uniform … said they would allow only women and children to go… We heard [them] say ‘We don’t want any man to go!’… They said they would allow the SAF tanks and the armored vehicles to pass.\n\nHisham, a former government employee, said he was further north on the A5, near the Ministry of Animal Resources, when the road was blocked from the front, the back, and the western side.\n\nIt appears to be at that point that the situation escalated.\n\nKarima, 26, who was in al-Shati just north of El Geneina hospital, said that shooting started after the crowd had stopped moving. Hassan Zakaria Ismail, the nurse, and Khaled, a driver, were near al-Shati graveyard when the attack started. “The six [Dushka-mounted vehicles] were too far in front of us. We had no protection,” Hassan said, “and that’s when Arabs came from al-Nasseem and Um Duwein.”\n\nJamal Abdallah Khamis, a human rights monitor, was also near the graveyard and was taken aback when shots were fired, even as he saw eight RSF personnel in the column apparently trying to separate men and women and to gather weapons. “Collect your arms, collect your arms!” he recalled hearing them say. “We were surprised that a group from the west side and the south side opened fire on us.”\n\nThe situation suddenly turned into an all-out shootout in which assailants shot at fighters and civilians alike.\n\n“Everyone started running, including older people, women, and children,” said Suhaila, a 16-year-old girl who was injured when bullets hit her vehicle. Nurse Hassan said RSF and Arab gunmen came out of places of hiding in houses and near mango trees immediately after the first shots were fired. Adnan, a Sudanese Alliance fighter who was in al-Nasseem, said the forces manning checkpoints started “firing at people escaping from the area.”\n\nThe Massalit fighters shot back. “Both sides were shooting. There was shooting from all over,” said Saif, who was near El Geneina hospital. But “of the people walking in the crowd… [who] had weapons… almost no one had bullets left. They ran out [of ammunition],” Omar recalled, and assailants “started by targeting” them, so they were killed quickly. He said the six Dushka-mounted vehicles in the convoy opened fire at assailants. It appears that the vehicles managed to pass following an exchange of fire.\n\nAmer, 66, a community leader from al-Shati, believed that it was residents of al-Nasseem who were manning the checkpoint near the market by the Ministry of Animal Resources, from which his section of the crowd was shot at:\n\nThey opened random fire on us… many of them with Dushkas… 40 people, civilians, were killed in front of me… women, men and children. And three donkeys, I saw them being killed.”\n\nDalal, 26, a local aid worker, was walking in the column on al-Jamarek road with her family of nine, when they came under fire. Gunmen in civilian dress shot and killed her two brothers, Waleed, 28, and Ahmed, 30, and injured her 59-year-old mother in the right thigh and on the left buttock, she said.\n\nThough people may have been killed in crossfire, witnesses described the large-scale, methodical targeting of civilians by the RSF and allied militias. Assailants opened fire on women and children running, shot people in vehicles at close range, and shot people they had arrested.\n\nA group of assailants on motorbikes, on foot, and in cars shot at close range at the car of Hassan Zakaria Ismail and Khaled, killing 38-year-old medical assistant Maki Khamis, and injuring two other men, one in the back and the other in the right knee. Khaled, the driver, sped away down a side street. “While I was escaping, I saw RSF vehicles running over many people,” he said. “I saw them shoot seven people, men, women, and children. I saw a woman get shot with her baby on her back and they both died.”\n\nMaka, 25, also a nurse, was in another vehicle with nine injured people and three medical staff, further south in the central market, when “RSF and Arabs” surrounded them:\n\nThe armed men made us get out… and started shooting ... at the car. We started to run. They shot one of the injured in front of me. Another, [who] had two broken legs, he couldn’t get out of the vehicle, so he died as it burned.\n\nRSF forces in al-Nasseem attacked the crowded van in which 40-year-old Mubina was travelling, killing around 10 to 15 people in it, including her 3-year-old grandson, who she said was shot in the side and died immediately. Mubina herself was shot in her left hand but escaped to al-Ghabat. “I still had my grandson on my back… When I reached there, I left his body on the ground.”\n\nSixteen-year-old Suhaila was shot in the arm while she was in a car. She said assailants went from vehicle to vehicle, killing passengers:\n\nArmed forces stopped the car in front of us, shot the people inside, and then shot up the vehicle. It was a Landcruiser. I don’t know how many people were inside, but [there were] no fighters, as far as I could see.\n\nThe same with the vehicle behind us: they stopped it and shot the people inside, and then they shot at it with incendiary bullets and that made it go up in flames and burn.\n\nThey came to our vehicle and asked: ‘Is this your vehicle?’ and then they started taking out some of the people [who were] in the car with us. [They] shot some [of them] and were taking others, maybe to arrest them. It was chaos, so we don’t know what happened to everyone, but we were many in the car.\n\nSuhaila was shot in the arm and her sister’s son was injured in the foot (see Section X on Grave Violations Against Children). As they escaped, they could see the forces shoot at their car, killing all remaining passengers.\n\nThere was a lot of shooting near El Geneina hospital and the river, said Zahra Khamis Ibrahim, a civil society representative who founded an organization providing services to sexual violence survivors. “We tried to get out of the vehicle to safety … [when] … armed men in civilian clothes standing on the road opened fire.” The victims were all known to Zahra Khamis Ibrahim: a 17-year-old girl named Fatma, a 95-year-old woman, and a 28-year-old woman. She also recognized two of the gunmen, a local Arab shop owner and another resident of Tamma ethnicity.\n\nWhen the shootout started, Dana, a 33-year-old teacher, ran toward al-Shati, near the Ministry of Animal Resources. RSF forces stopped her and her group of women:\n\nOne [man] said, ‘We can capture your governor and kill him!’ This was a threat to all of us Massalit people, since the governor was Massalit. They said, ‘If you have weapons, you need to lay them down in front of us.’ We said we didn’t have any and tried to leave. One guy, in RSF uniform, came up to another group of RSF [men] and said, ‘I need guns to shoot these women.’ We were all women, but he wanted to shoot us. A guy gave him a big gun. We started running when he got the gun. He shot Hawa [a woman in the group] in the back and me in the right arm. I heard the other then cheering. One guy said, ‘He killed two! He killed two!’\n\nPeople Shot in the River\n\nHundreds of civilians ran toward the Kajja river, which flows roughly 250 meters east of the A5 road, only to come under fire again from the RSF and militias. Many civilians were shot and killed or drowned in the deep waters.\n\nJamal Abdallah Khamis, the rights monitor, saw hundreds of people jump into the river, while a group of gunmen wearing RSF uniforms, Komplet, and Kadamul roughly 200 meters away under a tree near al-Hadath market, “opened fire on the people with machine guns and rifles, including Duskhas.” He said:\n\nSome people were shot before entering the water… Some were injured outside the water… Some people were already injured when they got in, and the water carried them away. Some were shot inside the water.\n\nFrom a house near the river where Adib, a lawyer, was hiding, he could see that:\n\nThere were hundreds [of people]... Those who didn’t know how to swim, the children, they sank. There was shooting into the water while [people] were in it. Even those running to the wadi [river] …the janjaweed were shooting them.\n\nHisham, the former government employee, swam across the river and saw children being swept away. He helped rescue a girl of around 10, and a boy of around 11 or 12. “People were crying… for help…, and the water was so deep, it was difficult for us to rescue [people]…. It was a very, very difficult experience.”\n\nAdib said shooting was mainly coming from near the hospital, but that some of the assailants were firing from Um Duwein, on the eastern bank of the river, using Dushkas and rifles. Hisham said the shots came from the west, north and south, especially west of the A5, around the Ministry of Animal Resources and al-Shati graveyard.\n\nYaseen, a 50-year-old farmer, was shot by a man in RSF clothing and then crossed the river with many women and children near the emergency unit building of the El Geneina hospital: “We could barely swim, and we lost all of our belongings as we crossed,” he said. Forces in RSF uniform near the hospital opened fire with rifles and Dushkas:\n\n[They] were shooting at us as we were swimming. I heard them shouting ‘You are Nubas! You should be killed!’ They opened fire on all of us, not just the men...\n\nDana, the teacher, said she believed vehicles of the RSF and militias were deliberately trying to force people to the river.\n\nAfter crossing, civilians walking north on the eastern shore also came under heavy shooting from Um Duwein as they reached Ardamata, recalled Hisham. From their base in Ardamata, SAF soldiers shot back to protect civilians, he said.\n\nShooting inside El Geneina in the Immediate Aftermath\n\nAfter the column fell apart, civilians fled through side streets in large numbers, only to be relentlessly and repeatedly ambushed by the RSF and militias. Witnesses described them shooting at crowds in the neighborhoods of al-Burhania square, al-Imtidad, al-Kifah, al-Mansoura, al-Nahda, al-Nasr, al-Nasseem, and al-Salam, as well as near the General Secretariat of the Government, and through N’djamena road.\n\nIsmat, 52, said she ran north, crossing the bridge located on the southern side of al-Nasr neighborhood, where she found the road blocked by forces in Kaptani and turbans. “They were yelling ‘Go back! Return!’ and when we didn’t turn around fast enough, they started shooting. I saw them shoot and kill at least 10 men,” she said.\n\nIn al-Nasseem, there was “an ambush on every corner of the road with gunmen firing on the crowds,” said Ramzi, who was injured as he fled through an alternate road. Arab men armed with rifles and machine guns shot him and thereafter gathered him and around nine other men at a rainwater pond, he said. They tortured Ramzi and the other men, forced them to bring injured and dead people to the pond, and eventually shot at them:\n\nThere was a pool of dirty water. They threw [us] inside there. At this point, many died inside…, and they tortured [us]… There was blood in the water, it was contaminated … When we were inside, they forced us to drink it and to keep our heads [under] the water. If you [lifted] your head, you would be beaten… with sticks… They asked for your tribe. That’s the question they were asking everybody… if you said you were Massalit, you were tortured more… They would say: ‘Is this your land? Is this your land?’… When we were in the water, they opened fire on us….[244]\n\nExcept for Ramzi and one other person, the rest of the 20 people who were at the pond at this stage were killed, he said.\n\nTariq also fled to al-Madaress, where he said RSF forces in vehicles fired at him and other people in the street, killing four on the spot. Assailants even killed four donkeys, he said. Seven men then approached Tariq’s group:\n\nThey dragged us outside and beat us. One said, ‘You are toro boro’ Another asked, ‘What tribe are you? Are you Massalit?’ I said I had no weapons.\n\nHatim, a community leader, saw a member of the RSF approach a horse carriage carrying an injured man and an older, sick man. The gunman “grabbed the man with the broken leg and snapped it further and the bone popped out… Then he hit the man on the head with a big stick and it looked to me like he killed him,” Hatim said.\n\nAdnan, the Sudanese Alliance fighter, said he saw a member of the RSF kill 14 people on al-Hurriya bridge linking al-Salam and al-Nahda neighborhoods. One of six RSF members at a nearby checkpoint approached the victims, unarmed civilians carrying luggage, “and killed them from up close with his weapon... All of the 14 killed were men but two women were [also] injured,” Adnan said.\n\nThe Search for Massalit Men and Weapons, and Looting: June 15 to June 18\n\nThe majority of Massalit fighters left El Geneina on June 15 after the massacre, said Yahya, the government adviser. But the RSF and allied militias continued searching through El Geneina for Massalit men and weapons, and carrying out killings and other abuses.\n\nAyman said the killing in his neighborhood of al-Salam, west of the El-Geneina market, went on from sunrise until 9 p.m. on June 15. Around 9.30 a.m., he ventured out and saw bodies in front of his house. Later, he helped collect 11 dead, most of them young men, he said. The perpetrators were “Arab youth, some of them our neighbors,” whom Ayman recognized.\n\nAssailants pursued people into houses and other places of refuge. Dalal, 26, said they brought their injured mother to a house where 12 people were already hiding. Minutes later, five fighters came in:\n\nThey grabbed all the young men [in our group] and bound their hands behind their backs with ropes or ties of some kind, and pushed them outside onto the ground right by the door, and shot each of them in the head. As they did it, they were saying: ‘You are Massalit!’ ‘You killed our people!’ ‘You are not Muslims!’\n\nHajar, 39, recalled that on the morning of June 15 in al-Mansoura, gunmen “surrounded the area [of al-Mansoura], banged on the doors of people’s homes… even… climbed over people’s walls, yelling at us to get out. They said, ‘We will kill you if you don’t get out!’ and ‘Bring the weapons and the gold!’” Karima, also in al-Mansoura, said that twice in the late morning, groups of RSF forces and men wearing Kaptani entered the house where she was hiding with other women, and asked for men and weapons. The second time, one of the men took her to a side room, slapped her, and raped her three times at gunpoint.\n\nMen trying to elude capture were shot, said Nasir:\n\nI saw three guys who were wearing abayas and niqab [women’s outfits covering the face] … to pretend to be women and escape. But Arabs who were patrolling, some in Kaptania with Kadamul and some in RSF uniforms, saw them and ripped off their niqabs. When they saw they were men, they shot them.\n\nHatim, a community leader, said he hid in a hut in the Khab area for two days after the massacre, observing his surroundings with binoculars through holes in the wall. On June 17, around midday, he saw a man wearing Kaptani and a turban stop an unarmed man in civilian clothes, aged around 19 to 20, and shoot him in the arm. Then, a man in RSF uniform told the perpetrator to shoot the young man again. Hatim said the shooter replied, “No, I need to slit his throat because he is toro boro (rebel),” and then he slit the young man’s throat.\n\nShula was stopped on June 17 by a gunman wearing civilian clothes and a Kadamul. She recalled:\n\nHe said, ‘Hoy, hoy, hoy, what tribe are you?’ I replied ‘Bargo.’ Then he said, ‘If you were Massalit, we decided that we don’t want to leave any alive, not even the children.’\n\nEvicting Massalit Residents Who Remained\n\nThe RSF and militias evicted thousands of people who, starting early in the morning of June 15, had sought safety in the Sheikh Musa Islamic Complex, a large building near the market, three witnesses said.\n\nTariq, 38, was among them. The civilians sent a sheikh to the RSF “to say that no attack should happen on that building because the people living there were poor and homeless,” he recalled. Tariq said vehicles then returned with the sheikh, carrying many RSF personnel in uniform and other men in Kaptani, some of whom had “white” skin and spoke “strange” Arabic. The light-skinned men searched all the men in the mosque and, with the RSF forces, separated them from women and children, Tariq said. Then they beat Tariq and other younger men “for an hour… with sticks and pipes,” stealing their phones and money. Tariq said that after that, “They let us all leave and the white guys started yelling ‘You should leave for Chad!’” Tariq, like the other civilians, was forced to abandon his belongings.\n\nSalman was at the mosque of the complex on June 16, preparing to pray, when “RSF and Janjaweed” arrived from all directions. “They threatened us, they told us to leave this location directly [and go to] Chad … leaving behind us all our possessions,” he said. Salman recalled a man in RSF uniform taunting him, “Go to Chad! Where is your governor? … We killed him!”\n\nBy June 18, there were 3,000 people in the mosque, including children and women from the neighborhoods of al-Jamarek and al-Mansoura, said Mohammed, who went there that day. “They were being forced to leave the area toward Chad by the RSF and militias,” he said.\n\nAbuses Against Civilians Fleeing to Chad\n\nWitnesses described how the RSF, militias, and local Arab people attacked the tens of thousands of civilians fleeing to Chad on June 14 and in the following days. These forces pursued, ambushed, abused, and looted people—overwhelmingly Massalit—who were running for their lives on a roughly 20-kilometer trek, largely without food or water.\n\nScores of interviewees depicted the desperate exodus. “I walked all the way without shoes,” said Wahida, a medical worker. “You need shoes to be safe… I couldn’t run.” Human Rights Watch verified three videos uploaded to Facebook and X (formerly known as Twitter) between June 14 and 17 showing large groups of people walking and, in one case, running, toward the Chad border. One of the videos, published to Facebook by Al Jazeera on June 14 and geolocated by Human Rights Watch to just west of El Geneina, shows hundreds, if not thousands, leaving the city.\n\nSome witnesses said they were stopped up to 10 times in a row in the bush or at approximately 10 checkpoints controlled by RSF and Arab gunmen on the A5 road linking El Geneina to Adré.\n\n“They established so many checkpoints. So many in front of you,” recalled Salman, 64, the former senior government official. “Arab women had their own checkpoints. And children did as well. And people on motorbikes, and so on, had their checkpoints.”\n\nSome witnesses said they were questioned by RSF and militia forces at checkpoints in a manner suggesting the forces were from El Geneina and trying to intercept specific Massalit figures before they reached Chad (see Section VII sub-section on Targeting of Prominent Massalit Leaders and Local Government Officials).\n\nOthers said that at checkpoints they recognized El Geneina residents and members of the RSF from the city. Zeina, a former senior government official, said she identified an RSF resident of al-Madaress at the Adikong checkpoint. “We will not allow you to carry your things to Chad,” she said an RSF member told her, before robbing her of her belongings. Samir, a fighter, said he recognized a classmate among the group of RSF forces that surrounded his group on the Jalabi mountain.\n\nAssailants subjected civilians to killings, beatings, whippings, mock executions, and other forms of ill-treatment, as well as looting and extortion. Some asked victims for information about the locations of weapons, fighters, and prominent Massalit individuals.\n\nThey asked people about their tribe, trying to identify Massalit people, and used ethnic slurs such as “Nuba,” “Zurga,” and “Ambayat.” Some said that Massalit people should leave the area, which was now “Dar Arab,” or the land of Arabs. Others said they would not let Massalit people get away.\n\nTwo fighters said the RSF and allied militias on the road summarily executed captured fighters or subjected them to other abuses.\n\nAt checkpoints, assailants robbed Salman’s group not only of their possessions such as “mobiles, money, some mats, plastic sheets and so on,” but also “certificates, identity cards, national IDs, etc.,” Salman said. “[T]hey collected them and threw them away… for us to be refugees forever.”\n\nMassalit fighters also fled the city during this period and clashed with RSF and allied militia forces positioned on the road. Muneer said he was among a group of around 300 fighters in 7 vehicles who tried to secure the road for civilians. His group clashed repeatedly with RSF and militias on the western outskirts of El Geneina near Baba Nusa village, before eventually running out of ammunition.\n\nOver the course of 10 days between June 14 and 24, 1,222 injured people arrived at the hospital run by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, Doctors Without Borders) in Adré, Chad. Over 90 percent had recent bullet injuries, including 28 children under 15, and 99 women, 62 of whom were pregnant.\n\nWitness accounts and statements suggest varied motivations among the perpetrators. Some, such as those who said, “Nuba, you don’t have land here! You should leave,” seemed to want to push people to Chad and to leave the city. Others who used ethnic slurs, as they shot at crowds or carried out summary executions, seem to have targeted people for killings on an ethnic basis. In some cases, the RSF and allied militias were looking for prominent Massalit figures (see Section VII sub-section on Targeting of Prominent Massalit Leaders and Local Government Officials). Finally, some appeared motivated by a desire for revenge or for financial rewards, as assailants extorted their victims.\n\nUltimately large numbers of Massalit civilians, including infants and older children, women, injured and older people, were killed.\n\nKillings and Attempted Killings\n\nCivilians were killed on the road as the result of both indiscriminate shooting on crowds of civilians and deliberate summary killings. Men, including adolescent boys, were particular targets, though women, children, and older people were also killed in apparently large numbers. Witnesses overwhelmingly described the area separating El Geneina from Chad—the road and the bush—as littered with bodies of apparent civilians.\n\nMousa, a lawyer, said that at checkpoints forces would open fire on the crowd and that “some people would fall, and the rest of the group would have to stop.” He described several such incidents. In one of them, Arab gunmen shot to stop his group near the Ranga mountain on June 15 and then suddenly a man wearing Komplet “shot everybody in front of [me],” Mousa said.\n\nNafisa, a medical worker who fled around June 17 and was traveling with a group of about 18 families, or 80 people, said RSF and allied forces killed three or four people from the group at every checkpoint on the road. She described how RSF men shot and killed three 15 to 16-year-old girls when “they tried to take [the girls] away from our group [and] the girls refused.” Only 30 of the group made it to Chad. “Some were shot on the way, some had injuries and couldn’t make it, some [were] weak because of lack of food,” Nafisa said.\n\nTwo witnesses said they saw men from a group of around 50 RSF fighters throw two carriages of the kind drawn by horses or donkeys, each carrying one or two injured people, into a “big, deep” pit. “The family members of the wounded people were screaming not to push them in, but [the RSF] opened fire, so we all started running,” Anwar said. At another checkpoint, a car equipped with Dushkas blocked the way and opened fire on civilians, killing a six-month-old baby carried by his mother. “[The mother] started crying and one of the RSF men with [a] stick said to her, ‘If you keep crying, we will kill your other baby,’” Anwar recalled.\n\nJamal Abdallah Khamis said that the same day, he was fleeing alongside a large crowd of civilians accompanied by four Sudanese Alliance vehicles when this convoy came under attack near Shukri, an Arab settlement around 15 kilometers west of El Geneina. RSF forces on the A5 road attacked from the south, while militia members in civilian clothes and turbans attacked from the north and the west. “They opened random fire on the crowd,” killing tens of people in front of Jamal. He said the victims were all civilians and included women and children.\n\nJamal ran away. A nine-year-old boy “was running after me and trying to catch me. When he did, I fell, because I was tired too. I told him, ‘You have to run.’” The two hid behind trees, as did some others, all adult men except the 9-year-old and a 16-year-old boy. A group of eight or nine gunmen in RSF uniforms found them and gathered them in a group. Jamal described what happened then:\n\nThey started beating us, torturing us… with whips and the stocks of their rifles… [and] iron sticks. … They lashed the [nine-year-old] boy and he was crying loudly. At that point they ordered us to lie down… facing the ground, and they beat us… That child stood up, and there was shooting. I don’t know how he was shot, but I found him dead.\n\nThe RSF eventually let the rest of the group go.\n\nThat same day, Suhaila “saw at least 20 boys have their throats slit” at various checkpoints along the way. She was helping an injured man walk, but forces killed him and shot and injured her in the head.\n\nSome witnesses described gunmen at checkpoints separating out men and taking them to unknown locations. Mousa, the lawyer, said when his group reached Ranga mountain, Arab people at a checkpoint selected “men randomly, took them aside, and then asked the [rest of the] group to go.”\n\nRSF forces summarily executed disarmed Massalit fighters, according to two fighters who were on the road that day. Gammar, 16, a child soldier of the Sudanese Alliance previously injured in fighting, escaped El Geneina on June 14 with a group of fighters. Armed men wearing Kaptani and shawls summarily executed more than 30 from his group near Shukri and the Ranga Mountain. “After [the fighters] put down their arms, they opened fire and killed them,” Gammar said. Muneer, the policemen who joined the Massalit self-defense forces, said RSF and Arab militias surrounded and disarmed his group, which had run out of ammunition, before stabbing and shooting to death 17 or 18 of them.\n\nTorture, Ill-treatment, and Looting\n\nWitnesses reported widespread beating, whipping, and other forms of torture and ill-treatment, including mock executions, by RSF and militia forces along the way. Local Arab people also abused fleeing civilians. Assailants extorted money, gold, and possessions. Some interrogated victims.\n\nTwo hours after encountering the RSF forces who killed the nine-year-old boy, Jamal Abdallah Khamis and his group came across other gunmen, some in RSF uniform, who beat and whipped the 16-year-old boy, shot around him, and tied a rope around his neck to terrorize him. They demanded he tell them about the locations of people in hiding and of weapons and said, “Get out Zurga, get out Ambayat.” Jamal himself was later subjected to another mock execution.\n\nHajar, 39, said that on June 15, when she was fleeing with thousands of others, men in RSF uniforms stopped her, her 15-year-old son, and a group of 8 boys he knew, all roughly the same age. The forces forced the boys to strip and lie on the ground, Hajar said. She recalled:\n\nOne man put a knife above the head of my son and told him to get up and walk over to look at a row of bodies lying on the side of the road. My son walked over, and then the guy with the knife said to him, ‘Now all you need to do is cut the throats of your friends.’ He and the other boys started yelling and saying they couldn’t do that. At that moment, a Landcruiser came, and the fighters turned to talk to the men in the car, and we all ran away.\n\nShowing a cut on his left ear, Anwar said that at each of the nine checkpoints he encountered, fleeing civilians were beaten with sticks and knives. Kawthar, 36, a local aid worker, said a man in RSF uniform and a teenager—both armed—beat her and her 62-year-old father with their guns near Baba Nusa village on June 15, causing significant bleeding on her father’s head, and breaking one of her teeth. Salman, the former senior government official, said six gunmen in civilian clothes who controlled the checkpoint by Ranga village whipped and then raped four women from his group near a pond during the night on June 16.\n\nArab villagers participated in the abuse, said Asiya, a 60-year-old woman. Many men, some in uniform, and women, stopped her group near the Arab settlement of Shukri on June 15. The Arab women “were beating… with sticks… all the women who were fleeing … singing and cheering as they did so… I don’t know how many times they beat me.” Meanwhile, the Arab men grabbed the men from the crowd, threw them to the ground, and beat them with sticks, Asiya said. The villagers also looted money and gold. Asiya suffered a head injury and was hospitalized for four days at Adré hospital.\n\nEthnic Targeting\n\nAssailants used ethnic slurs against people fleeing, said they wanted them out of Sudan, or that they would kill Massalit people.\n\nShula, 35, who is from the Bargo tribe, said that in mid-June, at one of the checkpoints on the road, two young men told her, “If you were Massalit, we would not let you leave. The Massalit will not come home. But you are okay because you are Bargo.”\n\nMousa, the lawyer, said that on two occasions, Arab militias humiliated people from his group by forcing them to say “Dar Arab! Dar Arab,” or used racist language, such as “Nubas! Allah Akbar! The area has been liberated from the Massalit, it’s great. There is no Dar Massalit. There is no Dar Andoka [land of the Massalit Sultan]!”\n\nLatifa, a student aged 25, said the people at the checkpoints on June 20 said to her and her group, “You are Nuba!” and “You are Nawab!” and “Nuba, you don’t have land here! You should leave!” and “From now on, you don’t have land here.” Hisham, who fled El Geneina on June 24, recalled people at checkpoints saying, “We have liberated this area. We don’t want to see the owners of the land anymore! We are the owners of the land!” Hisham said that the people at checkpoints would beat men with long hair—a style favored by Massalit fighters—saying, “These are the owners of the land, and they will fight us one day.”\n\nBodies Everywhere\n\nResidents and survivors describe anguish over seeing large numbers of bodies on the streets of El Geneina in the aftermath of the June 15 massacre. Residents helped collect the bodies and arrange burials. Witnesses described instances of gunmen shooting at residents to prevent burials. (See Section VIII on Counting and Burying the Dead).\n\nMany dead people were scattered near the A5 road, where the bulk of the massacre occurred. Adib, a lawyer, said that throughout June 15 he saw gunmen shoot at people trying to collect bodies near the river. At dusk, the shooting abated and he ventured out with non-Massalit neighbors, who began to move the bodies. “There was a big number of killed. It was terrible,” Adib said. He described the sight: “The dead bodies… The vehicles that people had been using... And the food: the beans, the flour that women had been carrying, had all been thrown on the road.” Adib said the 35 dead people he saw were “all civilians, including children and women … scattered about in a very short space… along… the west of al-Shati graveyard on the main road.”\n\nMohsina, a humanitarian worker, found the body of a woman who had been shot in the stomach near the Imam al-Kazem gathering point and then the bodies of a boy and girl, aged around 8 or 9. “I checked under the cloth covering them because I wanted to know if they were my kids,” she said. Continuing to al-Zahra girls’ boarding school gathering point, she counted 18 dead men, women, and children, she said. Later in al-Mansoura, she said some forces stopped her and said, “You are Massalit! You are a Kumurud mother! You are looking for your rebel husband!”\n\nThe smell of death “was all around the area” separating al-Zuhur from al-Thawra on June 17, said Shula, who recalled seeing 20 bodies.\n\nMany interviewees said they saw many dead bodies on the road to Chad, attesting to a large scale of killings. “I fainted at some point because of the horror of all the bodies,” said 39-year-old Hajar.\n\nSarah, a humanitarian aid worker, said that she saw an open pit with an estimated 200 bodies between the villages of Baba Nusa and Adikong on June 14. Salman described seeing many corpses on a side road north of a petrol station in Ranga village, and along the main road between Ranga and Shukri village. One man had been killed driving his horse cart, Salman said, roughly 500 meters from a checkpoint, and “there were also many dead bodies around [the cart]. It seems they had all been aboard.”\n\nTwo witnesses said they saw dead men with their hands tied behind their backs.\n\nIn the bed of the Kajja river—by then dry—along the border between Sudan and Chad near the Beida and Atia villages, there were many dead bodies decomposing, said Taher, a medical assistant, who shared photos he took. He believed these were people who had been carried by the waters after having drowned or been shot in the stampede in El Geneina in the early hours of June 15.\n\nVII. Abuses Committed by RSF Forces and Allied Militias (April 24-June 14)\n\nThe mass killings that began on June 14 marked the culmination of a campaign of abuses that started on April 24, when the RSF and allied militias began their offensives on majority-Massalit neighborhoods. Throughout the seven weeks leading to June 14, these forces committed widespread killings, sexual violence, torture, and other forms of ill-treatment. They targeted Massalit leaders, did not spare children from serious abuses including unlawful killings, and sought to deprive Massalit and non-Arab civilians of their means to continue to live in their communities.\n\nUnlawful Killings and Shootings\n\nThe RSF and allied militias committed widespread killings of civilians, shooting civilians in the streets or in places of refuge, sometimes execution-style. The vast majority of the victims appeared to have been men, but women, adolescent boys, younger children, and older people were not spared.\n\nRSF and allied militias shot people who sheltered in their homes or in other buildings, including mosques and gathering points of IDPs. They fired from inside buildings and checkpoints, while patrolling the streets or attacking neighborhoods, on foot and in vehicles. They targeted those fetching water and those trying to tend to the injured and the dead. Many of the victims said they had no idea why they were targeted in the streets, since they were in civilian clothes and were not carrying weapons. The RSF and allied militias also shot indiscriminately into crowds.\n\nIn addition to these deliberating killings, civilians were also killed in crossfire in the context of fighting between the RSF and allied militia on the one hand, and Massalit armed groups on the other.\n\nPrior to the June 15 killings, one of the most lethal incidents during the first seven weeks occurred on May 12, when dozens of gunmen in civilian dress riding RSF vehicles entered al-Atig mosque in al-Thawra neighborhood and killed and injured dozens of civilians.\n\nExtrajudicial and Summary Executions\n\nThe RSF and allied militias actively sought out, attacked, and killed Massalit men, including adolescent boys. They also killed women and younger children.\n\nRSF and allied militia would storm into homes, demanding that occupants hand over men or weapons, before summarily executing many if not all of those sheltering inside, residents said. Kawthar, 36, a local aid worker, said 13 gunmen entered her home in al-Madaress in the afternoon of April 27 and executed 5 male relatives and a neighbor. She recounted the following exchange:\n\n‘Are you Massalit? …\n\n- Yes. …\n\n- Why are you staying here? …\n\n- This is our home. …\n\n- Where are the men?’\n\nWhen Kawthar did not answer, one of the men went outside, found her brother in the yard under a tree, and shot him.\n\nKawthar’s 42-year-old brother died on the spot. The men then searched the house, Kawthar said. They found, shot, and killed her uncle, in his 40s; three male cousins, aged 17, 31, and 45; and a neighbor, 25. All were in civilian clothing and none had weapons, she said. She said she recognized one of the armed men, an Arab man around the age of 30, from al-Juweili neighborhood.\n\nThe same day, Khalil, 35, said a group of armed men, one in RSF trousers and the rest in civilian dress, shot four men at his neighbor’s house, killing one and injuring the other three with bullet wounds to the head, thigh, leg, and hand. Another man had been injured with a knife wound to the head. The gunmen told Khalil they suspected the neighbor of harboring weapons.\n\nIn other cases, armed men entered homes, executed people, and then looted their homes. This is what happened in early May to the neighbors of Khamisa, 24, who lived in al-Salam. Four armed men in civilian dress stormed a home where three women and a man, all Bargo, were staying. “After a while, we heard some shooting,” Khamisa recalled. “An hour later or so, we went to check on our neighbors… All of them were dead.” The bodies were lying in the yard, she said.\n\nKillings and Shootings in the Streets and at Checkpoints\n\nThe RSF and allied militias opened fire on civilians in the streets and at checkpoints.\n\nAt checkpoints, these forces would sometimes shoot civilians at close range. Ahmad, 41, a Massalit fighter, was hiding in an apartment in al-Jamarek, from where he saw an RSF man kill a woman and her two daughters who passed a checkpoint on June 14.\n\nEman, 39, a government employee and senior advisor to the governor of El Geneina, was walking by an RSF checkpoint in al-Salam in early June when she saw the fighters stop a young man in his late teens. “They asked if he was Massalit. He said ‘No,’ then they said ‘Go,’ and he started running. Then [one of the men] at the checkpoint, who wore an RSF uniform… [and] a Kadamul shot him.” She did not know if he survived.\n\nZakaria, 27, said a group of armed men in civilian dress riding Toyota vehicles opened fire on him and his friends on the streets of al-Madaress on a Friday in May. The gunmen killed four of Zakaria’s friends: Naji, 16, Mohammed, 22, Musbah, 28, and Alfadhel, 31. A bullet hit Zakaria through the right knee. A fifth friend was injured as well. “We fell to the ground and smeared blood on ourselves from our friends’ bodies and lay still to make it look like we were dead … [for] 30 minutes and didn’t move until they were long gone,” he said. Zakaria said he and his friends were unarmed and in civilian dress at the time of the attack.\n\nWitnesses also described gunmen, some described as “snipers,” methodically firing in the streets at people who were clearly identifiable as civilians not engaging in hostilities.\n\nMaka said her sister was shot in the stomach in early June while walking between al-Madaress and al-Majliss neighborhoods at about 4 p.m. Ismat, 52, was walking through al-Jabal neighborhood at about 7 a.m. on June 12, when someone shot her in the left side of the neck and again through her right side. She raised her arm to protect her face and was shot a third time in the right upper arm.\n\nAdil, 36, a teacher, said armed men shot and killed Hinda (about 22), a woman from his neighborhood, while she was trying to collect the body of one of eight people, including two children, who had been killed in al-Thawra on April 25.\n\nSome civil volunteers described gunmen shooting at fellow volunteers working to carry the dead and injured (see Section VIII on Counting and Burying the Dead). Sharif, 37, a government employee, was one such volunteer. On May 20, he and others were working in the street in al-Madaress when one of the volunteers, Mansour Adam Abbakar, was shot in the leg, just as he was lifting a victim.\n\nOn April 27 Aqeel and four other men were trying to rescue injured neighbors in al-Madaress, when they saw gunmen in civilian dress approaching. Aqeel said his group started running and the armed men opened fire, injuring one of his friends through the right thigh. “I carried him on my back all the way to the clinic,” Aqeel said.\n\nKillings and Injuries from the Use of Explosive Weapons\n\nMassalit, Arab, and other non-Arab residents of El Geneina across most neighborhoods described numerous attacks in which explosive weapons such as mortar projectiles and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) were used in densely populated civilian areas, therefore increasing the likelihood of civilian killings and injuries as the result of indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. By all accounts, explosive weapons were used in attacks on civilian areas from the start of hostilities. Some interviewees said they experienced so many attacks that, though they remembered the specifics of certain incidents, they could not remember the dates, because of the frequency with which such attacks occurred.\n\nWhile the use of explosive weapons is not a violation of international humanitarian law, the intentional direction of an attack against civilians with any lethal weapon is prohibited and a war crime, as are intentionally indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. Explosive weapons when used in populated areas heighten concerns of unlawful indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. Attacks involving explosive weapons include attacks that use mortars, rockets, and artillery. Interviewees here generally referred to explosive munitions as “danna(t),” the term commonly used in Sudan to refer to mortars, although it is sometimes used to refer to other types of explosive weapons, including artillery.\n\nMany civilians were killed by explosive weapons used by the RSF in attacks targeting majority-Massalit neighborhoods and sites hosting displaced Massalit families. For example, witnesses described particularly intense shelling during the offensives in late May and early June.\n\nHassan Zakaria Ismail, the nurse, also owned two private clinics in the city, and said that on May 21, every single member of at least three families was killed in attacks that used explosive weapons. Aqeel, an activist, said that on June 6, al-Madaress neighborhood was hit repeatedly with mortar shells, which he believed were from the RSF and which he said killed 17 women and children. Human Rights Watch was unable to establish those responsible for these attacks.\n\nEight residents found fragments after attacks that took place in populated residential areas. They described the shapes of the remnants of munitions they saw, describing a cylindrical projectile with fins at the back end, consistent with that of mortar projectiles that the RSF and the SAF are known to possess. Mortars are difficult to target with accuracy and cause blast and fragmentation damage, making them prone to causing indiscriminate harm to civilians and civilian objects when used in populated areas.\n\nMost witnesses presumed that the RSF was behind the attacks in which explosive weapons were used. The RSF was equipped with rockets, mortars, and RPGs, the UN Panel of Experts on the Sudan reported in January 2024. However three interviewees said that Massalit fighters also possessed RPGs, claims corroborated by the UN Panel of Experts (see Section XI on Abuses against Arab Community Members). In addition, at least three said the SAF fired explosive weapons from its base in Ardamata into the city, following ongoing attacks (see Section XIV on Government Forces’ Inability or Unwillingness to Protect).\n\nKhater, 44, said an explosive weapon hit the house where he was sheltering in al-Jamarek around May 9, and that it killed four civilian men who were sheltering with him. The house was about 100 meters from the governor’s office, which at the time hosted the governor’s forces. The next day, another munition hit a location near the National Registration office, about 200 meters from the governor’s office, Khater said. He said he saw the bodies of four women killed in the attack.\n\nFour days later, another explosive weapon detonated about 60 meters from the governor’s office, killing eight civilians, Khater said. He assisted in collecting the bodies. He said he did not hear any outgoing fire from the governor’s forces at the time of the attacks.\n\nAl-Zahra Girls’ Boarding School\n\nMany civilians were killed in repeated attacks using explosive weapons on the IDP gathering site at al-Zahra girls’ boarding school (see Section IV on Escalating Attacks on Massalit Displacement Sites and Neighborhoods: April 24 to June 14). A monitor shared photos he said he took at al-Zahra girl’s boarding school showing remnants of 60 and 120mm mortars and RPG-7 warheads. Fighters were present a few hundred meters away – if not closer – from late April until mid-June, however the high density of civilians in the area at the time means the use of weapons in these attacks, which could not be accurately directed at military objects, renders them apparently indiscriminate.\n\nAl-Zahra girls’ boarding school became one of the largest IDP gathering sites in the city in late April, hosting thousands of people fleeing attacks. The site is located around 350 meters from both the government’s General Secretariat, where SAF and Sudanese Alliance armored vehicles were deployed, and the governor’s house. The area was controlled by Massalit armed groups until the second week of June. One journalist from El Geneina said the Sudanese Alliance stored military equipment inside the school.\n\nSatellite imagery shows the first tents appearing in the courtyard of the school in late April. Their numbers increase progressively throughout May and the first half of June until tents cover most of the available space. After mid-June, the number of tents starts to decrease, and none are visible on images from early August.\n\nThe boarding school was shelled repeatedly between late April and June, according to witnesses and monitors. Witnesses said dozens were killed and injured, mostly children and women (see Section VII sub-section on Unlawful Killings). A local rights monitor and a Massalit fighter said the RSF was responsible for the shelling, and that its forces shelled from the RSF base west of the city. One witness described shelling consistent with mortar attacks and said it came from the west.\n\nAmna, a 33-year-old woman, said she spent 40 days at the school and during that time saw many people killed and injured—mostly children and women—as a result of the bombardment. On April 25, she was in the yard when shelling killed three women, two children, and a man, she said. Salam, who spent over a month at the site with his family, described two days of heavy shelling on April 27-28, which he said killed at least 35, including at least seven women whom he helped bury. His wife Lamya said she saw her grandmother killed, along with two girls, in one of the shelling incidents on al-Zahra girls’ boarding school in late April.\n\nAttacks with explosive weapons on the civilian area where al-Zahra girls’ boarding school was located continued in May and June. Injured people with “large blast wounds” came to the Ingaz clinic from al-Zahra girls’ boarding school on May 14, said Aqeel, a volunteer there. Rania, a 30-year-old woman, said she witnessed two explosive weapon attacks inside the compound of al-Zahra girls’ boarding school on May 21, which left 42 people dead, including her sister-in-law: “The people who were killed were men, women, and little kids… Some of the bodies we couldn’t find. They were in small pieces.”\n\nA senior doctor operating in the makeshift clinics recalled an uptick in women and children coming into the clinic in the first weeks of June. The doctor said most had been injured at gathering points around al-Jamarek, in particular al-Zahra girls’ boarding school, and that more than 40 percent of the victims were women and children. On June 11, the clinic received 105 casualties, all of them children and women from al-Zahra girls’ boarding school, he said.\n\nFatin, a 40-year-old woman sheltering at the school, saw her 6-year-old son Adam and her 14-year old daughter Makboula get injured in shelling at the school on June 13, in an incident which killed 9 and injured many. A monitor said that on June 14 he helped bury 25 people, including his uncle, who had been killed in shelling at al-Zahra girls’ boarding school that day.\n\nTargeted Attacks on Prominent Community Members\n\nRSF and allied militias appear to have targeted prominent Massalit community members. Human Rights Watch interviewed 24 human rights activists, lawyers, government officials, civil servants, intellectuals and community leaders, who described how they and other prominent Massalit figures were targeted, explicitly or apparently, for their role and work. The attackers carried out extrajudicial killings, unlawful detention, ill-treatment and torture, and sexual violence against many viewed to be prominent Massalits. The homes of these prominent figures were sometimes looted and burned, though they may also have been targeted as a result of their apparent wealth. Most figures were Massalit, but some people of other ethnic identities were also singled out and, in some cases, accused of being pro-Massalit.\n\nSurvivors and witnesses recounted how assailants, both militias and RSF, often asked for them by name, seeking their whereabouts.\n\nSeveral sources said that assailants appeared to be following one or more “hit lists.” One such list included seven of the most prominent Massalit traditional leaders, including the Sultan of the Massalit, a prominent religious leader, and figures with the high tribal rank of Fursha. An individual who said he was on the list, heard that it circulated on WhatsApp. Some interviewees said captors interrogated them with clear knowledge of their personal backgrounds. Two interviewees also reported that RSF and militia forces at checkpoints on the road to Chad were looking by name for human rights activists and prominent Massalit people.\n\nTargeting of Prominent Massalit Leaders and Local Government Officials\n\nProminent political, administrative, and intellectual figures from the Massalit community appear to have been targeted in a seemingly coordinated manner. These included the Sultan of the Massalit, Saad Bahar El Din, and his family members; West Darfur government figures; employees of government institutions; and intellectuals. In at least two cases, this occurred after the victims were denounced by Arab colleagues.\n\nHuman Rights Watch interviewed five prominent individuals who were arrested during the seven-week campaign despite what they said were their best efforts to evade detention (see also Section VII on Unlawful Detentions, Inhumane and Degrading Treatment). All said they were explicitly questioned about their work during their detention.\n\nIbrahim, 36, a former local official, said a group of armed men, some in RSF uniforms, detained him at his home on April 28. He was taken to a school in Um Duwein, where his captors interrogated him, including about his work to support accountability efforts for the victims of attacks on the Krinding camp for internally displaced persons in 2019 (see Section I on Background).\n\nZeina, a former government official, said she was pursued by RSF and militia forces in early May. “There was a very heavy attack on the city. Arabs, Janjaweed jumped into the house where I was [in al-Salam]. They had a list and they said, ‘We are looking for [Zeina], the [official],’” she said. The men did not recognize her and so left.\n\nThen, on May 19, two RSF personnel recognized Zeina in al-Zariba neighborhood, she said. They arrested her and took her to the local police station, where she saw four RSF vehicles and many armed men, mostly in RSF uniforms and some in civilian clothes. Her captors bound her legs and, seeking to know her identity, “started beating me with their hands on my face to scare me into confessing.” Zeina said her captors killed one man and a boy in front of her in an effort to make her admit her identity (see Section VII sub-section on Unlawful Detentions, Inhumane and Degrading Treatment). She recalled them saying, “Massalit, you killed us! The governor is killing us! You will be our slaves.” Zeina was released later in the night, she said.\n\nAmer, 66, a prominent community leader from al-Shati, said assailants attacked his house on three separate occasions. The first time, on April 24, he was out looking for water, but his wife was at home. The men asked her where her husband was, and she replied that she did not know. They then demanded Amer’s car keys and when his wife refused to hand them over, they beat her with sticks and then looted the family’s possessions and damaged the car. The gunmen threatened to burn down the home, but an Arab neighbor intervened, Amer’s wife told him. During the second attack three days later, the men found Amer’s adult son and threatened him, saying, “We’ll arrest this son, the father will come.” On the third attack, in May, assailants set fire to his house. Amer said the first attack was by Arab militiamen from Um Duwein, some of whom he and his relatives knew, while the other two were by a group that included neighbors.\n\nBahar El Din, the Sultan of the Massalit, told Human Rights Watch that assailants targeted him, his family, and local leaders. “We are leaders,” he said, “If you eliminate leaders, you win. Arabs and the RSF were searching for me in my own house and other houses, saying they will kill me. But they did not find me.” A relative said that a group of Arab and RSF men came to the Sultan’s family’s home mid-June and, when they did not find him, killed three of his guards. The Sultan’s brother was also killed, in circumstances Human Rights Watch was not able to confirm.\n\nHussein, an activist known for being close to the Sultan, said gunmen also came to his house and threatened to kill his father, saying: “[Hussein] is very close to the leaders including the Sultan, so we want him to lead us to these leaders!”\n\nTargeting of Human Rights Defenders and Lawyers\n\nHuman rights defenders were also targeted, possibly because of their perceived prominence in the community and their role in documenting abuses by the RSF and militias.\n\nFor years, lawyers in El Geneina have been instrumental in documenting RSF and Arab militia crimes against displaced non-Arab communities, and in advocating for accountability. Some lawyers and human rights defenders had already been threatened prior to the outbreak of fighting in El Geneina.\n\nInterviewees said the targeting of these activists ramped up with the onset of the conflict. Mousa, a lawyer, said a close RSF contact warned him on April 23—the eve of the fighting—that attacks on the city by Arab groups were imminent, and advised him to leave his house. The contact told Mousa that “lawyers, community leaders, and activists from the Massalit community will mainly be targeted.”\n\nOn April 28, the family of Tamer, a human rights defender, informed him that a group of Arab gunmen had come to their house that day asking for Tamer by name. When they couldn’t find him, the men left without further explanation, Tamer said.\n\nAdib, a 57-year-old lawyer who provided legal aid and served on a committee for the victims of the 2019 attack on Krinding camp, said he and other committee members began receiving phone threats on April 24. “They [anonymous callers] called us and threatened us, as [members of the] committee defending the victims.”\n\nAdib said four lawyers, including one active on human rights issues but not a member of the committee, and at least one witness to the 2019 attacks, were killed during the attacks between late April and June. Amin, another lawyer also representing the victims of Krinding, said that one of them, Khamis Arbab Ishaq, “a close colleague … was killed on May 16.”\n\nIn June, the Darfur Bar Association, a group of Darfuri human rights lawyers, confirmed the killing of the four lawyers. Human Rights Watch was not able to corroborate whether these lawyers were targeted and killed as a result of their work.\n\nBesides lawyers, other human rights defenders were also subjected to threats and attacks. While in hiding in El Geneina in May, Azra, a human rights activist, said in a telephone interview with Human Rights Watch:\n\nArmed men from the RSF and Arabs went to a relative’s house and asked about my whereabouts. So I keep moving from house to house, hiding. A friend from the Rizeigat [the Arab tribe from which RSF and militias predominantly mobilize in West Darfur] also told me that the RSF and Arab [militias] have a ‘kill list’ for activists, monitors, and Massalit leaders and that my name is on it. The situation is very bad and there are no safe routes available to Chad or even within Darfur to Nyala or El Fasher…. If I had any chance to leave El Geneina, I would, because I am targeted.\n\nNura, a 28-year-old journalist and human rights activist, was abducted and raped by four men on May 12, including one in RSF uniform, who referred to her activism during the vicious sexual assault. (See section VII sub-section on Rape).\n\nProminent individuals were tracked down on the route to Chad. Jamal Abdallah Khamis, a human rights lawyer, faced questioning as he fled in a crowd to Adré after the June 15 massacre (see Section V sub-section on Collapse of Massalit Defenses). A group of armed men, some in RSF uniform and some in plainclothes, fired around the hole in which Jamal was hiding and told him to come out:\n\nThey asked me ‘where is Sheikh Youssouf [a religious and community leader] and where is Idris Janja [a Sudanese Alliance commander]?’ They also asked: ‘Where are your lawyers?’ I told them that I knew [of] both of them, but not where they were and that I didn’t know the lawyers or where they are. They did not know I was a lawyer.\n\nThey threatened Jamal, saying, “Unless you tell us [about] the people who used to have meetings with the governor—your lawyers, who they are… if you don’t give us this information, we will slaughter you.” Someone from the RSF came and said, “let’s take this person to Kurti [village] checkpoint. We have people from El Geneina there, so they will know [this man], since he lives in El Geneina.”\n\nJamal was then tortured with a mock execution: his captors asked him to lie with his head in the direction of Mecca and, with a boot to his head and knife to his throat, told him to repeat the shahada prayer.\n\nExecutive members of El Juzur, a human rights monitoring organization, told Human Rights Watch that besides Jamal, six other members were harassed, tortured, or detained on their journeys to Adré. It also documented eight cases of sexual violence perpetrated against activists, including the rapes of five of its members.\n\nMousa, a lawyer, said that someone confronted him, recognizing him as a lawyer from El Geneina, at a checkpoint near Jalabi, close to Adikong, which marks the border with Chad.\n\nAmin, a lawyer and human rights monitor who is Zaghawa—and therefore believed he faced less of a threat on the basis of his ethnicity than his Massalit colleagues—returned to El Geneina in July and realized that he was nevertheless still being targeted, apparently for his work as a lawyer.
