The HUA captured Lt. Col. Bhobandar Singh in January and demanded that Indian forces turn over an HUA commander in return for Singh's release. When Indian authorities refused, the militants killed Singh. In mid-May, HUA militants conducted two attacks in Doda district in which they stopped buses, forced the passengers off, then singled out individuals for execution -- the last victim was a 14-year-old Muslim boy. The HUA also supports Muslims in Indian-controlled Kashmir with humanitarian and military assistance.\n\nStrength: The Harakat-ul-Ansar has several thousand armed members located in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan, and in the southern Kashmir Valley and the Doda regions of India.

Islamic Jihad publicly claimed responsibility for the car-bombing of Israel's Embassy in Buenos Aires in March 1992.\n\nStrength: Several thousand.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: Operates in the Bekaa Valley, the southern suburbs of Beirut, and southern Lebanon; has established cells in Europe, Africa, South America, North America, and elsewhere.\n\nExternal Aid: Receives substantial amounts of financial, training, weapons, explosives, political, diplomatic, and organizational aid from Iran.\n\nJamaat ul-Fuqra\n\nDescription: Jamaat ul-Fuqra is an Islamic sect that seeks to purify Islam through violence. Fuqra is led by Pakistani cleric Shaykh Mubarik Ali Gilani, who established the organization in the early 1980s. Gilani now resides in Pakistan, but most Fuqra cells are located in North America. Fuqra members have purchased isolated rural compounds in North America to live communally, practice their faith, and insulate themselves from Western culture.\n\nActivities: Fuqra members have attacked a variety of targets they view as enemies of Islam, including Muslims they regard as heretics, and Hindus. Several Fuqra members were convicted in a Canadian court in late 1993 of conspiracy to commit murder -- a charge related to their plans to bomb a Hindu temple and a Hindu-owned cinema in Toronto -- and Fuqra members in the United States have also been convicted of criminal violations, including murder and fraud. Attacks during the 1980s included assassinations and firebombings across the United States.\n\nStrength: Unknown.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: North America, Pakistan.\n\nExternal Aid: None.\n\nJapanese Red Army (JRA) a.k.a.: Anti-Imperialist International Brigade (AIIB)\n\nDescription: An international terrorist group formed around 1970 after breaking away from Japanese Communist League Red Army Faction. Now led by Fusako Shigenobu, believed to be in Syrian-garrisoned area of Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. Stated goals are to overthrow Japanese Government and monarchy and to help foment world revolution. Organization unclear but may control or at least have ties to Anti-Imperialist International Brigade (AIIB); may also have links to Antiwar Democratic Front -- an overt leftist political organization -- inside Japan. Details released following November 1987 arrest of leader Osamu Maruoka indicate that JRA may be organizing cells in Asian cities, such as Manila and Singapore. Has had close and longstanding relations with Palestinian terrorist groups -- based and operating outside Japan -- since its inception.\n\nActivities: Before 1977, JRA carried out a series of brutal attacks over a wide geographical area, including the massacre of passengers at Lod airport in Israel (1972) and two Japanese airliner hijackings (1973 and 1977). Anti-US attacks include attempted takeover of US Embassy in Kuala Lumpur (1975). Since mid-1960s, has carried out several crude rocket and mortar attacks against a number of US embassies. In April 1988, JRA operative Yu Kikumura was arrested with explosives on the New Jersey Turnpike, apparently planning an attack to coincide with the bombing of a USO club in Naples and a suspected JRA operation that killed five, including a US servicewoman. He was convicted of these charges and is serving a lengthy prison sentence in the United States.\n\nStrength: About 30 hardcore members; undetermined number of sympathizers.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: Based in Syrian-controlled areas of Lebanon; often transits Damascus.\n\nExternal Aid: Receives aid, including training and base camp facilities, from radical Palestinian terrorists, especially the PFLP. May also receive aid from Libya. Suspected of having sympathizers and support apparatus in Japan.\n\nJihad Group a.k.a.: al-Jihad, Islamic Jihad, New Jihad Group, Vanguards of Conquest, Talaa'al al-Fateh\n\nDescription: An Egyptian Islamic extremist group active since the late 1970s; appears to be divided into at least two separate factions: remnants of the original Jihad led by Abbud al-Zumar, currently imprisoned in Egypt, and a new faction calling itself Vanguards of Conquest (Talaa'al al-Fateh or the New Jihad Group), which appears to be led by Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is currently outside Egypt, specific whereabouts unknown. In addition to the Islamic Group, the Jihad factions regard Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman as their spiritual leader. The goal of all Jihad factions is to overthrow the government of President Hosni Mubarak and replace it with an Islamic state.\n\nActivities: The Jihad groups specialize in armed attacks against high-level Egyptian Government officials. The original Jihad was responsible for the 1981 assassination of President Sadat. More recently, the newer Jihad group led by Zawahiri claimed responsibility for the 18 August 1993 bomb attack in Cairo, which wounded Egyptian Interior Minister Hassan al-Alfi and killed five others, and the 25 November 1993 car-bomb attack in Cairo on Prime Minister Sedky; although Sedky was unharmed, a teenage girl was killed and 18 others were injured. Unlike the Islamic Group -- which mainly targets mid- and lower-level security personnel, Coptic Christians, and Western tourists -- the Jihad group appears to concentrate primarily on high-level, high-profile Egyptian Government officials, including cabinet ministers. It also seems more technically sophisticated in its attacks than the al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya -- notably in its use of car bombs.\n\nStrength: Not known, but probably several thousand hardcore members and another several thousand sympathizers among the various factions.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: Operates mainly in the Cairo area. Also appears to have members outside Egypt, probably in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Sudan.\n\nExternal Aid: Not known. The Egyptian Government claims that Iran, Sudan, and militant Islamic groups in Afghanistan support the Jihad factions.\n\nKach and Kahane Chai\n\nDescription: Stated goal of restoring the biblical state of Israel. Kach (founded by radical Israeli-American rabbi Meir Kahane) and its offshoot Kahane Chai, which means \"Kahane Lives,\" (founded by Meir Kahane's son Binyamin following his father's assassination in the United States) were declared to be terrorist organizations on 13 March 1994 by the Israeli Cabinet under the 1948 Terrorism Law. This followed the groups' statements in support of Dr. Baruch Goldstein's 25 February attack on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque -- Goldstein was affiliated with Kach -- and their verbal attacks on the Israeli Government.\n\nActivities: Organize protests against the Israeli Government. Harass and threaten Palestinians in Hebron and the West Bank. Groups have threatened to attack Arabs, Palestinians, and Israeli Government officials. They also claimed responsibility for several shooting attacks on West Bank Palestinians in which four persons were killed and two wounded in 1993.\n\nStrength: Unknown.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: Israel and West Bank settlements, particularly Qiryat Arba in Hebron.\n\nExternal Aid: Receives support from Jewish people in the United States and Europe.\n\nKurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) a.k.a.: Kurdistan Workers' Party\n\nDescription: Marxist-Leninist insurgent group composed of Turkish Kurds established in 1974. In recent years has moved beyond rural-based insurgent activities to include urban terrorism. Seeks to set up an independent Marxist state in southeastern Turkey, where there is a predominantly Kurdish population.\n\nActivities: Primary targets are Turkish Government forces and civilians in eastern Turkey but becoming increasingly active in Western Europe against Turkish targets. Conducted coordinated attacks on Turkish diplomatic and commercial facilities in dozens of West European cities on 24 June and 4 November. In May 1993, began a campaign against Turkish tourism industry and kidnapped 19 Western tourists traveling in eastern Turkey in summer 1993; released all unharmed. Also has bombed tourist sites and hotels.\n\nStrength: Approximately 10,000 to 15,000 full-time guerrillas, 5,000 to 6,000 of whom are in Turkey; 60,000 to 75,000 part-time guerrillas; and hundreds of thousands of sympathizers in Turkey and Europe.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: Operates in Turkey and Western Europe.\n\nExternal Aid: Receives safehaven and modest aid from Syria, Iraq, and Iran.\n\nLautaro Youth Movement (MJL) a.k.a.: The Lautaro faction of the United Popular Action Movement (MAPU/L) or Lautaro Popular Rebel Forces (FRPL)\n\nDescription: Violent, anti-US extremist group that advocates the overthrow of the Chilean Government. Leadership largely from leftist elements but includes criminals and alienated youths. Became active in late 1980s, but has been seriously weakened by government counterterrorist successes in recent years.\n\nActivities: Has been linked to assassinations of policemen, bank robberies, and attacks on Mormon churches.\n\nStrength: Unknown.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: Chile; mainly Santiago.\n\nExternal Aid: None.\n\nThe Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) Other known front organizations: World Tamil Association (WTA), World Tamil Movement (WTM), the Federation of Associations of Canadian Tamils (FACT), the Ellalan Force\n\nDescription: Founded in 1976, the LTTE is the most powerful Tamil group in Sri Lanka and uses overt and illegal methods to raise funds, acquire weapons, and publicize its cause of establishing an independent Tamil state. The LTTE began its armed conflict with the Sri Lankan Government in 1983 and relies on a guerrilla strategy that includes the use of terrorist tactics.\n\nActivities: The Tigers have integrated a battlefield insurgent strategy with a terrorist program that targets not only key personnel in the countryside but also senior Sri Lankan political and military leaders in Colombo. Political assassinations have become commonplace and culminated in May 1993 with the fatal bombing of President Rana-singhe Premadasa. In April 1994, the Ellalan Force claimed credit for setting off three bombs at major tourist hotels in Colombo.\n\nStrength: Approximately 10,000 armed combatants in Sri Lanka; about 3,000 to 6,000 form a trained cadre of fighters. The LTTE also has a significant overseas support structure for fundraising, weapons procurement, and propaganda activities.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: The Tigers control most of the northern and eastern coastal areas of Sri Lanka but have conducted operations throughout the island. Headquartered in the Jaffna peninsula, LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran has established an extensive network of checkpoints and informants to keep track of any ``outsiders'' who enter the group's area of control. The LTTE prefers to attack vulnerable government facilities, then withdraw before reinforcements arrive.\n\nExternal Aid: The LTTE's overt organizations support Tamil separatism by lobbying foreign governments and the United Nations. The LTTE also uses its international contacts to procure weapons, communications, and bomb- making equipment. The LTTE exploits large Tamil communities in North America, Europe, and Asia to obtain funds and supplies for its fighters in Sri Lanka. Information obtained since the mid-1980s indicates that some Tamil communities in Europe are also involved in narcotics smuggling. Tamils historically have served as drug couriers moving narcotics into Europe.\n\nManuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR)\n\nDescription: Original FPMR was founded in 1983 as armed wing of Chilean Communist Party and named for hero of Chile's war of independence against Spain. Group splintered into two factions in late 1980s, one of which became a political party in 1991. The dissident wing FPMR/D is one of Chile's most active terrorist groups.\n\nActivities: The dissident wing (FPMR/D) frequently attacks civilians and international targets, including US businesses and Mormon churches. In 1993, FPMR/D bombed two McDonalds restaurants and attempted to bomb a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant. Successful government counterterrorist operations have significantly undercut organization.\n\nStrength: Now believed to have fewer than 500 members.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: Chile.\n\nExternal Aid: None.\n\nMujahedin-e Khalq Organization (MEK or MKO) a.k.a.: The National Liberation Army of Iran (NLA, the militant wing of the MEK), the People's Mujahedin of Iran (PMOI), National Council of Resistance (NCR), Muslim Iranian Student's Society (front organization used to garner financial support)\n\nDescription: Formed in the 1960s by the college-educated children of Iranian merchants, the MEK sought to counter what is perceived as excessive Western influence in the Shah's regime. In the 1970s, the MEK -- led by Masud Rajavi after 1978 -- concluded that violence was the only way to bring about change in Iran. Since then, the MEK -- following a philosophy that mixes Marxism and Islam -- has developed into the largest and most active armed Iranian dissident group. Its history is studded with anti- Western activity, and, most recently, attacks on the interests of the clerical regime in Iran and abroad.\n\nActivities: The MEK directs a worldwide campaign against the Iranian Government that stresses propaganda and occasionally uses terrorist violence. During the 1970s, the MEK staged terrorist attacks inside Iran to destabilize and embarrass the Shah's regime; the group killed several US military personnel and civilians working on defense projects in Tehran. In 1979 the group supported the takeover of the US Embassy in Tehran. In April 1992, the MEK carried out nearly simultaneous attacks on Iranian embassies in 13 different countries in North America, Europe, and the Pacific Rim. The attacks caused extensive property damage and demonstrated the group's ability to mount large-scale operations overseas. Iran's belief that the MEK was responsible for the bombing of the Mashhad Shrine and subsequent attacks against Iranian oil facilities led Tehran in November 1994 to launch attacks against an MEK base.\n\nStrength: Several thousand fighters based in Iraq with an extensive overseas support structure. Most of the fighters are organized in the MEK's National Liberation Army (NLA).\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: In the 1980s, the MEK's leaders were forced by Iranian security forces to flee to France. Most resettled in Iraq by 1987. Since the mid-1980s, the MEK has not mounted terrorists operations in Iran at a level similar to its activities in the 1970s. Aside from the National Liberation Army's attacks into Iran toward the end of the Iran-Iraq war, and occasional NLA cross-border incursions since, the MEK's attacks on Iran have amounted to little more than harassment. The MEK has had more success in confronting Iranian representatives overseas through propaganda and street demonstrations.\n\nExternal Aid: Beyond support from Iraq, the MEK uses front organizations to solicit contributions from expatriate Iranian communities.\n\nMJL (see Lautaro Youth Movement)\n\nMorazanist Patriotic Front (FPM)\n\nDescription: A radical, leftist terrorist group that first appeared in the late 1980s. Attacks made to protest US intervention in Honduran economic and political affairs.\n\nActivities: Attacks on US, mainly military, personnel in Honduras.

Conducts frequent assaults on oil infrastructure and has inflicted major damage on pipelines since 1986. Extortion and bombings against US and other foreign businesses, especially the petroleum industry.\n\nStrength: Has fallen off in recent years and now estimated at only about 700 combatants.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: Colombia.\n\nExternal Aid: None.\n\nNew People's Army (NPA)\n\nDescription: The guerrilla arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), an avowedly Maoist group formed in December 1969 with the aim of overthrowing the government through protracted guerrilla warfare. Although primarily a rural-based guerrilla group, the NPA has an active urban infrastructure to carry out terrorism; uses city-based assassination squads called sparrow units. Derives most of its funding from contributions of supporters and so-called revolutionary taxes extorted from local businesses.\n\nActivities: The NPA is in disarray because of a split in the CPP, a lack of money, and successful government operations. With the US military gone from the country, NPA has engaged in urban terrorism against the police, corrupt politicians, drug traffickers, and other targets that evoked popular anger. Has vowed to kill US citizens involved in counterinsurgency campaign. Has assassinated 10 US military and private citizens since 1987. Has also attacked US businesses in rural areas that refused to pay so-called revolutionary taxes.\n\nStrength: 16,000, plus support groups.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: Philippines.\n\nExternal Aid: Receives funding from overseas fundraisers in Western Europe and elsewhere; also linked to Libya. Diverts some funding of humanitarian aid.\n\nPalestine Liberation Front (PLF)\n\nDescription: Terrorist group that broke away from the PFLP-GC in mid-1970s. Later split again into pro-PLO, pro-Syrian, and pro-Libyan factions. Pro-PLO faction led by Muhammad Abbas (Abu Abbas), who became member of PLO Executive Committee in 1984 but left it in 1991.\n\nActivities: The Abu AbbasÃ¶led faction carried out abortive seaborne attack staged from Libya against Israel on 30 May 1990. Abbas's group was also responsible for October 1985 attack on the cruise ship Achille Lauro and the murder of US citizen Leon Klinghoffer. A warrant for Abu Abbas's arrest is outstanding in Italy.

Openly supported Iraq during Gulf war.\n\nStrength: At least 50.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: PLO faction based in Tunisia until Achille Lauro attack. Now based in Iraq.\n\nExternal Aid: Receives logistic and military support mainly from PLO, but also from Libya and Iraq.\n\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO)\n\nOn 9 September 1993, in letters to Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst, PLO Chairman Arafat committed the PLO to cease all violence and terrorism. On 13 September 1993, the Declaration of Principles between the Israelis and Palestinians was signed in Washington, DC. Between 9 September and 31 December, the PLO factions loyal to Arafat complied with this commitment except for one, perhaps two, instances in which the responsible individuals apparently acted independently. Two groups under the PLO umbrella, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of PalestineÃ¶Hawatmeh faction (DFLP-H), suspended their participation in the PLO in protest of the agreement and continued their campaign of violence. The US Government continues to monitor closely PLO compliance with its commitment to abandon terrorism and violence.\n\nPalestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)\n\nDescription: The PIJ originated among militant Palestinian fundamentalists in the Gaza Strip during the 1970s. The PIJ is a series of loosely affiliated factions, rather than a cohesive group. The PIJ is committed to the creation of an Islamic Palestinian state and the destruction of Israel through holy war. Because of its strong support for Israel, the United States has been identified as an enemy of the PIJ. The PIJ also opposes moderate Arab governments that it believes have been tainted by Western secularism.\n\nActivities: The PIJ demonstrated its terrorist credentials when it attacked a tour bus in Egypt in February 1990 and killed 11 people, including nine Israelis. The PIJ also has carried out cross-border raids against Israeli targets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The PIJ has threatened to attack US interests in Jordan. PIJ agents were arrested in Egypt in September 1991 while attempting to enter the country to conduct terrorism.\n\nStrength: Unknown.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: Primarily Israel and the occupied territories and other parts of the Middle East, including Jordan and Lebanon. The largest faction is based in Syria.\n\nExternal Aid: Probably receives financial assistance from Iran and possibly some assistance from Syria.\n\nThe Party of Democratic Kampuchea (Khmer Rouge)\n\nDescription: The Khmer Rouge is a Communist insurgency that is trying to destabilize the Cambodian Government. Under Pol Pot's leadership, the Khmer Rouge conducted a campaign of genocide in which more than 1million persons were killed during its four years in power in the late 1970s.\n\nActivities: The Khmer Rouge now is engaged in a low-level insurgency against the Cambodian Government; although its victims are mainly Cambodian villagers, the Khmer Rouge has occasionally kidnapped and killed foreigners, including Westerners, traveling in remote rural areas.\n\nStrength: The Khmer Rouge is made up of approximately 8,000 guerrillas. Location/Area of Operation The Khmer Rouge operates in outlying provinces in Cambodia, particularly in pockets along the Thailand border.\n\nExternal Aid: The Khmer Rouge is not currently receiving external assistance.

After Fatah, it is the most important military and political organization in the Palestinian movement. Advocates a Pan-Arab revolution. Opposes the Declaration of Principles signed in 1993 and has suspended participation in the PLO.\n\nActivities: Committed numerous international terrorist attacks between 1970 and 1977. Since the death in 1978 of Wadi Haddad, its terrorist planner, PFLP has carried out numerous attacks against Israeli or moderate Arab targets.\n\nStrength: 800.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and the occupied territories.\n\nExternal Aid: Receives most of its financial and military assistance from Syria and Libya.\n\nPopular Front for the Liberation of PalestineÃ¶General Command (PFLP-GC)\n\nDescription: Split from the PFLP in 1968, claiming that it wanted to focus more on fighting and less on politics. Violently opposed to Arafat's PLO. Led by Ahmad Jabril, a former captain in the Syrian Army. Closely allied with, supported by, and probably directed by Syria.\n\nActivities: Claims to have specialized in suicide operations. Has carried out numerous cross-border terrorist attacks into Israel, using unusual means, such as hot-air balloons and motorized hang gliders. Hafiz Kassem Dalkamoni, a ranking PFLP-GC official, was convicted in Germany in June 1991 for bombing US troop trains. He faces additional charges in Germany for other terrorist offenses, including manslaughter.\n\nStrength: Several hundred.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: Headquarters in Damascus with bases in Lebanon and cells in Europe.\n\nExternal Aid: Receives logistic and military support from Syria, its chief sponsor.

Formed in the late 1960s by then university professor Abimael Guzman. Stated goal is to destroy existing Peruvian institutions and replace them with peasant revolutionary regime. Also wants to rid Peru of foreign influences. Guzman's capture in September 1992 was a major blow, as were arrests of other SL leaders, defections, and President Fujimori's amnesty program for repentant terrorists.\n\nActivities: SL engages in particularly brutal forms of terrorism, including the indiscriminate use of car bombs. Almost every institution in Peru has been a target of SL violence. Has bombed diplomatic missions of several countries represented in Peru. Carries out bombing campaigns and selective assassinations.

Sikh violence outside India, which surged following the Indian Army's 1984 assault on the Golden Temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine, has decreased significantly since mid-1992, although Sikh militant cells are active internationally and extremists gather funds from overseas Sikh communities. Active groups include Babbar Khalsa, Azad Khalistan Babbar Khalsa Force, Khalistan Liberation Front, and Khalistan Commando Force. Many of these groups operate under umbrella organizations, the most significant of which is the Second Panthic Committee.\n\nActivities: Sikh attacks in India are mounted against Indian officials and facilities, other Sikhs, and Hindus; they include assassinations, bombings, and kidnappings. Sikh extremists probably bombed the Air India jet downed over the Irish Sea in June 1985, killing 329 passengers and crew. On the same day, a bomb planted by Sikhs on an Air India flight from Vancouver exploded in Tokyo's Narita Airport, killing two Japanese baggage handlers. In 1991, Sikh terrorists attempted to assassinate the Indian Ambassador in Romania once India's senior police officer in Punjab from 1986 to 1989 and kidnapped and held the Romanian Charge in New Delhi for seven weeks. In January 1993, Indian police arrested Sikhs in New Delhi as they were conspiring to detonate a bomb to disrupt India's Republic Day, and, in September 1993, Sikh militants attempted to assassinate the Sikh chief of the ruling Congress Party's youth wing with a bomb. Sikh attacks in India, ranging from kidnappings and assassinations to remote-controlled bombings, have dropped markedly since mid-1992, as Indian security forces have killed or captured a host of senior Sikh militant leaders. Total civilian deaths in Punjab have declined more than 95 percent since more than 3,300 civilians died in 1991. The drop results largely from Indian Army, paramilitary, and police successes against extremist groups.\n\nStrength: Unknown.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: Northern India, Western Europe, Southeast Asia, and North America.\n\nExternal Aid: Sikh expatriates have formed a variety of international organizations that lobby for the Sikh cause overseas. Most prominent are the World Sikh Organization and the International Sikh Youth Federation.\n\nTupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA)\n\nDescription: Traditional Marxist-Leninist revolutionary movement formed in 1983.

Objective remains to rid Peru of ``imperialism'' and establish Marxist regime.\n\nActivities: Bombings, kidnappings, ambushes, assassinations. Previously responsible for large number of anti-US attacks; recent activity has dropped off dramatically.\n\nStrength: Unknown; greatly diminished in recent years.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: Peru; provided assistance in Bolivia to Bolivian ELN.\n\nExternal Aid: None.\n\nTupac Katari Guerrilla Army (EGTK)\n\nDescription: Indigenous, anti-Western Bolivian subversive organization.\n\nActivities: Frequently attacks small, unprotected targets, such as power pylons, oil pipelines, and government offices. Has targeted Mormon churches with firebombings and attacked USAID motorpool in January 1993.\n\nStrength: Fewer than 100.\n\nLocation/Area of Operation: Bolivia, primarily the Chapare region, near the Peru border, and the Altiplano.\n\nExternal Aid: None.\n\nAppendix C: Statistical Review\n\n[Editor's Note: Appendixes C and D are not available in this electronic version of the report]\n\nAppendix D: International Terrorist Incidents, 1994\n\n[Editor's Note: Appendixes C and D are not available in this electronic version of the report]\n\nHAMAS Attacks\n\nOperations by the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS) against Israelis in the occupied territories and inside Israel have increased in number and lethality. While most of these incidents, which are aimed at the peace process, do not qualify as \"international terrorism\" and as such do not appear in the statistics in the appendix of this book, they are a very disturbing trend.\n\nHAMAS attacks killed 55 Israelis and wounded more than 130 in 1994, resulting in the highest number of Israeli casualties inside Israel since the intifadah began in 1987:\n\nCar bomb attacks in April on commuter buses in Afula and a bus station in Hadera killed 14 and wounded approximately 75. A bomb on a commuter bus in downtown Tel Aviv in October during the early morning commuter hours killed 22 and wounded at least 48, and a 25 December bomb attack on an Israeli Defense Force (IDF) bus in Jerusalem wounded 12.\n\nHAMAS militants conducted other high-profile attacks that did not involve bombs: a shooting on a busy tourist street in Jerusalem -- a few blocks from the King David Hotel where Secretary of State Warren Christopher was staying -- that killed two and wounded 14, and the kidnapping of IDF Corporal Nachshon Wachsman on the same day. After intense security sweeps by the Israelis and the Palestinian Authority, the kidnappers' hideout was eventually discovered and a rescue attempted on 14 October. During the attempt, Wachsman, another IDF soldier, and three HAMAS personnel were killed. Wachsman held dual US-Israeli citizenship.\n\nThe Movement kept up a steady drumbeat of small-scale attacks during 1994. According to press reports, HAMAS members killed at least 13 IDF soldiers and settlers in small-scale knife attacks, shootings, and at least one ax murder of a female IDF soldier.\n\nHAMAS attacks would have killed even more Israelis during the past year, but several miscarried. According to press reports, at least two HAMAS car bombs exploded prematurely, killing only the bombers. In the 25 December attack, the IDF's bus driver in Jerusalem did not allow the bomber to enter the bus. The bomber detonated the device on the street, killing himself but no passengers, although 12 were injured. [End of Document]\n\nPatterns of Global Terrorism Contents"
