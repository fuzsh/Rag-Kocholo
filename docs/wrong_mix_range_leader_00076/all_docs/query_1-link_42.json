        "text": "In 1979, in relation to understanding the poetry of Shams al-Dīn Muḥammad, known as Ḥāfiẓ-i Shīrāzī, I proposed that in the Ṣūfic sonnets of Ḥāfiz, form was as important as meaning. I also added that when interpreting those pieces one needs more than a mere knowledge of Persian and assistance from medieval and modern dictionaries. Those poems need to be interpreted in the philosophical and/or Ṣūfic contexts in which they have been composed. In that article, and another one called \"Hafiz and the Sufic Ghazal,\" I analyzed four sonnets, each dealing with a particular aspect of the Ṣūfic way of life. In 2008, I used the same technic and argument in presenting an analysis of Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī's \"Az jamādī mordamu nāmī shodam.\" In the analysis of the Ṣūfic poem of ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Jāmī that follows, I intend to follow the same line of argument as in the previous articles and show that like Ḥāfiz and Rūmī, Jāmī, too, expresses his sublime thoughts using powerful Ṣūfic imagery. There is, however, a major difference. In Jāmī content supersedes form. In other words, Jāmī pays more attention to the correct development of the idea that he presents than to the way in which the idea is presented. Thus, while Ḥāfiz's ghazals are memorized and recited as exemplary pieces of poetry by almost everyone in the Persian-speaking world, Jāmī's poetry does not evoke similar reactions. It does, however, leave an indelible mark on the reader who can follow his thoughts."
