        "text": "Quick facts for kids\n\nRepublic of Iraq\n\nMinistry of Defence وزارة الدفاع Department overview Formed\n\n1921; 103 years ago ( )\n\nJurisdiction Government of Iraq Headquarters Green Zone, Baghdad Employees 188,000 (2024) Annual budget $4.1 Billion (2024) Minister responsible\n\nThabet Al Abbasi\n\nWebsite\n\nThe Ministry of Defence (Arabic: وزارة الدفاع العراقية) is the cabinet-level ministry responsible for defence in Iraq. It is also involved with internal security.\n\nAuthority\n\nThe Ministry directs all the Iraqi Armed Forces, comprising a Joint Headquarters, the Iraqi Ground Forces Command (which controls the Army), the Iraqi Special Operations Forces, the Iraqi Army, the Iraqi Navy (including Marines), and the Iraqi Air Force.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Ministry was dissolved by Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 2 of mid-2003. It was formally re-established by CPA Order 67 of 21 March 2004. In the interim period, the CPA Office of Security Affairs served as the de facto Ministry of Defence.\n\nThe Iraqi Counter Terrorism Bureau directs the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Command, which is a further military force answerable to the Prime Minister of Iraq directly. As of 30 June 2009, there had been legislation in progress for a year to make the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Bureau a separate ministry.\n\nMinister of defence\n\nThe position of Minister of Defence became vacant in the previous Iraqi cabinet, approved on 21 December 2010. While it was vacant, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki served as the acting defence minister. Saadoun al-Dulaimi later served as Minister of Defence from 2011 to 2014. Khaled al-Obaidi served as defence minister in the Iraqi cabinet of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. Juma Inad served as defense minister from May 2020 to October of 2022 under the caretaker government of Mustafa al-Kadhimi. Thabet Muhammad Al-Abasi serves as the current minister of defense as of 2022.\n\nThe previous Minister of Defence, Lieutenant General Abd al-Qadr Muhammed Jassim al-Obaidi, is a Sunni career military officer and political independent. He had limited experience and faced a number of hurdles impeding his effective governance. Some of the major problems included inheriting a staff that is notorious for favorism, corruption, and deeply divided along sectarian and ethnic lines. He was a rival of the former Minister of the Interior Jawad al-Bolani, National Security Advisor Muwafaq al-Rubai, and Minister of Staff for National Security Affairs Shirwan al-Waili. He has been criticized for not being able to stand up to the Badr Organization and Mehdi Army members which dominate his own party. In addition, as a Sunni he faced inherent challenges working within a Shiite-dominated government.\n\nOn 19 September 2005, The Independent reported that approximately one billion US dollars have been stolen by top ranking officials from the Ministry of Defence including Hazim al-Shaalan and Ziyad Cattan.\n\nPrevious defence ministers under Saddam Hussein's regime included Ali Hassan al-Majid ('Chemical Ali'). Iraq's first minister of defence was Jafar al-Askari (1920–1922).\n\nList of ministers of defence\n\nKingdom of Iraq (1921–1958)\n\nName Portrait Term of office Political party Prime Minister Jafar al-Askari 23 October 1920 16 November 1922 Abd Al-Rahman Al-Gillani Nuri as-Said 20 November 1922 2 August 1924 Yasin al-Hashimi 2 August 1924 2 June 1925 Nuri as-Said 26 June 1925 8 January 1928 Abd al-Muhsin as-Sa'dun 14 January 1928 20 January 1929 Muhammad Amin Zaki 28 April 1929 25 August 1929 Nuri al-Sa’id 19 September 1929 19 March 1930 Jafar al-Askari 23 March 1930 27 October 1932 Rashid al-Khawja 3 November 1932 18 March 1933 Jalal Baban 20 March 1933 28 October 1933\n\nIraqi Republic (1958–1968)\n\nName Portrait Term of office Political party President Abd al-Karim Qasim 14 July 1958 8 February 1963 Independent Muhammad Najib ar-Ruba'i Salah Mahdi Ammash 8 February 1963 10 November 1963 Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region) Abdul Salam Arif Hardan al-Tikriti 10 November 1963 2 March 1964 Tahir Yahya 2 March 1964 3 September 1965 Arab Socialist Union Arif Abd ar-Razzaq 6 September 1965 16 September 1965 Arab Socialist Union Abd al-'Aziz al-'Uqaili 21 September 1965 18 April 1966 Shakir Mahmud Shukri 18 April 1966 17 July 1968 Abdul Rahman Arif\n\nBa'athist Iraq (1968–2003)\n\nName Portrait Term of office Political party President Ibrahim Abdel Rahman Dawoud 17 July 1968 30 July 1968 Independent Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr Hardan al-Tikriti 30 July 1968 April 1970 Iraqi Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region) Hammad Shihab April 1970 30 June 1973 Iraqi Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region) Abdullah al-Khadduri (acting) 30 June 1973 11 November 1974 Iraqi Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region) Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr 11 November 1974 15 October 1977 Iraqi Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region) Adnan Khairallah 15 October 1977 4 May 1989 Iraqi Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region) Saddam Hussein Abdul Jabbar Khalil Shanshal 4 May 1989 1990 Iraqi Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region) Saadi Toma 12 December 1990 6 April 1991 Iraqi Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region) Ali Hassan al-Majid 1991 1995 Iraqi Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region) Sultan Hashim 1995 2003 Iraqi Ba'ath Party\n\n(Iraq Region)\n\nRepublic of Iraq (2004–present)"
