        "text": "After an incredible three years working at the National Maritime Academy, the time has come for me to move on to my next opportunity. My time at NMA has been challenging but hugely rewarding. From moving continents in the middle of the COVID pandemic, quarantining for nearly a month, to speaking at several conferences to promote the importance of the maritime sector. The NMA has achieved so much as a team; from a few empty buildings, it has transformed into a thriving learning community with state-of-the-art facilities and international accreditations. It has been an absolute privilege to lead the team, and I am leaving full with a sense of achievement and pride that the team is in a great place to continue the transformative work. Special thanks must go to Turki A. for his vision and leadership in facilitating the NMA and leading the academy to where it is today, and to Dleep Fotedar - after almost a decade of working together, it will undoubtedly be strange not seeing you in the office! Also, a special thank you to all the team members I have had the privilege of working with over the past three years; your hospitality, professionalism and commitment to our students has blown me away. Finally, for some of the students who took my advice and created their LinkedIn accounts! You have been the crucial ingredient to making the NMA what it is today. Be proud of your achievements, keep learning and thrive in the industry. And with that - I am clocking out of NMA and BAE for the last time and off to the airport for my flight back to the UK, ready to start my new job on Monday!
