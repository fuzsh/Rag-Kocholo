        "text": "7\n\nCompeting Views of Pashtun Tribalism, Islam, and Society in the Indo-Afghan Borderlands\n\nSana Haroon\n\nIn 1914, Husayn Ahmad Madani (1879–1957) and ‘Ubaydullah Sindhi (1872–1944), two members of the Dar al-‘Ulum madrasa, at Deoband, in northern India, proposed that the Pashtun tribe represented the ideal of a Muslim society and could steer the fate of the Indian Muslim nation. They called for a jihad in the Indian northwest supported both by nationalist Indians and members of the Afghan court. Although it received a great deal of attention from the colonial authorities, this short-lived movement failed to accomplish anything. Moreover, through attention to treatment of the principle of tribalism in other vernacular Urdu and Persian texts, this chapter argues that the view of the tribe as a model for the Muslim nation as proposed in Jama‘at-i Mujahidin politics and in historiography was completely incompatible both with the participatory nationalist political discourses in the North-West Frontier Province of colonial India and with the Afghan nationalist project of knowledge production. This fact would be unexceptional were it not for that fact that the idea of Pashtun Islamic tribal valor was resuscitated subsequently during the 1978–85 mobilization of anti-Soviet resistance. Because of this aftermath of the Jama‘at-i Mujahidin movement, it is useful to consider the inadequacies of the movement and the counternarratives to the idea of Islamic religiosity and valor as foundational principles of tribal order in the Pashtun highlands, both in the Jama‘at-i Mujahidin’s own time and in the later twentieth century.\n\nA growing body of scholarly work identifies multiple coexistent patterns of Pashtun social and political organization in the Indo-Afghan borderlands, meaningfully complicating binary views of tribe and the state in eastern Afghanistan, and the role of religion in shaping a social order. I have argued in an early work that the definition and organization of community in the Pashtun region east of the Durand Line and the work of religious leaders among them were inextricably intertwined with the colonial cartographic demarcation of a military frontier.1 Magnus Marsden and Benjamin Hopkins’s Fragments of the Afghan Frontier knits together ethnographic and historical accounts of the frontier region, on both sides of the Durand Line, to argue that the region is marked by fluidity and that its strategic significance was conceptualized, actualized, and experienced in a variety of ways through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.2 In a study of contemporary aspects of the Pashtun Question, Abubakar Siddique has argued that the lack of incorporation of Pashtuns into the economic and political fabric of the state has fostered religious extremism in the region.3 In this volume, Faridullah Bezhan has argued that from the first half of the twentieth century, the Awaken Youth Party rejected tribal politics and sought to unify a following among the eastern Pashtuns by appealing to shared ethnolinguistic priorities.\n\nLineage-based organization and religious authority coexisted and competed with other patterns of social organization and were selectively invoked by political actors and statesmen on either side of the Durand Line over the course of the twentieth century. This chapter usefully explores the use of the idea of tribal Pashtuns as lineage clans loyal to each other and to the instructions of their religious leaders, so-called Islamic tribes, in twentieth-century texts as an instrumentalist recognition of nonrepresentative authority. The instrumentalist use of this idea is exemplified through contrast with considerations of tribal organization and subjecthood in other Indian religiopolitical texts and in some Afghan texts exploring the geography of the Afghan state.\n\nANTI-COLONIAL POLITICS AND THE VALORIZATION OF THE PASHTUN TRIBE\n\nInspired by nationalist ideals, in 1915 several members of the Dar al-‘Ulum Deoband, Mahmud al-Hasan and three of his students—Husayn Ahmad Madani, ‘Ubaydullah Sindhi, and Muhammad Miyan—initiated the frontier-based Jama‘at-i Mujahidin movement. Its aim was to finance and organize militant activity in the North-West Frontier Province of colonial India in order to destabilize the British Indian Government and provide a convenient point for the Ottoman army to open a new front against the British during World War I.4 ‘Ubaydullah Sindhi argued that a struggle based on ittihad-i Islam (unification of Islam) was the only thing that could truly liberate India.5 This was the base that ‘Ubaydullah Sindhi had argued was essential for any Islamic intellectual or religious movement, a center of military organization from which a political and religious agenda could be promoted.6 Such unifying organization could not be carried out or administered in India proper because of the effectiveness of the British colonial intelligence system, and so the Deobandis took their Jama‘at-i Mujahidin movement to the nonadministered Tribal Areas of the Indo-Afghan frontier, the region that they referred as Yaghistan, or “Land of the Free.”\n\nParticipants in the movement of the Jama’at-i Mujahidin saw themselves as closely connected to the political and social ambitions of Sayyid Ahmad Barelwi (1786–1831) and hence also to the Pashtuns and to the frontier region in general.7 Madani explained that “the revolutionary party based on Shah Waliullah’s and ‘Abd al-‘Aziz’s instruction and command was finally born in the nineteenth century through the splendor of Sayyid Ahmad Barelwi and his Jama‘at (organization).”8 The significance of the new movement was both intellectual and geographic. The historical importance of the suba-yi sarhad (frontier province), as Madani referred to it, was that it was a space within which post-Mughal Indian Islam had made important political advances in working toward a free Muslim region. Thus, Sayyid Ahmad’s jihad in the late 1820s and early 1830s was intended to reclaim a space and dignity for the practice of the Muslim faith.9 Madani particularly pointed out that this program had Hindustan-centered and anti-British concerns; it was not anti-Hindu. He emphasized that the movement had included Hindus and that the jihad was directed against the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh (r. 1801–39), only insofar as Ranjit Singh was an extension of the East India Company’s power and influence.10 His concluding statement on the movement was that “the primary motive of this Jama‘at was to remove foreigners from ‘Hindustan’ and to establish a democratic rule in the country.”11 The historical casting of the sarhad (frontier) as a region where Islam itself had a tremendous potential to mobilize and lead formed the essential counterpart to the Mahmud Ghazniesque view of the frontier as an entry point for Islam. Deobandi historiography cast the Pashtun region (and specifically what were later dubbed the Tribal Areas) as a Muslim political space and saw the region as an integral part of the development of the ideas of the eighteenth-century Delhi Naqshbandi Sufi, Shah Waliullah (d. 1762).\n\nTwentieth-century members of the Jama‘at-i Mujahidin stressed the religious character of the Pashtun people in the Tribal Areas. Muhammad ‘Ali Kasuri wrote that the Pashtuns were true Muslims, and in their country women could walk unafraid as no man would even raise his eyes to look at them. He argued that there was no need for police or a judiciary as crime was dealt with immediately and justly by the village-level councils (panchayats), tribal social and political institutions.12 This brought the Tribal Areas close to the ideal of civilization and community expressed in the Prophet Muhammad’s time in Arabia. Kasuri said that the village councils (panchayat) expressed and pursued religious ideals, keeping an Islamic structure intact.13 This idea was widely shared. In a letter to Mawlana Mahmud al-Hasan, one of his deputies on the frontier calling himself the Bukhari Mulla declared:14\n\nThe people of this country resemble the tribes of Arabia in their qualities of enduring hardships and of independence and brotherhood. These people are, of course, afraid of being branded as kafirs (infidels). If a mullah (mawlawi) were to tell them that they would become kafirs if they did a certain thing, they would never go near it. The influence of the clerics (‘ulama) and shaykhs is due mainly to these characteristics.\n\nLikening the Pashtuns to the people of Arabia, the Bukhari Mulla suggested that the structure of tribalism was a basic and sturdy model of social organization—the Pashtuns were both independent, yet committed to principles of brotherhood. This structure made them more devoted to their religious leaders, which in turn promoted more effective religious values and priorities.\n\nMost importantly, the tribe was lauded as a functional military unit, as “stable as the mountains” themselves.15 The military strategy of the Jama‘at-i Mujahidin required that religious and tribal leaders bring small lashkars (militias) into battle with the British. The Al-Mujahid newspaper called for the Muhmand, Wazir, Mahsud, Afridi, Swati, and all their clans and tribes to mobilize in support of one another.16 It was argued that it was only through such a compact between the ethnically connected segmentary groups that the structural and governmental independence of all could be achieved. During the British campaigns in the Afridi Khajuri Plains, near the Afghan border, in 1931, an editorial in the Al-Mujahid newspaper articulated an expectation of such combined military action by the frontier tribes who would launch on “ghaza [raids] and jihad on the border and in India.”17 So affiliated, the Pashtuns of the Tribal Areas and Administered Districts were two separate “bodies, with one life in them.”18\n\nDeobandi historical writings associated tribal Pashtuns with the passage of entry into India and its natural enclosure. ‘Ubaydullah Sindhi outlined the historical significance of the Tribal Areas and the Pashtuns that inhabited them in the Zati Da’iri. These, he said, were the pahari qawms, mountain nations, that had accepted Islam and aided Mahmud Ghazni (r. 998–1030) on his incursions into India.19 Sindhi highlighted this particular region as an area distinct from Afghanistan and from the Pashtun communities south and east of the Peshawar Valley. Sindhi implied that as pahari, mountain people, these Pashtuns had a distinct ethos that separated them from Pashtuns in the lowlands east and west of them. Furthermore, these people had accepted Islam later than the Afghan Pashtun communities—in fact they had accepted Islam as a result of Mahmud Ghazni’s passage through the mountains and into India. This description had two implications: first, that these Pashtuns were a community by virtue of their altitudinal situation; second, that the Pashtun history in the Tribal Areas was directly linked to the narrative of an Indian Muslim past in India.20\n\nMahmud al-Rahman Sahib Nadwi, who as a writer of the history of Hind (India) styled himself after the famous colonial Indian historian Sir Jadunath Sarkar (1870–1958), explained the Khyber region as the meeting point of the Indian and Afghan kingdoms.21 The areas east of Ghazni, Peshawar, and Kohat had been under the rule of a Lahore-based raja until the Samanid governor Alaptagin (r. 961–68) extended Afghan control over them. A long, drawn-out battle ensued that kept pushing the frontier between the Muslims and the Hindus back and forth between the mountains and the river Indus. The battle ended unresolved as the weather changed and both the mountains and the river Indus became uncrossable, leaving the people of the area in-between azad, free, and khud mukhtar, self-governing.22 In this narrative, the Pashtun region between India and Afghanistan could be understood only as a social and a political frontier—an area whose national belonging and imperial affiliation were contested by virtue of its geographical location.\n\nAs the furthest northwestern reach of the Indian subcontinent, the North-West Frontier Province was depicted as a point of entry of Islam into the subcontinent and as the location of the clash between the Hindu and the Muslim empires of old. Nadwi also posited the idea of an Afghan state against a Hindustani state—a theme that underlay the majority of twentieth-century historical accounts of the incursions into India of Mahmud Ghazni, whether in Urdu, Hindi, or English.23 The Pashtun tribes occupied the liminal space between the two monoliths, unconcerned by the politics of Delhi or Kabul; they were people of the mountains. The casting of Pashtuns in such ways assuaged nationalist insecurities about the shape and coherence of the polity they sought to liberate.24 The narratives of the past proposed by the Deobandis were in this way premised on contemporaneous concerns about the modern state and social identity and established the extent of the nationalist imagination. Like Indian politics, Indian historiography was not an evenly disciplined field but contested ground on which battles were fought over authenticity and validity.25 Articulations of historicity, the transmission of even contested knowledge, had the potential to reassure a community, establishing its past, its present, and its posterity.26\n\nThe representation of the tribe as separate and distinct from settled society supported the military ambitions of the Jama‘at-i Mujahidin, who were preparing to liberate India through an invasion from the northwest. The Jama‘at participated in and supported the mobilizations of lashkars (militias), which were deployed alternately in support of the Afghan king, in resolution of local disputes, or in a few instances, in attacks on colonial installations or across the administered border.27 Members of the Jama‘at-i Mujahidin left India and made their way to Afghanistan, where they could operate in relative security; in Afghanistan, Muhammad ‘Ali Kasuri said, people would not look at him suspiciously when he talked about ‘Islami millat, Islami shari‘a, or Islami ukhuwwat (Islamic nation, Islamic law, Islamic brotherhood)’.28 Members of the Jama‘at-i Mujahidin received stipends and a hearing at the court and found positions as editors, teachers. and civil servants. Another among them, Hajji ‘Abd al-Razzaq, had moved to Jalalabad in 1916 and quickly won favor with Sardar Nasrullah Khan, the brother of Afghanistan’s ruler, Amir Habibullah Khan (r. 1901–19), and then with Amanullah Khan (r. 1919–29) on his ascendance to the Afghan throne. During the war of 1919, Amanullah Khan deputed ‘Abd al-Razzaq to organize an “army of the north-west frontiers of the samt-i mashriqi [eastern side]. Concerning the [manner of] union of the heads and chiefs of Dir, Swat, Chitral, and others around that area, we leave the matter entirely to your judgment.”29 By charging Razzaq with arranging a military front within the Tribal Areas, Amanullah avoided the appearance of rejecting the Durand Line. He cautioned ‘Abd al-Razzaq to “consider the welfare of [his] faith and [his] government: but to initiate the ittihad (unity) in his own right.30\n\nAnother member of the group, Sayf al-Rahman, was involved in quite a different capacity in Afghanistan. He had moved to Kabul in 1914 after spending a year in Swat, Buner, and Bajaur with the Jama‘at-i Mujahidin at Mahmud al-Hasan’s command.31 The earliest document in his personal papers is a translation of a proclamation for distribution in Afghanistan decrying the Russian expansionism and calling for a jihad to protect the Ka’ba, the Ottoman Caliphate, and for the unity of all Muslims.32 Sayf al-Rahman had been personally approved and honored by Amir Habib al-Rahman in 1918 by a firman (order) inviting him to reside with the mustawfi al-mamalik (finance minister) at Jalalabad and granting him a personal cash allowance of nine hundred Kabuli rupees.33 The ruler Habibullah Khan treated Sayf al-Rahman as another of the line of Indian-educated scholars already residing in Afghanistan. In 1919, after Habibullah’s overthrow, his successor Amanullah Khan issued another royal firman granting Sayf al-Rahman and his brother and sister a “house, garden, and cultivating lands” under a three-year tax exemption. In return, Amanullah expected that Sayf al-Rahman and his brother would “pray for the [Afghan] government and employ themselves in aiding/assisting the government.”34 A subsequent firman in the same year, 1919, added an allowance of four thousand rupees.35 Amanullah Khan went on to appoint Sayf al-Rahman to the position of qazi-yi askari (military judge) and brigadier in 1919 and subsequently to the bench of the Kabul high court in 1922.36 The Afghan ruler patronized Sayf al-Rahman as an Indian-educated religious scholar with little suggestion that he had any interest in his Indian nationalist aspirations. Rather, he looked to the Deobandi scholar to help formulate and put in place a new order that centered on administrative, military, and legal reform in Afghanistan. Sayf al-Rahman’s work in Kabul served the Afghan nationalist cause, and although he remained nostalgic for India, he lived out his career in Afghanistan as a servant of the state, supporting state building and centralization rather than a policy of tribal mobilization.37\n\nAs Sayf al-Rahman’s career trajectory suggests, the Jama‘at-i Mujahidin was not a long-lived movement. In India, some of its leaders were incarcerated during World War I, while others dispersed during or shortly after 1919. ‘Ubaydullah Sindhi eventually drifted back to Sindh, where he set up a madrasa and continued writing on his understanding of Islamic revivalism. After the overthrow and exile of King Amanullah Khan in 1929, his successor Nadir Shah (r. 1929–33) continued occasional payments to the Mulla Chaknawari, Hajji Turangza’i, and other Indian or border-area religious figures who presented themselves at the Kabul court after 1931. Later, after the foundation of Pakistan in 1947, the Kabul government used links to the religious leaders in Pakistan’s Tribal Areas to fuel the Pashtunistan secessionist movement.38 Badshah Gul of the Pakistan-side Muhmand areas publicly parted ways with the government and sought support and safety at the Kabul court.39 Meanwhile, the so-called Fakir of Ipi Mirza ‘Ali Khan (1897–1960) was reported to have been provided with a printing press by the Afghan government and maintained a headquarters of the Pashtunistan movement in Wana.40 But overall, Amanullah Khan’s careful and uncommitted patronage of the Jama‘at-i Mujahidin’s networks, military strategy, and intellectual contributions demonstrates the lack of utility of both their conceptual and their strategic approach to engagement with the Pashtun lineage groups through religious authoritative figures. Subsequent development of political discourses in colonial India and in Afghanistan suggest how far outside the realm of Indian and Afghan normative politics and social-scientific thinking this proposition really was.\n\nNATIONALIST DISCOURSES IN COLONIAL NWFP\n\nAfter the reforms of 1919 that extended the remit of participatory politics by constituting legislative councils and broadening the franchise, two new political movements gained prominence in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP). These were the Jam‘iyyat al-‘Ulama-yi Hind (an organization of religious scholars largely from the Dar al-‘Ulum seminary at Deoband) and the Khuda’i Khidmatgar (the frontier branch of Gandhi’s Congress Party).41 Emerging out of a participatory political arena, neither organization could accommodate the notional construct of the tribe as a social model, as proposed by the Jama‘at-i Mujahidin, with their political outlook. Their vernacular adaptation of the discourse of tribalism perpetuated the political exclusion of the so-called tribal population from representative politics.\n\nIn 1927, NWFP-based supporters of the Khilafat movement to support the Otttoman Empire invited the Jam‘iyyat al-‘Ulama-yi Hind to hold its annual meeting in Peshawar. This meeting marked the inception of a formal Jam‘iyyat al-’Ulama presence and concern in the frontier region. The Jam‘iyyat al-‘Ulama-yi Hind’s concerns with the sarhad (frontier) were described in the Muslim Outlook newspaper as being a desire to counter “the wicked indifference of the bureaucracy in extending reforms to the NWFP” and to bring this Muslim-majority province into the mainframe of the emerging Indian (Hindustani) nationalism.42 Motivated by both a concern for mobilizing the Muslims of India and the greater anticolonial Indian nationalist cause, the Jam‘iyyat al-‘Ulama-yi Hind sought to secure Muslim presence in the emerging political space and devolution of powers within India. It championed the cause for separate electorates, as well as the extension of reforms to Muslim-majority provinces, positing the clerics (‘ulama) as the natural and appropriate leadership for India’s Muslims. The Jam‘iyyat al-‘Ulama-yi Hind looked to Muslims to express their piety in their legal subjecthood and civil conduct.\n\nMawlawi Anwar Shah’s presidential address in 1927 broadly addressed the political state of affairs in the NWFP, a statement that can be read to define the Jam‘iyyat al- ‘Ulama-yi Hind’s primary political objectives and envisioning of the province. He described the Muslims of the frontier as part of a greater Muslim baradari or fraternity, a concept that had been proposed by ‘Ubaydullah Sindhi and Husayn Ahmad Madani in their considerations of India’s Muslim community. Mawlawi Anwar Shah believed that the British government undermined the social interests of the Pashtuns by treating the sarhad or frontier as a line of defense around India and trying to subjugate the Pashtuns in the interests of security within Hindustan. He argued that this marginalization had to be corrected by bringing the sarhad into the mainframe of political processes and by benefiting from the political reforms enacted elsewhere in India. However, he cited the colonial geography of India to separate Afghanistan from the North-West Frontier Province and include it as part of the greater Hindustani (or Indian) political world.43 He once again quoted the committee report that described the frontier as a fully legitimate and complete province of India, delimited by “nature, which has built a wall between Hindustan and extraterritorial invaders.”44 Imperial defense concerns influenced the Jam‘iyyat al- ‘Ulama-yi Hind’s approach to the Pashtun question.\n\nThe Jam‘iyyat al- ‘Ulama-yi Hind’s approach appears to have taken much from ‘Ubaydullah Sindhi and Husayn Ahmad Madani’s conceptualization of Pashtun qawmiyat (here, nationalism). But it departed from this earlier discourse of Pashtun participation in the anticolonial movement on one crucial point: the extent of the NWFP. While Sindhi and Madani had firmly and necessarily understood the Tribal Areas to be part of the Hindustani-Pashtun political arena, basing the movement of the Jama‘at-i Mujahidin there and describing the tribe as an ideal social unit, Anwar Shah nonetheless described the qaba’ili or tribal appendage of the NWFP as an unjustified burden on the province and its resources. He believed that the government would do better to allocate NWFP tax remittances to the reform scheme and the costs of a legislative council. He considered it necessary that the British allowed the “independent tribes” the chance to progress in peace and security but described this as a relationship of mutual benefit between what he referred to as the sarhad-i Hind (frontier of India) and the azad qaba’il (independent tribes) as two exclusive and separate formations, the former of which was at a higher stage of social, civilizational, economic, and political development than the latter.45 Anwar Shah did not preclude the incorporation of the Tribal Areas into the more progressive Pashtun regions, rather suggesting that this ought to and would come about gradually.\n\nAnwar Shah’s position emerged from reflection on the cultural and social dissimilarities between the so-called tribal Pashtuns and those of the settled district, the same sort of thinking that had underpinned the proposals for basing the movement of the Jama‘at-i Mujahidin in the Tribal Areas. Working for coherence and mobilization of a Muslim electoral base, he could not accommodate the principle of tribal hierarchy and informal dispute resolution into the Jam‘iyyat al-‘Ulama-yi Hind’s political agenda; nor could he propose the sort of cultural and political reform in the region that would displace the authority of and make enemies of the khans or the religious leaders who extended moral support to the Jam‘iyyat al-‘Ulama-yi Hind’s agenda. Despite the religious underpinnings of the Jama‘at-i Mujahidin’s acknowledgment of the Pashtun tribe, the Jam‘iyyat al-‘Ulama-yi Hind’s politics was essentially incompatible with the principle of cultural difference.\n\nFounded in 1929 in the context of Indian anticolonial liberation, the Khuda’i Khidmatgar (Servants of God, also known as the Red Shirts) was a Congress-affiliated movement conceived as a nonviolent campaign of civil disobedience with a view to attaining self-government. Along with their leader Khan ‘Abd al-Ghaffar Khan of Utmanza’i (1890–1988), the Khuda’i Khidmatgar has attracted a lot of scholarly attention for what has been perceived as a cultural anomaly: the use of nonviolence to realize a Pashtun nationhood whose cultural code is rooted in principles of violent retaliation and retribution. Ghaffar Khan was at first closely involved with efforts to reform the local educational system by setting up independent schools as alternatives to British missionary schools.46 These concerns and personal acquaintances led Ghaffar Khan to participate in the early years of Mahmud al-Hasan’s tahrik (movement). Yet Ghaffar Khan later came to cleanly separate tribal politics mobilized by religious leaders from settled district politics. They came together in purpose but not in the structure of authority and leadership.\n\nGhaffar Khan accused the mullahs of the Tribal Areas of not having been able to set up madrasas, promote dialogue, or create consensus among the fragmented tribal groups of the region. The dispersed resistance of the Tribal Areas had not been integrated and cultivated by the Mujahidin movement into a more relevant and general political ideology and because a national unity did not emerge within the region, the British were triumphant in further dividing and ruling the weak qaba’ili (tribal) groups.47 For this reason, Ghaffar Khan said that it was impossible to integrate the politics of the Tribal Areas and the Administered Districts, as the Tribal Areas had little potential for social and political mobilization around a philosophy of social development, statehood, and self-government. He wrote:48\n\nWhen I saw the conditions of Afghanistan and the azad qaba’il [independent tribes], having spent fifteen years running to and fro between Hindustan, the azad qaba’il, and Afghanistan, I reached the conclusion that a revolution is not a quick process, nor is it so easy a task. A revolution is carried out with a cool heart; it requires knowledge and intellectualism. For a revolution we need scholars and intellectuals who can convince the people and bring them to the revolution... our qawm has no interest in economics, industry, agriculture, or education, and in addition is immersed up to its neck in custom and ritual, is occupied in the realm of militancy. Such a qawm cannot conceive a revolutionary spirit. First they must be liberated from these distractions [masatib], then a political consciousness must be created.\n\nBoth the Khuda’i Khidmatgar and the Jam‘iyyat al-‘Ulama-yi Hind were deeply invested in electoral practices and participation in bureaucracy and legislature as a means of realizing an anticolonial ambition and saw the integration of the Tribal Areas and Administered Districts political landscapes was impossible within the practitional and discursive parameters of this emerging nationalism. This reluctance demonstrates the inclination to separation of political spheres along the line of authoritative leadership. Rather than a cultural delimitation, this was a structural containment of nationalism that largely relied on the message of self-discipline, class-consciousness, and a deeply individualized identity mobilized through the press and participatory politics. Neither the Jam‘iyyat al-‘Ulama-yi Hind nor Ghaffar Khan saw a way to introduce their objectives of individualism, the cornerstone of political modernity, in the Tribal Areas as they saw the underlying pattern of mullah-led politics as irreconcilable with a settled-districts social order. Despite the religious and ethnic basis of their respective politics, they reaffirmed the cultural distinction between tribal and settled society in proposals for political reform and representative politics in the NWFP.\n\nThrough the period 1919–47, Pashtun political thinkers in colonial India described the tribal Pashtuns of the frontier region as backward, poor, and unequal to the national project because of the problem of administrative and social isolation of the Tribal Areas. The Jam‘iyyat al-‘Ulama-yi Hind was cautious about the lack of exposure of the Tribal-Areas Pashtuns to the political process, and Khan ‘Abd al-Ghaffar Khan argued that the true revolutionary spirit was dependent on education and political and economic participation.\n\nGEOGRAPHIES OF AFGHANISTAN AND THE PASHTUN TRIBE\n\nWriting in the 1970s, the American scholar Leon Poullada argued that center-tribe relations were a foundational, albeit unstable, strategy of the modern Afghan state.49 This view was later endorsed by Thomas Barfield in his recent assessment of twentieth-century Afghan history as marked by tribal resistance. Barfield points, for example, to the creation of a Ministry of Tribal Affairs and strategies of conciliation through exemption of powerful tribes from military conscription as indicative of the state’s conciliatory approach to the tribal political formation.50 A variety of studies of late-nineteenth- and twentieth-century Afghanistan, including Amin Tarzi’s and Faridullah Bezhan’s chapters in this volume, have shown us that despite official strategies of conciliation, the discourse of the tribal social formation was not so stable as we may suppose. This section explores the ambivalence around the notion of the tribe in state-produced geographies.\n\nAmin Tarzi’s chapter on Amir ‘Abd al-Rahman takes a critical look at the ruler’s identification and treatment of the Yaghistan, the regions outside direct government control. State control of communities in this region, most significant among them the Hazara, was rationalized and manifested through Islamic law. Tarzi demonstrates that ‘Abd al-Rahman institutionalized Hanafi Islam as the official state doctrine and used this to discipline dissenters, but he also admitted customary law and social practice, which remained the dominant system of dispute resolution. Religious propaganda and Islamic courts were instruments of such state control of communities that lay outside the ambit of governance, and with them, dominant patriarchal structures. Tribal community and religious principle, far from being demonstrably self-sustaining, were bolstered by the state in Yaghistan.\n\nJames Caron has called for attention to the underlying coercive relationship of the monarchy with rural elders, complicating the view of tribal conciliation to draw necessary attention to a social history of Afghanistan that does not rely on a narrative of resistance, rebellion, and modernization, or on the notional construct of the tribe.51 Such recommendations are reiterated in Christine Noelle-Karimi’s reflections on the limitations of the project of historicizing polities with regard to the writing of the history of Afghanistan.52 There is increasing evidence presented in recent histories that historical change was effected in twentieth-century Afghan history by technology, trade, and intellectualisms, and not by a resurgent Islamist tribal ethos.53 So-called tribal Pashtuns visited and lived with family and friends, or resided for part of the year in their own summer homes in Peshawar, Bannu, Kohat, Kabul, and Qandahar. Others married and settled in Indian and Pakistani cities such as Bhopal, Jalandhar, Bareilly, and Lahore.54 From the 1930s or ’40s, Pashtuns from the eastern part of Afghanistan or the western, nonadministered, portion of the Indian frontier also used lithograph presses to reproduce poetry and memoirs, writing about class oppression, economic marginalization, and profiteering.55 As mobile merchants, they traded in spices, ceramic goods, ammunition, sugar, wheat, silk, and currency.\n\nIn keeping with this trajectory of increasingly critical thinking about the relations of tribe and state, this section proposes a different point of comparison to understand the context of King Habibullah and King Amanullah’s engagement with the movement of the Jama’at-i Mujahidin: the production of geographies of Afghanistan. A number of texts, recently made available through the New York University Afghan Digital Library Project, support interrogation of the early-twentieth-century Afghan state’s official use of the discourse of tribalism. In these texts, military advantages of tribal organization were acknowledged, but the idea that the tribe could independently derive a social order from Islam was indirectly disputed.\n\nDuring his reign, from 1919 to 1929, Amanullah Khan directed the machinery of state into a full-scale effort at what Leon Poullada termed reform and modernization. Amanullah built up a bureaucracy, funded secondary and postsecondary education, supported the print press, and looked to overhaul the military and increase recruitment there. Between 1929 and 1978, Afghanistan’s ruling Musahiban dynasty continued to experiment with strategies of economic, military, and social reform. A new cotton-export industry was established in Kunduz in the north, the domestic tax burden was lowered and supplemented with foreign aid, and women of noble families appeared unveiled. Recently, Thomas Barfield has noted that the government was able to mediate domestic expectations and foreign influence in a manner that none of its rivals were ever able to, but Barfield has also indicated the complete inadequacy of these reforms, and has argued that the Musahiban dynasty began to decline by 1962.56 It is widely accepted that despite the state-sponsored modernization projects of the twentieth century, Afghan governments still had to contend with the remoteness of many regions throughout the country, the fact that much of the country still lived on a subsistence economy, and that government authority was limited by the radio and printing press that provided access to the population.\n\nGeography textbooks were written in Persian to support the introduction of the subject in schools. The textbooks represented Afghanistan as a contiguous, bordered, governable, and productive economic space through descriptions of land, region, resources, and physical geography, administrative centers, and human geography. Each author used a different approach and language to describe the spatial, administrative, and social organization of Afghanistan but consistently represented the provincial divisions and administration as foundational principles of regional organization. Each text discussed lineage groups and accounted for famous or important tribes in some way, often with reference to their historic significance. But their discussions were not fleshed out through reference to authority, culture, or custom in a manner that defined how patrilineal authority was an organizing social principle.\n\nThe earliest of these texts, entitled simply Afghanistan, was written by the leading Afghan nationalist thinker and future foreign minister, Mahmud Tarzi (1865–1933). Published in 1903, the Persian text briefly described each of Afghanistan’s provinces, major cities, and natural resources. It also included a poetic tract on the geography of the country:\n\nFirst know that this is the place of origin of our great tribe.\n\nThe tribe that is the tribe of great king,\n\nThe name of the tribe, tribe, Muhammadza’i.\n\nCenturies ago, when it was a commanding headquarter,\n\nThe caretaker of Qandahar was Ahmad Shah Durrani.\n\nHe was a great king, known for greatness.\n\nHe established the Afghan government in Qandahar,\n\nAnd expanded it to Hind and Sind.\n\nIn comparison to the varied people of Herat, with different aspects, opinions, races, and tribes, Tarzi described the Muhammadza’i tribe (qawm) as the base of command of Ahmad Shah Durrani (r. 1747–72), who established the Afghan government in Qandahar and, as the poem states, expanded it to India and Sind.57 In this rendering, the southern Pashtun tribe was the platform from which Abdali operated, while the Afghan state (even at its moment of inception) was the source of organization and political priority. Tarzi went on to speak to the glory of the capital: “Kabulistan was the name of this land.... Kabul was the capital of the government; Kabul was the pride of the nation; Kabul was and is what Islam anticipated.”58 While acknowledging a military logic to the tribal order, Tarzi asserted that the source of governance and Islam, implying law and legitimacy, could emanate only from Kabul.\n\nA second such Persian text, Jughrafiya-yi Afghanistan (Geography of Afghanistan), was written by Muhammad Husayn and published in Kabul in 1923. It provided a detailed breakdown of provinces, their physical features, natural resources, major cities, and seats of government, no doubt as a manner of disseminating the vision behind Amanullah’s administrative reforms.59 Husayn described government as working through three administrative offices: the Supreme Government (in the Samt-i Mashriqi, Samt-i Junubi, Farah, and Maimanah); the Provincial Governments (in Kabul, Qandahar, Herat, Turkistan, and Qatghan-u-Badakhshan); and the town governments (which together served every district in Afghanistan). In this first discussion, lineage affinity was identified only insofar as it affected residence. For example, in Khost, the oldest city of Afghanistan, where the bazaars of the city were located in four different muhallas (quarters), the author explained that these quarters were distinguished by their inhabitants, Durrani, Ghilza’i, Kakar, and Parsi.60 After accounting for the physical and political geography of the country, the author described the people of Afghanistan as divided into qaba’il (tribes), and provided enumeration, location, and some history of these lineage networks.61 In this case the tribe was treated as a marker of identity but not of political organization.\n\nA third geography text was written by Muhammad ‘Ali Khan, a professor at the modernizing Habibiyya College, in Kabul, for the purposes of fourth-grade-teacher training. Published in Lahore in 1927, it listed the mountains, rivers, animals, commodities, administrative centers, major cities, and provinces in the country. Its section on human and social geography, “Distribution of People of Afghanistan,” had three unconnected sections. Muhammad ‘Ali Khan identified three major ethnic subdivisions: Afghan Aryan, Irani Aryan, and Mongol/Tatar stock. Without explaining the link between ethnicity and tribe, he then explained that the people of Afghanistan were also distributed among tribes and listed major tribal groups and subgroups, Durrani, Kakar, Afridi, Tajik, Mongol, Shinwari, Jadran, Muhmand, and Yusufza’i Kuhistan.62 In a final section, Muhammad ‘Ali discussed the national characteristics of the Afghans: they were inclined to war, independence of spirit, love of country, and a fierce commitment to family; they were simple and religious in outlook; they were deeply hostile to the rule of foreigners, innovations in education, dress, and as well to the study of alchemy and geography.63 Describing national traits rooted in language, relationships to land and ideas as the underpinnings of social identity, Muhammad ‘Ali Khan rejected a social-scientific scrutiny of tribe and highlighted broadly shared national traits in its place.64\n\nThese texts all suggest that the idea that the tribal unit could produce a viable system of authority, order, and internal unity was troubling to those assembling a social-scientific framework for study or representation of the link between land, government, and society. Mahmud Tarzi stated that such order, both rightful kingship and religious influence, emanated from Kabul. Muhammad Husayn provided a detailed listing of tribes beginning with the Durrani but provided little commentary on how tribal identity interacted with religious, ethnic, or linguistic identities, which he also listed. This problem was even more pronounced in Muhammad ‘Ali’s discussion of tribal subgroupings, which was uneven. Jadran, for example, had no subgroupings at all, whereas other tribal groupings were comprised by pacts and not lineage descent. These texts, as outcomes of state-building projects, demonstrate a far more complex view of tribe and its relationship to state than that suggested by anecdotal accounts of court relations with Pashtun tribes, either through the movement of the Jama’at-i Mujahidin or after.\n\nAlthough this brief foray into the production of geographies in Afghanistan does not establish that the field geography or the production of ethnolinguistic, physical, and topographical data materially changed patterns of relations between state and community, it certainly establishes that the notion of a tribal social order derived from Islamic principles was not endorsed by those engaged in the use of social-scientific approaches to produce knowledge about the country.\n\nTHE AFGHAN JIHAD AND THE RESURRECTION OF THE IDEAL OF THE ISLAMIC TRIBE\n\nIn Pakistan, a new body of Urdu literature emerged after 1978. This literature emerged as a surprising reversal of a decades-old policy of Pakistan state opposition to the Pashtunistan movement and as an outcome of Afghan, Pakistani, and American interest in arming an eastern Pashtun resistance to the Soviet invasion. The Institute of Regional Studies was at the forefront of these publication efforts, producing two sorts of texts: maps to support international understanding of the region and Urdu texts intended to be widely received in Pakistan. The shift back to a discourse of tribalism was broadly rooted in the idea that tribal loyalty to resistance leaders and Islamic faith-based resistance to communism was a mainstay of opposition to the Soviet occupation. “There are two forms of resistance in Afghanistan,” wrote one scholar affiliated with Quaid-i Azam University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: “one is spontaneous, unorganized and uncoordinated; the other is organized by certain established groups. The unorganized form of resistance draws on primordial loyalties—family, kinship, sub-tribe, tribe and region.”65 The presumption that this was true underpinned international support for some of the Afghan resistance groups, particularly Sayyid Ahmad Gilani’s Mahaz-i Milli-yi Islami (National Islamic Front) and Sibghatullah Mujaddidi’s Jabha-yi Nijat-i Milli (National Salvation Front).66\n\nAnother text from this period was written by Hayran Khattak under the title of Sarguzasht-i Mujahidin-i Afghanistan (Experiences of the Afghan Holy Warriors). It comprised a series of biographical essays about wounded mujahidin fighters. In his introduction, Khattak described the Pashtuns of the region between Chitral and Peshawar, and the Khyber, Gomal, and Bolan passes as inheritors of the legacy of the medieval Ghaznavid and Ghurid dynasties and the founder of the modern Afghan state, Ahmad Shah Abdali (r. 1747–72). The author then interviewed a number of Pashtuns from rural Ghazni, and Nangrahar, emphasizing in each case his purity, simplicity, and faith as his primary political motivation.67 In each case, the faith of the Pashtun was described as positioning his opposition to communism and the Parcham (Flag) party, inspiring his works on mujahidana (holy warriorism), and encouraging his valorous militancy. Urdu-language ethnographic and military studies of the frontier accompanied this narrative. A text endorsed and published by the chairman of the Pashto Academy described marriage rituals (at great length), circumcision, the call to prayer, naming and charitable practices, and principles of hospitality and blood feuds, concluding with a statement on the rules of war.68\n\nIn 1984, a dictionary of Pashtun tribes was published by a retired lieutenant of the Pakistan Army, Muhammad Ahsanullah. Returning to Olaf Caroe’s model of cataloguing lineage groups, Ahsanullah produced an updated list of Pashtun tribes over the course of five hundred pages. A map illustrated this listing, indicating the location of important tribal groups.69 The identification of tribe had been part of system of military understanding of the frontier since the colonial period; tribal groups were identified and hierarchized in relation to one another to determine which groups had the most strategically important control in the region, which subgroups relied on them, and to allocate allowances to them on this basis. The fact that this text was produced for a general public demonstrates the spilling over of the Pakistan-side Tribal Areas–specific military identification of social hierarchies in response to a general demand for information about Pashtuns.\n\nIn the absence of moderating political and social-scientific discourses aimed at shaping participatory and accountable forms of government, an instrumentalist interest in the potential for rural Pashtuns to be mobilized revived a vernacular discourse of tribal organization and tribal motivation. This militarily-oriented ethnography had a number of similarities with the discourse of the Jama’at-i Mujahidin: it highlighted history, tribal valor, and the organizing principle of religious practice, pushed for an accounting of tribal groups, and produced representations of region alongside the identification of tribe. Only the reach of and response to the representation of the Pashtuns as religiously motivated tribal warriors differed dramatically in this latter instance.\n\nOnce again this body of writing displaced other emerging discourses about the community and state in Afghanistan. In 1972, an important mapping project, designed as a Ph.D. project by the American Thomas Eighmy, had integrated demographic data in geographic-survey information to define twenty-seven “regional cores” that were broadly comparable on the basis of physical characteristics and ethnolinguistic homogeneity. The project was a joint effort between the Afghan Cartographic Institute and the Afghan Demographic Studies Institute, which carried out its fieldwork between 1971 and 1975. Surveys carried out by the State University of New York for the Afghan Demographic Studies Institute distinguished a total settled population from a nomadic population.70 This was closely followed by a body of work on nomadism and community, beginning with Richard Tapper and Nancy Tapper, that complicated ideas about authority, ethnicity, and social organization.71\n\nThese studies demonstrate a progression in state knowledge of routes, ethnic and linguistic characteristics, boundaries, and contestation of land limits under the influence of both Soviet survey standards and American demographic, ethnolinguistic, and population studies. Where the former documented the physical characteristics of the country, the latter focused on the human characteristics of settled and nomadic societies, shaping a new approach to thinking about strategies of social and political integration of the country.\n\nPakistani authors, charged by the military and a new American interest in Afghanistan with identifying Pashtuns who could forge a resistance to the Soviet invasion, once again invested the idea of the tribe with the additional implication that this was a viable and autonomous social formation inspired by Islam and culture.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe Jama‘at-i Mujahidin, interested in mobilizing an anticolonial movement in the northwest frontier region, shaped a discourse of a valorous and independent Pashtun tribe, motivated by religion and directed by both tribal and religious advisors. This discourse drew both on the historical representation of the Indian northwest as an entry point of Islam into the subcontinent and on the notion of the tribe in Islamic Arabia. The idea of the tribe as an independent social unit, guided from within by religious and cultural principles, was revived in writing in Pakistan after 1978 to enable and to motivate a response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nThis was by no means the dominant approach to, or understanding of, the Pashtun tribe in vernacular and local writings on either side of the Durand Line border. The discourse of the valorous tribe, motivated by Islam to defend the Afghan state and its own independence, was at odds with political and geographic discourses that identified economic and social factors as governing community behaviors. Geographies that established the contiguity of Afghanistan and political writings by nationalist Afghans and Indians defined subjecthood and political participation in relation to the center. Demographic studies also took up social organization, patterns of settlement, and Islam from an economic and state-centered perspective.\n\nTaken in context, both the Jama‘at-i Mujahidin and 1980s’ Pakistan-based writers identified a tribal order pivoting on an independent, self-organizing, religiously motivated Pashtun tribe, marking a calculated and intentional endorsement of lineage-based organization and religious authority. This approach was obviously and demonstrably incompatible with representative politics in the colonial North-West Frontier Province, as well as with social-scientific representations of the coherence and governability of the state and society in Afghanistan in the early part of the twentieth century. In the latter period, it superseded far more complex thinking about authority and organization."
