        "text": "George Buchan Simpson was one of Dundee’s most notable art patrons – Matthew Jarron’s book Independent and Individualist: Art in Dundee 1867-1924, outlines how important Simpson was in developing Dundee’s art scene in the early days of the Albert Institute and beyond. Beginning as a private collector, his interest in contemporary art led him to correspond with many of Scotland’s leading artists in detail about their own and each other’s work and he even offered suggestions for compositions – something which did not go down well with everyone and put some artists off working with him. As his collections grew, Simpson lent paintings to exhibitions in various galleries. Simpson was one of the members of the 1867 British Association Meeting organisation committee – the B.A.’s visit to Dundee was an important spur for the completion of the Albert Institute.[14] This involvement in fine art exhibitions in Dundee and beyond, in which his collection featured prominently, continued for many years. His collecting went beyond art and included “rare china, medallions, and casts, thereby forming the nucleus of what was ultimately regarded as one of the finest cabinets of the kind in Forfarshire.” As with his collection of paintings, so too with his rare literary works, covering the 15th-18th centuries, he was happy to loan them for the education and enjoyment of his fellow citizens. He was also considered to be an authority on early Scottish coinage.[15]\n\nSimpson’s partnership with William Ritchie came to an end in 1877. Ritchie continued to operate the Ward Street Mill for a short time but withdrew from spinning and manufacturing to concentrate on being a merchant.[32] George continued to operate as a merchant, spinner and manufacturer, retaining ownership of the Lower Pleasance Mill and the Nelson Street Factory. He had given up both works by the 1886.[33]\n\nHis fortunes did not last. Poor trade in the jute industry and some unsuccessful business ventures led to him selling off all his collections between 1880 and 1886, to pay off his debts. These included a number of Burns relics.[15] When George Buchan Simpson died in 1892 at Leamington Terrace, Edinburgh, he was living with his family. His obituary relates that they had moved there only recently.[15] According to his will he had no furniture or household items and had been supported by his family. Valuation Rolls for 1875-76 and 1885-86 state he had owned or tenanted property in Dundee and Edinburgh. According to his will he was being looked after by his family and his estate was valued at £4. 0s 10d.[34] He died on his daughter Florence’s 25th birthday."
