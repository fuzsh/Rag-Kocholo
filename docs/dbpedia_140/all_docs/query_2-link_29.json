The Trinity House was built in 1457, and rebuilt in 1753. The Charter-house was founded in the year 1384.[1]\n\nHoly Trinity is an ancient and spacious cruciform structure, with a lofty and very beautiful tower rising from the intersection, and supported on piers and arches of elegant proportions: the east end is in the decorated English style, and the transepts are fine specimens of the earliest period of that style; the window in the south transept is filled with tracery, and enriched with mouldings of curious character. The edifice was re-opened, after judicious restoration, in December, 1845.[2]\n\nResources[edit | edit source]\n\nFind Neighboring Parishes[edit | edit source]\n\nUse England Jurisdictions 1851 Map\n\nType the name of the parish in the search bar\n\nClick on the location pin on the map\n\nChoose Options from the pop up box\n\nClick \"List Contiguous Parishes\" to find the neighboring parishes\n\nCemeteries[edit | edit source]\n\n1847-1971 Cemetery Records, 1847-1971, Springbank General Cemetery (Hull, Yorkshire)(*) at FamilySearch Catalog - images\n\n1860-1942 Monumental Inscriptions, Division Road Cemetery (Hull, Yorkshire)(*) at FamilySearch Catalog - images\n\n1861-1991 Cemetery Records, 1861-1991, Hull General Cemetery (Hull, Yorkshire)(*) at FamilySearch Catalog - images\n\n1875-1994 Cemetery Records, 1875-1994, Borough cemetery, Hedon Road (Hull, Yorkshire)(*) at FamilySearch Catalog - images\n\n1889-1994 Cemetery Records, 1889-1994, West Cemetery (Hull, Yorkshire)(*) at FamilySearch Catalog - images\n\n1915-1994 Cemetery Records, 1915-1994, Northern cemetery, Cottingham Road (Hull, Yorkshire)(*) at FamilySearch Catalog - images\n\n1931-1994 Cemetery Records, 1931-1994, Eastern cemetery, Preston Road (Hull, Yorkshire)(*) at FamilySearch Catalog - images\n\nCastle Street M.i.s--Burial Ground for Holy Trinity Church, Hull(*) at FamilySearch Catalog - images\n\nKingston upon Hull and District Military Monumental Inscriptions(*) at FamilySearch Catalog - images\n\nMonumental Inscriptions, Saint Mary's Churchyard on Sculcoates Lane, Hull, Yorkshire, England(*) at FamilySearch Catalog - images\n\nSt. Johns Churchyard Monumental Inscriptions, Newland, nr.
