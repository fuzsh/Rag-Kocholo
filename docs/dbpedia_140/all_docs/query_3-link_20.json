        "text": "When it comes to #fashion #brands, #Hermès, founded in 1837, is one of those storied names that has withstood the test of time. Thank you, Hermès #Singapore, for extending a warm welcome and invite to the special #exhibition \"On The Wings of Hermès\" Having conceptualized and executed in #Paris in 2022, the exhibition's arrival in Singapore marks its exclusive showing in #SoutheastAsia The show blends #liveexperiences, #theatricalperformances, and high-quality #cinematography - I must say, this is a show that is unlike any others. If you have a chance, please check out the free show at the #MarinaBaySands #SeenAroundSingapore Photo credit: myself\n\nI believe #tolerance towards others, whether it be #race, #religion, or #ethnicity, ought to be taught and learned from a young age. In a small and compact city-state like #Singapore, this harmonious relationship is one of the #cornerstones of the #society. I was delighted to visit the two-day pop-up exhibition at #TampinesHub organized by Singapore’s heritage institutions to celebrate #RacialHarmonyDay and to bring the #festivities into the #neighborhood. As you can see from my photos, children were enjoying various activities while #learning about the different #cultures that make up the #diversity of Singapore. Fun fact: Singapore is a melting pot of cultures, with the main racial groups being #Chinese (about 74%), #Malay (about 13%), and #Indian (about 9%). This rich diversity is what makes the celebrations of #harmony and #unity so meaningful.\n\nI was in #SanFrancisco for a short trip and was taken aback by the emptiness of the city. The streets are quieter, retail shops and shopping malls are deserted, and restaurants close early. Having grown up in the Bay Area, I have seen how San Francisco has undergone significant #transformations over the years, grappling with challenges such as #homelessness and #publicsafety These ongoing issues are exacerbated since the #pandemic with companies shifting to #remoteworking and employees relocating elsewhere for #affordablehousing options, leading to a noticeable shift in the city’s #atmosphere and #vibrancy According to Cushman & Wakefield, office #vacancies in San Francisco reached a new high of 34.5% in the second quarter, up from 28.1% a year ago, and just 5% before the pandemic. Moreover, office #rentprices fell to their lowest since 2015 with an average of $68.27 per sqft, down from $84.70 pre-pandemic. Despite these challenges, San Francisco remains a city of #resilience and #beauty - it is essential for the #community, #businesses, and #policymakers to come together and restore the city’s #economichealth I am hopeful for a revitalized future of this #iconiccity of the world. All photos taken by me. #UrbanChallenges #CityTransformation #SeenAroundSanFrancisco\n\nThere is a new pop-up #exhibition worth visiting at the National #Museum of #Singapore! Play:Date – Unlocking Cabinets of Play is an #experiential pop-up that invites everyone to relive and connect over nostalgic #memories centered on #toys. A collective effort with local #community of #artists and #toycollectors, this showcase presents over 250 locally and globally recognizable toys from various eras. You can truly relive your #childhoodmemories by checking out vintage toys from #Barbie, #McDonalds, #HotWheels, #Matchbox and #Tamiya, as well as #Tamagotchis For me, the hand-held #Nintendo game of Popeye brought back fun memories. It was the first-ever electronic Popeye game, a simple game in which Olive tosses objects from a ship’s deck to be caught by Popeye, who sits in a small boat in the middle of the screen. The goal is to catch each item by moving side-to-side and avoid Brutus’s attacks, who waits at either edge of the screen for the chance to strike down Popeye. #HeritageTourim #SeenAroundSingapore #NationalMuseumOfSingapore\n\nI highly recommend stopping by the National Museum of #Singapore this weekend or before end of June. There on the front lawn, you’ll find “Homeground: We Built This City,” a #tapestry celebrating Singapore’s #architectural #heritage. This special exhibition pays homage to Singapore’s rich #builtheritage I recently had the honour of touring this #exhibition with Singapore President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, hosted by the wonderful crew of the Singapore Heritage Festival (#SHF2024). The exhibition features artworks showcasing aspects of Singapore’s heritage, such as #publichousing and #shophouse During the tour, one particularly great moment was when President Tharman accepted an invitation from a young boy to join a chess game! It was a heartwarming reminder of the importance of #communityoutreach in connecting people across different age groups and professions. The Singapore HeritageFest is the National Heritage Board’s signature annual outreach event that celebrates the many facets of Singapore’s diverse heritage and culture. SHF works with individuals, groups and communities to co-create programmes and offerings. This allows the festival to uncover lesser-known stories and narratives, engender a greater sense of ownership, and empower Singaporeans to safeguard and promote our shared heritage. The inaugural edition of SHF was staged in 2004, and since then, the festival has continued to provide on-site and online experiences with yearly themes that focus on different aspects of Singapore’s heritage. #SeenAroundSingapore\n\n#CareerUpdate After two rewarding years with #Fintopia, I am embarking on a new chapter of my career (details to be shared at a later time). Firstly, I’d like to thank Indonesia Financial Services Authority (#OJK), Fintopia #shareholders, and Board of Directors and Commissioners for approving my resignation via the General Meeting of Shareholders (Rapat Umum Pemegang Saham). My deepest gratitude goes out to Fintopia colleagues, industry friends, and banking partners for believing in me and working hand-in-hand to provide #financialinclusion for millions of borrowers. Far from perfect, we strive to improve by learning from our mistakes and responding to feedback, both negative and positive. When I joined Fintopia as the #ChiefExecutiveOfficer of #Indonesia and the #ChiefStrategyOfficer of #SoutheastAsia, I knew that this was a great #leadership challenge: how to bring an already successful organization to new heights. The challenge was compounded by the fact that we operate in an #emergingmarket and a highly regulated industry. Despite my fluency in the local language, it was still a major adjustment. I accepted the role because I believed that many people lacked the knowledge or network to secure conventional loans from banks and often turned to illegal money lenders. Fintopia offers a solution to this issue. During my tenure, Fintopia Indonesia grew from 300 to 700 full-time employees, with 60% being women. Our cumulative unsecured loans surged from 11 trillion IDR ($675 million USD) to 50 trillion IDR ($3 billion USD). We registered over 40 million accounts. We successfully passed the stringent OJK audit and expanded our loan channeling partnerships with #BankNeoCommerce, #BankJago, #SeaBank, and #SuperBank. Of course, all of this is made possible by our stellar team members. Working in a #multilingual and #multinational global #fintech #unicorn—with operations spanning #China, #Indonesia, #Philippines, #Mexico, and #Poland, and employing over 2,000 people—is never easy. Differences are bound to happen, but how we handle and learn from them is what matters. On to the next one! Terima kasih. 感谢您的友谊.\n\nIf you live in or are visiting #Singapore and have children under 12 years old, I highly recommend the “Into the Hawkerverse” exhibition at the Children’s Museum of Singapore! I recently had the honor of touring the exhibition with Minister of State for Trade and Industry and Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth Alvin Tan. It was so much fun! “Into the Hawkerverse” introduces Singapore’s Hawker Culture as an integral part of the country’s food #heritage and way of life. Visitors can travel back in time to the vibrant days of street #hawkers, meet hawker #culture heroes, hear their stories, step into the shoes of hawkers, explore the diverse array of hawker dishes, and learn about the thoughtful design of hawker centres. Visitors can even get a glimpse into the future of hawker culture. Though please keep in mind the following: One, the Museum’s #exhibitions are designed with children in mind. Children must be supervised by an adult caregiver at all times, hence adult visitors are allowed in the Museum only when they are accompanying children. Two, due to the Museum’s limited capacity, visitors should pre-book a visiting timeslot. Tickets are available a month in advance. Walk-ins are welcomed, but not guaranteed. Enjoy this #fantastic exhibition — hopefully you get to relieve your inner #childhood #SeenAroundSingapore\n\nHonored to attend the groundbreaking ceremony of the Singapore Founders’ Memorial and wrote a short note to commemorate this special occasion. This memorial beautifully connects the past, present, and future of Singapore’s diverse community. Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong was the Guest-of-Honor, accompanied by Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration Desmond Lee, and Minister for Culture, Community, and Youth and Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong. In his speech, SM Lee Hsien Loong reflected on Singapore’s history and the early days of the country striving for independence — the path was not assured and full of challenges. Under leadership of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore and its pioneer generation not only survived but thrived. Set to open in 2028 at Bay East Garden, the Founders’ Memorial will be a sprawling 27-hectare landmark honoring the legacy of Singapore’s founding leaders while inspiring future generations. This integrated gallery and garden experience will celebrate multiculturalism and be deeply reminiscent and contextually anchored. Looking forward to supporting the Founders’ Memorial project!

Excited to be part of this vibrant light festival in the #MarinaBay CBD. There are works of artists from 11 different countries on display. Great to reconnect with #Singapore Minister for National Development and Minister-in-change of Social Services Integration Desmond Lee who was there to kick off the event. Please do visit the festival! It runs daily until June 23th - with extended hours until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. After your walking tour, you can catch a short boat ride and enjoy the sceneries from different perspectives.

This exhibition reunites a set of 84 hand-carved model pagodas for the first time in over a century. Originally made in #Shanghai, they traveled thousands of miles away to #SanFrancisco for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition of 1915. The exhibit was part of a massive world’s fair that attracted over 18 million visitors during its 288-day run. Make sure to visit the Museum to experience the Pagoda Odyssey, Towers of Faith, a #photography display of religious landmarks in Singapore, and Journey into the Pagoda, a #virtualreality fantasy experience. Step into an architectural marvel and immerse yourself in its intricate design with the VR experience inspired by the architecture and folklore of the Pagoda of Six Harmonies in #Hangzhou. Congrats to Asian Civilization Museum for the launch! Kudos to the amazing work by the VR team as well! (Photo credit: myself) #SeenAroundSingapore #HeritageTourism"
