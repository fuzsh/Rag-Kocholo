        "text": "He has given his name to a substantial area of the west of Hull,\n\nand was the archetypal Victorian self-made man. Christopher\n\nGodmond Pickering was born in 1842, the son of Christopher\n\nPickering, a tailor, and his wife Jane Gibson. On the 1861\n\ncensus the family were living at Hales Entry; young Christopher\n\nwas a fish curer. Ten years later he was married to Rachael\n\nBlakestone and lived at 3 Marlborough Terrace, Hessle Road.\n\nHe was then a fish merchant. In the next ten years he became\n\na ship owner and, in 1881, the family lived at 114 Coltman St\n\n(west side). In 1889 he moved out to Hornsea.\n\nPickering made a fortune very quickly. During the 1880s he\n\nowned a fleet of sailing smacks in partnership with a man named Haldane. They were\n\nquick to recognise that the future was in steam, and sold the sailing ships in Europe in\n\norder to acquire steam trawlers. By 1914 he headed Pickering & Haldane's Steam\n\nTrawling Co. and Pickering, Haldane & Co. (fish and ice merchants), as well as being\n\nChair of several fishing and allied firms.\n\nPickering invested in land. In 1914 he built a “model village” in the Hessle Road area\n\nwhich included a church, a vicarage, almshouses, a park, a recreation ground and a\n\nchildren's home. The park and almshouses remain, and the Pickering name is\n\nremembered in Pickering council ward, Pickering Park, and Christopher Pickering Lodge\n\n(an old people's home).\n\nIn 1918 he offered the council 75\n\nacres of land for housing at a\n\nprice of £493 an acre. It was\n\npointed out that he had bought the\n\nland at the turn of the century for\n\nonly £120 an acre, and would\n\nrealise a profit of around £17, 000\n\n– but the deal went ahead.\n\nHe died in 1920."
