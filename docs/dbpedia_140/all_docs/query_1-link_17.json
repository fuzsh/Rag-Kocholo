        "text": "I’ve been following LP’s music since I was an introverted teenager in high school, desperately searching for music I’ve never heard before. And then one day, I came across her song “Wasted” from her Suburban Sprawl & Alcohol album. I had this album on repeat for a long time. I’ve been following her music ever since. There were only a few artists in my life where I would love almost their entire album. LP is one of those artists for me. Her music reaches a broad audience. It’s relatable to anyone going through a tough time, specifically heart break. She shares her journey through the ups and downs. What makes LP stand out from the other artists I follow is her breathtaking vocal range. Almost operatic but wilder and emotional.\n\nI have had some small conversations with LP the last couple of years. However, due to my anxious nature, I was hesitant to let her know how much I admired her and how much her music meant to me. I did attend one drive-in show, during the pandemic, to see her live for the first time, although it was very hard to see from where we were parked. You can imagine my excitement to see her up close and let alone photograph her performance at the Ryman Auditorium.\n\nI got there just in time to see and capture Nick Leng opening the night. Nick Leng is an indie-soul singer-songwriter from South Africa. Leng made a new fan that night. His music was soothing to the soul. I highly recommend listening to Leng’s new single “Spirals”. He also joined LP later that night during her set.\n\nLP walked out on stage and as I was about to start photographing her, I got pulled aside by security. Apparently I was not given the proper photo credentials, therefore they kept me aside to investigate further. I did miss her first song but ran in as soon as I got clearance. I wish I could say that was the last time security accidently stopped me that night but at least you know the Ryman security team is legit. It was such a thrill to be surrounded by fans who loved her music as much as I did. I would glance over to the audience as I was working just to see them singing along to her lyrics. LP fully engaged with her audience the entire night. There were so many amazing moments to capture. It was a truly unforgettable night!"
