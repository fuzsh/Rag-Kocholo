        "text": "I STOOD in a Hong Kong police station with my heart pounding. Yes, I was guilty -- guilty of being thrilled. I tried to hide it because I felt bad for my friend Leslie, an American violinist with the Hong Kong Philharmonic, whose wallet had just been stolen.\n\nTo entertain me on my first night in Hong Kong, Leslie had taken me to the famous night market in Yau Ma Tei, where street vendors sell everything from plastic ''jade'' to unidentified grilled meats and fish parts. We were engrossed in trying to ascertain the origin of something on a skewer when I felt a faint brush against my shoulder bag and turned around to see a woman dart off into the crowd.\n\nInstinctively, I unzipped my bag and checked inside -- whew! Everything was there. But Leslie's wallet had disappeared from her open-top purse.\n\nThankfully, she didn't lose much cash. But her ID (the equivalent of a green card) was gone. ''I guess we'd better report this at the police station,'' she said.\n\n''Yes, let's go,'' I responded, overenthusiastically. For months now, I had been watching -- no, devouring -- Hong Kong cops-and-robbers movies on home video. Hong Kong is one of Asia's Hollywoods, famous worldwide for its fast-fisted kung fu sagas and stylish gangster flicks made by directors like John Woo and Ringo Lam. With flying bullets, Bogartesque (and handsome) heroes like Chow Yun Fat and car chases that make ''The French Connection'' seem like ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' these films dazzled me with their images of a brash, thrilling and explosive (sometimes literally so) metropolis.\n\nMy fascination with cinematic Hong Kong grew so strong that in midsummer I sent away for a set of Cantonese language instruction tapes. In case I ever met any Hong Kong movie stars, I wanted to be ready. The tapes and books didn't explain how to say, ''Chow Yun Fat, you were awesome in 'God of Gamblers,' '' but I did learn the evocative Cantonese expression for movies: din ying, which means ''electric shadows.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
