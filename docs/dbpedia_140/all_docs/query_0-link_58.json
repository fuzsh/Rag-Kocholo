THE PAWN OF FATE; a novel\n\n[Written 1918].\n\nMottled green paper cover with cloth spine.\n\n[178 p], holograph notebook.\n\n\"Preface: In the small sketch of life in a military hospital in France which serves as part of the background to the heroine of this story, many will probably think that they recognise themselves. It is a well-known fact that in the medical and nursing professions a conformity to type exists which is equalled by that of no other vocation in life. Active service conditions tend to emphasize rather than detract from this conformity. For the majority of readers this explanation will doubtless be sufficient. For the rest, I can only say, that if any feel the cap fits, by all means let them wear it.\"\n\nA28. FOLLY'S VINEYARD, a novel.

Naive, amusing, pathetic; hence worth keeping, and possibly, when far enough back in history, worth publishing.\" Vera Brittain.\n\nAn Extract from the Foreword:\n\n\"Until a very few months ago, no eyes but my own had seen the diary which is here reproduced, and even my own had not seen it for several years. These intimate, undisciplined outpourings were forced from my immaturity by the urgent need of self-expression. I have decided to publish them now because I have come to believe that our need for understanding, one of another, is at least equally urgent.\"\n\nBox 44\n\nA30. A HONEYMOON IN TWO WORLDS.
