        "text": "Burmese musician and actor (born 1979)\n\nIn this Burmese name, the given name is Sai Sai Kham Leng. There is no family name.\n\nSai Sai Kham Leng (Burmese: စိုင်းစိုင်းခမ်းလှိုင်; pronounced [sáiɰ̃ sáiɰ̃ kʰáɰ̃ l̥àiɰ̃]; also Sai Sai Kham Hlaing; born 10 April 1979) is a Burmese singer-songwriter, novelist, and actor of ethnic Shan descent.[2] He is considered one of the most commercially successful male singers in the history of Burmese hip hop music.[3]\n\nIn 2020, he was recognized in Forbes Asia's 100 Digital Stars List which shows Asia-Pacific's most influential celebrities on social media.[4]\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nSai Sai Kham Leng was born on 10 April 1979 in Taunggyi, Shan state, Myanmar to Kham Leng and Cho Cho San Tun of an ethnic Shan aristocratic family. His great-grandfather Sao San Tun, Saopha of Mongpawn, was a signatory to the 1947 Panglong Agreement and one of nine senior government officials assassinated on 19 July 1947.[5]\n\nSai is the eldest son of four siblings, having two younger sisters and a younger brother. Soon after he was born, his parents moved to nearby Aungban for two years before moving back to Taunggyi. He graduated high school at B.E.H.S (1) Taunggyi in 1996.[6] His parents divorced when he was in the 4th standard (4th grade).

After that, he launched a new cosmetic series called SAI Cosmetix under that trading company, as he possesses a strong fanbase in Myanmar and most of his fans are girls and ladies of all ages.[30] The products he offers are mainly manufactured in South Korea.[31] He launched three new shades of an Ultra Matte lipstick series; Crush on You, Marry Me, and Xo Xo in October 2016, and \"Love is in the Air\" mascara.[32]\n\nHumanitarian work\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015, Sai Sai was involved in the National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP) Cover Your Cough Campaign,[33] which aimed to increase knowledge about how tuberculosis spreads. In 2016, he continued his advocacy in this area with the Myanmar Unite to End TB Mass Media Programme with the NTP, supported by The 3MDG Fund.[34]\n\nDuring COVID-19 pandemic, Sai Sai enthusiastically collaborated with Ministry of Health and Sports (Myanmar) to promote awareness and preventive guidelines using his social influence.

The Live Show was broadcast free and raised hundreds of millions kyats for funding to manage the pandemic across Myanmar.\n\nPolitical criticism\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état, he stayed relatively low-profile. On February 2, one day after the coup, Sai Sai Kham Leng changed his profile image to a red square, the color of the NLD, and posted that he hoped everyone was \"safe and sound\". He showed his support for the peaceful protests and spoke out to respect the votes cast during the 2020 elections and to free the previously detained artists on his official social media accounts. He also joined several protests alongside other famous musicians from Myanmar Music Association in late February.[35] Nevertheless, public opinions turned against him, and their perception of him not doing enough for the cause made him a target of social punishment movements.[36] Many celebrities in Myanmar, including Sai Sai, have ceased their social activities online and offline since then.[37] Business brands that have collaborated with Sai Sai have agreed to end their partnership and some are not yet renewed until further notice.[38]\n\nSai Sai Kham Leng faced heavy criticism after hosting his birthday show at Yangon's Inya Lake Garden on April 10, 2024, where tickets were sold for 100,000 kyat per person amidst the civil war outbreak in the country.[39]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHis relationship with actress Wut Hmone Shwe Yee was one of the most scandalous relationships amongst the Burmese entertainment industry.[40][41] However, they broke up after some years. Sai is single and lives in Yangon. He expressed that he was unsure about marriage as he comes from a \"broken family\".[42] He is a Theravada Buddhist.[42]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nChocolate Yaung Yayge Einmet (Chocolate-coloured Icy Dream) (ချောကလက်ရောင် ရေခဲအိပ်မက်) (2000)\n\nThangegyin Mya Zwa (Many Friends) (သူငယ်ချင်းများစွာ) (2001)\n\nFebruary Mhattan (February Diary) (ဖေဖော်ဝါရီ မှတ်တမ်း) (2003)[43]\n\nSai Sai Live in Yangon (2004)\n\nSai Sai Hu Khaw Thi (It is Called Sai Sai) (စိုင်းစိုင်း ဟု ခေါ်သည်) (2005)\n\nHappy Sai Sai Birthday (2007)[44]\n\nEver Golli (Always Dwifter) (အမြဲတမ်း ဂေါ်လီ) (2009)[45]\n\nDate Date Kye (Topnotch) (ဒိတ်ဒိတ်ကြဲ) (2012)[46]\n\n\"Sai Sai is Sai Sai\" (စိုင်းစိုင်းကစိုင်းစိုင်း) (2018)\n\nCollaborative albums\n\n[edit]\n\nPyan Pyaw Pya Bo Tawtaw Khet Leit Me (Would Be Quite Difficult to tell) (ပြန်ပြောပြဖို့ တော်တော်ခက်လိမ့်မယ်) (2002)\n\nMeinma (Woman) (မိန်းမ) (2002)\n\nA-Chit Mya Zwa A Twet (For All My Love) (အချစ်များစွာအတွက်) (2002)\n\nBawa Bawa (Life Life) (ဘဝ ဘဝ) (2003)\n\nCity FM 2nd Anniversary (2003)\n\nNatthami Ponbyin (Fairy Tale) (နတ်သမီးပုံပြင်) (2004)\n\nRock & Rap Live Show (2006)\n\nA-Lwan Ye Nya (Night of Missing) (အလွမ်းရဲ့ည) (2006)\n\nA Yin Lo Seit Ma Cha Lo Ba Shin (Because I Can't Trust Anymore Like Before) (အရင်လို စိတ်မချလို့ပါ ရှင်ရယ်) (2006)\n\nAngel (2006)\n\n10 Seconds (၁၀ စက္ကန့်) (2007)[47]\n\nCity FM 6th Anniversary (2007)\n\nCity FM 7th Anniversary (2008)\n\nCity FM 10th Anniversary (2011)[48]\n\nSingle albums\n\n[edit]\n\nRed Light (Featuring Park Bom) (2020)\n\nTours\n\n[edit]\n\n2004: First Sai Sai Solo Concert (Strand Hotel)\n\n2004 to present: Concerts held every year on 10 April for Sai Sai Birthday\n\n2014: 10th Concert\n\n2016: 12th Concert in 2016\n\n2016: Frenzo Music Tour with Ve Ve (Myanmar)\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm (Cinema)\n\n[edit]\n\nMingalabar (2006)\n\nGon Shein Pyin Tae Chit Chin Thake Khar (2006)\n\nYin Khon Hninsi (2008)\n\nAdam, Eve and Datsa (2011)\n\n12 Kyoe Ka Way (2012)\n\nSlaves of Cupid (2015)\n\nAngel of Eden (2016)\n\nThingyan Museum (2016)\n\nFrom Bangkok to Mandalay (2016)[49]\n\nJone Jone Jat Jat (2017)[48]\n\nCho Myain Thaw Let Sar Chay Chin (2017)\n\nYee Sar Ta Won Kwal (2018)\n\nKyar Tot The Lal Maung Sakar (2019)\n\nPadauk Musical (2020)\n\nNovels\n\n[edit]\n\nSekk-ku Nget (Paper Crane) (စက္ကူငှက်)\n\nKan Ko Swel Ywe Hmone Thi Chel..Min Yay Kywl Ei Ma Kyal Ei (We Draw Life By Fortune ..
