        "text": "Agnews & Wilcox, (1868-1872),\n\nPittsburgh, PA, United States, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nManufactured at least one soda bottle. This firm was formed in 1868 when Lemuel Wilcox joined the firm of John Agnew & Company. They manufactured a full range of bottles, many of which are marked with their mark. Their warehouse was located on Wood Street in Pittsburgh, but their factory was on the South Side. This firm was dissolved in 1872 when it became John Agnew & Son. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle. Notes Alton Glass Works Company, (approx: 1870-approx: 1875),\n\nAlton, IL, United States, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nManufactured at least one beer bottle. This mark, which appears on an Illinois bottle has been attributed to the American Glass Works in Pittsburgh, but that works at that time was producing window glass and was not a company. The base appearance and mark is similar to that used by Kearns, Herdman & Gorsuch in Zanesville, Ohio. The local of the known bottle and its age indicate that it was most likely made by one of the early attempts to establish a glass works in Alton, Illinois. One attempt, the Alton Glass Works Company, was organized, funded and appears to have starting building, but it can not be confirmed that they ever blew glass. The markings are on the base of the bottle. Notes Albany Glass Works, (1847-1851),\n\nAlbany, NY, United States, Occurs on 2 bottle,\n\nManufactured at least one soda bottle and marked flasks and a marked pickle bottle. There are no known predecessor or successor firms. Daniel O. Ketchum, who was associated with the firm in Albany, when to Brooklyn and established the Hamilton Glass Works in 1851. The works were offered for sale during the same year and finally auctioned in early 1852. The markings are on the reverse side of the bottle. Notes Alexander, Alfred, & Company, (approx: 1884-1912),\n\nLondon, ENG, England, Occurs on 3 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. In 1882, this firm was know as Alexander & Austin and by 1885 was Alfred Alexander & Company. This company was absorbed into the United Glass Bottle Manufacturers, Limited in 1913. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle. Alexandria Glass Works, Incorporated, (1905-1915)\n\nAlexandria, VA, United States, Occurs on 4 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda and beer bottles. This company was founded on May 10, 1905 with capital of $25,000. Two of its principles, Henry Schnell and Joseph Ramsey, were associated with the founding of the Virginia Glass Company, also of Alexandria, and resigned from the newly formed company in the spring of 1906. The firm made a specialty of flint or clear glass. The capital was increase to $75,000 in 1912. At that time about 150 men and boys were employed. The company was reorganized as the Alexandria Glass Company in July of 1913. It closed in the spring of 1915 and auctioned in September of that same year. By November of 1916, the factory was acquired by and reopened as a plant of the Old Dominion Glass Company. By this time Old Dominion also had acquired the Belle-Pre factory, which was nearby. A devastating fire destroyed the plant in February of 1917. The markings usually occur on the reverse heel of the bottle. This same mark was used by the American Glass Works near Pittsburgh, but this company was defunct two years prior to the Alexandria operations starting. The later firms bottles are mostly marked on Southern clear or flint soda bottles and usually occur with crown tops. American's bottles are usually aqua in color. Notes Allentown Flint Bottle Company, (1902-1915),\n\nAllentown, PA, United States, Occurs on 64 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. In 1901, the Standard Bottle & Glass Company relocated its factory from Rochester, New York to Allentown. Pennsylvania. During 1902, this firm ended up in an embarrassing financial situation and was forced to liquidate. David E. Smith, of The Smith, Comstock Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut purchased the works in the Fall of 1902. It appears that the factory was operating in December of that year. The primary products were beer, soda, whiskey bottles, flasks, and prescription bottles. All of the bottles were manufactured of flint glass. Most of the bottles are from the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania and Bridgeport, Connecticut areas. The plant was plagued by fires and it took years to get an adequate water supply to the plant. In 1915, the glass works was forced into liquidation by Frank P. Lauer of the Lauer Brewing Company of Reading. Lauer had acquired notes issued by the Allentown Flint Glass Company to the Reading Glass Company, and demanded payment on these overdue notes. The company was liquidated and sold to Lauer and Louis Rafetto, a coal magnet from Philadelphia, for the sum of $18,650. There is no evidence that the plant was ever reopened and the plant burned to the ground in November of 1917. The markings are on the base of the bottles. Notes American Bottle Company, (1905-1929),\n\nChicago, IL, United States, Occurs on 123 bottles,\n\nManufactured both beer and soda bottles. Articles of incorporation were filed on August 22, 1905 and issued soon after. This company was a consolidation of the Streator Bottle & Glass Company, the Adolphus Busch Glass Manufacturing Company and the Ohio Bottle Company, which formed in August of 1904 with the consolidation of the E. H. Everett Glass Company, Reed & Company, the Massillon Bottle & Glass Company and the Wooster Glass Company. The American Bottle Company was sold to the Owens Bottle company in 1916, but the name was retained until 1929, when it was merged into the Owens-Illinois Glass Company. Some of the marks are proceed with or have following the mark, marks such as \"0-SABCo\" or \"8-S.\" These marks may indicate the plant where the bottles were blown. In later years, the \"S\" indicated the Streator, Illinois (old Streator) plant and \"N\" the Newark, Ohio (old Everett) plant and the number the year of manufacture. The markings usually occur on the reverse heel of the bottle, but occasionally on the bottle's base. American Glass Works, (approx: 1893-1903),\n\nRedman Mills, PA, United States, Occurs on 80 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda and beer bottles. According to 1894 Congressional records, the predecessor to this company was founded on February 17, 1887. At this time the company was called the American Glass Works Limited. Some time between 1892 and 1893, Limited was dropped and Christian F. Leng, sometimes listed as Frederick C. Leng, became proprietor of the firm. Two versions of the Hopkins 1896 map show Frd'k Ling (sic) Glass House in Redman Mills. In 1899, the company employed 87 and their specialty was soda and beer bottles as well as fruit jars. There are invoices for the firm that are dated 1902 and 1903 for beer bottles. A notice in the November 1902 Glass & Pottery World states that the factory was sold to a railroad company that wanted the site for track improvements. This factory was listed as closed in 1904 and 1905 and does not appear on the 1905 Hopkins map. During 1904 and 1905 Leng appears to have been a jobber and not a manufacturer, but was using the American Glass Works as a firm name. Soon after and by 1905, Leng married, moved to New York, and was a successful broker. The markings usually occur on the reverse heel of the bottle, but occasionally on the bottle's base. Notes American Glass Works Limited, (1887-approx: 1892),\n\nRedman Mills, PA, United States, Occurs on 78 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda and beer bottles. Redman Mills is currently in Baldwin Township along the Monongahela River. According to 1894 Congressional records this company was founded on February 17, 1887 and does not appear to have been connected with any earlier American Glass Works or Companies. At this time the company was a limited liability company. The track of land where the glass house was to be built was owned by William Redman and no glass house is shown there on the 1886 Hopkins map. On this map and within Redman's property is a lot and building owned by John Miller. Miller was a grocer at Redman Mills as early as 1880 and postmaster there in 1883. He acquired Redman's property soon after and became one of the founding members of the American Glass Works Limited. His capital contribution was likely the building site for the American Glass Works and his store was located directly adjacent to it. The factory itself was strategically located between the Pittsburgh, McKeesport and Youghiogheny Railroad and the Monongahela Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad. This company advertised in the National Bottlers Gazette in 1887, 1889, 1890, and 1892. The 1889 ad states that the factory was being expanded 60%. Based on various records, the firm appears to have been liquidated about 1892 and became the American Glass Works owned by Christian F. Leng. The markings usually occur on the base of the bottle, but occasionally on the bottle's reverse heel. Notes Annapolis Glass Company, (1885-1890),\n\nEastport, MD, United States, Occurs on 4 bottles,\n\nManufactured at least one beer bottle. These works were incorporated on May 12, 1885 on Horn Point later known as the Eastport section of Annapolis with 3,000 in capital stock. The factory was operational in the later part of 1885. The attraction of Annapolis was a fine quality of glass sand found on the Severn River nearby. The Annapolis Glass Co. ceased operations in 1890 and was offered for sale in 1891, 1893, and 1894. The Severn Glass Co. was the successor and was incorporated in 1897. The markings are on the base. Notes Arbogast, Alexander, (approx: 1861-1864),\n\nPittsburgh, PA, United States, Occurs on 3 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda and beer bottles. Mark of Alexander Arbogast a Pittsburgh glass blower in 1850 and 1857 and who operated the Iron City Glass Works with August Kapphahn as Arbogast & Kapphahn in 1860. By 1861 he was in sole control of the works. Some time prior to September 1862 through December of that year the firm was known as Arbogast & Company. In January of 1863, Alexander once again has control of the firm and retained it until the works were sold to Pastorius, Schulz & Company on February 1, 1864. Arbogast when on to open a window glass factory in Croton, Pennsylvania. Alexander was the older brother of Philip Arbogast, who invented an early automated glass blowing machine. The markings are on the base. Notes Atlanta Glass Company, (1887-1892),\n\nAtlanta, GA, United States, Occurs on 10 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. The works were established by local Atlanta investors in 1887, the works were built during that year and went into operations. Not long after the works burned. After some litigation, they were rebuilt and operated with some degree of success until they burned again in January 1892. The markings appear on the base of the bottles. Notes B., (1895-1910),\n\nUnknown, United States, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nManufactured beer bottles. This mark appears on a champagne beer bottle from Jamestown, New York. The markings appear on the base of the bottle. Notes Bagley & Company Limited, (1898-1975),\n\nKnottingley, England, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. The origins of this glass factory purportedly started in May of 1871, when cousins John William and William Bagley and John Wild formed Bagley, Wild & Company. John Wild died in 1884 and purportedly in 1890 the firm became Bagley & Company. In 1898, it became a limited liability company. The company was an early adaptor of semiand fully automated bottle making machinery and held the European license for the Owens machine. In 1912, it started the production of pressed glassware and a subsidiary company was founded called the Crystal Glass Company, but it continued to manufacture beverage bottles into the late 1960s. The company went through a series of sales, ending with closure in 1975. It was reopened in 1995 by Stolzle Oberglas AG, an Austrian firm. The markings appear on the reverse heel of the bottle. Notes Baker Brothers & Company, (approx: 1858-1916),\n\nBaltimore, MD, Occurs on 3 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer bottles. Sometime during 1856 or 1857, the firm of Baker & Brother became Baker Brothers & Company. This firm sold window glass, glassware, bottles and chemicals.

Operated the Niagara Works a bottling equipment and supply house. The company became a division of Borthwicks. The Barnett & Foster division moved from London to Wellingborough in 1968 and was acquired by Danisco in 1997. The markings appear on the reverse heel of the bottle. Beaver Falls Glass Company, (1869-1879),\n\nBeaver Falls, PA, United States, occurs on 24 bottles,\n\nWilliam Modes purchased land for this works in 1869. He had previously owned a glasshouses in the Pittsburgh area. All references give 1879 as the final date and this is supported by the marked bottles. Since the Beaver Falls Glass Company Limited was organized on January 1, 1887, it is not known what the status of the works was in the years 1880 to 1887. The Limited must not have been successful, since a few years later in 1890, when the Canton Glass Works burned to the ground, its equipment and 120 workers moved to the rented Beaver Falls Glass Company for a couple of months. The Imperial Glass Works occupied the site in 1900. The markings are on the reverse heel or the bottle's base. Beck, Phillips & Company, (1865-1871),\n\nBirmingham (Pittsburgh), PA, United States, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nManufactured beer bottles. The firm of Beck, Phillips & Co. was organized in mid-1865 by a number of Pittsburgh area businessmen. These included Benjamin Bakewell, Jr. and B. B. Campbell of Bakewell, Pears & Company, James and Washington Beck, and D. C. and J. G. Phillips. The factory was built in the Fall of that year and was in operation by November. Originally it was designed as a window glass factory, but bottles and hollowware were added by 1870, however exactly when is not certain. The partners of the firm appear to be somewhat fluid, with a new face, Ormsby Phillips, appearing to be the owner or principle partner in mid 1871. On September 11, 1871, with the withdraw and James and Washington Beck, the firm became Phillips & Company who continued the manufacture of window glass, bottles, fruit jars and etc. The markings appear on the base of the bottle. Notes Belle-Pre Bottle Company, (1901-1911),\n\nAlexandria, VA, United States, Occurs on 8 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer bottles. The Belle-Pre Bottle Co. was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1901 by a number of Washington businessmen. The factory was built in Alexandria, Virginia in 1902. Its specialty was the manufacture of milk bottles, but they appear to have made other types of bottles in the early years. By 1907, the factory was manufacturing milk bottles exclusively at a rate of one million a month and employed 250 men. The works closed in November of 1911 and was involved in litigation until the fall of 1912, when it was sold to the Old Dominion Glass Co. The markings appear on the base of the bottle. Notes Belleville Glass Company, (1882-1886),\n\nBelleville, IL, United States, Occurs on 5 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda and beer bottles. This company was organized in the early part of 1882 with capital of $25,000 and the plant was operating in the fall of that year employing about 75 men producing 100 gross bottles and fruit jars. Later that same, year a second five pot furnace was in the making and would employ an additional 50 men. By February 1886, the factory was discovered to no longer be operating. Soon after, the company was in receivership. According to some accounts, Adolphus Busch, of brewing fame, purchased the works in 1886, but the receiver reported the company had no assets in 1888. In 1889, the glass works were back in operation employing 98 men and boys. Busch modernized and expanded the plant in 1891, but in 1894 the factory closed because of the depression of 1893. Busch reopened the plant in 1899 after additional modernizations. In 1905, the plant became part of the American Bottle Company. The markings appear on the reverse heel of the bottle. Notes Berney-Bond Glass Company, (1905-1930),\n\nBradford, PA, United States,\n\nClarion, PA, United States,\n\nHazelhurst, PA, United States,\n\nSmethport, PA, United States, Occurs on 16 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda and beer bottles. This company was formed in 1905 with the merger of the Berney Glass Company and the Bond Glass Company. The company was purchased by Owens-Illinois in 1930. The markings are on the base and occurs with a mold number. Binghamton Glass Works, (1882-1893),\n\nBinghamton, NY, United States, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nAppears on beer bottles. This glass works appears to have been formed about 1880 by Binghamton businessmen and was known as the Binghamton Glass Company. In 1882, William Burrows acquired the works and it became known as the Binghamton Glass Works. Burrows was involved in a series of other glass factories in Brooklyn, Newburgh, Honesdale, and East Stroudsburg. The Binghamton plant was the primary manufacturer of bottles for Dr. Kilmer and his swamp root empire, but also manufactured druggists, flask, beer and soda water bottles. Burrows was involved in the works until 1893, when it was organized as the Binghamton Glass Company, a partnership of John B. and Milton Yetter, Frank L. Dennis and William Burrows. In 1897, the company was incorporated and continued to offer a general line of bottles and jars. The company never installed automatic bottle machines and was not able to compete with the changing tide. The company shifted its focus to specialty blown wares and as a wholesalers of glass for other manufacturers. They continued to manufacture glass until about 1926. The company remained active until about 1945, when the last owners died and the property was sold. The markings appear on the base of the bottle. Notes Bode, G. A., (approx: 1895-1905),\n\nChicago, IL, United States, Occurs on 4 bottles,\n\nAppears on soda bottles. Believed to be Gustav A. Bode of Chicago. The GAB mark appears on a Chicago Hutchinson bottle and the BODE mark was reported on another Hutchinson. Bode was a bottlers supplier and most likely did not manufacture bottles but was a reseller like Karl Hutter of New York or Twitchell & Brother of Philadelphia. The markings appear on the reverse heel of the bottle. Bodine, Joel, & Sons, (1846-1855),\n\nBridgeton, NJ, United States, Occurs on 7 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. Two different forms of the mark were used. The Bodines purchased the works from John G. Rosenbaum in 1846. In 1855, they sold the glass works to Maul, Hebrew & Company, who only operated it for a short period until they failed. The works were then purchased by General David Potter and Francis I. Bodine (Potter & Bodine) in 1857 or 1858 and operated under the name of the Bridgeton Glass Works. The markings appear on the reverse side of the bottles. Muncie Glass Company, (1888-1900),\n\nBoldt, Charles, Glass Company, (1900-1906), Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nBoldt, Charles, Company, (1906-1919),\n\nBoldt, Charles, Glass Company, (1919-1929),\n\nMuncie, IN, United States, (1888-1910),\n\nCincinnati, OH, United States, (1900-1924),\n\nHuntington, WV, United States, (1913-1929),\n\nManufactured beer bottles. Charles Boldt was a great example of a self-made man. He started his career as a bookkeeper with Drexler, Immohr & Co., who were bottlers in Louisville. After a brief stint with the Louisville Post Office, he organized the Muncie Glass Company on Nov. 16, 1888, at a mere 20 years of age. In 1900, he built a second glass factory in Cincinnati and renamed the firm The Charles Boldt Glass Company on April 30, 1900. The Cincinnati plant manufactured flint and amber ware. In 1901, a branch office was opened in Louisville, which also produced liquor labels and was headed by his old business acquaintance, Fred J. Drexler. Soon after, new plants were built in Cincinnati to produce boxes and corrugated paper products. As the company expanded into bottlers supplies, corrugated paper, boxes, and labels, they changed the name to reflect the change in business purpose. The firm's new name became The Charles Boldt Company on May 1, 1906. They also started to focus on manufacturing whiskey bottles. The company acquired one of two licenses to use the Owens machines to manufacture liquor bottles and further focused in that area. In 1910, the Muncie plant burned to the ground, the company was incorporated and the Owens Bottle Machine Co. bought shares in the company. It does not appear that the Muncie plant was rebuilt, but the company maintained an office there until 1915. In the following year, 1911, the capacity of the Cincinnati plant was doubled and in 1913, a new plant was opened in Huntington, West Virginia. In 1916, Boldt bought back Owens' share in the business. Prohibitions passage in 1919, was a major blow to the Boldt Company now entrenched in the liquor industry. In that year, the name was changed to the Charles Boldt Glass Company on October 29, the Louisville operation was closed down, the Owens Company bought a controlling interest in the business, and the focus was shifted to producing other ware including soft drink bottles and preserve wares. In 1924, the Cincinnati plant was shut down and operations consolidated to the Huntingdon plant. Bolt closed a deal to sell the company to the Owens-Illinois Company in 1929 and died the next day, leaving his wife an estate of $10,000,00. The markings are on the base of the bottle. Notes Boley Manufacturing Company, (1896-1914),\n\nNew York, NY, United States, Occurs on 56 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soft drink bottles. Henry Boley started selling bottles in 1871. His son Benjamin took over the business in 1881. In 1895, he took an interest in a Brooklyn glass works. With Boley's prospering business and his involvement in a glass factory, he merged his Boley Bottle and Stopper Company into the Boley Manufacturing Company in 1896. In 1899, Boley merged his Manhattan Glass Works into the Boley Manufacturing company. The business had also expanded to the manufacture of Demijohns. In, 1906, the demijohn portion of the business was relocated to Orleans, New York. The Manhattan factory was reportedly to have been closed in 1906, but it continued to be listed in the directories thru 1909 as the Boley Glass Works and there is evidence that soda bottles marked Boley were being produced until this date. The Orleans factory was defunct by 1911 and likely closed around 1909-1910. There is no evidence that soda or beer bottles were every made at Orleans. The last listing of the Boley Manufacturing Company was in 1914. Benjamin Boley was still involved in selling bottles in 1918 and he is listed as a glass manufacturer in a 1922 Brooklyn news paper. There was a Boley Glass Company in 1922 located at Grapeville, Pensylvania. The markings are on the base of the bottle. Notes. Boley, Benjamin, (1881-1895),\n\nNew York, NY, United States, Occurs on 2 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soft drink bottles. In 1881, Benjamin Boley took over the bottle supply business founded in 1871 at 90-92 Sheriff by his father Henry Boley. In 1887 a second location was established at 96 S. 5th avenue. In 1891, the 5th avenue location was relocated to 74 W. Houston. In 1893, Boley established the Boley Bottle and Stopper Company and consolidated his business locations to 52 Cannon street. During late 1894 or early 1895, Boley took an interest or built a glass factory at the intersection of Metropolitan & Morgan avenues in Brooklyn called the Metropolitan Glass Works. On January 21, 1896, this business was incorporated as the Manhattan Glass Works. This same year, 1896, The Boley Manufacturing Company was established to reflect the increased offering of the Boley's enterprises. As evidenced by an early Baltimore bottle dating to 1896, bottles were marked Boley Mfg. Co. were assuredly made at Boley's Manhattan Glass Works until it was merged into the Boley Manufacturing Company in 1899. The markings are on the face of the bottle in a plate. One bottle has an \"H\" in a heart motif on its base. Notes. Bottlers & Manufacturers Supply Company, (approx: 1900-1920),\n\nLong Island City, NY, United States, Occurs on 21 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer bottles.

Breffit, Edgar F., & Company, (approx: 1860-1913),\n\nCastleford, England, Occurs on 4 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer bottles. Winterbottom & Jessop purchased four acres of land from Lord Houghton and erected the Ryebread Glass Works in 1834. Edgar Breffit bought the business in 1844 and renamed it Breffits Glass Works. By 1868, E. Breffit & Company were listed as proprietors of the Aire and Calder Glass Bottle Works. By 1884, it became a limited liability company. This company was absorbed into the United Glass Bottle Manufacturers, Limited in 1913. The markings are on the base of the bottle. Brewers' & Bottlers' Supply Company, (1902-1913),\n\nNewark, NJ, United States, Occurs on 9 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer bottles. The company was incorporated on August 14, 1902 and was located at 52 Clinton Street. It appears to have originally been run by a Souda & Graham, who were listed as proprietors in 1904 at 49 Academy Street. The company appears to have struggled, but by 1907, it was taken over by William F. Hoffmann and some associates and relocated to 52 & 54 Lafayette Street. They greatly expanded and advertised heavily in the directories until 1913, when it appears to have gone inactive. Hoffman appears to have turned his attention to the Standard Oil Supply Company, another corporation he owned, also located at 52 Lafayette Street. The corporation continued until at least 1918, but no longer was listed in the directories nor did it advertise. Hoffman also owned a company called the South Jersey Glass Works and the Brewer's & Bottlers' Supply Company bottles were likely made there. The markings appear on the base of the bottles. Notes Bridgeton Glass Works, (1855-1870),\n\nBridgeton, NJ, United States, Occurs on 10 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. The Bridgeton Glass Works was operated by Joel Bodine & Sons until 1855, when they sold it to Maul, Hebrew & Company, who only operated it for a short period until the failed. The works were then purchased by General David Potter and Francis I. Bodine (Potter & Bodine) in 1855 or 1856 at sheriffs sale and operated under the name of the Bridgeton Glass Works. In 1863, it became F. & J. Bodine, but at least one bottle from this period indicates the name Bridgeton Glass Works was retained. About 1870, it became the Cohansey Glass Manufacturing company. The markings appear on the reverse side of the bottles or across the front and reverse sides. Bright & Sons, (approx: 1870-approx: 1875),\n\nBridlington, England, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nAppears on soda bottles. No information could be found on this firm or a glass works in Bridlington. A marked bottle is dated 1873, so production must have been limited. The markings appear on the heel of the bottle and ring the base. Each line on the illustration represents a different side to the bottle. Notes British Siphon Company, (approx: 1905-approx: 1930),\n\nLondon, England, Occurs on 16 bottles,\n\nAppears on soda bottles. No tangible information could be found on this firm. It may have been an successor of a company called the British Siphon Manufacturing Company and the predecessor of a limited liability company. The markings are on the face of the bottle below the etching. Notes Brooke Glass Company, (1891-approx: 1899),\n\nWellsboro, WV, United States, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nAppears on soda-shaped milk bottles. This company was chartered in 1891 by the West Virginia Legislature. The operation ran into problems in 1897, when it was put up for auction, but appears to have operated sporadically until about 1899. In 1908, the plant was reopened as the Crescent Glass Company, which was in operation until at least 1998. The markings are on the base of the bottle. Notes Burdett, Thomas, (1895-1915),\n\nMontreal, QC, Canada, Occurs on 3 bottles,\n\nAppears on soda bottles. There is little history on Thomas Burdett. We know he was born in England about 1844 and that he came to Canada and operated a hotel starting about 1870. Apparently, he was married to two women and had separate families living in different parts of Montreal and when he was found out absconded for seven years. He returned to Montreal and operated a hotel again in 1893. In 1895, he patented a beer cooler and pump and this appears to have triggered a foray into a hotel supply business.. As such he was an agent for all sorts of goods from billiard tables to gasoline lighting systems. It also included soda fountains and bottlers supplies and he was an agent for the glass maker Richard Cooper & Son Ltd. of Scotland. Burdett either died or went bankrupt in 1915 and the business came under control of his widow and G. N. Valade as Burdett & Valade, which operated until 1927. The markings are on the reverse of the bottle. Notes Burgin & Sons, (1852-1903),\n\nPhiladelphia, PA, United States, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. This works was purported to have been established in 1841 by Burgin, Pearsall & Hartshorne as the Philadelphia Vial and Bottle Works. The works were north of East Girard on what is today Montgomery Street. During 1852 or early in 1853 the firm went from Burgin, Fowler & Company to Burgin & Sons and remained in operation well into the Twentieth Century. The factory burned in 1875 causing $20,000 in damages and again 1879 and 1887, when some out buildings burned. This factory was one of the first to use gas powered furnaces. The name changed to Burgin & Sons Glass Company in 1903 and was involved in a law suit in 1910. It closed soon afterwards. The markings are on the front of the bottles. Burlington Glass Company, (1877-1909),\n\nHamilton, ON, Canada, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. The Burlington Glass works started in 1875 and was incorporated in 1877. It was sold to the Diamond Glass Company, of Montreal, in 1909. The markings are on the reverse side on the heel. Busch, Adolphus, Glass Company, (1886-1892),\n\nBelleville, IL, United States, (1886-1892),\n\nSaint Louis, MO, United States, (1891-1892), Occurs on 13 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soft drink bottles. In 1886, Adolphus Busch purchased the bankrupt Belleville Glass Works and formed the Adolphus Busch Glass Company. In 1891, a new plant was opened in Saint Louis near the AnheuserBusch brewery at 3rd & Barton. The following year, 1892, the Adolphus Busch Glass Manufacturing Company was organized. The markings are on the base of the bottles. Notes Busch, Adolphus, Glass Manufacturing Company, (1892-1926),\n\nBelleville, IL, United States, (1892-1905),\n\nSaint Louis, MO, United States, (1892-1926), Occurs on 35 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soft drink bottles. In 1886, Adolphus Busch purchased the bankrupt Belleville Glass Works and formed the Adolphus Busch Glass Company. In 1891, a new plant was opened in Saint Louis near the Anheuser-Busch brewery at 3rd & Barton. The following year, 1892, the Adolphus Busch Glass Manufacturing Company was organized. The Belleville plant closed in 1894 due to a depression and did not reopen until 1899. In 1900, a major fire destroyed the St. Louis works and the operations were shifted to the closed Frederick Heitz plant closer to the AnheuserBusch brewery at Main & Dorcas Streets. Another fire destroyed the plant at this location in 1905. In this same year, the Belleville plant became part of the American Bottle Company. Since the Saint Louis plant was in ruins at this time, it was not part of the new consolidation. The Belgium Pavilion from the 1904 Worlds Fair in Saint Louis was purchased and reassembled as the new Saint Louis plant. The Saint Louis plant was closed about 1926. The markings are on the base of the bottles. Notes Bushwick Glass Works, (1864-1913),\n\nBrooklyn, NY, United States, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. This factory was started by James Brookfield, a seasoned glass man, and his son William Brookfield. The family had recently moved from Honesdale, Pennsylvania where that had a glass factory. William paid the tax on the factory in 1865 and 1866 and his name was associated with the works in later years. In 1898, the Brookfield Glass company was organized and both it and the Bushwick Glass Works were advertised concurrently until 1913 in City Directories. It is believed that the factory in Brooklyn was closed at this time and a plant in New Jersey operated until 1921. The marking is on the base of the bottle. Notes Camden Glass Works, (approx: 1850-1852),\n\nCamden, NJ, United States, Occurs on 4 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. No information is currently available on this glass factory. There was a Thomas Burns listed as a glass manufacturer in Camden in 1851, who is not currently associated with any factory. The marking is on the reverse side of the bottle. Campbell Glass Works, (1884-1885),\n\nWest Berkeley, CA, United States, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. John Campbell and J. H. Flickinger formed the Campbell Glass Works and started construction in late 1884. It was incorporated as the Campbell Glass Manufacturing Company in 1885. This plant closed in July of 1885. The markings are on the base of the bottle. Campbell, Terrence, Company, (1903-1905),\n\nPittsburgh, PA, United States, Occurs on 4 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. This factory started as the American Glass Works, a window glass plant, located on the south side of Pittsburgh at 21st & Mary streets. This works was started about 1866 by Page, Zellers & Duff. In 1872, the operating firm became Duff & Campbell and in 1879, Duncan, Campbell & Company. In 1884, it became T. Campbell & Company and finally in 1891, simply T. Campbell Company. Property was bought at Blair Station and a new factory erected and operations moved from the South Side of Pittsburgh to this new location. The works two factories operated only as a window glass plant thru all of these years. With the formation of the conglomerate called the American Window Glass Company, the smaller independents, including Campbell Company were under increasing pressure. This pressure resulted in T. Campbell Company to expand its focus to include products other than just window glass. In June of 1903, it filed and had its charter legally modified to include \"glass bottles, vials and the products of glass\" in addition to window glass. This product expansion did not improve the performance of the company and it closed in early 1905 and was liquated by the middle of the year. The markings are on the reverse of the bottle near the base. Notes Cannington, Shaw & Company, (1875-1892),\n\nSaint Helens, ENG, England, Occurs on 7 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. Edwin Cannington and John Shaw established this works in 1875 called the Sherdley Glass Works. The company became a limited liability company in 1892. This company was absorbed into the United Glass Bottle Manufacturers, Limited in 1913. The markings are on the reverse heel or base of the bottle. Cannington, Shaw & Company Limited, (1892-1913),\n\nSaint Helens, ENG, England, Occurs on 7 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. Edwin Cannington and John Shaw established this works in 1875 called the Sherdley Glass Works. The company became a limited liability company in 1892. This company was absorbed into the United Glass Bottle Manufacturers, Limited in 1913. The markings are on the reverse heel or base of the bottle. Canton Glass Company, (1880-1899),\n\nCanton, OH, United States, (1880-1894), Occurs on 2 bottles,\n\nMarion, IN, United States, (1894-1899),\n\nManufactured beer bottles. This company's focus was on the manufacture of tableware, but it also manufactured bottles and is famous for its blue \"Canton Domestic Fruit Jar.\" In 1894, the company moved to Marion, Indiana and later, in 1899, became part of the National Glass Syndicate. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle. Chambers, Alexander & David H., (1843-1888),\n\nPittsburgh, PA, United States, Occurs on 434 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. This firm was created with the dissolution of Chambers, Agnew & Company in 1843. David Chambers died in 1862 and Alexander Chambers died in 1875, but the firm continued until about 1888. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle and rarely on the base. Champion Stopper Manufacturing Company, (approx: 1882-approx: 1885),\n\nGreenfield, MA, United States, Occurs on 2 bottles,\n\nAppears on beer and soda bottles. This firm marketed Augustus Rich's bottle stopper, which was patented on January 10, 1882. Since this closure never achieved any great level of success, the company must have been short lived. The markings are on the base of the bottle. Notes Chase Valley Glass Company No. 1 (1880-1881),\n\nChase Valley Glass Company No. 2 (1880-1881),\n\nMilwaukee, WI, United States, Occurs on 23 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda and beer bottles. Due to the demand for beer bottles in Milwaukee, Dr. Enoch Chase formed two glass manufacturing companies near his farm in Chase Valley. Company one was fully owned by Dr. Chase and did not produce many soda or beer bottles. Dr. Chase had a controlling interest in company number two, with a minority interest held by other local businessmen. This company produced the bulk of the soda and beer bottles. Some bottles are not marked with the \"No 1\" or \"No 2\" designation and it is uncertain which of the two companies manufactured them. The factories were built and commenced production in 1880 and were consolidated and reorganized in the summer of 1881 as the Wisconsin Glass Company. Dr Enoch went on to be a state senator for the 1882-84 term. The markings are typically on the base of the bottle. Chattanooga Bottle & Glass Company,\n\nChattanooga, TN, United States (1901-1929), Occurs on 5 bottles, Tallapoosa, GA, United States (1917-1926),\n\nManufactured soda and beer bottles. Charles Reif founded this company in 1901 to makes bottles for the brewery that his family owned and for other southern bottlers and medicine manufactures. The initial products were green, amber and flint bottles and window glass. The window glass segment of the business was soon dropped in the first year and the focus concentrated on supplying the Southern markets with bottles. Early on they started to supply Coca-Cola bottlers with bottles and soda bottles became a specialty of the firm for years to come. The company expanded in 1917 when it reopened the Tallapoosa Glass Company plant in Tallapoosa, GA, but closed the plant in 1926. In the later years, milk bottles and vinegar bottles were listed as specialties. The company became the Chattanooga Glass Company in 1929 and continues to operate today as a division of Diamond Container General. The markings are typically on the base of the bottle and occasionally on the heel. Notes Clyde Glass Works, (1864-1880, 1895-1915),\n\nClyde, NY, United States, Occurs on 79 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. A bottle bottle blowing factory was opened in by Southwick and Woods. This factory was merged with a window glass factory, also in Clyde, under the name of Southwick, Reed & Company a short time later. In 1880, the name of the plant became Ely, Son & Hoyt and in 1886, with the death of William Ely, the firm became Ely Sons & Hoyt. (See E. S. & H.) In 1895, the firm was incorporated as Clyde Glass Works. The works stopped operation in 1915 and later efforts to reactivate it failed. The markings appear on the base. Codd & Rylands, (1881-1884),\n\nBarnsley, England, Occurs on 4 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. This partnership was formed in 1877 between Ben Rylands and Hiram Codd. Rylands owned the Hope Glass Works and Codd held the patent for a marble closure for soda bottles. Ben Rylands died in 1881 and his son Dan joined the firm in his place. At this time the name was changed to \"Codd & Rylands.\" The partnership with Codd dissolved in late 1884. The Hope Glass Works used the mark of \"4\" on its glassware to signify it products attributes of accuracy, cleanliness, neatness and strength. The markings appear on the reverse heel of the bottle. Codd, Hiram, & Company, (1880-1890),\n\nNew York, NY, United States, Occurs on 34 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. Hiram Codd was awarded United States patents for his English Globe Stoppered bottles in 1872 and 1873. At the 1876 Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia, Codd won a medal for his patented bottles. Seeing potential in the American market, between 1876 and 1880 Codd set up an American Agency to market licenses for his patented bottles at 22 Park Row in New York City. Initially the bottles were manufactured at the \"Patentee's own works at Barnsley.\" Codd & Co. continued their English practice of licensing bottles by geographic region. This was suppose to limit the trafficking of the bottles as they were of no use to other bottlers. The American licensed bottles have the licensed number embossed within a star and numbers between 1 and 95 are recorded. Hiram Codd held license number 1 and that may explain the wide variety of these bottles. He likely sold these to licensees for use while their private mold bottles were being manufactured and shipped from England. Number 1 bottles have been found in numbers in Pensacola, Philadelphia, and other cities were Codd licenses were sold. By 1886, Codd & Co. had moved to 22 Commerce St. and had shifted the manufacture of the bottles from England to Whitney Brothers glass factory at Glassboro, N. J. The firm was still at 22 Commerce in 1890, but no references could be found after that date. Codd's 1873 patent would have expired in 1890 and as Codd had died several years earlier, it seems likely the firm was dissolved soon after. Notes Cohansey Glass Manufacturing Company, (1870-1911),\n\nBridgeton, NJ, United States (1870-1900),\n\nDowningtown, PA, United States(1900-1911), Occurs on 13 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. Also know as the Cohansey Glass Company in later years. This company was formed with the dissolution of F. & J. Bodine in 1870. During the 1890s it was beseeched with strikes and a major one at the Bridgeton plant in 1899 may have lead to its relocation from Bridgeton, New Jersey to Downingtown, Pennsylvania in 1900. Records indicate the works were operating as late as 1906, but were closed by 1914. Most authors quote 1911 as the final date. The markings appear on the reverse heel oh the bottle and are usually followed by a number. Colorado City Glass Company, (1889-1893),\n\nColorado City, CO, United States, Occurs on 17 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. This factory was formed with capital from Adolphus Busch of Saint Louis and Jerome B. Wheeler of New York as principal share holders. It consisted of a bottle and flint factory. The factory sustained a major fire in 1892, but was rebuilt. The silver panic of 1893 was partially responsible for its closure. The markings usually appear on the base of the bottle, but in at least one instance on the heel. Colorado Glass Works, Colorado Glass Works Company, (1887-1888),\n\nGolden, CO, United States, Occurs on 2 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. The name was changed from the Colorado Glass Works to the Colorado Glass Works Company after five months of operation. A furnace collapse and labor dispute, brought the works to a halt in December of 1888. The markings are normally on the base of the bottle and rarely on its heel. Cooper, Richard, & Company, Limited, (1895-aprox: 1928),\n\nPortobello, Scotland, England, Occurs on 7 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. This glass works was founded in 1829 as a flint glass works by William Bailey. In 1848, Bailey converted the works to green glass, which was more profitable. In 1857, with the introduction of Richard Cooper, the firm became Bailey & Cooper. With Bailey's death in 1859, Cooper's brother-in-law, Thomas Wood joined the firm as Cooper and Wood. This partnership split in 1866, with each partner taking a part of the factory and running their own glass works. The firm Richard Cooper & Company became a limited liability company in 1895. These works were acquired by the Wood Bottle Company about 1928. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle. Coshocton Glass Company, (1902-1921),\n\nCoshocton, OH, United States, Occurs on 31 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. In 1899, a Board of Trade was organized to attract new manufacturers to Coshocton. The Board sold building lots to investors and used the proceeds to pay bonuses to attract manufacturers to the City. Towards the end of 1901, the Board enticed the Saltsburg Glass Co., to open a plant in Coshocton with three acres of ground and a $15,000 bonus. The deal was completed at the end of 1901 and building of the factory started soon after. Saltsburg abandoned its facilities in Pennsylvania. Production started in May of 1902 with an amber tank having 6 rings employing 50 men and boys including 18 blowers. Beer bottlers were the main product. The factory did not grow as expected, so in 1904, Thomas Gainor, who managed the Everett works in Newark and spent 7 years as a sales manager, was enticed to invest and manage the works. Under Gainor, the works expanded greatly, a green glass ring was added and the amber ring expanded, and when he left two years later, the works employed 450. Possibly due to a failure to secure financing to increase the Coshocton plant, a substantial offer from Everett, or knowledge of Everett's acquisition of Owens' blowing machines that would revolutionize the industry, Gainor returned to Everett and the Liewer brothers increased their share to become majority shareholders. In 1908, a flint tank was added for prescription ware and liquor bottles, but it does not appear as this line was long-lasting and the focus returned to beverage bottles. It appears that automatic bottle machines were in operation by 1915 and a new modern plant was built in 1916 in front of the old plant to meet the growing demand for beer, soda and Coca-Cola bottles. Waning demand for beer bottles caused by National Prohibition, a series of equipment failures, loss of key employees and poor quality product caused the cessation of operations in 1921. The Liewer brothers sold the works to a group of local investors in 1923 and the new company was called the Coshocton Glass Corporation. Although the plant was originally supposed to manufacture bottles, numerous delays in startup resulted in the plant producing glass tableware instead. The works went into receivership in 1927 and attempts to sell the works were unsuccessful. The property was liquidated in 1930. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottles. Notes Cream City Glass Company, (1888-1893),\n\nMilwaukee, WI, United States, Occurs on 20 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. In 1888, this company was organized to reopen the failed Wisconsin Glass Company factory, which had sat idle for five years. The company prospered for some time with seven hundred employees in 1892, but the economic panic of 1893 closed its doors. The markings are on the base of the bottles. Cumberland Glass Manufacturing Company, (1885-1920),\n\nBridgeton, NJ, United States, Occurs on 0 bottles,\n\nManufactured both soda and beer bottles. Joseph A. Clark & Company were organized in August of 1880 and that same year built a factory on Water Street in Bridgeton. The plant was also know as the Cumberland Glass Works. The factory was soon moved to Laurel Street and in 1885, the company was reorganized as the Cumberland Glass Manufacturing Company. This firm became the second largest glass works in New Jersey and was targeted by labor bosses for unionization, which it resisted until 1899. Up until this settlement, there were an number of strikes and violent confrontations starting in the late 1880s. The firm was an early adopter of semi-automated and automated bottle machines. Cumberland purchased a number of its Bridgeton based competitors between 1902 and 1909. Cumberland itself was purchased by the Illinois Glass company in April of 1920. Although no bottles are known with a distinct Cumberland mark, a number of bottles have been identified with known mold number markings. The markings are on the base of the bottle. Notes Cunningham & Company, (1857-1866),\n\nPittsburgh, PA, United States, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nManufactured at least one marked soda bottle as well as numerous flasks and fruit jars. The company was the successor to W. Cunningham & Company in 1857 when Dominick Ihmsen joined the firm as a partner. Marked bottles date from all years of operation. The company was succeeded by Cunningham & Ihmsen. The markings are usually on the front heel of the bottle. Cunningham & Company, (1878-1885),\n\nCunningham & Company, Inc., (1900-1907),\n\nPittsburgh, PA, United States, Occurs on 89 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. The company was organized in 1878 with the withdraw of Dominick Ihmsen from Cunningham & Ihmsen. The company was made up of various Cunningham family members until it became Cunningham & Company, Limited in 1886. In 1900, the limited was dropped and the firms was incorporated. The same mark was used on these later bottles. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle and occasionally on the base. The later marks are often followed with a number with 2, 3, and 4 known. Cunningham & Company Limited, (1886-1900),\n\nPittsburgh, PA, United States, Occurs on 119 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. The company was organized out of Cunningham & Company in 1886. The name Limited was dropped in 1900 when the company was incorporated. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle and are often followed by 2, NO 5, NO 7, 9. Cunningham & Ihmsen, (1866-1878),\n\nPittsburgh, PA, United States, Occurs on 145 bottles,\n\nManufactured both soda and beer bottles. The company was the successor to Cunningham & Company in 1866. Marked bottles date from all years of operation. The company was succeeded by Cunningham & Company, with the retirement of Dominick Ihmsen in 1878. The markings are usually on the reverse heel of the bottle, but occasionally appear on the bottle's base. Cunningham, Domenic O'Connor, (1882-1897),\n\nPittsburgh, PA, United States, Occurs on 341 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. When Domenic O'Connor Cunningham inherited money he formed his own glass manufacturing company. Previously, he had been a member of Cunningham & Company. D. O. Cunningham incorporated in 1897. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle. Cunningham, Dominic, Company Inc., (1897-1931),\n\nPittsburgh, PA, United States, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. Domenic O'Connor Cunningham incorporated in 1897. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle. D. Bottle Works, (approx: 1890-approx: 1900),\n\nUnknown, United States, Occurs on 4 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. This company is currently unidentified. A numbers of bottles marked as such were found the Long Island Sound area and Central Pennsylvania. The markings are on the base of the bottle. Notes. D. Glass Company, (approx: 1895-approx: 1900),\n\nUnknown, United States, Occurs on 5 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. This company is currently unidentified. Numbers of bottles marked as such were found the Mid-Atlantic Costal States. The markings are on the base of the bottle. The Dixie Glass Company and Duquesne Glass Company used similar marks. Dale, Brown, & Company, Limited, (1913-1988),\n\nSwinton, England, Occurs on 2 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. This company was still hand blowing glass in 1928. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle. De Steiger Glass Company (1878-approx: 1896),\n\nBuffalo, IA, United States (1880-approx:1882),\n\nLa Salle, IL, United States (1878-approx: 1896), Occurs on 34 bottles,\n\nAppears on beer bottles. The history of this works is complex and incomplete. Francis Stiger and his wife Elizabeth resided in Peru Iowa, where he was a miner as early as 1845. Some time between 1860 and 1870, Francis died and the widow Elizabeth took her children to Saint Louis. The oldest son Philip was listed as a painter in 1870. In 1878 Elizabeth (now De Steiger) moved with her children Philip (32), Mary (29), Joseph (20) and Edward (18) to La Salle, Illinois. Philip must have been the driver behind the creation of the De Steiger Glass Company in 1878, as he was listed as a glass manufacturer in 1880 and president of the company in 1882. The company had capital of $50,000, purchased the old window glass works and built modern bottle factories as well. How this widow and her children went from meager means to founding a large glass works is a mystery that needs to be researched. A second plant in Buffalo, Iowa was acquired about 1880 and remained in business for several years. Seeing a market for \"German turn mold bottles\" (a practice of placing straw or wood shavings in the mold and turning the bottle as it was being blown to remove the mold seams and polish the bottle), De Steiger discharged the existing glass workers during the summer of 1880 and a new crew of German workers were imported. Many of their fired workers went to Streator and the influx of bottle blowers may have been the impetus that sparked the Streator Bottle & Glass Company to be organized in 1881. The De Steiger plants used Sieman's continuous tanks which were in use in Europe, but not in America. Discharging its workers, importing lesser paid foreigners, and using new technology that allowed bottles to be blown 24 hours a day caused problems with the Bottle Blowers' League, an early union. In the midst of this, the business was running into financial difficulties and ended up in litigation which resulted in a sheriff's sale in 1883. It was noted that some workers went to Streator in that year as well. The Bank of Peru appears to have been the purchaser. Later that year, a devastating fire destroyed both factories. The factories were rebuilt in early 1884, but appear to have been idle later that year and were idle in 1886 and noted as to have gone through several owners. The works appeared to have reopened sometime before 1890 and there were advertisements until 1896 in the National Bottlers Gazette. The markings appear on the base of the bottle. Notes Dean, Foster & Company, (1874-approx: 1909),\n\nBoston, MA, United States, Occurs on 101 bottles,\n\nAppears on beer bottles. George Foster had established the New Granite Glass Works in 1861 and moved to Boston in 1862 to establish a glass ware house initially at 106 State Street and later was a agent at 14 Blackstone. The E. A. Buck & Company, of 14 Blackstone Street, operated the Westford Glass Works and failed in 1873. Charles S. Dean, who was partner and Elmer G. Foster, a clerk at the same address, formed Dean, Foster & Company and briefly operated a glass works in Westford, but also purchased wares from the Dorfling Glass Company in White Mills, Pennsylvania. In 1875, the firm consisted of C. L. Dean, E. G. Foster, and A. G. Smalley. This company originally specialized in druggists' ware, but later branched into beer bottles. In 1883 a Chicago branch was established with Arthur Dawley, an employee since 1876, and the firm was Dean, Foster & Dawley. Dawley sold his interest back to his partners in 1889 and in 1893, the Chicago branch became A. M. Foster & Company. The markings appear on the base of the bottle. Dean, Foster & Dawley, (1883-1889),\n\nChicago, IL, United States, Occurs on 9 bottles,\n\nAppears on beer bottles. Charles S. Dean, who was partner and Elmer G. Foster formed Dean, Foster & Company and briefly operated a glass works in Westford. This company originally specialized in druggists' ware, but later branched into beer bottles. In 1883 a Chicago branch was established with Arthur Dawley, an employee since 1876, and the firm was Dean, Foster & Dawley. Dawley sold his interest back to his partners in 1889. The markings appear on the base of the bottle. Notes Diamond Glass Company, (1886-1985),\n\nRoyersford, PA, United States, Occurs on 81 bottles,\n\nManufactured both soda and beer bottles. In 1886 a group of investors purchased the Penn Glass Works in Royersford and renamed it the Diamond Glass Company. Most marked bottles date 1886 to 1890 and have smooth bases. The company became purchased in 1985 to become part of Diamond-Bathurst in 1985. The markings are on the base of the bottle. Dixie Glass Company (Works), (1897-1907),\n\nTallapoosa, GA, United States, Occurs on 72 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. The Dixie Glass \"Company\" is recorded to have opened on a cooperative basis in 1897 operating at the old Piedmont Glass factory. The Tallapoosa area was a center for wine making and the wineries need glass bottles to package their wares. The company appears to have been reorganized in 1900, as the Dixie Glass \"Works\" and Charles H. Pancoast, formerly manager at Augusta and Atlanta glass works, was president of the company. In 1902, the plant was expanded with a continuous tank and E. P. C. Fowler, a local bottler and ice dealer, was president the works. By 1905, George W. Sheppard, the local bank president was running the operation. In 1906 the works were expanded again and perhaps the works could not sustain the expense, because they were bankrupt in February of 1907. In July 1907, the works were purchased by George M. Greely for $14,100 and the Tallapoosa Glass Manufacturing Co. was organized to operate the facilities. The markings are on the base of the bottle. Notes Dobson, John W., (approx: 1882-approx: 1898),\n\nBarnsley, England, Occurs on 3 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. In 1872 Sutcliff and Wade started the Oaks Glass Bottle Works in Barnsley. In 1877 Dobson joined the partnership. One year later the firm was known as Wade & Dobson and continued until at least 1879. By 1884, Dobson alone was the proprietor of the Oaks Glass Bottle Works. By 1899, it had become a limited liability company and by 1903, it was known as Dobson & Nail, Limited. Dobson & Nail also manufactured bottle cases and some bottles are marked as such a way. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle. Dobson & Nail. Limited, (approx: 1903-1955),\n\nBarnsley, England, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. In 1872 Sutcliff and Wade started the Oaks Glass Bottle Works in Barnsley. In 1877 Dobson joined the partnership. One year later the firm was known as Wade & Dobson and continued until at least 1879. By 1884, Dobson alone was the proprietor of the Oaks Glass Bottle Works. By 1899, it had become a limited liability company and by 1903, it was known as Dobson & Nail, Limited. Dobson & Nail also manufactured bottle cases and some bottles are marked as such a way. The company was dissolved in 1955. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle. Duquesne Glass Company, (1905-1917),\n\nPaden City, WV, United States, Occurs on 24 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. This company was incorporated on November 9, 1905. That same year another company named the Duquesne Glass Company was incorporated in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to manufacture insulators. These two companies were in no way related. The Paden City firm was also incorporated by Pittsburgh men and the driving force in its creation was August J. Rittman, an experienced factory manager who worked at the Poughkeepsie Glass Works, the Colonial Glass Company in Kingston, New York and before founding Duquesne, at the Cunningham & Co. factory in Pittsburgh. Like Cunningham & Co., the initial specialty was soda and beer bottles. Rittman left to work at the Coshocton Glass Company about 1907. The factory did well until about 1912, but then the business tapered off and the focus was shifted to medicine bottles. Eventually the plant went idle. In August of 1917, the works were acquired by the American Glass Works of Richmond, Virginia and the output was primarily extract bottles for the Sauer Company. The plant is reported to have remained open until 1935. The marks are on the reverse heel of the bottles and are very similar to the Cunningham marks, likely a practice copied by Rittman from his time at Cunningham & Co., with the initials followed by a mold number. Notes Dyottville Glass Works, (1847-approx: 1888),\n\nPhiladelphia, PA, United States, Occurs on 133 bottles,\n\nManufactured both soda and beer bottles. Most marked bottles date 1850 to 1858 and bear improved pontils. The markings are usually on the reverse of the bottle, but occasionally occur either on the bottle's shoulder or base. E. Glass Works, (approx: 1895-approx: 1910),\n\nUnknown, United States, Occurs on 3 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. Appears on a Hutchinson bottles from the North Western Pennsylvania towns of Ridgway and Connellsville and may be from a period glass works mentioned in nearby Brockwayville. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle. Notes Eagle Glass Works, (1847-1849),\n\nPhiladelphia, PA, United States, Occurs on 2 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer bottles. This works was first advertised in 1848, but is believed to have started earlier. It continued to be listed in 1849 in various directories and on a map. By 1850, there was no trace of this company. The one marked bottle is embossed \"Eagle Works\" and appears on the lower part of the bottle. Eagles, W., (approx: 1890-approx: 1910),\n\nManchester, England, Occurs on 3 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. No information was found for this firm. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle. East Lake Glass Works, (1883-1904),\n\nBridgeton, NJ, United States, Occurs on 36 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer bottles. These works were opened in the later part of 1883 under the proprietorship of Dr. John B. Bowen and Joseph C. Kirby. Dr. Bowen was the brother-in-law of Kirby, who was a successful dentist. The works employed about 80 men and boys and were located on Manheim Avenue near East Commerce. David McBride, a successful farmer, merchant and ex-sheriff, bought out Bowen soon after and the firm was known as Kirby & McBride by 1885. McBride died in 1894 and his wife continued to function as partner until February of 1904, when they works were sold to I Whelden Moore. The markings are on the base of the bottle and and are known with numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. Notes Ellenville Glass Works, (1862-1896),\n\nEllenville, NY, United States, Occurs on 9 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer bottles. This works was founded in 1836 by a group of men from the Willington Glass Company in Connecticut. Initially it was named the Ellenville Glass Company and retained this name, according to sources, until after the Civil War, when in 1866, the name became the Ellenville Glass Works. However, there were \"Glass Works\" bottles recovered from a shipwreck that occurred in 1864. It is thus more likely the name changed between 1862 and 1864 from \"Company\" to \"Works.\" After a failure, the works were sold to Charles A. Edwards and the company became the Ellenville Glass Factory. However, it is still referred to by contemporary sources as the \"Ellenville Glass Works.\" This name was retained until its closing in 1896. The markings are on the base of the bottle. Ely Son & Hoyt, (1880-1886),\n\nEly Sons & Hoyt, (1886-1895),\n\nClyde, NY, United States, Occurs on 26 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. A bottle bottle blowing factory was opened in by Southwick and Woods. This factory was merged with a window glass factory, also in Clyde, under the name of Southwick, Reed & Company a short time later. In 1880, the name of the plant became Ely, Son & Hoyt and in 1886, with the death of William Ely, the firm became Ely Sons & Hoyt. In 1895, the firm was incorporated as Clyde Glass Works. (See Clyde Glass Works.) The works stopped operation in 1915 and later efforts to reactivate it failed. The markings appear on the base. Erie Glass Company Limited, (1892-1893+),\n\nPort Colborne, ON, Canada, Occurs on 8 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. Natural gas discoveries near Port Colborne were the impetus for attracting industries to the area. Starting in 1891, negotiations were under way to build a glass factory there. The Erie Glass Company, operated out of Toronto, started operation in Port Colborne in 1892. A wide range of products, included fruit jars, soda, medicine, and mucilage bottles were manufactured. Both green and flint wares were produced. The factory burned in February 1893 and it is not known if it was rebuilt. What is know is that in 1894, the Erie Glass Company was in liquidation and there were no listings in the 1895 Port Colborne directory. The markings are on the base of the bottle. Notes Everett, Edward H., (1880-1885),\n\nNewark, OH, United States, Occurs on 38 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. Everett purchased the Newark Star Glass Works in 1880. Everett incorporated his Company in 1885. In 1904, Everett merged his factory with those in Massillon and Wooster into the $4 million Ohio Bottle Company. The following year this company sold some of its land to Everett's newly incorporated Newark Machine Bottle Company, which would install the Owens Automatic machines. In August 1905, the Ohio Bottle and Newark Machine Bottle Companies merged with others to become the American Bottle Company with $10 million in capital. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle. Often there is a number following the marking. Everett, Edward H., & Company, (1885-1904),\n\nNewark, OH, United States, Occurs on 245 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. Everett purchased the Newark Star Glass Works in 1880. Everett incorporated his Company in 1885. In 1904, Everett merged his factory with those in Massillon and Wooster into the $4 million Ohio Bottle Company. The following year this company sold some of its land to Everett's newly incorporated Newark Machine Bottle Company, which would install the Owens Automatic machines. In August 1905, the Ohio Bottle and Newark Machine Bottle Companies merged with others to become the American Bottle Company with $10 million in capital. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle. Everett Glass Company, Limited, (1890-1901),\n\nEverett, PA, United States, Occurs on 7 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. In 1890, this company reopened the Everett glass works plant that closed in 1885. When its plant manager died in 1894, David Pugh, who managed the Queen City Glass Company in Cumberland, Maryland took over. He introduced the manufacture of flint beer and mineral bottles to the output of the firm. The bottles were reported to be so hard that they could be used to drive nails. The works never appear to have been very profitable and the stockholders considered selling to several syndicates that wanted to corner the flint trade. When these deals fell thru, they closed the plant in 1901 and sold to a new corporation called the Everett Glass Company in mid-1902. This company closed up shop in 1906 and the factory was never reopened. The markings are on the base of the bottle. Notes Facile Bottle Stopple Company, (1887-1889),\n\nNew York, NY, United States, Occurs on 4 bottles,\n\nAppears on beer bottles. This company marketed George Fullerton's bottle stopper and was assigned a third of the 1888 patent. Fullerton's 1887 patent was partially assigned to William F. Duncan of New York City and it is likely he was involved in organizing this company. The company had a claim in 1889 that was unsettled in 1895 and since Duncan is not identified with this company in 1890, it seems it went out of business during 1889. The marking is on the base of the bottle. Fahnestock, Albree & Company, (approx: 1860-1871),\n\nPittsburgh, PA, United States, Occurs on 29 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. The firm consisted of Robert C. Albree and B. L. Fahnestock. This firm was organized in 1860 and remain in effect until 1871. The markings are usually on the front heel of the bottle. Fairmont Bottle Company, (1906-approx: 1914),\n\nFairmont, WV, United States, Occurs on 4 bottle,\n\nManufactured soda bottles.

F. Robey, all of Fairmont, West Virginia. This plant also manufactured milk bottles. The last found reference was in 1913. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle. Notes Fairmont Bottle & Fruit Jar Company, (1892-1893),\n\nFairmont, WV, United States, Occurs on 13 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer bottles. This glass factory was first chartered on April 26, 1892. The initial incorporators were E. J. Bebee, Robert Johns, Jonathan R. Johns, Jonathan E. Beebe, all of Finlay, Ohio and Abram Kesley of Martins Creek, Pennsylvania. They were attracted to Fairmont by the low cost of natural gas offered to glass manufactures. By 1911, five glass works operated there. The company was purported to have dissolved the following year and reorganized into Johns Brothers. However, It was still operating as late as September, 1893. Still later, the firm was known as the Fairmont Bottle Company. The markings are on the base of the bottle. Fairmount Glass Works, (1897-1945),\n\nFairmount, IN, United States, (1898-1906), Occurs on 13 bottles,\n\nIndianapolis, IN, United States, (1904-1945),\n\nManufactured soda bottles. The Fairmount Glass Company was founded in 1889 by John Rau, a practical glass man, W. C. Winslow, a banker, and a third party. On Winslow's death in 1894, his son Palmer Winslow became president of the firm. Palmer Winslow sold his interest to John Rau in 1897 or 1898. Winslow went on to establish a new works at Matthews, Indiana and John Rau renamed the factory the Fairmount Glass Works. Possibly because of the lack of a reliable source of fuel, in 1904, a new factory was built in Indianapolis and eventually all operations shifted to this location. The company was incorporated in 1945 as the Fairmount Glass Works, Inc., in 1960 became the Fairmount Glass Corp., in 1964 Fairmount Glass Co., and in 1968 it became a subsidiary of the the Glass Containers, Inc. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle. Notes Falls City Glass Company, (1884-1892),\n\nLouisville, KY, United States, Occurs on 5 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. This glass factory was first listed in 1884 and last appears on a 1892 insurance map. It was located on Lytle Street between 26th and 27th in the Portland section of Louisville. The markings are on the reverse heel or base of the bottle. Findlay Bottle Company, (1888-1893),\n\nFindley, OH, United States, Occurs on 2 bottle,\n\nManufactured beer bottles. The Findlay bottle company was organized in 1888 to take advantage of cheap natural gas that was found in and around Findlay, Ohio. It was one of many glassworks that opened there in the closing years of the 1880s who were enticed with five year contracts with marginal gas rates. Green glass bottles and fruit jars were its specialty. The company employed about 125 workers and operated eight pots. The demand of all the factories stressed the gas supply and factories were limited to only use gas in the furnaces and to use oil for auxiliary operations like annealing ovens. An inspection in the spring of 1893 found Findlay in violation of the this regulation and they were required to pay the highest rates. The went into receivership soon after and never recovered. The markings are on the base of the bottle. Notes Flugel & Company, (approx: 1890-approx: 1950),\n\nLondon, ENG, England, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nAppears on soda bottles. Flugel & Company appear to be suppliers to the soda water trade and most likely were jobbers for the bottles that bear their mark. The markings appear on the reverse heel and the base of bottles. Foster Brothers, (approx: 1855-approx: 1874),\n\nSaint Johns, QC, Canada, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. This works traces its origin to the Champlain Glass Company, a window glass works, which moved its operations from Burlington, Vermont to St. Johns, Canada East (Quebec) in 1846. This enterprise was a failure, but this window glass works appears to have continued as the Canada Glass Works until 1854, when it was purchased by Joseph Foster and retooled as a bottle factory. This firm produced bottles and insulators, one of which is dated 1858. The exact end of the Foster Brothers tenure is not certain, but it clearly occurred by 1875, when James Macpherson organized the St. John Glass Company, which went bankrupt in 1878. The Yuile Brothers purchased the works and were operating the factory in 1879 as the Excelsior Glass Company. They moved the factory to Montreal in 1880. Through a series of name changes and acquisitions it became the Dominion Glass Company. The markings are on the face of the bottle. Notes Frank, William, (1866-1869),\n\nPittsburgh, PA, United States, Occurs on 3 bottle,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. William Frank immigrated from Germany to the United States in 1840 and at some point lived in Ohio. In 1846, he came to Pittsburgh, became a naturalized citizen and ran a dry goods business. He was introduced to the glass business by his brother-in-law Ephraim Wormser. In 1858, the pair purchased some land four miles east of downtown Pittsburgh and built a glass factory. The firm name was E. Wormser & Company. Frank continued to operate the dry goods business as W. Frank & Co. until 1861. In March of 1866, William Frank gained full control of the business. Wormser turned his attention to an oil business founded a year earlier, in which Frank was also an investor. In 1870, the firm became W. Frank & Son. The markings are on the reverse heel or base of the bottle. Notes Frank, William, & Sons, (1870-1876),\n\nPittsburgh, PA, United States, Occurs on 5 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. Previous sources indicated that this firm was established in 1866, but this is not supported by directory listings, marked bottles, some of which bear William Frank's initials alone, and the fact that his sons would have been too young (20 & 18 years old) to have been partners in 1866. In 1870, Hiram and Samuel joined their father as W. Frank & Sons. This is the first year this firm appears in the directories. Later Abraham joined his brothers and father. The factory burned in 1874 and was rebuilt. 1876 is the last year the Frankstown Glass Works. This same listing has them also operating as auctioneers and the firm of W. Frank & Sons continued to operate the dry goods business until 1880, when William retired. The markings are on the reverse heel or base of the bottle. Notes Franklin Industrial Company, (1906-approx: 1909),\n\nWarwick, OH, United States, Occurs on 5 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. The Franklin Industrial Company was a conglomerate founded by investors from Massillon, Ohio. They purchased a number of industries in and around Warwick, Ohio. The company was named after Franklin Township, where Warwick is located. Most of these industries were related to mining sand, clay, stone and gravel, but also included a furnace company and the Warwick Glass Company. The firm advertised as a specialty beer bottles and produced mainly amber glass, but an aqua soda bottle is known. A fire in 1909 may have spelled the end of this factory as a Franklin enterprise. It could not be found as an inspected factory in the 1910 or 1911 Ohio reports. When the factory was reopened in 1913 as the Warwick Glass Company, accounts stated the it was \"long close.\" The other segments of the Franklin Industrial Company operated for decades. The markings are on the reverse heel of the bottle. Notes Franzen, William, & Son, Milwaukee, (1901-1926),\n\nMilwaukee, WI, United States, Occurs on 47 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer and soda bottles. William Frazen took over the financially failing Northern Glass Company in 1896. The company put a focus on producing beer bottles for Milwaukee's brewers and this would eventually lead to its downfall. Frazen incorporated the works as William Frazen & Son in 1901 and became Wisconsin's most successful glass manufacturer. However, when Prohibition fell in 1919, the need for beer bottles dried up. The Board of Directors voted to scale back operations in 1921 and the plant was closed in 1926. The markings appear on the base of the bottle and occasionally on the heel. G. & Company, (approx: 1895-1905),\n\nUnknown, United States, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. Appears on at least one Hutchinson shaped soda bottle from the Midwest.

Gayner Glass Works, (1898-1956),\n\nSalem, NJ, United States, Occurs on 3 bottles,\n\nManufactured mineral water bottles. John Gayner was born in England and learned the trade from his father while growing up there. He came to the United States with his wife and four children. After several failed attempts both in England and the United States, he succeeded in Salem. The firm name of the Gayner Glass Works was adopted in 1898. The works specialized in large wares and specialty items and continued to have hand blown operations, in addition to automated blowing machines, well after hand blowing shops were closed at other works. The business was sold to Star City Glass Company in 1956, but the Gayner name continued to be used for the Salem plant until 1975 when it was closed. It was briefly reopened in 1977, but closed permanently in 1979. The markings appear on the base of the bottle. Notes Glenshaw Glass Company, (1895-2007),\n\nGlenshaw, PA, United States, Occurs on 13 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. The Glenshaw Glass Company was started in 1895 by a group of Pittsburgh glass blowers. One of it specialties was the manufacture of siphon bottles. The company became Kelman Bottles LLC in 2008. Notes Greenbank Glass Works, (approx: 1840-1850, 1857-1858),\n\nGreen Bank, NJ, United States, Occurs on 2 bottles,\n\nManufactured beer bottles. William Coffin Sr. established this glass house in about 1840. Coffin died in 1844 and John H. Coffin took over management of the works. He closed the works in 1850. It was reopened in 1857 and operated for one year as a cooperative by a group of glassblowers and was permanently closed in 1858 on their failure. The markings appear on the reverse side of the bottle. H., W. S., (approx: 1890-approx: 1905),\n\nUnknown, United States, Occurs on 7 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles.

The markings appear on the base of the bottle. Hagerty Brothers & Company, (approx: 1869-1953),\n\nNew York, NY, United States, Occurs on 9 bottles,\n\nAppears on beer bottles. They were glass jobbers. The business started as Hagerty & Lear (Bernard B. Hagerty & Harry Lear), who were suppliers of druggists glassware and were in business as early as 1851 and possibly 1849, the date claimed in later advertisements. The firm became B. B. & J Hagerty by 1857 and remain so to at least 1862. They were located at 8 & 10 Platt Street in New York City and remained at this address for the next 70 plus years. By 1867 the firm became Hagerty Brothers and remained so until 1869 when it became Hagerty Brothers & Company, which it retained until 1953 when the business closed. For many years they represented the Haggerty Glass Works. This factory on Smith Street was known as the Hamilton Glass Works in 1851. By 1868, it was known as the Brooklyn Green Glass Works operated by a partnership between B. B. Hagerty, Wm. W. Gardiner and Wm. Burrows with Hagerty Brothers as agents. Later the works, now called the Hagerty Glass Works, were under the control of B. B. Hagerty & Co. with Hagerty Bros. & Co. as agents. By 1888, Annie J., Bernard's wife, was in control of the works as A. J. Hagerty & Co. and remained so until at least 1896 and Hagerty Bros & Co. were agents. The works were still in operation in 1900, but were closed by 1904. The markings appear on the base of the bottle. Hagerty Glass Works, (approx: 1870-approx: 1902),\n\nNew York, NY, United States, Occurs on 1 bottle,\n\nManufactured beer bottles. These works were located in Brooklyn. There were two distinct businesses associated with this glass factory at 531 Smith Street between 9th Street and Hamilton Avenue. The older business started as Hagerty & Lear (Bernard B. Hagerty & Harry Lear), who were suppliers of druggists glassware and were in business as early as 1851 and possibly 1849, the date claimed in later advertisements. The firm became B. B. & J Hagerty by 1857 and remain so to at least 1862. They were located at 8 & 10 Platt Street in New York City and remained at this address for the next 70 plus years. By 1867 the firm became Hagerty Brothers and remained so until 1869 when it became Hagerty Brothers & Company, which it retained until 1953 when the business closed. The factory on Smith Street was known as the Hamilton Glass Works in 1851. By 1868, it was known as the Brooklyn Green Glass Works operated by a partnership between B. B. Hagerty, Wm. W. Gardiner and Wm. Burrows with Hagerty Brothers as agents. Later the works, now called the Hagerty Glass Works, were under the control of B. B. Hagerty & Co. with Hagerty Bros. & Co. as agents. By 1888, Annie J., Bernard's wife, was in control of the works as A. J. Hagerty & Co. and remained so until at least 1896 and Hagerty Bros & Co. were agents. The works were still in operation in 1900, but were closed by 1904. The markings appear on the base of the bottle. Hahn & Foster, (1888-1889),\n\nNew York, NY, United States, Occurs on 13 bottles,\n\nAppears on beer bottles. The mark appears on the base of pint and quart champagne beer bottles mainly from Northeast Pennsylvania, Northern New Jersey, New York City and Long Island. This short lived firm was a partnership between the experienced bottle jobber Thomas J. Hahn, who was associated with Hastings and Hahn, and Henry G. Foster, a grocer. It would appear that Hahn was looking for a partner who could infuse capital into the business. The new firm moved to a more prestigious location on Murray Street and may have had the molds made for beer bottles allowing them to be more competitive offering individualized bottles to their clients. The firm was dissolved by the end of March, 1889. Foster went back to the grocery business and Hahn continued the bottle jobbing business and likely continued to use the two molds made for the previous firm. The markings appear on the base of the bottle. Notes Hamilton Glass Works, (1864-1891),\n\nHamilton, ON, Canada, Occurs on 15 bottles,\n\nManufactured soda bottles. According to the Hamilton Spectator, this factory started operation on September 12, 1864 and was owned by Gatchell, Moore & Company. The works were located on James Street North and there were about 50 employees half of which were glass blowers. The production was to consist of small bottles. In 1872, George Rutherford & Company took over the works and retained ownership until 1891, when the works were sold to the Diamond Glass Co., which closed the plant in 1898.
