        "text": "BBC Sport Online talks to Kathryn Leng, who is hoping to become the first woman to play in a first-class match.\n\nThe history of women's cricket dates back to the 18th century when prizes could range from a barrel of ale to pairs of lace gloves.\n\nIndeed, Christine Willes is regarded as the inventor of over-arm bowling after finding her normal delivery impaired by her voluminous skirt.\n\nWithout her, the likes of Fred Trueman, Jeff Thomson, Michael Holding and Brett Lee might still have been rolling them down under-arm.\n\nNowadays girls and boys play together in junior teams - but no woman has so far taken guard against a snarling 80 miles per hour fast bowler in a first-class fixture.\n\nThat might be about to change, thanks to the England and Wales Cricket Board's 1999 decision to establish six University Centres of Cricket Excellence.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries of the scheme is Kathryn Leng, an established member of the England women's cricket team, who is six months into a three-year business management course at Bradford University.\n\nShe, together with Laura Spragg and Rebecca Vernon, is part of the Leeds and Bradford UCCE training squad and is hoping to force her way into the team before the end of her course.\n\n\"Obviously I'm not as strong as the men. But it's all about pushing yourself and trying to raise your limits,\" she told BBC Sport Online.\n\n\"Some people might think I'm dreaming but you've got to set yourself goals and at the moment it does look achieveable.\"\n\nLeng, who became the first woman to play against men in the Bradford League two years ago, has faced the male members of the Bradford/Leeds squad in the nets.\n\nThey include Simon Elstub, who played for Yorkshire's first team last summer.\n\n\"I think they were a bit tentative at first because they didn't know what my limits were, but we've got to know each other better and in the last net session they weren't holding back,\" she said.\n\nAt present, only Cambridge, Oxford and Durham UCCE's have first-class status, but the aim is to bring Bradford/Leeds, Loughborough and Cardiff up to the same standard.\n\nIf it does happen, the 27-year-old could find herself facing up to county attacks before she graduates.\n\n\"It's not inconceivable because she's a good player all round,\" the Daily Telegraph quoted coach Kevin Sharp as saying.\n\nLeng, who once played for Sir Len Hutton's former club, Pudsey St Lawrence, is a former captain of the women's under-19 team and made her senior international debut in 1992.\n\nShe scored her maiden century for England with an innings of 144 against New Zealand in 1996.\n\nHer World Cup debut came in India the following year when she played in four games as England reached the semi-finals.\n\nLeng was again part of the squad for the 2000 tournament in New Zealand, but in a generally disappointing team performance she managed 93 runs in six innings.\n\nEngland have a summer series against Australia coming up and she admitted: \"We've got a lot of work to do in the batting department. Only one of us could say they had a pretty decent World Cup and that was Claire Taylor.\"\n\nHer immediate aim is to be part of the team against the Aussies, but pitting herself in a first-class match against the men is also an ambition.\n\n\"I feel my game has improved tremendously in the last six months. Facing quick bowling keeps you on top of your game.\"\n\nShe could expect no mercy in a match, so does she have any qualms about facing up to the short-pitched stuff?\n\n\"They're going to have to bowl at my wickets to get me out. But bouncers give you a bit of an adrenalin rush,\" she said."
