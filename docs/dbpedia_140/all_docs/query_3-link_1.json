        "text": "John Leng was born in Hull on 10 April 1828,[1] younger brother of William Christopher Leng, who was born there on 25 January 1825.[5] Their father, Adam, had served in the Royal Navy[6] and later was a baker.[7] Their mother was Mary, daughter of Christopher Luccock, architect, surveyor and estate agent of Malton in the East Riding of Yorkshire.[6] The boys were brought up as Wesleyan Methodists but William allied himself with the evangelical wing of the Church of England in later life.[5] John was educated at Hull Grammar School, where he first developed an interest in journalism, as joint editor of a handwritten newspaper circulating around the school.[6] After taking a post in a private school, he began writing letters to the editor of the Hull Advertiser. These obviously did him no harm as the editor took him on as a reporter and sub-editor’s assistant in 1847.[1] William was apprenticed to a chemist in 1839 and worked as a commercial traveller before setting up his own business in 1847.[5] He was a druggist employing one man in 1851.[7] William also had an interest in journalism and contributed articles to the Hull Free Press.[5] He campaigned on issues such as cargo vessel safety (inspiring Samuel Plimsoll’s interest in the subject) and slum clearance.[5]\n\nIn 1851, John was appointed editor of the Dundee Advertiser after James Pattullo and William Neish, the main members of the syndicate that had recently acquired the paper, advertised for a new editor. The following year he became the managing partner in the firm of John Leng & Co., becoming, along with fellow partners, Pattullo and Neish, the new proprietors of the paper.[1][6] The Dundee, Perth & Cupar Advertiser, to give it its full title, had been founded in 1801 and was published on Tuesday and Friday mornings.[8][9] The newspaper’s cramped premises were in the Overgate.[1][9] It was John’s ambition to bring out a daily newspaper and in 1859 he launched the Daily Advertiser for a halfpenny a copy. It was a short-lived experiment. It was clear that the old building and equipment could not cope with the demand a daily would create, so the firm moved to larger premises at 7 Bank Street in 1859, close to the legal chambers of his partners, Pattullo & Neish.[1][3] By 1861, the Dundee Advertiser was a penny daily.[6] John Leng & Co. was one of the first provincial firms to establish an office in Fleet Street with direct telegraphic connection to its Dundee offices.[1]\n\nJohn’s brother, William, who had been a regular contributor to the Dundee Advertiser made the move to Dundee and full-time journalism in the same year as the paper moved its office. This close collaboration was despite the fact that John was a staunch Liberal and William had declared himself a Conservative.[5]\n\nHaving secured the job of editor of the Dundee Advertiser earlier in the year, John married Emily Cook, elder daughter of Alderman Cook of Beverley, in Beverley Minster on 1 October 1851.[1][6] Their early Dundee homes were at 30 Springfield Place, c.1853-1854;[10] 8 Craigie Terrace, c.1856-1859[11] and Airlie Place, c.1861-1865.[12] Most of their children were born in Dundee (Emily Evangelina, 1852;[13] Adeline Amy or Amy Adeline, 1855;[14][15] John Adam St. Quentin, 1857;[16] William Christopher, 1859;[17] Elizabeth Blanche, 1862[18] and Harriot Fox, 1864-1864[19]), but a further daughter was born after they moved across the River Tay to Wellgate House, Newport (Claire Beatrice, 1865[20]). This house was rented from the St. Fort Estate and was the family home until Kinbrae was built in 1871/72 for John Leng to the designs of Perth architect, Andrew Heiton junior.[6][21]\n\nJohn was an enthusiastic supporter of liberal and radical causes and made his mark locally as a campaigning journalist. The idea of endowing some of the teaching posts at the public seminaries and the need for a new infirmary were among some of his early campaigns. He was also heavily involved in the successful campaign for a Dundee Improvement Act in the 1870s. He donated six bells for the restoration of Dundee’s old steeple and fought hard to save Dudhope Castle from demolition.[6] As well as being a talented journalist he was also at the forefront of technological developments. New presses were introduced, water engines replaced manual power and when the old building could not cope with the demand for his now daily paper and the new weekly, People’s Journal, he moved to construct new premises. The People’s Journal was aimed specifically at the working classes. By October 1858 its circulation had risen to over 10,000. By 1866 there were five different editions for different parts of the country.[6] By this time John Leng was the managing proprietor, editor and publisher of his various titles.[22]\n\nWilliam was also a talented journalist and was tempted north to work with his brother. His time in Dundee saw him gain the experience to take on a newspaper of his own and also gain a wife and family. A widowed in-law of John’s wife was returning to her native Scotland from Australia. John sent William to meet her at the harbour and apparently he fell in love with the young widow.[6] He married Ann Stark or Cook on 20 March 1860 and the following year they were living at Craigie Terrace,[23]103 Ferry Road, Dundee with her Australian-born children, Henry and Emily, as well as William’s nephew, Charles A. Whitely.[24] Two further children were born to the couple in Dundee: Christopher David, 1861[25] and Anne Luccock, 1863.[26] In 1864, he bought the Sheffield Daily Telegraph along with Frederick Clifford and became its managing editor.[5] After they settled in Collegiate Crescent in the Ecclesall Bierlow area of Sheffield, they had further children: William St. Quentin, c.1865;[27] Nellie M.M., c.1867; [27] Florence M., c.1868[27] and Mary E.[27] or Elizabeth M.,[28] c.1870.\n\nJohn Leng added further titles to his publishing portfolio with the People’s Friend in 1869 and the Evening Telegraph in 1877. The former encouraged readers to send in articles and stories and proved a great success. The latter was selling over 20,000 copies by the end of the century.[6] The Bank Street offices were extended many times to take account of this expansion of business. The original 60 foot frontage of 1859 was doubled in 1861 and another storey added in 1870. A five-storey extension was added in 1872 with a further 62 feet of frontage extending westward and in 1899 the roof was removed, a storey added and the roof replaced. A tunnel was also constructed to link to a paper store on the south side. In forty years the Bank Street premises had grown from 5,472 square feet to 40,350 square feet. The firm was able to take on printing commissions for outside bodies, including the valuation rolls and electoral registers for the local authorities and large illustrated volumes like Lamb’s Dundee.[6]\n\nIn 1889 John Leng was adopted as Liberal parliamentary candidate for a vacancy in Dundee and was returned unopposed.[6] At the general elections of 1892, 1895 and 1900 he successfully and comfortably held his seat as one of the two Liberal Party representatives of this two member constituency against Conservative and Liberal Unionist opponents.[29] He was a strong advocate of “Home Rule all round” and was an active MP.[30] This had an impact on his journalistic career and from 1892 he is described merely as the managing proprietor and publisher of his various publications, the editing had to be left to others.[31] John was knighted in 1893, six years after his brother William had received the same honour.[1] William’s Sheffield Daily Telegraph was a strong supporter of the Conservative Party and William had been asked to stand for Parliament, but he resisted the call.[32] John was also made a Deputy Lieutenant of the County of City of Dundee in 1893,[1] having been a Justice of the Peace connected with the Dundee District of Forfarshire from the mid-1880s, despite being resident in Fife by this time.[33] He was made an honorary burgess of St. Andrews in 1902 and given an honorary doctorate by that town’s university in 1904.[1] He had been a long-time supporter of Dundee’s Technical Institute and University College Dundee.[30]\n\nJohn’s wife died in 1894, aged 65.[34] He had a striking gothic style memorial chapel built in her honour on a hilltop in Vicarsford Cemetery a couple of miles from their home, 1895-1897.[35] In 1897 he married Mary Low,[36] sister of Sir James Low of Kilmaron, the first Lord Provost of Dundee.[6] Sir John was presented with his full length portrait by William Quiller Orchardson in 1901. This is now in the art collection of the McManus (formerly the Albert Institute).[30]\n\nWilliam died on 20 February 1902 and is buried in Ecclesall Churchyard, Sheffield.[5] John retired from Parliament in 1905. He had already begun to absent himself from the House of Commons in his later years to indulge his love of travel. He published his writing about his travels to the USA and Canada, India and Ceylon, the eastern Mediterranean, Egypt and Sicily.[1] John’s daughter, Clara, married William Thomson, shipowner and member of a family of rival newspaper proprietors. In 1905 The Evening Telegraph and the rival Evening Post were amalgamated, as the Thomson family took a controlling interest in the Leng business.[6]\n\nJohn promised himself one last big journey, but took ill in the USA and died at Delmonte, Monterey, California. His body was cremated and his ashes returned for interment in Vicarsford Cemetery, near Newport.[30] William left an estate valued at £163,897 5s. 6d. His executors were Christopher David Leng and William St. Quentin Leng his sons and Benjamin George Wood.[37] John left £76,624 3s. 1d. His executors were William Christopher Leng and John Adam Leng, his sons, both newspaper proprietors; William Thomson, shipowner, Dundee; William Low of Blebo, Fife and James Percy Sturrock, solicitor, Dundee.[38]\n\nSir John Leng’s involvement with local organisations included:"
