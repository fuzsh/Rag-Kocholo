        "text": "Spheres of influence John Venn was born on August 4th, 1834, in Kingston upon Hull. He studied mathematics at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, later becoming a fellow and lecturer. In 1889, he developed a cricket bowling machine. It was reportedly so accurate that when members of the Australian cricket team visited Cambridge in 1909, Dr Venn's machine clean bowled one of their star batsman four times. In fact, Venn’s invention has just been recreated by Cambridge University's engineering department. Venn, of course, is more famous for his eponymously named Venn diagrams - used to illustrate the relationships between different sets, typically represented by overlapping circles. Because Venn diagrams engage both the left and right brain, they are unique in their ability to straddle the boundary between logical analysis and visual intuition. The left hemisphere of the brain is associated with logical reasoning, analytical thinking and precision. Venn diagrams engage these faculties by representing set theory and logical relationships. The precise nature of the intersections, unions and complements within Venn diagrams requires clear, methodical thinking and analytical skills. The right hemisphere of the brain is, of course, linked to creativity, visual processing and holistic thinking. Venn diagrams appeal to these aspects by visually representing the data. The genius is the simplicity of the overlapping circles and spatial arrangements. It makes it easier to see patterns, relationships and differences between sets. Venn diagrams are a brilliant illustration of how the complex can be made simple. By combining logical structure with visual simplicity, they help users process information in a balanced and intuitive way. As Venn diagrams have left and right brain engagement, they are particularly effective for teaching and learning. They cater for different cognitive styles, bridging the gap between abstract reasoning and concrete understanding. Leonardo da Vinci counselled that to develop a complete mind you must, “…study the science of art; study the art of science. Learn how to see. Realise that everything connects to everything else.” You can see that in a Venn diagram.\n\n\" Gödel's incompleteness theorems are two theorems of mathematical logic that are concerned with the limits of provability in formal axiomatic theories. These results, published by Kurt Gödel in 1931, are important both in mathematical logic and in the philosophy of mathematics. The theorems are widely, but not universally, interpreted as showing that Hilbert's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible. \" _ \" First Incompleteness Theorem: \"Any consistent formal system F within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete; i.e., there are statements of the language of F which can neither be proved nor disproved in F.\" (Raatikainen 2020) \" Second Incompleteness Theorem: \"For any consistent system F within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out, the consistency of F cannot be proved in F itself.\" (Raatikainen 2020) can also be written as \"Assume F is a consistent formalized system which contains elementary arithmetic. Then F⊬Cons(F).\" (Raatikainen 2020) (Then F does not prove consistency of F) _ \" Avi Wigderson (2010) has proposed that the concept of mathematical \"knowability\" should be based on computational complexity rather than logical decidability. He writes that \"when knowability is interpreted by modern standards, namely via computational complexity, the Gödel phenomena are very much with us.\" \" _ https://lnkd.in/ehnUEXNU _ pic: gen by kandinsky 3.0\n\n𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗜 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝘀𝗹𝗼𝘄𝗹𝘆, 𝗜 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻 𝗱𝗲𝗲𝗽𝗹𝘆. I was reading a textbook when I came across Euclid's Division Algorithm which stated a few instructions to compute the H.C.F. of any two positive integers. Numerical examples showing that it works were not as interesting as figuring out how it works for any two positive integers. So, I sat down to abstract it. When I was done, two days had passed. I was not guilty of spending ample time figuring it out, because I could show how it works for any two positive integers. In schools, we emphasize quick grasping whereas in reality, understanding mathematical concepts takes time. When I prioritize speed, I give up on quality. While learning mathematics, you will likely benefit from going slower than you are used to at school. Break your learning into intervals and reflect in between. Here is my abstraction of Euclid's Division Algorithm. I have enabled commenting to discuss and improve it: https://lnkd.in/gdC38x_r I would be happy to hear your thoughts on how to get a deeper understanding of a subject. I'm looking forward to discussing with you in the comments. #mathematics #learning #abstract\n\nThere is beauty in math and in diversity! To drive home this point, I compiled three solutions to the problem of calculating material length on a roll down below. The mathematical beauty can be enjoyed simply by looking at the fact that all approaches can be transformed into a single matching equation. It is a testament to the logical structure of mathematics that these solutions, different in starting point and motivation, yield one single true expression. Now, one could argue that it only takes one of these solutions to answer the question. So, where is the need for diversity? It's in the tools used from idea to refined equation, and in the ideas themselves. Some are easy to imagine but harder to solve, others require a certain intuition to conceive but are easy to transform into a solvable form. And if these paths from idea to solution would not have been purely mathematical, where existence and uniqueness theorems guarantee solutions for such simple endeavors, but engineering challenges that could be difficult, expensive, or sometimes impossible to solve? Then a diverse set of solutions provided by diverse people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives might just simplify or even safe some projects! This is one reason why I think that diversity matters! And why math is beautiful! I mean, look at it ;)\n\nThe Essential Trio of Mathematics: Unveiling the Building Blocks 🔢✨ Just like a master chef relies on the perfect blend of ingredients to create a culinary masterpiece, mathematics is built upon three fundamental components: 🥘 The Objects: Variables, numbers, and vectors are the raw ingredients that mathematicians work with, much like the flour, sugar, and eggs in a recipe. 🔄 The Operations: Trigonometric functions, convolutions, and linear transforms are the techniques used to manipulate and combine the objects, similar to mixing, kneading, and baking in the kitchen. 🌐 The Context: Topological vector spaces, Galois groups, and Hilbert spaces provide the framework and rules for the objects and operations to interact, just as a recipe's instructions guide the cooking process. At higher levels, these three ingredients are intricately woven together, giving rise to dedicated fields like topology, differential geometry, and measure theory. Abstract algebra, in particular, is all about creating systems by defining objects, rules, and structures, then exploring the possibilities within those systems. Linear algebra, a staple across engineering and science majors, serves as a gateway to modeling technical problems by identifying variables, interactions, and properties. Each discipline then builds upon this foundation with its own sophisticated models, such as Maxwell's equations for electrodynamics or Einstein's equations for gravity.\n\nA Course in the Calculus of Variations: Optimization, Regularity, and Modeling From the Editor's web site: This book provides an introduction to the broad topic of the calculus of variations. It addresses the most natural questions on variational problems and the mathematical complexities they present. Beginning with the scientific modeling that motivates the subject, the book then tackles mathematical questions such as the existence and uniqueness of solutions, their characterization in terms of partial differential equations, and their regularity. It includes both classical and recent results on one-dimensional variational problems, as well as the adaptation to the multi-dimensional case. Here, convexity plays an important role in establishing semi-continuity results and connections with techniques from optimization, and convex duality is even used to produce regularity results. This is then followed by the more classical Hölder regularity theory for elliptic PDEs and some geometric variational problems on sets, including the isoperimetric inequality and the Steiner tree problem. The book concludes with a chapter on the limits of sequences of variational problems, expressed in terms of Γ-convergence. While primarily designed for master's-level and advanced courses, this textbook, based on its author's instructional experience, also offers original insights that may be of interest to PhD students and researchers. A foundational understanding of measure theory and functional analysis is required, but all the essential concepts are reiterated throughout the book using special memo-boxes. https://lnkd.in/dtkYaYWW\n\n::On understanding difficult mathematics easily:: IMHO, the only way to understand a difficult mathematical concept, is to go through the book one line at a time, and understand it one line at a time. Yes, a single line at a time. Mathematics is often times difficult because we missed to understand a single step, and that single step is very crucial for rest of our book. Thus, the only way that has worked for me, is to put some calm music on, and walk through the book a single line at a time. Being slow is important. This picture is from my notebook. I specifically write in it at a very slow pace, as I read and understand the concepts. Being slow in the process, has helped me more than anything else. It's better to take one hour to completely understand a single page of a book, than to spend one year being confused about the whole book, due to not having complete conceptual grasp of the subject matter of that single page. No need to worry about how much time it will require to finish understanding the book. It's vastly more important to understand the concepts completely and without any shred of doubt. That's why in my notebook, I write down what I understood, liked, or didn't like about something. Being completely aware of what I didn't understand, allowed me to ask very crucial questions to experts in my field, and understand the concepts clearly. To those interested in CFD, this image was about the mathematics of flux integration errors introduced due to cell skewness, which are disastrous as hecc to simulation accuracy. #studying #education #cfd #mathematics\n\nTell Me The Difference Between Addition, Multiplication and Exponentiation = People are born. They learn to crawl and walk. Then they learn to speak, read and write. Then comes Mathematics and all hell breaks loose. This post tries to analyze why it is so. = Tell me The Difference Between Addition, Multiplication and Exponentiation. Go ahead - I am listening. I can guarantee you that you will struggle with Addition. I know this for a fact. Here is what happened: It took more than 300 pages to prove 1 + 1 = 2 This book is the famed Principia Mathematica. No publisher wanted to publish this book. The authors had to publish the book on self expenses. The Principia Mathematica (often abbreviated PM) is a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics written by mathematician–philosophers Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell and published in 1910, 1912, and 1913. In 1925–1927, it appeared in a second edition with an important Introduction to the Second Edition, an Appendix A that replaced ✱9 and all-new Appendix B and Appendix C. PM was conceived as a sequel to Russell's 1903 The Principles of Mathematics, but as PM states, this became an unworkable suggestion for practical and philosophical reasons: \"The present work was originally intended by us to be comprised in a second volume of Principles of Mathematics... But as we advanced, it became increasingly evident that the subject is a very much larger one than we had supposed; moreover on many fundamental questions which had been left obscure and doubtful in the former work, we have now arrived at what we believe to be satisfactory solutions.\" Here is the evidence of 1 + 1 = 2 proof: \"From this proposition it will follow, when arithmetical addition has been defined, that 1 + 1 = 2.\" – Volume I, 1st edition, p. 379 (p. 362 in 2nd edition; p. 360 in abridged version). (The proof is actually completed in Volume II, 1st edition, page 86, accompanied by the comment, \"The above proposition is occasionally useful.\" They go on to say \"It is used at least three times, in ✱113.66 and ✱120.123.472.\") = Whew! Then you attempt Multiplication as repeated Addition. Wrong! Multiplication is fundamentally different from Addition. It is Multiplication which bestowed the Godelian curse upon us. There is a system known as Presburger Arithmetic which has only Addition and Godel Incompleteness Theorems do not apply to Presburger Arithmetic. = Whoa!! Then finally in utter desperation you say Exponentiation is repeated Multiplication. Wrong again! There is a tower of infinities leading us to the mysterious land of Inaccessible Cardinals. Did you know that with Addition and Multiplication of the first Infinity you will not need any other infinities. Specifically you will not be able to model the Real Numbers which is the next bigger higher infinity. I repeat with the first Infinity and Addition and Multiplication you cannot reach infinity of Real numbers. All hell broke loose.\n\nAs experts in the field of mathematics, we often encounter complex problems that require innovative solutions. Today, let's delve into a master level question in numerical analysis that challenges our understanding of fundamental principles. Question: Consider a scenario where we aim to approximate the solution to a nonlinear equation using iterative methods. Discuss the importance of convergence criteria in ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of such numerical techniques. Answer: Convergence criteria play a pivotal role in guiding iterative methods towards accurate solutions in numerical analysis. These criteria act as guiding principles, steering the iterative process towards a solution that not only converges but does so efficiently and reliably. By establishing thresholds for error tolerance or iteration counts, we can ensure that the computational effort is focused on refining the approximation towards the true solution. In the realm of complex analysis assignment help online, understanding convergence criteria becomes even more crucial. Given the intricate nature of complex functions and their behavior, adherence to robust convergence criteria becomes paramount in navigating the complexities of numerical approximation. Without a clear understanding of convergence principles, the risk of divergence or stagnation in iterative methods looms large, potentially hindering progress towards accurate solutions.
