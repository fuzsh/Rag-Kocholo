        "meta_description": "Master builder, Born Kingston upon Hull, where, after training he set up a building business and began working with Augustus Pugin. He followed Pugin to London and constructed many of his buildings, many churches as well as other work, including a lot of work for the Rothschild family.  On retirement in 1874 he passed the business to his sons but it ceased trading in 1876. According to the Oxford DNB he died at home: Thanet House, Montague Place, Clapham Road. Nos 9-16 Montague Place were the houses on the east side of Clapham Road between Stockwell Park Road and Printers Road, but we cannot locate a 'Thanet House' there.",
