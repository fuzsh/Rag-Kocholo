        "text": "[Ep9] She reaches over to remove the cup and saucer and tells him that she’s taking this. Ha. Fang Leng seeks out Xiao Qi at the copiers and she hands him the meeting minutes and then turns to leave. He stops to ask her if she has anything to say to him. She says yes, and then grabs another stack of papers for him - statistics, something he’d asked her to do. She’s all business right now which confounds him.\n\nLater, when Assistant Han tells Fang Leng that the meeting is at 3 p.m. but there’s no response. So he says his name a couple more times before Fang Leng is startled by this. Then Fang Leng asks him a question. He says that he has a male friend - and Assistant Han laughs at this. He asks if he can have friends with his temper and he continues laughing until he notices Fang Leng’s glare. He stops laughing and asks what about his friend. Fang Leng says his male friend was kissed by a girl. Assistant Han thinks to himself, oh heavens, someone kissed Mr. Fang! Fang Leng continues saying that this friend hoped the girl would give him an explanation, but the girl didn’t explain anything to him and suddenly kept her distance. Assistant Han immediately realizes that Xiao Qi has given him the silent treatment - karma. He actually tells Fang Leng that in this day and age, a kiss is nothing. What is there to explain about a kiss? Then he asks if it wasn’t his first kiss. Fang Leng laughs awkwardly at this and says he’s not sure. Assistant Han’s jaw drops in shock as he thinks to himself, Xiao Qi stole his first kiss! He forgets himself and says that’s awesome, which earns him a glare from Fang Leng. He quickly drops his giddiness and says if the girl who kissed his friend suddenly kept her distance, then she’s playing hard to get. Fang Leng scoffs at this as he says there’s no way her brain would ever come up with such a trick. Assistant Han says the most important thing is - if the friend has feelings for the girl - if yes, then be proactive and approach her if he can.\n\nXiao Qi is at her desk updating Chai Jie that she’s been ignoring Fang Leng all day. Assistant Han sneaks up behind her and she puts down her phone to stare at him. Assistant Han says as Fang Leng’s assistant, he thinks she’s going too far. How could she do this to Fang Leng! However, as a wingman, she’s doing a great job as he’s fallen head over heels for her. lol! He then whispers to ask her if she’s playing hard to get. She’s relieved that he knows and says that she’s just done a poor job of it. He says she’s on point with her expression and emotional state and then he gives her pointers on the flip-and-wave motion (flip her hair and give a dismissive wave of the hand) to show her disdain. She’s then asked to go into Fang Leng’s office, and she practices this move as she's walking.\n\nWhile she’s in Fang Leng’s office, Assistant Han is writing down everything that’s occurred for his novel. lol In his office, Fang Leng brings up the subject of the fried chicken from last night and brings up that there’s a new fried chicken shop he wants to take her to tonight. She gets excited and even smiles over the mention of fried chicken. But then she does the flick-and-wave move and then says \"fried chicken again\" dismissively. Poor Fang Leng is confused about her sudden change of heart as she’d listed off the fine points of fried chicken love the night before. She says she has a long list of favorites and proceeds to list off steamed lamb, steamed bear’s paw and steamed deer antler, braised duck, goose and chicken, baked duck, goose, and chicken - and he asks what’s wrong with her. Can’t a fried chicken drumstick satisfy her? She says it’s just a drumstick after all. This makes him scoff and then he asks, can’t she take responsibility for once? He then says she has to stay loyal. If she didn’t like chicken drumstick in the first place, then she shouldn’t have messed with it or make requests midway. He’s the drumstick. lol! She’s confused. He continues passionately, she can’t keep her distance from the chicken drumstick without saying a word as he angrily points at his desk. She asks why does the chicken drumstick care? He yells back, “Of course I care!” She looks at him and he says, he meant the chicken drumstick. She says fine, then she won’t have chicken drumsticks from now one - she’ll have duck leg instead. This makes him huff in frustration before he stands up from his desk and walks over to close the blinds in his office.\n\nFang Leng then walks to stand next to her chair, and leans over her. She tries to lean away from him but he only gets closer and closer. He asks what she is doing. She thinks to herself, why does playing hard to get annoy him so much? Haha. She's missing the point! She starts pushing on his chest to push him away. She says she doesn’t know what he’s saying and she has so much work to do. But she’s been dragged in by him to talk about chicken drumsticks and what not. XD She gets up from the chair and walks to the door but then she stops and turns around.\n\nShe gestures at the chair, for him to sit down. So he sits down and asks if she knows what she did wrong. She does the flip-and-wave move along with the best eye roll ever! LOL! And then she scoffs at him before walking out confidently with her head held high. Fang Leng follows her out, to ask Assistant Han how an office girl has so much work assigned to her from him. His assistant says he’s not in charge of her assignments, as Fang Leng is the one who assigned her the task of liaising with The One design company. Fang Leng doesn’t say anything so Assistant Han reminds him that he has a meeting in ten minutes.\n\nXiao Qi goes to meet with Mr. Wang at The One but is told that he’s out and to come back another day. She says that they’re supposed to meet at 3 p.m. The receptionist tells her that it’s normal for someone to be out of the office - and then the woman stands up and greets Mr. Jiang. Xiao Qi turns around and recognizes the mysterious stranger from the party. He asks if she’s here to liaise. She says she is but Mr. Wang is out so she’ll go back to her office and they can talk another time. He asks her what the project is and she can speak to him directly. She looks at him with curiosity.\n\nAt his meeting, Fang Leng is once again proposing the creation of an R&D Department to the board members. Uncle Zhou is the first voice of dissent as he brings up the fact that R&D will create more costs for their products and he doesn't think R&D can guarantee the acceptance of new product concepts. He suggests that he drop this idea as they already have a customer base. Fang Leng refutes this by saying that they need to expand the customer base so they shouldn’t sit on existing merits and remain complacent. To Uncle Zhou’s surprise, Mr. Zhou agrees with Fang Leng’s points as he says that young people can bring innovation and energy to the company. If Fang Leng is confident in bringing more value to the company through the R&D department, then he thinks it should be approved. Everyone else is on board now, except for Uncle Zhou.\n\nAfter the meeting, Fang Leng wonders if Xiao Qi has gone home already. Assistant Han says she’s out to liaise with The One design company. As they’re quite hard to please, she’ll likely have to visit them frequently. Fang Leng tries to look unconcerned but Assistant Han points out that this is called “shooting yourself in the foot.” Fang Leng glares at him so he flees. Hehe.\n\nBack at The One, Jiang Shi Yi (“Shi Yi”) offers to treat Xiao Qi to a meal. She says no but then he says he’ll take her for fried chicken and now she readily agrees to go with great enthusiasm. So while she’s stuffing her face with fried chicken, he just watches her eat. When he asks her if she’s in a relationship with Fang Leng, this makes her choke and deny it. Outside, passing by in his ride, Fang Leng happens to spot the two of them at the chicken shop. When Shi Yi is about wipe some chicken grease off of her face, she receives a call from Fang Leng. She quickly answers and then gets her stuff (including the bag of extra three orders of chicken) and runs out to meet him.\n\nFang Leng greets her with, “Didn’t you say you didn’t like fried chicken?” XD This fried chicken debacle! She claims that she’s an air sign, so her thoughts are inconsistent. Fang Leng looks around and sees a couple sitting outside and he takes the bag of chicken from her and gifts it to them. She starts sputtering at this and he just kneels down and lifts her over his shoulders in a fireman's carry and starts walking. He says, “Chai Xiao Qi, listen up.” Even as she’s protesting and saying that the chicken is hers. He continues saying “Starting today, you can only eat the fried chicken I bought for you. Don’t eat other people’s fried chicken!” She demands to be put down as he tells her to get in the car. She asks if he’s lost his mind, and he finally sets her down by the car. She tries to walk away but he only opens the door and shoves her inside and then gets in next to her.\n\nAt the cafe, Chai Jie asks Xiao Qi how the playing-hard-to-get trick worked for her. Xiao Qi says not only did she fail to captivate him but also angered him. Ha! Chai Jie’s dreams of getting rich by way of Fang Leng and Xiao Qi dating isn’t happening anytime soon. Xiao Bu says that getting rich overnight isn’t about the boss but their mother who wants to pay the woman to leave their son. And just like that, Fang Lie’s mother walks in asking for Chai Xiao Qi. Xiao Bu’s scan only registers her as Fang Leng’s stepmother and it comes with a danger warning. Both Xiao Bu and Chai Ji quickly point to Xiao Qi. lol, the traitors. She then demands to meet with her and books the entire place for today. Xiao Bu and Chai Jie leave wait outside. When Assistant Han sees that they're suddenly closed, he bemoans the fact that he was here to get coffee. He then sees Fang Lie’s mother meeting with Xiao Qi, who is examining a bank card. Xiao Qi thinks she’s here to ask her to leave Fang Leng, so she doesn’t let her finish talking and slides the card back to her and says she’s not leaving him as love is priceless. Fang Lie’s mother says she’s misunderstood. She’s paying her to stay. She wants them to work together, and wants her to report Fang Leng’s every move. So Xiao Qi asks for double the amount she offered - $10M and Fang Lie’s mother agrees. As of today, there’s 100,000 RMB on the card.\n\nAssistant Han brings Fang Leng his coffee and Fang Leng wonders why he’s bringing him the coffee. Assistant Han then says that Xiao Qi is on leave and tries to leave. Fang Leng stops him and says he’s hiding something from him. Assistant Han tells him about Fang Lie’s mother and Xiao Qi meeting and that Fang Lie’s mother gave her a card. Fang Leng goes to see Dr. Zhang about this recent development. When asked how he feels, Fang Leng says he doesn’t think Xiao Qi is that type of person, even though she’s accepted Fang Lie’s mother’s money.\n\nThe girls go shopping with Xiao Qi's newfound riches and it’s mostly Chai Jie and Xiao Bu spending the money. Xiao Qi tries on a dress but when she sees the bill, she decides to not get the dress for herself. When she spots a store that sells headbands and she buys a yellow duckie headband for herself and a matching one for Fang Leng. Afterwards, at their apartment building, when he sees them and their many shopping bags, he refuses to accept it and pushes her away. He goes into his place and closes the door on her. Xiao Qi thinks that he's upset that she bought all of this stuff and only got him this measly headband. Fang Leng sends a message to Dr. Zhang saying that she’s working for Fang Lie’s mother. Xiao Qi sends an invitation to hot pot dinner at the milk shop tomorrow evening, including Fang Leng in the group chat. Fang Leng tells Dr. Zhang that here’s a chance for him to finally meet Xiao Qi. Dr. Zhang says he’s off tomorrow but he needs to work - is there a pretty girl?\n\nWhile they’re setting up for the hot pot dinner, Shi Yi shows up to say hi. Xiao Qi and Shi Yi exchange WeChat information before he leaves. Xiao Qi is having this get together because she thinks she offended Fang Leng. Fang Leng shows up with Dr. Zhang and Chai Jie thinks Dr. Zhang is someone named Mulong Yunhai. She says he’s finally returned and then she suddenly hugs him. Dr. Zhang is confused as to why this woman is hugging him. Chai Jie continues on about how he disappeared five years ago without a word. Dr. Zhang tells her that she’s got the wrong person as this is their first time meeting and he looks over at Fang Leng for help. Fang Leng says this is Dr. Zhang, a psychiatrist and he’s just returned from England after studying abroad for five years. So he’s not the person she’s referring to. She insists that he looks the same as Mulong Yunhai, except that he’s bald. So she yanks on his hair and finds out that it’s his real hair. She asks to see his right palm to confirm if he has a mole. He doesn’t have one. She screams that she's so embarrassed and then runs off.\n\nAt the dinner table, Fang Leng gets up as he thinks she’s continuing to show off her newfound riches, with lobster, abalone and steak for hot pot. He says he's going to grab some wine, and Xiao Qi follows him to ask if he’s still angry. He doesn’t say anything except to grab the wine, but Xiao Qi sticks the duckie headband that matches hers onto his head and says about the gift, it’s the thought that counts. She laughs at how cute it looks on him. Then she hands him the card from Fang Lie’s mother, and says this is the card from his stepmother and there was 100,000 RMB on it. She’s bought some clothes and electronics for Xiao Bu and Chai Jie as well as the food and drinks for tonight. So there’s probably only 50,000 RMB left for him and the R&D Department. He says nothing, so she just tucks it into his pocket. He asks her why Fang Lie's mother gave the money to her. She says that she wanted her to be her spy. He asks if she’s telling him everything now. She says yes, as she definitely can’t trust her. When Chia Jie calls to ask Xiao Qi if she’s found the wine, she quickly leaves with the wine. (~35:00)\n\nFang Leng slowly follows her back to the table and sees himself reflected in the mirror. He looks at the headband on his head and then smiles at himself. He’s interrupted by Chai Jie, so he quickly yanks off the headband. Chai Jie appears to be ripping off a wine label. She tells him that Xiao Qi bought them many gifts but didn’t even buy a dress that she really liked. There aren’t many innocent girls like her, so please cherish her. Fang Leng nods and thanks her before he leaves. She goes back to ripping off the label.\n\nBack at the table, pours the wine from the decanter and says it’s a 1982 LaFite bottle that she’s saved for special occasions. Xiao Bu scans the wine and sees that it’s 14% ABV and takes a sip and thinks that alcohol has no effect on robots. So she continues drinking more wine. Xiao Qi and Fang Lie are fighting over meatballs as she complains that he’s eaten the majority of them. Fang Leng breaks it up and tells his brother that he’s eaten a lot of food, and then gives Xiao Qi a large piece of lobster. lol\n\nElsewhere, the Zhou siblings are discussing the recent developments. Or rather, in the case of Fang Lie’s mother - utter lack of development as she's annoyed that she’s pretty much paid 100,000 RMB to find out that Fang Leng doesn’t like seafood and loves dipping sauces. Hahaha.\n\nFang Leng and Xiao Qi are now discussing the “intel” she’s provided to Fang Lie’s mother.lol Chai Jie calls for her help so she leaves and Dr. Zhang sits down in her place. Fang Leng asks what his observations are. Dr. Zhang says she doesn’t seem human as they’re complex beings. She’s so naive and one can’t tell if she has any desire or selfishness at all. She simply loves him. Fang Leng says she still accepted the money from Fang Lie’s mother. Dr. Zhang says yes, she accepts the money and then puts a headband on him. Don’t worry as Chai Jie told him that Xiao Qi has liked him for a very long time. Dr. Zhang says if it wasn’t for his icy poker face, it wouldn’t have progressed this slowly. When it comes to love, the worst fear is not indecision, but one not knowing how he or she feels. His friends and wingman can help him solve his decision but whether he likes her or not, only he can know. Dr. Zhang then takes off and Fang Leng looks at the headband in his hands.\n\nXiao Bu starts short circuiting while she’s helping with cleanup. Her computer system says her body is failing to process the alcohol so she’s entering drunk mode. Xiao Qi sends her away and says to walk straight. So she starts walking and Fang Lie stumbles drunkenly after her. Fang Leng tells Xiao Qi that to thank her for her help with Fang Lie’s mother, he’ll take her to the mall. She gets excited but then asks if they aren’t closed at this time. He takes her to a dark and empty mall. When he claps, all of the lights come on. Xiao Qi looks rather impressed.\n\nThis recap mentions chicken 25 times with 8 of them referring to the drumstick. lol!\n\n[Ep10] Fang Leng explains that the mall is run by Future Group. Of course it is. lol So she can come anytime she wants to. She asks if that includes nights. He then walks to the store where there is a sales clerk waiting. He asks for her to bag the dress that’s on the mannequin. It’s the same dress she tried on and didn’t buy. Xiao Qi asks how he knows this. He only says to pick whatever she wants, as he’s richer than she thinks. She then laughs and says to bag everything in the store. Xiao Qi becomes more interested in playing with the blocks at the kids’ table than shopping.\n\nMeanwhile, Xiao Bu and Fang Lie are drunkenly stumbling around. He points at the night sky and says this is his painting and he’ll draw a star for her. She says she can’t see it and so she puts her hand over his and uses her power, to start drawing in the air - it’s his name 方烈 and then she sends it flying into the sky. The characters get larger and brighter and then they disappear. Fang Lie is quite impressed by this. She says she’s even better than this. She then puts her hands together and then pulls it apart to make a glowing sphere float right in front of them. When it gets larger, he then swats at it and it turns into a starry night. He exclaims that she’s amazing. He then says that he knew she wasn’t an ordinary person. Her system shows her a prompt: Identity compromised - Taking him down by force? Yes or no? She selects no. He continues saying that she’s able to do things that most people can’t - as if she has a superpower. Then he says everyone is unique and no one can be replaced. She then says she was afraid he found out she was a robot. He says a robot is just a pile of codes, and she’s different as she’s unique. Then he looks like he wants to kiss her and he even leans in but then she stops him with a finger on his lips. He says no, as he’s looking at her neck, which looks like it’s on fire. They’re interrupted by his mother calling his name. Uh oh. She asks why he is here, and in his drunken stupor he tells Xiao Bu that this woman looks like his mother. Xiao Bu scans her and sees her name and says yes, this woman has the same name as his mother. The two drunken idiots laugh about this. Fang Lie walks up to his mother’s face and realizes - that it’s really his mother. He yells surprise and then tries to hug his mother, who stops him from hugging her. She then pulls on his arm and says he’s coming home with her. Xiao Bu says he’s an adult and she has no right to deprive him of his personal liberty. His mother sputters at this and then recognizes her from the video call. She asks who she is and Xiao Bu says she’s his girlfriend. The two then proceed to pull on him. His mother stops and pulls out a blank check. She tells her to fill it out and then stay away from her son. Fang Lie starts puking into the water. Xiao Bu says she’s not greedy but could it be a bit more than what she gave Xiao Qi. lol The two then start pulling on Fang Lie, and his mother wins.\n\nFang Leng is now carrying several bags of snacks, as this is what Xiao Qi wanted. He says she could’ve bought anything but she got snacks. She’s even eating something now. *raises hand* Same! lol She offers some to him and tries to put a piece in his mouth but then she receives a call from Xiao Bu who tells her that Fang Lie’s been taken away by his mother. Fang Leng tells her to go home and then leaves. She tries to go with him but he insists that she go home and he’ll take care of this. Fang Leng returns to the family home and his stepmother asks if he’s the one who lured Fang Lie back here. He says that he’s an adult so he doesn’t need anyone to decide for him. She complains to her husband about this. Fang Leng’s father sides with his wife and questions his position in the company. Fang Leng asks him if he even remembers why he set up the makeup department, and what tomorrow is. Fang Lie’s mother tells him that Fang Lie will be under her watchful eye so don’t even think about getting close to him. *rolling eyes* What is wrong with her?\n\nXiao Qi knocks on Fang Leng’s apartment door but there’s no answer. So she calls Assistant Han to ask him where he is and if he’s contacted him today. He says there’s no way he would contact him today as it’s his mother’s death anniversary. And he won’t allow anyone to contact him today. Xiao Qi asks if he knows where he’d go then.\n\nFang Leng is at the amusement, sitting alone on a bench with a bouquet of flowers. Xiao Qi spots him from a distance, knowing that he’s quite down. She wonders what she can say to him. She starts practicing what she should say on an Iron Man statue and loses sight of Fang Leng. He shows up behind her and asks why she’s here. She stammers out that he can cry. He asks if she’s looking for him. She says yes, she was and then runs towards him. He says let’s go and he’ll take her home. She tells him to wait, as he’s already here at the amusement park, they should have fun. An announcement is made that the park is closed, and they should leave at once. She insists that he wait and then walks in a circle around him and tells him to not leave. She runs into the park manager’s office and persuades him to keep the place open.\n\nXiao Qi and Fang Leng up doing bumper cards. And then they end up on a ride that requires pedaling to move it forward. She encourages him to yell to let go of his bad feelings. He refuses at first but then he does it. Then she tells him to pedal along as taking the deep breaths will open his heart and mind. He starts pedaling and then she puts her head right against his heart to see if his heart is racing but this makes them realize how close they are. She quickly says she didn’t mean it, and then goes back to pedaling and making the turn. Fang Leng almost has a smile. Finally, they’re on the carousel, and she asks if he’s still unhappy. He admits that he often dreams of the last time his mother took him on this ride. She sits in front of him in the ride and he’s seated behind her but it seems like he can never catch up to her. Ever since his mother passed away, he’s been coming to the amusement park once a year. But he doesn’t dare ride the carousel because to him, the carousel means permanent distance. Xiao Qi recalls a previous conversation with Xiao Bu, who was reading a book, that on Earth, children come to the world through their mothers. To them, mothers are bridges that connect them to the world. If one day, that bridge disappears, the child will think the whole world has nothing to do with him or her anymore. However, they’re forced to face the world alone. She had pointed out that Fang Leng has a bad relationship with his father, so that’s why he misses his mother very much.\n\nIn the present, Xiao Qi transports from her current spot to one right next to Fang Leng. He’s startled and asks when she got here. She tells him that he should be happy even when he’s alone on the carousel. She says not to focus on just the view in front of him but also on the view around him. His mother would’ve wanted him to see those views. Also, he doesn’t always have to feel alone as he has her now. He starts smiling and then Xiao Qi rides without holding onto the pole. Fang Leng reaches over to hold onto her hand as they continue riding the carousel together.\n\nThen the two start drinking, and in their drunkenness, they see dolphins popping up into the night sky. Their drinks expired some time ago… so they’re hallucinating that they’re on a ship together. The two have a Titanic movie moment as they’re both wearing British clothing from the 1900’s and Xiao Qi even has on a Rose wig. (~21:50. Yup. I’m not recapping this.... lol I’m cringing so hard.) When they’re hit in the face with water, they’ve changed to (kind of) reenacting a scene from the Wall-E. More cringe.\n\nOnce their umbrella gets struck by lightning, their outfits change into wuxia dresses, and that “Spring Rain” song comes on… (~23:50) Fang Leng is waiting with an umbrella in one hand, on a pedestrian bridge. (Bwahaha, the guy’s part of this song is so dramatic while the woman’s part is so pretty.) Xiao Qi arrives and the two hold the umbrella together. She’s sooo pretty here.\n\nFL: Ever since my mother left me, I was ready to live alone forever. Ever since I met you, I realized that self-imposed isolation was a cowardly act. Thank you, Xiao Qi.\n\nThen he offers her his other hand and she places hers in his. She then lets go of her hand around the umbrella and shoves it out of his hand. He then puts his free hand around her waist and pulls her close to him. (Thassapak Hsu does not have the right hands (not tapered fingers) for this genre.) His heart starts racing and her ring starts glowing. As they’re about to kiss – they’re interrupted by water again. In reality, they’re sitting on a bench in front of a very large pink heart, and some kid is spraying them with a water gun. lol! The father comes by to admonish his son and apologizes for bothering them. They've been hallucinating! Fang Leng's head drops onto her shoulder as he starts sleeping. Xiao Qi realizes that she wanted to kiss him just now, which she chalks up to hormones. She pokes at him but he doesn't react as he’s dead asleep.\n\nThe next day, Fang Leng wakes up in Xiao Qi’s room which is a sea of pastel pinks and white, and he’s hugging a teddy bear. He reaches over to have a sip from his glass and realizes it’s a pink insulated flask. He’s confused. But he quickly gets up to grab his stuff and then notices Xiao Qi’s pictures of the two of them and sticky notes about doing things with him. (Okay, Show, so who took all these photos? lol) He pauses on the one that says “Make Fang Leng love me” and then accidentally knocks it in her hamper. Just as Xiao Qi comes in, he’s struggling to keep whatever article of clothing off of his face. (I don’t even know how that even happened. Haha.) She sees what he has in his hand and snatches the picture and note from him. She tells him that breakfast is ready, so he leaves. When she turns over the picture, it shows the back of the note which reads “Then I can collect hormones.” She’s relieved he didn’t see that. Fang Leng thinks it’s like a diary and she’s really liked him for a long time. To his surprise, he’s greeted by Assistant Han.\n\nFang Leng asks how he’s here. He replies that Xiao Qi said he wasn’t feeling well so she asked him to pick him up. The five of them sit down to breakfast, which Chai Jie claims Xiao Qi made for him. Xiao Qi tries to correct her but Chai Jie stops her. Fang Leng then compliments her and then mentions her flaws. Xiao Qi is fine with this. She then asks what’s going on with Fang Lie. He says his mother has locked him up and confiscated his cellphone. He says it’s likely she’ll send him out of the country or make other arrangements but he won’t be able to make his own decisions anymore. Xiao Bu asks, then what about his painting dream. Fang Leng assures her that he won’t abandon him and finally leaves for work.\n\nAfter he leaves with Assistant Han, Chai Jie says that Fang Leng is already captivated by her. She now needs to start the next stage, being proactive and wilder – and she could even give him a kiss by force sometimes. Xiao Qi feels a bit shy about this. Chai Jie says a romance is supposed to be a transition from the mind to the body. Without dominance in action, all the preparation is useless. Like a hostile takeover? lol\n\nIn the flavoring room, Fang Leng’s team is having issues trying to create the Love Perfume but it’s low in quality and isn’t innovative. Fang Leng suggests that they not settle for less and continue working on this. Uncle Zhou is gleeful about their current issue and makes sure that Assistant Han knows this. *rolling eyes* Go away.\n\nBack at home, Fang Lie is on a hunger strike so he refuses to eat, unless his mother releases him. He then claims to be sleeping naked. So she yanks off the covers and finds several bags of snacks in bed with him. lol She says it’s no wonder he had a double chin during his two-day hunger strike. She then collects the snacks and says since he refuses to go back to the U.S., then he can just stay in this house! He asks for his phone and computer. Nope. His mother just leaves with the snacks. He then pulls out his sketchbook which has a sketch of Xiao Bu. Suddenly there’s a knock on his window - it’s his muse, Xiao Bu! He actually tears up at the sight of her and quickly lets her inside. She’s brought him a backpack full of snacks. She then starts to grab his pillows and he asks what she’s doing. She says she’s taking him away with her. He says no, it’s enough that she comes and keeps him company. So she promises to come here every day to keep him company.\n\nBack at the office, Xiao Qi is trying to figure out her next move but she doesn’t think she, herself, is tempting enough. She goes to the flavoring room to find something to tempt Fang Leng. She manages to trip and causes a loud commotion when she knocks over several bottles. Her hand ends up in the puddle of fragrances, and her ring ends up releasing the collected hormones into the perfumes.It’s all in the air now. Fang Leng comes in to investigate and becomes quite intoxicated by the scent. She starts apologizing and says that she didn’t mean to do this. He approaches her and she ends up backed up against the wall as she’s worried that he’s angry. He takes a sniff and then he drops down to where the puddle is and tells her to apply some on the pulse as he puts some on the inside of his wrist. He continues saying that as the blood flows, it allows the perfume to evaporate more quickly. He takes a long inhale and then raises his wrist to her face to allow her to sniff it. She does and says it smells quite good. But then Fang Leng gently cups her face with one hand, and the two are quite close now. He seems to be looking rather intently at her lips.\n\n[Ep12] Xiao Qi looks up at him and asks what brings him here. He smiles (more like a smirk) at her and then sits down next to her. He says that he’ll shield her with the umbrella. She thanks him, and then he asks her if she had a fight with Fang Leng. She says it’s not like that, and it’s just a small misunderstanding. He then reaches his hand into his pocket and then presents it to her - a piece of candy wrapped in pink foil. He tells her to try it. She accepts and eats it. He asks if it’s helped lift her mood. She agrees by saying sure enough, sweets can lift one’s mood. He tells her where he’s from, in his youth, sweets are foreign treats. Whenever he’s feeling down, he’ll have one and his mood is better then. Xiao Qi says she used to be able to have great moods. But ever since she’s met Fang Leng, she’s been worrying a lot. It seems like she needs to prepare more of these sweets. She asks where he got this from. He laughs and says how could he tell her - then he wouldn’t have a business. He then offers to send her home.\n\nWhen he drops her off outside her place, he tells her to let him know if she wants these sweets. And if she’s feeling down, to also let him know as he wants to be her friend. When he smiles at her, she’s suddenly struck by how familiar his smile is to her. She says it’s like they’ve met before. His smile falters for a second before he says, then they should be friends even more. She agrees, and he has her lock pinkies with him before letting her go.\n\nUncle Zhou is trying to sow the seeds of discord for Fang Leng, with another board member, Ms. Chen. He sees her out, and when the elevator door opens, it’s a very drenched Fang Leng inside. Ms. Chen is concerned about him, but then Fang Leng greets her as Ms. Li. Uncle Zhou notices this and points it out to Ms. Chen, who says Fang Leng sure is a forgetful person of high rank. After she gets into the elevator, Assistant Han comes running up and fretting about the sudden rain and removes his own jacket for him. Fang Leng covers his mouth as Uncle Zhou is still nearby and can overhear everything.\n\nThe two are now back in his secret server room. When Assistant Han brings up Xiao Qi as his destined partner - Fang Leng tells him to fire her. Assistant Han is relieved that he still remembers her - and asks if he’s laying her off as he wants to make her his wife. Fang Leng just glares at him. Nope. So Xiao Qi gets fired from Future Group, and Xiao Bu tells her that it’ll be fine as she’s done many things that were out of line but he’s always forgiven her. Xiao Qi says that she has a feeling that he’s more angry than ever this time as he’s quite different this time. I understand his anger.\n\nBack at work, Fang Leng asks Assistant Han to book a hotel room for him tonight. Assistant Han is surprised that he’s not returning home, and suggests that maybe Xiao Qi wants to explain herself. Fang Leng taps his fist on the desk and Assistant Han quickly starts looking for a hotel room. He tells him if he dares to tell her where he’s staying at, he doesn’t need to come in for work tomorrow either. Assistant Han assures him that he won’t.\n\nLater, Xiao Qi receives a photo of Fang Leng outside a hotel from an unknown number. Xiao Qi asks Xiao Bu if he really doesn't want to have anything to do with her. Xiao Qi sadly says that she shouldn’t have lied from the beginning. She didn’t mean to lie to him. Chai Jie says an apology will do. As long as the apology is done with a sincere heart and some affection, she’ll definitely be forgiven. Xiao Qi tries to come clean about lying to her – and Chai Jie says that she’s known from the beginning that neither one of them are Li Chun Jiao’s daughter. The landlady had already contacted her and told her that her daughter had migrated overseas. The girls are shocked, and Xiao Qi asks why she isn’t angry. Chai Jie says that she has lived with them long enough to know that they’re good people, and must’ve had no choice but to lie. If she hadn’t taken them in, then what would’ve happened to them. The girls hug her and offer to help her in whatever way they can. Two alien girls and their surrogate mother.\n\nIn his hotel room, Fang Leng has a video meeting, which is interrupted by the doorbell for room service. He lets them in and doesn’t see that it’s actually Xiao Qi. She rolls in the cart and unloads the cake that says “I’m sorry” on it. She also sets up balloons with the letters for “Sorry” on the couch. One of the people in the meeting can see someone setting up something in the background, so he urges Fang Leng multiple times to attend to his personal matters first but Fang Leng reminds him that no matter what happens, their meeting can be interrupted. When Xiao Qi gets her microphone working, she starts singing an apology song… and Fang Leng finally slams shut his laptop. He asks what she’s doing here. She says he’ll feel better when he eats this cake. He pulls out his phone to call Assistant Han to instruct him to get security. She tries to stop him and asks him who asked him to not go home tonight. She continues that he didn’t even give her a chance to apologize. She asks for him to give her 10 minutes. He says no. She asks for 5 minutes and he says that he needs to work. She says 3 minutes and he says he has a meeting. She says 1 minute and he finally agrees. She tells him to ask her whatever he wants and she promises to not lie.\n\nHe asks her why she pretended to be his neighbor. She thinks to herself that she definitely can’t tell him that it’s to collect hormones, so she says she can’t tell him. Then why must she pretend to be his ex-girlfriend? She thinks to herself, she was afraid her alien identity would be exposed so she had no choice. She tells him, she can’t tell him that either. Why did she approach him in the beginning? She thinks to herself, because she wants to collect his hormones. She tells him again, that she can’t tell him that either. She is failing so hard at this. He says that she came here to apologize to him but she won’t even give him a single explanation. He’s never met anyone as shameless as her. He tells her not to appear before him again, and if she does, he’ll call the cops.\n\nShe argues that she helped make perfumes for his company, so she is of value to the company. She recalls in the employment contract agreement, unless a serious mistake has been made, the company can’t just fire their employees. Also, those that are derelict at work - and she doesn’t fit into either category. I wish she would just tell him the truth? He wonders who wrote this contract but he agrees to allow her to continue working at the company. He’ll see if she can take it or not. He then walks up the stairs and tells her to leave.\n\nThe next day, Xiao Qi is assigned to deal with The One, and everyone else in the meeting is concerned as they’re difficult to deal with. After many rounds of discussions, they still reject any offers. One of the executive says they should stop trying to collaborate with them, plus Xiao Qi has no experience with contract negotiation. Fang Leng decides that all of the projects with The One will be Xiao Qi’s responsibility. Xiao Qi has been too busy looking at Fang Leng to pay proper attention to what was actually said. As Fang Leng leaves, Assistant Han just wishes her all the best. She goes to Fang Leng’s office and says she was an errand person before but now he’s asking her to negotiate a contract with them. She’s worried about messing up. He says if she can’t do it, then resign. He tells her to go see Assistant Han about the paperwork and he wants results by tomorrow.\n\nZhou siblings are busy plotting against Fang Leng, and they’re going to look into what made Assistant Han so concerned about something bad happening that day with Ms. Chen. While the “diabolical” siblings are having tea outside, Xiao Bu sneaks into Fang Lie’s room with snacks. But he’s finding these snacks to lose their luster as he misses his freedom more. Xiao Bu says she has some ideas for him.\n\n1) Give up his painter’s dream and listen to his mother. Then inherit hundreds of millions worth of property.\n\nHe shakes his head at this as he won’t give it up as it’s his passion. If a person doesn’t possess any passions, even an anchovy won’t look up to you. She scratches off that idea.\n\n2) Completely cut off from his family. Become a pauper chasing his dreams.\n\nFang Lie says in theory, it’s possible. But if the Fang family loses a precious child like him, his mother and father would both be heartbroken. For their sake, he can’t do this. She understands his logic and scratches off this idea.\n\n3) This one relies on his acting skills the most. Outward devotion but inner opposition. His mother wants him to work with Future Group, so that’s why she’s sent him abroad to study finance. So it doesn’t matter where he studies. So he needs to find a place to study locally so he can continue to use it as an excuse to continue painting.\n\nHe points out that he gets sleepy when reading a finance book. So he won’t be able to pass the exam, so there’s no acceptance letter to fool his mother with. Xiao Bu says she’ll take care of that. He thanks her and then pats her on the head. This sends her system into maximum heat overload as she's about turn into a tortoise soon! His mother tries to enter the room but it’s locked. Xiao Bu tries to hide all the snacks and herself. Mom has the key and barges in. She knows that he has snacks and eventually she yanks off the covers to find snacks and a tortoise. He claims it’s his only companion now as he’s stuck in this house. He lets her take away all the snacks and sees her out. When he returns, he can’t find the tortoise anymore. Xiao Bu has gone outside as she continues bemoaning about returning to this form yet again.\n\nBack at Future Group, Fang Leng finds Xiao Qi falling asleep at her desk. He quickly catches her head before she falls right out of her seat. She suddenly jerks awake and asks what time is it. He tells her it’s half past midnight and to go home. She says she can’t as the cooperation plan with The One has not been finalized yet. Otherwise she’ll get fired. She returns to typing on her computer and so he leaves.\n\nXiao Qi gives her presentation but Mr. Wang (the one who’s been dodging them) isn’t impressed or particularly interested as there’s nothing special about this cooperation. Shi Yi then asks Xiao Qi to speak further (beyond her slideshow and rehearsed script) on the matter. She gives them her personal opinion. Future Group has studied their style of work before choosing them. They share the same preferences. So in other words, they exclusively want The One, and Future Group is also the one they need. Mr. Wang tells Shi Yi that he was correct, that Xiao Qi is quite capable. He finally agrees to sign the contract. Afterwards, Shi Yi says since they’re friends, she doesn’t need to call him Mr. Jiang, but to call him Shi Yi instead. She agrees and gets up to leave. But then she seems to feel weak and actually falls over the couch. He helps her up and asks if she’s okay and she says that it’s probably due to lack of rest. Before she leaves, he hands her a candy.\n\nXiao Qi returns to the office and gives the signed contract to Fang Leng. Xiao Qi says that she’s going home to get some rest. Fang Leng tries to stop her but she says he has no reason to fire her now. She leaves. Assistant Han asks if there’s an issue with the contract. Fang Leng says that they did not revise any clauses in the contract. At the same time, during the contract period, they will not be collaborating with other competitors. Assistant Han says that shows that Xiao Qi has a way with words, and she’s been working hard for the past few days. She worked overtime until 3 a.m. yesterday. He thinks to himself that it’s great that the enthusiastic and resilient female lead had touched the male lead’s cold heart. So they’ll reconcile sooner than later.\n\nAn exuberant Xiao Qi returns home. Xiao Bu is busy analyzing her system trying to figure out what’s causing her transformation. Xiao Qi asks that he won't be mad at her anymore, right? Xiao Bu says what other reasons could he have now. She then says if it doesn’t work, then she should send him a small gift.\n\nThe next day, Fang Leng overhears some employees talking about Leng-Qi CP separating soon. An employee from The One has captured a photo of Xiao Qi looking pretty chummy with The One’s boss (Shi Yi). Fang Leng looks at the photo - it’s Shi Yi helping Xiao Qi up from the couch with an arm around her. (How did someone take a picture from that angle - the person would’ve needed to be inside Shi Yi’s office.) Fang Leng clenches his jaw at this.\n\nAnd now he’s showing this picture to Dr. Zhang, who says it’s just a photo of their backs. Fang Leng is still suspicious. And jealous. Dr. Zhang suggests that he limit his interactions with her, but since she’s the one who got the contract with The One, he has no reason to fire her. Fang Leng says then he can have Assistant Han give her the tasks then. Dr. Zhang points out that they’re neighbors so it’s impossible for them to never see each other. Fang Leng thanks him for reminding him that they’re neighbors. He then calls Assistant Han.\n\nAt her desk, Xiao Qi has a cute kitty flash drive that she plans to give to Fang Leng. But then she receives a call and rushes home. Chai Jie is sobbing and being consoled by Xiao Bu, who tells her that Fang Leng has bought their apartment and ordered them to move out today. Chai Jie says this place was given to her by Yun Hai. Before he went abroad, she had even helped him sell it to Li Chun Jiao. She still believes that one day he’ll return to come find her again. So that’s why she stayed here and now, she sobs that he’s gone and the house is gone, too.\n\nXiao Qi returns to the office to tell Fang Leng that it’s fine if he hates her but he must let Chai Jie and the others stay. He tells her that this is a deal between him and the property owner. She explains that he doesn’t know how much the place means to Chai Jie who is waiting for the return of her first love. She says he can hate her and even fire her but can’t he let Chai Jie continue staying there? He tells her there’s nothing in this world that can’t be done. To wait is to deceive oneself. Isn’t it better to realize it sooner?\n\nCXQ: There will be people like this in this world, that’ll keep waiting for another. You don’t believe in love yourself. How can you deny others their love?\n\nFL: I don’t believe in love? The most unqualified person to tell me about love right now, is you. CXQ: Who says I’m unqualified?\n\nFL: Do you really believe in love? She doesn’t say anything. If you really believe in it, you wouldn’t keep lying to me.\n\nCXQ: I…\n\n[Ep13] Xiao Qi returns home to confirm that they’re all getting booted out of there. So they’re staying in the stock room of the tea shop. Chai Jie says since they’re staying there, she plans to extend the shop’s hours to midnight. Business remains slow, so she remains quite depressed.\n\nLater, Xiao Qi comes up with the plan to bring Dr. Zhang over to comfort Chai Jie. When she brings up her lost first love, he makes her angry, which is better than her previous state of moping around. She then goes to leave him a bad review, which makes him smile.\n\nXiao Qi returns to work and Assistant Han can’t help her with Fang Leng - unless he wants to lose his job. Mr. Zhou contacts Fang Leng to let him know that his sister is very interested in Future Group. So, he’s invited to tomorrow’s family lunch. Assistant Han then provides him with the first batch of grants, which includes Xiao Qi as a perfumer for the pheromone project. Fang Leng decides to set that one aside and have him follow up on other ones instead. Assistant Han tells Xiao Qi that Fang Leng is concerned about the follow-up funding delaying the project. So he’s been worrying about the investment. Xiao Qi decides to work on getting funding.\n\nLater, she goes to see Fang Leng about the investment and drops off the “Manual of Procedures Regarding Loans Secured Against Nude Photos” and “Rules for High-Interest Loans.” He’s not interested. She then kidnaps some rich lady’s dog to collect on the reward for its return home. He yells at her to return the dog. She has more ideas and he continues shooting down all of her ideas…\n\nXiao Bu is showing Fang Lie the site for “Cape Town Normal University,” which is the number one university in the world, in terms of teaching staff and employment rate. Normal. lol She’s already prepared the admission letter for him. He’s impressed and thanks her with a soft pat on the head, which quickly sends her system into heat overload. She tries to take slow breaths to calm down but then his mother knocks on the door, and she’s shoved out onto the balcony. She promptly turns into a tortoise!\n\nFang Lie’s mother finds him reading but notices that he’s tearing up. She asks what’s going on. He claims that he’s in tears because of his studies. Then he tells her that he’s been too willful and childish. Now he knows that learning can make him happy. He then shows her the admission letter, and that he’s wasting his time at home when he could be at school. Her happiness at this is dampened by the fact that he didn’t apply for an Ivy League school in the U.S. He tells her that he chose a local school because he wants to take over the family business. When she asks about the ranking of the school, he tells her what Xiao Bu told him - it’s number one in the world. Then he says they only recruit geniuses or prodigies, so many people don’t know about this school. She’ll support him so long as he ceases pursuing the arts and gives up his dreams of becoming an artist. Mom happily leaves to tell his father. Fang Lie runs outside to look for Xiao Bu but she’s gone.\n\nXiao Qi is at the tea shop trying to figure out where to get an investment. Chai Jie interrupts to ask why Xiao Bu isn’t back yet. Xiao Qi has no idea either. Then she asks how her conversation with Dr. Zhang went. Chai Jie says he’s a very sweet man, very attentive, has high empathy and a good listener. She says that she almost left a five-star review. She then heads for bedtime in the stock room. Xiao Bu finally shows up, still in her little tortoise form, and asks for Xiao Bu to help her cool down. After an ice bath, Xiao Bu returns to her human form. She immediately asks Xiao Qi to rub her on the head. Nothing happens. She asks why it is that when Fang Lie pats her on the head she turns into a tortoise. After confirming all of her symptoms, Xiao Qi arrives at the conclusion that her head was cracked - meaning her central processing unit (CPU) has been damaged. So that’s why she’ll turn into a tortoise whenever he touches her head.\n\nThe next day, Fang Leng arrives at the Zhou residence and is greeted by Meng Fei, Mr. Zhou’s niece. Ugh, she's back. She claims that her mother insisted that she come along. The family lunch includes Fang Leng’s father and his stepmother, who is less than happy to see him. Mr. Zhou explains that he was just singing praises about him. Meng Fei’s mother says that she’s heard about him setting up a special research department for the company’s beauty line, and asks if he isn’t afraid of the high upfront costs and the impact on profitability later on. Fang Leng says it was set up mainly to gain consumer acceptance of their products in the marketplace. As for a quick return on investment, it’s just a matter of time before it comes profitable. She thinks he’s quite bold but has great vision. She had hoped that her daughter would study finance so she could pass the company to her but she has no interest nor talent in doing business at all. Her uncle says that she needs to find the right person to take care of her, and she looks over at Fang Leng. *rolling eyes* I don’t trust her. Fang Leng’s stepmother says if she’d known that business required more networking than studying, then she would’ve brought her son, Fang Lie along today. Fang Leng shakes his head at this. His father says that he’s still young and should study more. His wife says she thinks that he can take over the company in a few years’ time.\n\nMeng Fei then mentions that they’re having a business reception tomorrow evening, and then offers an invitation card to Fang Leng. He replies that he has a meeting tomorrow. Mr. Zhou says that she reserved it for him herself, so don’t turn it down. Besides, the R&D department will need more investment in the future, so he can meet more people and expand his network. So he accepts the invitation. Later the Zhou siblings make plans to use Xiao Qi’s falling out with Fang Leng to their advantage.\n\nXiao Qi delivers milk teas and cakes to Shi Yi’s home, and he hands her an invitation to the same reception. He asks for her to accompany him tomorrow. She says that she can’t as she needs to make deliveries for Chai Jie. He then says it’s too bad as she needs investment for the R&D department. She snatches the invitation from him and agrees to go. When she leaves, he opens the fridge that’s full of milk tea cups and cake boxes.\n\nXiao Qi returns to the shop and finds Chai Jie laughing at her tablet. She asks how there’s not a single customer in sight. Chai Jie says that she, gesturing with her chin, at Fang Lie’s mother, who has booked out the entire place again. Fang Lie’s mother asks her if she’s run out of the 100,000 RMB. Xiao Qi asks how she knows this. Fang Lie’s mother replies that she was supposed to report Fang Leng’s every move, but she gave her some other nonsense. Xiao Qi replies that she knows how he works, and won’t let others interfere. Fang Lie’s mother says forget it and then throws down an invitation to the same reception, and tells her that Fang Leng’s going to this reception tomorrow. So she needs to dress up to impress him, and gestures as the bags on the table. Xiao Qi thinks about needing to get an investment and having Fang Leng forgive her. So she accepts this invitation and the bags.\n\nThe next evening, Assistant Han is waiting to drive Fang Leng to the event. The minute he sees him, he asks where Xiao Qi is. This is met with a derisive look. Assistant Han quickly says that his bow tie is crooked and goes to adjust it. They take off even though Assistant Han seems to be waiting for Xiao Qi to appear – even though he knows that she’s not living there anymore. Xiao Qi is upstairs updating her collaboration documents on the cute kitty USB drive. It’s for Fang Leng. She’s hoping that her beautiful outfit and this present will make him forgive her finally.\n\nShi Yi waits for Xiao Qi to arrive, and she does so, in this lovely pink dress on her pink motorbike with her matching pink helmet. She hands her motorbike to the valet person, and then puts her hand on Shi Yi’s elbow. He’s startled by this, and she explains that ladies will hold their partner’s arm to enter the venue, which is what Fang Leng told her. After they turn in their invitations, he stops her at the top of the stairs to show her something – it’s her missing earring from before! He helps her put it on and at this point, Fang Leng arrives to see her smiling as she’s adjusting the earring into place. Meng Fei arrives right behind him and asks if that’s the same girl as before. He watches as Xiao Qi links arms with Shi Yi, and when Meng Fei asks who the guy is, Fang Leng only offers her his arm.\n\nInside, Shi Yi introduces Xiao Qi to a Mr. Li, who asks if they’re a couple as they look good together. She clarifies that they’re only friends. When she spots Fang Leng, she uses the excuse of getting food, when she's really going to say hi to him. Meng Fei responds wiith a smile that doesn’t reach her eyes, says she looks lovely and Xiao Qi says the same to her. Xiao Qi asks him if she fascinates him in this dress, and he jealously says that she came with someone else so what’s the point. She tells him that she’s just met Mr. Li, as there appear to be several wealthy people here so they can surely get an investment. A girl calls out Meng Fei’s name, and it’s that annoying twit, Na Na, and she's with her parents. Na Na’s mother asks Meng Fei if this man is the Mr. Fang she’s been talking about. Fang Leng politely introduces himself to the parents, and the mother says that he’s not only young and talented but also good-looking. Xiao Qi smiles at this. The mother then says that he’s a good match for Meng Fei, which makes Xiao Qi lose her smile. Meng Fei softly tells her to stop joking around. The woman insists that she’s serious as they’re a match made in heaven. Fang Leng just sips his wine as Xiao Qi loses the sparkle in her eyes. The man then asks to speak to Fang Leng about investment issues.\n\nXiao Qi tries to follow them but she’s blocked by Na Na who tells her that some people are made for each other, while others are not. Meng Fei tries (pretends) to stop her but Na Na is incessed and says that she remembers Meng Fei only invited Fang Leng. Xiao Qi says it’s none of her business and turns to leave when Na Na grabs her by the shoulder. She then asks if she got another rich guy to pay for her dress. Xiao Qi says to be careful what she says or she’ll get the hiccups. Na Na says don’t try to fool her as she won’t back down, so Xiao Qi uses her powers to give her the hiccups. She asks if she gave her the hiccups and then goes to throw her glass of wine at her, but then her heel breaks. At this point, Shi Yi stops time and transports himself to catch Xiao Qi as she’s backing away from the flying wine. Things return to normal, as he asks Xiao Qi if she's okay. She says she’s fine and waves off his hands. Fang Leng returns and Shi Yi introduces himself as the CEO of The One, which makes Fang Leng look at Xiao Qi knowingly, and Na Na sputters if she’s obsessed with CEOs. Meng Fei tries to get Na Na to stop saying things. The two guys size each other up, and then Fang Leng says it’s no wonder the deal came through so quickly. Fang Leng then introduces himself as the CEO of Future Group, and the two shake hands. Shi Yi says that he always keeps business and personal matters separate. He says it was all due to Xiao Qi’s own efforts to get everyone’s approval. He says he envies him for having such a good staff. Fang Leng then cuts his eyes at Xiao Qi and tells her not to come to work tomorrow. She’s surprised by this. Fang Leng then walks away and Xiao Qi chases after him. Na Na comments that Fang Leng really is jealous, which makes Meng Fei’s cold eyes become even more icy. Na Na keeps yammering on until Meng Fei sternly tells her to stop talking. Na Na stops talking but continues to have the hiccups.\n\nXiao Qi catches up to Fang Leng as he's hanging out on the balcony. She asks if he’s still angry but he doesn’t say anything. She then dangles the kitty USB drive in front of his face and says that he won’t be angry when he sees this. Fang Leng turns to look and then shoves at her arm, which causes her to drop the USB drive down into the bushes below. He facetiously says that she must be tired after all of this hard work. She’s upset as looks over the balcony trying to see where the USB drive landed. He tells her that she’s trying to please both him and Jiang Shi Yi at the same time. He didn’t expect her to be such a tactful person.\n\nCXQ: I just want to apologize to you. Don’t be so rude. Besides, I’ve apologized to you so many times, yet you’re still not happy.\n\nFL: Apologize? Did you know that an apology is the most hypocritical thing in the world? And do you really want to ask my forgiveness or do you want to make yourself feel better?\n\nCXQ: I have to get your forgiveness before I can feel better. This is not a conflict, isn’t it?\n\nFLscoffing: Then your apology is too expedient.\n\nCXQ: Expedient? I came here to help you get sponsorship, but you say I’m expedient. If I’m expedient, I wouldn’t have agreed to Shi Yi, let alone come here, okay?\n\nFL: Shi Yi? I really didn’t expect you two to get close so quickly. So are you saying you’re with him because of me? Now he's angry and jealous?\n\nCXQ: Yes. I’m glad you know.\n\nFL: Then you don’t have to worry about the R&D department anymore. She looks shocked by this. I set it up because of pheromone perfumes. The idea of pheromone perfumes came about because of you. If that’s why you’ve been struggling, then from now on, I will officially cancel the project. You don’t have to get any more financial support for it. He then turns to leave. She calls after him.\n\nCXQ: How can you just give up when you’ve held on for so long?\n\nFLroaring: Because I hate the sight of you! She looks so hurt by his barbed words. I don’t want to keep this going. He walks away from her. Her face finally crumples as she watches him go. I can’t handle her face here. :(\n\nFang Leng returns to the reception, and Meng Fei quickly introduces her to Mr. Gu from Sanshu Technology. Fang Leng politely says hi and exchanges a handshake with the man. He then tells her that he needs to leave. Meng Fei asks if he isn’t going to send her back. Mr. Gu says if it’s not convenient for him, he’ll send her back himself. Fang Leng thanks him and then walks away. Meng Fei is peeved.\n\nXiao Qi is outside looking through the bushes and grass for the USB drive. But no such luck. Afterwards, Shi Yi joins her at the table by placing a piece of candy on the light. She asks him if he finds her loathsome. He laughs and asks if she finds him loathsome. She says no, as she thinks he’s gentle, kind, and helpful. So of course she doesn’t hate him. He replies that he thinks she’s kind, cute and funny. If she’s loathsome then no one in this world is worth liking. This doesn’t seem to make her any happier though as she looks down glumly at her feet. He looks up at the sky and tells her to look at the moon. He says some people find it to be serene and beautiful while others find it indefinite. It’s the same for them, as they can’t please everyone. So just be herself. She nods at this. He then says if someone makes her sad, then someone else will make her happy. He then tells her to eat some candy. She unwraps the candy and eats it. As she’s chewing, she glumly asks why she’s still unhappy this time even though she’s eating the candy. Her poor heart is shattered right now. And she's not the only one...\n\nShi Yi asks if she knows why he carries candies with him. She shakes her head no. He says when he was young, he had no friends. Whatever happened, he had to take it on himself. Once, when he was sad he hid in the garden alone. Then a little girl came and handed him a piece of candy. She had told him that eating candy would make him happy. That was the first time someone cared about him. When he had seen the little girl’s smile, he’d smiled back. Xiao Qi says since he remembers this so well from his childhood, then it must be a very important memory for him. He says yes, and since then, he’s been smiling a lot as he wants to spread his smile to everyone around him. He says that as her friend, she looks her best when she smiles. He then offers to take her home. She asks to be dropped off a bit away from her place so she can walk back by herself.\n\n[Ep14] It’s a flashback of a young Shi Yi who is sad as he looks at his test - he's failed. A little girl walks up and asks him how is this something to be sad about, as she’s failed seven times but she’s still fine. She then hands him a piece of candy from Earth and says if he eats one, then he’ll be happy. She then eats a piece and encourages him to eat one, too. She smiles at him, and he says she has a nice smile. She then suggests that they become friends. He’s not sure what that means. She says it’s a term used on Earth, as friends will share delicious food and praise each other with all of their heart. But most importantly, friends should be sincere and never betray each other. She continues smiling at him. In the present, Shi Yi is looking at the candy wrapper and smiling to himself. He says that Xiao Qi is here to complete her mission, not to be bullied by him [Fang Leng].\n\nWhile at Wubo Boxing Club, Fang Leng is quite aggressive in the ring as even his sparring partner is quite winded and laying on the floor. Shi Yi appears and offers to spar with him. The two guys start fighting, no holds barred. Then the two are laying on the floor and trying to get the other to surrender by grabbing onto each other’s foot, and they’re arguing about Xiao Qi. Shi Yi yells that he has no right to be mad at Xiao Qi. Fang Leng retorts that their matter is none of his business. Shi Yi insists that Xiao Qi’s business is his business. He warns Fang Leng that if he dares to bully Xiao Qi, he’ll kill him! Fang Leng says that he doesn’t have what it takes. The two then try to get the other to acquiesce by tickling each other’s foot and start rolling around in the ring. Hmm. Was there a point to this?\n\nToday, Xiao Qi has decided to resign from her position at Future Group and is quietly packing up her personal belongings. Assistant Han gives her a romance novel as a parting gift. He encourages her to continue to learn and improve herself to make a comeback. Xiao Qi says the tea shop isn’t far from his place, so order more takeout to support them. Fang Leng walks by but he doesn’t acknowledge her. She pauses for a second and then returns to packing up her stuff. Assistant Han goes to talk to him, but when he brings up her resignation, Fang Leng doesn’t have much of a reaction except that he doesn’t want to talk about it. He just wants to know what’s on his agenda for today. Assistant Han tells him the schedule and they’re interrupted by Meng Fei who’s here to drop off coffee for him. Assistant Han isn’t sure what to think of this.\n\nXiao Qi finishes handing off her work and then takes off. Back in his office, Meng Fei is telling Fang Leng about the details for the Future Group lipgloss photoshoot, which will be at the aquarium. Fang Leng is actually looking out his window at Xiao Qi’s desk which is bereft of any sign of her. Meng Fei asks for his opinion on taking publicity photos this afternoon and has to get his attention a couple of times before he says it’s fine. She gets up to leave but then turns around and asks since he didn’t send her home last night, isn’t he going to see her off today? He politely smiles and walks her out to the elevators…where Xiao Qi is waiting with her box of stuff. Fang Leng looks at her as Meng Fei sweetly asks her why she quit. Fang Leng says it was her own decision. Meng Fei says a real diamond never loses its shine. So no matter what company she goes to in the future, keep up the good work. She’s so phony. Xiao Qi just smiles and nods politely at her and Fang Leng, before getting into the elevator that’s just arrived. Meng Fei follows right behind her, and once the door closes, she drops her fake smile and starts telling Xiao Qi to know her place. She then warns her to not let her see her around Fang Leng again as she gives her a withering look. She says that a girl like her is just a pastime for him. Xiao Qi tries to give her a withering reply of her own but by the time she’s come up with it, Meng Fei has already left the elevator.\n\nFang Lie finally leaves the family home as his mother helps him pack his bags to go study. Then he’s back in the studio and celebrating with Xiao Bu. She’s already found an art competition for him, so he needs to start preparing now. He says there’s no hurry as an artist’s mind needs to be fully relaxed so it can be inspired – and Xiao Bu throws a pillow at him. She tells him to not waste any time. He hasn’t painted for so long, so he’s out of practice. She forces him to sit in front of an easel and puts a paintbrush in his arm and tells him to start painting. Fang Lie’s jumped from one frying pan into another… Hahaha. At least it’s something he does want to pursue?!\n\nBack at Future Group, Fang Leng hands some documents to Assistant Han and asks him to have Xiao Qi make the copies. Assistant Han reminds him that Xiao Qi has resigned. Fang Leng looks over at her empty desk and then ells him to do it. At the lab, Fang Leng says that the fragrance dosage can be more precise and then says that Xiao Qi is in charge of this project. Once again, Assistant Han reminds him that she’s resigned. Later, he calls Xiao Qi’s extension to ask her to bring him a cup of coffee. Assistant Han answers and asks if he’s missing Xiao Qi. Fang Leng asks if he shouldn’t disconnect the line of the employee who just left and then asks him to bring him coffee.\n\nAt the tea shop, Xiao Qi is unable to keep track of the orders for the right customers. Chai Jie asks if she’s just tired. They’re interrupted by Shi Yi who has tickets to the Candy Art Show. Chai Jie says she’s thinking about adding candy to her shop, so she should go check it out with him. Xiao Qi agrees to go with him.\n\nWhen they arrive at the show, Xiao Qi looks pleasantly surprised by the display of so much candy. She asks if she can buy all of these, and he tells her to pick out whatever she wants. She’s back to smiling and laughing as Shi Yi takes pictures of her, and then selfies of them together.\n\nBack at the office, Fang Leng is reminded of the photoshoot at the aquarium, which he’s not happy about. Assistant Han then receives a notification from Meng Fei who says they’re ready. Fang Leng says to cancel it as they have a meeting this afternoon. He then receives a notification from Dr. Zhang: “Your backyard is on fire. Look at your Moments.” Fang Leng checks and sees a photo of Xiao Qi with Shi Yi and he’s quite exasperated by this. Assistant Han says that he doesn’t like Meng Fei either but he did promise her so if they cancel and delay… Fang Leng interjects to say they can do the photo shoot, but change the location to the candy art show. Assistant Han says that’s impossible, which earns him eye daggers from Fang Leng. He quickly says he meant it’s impossible to change it right away. Fang Leng just tells him to hurry.\n\nXiao Qi and Shi Yi are enjoying their time at the candy art show until a child drops his bag of candies and it spills all over the floor. Xiao Qi steps on them and ends up nearly falling but Shi Yi catches her with an arm around her, and this is when Fang Leng shows up with Assistant Han, Meng Fei and the photography crew. Fang Leng definitely notices Shi Yi’s hand on her shoulder. Shi Yi removes his hand and then asks how he has time to come to an exhibition like this on a weekday. Fang Leng says he’s here for work and asks what they’re doing. Shi Yi says they have their own plans, and goes to leave. Xiao Qi gives a polite smile and says let’s go. However, the photographer stops them and asks if they’d like to be their models. Xiao Qi is confused. The photographer says they’re photogenic, and she knows Fang Leng, so it’ll be good for them to work together. Meng Fei says it’s inappropriate at the same time Fang Leng says he likes the idea. He continues that their two companies are already partners so he’s sure Mr. Jiang won’t mind helping out. Shi Yi asks Xiao Qi if she’s willing and she says no and goes to leave. Fang Leng says one can’t build up chemistry in a short time. If they can’t do it, then let’s not waste time. Xiao Qi takes the bait and asks who says they don’t have chemistry. Meng Fei rolls her eyes at this as Shi Yi grimaces.\n\nXiao Qi is now in a flirty white dress while Meng Fei is in form-fitting black one. The two vye for the better photo with a product in their hands. However, Xiao Qi is a novice at this and is a bit stiff. Meng Fei tells her three key points to focus on in photoshoots: image, appearance and figure, and gestures at herself - implying that she’s taller, slightly more curvy, and has better poses. Xiao Qi tries to emulate her poses but she’s too robotic. Meng Fei tells her that this isn’t for her, so Xiao Qi tells her to forget it and returns to being more natural. When Xiao Qi smiles, both the photographer and Assistant Han encourage her to maintain that smile. Wan Peng’s smile is one of my favorite things about her. The two girls then start trying to outdo each other and even block each other at every shot. Once this round is done, the photographer tells them to change their outfits.\n\nNow it’s the guys’ turn - Fang Leng is in a black tux with white embellishments and Shi Yi is in a white suit with black embellishments, to convey the manliness and femininity of the makeup. Right… The photographer suggests that Fang Leng undoes his top button. Why would he unbutton with a bowtie on?! lol The photoshoot starts and the competition starts. It soon dissolves into both men removing their jackets, then their vests and finally the bowties come off. Fang Leng then ups the ante by unbuttoning his shirt to showcase a deep V view of his chest, which makes all of the women swoon. Shi Yi starts unbuttoning his shirt as well and Fang Leng is practically unbuttoned down to his navel area, before the photographer tells them both to stop. lol Both guys offer to continue unbuttoning but the photographer says one more button and they can’t broadcast it. XD (~25:40, This scene makes me cringe and laugh at the same time.)\n\nIt’s nearly time for the couples’ shots now. Xiao Qi brings Shi Yi a bottle of water, and trips into him as she’s not used to wearing heels. Fang Leng notices her attentiveness. Meng Fei tries to give Fang Leng a bottle of water, but Assistant Han takes it away from her to give it to him himself. Heh. When she attempts to blot some sweat from Fang Leng’s brow with a towel, Assistant Han takes it away from her, which makes her scowl. Bwahaha. Fang Leng drinks his water but has his eyes on Xiao Qi who is taking a sip from the water bottle that Shi Yi opened for her. Meng Fei now snatches back the towel from Assistant Han’s hand but she notices that Fang Leng’s gaze is fixed on Xiao Qi.\n\nThey start round two of the photoshoot with Xiao Qi paired with Shi Yi and Fang Leng paired with Meng Fei, however, Fang Leng is still staring openly at Xiao Qi. When Xiao Qi looks over at the other couple and notices Meng Fei hanging off of Fang Leng, she then starts placing her own arm on Shi Yi for the shots. Now both Xiao Qi and Fang Leng are jealous of the other’s attention on their partners. The photographer asks Xiao Qi to raise a leg for a more playful shot which she attempts with one foot lifted forward but it makes her teeter backwards and Fang Leng quickly catches her. The two stare at each other as the photographer continues snapping away. The photographer is very pleased as he says this is the CP he wants. He then suggests they swap partners, as Meng Fei to be paired with Shi Yi. Xiao Qi objects to this. Meng Fei says that she and Fang Leng are great together. Fang Leng says they shouldn’t swap partners but he guesses that he’s trying to get the best shot. Bwahaha. Sneaky CEO. The photographer nods at this, and so Fang Leng asks if she’s afraid. She takes the bait and rises to the challenge.\n\nThe photographer tells the extras Shi Yi and Meng Fei to take a break, which makes Meng Fei walk off in a huff and Shi Yi reluctantly joins her. The photographer tells our original couple to stand closer to each other but Xiao Qi won’t budge. So Fang Leng pulls her to his side and leaves his hand on her shoulder. He asks her why she’s so distant and if she’s feeling guilty. She replies what she has to feel guilty about as she hasn’t done anything wrong. She then spins away from him. He then tells her that since she’s left the company, their productivity has gone up by 25%.\n\nThis makes her sneer and sputter at him but the photographer tells them to mind their expressions. Ha. Her sneer. (GIF in comments.) Xiao Qi is forced to change her sneer into a tight smile instead. Fang Leng brings up the fact that she left without saying a word to him. He asks if she liaised with Assistant Han. She says that she’s passed all of her work to him. Every single one of them.\n\nHe puts his arm around her again and softly asks, what about him? She cuts her eyes at him for a second before remembering to smile for the camera. He looks at her tenderly as he says she usually brings him coffee and prepared documents. He asks if she checked with him before she left. She jerks out of his arm and walks around to the other side of him and tells him to stop being ridiculous. He’s the one who said he hated her so he should be happy that she left, and then she turns her back to him. He reaches around to swing her around to face him and into his arms, and then he says emotionally that it was said in anger. She's surprised and looks up into his eyes as he stares back at her. It’s as if time stopped and they’re alone in the world – until the photographer tells them to look at the camera. She realizes her hands are on his chest and he smiles at this. She avoids looking into his eyes now. The two turn to face the camera, and soon they’re both sporting a cute little smile. (~28:45, sweet with a tinge of sadness.)\n\nThe two try to not sneak peeks at each other but they’re not succeeding. The photographer continues taking shots of them doing various cute poses and asks them to be more affectionate. So cute! A concerned-looking Shi Yi and angry-looking Meng Fei watch them from the sidelines. Meng Fei chides Shi Yi for letting his woman get so close to someone else. Shi Yi retorts, isn't she as well? She doesn’t have a response - just a sour expression.\n\nFang Lie struggles to find inspiration to paint anything. Xiao Bu tells him to think of something that makes his heart flutter. He looks at her and when she smiles at him, he realizes that he knows what makes his heart flutter. She asks what it is and he asks if it would be appropriate to say it out loud as he continues looking into her eyes. She smiles and starts fanning herself as she’s getting overheated already, and tells him that he can say it. He whispers, first place trophy. This cools her down immediately. LOL! She sits down and wonders why she got so overheated and then suddenly cooled down as Fang Lie continues chanting about first place. When his mother calls, he freaks out as he’s so late in returning home. She assures him that she’ll show him a shortcut and he’ll be home in five minutes. When he goes to pat her on the head, she stops his hand from touching her head, and warns him to not touch her head anymore. But then she grabs his hand and they take off running hand-in-hand. Fang Lie notices that they’re still holding hands, and asks what kind of logic is this that he can’t touch her head but they’re holding hands. She says she doesn’t care, but don’t touch her head.\n\nThe photoshoot wraps up and Xiao Qi returns to ignoring Fang Leng. Shi Yi asks if they go to dinner and she agrees and leaves to change her clothes. Afterwards, Meng Fei confronts Xiao Qi about having the knack for spoiling her day. She tells her if she can give up on Fang Leng, then she will introduce her to other rich men. Xiao Qi tells her thanks but no thanks and then goes to leave. But Meng Fei stops her to tell her to be realistic as Fang Leng will definitely choose someone who can help him, not an ordinary delivery girl like her. Besides, in terms of background and appearance, how can she compare with her? Xiao Qi asks why she looks down on people who work – because they don’t wink and squeeze fake tears like hers? Meng Fei takes offense at this. Xiao Qi says there’s only the two of them here, so who else could she be referring to. Then she asks her to stop bringing up her family, as without her family, who cares about her, and who would recognize her. No one would recognize her in a crowd as she’s a nobody. She sputters at this but Xiao Qi says she’s beautiful (I think she isn’t because of her dead eyes) but what’s the point as there are plenty of beautiful people like her out there. Xiao Qi then says her makeup looks cakey before she walks away from her. Heh.\n\nXiao Qi sighs in relief that she recited it all correctly. Shi Yi says her name and they go to leave together. Meng Fei sees Fang Leng making his way over and she suddenly feigns a sprained ankle. Shi Yi rolls his eyes at this as Fang Leng asks what’s going on. Xiao Qi says sarcastically, “Wow, Mr. Fang is so kind. Then please take care of your pretty girlfriend who is worthy of you.” She then turns to Shi Yi and says let’s go. As Fang Leng watches her walk away, Meng Fei seizes the opportunity to say that she’s sprained her ankle and it hurts. He looks at her with a bit of derision and asks if she’s fine. She asks if he could take her to the hospital as she continues pretending to be in pain. He says, “Ms. Chen, you’ve overacted.” Then he walks away. Buh-bye!\n\nFang Leng is driving and replaying recent events in his head, namely, Shi Yi’s hand on Xiao Qi’s shoulder and how he’d knocked the USB drive out of Xiao Qi’s hand over that balcony. Her words about her apologizing to him so many times makes him finally stop and turn the car around. He returns to where the reception was and searches through the same bushes for the USB drive. After a while, he finally sits down as he’s unable to find it. It’s actually right next to his feet, as it’s fallen through the grate, tucked perfectly out of sight.\n\n[Ep15] Shi Yi walks Xiao Qi home and says that they ate so many sweets today, so hopefully she’s cheered up. She asks if he thinks she’s upset. He comments that she’s had an awkward smile since they’ve left the exhibition. She says that she’s had fun today but she kind of misses home as she’s been away from home. She looks up at the sky and says “take me home” over and over. She realizes that she’s being weird and tells him to ignore it. Shi Yi thinks to himself that he’ll definitely take her back home.\n\nShi Yi returns home and asks his AI assistant, Candy if she misses home. Did he pick her name or just coincidental? She replies that she’s a robot without emotions or mood swings. Suddenly a call comes in from the Cape Town Chief, and he appears by hologram in his living room. Chief asks how the mission is going. Shi Yi says that he’s still looking for opportunities to approach Fang Leng, and at the same time, trying to help No. 7. The Chief reprimands him for being on Earth for so long yet he hasn’t secured the Hormone Element. He reminds him that if he wants to be the next leader, he’ll need to keep his promise.\n\nBack at the tea shop, Xiao Bu learns from Xiao Qi that Fang Leng is dating Meng Fei. Since she can no longer collect his hormones, this mission is a total failure. The girls are eating bowls of instant noodles and Xiao Qi adds vinegar to hers. Chi chu = eating vinegar, ergo jealous. Xiao Bu says then in a few days' time, when they find out it’s been a failure, Cape Town will send someone to pick them up. Xiao Qi is angrily jabbing at her noodles with her chopsticks and wondering why they’re still not ready. Xiao Bu asks why she’s so angry, and shouldn’t she be happy to go home so he can’t bully her anymore. Xiao Qi says she’s quite happy and overjoyed. However, seeing the two of them annoys her so much and then she takes a bite of her hot noodles. Xiao Bu checks her temp and says she doesn’t have a fever. So she analyzes her data, and it shows her that Xiao Qi is frustrated because a man is with another woman, meaning she’s jealous. She asks if she’s jealous. Xiao Qi says yes, she’s chi chu as she pours more vinegar into her noodles and then dumps the rest of the vinegar into Xiao Bu’s bowl. When she thinks about Fang Leng with Meng Fei, she starts muttering about how she’s helped him with the proposal, and everything else. Who does he think he is? But then she realizes that her USB drive is still missing.\n\nBack at home, Fang Leng is accessing the USB drive and looking through its contents on his computer and smiling about it. Oh, so he did find it!\n\nThe next day, Fang Leng tells Assistant Han to contact Xiao Qi and tell her to return to the company as soon as possible. The proposal needs to be revised. *facepalm* Assistant Han tells him that he’s told him many times, Xiao Qi has resigned. Fang Leng looks at him and tells him to go. Assistant Han smiles as he understands what this means now. At the tea shop, Xiao Qi tells Assistant Han that she’s not his employee. Why should she help him with the proposal? Assistant Han says that’s just an excuse, as he actually regrets it now and wants her back. She asks if the proposal wasn’t in her USB drive, so how did he see it? He explains that after the photoshoot yesterday, he went looking for it. It’s the first time he’s seen him so anxious. He tells her that she doesn’t have to feel touched, just go back with him. She tells him that she doesn’t want to go – does he think she’s stupid? Why go back and be bullied by him? She returns to her work at the tea shop.\n\nFang Leng asks Assistant Han what she said. He says that she wants her USB back and it cost 200 RMB and it’s quite expensive. She also said she’s quite busy, and she doesn’t want him to disturb her all the time. Assistant Han then suggests that he order takeout from the shop as she does the deliveries. Fang Leng pulls out his phone but he doesn’t know how to order from his phone. He tells Assistant Han to teach him. Ha!\n\nA large order arrives at the tea shop: 7 milk teas and 7 slices of cake. Xiao Bu notices that it’s from Fang Leng. Nincompoop. Why not use a different name? Xiao Qi wonders what’s wrong with him - first he asked for her to revise the proposal and now he’s ordered so much food. She scoffs at this and then walks away to get started. Fang Leng is waiting in the lobby for the delivery and he’s pacing back and forth in anticipation. When he spots the pink motorbike with its matching driver, he smiles and pretends to be not waiting for it. She brings in the delivery and taps him on the shoulder. He turns around and it’s actually Xiao Bu! He asks if Xiao Qi doesn’t usually do the deliveries. Xiao Bu says that she happened to be free today so she’s doing it now. And if he places more orders, she’ll be delivering it anyway. She gives him a smile and then turns to leave. But she turns back and pulls on her right lower eyelid and then sticks out her tongue at him before finally walking away. Akanbe! [A Japanese expression to taunt, or an insult.] Assistant Han’s been recording this interaction from nearby and thinks that the boss can’t do anything. He’s a bit entertained by this but stops immediately when Fang Leng glares at him through the camera lens and yells at him to get over there. Ha! Fang Leng then orders him to eat all of the food. No food waste!\n\nFang Lie calls to ask his brother why he’s transferred all of this money into his account. Fang Leng says to treat it as his living expenses as he’s just ran away from home and he has a girlfriend. So he’ll need to spend money. And then he suddenly encourages him to go on a date right now with his girlfriend. Take her somewhere unique, and the longer, the better and don’t come back before 11 p.m. Ah. XD Get rid of the stand-in.\n\nHe sends in another order, and Xiao Qi sees his order and calls for Xiao Bu. Chai Jie tells her that Fang Lie asked Xiao Bu to go on a date at the technology exhibition, so she gave her a day off today. She finds this to be so romantic. Xiao Qi says then she’s not doing the deliveries. Chai Jie says young people need to know priorities. How can one let work get in the way of dating? LMAO! Xiao Qi says if she’s not doing the deliveries, then - and with a whine in her voice - she has to, and she doesn’t want to see Fang Leng. Chai Jie solves the issue, but not taking his order - and unplugs the connection. Haha. Okay, so no need to pay the bills now? Xiao Qi asks if she’s serious about this. Chai Jie says of course, and he’ll need to do more than this if he wants to see her. Xiao Qi hugs her for this.\n\nFang Leng shows up at the shop looking for Xiao Qi. Chai Jie sees him and sighs that he didn’t even bring flowers. She says he’s insincere and then asks if he’s there to see their Xiao Qi. He says he was in the area after work. She says as their shop’s super VIP, he’s welcome here. But as Xiao Qi’s friend, there are some things that she must say. How could he make her so sad? First, he kicked her out of the company and her home. That wasn’t enough as he then said that he hated her. She asks what does he take her for - someone he can drive away as he wishes? Fang Leng replies that she lied to him first, so why is it his fault now. She says she’s a kind and naive girl, and if she lied, then she must’ve had her own reasons to do so. They’ve been together for so long, how does he not have even the most basic trust in her? They’re interrupted by Xiao Qi who asks about the tray of milk tea. Chai Jie waves her away. Fang Leng tries to walk over to her but Chai Jie keeps him there as she’s not done with him. Is anyone going to give Fang Leng a break for being rightfully angry for being lied to though?\n\nChai Jie says as the boss of a huge company, at least he’s learned about emotion management, right? Don’t quarrel or let their relationship turn sour over trivial matters. Fang Leng keeps his watchful gaze on Xiao Qi’s location. She says he should learn from her - she remains calm and at ease no matter who it is. Then Dr. Zhang shows up and Fang Leng slips away. She becomes defensive as she asks Dr. Zhang if he’s here to insult her further. She doesn’t let him get in a word edgewise, so he finally stops trying to say anything and lets her finish talking. When she’s done, he apologizes and invites her to the new Rose Restaurant that she’s been wanting to try, for tomorrow, as an apology.\n\nFang Leng follows Xiao Qi upstairs, and she tells him to put the USB drive on the table and then tries to walk around him. He blocks her from leaving, as he tells her that he’s read her proposal. But then he says that she’s been at the company for so long yet her proposals haven’t improved at all. He continues going on about how to write a proper proposal… lol! He says as the boss it is normal for him to correct his employee. She then collects the glasses on the table and tells him to take his time and walks away from him. He gets closer to herHe walks closer to her and she backs away from him. She tells him to keep his distance as he has a girlfriend now. He asks, girlfriend? She says Chen Meng Fei, and if she sees her next to him, she’ll give her trouble again. She can’t handle it so she’ll stay away. He smiles and tells her that they’re just work partners. She’s not his girlfriend. Xiao Qi repeats the last sentence and looks surprised by this. But then she averts her face and gives a little smile. She stifles the smile before turning back to him, to ask if he’s lying to her. He replies that they’ve been together for so long. She lied to him, has he ever lied to her? She thinks about this and then says that she’s going back to work. But she’s got a little smile as she’s walking away from him.\n\nFang Lie and Xiao Bu are at the museum, and he says that he’s here to collect material for inspiration. He’s taking pictures of Xiao Bu and says it’s all for inspiration. When she spots an exhibit on the love between human and robot, she gets curious. She overhears a nearby couple saying that it’s ridiculous for a human to fall in love with a robot, as robots don’t have emotions. She corrects them by saying that advanced robots are capable of emotional thinking, and there’s no difference than normal humans. The woman argues that no matter how advanced a program is, it still doesn’t have a human heart. So falling in love without a heart is deception. The couple leave and it makes Xiao Bu pensive. Fang Lie says that dating a robot would be cool. She asks if he’s okay with the fact that robots have no heart. He replies that heart and sincerity are two completely different things. Humans with hearts can also be cruel. A robot with a heart can be sincere. She smiles at this and says she agrees with him. When he goes to pat her head, she blocks him from doing so. So he squats down next to her and places her hand on top of his head and has her pat his head as he looks up at her! Squeeeeeee. Why are they so cute?! (~20:20) She grins as she continues patting his head and he takes several pictures of her. One of the taglines on the exhibition sign: “Some have even fallen in love with the machine friend. Love was only meant for humans. Now, AI makes human-robot love possible.”\n\nDr. Zhang is at dinner with Fang Leng, who finally asks him what he’s writing as he scribbles away. Dr. Zhang says every time he says, “I’m used to it,” he’s made a note of it. Then he shows him the napkin with the tally marks, so far 11 instances of 正 [Zheng, meaning true or right, 5 strokes in this character], indicating 55 times he’s used that phrase tonight. It proves that he’s not used to it and starting to feel insecure. Dr. Zhang says that he’s afraid that Xiao Qi will leave him for good. He denies this and says that he thinks it’s irresponsible of her to just leave suddenly. Dr. Zhang chides him for refusing to admit it, and then asks if it’s so hard for him to just admit that he cares about Xiao Qi. He suggests that he just get her back if he can’t bear the thought of losing her. Fang Leng asks how, if she keeps avoiding him. Dr. Zhang says no one chooses to leave on a whim. He needs to recall carefully why she left him. Dr. Zhang receives a call and has to leave to answer it. Fang Leng talks to the empty seat, that she left him because he was angry that she lied to him. So he surmises that he’ll just have to forgive her then and that’s so simple. Oh boy…\n\nForgiveness. The next day, she’s working at the shop when Fang Leng sends her a message - “I’ve forgiven you.” She looks at it and shoves the phone back into her pocket, and then mutters she doesn’t understand him. When she looks at a new order ticket, the name of the customer is “I’ve forgiven you.” She rolls her eyes at this and then crumples up the ticket and says he’s so annoying. While she’s doing the dishes, Xiao Bu tells her that Fang Leng told Fang Lie to ask her to relay the message: “I forgive you.”\n\nApologies. Over the phone, Dr. Zhang tells Fang Leng that she left him because he did something wrong. Fang Leng isn’t sure about that. Dr. Zhang says that without understanding Xiao Qi’s reasons, he kicked her out of the company and forced them to move out. That’s why she’s angry. It isn’t the question of him forgiving her, but rather, he should apologize to her. She’s hurt. And they should both just apologize to each other. Now Xiao Qi receives a flower delivery at the shop with a note that says “Please dedicate these flowers to the most beautiful Ms. Chai.” Chai Jie says they’re for her, from Dr. Zhang. Xiao Qi is disappointed that Fang Leng didn’t send those. And then the delivery man returns with a package for Xiao Qi. When she opens it, it’s a black bank card. She asks the man if it’s from Fang Leng. The man says that Fang Leng is a VIP customer but he can’t disclose the customer’s information… She just looks at him. Oops. She hands the package back to him and says to send it back to where it’s from as the delivery fee will be paid by him. She waves him away. She then mutters that it’s an entire family of black cards. Ha.\n\nAssistant Han brings the rejected package to Fang Leng and says that she’s returned it. He explains that a black card makes a substantial gift. But for Xiao Qi and the others, it isn’t the most practical. Fang Leng doesn’t understand. Assistant Han asks if he’s forgotten - that they’re now living in the stock room of the tea shop. Fang Leng quickly tells him to tell Xiao Qi to move back.\n\nBack in his apartment, Fang Leng is setting up his table with hot pot ingredients, boxes of fried chicken, and other snacks as he waits for the return of his neighbors. He walks out and sees Chai Jie and Xiao Bu moving in but no sign of Xiao Qi. He asks where she is, and Chai Jie tells him that she’s very stubborn and insists on staying at the shop. Xiao Bu wonders if she’s had dinner yet. Chai Jie says no, probably not as she can’t cook, but it’s likely that she’s eating instant noodles now. Fang Leng runs to his apartment and packs up the snacks and fried chicken. He then drives over to the tea shop.\n\nAt the tea shop, he sees Xiao Qi having dinner with Shi Yi - it’s fried chicken. Fang Leng looks quite floored by this as she’s happily eating fried chicken with another guy. He remembers their previous conversation, when he told her that she could eat the fried chicken he buys for her. Now, he sets down the bags into a chair outside and leaves.\n\nInside the shop, Shi Yi asks Xiao Qi if she’s doing well. She nods. Then he asks if Chen Meng Fei is bothering her. She happily replies that she forgot to tell him that Chen Meng Fei isn’t even Fang Leng’s girlfriend. He asks why she seems to be happy. She says she is a lot happier than a few days ago, but she doesn’t know why. He asks her if she still wants to go home. She shakes her head and says not really right now. It’s because she suddenly realizes that staying here is pretty good and there’s so much delicious food.\n\nBack at home, Fang Leng asks the forum what he should do if his apology is not accepted. The responses: She just doesn’t love him. It’s one-sided love. Break up with her. He throws down the phone. Then he asks what he should do if he’s still hoping that she can forgive him - Not one-sided love. Haha. So concise now. The response: He must’ve used the wrong method! Think about what she likes the most. He rubs his own chest and thinks about what she used to say about his pecs – bouncy, delicate, smooth, elastic. LMAO!!! (29:40) He says of course she likes his body the most as well as his scent. She does…\n\nPecs. Pecs. Pecs! The next day when Xiao Qi opens the shop, Fang Leng is outside in head-to-toe black gym clothes and making sure she sees him. She asks what he’s doing here. He replies that he’s here to exercise as he continues stretching, and he just happened to run into her. He continues stretching and essentially, waving his scent around. She becomes intoxicated by the scent of his hormones. He asks for a bottle of water and she runs away to grab it and says he’s so annoying. When she returns with the bottle, he walks towards her and she tells him to not move and sets the bottle on the table and keeps a safe distance away. He asks her if she thinks the weather is nice today as he enjoys the light breeze. She starts sweeping and then pinches her nose. He then removes his jacket to reveal his tank top - and she notices his muscular arms and pecs. She can’t look away now and stops trying to pinch her nose.\n\nFang Leng just continues stretching and even flexes his arms as he asks if the restrooms are over there. XD No one points like this! She starts walking towards him and sniffing but catches herself and shakes her head. She points the broom at him and tells him to leave before the customers show up. Some customers show up and she hurries in to help them. He tries to follow her in but she tells him to stop and stay outside.\n\nShe takes their order as Fang Leng notices a paper fan by the register. He then starts fanning himself and when she’s done taking the customers’ order, he tells her that it’s sooo hot. It actually looks quite cold out. lol She pinches her nose again and walks away from him. He smirks as he continues fanning away. She places the order and then waits but she struggles to stay upright as she’s quite intoxicated by Fang Leng’s scent. He continues fanning as he walks closer and closer to her. She thinks to herself that his hormones smell so good. She makes herself snap out of it and thinks that she can’t fall for it. The order’s up and she takes the tray but Fang Leng says he’ll help her. She tells him to not cause trouble for her, as she doesn’t have time to play games with him.\n\nAfter she sets down the order for the customers, she turns around and is met with Fang Leng who is now flexing again and says that he hurt his arm during this morning’s workout. But he’s flexing and Xiao Qi struggles to look away and to stop salivating over him. She goes to the counter and picks up the tray of beverages, but when she turns around, she’s greeted by Fang Leng’s pecs! She can’t resist and starts leaning towards his pecs and continues basking in his scent. She's smiling at his pecs! LOL She nearly touches him when she realizes what she’s doing. So she drops off the drinks for the customers and then runs away. Fang Leng calls her name but there’s no response. He’s quite proud of himself. (~31:00)\n\nThe girls sit down to dinner with Chai Jie at the shop. Chai Jie tells her that Fang Leng genuinely wants her to move back in. She then asks what her thoughts are on this. She replies that she doesn’t think so, "
