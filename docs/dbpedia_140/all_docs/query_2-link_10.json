        "text": "Hull and East Yorkshire may not be renowned as a hotbed of television and film talent but you may be shocked by the wealth of stars with links to our area.\n\nThe city has dined for years on the considerable talents of the likes of Tom Courtenay and Maureen Lipman. And of course there is comedian Lucy Beaumont who not only talks of her links to Hull but much of her comedy is inspired by the city, including Hull Raisers which she co-wrote and aired on Channel Four earlier this year.\n\nBut we take a look at some of the established and rising stars of film and television who have been less vocal about their links to the area. Some you may be well aware come from East Yorkshire but other home-grown talent may come as a pleasant and proud surprise.\n\nRead more: How Stranger Things star Charlie Heaton went from a Bridlington council estate to Netflix fame\n\nSome have stronger links than others but all these actors have grown up or were born in the city or the East Riding. We take a look at nine stars who are making waves at home and in Hollywood.\n\nRob Aramayo\n\nSince starring as the young Ned Stark in Game of Thrones, Hull actor Robert Aramayo has not looked back.\n\nRob, grew up in Pickering Road, west Hull, and remains best known for his recurring role as young Eddard Stark in the sixth season of Game of Thrones.
