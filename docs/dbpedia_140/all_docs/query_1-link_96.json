However, it is largely unknown whether early-M due to surgery demonstrates similar effects and whether menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is protective against lung diseases. Objectives To assess the associations of early-M and MHT with lung morbidities and mortalities using the prospective Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) trial. Methods We estimated the risk among 69 706 postmenopausal women in the PLCO trial, stratified by menopausal types and smoking status. Results Early-M was associated with an increased risk of most lung disease and mortality outcomes in ever smokers with the highest risk seen for respiratory mortality (HR 1.98, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.92) in those with bilateral oophorectomy (BO). Early-M was positively associated with chronic bronchitis, and all-cause, non-cancer and respiratory mortality in never smokers with natural menopause or BO, with the highest risk seen for BO— respiratory mortality (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.12). Ever MHT was associated with reduced all-cause, non-cancer and cardiovascular mortality across menopause types regardless of smoking status and was additionally associated with reduced risk of non-ovarian cancer, lung cancer (LC) and respiratory mortality in ever smokers. Among smokers, ever MHT use was associated with a reduction in HR for all-cause, non-cancer and cardiovascular mortality in a duration-dependent manner. Conclusions Smokers with early-M should be targeted for smoking cessation and LC screening regardless of menopause types. MHT users had a lower likelihood of dying from LC and respiratory diseases in ever smokers.\n\nBACKGROUND Numerous studies have assessed the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure and infection among healthcare workers during the pandemic. However, far fewer studies have investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on essential workers in other sectors. Moreover, guidance for maintaining a safely operating workplace in sectors outside of healthcare remains limited. Workplace surveillance has been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but few studies have examined the feasibility or effectiveness of this approach. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of using frequent point-of-care molecular workplace surveillance as an intervention strategy to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 at essential rural workplaces (mining sites) where physical distancing, remote work, and flexible schedules are not possible. METHODS In this non-randomized controlled clinical trial conducted from February 2021–March 2022, 169 miners in New Mexico (intervention cohort) and 61 miners in Wyoming (control cohort) were enrolled. Investigators performed point-of-care rapid antigen testing on midnasal swabs (NS) self-collected by intervention miners. Rates of seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were analyzed in the intervention cohort compared to the control cohort at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. The diagnostic accuracy of detecting SARS-CoV-2 using rapid antigen testing on NS was compared to laboratory-based RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) in a subset of 68 samples. RESULTS Our intervention had a mean acceptance rate of 96.7% and intervention miners exibited lower cumulative seropositivity (p=0.025) demonstrating frequent point-of-care testing is a feasible, effective way to lower the rate of infection. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection in self-administered NS revealed 100% sensitivity and specificity compared to laboratory-based RT-PCR testing on NPS. CONCLUSIONS Our findings establish frequent point-of-care molecular workplace COVID-19 surveillance as a feasible option for keeping essential rural workplaces open and preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread. These findings extend beyond this study, providing valuable insights for designing interventions to maintain employees’ safety at other essential workplaces during an infectious disease outbreak.

Macrophage carbon load (MaCL) is a novel cytology method that quantifies lung deposition dose of black carbon, however it has limited feasibility in large-scale epidemiological study due to the labor-intensive manual counting. Objective To assess the association between MaCL and episodic elevation of combustion particles; to develop artificial intelligence based counting algorithm for MaCL assay. Methods Sputum slides were collected during episodic elevation of ambient PM2.5 (n = 49, daily PM2.5 > 10 µg/m³ for over 2 weeks due to wildfire smoke intrusion in summer and local wood burning in winter) and low PM2.5 period (n = 39, 30-day average PM2.5 < 4 µg/m³) from the Lovelace Smokers cohort. Results Over 98% individual carbon particles in macrophages had diameter <1 µm. MaCL levels scored manually were highly responsive to episodic elevation of ambient PM2.5 and also correlated with lung injury biomarker, plasma CC16. The association with CC16 became more robust when the assessment focused on macrophages with higher carbon load. A Machine-Learning algorithm for Engulfed cArbon Particles (MacLEAP) was developed based on the Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network. MacLEAP algorithm yielded excellent correlations with manual counting for number and area of the particles. The algorithm produced associations with ambient PM2.5 and plasma CC16 that were nearly identical in magnitude to those obtained through manual counting. Impact statement Understanding lung black carbon deposition is crucial for comprehending health effects of combustion particles. We developed “Machine-Learning algorithm for Engulfed cArbon Particles (MacLEAP)”, the first artificial intelligence algorithm for quantifying airway macrophage black carbon. Our study bolstered the algorithm with more training images and its first use in air pollution epidemiology. We revealed macrophage carbon load as a sensitive biomarker for heightened ambient combustion particles due to wildfires and residential wood burning.\n\nBackground Cancer has been disproportionally affecting minorities. Genomic-based cancer disparity analyses have been less common than conventional epidemiological studies. In the past decade, mutational signatures have been established as characteristic footprints of endogenous or exogenous carcinogens. Methods Integrating datasets of diverse cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and geospatial environmental risks of the registry hospitals from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, we explored mutational signatures from the aspect of racial disparity concerning pollutant exposures. The raw geospatial environmental exposure data were refined to 449 air pollutants archived and modeled from 2007 to 2017 and aggregated to the census county level. Additionally, hepatitis B and C viruses and human papillomavirus infection statuses were incorporated into analyses for skin cancer, cervical cancer, and liver cancer. Results Mutation frequencies of key oncogenic genes varied substantially between different races. These differences were further translated into differences in mutational signatures. Survival analysis revealed that the increased pollution level is associated with worse survival. The analysis of the oncogenic virus revealed that aflatoxin, an affirmed carcinogen for liver cancer, was higher in Asian liver cancer patients than in White patients. The aflatoxin mutational signature was exacerbated by hepatitis infection for Asian patients but not for White patients, suggesting a predisposed genetic or genomic disadvantage for Asians concerning aflatoxin. Conclusions Environmental pollutant exposures increase a mutational signature level and worsen cancer prognosis, presenting a definite adverse risk factor for cancer patients.\n\nEpidemiological data across the United States of America illustrate health disparities in COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality by race/ethnicity. However, limited information is available from prospective observational studies in hospitalized patients, particularly for American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations. Here, we present risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality in patients (4/2020–12/2021, n = 475) at the University of New Mexico Hospital. Data were collected on patient demographics, infection duration, laboratory measures, comorbidities, treatment(s), major clinical events, and in-hospital mortality. Severe disease was defined by COVID-related intensive care unit requirements and/or death. The cohort was stratified by self-reported race/ethnicity: AI/AN (30.7%), Hispanic (47.0%), non-Hispanic White (NHW, 18.5%), and Other (4.0%, not included in statistical comparisons). Despite similar timing of infection and comparable comorbidities, admission characteristics for AI/AN patients included younger age (P = 0.02), higher invasive mechanical ventilation requirements (P = 0.0001), and laboratory values indicative of more severe disease. Throughout hospitalization, the AI/AN group also experienced elevated invasive mechanical ventilation (P < 0.0001), shock (P = 0.01), encephalopathy (P = 0.02), and severe COVID-19 (P = 0.0002), consistent with longer hospitalization (P < 0.0001). Self-reported AI/AN race/ethnicity emerged as the highest risk factor for severe COVID-19 (OR = 3.19; 95% CI = 1.70–6.01; P = 0.0003) and was a predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR = 2.35; 95% CI = 1.12–4.92; P = 0.02). Results from this study highlight the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on hospitalized AI/AN patients, who experienced more severe illness and associated mortality, compared to Hispanic and NHW patients, even when accounting for symptom onset and comorbid conditions. These findings underscore the need for interventions and resources to address health disparities in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nInfants with low birth weight (LBW) are more likely to have health problems than normal weight infants. In studies examining the associations between particulate matter (PM) exposures and LBW, there is a tendency to focus on PM2.5 as a whole. However, insufficient information is available regarding the effects of different components of PM2.5 on birth weight. This study identified the associations between maternal exposure to 10 metal components of PM2.5 and LBW in offspring based on small area (divided by population size) level data in New Mexico, USA, from 2012 to 2016. This study used a pruned feed-forward neural network (pruned-FNN) approach to estimate the annual average exposure index to each metal component in each small area. The linear regression model was employed to examine the association between maternal PM2.5 metal exposures and LBW rate in small areas, adjusting for the female percentage and race/ethnicity compositions, marriage status, and educational level in the population. An interquartile range increase in maternal exposure to mercury and chromium of PM2.5 increased LBW rate by 0.43% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.18-0.68%) and 0.63% (95% CI: 0.15-1.12%), respectively. These findings suggest that maternal exposure to metal components of air pollutants may increase the risk of LBW in offspring. With no similar studies in New Mexico, this study also posed great importance because of a higher LBW rate in New Mexico than the national average. These findings provide critical information to inform further epidemiological, biological, and toxicological studies.\n\nMenopause results from the decline of estrogen levels and is driven by ovarian aging. Some tissues, including the lung, may contribute to local estrogen synthesis in the postmenopausal state. Cigarette smoking is the most established factor for early menopause, and previous studies have shown that the menopause transition accelerated age-related decline of lung function following a restrictive disease pattern. In addition, studies have supported a potential synergistic effect of cigarette smoking and menopause on lung function. Delineating the effect of menopause timing and estrogen exposure on subsequent disease development may have important benefits for health maintenance and disease prevention in older women. This study aimed to assess the associations between early menopause and lung biomarkers, lung cancer risk, and cause-specific mortality. Data were obtained from the Pittsburg Lung Screening Study, a community-based research cohort of current and former smokers screened with low-dose computed tomography (CT) at baseline and 1 year later. Menstrual and reproductive history and data on respiratory symptoms were collected through questionnaires. Radiographic emphysema score was calculated from the baseline CT scan. Early menopause was defined as age at menopause of <45 years. The study cohort included female Pittsburg Lung Screening Study participants who reported natural (n = 1038) or surgical (n = 628) menopause at study entry. A total of 1064 participants (63.9%) were current smokers with an average pack-years of 46.1 ± 19.8 at baseline. Early menopause was associated with several pathologies including self-reported wheezing (odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18–2.30; P < 0.01), chronic bronchitis (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.19–2.53; P < 0.01), cardiovascular diseases (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.13–3.11; P = 0.02), radiographic emphysema (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.25–2.31; P < 0.001), and incident airway obstruction (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.03–3.96; P = 0.04) in women with natural menopause, but not surgical menopause except for physician-diagnosed cardiovascular diseases (OR, 4.03; 95% CI, 1.78–9.14; P < 0.001). Trend tests for each of these outcomes in women with natural menopause identified monotonically increasing risk associated with younger age at menopause. Early menopause was associated with lower measurements of the lung function measurements forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ; −104.8 ± 36.7 mL/s; P < 0.01), forced vital capacity (FVC; −78.6 ± 38.2 mL; P = 0.04), and FEV 1 -to-FVC ratio (−2.1% ± 0.8%; P = 0.01) at baseline in women with natural menopause but not surgical menopause. The use of hormone therapy at any point was associated with higher baseline FEV 1 levels and higher FEV 1 -to-FVC ratio at baseline among women with natural menopause. Early natural menopause was associated with a 40% increased risk of all-cause death with respiratory diseases (hazard ratio [HR], 2.32; 95% CI, 1.52–3.52; P < 0.001), and early menopause was associated with twice the risk of lung cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.05–3.58; P = 0.03). This association was exacerbated by continuous cigarette smoking, with HRs of 4.65 (95% CI, 2.55–8.49; P < 0.001) and 4.61 (95% CI, 2.63–8.07; P < 0.001) for lung cancer and cancer mortality, respectively, among continuous smokers with early menopause compared with women with noncontinuous smoking and nonearly menopause. The results of this study demonstrate that among a postmenopausal cohort of middle-aged and older smokers, natural early menopause is associated with worse lung health and accelerated lung aging."
