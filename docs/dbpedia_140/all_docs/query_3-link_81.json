        "text": "Mong Shi of Pingbian county, Yunnan province, China, many of whose speakers also self-identify as Mong Leng, is a member of the Mong Leng cluster within the Farwestern Hmongic branch of West Hmongic (of the Hmong-Mien language family). This paper presents the phonology and lexicon of Mong Shi as recorded from the idiolect of a single elderly speaker. The speaker retains a couple of phonological features which are rapidly becoming lost to the wider community and may perhaps only survive in the present account. After a preface the phonology is first discussed, followed by a comparison of Mong Shi with her sister Mong Leng (also known as Mong Njua) and two other Farwestern Hmongic varieties: the Chuan-Qian-Dian (CQD) standard and Hmong Daw (also known as White Hmong). A lexicon, comprising all of the field material with etymological notes and Hmong Daw cognates, follows on. The paper is primarily aimed at the Hmongist reader, especially the comparative/historical phonologist with an insatiable thirst for fresh dialectal minutiae. An attempt, nonetheless, has been made to render the text accessible to the general dialectologist, as well as, by the inclusion of orthographic forms alongside phonological representations, to the general lover of Hmong language and culture. Above all, the document has been written by way of tribute to the wonderful man that is our speaker.\n\nHmong Sa, a West Hmongic (Hmong-Mien) dialect with a very small population spoken in western Yunnan at the Myanmar border and across the northern part of Shan State, Myanmar, and within the past two decades also in Tak province of Thailand, is not only interesting in its own right but also offers an insight into the development of its big sister Mong Leng. This paper takes an initial look at Hmong Sa phonology, exposing a number of outstanding problems, before making a phonological comparison with three better known varieties of Farwestern Hmongic: Mong Leng/Mong Njua, the Chuanqiandian (CQD) standard, and Hmong Daw. This is followed by a lexicon encompassing all of the Hmong Sa material obtained in the field."
