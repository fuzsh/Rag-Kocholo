        "text": "The city of Hull has had a wealth of inspirational and brilliant women! Some were born here and others came and made their mark.\n\nDr Mary Murdoch was Hull’s first female GP, and more recently the new bridge on Castle Street, Murdoch’s Connection, was named after her.\n\nMadam Emily Clapham. When you think of haute couture, Savile Row, Paris or Milan might spring to mind, but for 80 years Hull was home to the salon of Madame Clapham, a redoubtable woman who’s work gained such renown that she was appointed as a royal dressmaker, and her garments became objects of desire among those in high society. Madame Clapham’s reputation soared between 1890 and the outbreak of World War One in 1914.\n\nEthelk Legiska one of the most talented musicians of the 20th century, was born ‘Ethel Liggins’ but took the name ‘Leginska’ in an era when the best top-class musicians had Polish- or Russian-sounding names. She became a pianist and became an accomplished conductor and conducted many of the world’s leading orchestras from the mid-1920s. This culminated in the founding of her own women’s orchestras. She also composed three operas and in 1935 was the first woman to conduct her own opera in a major opera house.\n\nMargaret Moxon (nee Kissling) a pioneering teacher from Hull.

Born Ada Vallinda Walsh, Sister Agnes joined the Daughters of Charity, serving in Ireland, Jerusalem and then France, where she ended during the war.

She is one of only 21 Britons to be recognized as such and to have her name inscribed on the memorial at Yad Vashem, and in 2010 she received British “hero of the Holocaust,” an award created by Gordon Brown, the then prime minister.\n\nEleanor Rollit Born into a wealthy shipbuilding family who later married Albert Kaye Rollit, a successful solicitor who eventually became President of the Law Society, and was later knighted. Eleanor was very involved with local charities, and was a great supporter and benefactor of the Sailor’s Orphanage as well as a patron of the training ship T.S. Southampton, that trained wayward boys and orphans in the basics of seamanship. Eleanor personally opened bank accounts with the Hull Savings Bank for the boys. When Eleanor became Lady Mayoress she extended her support for local charities and good causes. She was also very active in the early women’s suffrage movement.\n\nLillian Bilocca, Yvonne Blenkinsop, Mary Denness and Christine Jensen MBE. A group of four women dubbed the Headscarf Revolutionaries, who campaigned for trawler safety measures in the 1960s. Their campaign started when 58 fishermen lost their lives in the triple trawler tragedy of 1968, which saw three separate trawler sinking’s in the space of less than a month. The four women collected a 10,000-signature petition calling for reform, led protest meetings and lobbied politicians. Among the measures the campaign won were safety checks before vessels left port, radio operators for all ships, improved safety equipment and a “mother ship” with medical facilities for all fleets.\n\nAmy Johnson Pioneering Aviator born in Hull in 1903.
