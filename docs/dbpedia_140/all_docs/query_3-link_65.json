        "text": "John Shepard—later known throughout the galaxy as \"The Shepard\"—is a legendary N7 soldier in the Systems Alliance military, the first human Spectre, and the main protagonist of the Mass Effect trilogy. Born in Vancouver in 2154, he had a difficult childhood but was able to escape the life of petty crime and underworld gangs upon enlisting in the Alliance Navy.\n\nA decorated war hero, Shepard is a veteran of the Skyllian Blitz and served with distinction which earned him the Alliance's highest award, the Star of Terra, for almost single-handedly repelling an assault from batarian slavers on Elysium long enough for reinforcements to arrive. Following the battle, he is arguably considered one of the Alliance's most famous soldiers. By overcoming great challenges in the line of duty, Shepard has since shown exemplary talent and leadership capabilities which led to him to undergo N7 training in Rio de Janeiro. He later served as Executive Officer (XO) of the SSV Normandy SR-1 under the command of Captain David Anderson.\n\nDuring the Eden Prime War, he helped expose Saren Arterius for his involvement with the geth attack on Eden Prime. He also became friends with Kaidan Alenko, Ashley Williams, Garrus Vakarian, Urdnot Wrex, Tali'Zorah nar Rayya, and Dr. Liara T'Soni, who helped him uncover the existence of a race of ancient sentient machines known as Reapers. For his efforts, Shepard was appointed the first human Spectre and assumed command of the Normandy when Anderson was forced to step down. After witnessing Kaidan's sacrifice to destroy Saren's research facility during the mission on Virmire, Shepard continued to help lead the war effort against the geth and foil Saren's plans. Not long after, Williams, with whom Shepard had fallen in love, encouraged him to remain vigilant. Not long after, Shepard and his crew participated in the Battle of the Citadel. During the campaign, Saren was killed and the Reaper vanguard, Sovereign, was destroyed. Although widely praised for saving the Citadel from a surprise attack, his theories about the Reapers have caused political controversy and despite calls for him to cease his investigation, he continued to work tirelessly in an attempt to try to find a way to stop the new threat. Shortly thereafter, he was killed in action by the Collectors.\n\nTwo years later, he was brought back to life under the Lazarus Project by the pro-human syndicate known as Cerberus. With the assistance of the organization's enigmatic leader, the Illusive Man, Shepard assumed command of the Normandy SR-2 and a crew. With the help of his new teammates, Shepard set out on a mission to stop the Collectors' galaxy-wide campaign of human abductions as they worked in conjunction with the Reapers. Over the course of the journey, Shepard participated in the final assault on the Collectors' main base of operations accessible only through the Omega-4 Relay and managed to destroy their base, thus putting an end to the Collectors once and for all. Soon after the mission was completed, he severed all ties with Cerberus and operated independently over the next year. During this time, he helped Liara defeat the Shadow Broker. Shepard soon fell out of favor with the Alliance when he blew up the Bahak system and killed its 300,000 batarian colonists as collateral damage in an attempt to delay the Reapers from invading. As a consequence, he was relieved of duty and imprisoned at an Alliance military base on Earth to await trial.\n\nSix months later, however, the Reapers returned from dark space and began their next galaxy-wide invasion. Shepard was forced to escape Earth on the Normandy, but not before being re-instated into the Alliance military and being tasked with gathering help from other species to build an ancient superweapon dubbed the \"Crucible\". During the course, he successfully negotiated an alliance between the turians and krogan upon curing the genophage and ending the three-hundred-year conflict between the quarians and geth. Under Hackett and Shepard's leadership, the combined fleets of all the races of the galaxy launch a massive final attack on the Reapers orbiting Earth and on its surface in a last-ditch effort to retake the Citadel and use it to activate the Crucible. Through many hardships and even sacrifices, Shepard used the Crucible to destroy the Reaper threat and put an end to the 50,000-year cycle of extinction. Following the war, Shepard became a living legend, and was remembered as one of the most powerful soldiers in galactic history. Due to his injuries and plagued by survivor's guilt, Shepard resigned his commission in the Alliance military and withdrew from the public eye, though he would later contribute to the Citadel Council's reorganization into the Interstellar Republic and became one of its prominent leading figures. During this time, Shepard and Williams were married and had four children.\n\nBy 2196, Shepard was nominated by First Minister Linariley T’eavius and confirmed by the Senate, to serve as Minister of Defense. During the Great Galactic War, however, Linariley and most of her cabinet were killed when the yahg attacked the Citadel. Being the designated survivor, Shepard succeeded Linariley as First Minister. The following year, Shepard signed into law the Yahg Demilitarization and Confinement that ended the war and presided over another galaxy-wide recovery effort. He retired in January 2208 due to term limits and kept a low profile but was coaxed out of retirement to assist his son Kaidan in the final battle against the extra-galactic targarium species.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nBorn on April 11, 2154 in the city of Vancouver on Earth, John Shepard never knew his parents or any of his family that well, having been abandoned by them not long after his latent biotic abilities manifested, feeling that this was the type of punishment from a universe that obviously hated him and anything about him. When he turned six, Shepard found his freedom with the Tenth Street Reds, beginning a life of gang violence and turf wars. He was initiated into the gang and eventually participated in many gang wars and turf wars between rival factions. Despite trying to keep his distance, a gang member attempted to kill him after the violent battle. Finch and Julius Shaw saved him from his execution, with Finch killing the small-time hoodlum. Julius informs the gang that it is time to take the fight to the three rival gangs: Smoking Barrels, Pura Sapiens, and Venom Kick.\n\nFor years he pulled off petty crimes, robberies, even holding people at gunpoint. But it wasn't until one fateful night that caused Shepard to begin rethinking his decision: a robbery went wrong when he watched as one of his fellow gang members was gunned down by a store owner. When he fled the scene, he couldn't help but think to himself that could've been him. Shepard's youth was filled with violence and crime but sought a way to clear himself of his vile past and create a new future for himself, since his life in constant violence threatened to consume him.\n\nMilitary career[]\n\nBasic training[]\n\nOn his eighteenth birthday, Shepard enlisted in the Alliance Navy and came to celebrate his enrollment more than his birthday. After joining the military, Shepard boarded a shuttle that took him to the Macapá Training Camp in Brazil, one of the largest military training centers. There, he began his basic training under some of the toughest and most experienced combat drill instructors, such as Gunnery Chief Ellison. By the end of his basic training, Shepard graduated top of his class from the Alliance Naval Academy and took several weeks off to relax at a military base on Shanxi before boarding a shuttle for shore leave on Arcturus Station.\n\nThe Skyllian Blitz[]\n\nIn 2176, a young 22-year-old Shepard was stationed on Elysium during shore leave alongside a few other marines he graduated with. However, later that night, Shepard was woken up by an unexpected attack when the first wave of the Skyllian Blitz struck. A massive coalition of slavers, crime syndicates and batarian warlords, many of which were under the command of Elanos Haliat, led an attack on the colony in an attempt to gain prestige among the gangs of Omega. Nearly three hours in the structure, they began to make their escape, only to find the entire hotel was crumbling. Surviving the building's collapse, Shepard and other marines he had rounded up to initiate a counterattack against the overwhelming pirate forces.\n\nFrom courtyards to skyscrapers, Shepard became well-known among the citizenry, marines, and most importantly, the attacking mercenaries. Eventually, Shepard's attacks caught up with him and found himself, several marines and local militia surrounded by enemy forces. Shepard ordered the survivors to evacuate the civilians while preparing for the approaching 10,000 batarians, who easily outgunned and outnumbered him. Using the last supplies of ammunition and grenades, he laid waste to a large number of the enemy forces, but eventually found his weapons empty. In a last-ditch effort, Shepard engaged in hand-to-hand combat to ravage the remaining forces, until eventually the building collapsed; his demise was greatly expected. Astoundingly, he succeeded in eliminating the first wave of enemy troopers before reinforcements arrived.\n\nHaliat's plans came to nothing as the Alliance repelled the Blitz and decimated the pirate ships from orbit. The Terminus pirates blamed Haliat for the Blitz's failure, and he lost his position as their leader. He then retreated to a remote world in disgrace. News later reached Shepard that the soldiers under his command and the colonists made it out alive. Meanwhile, Shepard was recognized among the Alliance and galactic society, with a bright future. He received several accommodations, medals, and awards (including the Star of Terra) for his participation in the battle. The following year, he was accepted into Officer Candidate School and promoted, although he was already recognized as one of the best soldiers in the Alliance military.\n\nN7 commendation[]\n\nBecause of his actions during the Skyllian Blitz, Shepard was recommended by the Alliance brass to undergo N7 training at the Interplanetary Combatives Academy in Rio de Janeiro. The aspiring lieutenant received the \"N\" military vocational code rating, being one of 300 out of 750 to graduate.\n\nEden Prime War[]\n\nShakedown run[]\n\nIn the year 2183, with numerous achievements under his belt, Shepard was named Executive Officer (XO) of the SSV Normandy SR-1, an advanced prototype Alliance stealth frigate, under the command of his close personal friend and mentor, Captain David Anderson. On board, Captain Anderson is in discussion with Admiral Steven Hackett and Ambassador Donnel Udina concerning Commander Shepard's worthiness to become the first human Spectre, an elite agent for the Citadel Council. Meanwhile, the ship and crew are heading to the human colony of Eden Prime in the Utopia system for their shakedown mission. Everything began to move in a positive direction.\n\nHowever, everything changed when they intended to make a covert pick up on Eden Prime. Shepard heads to the bridge where Joker, the pilot, guides the ship into the mass relay. Because of the presence of Nihlus Kryik, a turian Spectre sent by the Council to observe, and the famed Captain Anderson, several members of the crew think their true purpose at Eden Prime is far more important than a simple shakedown run. After making the jump, Captain Anderson asks for Shepard to come to the communications room for a briefing.\n\nNihlus has time to speak to Shepard before Anderson joins them. Together, they inform the commander that a Prothean beacon has been discovered on Eden Prime. Prothean technology has immense scientific value, but since Eden Prime is close to the Terminus Systems, the beacon is at risk from pirates and mercenary bands. This is the Normandy's true objective: recover the beacon. This mission will also be Nihlus' chance to observe Shepard in action, the first of several they will undertake together to assess Shepard's candidacy for the Spectres.\n\nThe briefing is interrupted by a transmission from Eden Prime that Joker patches through. The footage shows Alliance soldiers fighting on the surface, under heavy fire and requesting reinforcements. As Shepard, Anderson and Nihlus watch, they see a huge dreadnought hanging over the surface before the feed goes into static. Anderson orders Shepard to get ready — this is going to be worse than they thought.\n\nAttack on Eden Prime[]\n\nAs the Normandy touches down on Eden Prime, Corporal Richard Jenkins, Staff Lieutenant Kaidan Alenko and Commander Shepard prepare to head down to the planet. Nihlus is going groundside too but goes on ahead. In the first few minutes on the surface, geth assault drones appear without warning and cut down Jenkins. Shepard and Alenko continue towards the dig site, discovering one of the few surviving marines, Gunnery Chief Ashley Williams, who is being chased by geth troopers and recon drones. Shepard and Alenko help her fight them off. Williams can't explain why the geth are here, but they've wiped out her whole unit.\n\nWilliams leads them to the dig site, but the beacon has been moved to the spaceport. While they examine the nearby camp, the squad ran into a group of Husks, human corpses reanimated by the geth, which they kill. Shaken, they continue towards the spaceport where Nihlus agreed to meet with them. Unfortunately, by the time they arrived, he was found dead.\n\nAfter finding Nihlus' body, Shepard's team continues to the tram area where they defeat the last of the geth and disarm their demolition charges. Shepard sees the beacon and calls the Normandy while Alenko and Williams take a look at it. One of them gets too close and is caught in some sort of field — Shepard intervenes and throws Williams out of the way but is caught in the field instead, pulled off the ground as Saren was. The commander suffered a horrific vision: synthetics waging a terrible war before the beacon exploded and Shepard was thrown to the ground, unconscious.\n\nFirst human Spectre[]\n\nFifteen hours after the Eden Prime attack, Shepard wakes up in the Normandy's medical unit, much to the relief of Alenko and Williams. Dr. Karin Chakwas says the commander is physically okay but has increased rapid eye movement and unusual beta waves, indicating psychological trauma. Shepard mentions the vision but can't explain it. Captain Anderson briefs Shepard about Saren. He is a powerful and legendary Spectre but also outspoken against humans. If Saren is in charge of the geth, that means he has gone rogue, and they must tell the Council. Upon arriving at the Citadel, Ambassador Udina tries to convince the Council to remove Saren's rights and privileges as a Spectre, but only succeeds in getting an audience. Shepard, along with Alenko and Williams, continues to the Citadel Tower and meets Garrus Vakarian, a turian C-Sec officer investigating the charges against Saren. He hasn't found anything useful: Saren's Spectre status makes him untouchable.\n\nThe Council audience doesn't go well. The Alliance has little evidence and Saren—viewing the proceedings from a hologram—openly laughs at Shepard's vision. They need more to go on. Garrus, the C-Sec officer, might be able to help. Udina tells Shepard to find Harkin, a suspended C-Sec officer who could help them find Garrus. Anderson also suggests speaking to Barla Von, a financial expert on the Citadel who works for the Shadow Broker. When Shepard heard Garrus was last seen in the Med Clinic, the commander intercepts a couple of thugs threatening Dr. Chloe Michel and saves her with Garrus' help. From the two of them, Shepard learns that a quarian has recently arrived on the Citadel, claiming to have evidence of Saren's connection to the geth. However, this quarian is being held captive by Fist, a local crime lord who used to work for the Shadow Broker, but who's now betrayed the Broker to work for Saren.\n\nAlong with Garrus, the group gains the aid of Urdnot Wrex, a krogan battlemaster, mercenary and bounty hunter who has been sent by the Shadow Broker to kill Fist. They raid Chora's Den and discover the quarian was supposed to hand the information over to the Shadow Broker, but this meeting is a trap. Saren's men will be the ones waiting. Shepard races to the meeting and manages to save the quarian, Tali'Zorah nar Rayya. They bring Tali back to the Ambassador's office.\n\nThe evidence she found was an audio file she managed to save from a geth memory core, which has clear evidence Saren was behind the attack on Eden Prime. However, the file also hints that Saren is looking for something called the Conduit with the aid of a powerful asari called Matriarch Benezia, to bring about the \"return of the Reapers\". When the evidence is presented to the Council, Saren's Spectre status was revoked, but they're reluctant to send a fleet after him to apprehend him. No interest is shown in the Reapers.\n\nAs people in the Chambers watch in amazement, Commander Shepard becomes the first human Spectre and is tasked with hunting Saren down. Captain Anderson steps down as commander of the Normandy and hands the ship over to Shepard, along with some useful leads. There have been reports of geth activity on the planets Noveria and Feros. Also, Matriarch Benezia, Saren's ally, has a daughter named Dr. Liara T'Soni, a Prothean expert who may have useful information. Shepard was furious, feeling that Anderson was being forced out of office but eventually came to accept the sacrifice. After giving the crew a speech, Shepard is now in command of the Normandy.\n\nSearch for Dr. Liara T'Soni[]\n\nThe Normandy tracks Dr. Liara T'Soni to Therum, a mining colony in the Knossos system of the Artemis Tau cluster, but the geth are already on the surface, taking over several refinery facilities and dropping Geth Armatures from overhead.\n\nShepard led the squad to a mineshaft and down into a Prothean ruin, where they find Liara trapped behind a Prothean barrier curtain, who explains that she tried to protect herself from the geth but must have pressed something she wasn't supposed to and pleads for assistance to get out. Freeing her with a mining laser, they discover she is not in league with Saren and has no idea what the Conduit might be. Liara also warned them that there are more geth being led by a krogan. Then a tremor is felt in the mine. The ruins were not entirely stable, and the mining laser must have triggered a seismic event, prompting Shepard to tell Joker to get the Normandy over the ruins as quickly as he can make it. As the squad leaves the ruined tower with Liara, they are confronted by a krogan battlemaster who is leading the geth and manage to defeat him as the unstable ruins begin to collapse. They escape just in time.\n\nJoker welcomes Shepard and the squad back to the Normandy with more than a bit of sarcasm. During the debriefing, Liara explains her expertise is on the Prothean extinction. She has a theory they were not the first civilization to mysteriously vanish and is amazed by Shepard's story of the Reapers and offers to link her mind with Shepard's to try to make sense of the vision from Eden Prime. The joining doesn't produce any results and Liara gets tired. Shepard dismisses the crew and reports his mission to the Council.\n\nNoveria[]\n\nNext, Shepard and his team headed to Noveria, hoping to find Matriarch Benezia herself. Noveria's capital of Port Hanshan did not treat him well upon arrival. Not only were they hesitant to let in an armed Spectre squad, but they wouldn't let him leave to investigate. Eventually Shepard had earned a few favors, collecting enough incriminating evidence that Administrator Bel Anoleis was corrupt to get him a garage pass. This allowed him to leave, but was ambushed by geth. After a brief firefight and a warning to Port Hanshan Security, Shepard's squad set off.\n\nThe facility is deserted save for geth and bizarre creatures: the rachni, which have escaped from the labs. Shepard reactivates the Peak 15 station's virtual intelligence, Mira and goes up to Rift Station looking for Benezia. Rift Station is full of science staff sheltering from the rachni attack; Shepard helps them out but gets attacked by those loyal to Benezia. The squad finds out Binary Helix discovered a rachni egg that turned out to be a queen and were trying to breed an army from her brood until the rachni turned on them.\n\nDown in the labs through the maintenance area, Shepard finds Benezia with the Rachni Queen. The matriarch attacks the squad, but after a fierce battle Benezia manages to overcome the indoctrination that Saren has used to control her and tells Shepard the truth. Saren wants the location of the lost Mu Relay and sent her to retrieve it from the queen's genetic memory. Benezia doesn't know what else he is planning. She hands the coordinates over to Shepard but becomes lost to the indoctrination again and the commander has to kill her. Before they had the chance to leave though they were confronted by a corpse, it was under the control of the Rachni Queen. She questioned whether she would be killed or set loose; eventually Shepard made his decision and freed the queen, giving the rachni another chance, much to Wrex's chagrin. Their next step was to clear the facility of rachni and escape, and with some help they managed to succeed with help of the Neutron Purge, though they barely escaped in time.\n\nAsteroid X57 hostage crisis[]\n\nAt some point, a batarian extremist group hijacked a mobile asteroid station Asteroid X57 in the Asgard system and set it on a collision course with the nearby human colony of Terra Nova. The Normandy's computer alerts Shepard and the hand-picked crew that X57 is heading to Terra Nova too fast, and is on course to hit the planet within four hours. The crew then quickly rushes in to try to save the millions of innocent civilians before the asteroid completes its deadly descent.\n\nInside, Shepard and the squad encounter five batarian troopers, a batarian sniper, and a pack of four varren. The first two varren are dropped in a matter of minutes, with a second pair of war beasts released shortly after that – when a batarian shouted \"Release the varren!\" Once the batarians were cleared out, the group shuts down the fusion torch station and is again contacted by the unknown woman, Kate Bowman. She says batarian extremists have attacked the asteroid and doesn't know why the batarians are here, but they've killed many of the personnel on the asteroid. However, she signs off before she's discovered. As Shepard leaves the fusion torch station, he's shot by a nervous Simon Atwell; however, his shields deflect the shot. Simon gives Shepard as much information about the asteroid, Kate, and the batarian attack. Simon reveals that the asteroid is going to crash into Terra Nova and cause catastrophic damage – not only will it destroy the colony and kill everyone on the surface, but the devastation will effectively kill the planet. When implied about why the batarians are doing this, Simon responds that they're pirates and slavers, not planet killers, and doesn't know why they changed from just a slave grabbing run to killing the planet, but he has a warning: the next torch station is surrounded by live blasting caps and that three of his engineers are missing. Simon also says that the batarian leader is named Balak but doesn't understand why the batarians are doing this.\n\nDisabling the second fusion torch, Shepard gets another message over the radio from Kate Bowman, saying that the batarians know someone's shutting down the torches and, to make things worse, intend to blow up the main facility. Before she can finish, the batarian leader Balak pulls her away.\n\nWhen the third and final fusion torch is shut down, Shepard encounters Charn, Balak's second-in-command, who tries to negotiate, claiming that he and his men had only signed on for a simple slave grab, not to destroy a colony. He is under orders to kill Shepard but he's getting tired of following Balak's little crusade. Shepard convinces Charn to leave the asteroid peacefully, under the promise that Balak will be eliminated and Charn will then be the one calling the shots. In that event, Charn agrees immediately and provides Shepard with a pass to the main facility along with a warning that Balak is a \"mean bastard\".\n\nWhen the Commander launches an assault on the main facility, Shepard confronts Balak, who has planted a bomb in the offices where the hostages are being held. He is furious that the torches have been shut down and sees this as an act of reprisal for the early stages of humanity's major expansion in the Skyllian Verge, claiming territories and resources he believes should have belong to the batarians, all because the Council saw a military advantage in befriending the Alliance. Balak talks angrily about the thwarted Skyllian Blitz and holds Shepard personally responsible for the Blitz's failure and accuses him of murdering batarians on Torfan, saying what he's doing is no different. Shepard rebuffs this notion, retorting that the batarians attacked first and when the Alliance retaliated, the batarians \"ran like cowards\". Out of patience, Balak reveals that the hostages are locked away in a room with an explosive that he's prepared to detonate, unless the Commander offers him safe passage out of the building and off the asteroid.\n\nFaced with a choice of letting Balak and risk him causing havoc in the future but save the hostages or attack him knowing the hostages will be sacrificed, Shepard begrudgingly let Balak go to save the hostages, though he warned the batarian that the next time he causes trouble, he'll be ready for him. Disarming the three explosive charges around the room while under fire, the hostages were spared. Once freed from one of the offices, Shepard finally meets Kate Bowman, who is glad to be alive but devastated at the death of her brother and colleagues. Kate realizes she never even asked the Commander's name, and claims Shepard isn't what she expected, but she's very grateful for the help.\n\nAfter the battle, Shepard meets Simon Atwell again, who is saddened by Balak's escape. He confirms that Shepard's efforts were not in vain: the asteroid was on a direct course for Terra Nova's capital, and now that the torches have been disabled, X57 will miss the planet safely.\n\nFeros[]\n\nDrawn to Feros by rogue geth activity, Shepard and the squad arrive at the colony of Zhu's Hope, owned by ExoGeni Corporation. The colony has been suffering repeated geth attacks and the settlers there are acting strangely. Shepard clears the geth for the colonists and takes a Mako along the Prothean Skyway to the main geth base. The squad finds a small group of colonists who have become separated from the others, led by Juliana Baynham and a nervous ExoGeni representative, Ethan Jeong. Despite their situation these survivors seem to be coping better than Zhu's Hope. Before they leave, Juliana asks Shepard to look for her daughter Lizbeth, whom she believes to be still inside ExoGeni Headquarters.\n\nAfter making their way inside the ExoGeni Headquarters, Shepard's squad finds Lizbeth, scared but alive. From the company VI, Shepard discovers that the corporation has been experimenting with a mind-controlling plant, the Thorian, and that Zhu's Hope is actually a testing ground for ExoGeni to study its abilities. Shepard disables the force fields that the geth have set up by knocking the geth dropship off the headquarters and returns to the Skyway group. Jeong has received word that ExoGeni wants Zhu's Hope purged. Shepard deals with Jeong and heads back to Zhu's Hope to find the Thorian.\n\nControlled by the Thorian, the colonists attack Shepard on sight. Some have been turned into Thorian Creepers. Shepard can use special gas grenades that instantly kill the creepers and harmlessly paralyzes the colonists, then descends beneath Zhu's Hope to find the Thorian. It is an enormous creature that looks nothing like a plant. It creates an asari clone to speak for it, but only to tell Shepard it's not interested in bargaining with \"meat\". After battling waves of Thorian Creepers and clones, Shepard manages to destroy the Thorian's neural nodes and it falls to its death.\n\nAn asari emerges from a Thorian pod and manages to explain what happened. Shepard learns that Saren sacrificed his asari ally, Shiala, to the Thorian to gain the Cipher. This is the cultural and ancestral experience of the Protheans, which is necessary to understand the vision that the Eden Prime beacon put in time to adjust, the vision will make more sense and hopefully lead them to the Conduit before Saren.\n\nVirmire[]\n\nWith Feros and Noveria out of the way, Shepard is contacted by the Council with a possible lead: a salarian Special Tasks Group espionage team on Virmire, investigating reports of Saren's activities, has sent a mission-critical transmission that was almost lost in static. Shepard heads to Virmire and meets the leader of the salarians, Captain Kirrahe. They have found a breeding facility for krogan that Saren is using to create an army.\n\nKirrahe, realizing he's not getting the reinforcements he needs, asks for Shepard's help destroying it and they develop a plan: while the salarians distract Saren's geth, Shepard will take a team around the back and plant a nuclear device that will wipe out the facility. Conflict arose when Urdnot Wrex pressed to know how Saren was breeding an army and came close to turning traitor when everyone agreed that the base must be destroyed. Kirrahe asks Shepard for a squad member to help him coordinate the attack—to which Ashley volunteers to help the salarians, but must also deal with Wrex, who is furious that Shepard is willing to destroy a cure for the genophage, a salarian bioweapon which makes krogan breeding next to impossible. Using his calming tone, Shepard managed to talk down the infuriated krogan, assuring him that he did not want to destroy the cure either, but cured krogan under Saren's command are still slaves but only of a different disease. When Wrex finally calmed down and agreed to help Shepard, everyone was in awe that nobody expected he could talk down a krogan.\n\nAs Shepard's \"Shadow\" team worked their way into Saren's base, they took down numerous support structures, relieving pressure for the STG squads. When they eventually got inside, they were shocked at what they found, everywhere they looked was indoctrinated salarians and prison cells. After a while of exploration, Shepard had found another Prothean beacon buried in the facility. After the use of the beacon, everything began to make sense to Shepard, the meaning of the visions and even some aspects of Saren's plan and they are confronted by a hologram of Sovereign itself, which is not a Reaper ship but an actual Reaper. After a brief back and forth of threats, Shepard realized the true danger that the galaxy was in: Saren wasn't the real threat, it was the Reapers and Sovereign was the first of many. They began to pick up the pace considerably, Joker had contacted them saying that Sovereign was heading back to Virmire.\n\nShepard manages to get the nuke set up across the facility only to get a call that the salarians are being attacked and are taking heavy losses. The commander takes a group to help them but as they leave, the geth start attacking the nuke site and Shepard was put in a conflict: both Kaidan and Ashley are in trouble and there's no time to save both. Halfway there Shepard had to make a difficult decision, Williams and the STG team was getting demolished by geth, but the geth were now also assaulting the bomb site. After having to listen to a drawn-out fight over the comms between Williams and Alenko, Shepard had to choose, and he could only save one. Knowing that Alenko was the only survivor by the bomb site, and that he would die to see the bomb detonate, Shepard headed towards Williams, hoping he still had time to save her and the salarian team. Shepard brings reinforcements, only to be confronted by Saren. He tries to make the commander join his cause but Shepard refuses and fights Saren off. Saren gets away and the team board the Normandy, escaping Virmire as the nuke destroys the facility, leaving Kaidan behind to die in the explosion.\n\nStealing the Normandy[]\n\nShepard took his time to grieve for the loss of his friend, and thanks to the undamaged beacon on Virmire, his Prothean vision is now complete. During the debriefing, Liara touches Shepard's mind to interpret it fully. The vision was a distress call intended to warn the Protheans about the Reapers. Liara realizes that the landmarks in the vision are on Ilos, a planet she has studied as part of her Prothean research. Ilos had been impossible to reach because it was only accessible through the Mu Relay, which is why Saren needed the Relay's location from Noveria. After the debriefing, Joker passed on a message for Shepard from the Council: they're putting together a massive multi-species effort to face Saren.\n\nThrilled that the Council was finally taking this seriously, Shepard returns to the Citadel, wanting to personally lead the assault. But once back at the station, he discovers the Council was only putting up a blockade around the mass relays to stop Saren from reaching the Citadel. Neither they nor Ambassador Udina believe his story about the Reapers, and they refuse to send a fleet to Ilos. The Mu Relay is in the Terminus Systems and a Citadel fleet there could start a war. Shepard knows the Normandy's stealth systems can get them there discreetly, but the Council was getting tired of Shepard's insistence that the Reapers are the real threat. Udina, wanting to make nice with the Council, grounds the Normandy and locks out the ship's systems and closes all official diplomatic channels.\n\nFrustrated, knowing Saren is close to finding the Conduit and they're losing time, Shepard is grateful when Ashley offers support. A real breakthrough comes when Captain Anderson gets in touch, asking Shepard for a discreet meeting at Flux. Anderson believes the commander's story and knows the Normandy is the only ship that can get Shepard to Ilos. He is going to unlock the Normandy's systems, allowing Shepard to steal the ship and take her to Ilos. Shepard is concerned that Anderson will be arrested and charged with treason—or worse—but Anderson sees his future as a small price to pay for stopping genocide on a galactic scale.\n\nShepard goes to the Normandy and waits with Joker on the bridge. With Anderson's help, the Normandy's systems are unlocked, and they escape the Citadel, heading to Ilos. While en route to their destination, Ashley comes to visit Shepard's quarters, saying that, after a long career of being sidelined by the Alliance, Shepard helps her to feel \"good enough\", and the two spend the night together. Joker then announces that they're about to pass through the Mu Relay, and they will soon arrive at Ilos. Ashley continues to tease Shepard; she claims to have something important to tell him, but if he wants to hear it, he'll have to survive the mission and come back to her first.\n\nIlos[]\n\nShepard sees that Saren has already arrived with a fleet of geth dropships, though the Normandy's stealth system is keeping them safe for now. Executive Officer Charles Pressly picks up some readings on the planet confirming Saren's presence. However, they could not find a landing zone. Shepard suggests dropping the Mako, but they need about 100 meters of open terrain for a safe drop and Pressly can only find at most 20 meters. Joker insists that he can do it. The Mako is successfully dropped outside an ancient bunker, but Saren and his geth have already made it inside, shutting a heavy security door behind them.\n\nShepard looks for ways to get to the other side of the bunker doors. After fighting through the geth left on guard, Shepard and the squad find a security station and reopen the bunker doors. While in the control room, Shepard discovers an ancient Prothean recording which is heavily damaged. The Cipher allows Shepard to make out some of the words — it's another warning about the Reapers but it's just too broken up. They return to the Mako and enter the bunker.\n\nAfter driving past cryogenic stasis pods, all apparently shut down, Shepard sees a mysterious energy barrier. As the Mako reaches the barrier, another barrier appears behind them, trapping the squad inside. The only way out is through a door at the side of the wall. After heading down an elevator, Shepard finds an ancient Prothean VI named Vigil, who has information Shepard needs to stop the Reapers.\n\nVigil unveils a startling revelation. The Citadel is actually a trap; a huge mass relay linking to dark space, outside of the galaxy, where the Reapers are waiting. The keepers are presumed to be one of the earliest races to be indoctrinated by the Reapers, who set them the task of maintaining the Citadel and activating the Citadel Relay when Sovereign signals them. It is also revealed that Sovereign is the vanguard of the Reapers. After every Reaper attack, they leave behind one of their kind to act as a vanguard and to monitor the development of the galaxy's races. Once the galaxy's races are sufficiently advanced, the vanguard will activate the Citadel Relay and usher in the next genocide. The reason the Reapers harvest the galaxy of all advance organic life approximately every 50,000 years is currently unknown. According to Vigil, not even the Prothean scientists could comprehend why they do it. They may be driven by goals that organics find impossible to understand. Once the galaxy is harvested, the Reapers return to dark space to hibernate and conserve energy. In this state, they are apparently vulnerable, so they always seal the Citadel Relay behind them.\n\nWhen the Reapers last attacked about 50,000 years ago, their genocide of the Protheans lasted for centuries. Ilos' personnel hid in cryogenic stasis, watched over by Vigil. However, as his energy reserves ran low, he followed a contingency plan by shutting off pods of non-essential personnel to conserve energy, hoping that when the time was right, he could safely open the pods. In the end, Vigil managed to save a dozen scientists. The few remaining Protheans on Ilos traveled to the Citadel through the Conduit—a small prototype mass relay, built by the Protheans, enabling a one-way link from Ilos to the Relay Monument in the Citadel Presidium. The survivors altered the signal that the keepers respond to and prevented them from activating the relay to dark space. Vigil also explains that if Sovereign assaults the Citadel alone, the combined power of the Citadel Fleet would be enough to defeat the single Reaper. However, if Sovereign is able to direct an agent to go through the Conduit as a back door and transfer control of the Citadel back to Sovereign, it will be able to manually activate the Citadel Relay and bring in the rest of the Reapers. Sovereign had possibly planned this for centuries after discovering the Protheans' sabotage plan. Vigil gives Shepard a data file that will give the commander temporary control of the Citadel to stop Sovereign. After leaving Vigil, Shepard heads through the archives, down into an old aqueduct guarded by geth, and reaches the Conduit. Saren had already gone through, leaving geth to stay guard.\n\nMeanwhile, Sovereign begun its assault on the Citadel, escorted by a large geth fleet. The commander of the Destiny Ascension, Matriarch Lidanya, attempts to close the Citadel but the station doesn't respond—the operators at Citadel Control are dead. Saren has begun his attack from within.\n\nBack on Ilos, Shepard sees the Conduit is closing fast. Rushing to the Conduit, the squad evades the geth in the process and drives the Mako through, just before the relay closes. On the now-burning and heavily damaged Presidium, two geth troopers notice a blue glow around the Relay Monument. When they go to take a look, the Mako suddenly bursts through and crushes them, before rolling over and crashing against a wall. The race to stop Saren was on.\n\nBattle of the Citadel[]\n\nShepard and the team manage to get out of the overturned Mako and use the nearby malfunctioning Avina terminal to get a sit rep. Saren is heading toward the Council Chambers and the whole station is infested with geth. The squad tries taking the elevator to the Citadel Tower, but it stops halfway when Saren locks down the station's systems. Shepard tells the team to suit up and blows out the elevator's glass with a single shot. They have to walk the rest of the way in zero gravity with their boots magnetized.\n\nMeanwhile up in the Chambers, Saren — angrily shooting keepers as he goes — reaches the central console and uses it to take control of the Citadel. As Sovereign gets closer, crushing the Citadel Fleet ships in its path, Saren closes the Wards, creating an impenetrable shell around the Reaper and the Geth Dropships already inside. Sovereign settles on top of the Citadel Tower, preparing to open the Citadel Relay once Saren has transferred full control.\n\nElsewhere Shepard and the team are fighting for their lives against the geth and Saren's krogan warriors out on the Citadel's exhaust plains, trying to get to the Chambers. A geth dropship appears and starts unleashing shock troopers on them; Shepard activates the Citadel's defense turrets, and with their cover fire, takes the dropship out. Further along they run into several powerful geth turrets and have to use cover to get close enough to destroy them or manage to sneak down a side route where Krogan Battlemasters are waiting. Eventually they reach a maintenance hatch that leads down into the Council Chambers, now burning and full of Saren's geth. The stairways provide some cover as the team fights towards the central console.\n\nAt that moment, Saren appears and throws a grenade. Shepard's team is blown aside while the commander takes cover close to Saren. He urges Shepard not to be a fool—everything is lost if Shepard continues resisting Sovereign. Saren boasts that his faith faltered but Sovereign has implanted him, made him partly synthetic, perfect. This is the future of organic life. Shepard couldn't believe Saren allowed Sovereign to implant him. Shepard tries talking Saren down—and the more Shepard speaks, the more Saren is convinced, but his Reaper implants cause the turian intense pain when he begins to agree with Shepard. With enough convincing, Saren thanks the commander for freeing him before shooting himself in the head, falling to the bottom of the Chambers, through the glass floor and is impaled by a large shard.\n\nUsing the central console, Shepard uploads Vigil's program and gains control of the Citadel. With advice from the team, Shepard opens a communication channel and gets Joker, who has the Fifth Fleet just waiting for the commander's word once the mass relays are unlocked. Shepard orders the Fifth Fleet to defend the Destiny Ascension and save the Council. After the orders were given, Joker brings the fleet through the nearby mass relay as Shepard opens the Citadel's ward arms.\n\nAs the Fleet engages the ships outside—geth dropships and Sovereign itself—Shepard tells the squad to check Saren and make sure he's dead. They drop down to the bottom of the Chambers—one coldly shoots Saren in the head, while the other confirms the kill to Shepard. Suddenly Saren's body begins to twitch as his implants fire up, burning his flesh away until he is a cybernetic construct like a husk, completely possessed by Sovereign. The shockwaves from his transformation cause the platform to collapse and Shepard falls into the bottom of the Chambers. The squad fights back against the creature, but it is fast and deadly.\n\nOutside, the Normandy leads the attack against Sovereign. The Reaper unleashes a terrible weapon that burns through several Alliance ships, but the Fifth Fleet slowly begins to gain the upper hand. As the squad finally destroyed the cybernetic creature and it burns away to ashes, Sovereign begins to weaken under the Alliance attack and releases its grip on the station. A blast from the Normandy is the coup de grace and the Reaper is destroyed.\n\nIn the Chambers, Shepard looks up to see a huge piece of debris from the Reaper heading straight for the Tower. The commander yells for the squad to take cover, just as it hits.\n\nMuch later, rescuers enter the Tower looking for survivors. Under a pile of rubble, they discover Shepard's team... two of them, badly wounded but alive. Leading the rescuers, Captain Anderson helps them out, assures them that it's all right, and asks where Commander Shepard is. One of the squadmates looks sadly across the Chambers, where the Reaper debris has crashed into the floor. It would have crushed anyone standing under it. The rescue team helps the squad out of the Chambers, reluctantly believing Shepard died in the crash. Anderson looks back—to see someone moving. Commander Shepard, with a broken arm, managed to climb out from behind the debris and limp towards them, smiling.\n\nIn gratitude for the sacrifices of the Alliance Fleet and Shepard's help, the Council states that humanity has proved themselves worthy and grants them a Council seat. Shepard personally endorsed Captain Anderson to represent humanity on the Council, citing the need for leaders with the courage to stand up for what they believe in. When approached by Ambassador Udina, Shepard remarks that he thought the Citadel already had too many politicians and expressed his belief that Anderson would be perfect for the job, because he didn't want it. The victory and celebration were short-lived, however, as Shepard left the Citadel aboard the Normandy, intending to find a way to stop the Reaper invasion.\n\nDeath[]\n\nUnfortunately, only one month after the Battle of the Citadel, the Alliance sends Shepard to locate and destroy any remaining geth. While on patrol in the Amada system, the Normandy was sent into a sector where three ships were reported to have gone missing in the space of one month.\n\nAfter four days of fruitlessly searching for signs of geth activity, the Normandy is attacked by an unknown assailant. The ship suffers extensive damage, forcing the crew to evacuate via escape pods. Joker, the helmsman, refused the initial evacuation order believing he could still save the ship and continues to pilot despite the received damage to it and is rescued by Commander Shepard, who drags Joker out of his seat and into an escape pod. Before the commander can board the escape pod himself, however, the Normandy is attacked once again and a blast separated them just as Shepard managed to get Joker inside and is sent flying amidst a series of explosions, barely surviving the Normandy's destruction. However, the suit's pressure seals were compromised, sliced by debris and air vents out. Shepard asphyxiates and dies; the Commander’s body is seen entering the atmosphere of a nearby planet below.\n\nThe news spread quickly, and many people were saddened at the death of the first human Spectre. However, Shepard would not stay dead for long.\n\nCollector Crisis[]\n\nResurrection[]\n\nTwo years later, in an effort undertaken by Cerberus, Shepard was brought back to life and awakens in the year 2185 aboard a Cerberus space station, a research facility of Project Lazarus, which fell under attack by hacked security mechs. After the Commander aids Cerberus agents Miranda Lawson and Jacob Taylor in escaping, Shepard is taken to a headquarters of Cerberus and granted an audience with the Illusive Man, who explains that Shepard was revived and \"upgraded\" in return for the Commander's aid in combating a new threat in which human colonies have been attacked, their colonists deemed missing.\n\nDue to the ignorance and political red tape hampering both the Alliance and the Council, Cerberus is the only organization in a position to combat the threat, and Shepard reluctantly agreed to work with them to solve this threat, even though he didn't trust Cerberus or the Illusive Man.\n\nShepard and the team are dispatched to investigate the recently attacked colony of Freedom’s Progress, located in the Terminus Systems. There, the group encounters Tali'Zorah vas Neema, one of Shepard's former squad members, and discovers that the mysterious insect-like humanoid bipeds known as the Collectors were behind the attack and are responsible for the further abductions of other human colonies. Shepard reports this to the Illusive Man, who then places him in command of the Normandy SR-2, a larger second-generation ship modeled after the original Normandy SR-1. With the guidance of the Illusive Man, Shepard begins traveling across the galaxy to recruit a new team for what is assumed to be a suicide mission.\n\nMeanwhile, rumors of Shepard’s apparent survival have mixed concerns. Some would even think that Shepard is undercover investigating the colony disappearances.\n\nForming a new squad[]\n\nThe Illusive Man initially provides Shepard with four dossiers regarding potential recruits: a salarian scientist, a mysterious vigilante called Archangel, a krogan warlord, and a powerful but psychotic biotic. The salarian, Mordin Solus, is found on Omega and is working to stop a plague engineered by the Collectors but distributed throughout Omega by the vorcha. The vigilante Archangel is also on Omega, holding out on his own in a battle against three mercenary gangs: the Blood Pack, Blue Suns and Eclipse. After reaching Archangel's hideout, Shepard learns that Archangel is actually Garrus Vakarian, one of Shepard's previous squad members. Garrus is seriously injured while battling the mercenaries, and, although he is permanently disfigured, he survives and joins the team. The krogan warlord, Okeer, is found attempting to create the perfect krogan through unethical genetic research. When the warlord is killed, he leaves his creation, Grunt, under the care of Shepard. The biotic, Jack, revealed to be a woman, is also known as \"Subject Zero.\" Cerberus arranges for her to be purchased from the prison holding her; Shepard travels to the Purgatory prison ship. Once there, however, Shepard is betrayed by the warden as he attempts to capture Shepard for a bounty. Shepard manages to escape the trap and rescue Jack, who joins the team despite an initial distrust of Cerberus operatives.\n\nAfter the recruitment of the four squad mates, the Illusive Man reveals that a human colony called Horizon has come under Collector attack, and he dispatches the team in an attempt to save the colony. He also notes that one of Shepard's surviving crew members, Ashley Williams, is stationed at the colony to oversee the construction of massive defense towers. Shepard arrives with his team and battles the Collectors face-to-face; the group appears to have arrived too late as half of the colonists have already been taken away. Shepard's team is able to activate the colony's defense cannons and turn them on the Collector ship, which then flees the planet under heavy fire. Shepard later reunites with his former lover, who leaves feeling betrayed by Shepard working for Cerberus.\n\nAfter returning to the Normandy, it is revealed that the Illusive Man allowed the Collectors to attack Horizon by leaking a tip to the Alliance that Shepard is alive and working with Cerberus. The Collectors intercepted this message and attacked the colony. The Illusive Man suspected the Collectors were looking for Shepard or people connected to him. It soon becomes clear that the Collectors are targeting Shepard. He is provided with dossiers on three more potential recruits: an asari Justicar, a drell assassin, and Tali. Shepard finds the Justicar, Samara, on Illium. She joins the team after Shepard investigates the Eclipse mercenary group and its involvement in a murder. The drell assassin, Thane Krios, is also found on Illium and is in the midst of completing an assassination contract on Nassana Dantius. After learning of Thane's next target, Shepard fights resistances along the way to the top floor of the tower complex where the target is located. Shepard encounters Thane, who successfully dispatches his target and joins the team, as Shepard can provide him with a purpose. Tali was found on a geth-occupied quarian colony world, Haestrom, where she is researching the system's rapidly dying sun. After she is rescued from an immense geth force, she agrees to join Shepard's team.\n\nInvestigating the Collector Ship[]\n\nAlthough the Illusive Man had still been assisting Shepard as they both worked to stop the Collectors from further threatening human colonies, their relationship had clearly suffered since Horizon. The Illusive Man informs Shepard that a turian patrol engaged a Collector ship, and managed to disable it before being destroyed, and that the Normandy should take the opportunity to investigate the ship before the turians respond and find any data or technology that can help them on their mission. Upon boarding the ship, Shepard discovers many empty collector pods, as well as the bodies of dead human colonists, apparently subjected to various experiments by the Collectors. Shepard then discovers that the Collectors had also been experimenting on their own, with EDI saying that they appeared to be researching their own genetic similarity to humans. EDI's genetic analysis of the deceased Collectors reveals that they are in fact the long extinct Protheans, having been subjected to extensive genetic modification to alter them for the Reapers' purposes.\n\nAs Shepard proceeds deeper into the ship, Joker discovers that it is in fact exactly the same Collector vessel responsible for the attack on Horizon and the destruction of the original Normandy, which Shepard remarks is far too uncanny to be a coincidence. When Shepard's team reaches the center of the ship, they discover that it contains millions of empty pods, more than enough to hold every human in the Terminus Systems, thus indicating that their ultimate target must be Earth. Shepard is able to link EDI with the Collector ship's systems in order to search for any useful information, but she is quickly interrupted as she discovers that the ship is not disabled, and the Collectors have drawn the Normandy into a trap. EDI also reveals that the Illusive Man knew all along that the \"disabled\" Collector ship was a trap but still sent Shepard and the Normandy to the ship in order to gain information. Shepard and the squad fight their way out and escape from the ship on the Normandy before the Collector vessel can bring its weapons to bear.\n\nAfter escaping, Shepard confronts the Illusive Man, who admits to sending the Normandy into an obvious trap in order to gain information and says that it was necessary in order for the Collectors to believe they have the upper hand and telling Shepard about it would have tipped the Collectors off. This to Shepard was an unnecessary risk not only to him, but to the entire squad who went there. The Illusive Man countered that with Shepard's actions they had finally found the key to travelling to the Omega-4 Relay. After talking his way out of the argument, the Illusive Man reveals the data gathered by EDI has led to the discovery of the Collector's means of traversing the Omega-4 relay, an advanced Reaper IFF system. Furthermore, the Illusive Man showed no remorse, undermining Shepard's trust in him. EDI is also able to calculate the location of the Collector homeworld from their ship's navigational data, and reveals it to be within the galactic core, an extremely dangerous area, which likely accounts for the fact that no ships ever return from the other side.\n\nObtaining a Reaper IFF[]\n\nThe Illusive Man then reveals that Cerberus has located a derelict Reaper orbiting a remote planet, evidently destroyed millions of years beforehand, and sent a science team there to recover the device required to pass through the Omega 4 Relay—a Reaper IFF transponder. During the course of the investigation, Shepard discovers that the Cerberus science team members had all been killed before their arrival. Video logs left by the science team make it evident that even though the Reaper is no longer sentient or functional; the indoctrination effect that emanates from all Reapers is still present. The derelict ship automatically activates its shields, isolating Shepard's team from the Normandy and thus making their only means of escape to destroy the ship's power core, which is also powering the ship's latent mass effect fields and preventing it from plunging into the planet below. Battling their way through the husks on board, Shepard and the team are assisted by a single geth, somehow able to talk and also apparently friendly. Shepard and the team recover the IFF and fight to the core of the ship, where the mysterious geth assists them once again before being disabled. As the Reaper's core is destroyed, its shields disappear and Shepard's team is able to escape to the Normandy before crashing into the planet, along with the disabled geth. Following the mission, Shepard activated the geth, who is named Legion by EDI and joins the team against the Collectors.\n\nShortly after, Shepard departs with the recruited members on a shuttle towards their next mission as the Normandy prepares the IFF for testing in their absence. However, EDI discovers a hidden signal after activating the IFF, and realizes that the IFF is broadcasting the Normandy's position. This turns out to be another trap set by the Collectors, as their ship is able to surprise the Normandy with Shepard's entire team absent. Collectors board and seize control of the ship, and Joker is forced to give control of the ship over to its on-board AI, EDI—a potentially dangerous move. After successfully regaining control of the ship, EDI manages to pilot the Normandy away from the Collectors and rid the ship of all enemies, but the entire crew except Joker is taken by the Collectors. Upon returning to the ship, Shepard's hand is forced—the Commander decides to go through the Omega-4 relay immediately to rescue the Normandy crew members.\n\nBeyond the Omega-4 Relay[]\n\nEventually, Shepard decides to travel through the Omega-4 Relay. When he proceeds, the Normandy activates the Reaper IFF and engages the Omega 4 Relay. Upon exiting the far side of the relay, the Normandy appears in the midst of a vast debris field containing the wreckage of thousands of ships, presumably all destroyed attempting to traverse the relay. The Collectors have stationed automated defenses in the debris field known as Oculus, which the Normandy fights off. After defeating the Oculus and reaching the far side of the debris field, the Normandy discovers the Collector base, a giant space station orbiting a black hole. The Collector Cruiser is dispatched from the station, and the Normandy engages and destroys it, but as it explodes the blast cripples the ship and causing it to crash land on the outer surface of the base. Fortunately for the squad, due to the various upgrades applied to the ship over the course of the mission, the crew suffered no casualties and the ship sustained minor damage while fighting the Oculus and Collector Cruiser.\n\nOver the course of the rest of the mission, Shepard and the team enter the station and battle their way through the Collectors to the station's core, rescuing the surviving Normandy crew as they go. Upon reaching the heart of the station, they discover that the Collectors have been constructing a new human-like Reaper, made from the genetic material of the abducted humans and fused with the advanced technology of the Reapers. EDI hypothesizes that the Reapers attempted and failed to create a Prothean-Reaper, and instead enslaved them and turned them into the Collectors, and that they are now facilitating the Reaper equivalent of reproduction. EDI also guesses that due to its human appearance, Reapers are crafted to resemble the race from whose genetic material they are created. Shepard targets the weak supports of the contraption, which is in the very early stages of its construction, and it is seen collapsing into the lower confines of the area. Shepard then sets about with the plan to destroy the station.\n\nAt this point, the Illusive Man contacts Shepard and suggests that instead, use a radiation pulse be employed to kill all of the Collectors on board, but keep the station intact to allow Cerberus to research its technology. He notes that any information obtained from the Collector Base would be very valuable in the coming war against the Reapers, in addition to strengthening humanity's position in the galaxy against other races. Shepard refuses and decides to destroy the station, and Miranda, seeing the Illusive Man as a power-hungry madman, sides with Shepard over him and resigns from Cerberus, proving her loyalty to Shepard. After making the decision regarding the station's fate and initiating the countdown, the Human-Reaper resurfaces from the depths of the station and attacks Shepard's team. After Shepard and the team destroy the Reaper, the surviving squad members escape to the Normandy and leave.\n\nAboard the Normandy, Shepard contacts and converses for one last time with the Illusive Man, who is extremely angry with Shepard's idealism, saying he knew that Shepard would \"choke on the hard decisions\". He also asserts that the Collector technology could have been used to humanity's benefit, and claims that, given its goals, Cerberus is humanity. Shepard rebuffs the Illusive Man, who wasn't looking for his approval and informs him of his decision to leave Cerberus. The Illusive Man tries to dissuade the Commander, citing that it is because of him that Shepard is alive. Shepard then rudely terminates all communication, but not before promising that he’ll win the war against the Reapers without sacrificing humanity's soul.\n\nAs the Normandy undergoes repairs following the mission, little did the crew realize was that the Reapers had awakened from their hibernation in dark space and began their march towards the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nCampaign against the Shadow Broker[]\n\nAn investigation[]\n\nNot long after his newly acquired freedom, Shepard travels back to Illium to deliver intel to Liara. At first, Liara is seemingly delirious about the information for it appears to hint on the Shadow Broker's true location. In addition, the message contains information that Liara's former drell partner, Feron, is actually still alive and is probably being held hostage by the Shadow Broker. After a short conversation on the subject with the Commander, Liara leaves her office and tells Shepard to meet her at her apartment.\n\nUpon his arrival, the Commander witnesses that the apartment is under investigation by Illium police, led by Spectre Tela Vasir, who dismisses the cops as Shepard enters the apartment. In response to Shepard's question regarding the unexpected investigation, Vasir explains there has been an attempt on Liara's life. She tells the Commander that she is unsure of Liara's current location and that she was unsuccessful in finding any clues; she invites Shepard to further search the apartment for clues. Eventually, Shepard finds what appears to be a backup disk, which is then played by Vasir and the Commander. The disk is found to contain a recorded conversation between Liara and a salarian contact by the name of Sekat, who explains that he has managed to pinpoint the Shadow Broker's location and asks Liara to come to his office at Baria Frontiers in the Dracon Trade Center. Now that they have what they are looking for, Vasir and Commander Shepard travel to their next destination at Baria Frontiers.\n\nThe Truth[]\n\nJust as the team arrives at the Dracon Trade Center, the three floors of the building are taken out by a sudden explosion, presumably an attempt to prevent Liara from receiving the information sought from Sekat. Vasir suggests that the Commander and the squad proceed inside while she takes off to the roof in order to seal off the building from the top. As Shepard and the squad enter the building, they find it to be a chaotic mess with dead bodies and wounded civilians all over the place. Tela maintains contact with Shepard to guide the Commander through. As Shepard proceeds to the upper floors into the Baria Frontiers Office, the Commander finds a clue that Liara has just signed in a few minutes ago, confirming that Liara is indeed in the building. Proceeding inside the office room for further exploration, Shepard and the team are blinded by a flash grenade, followed by a wave of enemies who immediately scatter around the area and open fire. Shepard quickly radios Vasir regarding the ambush, who tells the Commander that they are the Shadow Broker's private army and confirms their presence in the building. With no choice to fall back, Shepard and the team return fire, slowly but surely making their way through the small hallways of the destroyed office.\n\nEventually, Shepard and the squad reach their destination, where they see Sekat's dead body after he was shot by a Shadow Broker agent, who is then shot by Vasir herself. Vasir asks the Commander about Liara's body, and if Shepard located it. However, Liara emerges from the shadows, wielding her pistol at Vasir. Liara explains to Shepard that Vasir tried to assassinate her, broke into her apartment, and is the one that signaled the Shadow Broker's agents. She also remarks that Vasir is the one who killed Sekat and took his data, which is currently in her possession, revealing that Vasir is, after all, an undercover Shadow Broker operative. Exposed, Vasir shatters the glass with her biotics and makes a run for it. Shepard tries to tackle Vasir before she jumps out the now-broken window but fails to do so, causing the Commander to fall to the floor while Liara proceeds to chase Vasir, not bothering to look back at Shepard and the squad. Shepard is then attacked by more enemies emerging from the nearby Eldfell-Ashland Energy office who attempts to slow down the Commander so that Vasir can get away. Shepard and the team continue to fight their way through the resistance while pursuing Vasir out of the building. When they exit the building, the team finds Liara exchanging fire with Vasir at the parking lot. It doesn't take long before Vasir calls her X3M skycar and quickly jumps into it to fly away. Nonetheless, Liara finds a nearby vehicle, which she and Shepard use to chase Vasir through the skies of Illium.\n\nAt the end of the chase, Shepard and Liara manage to catch Vasir, whose vehicle has crashed on the roof of the Azure Hotel. Although they don't actually have her yet, they can make their way to the other side of the roof where she most likely is. Coupled with the fact that Vasir is now wounded due to the crash and is thus slow, Shepard and Liara have a much better chance of capturing her this time. However, as the team lands and exits the vehicle, reinforcements arrive and start shooting at them. After the battle on the roof, Shepard and Liara continue running inside and emerge to the other side of the roof, where they spot Vasir's footsteps and follow them until they reach Vasir and aim their pistols at her, hoping she surrenders. Even though she is badly injured, Vasir grabs a random hostage to use as leverage against Shepard and Liara. The situation is quickly dealt with, and the hostage escapes, but Vasir, not about to give up just yet, starts attacking the squad with everything she has. At the end of the battle, Vasir drops to the floor, allowing Liara to pick up the data disk. Vasir protests to Shepard's remarks she sold out the Council, insisting she is nothing like Saren and claiming that the Shadow Broker is powerful and her work with him has helped save lives and kept the Citadel safe, and that she believes in sacrificing a few for the greater good. She also brings up the Commander's involvement with Cerberus and tries to judge Shepard for it, before she takes her last breath. Shepard then heads back to Liara, who is examining the disk, to have a conversation with her, which, among other things, involves the Shadow Broker's intention of wanting to kill Liara all along and at any cost. In any case, with the data in their possession, Shepard and Liara travel to the Shadow Broker's location for their primary objective.\n\nAssault on the Shadow Broker's Base[]\n\nThe data obtained reveals that the Shadow Broker settles on the planet Hagalaz, in the Sowilo system of the Hourglass Nebula. Specifically, the Shadow Broker lives onboard a massive ship that travels through the thick, erratic atmosphere of Hagalaz. Shepard, Liara, and a third squad member take the shuttle from orbit down to the planet. Liara provides Shepard with valuable input on the planet's atmosphere, the ship, and the general plan of the mission. First, they have to find a hatch that leads to the inside of the ship, where Feron is held. The shuttle lands, and Shepard and the team begin finding their way for a hatch to get inside. The weather is dreadful, and the layout of the ship's exterior isn't exactly easy to navigate through, but they proceed anyway. Shortly following their touchdown, the team is engaged by maintenance drones, which Liara presumes is because the drones think the team is debris from the storm. After that, troops from the Broker's army start coming and attacking the squad as they advance through. Shepard and the team continue advancing until they reach a door that allows them in. However, the door is locked, but Liara tries to hack it with a certain hacking device, which she says will take a while before the door is completely hacked open. Waiting for the door to open, the team has to defend the position from numerous waves of Shadow Broker forces. Eventually, the door is successfully hacked, and they run inside.\n\nAs the team makes their way inside, more troops are encountered. Liara remarks she has downloaded the ship's layout, saying that they're heading towards the prison block, where Feron is supposedly located. Continuing to the prison block and fighting their way through, the team reaches a locked door that leads directly to where Feron is. They bypass the door and enter to find Feron. Liara attempts to release the drell, but instead, he is shocked. Feron explains that his current status makes him unable to be pulled out, otherwise his brain will fry. Shepard states that this \"looked too easy\" and asks Feron regarding the Shadow Broker, but unfortunately, Feron can't say much, either, since even that gets him shocked. At this point, Liara and Shepard decide that their only option is to confront the Shadow Broker himself and put an end to all this. They walk out the prison block, facing more enemies along the way. At last, they make it to the Shadow Broker's office.\n\nStorming the Shadow Broker's office, where he calmly awaits them behind his desk, Shepard and the team find that the Shadow Broker is a species never encountered before. Not bothering to get up, the Broker coldly asks if Shepard and Liara are here for Feron, noting Shepard's actions are reckless even considering the Commander's history. After a brief word exchange between Shepard and the Broker, Liara demands Feron, to which the Broker responds by reminding Liara that her own actions are what caused this to Feron. Knowing that the Commander had defeated the Collectors, the Broker announced his intention to use the Normandy SR-2's IFF to salvage remaining Collector technology. The Broker notes the team's third squad member (commenting on the financial/political benefits their capture/death will bring him) while arrogantly disregarding Liara, telling her that he knows all her secrets. In response, Liara tells the Broker that he is a yahg, likely taken from his homeworld as a trophy or pet, when he ended up killing the original Shadow Broker and taking his place some 60 years ago. This enrages the Broker, causing him to smash his desk and throws it at the three people standing in front of him, knocking out the third squad member, leaving only Liara and Shepard against him.\n\nThe two rely on each other to fight the giant yahg, in what seems like an unwinnable battle at first. At some point during the fight, Liara suggests that Shepard distracts the Shadow Broker while she prepares for an attack. As soon as Shepard provides the distraction, Liara uses her biotics to pull down the liquid in the above tank straight onto the Broker, which causes the Broker's barrier to malfunction and explode, ultimately destroying him for good.\n\nThe battle causes the Broker's agents to radio his office asking for immediate updates on the situation. At first, Liara seems overwhelmed and unsure what to do. Then, she moves toward the panel and responds to the agents using the Shadow Broker's voice modification to avoid exposing herself, saying that the situation is under control, and it was merely a hardware problem that disrupted communications momentarily, ending the message by requesting the agents to resume standard procedures and that she wants an update on all operations within a solar day. Feron comes to the room and quickly pulls his pistol, before he realizes everything has been dealt with. Liara explains that she is now the new Shadow Broker, believing that it is something she has to do. Feron leaves with the other squadmate to check on the power system, leaving Liara and Shepard by themselves.\n\nShepard comforts a crying Liara with a hug, who is happy that her revenge is finally over after two years' worth of struggling. Liara thanks him for what the Commander has helped her accomplish and assures that he is welcome any time. In a subsequent conversation, Liara will remark that her role as the Shadow Broker will likely play key role in the upcoming war against the Reapers. She also provides Shepard with additional insight on the Shadow Broker's plans and what he knew. Later, Shepard invites Liara to the Normandy for a catch up.\n\nDestruction of the Bahak system[]\n\nEventually, Shepard was contacted by Fleet Admiral Steven Hackett, asking him to locate and rescue one of his close personal friends, Dr. Amanda Kenson, an Alliance deep-cover operative in batarian space who has come across evidence that a Reaper invasion is imminent. Hackett explains that Kenson was recently captured by batarians and charged with terrorism. Wanting to avoid a diplomatic incident with the Batarian Hegemony, Hackett requests Shepard to go in alone and rescue the scientist as a favor. Shepard agrees to help and uses the coordinates given by Hackett to travel to the batarian prison on the planet Aratoht where Kenson is being held.\n\nLanding outside the prison, Shepard makes it past several security measures and prison guards. He locates Kenson in the middle of an interrogation and frees her. Shepard and Kenson fight past more guards and escape on a batarian shuttle. On the way to Kenson's team's base, she reveals that she and her team had entered batarian space to investigate rumors of Reaper technology orbiting on the fringes of the Bahak system. The team discovered a Reaper artifact they dubbed \"Object Rho\" hidden in the asteroids near the system's mass relay and learned from it that the Reapers were rapidly approaching. The Reapers could use the system's mass relay, the \"Alpha Relay\", to strike anywhere in the galaxy. Kenson and her team started what they called \"the Project\" to prevent this from happening. Their plan was to hurl a large asteroid at the Alpha Relay and destroy it, delaying the Reapers' plans by months or even years as they are forced to find another relay. A consequence of this plan would be that the relay's supernova-like explosion would obliterate the Bahak system and kill the 300,000 inhabitants of Aratoht. Since the stakes are so high, Shepard insists on seeing Kenson's evidence first. Kenson agrees and informs her team at the Project Base that she and Shepard are on route.\n\nAt the Project Base, Shepard notices a numeric readout above the hangar gateway. Kenson says that the readout is a countdown to the Reapers' arrival; in two days, the Reapers will be at the Alpha Relay. The countdown itself is based on pulses emitted by Object Rho. The pulses are reactions to the Reapers' proximity and the intervals between them have been decreasing steadily. In little over 48 hours, the pulses will become constant, and the Reapers will have arrived. As Kenson leads Shepard to Object Rho, she explains that \"the Project\" is ready to go. The team hasn't been debating if it could be carried out, but rather if it should be. The Reapers will arrive regardless, but without the shortcut that the Alpha Relay provides, they would be forced to spend months or even years more traveling to another relay.\n\nAt the lab, Kenson presents Object Rho to Shepard. The Commander becomes wary after seeing that the Reaper artifact is sitting in the open. Kenson tells Shepard to wait for the artifact to show Shepard a vision which will prove that the invasion is real. Shepard is overcome with the vision, which shows dozens of Reapers speeding towards a mass relay. Suddenly, Kenson pulls a gun on Shepard and says she can't let the Commander stop the Reapers; Kenson and her team had been indoctrinated by Object Rho. Shepard disarms Kenson, who escapes and locks him in the chamber as it is swarmed with guards. Shepard fights as long as possible but is eventually overwhelmed and incapacitated.\n\nShepard awakens two days later in a medical lab in Project Base, to the surprise of the monitoring medic. Shepard disables two guards but is locked in the room by the medic. At a nearby terminal, the Commander takes control of a LOKI Mech outside, which Shepard uses to kill the scientist and break the mechanism that seals off the room. Shepard suits up and advances through the Project Base, intending to complete \"the Project\" before the Reapers arrive in less than two hours.\n\nThe Commander fights through Kenson's indoctrinated security guards to reach the control center and prepares to activate the Base's engines. After being warned by the Base's VI that initiating the Project will kill all of the Bahak system's 304,942 colonists, Shepard confirms the order. The engines ignite and the asteroid accelerates toward the Alpha Relay. Dr. Kenson interrupts Shepard's attempt to access communications, threatening to overload the Base's fusion core to stop the Project. Getting to the core, Shepard manually initiates cooling systems to stop Kenson's crazed plan. In the core chamber, Kenson laments not being able to hear the Reapers' whispers anymore and witness their coming to the galaxy. When she raises a bomb detonator, Shepard tries to talk her down, but Kenson still presses the button and dies in the explosion, which also incapacitates Shepard.\n\nWhen Shepard recovers, the asteroid is now minutes away from colliding with the Alpha Relay. Commander Shepard races to the Project Base's shuttle landing pads to escape, but is too late; the last of the shuttles lifts off and speeds away, leaving behind other Project personnel. Shepard eliminates them and finds a communications uplink nearby. While calling the Normandy, Harbinger appears via a hologram projector and tells Shepard that the fall of the galaxy's civilization is inevitable. Before disconnecting, Harbinger tells Shepard to \"prepare for the arrival.\" The Normandy makes its approach and Shepard lands a running jump into the airlock. Seconds before the asteroid hits, the Normandy escapes the Bahak system through the relay. As anticipated, the relay is destroyed and the explosion obliterates the system.\n\nSometime later, Admiral Hackett boards the Normandy to debrief Commander Shepard in-person. Hackett wants Shepard to explain why a simple rescue mission ended with the destruction of a batarian system. Shepard confirms that Dr. Kenson's proof of the Reaper invasion was real, and the invasion had been only days away. The Commander had no choice but to destroy the Alpha Relay, despite how this would doom the batarian colonists. Hackett is satisfied by Shepard's story, saying he would give a medal to Shepard for this, but reveals that tensions between the Systems Alliance and the Batarian Hegemony were running high; the batarians might start a war over Shepard's actions. He was then a wanted man, gaining the status of a war criminal, while Admiral Hackett admitted he saw him as a hero he told Shepard he would eventually have to give himself up. Everyone knew about the Reaper threat, but nobody had seen the things that Shepard, Hackett and Anderson had seen. Before leaving, Hackett warns that at some point, Shepard will have to face trial over this incident on Earth.\n\nImprisonment[]\n\nFollowing Admiral Hackett's suggestion, Shepard turns himself into Alliance custody and is stripped of his rank and imprisoned in an Alliance base in Vancouver under house arrest. Negotiating with the Alliance, while losing the Normandy in the process, Shepard remains on Earth awaiting a scheduled trial regarding his association with Cerberus and the destruction of the Bahak system. During his incarceration, Shepard is confronted by Corporal Toombs, now a mercenary, who proceeds to inform him that he is subject to his policy of killing any and all Cerberus operatives he encounters and orders his men to kill the commander. Shepard is able to hold off his attackers, incapacitating two of them and breaking Toombs' right arm, until security guards arrive and break up the fight before it escalates.\n\nWar against the Reapers[]\n\nFall of Earth[]\n\nSix months have passed since the destruction of the Bahak system and Shepard's voluntary return to the Alliance. The Commander has since been relieved of command and detained in a Systems Alliance facility in the city of Vancouver on Earth. Without warning, Alliance deep space outposts beyond Sol began to go dark. Fleet Admiral Steven Hackett, the head of the Alliance military, begins to prepare for an imminent invasion. Admiral David Anderson arrives in Vancouver and escorts Shepard with Lieutenant James Vega to a meeting with an Alliance defense committee. Shepard confirms their worst fears: the Reapers have returned to the galaxy and are on their way to Earth.\n\nAt that moment, contact is lost with Luna Base and news reports begin to surface of an unknown alien force landing in Earth's cities. The Reapers have already arrived. A Reaper capital ship then descends through the clouds over Vancouver and blasts the Alliance building, killing the defense committee and Alliance staff. Shepard and Anderson survive and contact Lieutenant Commander Ashley Williams, telling her to get to the Normandy.\n\nAs Shepard and Anderson make their way from building to building to get to the spaceport, Anderson tells Shepard that they have to get to the Citadel and seek help from the Council. They reach a comm set near a crashed gunship and hail the Normandy to evacuate. After holding off an attack from Cannibals, the Normandy bombs the area clear of attackers. As Shepard boards the ship, Anderson informs the Commander that he will stay behind to lead the resistance and hands over Shepard's dog tags. Shepard protests, but Anderson charges Shepard with getting as much help as possible to save Earth and stop the Reapers.\n\nAs the Normandy lifts off, Shepard witnesses a child running to an Alliance evacuation area and boarding a shuttle. As the shuttles lift off, a Destroyer-class Reaper emerges from behind a cluster of buildings and targets the shuttles, killing those who were aboard including the child. Distraught, Shepard steps away from the open shuttle bay doors of the Normandy, and the ship escapes Earth as more Reapers and the wreckage of Alliance ships rain down upon the planet.\n\nMars Archives[]\n\nShortly after escaping Earth, Shepard received a communication from Admiral Hackett, ordering the commander to the Prothean Archives on Mars, where humanity first discovered mass effect technology. Hackett insists that Liara T'Soni has found there what may be the only way to defeat the Reapers.\n\nUpon arrival, Shepard, James and Ashley take the shuttle down to the planet, receiving a warning from EDI that the base is not responding. They soon discover the reason why upon witnessing Cerberus soldiers executing Alliance personnel; the group fights their way through the enemy, inferring from the small size of the Cerberus force that they must have had help from the inside. Ashley expressed her surprise that Shepard was unaware of this, given his past association with Cerberus, and was unwilling to believe he cut ties with the extremist organization following his defeat of the Collectors, only to receive an angry rebuttal from Shepard -- who apparently has had enough of her mistrust towards him and constantly questioning his loyalty.\n\nAfter entering the station and arriving in time to witness Liara biotically overpower and execute her pursuers, who later explains why Hackett sent them to find her; she has found in the Archives blueprints for a Prothean device that might allow them to turn the tide against the Reapers. Unfortunately, Cerberus has learned of it too, and now they must hurry to recover the necessary information before Cerberus can. Sending James back to the shuttle to secure their escape route and prevent Cerberus from doing so, Shepard, Ashley and Liara fight their way through the station to the main Archive, discovering along the way the identity of the traitor in the station: Dr. Eva Coré, supposedly a recently arrived researcher, but in truth a mole who sabotaged the station's defenses to allow Cerberus entry.\n\nReaching the Prothean beacon at the heart of the Archives, the Illusive Man contacts them by hologram, mocking the Alliance for failing to take advantage of the wealth of information the Protheans left behind and commenting that Shepard is fighting a losing battle. He also explains his new motivation: to find a way to control the Reapers and thus use their power to advance humanity to a new level of evolution and above the other races. Deriding the Illusive Man's plan as madness, Shepard vows to use the information to destroy the Reapers and dismisses the Illusive Man's warning not to interfere in Cerberus' plans.\n\nThe group then encounters Dr. Coré, who had been trying to upload information on the Prothean device, but her upload is interrupted by the squad, and she tries to flee. Although Coré is able to reach a Cerberus shuttle, James disables it with a kamikaze attack before it can escape, having also alerted the Normandy to extract the squad. Coré, revealed to be an android by the explosion, emerges from the wreckage and attacks, critically injuring Ashley before being disabled by Shepard. The Normandy arrives to extract the team just as Reaper forces begin landing on Mars.\n\nHaving escaped Mars, Shepard forwards information on the Prothean device to Hackett, orders Liara and EDI to begin extracting intel from the android and orders the Normandy to the Citadel.\n\nUniting the galaxy[]\n\nUpon arrival at the Citadel, Ashley is taken for medical treatment at the nearest hospital and Shepard conveyed to a meeting with the Council. Upon arriving, Shepard is quick to see the Councilors are looking to their own borders. Despite Councilor Udina's insistence that Earth is bearing the brunt of the attack and needs the most help, Councilor Tevos succinctly sums up their view: while the Reapers focus on Earth, the other races have time to regroup and build up their own defenses. The Council is also unimpressed by the Prothean device, insisting it must be flawed as it failed to save the Protheans from extinction at the hands of the Reapers, but Liara explains that a missing component referred to as \"the Catalyst\" prevented its completion. All is not entirely lost for Earth, however: Councilor Valern informs Shepard of a war summit they are convening to properly organize their strategy against the Reapers, and that whatever the summit decides will give the final word on the deployment of Council forces.\n\nUpon departing the meeting, Shepard and Udina are met in the human Councilor's office by Councilor Sparatus, who explains that Palaven's ruler, Primarch Fedorian, was to head the war summit, but didn't escape the system before the Reapers arrived. He requests that Shepard and the Normandy extract him from his current location on Palaven's moon Menae, explaining that Fedorian will be a useful ally in accruing support for Earth. Before departing, Councilor Sparatus informs Shepard that the Council has agreed to uphold his Spectre status, granting Shepard the benefits of the position.\n\nThe Normandy enters the turian home system to find Palaven and Menae under heavy attack by the Reapers, with the turian military under immense pressure and taking heavy losses. Upon landing on the moon at a turian base, Shepard learns from General Corinthus, the commanding officer of Menae’s base, that Primarch Fedorian is dead, having been killed an hour before Shepard's arrival and they have no idea who has succeeded him because their communications with Palaven Command have been cut. Fighting through swarms of Husks to the communications tower and repairing it, the group soon learns that General Adrien Victus, a popular military commander with \"a reputation for playing loose with strategy\", has been named as Palaven's next Primarch; however, he is fighting at a base several miles away, with which radio contact has been lost. At the same time, Shepard receives a message from Joker that EDI and the Normandy are acting strangely; Liara returns to investigate, while Shepard's old squad member Garrus Vakarian, now named strategic advisor to the turian army, greets Shepard and joins the team to help fight and to lead them to Victus' position.\n\nFighting their way through Reaper forces, Shepard, James and Garrus arrive at the base and after helping Victus and his soldiers defeat their attackers, relay the news to the General that he is the new leader of his people. Victus is doubtful about his ability to lead, claiming to be no diplomat and unwilling to leave his men, but he reluctantly agrees to accompany Shepard to the summit. He insists he can't divert troops to Earth until Palaven can be secured, something beyond the turian military's ability to do now. The turians will need reinforcements, namely the krogan, to succeed, and Victus insists they will have to be at the summit.\n\nUpon returning to the Normandy, Shepard and the crew discover the earlier power fluctuations were caused by EDI implanting herself in Eva's body, a process which has completed successfully and given EDI more options, namely the ability to leave the Normandy and accompany Shepard into combat. Soon after, Shepard receives word from Admiral Hackett that Alliance Research and Development has begun construction of the Prothean device, dubbing it \"Project Crucible\".\n\nThe last Prothean[]\n\nShepard later received a message from Alliance Command learning that Cerberus attacked Eden Prime and is occupying the colony, but in the process, Cerberus uncovered a major Prothean artifact. Alliance HQ ordered Shepard to infiltrate the colony and recover the artifact.\n\nAfter being dropped off, the squad proceeds down the pathway until reaching their first set of buildings. Once obtaining intel for the Eden Prime resistance movement, Shepard activates the excavation lift and the group discovers from Liara that Cerberus uncovered a living Prothean in stasis, but if they open the pod without the proper signal, it will kill the Prothean inside. To activate the pod, the group needed the command signal to open it, and the stasis readiness signal to deactivate its stasis mode. Since both were located in disparate locations on the settlement, a Cerberus shuttle flies overhead and drops off several combat engineers, troopers, and centurions to delay Shepard's team.\n\nThe team enters one of the labs that Cerberus was using to study the footage of the Protheans in order to obtain the pod's stasis readiness signal. Fortunately, due to the Cipher he received on Feros three years ago, Shepard was able to understand the footage detailing the Reapers' invasion of the Prothean Empire. Once the signal obtained, the group moves across the courtyard and enter a building with four corpses. Shepard remarks that the inhabitants were killed while \"watching the game.\" Once outside, two Cerberus shuttles race overhead and drop additional troops and engineers but are quickly swept aside. The group enters the second lab and use to computer console to retrieve information about how to physically open the pod.\n\nOnce the Cerberus troops present were eliminated, Shepard activates the pod and the Prothean awakens from stasis. He reacts with a biotic attack against his rescuers as he stumbles out of the pod, disoriented. He then looks up with shock at the human settlements, lush fields, and the ruins of the Prothean structures. Shepard then touches him, causing the Commander to experience his recent memories while he in turn quickly understands human language with his sensory ability. The Prothean introduces himself as Javik and agrees to join Shepard in destroying the Reapers, vowing he will not rest until the last Reaper is dead. However, he did not hide his surprise that \"primitive\" races the Protheans once studied are now the dominant galactic power.\n\nAiding the krogan[]\n\nThe decision to involve the krogan in proceedings causes major problems; the asari pull out of the summit altogether, believing turian-krogan relations too fragile for anything to be accomplished. A diplomatic meeting is held between Shepard, Primarch Victus, Dalatrass Linron (the leader of the Salarian Union), and Urdnot Wrex (the clan chief of the krogan). The dalatrass is openly hostile and insulting to the krogan leader, who is ambivalent to the plight of the turians, insisting that the Reapers are moving on Tuchanka and refuses to provide military assistance unless his own demand is met; that a cure is created for the genophage. The dalatrass flatly refuses to agree to such a demand, arguing that what Shepard and Victus are planning to do in curing the genophage is the same rash mistake the salarians made when they uplifted the krogan to fight against the rachni, while Victus believes the plan impossible because it would take years to synthesize a cure, a time frame they don't have to spare.\n\nHowever, Wrex reveals intel he has received that following the experiments of a salarian scientist into curing the genophage on infertile krogan females, an STG team rounded up the survivors of the experiments – a group of now fertile females who are also immune to the genophage – and took them off-world. The dalatrass, under pressure, reluctantly reveals that the females are being held at an STG base on Sur'Kesh and accedes to their release, though she insists that curing the genophage will have dire consequences for her people and the galaxy as a whole.\n\nShepard, his squad and Wrex arrive on Sur'Kesh to oversee the exchange, meeting up with the salarian scientist in charge: former teammate Mordin Solus, who is responsible for the krogan females' care and is revealed to be the source who leaked information on their existence to the krogan. However, as a side effect of the cure, the females suffered from weakened immune systems and only one has survived. A Cerberus strike force hits the base shortly during the exchange, seeking to kill the surviving female and stop any hope of a cure for the genophage. Shepard and his squad are forced to fight off Cerberus troopers deploying into the base as Mordin and Wrex attempt to extract her.\n\nThe team escape Sur'Kesh with the female krogan, who is christened \"Eve\" by Mordin, and the cure is rapidly developed. Eve takes some time to regain her strength, and when she's ready Mordin proclaims her fit for travel to Tuchanka, where she's needed for the last leg of the genophage cure's completion. Wrex and Primarch Victus approach Shepard with problems of their own, requesting that the Commander deal with them if there's time.\n\nThe Normandy then deploys to Tuchanka (recapturing an ancient ground-to-space cannon from Cerberus and preventing the terrorist organization from detonating an ancient turian bomb along the way), where the Reapers have begun attacking in force. They decide to release the cure from the Shroud, an enormous salarian structure built to repair Tuchanka's atmosphere that was then secretly repurposed to spread the original genophage. En route, Shepard is contacted privately by Dalatrass Linron, who insists Shepard cannot go through with the genophage cure and reveals that the Special Tasks Group sabotaged the Shroud years ago to prevent it from being used for such a plan. The dalatrass offers Shepard a deal: prevent repairs to the Shroud, thus causing the cure to fail, and in exchange, the salarians will provide military support and technical expertise to help construct the Crucible. Shepard and his team set course for Tuchanka to help cure the genophage, but the words of the dalatrass begun to weigh heavy on his mind.\n\nUpon arrival on the planet, Wrex rallies the krogan forces, who will work with a turian fighter squadron to distract a Reaper destroyer using the Shroud to further poison the atmosphere of Tuchanka. However, the plan almost immediately goes awry, with the krogan ground forces delayed and the fighters decimated as they attempt to attack without support. The ground forces are scattered, and Shepard's team is forced to detour through ancient and impressive krogan ruins, that also happens to be home of the largest known thresher maw. They improvise a new plan, luring the thresher maw into attacking the Reaper Destroyer to buy them time. This strategy is significantly more effective than the last; despite overwhelming Reaper opposition, Mordin and Shepard make it to the Shroud and Kalros manages to kill the Destroyer. While on route, Shepard warned Wrex, Eve, and Mordin of Dalatrass Linron's sabotage of the tower and told them how she wished for him to lie to his friends in order to gain salarian support. Wrex and Eve were eternally grateful for Shepard's warning; while Mordin didn't seem so surprised the Dalatrass would try to pull such an underhanded move.\n\nHowever, new complications arose. Mordin, now aware of the STG sabotage, explains that the sabotage must be counteracted from the top of the tower in order to ensure proper release of the cure; a task that, with the tower collapsing as they speak, is essentially a suicide mission. Shepard regretfully allows Mordin to travel up to the top of the Shroud Tower to spread the cure. Mordin is killed in the subsequent explosion, finally at peace with his work on the genophage modification project. The Shroud lets out a blast of particles, blanketing Tuchanka with a shower of the cure before disintegrating and Eve survives the procedure, fleeing to a safe place alongside Wrex. Shepard succeeded in securing a krogan-turian alliance and only got a little salarian support from several strike teams within the STG, but dismissed the concern citing that the cost of their full-support was too high.\n\nCerberus coup attempt[]\n\nStill feeling the effects of Mordin's sacrifice following his mission on Tuchanka, Shepard is contacted by Councilor Valern, who requests a meeting on the Citadel regarding an important matter. The Councilor explains that it concerns Councilor Udina, who has been moving vast sums of money and the Councilor wishes to discuss where it is going, claiming that Shepard \"won't like the n"
