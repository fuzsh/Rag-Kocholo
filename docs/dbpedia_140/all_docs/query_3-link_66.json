        "text": "The team peeled away a layer of pink paint to reveal the building’s original bricks, and kept all the window grilles and frames. The three-bedroom house was renovated with Lim’s mother in mind, but since she moved out, Lim’s eldest daughter has taken over.\n\nTHE 300-YEAR-OLD OLIVE TREE\n\nThis tree took 30 days to reach Singapore from Italy; it arrived with fruit, but will never bear any again due to the island nation’s climate.\n\nLim said the tree was especially symbolic to him. It has three trunks, with a space right in the middle of them; to Lim, this represented the partnership between him and his two brothers, with whom he co-founded Sheng Siong in 1985. Like the tree, Lim said, he and his brothers worked together for the common good of the business, but the crevice between them also allowed for room to give way to each other when there were disagreements. Noting that olive branches were a symbol of peace, Lim said the tree was also sited between the new house and the old as a “peace offering” of sorts.\n\nPIG FEATURE WALL\n\nThis centrepiece cannot be ignored. Upon walking through the front door, visitors are greeted by a mosaic feature wall of a pig, made up of nearly 4,500 timber blocks in eight shades. It represents the Lim family’s humble roots, of which Lim said he was very proud. The artwork is based on a photograph Lim’s father took of the first pig he reared.\n\nWith great mirth, Lim tells the story of how his handyman father had bought a sick, imported pig for S$30, strapped it to his bicycle and brought it home, then fed it bottles of traditional Chinese medicine Three Legs Cooling Water. The pig recovered the next day, so his father bought more sick pigs and treated them with the medicine. It was this entry into pig farming that led Lim’s brother to open a stall at a provision shop to sell their excess pork. Later, when the provision shop owner ran into financial difficulties, the Lim family bought it over for S$30,000 – and the first Sheng Siong shop was born.\n\nCHINESE PHILOSOPHIES\n\nThe house was designed to incorporate the Chinese philosophies which Lim holds dear. One, which he calls chu tou, means giving headway or leeway. Lim said it was a business philosophy that underlined how partners must be in a mutually beneficial relationship, explaining that you had to leave room for others and not take full advantage of all benefits.\n\nThis philosophy has been physically manifested in the house in two ways. First, the glass railings on the roof gardens are not built right at the edge, but 1.4 metres in. Second, the green wall in the courtyard and the marble slab in his bathroom protrude through the ceiling. Lim said this meant that in the house, one could chu tou while lying down and standing up.\n\nLim also wanted his house to represent the elements of fire, water, earth, metal and wood. There is a green wall, for example, with water flowing through it, and copper plates that are backlit to represent the fire element.\n\nENTERTAINMENT FACILITIES\n\nLim said that at the end of 2019, just before the pandemic struck, he hosted a party with over 400 guests. Yes, the house is that big. Property regulations mandate that Good Class Bungalows, such as those owned by Lim, can only take up 40 per cent of the site’s land – leaving a lot of garden space for him to host parties.\n\nThe house also has a large second floor, where the living and dining rooms are situated, while the basement has a suite of entertainment facilities including a 30-metre saltwater pool, children’s pool, squash court, film theatre, sauna, karaoke room, games room, gym, bar, and jacuzzi."
