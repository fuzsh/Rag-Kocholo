Reading the Rom-Com: Renaissance and Modern. 100 Units.\n\nThis course challenges the common assumption that modern romantic comedies are not worthy of academic study by examining early modern iterations of the genre--from William Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew (1590) to Aphra Behn's The Rover (1677). In turning to these sixteenth- and seventeenth-century texts, we will consider how this often trivialized genre encodes, theorizes, and problematizes issues of gender, sex, class, race, and desire through its familiar formula of \"simply\" getting some people to fall in love. (Drama, Pre-1650)\n\nInstructor(s): Sarah-Gray Lesley Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nENGL 10404. Genre Fundamentals: Poetry. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is an introduction to poetry by way of attention to poetry's arts of condensation, its techniques for producing complexities of meaning in small spaces. While our readings are drawn from a wide historical range, they do not aim to provide a representative survey of English-language poetry. Rather, they serve as a series of explorations of the ways poetic signification works. We will practice slowing down our attention, noticing where things get dense or strange, engaging with the play of poetic language and form, and articulating the questions provoked by that engagement. Our aim is to become better at thinking through poetry: that is, both thinking through the questions we articulate as we grapple with poetic language and form, and thinking about the topics poetry grapples with by way of its peculiar modes of encounter with those problems. To give some focus to our explorations, we will turn throughout the course to questions of gender, sexuality, race, and class, and ask how poetry functions as a distinctive medium for exploring the intersections of subjectivity, desire, power, and social form. (Genre Fundamentals, Poetry)\n\nInstructor(s): Mark Miller Terms Offered: Winter\n\nENGL 10405. Fantastical London: Literature, Film, Psychogeography. 100 Units.\n\nIn a series of classic essays, Walter Benjamin describes Paris as the dreamworld of modernity, crowning it the \"capital of the nineteenth century.\" This course follows Benjamin's critique of the modern city as a \"phantasmagoria,\" but shifts the terrain of his argument to ask: what if London were seen as the center of a distinctly dreamlike modernity? What purchase do literature and art afford in the elaboration of this thought-experiment? In this class we will approach London as a city of utopian wishes and Gothic nightmares, exploring the real social conditions and mapping the built environments that mark the Big Smoke as an enduring site of collective fantasy. We will read writings by British authors like Charles Dickens, J.G. Ballard, Iain Sinclair, and China Miéville, alongside works of popular and avant-garde film, comics, and critical theory, to accompany our sojourn through the dream-geography of a fantastical London. This course may also involve site-specific field visits to archetypal London locations and an experimental research/ psychogeography final project. (Fiction, 1830-1990, Theory)\n\nInstructor(s): Cassandra Lerer Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): Admission to London Program (study abroad) required.\n\nENGL 10406. Eating in Early Modern England: Gender, Race, Food. 100 Units.\n\nThe relationship between the construct of idealized femininity and food consumption has a long and troubled history; this course looks at this relationship through premodern Anglophone Literature. From Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales to Mary Rowlandson's The Sovereignty and Goodness of God, this course situates discourses about \"proper\" gender performance and \"proper\" eating habits alongside those of race, religion, sexuality, commodity trade, and colonization to reveal the messy and complicated sociopolitical history of the dinner table.(Fiction, Pre-1650)\n\nInstructor(s): Sarah-Gray Lesley Terms Offered: Spring\n\nENGL 10408. The African American Novel: Satire and Critique. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will explore the centrality of satire to the African American novel. By examining the genre of satire in general and in a set of African American novels and short stories, we will attend to how narrative fiction can critique the category of race and attempt to effect social change. Focusing on the relationship between racism and capitalism, we will integrate readings in literary criticism, critical theory, and social history to inform our study of fictional works. Fiction writers may include Percival Everett, George Schuyler, Langston Hughes, Cord Jefferson, Zora Neale Hurston, and Ishmael Reed. Critical writers may include M.M. Bakhtin, W.E.B. Du Bois, Ralph Ellison, Barbara Fields, David Levering Lewis, Adolph Reed, Judith Stein, and Kenneth Warren. (Fiction, 1830-1990, Theory)\n\nInstructor(s): Christopher Gortmaker Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nENGL 10410. Renaissance Insomniacs. 100 Units.\n\nThe world is divided into those who can sleep and those who can't,\" writes French author Marie Darrieussecq in her 2023 memoir on insomnia, Sleepless. This statement emblematizes a totalizing breviloquence curiously common to literature on insomnia. This condition's relevance to our increasingly sleep-deprived world is, indeed, increasingly clear. However, to what extent, and in what ways, should we consider its prevalence, and concern thereof, a new phenomenon? How might the history of sleeplessness illuminate the ideological contours of our contemporary sleep crisis? What, in particular, can analyzing various literatures of insomnia and sleep offer to this line of inquiry? Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy (1621) contains one of the earliest and most detailed descriptions of insomnia, reflecting the period's rising concern for the profound necessity and vulnerability of sleep and sleeplessness. From Macbeth's \"murder'd sleep\" to the \"slumb'rous weight\" of Miltonic rest in Paradise Lost, this course takes a cross-genre approach to examining the literature of insomnia, seeking to uncover the insights yielded by literary efforts to process this uniquely debilitating state of restlessness and exhaustion. (Drama, Poetry, Pre-165)\n\nInstructor(s): Andrés Irigoyen Terms Offered: Spring\n\nENGL 10412. Climate Fiction, Modernism, and the Future. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will explore Anglo-American literary modernism through the concept of \"metabolic rift.\" As a way of understanding capitalism's estrangement from the natural processes that are its condition of possibility, this concept will let us investigate how, throughout twentieth-century industrialization and amid accelerating climate change today, formally innovative works of literature can critically relate modernist ideas of autonomous artistic form to the promethean ideologies and ecological impacts of capitalist modernity. Readings in theory and criticism may include Karl Marx, John Bellamy Foster, Michael Fried, Anahid Nersessian, and Nicholas Brown. Readings in classical Anglo-American modernist fiction and poetry may include T.S. Eliot, E.M. Forster, Ernest Hemingway, Upton Sinclair, Wallace Stevens, Carl Sandburg, Gertrude Stein, Wyndham Lewis, and Virginia Woolf. (Fiction, Poetry, 1830-1990, Theory)\n\nInstructor(s): Christopher Gortmaker Terms Offered: Winter\n\nENGL 10414. Documentary/Fantasy in 20th Century American Literature. 100 Units.\n\nThe 20th century was rocked by a series of historical events that challenged the public to face the unimaginable: whether that meant finding language to absorb the violence of the Holocaust or articulate a connection to a history of enslavement, conceptualizing the potential for mutually-ensured destruction created by the atomic bomb or imagining environmental catastrophe. For some writers, the unimaginable has demanded that artists and writers find starkly unadorned ways of documenting it; ways of showing the public that what has happened is in fact real. At other times, the reality of the unimaginable could only be captured by the imaginary: American writers invented forms of writing the real that were absurdist, surreal, increasingly turning to innovations in genre fiction. How did these writers shape or reshape a sense of history as it was happening? What styles of writing are closest to the real? How does the fantastical grapple with history and testimony? The syllabus will pair texts that take documentary approaches to the major events of the century with those that use unreal and surreal ones. Possible pairings include John Hersey's \"Hiroshima\" with Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, Chester Himes' A Rage in Harlem and WEB DuBois' The Souls of Black Folk, Truman Capote's In Cold Blood with Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio, Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire with Robert Lowell's Life Studies, Octavia Butler's Kindred with Angela Y. Davis' Women, Race, and Class. (Fiction)\n\nInstructor(s): Dana Glaser Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nENGL 10416. Radical Style: Politics and Writing in the 1960s and 1970s. 100 Units.\n\nFrom the iconic militant images of the Black Panthers sporting afros and slinging rifles to the street theater of the Yippies, the melodrama of bra-burning, and the parodic extremity of Valerie Solanas' SCUM manifesto, the moment of the 1960s and 1970s is as synonymous with certain kinds of style as it is with radical politics. Often, the former to the detriment of the latter: the more style, the less substance: for example, the counterculture's tuning in and dropping out depoliticized the student movement and the Black Panthers' star power is \"radical chic\" that undermined the seriousness of their willingness to use revolutionary violence. Why did political activists write and perform their politics this way? What made these politics radical - that is, what is it about them that rethought something from its roots or foundations? Does radical style always suggest a radical politics? This class mixes cultural history, political theory, and literary approaches to the moment of the new social movements of the 1960s. We'll read the serious political texts that invented modern ideas of race, sex, gender, and class politics as having style of their own, and we'll read them alongside the film, poetry, theater (street and otherwise) that made characterized the 60's. We'll also make good use of archives in Chicago, which was one of the primary centers for New Left political activity, and students will have a chance to do firsthand archival research. (1830-1990)\n\nInstructor(s): Dana Glaser Terms Offered: Winter\n\nENGL 10420. Ecological Performance. 100 Units.\n\nWe are scavengers,\" reports the anonymous narrator of a 1990 manuscript written by theater maker Rachel Rosenthal. \"The land doesn't nourish us because the deserts are everywhere.\" Environmental dread has loomed large over the past few decades, and practitioners working in a range of media have increasingly foregrounded the ecological as a primary aesthetic concern. This course will investigate how recent performances have sought to understand, address, and redress climate catastrophe. We will look to a range of material-possibly including work by Rosenthal, performance collective The Sacred Naked Nature Girls, playwrights Marie Clements and Yvette Nolan, choreographers Jerome Bel, Radouan Mriziga, and Lara Kramer, artists Rebecca Belmore and Olafur Elliason, and many others-in order to examine what tactics performance offers for reckoning with environmental collapse. (Drama, Theory)\n\nInstructor(s): Fabien Maltais-Bayda Terms Offered: Spring\n\nENGL 10428. Medieval Desire. 100 Units.\n\nIn medieval literature, various modes of desire intersect in surprising ways: spiritual devotion unfolds through sensual longing, and personal pleasure intertwines with sacrificial love, producing structures of desire that are conflicting, disorienting, and not so dissimilar from our own. In this course, we will survey a range of late medieval genres to unpack the richly imaginative and experimental discourses of desire housed in fourteenth- and fifteenth-century England. Readings will include dream-vision poems like Pearl, where we will consider the overlaying of economic, domestic, and apocalyptic fantasies; to the hagiographical Book of Margery Kempe, where we will think through the entanglement of gender, embodied spirituality, and erotic encounter. We will interrogate how medieval texts trouble modernity's construction of \"sacred\" and \"secular\" desire as constitutive opposites, coming up with our own terms to better describe the interplay between these categories. How do medieval texts blend seemingly different modes of desire-holy and profane, specific and ambiguous, linear and asynchronic-to construct, obscure, and defamiliarize their objects of desire? What claims to selfhood, language, and knowledge are made by these hybrid models of desire and the multiple meanings they allow? Familiarity with medieval literature or Middle English is neither required nor expected. (Poetry, Pre-1650)\n\nInstructor(s): Kashaf Qureshi Terms Offered: Winter\n\nENGL 10430. Experimental British Poetics 1960-Now. 100 Units.\n\nThis class offers a survey of the Late-Modernist British poetry movement The British Poetry Revival and its afterlives. After WWII, in resistance to a perceived stagnancy in British verse, and inspired by many of the young U.S. poets collected in Donald Allen's New American Poetry anthology (1960), young British poets collected around England and renewed British Modernism. Initially clustered around London, Cambridge, and some Northumbrian cities, the movement (dubbed \"The British Poetry Revival\") has since grown to include the most innovative and vital poetic work written throughout the British Isles. Dense, loud, bombastic, aggressive: this vast corpus of work will offer students a view into recent British culture, economy, and politics, its world after the putative terminal decline of the empire, and its claimed \"special relationship\" with the United States. Its poets are now not just British, include among their number more women and queers, and are dispersed throughout the British Isles. This course will offer a survey of this movement from the 1960s to the present; reading will include its writing: from poetry to performance, correspondence to hallucinatory prose. Students will be asked to consider that poetry does not always look or feel the way we want it to, or the way we think it should. (Poetry, 1830-1990)\n\nInstructor(s): James Cole Terms Offered: Spring\n\nENGL 10460. The Paranoid 60s. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will consider the function of paranoia, embodiment, and the parapolitical in Philip K. Dick's oeuvre. (Fiction, 1830-1990, Theory)\n\nInstructor(s): Josh Stadtner Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nENGL 10464. Narrating Neurodivergence: Autistic Rhetorics in Literature, Education, and Critical Theory. 100 Units.\n\nThis course intends to analyze the rhetorics used by (and against) neurodivergent thinkers and writers, while simultaneously tracking the co-formation of a classroom environment that is sensitive to neurodivergence and the underexplored models of knowledge-building such an environment may produce. (Drama, Fiction, 1830-1990)\n\nInstructor(s): Nate Crocker Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nENGL 10468. The Art of Criticism. 100 Units.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a critic? And how do you write good criticism? In this class, we will study and practice criticism as an art-a medium of creative writing designed to provoke thought, offer ways of viewing the world, and leave readers entertained. Alongside pieces of criticism from various fields-literature, music, film-we'll read reflections and manifestoes on the purpose of criticism, and reflect ourselves on the landscape of criticism today. Where in our own time is criticism practiced? Strung between rapidly changing media and academic worlds, criticism is widely seen as being endangered, and yet, with the past decade's resurgence of small, lively intellectual and cultural magazines, others have claimed that we live in a golden age of criticism. We will try to make sense of this, while meanwhile taking ourselves seriously as critics: sharing with each other the work of critics we admire and writing our own critical essays. (Theory)\n\nInstructor(s): Will Harris Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nENGL 10620. Literature, Medicine, and Embodiment. 100 Units.\n\nThis class explores the connections between imaginative writing and embodiment, especially as bodies have been understood, cared for, and experienced in the framework of medicine. We'll read texts that address sickness, healing, diagnosis, disability, and expertise. The class also introduces a number of related theoretical approaches, including the medical humanities, disability studies, narrative medicine, the history of the body, and the history of science. (Theory)\n\nInstructor(s): Julie Orlemanski Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GNSE 20620, HLTH 26020\n\nENGL 10664. Poetry and Cinema. 100 Units.\n\nOn the surface, poetry and film may seem to have little in common. But over the course of the twentieth century, many poets took a serious interest in film and engaged with it as screenwriters and critics, as well as in their poetry. Likewise, many filmmakers looked to poetry as a model for how movies could work; for some, poetry (not fiction or drama) was film's artistic next of kin. This course takes a broad, multi-national survey of poetry and film from the 1920s to the 1970s. How did writers and filmmakers understand the relationship between the two mediums? What kinds of resources and challenges did each medium pose to the other? Poets on the syllabus may include Gertrude Stein, H.D., Langston Hughes, César Vallejo, Salvador Novo, Xavier Villaurrutia, Benjamin Fondane, Pierre Reverdy, and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Likely filmmakers include Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Sergei Eisenstein, Dudley Murphy, Kenneth Macpherson, Fernando de Fuentes, Maya Deren, Jean Cocteau, Kenneth Anger, and Stan Brakhage. (All texts will be in English; films will be screened with English subtitles. The course will include weekly film screenings outside of regular class meetings.)

Genre Fundamentals: Fiction. 100 Units.\n\nthrough the present, we'll consider the various genres and material forms through which fiction has found audiences. We'll ask: what have those audiences wanted from fiction? What functions has fiction served? What work can stories do, and what pleasures do they provide? If fiction is't true, what kind of knowledge or understanding can it offer? From the printing press to generative AI, how do fiction and technology interract? Focusing on the short story and the novel, we'll consider fictions and theories of fiction from authors including George Eliot, Henry James, Virginia Woolf, and Toni Morrison. Our discussions will take up topics including point of view, the relationship between narrative and time, the powers of realism and its contraries, and the experience of suspense. (Genre Fundamentals, Fiction)\n\nInstructor(s): Emily Coit Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nENGL 10800. Introduction to Film Analysis. 100 Units.\n\nThis course introduces basic concepts of film analysis, which students will discuss through examples from different national cinemas, genres, and directorial oeuvres. We will consider film as an art form, medium, and industry, and cover all the major film types: silent, classical, and contemporary narrative cinema, art cinema, animation, documentary, and experimental film. We will study the cinematic techniques: mise-en-scène, cinematography, editing, and sound, and learn how filmmakers design their works. Films discussed will include works Orson Welles, Sergei Eisenstein, Shirin Neshat, Lucrecia Martel, and Wong Kar Wai.\n\nInstructor(s): James Chandler, James Lastra, staff Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Winter\n\nNote(s): Required of students taking a major or minor in Cinema and Media Studies.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CMST 10100, ARTV 20300\n\nENGL 11200. Fundamentals of Literary Criticism. 100 Units.\n\nAn introduction to the practice of literary and cultural criticism over the centuries, with a particular emphasis on theoretical debates about meaning and interpretation in the late 20th century and present. (Genre Fundamentals, Theory)\n\nInstructor(s): Sianne Ngai Terms Offered: Winter\n\nENGL 12125. Living Queer: Experiences, Encounter, Affinities. 100 Units.\n\nIn this interdisciplinary seminar, we will explore representations and expressions of queer and trans lives across the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Assembling a diverse archive of artistic works and cultural artifacts (fiction, memoir, film, lyric poetry, anthology, activist ephemera) together with foundational works in the study of sexuality and gender, we will ask: How do hegemonic institutions, discourses, and definitions - from medical models of pathology to hostile bureaucratic infrastructure - shape the expressive forms available to queer and trans people? And how does the literary, artistic, and activist work of queer and trans people work in turn to reshape those very expressive possibilities? How can individual experiences of isolation and marginalization form the basis of a community or subculture? How are erotic creativity, imaginative life, and political action linked? Our readings will introduce a range of critical and creative methods - such as oral history, ethnography, autobiography, performance - that scholars and artists have used to theorize and represent queer life. Through short \"micro-assignments,\" we will try out these methods for ourselves. By interweaving the creative work of queer and trans people and communities with practical experiments in research and making, we will aim to broaden our collective understanding of what it might mean to \"live queer.\" (Previous experience in gender and sexuality studies is not required for this course.)\n\nInstructor(s): Sarah McDaniel Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course counts as a Foundations course for GNSE majors\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GNSE 12125\n\nENGL 12131. The Gay Men's Novel. 100 Units.\n\nThis course focuses on the history, concerns, aesthetics, movements, and culture of the gay men's novel, without the boundaries of time period, nation, or original language. The goal for students is to think in-depth about the relationship between sexual identity and narrative form, to learn about gay men's literary lineages and movements, and to think through queer theoretical concepts through fiction authored by gay men.\n\nInstructor(s): Gabriel Ojeda-Sague Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GNSE 12131\n\nENGL 12320. Critical Videogame Studies. 100 Units.\n\nSince the 1960s, games have arguably blossomed into the world's most profitable and experimental medium. This course attends specifically to video games, including popular arcade and console games, experimental art games, and educational serious games. Students will analyze both the formal properties and sociopolitical dynamics of video games. Readings by theorists such as Ian Bogost, Roger Caillois, Alenda Chang, Nick Dyer‐Witheford, Mary Flanagan, Jane McGonigal, Soraya Murray, Lisa Nakamura, Amanda Phillips, and Trea Andrea Russworm will help us think about the growing field of video game studies. Students will have opportunities to learn about game analysis and apply these lessons to a collaborative game design project. Students need not be technologically gifted or savvy, but a wide-ranging imagination and interest in digital media or game cultures will make for a more exciting quarter. This is a 2021-22 Signature Course in the College.

Medieval Experimental Style. 100 Units.\n\nThis course focuses on medieval experiments in writing Middle English - an undertaking necessarily experimental in a period when French and Latin dominated literary production. We'll also consider some twentieth- and twenty-first-century responses to medieval experimental poetics, by reading the work of writers who self-consciously appropriate the experimental styles of Middle English (e.g., Robert Glück, Zadie Smith, Patience Agbabi, and Caroline Bergvall). We will read texts by medieval authors likely to include Geoffrey Chaucer, Margery Kempe, the playwright known as the \"Wakefield Master,\" and the author of The Owl and the Nightingale. No previous experience with Middle English is expected or required. (Pre-1650)\n\nInstructor(s): Julie Orlemanski Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nENGL 12522. Chaucer's Dream Poems. 100 Units.\n\nThis course takes Chaucer's three dream poems as the basis to explore the English poet's experimental verse and the nature of medieval poetry in the later fourteenth century. As a class, we'll test ways of reading and interpreting this philosophically ambitious and riddling body of writing. No previous experience with medieval literature required. (Pre-1650)\n\nInstructor(s): Julie Orlemanski Terms Offered: Winter\n\nENGL 12704. Writing Persuasion: Health and Environment. 100 Units.\n\nA writing-intensive course in persuasive techniques that influence opinions and attempt to change behavior. This year our focus will be on an issue that presents a challenge for persuasion theory: the environment. People are notoriously slow to change their beliefs and behavior on environmental issues, and persuasion theory suggests reasons why this might be the case. Environmental problems ask readers to weigh costs that affect one group against benefits that might accrue to someone else. They involve time frames ranging from moments (which are easy to think and write about) to millennia (not so easy) to geological epochs, a time scale so remote from our experience as to be opaque to the imagination. Environmental problems are complex in ways that make them difficult to capture in a coherent, emotionally compelling narrative. Many individually innocuous and seemingly unrelated environmental events can converge over time to produce consequences that are counter-intuitively larger and graver than their causes. This felt disparity between actions and outcomes can violate an audience's sense of fairness, biasing the audience against a persuasive appeal.\n\nInstructor(s): Tracy Weiner Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CEGU 22704, ENGL 32704, ENST 12704\n\nENGL 12722. The Poetry and Prose of John Donne. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will examine the life and career of John Donne, one of the most important and influential early modern poets and thinkers writing in English. We will read Donne's love poetry, his religious poetry, his satirical poems, and his progress poems. We will also read some of his prose works: Devotions upon Emergent Occasions along with selections from his sermons and polemical treatises. Throughout, we will engage with the history of criticism and scholarship dedicated to Donne and his writings.

The Future. 100 Units.\n\nThis course focuses on the future as imagined by American science fiction of the 20th century. On the one hand, we will pay attention to the scientific, political, and cultural contexts from which particular visions of the future emerged; on the other, we will work to develop an overarching sense of science fiction as a genre. We will deploy different analytical paradigms (Formalist, Marxist, Feminist, &c.) to apprehend the stakes and the strategies for imagining future worlds. After some initial attention to the magazine and pulp culture that helped to establish the genre, we will spotlight major SF movements (Afro Futurism, Cyberpunk, Biopunk, etc.) and major authors (including Robert Heinlein, Philip K. Dick, Ursula K. Le Guin, Samuel R. Delaney, William Gibson, and Octavia Butler). Finally, we will use this 20th-century history to think about 21st-century SF work in different media (e.g., film, radio, graphic narrative).

Introduction to African American Literature 1892-1974. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will examine the political considerations and the literary and critical texts that gave rise to the conception of, and the effort to establish, African American literature. We will seek to understand why the idea of a black literature emerged and the way that this idea shaped aesthetic and critical practices for black writers over the course of the 20th century. (Fiction, Poetry, 1830-1990)\n\nInstructor(s): Ken Warren Terms Offered: Spring\n\nENGL 13570. Conspiracy, Theorized. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will explore the function of conspiracy theorizing in American politics and culture, focusing in particular on the relationship between the affective life of conspiracy theory and conspiracy theories' function as vernacular epistemologies of populist political critique. Why have conspiracy theories been so popular in American culture from the founding on? Why do they have such renewed energy today? How have conspiracy theories built upon one another to develop an alternate history of America and the world? In asking these questions, we will track how these theories reproduce ideologies of race, nation, empire, and gender. (Theory)\n\nInstructor(s): Christopher Taylor Terms Offered: Spring\n\nENGL 13580. Introduction to Asian American Literatures. 100 Units.\n\nThis is a survey course that introduces students to the complex and uneven history of Asians in American from within a transnational context. As a class, we will look at Asian American texts and films while working together to create a lexicon of multilingual, immigrant realities. Through theoretical works that will help us define keywords in the field and a wide range of genres (novels, films, plays, and graphic novels), we will examine how Asia and Asians have been represented in the literatures and popular medias of America. Some of the assigned authors include, but are not limited to, Carlos Bulosan, Maxine Hong Kingston, Joy Kogawa, Fae Myenne Ng, Nora Okja Keller, Cathy Park Hong, Ted Chiang, and Yoko Tawada.\n\nInstructor(s): Mee-Ju Ro Terms Offered: TBD\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RDIN 13580, CRES 13580\n\nENGL 13582. Crime/Fiction. 100 Units.\n\nWhat is the relationship between plotting a crime and plotting a narrative? In this course, we will examine the genre of crime fiction but work to push against the borders of the category to include works on and discussions about the politics and poetics of confession, the affinities between testimony and fiction, and the racialization of crime. (Fiction)\n\nInstructor(s): Mee-Ju Ro Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nENGL 13585. Introduction to Asian American Literature and Visual Culture. 100 Units.\n\nThis course takes cue from what Lisa Lowe describes as the \"heterogeneity, hybridity, and multiplicity\" of the term \"Asian American\" and considers a wide range of texts, images, and films ranging from early 20th century to the contemporary. What is politically and ideologically productive in employing \"Asian American\" as a pan-ethnic signifier? What are its shortcomings? And how do the parameters of this term alter in accordance with its specific historical and social contingencies? How do artists within different mediums negotiate their identity/identities through their chosen aesthetic form? To offer a fuller portrait of the capaciousness of how Asian American artists attend to their self-representation, this course brings together texts that are familiar to a broader public as well as those that linger on the fringe of institutional canonization, ranging from H. T. Tsiang's lesser known but delightfully off-the-rails The Hanging on Union Square to Maxime Hong Kingston's landmark autobiographical novel Woman Warrior; from John Yau's acerbic commentary on how Asiatic stereotypes proliferate in Hollywood media in \"Genghis Chan: Private Eye\" to Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's poetic vignettes that double as cinematic montages in DICTEE. We will also be looking at selected visual art pieces and films alongside literary texts, such as the works of Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik, and Wayne Wang's Chan is Missing. (Fiction, Poetry, Theory)\n\nInstructor(s): Cecily Chen Terms Offered: Winter\n\nENGL 13590. Race and Time. 100 Units.\n\nIn this advanced undergraduate course, we will explore the relationship between race and time. How might a concept of time already be racialized? How does the racialized subject experience time? How might such a temporality be figured through literary narratives? We'll take up these and a host of other questions pertaining to the politics and poetics of time through a literary, theoretical, and cinematic study that asks us to think critically about schemas of time in the works of writers of colour. Some of the assigned authors and writers include, but are not limited to, Ted Chiang, Shani Mootoo, Toni Morrison, Octavia Butler, Jamaica Kincaid, Anna Lee Walters, Yoko Tawada, and Frantz Fanon.\n\nInstructor(s): Mee-Ju Ro Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CRES 13590\n\nENGL 15002. Disability Now and Then: Bodies, Minds, Media. 100 Units.\n\nWhat do saints' lives and The Midnight Club (Netflix, 2022) have in common? If they seem historically distant, both texts nonetheless show disabled characters in complex relation to their communities. This course looks at contemporary texts alongside Middle English ones to ask how medieval English literature can illuminate our present understanding of disability in media. While Middle English literature lacks our term disability, it is populated with figures whose bodies and minds are depicted as deviating from the norm. Through pairings of medieval and contemporary texts, as well as disability theory readings, we will examine how stories now and then 1) moralize bodily difference, 2) figure disabled bodies of intersecting identities, and 3) attempt to express in words exclusion from and participation in communal life. Questions we will ask: How do the portrayals of disabled characters reveal a society's definition of the normal (what disability studies terms the \"normate\")? Which stereotypes do literary texts perpetuate about disability, and can we produce readings that counter these harmful portrayals? Can barriers to access lead to creativity and imagination? Finally: what role do literary histories play in helping us understand medieval and contemporary conceptions of disability? Our work will culminate with a visit to the Newberry Library and a creative project. (Pre-1650, Theory)\n\nInstructor(s): Jo Nixon Terms Offered: Spring\n\nENGL 15004. War, Culture, and Imperialism: Russia and the West from the 19th Century to the Present. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will survey literature shaped by the history of imperial conflict between Russia and \"The West,\" ultimately with a view to better understanding our current geopolitical situation and mediascape. The course will be anchored in the nineteenth century, focusing on writing related to the Crimean War (1853-6) and the long contest between Britain and Russia for domination in Central Asia and India known as \"The Great Game,\" but it will also provide a snapshot of Cold War cultural production, with an emphasis on ideological dissent among Black radicals and Russian emigres, before turning finally to our contemporary moment.

Thinking with Melville. 100 Units.\n\nIn recent years, Herman Melville's work has received considerable attention, and not simply within literary studies; anthologies devoted to \"Melville and philosophy\" and \"Melville and political theory\" have appeared, and in 2025-26 his writings will be central to a conference on law and literature at the UChicago Law School. What is it about Melville's corpus that has made it amenable to so many different kinds of conversations, and what about it sparks particular interest during our present moment? Students in this class will have a chance to think across the disciplines with Melville by reading some of his most important work-from the exhilarating, epic ride that is Moby-Dick to shorter pieces from Benito Cereno, a tale of mysterious events aboard a slave ship, to \"Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall-Street.\" We'll read these remarkable narratives in the company of critical materials situating them in relation to questions of democracy, religion, colonialism, capitalism, the natural world, the speculative, and more.\n\nInstructor(s): Jennifer Fleissner Terms Offered: Spring\n\nENGL 16500. Shakespeare I: Histories and Comedies. 100 Units.\n\nAn exploration of some of Shakespeare's major plays from the first half of his professional career, when the genres in which he primarily worked were comedies and histories. Plays to be studied include The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the Shrew, The Merchant of Venice, Measure for Measure, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Twelfth Night, Richard III, Richard II, and Henry V. Together, we will read some of Shakespeare's queerest and most delightful comedies in conversation with darker troubling plays that revolve around sexual violence, racism, nationalism, and political theory, and we will see how such topics put generic boundaries to the test. Valuing those classics for their timeless craft but also for the situated cultural horizon that they evidence, we will explore what it means to take comedy and history seriously. Three short papers will be required.

Shakespeare II: Tragedies and Romances. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores mainly major plays representing the genres of tragedy and romance; most (but not all) date from the latter half of Shakespeare's career. After having examined how Shakespeare develops and deepens the conventions of tragedy in Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, King Lear, and Antony and Cleopatra, we will turn our attention to how he complicates and even subverts these conventions in The Winter's Tale and Cymbeline. Throughout, we will treat the plays as literary texts, performance prompts, and historical documents. Section attendance is required.

John Milton's Paradise Lost. 100 Units.\n\nIn this course, we will read Milton's Paradise Lost, paying close attention to questions of genre, style, and poetics as well as the theological, philosophical, anthropological, and political commitments that shape its verse. Although we will focus on the epic itself, we will also consider highlights from the history of criticism and scholarship dedicated to the poem.

The Declaration of Independence. 100 Units.\n\nThis course offers an extended investigation of the origins, meanings, and legacies of one of the most consequential documents in world history: the Declaration of Independence. Primary and secondary readings provide a series of philosophical, political, economic, social, religious, literary, and legal perspectives on the text's sources and meanings; its drafting, circulation, and early reception in the age of the American Revolution; and its changing place in American culture and world politics over nearly 250 years. (1650-1830, 1830-1940) In addition to the noted class times, there will also be discussion sections to be scheduled once the class begins.\n\nInstructor(s): Eric Slauter Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): FNDL 27950, HMRT 17950, HIST 17604, LLSO 27950, SIGN 26039\n\nENGL 18108. Culture and the Police. 100 Units.\n\nHow do cultural products facilitate, abet, and enable the form of social ordering that we call policing? This course will explore the policing function of what modernity calls \"culture\" by exploring the parallel histories of policing, the emergence of modern police theory, and the rise of the novel. We will focus in particular on how both literature and the police emerge to navigate a series of linked epistemological and political problematics: the relation between particularity and abstraction, the relation between deviance and normalcy, and indeed that of authority as such. While we will focus on texts from the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Atlantic world, students with a broader interest in policing are encouraged to enroll. Readings will include Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, Henry Fielding, G.W.F. Hegel, Louis Althusser, and Michel Foucault, in addition to historical documents including gallows narratives, newspapers, and early theorizations of the police concept.

In literature, the course ranges from Jonathan Swift and Maria Edgeworth to Seamus Heaney and Anna Burns, and, in cinema, from silent film to Neil Jordan and Lenny Abramson. Literature and cinema are intertwined through all the weeks of the quarter in various connections (including Hitchcock's adaptation of O'Casey's JUNO AND THE PAYCOCK).

British and Irish Cinema Since 1930. 100 Units.\n\nWe will be screening and discussing key films from almost a century's worth of cinema on the British-Irish archipelago, including works of the early Alfred Hitchcock, Alexander McKendrick, David Lean, Frank Launder, Michael Powell/Emeric Pressburger, Joseph Losey, Ken Loach, Mike Leigh, Stephen Frears, Neil Jordan, Amma Asante, Steve McQueen, and Lenny Abramson. Some priority will be given to films with London settings and locations, such as Frears's My Beautiful Launderette. We may also look at London-based films by non-British directors. Sylvio Narrizaon's George Girl, for example, or Antonioni's Blow-up. Possible field trips include Ealing Studios, site of British cinema for much of the twentieth century, and Hitchcock's studios in Islington, not far from our London Campus, where he worked before his departure for America.\n\nInstructor(s): James Chandler Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): Admission to the London Study Abroad Program\n\nENGL 18600. Zizek on Film. 100 Units.\n\nSlavoj Zizek has used film as the great expositor of his theories of ideology, perversion, sexuality, politics, nostalgia, and otherness. In this discussion-heavy course we will watch a lot of film from the directorial subjects of his main discussions (Chaplin, Rossellini, Lynch, Haneke, Kieślowski, Tarkovsky, von Trier, Hitchcock, and others) alongside Zizek's theoretical writings on their film. The course examines why for the man who has been called the \"Elvis of cultural theory\" film is such a perfect lens through which to examine social situatedness and intersubjective \"aporia.\" There is no \"paperwork\" assigned for the course. The course is conducted seminar style and participants are expected to be vocal, prepared, and somewhat ornery.\n\nInstructor(s): M. Sternstein\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CMST 27201\n\nENGL 19205. Poetry in the Land of Childhood. 100 Units.\n\nCupboards and attics, nests and shells, the inside of a bush, the bottom of a rowboat: for the 20th century philosopher Gaston Bachelard, intimate \"fibred\" spaces like these have a special relation to childhood-both as it is experienced and as it is remembered. Taking the lead from Bachelard this course investigates the construction, beginning in the eighteenth century, of childhood as a particular kind of place, one that might be imaginatively accessed through poetic images, rhythm, and rhyme. Our readings will come from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries-that is, from the birth of children's literature to its \"golden age\"-and will take us from the nursery rhymes and cradle songs of early children's poetry collections, through William Blake's \"forests of the night,\" and to the wonderland of Lewis Carroll's Alice books.

Mary Wollstonecraft and Mary Shelley. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the major works-novels, political treatises, letters, travel essays-of two of Romanticism's most influential women writers. We will attend to historical, intellectual, and cultural contexts as well as matters of literary concern, such as their pioneering development of modes like gothic and science/speculative fiction, Wollstonecraft's stylistic theories, and Shelley's scenes of imaginative sympathy.

Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group. 100 Units.\n\nA controversial art exhibition organized by Roger Fry, \"Manet and the Post-Impressionists,\" provoked Virginia Woolf to write that \"on or about December 1910 human character changed.\" The Bloomsbury Group, renowned for its role in vilifying Victorian culture and promoting English modernism, was no less famous for its own efforts to change human character: for its unprecedented understanding of aesthetics, economics, social politics, and sexuality. Taking advantage of our particular location in London (the neighborhood in which the group lived, met, wrote, and painted), this course will provide the opportunity to engage a broad spectrum of Bloomsbury work: the essays and fiction of Virginia Woolf; the art of Venessa Bell, Duncan Grant, and Roger Fry; the macroeconomics of John Maynard Keynes. This engagement will unfold through different analytics (formalist, psychoanalytic, materialist), and with sustained recognition of two Bloomsbury institutions-the short-lived Omega Workshops, and the enduring Hogarth Press. The British Library and the Tate Modern will provide us with intimate access to literary and visual texts, and we will talk with contemporary writers about the cultural legacy of this coterie.

Comedy from the Margins. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the centrality of normativity to our conceptions of funniness, reading theories of comedy alongside stand-up, sitcoms, dramedy, and romantic comedy. We will ask: in what ways do comedic formulas establish ideas of the \"normal\" in order to subvert (or perhaps reinforce) them? How, does comedy about the \"strange\"-as the foreign, the queer, the excessive or the abject-reframe structures of sociality often taken for granted, forcing us to grapple with questions of citizenship and belonging, gendered and sexual norms, racialization and power? In addition to theories of comedy and joke theory, students will analyze theoretical works on race, gender and sexuality alongside popular television series, talk shows, and comedy specials. Possible texts and comics include: Chewing Gum, Fleabag, Insecure, Reservation Dogs, Ramy, Atlanta, Awkwafina is Nora from Queens, Julio Torres, Hasan Minhaj, Ali Wong, Jacqueline Novak, Dave Chappelle, Hannah Gadsby, and Ronny Chieng.

History of the English Language. 100 Units.\n\nIf you have ever wondered why we say, \"one mouse\" and \"two mice,\" but not \"one house\" and \"two hice,\" this course will offer some answers. We will study the historical development of the English language, from its Proto-Indo-European roots through its earliest recorded forms (Old English, Middle English, and Early Modern English) up to its current status as a world language. Now spoken by more than 1.5 billion people, English is a language that is constantly evolving, and students will gain basic linguistic skills necessary for analyzing the features of its evolution. We will study variations in the language (including variations in morphology, phonology, syntax, grammar, and vocabulary) and its development over time and across regions. We will also examine sociological, political, and literary phenomena that accompany and shape these changes in the language.

London: From Industrial City to Financial Center. 100 Units.\n\nOver the last two centuries, London has undergone two \"revolutions,\" the industrial revolution and the financialization revolution, both of which have had significant impacts on the built landscape and residential patterns of its neighborhoods. Some of the materials we will look at are Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist, George Gissing's The Netherworld, Mike Leigh's High Hopes, John Lanchester's Capital, among other supporting texts (on urban globalization, the poverty maps of Michael Booth).

English Renaissance Verse and the Poetics of Place. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will explore sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English poetry by focusing on the poetic treatments of diverse places, including commercial, legal, and theatrical London venues, courtly palaces, aristocratic country houses and rural estates, churches, prisons, and imaginary landscapes. Poets might include Wyatt, Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare, Donne, Jonson, Herbert, Herrick, Lovelace, Milton, Marvell, Philips, and Cowley. Genres might include sonnet, epithalamion, satire, pastoral, georgic, epistle, epigram, country-house poem, and ode. Trips within and close to London might include the Tower of London, the Whitehall Banqueting House, the Globe Theater, Hampton Court, Penshurst Place, and Knole.

Living (in) London: Human City, Urban Spaces, Metropolitan Encounters. 100 Units.\n\nHow have people inhabited London over time? And how are these varied forms of living reflected in the vast body of texts by writers and film makers who have made London their home? National capital and imperial metropolis, London is also a network of local neighborhoods in which communities have developed over time. In this course we will examine texts by an assortment of Londoners from the 19th and 20th centuries who write about urban sites of human interaction and encounter. Our course will consider London locations as places of compassion, repression, brutality, hospitality and rejection, resistance and compliance, friendship and love. How are these possibilities - both affective and political, personal and public - related to the various environments of the city? How are human relationships shaped by the specific forms of city buildings and institutions? And how have these urban places been impacted by styles of city living, changing populations, and the different communities that have inhabited them? In short, how do Londoners live together? Our texts will include Mary Prince, History of a West Indian Slave, William Blake, Songs of Innocence and Experience, Thomas De Quincey, Confessions of an English Opium Eater, Christina Rossetti, Goblin Market, James Berry, Windrush Songs, Derek Jarman, \"The Last of England\", Steve McQueen, \"Mangrove\", and essays by Michel De Certeau, Henri Lefebvre, and Ghassan Hage.\n\nInstructor(s): Jo McDonagh Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): Admission to the London Program (study abroad) is required.\n\nENGL 20161. 21st Century Ethnic American Literature. 100 Units.\n\nThis class will read US novels and short stories by African-American, American Indian, Asian-American, and Latinx writers from the last twenty years to conceptualize the shifting categories of race and ethnicity, paired with critical and theoretical works in critical cultural race studies.

Eighteenth-Century Black Lives: Black London in and Around Abolition. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will focus on representations of Black life and experience in literature published during the age of the British slave trade and abolition, as well as on more recent writing that seeks to imagine, honor, or reckon with the unrepresented Black lives of this period. During the first two weeks of the course, our reading will center on eighteenth-century writing. Primarily, we will focus on the work of prominent Black writers in London in and around abolition, including the life narratives of the formerly enslaved Olaudah Equiano (1789), Ottobah Cugoano (1787), and Mary Prince (1831), the published letters of Ignatius Sancho (1780), and the poetry of Phillis Wheatley Peters (1773). We may also read selections from white-authored abolitionist poetry, relevant legal cases, as well as the anonymously published novel, The Woman of Colour (1808). In our third week, we will tum to a number of recent works that look back to the eighteenth century in order to reimagine the past and present of Black life in British culture, or to reclaim ·a place in the national imaginary: Honoree Fanonne Jeffers' The Age of Phillis, M. NourbeSe Philip's Zangl, and perhaps a play or two 0asmine Lee-Jones' Curious, Jackie Sibblies Drury's Marys S eacole, Giles Terera's The Meaning of Zon!). We will supplement our reading with selections from historians, cultural theorists, and literary critics (likely to include Paul Gilroy, Christina Sharpe, Simon Gikandi, Peter Fryer, and others).\n\nInstructor(s): Heather Keenleyside Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): Admission to the London Program (study abroad) is required.\n\nENGL 20170. Experiments in Kinship and Care. 100 Units.\n\nIn this class, we'll examine the notions of kinship and care, analyzing them both as conceptual frameworks and as concrete forms of being-together in human and more-than-human relations. Kinship and care are uncertain territories, fluctuating and dynamic; sites of possibility and futurity. Kin-making and care-giving practices reveal existing structures of oppression as well as the utopian possibilities within relation. We'll spend much of our time engaging with a set of \"experiments\" or case studies-historical, science fictional, and critical accounts of community-to see how connection appears as a mode of resistance or survival. Throughout, our collective goal will be to think together about living together. Readings may include SF from Octavia Butler, Claire Coleman, Ursula Le Guin, Wu Ming-Yi; theoretical and critical work from Sara Ahmed, Leela Gandhi, Donna Haraway, Laura Harjo, Saidiya Hartman, Kara Keeling, Audre Lorde, José Esteban Muñoz, Maria Puig de la Bellacasa, Dean Spade, Kim Tallbear, Anna Tsing.\n\nInstructor(s): William Hutchison Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GNSE 41170, ENGL 40170, MAPH 40170, GNSE 21170\n\nENGL 20171. Robots, animals, technologies: Science fiction and the more-than-human. 100 Units.\n\nScience fiction allows encounters with other beings that variously encourage or strain the bonds of kinship, and many of those beings are related to entities with whom we already share a world. From companion animals and modified humans to starfish and androids, estrangement from familiar categories allows us to trouble assumptions about the certainty of species, the superiority of consciousness, and what care looks like in relation with those who may not respond to, recognize, or return care in familiar ways. In this class, we'll look at relations with the more-than-human in the context of urgent and emergent lived experience, in which social, political, and environmental realities require a response that thinks beyond entrenched approaches and takes wild and revolutionary imagination as a reparative possibility. We'll explore these and other questions through science fiction novels, poetry, graphic novels, music, and video (by Octavia Butler, Ursula Le Guin, Vonda McIntyre, Janelle Monae, Grant Morrison, Margaret Rhee, and others). We'll engage with theoretical work on topics including multispecies kinship, race and technology, and non-conscious/non-biological life (by Karen Barad, Beth Coleman, Wendy Chun, Donna Haraway, N. Katherine Hayles, Shannon Mattern, Sophia Roosth, Alan Turing, and others). [Note: this class pairs well with \"Rocks, plants, ecologies: science fiction and the more-than-human\" offered in Spring, and may also be taken as a stand-alone course.]\n\nInstructor(s): William Hutchison Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MAPH 40171, ENGL 40171, MADD 25171\n\nENGL 20180. Women Writing God. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines imaginative works by women that take on the task of representing divine or supernatural being from the medieval era to the present. Drawing on the work of critics such as Luce Irigaray, Caroline Walker Bynum, and Judith Butler, we explore what strategies these writers employ to depict an entity simultaneously understood to be unrepresentable and to have a masculine image. Texts range from premodern mystics such as Julian of Norwich and Teresa of Avila to Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower.

The Gender of Modernity. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the dramatic revisions in gender and sexuality that characterize American modernity. Together, we will read literary texts by women and queer writers to investigate their role in shaping the period's emergent regimes of sex and gender. We'll consider modernist revisions of these concepts for their effect on America's broader social and political terrain and explore the intimate histories they made possible: What new horizons for kinship, care, affect, and the everyday reproduction of life did modernist ideas about sex and gender enable? This class doubles as an advanced introduction to gender and sexuality studies, with a particular emphasis on literary criticism. As we map the contours of a feminist and queer modernity, we will also be staging a series of encounters between our literary objects and influential theoretical texts. In so doing, we will consider a range of methodological orientations - psychoanalytic, queer, Black feminist, Marxist, postcolonial, historicist, and so on - as themselves telling divergent stories about what it means to be a sexed and gendered body in American modernity. Readings may include works by Djuna Barnes, Gwendolyn Brooks, H.D., Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Henry James, Nella Larsen, Gertrude Stein; theoretical and critical work from Lauren Berlant, Leo Bersani, Judith Butler, Hélène Cixous, Lee Edelman, Rita Felski, Jack Halberstam, Saidiya Hartman, Eve Sedgwick, Hortense Spillers, Gayatri Spivak, Alys Weinbaum.\n\nInstructor(s): Agnes Malinowska Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): AMER 40190, GNSE 45150, GNSE 25150, ENGL 40190, MAPH 40190\n\nENGL 20212. Romantic Natures. 100 Units.\n\nOur survey of British Romantic literary culture will combine canonical texts (especially the major poetry) with consideration of the practices and institutions underwriting Romantic engagement with the natural world. We will also address foundational and recent critical-theoretical approaches to the many \"natures\" of Romanticism. Our contextual materials will engage the art of landscape, an influx of exotic and dangerously erotic flora, practices of collection and display, the emergent localism of the naturalist Gilbert White, the emergence of geological \"deep time,\" and the (literal) fruits of empire and vegetarianism.

We will also consider the later prophecies, Milton: A Poem and Jerusalem, along with Blake's work as an illustrator of Milton, Chaucer, and the Bible. Blake's engagement with the political and religious controversies of his time will provide context, along with his pioneering exploration of dialectical modes of thought and radical forms of humanism (Poetry, 1650-1830, Theory; 18th/19th)\n\nInstructor(s): W.

It is also associated with philosophical reflections on the nature of images and their relation to language-the interplay between the \"icon\" and the \"logos.\" A plausible translation of this compound word into Chinese would describe it as \"Words in Pictures, Pictures in Words\": 诗中有画，画中有诗. This seminar will explore the relations of word and image in poetics, semiotics, and aesthetics with a particular emphasis on how texts and pictures have been understood in the Anglo-European-American and Chinese theoretical traditions. The interplay of painting and poetry, speech and spectacle, audition and vision will be considered across a variety of media, particularly the textual and graphic arts. The aims of the course will be 1) to critique the simplistic oppositions between \"East\" and \"West\" that have bedevilled intercultural and intermedial comparative studies; 2) to identify common principles, zones of interaction and translation that make this a vital area of study.

Structural -isms. 100 Units.\n\nWhat does it mean to designate \"structure\" as the operative force in discrimination against categories of person-as in appeals to structural racism or structural violence on the basis of gender? And how can we approach this question by attending to aesthetic uses of structure and form, especially as these have been understood in such paradigms as structuralism and recent literary formalisms? How do we read for structure, in reading for racism and for systemic discrimination on other bases? We'll focus on intersections of race, gender, and class (in U.S. contexts) as these categories have been reconfigured in the past half century or so. To explore appeals to structure, we'll consider definitions of literary and aesthetic form, debates about structure vs. agency, and questions of individual and collective action as mediated by institutions. Readings will balance theory with examples drawn from fiction, documentary film, built form, and other media. Throughout, we'll pay particular attention to problems of structure construed as problems of narrative, as we develop sharper terms for understanding how discrimination proceeds structurally.\n\nInstructor(s): Rowan Bayne Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): Instructor consent required for undergraduates.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MAPH 40141, GNSE 45141, GNSE 25141, CRES 40141, CRES 22141, ENGL 40141\n\nENGL 20250. Means of Production I: Contemporary Literary Publishing (Books) 100 Units.\n\nThis course will introduce students to the aesthetic criteria, cultural and institutional infrastructures, and collaborative practices of literary evaluation in the making of contemporary American poetry. How does a manuscript of poetry 'make it' onto the list of a literary publisher, and from there to the bookshelves of the Seminary Coop? How do individual readers and editorial collectives imagine the work of literary assessment and aesthetic judgment in our time? We will begin the course with a survey of new directions in Anglophone poetry as preparation for an intensive editorial practicum in the evaluation and assessment of literary manuscripts in the second half of the term. Visits with literary editors and authors will offer students opportunities to learn about the field of contemporary literary publishing. Course work will include reviewing and evaluating manuscript submissions to the Phoenix Poets book series at the University of Chicago Press.

Housekeeping: Domestic Drama and Material Culture. 100 Units.\n\nThe theatre represents a new and wildly successful commodity in the early modern English market. Yet it is often kept separate from other fashionable goods of the period by virtue of its intangible form. This course overturns the orthodoxy that an early modern play was a co-imaged event and the early modern theatre was an \"empty space\" by attending to the Renaissance theatre's frequent recourse to household stuff. We will read plays designed for private performance, that use the fixtures of the household to build theatrical worlds. We will investigate dramatists who liken the playhouse to key venues of commodity culture, including the pawnshop, the Exchange (the precedent of the shopping mall), and the fairground. We will draw from Henslowe's Diary to recover the business of theatrical property-making and the allure of a company as disclosed by its holdings. All the while, we will question how the fiction of emptiness takes hold in theatre history, and how plays that depict a furnished world are relegated to second-class genres like domestic tragedy and city comedy.

Coming of Age: Autobiography, Bildungsroman, and Memoir in Victorian Britain and its Empire. 100 Units.\n\nIn this course, we will consider the broad generic category of \"coming of age\" stories that characterized the literary writing of the nineteenth century. Across several different kinds of writing, a focus on the growth and development of the child into adulthood became an obsessive focus. We will read autobiographies by Mill and Martineau, Bildungsroman by Bronte and Eliot, memoirs by Dickens but also lesser known figures: working class autodidacts, women in childbirth, colonial subjects. We will, along the way, learn more about Victorian childhood, the emergence of developmental psychology, psychoanalysis, and the socio-psychological \"invention\" of adolescence.

Unladylike Conduct on Stage and Page in Early Modern England. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will move between three sites of inquiry to investigate the social and material history of an evergreen trope: the domestication of a refractory servant or wife. From rare book libraries and museum collections, we will track the common features of popular entertainments that traffic in this scenario. We will then bring our findings to bear in a theatre lab environment, where we will assay scenes from The Taming of the Shrew, The Tamer Tamed, and the City Madam.

Autofiction. 100 Units.\n\nThe last twenty years in American letters has exhibited a turn toward autofiction: works of literature at least in part fictitious in which the protagonist and narrator bear the same name as the author (and some of the latter's history). This course investigates this turn by way of a number of exemplary literary texts (those of John Edgar Wideman, Philip Roth, and Sheila Heti, among others) while investigating the workings of the parts of speech on which it seemingly turns: \"I.\" (1880-1990, Fiction; 20th/21st)\n\nInstructor(s): Joshua Kates Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ENGL 30420\n\nENGL 20422. Black Girlhood. 100 Units.\n\nFirst popularized on social media in 2013, the phrase \"Black Girl Magic\" has expanded far beyond its initial use as a twitter hashtag. It can be seen on (a bunch of different objects and the cover of many children's books and poetry anthologies). However, the visibility of the phrase did not come without controversy. Some critics argued that rather than being an uplifting rallying cry for positive depictions of black girlhood, it instead reinforced dehumanizing stereotypes of the \"strong black woman\". This debate leads us to question: How do black girls tend to be depicted both popular media and in literature? How might these depictions differ depending on author, type of media, or social context? What do they say about the ways that black girls experience childhood, gender, and friendship? To engage with these questions, this course will explore literary works including The Bluest Eye, Betsey Brown, and Abeng, along with television shows such as Lovecraft Country to examine 20th and 21st century depictions of black girlhood. We will also think with theoretical works of black feminism and black girlhood studies.\n\nInstructor(s): Danielle Jones Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ENGL 30422, RDIN 20400, GNSE 33167, RDIN 30400, GNSE 23167\n\nENGL 20458. Faeries, Demons and Alchemists: Science, Magic and the Supernatural in Early Modern England. 100 Units.\n\nThis course aims to explore the messy territory between the scientific, the magical and the religious in the sixteenth and seventeenth century. Readings will draw on scholarship in the history of science, by writers such as Frances Yates and Steven Shapin, and on period reflections on the pursuit of knowledge by thinkers such as Francis Bacon, Thomas Browne Margaret Cavendish and Robert Boyle, as well as representations of occult knowledge in the period's literature. Readings may include Marlowe's Doctor Faustus, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Jonson's The Alchemist, selections from Spenser's The Faerie Queene, and Bacon's The New Atlantis.

What does it mean to periodize a Western cultural past in this way, or to be founding a Renaissance in the present? Readings will include seminal accounts of the Renaissance by thinkers such as Jacob Burkhardt, Aby Warburg, Paul Oscar Kristeller and Joan Kelly, as well as contemporary cultural objects ranging from the film Shakespeare in Love to the fiction of Hilary Mantel and work in the visual arts by artists such as Kehinde Wiley and Harmonia Rosales.

The Lives of Others. 100 Units.\n\nHow much can you ever really know someone else? In this course, we take up the inscrutability of others through a range of narratives about - politically, socially, and geographically - distant others from the early 20th century. Texts include fiction, documentary film, and critical theory around transnationalism, contact zones and ethnography). Some of these texts meditate on the general problem of living with others. Others take on the limits of empathy, access, and friendship whether explicitly or in their formal arrangement. Specifically, we focus on works that engage with an ethics or \"work on the self\" as a preliminary to having knowledge of others. We will be guided by primary readings that likely include Claude Levi-Strauss, Kazuo Ishiguro, Werner Herzog, Maggie Nelson, Amitav Ghosh, and J.M. Coetzee.

Postcolonial Aesthetics. 100 Units.\n\nWhat do we mean by the \"postcolonial aesthetic\"? In this course, we read and think through the literary and conceptual resources that might help us reconstruct this notion - from Deepika Bahri, to Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin. Our goal is to attend to \"the aesthetic\" as an experience that reshapes subjectivity in terms of our relation to ourselves and others. By engaging with twentieth-century novels, memoir, and film, we consider how this postcolonial aesthetic might function. What habituated forms of perception or common sense notions does it seek to interrupt? What ways of sensing and living does it offer? Readings will likely include Ashis Nandy, Deepika Bahri, Theodor Adorno, Derek Walcott, Frantz Fanon, Arundhati Roy, and Jean Rhys.

Minds, Brains, and the Contemporary Novel. 100 Units.\n\nAround the turn into the twenty-first century, psychology \"went neurological\": human struggles that had long been viewed as expressions of complex inner conflicts and interpersonal dynamics began more and more to be described, and treated, as forms of brain disease. A 2009 essay, \"The Rise of the Neuro-Novel,\" worried about ways this shift might wreak havoc on the fiction-writer's art. More recently, however, theories of neurodivergence have pushed back against some of the pathologizing language of abnormal psychiatry, while pop-Freudian stories of trauma seem omnipresent in novels, TV, and film.\n\nInstructor(s): Jennifer Fleissner Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ENGL 30660\n\nENGL 20707. Dramaturgy: Theory & Practice. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is a deep investigation into the possibility of dramaturgy as intrepid and curious storytelling and the role of the dramaturg in building worlds with playwrights, inhabiting worlds with productions, and cultivating worlds with audiences and institutions. We will think across discipline about the methodologies that make dramaturgy a heuristic knowledge practice. We will think critically about existing genealogies, best practices, and innovations in the theatre industry. Most importantly, we will engage in our own civic-minded dramaturgical practice and how engaged, thoughtful storytelling might have impacts beyond the walls of the classroom and the theatre.

Film and Fiction. 100 Units.\n\nThis course addresses three distinct but related critical problems in the contemporary understanding of film and fiction. The most general is the question of how we might go about linking the practice of criticism in the literary arts with that of the screen arts. Where are the common issues of structure, form, narration, point of view management, and the like? Where, on the other hand, are the crucial differences that lie in the particularities of each domain-the problem that some have labeled \"medium specificity\" in the arts? The second problem has to do more specifically with questions of adaptation. Adaptation is a fact of our cultural experience that we encounter in many circumstances, but perhaps in non more insistently as when we witness the reproduction of a literary narrative in cinematic or televisual form? Adaptation theory has taught us to look beyond the narrow criterion of \"fidelity\" a far too limiting in scope? But when we look beyond, what do we look for, and what other concepts guide our exploration? The third and final problem has to do with the now rampant genre of the \"film based on fact,\" especially when the facts derive from a particular source text, as in the recent case of Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman? What has this genre become so popular? What are its particular genre markings (e.g., excessive stylization, the use of documentary footage of the actual persons and events involved)? How does fictionalization operate on the facts in particular cases?\n\nInstructor(s): James Chandler Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): Students enrolled in the course will be expected to attend screenings and participate in class discussions.

The Adventures of Augie March. 100 Units.\n\nCourt Theatre has commissioned Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award-winning playwright David Auburn, AB'91, to write a stage adaptation of Saul Bellow's novel of mid-century Chicago, The Adventures of Augie March. Students in this course will assist in the dramaturgical preparations for the Spring 2019 premiere of Auburn's work, and in so doing acquire hands-on experience of the techniques involved in bringing literary works to stage. They will engage in close readings of the novel and its relationship to drafts of the script, examine how Bellow drew from his own coming-of-age experiences as an immigrant in Depression-era Chicago to create the character of Augie March, and seek out primary source materials at libraries and museums throughout the city to help contextualize the work for the director, actors, costume and sound designers. Guest lectures will include David Auburn, Court Theatre Artistic Director Charles Newell, and Dr. Peter Alter, Curator of the Studs Terkel Oral History Center.\n\nInstructor(s): N.

Then we will consider the complex set of plots and their relation to each other. Other questions: how does the book represent itself as a model for the novel as a genre? Where does it fit in Eliot's career? \"There will be unexpected questions.

We examine how different instances of the genre play across tropes of aesthetic education, self-making, and nation-building. Readings will likely include Conrad's Lord Jim, E.M. Forster's A Passage to India, Olive Schreiner's Story of an African Farm, and Tsitsi Dangarembga's Nervous Conditions, as well as key critical pieces by Mikhail Bakhtin, Marc Redfield, and Jed Esty, among others.\n\nInstructor(s): Darrel Chia Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MAPH 40202, ENGL 40202\n\nENGL 21215. Hamlet: Adventures of a Text. 100 Units.\n\nAfter a lifetime with Hamlet, I've become increasingly interested by the fluidity of the text: not only is there much too much of it, but there are also significant differences between the 2nd Quarto and the Folio-to say nothing of the 1st quarto. Nevertheless, there is (in my mind at least) no question that we have Hamlet! I intend with this class to explore the play in quest (as it were) of the essential Hamlet, reflecting on its contradictions, shifting perspectives, puzzles. For instance: why doesn't Hamlet go back to Wittenburg-is it his ambition, his mother, his sense that he has to deal with his uncle, or is it something else? Is Hamlet mad or feigning or something in between? Is he changed by his adventure with the pirates? Etc. We will use both volumes of the Arden 3rd edition. First, we'll spend some weeks going through the Folio text scene by scene, then we'll tackle the 1st Quarto, inquiring into Shakespeare's creative process and his relation to actual production. Some attention will be given also to the history of the reception of Hamlet. Instruction by discussion; final paper preceded by required submission of a project and opportunity to submit a draft for comments.\n\nInstructor(s): J.

What theories, resources, and models of personal, psychoanalytic, legal, political repair are available, and what kinds of possibilities do they enable? Is repair even a possibility, or a useful framework, for change? This course tracks the question of repair through contemporary conversations and historical case studies. Reading works by Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein, Eve Ensler, Saidiya Hartman, Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò, Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang, we will track how the concept of repair and reparation has motivated political action, activism, economic decision-making, artistic creativity and interpersonal ritual. We will read poems, engage performances, and consider other rituals of repair, breaking, and re-making. In addition, we will read literary and activist material pertinent to historical movements for reparations, including works from the Redress Movement for Japanese Internment in Canada and the United States and ongoing projects of the repatriation of Indigenous archival and cultural materials.\n\nInstructor(s): Bellamy Mitchell Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RDIN 21300, ENGL 31302, RDIN 31300\n\nENGL 21360. Gender, Capital, and Desire: Jane Austen and Critical Interpretation. 100 Units.\n\nToday, Jane Austen is one of the most famous (perhaps the most famous), most widely read, and most beloved of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British novelists. In the 200 years since her authorial career, her novels have spawned countless imitations, homages, parodies, films, and miniseries - not to mention a thriving \"Janeite\" fan culture. For just as long, her novels have been the objects of sustained attention by literary critics, theorists, and historians. For example, feminist scholars have long been fascinated by Austen for her treatments of feminine agency, sociality, and desire. Marxists read her novels for the light they shed on an emergent bourgeoisie on the eve of industrialization. And students of the \"rise of the novel\" in English are often drawn to Austen as an innovator of new styles of narration and a visionary as to the potentials of the form. This course will offer an in-depth examination of Austen, her literary corpus, and her cultural reception as well as a graduate-level introduction to several important schools of critical and theoretical methodology. We will read all six of Austen's completed novels in addition to criticism spanning feminism, historicism, Marxism, queer studies, postcolonialism, and psychoanalysis. Readings may include pieces by Sara Ahmed, Frances Ferguson, William Galperin, Deidre Lynch, D.A. Miller, Edward Said, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and Raymond Williams.

Ships, Tyrants, and Mutineers. 100 Units.\n\nSince the Renaissance beginnings of the \"age of sail,\" the ship has been one of literature's most contested, exciting, fraught, and ominous concepts. Ships are, on the one hand, globe-traversing spaces of alterity and possibility that offer freedom from the repression of land-based systems of power. And they are Michel Foucault's example of the heterotopia par excellence. From Lord Byron to Herman Melville to Anita Loos, the ship has been conceived as a site of queerness and one that puts great pressure on normative constructions of gender. At the same time, the ship has been a primary mechanism for the brutality of empire and hegemony of capital, the conduit by which vast wealth has been expropriated from the colony, military domination projected around the world, and millions of people kidnapped and enslaved. Indeed, the horror of the \"Middle Passage\" of the Atlantic slave trade has been a major focus of inquiry for theorists like Paul Gilroy and Hortense Spillers, interrogating how concepts of racial identity and structures of racism emerge out of oceanic violence. In the 20th and 21st centuries, science-fiction writers have sent ships deep into outer space, reimagining human social relations and even humans-as-species navigating the stars. While focusing on the Enlightenment and 19th century, we will examine literary and filmic texts through the present that have centered on the ship, as well as theoretical texts that will help us to deepen our inquiries.

Futures Other Than Ours: Science Fiction and Utopia. 100 Units.\n\nScience fiction is often mistaken for a variety of futurism, extrapolating what lies ahead. This class will consider what kind of relationship science fiction might have to the future other than prediction, anticipation, optimism or pessimism. How might science fiction enable thinking or imaging futures in modes other than those available to liberalism (progress, reproduction, generation) or neoliberalism (speculation, anticipation, investment)? This class asks how science fiction constitutes its horizons, where and how difference emerges in utopias, and what it might be to live in a future that isn't ours. Readings may include SF works by Delany, Le Guin, Russ, Butler, Robinson, Banks, Ryman, Jones; theoretical and critical readings by Bloch, Jameson, Suvin, Munoz, Murphy, and others.\n\nInstructor(s): Hilary Strang Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): Email the instructor directly for consent.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ENGL 41420, MAPH 41400\n\nENGL 21644. American Muckrakers: The Literature of Exposé, 1900/2000. 100 Units.\n\nThis seminar examines the genre of American \"muckraking,\" a form of journalism and fiction intended to expose social and economic injustices. We attend, in particular, to writers active in the years surrounding 1900, when muckraking narratives enjoyed great social influence, and then turn to the new crop of prominent muckrakers that emerged around 2000. In coining the term \"muck-rake\" in a 1906 speech, President Theodore Roosevelt linked the genre's aesthetic deficiencies to a potentially dangerous political impact: Its tendency towards \"hysteric sensationalism\" threatened to provoke a \"morbid and vicious public sentiment\" marked by cynical apathy. Though we may not end up agreeing with Roosevelt, the seminar picks up his emphasis on the relationship between the aesthetics and politics of exposé in our examination of muckraking media. We will discuss the narrative strategies of a genre often designated as \"bad\" literature, focusing, in particular, on the link between its purported aesthetic deficiencies-populism, sentimentalism, melodrama, sensationalism-and its political mission. Last but certainly not least, this seminar situates muckraking narratives in their historical contexts-what they hoped to expose, why, and what impact they ended up having. Texts in this course may include the work of: Upton Sinclair, Ida Tarbell, Jacob Riis, Ray Stannard Baker, Frank Norris, Lincoln Steffens, Barbara Ehrenreich, Eric Schlosser, Naomi Klein, Michael Moore, and Laurie Garrett.\n\nInstructor(s): Agnes Malinowska Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ENGL 41644, MAPH 41600\n\nENGL 21690. Empire and the Novel. 100 Units.\n\nThis course investigates how the rise of the nineteenth-century British novel is intimately linked to the expansion of the British Empire. Many understand that this empire was based on unfair trade relations, indigenous genocide, and the exploitative labor of millions, but it can be difficult at times to see how this atrocious history fits into the domestic and metropolitan realism of the novel. How does the practice of imperialism impact the conventions of domestic fiction? How are the novel's constructions of gender, race, and class related to the political status of colonized and enslaved peoples? Our focus will be to connect narrative form with the realities of imperialism and colonial rule, but we will also draw on other genres of nineteenth-century cultural production such as autobiography, visual art, and political essays in order to help us trace the sociopolitical conditions that made empire possible. Fictional readings may include work by Charlotte Brontë, Wilkie Collins, George Eliot, Olive Schreiner, and others. Non-fictional readings may include work by Aimé Césaire, Franz Fanon, Saidiya Hartman, Karl Marx, Mary Jane Seacole, Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak.

This course investigates the racial roots of the development of citizenship within nineteenth- and twentieth- century histories of slavery, colonialism, migration, eugenics, and miscegenation, with primary focus on the novel. To be a 'citizen' means to claim political belonging in a particular nation-state, but the status of one's racial identity complicates one's access to the rights and privileges that citizenship presupposes. In this course, we trace how the construction of race is integral to the varied meanings of citizenship's lexicon: individual and collective identities, kinship, self-determination, subjectivity, nationhood. Along the way, we will examine the ways that the novel makes visible radical forms of memory, affect, intergenerational forms of connection, and other practices that exceed racialized definitions of the 'citizen' and civic inclusion. Our focus will be to connect narrative form with the realities of racialized citizenship, but we will also draw on other genres of cultural production such as autobiography, visual art, and political essays in order to help us trace the sociopolitical connections between race and citizenship.\n\nInstructor(s): Rebeca Velasquez Terms Offered: Spring\n\nENGL 21710. Rocks, plants, ecologies: science fiction and the more-than-human. 100 Units.\n\nScience fictional worlds are full of entities more familiar and perhaps less noticeable than the aliens that are often thought to typify the genre. Rock formations, plants, metallic seams, plastics, crystalline structures, nuclear waste and oozing seepages are among the entities that allow SF to form estranging questions about what it means to be in relation to others, what it means to live in and through an environment, and what it means to form relations of sustenance and communal possibility with those who do not or cannot return human care and recognition. Such questions about are urgent ones for thinking about climate catastrophe, capital, settler colonialism and endemic pandemics, as well as for thinking substantively about resistance and what life and livable worlds beyond the bleak horizons of the capitalocene could be. This class will engage science fiction (authors may include Ursula Le Guin, Vonda McIntyre, Nalo Hopkinson, Jeff Vandermeer and others) and environmental and social theory of various kind (authors may include Elizabeth Povinelli, Eduardo Kohn, James C. Scott, David Graeber, Jasper Bernes, Max Liboiron, Michele Murphy and others).\n\nInstructor(s): Hilary Strang Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): MAPH 41710, CEGU 21710, ENGL 41710\n\nENGL 21720.
