        "text": "ENG 0701. Introduction to Academic Discourse. 4 Credit Hours.\n\nEnglish 0701 focuses on writing within a single theme, working on ungraded multiple drafts for assignments, developing skills in summary and textual support presented in appropriate context. Students create a portfolio of their work, including at least four sequenced assignments that culminate in a final project that pulls together critical and literary texts. Multiple individual conferences with the instructor. NOTE: Students placed in English 0701 must earn a final grade of C- or higher in order to be eligible to enroll in English 0802 or English 0812.

Introduction to Academic Discourse ESL. 4 Credit Hours.\n\nThe guidelines for English 0701 are followed in this course, but in the ESL writing classroom there are cross-cultural implications both of what it means to do academic work and also what it means to share historical and cultural knowledge. Oral participation is encouraged as a way of developing fluency and enhancing comfort with participation in American academic settings. Classes are smaller than in English 0701, and teachers spend extended time in tutorial conferences with students. NOTE: English 0711 is designed to accommodate the needs of the ESL learner.

English 0802 takes a broader perspective than 0701 (formerly 0040), requiring students to explore a single theme from the point of multiple disciplines. Early in the semester, English 0802 students work on research and the evaluation of sources, moving through a sequence of papers that develop argumentation and the synthesis of materials. Library research is required, and sessions with librarians are part of the course. Individual and small group conferences will be held during the semester. Evaluation is predicated on a passing final portfolio of at least four assignments that are developed through multiple revisions.

Language in Society. 3 Credit Hours.\n\nHow did language come about? How many languages are there in the world? How do people co-exist in countries where there are two or more languages? How do babies develop language? Should all immigrants take a language test when applying for citizenship? Should English become an official language of the United States? In this course we will address these and many other questions, taking linguistic facts as a point of departure and considering their implications for our society. Through discussions and hands-on projects, students will learn how to collect, analyze, and interpret language data and how to make informed decisions about language and education policies as voters and community members.

Representing Race. 3 Credit Hours.\n\nFrom classical Greeks and Romans, who saw themselves under siege by the \"barbarian hordes,\" to contemporary America and its war on \"Islamic extremism,\" from \"The Birth of a Nation\" to \"Alien Nation,\" Western societies have repeatedly represented some group of people as threats to civilization. This course will examine a wide range of representations of non-Western people and cultures in film, literature, scientific and legal writings, popular culture and artistic expression. What is behind this impulse to divide the world into \"us\" and \"them\"? How is it bound up with our understanding of race and racial difference? And what happens when the \"barbarian hordes\" talk back? NOTE: This course fulfills the Race & Diversity (GD) requirement for students under GenEd and Studies in Race (RS) for students under Core.

Eating Cultures. 3 Credit Hours.\n\nYou are what you eat, they say, but what, precisely, determines our eating habits and what, exactly, do they say about us? How do these habits influence our relations with others in our communities and beyond? Eating is an activity common to all human beings, but how do the particularities and meanings attributed to this activity vary across different times and places? Using literature, visual media, cookbooks, food-based art, and advertisements as our starting point, we will examine how food perception, production, preparation, consumption, exchange, and representation structure individual and communal identities, as well as relations among individuals and communities around the globe. Our focus on this most basic of needs will allow us to analyze how food conveys and limits self-expression and creates relationships as well as delimits boundaries between individuals and groups. Materials will be drawn from a wide range of disciplines including, but not limited to, literary and gender studies, psychology, anthropology, history, sociology, and economics.

Study the story and development of dissent in America. How has dissent shaped American society? In addition to studying the historical antecedents of dissent students will have first-hand experience visiting and studying a present-day dissent organization in the Philadelphia area to investigate connections between the history of dissent and the process of making dissenting opinion heard today. NOTE: This course fulfills the U.S. Society (GU) requirement for students under GenEd and American Culture (AC) for students under Core.

Why care about College: Higher Education in American Life. 3 Credit Hours.\n\nYou have decided to go to college. But why? What role will college and in particular Temple University play in your life? Reflect on this important question by looking at the relationship between higher education and American society. What do colleges and universities contribute to our lives? They are, of course, places for teaching and learning. They are also research centers, sports and entertainment venues, sources of community pride and profit, major employers, settings for coming-of-age rituals (parties, wild times, courtship, etc.), and institutions that create lifetime identities and loyalties. Learn how higher education is shaped by the larger society and how, in turn, it has shaped that society. Become better prepared for the world in which you have chosen to live for the next few years. NOTE: This course fulfills the U.S. Society (GU) requirement for students under GenEd and American Culture (AC) for students under Core.

The Detective Novel. 3 Credit Hours.\n\nThe detective novel remains the most popular of literary forms since its American origins in Edgar Allan Poe. The form has spread to virtually every part of the world, taking on different perspectives in the different societies where it has prospered. Our course analyzes the global travels of this prolific literary genre, paying particular attention to the manner in which its formula of crime-detection-resolution has evolved from its classic phase in the Sherlock Holmes mysteries, to its hard-boiled phase in the 1940's US, to the transformation of the private detective working outside the formal apparatus of the law into the police detective working within the law in places as different as Sweden, Holland, Nigeria, and India. We will read bestselling detective novels by figures such as Emile Gaboriau, Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, Wilkie Collins, Agatha Christie, Raymond Chandler, Jorge Borges (Argentina), Vikram Chandra (India), Henning Mankell (Sweden), Janwillem van de Wetering (Holland), Kole Omotosho (Nigeria), and Soji Shimada (Japan). We will pay special attention to the conventions of the form and analyze its evolution as it travels the world. In exploring its global travels, we will attend to a number of issues, including: the changing definition of crime; the evolving representation of the criminal; the changing methods for \"solving\" the crime; the ideology of justice; the conflicts between community and individuality; and the varying social and national anxieties that the form reveals.

Honors Women in Modern Bengali Film. 3 Credit Hours.\n\nWe will discuss the work of contemporary Bengali film directors, as also that of a few non-Bengali directors of parallel and diasporic cinema, with a particular focus on culturally constructed roles for women in the Indian social context. The several films that we view in class, to analyze women's movements out of such prescribed spaces into more liberating ones, will focus on assault; incest as taboo; the predicaments of the subaltern, the prostitute, and the widow; and the more recent issue of immigration. How do questions we raise in our course intersect with current international discussions of the treatment of women and class in film? Is the work done by women's activist groups changing entrenched perceptions of gender worldwide and, thus, representations of women in film? What is the impact of significant events in Indian colonial and postcolonial history on women? How do key concepts addressed by major Western thinkers such as Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud affect depictions of women in cinema? You will look up websites on cinema and do group oral presentations to engage directly with these questions.

Honors Transnational Cinema. 3 Credit Hours.\n\nAs he recently commented on the sad state of globalized affairs in which \"the cosmopolitanism of international filmmaking is matched by the parochialism of American film culture,\" New York Times film critic A.O. Scott asked, \"The whole world is watching, why aren't Americans?\" This course will use Scott's question as a point of departure to investigate the ostensible reasons why Americans, or in our case, Philadelphians, aren't watching \"transnational cinema\" - international films that gain distribution outside of their country of production, and that depict transnational movements of people, capital, and social values. Are transnational films playing at a theatre near you? Perhaps they are, but if not, why not? Which \"foreign films\" are allowed to cross the border into our country? How, when, and where do we get to \"see the world\" and why does that matter in today's globalized, interconnected world? Learn \"how to see the world\" - not as a one-dimensional quaint or exotic representation of the \"other\" - but instead through the ways in which these films engage critical contemporary issues of nation, transnation, and globalization in an increasingly interconnected transnational public sphere.
