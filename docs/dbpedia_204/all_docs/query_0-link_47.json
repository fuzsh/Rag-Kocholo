        "text": "Memorandum submitted by the British Film Institute\n\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.1 The Select Committee will be enquiring into all aspects of the British film industry and British film including the performance of the Film Council in promoting both a sustainable industry and awareness of and access to the moving image.\n\n1.2 The British Film Institute (reporting to and funded by the Film Council) is the national body which:\n\n ensures UK audiences gain access to the full range of the history and heritage of British and international cinema;\n\n creates opportunities for UK citizens to understand and appreciate film through the generation and dissemination of knowledge about film; and\n\n promotes the use of film history in understanding identity, representation, culture and creativity.\n\n1.3 The written evidence provided by the British Film Institute therefore deals primarily with the following question:\n\n\"What has the [Film] Council contributed to education about, and access to the moving image? What should the Council do with the bfi and the Museum of the Moving Image?\"\n\n1.4 Our evidence supports our belief that through our products and services we play a directand essentialpart in helping create a cultural and educational environment which supports the British film industry and thereby contributes to the wider economy.\n\n1.5 Our commitment remains to develop the function served previously by the Museum of the Moving Image (MoMI) in a way which reflects the expectations of audiences of the 21st century. The creation of a new Film Centre provides us with the opportunity to transform and enhance the experience of the culture of film in a dynamic new environment. The Film Centre will house changing and travelling exhibitions that will excite, empower and enthuse audiences not only in London but throughout the UK.\n\n1.6 The bfi recognises that it must embrace the new technologies of digital access and delivery as the most effective and democratic ways of making film culture available to everybody in the nation.\n\n2. INTRODUCTION\n\n2.1 This evidence relates to the British Film Institute's primary activity of providing education and access to the moving image. It responds to those parts of the Committee's inquiry concerning the Institute, the former Museum of the Moving Image and both education and access to moving image culture.\n\n2.2 We believe that through our products and services we play a directand indirectpart in helping to create a cultural and educational environment which supports the British film industry and contributes to the wider economy. The range of our activities is not always fully appreciated, and the description of our remit that follows may also be useful.\n\n3. THE BRITISH FILM INSTITUTE AND FILM CULTURE\n\nFilm culture\n\n3.1 The British Film Institute was created over 70 years ago, by Royal Charter, with the simple aims (a) to ensure UK audiences gain access to the full range of the history of heritage of British and International cinema, (b) to develop opportunities for UK citizens to understand and appreciate film through the generation and dissemination of knowledge about film and the film industry and (c) to promote the use of film history in understanding identity, representation, culture and creativity.\n\n3.2 Since then, generations of film-makers have testified that they were introduced to world cinema, educated in film history and culture and inspired in their creativity by seeing films at the National Film Theatre and the London Film Festival. Enhancing the cultural and creative life of the nation is a vital role, and one that directly supports the making of distinctive British films and developing new audiences with an appetite for them.\n\n3.3 The activities we run as an Institute have a fundamental impact on the quality of life of our citizens.\n\n3.4 Film is an immensely powerful medium which helps shape the way we see and understand the world. Cinema informs, inspires and challenges people, as well as entertaining them. A hundred years after its invention, cinema has established itself as the most powerful means of communication we haveto entertain, express ideas and to educate. The appeal of film is universal and located as it is, in the heart of a rapidly expanding range of moving image media, it has acquired a significant economic importance. Film represents a growing and central part of the UK's creative industries.\n\n3.5 Hollywood's extraordinary dominance in the field of filmed entertainment goes on intensifying. It raises the very real prospect of a fundamental dislocation between the world of imagination, created by the moving image, and the everyday lives of people around the globe. The bfi is uniquely positioned to create an appetite for a wider diet of film.\n\n3.6 Understanding and appreciating the arts, including the art of film, is integral to our sense of being a civilized nation. We believe that film is the most important art form of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Film reflects lives, experiences and social history. It informs and influences the way we see our own country and the world. Cinema takes from every other art form. The British Film Institute can link the worlds of leisure, education, culture and art. We represent both the contemporary and the historical and combine intellectual quality with accessibility. Everything we do is to help open up the real magic of the moving image to UK audiences.\n\nThe British Film Institute\n\n3.7 The British Film Institute (bfi) is a unique, world-class organisation dedicated to promoting greater understanding, appreciation and access to film and television culture. Established in 1933, we are partly funded through grant-in-aid from the Film Council (£14.5 million per annum) and -significantlygenerate the remainder of our income (£13 million) through our own activities and through donations. The bfi is a registered charity and in addition to the Funding Agreement with the Film Council, is governed by a Royal Charter.\n\n3.8 The Chief Executive Officer and his Executive colleagues are accountable to a 15-strong Board of Governors, chaired by film director Anthony Minghella. (A list of Governors is at Appendix A). The diagram below shows the relationship between the British Film Institute, the Film Council and the DCMS.\n\n3.9 Hierarchy of relationship between British Film Institute, Film Council, and Department of Culture Media and Sport\n\n3.10 We employ 508 members of staff in three locations: the Archive at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire (including the special storage facility at Gaydon, Lighthorn, Warwickshire); at the National Film Theatre and the bfi London Imax Cinema on London's South Bank; and at the headquarters building (which also houses the bfi National Library) in central London. (A list of facts and figures about the British Film Institute is at Appendix B).\n\n3.11 Our vision is to be the world's leading organisation dedicated to the arts of film and television, and one of the top 10 cultural organisations in the United Kingdom. We exist to stimulate this and future generations of critically aware, and educationally informed, audiences. In our striving for this, and to deliver our objectives, we offer a range of activities and services, which can be grouped under the three banners of conservation, access and education.\n\n4. CONSERVATION\n\nWe conserve, strengthen and make accessible the largest archive of film and television materials in the world\n\n4.1 We manage the National Film and Television Archive, based at the J Paul Getty Conservation Centre at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. Here we carry out the vital work of preserving one of the world's largest and longest-established collections of film and television material. We are responsible for holding the national collection of British produced or British related film, television programmes and video recordings of all kinds exhibited or transmitted in the UK. We have key relationships with the regional archives. The bfi is held in high esteem world-wide for the way we preserve, archive, restore and make available material from our collections to audiences around the UK and, indeed, around the world.\n\n4.2 Preservation and restoration are, however, expensive and detailed processes. The conservation of these hundreds of thousands of items, consisting of material which decays easily and whose formats change frequently, while acquiring some 3,500 further items each year, is a financial and management challenge.\n\n4.3 We also have over seven million images in our care, 30,000 film posters and 4,000 designs for costumes and film sets. These collections, too, grow with every passing year.\n\n5. ACCESS\n\nWe provide a comprehensive and stimulating programme of films, exhibitions, publications, displays and activities\n\n5.1 We broaden access to non-mainstream cinema by releasing films in cinemas and on video and DVD. We run the National Film Theatre, which shows more than 1,000 titles a year and hosts a range of events with film-makers, critics and writers to complement screenings. We also run the bfi London Imax Cinema, which has around 350,000 visitors a year to see the mix of 2D, 3D, 35 mm and 70mm films.\n\n5.2 Regional delivery of our cultural and educational remit through exhibition and distribution is important to us. We are currently working closely with the Film Council to help rationalise a specialised distribution and exhibition strategy.\n\n5.3 Each November we organise the London Film Festival, Britain's biggest film event. We also organise the annual London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival and others. Highlights from the festivals tour to dozens of cities around the UK as part of our commitment to attaining regional reach of our services and providing the widest possible opportunities for people to see new and classic non-mainstream films.\n\n5.4 We are increasingly using our website and other digital programmes to help develop online access to our collections. More traditionally, we also mount a variety of displays and exhibitions to enable the public to see and study items including costumes, props, photographs, papers and posters. At our headquarters office, books, papers and extensive related collections (for example, designs, annotated scripts and photographs) are available for private and commercial research, and people can also view films for research purposes in our two viewing theatres or nine viewing cubicles.\n\nProviding access to our collection of films, television programmes and other materials\n\n5.5 We provide a wide range of opportunities for people to gain access to our moving image collections. We release films in cinemas around the UK as well as in our own NFT and Imax cinemaswe have a core of 200 UK venues and 400 film societies screening our films, and an increasing presence in galleries, museums, educational organisations and other spaces. We sell and rent videos and DVDs in all major retail outlets, specialist shops and by mail order/ online; organise nationwide festivals and international tours; accommodate research visits; offer membership of our Library; and mount a variety of displays and exhibitions of our material. Our collections are increasingly being made available to view, and learn more about, online.\n\n5.6 Looking to the future, our plans for the new Film Centre to be built in the South Bank area of London, will give the bfi opportunities to transform and enhance the experience of the culture of film, to present our object collection, and to provide opportunities to engage with the kind of audiences the Museum of the Moving Image was intended to attract. To be specific, the Film Centre will provide a range of activities that engage with day-time, family, young people and children audiences who could be better served.\n\n5.7 We are planning to create a dynamic new environment for the twenty first century. With the introduction of free entry at National Museums, it would be increasingly difficult to operate a charging attraction like MoMI. However it is our intention to house a number of changing exhibitions in the new Centre which all share a common purpose: to excite, empower, inform and enthuse our audiences. The new building will enable us to provide greater access to our material, tied in to seasons in our cinemas and education events, in a comprehensive, integrated way.\n\n5.8 The core elements of the Film Centre will include:\n\n A new and enlarged bfi National Film Theatre providing audiences with access to a range of film from the UK, Europe and around the world.\n\n The bfi Education Complex offering a state of the art environment for learning about film and the moving image at all levels and drawing on the superb resources of the bfi. This will encompass a Library, including a mediatheque, as well as an Education Suite with fully equipped teaching spaces.\n\n Interactive exhibition spaces drawing on the bfi's unique collections and using digital technologies to celebrate the past, present and future of the moving image.\n\n5.9 Our plans to create a new national resource, to 21st century standards, are ambitious and will be financially challenging.\n\nMaking our Archive film and television material available\n\n5.10 Access to our collections is considerably greater than for any other international archive and we achieve this in a number of ways. We draw upon material from the Archive when programming NFT seasons and other festivals. Almost three quarters of the material in the Archive is non-fiction and is not therefore in great demand for public exhibition but we try to reach an acceptable mix in balancing cultural and commercial objectives.\n\n5.11 However, we are increasingly making this non-fiction, educational material available by way of our digitisation strategyfor broadband delivery to schools, public libraries and regional film archives, which we intend to launch shortly; by internet; through video and DVD sales; and through sales to television, as well as by the traditional primary research on the bfi premises. Furthermore, our video and DVD Archive Television series allows nationwide access to our television holdings.\n\n5.12 Recent restorations of films, which have been exhibited in the UK and toured internationally have include Napoleon, The Magic Box and South. Footage from South has also been used for a number of polar exploration documentaries, and for an Imax film.\n\n5.13 Through our Archive Specials at the NFT series, we specifically showcase rare and unknown material from our Archive, fully contextualised by expert guest presenters.\n\nMaking other material and items publicly available\n\n5.14 Other exhibitions and displays of our material recently mounted include subjects such as Charlie Chaplin; the Boulting Brothers; Julie Harris; the papers of Dilys Powell; the work of cinematographer Jack Cardiff; and on Shackleton to support the film South at the Imax. The Moving Pictures exhibition appeared at the Millennium Galleries in Sheffield. Our Bollywood in Love exhibition of Bollywood film posters and associated items, part of the ImagineAsia festival, has so far toured to half a dozen major venues around the country. Much of this material was previously displayed in our former Museum.\n\n5.15 As an add-on to its usual services, our Library recently started to feature displays of material from its collections to support seasons at the National Film Theatre: recent examples featured Jean Luc Godard, Cary Grant and Werner Herzog. Last year we acquired the Independent Television Commission Library: this has substantially increased our holdings and created an unparalleled resource for the public, academics and creative industries. It also raises resourcing issues for us.\n\n5.16 In addition to these principal ways of enabling access to our collections, we make material available to audiences in a huge variety of other ways. For example, to be exhibited at other organisations' festivals or exhibitions both at home and abroad; to television companies who broadcast Archive material in documentaries; and in collaboration with commercial cinema chains.\n\nReaching diverse audiences\n\n5.17 The bfi is at the forefront of widening access to film culture to more diverse audiences and encouraging participation by minority ethnic communities. As part of our cultural diversity strategy we developed the pioneering, flagship diversity project, ImagineAsia, a major celebration of films from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka as well as British Asian films. ImagineAsia ran for eight months last year in conjunction with some 70 partner organisations in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and consisted of a diverse range of screenings, events, lectures, exhibitions, books, educational resources and a special website. The festival enabled us to engage significantly with British South Asian audiences in new and innovative ways. We are now making arrangements for a similar project for 2005, provisionally called Black World, targeting African Caribbean communities and young people.\n\n5.18 We are also working hard to open up bfi premises, services and products to wider audiences by implementing Disability Discrimination Act requirements. Our Video Publishing Section started to produce DVD releases with Hearing Impaired Subtitles of English language films. We were the first video label to include subtitling of additionalitytitles subtitled include Sick and George Washington. We will shortly release a catalogue, also available online, of all our film and television materials relating to disability. And we ensure that our website conforms to accessibility guidelines. Last year our National Film Theatre was pleased to host the Lifting the Lid disability film festival. The bfi will also be participating in the celebrations of the European Year of Disability and has raised £50,000 of EEC funding to produce the UK's first teaching pack on disability and film.\n\n6. EDUCATION\n\nWe promote dynamic and innovative education programmes; we support exemplary research and scholarship\n\n6.1 We publish renowned books, Sight and Sound magazine, research papers and educational resources, and offer footage and rights sales of our television and film collections.\n\n6.2 We produce resources and training for teachers, and life-long learning is promoted through educational events and activities for learners of all ages. We also hold numerous events specifically for children and young people.\n\n6.3 The bfi National Library is the world's largest library of information and documentation on film and television. It includes more than 47,000 books, pamphlets, annuals and CD-ROMs, 6,000 periodical titles (mostly in extensive runs) as well as outstanding collections of news cuttings, scripts, personal and company papers, sound recordings, microfilm and multimedia materials. And our website is a further major source of information, with some 18,000 online pages of information.\n\nEducating people of all ages about film and television culture\n\n6.4 Education lies at the heart of all our activities. Our acquisitions, restorations, screenings, events, exhibitions, festivals and publications all play an integral part in this remit. Much of our focus lies in helping raise standards of teaching and learning. We work specifically with other education providers to encourage awareness of moving image culture, regardless of people's age or level of knowledge. Two areas of particular importance for us, where we are working with government and a range of other external partners, are media literacy and e-learning.\n\n6.5 All our education activities either generate revenue or are supported by external funding. We, in turn, part fund the organisation Film Education.\n\nFormal education\n\n6.6 We provide training for hundreds of teachers across the United Kingdom, both on a face-to-face basis and through accredited distance-learning courses. Our Associate Tutor Scheme provides a UK-wide database of freelance educators who can provide talks, workshops and training in a variety of contexts.\n\n6.7 Our books and classroom materials have established the bfi as a leading provider of resources for teaching about moving image media in schools and colleges. We provide events such as study days, workshops and introduced screenings for learners of all ages at the National Film Theatre and in association with other venues across the UK. We gather and publish evidence of good practice in moving image media teaching.\n\n6.8 Contributing to our educational remit in a significant way, and again raising awareness and appreciation of moving image culture, is our publishing arm, which publishes the renowned Sight and Sound magazine and bfi books. We are also involved in research: organising conferences, conducting surveys and publishing papers.\n\nEducational projects and activities for children\n\n6.9 We run a wide variety of events for children, largely based at the National Film Theatre and the bfi London Imax Cinema. Under the banner Movie Magic, we host workshops and screen films specifically for children aged between six and 12. The Imax attracts children and family audiences and is an important part of our commitment to this audience sector. Ninety-seven thousand children attended screenings there last year.\n\n6.10 We also try to allow as many children as possible around the country to experience our educational events. For example, we included a special educational event in the regional tour of Monsters, Inc., previously shown at the London Film Festival.\n\nDigitisation\n\n6.11 The digital provision of information and education services is a significant area. In 2001, the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) made an award of £1.2 million to the bfi under its Digitisation of Learning Materials programme. The significant contribution from NOF is enabling us to develop a definitive reference resource on British film and television history on the web, with material that will be useful for the National Curriculum. Screenonline, the name of the consortium of which the bfi is the lead partner, will provide online information to schools and libraries on the history of British film and television, and on the social history of Britain as told in moving images.\n\n6.12 This major undertaking will contain hundreds of hours of moving image clips including many complete films and television programmes, interactive timelines charting the history of the film and television industries, interviews, biographies, and specially written analysis explaining and contextualising Britain's moving image heritage. It is a project that is expensive to develop and would benefit from additional funding.\n\n6.13 Our website currently has some 18,000 pages of film and television related information, as well as information on media courses, \"virtual galleries\" of items in our collection, listings and links to other related sites. Increasingly, we are making available online, information and experiences that were previously only available in our Museum.\n\n6.14 From the bfi National Library, members can log on to our filmographic database, SIFT, (Summary of Information on Film and Television) which is the world's largest film and television database.\n\n7.
