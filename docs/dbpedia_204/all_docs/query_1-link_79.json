        "text": "In Level A, students begin to engage, participate and receive communication with known adults, teachers and peers. Opportunities are provided for students to explore English knowledge, understanding, skills and processes through everyday experiences, personal interests and significant events. Students are exposed to various alternative and augmentative communication systems because adults model and reinforce communication. Picture symbols are utilised for making choices and to represent real objects and activities. Students become aware of their physical state and are moving from reflex responses to intentional responses. Students are initially encouraged to develop control over their actions and mannerisms and to communicate within the social environment by reacting and responding to their immediate environment with as much independence as possible.\n\nIn Level A, students begin to show interest in the world around them, awareness of others and of social interactions. Students’ actions and mannerisms are treated as communication and ‘interpreted’ and reacted to by adults. Students are provided with experiences that engage, support and extend their learning, including the use of verbal and non-verbal communication and making choices.\n\nStudents experience a variety of texts for enjoyment and to extend their experiences of the world around them. They listen to, experience and view spoken, written, visual and multimodal texts, with the primary purpose of engaging, entertaining and informing. These texts include traditional oral texts, picture books, various types of stories, rhyming verse, poetry, non-fiction, film, multimodal texts and dramatic performances. They experience shared reading, viewing and storytelling using a range of literary texts, and respond to the entertaining nature of literature.\n\nLiterary texts that support and enable Level A students to become readers include predictable texts, stories, visual displays and information, social interactions and experiences. These texts involve straightforward sequences of events and everyday happenings with recognisable, realistic or imaginary characters. Informative texts present a small amount of new content about familiar topics of interest.\n\nStudents create a range of texts coactively. They begin to develop their functional motors required for written communication. Students develop their core strength and shoulder stability. They coactively use different materials for drawing and develop their gripping skills.\n\nShow less\n\nStudents listen to and react to some familiar objects, people, words and sounds within the environment by turning head, looking, reaching out and/or vocalising. They respond to their name and to familiar items when named. Students show an interest in others and an awareness of everyday social interactions such as greetings by using gesture or vocalisation. They recognise that their reaction can change others’ behaviour. They can choose between objects, images and activities and accept or reject an object or activity. They withdraw attention if no longer interested in a topic of communication. Students attempt to imitate sounds. They have some consistent vocalisation and gestures in response to different people, activities and environments.\n\nIn Level B, students communicate with peers, teachers and known adults. Opportunities are provided for students to explore English knowledge, understanding, skills and processes through everyday experiences, personal interests and significant events. Students begin to understand that communication is a tool that can be used to indicate needs, make choices and gain attention. Students communicate intentionally by using gesture, eye gaze or sound, or through selecting an object. They are learning to follow simple one-word instructions. Students are provided with experiences that engage, support and extend their learning, including the use of verbal and non-verbal communication, symbols, and choice making.\n\nStudents engage with a variety of texts for enjoyment. They listen to and role-play reading, and view spoken, written and multimodal texts whose primary purpose is to entertain, as well as some texts that are designed to inform. These include traditional oral texts, picture books, various types of stories, rhyming verse, poetry, non-fiction, film, multimodal texts and dramatic performances. They participate in shared reading, viewing and storytelling using a range of literary texts, and recognise the entertaining nature of literature.\n\nLiterary texts that support and extend Level B students as beginning readers include literary texts that develop early reading behaviours and extend their understanding of written texts. These texts involve high-interest, predictable texts with familiar and significant events and clear illustrations that strongly support the text, and informative texts, including jointly constructed texts with audio support, that present ideas about familiar topics using captions or simple sentences, known vocabulary, symbols and illustrations that strongly support the print text. Students develop some simple understandings of how books work and are supported to listen and respond to familiar rhymes and stories. They role-play reading and are in the process of learning to recognise their name in print, using visual cues. Students are learning to identify pictures, shapes and sounds.\n\nStudents coactively create texts in structured activities. They develop their fine motor skills through the use and manipulation of objects. They engage in role-play writing, labelling images or drawings and begin to trace over patterns. Students encounter information technology in the writing process and explore the use of a keyboard and move a mouse.\n\nShow less\n\nIn Level C, students communicate with known adults, teachers and peers. Students learn about social rules of communication and experience different ways to convey information to others. Students are provided with experiences that engage, support and extend their learning, including the use of verbal and non-verbal communication, use of symbols, and choice making. Students express and record their wants, needs and feelings through words, gesture, and picture and symbol selection. Many students will use recognisable and consistent words.\n\nStudents engage with a variety of texts for enjoyment.

They identify the main character or event in a familiar text using visual images from the text. They participate in interactive stories and repeat or activate a short phrase or refrain during the sharing of a familiar text. When reading, students move through a print text from front to back. They can comment or point to illustrations in reading material to predict the topic of the material. They use a key word to respond to questions about what is happening in a text. They can make a graphophonic identification of their own name. They can match letters and numbers, and identify some letters and numbers named by another.\n\nBy the end of Level C, students listen to and view a range of spoken, written and multimodal texts from familiar contexts.
