        "text": "Weâve explored historical context, themes, essay planning and essay topics over on our Like a House on Fire by Cate Kennedy blog post. If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to studying this text, I highly recommend checking it out!\n\nâ\n\n[Video Transcription]\n\nHey guys, welcome back to Lisa's Study Guides. So this week I have another essay topic breakdown for you. So eventually I'm going to get through all of the VCAA texts that are on the study design, but we're slowly going to get there and are just want to say yet again, even though this one is like a house on fire, I am really glad if you've clicked on this video and you're not necessarily studying it because as always with all my videos, I try to give you an overall message for you to take away that can be applied to any single text. So that is the same for this particular text today. And so even though the takeaway message for this video is quite specific to short stories, it's still an important consideration for any text that you're studying. Ideally, you want to use a diverse range of evidence for any text, but in particular, for short stories, you don't just want to rely on a small handful, but to try and make links between the different short stories.\n\nSo let's see what that means on the other side of this quick overview of the text. Like a House on Fire is a collection of short stories by the author, Cate Kennedy, and unlike a lot of other texts on the study design, this book portrays a lot of very domestic situations, which seems fairly boring compared to some of the other texts that other students might be doing. However, I'm really excited about this text because the short stories are great. Not because they have groundbreaking premises, which they don't, but because of how effortlessly and deeply emotive they are. So the domestic scenarios actually help us relate to the characters in the stories and empathize with the complexity of their experiences. The essay topic we'll be looking at today is in Like a House on Fire, Kennedy finds strength in ordinary people. Discuss.\n\nHere, the term which you really have to think about is strength. We already know that she depicts the story of ordinary people, of people like you or me, or even just people we may know, but does she find strength in them? It could be physical strength, but more often than not, it might be other types of strength. For instance, the mental strength it takes to cope with intense pressure or the emotional strength it takes to make a difficult choice or action. It's important to think about how they might actually apply throughout the book. In this sense, our essay will have essentially two halves.\n\nThe first two body paragraphs we'll look at scenarios of intense pressure, be it through the loss of control in one's life or a domestic situation which has become emotionally tense. The last two body paragraphs will then consider the types of strength that Kennedy evinces in these stories. And we'll contend that she does find strength in the characters who face a difficult decision, but that she also finds a lot more strength in the characters who managed to cope with their situation and grapple with the tensions in their lives.\n\nParagraph one\n\nIn many of her stories, Kennedy portrays characters who experience powerlessness. This loss of power can come a number of ways. For instance, both Flexion and Like a House on Fire tell the story of men who have injured their previously reliable bodies and have thus been rendered immobile. But they also tell the story of their respective wives who have lost some control over their lives now that they have to care for their husbands. On the other hand, there are the kids in Whirlpool whose mother insists that they dress a certain way for a Christmas photo. Her hand on your shoulders, exerting pressure that pushes you down. Kennedy's use of second person really makes you feel this pressure that keeps you from going out to the pool you so desperately desire to be in. Evidently powerlessness is an experience that comes in many shapes and forms in several stories.\n\nParagraph two\n\nIn addition to this, Kennedy explores other emotional tensions across the collection, subverting the idea that the home is necessarily a safe sanctuary. This is where she really goes beyond just the idea of powerlessness, but actually jumps into scenarios that are much more emotionally complex. In Ashes for instance, we see the homosexual protagonist struggle with feeling useless and tongue tied, embarrassed by the floundering pause between his mother and himself. There is a significant emotional hurdle there, which is particularly poignant given that mothers are usually considered a source of safety and comfort for their children. Kennedy's story of domesticity actually subvert or question what we might think of the domestic space shared by family members. If you have the Scribe edition of the book, the artwork on the cover would depict a vase of wilting flowers, an empty picture frame, and a spilt cup of coffee.\n\nThese are all visual symbols of an imperfect domestic life. A similar rift exists between husband and wife in both Five Dollar Family and Waiting, the women find themselves unable to emotionally depend on their partners. While Michelle in Five Dollar Family despises her husbands startled, faintly incredulous expression, an inability to care for their child, the protagonist in Waiting struggles to talk about her miscarriages with her husband who is already worn down as it is. Kennedy takes these household roles of mother, son, husband, wife, and really dives into the complex shades of emotion that lies within these relationships. We realize through her stories that a mother can't always provide comfort to a child and that a husband isn't always the dependable partner that he's supposed to be.\n\nParagraph three\n\nHowever, Kennedy does find strength in some characters who do take a bold or courageous leap in some way. These are really important moments in which she is able to show us the strength that it takes to make these decisions. And she triumphs however small or insignificant that can be achieved.\n\nA moment that really stands out to me is the ending of Laminex and Mirrors, where the protagonist rebelliously smuggles a hospital patient out for a smoke only to have to take him back into his ward through the main entrance and therefore get them both caught. She recounts this experience as the one I remember most clearly from the year I turned 18. The two of us content, just for this perfect moment. And their success resonates with the audience, even though the protagonist would have lost her job and therefore the income she needed for her trip to London, Kennedy demonstrates her strength in choosing compassion for an elderly patient. Even the sister in Whirlpool, who wasn't exactly kind to the protagonist in the beginning, forms an unlikely alliance with her against their mother, sharing a reckless moment and cutting their photo shoot short. Bold leaps such as these are ones that take strength and therefore deserve admiration.\n\nParagraph four\n\nHowever, more often than not, Kennedy's stories are more about the strength needed to simply cope with life, one day at a time. She explores the minutiae of her characters lives in a way that conveys the day to day struggles, but also hints at the underlying fortitude needed to deal with these things on a daily basis. In Tender, the wife feels as if everything at home is on the verge of coming apart since her husband is only able to cook tuna and pasta casserole for their kids. However, when she must get a possibly malignant tumor removed, her concern of whether there'll be tuna and pasta in the pantry just in case, demonstrates her selfless nature. Kennedy thus creates a character who is strong for others, even when her own life at home is disorderly and her health may be in jeopardy. The strength of gritting one's teeth and getting on with things in spite of emotional tension is a central idea across this collection, and many other examples are there for you to consider as well.\n\nAnd so we come to the end of our essay. Hopefully going through this gives you an idea of how to cover more bases with your evidence. Remember that you don't have to recount lots and lots of events, but it's more important to engage with what the events are actually telling us about people. This is particularly important for prompts like this one, where it heavily focuses on the people involved. That is it for me this week, please give this video a thumbs up. If you wanted to say thanks to Mark, who has been helping me write these scripts up for a lot of the text response essay, topic breakdowns. If you enjoyed this, then you might also be interested in the live stream coming up next week, which will be on Friday the 25th of May at 5:00 PM. I'll be covering the topic of analyzing argument for the second time, just because there's so much to get through. I'll also be announcing some special things during that particular live stream. So make sure you're there so you're the first to hear it. I will see you guys next week. Bye.\n\nResources\n\nLike a House on Fire by Cate Kennedy\n\nHow To Get An A+ On Your Like A House On Fire Essay\n\nClose Analysis Of 'Cake' From Like A House On Fire\n\nWe've explored themes, characters, literary devices and historical context amongst other things over on our Women of Troy by Euripides blog post. If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to studying this text, I highly recommend checking it out as well as ourUltimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nHere, weâll be breaking down a Women of Troy essay topic using LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, you can learn about it in our How To Write A Killer Text Response study guide.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nWithout further ado, letâs get into it!\n\nThe Prompt: ââWe are loot my son and I, soldiersâ plunder.â Discuss how Euripides highlights the plight of women taken as slaves in war.âÂ\n\nTHINK\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThe first thing to note about this prompt is that it is a 'howâ question, it is essentially asking us to identify the literary techniques Euripides has employed in order to âhighlightâ the womenâs âplightâ. The noun âplightâ is defined as a troublesome or unfortunate situation, yet we must consider this word in the context of war. How do the women suffer? In other words, how does Euripides demonstrate to his reader just how dejected the women are as slaves?\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nIt is relatively simple to identify the literary techniques which consistently appear throughout Euripidesâ play, such as imagery, metaphor and simile (not entirely sure what literary techniques are? We have a list of them for you here). However, keeping in mind we have to form three paragraphs, we should consider Euripidesâ authorial voice more broadly. For example, the women consistently lament their disillusionment with the gods. This is not a literary technique in itself, but it is still a literary choice which Euripides has made and which has been deepened with more specific literary devices like metaphor. The same could be said for the womenâs struggle for hope, and the contrast between their joyous pasts and dismal futures.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nUnlike a âto what extentâ question, we do not have to form an argument. Instead, we must forge a discussion of Euripidesâ literary decisions as a playwright.\n\nP1: Euripides juxtaposes the triumphant pasts of the Trojan women with their tragic futures. The 'shining citadels of Troy' are now a 'black smokened ruinâ.\n\nP2: Euripides illuminates the womenâs attempts to retain futile hope. Note that hope also comes in the form of revenge.\n\nP3: The dramatic irony of the play renders the womenâs desperate calls upon the gods all the more tragic. Here, we can also make reference to the prologue, and Atheneâs ploy to create a storm on the Greeksâ journey home which also ultimately affects the women.\n\nEXECUTE\n\nEssay\n\nAt the heart of the conflict in The Women of Troy, lies the anguished 'suffering' (1) of the Trojan women as they confront their fates as 'slaves', and remember their pasts as wives and mothers. In his tragedy, first performed in Athens circa 415 BCE, Euripides amplifies the conflicted voices of the Trojan women, voices which are by contrast suppressed and disregarded in the Homeric works the Iliad and the Odyssey. Euripidesâ stark dichotomy between the glories and 'rituals' of the past, and the sombre 'grief' of the present, elucidate the magnitude of their losses, both material and moral. For as Andromache laments, these women have been objectified as 'loot', mere spoils of war to be abused and exploited. (2) The womenâs tendency to clutch onto chimerical (3) hopes and values only serves to further illuminate the profundity of their suffering once these ambitions have been brutally quashed in the 'dust' of their 'smoke blackened ruin' of Troy. Perhaps most significantly, Euripides juxtaposes the lingering though pitiful hope of the women with the godsâ complete 'desert[ion]' of Troy, positioning the women in an ironic chasm of cruel abandonment. Thus, the plight of women as wartime captives is dramatised by Euripides, corralling the audience into an ultimate stance of pity and empathy.\n\nAnnotations:\n\n(1) It is often useful to embed short/one word quotes in your essay (we teach you how in How To Embed Quotes in Your Essay Like a Boss). It shows you have a great understanding of the text, and reads fluidly as opposed to overly long quotes.\n\nâ(2) Here, I have addressed the quote in the prompt in a single sentence, unpacking Euripidesâ analogy of Andromache and Astyanax as âlootâ. By comparing the two characters to war spoils, he is suggesting that they have been stripped of their free will and autonomy.\n\nâ(3) It is really important to vary your vocabulary in order to increase the sophistication of your essay. The adjective âchimericalâ refers to an ideal which is impossible to achieve.Â\n\nEuripidesâ juxtaposition between the dismal future of the Trojan women and the zenith of their pasts, further illuminates the chasm of their sufferings and losses as the ultimate victims of wartime atrocities. Chiefly, Euripides contrasts Hecubaâs former royal status with the demoralizing fate of her captivity, encapsulating this tragic fall from nobility with the ironic imagery, 'throned in the dustâ. Yet perhaps what truly emphasises her plight as a slave is her enduring role as a maternal figure of leadership, encapsulated in her regard of the chorus as '[her] children' and her reciprocated address as 'dear queen' and 'your mother'. Despite the 'death agony' she feels, she chooses to maintain her nobility through the depth of her morality, dramatizing the pitiful nature of her plight (4). Moreover, Euripidesâ juxtaposition between the 'shining citadels of Troy' and the 'misery' of the chorus elucidates the significance of 'home', a source of solace which has been barbarically stripped away from them. Likewise, Andromache laments her past as a dutiful and faithful wife, contrasting her fidelity against her fate as a 'concubine' to the formidable Neoptolemus (5). Euripides implies that Andromache must abandon her reputation as the 'perfect wife' â the very attribute for which she was chosen especially â doomed to confront a life of sexual slavery, an unwilling mother of Neoptolemusâ children.\n\nAnnotations:\n\n(4) Here, I have used the word âplightâ, making sure I am engaging directly with the prompt. It is often easy to fall into the trap of creating a generalised essay which only loosely adheres to the question.Â\n\nâ(5) It is more sophisticated to specify the name of Andromacheâs husband (Neoptolemus), rather than to just simply state âAndromacheâs husbandâ (even though he is not featured as a character in Euripidesâ play).\n\nEuripides (6) characterises the women by their tendency to clutch on to 'hope[s]' and ideals that are impossible to fulfil. Almost a coping mechanism of sorts, the chorus paradoxically romanticise the Greek landscape in the first episode, lauding the 'sacred halls', 'green fields', 'beautiful river[s]' and 'wealth' of Hellas. Yet, their ardent critiques of their future 'home[s]' rejects any notion that the women truly believe these glorifications of the Greek realm. Similarly, Hecuba is motivated by her futile hope that Astyanax may one day seek vengeance and be 'the savior of Troy' by 'rebuild[ing]' the city. Yet tragically, this doomed hope is violently quashed by Odysseus 'blind panic' and acute lack of rationality: the 'liar' and 'deceiver' who 'lead the Greek council' in their debate. Though this hope initially provides her with some form of solace, all comfort is dashed with the announcement of his 'butchery'. Likewise, Cassandra is motivated by her own pursuit for revenge, lauding her 'sacred marriage' to Agamemnon as an event worthy of 'praise' and 'celebration'. Yet her hope is also jaded, for she must in the process 'flout all religious feeling' as a slave of Agamemnonâs 'lust', until she meets her painful hour of death at Clytemnestraâs hands.\n\nAnnotations:\n\n(6) Notice that several of the sentences have begun with âEuripides characterisesâ or âEuripides illuminatesâ, engaging with the âhowâ part of the prompt. We are showing what the author has done and why.\n\nIronically, Euripides illuminates the plight of the Trojan women through his dramatic elucidation of the godsâ callous abandonment of the ruined Troy. Euripides juxtaposes the past 'rituals', 'dances', 'songs', 'sacrifices', 'offerings' and 'ceremonies' of the chorus with their bitter laments that 'the gods hate Troy' and that they are ultimately characterised by avarice. They are neither answered not consoled in their ultimate time of mourning, for the audience is aware that Poseidon has fled the scene in the prologue, disillusioned by the 'ceas[ing]' of 'worship', leaving 'nothing (â¦) worth a godâs consideration' in the fallen city. What is also rendered ironic by Euripides, is Atheneâs formidable ploy to 'make the Greeksâ return home a complete disaster.' Regardless of Atheneâs true motives for instigating this ultimate pursuit of comeuppance, the fact remains that the women too must endure this perilous journey to Greece. Not only are the despairing wives, mothers and daughters condemned to 'abject slavery' on foreign soil, they are 'innocent: victims who may â alongside the Greeks â find themselves on the shores of Euboea, among the 'float[ing] (â¦) corpses' of the Greek soldiers. They are not simply abandoned by the gods, they are, directly or indirectly, punished. (7)\n\nAnnotations:\n\n(7) This is a more original point which other students may not automatically think of. We often view Atheneâs âployâ as a deserved punishment of the âmurderousâ Greeks, yet there is no true justice, for the women too are ultimately affected.\n\nIn a play which serves to fill the silence of the Trojan women in the legendary works of the Iliad and the Odyssey (8), Euripides augments the pitiful plight of the Trojan women with agonizing references to past 'happiness', and equally unbearable forecasts of their roles as 'slaves' of Greek lust. They are indeed 'loot' and they are indeed 'plunder' â as Andromache so bitterly laments â yet their plight is recorded in the works of 'poets' to come, remembered as a legacy of stoicism 'a hundred generations hence.' Taken as our 'great theme', these women are 'sufferer[s]', yet they are also heroes.\n\nAnnotations:\n\n(8) Just as I have done in the introduction, I have referred to the context of the play in the conclusion. The Iliad and the Odyssey provided the framework for Euripidesâ play, so by referencing Homerâs works we are showing the examiner that we have an understanding of the historical context.Â\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into Women of Troy, check out our A Killer Text Guide: Women of Troy study guide.

More fancy language. Hasnât he been dead for centuries? Why does he keep popping up in our English curriculum?â\n\nAt least, thatâs how I reacted.\n\nShakespeare is actually a huge figure in the history of the English language, and really no high school English curriculum is complete without a mandatory dose of him. In fact, the current VCAA study design demands that one of his texts must be on the text list. What a legend.\n\nShakespeare doesnât only influence our world in the classroom. The Bard coined many words and phrases that we use today. We can thank this playwright for âbe -all, end-allâ, âgood riddanceâ, and my personal favourite, âswaggerâ.\n\nThe Bardâs play âMeasure for Measureâ was first performed in 1604; over 400 years ago. So why do we still study his works today? In fact, the ideas and themes that are evoked in his plays are universal and timeless; pertinent to his contemporary counterparts, as well as todayâs audience. Shakespeareâs plays are like soup (bear with me, this is going somewhere). One could say the playwright is a master chef; he mixes tales of the human condition and experience and asks us to question people and ideas. Everyone, regardless of their time, will gobble up the story.\n\nSo, what is this soup- I mean âMeasure for Measureâ about? The play is known as a âproblem playâ and/or âtragicomedyâ. Thatâs right, itâs both a tragedy and a comedy. Dire trials and tribulations are intertwined with humorous gags and jokesters. I guess Shakespeare couldnât choose just one. Â\n\nâMeasure for Measureâ is also a problem play. Critic W.W Lawrence defined a problem play as one in which \"a perplexing and distressing complication in human life is presented in a spirit of high seriousness ... the theme is handled so as to arouse not merely interest or excitement, or pity or amusement, but to probe the complicated interrelations of character and action, in a situation admitting of different ethical interpretations\".\n\nOk, crazy, but he also said that \"the 'problem' is not like one in mathematics, to which there is a single true solution, but is one of conduct, as to which there are no fixed and immutable laws. Often it cannot be reduced to any formula, any one question, since human life is too complex to be so neatly simplified.â\n\nIn short, a problem play presents lots of complications and issues that are open to different ethical interpretations. As in âMeasure for Measureâ, the âproblem(s)â is/are not always solved.\n\nSo, what actually happens in this play that is problematic? What are our ingredients in this problem soup?\n\nâP(L)OT SUMMARY\n\nGet it? Cause soup is cooked in a pot. Sorry.\n\nThe Duke of Vienna appoints his deputy, Angelo, as the temporary leader. This Duke then pretends to leave town but instead dresses up as a friar to observe what happens in his absence. Angelo, strict and unwavering in his dedication to following the rules, decides to rid Vienna of all the unlawful sexual activity; including shutting down the brothels. Prostitutes like Mistress Overdone (pun alert) and her pimp Pompey are poised to lose their livelihoods. Laws against this activity exist, but theyâve gotten lax over the years. Angelo, a stickler for the rules, has Claudio arrested because young Claudio has gotten his engaged wife-to-be (Juliet) pregnant before they were officially married. Claudio is to be executed.\n\nThe virtuous Isabella, Claudioâs sister, is poised to enter a nunnery. Upon hearing of her brotherâs arrest and sentence, she goes to Angelo to beg him for mercy. He hypocritically, in an absolutely dog move, propositions her, saying heâll pardon her brother if she sleeps with him (with Angelo, not Claudio). She immediately refuses, being the religious and chaste woman that she is. At first Claudio is upset because he wants to live, but then he calms down and accepts death.\n\nLuckily, the Duke (secretly dressed as a friar) helps in their sticky situation. He brews up a plan; Angeloâs former flame Mariana was engaged to him, but he broke off their engagement after she lost her dowry in a shipwreck. The Friar (Duke) plans to have Isabella agree to sleep with Angelo, but then send Mariana in her place. In theory, Angelo would pardon Claudio and be forced to marry Mariana by law.\n\nThe old switcheroo goes off without a hitch. But come morning, Angelo refuses to pardon Claudio, fearing he will seek revenge. The Duke, in collaboration with the Provost, send Angelo the head of a dead pirate (Ragozine) who died of natural causes. They claim that itâs Claudioâs head, and Angelo is satisfied, thinking him to be dead. Isabella is also told that her brother is dead and is encouraged by the Friar (Duke) to complain about Angelo to the Duke, who is returning home. Â\n\nThe Duke makes a grand return to Vienna, saying he will hear any complaints immediately. Isabella tells her story, and the Duke feigns disbelief, despite having orchestrated the plan himself. In an act filled with more twists and turns than a Marvel movie, everything comes out; the Duke reveals he was a friar all along, Angelo is forced to confess, and Claudio is pardoned amongst other things. To top it all off, the Duke proposes to Isabella. Crazy!\n\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT\n\nItâs important to acknowledge what was going on in the world during the writing of a text. This may help give insight into why the author has included (or not included) some aspect of their work.\n\nThe Divine Right of Kings\n\nThis holy mandate states that a monarch derives his right to rule from the will of God and is not subject to earthly authority. The âkingâ or monarch is hence practically divine, and questioning his orders is also questioning god; blasphemy.\n\nThe Great Chain of Being/Class divides\n\nThis chain is a hierarchy of all life forms and matter in the following order:\n\nGod\n\nAngels\n\nKings & Royalty\n\nNobles\n\nCommoners (Gentry, Merchants, Yeoman, Laborers)\n\nSlaves\n\nAnimals\n\nPlants\n\nNon-living things\n\nHence, alongside The Divine Right of Kings, this ideal gave monarchs huge power over their subjects.\n\nIn early 1600s England, there was a defined social hierarchy and class system. Everyone had a place in the hierarchy, and there was little movement between the classes. Within each class, men were considered superior to women.\n\nShakespeare encourages us to ask a few questions of our supposedly holy leader and his actions. According to the Divine Right of Kings, the Duke is godâs right-hand man, and thus all his decisions are holy and backed by heaven. However, the Duke is pretty shady when he plots his bed-trick plan with Isabella and Mariana. Is this deceptive behavior still holy? Furthermore, is it not sacrilege to pretend to be a holy friar when one is not truly a holy man?\n\nMoreover, when the Duke assigns Angelo as his deputy, would this transform Angelo into a divine ruler too? Could he be divine, considering his cruel rule and despicable request to Isabella?\n\nWomen\n\nWomen were considered subservient, lower class citizens then men. Alliances were forged between powerful families through arranged marriages of daughters. These girls may have received an education through tutors attending their homes (there were no schools for girls), but their endgame would be marriage, children and maintaining the home. Women and girls of a lower class did not receive any formal education but would have learned how to govern a household and become skilled in all housewifely duties. Impoverished and desperate women (Mistress Overdone) would turn to prostitution to stay alive.\n\nShakespeare perhaps highlights the struggle of women in his female characters; Isabella, Mistress Overdone, Juliet, and Kate Keepdown. Their futures appear bleak; Isabella is poised to enter a nunnery, Julietâs husband (her only source of income and protection) is to be executed, while the brothels that facilitate Mistress Overdone and Kate Keepdownâs livelihoods are being closed down by Angelo.\n\nJacobean Audience\n\nIt was a tumultuous time when Shakespeare penned âMeasure for Measureâ in 1604. A year earlier came the end of the 45 year long Elizabethan era and began the Jacobean era under the rule of King James. Since the late Queen Elizabeth had no direct heirs, King James of Scotland (a relative) took to the throne. Little was known by the English people of this foreign king.\n\nPerhaps, as Shakespeare portrays the ruler in âMeasure for Measureâ as clever and good-hearted, the Bard sought to appease the king by calming the people and encouraging them to trust in their new monarch.\n\nThe playwright characterizes the Duke as loving his people, but not enjoying being before their eyes and in the spotlight; much like King James, a quiet ruler who relished studying privately in his great library.\n\nâPlayhouses and Brothels\n\nThe general public (commoners) paid a penny (could buy you a loaf of bread back in the day) to see Shakespeareâs plays, standing in the âyardâ; on the ground, at eye-level of the stage. The rich (gentry) paid 2 pennies for seating in the galleries, often using cushions. The really rich (nobles) could watch the play from a chair set on the side of the stage itself. Shakespeareâs plays were performed at the Globe Theatre. Playhouses in Shakespeare's time were often close to brothels, both in terms of their physical locations in the suburbs and the way they were viewed by some of polite society. Thus, Shakespeare's relatively sympathetic portrayal of sexual deviance in âMeasure for Measureâ may also constitute a defence of other suburban entertainmentâhis playsâand a way to humanize lower classes who patronized them.\n\nWRITING ABOUT 'MEASURE FOR MEASURE'\n\nIf youâre lucky enough to study this interesting piece, the study design requires you to prepare âsustained analytical interpretationsâ¦discussing how features of the text create meaning and using textual evidence to support (your) reasonsâ. Basically, youâll be given a topic; this topic could surround themes, characters, etc., and you must write analytically.\n\nWhile you may choose to structure paragraphs around themes, ideas or characters, make sure to embed some historical context in there; thatâll show the examiner that youâve done your research and have a thorough and deeper understanding of why Shakespeare put this or that in. Talking about authorial intent in your analytical essay leads to a more in-depth analysis.\n\nâShakespeare portrays characters that are flawed as a result of pre-destined circumstances. These characters, such as bawd Pompey and prostitute Mistress Overdone, lived in a time when there existed strong class divides, and movement within the social hierarchy was rare. As per the âGreat Chain of Beingâ, a contemporary religious dogma, there was a hierarchy of all living things and matter, from lofty God and his angels down through the ranks of men and finally to animals and non-living things. In some cases, attempting to move up the social ranks was even considered a blasphemous rejection of the fate chosen by God.â\n\n- embedding historical context (The Great Chain of Being) into a paragraph that discusses characters being flawed because of their circumstances\n\nâShakespeare offers characters such as Isabella and The Duke who strive for self-improvement through understanding and temperance. Perhaps the playwright suggests that perfection is very difficult if not impossible to attain, even for a ruler like the Duke and a pure soul like Isabella. However, he posits that it can be strived for and that perhaps this attempt to become better is what truly matters.â\n\n- talking about authorial intent - what is Shakespeare trying to tell us?\n\nThink of it as an opportunity to make your very own soup! Add some themes, stir in character analysis, sprinkle in some quotes and serve with historical context and authorial intent. Just like with a soup, thereâs got be a good balance of all your ingredients; test out different structures during the year to find what works for you. (Just try not to overcook it, like I have done with this soup metaphor).

Well...). Keep on reading this blog post, where weâll delve into themes, characters and symbols/motifs. In the meantime, letâs have a break. Grab a snack, a drink, and enjoy this tasty Shakespeare meme.\n\n...Aaaaand weâre back!\n\nAre you ready for part 2 of the Shakespeare train? Hop on board as we explore themes, characters and symbols/motifs.ââ\n\nTHEMESâ\n\nThese are the major themes in âMeasure for Measureâ.\n\nAs you can see, the themes are interconnected. (Do you like the diagram? Made it myself :)) Why does this matter? Well, if you get an essay topic about Justice, for instance, you can also link it to Sexual and Gender Politics as well as Social Decay/Cohesion.\n\nSo, why is any one theme an important theme?\n\nWhich moments and characters are these themes related to?\n\nIs there a link to historical context?\n\nWhat are some key quotes?\n\nWhat could be Shakespeareâs potential message? (Keep in mind that depending which pieces of evidence you look at, the Bard could be saying something different. In this piece, weâll only discuss one or two authorial messages. The beauty of Shakespeare is that much is open to interpretation. You can interpret characters and ideas in so many different ways!)\n\nThose are some great questions. Letâs explore some of the biggest themes...\n\nPower and Authority\n\nPower not only dictates the Viennese society, but we see it is a basis for moral corruption (Iâm looking at you, Angelo!). The Duke is the leader of Vienna, ordained by God. He hands this power to his deputy Angelo, who misuses it in his request of Isabella. Now consider Isabella - she has power too, but a different kindâ¦ Also consider characters who have little to no power - Mistress Overdone, Pompey etc.\n\nThis theme could be linked to the Divine Right of Kings, the Great Chain of Being and Women.\n\nâO, it is excellent to have a giantâs strength, but it is tyrannous to use it like a giantâ - Isabella when she pleads to Angelo to not kill her brother (Act 2, Scene 2, Line 130-132)\n\nâHe who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severeâ - The Friar (Duke) to himself, not happy with Angeloâs dog move (Act 3, Scene 1, 538-539)\n\nâWhen maidens sue, men give like godsâ - Lucio to Isabella, encouraging her to convince Angelo not to kill Claudio (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 87-88)\n\n\"Hence we shall see, if power change purpose, what our seemers be.â - The Duke lowkey suggesting that once Angelo gets power, heâll change into something evil (Act 1, Scene 4, Line 57)\n\nâSome rise by sin, and some by virtue fall.â - Escalus is sneakily hating on Angelo. This quote shows that power and authority often involve corruption (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 41)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare is suggesting that power is a dangerous weapon and that in the wrong hands, it could be deadly.\n\nMorality and Sin\n\nThis is an interesting theme. What defines sin? For instance, if Isabella sleeps with Angelo sheâs sinning before God. But if she doesnât, then sheâs letting her brother die, which is not good either. Bit of a pickle that one. Some characters to consider include Isabella, Angelo, The Duke, Claudio, Lucio, the Provostâ¦. jeez just about everyone! So many of the characters take part in questionable deeds. Was it immoral for the Duke to pretend to be a holy friar? Is Claudioâs sin of impregnating Juliet really punishable by death if both parties were willing, and no one else has been punished for the same âcrimeâ? Are Pompey and Mistress Overdone being immoral in being in the prostitution business, if itâs the only way to survive?\n\nDeep stuff man. This can be linked back to class divides, women and the contemporary playhouses/brothels.\n\nâWhat sin you do to save a brotherâs life, nature dispenses with the deed so far that it becomes a virtueâ - Claudio begs his sister to sleep with Angelo (immoral, especially since sheâs poised to enter a nunnery), saying that itâs for a good cause, and will actually be a virtue/good deed (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 146-148)\n\nâMight there not be a charity in sin to save this brotherâs life?â - Angelo asking Isabella to sleep with him and trying to paint the act as a charitable deed (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 65-66)\n\nâI am a kind of burr, I shall stickâ - Lucio, who represents sin and immorality in Vienna (weâll talk more about this later in symbols/motifs) (Act 4, Scene 3, Line 182)\n\nâTo bring you thus together âtis no sin, sith that the justice of your title to him doth flourish the deceit.â - The Friar (Duke), encouraging Isabella and Mariana to do the dodgy bed-trick and trick Angelo (Act 4, Scene 1, Line 79-81)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare tries to tell us that there is a fine line between something moral and something sinful. Maybe heâs asking, âwho are we to judge?â, since we all do questionable things sometimes. Everyone from the almighty Duke to a lowly prostitute has committed potentially immoral acts. Perhaps audiences are encouraged to be more understanding of others, and their reasons for these deeds.\n\nJustice\n\nMmm, this theme ties in nicely with just about all of the others. How does one define justice? The play explores this idea; does justice mean punishment? Or mercy? How do we balance the two to deliver the right punishment/lack thereof? Characters that dispense justice include The Duke, Angelo (although they have differing ideas of justice) and Isabella. Since Vienna is a religious place, consider the divine justice system (ie. a perfect, flawless system meted out by God) and the earthly one (ie. the flawed, human justice system). Laws exist in an attempt to ensure justice. But does it always work? Consider also the Old and New Testament ways of thinking - the former strict and punitive, while the latter is more measured and merciful (see symbols/motifs below for more info).\n\nThis theme can be linked to the Divine Right of Kings, Great Chain of Being, Women, and Jacobean Audience.\n\nâJustice, justice, justice, justice!â - (Wait, are you sure this quote is about justice?) Isabella pleads for (you guessed it) justice to the Duke (no longer dressed as a friar), thinking Angelo has, in fact, killed her brother (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 26)\n\nâThe very mercy of the law cried outâ¦ âAn Angelo for Claudio, death for death!â Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure, like doth quit like, and measure still for measureâ - The Duke, explaining that itâs only fair that Angelo die for âkillingâ Claudio. (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 437-441)\n\nâliberty plucks justice by the noseâ - The Duke tells Friar Thomas that the laws have slipped over the years, and the citizens of Vienna are not being punished for immoral deeds (prostitution, sex before marriage etc)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare says that since we humans are inevitably flawed, that any justice system created by us will too be imperfect. Who are we to decide the fates of our fellow man? Furthermore, the Bard may be encouraging us to be kind when dispensing justice, leaning more to mercy than punishment.\n\nSexual and Gender Politics\n\nWho run the world? Gir- no itâs a bunch of men. This theme contributes to why âMeasure for Measureâ is a problem play. The exploration of the female characters in this play are very interesting, and kind of sad. Of 20 named characters, only 5 are women. Together, their lines make up only 18% of the play. Yikes! There is a lot to unpack here. Our female characters are Isabella, Mariana, Mistress Overdone, Juliet, Francisca (a nun who speaks twice) and Kate Keepdown (who we never meet). Their situations: a maiden poised to enter a nunnery, a prostitute, a pregnant girl about to lose her husband, a nun, and another prostitute. Quite gloomy, isn't it? Meanwhile, the men are leaders (The Duke, deputy Angelo, and ancient lord Escalus) and gentlemen (Lucio, Claudio, and Froth). Over the course of the play, our female characters are put into worse situations by men. Their experiences are dictated by men. Consider taking a âfeminist perspectiveâ and exploring âMeasure for Measureâ from a female point of view.\n\nThis theme links to the Great Chain of Being, Women and Playhouses/Brothels.\n\nâsee how he goes about to abuse me!â - These are the last words we hear from Mistress Overdone, as she calls out Lucio for betraying her even though she kept secrets for him. All this happens while sheâs being carted off to prison in only Act 3! What do you think Shakespeare is saying to us? (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 481)\n\nâThen was your sin of heavier kind than hisâ - The Friar (Duke) says to Juliet that she sinned more than Claudio, even though their sin was âmutually committedâ. Even though they were both consenting, the woman is blamed more. Consider what would become of Juliet if Claudio was executed. Sheâd probably end up like Mistress Overdone... (Act 2, Scene 3, Line 31)\n\nâWho will believe thee, Isabel?â - Angelo says this after Isabella threatens to reveal his disgusting request. Ouch. It really goes to show how untrustworthy women are deemed. Â (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 163)\n\nâWhy, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?â - The Duke says this to Mariana. Basically, he says a woman can only be those 3 things. Jeez. (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 196-197)\n\nâWhen maidens sue, men give like godsâ - Lucio to Isabella, encouraging her to convince Angelo not to kill Claudio. So, perhaps women do have some power. But, itâs due to their sexuality; something evaluated by men. Peachy. (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 87-88)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare suggests that women are treated unfairly in society. Maybe he posits that women are afforded so few opportunities in a manâs world. The Bard potentially says that such sexual and gender politics do not create a cohesive and just society.\n\nMercy\n\nThis theme, again, connects to many others. It can link to all groups of people (The wealthy, the poor, women, criminals etc). Most of the mercy is dispensed at the end of the play when the Duke does his grand reveal. Characters who choose to mete out mercy over punishment include The Duke and Isabella. Also consider Angelo, who instead of choosing to spare Claudio, decides to kill him to uphold a law that hasnât seen anyone punished for the same deed. We might think this is harsh, but it a legal and lawful decision.\n\nConnect this idea with historical context, specifically Jacobean audience and playhouses/brothels.\n\nâI find an apt remission in myselfâ - Apt remission = ready forgiveness. The Duke says this after pardoning Angelo (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 539)\n\nâpray thee take this mercy to provide for better times to comeâ - The Duke pardons murderer Barnadine, asking him to use it to do better. How lovely! Â (Act 5, Scene 1, Line 525-526)\n\nâlet us be keen (shrewd/sharp), and rather cut a little than fall and bruise to deathâ - Escalus says this to Angelo, who wants to enact all strict laws immediately. The ever-reliable Escalus advises Angelo to be lenient and merciful. (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 6-7)\n\nâMercy is not itself that oft looks so, pardon is still the nurse of second woeâ - Escalus says this, defending Angeloâs decision to punish Claudio. He suggests that sometimes being merciful can encourage further wrongdoing. (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 282-283â)\n\nâI show it (pity) most of all when I show justiceâ - Angelo says to Isabella that he is showing Claudio pity/mercy by punishing him. A firm believer in the law, Angelo thinks heâs doing the right thing and teaching Claudio a lesson by punishing him. Â (Act 2, Scene 2, Line 123)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare encourages us to look at mercy and punishment from different perspectives. Angelo believes he is punishing Claudio for his own good, and cleaning up Vienna of lechery too. Maybe we ought to be merciful in our opinion of the deputy. Nonetheless, the Bard shows that in the case of young Claudio, mercy and forgiveness is the right path to choose. Finally, consider why Shakespeare may have portrayed a merciful leader to his Jacobean audience. Maybe if he were to portray a leader as fair and merciful, the Jacobean audience would trust that their new king (a man similar in character to the Duke) could be kind and merciful too. Earning the favour of the king and writing a killer play? Heâs killed two birds with one stone.\n\nHuman Frailty & Fallibility\n\nIâve encountered many essay topics about how humans are flawed and imperfect. Itâs a pretty big theme in many texts, not just in our friend William Shakespeareâs. Human fallibility is to blame for a lot of the going-ons in âMeasure for Measureâ. Angelo takes the law too seriously, he gets heart eyes for Isabella and kills Claudio even though he thinks heâs slept with Isabella. Why? He wants to save his own ass, fearing Claudio will seek vengeance. The Duke is flawed too. Heâs a leader, but he just avoids his problems, leaving Angelo in charge to deal with them. Then he plans to swoop in and look like a hero. Kinda dodgy. Consider Claudio and Juliet too. They, like Angelo, succumbed to lust and slept together before they were officially married. (Sigh, humans just canât get it right.) Itâs also worth thinking about the âlow-livesâ and poorer characters. Are the poor frail in a different way? For example, Mistress Overdone keeps Lucioâs secrets for him. In that way she is virtuous. However, she sells her body to survive. Perhaps she is not prone to desire like Angelo, but serves another desire - a desire to survive?\n\nIn terms of historical context, consider the Divine Right of Kings, the Great Chain of Being and Playhouses/Brothels.\n\nâThey say best men are moulded out of faults, and for the most become much more the better for being a little badâ - Mariana pleads to Isabella to support her in begging the Duke to pardon (her new husband) Angelo. She is optimistic for man, believing our bad deeds can lead to self-improvement. (Act 5, Scene 5, Line 473-475)\n\nâWhy, all the souls that were were forfeit onceâ - Isabella pleads to Angelo to pardon Claudio. She states that all souls were flawed before Christ offered redemption. (Act 2, Scene 2, Line 93)\n\nâI speak not as desiring more, but rather wishing a more strict restraintâ - Isabella is speaking to a nun as she is poised to enter the ranks of the nunnery. We usually think of a nun as living a very strict life, but Isabella wants it even stricter! Here we see her flaw is that her thinking is too singular and blinkered. (Act 1, Scene 5, Line 3-4)\n\nâLord Angelo is precise, stands at guard with envy, scarce confesses that his blood flows, or that his appetite is more to bread than stone.â - The Duke talks about how unhuman Angelo is. The deputy follows rules very closely, almost to the point where heâs like a machine. His nature is too strict. Â (Act 1, Scene 5, Line 53-56)\n\nâI love the people, but do not like to stage me to their eyesâ - The Duke says this to Angelo and Escalus as he hands over power to his deputy. Even the Duke is not perfect, in that he does not like being before crowds of his people (Act 1, Scene 2, Line 72-73)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare suggests that no one is truly perfect, not even a leader supposedly ordained by God, a law-abiding deputy, or a maiden who is poised to enter a nunnery. Yet while Angelo is overcome by his lust and emotion, the Duke and Isabella attempt to better themselves by showing mercy and temperance. Maybe Shakespeare suggests trying to improve oneâs flawed self is most important.\n\nGod, Religion and Spirituality\n\nPhew, weâre at our last theme. So, society in Vienna is very much religious. Their beliefs dictate actions and laws within the city. Some very religious characters include Isabella and Angelo. However, our novice nun, who is obsessed with virtue and chastity, agrees to and takes part in the bed-trick, a deception that is not particularly Christian. Our lusty deputy also succumbs, hellishly propositioning a maiden to sleep with him in exchange for her brotherâs life. Even The Duke, supposedly semi-divine, makes some dubious choices. He spends most of the play posed as a holy man, even though he is not. He plans the bed-trick to deceive Angelo and lets poor Isabella think her poor brother is dead, instead of saving her so much pain. Furthermore, the title of the tale, âMeasure for Measureâ, comes from the Gospel of Matthew. (See symbols/motifs for more deets). The question of how much we should let religion dictate us is another reason this piece is a problem play.\n\nThe theme of God and Religion can link to historical context such as the Divine Right of Kings.\n\nâmore than our brother is our chastityâ - (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 194) and âBetter it were a brother died at once, than that a sister by redeeming him should die foreverâ - (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 111-113) show that Isabella values her chastity and virtue over her brother!! Damn girl!\n\nâAy, but to die, and go we know not where, to lie in cold obstruction and to rotâ - Claudio tells Isabella that he fears the uncertainty of death. Perhaps his belief in a heaven has left him in the wake of his impending death? (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 129-130)\n\nâLetâs write good angel on the devilâs horns - âtis not the devil's crestâ - Angelo is talking to himself about his lust for Isabella. Itâs an appearance vs reality (ooh another theme!) kind of idea, where you can try to pretend something is something else (ie. Angelo doesn't lust after Isabella), but it doesn't change the thing (ie. heâs still keen). The deputy is comparing his emotions to these religious extremes. (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 16-17)\n\nPerhaps Shakespeare criticises religious extremism in his portrayal of characters like Isabella and Angelo. Or maybe he just wants us to remain open-minded about ideas and our spirituality.\n\nYikes, there are so many themes in this play! Letâs move it along, and talk a little bit about characters.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nEach character can be viewed in different lights, even more so than themes can be. Weâre going to discuss characters very briefly because itâs up to you how you want to read them.\n\nHere are the characters, in order of how much they speak in the play. To keep things short, letâs pretend these are all tinder bios. Who would you swipe right on? (Hint: not Lucio)\n\nThe Duke\n\nsuper chill (the benevolent ruler of Vienna whoâs let the laws slip a little)\n\nloves dressing up (actually spends most of the play disguised as a friar)\n\nclever/cunning (secretly counteracts the injustices decreed by Angelo)\n\nIsabella\n\nstrong morals (would rather her brother die than she lives in shame)\n\ncan get wild (conspires with the Duke to complete the bed-trick)\n\nholy gal (poised to enter a nunnery)\n\nLucio\n\na gentleman (well, his title is. Heâs rude about the Duke and abandoned a prostitute that he got pregnant, so maybe heâs not that kind of gentleman)\n\nloves attention (legit! Heâs a minor character but he has the third most lines of them all! Lucio loves to stir the pot!)\n\nloves some symbolism (Lucio represents all the bad stuff in Viennaâ¦..see symbols/motifs)\n\nAngelo\n\nplays by the rules (a little too much)\n\nhypocrite (Sentences Claudio to death for sex before marriage, while asking the same thing of Isabellaâ¦. wow weâve found our antagonist)\n\nDeep (Angelo is a bit of a complex character. He seems aware of his misdeeds and struggles to deal with these desires. Itâs hard not to pity him at times)\n\nEscalus\n\nreliable (consistently counsels Angelo against acting too harshly)\n\nvirtuous (heâs merciful, lets Pompey go with a warning in Act 2 Scene 1)\n\nloyal (trusts in the Duke)\n\nProvost\n\nhard worker (heâs a prison ward)\n\nvirtuous (does whatâs right by him, disobeying Angeloâs orders to behead Claudio)\n\nmagician (not really, but he makes Angelo believe that pirate Ragozineâs head is Claudioâs)\n\nPompey\n\nclever (philosophically debates whether prostitution is worse than murder)\n\nfunny (his character is the clown, and heâs got some sassy comebacks)\n\npoor (Pompey is a bawd employed by Mistress Overdone.

For instance, the fact that Iâve used a bad soup metaphor AND a tinder reference means I need to go outside more. But letâs move onâ¦\n\nTitle\n\nThe title, âMeasure for Measureâ draws from the gospel of Matthew. The idea of heavenly justice vs earthly justice is prominent throughout the text. Moreover, itâs worth exploring the Old Testament ways of âan eye for an eyeâ and âmeasure for measureâ in comparison to the New Testament teachings which lean towards forgiveness and mercy. Now, where do the Dukeâs actions fit in? Is he harsh and equalising? Is he just and sympathetic? Â\n\nNew Testament vs. Old Testament\n\nWhen the Duke sentences Angelo to death, he makes a fancy speech which includes the playâs title.\n\nââAn Angelo for Claudio, death for death!\n\nHaste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure.\n\nLike doth quit like, and measure still for measure.â\n\nAct 5, Scene 1, Line 439-441\n\nThis mimics the Old Testament views, which famously states âeye for eye, tooth for toothâ (Exodus 21:24). These ideals teach that the person who committed a misdeed shall have the same misdeed done unto them. (For example, if you donât like my new Facebook profile picture, Iâm not liking yoursâ¦..but way more severe.)\n\nIn comparison, the New Testament states that we âBe merciful, just as your Father is merciful. Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.â (Luke 6:36-37)\n\nSo, when sentencing Angelo the Duke employs the words of the Old Testament. However, he doesnât go through with Angeloâs execution, instead showing the mercy encouraged by the New Testament. Heâs not really following either way. Perhaps heâs instead choosing a middle road; one of temperance and justice.\n\nLucio\n\nWait, who? We havenât mentioned the âgentlemanâ Lucio much in the plot and in this blog post. Thatâs because he doesnât really do that much other than buzz around and annoy everyone. Maybe thatâs why his name rhymes with mosquitoâ¦.\n\nRegardless, we do see enough of Lucioâs character to learn that heâs not a very nice person. He treats Mistress Overdone and Pompey poorly, makes visits to the brothel, doesnât take responsibility for his actions (getting Kate Keepdown pregnant) and bad-mouths the Duke. So yeah, we donât like Lucio, whatâs the big deal? Well, in Act 4, Scene 4 Line 182, Lucio says something very intriguing.\n\nâI am a kind of burr, I shall stick.â\n\nBurr - those little brown prickly things that get stuck to you.\n\nWe can think of Lucio as representing all the sins and misdeeds in Vienna - lechery, immorality, lack of justice, selfishness etc. Hence, Lucio is saying that these shortcomings and flaws will always be present to people and in Vienna, sticking to the city like a nasty burr. Damn, thatâs deep.\n\nProse/Verse\n\nThe metre of the verse (ie. the classic Shakespeare writing) in ââMeasure for Measureâ Â is iambic pentameter. This means that each line is divided into 5 feet. Within each foot, there is one unstressed syllable followed by a stressed one.\n\nConsider:\n\nIâll TELL him YET of ANgelOâS reQUEST, And FIT his MIND to DEATH, for HIS soulâs REST. (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 195-196)\n\nVerse does not have to rhyme, as the above lines do. Shakespeare often employs a rhyming couplet to close a scene and add some drama.\n\nVerse is usually reserved for the higher class citizens, with those who are less fortunate speaking in prose.\n\nProse is language in its ordinary form, with no metre.\n\nCertain characters, such as Lucio, switch between verse and prose depending on who they are speaking to. This could allude to Lucioâs duplicity, or perhaps a deep understanding of class divides in Vienna.\n\nNames: Escalus and Angelo\n\nEscalus is the ever reasonable and loyal lord and close confidant of the Duke. His name gives connotations of scales and balance - characteristic of the rational man.\n\nAngeloâs name has connotations of âangelâ. If we judge him only by his name, he should be a pure and heavenly being. Bah! Thatâs so fake! We can see that appearance is very different from reality. Isabella notices this too, stating that âthis outward-sainted deputy...is yet a devilâ (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 95-98).\n\nAngeloâs Words/Actions\n\nThere is so much to unpack about this douchebag. Let us briefly consider 2 ideas. When he propositions Isabella to sleep with him, he requests that she âlay down the treasures of (her) bodyâ (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 100).\n\nFirstly, thatâs weird. Perhaps Angelo can be seen as someone who is obsessed with the physical - Isabellaâs body and treasure. Maybe this obsession leads to his immorality and poor leadership.\n\nSecondly, Angelo struggles to directly say, âhey, letâs sleep togetherâ. He weaves his way around the request, propositioning Isabella so indirectly that at first, she does not even seem to understand his request! However, once she threatens to tell everyone about his vile demand, he speaks bluntly; âWho will believe thee, Isabel?â (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 163). Perhaps this shows Angelo is self-aware that heâs being an ass. Or maybe this scene is yet more evidence of a patriarchal society, with the men knowing very well the power they hold.\n\nRagozine\n\nWe never actually meet this fellow. Ragozine is a pirate who dies in jail while âMeasure for Measureâ unfolds. His head is used in place of Claudioâs to convince Angelo of the formerâs execution. Fascinatingly, Ragozine is the only person who dies in the entire play. ALSO, he dies of natural causes. Interesting. It feels like the play is full of death, grief and many heads on the chopping block. But curiously, there is only one death, of a minor character, of natural causes. Perhaps this says something about fate and justice or offers some commentary on life and hope.\n\nElbow vs. Pompey\n\nElbow is a silly policeman who speaks in malapropisms (using a similar but incorrect word for humorous effect). Pompey is a clever pimp who seems to have a deep understanding of justice and the Viennese people. The comparison of these characters, fortunate and dumb to unfortunate and clever, perhaps serves to show that the law is not always apt and that sometimes those who break the law are more clever than it.\n\nMistress Overdone (or lack thereof)\n\nMistress Overdone is a pitiable prostitute. She worries for her survival when Angelo begins pulling down the brothels, and she keeps Lucioâs bastard child a secret, only for him to throw her under the bus to save his own skin. The last we see of Mistress Overdone is her getting carted off to prison, crying âSee how he goes about to abuse me!â (Act 3, Scene 1, Line 481) Yes, the last we witness of one of five speaking female characters is of her imminent incarceration. Furthermore, this happens in Act 3 of 5, around halfway through the play! The audience never hears from Mistress Overdone again, and her future is left uncertain. Even Barnadine, a convicted murderer, is given freedom and a happy ending.\n\nConsider writing a few sentences of your essay from a feministâs perspective. Think about the events of the play from the female charactersâ points of view. What is Shakespeare saying by portraying Mistress Overdone (and other women) in such a way? Perhaps he is pointing out the injustices of the patriarchal system, or how uncertain a womanâs life was in his contemporary time.\n\nâMeasure for Measureâ truly is an incredible text. This blog post is by no means an exhaustive list of all its quirks and complexities. This playâs relevance has survived centuries, and I believe it will continue to be pertinent to audiences well into the future. You are very lucky to be studying a text with such universal themes and ideas that you can carry with you even after high school.\n\nIf you are anything like me, the thought of standing up in front of a classroom, or even a small panel of teachers, having to hold the floor for five minutes, and being assessed on your performance is just about as terrifying as it gets. Where other students thrived on the oral presentation SAC, embracing its change of pace in comparison to the other written tasks, I dreaded it. I knew the feeling all too well: legs jelly-like and quivering, breath short and rapid, palms sweating, tongue uncomfortably heavy as the words tumble out too fast to keep up withâ¦essentially (as I, a true master of the English language, would put it) the absolute worst.Â\n\nFast forward to the present day and, I hate to break it to you, I am still not a fan of public speaking. But guess what? I did my oral presentation and Iâm still alive to tell the tale. Plus, as a bonus, it did not involve me passing out, and as a double bonus, I still ended up with a great result. So I am here, my fellow members of the âMight Go Ahead and Drop Out of VCE so I Donât Have To Do My Oralâ club, as proof that it can be done and to help you get through it.Â\n\nWhat Do We Mean by âOvercomingâ?\n\nAs I have already mentioned, emerging triumphant from your oral does not require you to magically become a public speaking fanatic. Let me manage your expectations right now: that probably isnât going to happen overnight, and likely never will. But you can still be good at public speaking, perhaps great at it, even if it scares you. Trying to figure out a magical formula of preparation that will have you breezing through the oral in total zen-mode is not only going to waste your time, but will likely also make you more frightened when you realise that you canât completely shake the nerves. So, by accepting the reality that the fear probably isnât going to go away any time soon we can start to learn how to manage it, at least succeed in spite of it, and hopefully even use it to our advantage.Â\n\nSelecting a âWOWâ Topic\n\nArguably the best way to improve the delivery, and overall quality, of your oral presentation is to choose a topic and contention that you actually care about. In our eBook How to Write a Killer Oral Presentation we cite the first pillar of the process as being to choose a âWOWâ topic and contention. As Lisa says,\n\nâan inherently interesting topic means that youâll showcase your opinions in an authentic way, which is incredibly important when it comes to presentation time.â\n\nThis becomes particularly significant for someone dealing with a fear of public speaking because of this basic principle: when you care about something it is easier to talk about, even in front of other people. This means that you donât just need to choose a topic that will engage your audience, but also one that you yourself find engaging.Â\n\nFear is an intense emotional response to a situation, and as we know it can easily consume us in the moment. If your oral topic is boring and does not interest you on a personal level then what is going to be the strongest emotion you feel when delivering it? Fear. However, passion is another intense emotional response, and so if you are passionate about the arguments you are making then, although your fear will still be there, you will feel another strong emotion that can balance it out.Â\n\nSo how do you find a contention that you care about? Often the best place to start is to think about the things that affect your life. We know that your topic has to have been in the media since September of last year, but lots of things are on the news and they donât only matter to the older generations. Think about issues that relate to schools, jobs, climate change, animals, drug-taking, fashion â these are all aspects of our lives that you might be able to form a personal connection to, and that personal connection will help you find the passion you need to get through the speech, and also get through to your audience. Check out our 2021 Oral Presentation Topics for some topic inspiration, and then learn how to create a killer contention here.Â\n\nMore About the Voice, Less About the Words\n\nIt is quite likely that if you know you struggle with the delivery of oral presentations, you might try to compensate by overreaching with your script. For someone who feels more comfortable with written assessments, it can be easy to try to make the oral as close to one as possible by writing it almost as you would an essay â using lots of impressive vocabulary, complex sentences and a formal structure. This approach is all well and good until you try to say it all out loud. This isnât to say that your command of language isnât important to the oral, but by trying to craft a safety net of eloquent, written words you are simply distracting yourself from what makes this SAC unique; you canât avoid the fear by avoiding the task altogether. So, you need to write a speech that you can say, not just one that sounds good on paper. Writing with the wrong sense of tone is one of the points we touch on in 5 Common Oral Presentation Mistakes.\n\nDuring the writing process, you need to make your speech work for you rather than make yourself work for it. This means constantly thinking about what the words will sound like in front of an audience, and not making the performance unnecessarily hard for yourself before you even start practicing. When youâre already nervous about speaking in front of other people, the last thing you want to have to worry about is tripping over difficult language to make convoluted arguments. So, simplicity and punch is always better than verbosity and pretence. Here are some ideas of how to use this strategy:\n\nMake your arguments short, sharp, and to the point. Avoid going off on any tangents, and just stick to the main points you need to get across. You are trying to persuade your audience, not confuse them.Â\n\nUse a mixture of long and short sentences, because a script that uses varied sentence structures is easier to say out loud without stumbling due to nerves. Short, bold statements are both less prone to being mangled by nerves and more memorable for your listeners â just make sure you donât only use short sentences and prevent your oral from flowing.Â\n\nThink about where you can schedule in pauses for emphasis, because these will give you space to stop and catch your breath without revealing your nervousness.Â\n\nWrite like you speak! Of course you want your tone to be assertive and intelligent, but it is possible to maintain this whilst also incorporating some relaxed language. You are allowed to use the first person in this task, so take the opportunity to personalise what you say, which will help you appear more comfortable and also form a personal connection with your audience. Remember that an oral is essentially a conversation with your audience, even if they donât get to speak back, and this means that as long as you donât use slang you can have some fun with your delivery.Â\n\nDonât rely on an essay-like structure. Your audience wonât know when a paragraph ends, so the way the script looks on the page is largely irrelevant. Make it easy for yourself to follow.Â\n\nRemember, when you struggle with a fear of public speaking it is difficult to make what you say in the spotlight sound natural. To overcome this, you want to prepare yourself to almost sound unscripted (as ironic as that sounds). Without slipping into an overly casual or informal voice, it is best if you sound comfortable and relaxed when addressing your audience. This is of course the exact opposite of how you might feel going into the assessment, so you write a speech that will make you seem like you arenât worried about passing out. The ancient adage âfake it âtil you make it babyâ definitely rings true here. However, that said, really believing what you are saying and caring that the audience believes it too, as we advised earlier, will also help you avoid sounding forced and uncomfortable.Â\n\nPreparation and Memorisation\n\nAnother mistake often made when attempting to compensate for a fear of public speaking is to rely too heavily on cue cards in the oral. Having your entire speech on hand when you complete the assessment just in case you get lost might seem like a good idea, but it is most likely actually going to hold you back from giving your best performance. Ideally, you want to have done enough preparation so that you do not need to look at your notes at all. As we discussed earlier, having a script that is as simple as possible, and that mimics your speech patterns, will help you sound less fearful â and will also be easier to memorise.\n\nMemorise your speech by practicing it as much as possible. Make sure to get your script written as far in advance as you can, so you have plenty of time to practice without stressing yourself out further. When you do practice, do so standing up, envision an audience in front of you (or practice in front of friends or family), and rehearse how you might move around the space as you talk. You can start by having your whole script with you, but eventually you should work up to only needing a few dot points for each section that can jog your memory if you forget. This strategy might seem to make the speech even scarier, but in reality not reading off a script will help you relax into the performance, and allow you to focus on your movements and voice. Practicing enough to have the speech memorised will also help build your confidence.Â\n\nMaking the Most of Your Nerves\n\nAs much as I would love to tell you that you can be âcuredâ of your fear of public speaking, it is best to accept that the nerves are going to be there and learn how to succeed in tandem with them, rather than just hoping that they go away. Instead of being convinced that fear is going to be your downfall, try to think about how, as impossible as it sounds, you can use the nerves to your advantage. Apart from making you jittery and uncomfortable, nerves also boost your energy and adrenaline, and with the right attitude you can turn this energy into confidence. Instead of letting your nerves cause you to close up, you can use them to help you open up. Often those of us who fear feeling exposed in front of a crowd have quiet, reserved personalities that we might think of as preventing us from being able to perform. However, when our bodies are flooded with nerves this âwiredâ feeling can be used to help us project our voices and to take up space, therefore driving us to appear more outgoing. Instead of just making you feel âon edgeâ, a manageable amount of nervous energy can give you an edge that will amp up your performance.Â\n\nEven if all of this sounds completely different to your experience of fear, what I am trying to communicate is that the way you frame the oral, and the nerves that come with it, in your mind makes all the difference. If you convince yourself that you are too scared of public speaking to ever succeed with this task, you are severely limiting your chances of achieving a positive outcome. So, focussing on retraining your mindset in the lead up to delivering your speech is very important. Try not to think of this one assessment task as being a make or break five minutes, and instead view it as a learning experience that you can use to your advantage. After all, public speaking is something most of us will have to deal with multiple times over the course of our lives, so you may as well work on getting better at it. That said, my number one piece of advice about the oral presentation is toâ¦*drumroll please*...not take it too seriously! This might sound unrealistic, and I am definitely not telling you to put in less effort, but the more pressure you put on yourself the more nervous you are going to be. Choose a topic that interests you, believe in your contention, make use of humour and personal anecdotes, and just have fun with what you say! Your fear is probably going to be your biggest obstacle, so make it as easy as you can on yourself and the rest should fall into placeâ¦as long as you put in the work.Â\n\nFinally, our Ultimate Guide to Oral Presentations is a must-read for anybody who is doing an Oral Presentation!\n\nThe scariest part of the EAL exam, while might not be the most daunting task, is probably getting your head wrapped around an unfamiliar language analysis task under time condition. Jargons and difficult terms might be used, and some articles tend to not be so straightforward making this task more challenging for EAL students. This blog post aims to alleviate this fear for all EAL students as much as possible and better your performance in the end-of-year exams. After reading this, I'd highly recommend our Ultimate Guide To Language Analysis as you study for your next SAC or exam.\n\nReading Comprehension\n\nTo understand and analyse an article well, you will need to know the writerâs contention well, identifying whether they are for or against an idea. Most language analysis articles are written on an issue, which is why it is important to spot what the issue is and the writerâs stance. Most of the time, the writerâs contention is found at the beginning of the article, in the title, though there are times it is found at the end of the article. Sometimes, skimming through an article might be sufficient for you to find its main point.\n\nSpotting and understanding arguments, on the other hand, might be much more difficult as they can be found anywhere within the articles and the number of arguments contained varies from articles to articles.\n\nThe good news is, there is no right or wrong answer in English so there is no need to be too worried about whether what you are writing is âpreciseâ or not. In order to look for arguments and âchunk the reading passageâ in the most efficient way, you should be paying attention to the ways the writer tries to structure the article (e.g. paragraphs, headings and subheadings if there are any, etc). More than often arguments can be found at the beginning of paragraphs (writers might also use that good old Topic-Evidence-Example-Linking structure in drafting their piece) and sometimes two consecutive paragraphs focus on one singular argument.\n\nAlso, arguments should be specific and support the writerâs contention. For instance, if the contention is âtechnology ameliorates Americansâ standards of livingâ, the arguments might be something along the lines of âit is beneficial as it improves efficiency in workplace environmentâ or âit allows people to communicate easilyâ. Trying to make an educated guess on what the arguments might look like will definitely help if you already know the contention of the article.\n\nLanguage barriers might be an issue if the writer uses technical terms related to an unfamiliar area (e.g. an article about âpneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanokoniosisâ, a lung disease caused by a certain type of dust, might pop up â highly unlikely but thank me later if it does come up). This is why dictionaries are there to help us and they are a must-have coming into EAL exams and SACs. You are allowed to bring bilingual dictionaries as well, so make sure you have a good set of dictionaries that you can bring into SACs and exams. Regardless of how fluent you are, there is still a possibility that they use one if not more than one unfamiliar term in your language analysis articles.\n\nHowever, it is not always difficult to guess the meaning of the word without using the dictionary (time restraints!!) by looking at the sentence as a whole. The location of the words within a sentence might allow you to make a reasonable guess of what type of words it is or what it might mean. If it is the subject or object of the sentence, it is either a pronoun, a noun or a name. If the word is after a subject, it is likely to be a verb which describes an action! To familiarise yourself with sentence structure further, read my guide on The Keys To English Fluency and Proficiency.\n\nAnswering Reading Comprehension Questions\n\nSection C, Question 1 requires students to write short answers, in note form or sentences, which altogether will make up of 50% of the marks in Section C. I am not sure about you but for a lot of students, getting good marks for Question 1 is much easier than getting good marks for Question 2, which requires you to write a full language analysis essay. This is why it is important that you are able to maximise your marks in this question because they are purported to be easier marks to get! Some of the questions will ask the students for factual information but more difficult questions will require to think about that is contained in the text and make an interpretation based on your understanding.\n\n1. Question words\n\nTo know what sort of answer you are expected to give before looking for details from the article, you need to be familiar with question words.\n\nWHO - A particular person or group of people impacted by an incident or involved in a situation\n\nWHAT - This really depends. It might require you to give out information about something or to identify reasons for the writerâs opinions (which is good it might make it easier for you to find the writerâs arguments)\n\nWHEN - The timeframe within which an issue or event occurred (date, day, etc)\n\nWHERE - The location of an event\n\nWHY - The reasons for something\n\nHOW - How a problem can be resolved\n\n2. Direction words\n\nUnfortunately, not all questions in this section have âquestion wordsâ and examiners usually give out questions that are broader using âdirection wordsâ or âtask wordsâ, making this section more challenging for students. EAL is not the only subject that requires students to know their direction words well so it is definitely worthwhile learning these words to improve your performance. These are the most common direction words used in Section C (see below!).\n\nâ\n\nDescribe\n\nGiving information about something or to identify the writerâs opinions\n\nâ\n\nExplain\n\nThis requires you to give out information in your own words and elaborate\n\nâ\n\nIdentify\n\nStudents will be required to find what is asked from the article and write them down in the briefest form possible\n\nâ\n\nList\n\nUsually in note forms â to answer this you need to identify what is asked and briefly noting them down\n\nâ\n\nSummarise\n\nRetelling something in a succinct and concise ways in your own words, it should only be enough to highlight key ideas\n\nâ\n\nSupport\n\nFinding evidence from the text to justify a statement or opinions\n\n3. Marks allocation\n\nAnother super helpful tip is to pay extra attention to the marks allocation of the questions. It usually gives you a fairly accurate indication of how much you should write. The general rule of thumb would be that the number of marks tell students how many sentences or points they should be making.\n\nâ\n\nExample:\n\nIdentify the reasons why the writer loves travelling (2 marks)\n\nStudents should be writing down 2 reasons why the writer loves travellingâ\n\nâ\n\nThe editor strongly opposes the use of plastic bag. Support this statement (3 marks)â\n\nIn this case, it is probably best to find 3 pieces of evidence from the article that justify the statement stated to make sure you do not lose any marks by not writing enough.\n\nâ\n\n4. Sample Questions And Response\n\nMy own response and annotation of Question 1 and Section C of the 2017 EAL exam is below. I really hope it would give you guys a better idea of what is expected from EAL students.\n\nâ\n\nTime Management Tips\n\nLook at the comprehension questions during reading time\n\nI usually used my reading time skimming through the article, looking at the questions and flip back and forth the booklet to look for answers for the questions at the back. The reason why this was the first thing I did was because they often contain clues of what the arguments might me. Questions such as âgive three reasons why the editor thought technology is beneficialâ will help you immediately identify some key ideas and arguments in the article.\n\nâ\n\nLook for key features instead of analysing and finding techniques straight away\n\nI also used the reading time to find the contention, determine what type of article it was and the source, etc. The following acronym might help you! I often tried identifying all of the features below as it also helped me plan my introduction within reading time.\n\nIssue\n\nAuthor\n\nContention\n\nTitle\n\nForm\n\nAudience\n\nSource\n\nTone\n\nFor a detailed guide on How to Write an A+ Language Analysis Introduction, check out our advice here.\n\nâ\n\nSet out a detailed time management plan for your essay the night before the SAC or exams (or earlier if possible)â\n\nBe strict with yourself, know your writing speed and know how long it takes you to write a paragraph.\n\nâ\n\nStick with one introductionâs structure/ format â\n\nIf you are used to writing an introduction that, for instance, starts off by introducing the issue, title of the piece, author, and then the contention, tone, audience then stick with it, or memorise it if you do not have the best writing speed or just do not work well under time pressure.\n\nExample:\n\nWhether or not (issue) is an issue that garners much attention in recent media. In response to this, (author) writes a (form) titled â(title)â to express his disapprobation/endorsement of (issue) to (audience). By adopting a (tone word 1) and (tone word 2), (author) asserts/ articulates/ contends that (contention). With the use of an accompanying visual, the writer enhances the notion that (contention).\n\nâ\n\nNot be way too thorough with annotation â\n\nWhen it comes to performing well under time condition, perfectionism might hinder you from best maximising your marks! Everyone learns differently and has different approaches to this task but it is probably better if we do not spend way too much time annotating the article. While it is important to scan through the article and identify important persuasive techniques, sometimes it is more than sufficient to just circle or highlight the technique instead of colour-coding it, writing down what its effects on the audience, labelling techniques. Donât get me wrong, these aforementioned steps are important, but there is no point writing that information down twice because you will be repeating those steps as you write your essay anyway! Iâd recommend trying out different annotation techniques and see what works for you, but for me minimalism served me well.\n\nâ\n\nCreate your own glossary of words â\n\nSometimes, it takes too much time just sitting down staring at the paper deciding what words you should be using. Weâve all been there, worrying if you have repeated âhighlightâ or âpositionâ way too many time. Memorising a mini glossary might solve this issue and save us writing time. I have included a sample glossary for you to fill in, hopefully it helps you as much as it did me! It might be a good starting point for you.\n\nConvincing the audience toâ¦persuade, position, propel, compel, galvanise, etc\n\nHighlight the idea thatâ¦underscore, enhance, fortify, bolster, etc\n\nEvoke (an emotional response)...elicit, garners, etc\n\nThe writer uses â¦employs, utilises, etc\n\nThe writer criticises â¦critiques, lambastes, chastises, condemns, denounces, etc\n\nâ\n\nPractice!\n\nâAt the end of the day, regardless of how many tips you have learned from this blog, it would not be enough to significantly improve your marks unless you practice frequently. Knowing how long it takes you to write the introduction, or each paragraph will better enable you to finish the essay within the time set and allow you to spend a bit of spare time proofreading your essay. If you are aiming for A+âs, writing every week is probably the best piece of advice I can give because without enough practice, your performance under pressure cannot match up to your usual performance.\n\nContents\n\n1.

Resources to help you prepare for your Oral Presentation\n\nWhat is an Oral Presentation?\n\nFor many VCE English students, the oral presentation is the scariest part of the course; itâs often also the first.\n\nDoing a speech can indeed be dauntingâ youâre marked in real time, you canât go back and edit mistakes, and the writing part itself is only half the battle. Nonetheless, the Oral SAC can also be one of the more dynamic and engaging tasks you complete in VCE English, and thereâs plenty of ways to make it more interesting and also more manageable for yourself.\n\nKeep reading for a comprehensive overview of what you need to know to succeed in your Oral Presentation. Weâve got you covered- from choosing your topic and contention, to writing and presenting your Speech.\n\nWeâll also be suggesting useful resources, Study Guides and YouTube videos that will provide more detailed information and give you more confidence. Letâs get into it!\n\nWhat are you expected to cover in an Oral Presentation? (Oral Presentation Rubric)\n\n1. Your Oral Presentation SAC has two components. The first is the Oral Presentation itself (âa point of view presented in oral formâ), and the second is a Written Explanation, also known as a Statement of Intention.\n\n2. Your selected topic needs to be an issue that has appeared in the media since 1 September of the previous year\n\n3. Your aim for this entire Oral Presentation SAC is to persuade your audience to agree with your contention (whatever that may be) based off the issue youâve selected.\n\nHereâs the raw version of VCAAâs expectations from you, taken from the VCAA website:\n\nHow to choose your Oral Presentation topic\n\n1.Â Select a topic that has appeared in the media since 1 September of the previous year\n\nThis can be time consuming and tricky, especially if you want to choose something a bit more original or fresh.\n\nFirstly, you need an event.Â An event in the VCE English context is anything that happens which also generates opinionated media coverageâso, itâs not just an event but it has to be an event that people have published opinions about, and they have to have been published since September 1.\n\nYou might wonder why we donât go to the issue straight away. Hereâs a hypothetical to illustrate: if you asked me to name an issue, the best I could probably come up with off the top of my head is climate change. However, if you asked me to name an event, Iâd pretty easily recall the Australian bushfiresâsomething much more concrete which a) has generated specific and passionate opinions in the media; and b) can easily be linked to a wider issue such as climate change.\n\nThe ABC news archive is also really helpful for finding events since you can pick dates or periods of time and see a good mix of news events from then. Otherwise, Wikipedia has helpful pages ofÂ events that happened in specific years in specific countries, so â2023 in Australiaâ might well be a starting point.Â\n\nWhen you have your event, you can then look for an issue. This will be a specific debate that comes out of the event, and can usually be framed as a âwhether-or-notâ question. The bushfires, for example, might generate debate around whether or not the Australian government is doing enough to combat climate change, whether or not Scott Morrison has fulfilled his duties as Prime Minister.\n\nMost importantly, choose an issue from an event thatâs interesting and important to you. After all, youâre going to be spending the time researching, writing and presenting!\n\n2. Filter out the boring events/issues\n\nUnderstand who your audience is.\n\nOnce you know who your audience is, ask yourself: Does this event and issue relate to my audience?\n\nThis question matters because âyour aim of this entire Oral Presentation SAC is to persuade your audience to agree with your contention (whatever that may be) based off the issue youâve selected.â This means that what you say to your audience and how they respond to your speech matters.\n\nEven if your assessor isnât counting exactly how many people are still listening to your speech at the end, everyone knows a powerful speech when theyâre in the presence of one - it hooks the audience from start to end - and an assessor, consciously or subconsciously, cannot deny that the collective attentiveness of the room has an influence on their marking of your Oral Presentation.\n\nThatâs why you should choose a topic that your audience can relate to. Also, avoid topics that have too many unfamiliar words, because as soon as thereâs something they donât understand, it becomes much harder for them to follow your speech.\n\nNow you may be asking yourself; what is the best topic for oral presentation?\n\nHere are some example topics from previous years to give you inspiration:\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2014\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2015\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2016\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2017\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2018\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2019\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2020\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2021\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2022\n\nVCE English Oral Presentation Topics 2023\n\nFor more detailed information on choosing a topic, read my blog Choosing a WOW topic for your VCE Oral Presentationâ\n\nHow to choose your oral presentation contention\n\nOnce you've chosen an interesting topic and have researched all of its different viewpoints, it's time to formulate your contention.\n\nOften, creating a killer contention is about avoiding some common traps that will make your overall presentation boring, bland and just like the rest of your cohorts'.\n\nSo, there are three things I like to AVOID:\n\n1. Broad, Overarching statements\n\n2. A Contention That Is Just Plain Obvious\n\n3. Avoid A Contention That Is Generally Accepted As True In Todayâs Age\n\nFor more information on writing a contention, read my blog Creating a Killer Contention for your Oral Presentation â\n\nHow to write your speechÂ\n\n1. Have a CAPTIVATING introduction sentence; use a short, clear and powerful sentence.\n\n2. RELATE to your audience so that it keeps them interested so they actually WANT to listen.\n\n3. If you are taking on a persona, firstly study and UNDERSTAND your character.\n\n4. Donât forget your persuasive techniques. I usually use repetition in conjunction with the ârule of threeâ.\n\n5. Remember that you are writing a SPEECH, not an essay. Instil your oral with emotion, varied tone and sentence lengths.\n\nIn fact, I've talked about a few of these in a 'Must Dos and Don'ts' video. If you haven't seen it yet, watch below before you read on.\n\n4 Tips on Presenting Your Speech\n\n1. Body Language\n\nConfidence is key. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and, more importantly donât move your legs. Especially if youâre nervous, swaying or shuffling will be noticeable and make you appear more nervousâwhen you practise, pay attention to the lower half of your body and train it to stay still if possible.\n\nThat being said, do use your arms for gestures. Those are more natural and will help engage the audience, though donât overdo it eitherâusually, holding cue cards in one hand frees up the other but also stops you from going overboard.\n\n2. Eye contact\n\nCue cards brings up another important consideration- eye contact. Hold cue cards in one hand as high as you can without it feeling uncomfortable. This means you donât have to take your eyes away from the audience for too long or too noticeably to check your notes.\n\nEye contact increases your engagement with the audience. It also gives the impression of confidence and that youâve been practicing and know your speech inside and out!\n\n3. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse\n\nIn a best case scenario, you wonât need to rely on your cue cards as you will have your speech basically memorised! Read your speech aloud and pretend that youâre actually delivering your speech. This means:\n\n- Looking up ahead\n\n- Holding the cue cards in the right spot; and\n\n- Not just reading the words, but speaking as if to an audience\n\nÂ Itâs extremely helpful to also practice your speech to an actual audience! Practice in front of your family and friends. An alternative is to put a sticker next to your camera and record yourself. The sticker will help indicate where you should create eye contact. Look back at the video and give yourself some feedback, you might be surprised at your presentation!\n\n4. Tone variation\n\nTone variation involves emphasising certain words, using pauses or slowing down for effect, or modifying volume. Incorporating some of these elements- even writing them into your notes by bolding/italicising/underlining will help you break out of monotony and make the speech more engaging.\n\nBe sure to emphasise emotive language and any evidence you might use to illustrate your arguments. Most importantly, donât speak too quickly!\n\n5 things to keep in mind while writing the written explanation\n\nFor oral presentation based written explanations, the VCAA study design requests students write...\n\n\"A written statement of intention to accompany the studentâs own oral presentation, articulating the intention of decisions made in the planning process, and how these demonstrate understanding of argument and persuasive language.\"\n\nUsing the topic, 'Why we need to stop crying 'cultural appropriation' when cultural exchange is far more important, âletâs see how this can be done with FLAPC with some examples below:\n\n1. Form\n\n2. Language\n\n3. Audience\n\n4. Purpose\n\n5.
