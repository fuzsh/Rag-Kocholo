        "text": "The UWS curriculum consists of two major units: a comparative analysis and an extended unit on research. The comparative analysis unit consists of a close reading predraft assignment, a comparative analysis essay and a comparative genre analysis assignment. The CGA asks students to read writing from varying disciplines and work independently and in groups to identify how writing across the disciplines varies and is similar in content, style, and organization. The research unit consists of an extensive research proposal and a research essay.\n\nAs part of the University Writing Seminar, students attend one or more Critical Conversations in which faculty from different departments meet to discuss a topic chosen for that academic year; for 2021-2022, for example, the topic was \"Community.\" This part of the course brings first-year students into direct contact with scholarly discourse and the variety of ways in which Brandeis faculty engage with each other and the world.\n\nStudents are invited to continue the conversations in follow-up, small-group discussions. Each University Writing Seminar also assigns an experiential-learning activity to expand the boundaries of the conventional classroom.\n\nThe University Writing Seminar for Multilingual Students (UWS-MLS) is an option for students to participate in a learning community with fellow students whose first or strongest language is not English. This course is the same as a standard UWS in terms of credit, curriculum, and learning goals, but sections are taught by faculty with training and experience to address the concerns and needs of multilingual writers. Topics specifically focus on multicultural or translingual themes. As in every UWS, UWS-MLS challenges students to formulate meaningful ideas, support those ideas with evidence and analysis, and convey thinking clearly and persuasively. Every seminar teaches transferable writing skills that students will use across the Brandeis curriculum and beyond. As students complete a series of writing assignments, they engage in a process of reading, drafting, reviewing, revising, and working collaboratively in peer groups and individually with instructors. All students must complete a UWS or UWS-MLS during their first year at Brandeis.\n\nUWS-01A-2: Success Across Cultures\n\nScott Moore\n\nFall 2024: Tuesday, Friday 11:10 am - 12:30 pm “Pull yourself up by the bootstraps.” “Jeder ist seines Glückes Schmied.” (“Everyone is the blacksmith of their own fortune.”) “Zìlì gēngshēng” (“Self-reliance”). In today’s global world, ideals of self-making and merit-based success transcend cultural and geographic boundaries. Some critics have argued that meritocracy — a system rewarding talent and effort over birth privilege — is “the closest thing we have today to a universal ideology.” But to what extent is modern society actually meritocratic? Does meritocracy necessarily lead to greater equality, social justice, or a sense of fulfillment? And how are meritocrats represented when they manage to succeed (or fail)? Tracing concepts of merit and mobility through the American dream and other cross-cultural ideologies of success, this course will examine aesthetic representations, popular writing, and scholarship across multiple disciplines. By the end of the course, students will have developed the analytical and academic research skills to contextualize and interrogate different cultural representations of success, merit, and mobility of their own choosing.\n\nThe University Writing Seminar for Multilingual Students (UWS-MLS) is an option for students to participate in a learning community with fellow students whose first or strongest language is not English.

From Thelma and Louise, a female buddy road crime film, to acclaimed food critic Anthony Bourdain, who samples foods from across the globe, travel has long worked in popular culture to offer the tantalizing possibilities of reinvention, of getting lost, of escape into the new. However, travel is more than just a romantic fantasy about self-transformation. In fact, British travel essayist Pico Iyer argues that our travel experiences are always structured by our preconceptions about ourselves and the world; for Iyer, we can never completely escape from ourselves. Building on the ideas of Iyer and others, we will investigate what we do when we travel and the motivations that drive the urge to explore. How does travel relate to identity, gender, and self-discovery? In this course, we will probe this question and others by watching films and reading texts from a variety of genres and disciplines, examining the desires, pressures, and delusions that propel us to hit the open road or take flight. Building on ideas from the course, students will be encouraged to write papers that engage with issues related to travel and self-exploration that they find compelling.\n\nThe University Writing Seminar for Multilingual Students (UWS-MLS) is an option for students to participate in a learning community with fellow students whose first or strongest language is not English.

At first glance, it is easy to understand why: as an alternative to the various pressures felt worldwide – the aftermath of COVID, economic uncertainty, stifling social norms – the pastel-suffused, meticulously choreographed world of K-pop offers a decidedly brighter, untroubled vision of reality. On the other hand, films like Parasite, Memories of Murder, and Snowpiercer present a world governed by callous greed, inflexible hierarchies, and incomprehensible violence. Locating Korean music and films among current social and economic forces, this course will try to better understand their popularity. Beginning with BTS’s meteoric ascent during COVID, we will consider what kinds of pleasures K-pop offers and why those pleasures are deeply appealing for so many. By exploring the alternative models of community, identity, and belonging depicted in K-pop – and how those models are challenged in Korean films – we will obtain a deeper appreciation of the complexity of contemporary Korean media. No knowledge of Korean is necessary.\n\nAmong animals, individuals choose mates based on biologically informative features such as long colorful tail feathers, large canines, or a red, swollen posterior. We typically assume that human attraction (and love) is much more nuanced and complex ... but is it? Many features that humans find beautiful or attractive, such as small waists, curvy hips, and large eyes, can be tied to biological explanations. Even behavioral features, such as nurturing behaviors, may be attractive for adaptive reasons. In this course, we will explore and write about biological explanations for these and many other aspects of human attraction. Using an evolutionary perspective, we will examine global patterns of attraction and challenge stereotypes of beauty. Do nice guys really finish last? Do traditionally attractive features in western cultures — such as low body weight — actually provide an evolutionary benefit, or might some preferences be culturally derived? For the final essay, students will supplement library research with data collection to produce an interdisciplinary research paper.\n\nElissa Jacobs\n\nJoey and Chandler, Woody and Buzz, Thelma and Louise, Will and Grace, Harry and Lloyd, Romy and Michelle, Hermoine and Harry: over the years, popular culture has offered a plethora of “friendship” examples through its depictions of “besties” and “bosom-buddies.” These examples naturally reflect the changing societal values and cultural norms from which they emerge. This course will examine many depictions of friendship and consider what assumptions they convey in their time and place. Through reading a chosen novel or short story, watching a television episode of Friends or Black Mirror, or critically examining a movie like Toy Story or Clueless, we will seek answers to questions like: What are the benefits of friendship? What role does gender play in friendship? What do friendship-depictions tell us about how audiences view and participate in friendship? What assumptions about friendship are made in these depictions?\n\nCarey Slaeker\n\nHumans often consider themselves to be \"the moral animal,\" distinguished from other animals by our complex and socially derived systems of morality, characterized by empathy and cooperation. However, when comparing humans with the rest of the animal world, are we really so different? In this course, we will examine through discussion and writing the degree to which human morality is grounded in our evolutionary past. We will explore the development of human morality during childhood and adulthood through the lens of evolution and will look at classic scientific tests of morality/ethics (e.g., the trolley problem). Additionally, we will engage with evidence for morality in non-human species and probe the degree to which our primate relatives engage in altruistic, empathetic, and moral behaviors. During the final paper, students will have the freedom to choose their own topic and to utilize interdisciplinary literature in their exploration of the nature and nurture of morality. Usually offered every year.\n\nElissa Jacobs\n\nStorytelling plays a crucial role in our lives. We draw on stories to make meaning of ourselves and others, to shed light on our experiences, and to express who we are or would like to be. The same holds true for businesses. Storytelling is not only a core competency of business leaders but an indispensable component of functional organizations. Successful companies take pride in compelling stories; troubled companies tend to lack institutional stories and a culture of storytelling. Capable business leaders are effective storytellers, and strategic storytelling has been a proven means of initiating change and of turning companies around. This course invites students to investigate the power of stories and storytelling in business contexts. By analyzing texts from various media, we will discuss questions such as: What characterizes effective stories? What is the importance of storytelling and story-making in companies? How can storytelling bring about organizational change? Which traits do storytellers and business leaders share? What is the connection between storytelling and leadership?\n\nKatrin Fischer\n\nVideo games afford opportunities to immerse ourselves in virtual worlds in an interactive and engaging manner. The creativity and imagination behind game design necessitate the interaction of a wide range of skills: coding, graphic design, storytelling, musical composition, and sound design.\n\nHow is it that we can spend hours picking up virtual weeds in Animal Crossing, be fearful of turtle shells in Mario Kart, or experience immense satisfaction when leveling up our Pokemon or beating a boss in Dark Souls? This course addresses these questions by tracing the development of video games from the early pixelated heroes of Mario and Pac-Man to online spaces that involve the global participation of millions of people, such as League of Legends and Call of Duty. Students are required to think critically about the virtual worlds they inhabit and consider how video games implement play, immersion, and engagement and how their unique function as an interactive medium has evolved throughout the latter half of the 20th century to the present day. The interdisciplinary nature of game studies allows students to think and write critically on an array of topics concerning narrative, immersion, gender, music, technology, and game design\n\nJames Heazlewood-Dale\n\nThis course considers music as a radical political tool for social justice. Guided by different genres of music and different social justice issues, we will listen to politically resonant songs in order to explore how music not only actively participates in and shapes our culture, but also offers modes of resistance to regimes of power. From the pro-labor and anti-war politics of folk music, the anti-establishment and anti-normative bents of punk, and the racial and social justice orientations of hip-hop, students will examine how music fights power, encourages activism, and effects social change. This course is designed in such a way that students may participate fully regardless of the level of their prior musical knowledge or experience. All of the music we will be examining involves texts that are linguistic, sonic, and occasionally, in the case of music videos, visual. Our study of these musical texts will be enhanced through various critical and theoretical approaches to the intersections of race, gender, and class. For final research papers, students will be encouraged to develop a research topic about music and social justice issues that are meaningful to them.\n\nEthan King\n\nThe ocean, the open road, and the automobile all entice us to travel.

Indeed, given the amount of money at stake, the sports industry’s many competing interests make it a productive case study for thinking about this ever-shifting balance of power. Beginning with the film Jerry Maguire, this course will track these ongoing power negotiations by looking at a variety of relationships within sports, attempting to understand how different actors—athletes, coaches, owners—try to win, maintain dominance, and get paid. How do organizations respond, for example, when individual players like Tom Brady and Aaron Rogers upset the traditional hierarchies that govern teams? Are some coaching styles—such as those of Steve Kerr or Phil Jackson—better suited than others to balancing the competing personalities and interests of professional sports? To further engage with the topics we discuss, students will be encouraged to write papers that grapple with sports-related questions and issues of power dynamics that are of interest to them.\n\nCollin Cook\n\nThe Times They Are A-Changin …When Bob Dylan wrote this song in the early1960s, it was the time of political and military upheaval in America. Dylan was trying to rally people to come together to bring about needed change in our society: culturally, socially, and politically. The decade marked revolutionary ideas and turmoil, and the most prevalent included individual freedoms, Civil Rights, Women’s Liberation, the Viet Nam controversy, Woodstock, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Gay Liberation, and more. Students played a major role in bringing about change as campus protests occurred across America. To explore their role, we will start by examining primary sources and personal narratives between 1960 and 1974 from the extensive archive at Brandeis. Through a series of writing assignments, this UWS will provide students an opportunity to examine the Sixties phenomena, first through the lens of music, then through a comparative analysis of controversies, and finally through research into movements that accomplished social change.\n\nMarsha Nourse\n\nIt has earned 10 billion dollars, created millions of fans, inspired thousands of books, dozens of TV episodes, and hundreds of baby Yoda toys. Since its premiere in 1977, Star Wars has become one of the most widely recognizable pop culture phenomena, with the franchise having expanded from a film trilogy to numerous television series, novels, comic books, video games, and its own theme park. But how did this massive world come to be?\n\nStar Wars has often been called a “modern fairytale”; like all fairytales, it reflects artistic and political contexts of its time. In this class, we will look at the literary sources – including samurai films, cowboy mythology, space operas, and 1930s serials – and the real-world social contexts that informed George Lucas, the director of Star Wars, and inspired other filmmakers working under the auspices of the Disney Corporation. Students will be encouraged to think critically about how the fictional world of Star Wars has been constructed by different authors, at different times.\n\nThe breadth of the text of Star Wars and the interdisciplinary nature of this course allow everyone to engage in discussion and writing activities – you do not have to be a “hardcore” fan to contribute!\n\nAlexandra Burkot\n\nHave you ever wanted to trade lives with someone else? To experience a different consciousness? In Charlie Kaufman's film Being John Malkovich, office workers discover a tiny, mysterious door that turns out to be a portal into John Malkovich's mind. For 15 minutes, they get to be John Malkovich – and yet, they retain their own identity at the same time. What is it to be someone else? Is it to know what their body feels like? To hear their thoughts? To see through their eyes? Is it more than that? If the office workers are still themselves while 'inside' John Malkovich, do they really know what it is like to be John Malkovich? This course explores the strangeness of being a particular self, and of not being someone else. We will ponder various kinds of other minds, from strangers to enigmatic lovers, philosophical zombies to dogs and bats, and think about what knowledge is possible or desirable or ethical to seek. How are we shaped by and intertwined with others?\n\nDaniel Schwartz\n\nWhy do people migrate? What is the impact of the circumstances and context of such moves? How do immigrants write about moving to new locations – leaving their old home and arriving at a new one? In this seminar we explore patterns of human migration, the political and cultural significance of such movement and the ways in which people narrate their experience. In exploring multiple types and contexts of migration, we consider multilingualism and translation, identity, borders, and cultural encounters and differences – topics that continue to pervade our public discourse. Our sources include literary texts, historical and legal documents, journalistic writing, personal narratives, and film. We discuss these readings and the choices made in them in terms of tone, word choice, audience and more, and use them to formulate our own critical ideas on topics such as home, belonging and navigating cultural differences.\n\nYael Kenan\n\nJerusalem is a city with multiple names, a long and tumultuous history, and myriad admirers. For millennia, it has been conquered, destroyed, and rebuilt. People have killed and died for it, traveled from afar to see it, dreamed about it and written poetry and prose commemorating it. Why has this city captured so many people’s imagination for so long? And what is it like to actually live in a city that has long been a symbol?\n\nIn this course, we ask how Jerusalem became sacred and to whom, trace recurring instances of exile and of longing to return and discuss the city’s symbolic and political importance in the violent national conflict of the past 100 years. Our journey through Jerusalem’s many lives includes an array of texts and artefacts depicting the city across centuries and perspectives: religious texts, poetry, short stories, paintings, film and television.\n\nYael Kenan\n\nThis course explores the role of the television sitcom (or “situational comedy”) as a programming and cultural mainstay in American life. Despite being occasionally derided as mere entertainment, the television sitcom functions as a social and cultural artifact that often indicates the norms and values of its time and place. This course will analyze how sitcoms reflect and influence societal values. By dissecting the humor, characters, and underlying social messages of iconic sitcoms ranging from I Love Lucy to The Office, students will develop a nuanced understanding of how shifting societal values have been reflected in sitcoms, and how this popular entertainment form shapes the construction of social norms and social difference in American culture. We will also consider the transformational role of digital streaming platforms in the development and consumption of contemporary sitcoms.\n\nEthan King"
