        "text": "Summary of Assignment: Review of Primary Media Source\n\nWrite a review of a specific film, book, TV series, podcast, play, or video game that you think contributes something significant to the genre and to the culture at large. Show how the subjectâthe primary sourceâof your review illustrates something compelling or exceptional about a particular idea or theme common to the genre. For example, the CW series Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (2015â2019) is a romantic comedy that eschews and even satirizes traditional romantic comedy tropes such as the âgrand gesture,â doing something out of love for someone. Use specific evidence from your primary source to support a central idea, or thesis. In an essay of about 1,200 to 1,500 words, provide an overall judgment about your subject and support it with evidence from the primary source and from secondary sources if applicable. In addition, explore how your specific source has contributed something significant to its genre. In other words, why is this subject interesting, different, or worthy of analysis? Be sure to demonstrate awareness of your sourceâs cultural and historical context as well. For example, if your review is about a romantic comedy, provide relevant information about the history, conventions, or expectations of that genre. Think about and explain the ways your topic adheres to or breaks from audience expectations.\n\nAnother Lens 1. Create a three-to-five-minute podcast review of a specific film, book, TV series, album, podcast, play, or video game. How does the subject of your review illustrate something interesting or unique about a particular idea or theme common to the genre? Integrate specific evidence from the primary source and secondary sources, if applicable, to support a main idea, or thesis.\n\nTo record your podcast review, use either a simple recording method, such as the voice memo app on your smartphone, or something more sophisticated, such as Garage Band or iMovie. To become more familiar with this genre of reviewing, listen to one or two of the examples linked above. Note how this genre is somewhat different from an academic essay. For example, the speakerâs voice is more conversational and engages the audience auditorily by stressing particular words or syllables. In your review podcast, take advantage of the opportunity to present a more informal tone than you might use in an academic essay. Podcast hosts are often successful because of their personality and ability to connect with their audience. Draft a script for your review podcast that reflects your personality and use of language, rather than formal language. For example, use contractions, first- or second-person pronouns, and appropriate slang.\n\nFinally, to maximize the effect of your podcast, consider incorporating short clips from the subject of your review. Upload your podcast review to SoundCloud and share your review with the class. For more direction on public speaking, consult Scripting for the Public Forum: Writing to Speak.\n\nAnother Lens 2. Instead of a straightforward review of a single primary source, review several sources in the same genre, as Caelia Marshall has done in her essay. Or compare a film to the book on which it is based and evaluate it. Select your sources from films, books, television programs, video games, or any other form of entertainment, focusing your review essay on a single area, such as social context, character development, or screenplay vs. original text. Choose other genre-specific evaluation criteria as well, and address them in your essay, as Marshall does. Use specific evidence from your primary sources and secondary sources, as needed, to support your main idea, or thesis. In other words, why is this source interesting, different, or worthy of analysis?\n\nDrafting: Thesis Statement, Analysis, and Supporting Examples\n\nAfter you have selected a topic and decided on the evaluation criteria, spend some time looking closely at your primary source (the film, TV show, book, etc. you have chosen to review). With these criteria in mind, view/read/listen to your primary source. Take notes on how your selected evaluation criteria apply to your source. When you come across strong and relevant examples, write down vivid, detailed descriptions of the scene and quote applicable dialogue. By looking closely at your primary source and taking notes now, you will have solid and specific examples to illustrate your points later when you draft your review.\n\nAlso, while you are looking closely at your primary source, think about the features that appeal to you. Is there a character that is particularly interesting? Do you see an interesting viewpoint on a theme or idea? Is the writing or the use of language interesting, different, or clever? How does it keep your attention or provide something unexpected? The answers to these questions can lead you to your overall evaluation and thesis.\n\nThesis\n\nUse a graphic organizer like Table 7.4 to plan your draft. Then, you will use the notes you took earlier to help you brainstorm for the main points that support the thesis and provide specific, concrete evidence.\n\nPrimary Source Title of work(s) being reviewed\n\nPlanning the Main Points and Body Paragraphs\n\nYour main points should be your topic sentences, expressed as one sentence at the beginning of each paragraph. Preview these main points by adding because to your thesis statement as illustrated below.\n\nExamples\n\nBecause romantic comedies such as Knocked Up (2007) depict their leads as unquestionably âgoodâ people . . .\n\nBecause Rebecca Bunch is sometimes selfish . . .\n\nBecause Rebecca Bunch is sometimes promiscuous . . .\n\nBecause despite these flaws, men still seek her attention . . .\n\nBecause the audience sees Rebecca as realistic, they root for her . . .\n\nNow complete a graphic organizer like Table 7.5 by adding your main points from your primary source.\n\nPoint 1. Because . . .\n\nExplanation:\n\nExample:\n\nPoint 2. Because . . .\n\nExplanation:\n\nExample:\n\nPoint 3. Because . . .\n\nExplanation:\n\nExample:\n\nPoint 4. Because . . .\n\nExplanation:\n\nExample:\n\nAs you continue to plan your review, consider these questions: Depending upon your audience, how much background or context should you provide about your topic? Are they likely or unlikely to have knowledge about the topic? Do you need to summarize anything about your primary source? Do you need to provide historical or cultural context? Use the notes you took earlier as your draft your essay. Remember, you can change things! It is up to you to decide how to organize your argument and where to present specific evidence.\n\nYour review will contain both summary/observation (objectivity) and evaluation/analysis (subjectivity). Practice determining whether statements are summary or observation as opposed to evaluation or analysis.\n\nSecondary Source Evidence\n\nOnce you form your own opinions, you may want to look for additional sources to support your review. Secondary sources, or sources that contain the opinions and analyses of others, are frequently used in academic writing to help writers support a point or provide background and context. Scholarly, peer-reviewed secondary sources give your review greater credibility because the articles are written by experts in their fields. Use your college libraryâs databases, or ask a librarian whether your college provides access to journals that publish articles on movies, television, and culture. Most colleges have access to JSTOR, a database search engine focused on the humanities. In addition, the MLA International Bibliography is a common database of journals related to culture. Research Process: Accessing and Recording Information and Annotated Bibliography: Gathering, Evaluating, and Documenting Sources provide more information about finding sources.\n\nAnother, less academic, place to look for secondary sources is in Recap. In recent years, recapping has become a popular way to join the conversation about TV shows, with sites such as The AV Club, The Huffington Post, Slate, The Verge, and Vox dedicating staff to summarizing and discussing popular shows. Fans engage with each other and recap writers by commenting on and sharing the articles.\n\nNote, too, that well-known publications, such as The New York Times, review not only movies and TV shows but also products such as those you may have chosen to write your review about. In addition, Consumer Reports is one of the longest-running magazines dedicated to reviewing products of all kinds. Many websites, as well, review video games and consoles.\n\nDrafting the Introduction\n\nThe introduction should interest readers in your topic and make them eager to learn more about it. If you were proposing this idea to a company, what would your âelevator pitchâ be? What might you say to quickly pique audience interest? You might describe the part that convinced you it was good. You might explain why your audience would find the topic relatable.\n\nBe sure readers know by the end of the introduction what specifically you are reviewing. Provide the title and necessary background/context: when it was made, the medium (film, book, podcast), the genre, and how to find it (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu). Include your overall evaluation: Did you like it or not, and why overall?\n\nThen present your thesis at the end of your introduction.\n\nstudent sample textIntroduction example. Many people love romantic comedies, but what happens when real life isnât like the movies? We are conditioned to believe there is one person we are destined to be with. Disney movies, TV shows like The Office, Hallmark Channel Christmas movies, and traditional romantic comedies reinforce the notion that for the believer, true love is right around the corner. But everyone knows the pain of rejection or of pining for a person who doesnât seem to notice them. The CW series Crazy Ex-Girlfriend shows what itâs like when love is more complicated than what we see in the movies. The show follows Rebecca Bunch, a successful but unhappyâand far from virtuous or admirableâNew York lawyer who instantly abandons her life to move to West Covina, California, to pursue Josh Chan, her summer-camp crush from long ago. Rebecca cooks up crazy, desperate schemes to get the attention of the aloof and clueless Josh. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend masterfully taps into our inner crazy ex by making good comedy out of Instagram stalking, relationship sabotage, and infatuation.end student sample text\n\nNow, write your introduction:\n\nGeneral statement: ________\n\nBackground or context: ________\n\nBrief summary: ________\n\nEvaluation: ________\n\nThesis: ________\n\nDrafting the Body\n\nFor the body of the review, provide more background and context wherever you think such information is necessary. Because the purpose of this part of the review is to present the main points that support the thesis, be sure to show how these points explain the criteria on which you have based your evaluation. Back up the main points with specific, concrete evidence from your primary source. At this point, return to your early notes and use the descriptions and quotations you gathered. You will likely have collected more evidence as well. Use a graphic organizer like Table 7.6 to create your draft. Main points 1 and 2 should be your topic sentences.\n\nMain point 1\n\nExplanation:\n\nEvidence:\n\nExamples:\n\nQuotations:\n\nSecondary source evidence (if needed):\n\nMain point 2\n\nExplanation:\n\nEvidence:\n\nExamples:\n\nQuotations:\n\nSecondary source evidence (if needed):\n\nMain point 3\n\nExplanation:\n\nEvidence:\n\nExamples:\n\nQuotations:\n\nSecondary source evidence (if needed):\n\nMain point 4\n\nExplanation:\n\nEvidence:\n\nExamples:\n\nQuotations:\n\nSecondary source evidence (if needed):\n\nMain point 5\n\nExplanation:\n\nEvidence:\n\nExamples:\n\nQuotations:\n\nSecondary source evidence (if needed):\n\nDrafting the Conclusion\n\nFor the conclusion, summarize briefly how the criteria you used led you to your evaluation, rephrase or validate your thesis, and make a recommendation.\n\nstudent sample textConclusion example. Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is a refreshing take on the romantic comedy genre. It elevates comedy by using catchy, original songs to accompany clever dialogue. Though Rebecca is intense and extreme, her situation is relatable, and she comes across as more sympathetic than not, proving that people donât have to be perfect to be deserving of love. The departures from the romantic comedy playbook leave the audience guessing what will happen next, ensuring the show never feels tired or stale. What comes after the grand gesture and big kiss? Thatâs a question this show tries to answer, and sooner than you might expect. If youâre looking for a new binge-worthy show, clear your calendar for the next week and give Crazy Ex-Girlfriend a try.end student sample text\n\nNow, write your conclusion.\n\nBrief summary of criteria and evaluation: ________\n\nRestate or validate thesis: ________\n\nMake a recommendation: ________"
