        "text": "The term “multimodality” incorporates visible gestures as part of language, a goal first put forward by Adam Kendon, and this idea revolutionized the scope of linguistic inquiry. But here I show that the term “multimodality” itself is rife with ambiguity, sometimes referring to different physical channels of transmission (auditory vs. visual), and sometimes referring to the integration of linguistic structures with more imagistic, less conventionalized expressions (see David McNeill's work), regardless of the physical channel. In sign languages, both modes are conveyed in a single, visual channel, revealed here in the signing of actors in a sign language theatre. In spoken languages, contrary to expectations raised by defining “modality” in terms of the physical channel, we see that the channel of transmission is orthogonal to linguistic and gestural modes of expression: Some visual signals are part and parcel of linguistic structure, while some auditory (intonational) signals have characteristics of the gestural mode. In this empirical, qualitative study, I adopt the term “mode” to refer solely to specific characteristics of communicative expression, and not to the physical channel. “Multimodal” refers to the coexistence of linguistic and gestural modes, regardless of the physical channel of transmission—straightforwardly encompassing the two natural language systems, spoken and signed.\n\nAfter more than sixty years of research, it is now widely accepted that sign languages are real languages, sharing key properties with spoken languages. This means that spoken and signed languages together comprise one natural language system in some sense. But that is not the whole story. Here I probe more deeply into the two systems, and focus on the differences between them -- differences that are pervasive, systematic, and predictable. Taking the existence of two identical articulators in sign languages, the two hands, as a case in point, I show how the physical channel of transmission profoundly influences linguistic structure. Further support for the characterization of language proposed here, different systems in the same faculty, comes from the newly emerging sign language of the Al-Sayyid Bedouins. The Whole Human Language can only be fully understood by admitting and elaborating two types of language in one language faculty, and by acknowledging the fundamental role of the body in determining language form.\n\nABSTRACT: Natural sign languages both constrain and expand our understanding of the nature of words. In each modality, words can be used in isolation, have meanings or grammatical functions, and are identifiable by their prosodic form. Such shared properties constrain the universal definition of the word. The differences, such as pervasive simultaneity and iconicity in sign word structure and word formation, compared to linearity and arbitrariness typical of spoken words, expand our conception of what a word can be. Investigation of an emerging sign language reveals just how fundamental the word is to language, and shows how morphological complexity begins as an abstract pattern. Sign languages introduce a tension between constraining and expanding the definitive properties of words, offering a more nuanced understanding of this most basic unit of linguistic structure.\n\nComparing phonology in spoken language and sign language reveals that core properties, such as features, feature categories, the syllable, and constraints on form, exist in both naturally occurring language modalities. But apparent ubiquity can be deceptive. The features themselves are quintessentially different, and key properties, such as linearity and arbitrariness, although universal, occur in inverse proportions to their counterparts, simultaneity and iconicity, in the two modalities. Phonology does not appear full blown in a new sign language, but it does gradually emerge, accruing linguistic structure over time. Sign languages suggest that the phonological component of the language faculty is a product of the ways in which the physical system, cognitive structure, and language use among people interact over time. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Linguistics Volume 3 is January 14, 2017. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.\n\nSign languages are natural languages, they are not consciously invented by anyone, but rather develop spontaneously wherever deaf people have an opportunity to congregate and communicate regularly with each other. This chapter briefly explains how they do so. It examines the structure of the sentence (syntax), and then moves to the structure of the smaller units of language, those that may be compared to the meaningless but identifiable sounds of speech (phonology). The chapter ends the linguistic description with a discussion of the structure of words (morphology). There is something about human cognition that converges on a complex and rich language system with particular formal and even neurological characteristics, even when the evolutionarily dominant channel for its transmission is not available. Sign language study has also strengthened the claim that the acquisition of language by children is a natural and automatic process with a set timetable, pointing to some degree of genetic predisposition."
