They provide up to £29,390 for full-time and part-time PhDs in all subject areas.\n\nEU students starting a course on or after 1 August 2021 must have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme to get student finance. Irish citizens do not need to apply for a visa or to the EU Settlement Scheme.\n\nAdditional costs\n\nThere are some extra costs that you may have to pay, or choose to pay, depending on your programme of study and the decisions you make. The list below has some examples, and any extra costs will vary:\n\nStudent visas (international students).\n\nBooks (you’ll have access to many books through the University library, but you may want to buy your own copies).\n\nOptional conference/field/archive/library trips (Faculties support some travel and conference attendance financially.

Some Faculties grant PGR students access to printing and photocopying as staff. Please check with the Department/School to which you are applying).\n\nProfessional-body membership.\n\nGraduation (gown hire and photography).\n\nRemember, you’ll still need to take into account your living costs. This could include accommodation, travel and food – to name just a few."
