        "text": "For an overview of English Language, the study design, whatâs involved in the exam and more, take a look at our Ultimate Guide to English Language.\n\nWhat Is a Short Answer Question?Â\n\nThe English Language exam is split into three sections - Short Answer Questions, Analytical Commentary and an Essay (see here for an explanation of whatâs involved in the Essay component). The Short Answer Questions (SAQs) are at the very start of the exam and include 15 marks in total, usually consisting of 3-5 questions that are in response to a text. SAQs are designed to test your knowledge of metalanguage and your ability to elaborate on the situational and social context of the text in a concise manner.Â\n\nAs SAQs only have 15 marks, you should aim to spend 20-25 mins on this section in the exam. Because there are only about 25 minutes available to allocate to this section, they are also a test of your ability to quickly identify key features in a text.Â\n\nThe good thing about SAQs is that because there are specific mark allocations for each question, thereâs a formula that you can apply to every question to help you obtain all the marks possible - and thatâs what weâll go through in this blog post, so you can ace every SAQ you come across :)Â\n\nCommon Command Words and What They MeanÂ\n\nThe first thing you should do when approaching an SAQ is to recognise (and even better, highlight) the command words in each question in order to help you understand exactly what is required.Â\n\nHere is a list of commonly seen command words and what they entail:\n\nIdentify\n\nâIn response to this command word, you should state the example using metalanguage and line numbers.\n\nDescribeÂ\n\nIf you are asked to âdescribeâ, you should state the example with metalanguage and also give some details about it, such as how it links to the context of the text and/or its functions and social purposes.Â\n\nAnalyse, comment on, explain, discussÂ\n\nâNow we get to the heavier words that require a lot more elaboration and analysis. For these types of words, you should state the example with metalanguage, describe the immediate impact it creates and then link it to the broader context of the text (whether that be situational or social). So, you can think of these questions as a combination of âidentifyâ and âdescribeâ questions, with a bit of further elaboration attached to them.Â\n\nMark Allocations\n\nSAQs usually range from 1-6 marks each and the way you should answer the question depends on how many marks are available.Â\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, do as the question says.Â\n\nFor example, if we look at this question:\n\nâGive one function of this text. Using appropriate metalanguage, identify two different language features that support this function.â (3 marks)Â\n\nThe key phrase here that would distinguish a 2/3 from a 3/3 response is âthat support this functionâ. Rather than simply stating two different language features, you should explain how they support the function of the text. It doesnât have to be long, but at least 1 sentence of elaboration would be required to get full marks.\n\nSo, the overall mark allocation for this question is:Â\n\n1/3: Stating the functionÂ\n\n2/3: Identifying two language featuresÂ\n\n3/3: Linking the language features to the function\n\nA question with a higher mark allocation might be:\n\nâUsing appropriate metalanguage, analyse at least three stylistic and discourse features that contribute to the cohesion of this text. Refer to line numbers in your response.â (5 marks)\n\nThis question has 5 marks, but only one command term (analyse). As such, in response to this question you would have to elaborate on each example - in this case, stylistic and discourse features - and link to how they contribute to the cohesion of the text.Â\n\nEach example should be followed by at least 1 sentence that explains how it contributes to the textâs cohesion. You could also link the examples to their social purpose/function if this is relevant.Â\n\nAs a general rule, any sort of âanalyseâ or âdiscussâ question can follow this template:Â\n\n1) Identify the example using appropriate metalanguage\n\n2) Describe the immediate effect of that example (e.g. if it creates a humorous effect, if it makes the text hard to understand)\n\n3) Provide further elaboration such as linking to social purpose/function/identity\n\nIf you think back to what we covered in the earlier section of this blog, youâll see that this template follows the rule that higher-order command words (like âanalyseâ and âdiscussâ) are a combination of âidentifyâ and âdescribeâ questions, with a bit of further elaboration also required.\n\nGeneral Tips\n\nFinally, here are some general tips to keep in mind when answering SAQs:\n\nUse precise, specific metalanguage (e.g. âfirst-person subject pronounâ instead of just âpronounâ)\n\nAlways link to the broader context for questions with more than 1 mark (whether that be situational or cultural)\n\nHighlight keywords and/or line numbers to help you avoid silly mistakes\n\nAlways include line numbers when quoting examplesÂ\n\nIf youâre unsure as to how much you are expected to write, the amount of space given to you in the answer section is usually a good indicator.Â\n\nFor more about how you can boost your marks in English Language, see this blog post about how to extend your skills further.\n\nAhhh school holidays. The perfect two weeks to catch up on homework and forget about the stresses of school. Now, this scenario isnât what the majority of our school holidays actually look like. For some, school holidays present a challenge whereby we donât have direct access to our teachers to ask for help and we ultimately find ourselves in a bit of a âmotivation downslideâ.Â\n\nPersonally, the school holidays were a great time for me to go through all the concepts that I found tricky during the term. Yet, I always found myself running into a bit of trouble with what I like to call âthe procrastination jungleâ, especially with English. So, here are a few tips that can help you find some sparks of motivation for when you feel like there is simply no road ahead.Â\n\n1: Write Down/Outline/Revisit Your Goals\n\nOften the best way to figure out how youâre travelling through the year is to pause, breathe and reflect back (cue Disneyâs Mulan, Reflection) on what was a busy and hectic term.Â\n\nI always found it useful to revisit some of my previous goals that I had set for myself and tick them off if I had accomplished them. For instance, a goal that I had for the start of Term 2 was to ask my teachers more questions about concepts that I was still unsure of. When it came to the Term 2 holidays, I revisited this goal and was able to tick it off which gave me an incredible sense of achievement and reassured me that I was on track to finish the year off with a score that I was going to be super proud of in the end.Â\n\nYou might be asking, âwhat if I havenât written down any goals throughout the year?â Not to worry! It is never too late to start contemplating what your objectives are for the year. In fact, use this time now during the start of your holidays as a stepping stone to building up a habit of doing just this. This will help you tremendously in defining your journey towards accomplishing your aspirations and offer you perspective on any improvement areas you may need to address in your subjects.Â\n\nBut, how exactly are you supposed to make goals? Some may say that this process is somewhat âtediousâ, but Iâm here to help take the guesswork out of making, revisiting and addressing your goals using the âSMARTâ technique:\n\nBe specific (S) and measurable (M) with your goal â Maybe your aim is to get a 90+ ATAR by the end of Year 12 or maybe your goal is to improve your grade average from 80% to 85%. No matter what your goal is, be sure to make note of what needs to be accomplished and what steps need to be taken to achieve it. Letâs have a look at an example:\n\nâMy goal before the end of Term 3 is to have written one English Essay for all of my novels every week and have it marked by my teacherâ.\n\nNotice how to the point this is? Iâve mentioned exactly what it is that I want to see completed, by when and the frequency - âone essay per weekâ.\n\nIs your goal going to be achievable (A) and is it going to be relevant (R)? â While goal setting might encourage you to be ambitious, sometimes we need to take a step back and think to ourselves, is this goal realistic and is it relevant to what you personally want to achieve at the end of an academic year? Letâs have a look at another example:Â\n\nâMy goal before the end of term is to read all four of my novels three times a week, write 10 essays for each novel every week and complete a three-hour practice exam every second day of every weekâÂ\n\nNow I know what youâre thinking, anything is possible if you put your mind to it, but writing 10 essays for each novel and completing a three-hour practice exam every week?! Not only is this goal simply not realistic, but what relevance is this goal going to have when youâll inevitably feel burnt out and tired from writing all those essays!Â\n\nAnd last but not least, when will your goal be completed? This point stresses the importance of ensuring that your goal is realistic and attainable so that you can achieve it within a given time frame (T). Weâve been specifying in our examples that we would like to complete our goals by the end of the term but feel free to critically consider how long your goal may take in reality. Is the goal of wanting to improve your Language Analysis skills really going to be achieved within a matter of days?Â\n\n2: Look for Gaps in Your UnderstandingÂ\n\nPinpointing what you still need to go through and what youâve already mastered is guaranteed to save you time and effort studying when it comes to SACs and eventually the exam. By doing this, youâll feel a sense of control and direction when you begin another term, without experiencing the often icky feeling of being lost and unsure.\n\nThe way that I went about this was to:\n\n1) Source the study design for each of your subjects (you can do this by going to the VCAA website) and either print them or have them saved onto your desktop.\n\n2) Read through the study design and start to familiarise yourself with the dot points and what you have already covered in class.Â\n\n3) Go through the study design and, using highlighters or coloured pens, come up with a colour coordinating system. I personally opted for:\n\nRed = areas that youâre still unsure about and need further improvement\n\nGreen = areas of masteryÂ\n\nOrange = areas of the study design where youâre in the middle and could do with some polishing up\n\n4) Link your existing notes to the study design dot points and if you havenât already covered a particular dot point in your notes, take the time to study and add these in.Â\n\n3: Pomodoro TechniqueÂ\n\nIf you didnât believe in magic before then you definitely will with the Pomodoro Technique. I used this method religiously back in Year 12 and still do at University. It involves breaking up your study into bite-size chunks whereby you complete intervals of 50 minutes of study followed by a 10-minute break. After every 3-4 cycles, add in a 20-minute break.Â\n\nLetâs have a look at an example of my typical morning back in Year 12:Â\n\n9:00am - 9:50am: Select an essay prompt for Rear Window from the 2019 VCAA English Exam to dissect and write a detailed essay planÂ\n\n9:50am - 10:00am: Breaktime! Quick trip to the fridge for snacks.Â\n\n10:00am - 10:50am: Write out a full essay for the prompt (check out this blog for prompt ideas) and email my teacher for feedbackÂ\n\n10:50am - 11:00am: Watch some Youtube and make a cup of teaÂ\n\n11:00am -11:50am: Select an essay prompt for The Crucible and The Dressmaker comparative and write a full essayÂ\n\n11:50am -12:10pm: An extended break! Make some lunch and play with my dogÂ\n\nWhat I love about this is that it enables you to break up the work into manageable pieces so that you focus solely on one task before taking a well-deserved break. This ensures that you donât burn out from constantly studying without scheduling time for relaxation, recovery and recharge.Â\n\nHow you use your break time is completely up to you. Do anything to take your mind off your work for a few minutes before diving back into your studies!Â\n\n4: Prioritise Your Mental and Physical HealthÂ\n\nWhile it may feel productive to be studying and revisiting content covered in previous terms, there is no understating the importance of taking the time to practice good habits that improve your mental and physical health.Â\n\nConsider taking your dog for a walk while listening to a few songs along the way, or going to your local swimming pool and doing a few laps! Anything to get your body moving will help to ensure that you break your routine up a little bit and experience something different to the often mundane task of studying and completing work. Maybe also get your friends involved too! You can try organising a volleyball game or whatever activity you are all keen on!Â\n\n5: Donât Compare Your Motivation Levels to OthersÂ Â\n\nEveryone is sitting somewhere different on the motivation scale. Some may be extremely motivated to reread their texts, write up essay plans, write timed essays, etc. and others may find it difficult to achieve consistent motivation all the time, and thatâs okay. To feel motivated all the time is failing to step back and reflect on how far youâve come as a person in your personal journey.Â\n\nOften it is when we compare ourselves to others and say âbut look at how motivated they areâ or âtheyâve already done so many practice exams and are going to get a really good study scoreâ that we fall into this trap of finding âflawsâ within ourselves. Comparing your diligence and beliefs in terms of your studies to others is only ever going to do you harm. Focus on your own journey and know that it is absolutely necessary to not expect to be motivated to study all the time. Itâs simply not realistic.Â\n\n6: Remind Yourself That This Wonât Go on ForeverÂ\n\nThe powerful verse âthis too shall passâ is something I had to always remind myself of back when I was in Year 12. Months and months of SACs, practice exams and feeling burnt out felt like an eternity and it started to impact my own sense of willingness to continue my personal academic journey. If it gives you any reassurance, however, know that one day youâll look back on this chapter of your life with nothing but memories and perhaps even have a laugh or two at how young you were in your school photos!\n\nPlans are one of the most ignored (and underestimated) steps in the essay writing process. Some people donât do them simply because they donât want to, some sacrifice them because they think theyâll run out of time, and some do âplansâ, but in reality, theyâre only a rough mental outline. Each of these situations place too many students time and time again in sticky situations come an English SAC or exam.\n\nWhy plans are essential for any good essay\n\nThey ensure that you canât mind blank â itâs all on the paper in front of you!\n\nThey ensure that you always stay on topic.\n\nMental plans or not having a plan at all mean that you donât have a true direction in which your essay is going. If youâre not sure where youâre going, well, how are you going to get anywhere?\n\nThey save you time in writing time. Â\n\nInstead of wasting reading time, youâve done most of your thinking right at the beginning of the SAC or exam, positioning you to do really well in your essay because you can focus on constructing some really juicy, coherent analysis in your body paragraphs, rather than remembering your basic points and/or making sure your essay is actually answering the question.\n\nLetâs have a look at an essay topic that Iâve tackled in the past. This one is based on Kate Grenvilleâs The Lieutenant, a current VCE Year 12 English text. To learn more about themes, quotes, characters about this text, and to have a look at an essay topic breakdown, check out this blog post written by outstanding LSG tutor, Angelina!\n\nâBut a man could not travel along two different paths.â How does Grenville explore Rookeâs conflict of conscience in The Lieutenant?\n\nStep 1: Highlight key words\n\nNow, it may seem like I've just highlighted the whole prompt, and I understand why you might think that! However, each of the words highlighted convey something meaningful within the prompt. If you're ever unsure about what could be considered a key word, consider whether the prompt would have the same meaning without the word in question.\n\nStep 2: Define key words\n\nIn this topic, the main phrase that needs defining is âconflict of conscienceâ. For me, this signals that we must consider morality and the weighing up of right and wrong, especially when tough decisions have to be made.\n\nIâd also take a moment to analyse the quote. This essay prompt is quote-based, so itâs imperative that we discuss the quote and consider the meaning of the quote throughout our essay. For some more detailed info on how to tackle different types of essay prompts, check out this blog post.\n\nStep 3: Start essay plan\n\nNext, Iâd start tackling the plan itself. Although it seems like the above steps would take a while, my real-life planning process only takes about 5 minutes. You certainly donât have to write everything down and you certainly donât have to make it make sense to anyone but yourself.\n\nPersonally, I like to format my plans in dot-point form. I write 1, 2, 3 for each of my body paragraphs and I leave a space underneath each so I can plan each paragraph.\n\nFirst, Iâll just write rough topic sentences under each, so I can really step back and consider whether my plan of action for the essayâs body paragraphs will do a good job at answering the prompt itself. Again, these are only rough topic sentences â fancying them up will come during the essay writing phase.\n\nStep 4: Important things to include in each paragraph\n\nOnce Iâve decided on what each of my body paragraphs will be about, I can them go into a bit more depth for each of them individually.\n\nThese are the elements that I include for each:\n\nIdeas\n\nEssentially, the points that Iâll argue and the reasoning behind the paragraph\n\nQuotes\n\nThe evidence that Iâll be using to reinforce my point(s).\n\nLiterary devices/metalanguage\n\nIn Year 12, I made a conscious effort to include one literary device or metalanguage example per body paragraph in all of my English essays. This really set me apart from the rest of the state because, in reality, not enough students really focused on the language of their texts, which can really impress examiners.\n\nStrategy: Colour-coded plans\n\nFor me, using different colours in my plans helped me organise my thoughts, distinguish between them, and ensure that I had covered everything that I wanted to cover.\n\nObviously, you can come up with a colour system that works for you, but this is what I came up with:\n\nGreen = metalanguage\n\nRed = quotes\n\nBlack/blue = everything else!\n\nAnd thatâs it â my four-step but five minute essay planning process. Donât be afraid to modify this to make it work for you and your needs. However, definitely DO be afraid of not planning â itâs absolutely essential for any good essay.\n\nHappy planning!\n\nâ\n\n[Video Transcription]\n\nHey guys. I've been doing a load of essay topic breakdowns for you guys, and we've been looking at plans for them, so I thought I would actually show you how I actually do a real life plan, one that I would do on paper if I was preparing for a SAC or an exam, as opposed to the ones that I do on YouTube because the ones that I do on YouTube are slightly different. I definitely go into more detail than I normally would. But at the same time I still do use the same concepts as I would when I do read the steps on YouTube. So I'm going to go and show you that today. And before I actually do that, I just want to preface this and tell you guys why doing a plan is so important.\n\nSo I know that a plan is something that one, a lot of people just don't do, or two, they tend to sacrifice it if they feel like they don't have enough time, or three, they do a plan in their head, but they don't actually write it down on paper. Now, all of these things are pretty detrimental for you, especially because when you write a plan, it actually helps to secure you and ensure that one, you're not going to mind blank throughout your essay or let me rephrase that, if you do mind blank throughout your essay, you will still have a piece of paper in front of you telling you, \"This is what you were thinking Lisa, just go and follow this method or what you've written down here.\" So that way you don't just get stuck in the middle of your essay and start having a freak out because you've forgotten what you were supposed to write.\n\nSecond thing is that it ensures that you don't go off topic. This is something that happens quite frequently. If you don't have a plan, then you have this idea of, \"Oh, I'll write this and this\", and then somehow halfway through an essay, halfway through a paragraph, you realize, \"Holy crap, I have completely veered off the topic or this has gone completely in the other direction from what I intended. This is not what I wanted.\" So in order to prevent that from happening, just do a plan, please! You will find that it ends up saving you so much time and it just gives you that reassurance that you need in situations where there are so many unpredictable factors, like what prompts you're actually going to get. And your focus and attention should be more about developing those ideas, rather than having a mind blank in the middle of your essay and then having a little bit of a freakout as a result.\n\nSo I'm going to base this video on a previous essay topic breakdown in the past, and that is on Kate Grenville's The Lieutenant. I was going to say Lieutenant, because I always accidentally say that, but no, it is Lieutenant. Now, if you are not doing as text as always, don't stress about it because what I want you to take away from this video is how you actually do plans, the thinking that goes behind it and the formatting around it. So let's just get started.\n\nThe essay topic that we're doing today is, \"But a man could not travel along two different paths.\" How does Grenville explore Rooke's conflict of conscience in The Lieutenant. So as always, my first step is I will highlight the keywords that I see inside the prompt. Keywords are different for everyone, but these are the ones that I think are most important.\n\nFirstly, the actual quote itself, how Grenville, conflict of conscience. Pretty much in this case I could probably just highlight the entire thing, but for the sake of just defining some keywords, this is what I would do. So the next step is to define key words. I think the only big key word that I need to define here is conflict of conscience. And so to me, the conflict of conscience suggests internal conflict, which implies that we'll need to consider morality and the concepts of right and wrong, especially when a difficult decision must be made and sides need to be taken. So as you can see, I've written these words down next to the keyword and that will just help me ensure that I stay on topic or I stay in tune with what the keyword is about and I don't suddenly change my mind halfway through the essay.\n\nThen what I'll do is, I will analyze the quote itself. So this is unique because this particular essay prompt has a quote inside it, but I'll have to think about, okay, where did I see this quote? Who might've said it and what might it mean? And I'll draw it down a few notes for that. Then I'll pretty much just go straight into my plan. Now, my plans I've written within five minutes, most of the thinking is actually done during reading time. So personally, I've always found that just writing dot points is completely fine. I don't need to go more beyond that. And I'll show you a few examples now of real life year essay plans that I did during that time. And as you can see, they are pretty much just scribbles and if anybody else was to look at my essay plans, they would have no idea what I'm talking about. But you know what, for me it makes complete sense and that's all that matters. You're not graded on your plan, so just go ahead and do it your way. You do you.\n\nSo what I'll do is I'll quickly dot down one, two, three, and these represent my body paragraphs. Then I'll just write down very quickly what the topic sentences will be. I don't actually write the full topic sentence itself, but I guess the essence of it, so the key things that I will mention in the topic sentence. By writing down the three topic sentences, this allows me to take a step back and look at the essay holistically and ensure that I am answering it the way that I want to. Then what I'll do is I'll move into each individual body paragraph and write down some things that I think are important for me to remember when I go ahead and write it. So I might write down a couple of ideas that I think are important. I will write down quotes that I think are essential to my discussion. And then what I'll do is I will throw in at least one literary device or a metalanguage that I think is important to discuss.\n\nSo in this case, in this first body paragraph, it's limited omniscient third person perspective. By throwing this in, I will ensure that I can show my examiner or show my teacher that I can go on that deeper level. I'll repeat this method with both paragraph two and three. Of course for you, you might need to write down more dot points. You can write fewer dot points, it's really just dependent on every individual. If you are somebody who needs to write down the quotes more, then go ahead and do that. But for me, a lot of the quotes will stick in my head. I just need one point just to bounce off, and then from there, I'm able to pull in all of the other quotes that are necessary.\n\nYou also notice that I do things in different colors. Now, I think this is a strategy that I implemented in order to make things a lot clearer for myself before jumping into an essay. So for example, for anything that's a metalanguage based, I'll write it in green. The whole purpose for that is to ensure that in every single body paragraph, I do cover some form of a literary device because that was always really important for me. I thought that it was one of the key things that helped me differentiate myself from other students. So if I took a step back from the plan and I looked at it overall, I could see, okay, there's a green color in every single body paragraph, done. I have ticked off that criteria.\n\nI also used to write quotes in red as well. So red just helped me do the same thing. It helps me take a step back and go, \"Yep, there's a bit of red in every single body paragraph. I'm definitely including quotes,\" which might sound pretty stupid, but it's just that little bit of reassurance that I think really makes that difference when it comes to a stressful situation.\n\nThat's pretty much it. It's just five minutes of your time, so we probably don't need to go into it in too much more detail than that. But as you can see from my essay plans, I'm quite minimal. I just keep things as short as possible because that's all I really need because a lot of the information is here, but I just need to reinforce it and ensure that it is concrete when it is on paper.\n\nSo for yourself, I would recommend that you start practicing your plans. You can try my method and see if that works for you, but over time, I'm sure that you'll come to find your own way of writing plans that work for you.\n\nNext week I'm going to have another essay topic breakdown for you. Can you guess what it might be? If you want to take a stab, put it in the comment section below, but that's it for me in this week guys. I hope that was helpful for you, and don't forget plans are crucial to an amazing essay.\n\nIf you needed any extra help, then my mailing list is always available for you guys. I send out emails every single week just giving you new advice and tips for your studies, so I'll put that in the description box below for you to sign up. Other than that, I will talk to you guys next week.

What Are Quotes?\n\nQuotations, better known by their abbreviation âquotesâ, are a form of evidence used in VCE essays. Using quotations in essays helps to demonstrate your knowledge of the text, and provides solid evidence for your arguments. The discussion on quotations in this study guide can be applied to all three areas of study in the VCAA English course which have been explained in detail in our Ultimate Guides to VCE Text Response, Comparative andÂ Language Analysis.\n\nA quotation is the repetition of a group of words taken from a text by someone other than the original author. The punctuation mark used to indicate a repetition of another authorâs work is presented through quotation marks. These quotation marks are illustrated by inverted commas, either single inverted commas (â â) or double inverted commas (â â). There is no general rule in Australia regarding which type of inverted comma you must use for quotations. Single inverted commas are preferred in Australia as they follow the British standard. The American standard involves styling quotations with the double inverted comma. You can choose either style, just be consistent in your essays.\n\n2. Why Use Quotes?\n\nThe usage of quotations in essays demonstrates:\n\nYour knowledge of the text\n\nCredibility of your argument\n\nAn interesting and thoughtful essay\n\nThe strength of your writing skills.\n\nHowever, quotations must be used correctly, otherwise you risk (and these frequent mistakes will be discussed in detail later):\n\nIrrelevant quotations\n\nOvercrowding or overloading of quotations\n\nPlagiarism\n\nBroken sentences\n\nHow You Integrate a Quote into an Essay Depends on Three Factors:\n\nWhat you want to quote\n\nHow much you want to quote\n\nHow that quote will fit into your essay.\n\n3. What You Want To Quote\n\nAs you discuss ideas in a paragraph, quotes should be added to develop these ideas further. A quote should add insight into your argument; therefore, it is imperative that the quote you choose relates intrinsically to your discussion. This is dependent on which aspect of the text you are discussing, for example:\n\nDescription of theme or character\n\nDescription of event or setting\n\nDescription of a symbol or other literary technique\n\nNever quote just for the sake of quoting. Quotations canÂ be irrelevantÂ if a student merely adds in quotes as âsentence fillersâ. Throwing in quotations just to make your essay appear more sophisticated will only be more damaging if the quotation does not adequately reinforce or expand on your contention. Conversely, an essay with no quotations will not achieve many marks either.\n\n4. How Much You Want To Quote\n\nA quotation should never tell the story for you. Quotations are a âsupportâ system, much like a back up for your ideas and arguments. Thus, you must be selective in how much you want to quote. Generally speaking, the absolute minimum is three quotes per paragraph but you should notÂ overloadÂ your paragraphs either. OvercrowdingÂ your essay with too many quotations will lead to failure to develop your ideas, as well as your work appearing too convoluted for your assessor. Remember that the essay isÂ yourÂ piece of work and should consist mainly of your own ideas and thoughts.\n\nSingle Word Quotations\n\nThe word âevaporatesâ, used to characterise money and happiness intends to instill the idea that happiness as a result of money is only temporary. (VCAA âCan Money Buy Happinessâ Language Analysis)\n\nSingle worded quotations can often leave the largest impression on the assessor. This is because you are able to demonstrate that you can focus on one word and develop an entire idea around it.\n\nPhrase Quotations\n\nSunil Badami âstill found it hard to tie my Indian appearance to my Australian feeling', showing that for Sunil, his culture was not Indian, but Australian due to his upbringing. (Sticks and Stones and Such-like, Sunil Badami in Growing Up Asian in Australia)\n\nA phrase quotation is the most common quotation length you will use in essays.\n\nLong Quotations\n\nThe multitudes of deaths surrounding Anna began to take its toll on her, burdening her with guilt as âsometimes, if I walked the main street of the village in the evening, I felt the press of their ghosts. I realised then that I had begun to step small and carry myself all hunched, keeping my arms at my sides and my elbows tucked, as if to leave room for them.â (Year of Wonders, Geraldine Brooks)\n\nLong quotations comprise of more than one sentenceÂ âÂ avoid using them as evidence. Your assessor will not mark you highly if the bulk of your paragraphs consists of long quotations. You should aim to keep your quotations to less than 2 lines on an A4 writing page. If you have a long quotation you wish to use, be selective. Choose only the important phrases or key words, and remove the remaining sentence by replacing it with an ellipsis (â¦).\n\nHere is the same example again, with the student using ellipsis:\n\nThe multitudes of deaths surrounding Anna began to take its toll on her, burdening her with guilt as she felt âthe press of their ghostsâ¦[and] begun to step small and carry myself all hunchedâ¦as if to leave room for them.â (Year of Wonders, Geraldine Brooks)\n\nIn this case, we have deleted: âsometimes, if I walked the main street of the village in the eveningâÂ andÂ âI realised then that I hadâÂ by using an ellipsis â a part of the quotation that is not missed because it does not represent the essence of the studentâs argument. You would have noticed that a square bracket ([ Â ]) was used. This will be discussed in detail underÂ Blending Quotes.\n\n5. How That Quote Will Fit into Your Essay\n\nPlagiarism\n\nYou must never take the original authorâs words and use them in your essayÂ withoutÂ inserting them in quotation marks. Failure to do so leads to âplagiarismâ or cheating. Plagiarism occurs when you take someone elseâs work and pass it off as your own. You must make sure that you use quotation marks whenever you use evidence from your text.\n\nThe following is plagiarism:\n\nEven a single flicker of the eyes could be mistaken for the essential crime that contained all other crimes in itself â thought crime.Â (1984, George Orwell)\n\nUsing quotation marks however, avoids plagiarism:\n\nEven âa single flicker of the eyesâ could be mistaken for âthe essential crime that contained all other crimes in itself â thought crime.âÂ (1984, George Orwell)\n\nThere are serious consequences for plagiarism. VCAA will penalise students for plagiarism. VCAA uses statistical analysis to compare a studentâs work with their General Achievement Test (GAT), and if the cross-referencing indicates that the student is achieving unexpectedly high results with their schoolwork, the studentâs school will be notified and consequential actions will be taken.\n\nPlagiarism should not be confused with:\n\nâParaphrasing: to reword or rephrase the authorâs words\n\nâSummarising: to give a brief statement about the authorâs main points\n\nâQuoting: to directly copy the authorâs words with an indication (via quotation marks) that it is not your original work\n\nBlending Quotations\n\nYou should always aim to interweave quotations into your sentences in order to achieve good flow and enhanced readability of your essay. Below is a good example of blending in quotations:\n\nJohn Proctor deals with his own inner conflict as he is burdened with guilt and shame of his past adulterous actions. Yet during the climatic ending of the play, Proctor honours his principles as he rejects signing a false confession. This situation where Proctor is confronted to âsign [himself] to liesâ is a stark epiphany, for he finally acknowledges that he does have âsome shred of goodness.â (The Crucible, Arthur Miller)\n\nThere are three main methods in how you canÂ blend quotations into an essay:\n\n1. Adding Words\n\nBroken sentencesÂ are a common mistake made when students aim to integrate quotations into their sentences. Below are examples of broken sentences due to poor integration of a quotation:\n\nâSolitary as an oysterâ. Scrooge is illustrated as a person who is isolated in his own sphere. (A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens)\n\nNever write a sentence consisting ofÂ onlyÂ a quotation. This does not add insight into your argument, nor does it achieve good flow or readability.\n\nScrooge, âsolitary as an oysterâ, is illustrated as a person who is isolated in his own sphere.Â (A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens)\n\nThis example is better, however the sentence is still difficult to read. In order to blend quotations into your sentences, try adding in words that will help merge the quotation and your own words together:\n\nDescribed as being as âsolitary as an oysterâ, Scrooge is illustrated as a person who is isolated in his own sphere.Â (A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens)\n\nOR\n\nScrooge is depicted as a person who is âsolitary as an oysterâ, illustrating that he is isolated in his own sphere.Â (A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens)\n\nTip: If you remove the quotation marks, the sentence should still make sense.\n\n2. Square Brackets ([ Â Â ])\n\nThese are used when you need to modify the original writerâs words so that the quotation will blend into your essay. This is usually done to:\n\nChange Tense\n\nAuthors sometimes write in pastÂ (looked), presentÂ (look)Â or future tenseÂ (will look). Depending on how you approach your essay, you may choose to write with one of the three tenses. Since your tense may not always match the authorâs, you will need to alter particular words.\n\nOriginal sentence:Â ââ¦puts his arm around Lewisâ shoulderâ (Cosi, Louis Nowra)\n\nUpon seeing Lewis upset, Roy attempts to cheer him up by âput[ting] his arm around Lewisâ shoulderâ.Â (Cosi, Louis Nowra)\n\nChange Narrative Perspective\n\nThe author may write in a firstÂ (I, we), secondÂ (you)Â or third personÂ (he, she, they)Â narrative. Since you will usually write from an outsiderâs point of view, you will refer to characters in third person. Thus, it is necessary to replace first and second person pronouns with third person pronouns. Alternatively, you can replace first and second person pronouns with the characterâs name.\n\nThe original sentence:Â âOnly now can I recognise the scene for what it was: a confessional, a privilege that I, through selfishness and sensual addiction, failed to acceptâ¦âÂ (Maestro, Peter Goldsworthy)\n\nWhen Keller was finally ready to share his brutal past with Paul, the latter disregarded the maestro, as he was too immersed in his own adolescent interests. However, upon reflection, Paul realises thatÂ âonly now can [he] recognise the scene for what it was: a confessional, a privilege that [he], through selfishness and sensual addiction, failed to acceptâ.Â (Maestro, Peter Goldsworthy)\n\nInsert Missing Words\n\nSometimes, it may be necessary to insert your own words in square brackets so that the quotation will be coherent when incorporated into your sentences.\n\nThe original sentence:Â âHis heels glow.âÂ (Ransom, David Malouf)\n\nAchilles, like Priam, feels a sense of refreshment as highlighted by âhis heels [which] glow.â (Ransom, David Malouf)\n\n3. Grammar\n\nIt is important to maintain proper grammar while weaving in quotations. The question is: does the punctuation go inside or outside the final quotation mark?\n\nThe rule is: If the quoted words end with a full stop (or comma), then the full stop goes inside the quotation marks. If the quoted words do not end with a full stop, then the full stop goes outside the quotation marks.\n\nOriginal sentence: 'Sagittyâs old place plus another hundred acres that went from the head waters of Darkey Creek all the way down to the river.â (The Secret River, Kate Grenville)\n\nPunctuation inside:\n\nDuring the past decade, Thornhill became the wealthiest man in the area, owning âSagittyâs old place plus another hundred acres that went from the head waters of Darkey Creek all the way down to the river.â (The Secret River, Kate Grenville)\n\nPunctuation outside:\n\nDuring the past decade, Thornhill became the wealthiest man in the area, owning âSagittyâs old place plus another hundred acresâ. (The Secret River, Kate Grenville)\n\n6. There Are Also Other Ways of Using Quotation Marks\n\nTitle of Text\n\nWhen including the title of the text in an essay, use single quotation marks.\n\nDirected by Elia Kazan, âOn The Waterfrontâ unveils the widespread corruption among longshoremen working at New Jersey docks.Â (On The Waterfront, Elia Kazan)\n\nAlternatively, you can underline the title of the text instead of using single quotation marks. Many teachers and examiners prefer this option.\n\nQuotation Within a Quotation\n\nWhen you quote the author who is quoting someone else, then you will need to switch between single and double quotation marks. You firstly need to enclose the authorâs words in single quotation marks, and then enclose the words they quote in double quotation marks. If you're following the American standard, you'll need to do this the opposite way - that is, using double quotation marks for the author's words and and then single quotation marks for the quote. We recommend sticking to the preferred Australian style though, which is single and then double.\n\nOriginal sentence:Â ââ¦something bitter and stringy, too difficult to swallow. âItâs just thatÂ â I â um, I hate itâ¦Itâs too â itâs too Indian!ââ (Sticks and Stones and Such-like, Sunil Badami in Growing Up Asian in Australia)\n\nSunilâs unusual name leads him to believe that it is ââ¦something bitter and stringy, too difficult to swallow. âItâs just thatÂ â I â um, I hate itâ¦Itâs too â itâs too Indian!ââ (Sticks and Stones and Such-like, Sunil Badami in Growing Up Asian in Australia)\n\nAs you can see, the student has quoted the authorâs words in single quotation marks. The dialogue used by the author is surrounded by double quotation marks. This demonstrates that the dialogue used in the text still belongs to the author.\n\nUsing Quotations to Express Irony\n\nWhen you wish to express irony, you use quotation marks to illustrate that the implied meaning of the actual word or phrase is different to the normal meaning.\n\nAs a young girl, Elaine is a victim of Mrs Smeath and her so called âfriendsâ. Her fatherâs interest in insects and her motherâs lack of housework presents Elaine as an easy bullying target for other girls her age who are fit to fulfill Torontoâs social norms. (Catâs Eye,Â Margaret Atwood)\n\nIn this case, âfriendsâ is written in inverted commas to indicate that Elaineâs peers are not truly her friends but are in fact, bullies.\n\n7. Questions You Must Ask Yourself When Weaving Quotes into Sentences\n\n1. Â Does the quote blend into my sentence?\n\n2. Â Does my sentence still make sense?\n\n3. Â Is it too convoluted for my readers to understand?\n\n4. Â Did I use the correct grammar?\n\n8. How To Find Good Quotes\n\nTip One: Do not go onto Google and type in 'Good quotes for X text', because this is not going to work. These type of quotes are generally the most famous and the most popular quotes because, yes they are good quotes, but does that necessarily mean that it's going to be a good quote in your essay? Probably not. But why? Well, it's because these quotes are the most likely to be overused by students - absolutely every single person who has studied this text before you, and probably every single person who will study this text after you. You want to be unique and original. So, how are you going to find those 'good quotes'? Recognise which quotes are constantly being used and blacklist them. Quotes are constantly used in study guides are generally the ones that will be overused by students. Once you eliminate these quotes, you can then go on to find potentially more subtle quotes that are just as good as the more popular or famous ones.\n\nTip Two: Re-read the book. There is nothing wrong with you going ahead and finding your own quotes. You don't need to find quotes that already exist online or in study guides. Go and find whatever gels with you and whatever you feel like has a lot of meaning to it. I had a friend back in high school who was studying a book by Charles Dickens. I haven't read the book myself, but there was a character who couldn't pronounce the letter S, or he had a lisp of some sort. What my friend did was he found this one word where, throughout the entire book, the guy with the lisp only ever said the S one time and that was a massive thing. So, he used that. This is something that is really unique and original. So, go ahead and try to find your own quotes.\n\nTip Three: Realise that good quotes do not necessarily have to come from the main character. Yes, the main character does often have good quotes associated with whatever they're saying, but just know that you do have minor characters who can say something really relevant and have a really good point too. Their quote is going to be just as strong in your essay as a main character's quote, which will probably be overused and overdone by so many other students.\n\nTip Four: Develop a new interpretation of a famous or popular quote. Most of the time, the really popular quotes are analysed in very much the same way. But if you can offer a new insight into why it's being said or offer a different interpretation, then this is automatically going to create a really good quote that's going to offer a refreshing point of view.\n\nFor example, if we look at The Great Gatsby, one of the most famous quotes that is constantly being used is, 'He found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass.' What most people will do is they will analyse the part about the 'grotesque thing a rose', because that's the most significant part of the quote that stands out. But what you could do instead, is focus on a section of that quote, for example the 'raw'. Why is the word raw being used? How does the word raw contribute extra meaning to this particular quote? This way you're honing in on a particular section of the quote and really trying to offer something new. This automatically allows you to investigate the quote in a new light.\n\nTip Five: Just remember that the best quotes do not have to be one sentence long. Some of the best quotes tend to be really short phrases or even just one particular word. Teachers actually love it when you can get rid of the excess words that are unnecessary in the sentence, and just hone in on a particular phrase or a particular word to offer an analysis. And also, that way, when you spend so much time analysing and offering insight into such a short phrase or one sentence, it shows how knowledgeable you are about the text and that you don't need to rely on lots and lots of evidence in order to prove your point.\n\nThose are my five quick tips on how to find good quotes from your texts!\n\nNeed more help with quotes?

What Is English Language?\n\nStudy Design Stuff\n\nEnglish Language is 1 of the 4 different English subjects that are offered as part of the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE). In this subject, youâll explore how individuals and groups of various identities use different varieties of English, and how this ties in with reflecting their values and beliefs. English Language will provide you with a substantial understanding of the impact language has on societies, what it communicates about ourselves and the groups that we identify with, and how societies in turn can also influence language.\n\nIf youâre feeling uncertain about what exactly this subject entails, donât worry! Letâs go through whatâs involved in each unit, and what youâre expected to do in each.\n\n2. VCE English Language Study DesignÂ\n\nNote: The study design contains a metalanguage list for Units 1 & 2 and for Units 3 & 4. Theyâre pretty similar, except the Units 3 & 4 list includes several new features, such as the addition of patterning (phonological, syntactic, and semantic), as well as a significant addition to the discourse subsystem (coherence, cohesion, features of spoken discourse, and strategies of spoken discourse).â\n\nUnit 1\n\nArea of Study (AoS1)Â\n\nAoS1 is called âthe nature and function of languageâ. Youâll learn about the functions of different types of texts, the differences between spoken and written texts, how situational and contextual factors can influence texts, and most importantly, youâll learn about metalanguage as per the Units 1 & 2 metalanguage list.Â\n\nArea of Study (AoS2)Â\n\nAoS2 is called âlanguage acquisition.â Here, youâll learn about theories various linguistics and sociologists have proposed regarding how children acquire languages. Furthermore, youâll also cover how second languages are acquired. One of the most important skills youâll pick up in this AoS is how to apply metalanguage in discussions and essays.\n\nUnit 2\n\nAoS1\n\nEnglish Across Timeâ, will provide you with a historical context for how we have achieved the form of English that we use today. Youâll learn about the processes which led to the development of Modern English from Old English, the changes this had on all the subsystems (learn about the syntax subsystem here), and the various attitudes that are held towards linguistic change.\n\nAoS2\n\nâEnglishes in contactâ, you will learn about the processes which have led to the global spread of English, the intersections between culture and language, and the distinctive features of pidgins, creoles and English as a lingua franca.Â\n\nUnit 3Â\n\nAoS1\n\nâInformal languageâ, will give you an understanding of the roles of informal language in the contemporary Australian context. Youâll learn about what makes texts informal, how this differs for spoken and written texts, and what social purposes can be achieved through informal language - such as maintaining or threatening face needs, building intimacy or solidarity, creating an in-group, or supporting linguistic innovation.Â\n\nAoS2\n\nâFormal language,â will provide you with a detailed insight of what makes texts formal, distinguishing features for spoken and written texts, and what social purposes can be achieved through formal language - such as reinforcing authority, establishing expertise, clarifying, obfuscating, or maintaining and challenging positive and negative face needs.Â\n\nIn both of these AoS, youâll be applying the Units 3 & 4 Metalanguage in your short answer responses and analytical commentaries. The additional metalanguage is typically taught in Term 1 of year 12, while you learn the content for Unit 3.\n\nUnit 4\n\nAoS1\n\nâLanguage variation in Australian society,â is a detailed study on how both standard and non-standard Australian English are used within contemporary society. Youâll learn about how identity is constructed through language, how varieties of English vary by culture (such as ethnolects or Australian Aboriginal English), and the attitudes that are held towards different varieties by different groups.Â\n\nAoS2\n\nIn âIndividual and group identitiesâ, youâll look at how language varies by different factors, such as age, gender, occupation, interests, aspirations, or education, and how these factors all contribute to our identities. Youâll learn more about in-groups and out-groups, and how they can be created and maintained through language. Furthermore, youâll learn about the relationship between social attitudes with language, and how language can be shaped by, but also influence, social attitudes and community expectations.Â\n\nFor more information, have a look at the study design.Â\n\n3. What's Involved in the Exam?\n\nThe Year 12 Exam involves 2 hours of writing time and 15 minutes of reading time. It has three sections:\n\nSection A: 15 marks (It is recommended that you spend approximately 20-25 mins in this section)\n\nSection B: 30 marks (It is recommended that you spend approximately 40-45 mins, and write 600-700 words)\n\nSection C: 30 marks (It is recommended that you spend approximately 45-50 mins, and write 700-800 words)\n\nMake sure you have a read through of the assessment criteria for each section.\n\nSection A\n\nSection A is 15 marks of short answer questions. You are given a text, and youâre required to respond to questions about the stylistic and discourse features used in the text, while ensuring that youâre demonstrating a detailed knowledge of metalanguage through carefully selecting relevant examples from the text.Â\n\nA strong understanding of the metalanguage is really important, both in terms of knowing the meanings of each metalinguistic term, and also in knowing which category each term fits under (For example, knowing that inference is part of coherence and not cohesion). Therefore, it is important that you learn your metalanguage in terms of what each terminology means, and also in terms of which category each term fits into.\n\nAs a general guide:\n\n1 mark â one idea or one example or one explanation\n\n2 marks â one idea plus one or two examples with explanations\n\n3 marks â two ideas plus one or two examples of each with explanations\n\n4 marks â two or three ideas plus one or two examples of each with explanations\n\n5 marks â three ideas plus one or two examples of each with explanations\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes students make here is not reading the questions properly. Students sometimes miss how many examples the questions specifies to identify (this information is often given as âidentify 2 examplesâ or âidentify the purposesâ as plural), forget to check how many marks a question is, or mix up certain metalanguage terms, such as confusing sentence types with sentence structures. So, be very careful in answering these questions.\n\nHere are some examples of short answer questions that have come up in past VCAA exams:\n\n[Question 2, 2017 VCAA] - Identify and comment on the use of two different prosodic features. (4 marks).\n\nâHere, you would identify 2 different prosodic features (pitch, stress, volume, intonation, or tempo), and discuss what effect they have on the text, taking contextual factors into consideration. For example, stress could be used to draw emphasis, or intonation could influence the emotion conveyed.Â\n\n[Question 1, 2015 VCAA] - What sentence types are used in lines 15 to 36? How do they reinforce the purposes of this text? (3 marks)\n\nâHere, you would identify the relevant sentence types (declaratives, imperatives, interrogatives, and exclamatives), and explain their role in the text. You would also want to ensure that your explanations are specific to the context of the text.\n\n[Question 9, 2010 VCAA] - Discuss the function of two different non-fluency features between lines 70 and 96. (4 marks)\n\nâHere, you would identify two non fluency features (such as pauses, false starts, repairs, repetition) and give a 1 sentence explanation of its role or what it indicates.\n\n[Question 1, 2012 VCAA] - Identify the register of the text. (1 mark)\n\nâThis question is quite straightforward, and you could use terms such as formal, informal, predominantly formal/informal in your response.\n\n[Question 4, 2012 VCAA] - How does the verb tense in lines 9â34 support the purpose of this section of the text? (2 marks)\n\nâHere you would identify whether the verb tense is in past, present, or future tense, and explain why it has been used in that way based on the contextual factors.\n\n[Question 3, 2017 VCAA] - Using appropriate metalanguage, identify and explain two specific language features that reflect the speakerâs identity.(4 marks)\n\nâHere, you can pick examples from any subsystem that relate to the speakerâs identity, such as jargon, colloquialisms, semantics of certain jokes, expletives, or pejoratives.\n\nNote: The exams prior to 2012 have 2 sets of short answer questions, because analytical commentaries werenât a part of the exam back then. This leaves you with lots of practice questions! However, do keep in mind that the metalanguage lists differed and certain features were categorised in different ways. For example, Question 2 from the VCAA 2013 exam asks you to talk about prosodic features, however, in the examinerâs report, pauses are suggested as an option. We know that in the present study design, pauses are classified as features of spoken discourse, under the discourse subsystem, whereas prosodic features are classified under the subsystem of phonetics and phonology.\n\nCheck out How To Respond to Short Answer Questions in VCE English Language if you need more help tackling Section A of the exam.\n\nSection B\n\nSection B is an analytical commentary (AC) worth 30 marks. The introduction for an AC is an explanation of the contextual factors, the social purpose, and the register, of the text. In the body paragraphs (generally three), youÂ group your examples from the text by themes, and explain their roles.Â\n\nThere are two main approaches for body paragraphs; the sub-system approach, and the holistic approach. In the sub-system approach, you would organise your examples so that each paragraph is addressing a specific subsystem. For example, your AC could be composed of the introduction, and then a paragraph on lexicology, one on syntax, and one on discourse. This approach is easier for when youâre starting out with ACs, but one of the issues with it is that you end up limiting yourself to just one portion of the text for the one paragraph. In the holistic approach, you would typically do a paragraph on social purpose, register, and discourse. In this approach, you are able to group examples from multiple subsystems and talk about how they work together in achieving specific roles in the texts.Â\n\nMake sure youâre attempting a range of different types of texts, such as, opinion pieces, recipes, oaths, editorials, advertisements, eulogies, social media posts, public notices, television transcripts, radio transcripts, letters, speeches, legal contracts, conversations, narratives, and more.\n\nFor more information, have a look at this video:\n\nSection C\n\nSection C is an essay worth 30 marks. There are a range of topics that can potentially come up in the exam, and it is really important that you practice writing a variety of essays.Â\n\nIn essays, it is really important to ensure that you set out a clear contention in your introduction. This will basically tell the assessor what point youâre making in your essay, and itâll also help you remember which direction to take your essay. After your contention, you need to signpost your ideas. This means that you need to summarise what 3 points you are stating in your body paragraphs.Â\n\nHereâs an exercise which is really helpful in refining introductions - When youâre writing your contention, write âIn this essay, I will argue that [Insert contention]. I will do this by stating the following points [Insert signposting].â When youâre happy with your introduction, you can remove the underlined parts. This will help you really understand how the roles for contentions and signposting differ. Youâll also thoroughly understand what position youâre taking in the essay.\n\nThe body paragraphs follow TEEL structure. You begin with your topic sentence, state your evidence, explain it, and then link it back to your contention. You have three options for the type of evidence that youâll use (stimulus material, contemporary examples, and linguist quotes), and it's important to use a combination of them. According to the exam rubric, you have to be using at least 1 piece of stimulus material. Contemporary examples should ideally be from the current year and the previous. Linguist quotes donât have time restrictions but itâs a good idea to try and find recent ones.\n\nOne of the most important things in body paragraphs is to make sure that youâre able to link your example back to your contention. If youâre unable to do this, it means that your examples aren't relevant to the points that youâre trying to make.Â\n\nIn your conclusion, you need to ensure that you donât introduce any new examples or points. The role of the conclusion is to summarise and reinforce your points and your overall contention.Â\n\nIf you would like further clarification, have a look at this post on English Language Essays.\n\n4. How To Study for English Language\n\nTime Management and Organisation\n\nHaving a study timetable will make studying much less stressful than it needs to be. In your timetable, make sure you are allocating enough time for all of your subjects, as well as time for rest, extra-curricular activities, work, and socialising. A realistic time-table will also mean that youâre less likely to waste time trying to decide which subjects to study for. For example, every Sunday, you could spend 15 minutes planning out your week based on which assessments you have, and which subjects you would like to give time to. This becomes especially useful in SWOTVAC, where youâll be responsible for ensuring youâre spending enough time on each subject whilst also balancing everything else outside of school.Â\n\nHere are some extra resources to help you with time management:\n\nSWOTVAC: Planning Your Life\n\n10 Hacks For Time Management\n\nHow to survive VCE - motivation and approach\n\nRevising Metalanguage\n\nConsistently revising metalanguage is one of the most important study methods for English Language.Â\n\nThe basics of metalanguage are covered in Unit 1. Make sure you keep a clear set of notes for this content so that youâre able to look back on it to revise throughout the year. Before the year 12 year begins, you want to make sure that everything in the year 11 metalanguage list makes sense to you. Spending the summer holidays before year 12 begins in reinforcing the basics will help you throughout year 12, as youâll be able to pick up on the new metalanguage much faster. One of the first things you'll cover is coherence and cohesion, so if you would like to get a head start, have a look at this post.\n\nThroughout year 12, consistently revising metalanguage will be your responsibility. It is likely that youâll be spending a greater proportion of class time in learning content, and writing short answer responses, analytical commentaries, or essays. Therefore, itâs really important to figure out a way that works best for you in being able to frequently revise metalanguage. Flashcards are pretty useful for revision, as well as making mind maps so that youâre able to visualise how everything is set out in the study design.\n\nOne issue students run into is that theyâre able to define and give examples for metalanguage terms, however, they are unable to understand how it fits in in terms of the categories under each subsystem. For example, a student is able to remember what a metaphor is, but unable to recall that it fits under semantic patterning. Similarly, a student may know what a pause is, but not know if itâs part of prosodic features or discourse features. Itâs important to know what all the categories are, because the short answer questions usually ask for you to identify features under a particular category. Therefore, spending time on just revising the definitions alone isnât sufficient in learning metalanguage. You also need to be able to ensure that you can recall which category each term fits under.\n\nReading the News\n\nFor the essay, youâre required to use contemporary media examples as evidence (alongside stimulus material and linguist quotes). Itâs really important for you to begin this process early so that youâre able to start using examples in essays as early as possible.Â For tips on how to find, analyse and store your examples, see our post on Building Essay Evidence Banks for English Language.\n\nHaving an awareness of Australiaâs historical, political, and social context, will provide you with a more comprehensive perspective of the contemporary examples. So, if you donât already do this, try to develop a habit of reading the news (The Conversation or The Guardian are a good place to start). Television programs like Q and A, The Drum, and Media Watch, will help you understand the Australian context, and often these programs will also discuss the roles of language, which directly links with what you're looking for as essay examples. Itâs especially important to start early, and to build these skills over time, so that you are able to develop a holistic foundation.Â\n\nExtra Practice Pieces and Seeking Feedback\n\nDoing extra practice pieces is a really effective way to develop and refine your analytical skills. Make sure you receive feedback for all your work from your teacher or tutor, as itâs the only way you'll know if youâre going in the right direction.\n\nIf youâre short on time, even writing up AC or essay plans, or just doing 1 paragraph, is an effective way to revise.\n\nLearning Quotes and Examples\n\nMemorising several pages full of linguist quotes and contemporary examples may seem daunting at first, but once you begin using them in essays, theyâll become much easier to remember. Right from the beginning of yr12, make sure you set up a document to compile your linguist quotes and examples into subheadings. For example subheadings such as âcultural identity,â âjargon,â âhate speech,â âfree speech,â or âAustralian valuesâ will make it easier for you to navigate your notes when you're planning your essays.\n\nIf you start early, youâll be able to remember everything bit by bit as you progress through the year, which is definitely easier than trying to remember the evidence the night before the assessment. Additionally, youâll be ready with quotes and examples as soon as you begin essays in class, so youâll be able to use your examples earlier, hence learn them earlier, and therefore be able to memorise your quotes and examples in advance. If youâre in year 12 and youâre nearing the end of the year and still struggling to memorise your examples and quotes, try using flashcards to remember your evidence.Â Make sure youâre doing a range of essays on different topics so that youâre able to apply and analyse your evidence.Â\n\nLearning From Your Mistakes\n\nIt can be pretty disheartening to make the same mistakes repeatedly and continue to lose marks. So, compiling the mistakes that you make throughout the year in a separate notebook or document is a fantastic way to keep track of the key things you need to remember. Youâll also be less likely to repeat those mistakes.\n\nGroup Studies\n\nStudying in groups for English Language is a highly effective way to refine your understanding of the content, and see different perspectives in the way certain ideas can be applied. Revising metalanguage and testing your friends on their knowledge can be a light and engaging way to ensure you and your friends are on the right track. Sharing the ways you and your group have approached a specific AC is also an effective way to learn about different approaches. Discussing essay topics is a useful way in refining your arguments, as youâll be exposed to different opinions and be able to work on ensuring that your arguments are relevant and strong.\n\nSee How To Extend Yourself in VCE English Language for more tips!\n\n5.

Sample Essay\n\nTopic\n\nLanguage is fundamental to identity and consequently we draw on our linguistic repertoire to project different aspects of our identity according to context. Discuss this statement in the contemporary Australian context with reference to at least two subsystems in your response.\n\n(This essay topic relates to Unit 4 - AoS1, âLanguage variation in Australian society.â)Â\n\nIntroduction\n\nLanguage plays a pivotal role in establishing and communicating various facets of identity. As such, individuals can alter their linguistic repertoire to establish in-group membership. Teenspeak is an effective mechanism in expressing teenage identity, but can also be used by the older generation to appeal to young people. Code switching between ethnolects and standard Australian English further illustrates how individuals can manipulate their linguistic choices to suit their environment, whilst simultaneously reflecting ethnic identity . Furthermore, jargon plays a critical role in establishing professional identity and signifying expertise or authority. Consequently, linguistic choices are capable of expressing diverse and multifaceted identities.\n\nBody Paragraph\n\nTeenspeak is capable of expressing identity and establishing in group membership amongst teenages, however it can also be used by those in the out-group to appeal to teenagers. Professor Pam Peters asserts that âTeenagers use language as a kind of identity badge that has the effect of excluding adults.\" Consequently, teenagers are able to establish exclusivity and in-group membership. Bakery owner Morgan Hipworth, who largely has a teenage following and is a teenager himself, employs teenspeak in a video recipe, where he responds to the question âCan you make a 10 layer cheese toastie?â with âBet, letâs go.â Through using the teenspeak term âbet,â Hipworth is able to relate and connect with his young audience while further asserting his identity as a teenager. This demonstrates how teenspeak can be effective in both establishing in-group membership, and expressing identity. Similarly, Youtuber Ashley Mesciaâs extensive use of teenspeak initialisms in Instagram captions, such as âootdâ for âoutfit of the day,â âgrwmâ for âget ready with me,â and ânglâ for ânot gonna lie,â allows her to connect with her predominantly teenage following, thus allowing her to establish solidarity and in-group membership. This further indicates that teenspeak is an effective mechanism in expressing identity and building in-group membership. In contrast, teenspeak can also be used by older people in an effort to appeal to teenages. For example, in 2019, ABCâs Q and A host Tony Jones ended a promotional video for an opportunity for high-school students to appear on the panel with âItâs gonna be lit fam.â This was done in an effort to appeal to younger people by exploiting the notion that it is often seen as cringeworthy when older people use teenspeak. Linguist Kate Burridge asserts that âolder people using contemporary teen slang often sounds insincere and phoney,â and Jones was aware of this, however his purpose was to appeal to this to be able to further promote the video. Therefore, teenspeak is effective in both establishing in-group membership and expressing identity, and also appealing to the in-group and a member of the out-group.Â Â\n\n7. Year 12 Essay Topic Categories\n\n1: Australian English\n\nAustralian English differs from other national varieties â this theme looks at what makes Australian English unique and the factors that have contributed to its development over time.

Consider the following:\n\nAustralian English and its development and evolution over time\n\nTaboo, swearing and dysphemism and the role of changing social values\n\nPolitical correctness, non-discriminatory language and changing social values\n\nLinguistic innovation and informal language\n\nTechnological advances and their impact on language - this includes emojis and text speak\n\nGlobal contact and other social changes and their impact on contemporary Australian English\n\nMigrant ethnolects and Aboriginal English\n\nUnderstanding the Syntax Subsystem for English Language\n\nOne of the most common areas of difficulty and confusion in English Language is the syntax subsystem, so you are not alone if you find this difficult. You will already have an intuitive understanding of how syntax in English works (you speak the language after all), but being able to effectively analyse and parse sentences and utterances can be tricky. It is important that you understand what the following word classes (aka parts of speech) are, and what their role is in a sentence, you may need to revise them from Unit 1/2.\n\nNoun\n\nVerb\n\nAdjective\n\nAdverb\n\nPronoun\n\nPreposition\n\nConjunction\n\nDeterminer\n\nInterjection\n\nThere are innumerable online and physical resources, such as Sara Thorneâs fantastic Mastering Advanced English Language, which you can look at to revise these word classes. These are the fundamental building blocks that we have at our disposal when building up a sentence and are vital for understanding syntax. Syntax is how we arrange these building blocks into phrases, which we combine to form clauses, which in turn create sentences.\n\nWhat Is a Phrase?\n\nPhrases are words or groups of words that function together in a clause. Often we class phrases in terms of what role they are playing: we might have a noun phrase, a verb phrase, or an adverbial phrase, for example. Look at the example below to get a feel for what is meant by a phrase.\n\nAuthorised Officers are here to help keep your public transport running smoothly and make sure everyone is paying their way.\n\nThe main phrases are:\n\n'Authorised Officers', 'your public transport', 'everyone', 'their way' (noun phrases)\n\n'are', 'to help keepâ¦running', 'make sure', 'is paying' (verb phrases)\n\n'hereâ, 'smoothly' (adverbial phrases)\n\nâandâ (coordination conjunction)\n\nWhat Is a Clause?\n\nClauses can be entire sentences or be one of several parts of a sentence. At a minimum, standard clauses must contain a subject and a verb, but usually have other components too. To help us understand what makes up a clause, it is important to re-familiarise yourself with the five clause elements:\n\nSubject\n\nVerb\n\nObject\n\nComplement\n\nAdverbial\n\nClauses must contain a verb, or else we class them as fragments. The following is a clause:\n\nThey watched the sunset together.\n\nBut this is a fragment:\n\nWhat a sunset!\n\nNote that the clause above contains a subject (They), verb (watched), object (the sunset) and adverbial (together), whereas it is not entirely clear how to classify the elements of the fragment, because there is no verb telling us how the words relate to each other.\n\nThere are two types of clauses we need to be concerned about: independent (main) clauses and dependent (subordinate) clauses. An independent clause can stand by itself as a simple sentence, whereas a dependent clause sits inside another clause and usually adds extra or supporting information.\n\nSentence Structures\n\nNow for one of the key skills that is assessed in short answer questions and analytical commentaries: understanding how we combine clauses to create different structures.\n\nSimple Sentences & Utterances\n\nThe first sentence structure is the simple sentence, which contains only one clause. Often these are seen as âshortâ sentences, but this is not always the case. For instance below is an example of a simple sentence:\n\nAll the school children, their families and their teachers were at the carnival for a day of fun and competition.\n\nCompound Sentences & Utterances\n\nCompound sentences consist of at least two independent clauses (ones that have a subject, a verb and form a complete idea on their own), joined by a comma, semicolon or a coordinating conjunction. Take for example the following compound sentence comprised of three clauses:\n\nShe swam and she surfed, but her thoughts inevitably returned to the dangers of the sea.\n\nComplex Sentences & Utterances\n\nComplex sentences, on the other hand, contain one independent or âmainâ clause, as well as one or several subordinate clauses. To identify a subordinate clause, you need to think about whether the clause you have identified stands as a complete thought, or whether it relies on the rest of the sentence to make sense. An example is included below, where only the main clause is bolded.\n\nNow, if you turn to your right, youâll see the gallery, which was constructed in 1968.\n\nCompound-Complex Sentences & Utterances\n\nCompound-complex sentences, exactly as one would expect, are a combination of several independent and subordinate clauses, to form what is most often quite a long sentence. If you know how to identify compound and complex sentences, this one should not pose much difficulty. Here is an example, where only the dependent clause is bolded.\n\nNow it wouldnât matter how fast he ran, he would never make it there in time, nor would he have anyone to blame but himself.\n\nGive me a ring if youâre coming, or tell Max on his way home from work.\n\nSentence Fragments (Minor Sentences)\n\nIt may occur to you that not every sentence or bit of language that you ever come across fits neatly into one of the above categories, especially if there is not any identifiable independent clause. These we class as sentence fragments, and they are often found in informal spontaneous discourses.\n\nToo easy mate, good on ya, etc.\n\nLike any skill in English Language, getting good at syntax takes practice. To build your confidence, try parsing any of the texts you come across in school, or even texts you see in a magazine or newspaper. Check with a teacher, friend or tutor to see if you got it right, and where you might still need a little bit of work. And, come back to this blog post anytime you need a refresher!\n\nBe sure to read our Ultimate Guide to English Language for an overview of the study design, whatâs involved in the exam, how to study for the subject and more!\n\nLanguage has many uses which go beyond simple communication. Language can be used to entertain, to convey abstract ideas and to mold oneâs perspective. A strong understanding of linguistic features, of words and their connotations can allow one to manipulate their language in order to convey certain ideas and thoughts. This brings us to the topic of face needs. Oneâs face need is the sense of social value that is experienced during social interactions. There are two types of face needs; positive face needs and negative face needs. Positive face refers to the need to feel accepted and liked by others while negative face describes the will to do what one wants to do with freedom and independence.\n\nIn daily conversations and in media, language is used to either appeal to face needs or to avoid meeting face needs. Basic politeness markers are frequently used to appeal to face needs, often subconsciously. Imagine a teacher asks you to pass them the pencil they just dropped. Most likely, they will ask something along the lines of, âare you able to pass me that pencil please?â The teacherâs relationship with you is that of an authoritative nature. Therefore, when asked to pick up the pen, you will almost certainly oblige unless there is a compelling reason not to. While the teacher has technically posed a request or a question, it is a in fact a command in disguise. The teacher has an expectation that you will pick up the pen, however, by framing this command as a question, it appears as though you are being given a choice. This appeals to your negative face needs as you are not being imposed upon to pick up the pen, but are given a choice should you wish to âpick it upâ. In situations where interlocutors do not have a very close social distance, linguistic features such are politeness markers, rising intonation and interrogative sentences are used to appeal to negative face needs. If this same situation occurred with a friend, they might say something along the lines of âoi, chuck us that pen.â This is a blatant disregard for negative face needs, but due to the close social distance between you and your close friend, appealing to negative face needs for such small things is unnecessary.\n\nAppealing to negative face is most commonly observed in interactions with strangers or with those who do not have a strongly established relationship. However, appeals to negative face needs can also be observed with close individuals, particularly used to further the relationship by extending its boundary. For example, when asking a big favour from a relatively new friend one will most likely use methods to appeal to negative face needs, using phrases such as, âdo you mind if,â âwould it be possible if,â âcould I please ask you a huge favourâ. Such phrases do not impose of the individual, allowing them to âchooseâ whether or not to oblige. Appealing to the negative face demonstrates that one recognizes the otherâs freedom and wish to do as they wish.\n\nAppealing to positive face needs occurs through slightly different linguistic and paralinguistic techniques. Compliments, minimal response, eye contact, politeness markers and the use of interrogatives are all ways in which one can appeal to anotherâs positive face needs. These techniques are very often employed in radio and television interviews. It is the duty of the host to make their guest feel welcome and wanted on the show. Television hosts such as Jimmy Kimmel and Ellen often introduce their celebrity guests by mentioning their achievements, thus making them feel special. They frequently employ interrogatives to display avid interest in their guests. Furthermore, back-channeling and vocal effects such as laughter allow the guests to feel that their presence is welcome and appreciated. Think of this from the perspective host and their social purpose. They want to make their guests feel appreciated to promote their viewership and build solidarity with the guests so they may return on the show.\n\nThis is interview is an example of positive face needs where interviewer Rajeev Masand compliments Stanger Things actors Milly Bobby Brown and Noah Schnapp at the beginning of the interview for their show.\n\nâ\n\nTom Holland on Ellen:\n\nIn this example both Tom Holland and Ellen meet one anotherâs positive face needs. Politically correct language and euphemisms are also another example of appeals to positive face needs. Calling people âdifferently abledâ is done in attempt to avoid discrimination and allow individuals of different abilities to feel equally accepted and welcome. However, this does not always come across as intended. Often politically correct labels are not embraced by the given community as they feel that such labels further alienate them from society. Politically correct labels can act as reminders to such groups that they are considered minority or, they may feel that these labels are a feeble attempt to push aside previous, conflicting history. This is important to note as it demonstrates that appealing to face needs can sometimes be a hit or miss. In everyday conversation, people use cues in attempt to understand the individual they are conversing with and hence alter their language accordingly. They will use these cues to understand how to use language to appeal to the face needs of the other individual. In a context with school friends, there is likely to be less use of politeness markers and politically correct language as the pre-established relationship means there is a mutual understanding the one does not wish to offend. In contrast, the use of language is likely to be very different in transactional conversations, interviews and conversations with an authoritative relationship.\n\nTechniques used to appeal to face needs always come back to the social purpose of the interlocutors and the contextual factors. By understanding the link between these elements, you can form a holistic analysis of face needs. Therefore, when writing about face needs in your exam and sacs, it is vital to be considerate of the context as this impacts how face needs are approached.\n\nHere are some other examples of celebrity interviews where there is evidence of appeals to positive face needs. Watch them carefully and youâll notice the specific linguistic features used in these interviews to build solidarity with the guests and create engagement with the show. The hosts compliment their guests and frequently employ minimal response to allow the conversation to progress smoothly. There are minimal overlaps as the hosts are cautious not to talk over their guests. You will notice that in certain interviews, when the host and guest are known to one another, appeals to face needs are not adhered, allowing them to strengthen their bond and further audience engagement.\n\nMalala Yousafzai on Ellen:\n\nâ\n\nEddie Redmayne interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert:\n\nHave a read of our Ultimate Guide to English Language if you haven't already.\n\n[Video Transcription]\n\nSometimes when using language we may want to, or need to discuss a topic that is uncomfortable to deal with directly. For these cases we often employ the technique of euphemism to make the bad things sound better. As Quentin Crisp put it, \"Euphemisms are unpleasant truths wearing diplomatic cologne\".\n\nSemantic Fields and Situational Contexts\n\nEuphemism is found in a wide range of semantic fields and situational contexts, but a few where they appear often include:\n\nIn the domain of politics and political correctness\n\nIn public-facing language, such as press conferences and interviews\n\nIn discussions around uncomfortable topics such as death, termination of employment, and sex\n\nIn the corporate world\n\nSo this begs the question of why people sometimes choose to employ euphemism, and what social effects it has on relationships and also society as a whole?\n\nThe Purpose of Euphemism\n\nThere are two sides to the euphemism coin, which are important to keep in mind when discussing and observing the use of euphemism. On the one hand, it can allow us to talk about uncomfortable topics more easily and without losing face, but on the other it can mask the truth or even be used to actively confuse others.\n\nMany would argue that the primary purpose of euphemism is to maintain positive face, and it can often be very effective in doing so. Letâs consider the example of an employer navigating the social taboo topic of dismissing one of their employees. No matter how they go about broaching this topic, some of the face needs of the employee will not be met. According to a variety of online human resources sites, some of the euphemisms that employers or hiring managers are encouraged to use, include:\n\n\"Exit strategyâ\n\nâCareer change opportunityâ\n\nâFreeing for availability to the industryâ\n\nâMaking a team moveâ\n\nThese terms are widely favoured over the bluntness of something like âyouâre firedâ. By using such euphemisms, employers seek to put the focus onto the minor upsides of being laid off, rather than directly dealing with what will often feel like a personal attack for the employee. In this way, they try to, although not necessarily effectively, meet the face needs of both their employee and themselves in navigating this socially taboo topic.\n\nThe euphemisms that we use can also reflect and reveal our shifting social mores as the euphemisms that we use change over time. For example, if we consider the words we use surrounding the semantic domain of animal slaughter, we are seeing more and more euphemisms being employed today, as the topic becomes taboo and unpalatable. Instead of âkillingâ animals, today people are describing animals as being âdepopulatedâ or âharvestedâ. We can even see this shift in how we describe the deaths of household pets, who are âput downâ, rather than âeuthanisedâ. Such euphemisms reflect our societyâs shifting values and attitudes, namely that we now value animal life far more than we have in the past. We now wish to avoid the negative connotation surrounding the traditional lexemes of this semantic field, in order to maintain social harmony and positive face.\n\nHowever, euphemism is also often used to hide or conceal the truth, and can mislead both those who hear it, and even those who use it. Clear communication is sometimes sacrificed for the sake of maintaining oneâs positive face. When euphemism is used to obfuscate the truth, it is often classed as âdoublespeakâ, a term stemming from the neologisms âdoublethinkâ and ânewspeakâ in Orwellâs Nineteen Eighty Four. For example, local councils may describe a âpot-holeâ as a âpavement deficiencyâ to save face in being unwilling or unable to repair roads. This term is deliberately ambiguous as to the nature of the specific damage, and has been chosen over the far clearer and more familiar term âpot-holeâ in an effort to obscure the truth. According to linguist Kate Burridge, euphemisms such as these âtell us how it isnâtâ.\n\nEven something as commonplace as life-insurance policies are in reality euphemistic terms for something that really insures oneâs death. But insurance agencies and carriers donât want their product being associated with the social taboo of death, and instead they choose to use the more positively-connoted term âlifeâ to create positive brand recognition. All sorts of euphemisms surround us constantly, and we are often so used to them being used, that we donât even notice.\n\nLinguist Stephen Pinker describes a âeuphemism treadmillâ, which is a good metaphor for the way that the connotations of euphemisms can often change over time, as they are used and over-used. The classic example of this process is in the terms used by Nazi officials in the late 1930s and '40s to describe the Holocaust. Initially, the term âSonderbehandlungâ or âspecial treatmentâ was used to refer to the summary execution of so-called âunfavourable peopleâ. However, this term quickly became as negatively connoted as the term it was designed to replace among the German people, and so the phrase âdie EndlÃ¶sung der Judenfrageâ, âthe final solution to the Jewish Questionâ was formulated - a phrase which again became infamously associated with the atrocities of the Holocaust during the Nuremburg trials. In fact, weâve observed the overwhelmingly negative connotation of this former euphemism recently in Australia, with Fraser Anning being met with widespread criticism after using this term in the senate. In this example, we can see how over time euphemisms can lose their ameliorating effect as they become more associated with that which they are trying to mask.\n\nWhether you believe that euphemisms are a valuable and useful part of our language, or that they are ambiguous and misleading, their prevalence in our contemporary Australian society make them an important part of a discussion of the evolving semantics of Australian English and of language as a whole."
