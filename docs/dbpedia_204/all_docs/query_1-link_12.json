        "text": "Learning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nAddress a range of audiences using a variety of technologies.\n\nAdapt composing processes for a variety of modalities, including textual and digital compositions.\n\nMatch the capacities of different print and electronic environments to varying rhetorical situations.\n\nThe writing genre for this chapter incorporates a variety of modalities. A genre is a type of composition that encompasses defined features, follows a style or format, and reflects your purpose as a writer. For example, given the composition types romantic comedy, poetry, or documentary, you probably can think easily of features of each of these composition types. When considering the multimodal genres, you will discover that genres create conventions (standard ways of doing things) for categorizing media according to the expectations of the audience and the way the media will be consumed. Consider film media, for example; it encompasses genres including drama, documentaries, and animated shorts, to name a few. Each genre has its own conventions, or features. When you write or analyze multimodal texts, it is important to account for genre conventions.\n\nA note on text: typically, when referring to text, people mean written words. But in multimodal genres, the term text can refer to a piece of communication as a whole, incorporating written words, images, sounds, and even movement. The following images are examples of multimodal texts.\n\nMultimodal genres are uniquely positioned to address audiences through a variety of modes, or types of communication. These can be identified in the following categories:\n\nLinguistic text: The most common mode for writing, the linguistic mode includes written or spoken text.\n\nVisuals: The visual mode includes anything the reader can see, including images, colors, lighting, typefaces, lines, shapes, and backgrounds.\n\nAudio: The audio mode includes all types of sound, such as narration, sound effects, music, silence, and ambient noise.\n\nSpatial: Especially important in digital media, the spatial mode includes spacing, image and text size and position, white space, visual organization, and alignment.\n\nGestural: The gestural mode includes communication through all kinds of body language, including movement and facial expressions.\n\nMultimodal composition provides an opportunity for you to develop and practice skills that will translate to future coursework and career opportunities. Creating a multimodal text requires you to demonstrate aptitude in various modes and reflects the requirements for communication skills beyond the academic world. In other words, although multimodal creations may seem to be little more than pictures and captions at times, they must be carefully constructed to be effective. Even the simplest compositions are meticulously planned and executed. Multimodal compositions may include written text, such as blog post text, slideshow text, and website content; image-based content, such as infographics and photo essays; or audiovisual content, including podcasts, public service announcements, and videos."
