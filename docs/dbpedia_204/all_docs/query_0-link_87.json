        "text": "A source annotation in an annotated bibliography fulfills a similar purpose to an abstract: they’re both intended to summarize the approach and key points of a source.\n\nHowever, an annotation may also evaluate the source, discussing the validity and effectiveness of its arguments. Even if your annotation is purely descriptive, you may have a different perspective on the source from the author and highlight different key points.\n\nYou should never just copy text from the abstract for your annotation, as doing so constitutes plagiarism.\n\nMost academics agree that you shouldn’t cite Wikipedia as a source in your academic writing, and universities often have rules against doing so.\n\nThis is partly because of concerns about its reliability, and partly because it’s a tertiary source. Tertiary sources are things like encyclopedias and databases that collect information from other sources rather than presenting their own evidence or analysis. Usually, only primary and secondary sources are cited in academic papers.\n\nA Wikipedia citation usually includes the title of the article, “Wikipedia” and/or “Wikimedia Foundation,” the date the article was last updated, and the URL.\n\nIn APA Style, you’ll give the URL of the current revision of the article so that you’re sure the reader accesses the same version as you.\n\nThere’s some disagreement about whether Wikipedia can be considered a reliable source. Because it can be edited by anyone, many people argue that it’s easy for misleading information to be added to an article without the reader knowing.\n\nOthers argue that because Wikipedia articles cite their sources, and because they are worked on by so many editors, misinformation is generally removed quickly.\n\nHowever, most universities state that you shouldn’t cite Wikipedia in your writing.\n\nA hanging indent is used to indent all lines of a paragraph except the first.\n\nWhen you create a hanging indent, the first line of the paragraph starts at the border. Each subsequent line is indented 0.5 inches (1.27 cm).\n\nA parenthetical citation in Chicago author-date style includes the author’s last name, the publication date, and, if applicable, the relevant page number or page range in parentheses. Include a comma after the year, but not after the author’s name.\n\nFor example: (Swan 2003, 6)\n\nTo automatically generate accurate Chicago references, you can use Scribbr’s free Chicago reference generator.\n\nAPA Style distinguishes between parenthetical and narrative citations.\n\nIn parenthetical citations, you include all relevant source information in parentheses at the end of the sentence or clause: “Parts of the human body reflect the principles of tensegrity (Levin, 2002).”\n\nIn narrative citations, you include the author’s name in the text itself, followed by the publication date in parentheses: “Levin (2002) argues that parts of the human body reflect the principles of tensegrity.”\n\nA parenthetical citation gives credit in parentheses to a source that you’re quoting or paraphrasing. It provides relevant information such as the author’s name, the publication date, and the page number(s) cited.\n\nHow you use parenthetical citations will depend on your chosen citation style. It will also depend on the type of source you are citing and the number of authors.\n\nIbid. may be used in Chicago footnotes or endnotes.\n\nWrite “Ibid.” alone when you are citing the same page number and source as the previous citation.\n\nWhen you are citing the same source, but a different page number, use ibid. followed by a comma and the relevant page number(s). For example:\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid., 36.\n\nIbid., 40–42.\n\nOnly use ibid. if you are directing the reader to a previous full citation of a source.\n\nIbid. only refers to the previous citation. Therefore, you should only use ibid. directly after a citation that you want to repeat.\n\nA signal phrase is a group of words that ascribes a quote or idea to an outside source.\n\nSignal phrases distinguish the cited idea or argument from your own writing and introduce important information including the source of the material that you are quoting, paraphrasing, or summarizing. For example:\n\n“Cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker (1994) insists that humans possess an innate faculty for comprehending grammar.”\n\nIf you’re quoting from a text that paraphrases or summarizes other sources and cites them in parentheses, APA and Chicago both recommend retaining the citations as part of the quote. However, MLA recommends omitting citations within a quote:\n\nAPA: Smith states that “the literature on this topic (Jones, 2015; Sill, 2019; Paulson, 2020) shows no clear consensus” (Smith, 2019, p. 4).\n\nMLA: Smith states that “the literature on this topic shows no clear consensus” (Smith, 2019, p. 4).\n\nFootnote or endnote numbers that appear within quoted text should be omitted in all styles.\n\nIf you want to cite an indirect source (one you’ve only seen quoted in another source), either locate the original source or use the phrase “as cited in” in your citation.\n\nIn scientific subjects, the information itself is more important than how it was expressed, so quoting should generally be kept to a minimum. In the arts and humanities, however, well-chosen quotes are often essential to a good paper.\n\nIn social sciences, it varies. If your research is mainly quantitative, you won’t include many quotes, but if it’s more qualitative, you may need to quote from the data you collected.\n\nAs a general guideline, quotes should take up no more than 5–10% of your paper. If in doubt, check with your instructor or supervisor how much quoting is appropriate in your field.\n\nTo paraphrase effectively, don’t just take the original sentence and swap out some of the words for synonyms. Instead, try:\n\nReformulating the sentence (e.g., change active to passive, or start from a different point)\n\nCombining information from multiple sentences into one\n\nLeaving out information from the original that isn’t relevant to your point\n\nUsing synonyms where they don’t distort the meaning\n\nThe main point is to ensure you don’t just copy the structure of the original text, but instead reformulate the idea in your own words.\n\n“Et al.” is an abbreviation of the Latin term “et alia,” which means “and others.” It’s used in source citations to save space when there are too many authors to name them all.\n\nGuidelines for using “et al.” differ depending on the citation style you’re following:\n\nAPA\n\nMLA\n\nChicago\n\nFootnotes are notes indicated in your text with numbers and placed at the bottom of the page. They’re used to provide:\n\nCitations (e.g., in Chicago notes and bibliography)\n\nAdditional information that would disrupt the flow of the main text\n\nBe sparing in your use of footnotes (other than citation footnotes), and consider whether the information you’re adding is relevant for the reader.\n\nFootnotes appear at the bottom of the page they refer to. This is convenient for the reader but may cause your text to look cluttered if there are a lot of footnotes.\n\nEndnotes appear all together at the end of the whole text. This may be less convenient for the reader but reduces clutter.\n\nBoth footnotes and endnotes are used in the same way: to cite sources or add extra information. You should usually choose one or the other to use in your text, not both.\n\nAn in-text citation is an acknowledgement you include in your text whenever you quote or paraphrase a source. It usually gives the author’s last name, the year of publication, and the page number of the relevant text. In-text citations allow the reader to look up the full source information in your reference list and see your sources for themselves.\n\nIf you are reusing content or data you used in a previous assignment, make sure to cite yourself. You can cite yourself just as you would cite any other source: simply follow the directions for that source type in the citation style you are using.\n\nKeep in mind that reusing your previous work can be considered self-plagiarism, so make sure you ask your professor or consult your university’s handbook before doing so.\n\nPeer review is a process of evaluating submissions to an academic journal. Utilizing rigorous criteria, a panel of reviewers in the same subject area decide whether to accept each submission for publication. For this reason, academic journals are often considered among the most credible sources you can use in a research project– provided that the journal itself is trustworthy and well-regarded.\n\nAcademic dishonesty can be intentional or unintentional, ranging from something as simple as claiming to have read something you didn’t to copying your neighbor’s answers on an exam.\n\nYou can commit academic dishonesty with the best of intentions, such as helping a friend cheat on a paper. Severe academic dishonesty can include buying a pre-written essay or the answers to a multiple-choice test, or falsifying a medical emergency to avoid taking a final exam.\n\nAcademic dishonesty refers to deceitful or misleading behavior in an academic setting. Academic dishonesty can occur intentionally or unintentionally, and varies in severity.\n\nIt can encompass paying for a pre-written essay, cheating on an exam, or committing plagiarism. It can also include helping others cheat, copying a friend’s homework answers, or even pretending to be sick to miss an exam.\n\nAcademic dishonesty doesn’t just occur in a classroom setting, but also in research and other academic-adjacent fields.\n\nTo apply a hanging indent to your reference list or Works Cited list in Word or Google Docs, follow the steps below.\n\nMicrosoft Word:\n\nHighlight the whole list and right click to open the Paragraph options.\n\nUnder Indentation > Special, choose Hanging from the dropdown menu.\n\nSet the indent to 0.5 inches or 1.27cm.\n\nGoogle Docs:\n\nHighlight the whole list and click on Format > Align and indent > Indentation options.\n\nUnder Special indent, choose Hanging from the dropdown menu.\n\nSet the indent to 0.5 inches or 1.27cm.\n\nWhen the hanging indent is applied, for each reference, every line except the first is indented. This helps the reader see where one entry ends and the next begins.\n\nFor a published interview (whether in video, audio, or print form), you should always include a citation, just as you would for any other source.\n\nFor an interview you conducted yourself, formally or informally, you often don’t need a citation and can just refer to it in the text or in a footnote, since the reader won’t be able to look them up anyway. MLA, however, still recommends including citations for your own interviews.\n\nThe main elements included in a newspaper interview citation across APA, MLA, and Chicago style are the names of the interviewer and interviewee, the interview title, the publication date, the name of the newspaper, and a URL (for online sources).\n\nThe information is presented differently in different citation styles. One key difference is that APA advises listing the interviewer in the author position, while MLA and Chicago advise listing the interviewee first.\n\nThe elements included in a newspaper article citation across APA, MLA, and Chicago style are the author name, the article title, the publication date, the newspaper name, and the URL if the article was accessed online.\n\nIn APA and MLA, the page numbers of the article appear in place of the URL if the article was accessed in print. No page numbers are used in Chicago newspaper citations.\n\nUntitled sources (e.g. some images) are usually cited using a short descriptive text in place of the title. In APA Style, this description appears in brackets: [Chair of stained oak]. In MLA and Chicago styles, no brackets are used: Chair of stained oak.\n\nFor social media posts, which are usually untitled, quote the initial words of the post in place of the title: the first 160 characters in Chicago, or the first 20 words in APA. E.g. Biden, J. [@JoeBiden]. “The American Rescue Plan means a $7,000 check for a single mom of four. It means more support to safely.”\n\nMLA recommends quoting the full post for something short like a tweet, and just describing the post if it’s longer.\n\nThe main elements included in image citations across APA, MLA, and Chicago style are the name of the image’s creator, the image title, the year (or more precise date) of publication, and details of the container in which the image was found (e.g. a museum, book, website).\n\nIn APA and Chicago style, it’s standard to also include a description of the image’s format (e.g. “Photograph” or “Oil on canvas”). This sort of information may be included in MLA too, but is not mandatory.\n\nThe main elements included in a lecture citation across APA, MLA, and Chicago style are the name of the speaker, the lecture title, the date it took place, the course or event it was part of, and the institution it took place at.\n\nFor transcripts or recordings of lectures/speeches, other details like the URL, the name of the book or website, and the length of the recording may be included instead of information about the event and institution.\n\nThe main elements included in a YouTube video citation across APA, MLA, and Chicago style are the name of the author/uploader, the title of the video, the publication date, and the URL.\n\nThe format in which this information appears is different for each style.\n\nAll styles also recommend using timestamps as a locator in the in-text citation or Chicago footnote.\n\nEach annotation in an annotated bibliography is usually between 50 and 200 words long. Longer annotations may be divided into paragraphs.\n\nThe content of the annotation varies according to your assignment. An annotation can be descriptive, meaning it just describes the source objectively; evaluative, meaning it assesses its usefulness; or reflective, meaning it explains how the source will be used in your own research.\n\nThe elements included in journal article citations across APA, MLA, and Chicago style are the name(s) of the author(s), the title of the article, the year of publication, the name of the journal, the volume and issue numbers, the page range of the article, and, when accessed online, the DOI or URL.\n\nIn MLA and Chicago style, you also include the specific month or season of publication alongside the year, when this information is available.\n\nIn APA, MLA, and Chicago style citations for sources that don’t list a specific author (e.g. many websites), you can usually list the organization responsible for the source as the author.\n\nIf the organization is the same as the website or publisher, you shouldn’t repeat it twice in your reference:\n\nIn APA and Chicago, omit the website or publisher name later in the reference.\n\nIn MLA, omit the author element at the start of the reference, and cite the source title instead.\n\nIf there’s no appropriate organization to list as author, you will usually have to begin the citation and reference entry with the title of the source instead.\n\nWhen you want to cite a specific passage in a source without page numbers (e.g. an e-book or website), all the main citation styles recommend using an alternate locator in your in-text citation. You might use a heading or chapter number, e.g. (Smith, 2016, ch. 1)\n\nIn APA Style, you can count the paragraph numbers in a text to identify a location by paragraph number. MLA and Chicago recommend that you only use paragraph numbers if they’re explicitly marked in the text.\n\nFor audiovisual sources (e.g. videos), all styles recommend using a timestamp to show a specific point in the video when relevant.\n\nThe abbreviation “et al.” (Latin for “and others”) is used to shorten citations of sources with multiple authors.\n\n“Et al.” is used in APA in-text citations of sources with 3+ authors, e.g. (Smith et al., 2019). It is not used in APA reference entries.\n\nUse “et al.” for 3+ authors in MLA in-text citations and Works Cited entries.\n\nUse “et al.” for 4+ authors in a Chicago in-text citation, and for 10+ authors in a Chicago bibliography entry.\n\nCheck if your university or course guidelines specify which citation style to use. If the choice is left up to you, consider which style is most commonly used in your field.\n\nAPA Style is the most popular citation style, widely used in the social and behavioral sciences.\n\nMLA style is the second most popular, used mainly in the humanities.\n\nChicago notes and bibliography style is also popular in the humanities, especially history.\n\nChicago author-date style tends to be used in the sciences.\n\nOther more specialized styles exist for certain fields, such as Bluebook and OSCOLA for law.\n\nThe most important thing is to choose one style and use it consistently throughout your text.\n\nEvery time you quote a source, you must include a correctly formatted in-text citation. This looks slightly different depending on the citation style.\n\nFor example, a direct quote in APA is cited like this: “This is a quote” (Streefkerk, 2020, p. 5).\n\nEvery in-text citation should also correspond to a full reference at the end of your paper.\n\nThe DOI is usually clearly visible when you open a journal article on an academic database. It is often listed near the publication date, and includes “doi.org” or “DOI:”. If the database has a “cite this article” button, this should also produce a citation with the DOI included.\n\nIf you can’t find the DOI, you can search on Crossref using information like the author, the article title, and the journal name.\n\nA DOI is a unique identifier for a digital document. DOIs are important in academic citation because they are more permanent than URLs, ensuring that your reader can reliably locate the source.\n\nJournal articles and ebooks can often be found on multiple different websites and databases. The URL of the page where an article is hosted can be changed or removed over time, but a DOI is linked to the specific document and never changes.\n\nWhen a book’s chapters are written by different authors, you should cite the specific chapter you are referring to.\n\nWhen all the chapters are written by the same author (or group of authors), you should usually cite the entire book, but some styles include exceptions to this.\n\nIn APA Style, single-author books should always be cited as a whole, even if you only quote or paraphrase from one chapter.\n\nIn MLA Style, if a single-author book is a collection of stand-alone works (e.g. short stories), you should cite the individual work.\n\nIn Chicago Style, you may choose to cite a single chapter of a single-author book if you feel it is more appropriate than citing the whole book.\n\nArticles in newspapers and magazines can be primary or secondary depending on the focus of your research.\n\nIn historical studies, old articles are used as primary sources that give direct evidence about the time period. In social and communication studies, articles are used as primary sources to analyze language and social relations (for example, by conducting content analysis or discourse analysis).\n\nIf you are not analyzing the article itself, but only using it for background information or facts about your topic, then the article is a secondary source.\n\nTo determine if a source is primary or secondary, ask yourself:\n\nWas the source created by someone directly involved in the events you’re studying (primary), or by another researcher (secondary)?\n\nDoes the source provide original information (primary), or does it summarize information from other sources (secondary)?\n\nAre you directly analyzing the source itself (primary), or only using it for background information (secondary)?\n\nSome types of source are nearly always primary: works of art and literature, raw statistical data, official documents and records, and personal communications (e.g. letters, interviews). If you use one of these in your research, it is probably a primary source.\n\nPrimary sources are often considered the most credible in terms of providing evidence for your argument, as they give you direct evidence of what you are researching. However, it’s up to you to ensure the information they provide is reliable and accurate.\n\nAlways make sure to properly cite your sources to avoid plagiarism.\n\nCommon examples of secondary sources include academic books, journal articles, reviews, essays, and textbooks.\n\nAnything that summarizes, evaluates or interprets primary sources can be a secondary source. If a source gives you an overview of background information or presents another researcher’s ideas on your topic, it is probably a secondary source.\n\nCommon examples of primary sources include interview transcripts, photographs, novels, paintings, films, historical documents, and official statistics.\n\nAnything you directly analyze or use as first-hand evidence can be a primary source, including qualitative or quantitative data that you collected yourself.\n\nThe Scribbr Citation Generator is developed using the open-source Citation Style Language (CSL) project and Frank Bennett’s citeproc-js. It’s the same technology used by dozens of other popular citation tools, including Mendeley and Zotero.\n\nYou can find all the citation styles and locales used in the Scribbr Citation Generator in our publicly accessible repository on Github."
