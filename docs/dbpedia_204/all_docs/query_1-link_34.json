        "text": "2022 Update: Check out our TikTok and YouTube channel for the latest GAT updates and how you can succeed even without study!\n\nPart 1: Why the GAT Matters and How To Use It to Your Advantage\n\nThe General Achievement Test (GAT) is a 3 hour assessment based on your general knowledge ranging from English, mathematics and humanity topics. The generalÂ vibe seen from the majority of VCE students is that theyÂ arenât really too sure whyÂ they have to take part in this âexamâ and as a result, most have little care for it. However, the GAT is an important component in the VCE assessment process. Letâs see why:\n\n1. Standardising how teachers grade your SACs between different schools\n\nHave you ever talked to your friend from another school and realised how unfair it was that their SAC length for theÂ same assessmentÂ was twice the amount of time you had for your SAC? Or that perhaps they received the English prompt a week prior to the SAC, rather thanÂ duringÂ the SAC like you did? Well,Â this typeÂ of this discrepancy can be compensated by the GAT as it helps to eliminate any biases from school to school. This means that ultimately, when SAC marks contribute to your overall study score, you can be sure that your gradesÂ have been fairlyÂ compared to all other VCE students across the state. This also means that as a whole cohort, the students undertaking VCE at your school should all try to do their best because a better outcome will reflect better on the schoolâs grading system.\n\n2. Ensuring that your exam marks at the end of year reflect your level and skills\n\nAllÂ end-of-yearÂ papers are checked twice by two different assessors who independently give you a score for your exam. Now if they both give you aÂ similar scoreÂ then great, your exam has been marked. If not, a third assessor will then look at your exam in order toÂ reachÂ an agreement. Then, there is a last check against your GAT mark. If it so happens that your exam markÂ is much lower than what yourÂ GAT mark anticipated you to obtain â in other words,Â if you received a high GAT mark which demonstrates your strong skills in English, mathematics, science or humanities depending on the subject in question,Â then the paper will be reassessed again.Â So, if youÂ do well in the GAT and receive an excellent score and for some reason you under-perform in the exam, then the GAT mark can help lift up your score. If your GAT mark is relatively low, then it probably canât help you, despite you receiving an unexpected low exam grade. Thus, the GAT mark will only ever help you, it can never bring your mark down.Â Thatâs another reason why you should try to do well.\n\n3. Derived Examination Score (DES)\n\nSome students apply for a DES when they experience hardship during their VCE exam period such as personal trauma or an accident. In such situations, the GAT is compared with their exam mark to see whether or not the student demonstrated their full potential or if they under-performed because of their current situation. Again, if the student received a lower exam mark but has a high GAT score, it can mean that perhaps the student didnât do as well as they could have, and thus, their grade may be boosted upwards.Â ManyÂ students believe that they are immune to anything happening to them before or during the exams, but you never know. You may as wellÂ take advantage of what VCAA is offering you â basically a ticket to a better ATAR if youâre ever in need.\n\nNow knowing all this, it is often said that there is no preparation required for the GAT. Of course, if you are the type who would like to fit in some practice before the real thing, then have a look at theÂ GAT archiveÂ available on the VCAA website. While you may not need to âstudyâ for the GAT, it is definitely worth knowing how you can best approach the examination in order to maximise your score outcome.\n\nPart 2: How To Perform Well in the GAT (Without Study)\n\nInÂ Part 1Â above we discussed why itâs important to aim for your best in the GAT, so now weâll discussÂ howÂ you can actually go about doing this. As you know, there are two writing components in the GAT â Writing Tasks 1 and 2, as well as 70 multiple choice questions (MCQ). This post willÂ break down both the writing components and offer you handy tips on how you should approach these tasks in order to maximise your GAT score and potentially increase your overall ATAR.\n\nOrganising your time:\n\nVCAA suggests 30 minutes for both Writing Tasks 1 and 2 leaving the remainder of your time for 70 multiple choice questions. If you are happy with this approach then by all means go for it. However, considering that English is definitely inÂ yourÂ top 4 subjects that contribute significantly to your ATAR, it is worth investing more of your time on the Writing Tasks. Generally, most students spend around 1 minute per multiple choice question which should therefore, only take around 70 minutes to complete the MCQ section. If we bear in mind that some MCQs will be more complex than others, say we dedicateÂ an extra 20 minutes for MCQ, meaning that you should complete the whole MCQ section in around theÂ 90 minutes mark. This means that you can spare an extra 45 minutes for both Writing Tasks, which is definitely worth the investment since youâll have the chance to write more thoughtful and lengthy pieces. Strategically, this is a good approach for any student studying an English subject â which is well, everyone.\n\nWriting Task 1:Â\n\nWhat is it?\n\nWriting Task 1 usually presents you with one or several images along with an abundance of information about a particular topic â donât be surprised if you donât know much or anything in regards to the topic chosen either. Over the past few years, content that has popped up in the GAT includes Mt. Everest, wolves, the ocean and more. Below is an image of what you should expect:\n\nInstructions for Writing Task 1:\n\n'Consider the information on these two pages. Develop a piece of writing presenting the main information in the material. You should not present an argument. Your piece will be judged on:\n\nâ¢ how well you organise and present your understanding of the material,\n\nâ¢ your ability to communicate the information effectively, and\n\nâ¢ how clearly you express yourself.'\n\nWhat is it really asking you to do?\n\nTo write a creative piece utilising the information available in Writing Task 1. When students read the instructions, they find that it is rather vague and therefore, they arenât too sure on how to tackle the writing piece. The worst thing to do, which unfortunately a lot of students fall into the trap of doing, is to simply write a long-winded essay literally regurgitatingÂ the information from the GAT sheet. Instead, in order to demonstrate fantastic organisational skills and âcommunicate the information effectivelyâ, you should aimÂ to create something unique and interesting â for example, for the 2013 GAT on the topic of radios, you could take on a radio host persona or perhaps the persona of someone working behind the scenes at the radio station. This will be an excellent way of executing your writing piece.\n\nOver on my post, Reading My 10/10 Marked CREATIVEÂ GAT Essay | Part 1, I show you exactly how I approached Task One in my trial GAT. IÂ scored a 10/10 and show you my full essay, so I recommend taking a look!\n\nWant to watch this advice? See this video below:\n\nWriting Task 2:\n\nWhat is it?\n\nWriting Task 2 consists of four statements on a contentious issue. Some ofÂ the issues raised in the past have included: are the elderly wiser than the young?, Who are our heroes?, Whether or not material possessions leads to happiness and more. Below is an example from the 2013 GAT:\n\nInstructions from Writing Task 2:\n\n'Consider the statements below. Based on one or more of the statements, develop a piece of writing presenting your point of view. Your piece of writing will be judged on:\n\nâ¢ the extent to which you develop your point of view in a reasonable and convincing way, and\n\nâ¢ how effectively you express yourself.'\n\nWhat is it really asking you to do?\n\nTo write a persuasive piece debating the topic using one or more of the statements to support your opinion. This means that you can either choose to focus on one of the statements and base yourÂ entire contention on that one statement, or alternatively, choose two or more statements as a basis for different arguments (if you wanted to write from a more balanced point of view). Options on how to present the piece include: opinion article, speech, blog post, etc. Remember to includeÂ language techniquesÂ such as rhetorical questions and inclusive language,Â as this is expected in aÂ persuasive piece. Itâs also a good idea to include examples from current affairs, events or people in history, or even your own personal experiences to add some extra flavour to your piece.\n\nRemember that the GAT can only help you improve your VCE mark, it can never bring you down â so make the effort and try your best! Good luck!\n\nFor an overview of English Language, the study design, whatâs involved in the exam and more, take a look at our Ultimate Guide to English Language.\n\nThere are several strategies you can use to your advantage to extend yourself in VCE English Language.Â\n\nMake Finding Examples a Habit\n\nOne simple way to expose yourself to more examples is to follow news pages on social media so that you can see regular updates about current affairs. Have a read through of point 7: Year 12 Essay Topic Categories in our Ultimate Guide to English Language so that you can understand what types of examples you should be keeping an eye out for.Â\n\nRight from the start of the school year, make sure you set up a system to keep track of your examples. You could do this by setting up a document with headings (such as âfree speechâ, âegalitarianismâ, âpolitical correctnessâ, âdouble-speakâ, âethnolectsâ and âAustralian identityâ) and adding examples to this document throughout the year as you find them. For more information about the potential headings you could use, have a look at the dot points in the VCE English Language Study Design from page 17 onwards.Â\n\nIâd also highly recommend checking out Building Essay Evidence Banks for English Language as it teaches you a great table method for storing and analysing your examples.Â\n\nThe advantage of creating an example/evidence bank of some sort is that if you start looking for examples right at the start of the year, youâll have more time to analyse and memorise them. Additionally, youâll also be able to use them far earlier in your essays, which means that the quotes and examples you select will become much easier to remember for the final exam.\n\nHave a Basic Understanding of Australian History, Politics and Social Issues\n\nHaving a basic understanding of Australian history, politics and social issues is highly beneficial for enhancing your analytical skills for English Language. This is essential in developing strong contentions for your essays. Some key issues that would be worth having some background information on include the following:\n\nAustraliaâs colonial history and treatment of Indigenous communities, racism, and the language surrounding these matters.\n\nÂ Look into the following:Â\n\nHow does language reflect or perpetuate prejudice?Â\n\nHow does hate speech affect social harmony?Â\n\nHow can language be used to establish in-group solidarity?\n\nSexism, racism, ableism, homophobia and transphobia.\n\nHow can bias and prejudice be conveyed through language?Â\n\nWhat are some examples of implicit and explicit bias?Â\n\nWhat role does political correctness play in this context?Â\n\nDoes political correctness create benefits or does it restrict societies?Â\n\nEnvironmental issues, and the way this intersects with politics.Â\n\nHow can euphemisms, doublespeak, and bureaucratic language be used to obfuscate or mitigate blame?Â\n\nImmigration and refugee policy related discourse.Â\n\nWhat are the origins of pejoratives such as âboat peopleâ and âqueue jumperâ that are frequently used against refugees?Â\n\nHow does this influence the values or beliefs of a society?Â\n\nBusiness and economic issues, labour exploitationÂ\n\nHow can bureaucratic language and jargon be used to mislead and manipulate?\n\nPolitical affairs (historical and recent)\n\nHow can formal language be used to mitigate blame and responsibility, negotiate social taboos, or establish national identity?Â\n\nHaving an awareness of key events and social issues in Australia, an understanding of the groups that make up Australia, and exposing yourself to a diverse set of media is really important in developing your essay writing skills. It does take time, but what will ultimately happen is that your discussions in your essays will be much more insightful and demonstrate a well thought out argument.\n\nApply Your Critical Thinking Skills\n\nWhen writing essays, try your best to apply your critical thinking skills. Identify the assumptions youâre making when you present a certain point, and try to develop arguments against your position so that you can better understand why you have chosen your side. Developing a holistic and detailed contention is far better than just picking one side out of simplicity, as it allows you to demonstrate consideration and analysis of a range of factors that affect a certain issue. Use your evidence (contemporary examples, linguist quotes and stimulus material) to develop your points, and position yourself to be mindful of any biases you may have by continuously asking yourself what has influenced your way of thinking. Above all, try to discuss your essay prompts with your peers, as this will provide you with different perspectives and help you strengthen your own point.Â\n\nConsistently Revising Metalanguage\n\nConsistently revising metalanguage is crucial for doing well in English Language. Throughout Year 12, consistently revising metalanguage will be your responsibility. It is likely that youâll be spending a greater proportion of class time in learning content, and writing practice pieces. Therefore, itâs really important to figure out a way that works best for you in being able to frequently revise metalanguage. Flashcards are useful for revision on the go, as well as making mind maps so that youâre able to visualise how everything is set out in the study design.Â\n\nOne issue students run into when it comes to learning metalanguage is that theyâre able to define and give examples for metalanguage terms, however, they are unable to understand how those terms fit into the categories under each subsystem. For example, a student is able to remember what a metaphor is, but unable to recall that it fits under semantic patterning. Similarly, a student may know what a pause is, but not know if itâs part of prosodic features or discourse features.Â\n\nItâs important to know what all the categories are because the short answer questions usually ask you to identify features under a particular category (e.g. youâd be asked to talk about semantic patterning, not metaphor or pun). Therefore, spending time on just revising the definitions alone isnât sufficient in learning metalanguage. You also need to be able to ensure that you can recall which category each term fits under. Refer to the study design (pages 17-18), for a list of categories you need to remember; these include:Â\n\nProsodic features\n\nVocal effects\n\nPhonological patterning\n\nProcesses in connected speech\n\nWord classes, word formation processes\n\nSentence types\n\nSentence structures\n\nSyntactic patterning\n\nVoice\n\nCoherence\n\nCohesion\n\nFeatures of spoken discourse\n\nStrategies of spoken discourse\n\nSemantic patterning\n\nSense relations/other semantics\n\nUsing Meaningful Examples in Essays\n\nWhen you talk about a certain variety of English, say for example ethnolects or teen speak, rather than just providing a lexical example or translation, try to find a contemporary example of the term being used in the media, online or by a prominent individual. For example, rather than saying:\n\nÂ âThe lexeme âbetâ is an example of teen speak which allows young people to establish solidarityâ,\n\nyou could say:\n\nÂ âBakery owner Morgan Hipworth, who largely has a teenage following and is a young person himself, employs teenspeak in a video recipe, where he responds to the question âCan you make a 10 layer cheese toastie?â with âBet, letâs go.ââÂ\n\nThis will provide you with a better opportunity to talk about in-groups and identity, rather than just defining and identifying an example as part of a particular variety. In doing so, youâre better able to address the roles of different linguistic examples in a contextualised and detailed manner.Â\n\nIn Building Essay Evidence Banks for English Language youâll see that a short analysis for each of your examples (the ones you are collecting throughout the year) is encouraged, but, you could take things one step further - add on an extra column and combine your analysis and example in a practice sentence. Head to the blog to learn more about building evidence banks.\n\nHow Genre Works\n\nWeâre not supposed to judge a book based on its cover, but for some reason, we just canât help it. Sure, we may not be able to tell if weâre going to enjoy the book, nor can we tell what exactly itâs about, but we can tell the tone, set our expectations, and most importantly, guess at the genre. Look at these three book covers and note how they perfectly show their genres - Sci-Fi, Horror and Life Drama, respectively.Â\n\nGenre is a way of categorising media. We split books, film and music into genres in order to better talk about them and because humans have a strange desire to sort and categorise things. Within whatever medium, genres display certain structures, characters and tropes that audiences expect from that genre. Audiences like to be able to tell the genre of a text because itâs comfortable. If I go to see a superhero movie I expect wacky costumes, cliche dialogue and a final battle scene that the heroes win - were these expectations not to be met, I would likely be a little bit peeved off.Â\n\nBut why should you care about genre in VCE Literature? Itâs not on the study design?Â\n\nWell, not explicitly. In each AoS of the study design, you must engage with âthe ways the literary forms, features and language of texts affect the making of meaningâ, and/or âthe ideas of a text and the ways in which they are presentedâ. Genres are a feature of texts and are one of the ways that a text will present its ideas. Horror is the most notable example of a genre that uses its tropes to send a message - It Follows is a horror where the monster stands in for sexually transmitted disease, Carrie uses horror to show the horrors of high school, Frankenstein is a criticism of those who would âplay godâ. In the Literature study design, the horror genre is represented by Bram Stokerâs 1897 masterpiece, Dracula. Â\n\nFor an overview of the Literature study design, check out The Ultimate Guide to VCE Literature.Â\n\nDracula + The Gothic\n\nI invite you to think hard about the horror films youâve seen and to try to place Dracula into our modern view of horror. Itâs hard to put Stokerâs vampire on the same stage as the Babadook, Annabelle or even the â70s slasher craze. This gives us an incredible opportunity to consider how audiences engaged and continue to engage with genres. In order to analyse genre, it is essential to recognise what the audienceâs expectations were of a genre, and how the author has utilised those expectations for their own ends. Letâs consider Dracula in context.\n\nâDracula is a horror novel. But, we usually donât think about those uptight Victorians reading texts that were designed expressly to scare. The Victorian era was actually one of the golden ages of horror literature though. But, it is distinctly different from our modern understandings of horror as defined by trailblazers like Stephen King. So, why is it different? It is here we must consider the sub-genre. If you have read anything about Dracula, youâll note that it is referred to as a âgothic horrorâ. The gothic genre of literature encapsulates some of the 19th century and certainly the Victorian periodâs (1837-1901) best literature. Dracula of course belongs to this group, but it blows up around 1818 with Mary Shellyâs Frankenstein. Edgar Allen Poe, with his short stories and poetry, is widely lauded as the âFather of American Gothicâ, with âThe Fall of the House of Usherâ published in 1839. Note the dates here. Stoker published Dracula in 1897, a good 79 years after Frankenstein began haunting readers. Which means he had an established and large genre to work with. So, how did Stoker use the gothic in Dracula?\n\nTropes of the Gothic\n\n1) The Gothic Monster\n\nThe vampire myth used by Stoker is turned into the quintessential gothic monster. Dracula existed in the Victorian mind alongside Frankesteinâs monster, Mr. Hyde, and Poeâs mixture of humans made monstrous and surreal monsters like that in âThe Masque of the Red Deathâ. The defining feature of the gothic monster is its role in the story as a representation of something wrong with society, whether itâs increasingly amoral medicinal science, human greed or perverted desire.Â\n\n2) The Creepy Castle\n\nThe creepy castle doesnât have to be a castle. It can be a mansion, a university or the graveyards of London. The important thing is that the setting of the gothic novel should always be - by default - terrifying and evoke a sense of danger. You can never get comfortable in Draculaâs castle, nor in Sewardâs asylum, and neither can the characters.Â\n\n3) Damsel/s in Distress\n\nFor sure an outdated trope, but a constant in the gothic. Itâs a quick and simple way to show that the innocence of young women is threatened by a malignant force. In Dracula, look to Mina, Lucy and Mrs. Westenra. But what happens when the damsel saves herself?\n\n4) Omens, Portents, Visions\n\nVisions in dreams? Random wild animals escaping from ships? Ships docking with a completely dead crew? Random changes in the weather? You might be dealing with a gothic villain, or going mad. In either case, Renfield, Dracula, Mina and Jonothan all deal with portents and visions.Â\n\nAnd This Is Important Becauseâ¦\n\nStoker has followed the predominant tropes of the gothic horror genre. Why is this important for our analysis of Dracula? The ways in which authors use genre and other stylistic elements like form, voice or plot relate directly to their intentions. If we investigate the particular aspects of Stokerâs use of the gothic, we may better understand the views and values that he is promoting. For instance, letâs take Dracula as the gothic monster. Since the gothic monster is always a way to reflect society back onto itself, how is Stoker doing that? A feminist analysis might take Dracula as a reflection of sexual deviancy, which then ties into his constant threat towards women. A post-colonial analysis might question the foreignness of Dracula, and view him as a part of the intrusiveness of foreigners in English society. Either way, youâre touching on a view or value presented by Stoker, and tying it to an aspect of the gothic genre in a way that conveniently also touches on characterisation.Â\n\nLetâs complicate things a little more. The âDamsel in Distressâ trope is clearly evident in Dracula, but what view or value is Stoker commenting on by its inclusion? The simplest answer is that, by showing that women cannot save themselves, Stoker is saying that women are inherently weak and need to be saved by men. But this answer isnât sufficient for a number of reasons. Firstly, what are the women weak to? Is it a physical mismatch between the women and Dracula, keeping in mind that Dracula is also stronger than the novelâs men? Or is it a symbolic weakness to some aspect of Draculaâs character, be it sexuality or magic? Secondly, and more importantly, are all the women victimised by Dracula the same? Well, obviously not.Â\n\nIt could very well be argued that Stoker is subverting the âDamsel in Distressâ trope by actually giving us a woman who is able to be her own saviour (which is actually becoming a trope in itself nowadays!). The dichotomy between Lucy and Mina is a crucial aspect of the text, and the way that Minaâs character doesnât quite fit into the âDamsel in Distressâ archetype is a major interpretative dilemma. By considering the genre tropes, Lucy is clearly a âDamsel in Distressâ who cannot save herself and is unduly victimised by Dracula. It can be argued that her implicit promiscuousness is punished through her murder, but in whatever case, she is distressed and must be saved. Mina, however, has an entirely different view of her distresses. Not only does Mina take on a caring role towards Jonothan - in which Jonothan becomes a âMaster in Distressâ - she actively supports the attempts to save her and kill Dracula. By compiling the journals, letters and newspaper clippings into the epistolary that we the audience are reading, and using herself as a window into Draculaâs mind through their psychic connection, Mina proves to be a means by which to save herself from her distress. So, the question of what Stoker actually thinks about women is still quite open: Lucy is seemingly punished for her character flaws, which indicates a misogynist view of womenâs sexuality, but Mina is praised for her use of masculine qualities like leadership and stoicism. Is Stoker saying women should be more masculine? Less masculine and more traditionally feminine? This entire discussion revolves around how and why the âDamsel in Distressâ trope is being followed or subverted.Â\n\nUsing Genre in VCE\n\nWhilst a genre-based analysis (or a structural analysis) can be a fantastic way to open up discussion and leads to important questions about views and values, the way I have presented it may appear to be another useless and long-winded thing you have to try to shove into an essay when you already have to balance so much in Literature! Fear not, because there are a couple of really easy ways to fit genre into essays without taking up loads of space.\n\nOption one is to use a genre trope as the basis of a paragraph. If your essay contention is thatâ¦\n\nââStoker presents the dangers of foreign immigration to England at the height of its colonial empireâ\n\nâ¦then you can easily write a paragraph discussing thatâ¦\n\nââStoker employs the gothic trope of a supernatural monster in Dracula, using this vampire as a stand-in for foreigners in Englandâ.\n\nThis paragraph would discuss Draculaâs characterisation, and the settings of Transylvania and London, whilst investigating Stokerâs views on Englandâs colonialism and race. In a Developing Interpretations or Close Analysis essay, youâve just touched on several key criteria, including the authorâs views and values, your own credible interpretation of the text and how the text presents its messaging (through characterisation and setting). You can do all these things without mentioning genre, but by explicitly using the language of genre analysis you are likely separating yourself from the student next to you - who had a similar idea but described it in a less interesting way. This is the utility of understanding genre, it gives you the words and concepts necessary to improve your writing and interpretation. The âGothic monsterâ is an easy way to describe an otherwise GIANT concept.\n\nAnother way is to add it to other analyses in passing. Instead of saying âDracula presents Lucy and Mina as foils to demonstrate the ways in which modern womenâs promiscuity is ultimately harmfulâ, you can say âthe presentation of Lucy and Mina as two âdamsels in distressâ in dichotomy with each other demonstrates the differing ways in which Victorian women could doom or save themselvesâ. The latter sentence has not significantly changed the content of the first, still referring to the womenâs opposition to each other, but by phrasing it with âdamsels in distressâ I leave open the possibility of discussing not just Lucyâs promiscuity, but also Minaâs conservative womanhood.Â\n\nFinally, you need not even mention genre or its tropes in the essay, just use it as a thinking tool. If you go back through the previous section of this blog, youâll see just how many questions I am asking about the tropes and ideas I am discussing. By using the trope as a jumping-off point for a series of questions, I can develop a nuanced understanding of multiple views and values and the ways in which they interconnect. Take a trope like the âcreepy castleâ and ask:\n\nâWhy would Stoker put Dracula manor in the text?â\n\nâBecause it sets up the âothernessâ of Dracula.â\n\nâWhy do we need to know that Dracula is the other?âÂ\n\nâBecause he represents a supernatural foreignness that we need to be scared of.â\n\nâOkay, but why is it right at the start, why is it from Jonothanâs perspective?âÂ\n\nAll of these questions offer ways of breaking down the text and they will naturally lead to questions about structure, characterisation and views and values. In doing this, you can start to come up with ways to turn those questions, or the order of those questions into an essay structure. Moreso, this type of questioning is what your teacher, tutors and top-tier Literature students are doing. It is a constant process of asking, answering, reconsidering, reasking and synthesising. And genre is an easy way to start the process.Â\n\nThe big trap students doing both English and Literature fall into is the habit of writing Close Readings like a Language Analysis essay. In essence, the two of these essays must tick the same boxes. But, hereâs why analysing texts in Literature is a whole different ball game â in English, you want to be focusing on the methods that the author utilises to get their message across, whereas Literature is all about finding your own message in the writing.\n\nIn a Language Analysis essay, the chances are that most students will interpret the contention of the writer in a similar fashion and that will usually be stated in the introduction of the essay. Whereas in Literature, it is the formulation of your interpretation of the authorâs message that is what really counts. In a typical Language Analysis essay, the introduction is almost like a summary of whatâs going to be talked about in the next few paragraphs whereas in a close reading, it is the fresh ideas beyond the introduction that the markers are interested in.\n\nFor this reason, every Close Reading that you do in Literature will be unique. The overarching themes of the text you are writing from may be recurring, but for every passage from the text that you are given, what you derive from that will be specific to it.\n\nFrom my experience, this is what stumps a lot of students because of the tendency is to pick up on the first few poetic techniques used in the passages and create the basis for the essay from that. This usually means that the student will pick up on alliteration (or another technique that they find easy to identify) used by the author and then try and match it to an idea that they have discussed in class. Whilst this can be an effective way to structure paragraphs, many students arenât consciously utilising this approach and instead are doing it âby accidentâ under time pressure, or a lack of understanding of other ways to get a point across.\n\nIn general, there are two main approaches that can be followed for body paragraphs in a literature close reading analysis:\n\n1. Start wide and narrow down.\n\nWhat does this mean? So, as I mentioned before, each of your close readings should be very specific to the passages in front of you and not rehearsed. However, itâs inevitable that you are going to find some ideas coming back more often. So, after reading through the passage, you will usually get a general understanding of the tone that the author has utilised. This will indicate whether the author is criticising or commending a certain character or social idea. Using this general overview to start your paragraph, you can then move closer and closer into the passage until you have developed your general statement into a very unique and clear opinion of the authorâs message (with the support of textual evidence of course).\n\nThis is the essay approach that is generally preferred by students but is often used poorly, as without practice and under the pressure of writing essays in exam conditions, many students revert back to the old technique of finding a literary device that they are comfortable with and pushing forth with that.\n\nThe good thing about this approach is that when you understand the general themes that the author covers, you will become better and better at using that lens to identify the most impactful parts of the passage to unpack as you scrutinise the subtle nuances of the writerâs tone.\n\n2. Start narrow and go wide.\n\nYou guessed it - itâs basically the opposite of the approach above. However, this is a more refined way of setting out your exploration of the authorâs message as opposed to what was discussed earlier (finding random literary devices and trying to go from there). Using this approach does not mean that you have no direction of where your paragraph might end, it just means that you think the subtle ideas of the author can be used in culmination to prove their wider opinion. For example, if you get a passage where the author describes a character in great detail (Charlotte BrontÃ« students, you might be familiar!) and you think there is a lot of underlying hints that the author is getting at through such an intricate use of words, then you might want to begin your paragraphs with these examples and then move wider to state how this affects the total persona built around this character and then maybe even a step further to describe how the writerâs attitude towards this character is actually a representation of how they feel towards the social ideas that the character represents.\n\nThe benefit of this approach is that if you are a student that finds that when you try and specify on a couple of key points within a large theme, you end up getting muddled up with the potential number of avenues you could be writing about, this style gives a bit of direction to your writing. This approach is also helpful when you are trying to link your broader themes together.\n\nThe main thing to remember in the structure of your body paragraphs â the link between your examples and the broader themes that you bring up should be very much evident to the marker. They should not have to work to find the link between the examples you are bringing up and the points that you are making. Remember, a Close Reading is all about the passage that is right in front of you and its relation in the context of the whole text and the writerâs message. Be clear about your opinion, it matters!\n\nHappy writing!\n\nSo thereâs approximately a month to go before the Literature exam. Nervous? Confident? Over it?! You might be thinking that they best way to study up until the exam is to just churn out essays after essays after essays. This is a common misconception, and may even hurt your chances for the exam. You want your essays to be âfreshâ with original insight, not stale pieces that sound like youâve written this a hundred times and youâre getting bored. Here are a few tips on how to study for the exam while still keeping your mind activated about Literature!\n\nCritique critical commentary\n\nGoogle critical commentary on your text. You might pick up a new insight or perspective that youâve never thought of. These can help you inform your own original and individual interpretation of the text. It is important to note that while reading critical commentary is incredibly useful in providing âcleverâ interpretations, examiners are really looking for your own interpretation â not a regurgitated version of other peopleâs analyses. Rather than passively reading critical commentary, critique it yourself! Acknowledge and file away its good points, but also form your own stance with whether you agree or disagree with that point of view. Ask yourself why that is your perspective. Developing this critical analysis skill is extremely valuable, and will put you in the mindset for the exam to provide your own original interpretation that pushes the boundaries and the envelope.\n\nChoose random passages and annotate\n\nClose your eyes and pick a random a couple of passages from your text. Photocopy them, print them, however you like, but the most important thing is to spend time annotating them in as much detail as possible. Focus on analysing the language for how the author constructs the text to create meaning. Note sentences that can link to the wider text. This really forces you to analyse the most random passage in the text in extreme detail, which you might have skipped over in class or in your own reading, because it might not have seemed important at the time. Who knows, the exam could throw in a surprise passage that students might not have thought to study in great detail, and you have because youâve been analysing passages at random â not just the major key events!\n\nExaminer reports and word bank\n\nLook through VCAA examiner reports for sample excerpts from high scoring responses. Highlight words and phrases that sound âgoodâ â and adapt them to use yourself! Thereâs nothing wrong with drawing inspiration (stealing) from the examiner reports essaysâ¦ after all theyâre there for you to learn from. Key: youâre drawing inspiration from words, not ideas or sentences â otherwise thatâs just plagiarism and wonât help at all. Create a word bank of vocabulary that suit your texts, which can be a great prompter when youâre struggling to think of a word that accurately expresses on paper what you want to say in your mind.\n\nTimed conditions\n\nThe biggest issue with every literature student in the exam is timing. Thereâs always so many things you want to write and include, that it is simply not possible to include everything. Time yourself. Practice writing in timed conditions. Be disciplined with your time â going over time for the first essay to include maybe one more good point, is to sacrifice finishing your second essay.\n\nExams are without a doubt a stressful period of time for all VCE students, and it can be easy to get caught up and overwhelmed with expectations, wanting to prove yourself and balancing the workload of your other exams. Find time to do small things to benefit yourself for the exam without compromising your mental power (after a very long marathon). Good luck and believe in yourself!\n\n1. Don't focus just on ideas and avoid language engagement.\n\nLanguage engagement is every bit as important as ideas. Sometimes, when you get stuck in philosophical musings, you might find yourself in a place where you're spouting on and on about solipsism or the intrinsic desire for independence in the 19th century Norwegian working class. Literature essays are all about finding balance, and here, that balance means language engagement. Whether you are writing about literary criticism or a passage analysis, you have to be able to support your interpretations with textual evidence.\n\nOften, this requires some creative thinking. You can have a lot of fun with it and the examiners like you to pick up on small details and connect it to a grander scope.\n\nHere's an example from Jane Eyre.\n\nâmy eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.â\n\nâI was not surprised...to feel...the breathing of a fresh and fragrant breeze...The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so musical as my own rejoicing heart.â\n\nIn this passage, Jane is rejoicing over her marriage proposal, but readers are led to understand that this may be a false, idealistic dream of hers. Note the patterns of alliteration â the fricative 'f' shifting to the plosive 'b' in âfount of fruitionâ and âborrowed beamsâ then again from âfresh and fragrant breezeâ to âblither birdsâ. What could it possibly mean?\n\nFricatives tend to indicate freedom, whereas plosives tend to indicate an abruptness â a harsh change. Perhaps, Jane's wild, free joy is immediately followed by plosive alliteration so as to illustrate how her happiness is cut short and her dream is a false one â she will attempt to achieve freedom through this romance, but she will be abruptly and unceremoniously prevented from attaining it.\n\nRegardless, in any passage, there are always things to talk about and little language quirks to exploit to figure out an interpretation. Start from these little details, and build out and out until you tackle your big ideas. All of these ideas should be rooted in language.\n\n2. Don't prioritise complicated language over ideas.\n\nOften, when you think that expressive, complicated writing takes priority over ideas in Literature, you tend to end up with flowery material that becomes more convoluted than it is effective. If you are one of those people (I know it's hard) but kill your darlings. Focus on coming up with original ideas, and express them clearly. Cut out redundancies. Be expressive in a way that is natural and in a way where you know that first and foremost, your language is accurate. Don't go around using metaphors purely for the sake of sounding intellectual when you can express something equally eloquently and beautifully with simpler, fluent text.\n\nRemember: this is not to say that you shouldn't be expressive in Literature. In fact, writing style and the ability to write well is a fundamental component to doing well in this subject. It is just vital that you strike the right balance. This is a good lesson to learn sooner rather than later - and you'll be steering into prime territory for the exam.\n\n3. Don't treat Literature like an English essay. Be free!\n\nGood Literature essays generally tend to be more lively and expressive than English essays. Why? Because Literature just doesn't operate under the same criteria, and it shouldn't be treated as such.\n\nDon't feel like putting in an introduction/conclusion? No need! Don't feel like sticking to a TEEL structure? No problem!\n\nYour focus is creating writing that moves along at a natural, expressive pace, moving through textual evidence to broader ideas. You don't have a structure. You don't have a paragraph quota. You have free reign over a lot of how you write your Literature essays â so find out what works for you.\n\n4. Come up with original interpretations and don't stick with popular readings.\n\nLiterature is one of very few subjects in the entirety of VCE that rewards original thinking. You don't need to go with the crowd consensus on how to read your text: as long as you have the evidence to support your reading! The examiners will reward complex, creative, and unique ideas. Every passage analysis you write should be approached with a fresh perspective â base your interpretation around the text in front of you, and not a dogmatic set of ideas that you bring with you.\n\n5. Let the text before you provide you with the ideas, don't force your ideas into the text.\n\nBy reading literary criticism and expanding the scope of your ideas, you can apply original readings to each set of passages you have. Your essays stand out when they cover new, uncharted territory.\n\nLiterature is all about balance. If you can find it in you to balance language engagement, interpretation, and writing style, I'd say you have yourself a pretty good essay.\n\nRemember not to fall into any of the common traps of the subject, and you'll have put yourself on solid footing to become a true literati.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nHow Genre Works\n\nWeâre not supposed to judge a book based on its cover, but for some reason, we just canât help it. Sure, we may not be able to tell if weâre going to enjoy the book, nor can we tell what exactly itâs about, but we can tell the tone, set our expectations, and most importantly, guess at the genre. Look at these three book covers and note how they perfectly show their genres - Sci-Fi, Horror and Life Drama, respectively.Â\n\nGenre is a way of categorising media. We split books, film and music into genres in order to better talk about them and because humans have a strange desire to sort and categorise things. Within whatever medium, genres display certain structures, characters and tropes that audiences expect from that genre. Audiences like to be able to tell the genre of a text because itâs comfortable. If I go to see a superhero movie I expect wacky costumes, cliche dialogue and a final battle scene that the heroes win - were these expectations not to be met, I would likely be a little bit peeved off.Â\n\nBut why should you care about genre in VCE Literature? Itâs not on the study design?Â\n\nWell, not explicitly. In each AoS of the study design, you must engage with âthe ways the literary forms, features and language of texts affect the making of meaningâ, and/or âthe ideas of a text and the ways in which they are presentedâ. Genres are a feature of texts and are one of the ways that a text will present its ideas. Horror is the most notable example of a genre that uses its tropes to send a message - It Follows is a horror where the monster stands in for sexually transmitted disease, Carrie uses horror to show the horrors of high school, Frankenstein is a criticism of those who would âplay godâ. In the Literature study design, the horror genre is represented by Bram Stokerâs 1897 masterpiece, Dracula. Â\n\nFor an overview of the Literature study design, check out The Ultimate Guide to VCE Literature.Â\n\nDracula + The Gothic\n\nI invite you to think hard about the horror films youâve seen and to try to place Dracula into our modern view of horror. Itâs hard to put Stokerâs vampire on the same stage as the Babadook, Annabelle or even the â70s slasher craze. This gives us an incredible opportunity to consider how audiences engaged and continue to engage with genres. In order to analyse genre, it is essential to recognise what the audienceâs expectations were of a genre, and how the author has utilised those expectations for their own ends. Letâs consider Dracula in context.\n\nâDracula is a horror novel. But, we usually donât think about those uptight Victorians reading texts that were designed expressly to scare. The Victorian era was actually one of the golden ages of horror literature though. But, it is distinctly different from our modern understandings of horror as defined by trailblazers like Stephen King. So, why is it different? It is here we must consider the sub-genre. If you have read anything about Dracula, youâll note that it is referred to as a âgothic horrorâ. The gothic genre of literature encapsulates some of the 19th century and certainly the Victorian periodâs (1837-1901) best literature. Dracula of course belongs to this group, but it blows up around 1818 with Mary Shellyâs Frankenstein. Edgar Allen Poe, with his short stories and poetry, is widely lauded as the âFather of American Gothicâ, with âThe Fall of the House of Usherâ published in 1839. Note the dates here. Stoker published Dracula in 1897, a good 79 years after Frankenstein began haunting readers. Which means he had an established and large genre to work with. So, how did Stoker use the gothic in Dracula?\n\nTropes of the Gothic\n\n1) The Gothic Monster\n\nThe vampire myth used by Stoker is turned into the quintessential gothic monster.

It can be a mansion, a university or the graveyards of London. The important thing is that the setting of the gothic novel should always be - by default - terrifying and evoke a sense of danger. You can never get comfortable in Draculaâs castle, nor in Sewardâs asylum, and neither can the characters.Â\n\n3) Damsel/s in Distress\n\nFor sure an outdated trope, but a constant in the gothic. Itâs a quick and simple way to show that the innocence of young women is threatened by a malignant force. In Dracula, look to Mina, Lucy and Mrs. Westenra. But what happens when the damsel saves herself?\n\n4) Omens, Portents, Visions\n\nVisions in dreams? Random wild animals escaping from ships? Ships docking with a completely dead crew? Random changes in the weather? You might be dealing with a gothic villain, or going mad. In either case, Renfield, Dracula, Mina and Jonothan all deal with portents and visions.Â\n\nAnd This Is Important Becauseâ¦\n\nStoker has followed the predominant tropes of the gothic horror genre. Why is this important for our analysis of Dracula? The ways in which authors use genre and other stylistic elements like form, voice or plot relate directly to their intentions.

Instead of saying âDracula presents Lucy and Mina as foils to demonstrate the ways in which modern womenâs promiscuity is ultimately harmfulâ, you can say âthe presentation of Lucy and Mina as two âdamsels in distressâ in dichotomy with each other demonstrates the differing ways in which Victorian women could doom or save themselvesâ. The latter sentence has not significantly changed the content of the first, still referring to the womenâs opposition to each other, but by phrasing it with âdamsels in distressâ I leave open the possibility of discussing not just Lucyâs promiscuity, but also Minaâs conservative womanhood.Â\n\nFinally, you need not even mention genre or its tropes in the essay, just use it as a thinking tool. If you go back through the previous section of this blog, youâll see just how many questions I am asking about the tropes and ideas I am discussing. By using the trope as a jumping-off point for a series of questions, I can develop a nuanced understanding of multiple views and values and the ways in which they interconnect. Take a trope like the âcreepy castleâ and ask:\n\nâWhy would Stoker put Dracula manor in the text?â\n\nâBecause it sets up the âothernessâ of Dracula.â\n\nâWhy do we need to know that Dracula is the other?âÂ\n\nâBecause he represents a supernatural foreignness that we need to be scared of.â\n\nâOkay, but why is it right at the start, why is it from Jonothanâs perspective?âÂ\n\nAll of these questions offer ways of breaking down the text and they will naturally lead to questions about structure, characterisation and views and values. In doing this, you can start to come up with ways to turn those questions, or the order of those questions into an essay structure. Moreso, this type of questioning is what your teacher, tutors and top-tier Literature students are doing. It is a constant process of asking, answering, reconsidering, reasking and synthesising. And genre is an easy way to start the process.Â\n\nâOnce upon a timeâ¦â\n\nThe fairy tale of Cinderella is a well-known, well-loved and well-ingrained story that was always told to me as a bedtime story. Who could forget the mean-spirited stepsisters who punished and ruined Cinderellaâs life to no end? According to the dark Brothers Grimm version, the stepsisters mutilated their feet by cutting off their heels and toes to fit into the infamous shoe, and their eyes were pecked away by birds until they were blinded! Itâs definitely one way to send a message to childrenâ¦ donât be bullies or youâll be punished. Which is exactly what the Brothers Grimmâs views and values were. Their construction of their fairy tale to send a message of what they viewed as âgoodâ or âbadâ is simplistically shown through the writersâ choice in determining the charactersâ fate. The evil stepsisters are punished, while Cinderella receives happiness and riches because she remained kind and pure. A clear and very simple example of how texts reflect the beliefs, world views and ethics of the author, which is essentially the authorâs views and values!\n\nWhat are the views and values of a text?\n\nWriters use literature to criticise or endorse social conditions, expressing their own opinions and viewpoints of the world they live in. It is important to remember that each piece of literature is a deliberate construction. Every decision a writer makes reflects their views and values about their culture, morality, politics, gender, class, history or religion. This is implicit within the style and content of the text, rather than in overt statements. This means that the writerâs views and values are always open to interpretation, and possibly even controversial. This is what you (as an astute literature student) must do â interpret the relationship between your text and the ideas it explores and examines, endorses or challenges in the writerâs society.\n\nHow do I start?\n\nConsider the following tips:\n\nWhat does the writer question and critique with their own society? What does this say about the writerâs own views and the values that uphold?\n\nFor example, âJane Austen in Persuasion recognises the binding social conventions of the 19th century as superficial, where they value wealth and status of the utmost priority. She satirises such frivolous values through the microcosmic analysis of the Elliot family.â\n\nThe writerâs affirming or critical treatment of individual characters can be a significant clue to what values they approve or disapprove of. What fate do the characters have? Who does the writer punish or reward by the end of the text?\n\nWhich characters challenge and critique the social conventions of the day?\n\nLook at the writerâs use of language:\n\nImagery\n\nSymbolism\n\nCharacterisation\n\nPlot structure\n\nSetting\n\nDescription\n\nIn other words â¦what are the possible meanings generated by the writerâs choices?\n\nRecognition and use of metalanguage for literary techniques is crucial because you are responding to a work of literature. Within literature ideas, views and values and issues do not exist in a vacuum. They arise out of the writerâs style and create meaning.\n\nHow do the writerâs choices make meaning?\n\nHow are the writerâs choices intended to affect the readerâs perception of social values?\n\nWeave views and values throughout your close analysis essays, rather than superficially adding a few lines at the conclusion of the essay to indicate the writerâs concerns.\n\nUsing the writerâs name frequently will also assist in creating a mindset of analysing the writerâs commentary on society.\n\nBelow are some examples from an examiner report of successful and insightful responses reflecting the views and values of the writer:\n\n(Another tip is to go through examinerâs reports and take note of high quality responses, even if they are not the text youâre studying)\n\nWhen contrasted with the stark, blunt tone of Caesar throughout the play âYou may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know...â the richness of Shakespeareâs poetry with regard to his âcouple so famousâ denotes how the playwright himself ultimately values the heroic age to which his protagonists belong over the machinations of the rising imperial Rome.\n\nIt is the word ânaturalâ here through which Mansfield crafts a sharp irony that invites us to rate Ednaâs obsession with her own performance.... It is this satiric impulse that also leaps to the fore through the image of Edna, âclasping the black book in her fingers as though it were a missalâ...the poignant economy of Mansfieldâs characteristic style explores her views on the fragility of the human condition.\n\nâIn Cold Bloodâ provides a challenging exploration of the value placed on human life. The seemingly pointless murders undermine every concept of morality that reigns in Middle America, the âBible Beltâ, as well as the wider community. Capote insinuates his personal abhorrence of the death penalty and the disregard of mental illness in the justice system.\n\nWhy are views and values important in literature, and especially for close analysis?\n\nEvery year, the examiner reports emphasise how the best close analysis responses were ones that âshowed how the text endorsed and reflected the views and values of the writer and were able to weave an understanding of these through the essayâ (2013 VCAA Lit examiner report). By analysing HOW the text critiques, challenges or endorses the accepted values of the society in the text, you are demonstrating an understanding of the social and cultural context of the text, thus acknowledging the multifaceted layers that exist within literature. You are identifying the writerâs commentary of humanity through your own interpretation. Bring some insight into your essays!\n\nEver since literary perspectives have been introduced into the VCE Literature study design in 2017, thereâs been a hell of a lot of confusion surrounding what they actually are, and what students are supposed to do with them. Due to the incredibly subjective nature of English, and especially Literature, as a subject, there is no single correct answer as to how to go about it. However, I hope to shed some light for you on how to go about this elusive component of VCE Literature.\n\nâ\n\nSo, what are they?\n\nFirstly, what actually are perspectives? Well, they can be compared to a lens which you use to colour or filter your analysis of the text. You use the ideas and schools of thought that are specific to each perspective to shape, influence and guide your writing. There are a whole bunch of these perspectives, including psychoanalytical, Marxist, feminist and postcolonial. For your SAC during the year, you are going to need to use two different perspectives in your essay, whilst you will only use one in the end of year exam. Personally, while studying Elizabeth Gaskellâs âNorth and Southâ, I used Marxist and feminist in my SAC and narrowed it down to Marxist for the exam.\n\nHow do I begin?\n\nThe best place to start, after having read the text of course, is to read up on what other people have to say about the book. Perspectives are closely intertwined with literary criticisms; that is, other peopleâs analysis and interpretation of the texts. For Literature, this needs to go into a bit more depth than someone telling you whether or not they liked the text. Some people like to include excerpts of other criticsâ writing in their perspectives essays. Whilst this is not wrong, it isnât the only way to go about it either. My class simply used these critics as a way of finding inspiration for our own ideas.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be given a whole bunch of scholarly readings and critiques of âNorth and Southâ by my teacher; however, if you arenât as lucky, scholar.google.com and the State Library of Victoriaâs online database are both amazing sources for such information. You can simply search up the title of your text, and maybe the authorâs name to narrow down results, and youâre provided with scores of articles. Iâd recommend reading as many of these as possible, and maybe even jotting down some key points or ideas that stand out to you as important or useful as you go along.\n\nHow do I choose which perspective to use?\n\nWith all those different perspectives out there, it can become difficult to narrow all the options down to two, and then one. Whilst some texts definitely lend themselves to certain perspectives more than others, the idea is that you can use whichever perspective you want for whichever text if you try hard enough. Sure, it may be hard to find evidence to support them all, but it is expected that, as a Literature student, you are able to read deep enough into the texts that you could find what you need to write on any of them.\n\nMy advice is to choose the perspective that initially jumps out at you. When you read the text for the first, second and even third time, there will be certain plot points and themes that present themselves to you. By analysing these, youâll be able to see what connects them, and most likely be able to relate them to a particular perspective.\n\nHow do I write a perspectives essay?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, there is no stock standard formula that all perspectives essays must follow. But there are a few basic guidelines that can help you get the ball rolling.\n\nPerspectives essays have the same basic structure as a normal English essay, but differ in the sense that they are more focused on a particular school of thought.\n\nBe sure to build up an inventory of useful words or phrases unique to your chosen perspective that will help clue the examiner in to what approach youâre taking. For example, when I was exploring a Marxist perspective, I would include phrases like âbourgeoisieâ, âinterclass relationsâ and âsocial hierarchyâ. That being said, there is no need to explicitly state, âFrom a Marxist perspectiveâ¦â in your essay. By including those subtle, little expressions unique to your chosen perspective, you should be able to signpost to the examiner what your perspective is without making your essay seem basic. As you spend more time exploring your chosen perspective, you will become more familiar and comfortable with a range of these specific expressions.\n\nHelp! I canât decide which perspective to choose! What do I do?\n\nIf you find yourself, like I did, stuck when choosing which perspective you want to use, there are a couple of different things to can do to try and get yourself out of this funk.\n\nTo start off, Literature is an extremely collaborative subject. It naturally opens itself to a discussion between you and your classmates. In fact, this is a great way to build more ideas and strengthen the ones you already have for all parts of the Literature study design, not only this one. Iâd recommend you have a chat with the other people in your class and talk through all your options and the evidence that you could use to support them. I find that by talking in this way, my jumbled ideas tend to become a bit clearer in my head, and Iâm often exposed to new ideas as well.\n\nSecondly, your Literature teacher is, of course, another port of call. You literally pay them to teach you Literature and make sure you walk into your SAC and exam as prepared as possible, so why wouldnât you take full advantage of their expertise? Explain to them your problem and your thoughts up until this point, and Iâm sure theyâll be able to, if not provide you with, point you in the right direction towards finding some clarification.\n\nLastly, you need to remember that you are ultimately the one who needs to make the decision. As cheesy and clichÃ© as it sounds, just listen to what your gut tells you. Your first thoughts are usually the best ones, so just go with your instinct and see where it tells you to go!"
