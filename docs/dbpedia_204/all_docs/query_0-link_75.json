        "text": "I delivered this lecture on 12/7/2017. A quick note on citations: All quotations from and related to Joan of Arc’s trial derive from Joan of Arc: La Pucelle (Manchester University Press, 2006). Perhaps controversially, I have opted not to include page numbers for quotations; they are identified here solely by the document number in the series. I have chosen to leave out page numbers to ensure students writing papers on these documents will need to consult the original source if they should like to use the same quotations I have chosen in their own papers.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Doubleday, a historian of the middle ages, gave you a sense of how the documents in the Joan of Arc sourcebook fit into the larger political and geographical contexts that are part of the hundred years’ war. He also explained to you why these documents, especially those from the first trial, are so remarkable in giving voice to what would otherwise be missing or silent; and of course, he showed us multiple examples of how Joan has been mythologized in a variety of later representations, from Morrissey to Marine Le Pen, images which often tell us as much about the time of their production as they tell us about Joan of Arc. These interests in representation and in historical records are among the many things that Dr. Doubleday’s field of medieval history and my own field of early modern literature have in common; our complementary aims and shared interests go beyond the mutual appreciation of animal marginalia.\n\nTo build on some of the threads he laid out on Tuesday, I’d like to talk a bit more about how documents such as those we’ve read for this week function as evidence, and look more particularly at the ways that legal records and other primary sources work in relation to works that are more obviously fiction. At this point, you already know about at least one fictional version of Joan’s story that made use the non-fictional trial documents in order to bring Joan back to life temporarily: In addition to the film that Dr. Doubleday mentioned Tuesday, we also have George Bernard Shaw’s play from 1923, St. Joan.\n\nBoth Shaw and the director of The Passion of Joan of Arc created their works after reading some of the same documents that you’ve been assigned.\n\nYou also read works of literature that were contemporaneous with the hundred years’ war and Joan’s first trial in the portions I assigned for today: you read two poems, the anonymous “Virgo Puell-ares” and the song by Christine de Pisan. As with the film and Shaw’s dramatic retellings of the trial, I’m guessing it isn’t hard for you to see these poems as being distinct in kind from the depositions and even the letters that you read for today and Tuesday. The anonymous verse doesn’t look that much like a poem, but even with a translation that reads more like prose, we can still see the embellished nouns and parallel phrasing that we associate with poetry: look at the description of Joan’s “maidenly limbs clothed in male attire” and Charles VII as “the fallen lily-bearer”:\n\nNote the additional repetition of grammatical combinations in “the abominable enemies” and “the deceitful English,” juxtaposed with the “kindly Pucelle,” whose “maidenly war” will usher in a “beautiful peace.” From these subjective embellishments, we can see that its author is a fan of Joan and her cause; the poet exploits the apparent paradox of Joan’s status as a virgin girl in both men’s clothing and the masculine pursuit of war, repeating the word “maidenly” in a way that makes pants sound lovely and military action almost peaceful.\n\nNow let’s compare the poet’s carefully chosen adjectives to a passage from the courtroom deposition that Dr. Doubleday discussed last time as being as close as we can get to Joan’s voice:\n\nIt essentially lists questions and answers, and though we see repeated phrases here, they are not so much used for dramatic effect as they to relay what happened and what happened next. Moreover, whereas we can see the poet was free to take a position on Joan and project a sense of France’s status in the future, both the intentions and the words of the courtroom scribe are circumscribed by the nature of their employment and it reports only on what has passed. Recorders are to document precisely and only what they hear, not what they think or what they imagine would persuade future audiences to consider their own subjective perspectives on events.\n\nBut, as Dr. Doubleday suggested in his lecture, there are parts of the transcription of Joan’s testimony that invite more analysis: the fact that she refers to France and her “country” as if they are separate entities, for instance. As a scholar of English literature, culture and history from a slightly later period, I want to second the implications of Dr. Doubleday’s comments on this example, and insist that we must read language in all kinds of texts very closely to understand the world’s complexities.\n\nOf the many documents we have about Joan, the one I want to focus on is from Part IV of the Source book, the section of documents from the Nullification Trial. From the phrase that we use to refer to this trial, from Tuesday’s lecture, and from your reading of Document 102, you’ll know the outcome of the Nullification trial: The group assembled to re-litigate Joan’s trial concludes by “quash[ing], reject[ing] and annul[ing] the twelve articles against her as false,” noting that they were “extracted by slander and deceit,” and “different from the testimony.” Indeed, because the trial record “contain[ed] deceit, slander, contradiction and manifest error of law and of fact,” it was “null, invalid, without effect or value.”\n\nOne of the documents I recommended, but didn’t require, for today offers compelling insight into these charges, though of course, as Dr. Doubleday noted, we need to be aware of the context that led to the production of these documents. For now, let us take seriously the Deposition of Master Guillaume Manchon, a person employed during the original trial as a notary. In his testimony from 1456, 25 years after Joan’s death, the transcript reads: “Having been shown the trial record that he had been forced to submit, the witness affirmed that this was the true record drawn up during the course of the trial. He agreed that it had been signed by himself and his colleagues, that it contained the truth and that he had drawn up two further exemplars in this fashion.”\n\nThere are several portions of these sentences that highlight the authenticity of the documents from the original trial record: the witness claims ownership of the writing, confirms his role and his hand in the production of those records, and even taking into account its translation from one language to another, “agree[s]…that it contain[s] the truth.” But somewhat undermining our confidence is that phrase suggesting that he “had been forced to submit” the record. In another part of the testimony, we are told “the witness was forced to participate in this affair as a notary, and he did so against his will, because he did not dare to go against an order of the lords of the King’s council.” Of some of the others employed in other roles, he says “he believed that they would not have dared to refuse to come, and there was no one who was not afraid.”\n\nHe explains in another instance that counsellors did not dare say anything in defense of Joan “because each one feared displeasing the Bishop and the English.” As further illustration of the intimidation suffered by those involved, he cites one Nicolas de Houppeville, who “was summoned to take part in the trial, and because he declined to act he was in great danger,” and another person whose defense of Joan results in him being followed later by a man “with his sword unsheathed.” The feelings of fear remained even after the trial concluded; because of Joan’s death, we are told, “The witness said that he had been so shaken that he remained terror-stricken for a month.”\n\nIn addition to the suggestion that the records were produced under the great duress of some of the people involved, the same deposition also challenges the prospect that they offered a unified, singular account of what occurred:\n\n“Questioned about the French trial record, which was shown to the witness and in which the word ‘Nota’ was found at the top of many articles, he replied as follows: in the course of the first cross- examinations of Joan, on the first day, there was a great tumult in the chapel of the castle at Rouen and Joan was interrupted at almost every word when she was speaking about her apparitions. There were two or three secretaries of the King of England there, who wrote down the words and the testimony of Joan as they pleased, leaving out her excuses and anything which served to exonerate her.”\n\nHere, Machon gives us a sense of the conditions under which Joan supplied answers, with her words interrupted, omitted, and even invented by agents of the English King Henry VI. Accordingly, “many records” indicate elements for which there were competing versions of testimony and disputes over the veracity of the records therein. He reiterates these claims in another portion of his deposition, telling us about “notaries hidden in a window by curtains” and describing “a great difference in their writings” and “serious disagreement between them.”\n\nEven if this account doesn’t undermine your faith in the three depositions you read for Tuesday, you must admit that it does a lot to complicate them.\n\nNow let’s attend to one additional layer that gives additional insight into the matter of the original trial documents’ credibility. “On the contents of the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th articles,” we are told,\n\n“the Lord of Warwick, the Bishop of Beauvais and Master Nicolas Loiseleur told the witness and the other notary what follows: in order to know the truth about her more fully, that Master Nicolas should pretend to be from the region of Lorraine, like Joan, and under the obedience of the King of France. He would enter the prison in the clothing of a layman, the guards would retire, and Joan and he would remain alone in the prison. In a room adjoining the dungeon, an opening was made specially, and the witness and his associate were ordered to go there in order to hear what Joan was saying; the Bishop and the Earl were also there and could not be seen by Joan. [he questioned her], pretending to give news about the state of the realm and about her revelations; Joan replied, believing that he was from her region and under the obedience of the King of France.”\n\nMachon stresses in this deposition that although he had instructed by the Bishop and the Earl of Warwick “to write down her replies …he would not do it and [said] that it was not honest to begin the trial record in this way…but if she said the same things in open court they would write them down completely willingly.” We might think that, through Machon’s scrupulous refusal to take down comments that were obtained by deceitful means, the trial’s records are more just than they might have been. But note what the end of this passage makes clear — that, despite Machon’s purported resistance, Loiseleur maintains an influential role in the trial nonetheless, attempting to entrap her while disguised as a friendly advisor: “He added that afterwards Joan always had great confidence in this Loiseleur, so much so that he heard her confession many times after these deceptions and Joan was generally not brought into court without having spoken with [him] beforehand.”\n\nIt is, I think, not clear from these documents alone, whether he was or was not a friend to her at the conclusion of the first trial. Machon quotes him as saying: ‘Joan, believe me, because you will be saved if you want. Take your clothing [of a woman] and do whatever you are told; if not you will be in danger of death. And if you do what I tell you, you will be saved, and you will receive good [treatment] and no harm, and you will be handed over to the Church.” Although he appears to be willing to entrap Joan by pretending to be somebody he is not, Loiseleur’s advice may have been genuinely intended as good counsel; had she followed it, and taken up women’s clothing, perhaps she would have been merely imprisoned and later released. Of course, she ultimately returned to her male attire and was subsequently burned at the stake, so it’s hard to say whether, or precisely how, the initial acts of deception affected the outcome.\n\nIn any event, as much as we might feel even more sympathy for Joan as we read about these methods, we also need to be careful in putting too much stock in Machon’s deposition or any others from the Nullification trial. As Professor Doubleday noted Tuesday, this second trial was, like the first one in that it was undertaken at the behest of a monarchy with a desired outcome. Moreover, as Craig Taylor (the editor of the sourcebook) observes, “the witnesses consistently avoided personal responsibility for any of the actions of the Rouen trial, instead blaming the English for exerting pressure to secure the death of Joan, and arguing that they had been frightened into cooperating with such a manifestly unjust action.” In fact, he goes further than Professor Doubleday in positing that “the primary goal of the Nullification trial may not have been to restore the reputation of the Pucelle[,] but [rather,] to expunge the legacy of [French] collaboration with the English and to give added substance to her dream of a united France” (42). In this respect, at least, the motives seem no less subjective than those we see on display Christine de Pisan’s poem.\n\nWhile Professor Doubleday hinted I’d say more about this work, I’m going to instead encourage you to discuss it in your sections. I’m going to stick for just a little bit with Machon’s deposition in order to transition to the second main topic of my lecture today, and that’s to consider more deeply the way these texts construct Joan’s body as a trial in and of itself.\n\nMachon describes Joan’s decision to wear masculine attire in two parts of the document. One reads as follows:\n\n“…asked about the contents of the 26th and 27th articles, he declared that during the trial he had heard Joan complain to the Bishop and to the Earl of Warwick when she was asked why she did not put on the clothes of a woman, because it was not decent for a woman to have a tunic and hose of a man, attached with many tightly knotted laces. She replied that she did not dare take off the hose, or to keep them otherwise than tightly knotted, because as the Bishop and Earl well knew, her guards had tried many times to violate her; and once when she was crying, this Earl, hearing her cries for help, came to her and if he had not come her guards would have raped her.”\n\nThe second instance concerns the moment preceding her death, occasioned because, despite promising to wear a dress, Joan resumed wearing men’s clothing. We are told:\n\n“In the presence of the witness, Joan was asked why she had resumed this male clothing. She replied that she had done it to protect her chastity, because she was not safe in her female garments with guards who wished to molest her; she had complained many times about this to the Bishop and to the Earl, and the judges had promised her that she would be in the hands, and in the prison, of the Church, and that she would have a woman with her. She had added that if it pleased the lord judges to put her in a safe place, where she would have nothing to fear, then she was ready to resume female clothing…”\n\nAs a note from your editor indicates in this section, similar comments appear in the testimony of three additional people, an emphasis we do not see voiced by Joan herself in the testimony you read for Tuesday. Whether or not she wore male clothing for this reason, it is clear that those clothes played an outsized part in the determination she was a heretic, and that her gender and sexual status are always at the center of how men perceived her. We see this even in the Duke of Alencon, whose testimony concludes with praise of her skill on horseback and with military strategy.\n\n“He also said that Joan was chaste and very much detested the women who follow the armies. The witness saw her once at Saint-Denis on the return from the coronation of the King, pursuing with a naked sword a girl living with the men-at-arms and in the pursuit she broke her sword.…He also said that sometimes on campaign, he slept near Joan and the men-at-arms on straw; he sometimes saw Joan dressing, and sometimes he saw her breasts which were beautiful. But the witness never felt any carnal desire towards her.”\n\nUpstanding aristocrat that the Duke is, he of course is not like the men that surrounded Joan in her imprisonment, which Guillaume Machon described as “four or five guards of the lowest kind.” For Alencon, Joan isn’t an object upon which to exercise his sexual will at all, as he insists that with Joan, a fellow soldier and apparently a- or anti-sexual being, “he never felt any carnal desire.” The same passage also has her denouncing the “girl[s] living with the men-at-arms” or “follow[ing] the armies.” Notice the imagery he uses to describe the contrast between this girl and Joan, figuring one as dissolute and frivolous, and the other pure and righteous: Joan’s sword, a typical symbol of virility, is unsheathed, described in figurative terms as “naked.” The girl who flees this sword may be fully clothed, but the close proximity of the word and Joan’s pursuit give us the image of one naked object chasing out another. Joan is depicted as despising the girl whose presence blunts her soldiers’ serious purpose as warriors, with the effects of the female presence illustrated in both literal and metaphorical terms in the description of Joan’s broken sword. I think I hardly need to point out here that a deposition might contain imagery that is as vivid as a poem.\n\nIn fact, it seems particularly striking that the image of Joan’s naked broken sword sets up Alencon’s casual remark that he has literally seen Joan naked. While this is something we might expect of soldiers sleeping in close quarters, Alencon nonetheless highlights it as an anomaly from regular protocol by noting that “he sometimes saw her breasts which were beautiful.” If we can appreciate that he assures his audience he felt no desire to have sex with Joan upon seeing them, we should still ask why he includes this appraisal in the first place.\n\nThe most charitable reading we can offer is that this detail speaks to the degree to which Joan was a professional soldier amongst professional soldiers, a serious presence in the camp and a highly moral one whose chaste actions encouraged nothing but extreme chastity in others. And perhaps to his credit, Alencon is attempting to refute the charge that Joan’s male dress represented any kind of moral perversion. Under her armor, she’s still a woman. But comments like this, ostensibly intended to diffuse gender difference, nonetheless end up highlighting the sexual roles of female bodies­­ — even in spite of evidence that those bodies can lead other bodies into battle.\n\nImportantly, it is not just Alencon that promotes this image of her as a virgin, for Joan does so herself by calling herself “La Pucelle,” a word that means “girl” and was used as a synonym for virgin as well. It is necessary for her to profess and maintain her status as a virgin for the same reasons Alencon must insist that she’s still a woman underneath her armor. But here again, it is what differentiates her from the men in the field, even as her purity apparently inspires purity in some of them. Male soldiers do not have the same imperative to abstain from sexual activity, as we see in the example of the fleeing woman, and if virginity licenses Joan’s attire and her call to arms, its heightened value also makes her extraordinarily vulnerable. So this point brings me to the second body of evidence I want to discuss today.\n\nIf you arrived here a bit early today, you were fortunate to catch a 5 minute bit from the 2016 film by Joel and Ethan Coen, Hail Caesar!\n\nYou may have wondered why I was showing that. I played the clip because you seemed to react positively to an image from Magic Mike that Dr. Sills included in his Marie de France lecture, and, though I’m not a fan of the Magic Mike franchise or Stephen Soderberg, I do love the Coen Brothers. But I also played it because think the song he sings as he taps his way around the tavern is useful for thinking about what it’s like to be Joan of Arc in the camp, in the courtroom, and on even on the scaffold.\n\nThe song is called “No Dames.” It’s about a group of nubile sailors whose shore leave has come to an end, and they are about to ship out. “No Dames” begins as a lament about what shipping out means:\n\nWe are heading out to sea.\n\nAnd however it will be.\n\nIt ain’t gonna be the same.\n\n’Cause no matter what we see\n\nwhen we’re out there on the sea,\n\nWe ain’t gonna see a dame.\n\nOh, we’ll see a lot of fish.\n\nBut we’ll never clock a dish.\n\nWe ain’t gonna see a dame.\n\nNo dames…\n\nThe purpose of the song is to decry the impending absence of women. Because of the perceived physical superiority of male bodies, military spaces like the warship and the camp are necessarily homogenous, homosocial, and, remember Irigiray’s term from Dr. Schwab’s first lecture, “homme-sexual,” and intentionally exclusionary.\n\nOf course, the message we hear is, as the song progresses, undermined by what we see. By virtue of the dance, the song is a celebration of the male body, what it can do, and more specifically, what it can do in the presence of other male bodies. Moves like\n\nthis…\n\nthis…\n\n…and this.\n\nWhat we see here is not totally out of step with a great many images of soldiers or sailors dancing, where less overtly sexual moves are an extension or playful inversion of the serious march and drill.\n\nBut it’s quite clear that the one from Hail Caesar is self-consciously drawing our attention to something else. The scene takes place in a tavern that could ostensibly be inhabited by women, like, say, this scene in the iconic 80’s film Top Gun:\n\nBut, in fact, as the all-male routine is more akin to these other scenes, in which men channel their warrior energy and bodies in rituals of competitive fun:\n\nThe dance to “No Dames” seems to be challenging audiences to acknowledge, among other things, the aggressive desire underlying the intense brand of bro-loving masculinity that pervades high budget patriotic films like Top Gun.\n\nFor a Shakespeare scholar like me, it’s also hard not to see this scene as a nod to the dance number at the conclusion of a 1970s film version of The Tempest by pioneer filmmaker and gay activist Derek Jarman.\n\nBut if you know your musical theater, you know that “No Dames” is more directly an allusion to the 1958 musical and film, South Pacific, which likewise features some love-pining sailors. The complaint these men profess in a song called “There’s nothing like a Dame” is the same as that sung by Channing’s character and his mates in Hail Caesar; they have everything they might want while they’re out doing the country’s martial business…except women:\n\nWe got sunlight on the sand,\n\nWe got moonlight on the sea,\n\nWe got mangos and bananas\n\nYou can pick right off a tree,\n\nWe got volleyball and ping-pong\n\nAnd a lot of dandy games!\n\nWhat ain’t we got?\n\nWe ain’t got dames!\n\nHail Caesar rewrites this song and the musical number not to introduce a new subtext, but to illuminate one that is always lurking in homosocial spaces and what transpires without apology in The Symposium: once the flute girls are dispatched, the real stuff can begin.\n\nThe humor and political power of the scene in Hail Caesar, set in 1951, is not just in its exposure of the gay subtexts of other films stems from its flaunting of behaviors that, in the US military, were subject to homophobic, discriminatory policies. There is additional critical power, I’d argue, in its assessment that attraction and desire are dynamic, subjective, and experiential — and that we’re deluded if we see them as exclusively heterosexual. But then this means that the absence of “dames” in military settings is only a pretend problem, and, therefore, in fact, the presence of women in these spaces isn’t a real problem either. Because one of the primary reasons for keeping women away from the camp and the ship — that women will necessarily mean conjugal visits that divert men’s attention from martial discipline — seems rather silly once one acknowledges men can and do have sex with other men.\n\nOf course, this simple fact doesn’t on its own tackle the perception that the camp could be ruined by woman, for the thing that Euripides’s Hypolitus invokes as “the taint of women’s presence” (624) had a long history with the story of what Venus did to Mars.\n\nWhat is especially striking about the Nullifcation Trial documents is that there contain several depositions in which male soldiers or officers insist that Joan’s presence in the camp does nothing of the sort.\n\nYou’ve already seen Alencon’s purported lack of desire, and there’s another soldier whose depositions says nearly the same thing. There are also three additional examples of soldiers indicating that they slept nearby to Joan in the camp, and in each case, they suggest her goodness essentially diffused any sexual desire they might have felt for her or for women at all. In the first few examples, the transcriber uses the same phrasing as in the previous two to remarks on the lack of “carnal feelings” they felt, which gives us the sense that it is surprising or contra to what they might feel naturally as young men; in the third, the absence of lust is “almost miraculous.”\n\nAs with Alencon’s protestations, these protestations make clear the degree to which Joan’s perceived goodness is connected to her chastity, but also that, beyond the protection afforded by her surcote and hose, her virginity itself is held up as the primary defender against its own violation. In these documents, men do not feel responsible for stifling any desire they feel; rather, they imply that a women who is endorsed by God will never provoke it.\n\nThese examples are also interesting in light of remarks we see in other depositions that reference Joan sleeping amongst women. In these, we must note the assumed heteronormativity in the notion that young women sleeping together is safe, appropriate, and asexual. I don’t bring these up to suggest such moments as coded versions of “No Dames” performed by an all-female cast; I show them because they are yet more examples that established the degree to which all concerned parties identify Joan as both a virgin and an active defender of chastity outside of marriage — including Joan herself. The fact that nobody even thinks to question what women might do when they sleep together, makes it especially clear that virginity for these people is less about the potential for sexual activity than about the need to define women’s value strictly in relation to men.\n\nAlong these lines, the aspects of sex that concern men in Joan’s trial are not rooted in identifying the act of intercourse as a sin so much as in talking about the act in ways that allow them to exert power over her fate. This assessment holds true whether we are looking at documents about Joan’s time in the camp and field, or in the courtroom, and regardless of whether the comments are made by her enemies or her allies.\n\nFor instance, take the two accounts about a visit from a doctor, Guillaume de la Chambre, when she falls ill during the trial. In the first deposition, we are told of a man who accompanies the doctor and his only role there seems to be to call Joan as a whore. We understand that Joan is not, in fact, a whore from the doctor himself, whose own deposition reads as follows:\n\n“On the contents of the 10th article, he declared that he had heard it said that Joan had been examined to know whether she was a virgin, and she was found to be [one]. The witness also knew, as he could certify according to medical science, that she was intact and a virgin, because he saw her almost naked when visiting her because of an illness; he felt her on the kidneys [in renibus] and as far as he could see, she was very narrow.”\n\nThe second deposition is a corrective of sorts. Yet it can hardly be read with a sigh of relief. First of all, we see the editor’s notes on De la Chambre that he had voted in favor of Joan’s sentence in the original trial, so what’s going on here is at least in part about resuscitating his own image and reputation. And of course, what’s also obvious from reading these two depositions together is that Joan can’t even be sick to her stomach without a man speculating about the state her hymen. The doctor’s deposition suggests his appraisal is based on what he feels and sees externally rather than a pelvic exam, but it also suggests she had already had one by that time. Incidentally, if you believe that “medical science” can detect whether somebody is “intact,” I urge you to watch this clip dispelling myths about the hymen from the show “Adam Ruins Everything.”\n\nAnd then there are the threats to the integrity of Joan’s body that are made outside of the medical establishment. For instance, on the battlefield one day, “a man who was on horseback said these words: ‘Is that there the Pucelle?’, swearing to God that if he spent a night with her, she would not leave as a Pucelle.” This taunting is boast and a threat, and precisely the scenario that Joan claims to fear when she is in captivity and no longer protected by armor. In fact, we can see more directly the extent to which her body is under siege while she’s held in the tower in the deposition of Aimon, Lord of Macy. He says that “he saw her many times in prison and spoke with her often. Many times too, in sport, he tried to touch her breasts, trying hard to put his hands on her bosom; but Joan was not prepared to put up with this, and pushed away the witness as hard as she could, because this Joan was of honest behaviour in words and deeds.”\n\nAs with the Duke of Alencon, we see in Macy an aristocrat who professes his own goodness in the process of emphasizing Joan’s: she pushes him away when he tries to touch her, suggesting that he has done everybody a favor in testing her virtue, since now he is able to confirm with evidence that she fiercely chaste. Of his own behavior as younger man of about 31, he assures us that his repeated attempts to grope a person 12 years his junior were only done “in sport,” and we are to infer from that description and the fact that she resisted his advances that no harm was done. If you’re tempted to say we should lighten up, accept jokes as simply jokes, well, that’s a position that people still take today. But the fact remains that there is a significant difference in status between the people who are privileged to be in a position to make this kind of joke and the people whose only viable move is — if they are conscious, that is — to endure or try to resist them. And we don’t get Joan’s account of this incident, of course, because by the time of the deposition, she had been dead for twenty-five years.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the same gendered ideas of what constitutes virtue ensure that, even in death, Joan’s body is the subject of intense scrutiny: according to a contemporaneous Chronicle’s description of her final days in the source book, the access Aimon sought in jest was ultimately granted to the masses:\n\n“…no sooner did she see herself like that than she fell again into her error just as before, calling for her male clothing. She was at once unanimously condemned to die and was tied to a stake which was on the platform (which was made of plaster) and the fire lit under her. She was soon dead and her clothes all burned. Then the fire was raked back, and her naked body was shown to all the people, with all the secrets that could or should belong to a woman, to remove any doubt from the people. When they had seen enough and looked as much as they liked at the dead body bound to the stake, the executioner started a great fire again round her poor carcass…”\n\nDespite the almost sympathetic reference to Joan’s “poor carcass” in this account, the writer seems to take a rather vengeful delight in reporting the public spectacle: her clothes, so important to her in life, are destroyed quickly, exposing the “secrets” of a naked, gendered body to “all the people” who can see and look “as much as they liked.”"
