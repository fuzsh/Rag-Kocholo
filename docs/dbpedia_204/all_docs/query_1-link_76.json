        "text": "I really started writing the story of the Sapphires when I was having conversations with mum, probably in I'd say 2000. I noticed that she would be mentioning Vietnam a lot. And I knew about it, of course, but I'd never really asked her about it. It occurred to me that there was a lot of history that I've been missing out on simply because I haven't been asking.\n\nTony Briggs\n\nWhat about your history?\n\nSometimes people don’t want to talk about the past, and it is important to respect that. However, often people are pleased to have the opportunity to share their stories.\n\nWhat are some of the memorable events that members of your family or some of your older friends have experienced in their lives?\n\nDo you think are stories you might be missing out on because you have not asked the right questions? Explain.\n\nHow might you go about finding out more about the experiences of people close to you? Why is this important?\n\nThink about and describe something you have done or experienced that has had a lasting impact. Explain why.\n\nFirst Nations history after colonisation\n\nThe story of The Sapphires is set in Cummeragunja, a mission settlement on the banks of the Murray. Cummeragunja plays an important but complex role in the cultural identity of the Yorta Yorta people.\n\nResearch the History of Cummeragunja. The Koori History website is a good place to start.\n\nWhy were the Yorta Yorta people moved to Cummeragunja?\n\nWhat are the details of the Cummeragunja Walkoff? Why is this considered such an important event in Aboriginal history in the post-colonisation period?\n\nFreedom ride\n\nEver since the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been engaged in a struggle to assert their rights to the land they inhabited for generations prior to European settlement.\n\nIn the 1960s Indigenous Australians connected with the African American civil rights movement in the United States and staged a freedom ride inspired by the Freedom Riders who travelled through US southern states to highlight ongoing issues of segregation and racist violence.\n\nFind out more about the Australian Freedom Ride. You might like to begin here.\n\nWhat were the significant events in the United States that inspired it?\n\nWhy did Indigenous Australians identify so deeply with the African American people, even though they have such a different history and experience? Which experiences did/do they share?\n\nCivil rights\n\nFind out more about Martin Luther King and his deep significance to the civil rights movement. The horror with which the news of his murder was met is portrayed with great impact in The Sapphires.\n\nWhy was the 1967 referendum such a significant moment in the long and continuing process of reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians?\n\nWhile the 1967 referendum did not give Aboriginal people the right to vote, this history of the Indigenous vote gives some useful contextual information.\n\nThe Stolen Generations\n\nThe real-life Sapphires have discussed the experience of having children removed from their family:\n\nThe Sapphires is a very rich narrative, featuring a number of characters, many different locations and a range of events and issues.\n\nMap the events that take place in the story, identifying the events that are purely to do with the personal stories of the fictional characters and those that are connected to actual historical events.\n\nChoose a scene that refers to an actual historical event (the Stolen Generations, racism in rural Australia, the Vietnam War) and explain how it connects with and adds to the main story of The Sapphires.\n\nNewsreel footage is used to communicate the layers of history behind the story of The Sapphires.\n\nWork together as a group to identify the source of each of these pieces of footage and their significance to the story being told.\n\nWhen watching The Sapphires, viewers need to process a lot of information very quickly without losing interest in the story. The filmmakers use our identification with the characters and their journey from innocence to experience to drive the story and our connection to it.\n\nWhat are some of the ways that we are encouraged to identify with the five main characters?\n\nMany stories focus on outsider characters, as there are few viewers who have not, at some time in their lives, felt like an outsider.\n\nExplain how each of the five characters is represented as an outsider.\n\nHow does this contribute to the way the story is told?\n\nIn The Sapphires, we are connected to all of the five main characters but we particularly identify with the character of Gail.\n\nWhat is Gail’s role in the story?\n\nDescribe Gail’s journey and what she learns. What do we learn from her experience?\n\nHow would you describe Gail’s relationship with the other characters?\n\nHow does this grow and change. Explain with reference to Dave, Kay, Cynthia and Julie.\n\nThe Sapphires ends as it began – in Cummeragunja. Many feature films use a process called bookending where the ending refers back to the beginning. This process is usually used to highlight the changes that have taken place in the characters’ lives and the knowledge they have gained and also the changes that have taken place in the viewers’ own understanding.\n\nWhy do storytellers often use the narrative device of the return home?\n\nHow effective is it as a conclusion to The Sapphires? What has changed? What has been learnt?\n\nWhat expectations are established in the beginning and resolved or remain unresolved at the end?\n\nWhich aspect of the complex story told in The Sapphires is highlighted in the film’s conclusion?\n\nHow successfully are the issues at stake resolved? How important is this resolution to the viewer’s experience of the film and their understanding of the message of the film?\n\nThe conclusion of The Sapphires not only offers a resolution to the suffering and misunderstanding of the past, but also looks to the future.\n\nHow does it do this?\n\nWhat feelings are evoked in the viewer in the concluding scene?\n\nWhy does director Wayne Blair choose to conclude the film with a musical number?\n\nWhy does music offer such an effective way of concluding a film?\n\nThe musical numbers are an important element of the film and are integral to our emotional connection to the characters and their story. The music also reveals important information about the story and the characters.\n\nThe first song we hear is Run through the Jungle. This song was released in 1970 by rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival. This song is considered to be written as a protest against the Vietnam War.\n\nDo you think it matters that it wasn’t written until two years after the events depicted in The Sapphires?\n\nDoes it matter that this song is a mainstream rock song written by a white American band?\n\nThe Sapphires is a ‘jukebox musical’ as it contains no original songs but instead employs well-known, classic songs to tell the story.\n\nWhat do these familiar songs add to the viewing experience?\n\nThe first diegetic song we hear is sung by Gail, Kay, Cynthia and Julie when they are children. They sing for their family and community. (Something is diegetic if it is part of the story. In contrast, Run through the Jungle is non-diegetic.) This song Ngarra Burra Ferra recurs in the story.\n\nWhen does Ngarra Burra Ferra recur?\n\nWhat is being communicated through this song at this point in the film?\n\nThere is a moment of peace and harmony when the sisters sing Yellow Bird with their mother.\n\nWhat are some of the things we learn in this scene?\n\nWhy does music and singing play such an important role in this family?\n\nThe first piece of advice Dave gives the Cummeragunja Songbirds is: Forget Country and Western music and concentrate on Soul. Soul is a style of music developed by African American people and is specifically connected to the experience and culture of these people.\n\nWhen the group prepares for their audition, he gives them a convincing reason for choosing to sing Soul rather than Country music. What does he say and how does what he says connect the struggle of Indigenous Australians with that of African Americans?\n\nIn the clip (below), you can find out about the history of Ngarra Burra Ferra and how it connects the Yorta Yorta people of Australia with African American culture.\n\nThe audience of The Sapphires is also drawn into the story through the use of humour. In particular, the three sisters are very funny, especially in their conversations with each other. Gail is particularly quick with verbal putdowns.\n\nIs it surprising that a story about racism, the breakup of families and war should also be very funny? Can you name other films that combine humour with darker themes?\n\nWhat is the role of humour in the story of The Sapphires?\n\nWhen Gail and Cynthia are trying to hitch a ride into town so they can participate in the talent contest, a car speeds past without stopping. Gail (correctly) attributes the snub to their skin colour but Cynthia counters: ‘No, it’s because you’re ugly.’\n\nWhy did the writers choose to introduce humour at this point?\n\nDoes the humour cancel out Gail’s comment and underplay the sisters’ experience of racism or has the point been made?\n\nFocus on some other moments when harsh realities are linked with humour.\n\nDescribe how this works and the effect of this tonal mix. (Tone communicates to the audience the appropriate response to what is happening in the narrative. Sometimes a film can make us uncomfortable as viewers because we are not sure about its tone and the response that is expected of us.)\n\nEach of the main characters, with the exception of Kay, is distinguished by a particular kind of comic behaviour or dialogue.\n\nExplain how this works with reference to each character.\n\nWhy is Kay portrayed as a more serious and less sassy character?\n\nWhat aspects of her experience might have contributed to her more restrained personality?\n\nAlternatively, what aspects of the three sisters’ experience might have led them to be more assertive and to present a tougher exterior to the outside world?\n\nWhen each of the five main characters (Gail, Cynthia, Julie, Kay and Dave) is introduced, we are immediately given an insight into the way they choose to present themselves to the world.\n\nHow is each character introduced?\n\nWhat do we learn about them?\n\nHow much does our initial impression of these characters change?\n\nDoes our understanding of some of the characters develop and grow more than others. Explain. Why might this be the case?\n\nWhat about representation of African American characters? Are they as developed as the other characters? What is their role? What is the effect of the scene after Martin Luther King’s death?\n\nCharacter mapping\n\nA character mapping exercise can help us dig deep into the character development process.\n\nDivide into groups with each group focusing on a particular character or character-grouping.\n\nConsider:\n\nAppearance/physical attributes: How is the character presented visually via facial look, body shape, costuming? What does it suggest about the character?\n\nDesign: How does the design of the character help to achieve believability? How does design encourage the audience to feel empathy for the character?\n\nVoice: How do the character’s words and voice (tone, infliction, and timbre) help to establish the character? What does it suggest about the character?\n\nAction: How do the character’s actions and behaviours help to establish the character? What other personal traits are evident? Describe the character’s motivations, fears and desires.\n\nRole: How does the character relate to the other main character or to other characters? What effects does the character’s behaviour have? Describe the character’s role in the overall storyline.\n\nFraming: Where is the character placed in the frame? What else is placed in the frame with the character? What shot types and angles are used?\n\nUse the character-mapping sheet to guide discussion and to take notes. (See downloadable pdf below)\n\nShare discoveries as a class. Discuss and debate the observations made and the conclusions drawn.\n\nAlthough the themes of war and racism are integral to the film narrative and the exploration of human relationships, The Sapphires places particular emphasis on personal and family relationships.\n\nWhat are the most important relationships in the film?\n\nHow do they contribute to the exploration of belonging and identity? (You may like to divide into groups with each group focusing on a different relationship and how it contributes to the themes of family and belonging.)\n\nHow is the community of Cummeragunja represented and how does it add to the theme?\n\nHow does Dave fit into this exploration of family and belonging? What is the point being made in the letter he writes proposing marriage to Gail?\n\nThe four young singers leave their homes and travel to a warzone.\n\nHow do they respond to their new environment?\n\nOften leaving home is experienced as a loss and there is no doubt the sisters miss their family in Cummeragunja, but it is clear that they gain more from their experience than they lose.\n\nWhat do they gain? Why? What does this new environment offer the young women that they have not previously experienced?\n\nThe singers are participating in a war being fought on someone else’s land. For the most part, the Vietnamese people and their plight remain in the background of the film. However, in an important scene in the film, a connection is made when Kay speaks Yorta-Yorta to ask the Vietnamese people who have stopped their car for permission to pass through their country.\n\nWhat kind of connection is being made between the Yorta Yorta and Vietnamese people in this scene?\n\nWhat aspects of Indigenous culture and custom is Kay drawing on at this moment?\n\nWhat do Kay’s actions communicate about her sense of identity and belonging?\n\nWhy is this moment important to rebuilding the relationship between Kay and Gail?\n\nThe Sapphires explores the growth in experience and confidence of the four young women that comes from escaping the limitations imposed by the racism of Australian society. But it also emphasises that this growth, their talent and their exuberant self-belief is rooted in the nurturing and rich cultural environment of their home on Cummeragunja mission.\n\nOne of the ways this is communicated is through the way each new performance is presented. The series of performances tell us about the changes taking place in the young women’s lives and each new performance is traced back to their earliest performances in front of family and community.\n\nThis picks up on the actual experience of Laurel Robinson:\n\nMy parents and aunties, uncle, grandmother were putting on concerts to raise money. It was just a simple thing - to raise money for - just for food to help the community and that's how we became singers. You can watch the rest of this interview here.\n\nNote down each performance – beginning with the little girls performing in 1958, moving onto the talent contest in the pub, the audition and then the appearances in Vietnam and the final concert back at home.\n\nWhat does this performance trajectory tell us about the singers’ growth from innocence to experience? What qualities did the group already have that laid the ground for their success?\n\nAn interesting exercise would be to capture a still image of each performance. As a class, consider how the mise-en-scène (everything you see in the frame) adds to your understanding of the group’s journey of discovery."
