        "text": "How do computers change the study of literature? How do images tell stories? How is writing evolving through photo essays, collages, and digital video? Students investigate these and related questions. Honors version available.\n\nThis first-year seminar emphasizes contemporary autobiographical writing by and about women. Students investigate questions of self and identity by reading and writing four genres of life writing: autobiography, autoethnography, biography, and personal essay. Both traditional written and new media composing formats will be practiced. Students may not receive credit for both ENGL 55H and ENGL 134H. Honors version available.\n\nCourse will examine the aesthetic and cultural functions and implications of textual images of photography and photographs in United States Latina/o short stories from the 1960s to the present. Honors version available.\n\nThis first year seminar will use literature, film, and popular culture to explore different expressions of masculinity and femininity in the African American and Black diasporic context. Students will evaluate how artists use gender and sexuality for social critique and artistic innovation.\n\nThis course will focus on issues of intellectual freedom and censorship, with particular attention to the ways in which these issues are racialized. Why do people ban books? What makes a book \"scandalous\" or \"immoral\"? Honors version available.\n\nWilliam Blake, the visionary poet, artist, and printmaker of the British Romantic period, has had enormous influence on modern art and popular culture. Using the Blake Archive, a hypertext of Blake's poetry and art, we will study key Blake works as well as the digital medium that enables us to study these works in new ways and performances and adaptations of them.\n\nThis course explores trends in online communication, emphasizing composition for the Web. The study of these writing activities is linked with a focus on innovation and on entrepreneurship.\n\nThis course examines the medieval concept of courtly love, or fin amour in a range of classical, medieval, and early modern texts. Questions that it might consider include the following: How does courtly love differ from modern visions of ideal love? Why is courtly love so often adulterous? And what is the relation of sex to love, in both the present and in the past?\n\nThis is a course about literature and war and what they might teach us about each other. Our work will be oriented around one central question: what, if anything, can a work of art help us see or understand about war that cannot be shown by other means? Students may not receive credit for both ENGL 73 and ENGL 161.\n\nIn this course, students will study epic and anti-epic strains in Western literature, reading key texts in the epic tradition from Homer and Virgil through the 20th century in light of various challenges to that tradition and tensions within it.\n\nThe aim of the course is to give beginning university students the requisite research skills to allow them to appreciate and to contribute to an understanding of the past by directly experiencing and interpreting records from the past. Students will actually get to work with historical documents, some more than 200 years old.\n\nThis seminar focuses on biography, specifically on persons and places in Chapel Hill. Students will engage in basic research to create a final project around a person or place of their choice from any field or profession. Students will design and produce the biography in any format, from print to digital.\n\nClass members will reflect upon Brontë's Jane Eyre (1847) in its original contexts and study subsequent novels and films that engage with it. What makes a literary work a \"classic\"? How do later readers' concerns affect their responses? Lovers of Jane Eyre are welcome, as are newcomers and skeptics.\n\nOur objective throughout will be to analyze how literary art simultaneously demonizes and celebrates the \"miracle of the marketplace\" and those financial pioneers that perform its magic. Honors version available.\n\nThis course will explore stories about the Japanese American internment from first person memoirs to contemporary fiction. We will also examine the ramifications, historic and legal, of the internment post-9/11.\n\nRequired for incoming students with SAT Evidence-Based Reading and Writing or ACT scores below a threshold set by the department. Please visit the department Web site for the most updated scores. The courses focuses on academic writing in a variety of contexts. Workshop format involves frequent writing and revision.\n\nThis college-level course focuses on written and oral argumentation, composition, research, information literacy, and rhetorical analysis. The course introduces students to the specific disciplinary contexts for written work and oral presentations required in college courses. Students may not receive credit for both ENGL 102 and ENGL 102I, 105, or 105I.\n\nThis college-level course focuses on written and oral argumentation, composition, research, information literacy, and rhetorical analysis. The course introduces students to one specific disciplinary context for written work and oral presentations required in college courses: natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, law, business, or medicine. Students may not receive credit for both ENGL 105 and ENGL 102, 102I, or 105I.\n\nThis course guides students slowly and carefully through one extraordinary long book that is well worth the time and effort. Texts vary year to year. Required text: one inexpensive book that you will never want to sell back.\n\nThis course introduces students to the new field of critical game studies, which uses rhetorical and literary theories to explore the impact that games have on our culture. Students will analyze the impact of immersive narratives on players and explore issues of representation and identity by playing through selected games and reading core texts. No gaming experience or equipment is needed.\n\nThis course uses a rhetorical approach to explore the concept of data. Questions of race, gender, class and other markers of identity will guide our analysis of how data is rhetorically used to shape knowledge in our contemporary world. This course is especially well suited for those in the WEDP concentration in English & Comparative Literature as well as those interested in fields such as data science, social media, technical communication, and digital humanities.\n\nA study of the development of English from its Proto-Indo-European origins to modern English, with emphasis on how events and contacts with other languages influenced the vocabulary of English. Course previously offered as ENGL 314.\n\nFulfills a major core requirement. This course examines how writing has evolved from ancient times to the present, with a focus on how writing technologies (from clay tablets to typewriters, pictographs to emojis) have shaped written languages and writing instruction. Activities will include making cylinder seals, writing with wax tablets, composing videos and comic books.\n\nIn this course, students will draw on classical rhetoric--the ancient art of persuasion--to analyze how people argue today, in online contexts. We will use rhetoric to examine the strategies internet trolls use, what makes a post go viral, and whether online arguments can actually change people's minds. We will also develop our own arguments in oral, written and digital formats.\n\nThis course examines video games as narrative texts through game play and game design. By the end of the semester, students will develop and create an original interactive narrative video game using the open-source software Twine. Through this making-centered course, students will study existing non-linear narratives to explore the basic principles of writing and examine the needs and expectations of the audience/viewer/player for immersive/interactive media and that of established media.\n\nToday, writers in almost every profession use visual evidence persuasively and effectively. How do we interpret and analyze those messages? How do we generate effective visuals that avoid misleading audiences? That is the domain of visual rhetoric, an area of study we will explore in this course. This course is useful for those planning careers in science, computer science, technical communication, business, and data science as well as those interested in cultural and historical aspects.\n\nIntended for sophomores and first-year students.
