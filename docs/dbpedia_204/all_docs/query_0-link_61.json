        "text": "Course Overview\n\nOn this exciting future focused programme, you will explore and develop the creative, technical, critical, and personal skills needed in the highly competitive and rapidly changing creative industries landscape. The course and study methods allow you to engage with the contemporary issues and modern practices, supported by input from local, regional, and national practitioners throughout the year. The course will allow you to develop strong creative and technical skills, alongside employability and academic skills, through a variety of exciting assignments and real design projects. This will include learning a range of digital design skills which will enhance your employability. The course delivery is constantly developing in line with changes within the Creative Industries and advances in digital technology and practice.\n\nWe offer pathways in Digital Media, Digital Graphics, Digital Photography, 3D Design Visualisation, Surface Pattern and Textiles, Concept Art for Games and Film, and Visual Effects for Film and Games. Some of the modules on this course will be studied collaboratively by students on all pathways, offering you opportunities for cross-disciplinary debate and shared experiences, whilst other modules will be specific to the specialist pathway you are studying. Whilst applicants will select their chosen pathway at the application stage, in the first Semester of Year 1 (September-February of the first year of the course) students will have exposure to all the pathways available. If, at the end of this, you wish to switch your specialist pathway then you will have the one-off opportunity to do this in the February of Year 1 of your course. After this point, you will remain fixed on your chosen specialist pathway for the remaining duration of the programme.\n\nThis course is available on a full-time and a part-time basis and is taught in-person at our Yeovil College campus.\n\nThe full-time course is studied over 2 academic years, and students are typically timetabled for two days per week. The part-time course is studied over 4 academic years, and students are typically timetabled for one day per week.\n\nWork Experience & Industry Placements\n\nYou will study Creative Industry Employability Skills and Professional Practice which will help you to develop your employability skills, and take part in work experience or work related activity (e.g. live briefs) within the Creative Industries during this programme.\n\nQualification Gained\n\nFoundation Degree Arts in Digital Design and Media Visual Effects for Film and Games, awarded by the University of Gloucestershire, and regulated by the Office for Students.\n\nAfter The Course\n\nUpon successful completion, students would be eligible to apply for further study, for example, a BA (Hons) top-up degree in Digital Design and Media. Alternatively, students could apply to find employment in the Creative Industry or start their own Creative Business.\n\nWhat Will I Learn\n\nYou will study a range of units that will develop your specialist knowledge and skills. Modules currently offered include:\n\nLevel 4 (Year 1 Full Time, and Years 1 & 2 for Part Time students)\n\nCommunication and Visual Culture (15 credits)\n\nCreative Visual Research (15 credits)\n\nExperimental Project 1 (30 credits)\n\nCreative Project 1 (Visual Effects for Film and Games) (30 credits)\n\nCreative Thinking (15 credits)\n\nCreative Industry Employability Skills (15 credits)\n\nLevel 5 (Year 2 Full Time and Years 3 & 4 for Part Time students)\n\nCreative Professional Practice (15 credits)\n\nCreative Enterprise (15 credits)\n\nExperimental Project 2 (Visual Effects for Film and Games) (30 credits)\n\nCreative Project 2 (Visual Effects for Film and Games) (30 credits)\n\nCreative Major Project Research (15 credits)\n\nCreative Curation (15 credits)\n\nAlongside developing a range of subject-specific skills, this course also gives you the opportunity to develop important transferable skills such as critical analysis, academic writing, time management, and communication.\n\nPlease be aware that modules studied may change periodically to reflect developments in the discipline, in response to student or stakeholder feedback, or as a result of regulatory body requirements. However, no significant changes to modules would be implemented without student consultation and feedback. Enrolled students can always find the most up-to-date information about their modules and who is teaching them in their course handbook.\n\nOur Lecturers\n\nThe course is taught by well qualified lecturers, practicing professionals, and technical demonstrators who are dedicated to ensuring student success through effective curriculum delivery and high-quality pastoral support.?The team includes staff with relevant academic qualifications and sector expertise.\n\nTeaching Learning and Assessment\n\nLearning will be achieved through a combination of class-based sessions, group activity, independent study, and a range of practical sessions in our state-of-the-art facilities. Students are encouraged to manage their own learning, apply their learning in real-world context, develop adaptability and skills for research. Critical thinking, creativity and employability are key drivers of the curriculum. You will develop your skills whilst working on exciting briefs.\n\nA typical week for a full-time student has around 9 hours of contact time in taught sessions, plus additional 1:1 support available by student request. As with all higher education programmes, students are required to take ownership of their learning and development, and should therefore expect to spend time studying with independence outside of lectures. Time spent studying independently may include reading journal articles and relevant books, undertaking research, and completing assignments by set deadlines.\n\nAs a rough guide, between timetabled sessions and independent work a student should expect to spend around 10 hours studying for each credit they undertake. A full-time student will typically undertake 120 credits per academic year, made up of a combination of 15 and 30 credit modules.\n\nPart-time students should expect to spend a proportionately reduced amount of time in taught sessions and undertaking independent work, in line with their intensity of study.\n\nTutorials\n\nThe Programme Leader is your Tutor. You will have regular one to one meetings with your Tutor to support you with your personal development planning.\n\nCourse Expenses\n\nTuition Fees: Full information on tuition fees, including tuition fee lists, can be found on our Financial Support page. Please be aware that fee levels vary depending upon the year in which a student commences their studies. For more detailed information, see the YCUC (Yeovil College University Centre) HE Fees Policy, available in the Policies and Reports area of our website.\n\nAdditional Costs: There are no required additional costs for the programme. Whilst some students may choose to buy their own device with Adobe software this is not essential. Our technical demonstrator team can provide guidance if you require support with purchasing equipment / materials / resources for the course. Throughout the course there are opportunities to undertake trips and visits to industry exposition events and trade shows. Whilst these are not mandatory, they will enrich the learning experience. Students would be expected to fund their own travel to and from such events.\n\nHow Will I Be Assessed\n\nAn assessment schedule, outlining all assessments and deadlines, will be issued to you at the start of each academic year. You will be assessed using a range of methods which will reflect the requirements of the subject, including practical projects, written essays, and presentations. The course provides you with opportunities to test your understanding of the subject informally before you complete the formal assessments that count towards your final mark. For each module you will receive ‘formative’ assessment and feedback from your tutor on the assignment you are working on. There is a formal or ‘summative’ assessment at the end of each module. The grades from formal assessments count towards your module mark. Feedback will be provided to you in writing, along with information reflecting your performance and recommendations for improvement.\n\nEntry Requirements\n\nEntry Requirements: Typical entry requirements are 48 UCAS tariff points.
