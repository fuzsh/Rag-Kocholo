That most difficult of feats is achieved by a prosecutor in this Darrow&Darrow film, Body Of Evidence. Conviction of Jordana Largy of the murder of her husband without a body. The DA did have the husband's blood on her clothes and on the boat that they were seen sailing out on.

However of all things a beat cop Michael Ainsley suspects something wrong and brings his doubts to the younger Darrow, Kimberly Williams-Paisley. She and her prosecutor adversary Tom Cavanaugh join forces to see if there's evidence enough to overturn her conviction.

That's usually the hardest thing to do because once that conviction is in the presumption of innocence is gone and the burden is on the defense.

I have to say I had part of it right, the rest was a bit of a shock. The two lawyers complement each other beautifully in performance. As for that officer, he's the kind that whatever police agency employs him he ought to have a quick mobile path up the promotion ladder but probably won't.
