The increasing importance of using movies to enhance second language teaching and learning has been addressed by researchers and educators. A few scholarly studies have effortlessly put forward significant findings on using movies in the area of theoretical bases, pedagogical aspects and learners’ perspectives. However, more studies need to be explored further as proposed by many scholars in their suggested future research. Hence, this study aims to investigate perceptions and experiences among university undergraduate students in exploring English language movies of their own choice for their oral commentary presentations. A corpus of English movies selected by students was used to assist students in their presentations. A total of 77 university undergraduates took part in the study. The data was collected through an online survey which consisted of a three-section questionnaire: demographic profile, learners’ perceptions and learners’ experiences. The data were analysed descriptively using SPSS version 20. The results revealed that using movies has helped students mainly, in improving their oral skills, vocabulary, interest and motivation as well as decreasing their anxiety and tension. This study adds to the body of knowledge and benefits educators and instructors on using movies for language teaching and learning. Keywords: Experiences, Language Learning, Movies, Perceptions

The study presents its investigation into the perception towards English films as the second language acquisition tool and the effects of exposure to English language through English films on the development of productive and receptive skills. It was undertaken since little has been done particularly in the local setting examining associations between the said variables. Undergraduate students from a public university in Selangor, Malaysia were randomly selected and surveyed for their viewes. Employing a quantitative approach, data was collected through an adapted online questionnaire measured by the Likert’s scale. The amassed data underwent analysis utilizing descriptive statistics and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. The findings demonstrated positive effects of the English language exposure through English films and a favorable correlation between the English language exposure via films and the improvement of language skills particularly listening and speaking skills. These results illuminate the crucial role that film-based exposure plays in augmenting second language acquisition. This study provides insights into the significance of incorporating film-watching outside the classroom activities to reinforce the development of receptive and productive skills and advances the use of diverse multimedia platforms to enhance language learning beyond the classroom exposure to enhance language learning.

The use of movies and TV series in the foreign language classroom has proved to be successful for multiple reasons, such as the development of various English language skills, the increased motivation and engagement of the students, the awareness of cultural diversity, as well as the decreased anxiety and stress levels. However, previous research in the field has primarily concentrated on the use of teacher-centered methods and approaches. The present research employs two documentary TV series on teaching ESP to first-year tertiary-level students to investigate the students’ feelings associated with the use of multimedia via two different perspectives: student-centered and teacher-centered. While the former method does not restrict the students with any requirements and allows for their creativity, the latter is fully directed by the teacher-instructor. On the completion of two sets of activities, the students are asked to reflect on their experiences with both teaching approaches by completing the surveys on Google Forms. The results of the research have suggested that the groups of students were satisfied with both sets of activities giving a slight preference to the student-centred one, which despite being time-consuming, was described as ‘interesting, motivating, and engaging’.

The article examines the influence of English movies, series, and cartoons on students majoring in English at a university in Bangladesh. The objective of this study was to ascertain the potential impact of films, series, and cartoons on the acquisition of the English language and to determine the extent of their influence. This quantitative research centered on the English department located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A set of questionnaires was employed to administer a series of inquiries to 140 students. The research uses both primary and secondary data sources. Primary data sources include surveys and interviews, while secondary data sources encompass journals, publications, previous research, and websites. This study has shown the significant impact exerted by English films, series, and cartoons on EFL learners. The development of English language proficiency – reading, speaking, listening, writing – was noticeably improved. It is found that watching English series, cartoons, and movies is a quick and effective way for EFL students to pick up the language. The approach functions as an audiolingual method, incorporating visual aids and facilitating situational language instruction. Moreover, the subtitles have been found to enhance both reading and writing abilities, as well as promote social interactions and foster a deeper understanding of the culture of native speakers. This research will also provide valuable insights for future scholars and researchers.

The global dominance of the English language has motivated individuals whose first language is not English to actively pursue fluency in English. For non-native speakers of English, acquiring the language is an intricate journey that demands substantial time and effort, accompanied by a range of challenges. In recent years, English movies have emerged as captivating tools for language learning, effectively aiding in enhancing vocabulary and essential language skills. These insights stem from past research that studied how non-native speakers learn English through movies. However, despite the valuable findings from these studies, there remains a discernible gap in our understanding of this field. In addressing this gap, the current study intended to investigate the perception and motivation of non-native speakers in learning English through movies. The study collected data by conducting surveys among non-native English speakers who were undergraduate students at a local public university. The findings revealed that these non-native speakers favour using movies as a method for learning English as a second language, and this medium enhances their motivation to learn. Building upon the existing foundation of research, this study significantly contributes to the body of knowledge by addressing the substantial research gap that exists in comprehending non-native speakers' perspectives on learning the English language through the medium of movies.
