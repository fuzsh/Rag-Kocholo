        "text": "When Dwight Howard started his first stint with the Los Angeles Lakers in the fall of 2012, many expected him to become the franchise’s next great center.\n\nInstead, he displayed a prima-donna, me-first attitude, and the team, which was considered a championship contender, got swept in the first round of the playoffs after a massively injury-riddled campaign.\n\nHoward returned to the Lakers in the summer of 2019, and many were skeptical that he would embrace a drastically reduced role.\n\nBut he did just that while helping the team win the NBA championship.\n\nAfter a year with the Philadelphia 76ers, Howard came back for a third stint with the Purple and Gold this season, and although he wasn’t quite what he was two years ago, he was still effective.\n\nDuring his exit interview, he seemed to imply that he would like to remain with the team next year.\n\nVia Silver Screen and Roll:\n\n“Do I want to come back? Why would I want to leave?” Howard said. “I want to be cemented somewhere. I love being here, I love the fans… I would just really like an opportunity to where I can really go out and go out with a bang. I’ve only got a couple years left, so I want an opportunity where I can go out and show my skills and talent and do it in the right way, but also win. I feel like I deserve that.”\n\nHoward may be 36 now, but he may still have value to bring the team for a little while longer."
