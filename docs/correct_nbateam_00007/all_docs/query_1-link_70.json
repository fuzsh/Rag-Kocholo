        "text": "The Grizzlies roster is one step closer to stability entering the 2019-20 season after Friday's news that Dwight Howard is expected to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nMultiple outlets reported Howard is expected to sign with the Lakers after clearing waivers following a buyout with the Grizzlies.\n\nThe Grizzlies acquired Howard, a 33-year-old center, in a July trade that sent C.J. Miles to Washington. Howard was set to earn $5.6 million this season before the buyout.\n\nHe will forfeit $2.6 million in his buyout agreement with the Grizzlies, according to ESPN and make that $2.6 million back in salary from the Lakers.\n\nThat will leave the Grizzlies on the hook for $3 million with Howard this season.\n\nThe move continues a trend of financially savvy operations for a revamped Grizzlies front office that drastically re-made the franchise's roster this off-season.\n\nBy trading Miles to the Wizards for Howard, the Grizzlies saved $3.1 million from their 2019-20 payroll. Miles is owed $8.7 million for the upcoming season.\n\nIn total, the Grizzlies have shaved $5.7 million on their 2019-20 payroll by trading for Howard and buying him out.\n\nThe Grizzlies never indicated that Howard factored into the team's plan for this season. By waiving him, the Grizzlies reduce their roster crunch by one. The team now has 17 players under contract, not including two-way players Yuta Watanabe and John Konchar.\n\nTeams are allowed a maximum of 15 non-two way players during the regular season, which means the Grizzlies will still have to reduce their current roster by two.\n\nVeteran wing Andre Iguodala remains a potential trade or buyout candidate, and third-year forward Ivan Rabb's contract has yet to become fully guaranteed.\n\nLIMITED TIME OFFERS: Get full access to the Commercial Appeal\n\nReach Grizzlies beat writer David Cobb at david.cobb@commercialappeal.com or on Twitter @DavidWCobb."
