        "text": "Free-agent center Dwight Howard has agreed to return to the Los Angeles Lakers, his agent told The Athletic.\n\nThis will be the third time Howard, 35, has played for the Lakers. He helped them win the title in 2019-20 as well as played for Los Angeles in 2012-13. Howard played for the Philadelphia 76ers last season, averaging seven points and 8.4 rebounds in a backup role behind Joel Embiid.\n\nLos Angeles also agreed to a one-year deal with guard Kent Bazemore, his agent told The Athletic. Bazemore, 32, averaged 7.2 points and shot 40.8 percent from 3-point range for the Golden State Warriors last season. He previously played 23 games for the Lakers in 2013-14.\n\nThe Lakers earlier agreed to one-year deals with Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington, both of whom also enter their second stint with the team.\n\n(Photo: Garrett Ellwood / NBAE via Getty Images)\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nHow Kent Bazemore fits with Lakers as they fill out their rotation\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nHow Trevor Ariza and Wayne Ellington fit with Lakers in their second stints\n\nHow Howard fits in Los Angeles\n\nBill Oram, Lakers beat writer: Even with the expectation that Anthony Davis will be willing to embrace a heavier workload at center to accommodate the arrival of Russell Westbrook, the Lakers were still seen as needing a center to start games next to Davis. That player needed to be a floor spacer in a way that last year’s solution in the middle, Andre Drummond, was not.\n\nNo, Howard is not going to step out and shoot 3s, but his ability to finish lobs and play above the rim helps open up opportunities for James and Westbrook on drives, which figures to be the greatest strength of this Lakers team.\n\nWhat will his 2021-22 impact be?\n\nOram: One needs to look no further than the Lakers’ 2020 title run to see how Howard can help this team — possibly with an even bigger role. He served as the backup for most of that season to JaVale McGee but showed his real value in the playoffs, both as an antagonist to Nikola Jokic in the Western Conference finals and taking over the starting role for the first five games of the NBA Finals.\n\nHoward’s tenacity as a backline defender made the Lakers one of the league’s top shot-blocking teams two years ago and should do so again.\n\nHow adding Howard impacts Marc Gasol\n\nOram: The obvious question Howard’s return introduces is what happens with Marc Gasol. A case could be made for Gasol to line up as a starter next to Davis as a floor-spacing center, with Howard off the bench as an enforcer, energy type. But with Davis expected to play way more regular-season minutes at center, as The Athletic’s Jovan Buha has reported, that just feels like too many cooks in the proverbial kitchen.\n\nThis feels more like a sign that the Lakers will find a way to move on from Gasol, who is on the books for $2.7 million next season.\n\nThe Lakers add another former Laker:"
