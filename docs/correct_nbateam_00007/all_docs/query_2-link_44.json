        "text": "Associated Press\n\nORLANDO - The number 12 is no longer sacred in Orlando.\n\nThe man who used to wear it, Los Angeles Lakers center Dwight Howard, also once shouldered the Magic's hopes of attaining an NBA championship.\n\nBut after eight years of chasing it, and taking Orlando through one of the most turbulent seasons in its history last year, the man who called himself Superman is now the city's biggest villain.\n\nHe returns for the first time Tuesday since his offseason trade to the Lakers to face the jilted fans, front office members and a handful of teammates he left behind.\n\nJameer Nelson, Hedo Turkoglu and Glen Davis are the only players on the Magic's roster who have previously played with Howard. Only Nelson will play in the rematch.\n\nThere will be a No. 12 on the Magic's sideline, though. Only it will be worn by one of the Magic's most recent acquisitions, forward Tobias Harris.\n\nFans once called Howard \"D-12,\" they now refer to Harris as \"T-12,\" a subtle dig to the star whose luster has faded in Florida.\n\nIf his contentious departure from Orlando didn't add enough heat, Howard tweaked many in Orlando last week when he referred to his former Magic team as \"full of people that nobody wanted\" during a television interview. He clarified later, saying he only meant they were underrated.\n\nHe went further Monday when he apologized for his part in last year's drama during an interview with USA Today, saying in part that he \"handled a lot of stuff the wrong way\" and got caught up in trying to please everyone."
