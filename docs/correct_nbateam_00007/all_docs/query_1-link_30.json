He looked at me crazy but one day is NOW!\" Howard wrote on Instagram.\n\nHe's trying to recruit other players to join him.\n\nHoward, 38, has played overseas since we last saw him in the NBA as part of the 2021-22 Lakers. The future Hall of Famer is not ready to give up playing hoop, at least not yet."
