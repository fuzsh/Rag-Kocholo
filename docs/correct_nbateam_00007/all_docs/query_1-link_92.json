        "text": "Eight-time NBA All-Star Dwight Howard will meet with the Golden State Warriors next week, league sources confirmed to The Athletic on Friday. Here’s what you need to know:\n\nThe Warriors have explored signing a veteran reserve big man and Howard will soon visit with Golden State team officials.\n\nHoward expressed to interested teams this offseason he is in shape and ready to contribute in any form for a franchise entering his 19th NBA season.\n\nThe 37-year-old last played in the NBA during the 2021-22 season with the Lakers, averaging 6.2 points and 5.9 rebounds per game. He spent last season playing in Taiwan.\n\nThe Athletic’s instant analysis:\n\nWhy bring in Howard?\n\nThe Warriors remain too short in the frontcourt within a conference Nikola Jokić currently rules. They have Kevon Looney as their sturdy starting center, Draymond Green as the perpetual small-ball turbo option and Dario Šarić giving them some useful frontcourt depth. But that still doesn’t feel like quite enough.\n\nThere are several people in the building who believe a true 7-footer who could bump around the interior, grab a few rebounds and commit a few fouls on certain nights and in certain matchups would really finalize the roster. Among the available veteran free-agent candidates, Howard has the most upside. — Slater\n\nWhat would be the hold-up?\n\nWould Howard enter the situation with the correct mindset? If he doesn’t play for two straight weeks, would he be fine with that? If they tell him to rebound and remain physical but never expect a play run in his direction, would he remain content?\n\nIs there any concern he’d become a distraction on the sideline or in the locker room for a franchise that is already attempting quite the chemistry experiment bringing Chris Paul into the mix? These are all questions Steve Kerr and Golden State’s other decision-makers will be in search of when meetings are expected to take place next week. — Slater\n\nAny other roster news?\n\nYes. Glad you asked. The Warriors have also agreed to bring Usman Garuba to training camp on one of their remaining two-way contracts, per league sources. Garuba is a former first-rounder with some defensive chops. He got caught in a numbers game with the Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder and remained one of the more intriguing younger options on the market.\n\nHe gives Golden State some extra frontcourt depth. They also have agreed to bring Donovan Williams to camp to compete for a roster spot. Williams, 21, is a young, long wing (6-foot-6, 7-foot wingspan) who played well in the G League last season and earned a two-way call-up to the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nHe impressed the Warriors recently in some scrimmages at their facility. — Slater\n\nBackstory\n\nHoward, a three-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year, showed he could be a reserve piece for a title team with the Lakers in 2020. Other veteran big men the Warriors have also been considered adding in recent weeks include Tony Bradley, Dewayne Dedmon and Derrick Favors, per league sources.\n\nRequired reading\n\nDwight Howard has the stats, accolades … and the haters\n\nEmbrace the Summer of Shai, but don’t forget about Grizzlies, Kings and the rest of the West\n\n(Photo: Brian Rothmuller / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)"
