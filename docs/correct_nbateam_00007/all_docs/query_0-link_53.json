        "text": "LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) â€” The Los Angeles Lakers have acquired Dwight Howard from the Orlando Magic in an off-season deal involving four teams.\n\nThe NBA has approved a blockbuster deal to send Andrew Bynum to the Philadelphia 76ers and bring Howard to the Lakers.\n\n\"We'd like to thank Andrew for all he's done for the team and the organization,\" Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak said. \"Andrew has been with us since we drafted him at seventeen years old and over the last seven years we have watched him develop into an All-Star player who has helped the team win two NBA Championships. He's a special talent with a bright future. We appreciate all of his contributions and wish him well for the remainder of his career.\"\n\nUnder the deal, the Denver Nuggets will acquire Andre Iguodala from the Philadelphia 76ers, as well as Jason Richardson from Orlando. The Magic will get Al Harrington and Arron Afflalo from Denver, as well as Nikola Vucevic and Moe Harkless from Philadelphia. The Lakers will receive Chris Duhon and Earl Clark from the Magic.\n\nThe Lakers, along with the Nuggets and the 76ers, will also send a protected first-round pick to the Magic.\n\nThe deal was apparently agreed to Thursday night, but general managers of all four teams had to get approval from the NBA during a conference call Friday morning.\n\nThe Lakers projected starting lineup for the 2012-2013 season includes Steve Nash, Kobe Bryant, Metta World Peace, Pau Gasol and Dwight Howard.\n\n\"The Lakers landed a piece that will hopefully carry the franchise long after I'm gone. I have spoken to Dwight Howard already and we are locked and loaded to bring back the title,\" Kobe Bryant said on his Facebook page Friday morning."
