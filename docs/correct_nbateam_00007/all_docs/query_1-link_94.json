        "text": "Howard has a number of NBA records, playing for a host of teams including the Orlando Magic, Houston Rockets, Atlanta Hawks, Charlotte Hornets, Washington Wizards, Philadelphia 76ers and Lakers. He was selected first overall by the Magic in the 2004 NBA Draft, and he was a three-time Defensive Player of the Year while with the Florida franchise.\n\nThe 36-year-old most recently signed a one-year contract with the Los Angles Lakers in 2021 but was without a team heading into the new NBA campaign, despite reported interest from the Golden State Warriors. As a result, he has decided to go to Taiwan to continue his professional career.\n\nThe Leopards are among six teams in the T-1 league, which features numerous players from the United States and Europe. Alongside baseball, basketball is the most popular sport in Taiwan, with both girls and boys high school championships broadcast island-wide.\n\nREAD MORE: Irving must complete six tasks before Nets will end suspension\n\nIn a post on social media, the center said: “It’s crazy how things play out because back in 2013 I told Taiwan that I would do my best to come back so that I can spread love & put smiles on peoples faces through basketball and now here I am writing this message to announce that I will be returning to Taiwan with the Taoyuan Leopards to play & give the people of Taiwan a chance to watch me play in real time.\n\n“I have always loved the energy I felt visiting Taiwan as you can see I still have posters hanging up on my walls from my first two times visiting! I’m ready to enjoy life by playing the sport I love in front of a bunch of people that love me & for my people in Taiwan have your posters ready to welcome yours truly.”\n\nHoward spent 18 seasons in the NBA and has has career averages of 15.7 points, 11.8 rebounds and 1.8 blocks. He was also selected for the All-NBA First Team in five years straight from 2008-2012 and had performed as well as any defensive big men in the league's history during his time with the Magic.\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nKyrie Irving gave ominous retirement prediction as NBA star suspended\n\nBrooklyn Nets suspend Kyrie Irving after star fails to apologise\n\nNBA star Josh Primo sued for alleged 'indecent exposure'"
