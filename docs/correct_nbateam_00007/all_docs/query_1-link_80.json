        "text": "The Lakers are stepping away from the panic button and are instead pumping the brakes after losing DeMarcus Cousins. Rather than rushing the next step, the Lakers will work out Dwight Howard and a couple of other old guys to fill in the sizable gap down low.\n\nESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Lakers will take a measured approach to fill the void they have at the center position.\n\nAccording to Wojnarowski, the Lakers will get a closer look at Howard, Joakim Noah and Marreese Speights at various workouts.\n\nSpeights last played in the NBA for the Orlando Magic during the 2017-2018 campaign, averaging 7.7 points, 2.6 rebounds and 13 minutes over 52 games.\n\nHead coach Frank Vogel witnessed the 32-year-old’s free-agent workout last month in Las Vegas, so perhaps that explains the interest in getting another look.\n\nNoah remains one of the more intriguing big men on the market, able to do the dirty work of grabbing boards and playing defense off the bench, which is exactly the kind of role player the team needs.\n\nLast season the 34-year-old played in 42 games for the Grizzlies, flashing 36-minute averages of 15.5 points and 12.4 boards.\n\nWhen Cousins, the Lakers x-factor, went down with an ACL injury the thought was that Los Angeles would grab the best big man available despite not wanting to waste their final roster spot.\n\nThe workouts would seem to echo what Ramona Shelburne previously stated; the Lakers were indeed looking at Howard but that it was only a matter of “due diligence” by the team.\n\nAs I explained recently, Howard is the most talented center available—although he will have to work out his departure from the Grizzlies first—with the obvious caveats of health and mindset.\n\nVarious NBA front offices might agree. HoopsHype recently asked a source referred to as an anonymous NBA exec about the Lakers and Howard.\n\n“Personal baggage aside, I would sign him,” they explained. “He’s clearly the best player available if he’s healthy. We’ve heard the same song from him for years [as far as changing]. But for the minimum? Why not? If it doesn’t work, they move on.”\n\nAnother source described as a league exec told the publication, “I think it’s worth the risk for them. If it doesn’t work out, they can cut bait.”\n\nThat fairly lukewarm sentiment is the best Howard is going to get at the moment.\n\nBrian Windhorst opined on ESPN, “I don't think it's a very likely marriage. I think the Lakers right now are doing their due diligence on players, on available centers.”\n\nWe will all have time to dissect what really amounts to the Lakers back-up center position. The fact that there is so much interest should really signal to you what time of year we are in on the NBA calendar.\n\nAccording to Shelburne, who offered up thoughts on Tuesday’s “The Jump,” it will be sometime before we have any closure on the next Laker big man.\n\n“I actually think they are going to take their time with this one,” Shelburne said. “They (Lakers) don’t have to do anything.”\n\nShe went on to reference Andre Iguodala, another player itching to be bought out by the Memphis Grizzlies and get consideration for the Lakers' final roster spot. His potential availability means the Lakers are patient buyers.\n\nThat patience is also due to the current state of centers in the league. The NBA is smaller, quicker and more apt to shoot from distance.\n\nOlder models of center just aren’t in demand right now, which is why the Lakers really don’t have to make a decision immediately but can instead sit and contemplate about which over-the-hill center they want on their roster.\n\nSo, it would be nice fodder to have the Lakers make an August signing. But, more than likely, it will be closer to training camp before we know which big man the Lakers like or if they are even determined to sign one.\n\nThere is still a small chance that Iguodala becomes available and/or the Lakers decide to play Anthony Davis at the five despite his wishes.\n\nThe Lakers don't have a lot of pressure on them at the moment in this regard. So while it looks as though Howard has an amazing opportunity, he actually has just one thing, and that's a lot of time to convince the Lakers that he is a completely changed man.\n\nHoward is battling an evolving Lakers strategy, centers who are proven role players and, most importantly, himself.\n\nIt's going to be tough for Howard to get that Hollywood ending."
