If this is the end of Beverley's NBA career, it ends a 12-year run in the league that began in 2012. Before debuting in the NBA, Beverley spent multiple seasons in the EuroLeague after being a second round NBA Draft pick in 2009. Beverley reportedly had offers in the NBA for the veteran minimum, but chose to take a contract in Israel where he will get a lot more playing time.\n\nFastbreak\n\nNBA Legend Dwight Howard Reveals Who His Favorite Player Was\n\nDwight Howard was once among the best 10 players in the NBA. The former superstar most recently played in the league during the 2021-22 season when he was in his third stint with the Los Angeles Lakers. That year, Howard averaged 6.2 points and 5.9 rebounds per contest while shooting 61.2% from the field in 60 games.
