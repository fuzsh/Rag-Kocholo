        "text": "Charles Rex Arbogast/Associated Press\n\nFollowing a successful season with the Philadelphia 76ers, Dwight Howard is on the move again after agreeing to a deal with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nPer Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium, Howard will be rejoining the Lakers for the third time in his career, on a one-year contract.\n\nAfter winning an NBA title with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019-20, Howard initiallytweeted at the start of free agency that he would be returning to them. He later deleted the tweet and signed a one-year deal to join the 76ers as Joel Embiid's backup.\n\n\"I was never offered a deal from the Lakers,\" Howardtold reporters about the situation. \"Once Philly called and I talked to Doc [Rivers], he already told me he wanted me on the team.\"\n\nHoward had a solid season primarily coming off the bench for head coach Rivers. The eight-time All-Star averaged 7.0 points, 8.4 rebounds and shot 58.7 percent from the field in 69 appearances. He's still a solid rim defender and helped the Sixers finishsecond in the NBA in defensive rating (102.6).\n\nPhiladelphia thrived in Rivers' first season as head coach. The team had the best record in the Eastern Conference during the regular season (49-23) for the first time since 2000-01. Their playoff run ended sooner than expected, with a second-round loss to the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nHoward was an essential role player who eased the burden on Embiid when he needed to rest.\n\nThe Lakers will be looking to Howard for some scoring off the bench and his usual strong defense at the basket as they pursue a playoff berth in 2021-22."
