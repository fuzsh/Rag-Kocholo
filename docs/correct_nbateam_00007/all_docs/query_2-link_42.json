        "text": "The most prized free agent in the NBA is being offered up the world. Well, that and a whole lot of chicken fingers. Dwight Howard’s choices this summer are between five teams—the Los Angeles Lakers, Houston Rockets, Dallas Mavericks, Golden State Warriors and Atlanta Hawks—and two of those are offering him television opportunities (with the Lakers even asking their A-List celebrity fans to beg the big fella to stay). Per ESPN: “According to a source familiar with Dwight’s meeting with Houston, the Rockets discussed TV opportunities for DH on Comcast SportsNet Houston […] There had already been preliminary talks between Dwight Howard and Time Warner on a show if he returned to the Lakers … TWC is desperate for original programming as it is and if giving Dwight his own show helps the Lakers it’s a win-win.”"
