His brief stint playing on the Taiwan Beer Leopards in the Taiwanese professional basketball league is now over and will soon be playing for Mets de Guaynabo in Puerto Rico.\n\nHoward, 38, and the Puerto Rican team shared clips of his arrival to the island via social media on Friday. He will now be closer to the NBA, but only distance-wise.\n\nThe big man does not have the skillset necessary to play as a center in today's league that hugely prefers shooters over bruisers.\n\nHoward was a key contributor in the Lakers' championship run in the 2020 bubble, but did not improve his game thereafter.\n\nDwight Howard sexual assault allegations\n\nThe big man might also be shunned from the NBA because of recent allegations against him by a man who claims sexual assault.\n\nHoward denied all sexual assault allegations, but confirmed he did contact the man with the intention of having sex."
