        "text": "Pro basketball players expect jeers when they step to the free-throw line during road games, but what Dwight Howard heard in Orlando early in the first quarter on Nov. 9, 2018, deviated from the norm.\n\n“Dwight Howard, shooting two,” the public-address announcer bellowed.\n\nA mixture of boos and stray catcalls followed from the crowd of 13,204 people inside Amway Center.\n\nFlicking his right wrist, Howard launched his first foul shot. The ball rattled around the rim and bounced outside the cylinder. When the ball fell into the hands of an Orlando Magic player, not touching the parquet court, fans cheered, seemingly taking extra joy in a visiting player’s miss.\n\n“Howard sucks!” a fan sitting behind the baseline yelled. “Get a haircut!”\n\nThe reception for Howard becomes a little less nasty each time he returns to Orlando to play against his former team. But even now, seven years after one of the ugliest divorces between a superstar and a franchise in NBA history, many Magic fans still hold a grudge against Howard, the player they once adored.\n\n“He gets booed the whole time,” said Dennis Salvagio, a longtime Magic fan known affectionately as “The Fat Guy.”\n\n“Other people who left the team (and) they’re on other teams? They don’t get booed. They get applause. But him? Every time he touched the ball, he got booed — and pretty badly booed. So the fans don’t like him, and I don’t think they forgave them. And I think most people feel like they would never take him back. I feel that way.”\n\nOn Wednesday night, the Magic will host the Los Angeles Lakers, and Howard will play his first game in Orlando in 13 months. He is a role player now, counted on to provide defense and rebounding off the bench for one of the NBA’s best teams. These days, he casts a low profile compared to superstar teammates LeBron James and Anthony Davis.\n\nBut in Orlando, Howard never will be just another player. In his eight seasons with the Magic, he made six consecutive Eastern Conference All-Star teams, won three straight NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards and led the team to the 2009 NBA Finals. No player in franchise history has scored more points, collected more rebounds or blocked more shots than Howard did.\n\nAnd with the exception of Shaquille O’Neal, who left the team in 1996 to join the Lakers as a free agent, no player broke more Magic fans’ hearts than Howard did.\n\nIn December 2011, after an NBA lockout, Howard informed team officials he wanted a trade. The next nine months were the most tumultuous in franchise history, marked by the revelation that Howard had wanted the team to fire popular coach Stan Van Gundy, the team’s desperate efforts to convince Howard to rescind his trade demand and inaccurate rumors that Howard was overstating the severity of a back injury.\n\nThe saga became known as “The Dwightmare,” and after the 2011-12 season ended, the team fired Van Gundy and parted ways with general manager Otis Smith. In August 2012, the Magic traded Howard to the Lakers in a four-team deal.\n\nLast November, just before he played for the Washington Wizards against the Magic, Howard was asked whether he senses Orlandoans’ anger toward him dissipating with each passing year.\n\n“Sometimes,” Howard answered. “I know that a lot of people have hard times forgetting or forgiving people. So I get it. And I hear it all the time: ‘You should have never left,’ and all this stuff. But if I would’ve never left, I wouldn’t be the person I am today. Of course, we had some great times here. But as far as me as a person, just going through all the things I went through has made me a better and stronger person. So I’m thankful for the stuff that I went through when I was here. It was great for me.”\n\nStill, Howard’s image has never recovered from his messy exit and all it entailed.\n\nOn Amway Center’s terrace level, an exhibit detailing the team’s 31-year history features a framed Howard No. 12 jersey and photos of him from the Smith/Van Gundy era, including a photo of Howard holding the 2009 Eastern Conference championship trophy aloft.\n\nBut on the arena’s ground floor, where fans dine in exclusive lounges, there are few, if any, pictures of Howard. Framed drawings by artist Tom Mosser of Smith, Nick Anderson, Glen “Big Baby” Davis, Rashard Lewis, Bo Outlaw, J.J. Redick and Jason Richardson line the walls between a VIP entrance to the building and an entrance to the Magic’s practice court.\n\nThere is no drawing of Howard.\n\nIn a corridor outside the Magic locker room, photos of past Magic players alternate with photos of current Magic players. Those photos include action shots of Mo Bamba, O’Neal, Outlaw, Evan Fournier, Penny Hardaway, Tracy McGrady, Grant Hill, Horace Grant, Darrell Armstrong, Nikola Vucevic, Jameer Nelson, Anderson, Jonathan Isaac and Hedo Turkoglu.\n\nThere is no photo of Howard, at least not there.\n\nAn exception hangs from the wall near a door to the players’ in-arena parking lot. It is a wide-angle, overhead action shot of the tipoff of the 2012 NBA All-Star Game in Orlando. Howard stands in the center circle for the opening jump ball.\n\nWhen asked why artwork of Howard is largely absent from the ground floor walls, Magic CEO Alex Martins said Howard’s status as an active player for another team “plays most into that decision.”\n\n“I think you’ll find that over time that players who haven’t appeared in places like that tend to reappear once their career comes to an end,” Martins added. “I would use Shaq as an example. I believe that over time that (Howard’s case) will change as well.”\n\nIt should be noted, however, that Redick remains an active NBA player, and yet Mosser’s drawing of Redick still hangs in a hallway.\n\nIn recent years, franchise officials have renewed ties to O’Neal, Hardaway and McGrady. All three have been inducted into the Magic Hall of Fame.\n\nDon Miller, who has hosted a radio show in Orlando for many years, has seen Magic fans’ attitudes toward O’Neal come full circle — seesawing from love to anger and back toward love again. Miller also watched the Dwightmare unfold, and he said Magic fans still haven’t forgiven Howard.\n\n“There was a time when they were pretty upset with Shaquille as well,” Miller said, “and Shaquille really endeared himself through just the things he’s done, and he still has a relationship with this community. Dwight never did anything to change that. And many Magic fans saw, and still see, Dwight Howard as someone who became arrogant and really full of himself during the exit.”\n\nOn Nov. 9, 2018, on the same night Howard played for the Wizards against the Magic, team officials honored Lewis as part of the franchise’s 30th-anniversary celebration that season. The public-address announcer introduced Lewis during an on-court ceremony between quarters, and Lewis received warm applause.\n\nThat night, Lewis was asked whether he hopes fans eventually will welcome back Howard.\n\n“Of course,” Lewis responded. “There are a lot of people that didn’t agree with the way he left the city of Orlando. I didn’t agree with it. Nobody really did. But at the same time, he became a free agent, and he decided to do something different. There’s a lot of players that did it. Kevin Durant did it. LeBron James did it. So you can’t fault him for doing that. Regardless of him leaving or me being traded and the things that went on, he will forever be a friend of mine because we’ve got great memories here.”\n\nAsked what it will take for Howard to be embraced in Orlando again, Lewis said it would help if the team starts to win big again and returns to the NBA Finals.\n\nBut a return to the league’s upper echelon seems years away. The Magic have not had a superstar on their roster since they traded Howard. Last spring, the Magic reached the playoffs for the first time since the 2011-12 season, Howard’s last season with the team. In some ways, the franchise still has not recovered from the Dwightmare.\n\nThirteen months ago, Howard was asked if he can envision a scenario, say, in 2038 or 2039, in conjunction with the team’s 50th-anniversary season, when the team honors him between quarters of a game in Orlando, like Lewis.\n\nHoward said he would welcome that opportunity.\n\n“Hopefully, people will get over it by then,” Howard said. “But I’m just always thankful for the opportunity that I had, just grateful. I always express my gratitude to people no matter how they would feel about me. … Hopefully one day my jersey will be up there (hanging from the Amway Center rafters), and people will say, ‘Dwight Howard did a lot of great things for our city and our team.’ And all will be forgiven.”\n\n(Top photo of Dwight Howard: Jayne Kamin-Oncea / USA Today)"
