        "text": "Dwight Howard wants to play in the NBA again. The eight-time All-Star told Zion Olojede of Complex that he can “provide a team with 25 minutes of dominant basketball.”\n\n“I know I can provide a team with 25 minutes of dominant basketball,” Howard said. “And that’s not even scoring, that’s just playing defense, locking people up, protecting the paint, rebounding, and finishing around the basket. I’ve had my fun in the game. I just want to go out like a champ like I’m supposed to.”\n\nHoward didn’t play in the NBA last season. He was playing professional basketball in Taiwan. The three-time Defensive Player believes he can help the Miami Heat, Sacramento Kings, Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors and Atlanta Hawks.\n\n“Okay, you got Miami Heat,” Howard said. “You got obviously, the Lakers. The Warriors. The Kings. But the Kings, I would say the Kings got a couple centers so they probably wouldn’t. But the Kings. The Hawks. I’m from Atlanta, go back home with the Hawks.”\n\nHoward has career averages of 15.7 points, 11.8 rebounds and 1.8 blocks with the Orlando Magic, Lakers, Houston Rockets, Hawks, Charlotte Hornets, Washington Wizards and Philadelphia 76ers. He is 37 years old and still in great shape.\n\nHoward played for the Lakers in 2021-22. He averaged 6.2 points and 5.9 rebounds while shooting 61.2% from the field. No team offered Howard an NBA contract this year, so he took his talents to Taiwan.\n\nNBA NEWS & RUMORS: Dwight Howard Updates\n\nIt will be fascinating to see if Howard is back in the NBA next season. The future Hall of Famer is seriously open to going back to the Lakers.\n\n“It’s been crazy,” Howard said. “It’s been crazy, but it’s just for some reason we just clicked. I don’t know, you could have a little girlfriend or whatever and it’s just, y’all done been together, y’all done broke up. You done tried other girlfriends but it’s just some type of connection y’all got.\n\n“That’s how we feel about the Lakers. Man, it’s just something that we got this connection. I don’t know. It got to work. It got to work. But I do love the Lakers, man. We had the championship run there and I wish we would’ve had a chance to keep going because that was the squad right there. We had everything. We had everything.”"
