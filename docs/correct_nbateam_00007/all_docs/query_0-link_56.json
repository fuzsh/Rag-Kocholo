        "text": "The disappointing 2012-13 Lakers season came to a very fitting end Sunday night at Staples Center. In the third quarter of what ended up being a 103-82 loss in Game 4 against the San Antonio Spurs, All-Star center Dwight Howard was ejected after picking up a technical foul for arguing, ending his first and possibly last season with Los Angeles. Minutes after Howard's ejection, fans at Staples Center cheered and applauded for the final time of the season as injured guard Kobe Bryant emerged from the locker room on crutches to witness the ignoble end of a Lakers season that once seemed so promising.\n\nIt was fitting that Bryant made his appearance only after Howard was out of the game. When Bryant's season ended with an Achilles tendon injury two weeks before the start of the NBA Playoffs, Dwight Howard had the opportunity to use the team's postseason to prove that he could lead the team. Howard, working with an injured and depleted supporting cast, could not even win a single game against the San Antonio Spurs, who handed the team its worst home playoff loss in franchise history along the way. When the officiating crew ejected Howard, who was well aware that another technical foul would lead to his ejection, it almost felt as if he were relieved to be out of the game.\n\nIn contrast, Bryant had been playing 40+ minutes a game down the stretch before his season-ending injury, a setback that left him emotionally devastated. So, there was some amount of symbolism in the Lakers season ending with a healthy Howard essentially checking out of the game and an injured Kobe Bryant, still recovering from surgery, reemerging to play the role of a captain going down with his ship. Kobe seemed to be sending a message, emphasizing that even though he couldn't play, this was still his team. (The wiseacres on Twitter suggested an alternate theory: Bryant just didn't want to be stuck in the locker room with Howard for the rest of the game and, quite frankly, who could blame him?)\n\nIt was a rough end for the Lakers, as not even the Tracy McGrady First Round Elimination Curse could prevent the San Antonio Spurs from not only beating, but sweeping the Lakers. Maybe it was a bad omen for Los Angeles to hand out white towels to the fans in the stands. As Yahoo! Sports' Dan Devine notes, this gave Lakers fans the chance to pull off a rare visual mixed metaphor combining \"throwing in the towel\" and \"waving a white flag\". It ended up being a prescient move: the game got out of reach early as the Lakers scored just four points in the game's first five minutes and were already down 18 points by halftime.\n\nNot to put the Lakers' showing all on Dwight Howard, in his defense the Lakers season basically ended once the team lost Bryant for the season, something Spurs' head coach Gregg Popovich acknowledged after his team's victory:\n\nObviously, it wasn't a fair fight. When you're a competitor, you want to compete on an even basis, and the Lakers weren't able to do that.\n\nWith both Steve Nash and Metta World Peace unavailable, the situation forced head coach Mike D'Antoni to start players such as Darius Morris and Andrew Goudelock in an elimination game. If the series had gone any longer they may have had to start pulling fans from the stands just to avoid an automatic forfeit. In some ways the Spurs' sweep of the Lakers felt like an act of mercy, much like that scene in every zombie movie where the heroes are forced to kill an infected, undead thing that once was a loved one. Lakers fans can take solace in the fact that the Spurs really didn't blow out the Lakers, they merely put an end to a hobbled, lurching mockery of what their team was supposed to be.\n\nThis Lakers team was supposed to be great, maybe even historically so. Lakers fans had every reason to be optimistic coming into this season, as the Lakers had traded for two Hall of Famers in Howard and point guard Steve Nash to go along with All-Stars Pau Gasol and Metta World Peace. The idea was to surround the aging Bryant with proven superstars and aim for another championship or two before the window for winning with Bryant closed. Instead, the \"new look Lakers\" stumbled out of the gate, causing a panicked front office to fire head coach Mike Brown after just five games, replacing him with Mike D'Antoni, Nash's old coach with the Phoenix Suns. While some believe that the Lakers' season was lost when the front office hired D'Antoni over legendary Lakers coach Phil Jackson, the truth is that no coach could have done much with this injury riddled and clearly dysfunctional group. Instead of easily winning the Western Conference, which seemed like a very real possibility during the preseason, the Lakers didn't clinch a postseason berth until the last day of the season, and by then the team was too depleted and tired to be much of a threat.\n\nIt was a difficult season for the Lakers, but the real challenges might lie ahead. The franchise faces an uncertain future, especially now that Jim Buss has fully replaced his late father, longtime Lakers owner Jerry Buss, as the head of basketball operations. Buss the Younger will have plenty to deal with during this offseason, most notably Dwight Howard's impending free agency. Reports indicate that Howard is willing to listen to other teams' offers and considering how difficult this year has been for him, Howard could very well have already played his last game in the purple-and-gold. Kobe Bryant will most likely return when he is healthy, unless one believes that this Lakers organization would risk the backlash involved in amnestying him, but nobody knows when that will be. Early reports suggest that the earliest he could be back on the court would be halfway through next season, and it's entirely possible that he might miss an entire year. Then there's the inevitable changes in the supporting cast that nearly every team makes every offseason, or the possibility of trading, say, a Pau Gasol. There are no indications that Mike D'Antoni's job is in jeopardy, but after seeing how quickly the Lakers organization jettisoned his predecessor, he can't feel too secure either.\n\nThe only thing certain about next year's Lakers team is that they will look quite different than this year's model, if only because Kobe's absence will force them into finding a new identity. Considering how this season played out, that might not be an entirely bad thing. The Bryant/Howard/Nash experiment - the on-paper superteam that was supposed to bring the team closer to another title - may end up as just a best-forgotten footnote in Lakers history."
