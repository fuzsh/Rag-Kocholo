        "text": "Dwight Howard, the 38-year-old former NBA player, last graced the league in the spring of 2022 as a member of the LA Lakers.\n\nFollowing the Lakers' decision not to extend his contract, Howard ventured to Taiwan, where he currently finds himself as a free agent, seeking another shot at the NBA.\n\nDespite an attempt to rejoin the league last summer, including a workout with the Golden State Warriors, Howard did not secure a contract offer. Undeterred, he remains optimistic about his future in the league. On his 38th birthday, December 8, Howard took to social media to hint at a potential return:\n\n\"I turned 38 today and I thought about it lol...I'm not retiring before I have the chance to say I played in an in-season tournament game lol,\" wrote Dwight Howard on X.\n\nInterestingly, Howard's former team, the LA Lakers, and the Indiana Pacers are set to clash in the Championship Game of the NBA In-Season Tournament in Las Vegas, providing a unique backdrop to Howard's aspirations.\n\nWould an NBA team take Howard in 2024?\n\nWhile he actively pursues an NBA return, Howard is also exploring overseas opportunities. During the summer, he reportedly considered a move to Europe and the EuroLeague. Additionally, talks with the National Basketball League (NBL) in Australia have unfolded, as revealed by David Stevenson, the NBL CEO.\n\n\"We've been having lots of conversations with Dwight over an extended period of time. He's seen value in the strength of the league and he still has aspirations to get back into the NBA; he's playing overseas at the moment,\" Stevenson declared.\n\nStevenson emphasized the attractiveness of the NBL as a strong league and a viable pathway to the NBA, citing the growing interest from ex-NBA players to participate.\n\nDwight Howard's NBA journey began in 2004 as the No.1 pick, spending the initial eight years with the Orlando Magic, where he reached the NBA Finals in 2009.\n\nSince departing in 2012, he played for six different teams, including three stints with the Lakers, clinching the championship in the Orlando Bubble in 2020. Despite his travels, Howard has expressed a desire to return to the Magic and conclude his career in Orlando."
