        "text": "Two years after the national Dwightmare began, it has finally come to an end.\n\nHoward agreed to join the Rockets yesterday, capping a two-year process that saw him hold several teams hostage while he repeatedly waffled in his decision-making.\n\nAfter the news was initially reported by USA Today, Howard later changed his Twitter avatar to a painting of him in a Rockets uniform and put out a tweet making the decision official.\n\n“I’ve decided to become a member of the Houston Rockets,” Howard said in the tweet. “I feel it’s the best place for me and I am really excited about joining the Rockets and I’m looking forward to a great season. I want to thank the fans in Los Angeles and wish them the best.”\n\nHoward’s decision to join the Rockets, spurning the Lakers — who he played for last year after being acquired in a four-team trade with the Magic last summer — and rejecting overtures from the Mavericks, Warriors and Hawks, means he will play alongside budding superstar guard James Harden in Houston, immediately transforming the Rockets into one of the league’s elite teams.\n\nHoward’s decision to leave the Lakers — and leave a fifth year and an extra $30 million guaranteed on the table — is a crushing blow for the franchise, which had acquired him last summer in the hopes of making him the foundation of the next era in the team’s illustrious history with Kobe Bryant nearing the end of his career.\n\nNow, however, it remains to be seen if the Lakers can even be competitive for a playoff spot in the loaded Western Conference next season, especially with Bryant still recovering from a torn Achilles tendon he suffered just before the end of the regular season. The best course for the Lakers may be to sacrifice next season and try to finish as high in the loaded 2014 Draft Lottery as possible before entering next summer with plenty of money to spend. That would allow them to chase potential free agents LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony and Dwyane Wade.\n\nThis also marks the second straight summer the Mavericks have struck out on landing a marquee free agent to pair with aging superstar Dirk Nowitzki. The Mavs missed out on Dallas native Deron Williams — who re-signed with the Nets last July — and now Howard. Those disappointments followed owner Mark Cuban willingly blowing up the 2011 title team to maintain future salary cap flexibility.\n\nAfter the Mavericks were informed of Howard’s decision, Cuban tweeted, “Time to get back to work. The Mavs are back open for business.” He later proved that was the case when Dallas agreed to a four-year, $29 million deal with free agent point guard Jose Calderon.\n\nThough the Warriors came up short in the Howard sweepstakes, it was far from a bad day for them after they agreed to a four-year, $48 million deal with versatile swingman Andre Iguodala. One of the league’s best wing defenders and a capable ball handler, Iguodala averaged 13.0 points, 5.4 assists and 5.3 rebounds for the Nuggets last season.\n\nThe move leaves Golden State with the potential for a devastating small-ball lineup of Iguodala, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes and Andrew Bogut, in addition to David Lee, after making it to the Western Conference Semifinals last season.\n\nIn order to free up the cap room to sign Iguodala, Golden State sent Richard Jefferson, Brandon Rush and Andris Biedrins to Utah — all were in the final year of their contract and will be paid roughly $25 million next season — along with 2014 and 2017 first-round picks in exchange for the unguaranteed contract of guard Kevin Murphy.\n\nThe Hawks made two signings after the Howard news became official, coming to agreements with power forward Paul Millsap and small forward DeMarre Carroll — both of whom played for the Jazz last season.\n\n* In other signings, Matt Barnes returned to the Clippers, agreeing to a three-year deal for $11 million, and O.J. Mayo agreed to a three-year deal worth $24 million to go to Milwaukee and play for the Bucks.\n\nIn other signings yesterday, Matt Barnes returned to the Clippers, agreeing to a three-year deal for $11 million, while O.J. Mayo agreed to a three-year deal worth $24 million with the Bucks."
