        "text": "The Lakers originally acquired Howard as part of a four-team swap in the 2012 offseason, one month after trading for Phoenix Suns superstar Steve Nash. Pairing the duo with Kobe Bryant led to high expectations. A 2012 Sports Illustrated cover featured Howard and Nash. “Now this is going to be fun,” it read.\n\nLos Angeles didn’t have as much fun as it planned that season. The team finished seventh in the Western Conference with a 45-37 record and was swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the playoffs.\n\n“It was tough,” Howard said at the time. “I enjoyed, for the most part, living here in L.A. I just really think the timing in L.A., it wasn’t right for me. Maybe two years ago, or 2-3 years from now, it would have been the right time. But I just think right now the timing was off for me. That’s not saying that L.A. is a bad place, but I just think it’s all about timing and fit when you’re talking about basketball. You can put anybody together on the court and expect them to win, but the pieces have to really fit in order for a team to be successful and it was very, very tough, man. It’s probably one of the toughest decisions I’ve ever had to make in my life.”\n\nHoward has a tendency to arrive to new teams amid pleasantries and positivity but leave under different circumstances. Los Angeles will be Howard’s seventh team since the beginning of 2016, though he didn’t appear in games for all those franchises. Howard left the Houston Rockets that offseason to join the Atlanta Hawks. The Hawks traded him the next offseason to the Charlotte Hornets, who then shipped him to the Brooklyn Nets last summer. He was promptly waived and then signed with the Wizards.\n\nHoward visited with the team a day before his scheduled workout and met with former USA Basketball teammate Jason Kidd, who is now an assistant coach for the Lakers, along with Davis, Rajon Rondo and JaVale McGee. The meeting was productive, and Howard persuaded his old team to give him another chance."
