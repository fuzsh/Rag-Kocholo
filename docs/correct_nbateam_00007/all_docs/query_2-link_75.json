        "text": "Earlier this week, there was some speculation that Howard may be ready for a return to his hometown and play for the Atlanta Hawks. According to rantsports.com, \"(Howard) developed into one of the best high school players in recent memory at Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, where he averaged 25 points, 18 rebounds, 8 blocks and 3.5 assists and led the team to the Class A state championship during his senior season. Howard was named Georgiaâ€™s Mr. Basketball in 2004, and he still spends some time in Atlanta during the off-season and his foundation occasionally holds events in the region.\"\n\nIt now looks like that Atlanta is not in the running to acquire Dwight Howard and pending approval from the NBA, the former Southwest Atlanta star will be a Los Angeles Laker."
