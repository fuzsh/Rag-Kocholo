        "text": "In addition to Howard moving to the L.A., the Nuggets will receive Andre Iguodala and the 76ers will receive Andrew Bynum, both of whom were 2012 All-Stars.\n\nThe 76ers will also receive 11-year veteran Jason Richardson, and the Magic will receive three players (Arron Afflalo, Al Harrington, Nikola Vucevic) as well as three first-round picks, one from each of the other teams in the deal.\n\nBut of course, the only name that really matters is Howard, who has long wanted out of Orlando and finally gets his wish. However, Howard's first choice was the Brooklyn Nets, so now we have to wait until next off-season to see if Howard re-signs with the Lakers or bolts for the Big Apple."
