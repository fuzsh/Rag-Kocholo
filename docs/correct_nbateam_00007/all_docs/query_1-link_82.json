        "text": "Former NBA All-Star Dwight Howard is eyeing a return to the NBA after a year away playing in Taiwan.\n\nAnd he knows just where he wants to go in search of an NBA title at this point.\n\n“I’m not retired from the NBA just yet,” the 37-year-old told The Sacramento Observer. “I would love to help the Sacramento Kings contend for a title. Even though I believe their team is pretty much set.”\n\nHoward, the three-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year, last played in the NBA in 2022 for the Los Angeles Lakers, averaging six points and six rebounds per game off the bench.\n\nThe Lakers missed the postseason, and the veteran big man was released with no interest from the other teams.\n\nNot ready to call it quits, Howard found a new basketball home with the Taoyuan Leopards in the T1 league in Taiwan, flourishing with averages of 23 points, 16 rebounds and a block per game.\n\nHe also was named an All-Star and won MVP honors of the event, becoming a popular face of the league — he even starred in some truly bizarre commercials and claimed, “I don’t want to speak English.”\n\nEven with all the fun he’s having in Taiwan, Howard is looking to add another chapter to his NBA story, and he seems to believe he’s a fit in Sacramento.\n\nOn paper, the fit isn’t terrible.\n\nWhen last seen, the Kings were being decimated on the boards by Kevon Looney and the Golden State Warriors during the first round of the NBA playoffs.\n\nHoward’s presence would add another big body down low to help with rebounding especially when their All-Star Forward is resting.\n\nPlus, with all the talented bigs in the league, it wouldn’t hurt to have a number of guys to throw on the floor.\n\nDespite the impressive numbers with the T1 Leopards, it remains to be seen whether Howard’s interest will be reciprocated by the NBA."
