        "text": "Everybody has a favorite player they like to idolize when playing the game of basketball. Even utilizing different facets of their game and incorporating it into their own is a form of flattery now-a-days.\n\nFor Dwight Howard, that man was San Antonio Spurs icon Tim Duncan.\n\nOn ESPN’s “The Jump”, Howard goes into detail about why he decided to wear the number twelve jersey his whole career.\n\n“Half of the reason I wear No. 12 is because I wanted to be the reverse of Tim Duncan.\"\n\nOne of the most comedic and upbeat personalities in the NBA, Howard definitely hit the nail on the head there in comparison to Duncan’s quiet-like nature.\n\nHoward has been known to take control of the spotlight when it comes to the media with his flamboyant and outgoing personality. We saw how much he dominated headlines during the twilight years of his Orland Magic days and the drama that ensued on his way to both the Los Angeles Lakers and the Houston Rockets.\n\nDuncan on the other hand wasn’t a fan of being in the limelight when clearly, he was the best player on the very same team that drafted him for almost two decades.\n\nIn terms of overall accolades, both big men went on to earn All-Rookie honors and made numerous appearances on the All-Defensive and All-Star teams.\n\nBut the giant disparity between these two are the number of championships each have.\n\nDuncan finished his career with a hand-full of championship rings, whereas Howard only got a taste of the trophy in his lone Finals appearance when he lost to Kobe Bryant and the Lakers in 2009.\n\nThough Duncan is without a doubt a first ballot Hall of Fame selection when the time comes, it still remains to be seen whether or not Howard will be joining his reverse doppelganger.\n\nBut at least Howard gave Duncan a good laugh during their playing days."
