        "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers suffered a tough defeat at the hands of the Denver Nuggets despite leading by as much as 11 points during the first half. The team needs to change something to ease the burden on LeBron James and Anthony Davis and win a series that sees them as overwhelming underdogs.\n\nHowever, this realization doesn’t stop people from trolling the Purple and Gold for blowing a first-half lead and failing to regain any control of the game. Due to the Lakers’ star power and reputation make it easy to see why fans are laying it on thick.\n\nOne of the people who had a hilarious take on the Lakers is one of the players who helped the team win their 2020 title in the NBA bubble.\n\nDwight Howard makes a funny joke as the Los Angeles Lakers struggle against the Denver Nuggets\n\nHoward, who has spent two stints with the Los Angeles Lakers and is currently playing basketball out of the country, posted a photoshopped picture of himself wearing the Lakers jersey with a Superman cape behind him.\n\nFans were quick to point out that the photoshop wasn’t necessary as there are plenty of images online showing him wearing the iconic Lakers jersey:\n\nIt’s quite clear that the Lakers need help with their big-man rotation as they struggle to contain the Nuggets down low. Anthony Davis was the only Laker with double-digit rebounds as they lost in total boards, 40 to 49.\n\nMoreover, the Lakers couldn’t contain Nikola Jokic from doing whatever he wanted on the floor. He finished the game with 32 points, 12 boards, seven assists, and two steals. While Anthony Davis swore to get even on Jokic, the rest of the Lakers’ frontcourt also need to stop Aaron Gordon and Michael Porter Jr. from scoring.\n\nIt’s going to be a tough series for the Los Angeles Lakers, and it might reach a point where they might actually need a player of Howard’s caliber to shore up the defense. Hopefully, Darvin Ham finds the right adjustments to make the series more winnable for the Purple and Gold.\n\nFor More Content"
