        "text": "It’s over! Dwight Howard is officially a Laker—or at least will be after a call is made to the league office Friday morning. As part of the deal, Andrew Bynum is headed to Philadelphia, with multiple pieces from the Lakers, Magic, 76ers and Nuggets moving around. More details, via ESPN: “A four-team trade that would send Dwight Howard to the Los Angeles Lakers is complete, multiple sources told ESPN on Thursday night. A source with direct knowledge of the talks told ESPN.com’s Marc Stein the Lakers will receive Howard, the Denver Nuggets will acquire Andre Iguodala, the 76ers will receive Andrew Bynumand Jason Richardson, and the Magic will get Arron Afflalo, Al Harrington, Nikola Vucevic and one protected future first-round pick from each of the other three teams. In addition, the Magic will be getting other pieces, including 76ers No. 1 draft pick Moe Harkless, a source told Stein. Sources close to the process told Stein and ESPNLosAngeles.com’s Ramona Shelburne that a trade call with the league office has been scheduled for Friday to secure the necessary NBA approval to make the deal official. Lakers forward Pau Gasol had been in and out of talks, sources told Shelburne. Earlier Thursday, Yahoo! Sports, citing sources, reported that talks of a four-team trade involving Howard have taken place this week and have ‘grown serious.'”"
