        "text": "Originally published by LakersNation.com\n\nOne of the biggest turnaround stories in recent years for the Los Angeles Lakers was that of big man Dwight Howard. After one failed season with the franchise in 2013, Howard returned to the Lakers and was a huge part of the team’s run to the 2020 NBA Championship.\n\nHoward would spend one more season with the Lakers in 2022, but hasn’t been in the NBA since. The center spent last season in Taiwan but has not retired from basketball and is still eyeing a return to the league. And now the big man has taken his next step towards showing he still has something to offer a team.\n\nAccording to Shams Charania of The Athletic, Howard has signed a deal to play for Strong Group, a Philippines team, in the Dubai International Basketball Championship taking place later this month:\n\nIn the midst of pursuing an NBA comeback, Dwight Howard plans to sign a deal to play for the Philippines team Strong Group, in the two week Dubai International Basketball Championship in January sources tell me. The eight-time All-Star and three-time Defensive Player of the Year continues his basketball career with this deal, allowing him to stay in shape and visit a foreign market to play globally after spending last season in Taiwan, and working out with the Warriors before training camp this year.\n\nAs Charania noted, Howard is still looking to return to the NBA and this tournament could be an excellent showcase for him to show teams he can still contribute. There is always a spot in the league for a big, physical center like Howard and some teams will surely be keeping an eye on how he does. Perhaps even the Lakers themselves.\n\nThere is no doubt that the team ha a need for another big who is more physically imposing. There is a lot of pressure on Anthony Davis right now and while Christian Wood and Jaxson Hayes bring some things to the table, they aren’t physically strong enough to handle some of the more bruising bigs in the NBA.\n\nHoward is still keeping his basketball career going and this move will keep him ready in case the Lakers, or any other NBA team comes calling.\n\nLakers coach Darvin Ham believes Anthony Davis’ defensive impact not appreciated enough\n\nDespite so much pressure being on him, Davis has been delivering for the Lakers on both ends of the floor. While his offense has been getting praise as of late, it is his defense that has been on point all year long and head coach Darvin Ham doesn’t believe that is getting enough credit.\n\nHam recently spoke about this, noting that Davis has been elite defensively and feels his impact is not getting appreciated enough in the basketball world. Ham would add that the Lakers’ defense would be nothing if not for the efforts of Davis.\n\nHave you subscribed to our YouTube channel?
