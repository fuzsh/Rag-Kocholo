        "text": "Prologue\n\n“[T]he cause of such mighty changes in the world’s history as we may perhaps never realize.”\n\nThe most notorious and consequential crime in American history happened just eight blocks from where I sit, in the heart of the nation’s capital.\n\nAn attempt on the President’s life was hardly unforeseeable. Abraham Lincoln had been living in the shadow of such threats for more than four years, ever since the final leg of his train journey from Illinois to Washington in February 1861 was scheduled for the dead of night so as to avoid assassins thought to be lying in wait in Baltimore. Even so, the assassination in Ford’s Theatre, on Good Friday 1865, stunned the nation, both because of its timing and its circumstance.\n\nGeneral Grant had taken Richmond a fortnight earlier, and it had been only five days since General Lee had surrendered on behalf of the Army of Northern Virginia at the McLean residence in Appomattox Court House. Finally, thankfully, the elusive peace was at hand. Lincoln himself, the previous month, set the tone for the imminent recon­ciliation: In a succinct, solemn inaugural address, marked by a surprising equanimity, the President recognized that the warring sides were bound together by a shared fate according to God’s unknowable design. Without invoking a word of triumph, let alone retribution, he famously declared that the time had come to “bind up the nation’s wounds,” “[w]ith malice toward none; with charity for all.” Lincoln thereby began to mark the path to repair and reconciliation in the wake of the acute enmity that had torn the nation apart.\n\nAnd so it was that on Thursday evening, April 13, just before the start of the Easter weekend, the District of Columbia was in a state of almost mystical reverie and wonder:\n\nThe very heavens seemed to have come down, and the stars twinkled in a sort of faded way, as if the solar system was out of order, and earth had become the great luminary. Everybody illuminated. Every flag was flung out, windows were gay with many devices, and gorgeous lanterns danced on their ropes along the walls in a fantastic way, as if the fairies were holding holiday inside.\n\nHow incongruous it was, then, that the devastating blow should be drawn the next day, at that very moment of collective relief following years of dread and unimaginable bloodshed—just as it appeared that the nation was emerging from the abyss. “Where, half an hour before, the faces of wayfarers [on the streets of Washington] had reflected joy over thoughts of Appomattox, the fall of Richmond and the surrender of Johnston, now all was blanched horror . . . .”\n\nWhat made the murder even more shocking was that the blow arrived not from what remained of the Confederate Army, in a theater of war, but instead under the most banal of circumstances, in a theater of a much more ordinary kind, and at the hand of a common actor, not yet twenty-seven years of age. While no one was paying him any mind, John Wilkes Booth crept from behind the President, brandishing a tiny pistol to terrifying effect—the fatal shot timed to coincide with the audience’s predictable reaction to the play’s surest laugh-line.\n\nThe derringer that John Wilkes Booth used to kill Abraham Lincoln (Source: Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, photograph by Carol M. Highsmith, LC-DIG-highsm-04710).\n\nFew could have imagined, on that peaceful spring evening, that a “little black mass no bigger than the end of [a] finger—dull, motionless and harmless [might be] the cause of such mighty changes in the world’s history as we may perhaps never realize.”\n\nAs dramatic and consequential as the assassination may have been, however, it was also—both in form and as a matter of law—a standard-issue homicide, of the sort the criminal justice system routinely handled. In the ordinary course, then, those suspected of the crime would have been tried before a local jury, for violations of criminal law offenses, in a building less than five blocks from Ford’s Theatre: the magisterial Old City Hall at 5th and E Streets NW, which housed the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, a federal court established pursuant to Article III of the Constitution. Such a federal criminal trial for an attack on a President would not have been unprecedented. Thirty years earlier, Old City Hall had been the site of the trial of Richard Lawrence, who had attempted to assassinate President Andrew Jackson as he emerged from the Capitol Rotunda. In the days immediately following Lincoln’s tragic death, there was every reason to assume that the same courthouse would once again host such a trial, before pro-Union Article III judges of the D.C. Supreme Court whom President Lincoln himself had handpicked when that court was established to replace the old Circuit Court of the District of Columbia.\n\nYet instead of seeking criminal court indictments against those thought to be responsible for Lincoln’s killing, the nascent Johnson Administration turned its sights two miles southward, to a thin peninsula bisecting the Potomac River (into what are today separately designated as the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers). At the tip of that peninsula, Greenleaf Point, lay the old, underutilized United States Arsenal, which had once been a federal penitentiary. The Administration chose that imposing, nondescript building as the site of a most extraordinary, unorthodox adjudicatory proceeding, one that raised fundamental constitutional questions concerning the proper balance between civil and military authorities.\n\nThere would be no trial of the assassin himself, for John Wilkes Booth was already dead—killed in a standoff with the Union Army at Garrett’s Farm in Virginia, twelve days after he murdered the President. The next day, April 27, 1865, Booth’s body was brought to the Arsenal in the dead of night and ignominiously buried beneath a storage room, where it would remain until transferred to the Booth family plot in Baltimore four years later. Nor could the government try John Surratt, probably Booth’s most trusted confidant in the plot, for Surratt had fled to Canada, and from there to England and then Italy, where he served with the papal Zouaves. Within two weeks of the crime, however, eight other suspected confederates of Booth and Surratt were arrested and placed in military custody—some in the Old Capitol Prison in the District of Columbia (at First and A Streets NE), others on two ironclad ships, the U.S.S. Montauk and the U.S.S. Saugus, anchored in the Washington Navy Yard in the District. On April 30, the Army transferred the alleged accomplices to an area of the Arsenal penitentiary that had been closed for years, where they were detained in squalid conditions, most of them forced to wear stifling canvas hoods.\n\nThe next day, May 1, 1865, President Johnson signed an order authorizing trial of the alleged accomplices in a makeshift military com­mission. Commission proceedings commenced on May 9, less than four weeks after the shooting, and trial began in earnest on May 12, after the accused were afforded an opportunity to secure counsel. The eight individuals who appeared before the military commission were a motley collection of secondary figures, with a variety of actual or alleged con­nections to the crime:\n\nLewis Powell (alias Paine or Payne) brutally attacked Secretary of State William Henry Seward at the same hour that Booth shot Lincoln.\n\nGeorge Atzerodt was assigned by Booth to kill Vice President Johnson, but for reasons that remain unknown—probably some combination of fear, conscience, and alcohol—he did not make an attempt on Johnson’s life.\n\nDavid Herold was Booth’s aide, with whom he rendezvoused in his flight from the capital; Herold surrendered to the Army troops at Garrett’s Farm, where Booth was killed, on April 26.\n\nSamuel Arnold and Michael O’Laughlen had furtively plotted with Booth several months earlier to kidnap (not kill) the President and take Lincoln to Richmond, where the President was to be used as leverage to secure a prisoner exchange. The plotters abandoned that absurd idea some weeks later, and Arnold and (most likely) O’Laughlen had nothing more to do with the events of April 14.\n\nEdman Spangler, a stagehand at Ford’s Theatre, held Booth’s horse in an alley while the actor was inside the theater, without knowledge of what Booth was up to.\n\nMary Surratt, John’s mother, owned a boardinghouse on H Street in Washington where the conspirators met and plotted (and where the Wok ‘n’ Roll restaurant now sits), as well as a tavern in Surrattsville (now Clinton), Maryland, where Booth and Herold stopped on their flight from Washington. Surratt likely knew that something nefarious was afoot, although to this day it is uncertain whether she was aware of the details.\n\nFinally, Samuel Mudd was a Charles County, Maryland, physician, former slave owner, and staunch Confederate supporter, who had had several previous, suspicious dealings with Booth and Surratt. Booth and Herold stopped at Mudd’s farm on the night of their escape, where Mudd set Booth’s broken leg and offered the two men food and shelter for the night. He also showed them a little-known swamp route that would lead them to the Potomac so that they could cross into Virginia. (It is vigorously disputed, to this day, whether and to what extent Mudd knew what Booth had done earlier on Friday evening.)\n\nThe building on H Street, between 6th and 7th Streets NW, that once was the Surratt boardinghouse where Booth and his con­federates plotted (Source: Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, LC-DIG-cwpbh-03432).\n\nThe tribunal that stood in judgment of these eight individuals bore little resemblance to the D.C. Supreme Court two miles to the north. It was a makeshift court, convened in an ersatz courtroom, measuring approximately forty feet by twenty-seven feet, on the third floor of the Arsenal. Most importantly, the entity that would resolve the fate of the accused was entirely the creation of, and was administered by, the War Department. There was no judge. A panel of nine military officers, most of whom had no legal training, served as “members” of the commis­sion. They were detailed to the court by another military officer, Assistant Adjutant-General W.A. Nichols, who presumably acted with input from, and probably at the direction of, the Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and/or the esteemed Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt.\n\nSecretary Stanton himself helped draft the single, elaborate charge against the defendants. Judge Advocate General Holt also drafted and preferred the charge, prosecuted the case, and effectively controlled the trial, assisted by two Assistant Judge Advocates, Representative John Bingham and Brevet Colonel Henry Burnett. The commission itself nominally decided legal ques­tions that arose at trial, following confidential deliberations in which the members were advised by none other than Holt, Bingham, and Burnett—that is, by the prosecutors themselves. This was, in other words, an executive proceeding, through and through—indeed, one in which military officers played all the governmental roles and in which there was scant separation between the prosecution and the finders of fact. Holt “had great latitude for shaping events in the courtroom to suit his own vision of justice, which was hardly distinguishable at this point from revenge.”\n\nThe military commission and prosecutors for the Lincoln assassin­ation trial.

Burnett, and Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt (Source: Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, Civil War Photographs, LC-DIG-ppmsca-35257).\n\nOn June 30, after more than seven weeks of trial and testimony of more than 300 witnesses, the commission found all eight defendants guilty of at least some involvement in the events of April 14. The commission recom­mended that three of the defendants—Arnold, O’Laughlen, and Mudd—be sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor; that Spangler serve a term of six years at hard labor; and that the other four be executed.\n\nOne week later, after President Johnson approved the verdicts, four of the defendants—Powell, Atzerodt, Herold, and Surratt—were hanged on a gallows built just outside the Arsenal courthouse. Today, a desultory tennis court occupies the site of the hanging; a stock “places of interest” marker is the only reminder of the drama that occurred there.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Lincoln assassination has spawned a veritable library of writings over the past 150 years. Indeed, an actual Lincoln assassination library, the James O. Hall Research Center, sits a few miles from the scene of the crime, adjacent to the Surratt House Museum in Clinton, Maryland—what Sarah Vowell has aptly dubbed the “Vatican of the Lincoln assas­sination subculture.” As with most great crimes, this one has engen­dered countless theses, controversies, and conspiracy theories, sustaining what one might fairly call “Lincoln assassination studies.” The majority of accounts have been written by amateur sleuths and obsessives who have devoted a remarkable part of their lives, and their energies, to the subject. Having spent some time poring over the materials at the museum and paid my nominal dues, I, too, am now a card-carrying member of the Surratt Society, which collects much of its revenue by hosting regular, twelve-hour-long John Wilkes Booth Escape Route tours. Every month, I receive “The Surratt Courier,” a newsletter chock-full of new discoveries, revelations, artifacts, and fighting words.\n\nOf course, just as the assassination literature itself is only a sliver of the much larger corpus of Lincoln scholarship, so, too, only a small percentage of the assassination literature concerns the trial of the conspirators. Even so, that relatively modest slice amounts to several heavily weighted shelves of books and other materials. Most of those sources offer detailed accounts (with varying degrees of accuracy) of the trial itself. Many overflow with seemingly endless debates about the guilt or innocence of the defendants—especially of Samuel Mudd, the Charles County, Maryland, physician and slave owner who set Booth’s broken leg and allowed Booth and Herold to sleep at his house several hours after the assassination, and of Mary Surratt, the owner of the boardinghouse where the conspirators plotted.\n\nOther accounts of the trial focus on the many significant short­comings of the military proceedings, including:\n\nThat the defendants were detained in horrifying conditions, first on the ironclad ships and then at the Arsenal—especially the requirements that most of them spend virtually all their waking hours, day after day, wearing heavy canvas hoods that made breathing and sight quite difficult, and that some of them be chained in excruciating iron ankle and wrist restraints.\n\nThat at the outset of trial the defendants were paraded before the commission “with black linen masks covering all their faces except tip of nose & mouth, heavily chained & each led staggering & clanking in, by his keeper. It was a horrid sight.”\n\nThat the charges against the defendants were of extraordinary breadth and vagueness—Chief Justice Rehnquist would later describe them as, “To put it mildly, . . . ambitious.”\n\nThat the accused were not offered counsel until after they were arraigned before the commission, and for some only the day before testimony began, with no time to prepare for trial or challenge the inclusion of the members of the commission (some of whom had possible conflicts).\n\nThat prosecutor Holt chose to convene the proceedings in secret (a decision he promptly reversed when it became a public embarrassment).\n\nThat at least one of the commission members, Thomas Harris, who would later write a volume accusing the Catholic Church of responsibility for the assassination, tried (unsuc­cessfully) to deny Mary Surratt the services of the esteemed Maryland Senator Reverdy Johnson, a former Attorney General, as her counsel, by accusing Johnson of disloyalty to the Union.\n\nThat the prosecution unduly influenced the commission members, particularly on matters of law.\n\nThat a substantial portion of the trial was devoted to testimony about alleged plots against the President by Confederate agents in Canada—what one of the defense counsel called a “wild jungle of testimony.”\n\nThat the three principal witnesses who testified about supposed connections between the Canadian operation and Booth were revealed to be perjurers at best, if not outright charlatans.\n\nThat the prosecution produced almost no evidence that the eight accused themselves were even aware of any connec­tion between Booth and the unindicted coconspirators in Canada.\n\nThat the prosecution failed to produce Booth’s diary—a document that (according to some) might have helped support the defense allegations that the conspiracy, if any, was merely to kidnap Lincoln and that Booth had decided to kill Lincoln only at the eleventh hour, without the knowledge of at least half of the defendants.\n\nThat the evidentiary rulings were, by most accounts, imbal­anced in the prosecution’s favor.\n\nThat—as in all military tribunals during the war—a finding of guilt required only a majority vote of the panel, and that the reviewing authority (in this case, the President, who convened the commission) retained the ultimate authority over the judgments and sentences, without the prospect of any review by a federal court (other than perhaps on habeas—but, as we shall see in the case of Mary Surratt, President Johnson cut off that prospect of review, too).\n\nThat, after the trial, Holt might have deliberately failed to present President Johnson with a petition signed by five of the nine commission members, asking the President to commute Mary Surratt’s sentence to life in prison.\n\nMany of these problems and irregularities were the direct result of Johnson’s decision to convene a military commission. It is hard to imagine most of them occurring, at least not to the same degree, if the conspirators had been tried before a civilian jury in the D.C. Supreme Court, with an Article III judge presiding.\n\nNevertheless, this Article does not focus upon, or attempt to adjudicate disputes concerning, this familiar array of controversies attending the Lincoln commission, for several reasons. For one thing, there’s not much more to add: Those issues have been dissected and debated, in sometimes excruciating detail, for several generations. Moreover, there is a rough consensus about the inadequacies of the Lincoln commission itself. To be sure, many disputes among the self-appointed Lincoln assassination “experts” continue to fester on partic­ular points of contention, especially with regard to the culpability of Mudd and Surratt. Yet even those who defend the verdicts typically concede that the commission proceedings were shot through with structural, procedural, and evidentiary flaws. In the century and a half since it was convened, virtually no one, no matter how sympathetic to Johnson, Stanton, and Holt, has looked to the Lincoln assassination commission as a model of procedural justice. Few, if any, trials in American history better illustrate the quip often attributed to Clemenceau: “La justice militaire est a la justice ce que la musique militaire est à la musique.” (“Military Justice is to justice what military music is to music.” ) As Justice Robert Jackson would later write, reflecting the consensus view, “The performance of this Military Commission was hardly an edifying example of the judicial process.”\n\nMore importantly, most of the particular, case-specific problems in the Lincoln assassination trial are unlikely to recur in the future, even in deeply contested military criminal tribunals such as the current military commissions at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base. In recent decades, Congress has substantially reformed and “civilianized” the systems of military justice in order to conform them much more closely to the processes of civilian courts. There is, of course, continuing debate about whether these reforms are sufficient; modern courts-martial and (especially) military commissions certainly remain deeply controversial. Not even their harshest critics, however, think it is likely we will ever again see anything resembling the Lincoln assassination commission.\n\nThis Article’s principal subject, then, is not the particular irregular­ities and flaws of the Lincoln assassination trial itself, troubling though they may have been. Instead, the Article is about the Lincoln trial, and related aspects of the assassination and the War Department’s system of military commissions, as law—the extent to which these singular historical events might, or might not, serve as legal precedents for subse­quent generations or, in some cases, aberrant examples of constitutional error that might serve as object lessons for future actors in all three branches of the federal government.\n\n* * *\n\nThe fundamental constitutional question at the heart of the assassi­nation trial was a constant source of contestation throughout the Civil War and into Reconstruction, has been the subject of debate and analysis in many of the nation’s other major wars, and has not yet been fully resolved: When, if ever, is it constitutional for the federal government to try persons other than members of the U.S. armed forces in a wartime military tribunal?\n\nArticle III of the Constitution provides two guarantees with respect to federal criminal trials: (1) A civilian jury will adjudicate guilt of “all crimes” (a protection so important to the Framers that they repeated it in the Sixth Amendment ); and (2) an independent judge—someone not in any way subservient to the political branches—will oversee the proceedings and render rulings of law. As Chief Justice Roberts has recently explained with respect to the latter feature of Article III:\n\nBy appointing judges to serve without term limits, and restrict­ing the ability of the other branches to remove judges or diminish their salaries, the Framers sought to ensure that each judicial decision would be rendered, not with an eye toward currying favor with Congress or the Executive, but rather with the “[c]lear heads . . . and honest hearts” deemed “essential to good judges.”\n\nThe concerns about disregarding these two Article III guarantees are especially acute when it comes to military tribunals, because even “conceding to military personnel that high degree of honesty and sense of justice which nearly all of them undoubtedly have,” nevertheless military tribunals “have not been and probably never can be constituted in such way that they can have the same kind of qualifications that the Constitution has deemed essential to fair trials of civilians in federal courts.” Military judges, for instance, not only lack lifetime salary and tenure protections; they are also assigned to judicial duty by other executive officers, and commanding officers can remove or reassign them at will. What is more, the future prospects for promotion and reassignment of both military judges and military panel “members” are in the hands of their superior officers; and, because promotion to a higher rank is appointment to a new office, which requires Senate consent, such officers have reason and incentive to avoid antagonizing or disappointing the legislative branch, as well.\n\nDespite these concerns, the Supreme Court has recognized three distinct contexts in which the Constitution permits criminal trials in military courts : (i) for the court-martial of individuals within, or in some cases employed by, the United States armed forces themselves; (ii) when the military is occupying a foreign territory and therefore no civilian courts are available; and, most significantly, (iii) when the trial is for offenses against the international law of war.\n\nThe question at issue in the Lincoln assassination trial—a question that was intensely debated throughout the Civil War and that has engendered significant confusion and disagreement in several other wars, as well—is whether there is, or ought to be, a fourth military exception, for the military adjudication of domestic-law offenses in wartime.\n\nAs I explain at greater length elsewhere, this Article III question has become increasingly important in the United States’ current armed conflicts against nonstate armed terrorist organizations, such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Such nonstate enemies regularly engage in conduct—such as targeting U.S. forces, providing material assistance to terrorism, or conspiring to commit law-of-war offenses—that violates U.S. law but that international law neither prohibits nor privileges against prosecution. And Congress has recently authorized military commissions to try alien enemy belligerents for many such domestic-law offenses, such as material support for terrorism and conspiracy. Therefore, as a matter of statute, many terrorism-related activities now constitute offenses that can be tried either by a military tribunal or in an Article III court. Moreover, as to some defendants—those detained at the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base—a military commission is currently the only possible venue, because Congress has precluded the President from trying them in ordinary Article III courts.\n\nNot surprisingly, then, the Article III question—whether military commissions may adjudicate domestic-law offenses in wartime—has recently been litigated, for the first time in many decades. A military commission at Guantánamo convicted Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman al Bahlul of several war-related offenses under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 that are not violations of the international law of war, such as providing material support to terrorism. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned all but one of those convictions on other constitutional grounds, leaving only a single remaining conviction for an inchoate conspiracy.\n\nThe United States conceded that such a conspiracy is not a violation of the international law of war. The government nevertheless argued that it was constitutional for Congress to authorize a military tribunal to try al Bahlul for such a domestic-law offense, even though the case could (if Congress allowed it) be tried in an Article III court. And in the appellate court’s recent en banc decision, four judges agreed.\n\nThe Article III question has recently taken on even greater significance in light of the recent presidential election. During the 2016 presidential campaign, then–Republican candidate Donald Trump expressed disdain for Article III trials of terrorist suspects and signaled that he intends to try even more detainees, including even U.S. citizens, in military commissions. Although the current version of the Military Commissions Act does not authorize the trial of U.S. citizens by military commission, now-President Trump and the Republican Congress might well seek to amend that statute. In any event, another longstanding provision of the Uniform Code of Military Justice already authorizes the trial in military tribunals—with a potential penalty of death—of U.S. persons who attempt to aid the enemy in certain ways or to correspond with the enemy. As recently as 1943, the government convicted a U.S. citizen in a military tribunal for violation of an earlier iteration of that statutory offense.\n\nSuch a military prosecution would appear to conflict directly with the terms of Article III (“all Crimes”) and the Sixth Amendment (“all criminal prosecutions”). As the Court stated in the landmark Milligan case, these are “provisions . . . too plain and direct, to leave room for misconstruction or doubt of their true meaning” —they are “expressed in such plain English words, that it would seem the ingenuity of man could not evade them.” Thus, as Judge Kavanaugh conceded in his recent opinion for three judges in Al Bahlul, “Based solely on the text of Article III, Bahlul might have a point.” Nevertheless, the government has insisted—and, in Al Bahlul, Judge Kavanaugh and some of his colleagues agreed—that history resolves the constitutional question in favor of the authority to adjudicate such charges without the judge and jury guarantees of Article III.\n\nThe government and Judge Kavanaugh have relied on two distinct kinds of historical antecedents. First, the government invokes precedents from the Revolutionary War, in which the Continental Congress approved, and General George Washington implemented, military trials against spies and, in at least one case, a civilian charged with aiding the British army. Citing the Court’s understanding in Ex parte Quirin that “it was not the purpose or effect of § 2 of Article III . . . to bring within the sweep of the guaranty those cases in which it was then well understood that a jury trial could not be demanded as of right,” the government has argued that this preconstitutional history, or the “backdrop” against which the Constitution was drafted and ratified, demonstrates that the Constitution does not bar military trial of war-related domestic-law offenses. Judge Kavanaugh has further contended that the early Congresses in effect ratified that constitutional understanding. In a recent article, I explain why these Founding-era precedents offer meager support for the consti­tutionality of military trials for war-related domestic-law offenses.\n\nSecond, heeding recent Supreme Court admonitions that “a regular course of practice” by the political branches—even one that “began after the founding era”—can, in Madison’s words, “liquidate & settle the meaning” of contested constitutional text, the government argues that “longstanding practice of the government . . . can inform our determi­nation of what the law is” on the Article III question. This theory is at the heart of Judge Kavanaugh’s recent opinion in Al Bahlul. Kavanaugh emphasized that in two of the nation’s most important wars—the Civil War and the Second World War—the executive branch used military tribunals to try individuals for offenses (including conspiracy) that were not violations of the international law of war. Citing the Supreme Court’s recent decision in NLRB v. Noel Canning, Judge Kavanaugh concluded that “we must be ‘reluctant to upset this traditional practice where doing so would seriously shrink the authority that Presidents have believed existed and have exercised for so long.’”\n\nOn closer examination, this “traditional practice” is not especially extensive: The government, for instance, cites only a smattering of executive branch precedents—principally, five trials involving charges of “conspiracy” and other domestic-law offenses—during the Civil War and the Second World War. And of those five, Judge Kavanaugh’s historical case rests upon only three. Two of those three were military trials of Nazi saboteurs in the Second World War, including in the Quirin case. As I explain later in this Article, however, those saboteur cases can hardly begin to describe a well-established practice that might be thought to “liquidate” an implied exception to Article III’s plain words, not least because the Supreme Court in Quirin expressly declined to sustain the convictions on the charges in that case—including a charge of aiding the enemy—that did not describe what the Court viewed as international law-of-war violations.\n\nThat leaves just one other historical precedent, on which the “liquidation” argument crucially depends: the Lincoln assassination proceeding, which Judge Kavanaugh referred to as one of the two “most well-known and important U.S. military commissions in American history” (along with the Quirin saboteurs case). His is not an idiosyncratic view of the Lincoln trial: Earlier in the Al Bahlul litigation, six judges of the court of appeals described that proceeding as “a particularly significant precedent” because it was “a matter of paramount national importance [that] attracted intense public scrutiny” and “the highest-level Executive Branch involvement.”\n\nIn certain respects, it is easy to see why the Lincoln assassination commission has come to play such a prominent part in the current debates about the constitutionality of using military commissions to try Guantánamo detainees for domestic-law offenses. After all, unlike the recent al-Qaeda defendants such as al Bahlul, the Lincoln defendants were not even members of an enemy armed force: They were U.S. citizens (most of whom resided in Union territory), captured and tried in the United States, for crimes that occurred in the nation’s capital, and without the sort of congressional authorization of the military pro­ceeding that the Military Commissions Act now provides. Thus, if the courts were ultimately to accept the Article III challenges to the recent Guantánamo trials, such a holding would almost certainly repudiate—in Judge Henderson’s words, “retroactively undermine”—a landmark event in our national legal and political narrative. Arguably, such a result should be disfavored or, at the very least, viewed with considerable skepticism.\n\nOr so Judge Kavanaugh has suggested: In an earlier iteration of the Al Bahlul case, he expressed doubts about al Bahlul’s constitutional argument precisely because it “would render the Lincoln conspirators and Nazi saboteur convictions for conspiracy illegitimate and unconsti­tutional.” And in his most recent opinion for three judges, Kavanaugh concluded that this is something courts should not do because the Lincoln trial (together with Quirin) is “at the core” of histor­ical military practice, which “cannot be airbrushed out of the picture.”\n\nAs I demonstrate in this Article, however, such respect for the Lincoln assassination trial as an important constitutional precedent would itself be an historical anomaly. To be sure, that proceeding might, indeed, be the “highest-profile and most important” military trial in the nation’s history. Prominence does not necessarily correlate with precedent, however—not precedent worthy of respect, anyway. Until very recently it was folly—virtually unthinkable—for anyone to rely on the conspirators’ proceeding as a venerated example that might support, rather than undermine, the argument that domestic-law offenses in wartime can be tried in military commissions rather than in Article III courts.\n\nIndeed, even at the time of the trial, the constitutionality of the military court was deeply contested. Members of Lincoln’s own cabinet, and at least one member of the commission itself, thought it was unconstitutional. Much of the pro-Union press inveighed against the constitutionality of the trial, as well. And an esteemed New York judge, noting “grave” constitutional doubts, went so far as to invite a grand jury to issue a “presentment” concerning the unlawfulness of the Lincoln commission. Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court’s 1866 decision in Ex parte Milligan was widely, and correctly, viewed as the death knell for the sorts of military courts that had become ubiquitous during the Civil War—including the Lincoln conspiracy tribunal itself—because all of the Justices in that case rejected the government’s central arguments for bypassing the civilian courts. Accordingly, when Booth’s primary accomplice, John Surratt, was extradited to the United States several months after the Milligan decision, the government tried him in the local Article III court, where he was eventually freed after the jury was unable to reach a verdict.\n\nAs far as the legal world was concerned, that was just about the last anyone heard of the constitutionality of the Lincoln assassination trial for well over a century, even though the constitutional question (whether Article III and the Sixth Amendment preclude such wartime military tribunals) was the subject of substantial debate in both World Wars. The Lincoln case disappeared from the leading treatises and academic accounts of military jurisdiction—so much so that the author of the most recent law review article devoted to the question of the trial’s consti­tutionality, published in 1933, described the Lincoln commission precedent as having been “relegated to the museum of legal history.”\n\nThat was eighty-five years ago, and the constitutional questions raised by the Lincoln assassination trial have received virtually no scholarly attention since then. As one of the nation’s leading experts on military law wrote to Justice Frankfurter in 1942, the Lincoln assassi­nation tribunal is an example of military jurisdiction that “no self-respecting military lawyer will look straight in the eye.” The trial of the Lincoln conspirators had, in effect, become the Case That Must Not Be Named.\n\nUntil recently. Seemingly out of the blue, Justice Thomas cited the assassination trial as a relevant precedent (albeit for a statutory argument) in his dissenting opinion in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld —thereby signaling that the Lincoln trial might, for the first time since 1865, serve as a possible source of legal authority. Shortly thereafter, the en banc federal court of appeals in the Al Bahlul case went further still, insisting that it is “a particularly significant precedent”; and several judges on that court pointed to that proceeding as the principal basis for turning aside al Bahlul’s constitutional objections. This completes an extraordinary about-face: All of a sudden, the Lincoln trial is no longer a dusty museum relic, let alone an antiprecedent—a case so palpably unconstitutional and unlawful that no one dare invoke it for over a century; instead, it “looms as an especially clear and significant precedent,” one that “cannot be airbrushed out of the picture” because it lies “at the core” of our constitutional tradition.\n\n* * *\n\nThis Article is a study of the Lincoln assassination trial and its place in our constitutional narrative. The most immediate reason for revisiting the 1865 commission is that a fair assessment of the constitutional arguments associated with that trial might bear heavily on the recent military commissions litigation testing the limits of Article III in wartime—an unresolved question that has bedeviled courts and com­mentators throughout the nation’s history. Indeed, the Lincoln pre­cedent looms especially large now, given the new President’s professed desire to do what President Johnson did then—namely, use military courts to try U.S. citizens alleged to have assisted the enemy.\n\nMoreover, and wholly apart from how modern courts might settle that particular constitutional controversy, the Lincoln assassination trial was a signal event in our constitutional history and the centerpiece of a fascinating constitutional debate about military justice that raged throughout the Civil War and into Reconstruction. There is a rich aca­demic literature on many of the great constitutional questions raised during the Civil War, such as secession, habeas suspension, eman­cipation, and presidential prerogatives. Yet, until now, there has not been any comparable, comprehensive account of the ways in which all three branches engaged repeatedly with the difficult question of the permissible scope of military justice and whether certain wartime exigencies might justify circumvention of Article III’s guarantees. As I will demonstrate, the question was so vexing throughout the war that even Lincoln himself—the greatest constitutional thinker of his time—appeared to be singularly uncertain how to resolve it. Finally, at war’s end, the President and many of his congressional allies appeared to be on the verge of repudiating the system of military tribunals that Lincoln himself had superintended. His assassination, however, prompted the new President, Andrew Johnson, to convene the most controversial military trial of them all, in the name of avenging Lincoln’s death. That unorthodox, landmark proceeding revived the heated debate over the constitutional question in acute form. It also offered the occasion for the Article III courts themselves to resolve the question—only to have that opportunity stymied at the last moment, when Johnson dramatically suspended the habeas jurisdiction of the court hearing Mary Surratt’s petition, one of the only instances in the nation’s history in which the Executive has disregarded a judicial order.\n\nThe story of this constitutional contestation during the Civil War is certainly worth recovering and conveying to new generations, if only as a cautionary tale, on the occasion of the trial’s sesquicentennial. This Article is the first detailed academic treatment of the legal debates surrounding the system of Civil War military tribunals.\n\nThe Article also contributes to the current, robust academic inter­rogation of the use of custom, or practice, as an interpretive guide to questions involving the separation of powers. In particular, the Article explores the place of the Lincoln trial in constitutional discourse after 1868—the ways in which that proceeding, and other Civil War military trials, have been accorded authority, or dismissed as non­authoritative, in subsequent generations. This historical exhumation might help inform current debates about whether and under what circum­stances political branch practice, especially high-profile precedents, ought to establish, or “liquidate,” the meaning or proper application of the Constitution. It might also provide insight into how particular precedents come to be established as canonical or as “anticanonical” —and perhaps, as in this case, how they might toggle back and forth between the anticanon and the canon.\n\nPart I of the Article sets the stage for the events of 1865. It recounts the sudden proliferation, during the Civil War, of military trials of persons who were not part of the Union armies and the considerable constitutional debates surrounding that practice in the military proceedings themselves and in both of the political branches. In Part II, the heart of the Article, I then examine the ways in which the constitutional question was contest­ed and resolved in connection with the Lincoln assassination trial itself.\n\nIn Part III, I turn to the effects of the postwar Milligan decision and how the generation immediately after the war came to view both the Lincoln trial, in particular, and the constitutionality of military criminal adjudication generally. In Part IV, I show how the Lincoln trial virtually disappeared as a constitutional precedent during wartime debates of the constitutional question in the two World Wars. Part V briefly examines the cases from World War II on which the government and Judge Kavanaugh have relied and the furtive revival of the Lincoln trial as legal authority since September 11, 2001. Finally, in Part VI, I offer some thoughts on what this history of the Lincoln trial might demonstrate, not only about the merits of the Article III question currently at issue in the courts but also, and more broadly, about the use of high-profile historical practices as a source of constitutional authority.\n\nI. Consideration of the Constitutional Question During the Civil War\n\nLong before the tragic events of April 14, 1865, criminal trials in military commissions had become commonplace in the Civil War. In the forty or so months that preceded Lincoln’s assassination, the War Department instituted an elaborate system of such commissions (and some courts-martial) throughout the land—military courts that, in many places, virtually displaced ordinary civilian courts. These military tribunals occasionally tried members of the Union and Confederate armed forces for violations of the law of war. Much more frequently, however, Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt and his august team of prosecutors brought a wide range of charges against persons who were unconnected to military forces, in most cases for conduct that did not violate the international law of war.\n\nCommission proceedings began early in the war in the border states of Missouri and Kentucky, primarily against organized “guerrilla” groups and other marauders—persons sympathetic to, but not formally in league with, the Confederate cause, who endeavored to undermine the Union war effort by sabotage, including the destruction of railroads, bridges, and telegraph lines. After President Lincoln appointed Holt as Judge Advocate General in September 1862, however, the cases quickly expanded to other jurisdictions, including the District of Columbia and some northern states, and to what Professor John Witt rightly charac­terizes as a “stunningly wide array of conduct.” Some cases involved ordinary crimes—“often with only a very attenuated or nonexistent connection to the war—while others involved a wide array of activities that the military viewed as harmful to the Union war effort,” including expressions of sympathy for the Confederacy or criticizing the Union Army. William Winthrop, a member of Holt’s team of judge advocates, later listed many of the charges tried in the commissions, roughly corre­sponding to these two categories of charges. Winthrop’s enumeration is, indeed, stunning in its breadth:\n\nmurder, manslaughter, robbery, larceny, burglary, rape, arson, assault and battery, attempts to commit the same; criminal conspiracies, riot, perjury, bribery, accepting bribes, forgery, fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation or other illegal disposition of public property, receiving stolen goods, obtaining money or property under false pretences, making or uttering counterfeit money, uttering false Treasury notes, breaches of the peace and disorderly conduct, keeping a disorderly house, selling obscene books, &c., malicious mischief or trespass, carrying concealed weapons, abuse of official authority by civil officials, resisting or evading the draft, discouraging enlistments, purchasing arms, clothing, &c., from soldiers, . . . aiding desertion, &c., . . . breaches of the law of non-intercourse with the enemy, such as running or attempting to run a blockade; unauthorized contracting, trading or dealing with, enemies, or furnishing them with money, arms, provisions, medicines, &c.; conveying to or from them dispatches, letters, or other commu­nications, passing the lines for any purpose without a permit, or coming back after being sent through the lines and ordered not to return; aiding the enemy by harboring his spies, emissaries, &c., assisting his people or friends to cross the lines into his country, acting as guide to his troops, aiding the escape of his soldiers held as prisoners of war, secretly recruiting for his army, negotiating and circulating his currency or securities—as confederate notes or bonds . . . , hostile or disloyal acts, or publications or declarations calculated to excite opposition to the federal government or sympathy with the enemy, &c.; engaging in illegal warfare as a guerilla, or by the deliberate burning, or other destruction of boats, trains, bridges, buildings, &c.; acting as a spy, taking life or obtaining any advantage by means of treachery; abuse or violation of a flag of truce; violation of a parole or of an oath of allegiance or amnesty, breach of bond given for loyal behaviour, good conduct, &c.; resistance to the constituted military authority, bribing or attempting to bribe officers or soldiers or the constituted civil officials; [and] kidnapping or returning persons to slavery.\n\nWinthrop added that even “treason,” as such, was “not infrequently charged.” John Witt and Mark Neely also recount cases in which individuals were charged with traveling into the South without a pass; permitting rebels to lurk in a neighborhood without reporting them; corresponding with a child in the Confederate Army; stealing horses; and simply speaking aloud, “I am a Jeff Davis man.” In addition to all this, courts-martial—which, unlike commissions, were statutorily authorized—also tried individuals for spying and for providing forms of aid to the enemy specified in the Articles of War, neither of which were offenses that violated the law of war.\n\nEven early in the war, this practice induced one shocked senator to remark that Secretary of War Stanton was “prone to bring every person and every act within military law and military courts.” Similarly, Lincoln’s Attorney General Edward Bates lamented that “[t]here seems to be a general and growing disposition of the military, wherever stationed, to engross all power, and to treat the civil Government with contumely, as if the object were to bring it into contempt.” By the time of the Lincoln assassination trial, such characterizations were not exaggerations.\n\nA. The War Department’s Justifications for the Constitutionality of Military Adjudication of Domestic-Law Offenses\n\nThere was frequent public debate about the constitutionality of these tribunals, and occasionally the issue was litigated, mostly inside the military justice system itself. During the course of the war, the military lawyers and officers who defended the legality of the tribunals did not settle upon a single rationale or justification. Instead, they invoked a smattering of different theories, in various combinations. Prior to the landmark Milligan and Lincoln assassination trials at the close of the war, the military relied primarily on three theories. One of them—an argument of “necessity” by virtue of the alleged inadequacy of civilian courts —did not withstand the Supreme Court’s subsequent decision in Milligan. The second argument, which fully flowered only after the Lincoln trial itself, rested on a rationale that the Supreme Court would later endorse in Quirin —namely, that Congress may authorize military tribunals to adjudicate offenses against the international law of war. The third rationale, which took various forms and was somewhat under­theorized, was that constitutional guarantees simply did not apply to certain forms of belligerent conduct, an argument that the courts never endorsed when it came to trial guarantees (including judge and jury) and that, more broadly, has not survived to the modern era.\n\n1. The “Martial Law” Argument from Necessity. — The most common and prominent explanation the War Department offered to justify its use of military commissions was one of exigency—namely, that military tribunals were necessary because the defendants could not be tried in ordinary civilian courts. Early in the Civil War, for example, both the President and his generals, including, most importantly, General Henry Halleck, declared “martial law” in areas where the civil justice system was said to be unavailable or ineffective—and in such locales, the Army then used military commissions regularly, as a substitute for civilian justice. Looking back upon the use of military commissions as the war was ending, Judge Advocate General Holt wrote that the commissions “originat[ed] in the necessities of the rebellion” and were employed “in regions where other courts had ceased to exist, and in cases of which the local criminal courts could not legally take cognizance, or which, by reason of intrinsic defects of machinery, they were incompetent to pass upon.”\n\nThe difficulty with this justification, however, was that the civilian courts had not actually “ceased to exist” in those areas where President Lincoln and his generals declared martial law and began to regularly use military commissions in the Civil War; nor were the civil courts unable to “take cognizance” over most of the dangerous conduct that was adjudi­cated in military commissions. In fact, and not surprisingly, the true reason the War Department turned to military commissions was not out of necessity but because it was understandably eager to deliver justice that was much swifter and more unconstrained than in the ordinary course of trials in Article III (and state) courts—and, in some places, because the military officials feared that lay juries might refuse to convict, due to the presence of Confederate sympathizers within the jury pools.\n\nThis can be seen by looking closely at the two most dramatic declarations of martial law early in the war: Major General Henry Halleck’s declarations in Missouri in 1861 to 1862 and President Lincoln’s own extraordinary nationwide declaration in September 1862 (which was, in turn, preceded by a similar declaration by Secretary of War Edwin Stanton).\n\na. Halleck, December 1861. — Henry Halleck was a lawyer and a scholar, as well as an Army officer. Just before the war, Halleck published one of the first comprehensive international law treatises in the United States that focused on the law of war. Lincoln appointed him com­mander of the Department of the Missouri in November 1861 (and would later appoint him to be General-in-Chief of all the Union armies in July 1862 ). In Missouri, Halleck confronted a state overrun by persons who were not part of the Confederate Army but who nonetheless worked assiduously to undermine the Union war effort. There were “numerous rebels and spies within our camps and in the territory occupied by our troops, who give information, aid, and assistance to the enemy,” he wrote. “[R]ebels scattered through the country threaten and drive out loyal citizens and rob them of their property; . . . they furnish the enemy with arms, provisions, clothing, horses, and means of transportation; and . . . insurgents are banding together . . . to rob, to maraud, and to lay waste the country.”\n\nOn November 20, 1861, his very first day in command, Halleck wrote to General McClellan, seeking the President’s written authority to declare martial law within his department. Receiving no response, Halleck wrote in greater detail five days later. He began by assuring McClellan and Lincoln it was not his intent to enforce martial law “in any place where there are civil tribunals which can be intrusted with the punishment of offenses and the regular administration of justice” and that he “intend[ed] to restrict [martial law] as much as possible.” Halleck did not claim, however, that the state and federal courts in St. Louis were closed or unavailable. Instead, he obliquely suggested that there were “no civil authorities” to prosecute frauds against the govern­ment due to an “absence of the proper civil tribunals.” Halleck did not specify what was “improper” about the existing courts or why they could not be “intrusted.” He probably did not need to spell out his thinking for his commanding officers.\n\nThe next day, still having received no answer, Halleck pleaded again for the presidential authority that was, he said, “absolutely necessary to enable me to procure evidence” of frauds against the government. “If this authority be refused,” wrote Halleck, “I shall not exercise it, no matter how much the public service may suffer.” In fact, unbeknownst to Halleck, McClellan had already sent a response to his previous request. (Presumably the missives crossed in the proverbial mail.) McClellan—perhaps reflecting some uncertainty in Washington about whether displacement of civilian courts in Missouri was truly necessary—requested Halleck to “give your views more fully as to the necessity of enforcing martial law in your department.” On November 30, then, Halleck offered a more desperate—but still not very specific—plea, this time not focused on fraud in particular: Missouri, he wrote, was “in a state of insurrection,” but the threat was diffuse, such that there was no “large gathering in any one place so that we can strike them.” Instead, Halleck needed to “punish these outrages” individually—something that was necessary because “there is no civil law or civil authority to reach them.” Once again, he did not explain why the civil law and authority were inadequate to punish wrongdoers.\n\nOn December 2, Lincoln finally authorized Halleck not only to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in Missouri but also “to exercise martial law as you find it necessary in your discretion to secure the public safety and the authority of the United States.” Two days later, Halleck issued an order directing commanding officers within the Department of the Missouri not only to arrest and confine “all persons in arms against the lawful authorities of the United States, or who give aid, assistance, or encouragement to the enemy” but also to convene military commissions for the trial “of persons charged with aiding and assisting the enemy, the destruction of bridges, roads, and buildings, and the taking of public or private property for hostile purposes.”\n\nIn a follow-on General Order four weeks later, Halleck prescribed how such commissions would work. In that January 1, 1862, Order, he nominally guaranteed that “[c]ivil offenses cognizable by civil courts whenever such loyal courts exist will not be tried by a military commis­sion.” Halleck then proceeded, however, to render this an empty promise by adding that “many offenses which in time of peace are civil offenses become in time of war military offenses and are to be tried by a military tribunal even in places where civil tribunals exist.” In other words, by recharacterizing conduct ordinarily condemned as a civil crime as a so-called “military” offense, the War Department could ensure that the offense was “not within the jurisdiction of any existing civil court” —and in that case, the argument went, necessity required military adjudication. For example, although Halleck’s order acknowledged that treason, as such, was “a distinct offense . . . defined by the Constitution [that] must be tried by courts duly constituted by law,” nevertheless “certain acts of a treasonable character,” such as conveying information to the enemy, were “military offenses triable by military tribunals and punishable by military authority.”\n\nThis barely disguised sleight of hand did not include an explanation of why the criminal conduct could not simply be characterized in the traditional manner (e.g., as treason) and then be tried in a civilian court. The December 4 Order, however, was unusually candid in explaining why Halleck was so eager to use military commissions: not because Missouri courts were literally unavailable or without jurisdiction to pun­ish the conduct in question—as Justice Samuel Miller would later note, “the process of the courts [in the state] had never been interrupted” —but because they were insufficiently harsh. Their structures and procedures, Halleck explained, were not designed for the purpose of winning a war: “The mild and indulgent course heretofore pursued toward this class of men has utterly failed to restrain them from such unlawful conduct.” A “more severe policy” therefore was necessary, according to Halleck—one in which the miscreants were not afforded “the rights of peace.” Halleck wrote more along these lines in a letter to then–Chief Justice of the Kansas Supreme Court Thomas Ewing on January 1, 1862, explaining his resort to martial law in Missouri: Bridge-burners, wrote Halleck, are not “armed and open enemies but . . . pretended quiet citizens living on their farms,” who are back “quietly plowing or working in [the] field” a mere hour after the sabotage. The civil courts, Halleck explained, “are very generally unreliable” in dealing with this problem; therefore he had “determined to put down these insurgents and bridge-burners with a strong hand.” (It is probably not a coincidence that Ewing would later represent some of the accused in the Lincoln conspiracy trial and, in that capacity, offer an eloquent attack on the constitutional authority of the military court. )\n\nIn fact, and contrary to Halleck’s suggestion, the Army did not need military tribunals to restrain the individuals who were committing such crimes: Many of them could have been convicted in civilian courts, and the military was arresting most of the others and asserting the authority to preventively detain them for the duration of the war. Accordingly, Halleck here was admitting, in effect, that the principal purpose of the military tribunals was not so much to incapacitate the particular defen­dants who had been arrested but instead to deter others with the prospect of harsh and unrelenting military justice, unencumbered by due process or other constitutional protections. As Judge Advocate Holt would put the point in his argument for court-martial jurisdiction to try an alleged Confederate abettor in 1863, “Proceedings in the ordinary criminal courts, by indictment and jury trial, would have no terror for such traitors”; if offenses are not “promptly and unsparingly punished, there can be no successful prosecution of hostilities.” This sort of argument—that the use of severe military justice is necessary in order to terrorize citizens sympathetic to the enemy and to thereby deter them from misdeeds—is not one that the government ever could, or did, offer forthrightly to any reviewing, civilian court assessing the constitutionality of the tribunals (such as the Supreme Court in Milligan a few years later). It would not do to say, in such a setting, that the judge and jury protections of Article III—the “rights of peace” or, as Holt would later characterize them dismissively, the “intrinsic defects of machinery” of such courts —were inadequate because they undermined the in terrorem impact that might be realized by the use, and threat, of summary and unforgiving military justice.\n\nb. Stanton and Lincoln, August and September 1862. — In August 1862, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton issued an order entitled “Authorizing Arrests of Persons Discouraging Enlistments.” Its authority to arrest was not limited, however, to conduct involving military enlistment, nor was it geographically cabined. It directed all U.S. marshals, and the super­intendents or chiefs of police of “any town, city, or district,” to “arrest and imprison any person or persons who may be engaged, by act, speech, or writing, in discouraging volunteer enlistments, or in any way giving aid and comfort to the enemy, or in any other disloyal practice against the United States.” Stanton’s decree, like Lincoln’s a few weeks later, is primarily remembered today for its authorization to arrest and detain those who urged resistance to the new conscription laws and other critics of the Union cause. Stanton’s order, however, went further still: It ordered the civilian officials in question to report the arrested offenders “to [Major] L. C. Turner, judge-advocate, in order that such persons may be tried before a military commission.” Seven weeks later, President Lincoln himself followed suit, “order[ing]” that “all rebels and insurgents, their aiders and abettors,” as well as any other persons throughout the United States “discouraging volunteer enlistments, resisting militia drafts” or guilty “of any disloyal practice, affording aid and comfort to rebels against the authority of the United States” were to be “subject to martial law, and liable to trial and punishment by courts-martial or military commission.”\n\nLincoln’s nationwide order on its face offered a purported justification for such an extraordinary assertion of military jurisdiction: “[D]isloyal persons are not adequately restrained by the ordinary processes of law from [calling volunteers and draftees into service] and from giving aid and comfort in various ways to the insurrection.” This was, however, a gross overstatement (at least absent any further elaboration). As one state judge would shortly remark, the President’s order made little sense, at least in those states, such as Wisconsin, where the ordinary Article III and state courts were entirely adequate to the task of adjudicating cases involving aid to the enemy; indeed, in July 1862, Congress had enacted a new treason law predicated on the assumption that such civilian trials were the proper means of dealing with the problem. Apparently, then, Lincoln, like Halleck and Stanton, had turned to so-called “martial law,” and to military tribunals, not because civilian courts and other mechanisms (including military detention) were unavailable to incapacitate and punish wrongdoers but instead because such civil processes did not, in Lincoln’s words, adequately “restrain,” or deter, others. As I explain below, this reasoning, a very aggressive notion of the “necessity” that required circumvention of ordinary civilian courts, did not survive the Supreme Court’s decision in Milligan.\n\n2. The Lieber Code’s Theory of Alleged Violations of the “Laws of War.” — As John Fabian Witt has recently documented, as the Civil War progressed the War Department increasingly alleged that many of the accused on trial in commissions who were not members of either the Union or Confederate forces had violated the “laws of war.” There were some such charges in Missouri, even before Lincoln’s martial-law declaration in September 1862. The incidence of such “law of war” charges increased dramatically, however, late in 1862 and into 1863; by the end of the war, nearly 1,000 individuals had been so charged, by Witt’s count. Because the defendants in these cases were over­whelmingly civilians, the “law of war” charges were not usually what we have come to think of today as violations of the jus in bello—the rules that govern the conduct of armies—such as targeting civilians, torture, perfidy, or the use of prohibited weapons. Instead, as Witt describes, the so-called law-of-war charges in Civil War commissions covered a stunningly wide array of conduct, much of it involving private violence and disloyal conduct (including speech) that, directly or indirectly, was thought to undermine the Union war effort.\n\nAs we will see, this became the primary basis that Attorney General James Speed offered, in mid-1865, to justify the constitutionality of the Lincoln assassination trial. It is not clear, however, that the War Department ever placed much weight on this rationale to justify the constitutionality of commissions earlier in the war. The closest instance I have found is an offhand claim made by General Halleck in a memorandum he wrote in 1864, which was not published until many decades after his death. Because the offenses in question were “against the common laws of war,” Halleck wrote, “the civil courts could impose no punishment.” This assertion would not have been very persuasive, even if the military had relied upon it openly. Although it is true that, during the Civil War, Congress had not enacted any laws making law-of-war violations subject to civilian prosecution, certainly Congress could have done so, as it has done in modern times, pursuant to its power to define and punish offenses against the law of nations.\n\nThere would have been a more fundamental problem with this argument, too, as Halleck well knew—namely, that most of the offenses tried in military commissions were not violations of the law of war, notwithstanding the characterizations of the War Department. This confusion about the source of law arose, in large measure, from the way in which the famous “Lieber Code” treated certain hostile conduct by persons who were not part of enemy forces.\n\nIn 1862, at Halleck’s urging, Professor Francis Lieber completed a study of the problem that Halleck confronted in Missouri—how the law treated so-called “guerrilla” parties who engaged in actions to sabotage the nation’s war effort even though they were not formally affiliated with the enemy. The subject matter, Lieber noted in the first sentence of his paper, “has rarely been taken up by writers on the law of war” and was “substantially a new topic in the law of war.” The issue was not quite unprecedented, however: In fact, Halleck himself had dealt with the issue briefly the preceding year, in his international law treatise. Halleck explained that, unlike the belligerent acts of members of a nation’s armed forces, which are privileged by international law against prosecution (such fighters can, wrote Halleck, “plead the laws of war in their justification”—what today is known as the combatant’s privilege), the hostile acts of bands of men who riot, plunder, and destroy without the sanction of their government, even in support of a war, “are not legitimate acts of war, and, therefore, are punishable according to the nature or character of the offense committed.” So, for example, if such persons take property by force in offensive hostilities it is not an act “authorized by the law of nations, but a robbery”; and the killing of the state’s armed forces by such bands of private parties likewise is not a privileged act of war “but a murder.” Halleck explained that such persons, when captured, are treated not as prisoners of war but instead “as criminals, subject to the punishment due to their crimes.” Lieber’s paper on guerrilla parties was to similar effect: Guerrillas, banditti, and the like, he reasoned, do not receive the benefits of the law of war; they are “answerable for the commission of those acts to which the law of war grants no protection.” Brigands, prowlers, bushwackers, and private assassins cannot “expect to be treated as a fair enemy of the regular war,” entitled to the “privileges of regular warfare” that attach to authorized forces. This, then, was Lieber’s effort “to ascertain what may be consid­ered the law of war, or fair rules of action toward so-called guerrilla parties” : Their misdeeds will not go “unpunished,” for the law of war does not protect them. Importantly, however, Lieber did not argue that the law of war proscribes their unauthorized conduct or that it insists upon their punishment, in the way that a subset of the law of nations forbids certain practices of war (e.g., targeting civilians or torture).\n\nThis same, altogether accurate perspective is reflected in much of what came to be colloquially known as the “Lieber Code”—the regu­lations, written primarily by Lieber, that the Adjutant General’s Office issued in April 1863 for use by the Union armies. The Lieber Code addressed a “dazzling array of questions.” In light of Lieber’s expertise in international law, much of the Code consists of descriptions of the “limitations and restrictions” that the customary laws of war impose on the conduct of war, including, for instance, that parties may not engage in cruelty or break “stipulations solemnly contracted by the belligerents in time of peace,” use poison in any manner, harm prisoners “in order to extort the desired information or to punish them for having given false information,” or punish a “successful spy” who returns to his own army. Other parts of the Code, however, explain what belligerents can do without transgressing the law of war—including which law-of-war privileges they are not required to provide to those they capture. Most importantly for present purposes, Article 82 stated:\n\n[Individuals] who commit hostilities, whether by fighting, or inroads for destruction or plunder, or by raids of any kind, without commission, without being part and portion of the organized hostile army, and without sharing continuously in the war, but who do so with intermitting returns to their homes and avocations, or with the occasional assumption of the semblance of peaceful pursuits, divesting themselves of the character or appearance of soldiers . . . are not public enemies, and there­fore, if captured, are not entitled to the privileges of prisoners of war.\n\nLikewise, Article 84 provided:\n\nArmed prowlers, by whatever names they may be called, or persons of the enemy’s territory, who steal within the lines of the hostile army, for the purpose of robbing, killing, or of destroying bridges, roads, or canals, or of robbing or destroying the mail, or of cutting the telegraph wires, are not entitled to the privileges of the prisoner of war.\n\nSo far, so good: The vast majority of the Lieber Code distinguished between conduct that the law of war prohibited and conduct that it simply did not immunize. Unfortunately, a few stray remarks in the Code suggested the further, and misleading, idea that the laws of war not only fail to privilege the belligerent conduct of persons outside the armed forces (such as “banditti”)—so that those persons can be subjected to ordinary criminal prosecution—but that the law of nations affirmatively prohibited such conduct, or prescribed a penalty for it. Article 82, for example, stated not only that the individuals committing war-related violence without authorization “are not entitled to the privileges of prisoners of war” (which was correct) but also that such persons “shall be treated summarily as highway robbers or pirates.” Similarly, Article 98 stated that “[a]ll unauthorized or secret communication with the enemy is considered treasonable by the law of war.”\n\nHere, Lieber erred. Secret communication with the enemy could be, and often is, “considered treasonable,” and states have severely punished it; but such treatment is a function of a state’s domestic law, not the international law of war itself. Likewise, individuals unaffiliated with the enemy military could be “treated summarily” (at the time, anyway)—unlike members of enemy forces, they were not entitled to the combatant’s privilege—but such treatment would be a function of municipal law, not “by the law of war.” Indeed, the law of war is generally indifferent as to how a state treats such unprivileged conduct and whether particular procedural protections will apply; those are matters for domestic law, which can vary from state to state. In the United States, such questions are determined by the corpus of federal statutes and by Article III and the Bill of Rights in the Constitution—bodies of law that the Lieber Code did not purport to describe (and concerning which Lieber himself was hardly an expert).\n\nUnfortunately, this mistaken conflation between conduct that the law of war prohibits and conduct that it does not privilege, reflected in a few stray remarks in the Lieber Code, would later infect the Attorney General’s analysis of the Lincoln assassination trial, as well as the Supreme Court’s reasoning in the important Quirin decision in 1942.\n\n3. “The Power to Make War . . . Without Limitations.” — The third, and most extreme, of the government’s principal arguments in support of the constitutionality of military commissions was fully vetted for the first time in the most notorious and controversial commission case preceding the Lincoln assassination.\n\nOn March 16, 1863, the Secretary of War assigned General Ambrose Burnside to be Commanding General of the Department of the Ohio. The next month, Burnside issued General Order No. 38, designed to address the increasingly prominent opposition to the war being voiced by Copperheads and other northern Democrats. Burnside feared that such public attacks on the Union cause were grievously injuring the Army’s efforts, such as by inspiring or even encouraging disregard of the compulsory enlistment laws. His order not only announced that anyone committing acts “for the benefit of the enemies of our country” would be “tried as spies or traitors and if convicted will suffer death”; it also went much further, declaring that “[t]he habit of declaring sympathies for the enemy will not be allowed in this department” and that persons “committing such offences will be at once arrested with a view to being tried as above stated or sent beyond our lines into the lines of their friends.”\n\nBurnside’s decree incensed a prominent leader of the “Copperhead” faction of anti-war Democrats, Clement Vallandigham. As a member of the House of Representatives from 1858 until March 3, 1863, Vallandigham had been a prominent opponent of the war. His antagonism only increased once he left office. In an inflammatory speech in Mount Vernon, Ohio, on May 1, 1863, Vallandigham described the war as “wicked, cruel, and unnecessary” and alleged that it was being pros­ecuted “for the purpose of crushing out liberty and to erect a despotism.” He also decried General Order No. 38 as “a base usurpation of arbitrary authority,” adding that “the sooner the people inform the minions of usurped power that they will not submit to such restrictions upon their liberties, the better” and that he was “resolved to do what he could to defeat the attempts now being made to build up a monarchy upon the ruins of our free government.” Predictably, this speech prompted Burnside to order Vallandigham’s arrest, on May 5; the Democrat was accused of making a public speech that “he well knew did aid, comfort, and encourage those in arms against the government, and could but induce in his hearers a distrust of their own government, sympathy for those in arms against it, and a disposition to resist the laws of the land.”\n\nThe next day, Vallandigham was arraigned before a military com­mission, which proceeded to find him guilty of most of the specifications of the charge and sentenced him to close military confinement for the duration of the war. Burnside confirmed the sentence on May 16, designating Fort Warren as the place of Vallandigham’s imprisonment.\n\nEven before the commission issued its sentence, Vallandigham petitioned a federal court for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the military lacked authority to detain him. Judge Humphrey Leavitt denied the petition, reasoning that the question was controlled as a matter of stare decisis by an earlier decision of the court that he was powerless to second-guess. The judge was careful to stress, however, that he was ruling on only the legality of Vallandigham’s arrest (i.e., his detention) and was not opining on whether the military trial was lawful: “Whether the military commission for the trial of the charges against Mr. Vallandigham was legally constituted, and had jurisdiction of the case, is not a question before this court . . . . The sole question is whether the arrest was legal . . . .”\n\nBefore Judge Leavitt ruled, however, counsel for the parties offered him their arguments on the constitutionality of the commission. Counsel for Vallandigham, for instance, contended that the military trial was precluded by an 1863 congressional enactment (on which more below) and that it violated Article III of the Constitution. The government’s lead counsel was Aaron Fyfe Perry, a private lawyer who had declined President Lincoln’s 1861 offer for an appointment to the Supreme Court. Perry’s argument was long and discursive, weaving together several different themes. For example, he somewhat melodramatically suggested that civilian juries were inappropriate for such cases because they were apt to be either too harsh or too lenient with such defendants in the heat of a war, when “the entrails of the volcano, covered for a while, have at length broken forth,” and “[s]moke and ashes obscure the sky.” Perry also made some effort to argue the exigency defense of martial law —a tough argument to sustain, given that the ordinary operations of law prevailed in Ohio, and Burnside had not specifically declared martial law there.\n\nAt the heart of Perry’s case, however, was a more fundamental argument—namely, that in the midst of an armed conflict, the laws of peacetime, including constitutional guarantees, are effectively displaced by the Executive’s “rights of war,” at least as applied to those actions taken in the service of defeating the enemy:\n\nWar is the last resort, but when properly appealed to, its processes are due and reasonable processes, and, like the rest, must be allowed to work out results exclusively by its own rules . . . . The power to make war is given without limitations. So far as war may be a means of preservation, or for warding off imminent danger, and keeping at a distance whatever is capable of causing its ruin, the nation is safe. The rights of war are as sacredly guaranteed as trial by jury, or personal liberty, or any other right whatever. The president cannot claim to have preserved, protected, and defended the constitution, to the best of his ability, until he shall have used all the ability given him by the utmost rights of war . . . . The constitution does not define the meaning of habeas corpus, or trial by jury, or liberty, or war. They were to be ascertained elsewhere . . . . By war was intended not a hollow pretext of war, but a lifting high of the red right hand of avenging justice. A thorough, condign, effectual laying hold of enemies, a summary breaking-up of their hiding places, and a terrifying deathly pursuit, until they shall cease to exist, or cease to be enemies. In Scott’s Military Dictionary, a recent work, which, he says, was not prepared in view of existing disturbances, he states the following rule (page 273): “With regard to the requisition of military aid by the civil magistrate, the rule seems to be that when once the magistrate has charged the military officer with the duty of suppressing a riot, the execution of that duty is wholly confided to the judgment and skill of the military officer, who thenceforward acts indepe­ndently of the magistrate until the service required is fully performed. The magistrate cannot dictate to the officer the mode of executing the duty; and an officer would desert his duty if he submitted to receive any such orders from the magistrate . . . .”\n\nThis argument, too, would not survive the Supreme Court’s decision, three years later, in Milligan.\n\nB. Views from the Political Branches\n\nBefore turning to the Lincoln assassination trial itself, it is important to understand how these arguments on behalf of the War Department—and the constitutionality of the military commissions practice—were treated throughout the rest of the federal government before the presidential assassination in April 1865. The Supreme Court itself did not opine on the substantive constitutional question, even in the Vallandigham case itself, in which it never reached the merits. The President and his Attorney General, however, did consider the question, and it was a recurrent topic of debate in Congress, too.\n\n1. Attorney General Bates. — Lincoln’s first Attorney General, Edward Bates, was not shy about defending the President’s more aggressive assertions of constitutional authority—including, most famously, the unilateral suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. He drew the line at the War Department’s military commissions, however. Writing in his diary in March 1865, after civil law in Missouri was finally restored, Bates recounted that he had been an insistent opponent of the commissions, which he viewed as a “manifest wrong” aggravated by a “false pretense of lawful authority”:\n\nI have, constantly and openly, held—Officially at Washington and personally, every where—that martial law was not estab­lished in Mo. That the military and provotal government, actually used here, was a bald usurpation of power—and every instance of its exercise, which concerned the civil rights of individuals and the jurisdiction of the Courts, was a manifest wrong, aggravated by the false pretense of lawful authority.\n\nAccording to Bates, he had “always contended that the Law, rightly administered, has amble [sic] power to protect itself, to vindicate the constitution, to uphold the Government and to subdue and punish the public enemy” and that therefore it was “not only a crime, but a gross folly, to break the law, in order to serve or save the country!”\n\nIt is not clear how Bates conveyed his legal views to the President, or to the rest of the cabinet, in the preceding years, while the use of commissions became commonplace. There is no record of any official opinion by the Attorney General on the question; perhaps it is fair to assume that others assiduously avoided asking him for his formal views, for fear of what he would opine. He did make his views publicly known in at least one instance, however: In February 1864, the New York Times published a letter Bates had written five months earlier to a judge in New Mexico, Associate Justice Joseph G. Knapp, in which Bates insisted that certain “arbitrary” military proceedings “ought to be suppressed”—and that he had informed Lincoln of that view:\n\nSIR: Your letter of the 4th August, complaining of military arrests, was slow in [r]eaching me, and then such was the urgent and continued occupation of the President in the great affairs of the Government, that I have not been able until now to fix his attention upon the particular outrage upon you, as your letter makes me believe it to be.\n\nThere seems to be a general and growing disposition of the military, wherever stationed, to engross all power, and to treat the civil Government with contumely, as if the object were to bring it into contempt.\n\nI have delivered my opinion very plainly to the President, and I have reason to hope that he, in the main, concurs with me in believing that those arbitrary proceedings ought to be suppressed.\n\n2. President Lincoln. — As noted above, Lincoln’s September 1862 order expressly authorized the trial by military commission of anyone who was “guilty of any disloyal practice, affording aid and comfort to rebels against the authority of the United States.” The commissions system therefore unquestionably enjoyed Lincoln’s formal imprimatur, at least at that high level of generality. There is reason to believe, however, that Lincoln was never entirely comfortable with the constitutional basis for the way in which those commissions operated in many cases.\n\nFor one thing, in his 1863 letter to Judge Knapp, Attorney General Bates stated that after meeting with the President he had “reason to hope” that Lincoln, “in the main,” shared Bates’s view that at least some “arbitrary” proceedings “ought to be suppressed.” Less ambiguously, in September 1866, after Lincoln’s death, Supreme Court Justice David Davis, the author of the Court’s decision in Milligan, told a Lincoln biographer that he and others had advised Lincoln that the various military trials in the northern and border states, “where the courts were free and untram­meled, were unconstitutional and wrong,” and that the Supreme Court would not sustain them. Davis further represented that he was “fully satisfied . . . that Lincoln was opposed to these military commissions, especially in the Northern States, where everything was open and free.”\n\nSuch secondhand accounts must, of course, be treated with some caution; after all, even if they fairly represented Lincoln’s privately stated views, the President was not willing to express those positions publicly. More telling, then, were Lincoln’s very public responses to the Democratic critics of Vallandigham’s detention and prosecution.\n\nA group of prominent pro-Union New York Democrats wrote to Lincoln in May 1863, enclosing a series of resolutions adopted at one of the “most earnest [meetings] in support of the Union, ever held in [Albany].” Those resolutions “denounce[d]” General Burnside’s treatment of Vallandigham and “demand[ed]” that the Administration “be true to the Constitution” and “exert all its powers to maintain the supremacy of the civil over military law” everywhere outside of the lines of “necessary military occupation and the scenes of insurrection.” The Albany resolutions complained not only about the suspension of habeas corpus, “arbitrary arrests,” and the infringement of freedom of speech, but also about the denial of the civilian trial guarantees of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\n\nLincoln’s response—the famous “Corning Letter” of June 12, 1863, published in many newspapers —was, according to Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, “the most masterly document that ever came from his pen.” The Corning Letter is perhaps best known for two things: First, Lincoln offered a subtle distinction between protected and unprotected speech. If, as the New York Democrats alleged, Vallandigham was seized and tried “for no other reason” than that he criticized the government and condemned Burnside’s order, “then I concede that the arrest was wrong,” wrote Lincoln; in that case, “his arrest was made on mistake of fact, which I would be glad to correct, on reasonably satisfactory evidence.” As Lincoln understood the case, however, Burnside arrested Vallandigham because he “was laboring, with some effect, to prevent the raising of troops, to encourage desertions from the army, and to leave the rebellion without an adequate military force to suppress it.” If that was his aim, reasoned Lincoln, then “[h]e was warring upon the military; and this gave the military constitutional jurisdiction to lay hands upon him.”\n\nSecond, Lincoln made an impassioned defense of the view, which he had been asserting from early in the war, that the constitutional power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, when “in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it,” also includes the ancillary power to detain those who may not lawfully petition the courts for relief from military detention. “[S]uspension is allowed by the constitution on purpose that, men may be arrested and held, who can not be proved to be guilty of defined crime, ‘when, in cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.’” Moreover, according to Lincoln the Suspension Clause permits such arrests to be “made, not so much for what has been done, as for what probably would be done”—for “preventive” rather than “vindictive” purposes, and thus before the commission of any offense. “Of how little value the constitutional provision I have quoted will be rendered, if arrests shall never be made until defined crimes shall have been committed . . . .”\n\nWhatever the merits of these arguments about free speech and the office of the suspension power, they were unresponsive to another aspect of the Democrats’ objections—the fact that Vallandigham not only was arrested and detained but also subjected to a military trial, sentenced for his delicts, and ultimately banished, on Lincoln’s order, to the South. In the Corning Letter, Lincoln acknowledged that the Albany resolutions had also complained about the circumvention of the Treason Clause and the denial of the jury protections of the Constitution. The President proffered a modest, but hardly compelling, response to this argument: Civil courts, wrote Lincoln, were inadequate to adjudicate crimes in wartime cases involving enemy “sympathizers [who] pervaded all depart­ments of the government, and nearly all communities of the people.” “Nothing is better known to history,” he wrote, “than that courts of justice are utterly incompetent to such cases.” Juries in such a heated environment, he complained, “too frequently have at least one member, more ready to hang the panel than to hang the traitor.” Lincoln presumably recognized that this basic distrust in the jury system was hardly an adequate justification for a military criminal trial—especially if the arrested individuals could be detained in any event. Thus, he fell back on a remarkable, alternative argument—that the arrests were not made “to hold persons to answer for any capital, or otherwise infamous crimes” and that the military commission proceedings were not, “in any constitutional or legal sense, ‘criminal prossecutions’” at all!\n\nLincoln left that thought hanging—in the Corning Letter he did not further elaborate on the purpose of the commission trial if, as he insinuated, it was not for criminal prosecution and punishment.\n\nAt this point, Democrats in Ohio, meeting in Columbus, actually nominated the exiled Vallandigham as their candidate for governor; moreover, like the New York Democrats, they passed resolves condemn­ing his military trial and punishment, including his banishment. The Ohio Democrats took sharp issue with Lincoln’s view, in the Corning Letter, that the authority to suspend habeas includes a power to arrest and detain: Even when there is a habeas suspension, they insisted, “the other guaranties of personal liberty . . . remain unchanged.” Lincoln agreed to meet with the Ohio Democrats when they visited Washington on June 25. On June 29, he wrote them a letter—commonly known as the “Birchard Letter”—responding to the points they had made at the meeting in Washington.\n\nIt appears that the Ohio Democrats pressed Lincoln, at their meeting, on how he could justify a military trial, in addition to the arrest and detention, of Vallandigham and similar military defendants, for Lincoln devoted a full paragraph of the Birchard Letter to the question. In that paragraph, Lincoln elaborated on what the Corning Letter had merely implied:\n\nThe earnestness with which you insist that persons can only, in times of rebellion, be lawfully dealt with, in accordance with the rules for criminal trials and punishments in times of peace, induces me to add a word to what I said on that point, in the Albany response. You claim that men may, if they choose, embarrass those whose duty it is, to combat a giant rebellion, and then be dealt with in turn, only as if there was no rebellion. The constitution itself rejects this view. The military arrests and detentions, which have been made, including those of Mr. V. which are not different in principle from the others, have been for prevention, and not for punishment—as injunctions to stay injury, as proceedings to keep the peace—and hence, like proceedings in such cases, and for like reasons, they have not been accompanied with indictments, or trials by juries, nor, in a single case by any punishment whatever, beyond what is purely incidental to the prevention. The original sentence of imprisonment in Mr. V.’s case, was to prevent injury to the Military service only, and the modification of it [i.e., Lincoln’s banishment order] was made as a less disagreeable mode to him, of securing the same prevention.\n\nLincoln argued, in other words, not only that “military arrests and detentions” were preventive rather than punitive, but that the commission proceedings and sentences were, too; he insisted that the function of such trials was merely to identify persons who, like prisoners of war, should be incapacitated for the duration of the war, so that they could no longer undermine the war effort.\n\nThere was at least a smidgen of truth in what Lincoln suggested: In many commissions cases, Vallandigham’s included, the sentences ap­peared to be tailored to the aim of wartime incapacitation, such as a term of confinement (or, here, exile) limited to the duration of the conflict. Even so, the idea that the military commission proceedings were not punitive in nature, designed to impose punishment for criminal wrong­doing, was untenable, as Lincoln must have known and as the Ohio Democrats pointedly noted in their response on July 1. The War Department regularly referred to the punitive nature of the proceedings, beginning in Halleck’s very first order in December 1861, in which he wrote that those committing hostilities “will be held and punished as criminals,” and continuing right through to Holt’s final, extended defense of the commissions in November 1865, in which he explained that they were “indispensable for the punishment of public crimes” and had been a “powerful and efficacious instrumentality . . . for the bringing to justice of a large class of malefactors . . . who otherwise would have altogether escaped punishment.” More importantly, Lincoln’s own actions betrayed his understanding that the commission trials were, indeed, punitive in character: Although Lincoln himself sometimes commuted death sentences to confinement for the duration of the war, he also regularly approved death sentences, as well as fixed terms of confinement that might have easily extended beyond the conflict’s end. Recall, as well, that back in September 1862, when Lincoln authorized military tribunals to deal with persons engaged in disloyal conduct throughout the United States, he wrote that such persons were to be “liable to trial and punishment by courts-martial or military commission.”\n\nLincoln, then, was undoubtedly aware that the military commissions proceedings were, at least in part, punitive in nature, designed to adjudicate whether the accused was guilty of an offense. That Lincoln had to deny, or obscure, such an obvious truth in order to offer even a superficially plausible account of why such military justice fell outside the guarantees of Article III and the Bill of Rights reveals his probable doubts about the commissions’ constitutionality. Lincoln was one of the greatest constitutional lawyers of his (or any) time. The fact that even he could not justify military courts except by denying their punitive nature—in the course of his otherwise robust and unapologetic public defenses of the military’s role in suppressing disloyal conduct in the North—suggests that perhaps Bates and Davis were correct: Maybe Lincoln was “opposed to these military commissions, especially in the Northern States, where everything was open and free,” although he did not have the courage or wherewithal to say so while the war was in full flower. As Mark Neely has surmised, “He must have hoped [the military commission system’s] disappearance at war’s end would erase the military trials of civilians from national memory.”\n\nIn any case, Lincoln’s sweeping 1862 authorization of military tribunals for civil offenses, and his own personal complicity thereafter in the machinery of such Article I courts, has hardly withstood the test of time as an executive precedent worthy of respect, even among those who generally admire Lincoln.\n\n3. Congress. — On at least three occasions between March 1863 and March 1865, Congress confronted the question of the legality of the War Department’s system of military commissions. The legislature, not sur­prisingly, was not of a single mind about the constitutional question, and the results of its debates were decidedly ambiguous. At a minimum, how­ever, it is fair to say that the Thirty-Seventh and Thirty-Eighth Congresses recognized, and agonized about, the seriousness of the constitutional concerns, even if they did not ultimately resolve them.\n\na. The Habeas Act of 1863. — The Habeas Act of 1863 is best remembered for Congress’s ratification of President’s Lincoln’s authority to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus “whenever, in his judgment, the public safety may require it, . . . in any case throughout the United States, or any part thereof.” Less well known is that the Act was a compromise, of sorts, as a more comprehensive reading of the text reveals: On the one hand, it permitted the President to suspend habeas and thereby (at least) remove judicial supervision of the individuals who were being preventively detained by the military on a temporary basis. Its other provisions, however, were designed to guarantee that such deten­tion would not be unregulated, unreviewable, or indefinite and to further guarantee the primacy of civilian courts for any criminal prose­cutions. Section 2 of the Act directed the Secretaries of State and War to furnish federal courts a list of all persons within their jurisdictions who were “citizens of states in which the administration of the laws has continued unimpaired in the said Federal courts” and who were being held by the military “otherwise than as prisoners of war.” If the grand jury in a particular federal district then terminated its session without indicting a person whose name appeared on one of those prisoner lists, the Act required a judge of that court to discharge the person, so long as the detainee first swore an oath of allegiance to the Union. Section 3 of the Act further provided that if the Secretaries, for whatever reaso"
