Black\n\nNovember 15, 1947 – December 14, 2020\n\n. . . as “Poppy” to his beloved grandchildren, some things must remain a secret.\n\nMemorial Service: April 24, 2021 Baker-Swan Funeral Home, Andover\n\nRobert E. “Bob” Black, 73, died at home on Monday (Dec. 14, 2020) after battling cancer for five weeks.\n\nMr. Black was born on Nov. 15, 1947 in Wellsville to Robert L. and Grace M. (Smith) Black. He was a 1966 graduate of Scio Central School and later served in the United States Army from 1967-1970 with a tour in Germany. After his army tour, he started working at Big N in Hornell where he met Joanne M. Criss. They were married a year later in St. Ann’s Church in Hornell on Oct. 14, 1972. They settled in Andover shortly thereafter, much to Bob’s surprise since Scio and Andover were such rivals in sports.\n\nBob worked as an inspector at Dresser-Rand Corp. for 40 years, retiring in 2013.\n\nIn addition to his wife of 48 years, Bob is survived by two sons, Jason (Becky) Black of Manchester and Andrew Black of Andover; two brothers-in-law, Robert Frost of Dundee and James (Tammy) Criss of Arkport; a sister-in-law, Linda (Thomas) Harding of Webster; three grandchildren, Olivia Black, Sydney Black and Landon Black; his dear friend and co-worker at Dresser for many years, Bob Shelly; and several nieces, nephews and cousins.\n\nIn addition to his parents, he was predeceased by a sister, Roberta Frost; two brothers, David Black and Daniel “Danny” Black; a baby sister, Madelene Black; and his precious grandson, Emerson Robert Black at six weeks.\n\nBob was very involved in community activities. He served on the Andover 4th of July and Andover Haunted House Committee’s for 25 years. He also served on the Andover Central School Board for four years and attended many marching band events.\n\nBob was an active member of Andover Historical Society and Andover Golden Agers. He played Santa’s Helper for over 40 years but as “Poppy” to his beloved grandchildren, some things must remain a secret. He was a long-time member of Blessed Sacrament Church where he belonged to the Blessed Sacrament Choir and Andover Ecumenical Choir.\n\nAs a patriotic American, on September 11th, Bob, along with his son, Andrew and his grandnephew, Brandon Brown, placed an American flag at every residence in Andover. He truly became Andover’s adopted native son. Additionally, Bob was an avid Buffalo Bill’s and Sabre’s fan and actively rooted for the St. Bonaventure Bonnies.\n\nDue to Covid-19 concerns, there will be no visitation at this time. A memorial service will be held in the spring at a date to be announced. Burial with full military honors will follow in Hillside Cemetery in Andover. Arrangements are under the direction of Baker-Swan Funeral Home and online condolences may be offered at www.baker-swan.com.\n\n​In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions in Bob’s name may be made to Andover Ambulance Corps, P. O. Box 726, Andover, NY 14806 or to SPCA Serving Allegany County, PO Box 381, Wellsville NY 14895.\n\nMyron G. Zimmerman\n\nFebruary 27, 1931 – August 22, 2015\n\nMyron’s life was marked by his love for the Lord.\n\nFuneral Service: Tuesday, August 25, 2015 11:00 a.m. First United Methodist Church Wellsville\n\nMyron G. Zimmerman, 84, formerly of Tonawanda, entered into the presence of his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ on Saturday (Aug. 22, 2015) at Strong Memorial Hospital.\n\nMr. Zimmerman was born on Feb. 27, 1931 in North Tonawanda to Myron D. and Elsie (Krupp) Zimmerman. He was a 1951 graduate of Kenmore West High School and later served in the U.S. Army from 1952-54. On May 7, 1955, at the Kenmore Presbyterian Church, he married Mary P. Reeser, who survives.\n\nMyron worked as a cabinet maker; working out of the Buffalo Carpenters District Union #276 in Buffalo for 40 years, until his retirement in 1989.\n\nIn addition to his wife of 60 years, Myron is survived by three sons, Myron R. (Diane) Zimmerman of Lake Wales, Fla., Mark K. (Susan) Zimmerman of Scio and Dale A. (Vicki) Zimmerman of Lockport; one daughter, Sandara L. (Paul) Rog of Webster, Fla.; one sister, Carol Zarbo of Kenmore; 7 grandchildren; 7 great grandchildren; and several nieces, nephews and cousins.\n\nHe was predeceased by one brother, Roger Zimmerman.\n\nMyron’s life was marked by his love for the Lord. As a born again Christian, everything he did and said reflected that relationship he had with Christ. He enjoyed working with his hands and perfecting the craft of woodworking and cabinetry. Myron was especially fond of watching cowboy and western movies. Additionally, he was an avid trap and skeet shooter which fit nicely with his love for hunting and enjoyment of the outdoors. Myron was a life member of the Tonawanda Sportsmen’s Club and was also a member of the Friendship American Legion.\n\nThere will be no prior visitation. The funeral service will be held on Tuesday at 11:00 a.m. at the Wellsville United Methodist Church with Rev. Gregory B. DeSalvatore, officiating. Immediately following the funeral service, full military honors will be rendered. Burial at the Elm Lawn Cemetery in Tonawanda will be at the convenience of the family.\n\nDiane K.

She enjoyed crocheting and knitting baby blankets and booties to give as love gifts for the many babies she encountered in her large circle of friends. She enjoyed going to craft shows as a favorite pastime as well as getting new ideas for her own creative gift ideas. Diane had a large collection of dolls that she proudly displayed throughout her home. Additionally, she was a lifetime lover of animals, especially dogs.\n\nIn her younger days, Diane and her husband enjoyed camping together. Some of their favorite memories were the times spent in Ogdensburg and 1000 Islands fishing, boating and touring the Eisenhower Lock at Massena on the Saint Lawrence Seaway.
