        "text": "Projections by John Boorman (Editor); Walter Donohue (Editor)\n\nCall Number: General Stacks PN1994 .P718 1992\n\nISBN: 0571167292\n\nThe first issue includes a journal compiled by John Boorman which records his responses to the events and trends of 1991, and their implications for the future of cinema. Like his Emerald Forest diary, Money into Light, it is a fascinating mix of anecdote, personal reflections, thoughts on the nature of cinema, and comments on the practical business of making films. Projections also contains contributions from cinematographer Nestor Almendros, who describes the craft of photographing the human face, and from Jonathan Demme, who traces the evolution of his career from his early days with Roger Corman to his chilling Silence of the Lambs. River Phoenix and Gus Van Sant discuss their work together on My Own Private Idaho; there is a script from one of the most original talents in American today, Hal Hartley, and a penetrating account by director Michael Mann of his startling new version of Last of the Mohicans.\n\nProjections 2 by John Boorman (Editor); Walter Donohue (Editor)\n\nCall Number: General Stacks PN1995.9.P7 P75 1993\n\nISBN: 9780571168286\n\nProjections 2 highlights Robert Altman, whose film The Player restored him to his proper place in cinema's pantheon. Actor Tim Robbins, who memorably incarnated Griffin Mill in The Player, has written, directed and acted in Bob Roberts, the script of which is printed here in full. And another actor, Willem Dafoe, describes how he approaches his craft. There are also pieces by Belgian director Jaco van Dormael, New Zealand director Alison Maclean and Australian director George Miller, who charts the journey he has made from Mad Max to the (then) eagerly awaited Lorenzo's Oil. Finally, Bertrand Tavernier's diary records the evolution of his controversial film L627 against the shifting European cultural landscape.\n\nProjections 3 by John Boorman (Editor); Walter Donohue (Editor)\n\nCall Number: General Stacks PN1993 .P78\n\nISBN: 0571170471\n\nThe centrepiece of this issue is the journals of Francis Ford Coppola, whose films, such as the Godfather trilogy and Apocalypse Now, are considered masterworks of contemporary cinema. This volume also contains articles by leading film-makers about the state of the art at this moment. Included in this volume: Francis Ford Coppola - Journals 1989-1993 Chen Kaige on Chinese Cinema Sydney Pollack on Directing Actors Allan Starski - Art Direction: Wajda to Spielberg Hal Willner - Making Music for Short Cuts Michael Almereyda on Pixelvision Kasdan on Kasdan Michael Tolkin on Screenwriting Art Linson on Producing Quentin Tarantino - The Director as Writer Sally Potter - Orlando Diary Gus Van Sant on Hollywood Richard Stanley - Dust Devil Diary Hal Hartley - Flirt Zrinko Ogresta - Cry from Croatia.\n\nProjections 4 1/2 by John Boorman; Walter Donohue\n\nCall Number: General Stacks PN1993 .P78\n\nISBN: 0571176097\n\nWhen the door of the Lumiere factory opened to release the workers, it was more than just the end of the day - it was the beginning of a brand new art form that has shaped the consciousness of the twentieth century. This very first moment of the very first film gave birth to other moments that are cherished in the recollections of people all over the world. In this issue we collaborated with the French film magazine Positif. The centrepiece of this issue came to us from Positif. For their 400th issue Positif asked the film-makers with whom they had forged a special relationship over the past forty years to write about the films, directors and actors who have had a special significance for them. An array of seventy international film-makers - including Altman and Angelopoulos, Chabrol and the Coens, Eastwood and Frears, Kazan and Kieslowski, Leigh and Loach, Makavejev and Marker, Ophuls and Penn, Resnais and Rohmer, Rosi and Rudolph, Tavernier and the Tavianis, Varda and Zulawski, among others - responded, and we present this treasure trove of film-making comment as a way of celebrating the 100 years of cinema. 1995 was also the centenary of Buster Keaton. In honour of this, Kevin Brownlow - noted film-maker, historian and restorer of the silent cinema - recounts the making of Keaton's masterpiece, The General.\n\nProjections 4 by John Boorman (Editor); Walter Donahue (Editor); Tom Luddy (Editor); David Thompson (Editor)\n\nCall Number: General Stacks PN1993 .P78\n\nISBN: 0571173632\n\nProjections is a forum for film-makers in which the practitioners of cinema write about their craft.

There is also an interview with the American animator, Henry Selick, creator of The Nightmare Before Christmas, and a piece about the founding figure of stop-motion animated film, Ray Harryhausen.

Critics themselves are asked what they think about the state of film criticism and their relationship and responsibility to film and film-makers, and what they dream about. And film-makers are asked about how they regard the critics. This issue also contains articles and interviews with practitioners of film, including a diary from the set of the Coen brothers' film, The Big Lebowski, and a conversation with Michael Ondaatje, editor of The English Patient.\n\nProjections 11 by Tod Lippy (Editor); John Boorman (Editor); Walter Donohue (Editor)\n\nCall Number: General Stacks PN1993.5.U77 P76\n\nISBN: 9780571205912\n\nWhy live and work as a film-maker in New York rather than Hollywood? The birthplace of US cinema, New York has played a hugely influential role in its evolution - particularly in the realm of more personal, 'independent' film-making of figures from Sam Fuller to John Cassavetes. Now Projections 11 seeks to answer Mike Figgis' Los Angeles issue Projections 10 by interviewing film-makers who base themselves in New York, creating an East coast alternative to Hollywood. Tod Lippy speaks to Spike Lee, Jim Jarmusch, Sidney Lumet, Christine Vachon, David O. Russell, Nora Ephron, Tim Robbins, Frances McDormand, and many others."
