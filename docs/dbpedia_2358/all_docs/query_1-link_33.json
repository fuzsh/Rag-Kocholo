        "text": "Visual Studies Workshop has held innovative exhibitions in photography, film, video, artists books and interdisciplinary art since 1970. This is a timeline of exhibitions programmed between 1970 to 2011. Exhibitions before 1978 were held at VSW’s first location, 4 Elton Street, Rochester, New York, and exhibitions after were held at VSW’s 31 Prince Street location. This timeline covers a wide variety of types of exhibitions, including media installations, solo and group photo and bookworks exhibitions, and video art broadcasts. For more recent exhibitions, click here.\n\n1970\n\nThe first formal space devoted to exhibitions at the Workshop at 4 Elton St. was a small hallway space which was converted into an exhibition gallery in 1970. The Slightly Sloping Gallery opened on March 20, 1970 with a fundraising exhibition titled “Photographs for Sale.” The Slightly Sloping Gallery was then used as a training space for museum studies students to gain the actual experience of planning, displaying and promoting exhibitions, and as a space to display exhibitions of VSW student’s work.\n\n• Photographs for Sale: A Print Sale in Support of the Photographic Studies Workshop, Rochester, N.Y One of eight simultaneous sales in galleries around the country held to raise funds for the new Workshop.\n\n• Found Photographs: Snapshots selected by seven members of the Photographic Studies Workshop: Paul Baron, James Borcoman, Diana Edkins, Bill Jenkins, Dennis Longwell, John Witter and Anne Tucker, chairman.\n\n• Dave Brown: Images of Chicago, New York, Paraguay and Rochester\n\n• Joel Swartz: Xerox Prints\n\n• Gary Metz: Plastic Love Dream\n\n• Eric Renner: Photographs of Tical\n\n• Colored Photographs curated by Anne Tucker\n\n• Alice Wells: Found Moments Transformed/The Re-exploration of a series of glass plates\n\n• Traveling Exhibitions Program\n\nAlmost immediately after founding the Workshop in 1969 Nathan Lyons reinitiated an exhibition rental program that he had inaugurated at the George Eastman House in the mid 1960s. The Workshop soon announced that the proceeds from the “Photographs for Sale” exhibition had allowed the Travelling Exhibitions Program to organize the first four exhibitions and that they were available for rental in March 1970. Brent Sikkema was the first coordinator of these exhibitions programs. This Traveling Exhibition Service was initiated before the Workshop itself had any space sufficiently large to display these same exhibitions. Thus some of the first exhibitions organized at the Workshop were traveling exhibitions, rented to other institutions. Some of these exhibitions traveled for a few years, some traveled for several decades, and were seen by thousands of people all over the country. The first four traveling exhibitions were:\n\n• John Wood\n\n•Alice Wells: Found Moments Transformed\n\n• Lee Friedlander & Jim Dine: Work from the Same House Portfolio\n\n• Eikoh Hosoe: Kamaitachi, An Extravagantly Tragic Comedy\n\n1971\n\nFour additional exhibitions were added to the traveling exhibitions program.\n\n• Ralph Eugene Meatyard\n\n• Todd Walker\n\n• Robert Fichter\n\n• Donald Blumberg: Daily News\n\n1972/1973\n\nAdditional traveling exhibitions included:\n\n• Les Krims\n\n• Nathan Lyons: Notations In Passing\n\n• Tony Ray-Jones\n\n• Kenneth Josephson\n\n1974/1975\n\nSeven new traveling exhibitions were available for rental. For the first time, these included some group shows.\n\n• Walter Chappell\n\n• Sonia Sheridan: The Inner Landscape and the Machine\n\n• Michael Bishop, Darryl Curran, William G. Larson, Keith Smith\n\n• Robert Flick, Allen Dutton, Bart Parker\n\n• Jerry Burchard, Mark Cohen, Gary Hallman, Roger Mertin\n\n• Linda Connor, Jim Raymo, Carl Toth, Joan Redmond\n\n• The First Traveling Offset Rip-Off Show, which consisted of 20 pads of offset lithograph prints by 20 artists, which could be removed and taken at will by the renting gallery’s viewers. The participating artists in this unusual exhibition were Michael Bishop, Leif Brush, Eileen Cowin, Robert Fichter, Robert Heinecken, Scott Hyde, Syl Labrot, Joan Lyons, Cynthia Marsh, Bea Nettles, Tony Petracca, Sonia Sheridan, Keith Smith, Harland Snodgrass, Michael Sowden, Joel Swartz, Charles Swedland, Todd Walker, Barbara Wilson and John Wood.\n\n1975\n\nIn 1975, a room in the expanded area of the Workshop at 4 Elton St. was refurbished and The Workshop Gallery or The Visual Studies Workshop Gallery or the Main Gallery was opened on Jan. 17, 1975 with a group exhibition. By April 1976, exhibitions organized for the traveling exhibitions program also began to be displayed at the Workshop, in the Main Gallery or in the Slightly Sloping Gallery, either before they began to travel, or at some convenient time in the schedule.\n\n• Group Exhibition: Walter Chappell, Max Hein, Joseph Jachna, Ken Josephson, Roger Mertin, Bart Parker, Sonia Sheridan, John Wood (Main Gallery)\n\n• Gravure Prints by Edward Curtis, Lithographs by Eadweard Muybridge (Main Gallery) Curated by Paul Gandel\n\n• The Great American Waistland Buckle Show: Photographic Belt Buckles by Dave Brown and Joe Denaro (Slightly Sloping Gallery)\n\n• Photographs: Doug Baz, Lyn Mandelbaum, Joan Redmond, Jeff Silverthorne, John Spence (Main Gallery)\n\n• Recent Polariod SX-70 Work by Les Krims (Main Gallery)\n\n• Sixteen Studies of Vegetable Locomotion by Marion Faller and Hollis Frampton (Main Gallery) Apparently there was also a “Live video performance” by Louise Etra, Bill Etra and Peter Crown offered at some point during these exhibitions.\n\n• The Visual Studies Workshop Summer Exhibition: Carol Drobek, Allen Dutton, Marion Giacomelli, Bruce Horowitz, Syl Labrot, Richard Link, Joan Lyons, Ray Metsker, Timo Pajunen, Eric Renner, Murray Riss, Joel Swartz, Charles Traub, Todd Walker, Henry Wessell, Jr. (Main Gallery)\n\n• Young British Photographers: John Wall, Valerie Wilmer, Brian Griffin, Chris Steele-Perkins, Paddy Summerfield, Larry Herman, Homer Sykes, John Webb, Ron McCormick, Neil Gulliver, Richard Wood, Simon Marsden, Mark Edwards, Paul Hill (Main Gallery)\n\n• Photographs by Jacques-Henri Lartigue (Main Gallery)\n\n• Etchings by Vera Berdich (Slightly Sloping Gallery)\n\n• Photographs by Linda Connor, John Divola, and Eric Renner\n\n1976\n\n• Anonymous Lantern Slides (Main Gallery)\n\n• Stroboscopic Photographics by Dr. Harold E.

There were no exhibitions held by the Workshop from December 1977 until October 1978, while new exhibition spaces were being organized and renovated. The initial location of the Workshop Gallery was in two conjoined rooms on the ground floor of the front building. These rooms housed the Sales Gallery and the Main Exhibition Gallery. The Bookstore (and the Bookstore Gallery) was in a third, adjacent, room. The hallway on the second floor of the front building was used as the Research Center Gallery. Later, temporary walls were constructed in the auditorium on the ground floor of the front building, turning that area into the main exhibition gallery. Even later, the top floor of the back building was renovated and it held the Main or Workshop Gallery, the Sales Gallery, and the Bookstore. Charles Stainback, who took over the role of coordinator of exhibitions in 1977, is first listed as coordinator of the exhibitions program in publicity announcements for the Blondeau show.\n\nDuring the interval as the Workshop moved, a new Traveling Exhibitions catalog printed in 1977 lists twelve previous exhibitions, one new group show, “Fichter, Walker, Wood,” which seems to have been combined from three earlier one-man exhibitions, and three new exhibitions. Two of these consist of the work of then contemporary but recently deceased photographer Barbara Blondeau, whose archive was in the VSW Research Center collections, and the first historical survey exhibition on the work of the New York Photo League from the 1930s and 1940s. Anne Tucker was the guest curator for the Photo League exhibition.\n\n• Murry Riis\n\n• Fichter, Walker, Wood\n\n• The Photo League\n\n• Barbara Blondeau\n\n• Selected Photographs, Paul Diamond, John Wood, Tom Gibson, Bruce Horowitz, Bart Parker, John Pfahl, Ken Josephson, Keith Smith, Henry Wessel, Jr., Bonnie Gordon, Joseph Jachna (on site at VSW, Main Gallery)\n\n• Impressions of Cuba 1977, Seven Photographers: Harvey Finkle, Rene Gelpi, Susan Meiselas, William Price, Mel Rosenthal, Ede Rothaus, Frank Stewart (Upstairs Hall Gallery) Part of a program “Photography and Community” including weekend workshops, lectures, and seminars at various institutes around Rochester during October and November, with three exhibitions throughout the city. Co-sponsored by the Bilingual Academy of Fine Arts and Cultural Development, the Community Education Center, Empire State College, the Puerto Rican Cultural Center and Rochester Institute of Technology. One co-coordinater of this program was Leslie Locketz, formerly a student at the Visual Studies Workshop, and she most likely was the facilitator of this exhibition.\n\n• Roger Mertin: Photographs\n\n1979\n\n• Xerox Drawings and Lithographs by Joan Lyons\n\n• Drawings and Photographs by Eric Renner\n\n• Photographic Crossroads: The Photo League, guest curator Anne Tucker.
