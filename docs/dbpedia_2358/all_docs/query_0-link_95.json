The period beginning with the stock market crash in October 1929, until the commencement of WW II in late 1939, was dismal at best. These hard times became known as “The Depression”. In 1933, President-elect, Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945) and Congress created legislation to provide relief from this economic calamity through programs of agriculture and business regulation, inflation, price stabilization, and public works. Some of the more familiar New Deal programs were: the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC); the Public Works Administration; Tennessee Valley Authority; the Works Progress Administration, the Social Security System; the Federal Communications Commission; and the Security and Exchange Commission.\n\nLocally, the community benefited from several of these government induced economic programs. In 1933, the Civil Works Administration had over two hundred men employed in mosquito control, oyster planting, and street and public building beatification. In 1933, the Anderson brothers of Shearwater Pottery were selected by Chairman Elsworth Woodward of the Region Six Public Works of Art Project, to create murals for the Ocean Springs Public School.

In 1932, Dr. Powell’s Bayou Inn, became the Fort Bayou estate of Emma M. Logan of Shreveport, Louisiana.\n\nLurline Shrieber Hall who grew up in Ocean Springs on East Porter during the Depression remembers these difficult times well. Her recollection follows: In 1929, came the crash although we did not feel it until later. I remember going uptown, probably to Gottsche’s Store for Mama and coming home with the news that the Farmers and Merchants Bank had closed. I wanted to know if we had lost our money and she said our money (what little we had) was in the other bank (Ocean Springs State Bank). In 1930, the truth began to come out. They were called the “Troubled Thirties”, and “Brother, can you spare a dime?” was the password. Mr. Gottsche put a sign in his front window-“NRA-We Do Our Part”. Those fortunate to own a radio listened to Amos n’ Andy”, Kate Smith, Walter Winchell, Eddie Cantor, and Rudy Vallee. We read cartoons such as, “Little Orphan Annie”, “Gasoline Alley”, and “Dick Tracy”. When our folks could “spare a dime”, we went to the picture show to see the Marx Brothers, Bella Lugosi, as Count Dracula, and the giant gorilla, King Kong, and any and all musicals. Then came the New Deal when Roosevelt was elected. The Civil Works Administration (CWA) hit Ocean Springs and later the Works Progress Administration (WPA). That perked the town up enough to tide us over until WW II.(Lurline Schrieber Hall, letter dated June 11 ,1999 from Letohatchie, Alabama)\n\nThe decade saw a major technological advance in 1939, when a German made the first rocket powered flight and the jet propulsion engine to power an aircraft was developed by an American.\n\n1930\n\nPopulation of Ocean Springs 1663 people.[Bellande counts 1638 with 1280 white and 358 black].(The Jackson County Times, June 22, 1940, p. 1)\n\nThe Ocean Springs City government set annual water rates for 1930 as follows: one faucet-$9; 2nd faucet-$2; each additional faucet-$.75.
