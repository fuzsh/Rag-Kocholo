        "text": "Conservative Fountain Hills Town Council member Hannah Toth touts her employment as a \"voter analyst\" at Turning Point Action, a political action committee which is described on its website as an \"affiliate\" of Turning Point USA.\n\nBoth were founded by right-wing extremist Charlie Kirk. State Representative Austin Smith, identified as TPA's senior director, resigned from TPA on April 18 after being implicated in a voter fraud scheme. Apparently TPA's voter strategy, in which Smith reportedly participated, included placing fraudulent signatures on election petitions.\n\nThis was quickly followed on April 27 by identification in The Washington Post and elsewhere of the indictments of \"Tyler Bowyer, a Republican national committeeman from Arizona and chief operating officer of the pro-Trump conservative group Turning Point Action,\" along with Mark Meadows and Rudy Giuliani, “in connection with their alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Arizona.”"
