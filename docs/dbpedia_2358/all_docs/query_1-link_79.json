Increasing preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that pharmacological treatments including cognitive enhancers, when given as adjuncts to psychotherapeutic approaches [cognitive behavioral therapy including extinction-based exposure therapy] enhance treatment efficacy, while using anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines as adjuncts can undermine long-term treatment success. The purpose of this review is to outline the literature showing how pharmacological interventions targeting neurotransmitter systems including serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, histamine, glutamate, GABA, cannabinoids, neuropeptides (oxytocin, neuropeptides Y and S, opioids) and other targets (neurotrophins BDNF and FGF2, glucocorticoids, L-type-calcium channels, epigenetic modifications) as well as their downstream signaling pathways, can augment fear extinction and strengthen extinction memory persistently in preclinical models. Particularly promising approaches are discussed in regard to their effects on specific aspects of fear extinction namely, acquisition, consolidation and retrieval, including long-term protection from return of fear (relapse) phenomena like spontaneous recovery, reinstatement and renewal of fear. We also highlight the promising translational value of the preclinial research and the clinical potential of targeting certain neurochemical systems with, for example d-cycloserine, yohimbine, cortisol, and L-DOPA. The current body of research reveals important new insights into the neurobiology and neurochemistry of fear extinction and holds significant promise for pharmacologically-augmented psychotherapy as an improved approach to treat trauma and anxiety-related disorders in a more efficient and persistent way promoting enhanced symptom remission and recovery.\n\nKeywords: Fear extinction, Exposure therapy, Augmented relearning, Reconsolidation, Drug development, Cognitive enhancer\n\n1. Introduction\n\nFear, anxiety and trauma-related disorders are associated with excessive fear reactions triggered by specific objects, situations or internal and external cues in the absence of any actual danger, and often include an inability to extinguish learned fear and to show adequate safety learning [(Jovanovic et al., 2012; Michael et al., 2007; Milad et al., 2009; Milad et al., 2013; Wessa & Flor, 2007) reviewed in (Holmes & Singewald, 2013) and (Kong et al., 2014)]. Pathological fear and anxiety occur in a range of psychiatric conditions, including various types of phobia (e.g. social phobia, agoraphobia or specific phobia), panic disorder with/without agoraphobia, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety (GAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (DSM-5, 2013; ICD-10, 1994). These disorders comprise the most common mental disorders and are estimated to have a life-time prevalence of up to 28% among western populations (Kessler et al., 2005; Kessler et al., 2012; Wittchen et al., 2011). In addition to the personal suffering of patients, the economic burden caused by anxiety disorders is heavy (Gustavsson et al., 2011).\n\nAvailable pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments (Bandelow et al., 2007) which aim to reduce fear and anxiety are associated with decreased symptom severity, but up to 40% of anxiety patients show only partial long-term benefit, and a majority of them fail to achieve complete remission (Bandelow et al., 2012; Hoffman & Mathew, 2008; Stein et al., 2009) clearly underlining the need for further improvement. Current pharmacological approaches either induce rapid anxiolytic effects (e.g. benzodiazepines, some antipsychotics) or require prolonged, chronic treatment (e.g. antidepressants) to attenuate symptoms of pathological fear and anxiety. Commonly employed psychotherapeutic interventions apply cognitive behavioral strategies and exposure techniques to help patients overcome the maladaptive beliefs and avoidance behaviors that reinforce the pathology related to fear-eliciting cues. Meta-analyses show that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) does have efficacy for several anxiety disorders, including PTSD, but patients have difficulty bearing the demanding and exhausting process of therapy and many who do manage to cope with it respond only partially and often relapse with time (Choy et al., 2007).\n\nOne strategy to improve CBT is to augment psychotherapy with ad-junctive pharmacological treatments. Early attempts at combining ‘CBT’ with anxiolytic medications [e.g. benzodiazepines (BZD)] showed that the combination was no more effective [in some instances even counterproductive (Marks et al., 1993; Wilhelm & Roth, 1997)] than psycho- or pharmacotherapy alone [for details see (Dunlop et al., 2012; Hofmann, 2012; Otto et al., 2010a,b; Rodrigues et al., 2011)]. However, at least in some cases, this failure may have reflected idiosyncratic effects of the drugs tested (especially BZDs) rather than utility of the strategy itself, and there has been an intense search to identify agents that serve as more effective adjuncts to CBT. The preclinical assay most frequently used in this search is fear extinction – the focus of this current review. Extinction of fear following Pavlovian fear learning (Pavlov, 1927) in animals is procedurally similar to exposure-based CBT (Milad & Quirk, 2012). We will briefly outline different aspects of Pavlovian fear learning [ (which is thought to be involved in the etiology and maintenance of anxiety disorders, e.g. (Amstadter et al., 2009)] and extinction highlighting the key processes that could be targeted to augment fear extinction (see for an overview).\n\n1.1. Fear and fear extinction\n\nExperimentally, fear conditioning occurs when a previously neutral stimulus [conditioned stimulus (CS) – such as a tone or light] is paired with an aversive, unconditioned stimulus (US – e.g. electric shock to the forearm in humans, mild foot shock in rodents), resulting in a CS-US association whereby the CS alone elicits a conditioned fear response (e.g. freezing in rodents or increased skin conductance in humans). Following a successful CS–US association, fear memories require consolidation, a process involving a cascade of molecular and cellular events that alter synaptic efficacy, as well as a prolonged systems level interaction between brain regions, to stabilize the memory (McGaugh, 2000). Once consolidated, fear memories, reactivated by presenting the CS, are destabilized to render the original fear memory liable to pharmacological/ behavioral interference (see overview in ) and this is then followed by a second phase of molecular and cellular events to re-stabilize (re-consolidate) the (adapted) memory (Nader et al., 2000).\n\nFear memories can be attenuated by various processes and interventions (including pharmacological and psychological approaches), some producing temporary blunting of fear behaviors and others causing more long-lasting relief. Interfering with the re-consolidation by inhibiting molecular and cellular events supporting fear memory re-stabilization [ , (Lee et al., 2006; Nader et al., 2000)], for example with β-adrenoceptor blockers (Debiec & Ledoux, 2004; Kindt et al., 2009), has been proposed as a clinical approach to alleviating fear memories. For discussion on this and other means of reducing fear (e.g. via US habituation) we refer the reader to some excellent prior reviews (Graham et al., 2011; Schwabe et al., 2014). Other potential ways to relieve fear include safety learning (Kong et al., 2014; Rogan et al., 2005) and erasure-like mechanisms such as destruction of erasure-preventing perineuronal nets (Gogolla et al., 2009).\n\nAlternatively, fear memories can also be extinguished. Fear extinction, a process originally described by Pavlov (Pavlov, 1927), entails repeated exposure to anxiety-provoking cues to establish a new memory that counters the original fear memory. The process is highly relevant to fear, anxiety and trauma-related disorders which are associated with negative emotional reactions triggered by specific objects, situations or internal and external cues that are excessive to the actual danger posed. Moreover, extinction in animals is procedurally similar to forms of CBT that rely on exposure to anxiety-provoking cues (see ) (Milad & Quirk, 2012), and anxiety disorders are associated with an inability to extinguish learned fear and to respond adequately to safety signals (Jovanovic et al., 2012; Michael et al., 2007; Milad et al., 2009; Milad et al., 2013; Wessa & Flor, 2007) [reviewed in (Holmes & Singewald, 2013)]. Thus, fear extinction has considerable translational utility. The key processes that can be targeted to pharmacologically augment fear extinction are summarized in .\n\nExtinction is a learning process driven by violation of the original CS=US contingency (termed ‘prediction error’ for review see (Pearce & Bouton, 2001; McNally & Westbrook, 2006) ], but it also contains other elements including habituation and desensitization some also say era-sure/destabilization (Lin et al., 2011). Some authors therefore favor the term ‘relearning’ over extinction [for discussion see (Riebe et al., 2012)]. As with fear learning, extinction occurs in two phases: extinction acquisition and extinction consolidation. The decrement in the fear response during’extinction training’ is also termed ‘within-session extinction’. Similar to fear memory, stabilization of the extinction memory requires both a cascade of overlapping, but dissociable, molecular and cellular events [for review see (Myers & Davis, 2007; Orsini & Maren, 2012) ] that alter synaptic efficacy and brain systems-level interactions (Pape & Pare, 2010). The strength of extinction memory can be assessed at some interval (usually >1 day) after extinction training in “extinction retrieval” sessions (also termed ‘extinction retention’ or ‘extinction expression’, but note that we use the term “extinction retrieval” throughout this review).\n\nThat extinction memories are prone to re-emergence (due to insufficient ‘longterm extinction’) indicates that the original fear memory is still in place and the extinction memory is weaker/more labile than the fear memory. This may be particularly true of older (‘remote’) fear memories (Tsai & Graff, 2014). The re-emergence of extinguished fear occurs under multiple circumstances: (i) renewal, when the CS is presented in a different context to that in which extinction training occurred; (ii) reinstatement, when the original US or another stress-or is given unexpectedly; and (iii) spontaneous recovery, when a significant period of time has elapsed following successful extinction training (Herry et al., 2010; Myers & Davis, 2007). The likelihood of fear re-emergence is dependent on the strength of the extinction memory which is also determined by the type of extinction protocol used see e.g. (Laborda & Miller, 2013; Li & Westbrook, 2008). Spontaneous recovery (Rowe & Craske, 1998a,b; Schiller et al., 2008), reinstatement (Schiller et al., 2008) and renewal (Effting & Kindt, 2007) are all observable in clinical settings, and can be readily exploited in the laboratory to identify drugs and other interventions that can prevent fear re-emergence in animals and relapse in humans (Vervliet et al., 2013).\n\nOur goal in the current review is to offer a comprehensive overview of preclinical work on the possible pharmacological approaches (see Box 1 for an overview) to augment fear extinction and protect against the re-emergence of fear, and to discuss the potential translational value of these candidates as adjuncts to exposure-based CBT in anxiety patients.\n\nA limitation of extinction-based exposure therapy is that patients can often relapse with the passage of time, with changes in context (out of the therapy context), or under conditions of stress or other provocations, such as experiencing trauma reminders. In the parlance of learning theory, extinction memories are labile and fragile. A key goal for pharmacotherapy, therefore, is to identify compounds that overcome this fragility, by bolstering the formation, persistence and possibly context independence of extinction memories. One approach to achieving this goal is to use drugs as adjuncts to exposure therapy (cognitive enhancers) as a way to augment the extinction learning process. In this review, we discuss the various neurochemical and molecular signaling pathways that have been targeted to this end. On the one hand, there remain significant challenges to overcome, including the selective targeting of extinction-related processes without concurrent effects on original fear memories. On the other hand, there are clearly a plethora of potentially promising avenues to pursue, and we are optimistic that real advances can be made in treating trauma-related disorders.\n\n2. Neuronal substrates of fear extinction\n\nUsing a number of complementary techniques (including electro-physiology, immediate-early gene mapping, tracing studies, lesioning/ inactivation approaches and optogenetics) research is revealing the complex and interconnected brain circuitry mediating fear extinction. Several key brain areas including the amygdala (AMY), hippocampus (HPC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), periaqueductal gray (PAG), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and others have been implicated in extinction [for recent detailed reviews see (Duvarci & Pare, 2014; Ehrlich et al., 2009; Herry et al., 2010; Knapska et al., 2012; Myers & Davis, 2007; Orsini & Maren, 2012; Pape & Pare, 2010)]. Of these, we focus on the AMY, HPC and mPFC as major, well-defined components of the fear circuitry (see ).\n\nWhile the AMY and the mPFC are crucial for the formation and maintenance of fear extinction memories, the HPC, linked with the mPFC and the AMY (Pape & Pare, 2010), processes contextual information linked with extinction (Orsini & Maren, 2012). Altering these hippocampal contributions to extinction memory or mimicking the hippocampal response within the extinction context (see below) may be mechanisms that render extinction context-independent. The AMY is a core hub in fear extinction processing. Data in rodents and humans suggest sustained AMY activity in extinction-impaired individuals, possibly resulting from a failure to engage pro-extinction circuits in cortical areas and subregions of the AMY [reviewed in (Holmes & Singewald, 2013)]. Different AMY subregions and neuronal populations have differential contributions to extinction. The centromedial AMY (CeM) is the major output station of the AMY that drives fear via its connections to the hypothalamus and brainstem regions (Fendt & Fanselow, 1999; LeDoux et al., 1988; Maren, 2001), and its responding is modulated following extinction via intra-amygdala and remote inputs. Extinction training has been shown to cause a rapid reduction of CS-evoked responses of lateral AMY (LA) neurons possibly via depotentiation of thalamic inputs (Duvarci & Pare, 2014). The basal AMY (BA) contains extinction-encoding neurons which drive GABAergic cells in the medial intercalated cell masses (ITC) and neurons in the centrolateral AMY (CeL) to inhibit the CeM and the expression of fear (Duvarci & Pare, 2014; Herry et al., 2008). Following from these initial findings, additional studies involving optogenetic approaches, have shown that a subpopulation of the BA pyramidal neurons which express the Thy1 gene may mark the extinction neuron subpopulation (Jasnow et al., 2013).\n\nIt is also becoming apparent that different ITCs are part of a GABAergic feed-forward relay station interconnecting AMY nuclei with distinct networks within the ITCs that are engaged in particular fear stages exerting different influences on extinction (Busti et al., 2011; Duvarci & Pare, 2014; Whittle et al., 2010). Separate neuronal populations in the CeL have been found to have contrasting roles in fear and fear extinction. CeL-OFF neurons (PKCδ+ phenotype) inhibit fear-promoting CeM neurons, while CeL-ON (PKCδ- phenotype) cells stimulate fear-promoting CeM neurons (Ciocchi et al., 2010; Haubensak et al., 2010). Additionally, a very recent finding suggests that a subpopulation of neurons within the CeM – that of the Tac2 peptide-expressing cells – is critically involved in fear learning and fear expression (Andero et al., 2014).\n\nAnother important node within the extinction circuitry is the mPFC, which shares strong interconnections with the HPC and the AMY. Fear extinction recruits the ventral segment of the mPFC, the infralimbic (IL) subdivision [the rodent correlate of the human ventromedial PFC (vmPFC)] which projects to BA extinction and ITC neurons and can thereby inhibit the activity of CeM fear output neurons [reviewed in (Amir et al., 2011; Senn et al., 2014)]. When a conditioned cue following extinction is presented in the extinction (therapy) context, the HPC activates the IL (an activation which is absent or less in a novel context), supporting subsequent CeM inhibition (Herry et al., 2010). The IL subdivision is involved in the consolidation of extinction memory and synaptic plasticity in this region is crucial for successful extinction retrieval (Mueller & Cahill, 2010). Impaired extinction has been associated with relatively low activity in IL neurons, and successful extinction with relatively high IL neuronal activity [reviewed in (Holmes & Singewald, 2013)]. The region of the mPFC neighboring the IL [the prelimbic cortex (PL) in rodents and the dorsal anterior cingulate in humans] plays an opposite role to the IL in regulating fear and extinction [reviewed in (Milad &Quirk, 2012)]. The PL interacts with BA fear neurons, augmenting output of the basolateral amygdaloid complex (BLA) and hence CeM activity (Senn et al., 2014).\n\nThere is now strong evidence from both animal and human studies that these various components of the neural circuit underlying extinction are functionally disturbed in individuals with impaired extinction (reviewed in (Holmes & Singewald, 2013) and importantly that successful extinction in animals (Whittle et al., 2010) and exposure therapy in humans (Hauner et al., 2012) can correct these abnormalities by triggering a lasting reorganization of this network.\n\n3. Neurochemical and molecular substrates of fear extinction\n\nResearch is revealing that the activity of a number of specific intra-cellular signaling cascades [reviewed in (Orsini & Maren, 2012)] carrying biological information from the cell surface to the nucleus, is the key to successful extinction by modulating gene transcription and ultimately promoting synaptic plasticity in extinction-relevant brain regions. The consolidation of extinction memories requires new protein synthesis initiated by molecular signaling cascades within the AMY, HPC and mPFC. The extinction-related molecular signaling and gene expression modulation can differ considerably in these brain areas (Cestari et al., 2014). Key molecules in the amygdala include calcium (Ca2+) influx via NMDA-receptors [in an interaction with α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors] and VGCCs-mediated activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and kinases such as Ca2+ /phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PKC), and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Once activated, these kinases merge into a common mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway initiating cAMP response element binding (CREB) phosphorylation and transcription of plasticity proteins [reviewed in (Orsini & Maren, 2012, see for overview]. Aspects of this intracellular signaling seem to be disrupted in deficient extinction, as exemplified by the correlation of impaired extinction with reduced ERK activity in extinction-relevant brain areas (Cannich et al., 2004; Herry et al., 2006; Ishikawa et al., 2012). Similarly, aberrant expression of memory-related genes in these areas is correlated with impaired extinction (Holmes & Singewald, 2013).\n\nTo enable selective therapeutic targeting, an important aim in the extinction field is to identify neural mechanisms and intracellular pathways in fear extinction that are different from those involved in fear memory formation. Many of the intracellular mechanisms are similar, however there are also a number of distinct processes and features in fear vs fear extinction learning, including differences in protein synthesis dependence, in brain area- and neuronal population-specific localization and recruitment of signaling pathways, in time course of recruitment, in distinct involvement of certain isoforms of key signaling components (e.g. ERK1 vs ERK2) and resulting gene expression (Cestari et al., 2014; Guedea et al., 2011; Lattal et al., 2006; Tronson et al., 2012). While there are examples of the direct targeting of pharmacologically important components of the aforementioned intracellular signaling, e.g. the MAPK/ERK pathway (Fischer et al., 2007; Herry et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2001) to modulate fear extinction, they were mainly targeted indirectly via membrane receptors e.g. (Cannich et al., 2004; Matsuda et al., 2010) or ion channels (Davis & Bauer, 2012; Ishikawa et al., 2012). These findings have stimulated the hypothesis that boosting specific synaptic plasticity mechanisms by pharmacological means may constitute novel drug targets to promote fear extinction. Indeed, as outlined below, systemic and brain region specific drug studies have identified a number of promising compounds which augment the behavioral and neurobiological effects of fear extinction. The results of these studies are building a framework upon which novel therapeutic interventions to facilitate the efficacy of CBT may be rationally developed and which may ultimately help to enhance symptom remission and recovery.\n\n4. Pharmacologically enhancing extinction\n\n4.1. Serotonergic system\n\nThe serotonin (5-HT) system is positioned to modulate the extinction circuitry via ascending 5-HT projections arising from midbrain raphe nuclei that innervate certain brain structures including the AMY (BLA > LA ≫ CeA), the HPC, the mPFC and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis [reviewed in (Burghardt & Bauer, 2013)]. The acquisition and expression of conditioned fear increases 5-HT release in the BLA, mPFC and dPAG (Kawahara et al., 1993; Yokoyama et al., 2005; Zanoveli et al., 2009) though possible changes in 5-HT release during acquisition and consolidation of fear extinction have not been reported to the best of our knowledge.\n\nThere are 16 5-HT receptor subtypes classified into 7 receptor families (5-HT1–7) ( ). All 5-HT receptors, excluding the 5-HT3 family – a member of a superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels, are metabotropic, coupled to Gs (5-HT6 and 5-HT7), Gi/0 (5-HT1, 5-HT4 and 5-HT5) or Gq (5-HT2) proteins.\n\nTo date, research has largely focused on the role of 3 of the 5-HT receptors in fear extinction; namely 5 HT1A, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 ( , ). Selective activation of 5-HT1A (Saito et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013) or 5-HT2A receptors (Catlow et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013) enhances extinction. This might occur via 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors expressed in the mPFC and the LA (Chalmers & Watson, 1991; Cornea-Hebert et al., 1999; Santana et al., 2004). Both of these receptors regulate mPFC and LA excitability via direct activation of pyramidal cells and/or GABAergic interneurons (Llado-Pelfort et al., 2012; Rainnie, 1999; Stutzmann & LeDoux, 1999). 5HT2A agonists increase presynaptic glutamate release (Aghajanian & Marek, 1999) and increase NMDA receptor sensitivity (Arvanov et al., 1999) and these are mechanisms well characterized as being important in extinction (see Section 4.4 Glutamatergic system).\n\nTable 1\n\nDrug/manipulationExtinction trainingExtinction retrievalLongterm extinctionRouteReferenceFacilitating 5-HT signalingSERT KO6ns–nsNo drug(Hartley et al. 2012)No effect–nsNo drug(Wellman et al. 2007)Acute fluoxetine (SSRI)(−)##No effectnsip(Lebron-Milad et al. 2013)Subchronic citalopram (SSRI, 9d)No effectnsnsip(Burghardt et al. 2013)Chronic citalopram (SSRI, 22d)–(−)nsip(Burghardt et al. 2013)Chronic (14d) fluoxetine (SSRI)(+)#(+)nspo(Lebron-Milad et al. 2013)Chronic fluoxetine (SSRI)No effect++ (Ren-A, SR, Re-in)ip(Karpova et al. 2011)No effectns+ (Re-in)ip,po(Deschaux et al. 2011, 2013)No effect*+*4nspo(Camp et al. 2012)No effect+nspo(Popova et al. 2014)Acute venlafaxine (SSRI)No effect+nsip(Yang et al. 2012)Chronic venlafaxine (SSRI)nsns+ (Re-in)ip(Yang et al. 2012)8-OH-DPAT (5HT1 ag)+*5(−)*5nsip(Wang et al. 2013)Tandospirone (5HT1 ag)ns+*nsip(Saito et al. 2013)tcb2 (5HT2A ag)+nsnsip(Zhang et al. 2013)Psilocybin (5HT2A ag)(+)nsnsip(Catlow et al. 2013)5-HT3 OENo effectnsnsNo drugHarrell and Allan (2003)Inhibiting 5-HT signaling5,7-Dihydroxytryptamine(+)#+nsBLA(Izumi et al. 2012)5,7-DihydroxytryptamineNo effectNo effectnsIL(Izumi et al. 2012)5HT3 KOns–nsNo drug(Kondo et al. 2014)MDL11,939 (5HT2A ant)–nsnsip(Zhang et al. 2013)Ketanserin (5HT2A/C ant)(+)nsnsip(Catlow et al. 2013)Granisetron (5HT3 ant)No effect(+)nsipPark and Williams (2012)\n\nThe roles in extinction of other 5-HT receptors or other components of the 5-HT system, such as melatonin ((Huang et al., 2014) have not been extensively explored. For example, recent work indicating that the 5-HT7 receptor regulates emotional memories (Eriksson et al., 2012), has not been followed up with studies on extinction. However, 5-HT3 receptors have been also associated with fear extinction mechanisms ( ). While 5-HT3 antagonists have been found to improve extinction (Park & Williams, 2012), constitutive deletion of 5-HT3 receptors has the opposite effect, possibly due to developmental changes in the 5-HT system (Kondo et al., 2014).\n\nDespite the limited knowledge that we have so far regarding specific 5-HT receptor contributions to extinction, chronic treatment with SSRIs to enhance 5-HT availability is the first-line therapy for many anxiety disorders. Acute SSRI treatment induces anxiogenic effects, which can be prevented with 5-HT2C antagonists in rodents and mimicked by 5-HT2C agonists administered systemically (Bagdy et al., 2001; Salchner & Singewald, 2006) or locally into the BLA (Campbell & Merchant, 2003). Chronic treatment with some SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine) but not all (e.g., citalopram) enhances extinction in rodents ( ) [for a recent review see (Burghardt & Bauer, 2013)], including models of impaired extinction [(Camp et al., 2012; Fitzgerald et al., 2014b) see ]. Venlafaxine – a combined 5-HT and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor with weaker affinity to the noradrenaline transporter (Owens et al., 1997) – also improves extinction retrieval and protects against fear reinstatement in rodents (Yang et al., 2012). Chronic fluoxetine treatment does not strengthen fear conditioning or fear expression (Camp et al., 2012) suggesting relative selectivity for extinction. Another clinically relevant attribute of chronic fluoxetine treatment is the protection it provides against the return of fear, as assayed by spontaneous recovery or fear renewal (Deschaux et al., 2011; Deschaux et al., 2013; Karpova et al., 2011). Furthermore, an important molecular mechanism through which fluoxetine produces extinction-associated reductions in fear may be the transformation of adult plasticity mechanisms to a juvenile state (Karpova et al., 2011).\n\nThese encouraging preclinical discoveries will hopefully stimulate comprehensive clinical assessment of the efficacy of SSRIs in augmenting CBT in anxiety patients ( ). There have been small-scale clinical trials showing, for example, that paroxetine augments fear reductions (assessed using CAPS scores) and is associated with higher remission rates when combined with CBT in PTSD patients as compared with a placebo/CBT group. An optional treatment maintenance for an additional 12 weeks revealed that symptomatic improvements were long-lasting and consistent although no further improvements could be detected. However, this may have been due to enhanced drop-out of patients who had remitted in earlier phases of the study (Schneier et al., 2012). More evidence is available in panic disorder ( ). There is evidence that chronic SSRI treatment (fluvoxamine, paroxetine) increases CBT-induced fear reductions in panic disorder patients (de Beurs et al., 1995; Oehrberg et al., 1995). However results concerning the extinction-augmenting ability of SSRIs are not consistent as SSRIs, including fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline and paroxetine, have failed to demonstrate efficacy in primary outcomes [clinical global impression; (Blomhoff et al., 2001; Davidson et al., 2004; Haug et al., 2003; Koszycki et al., 2011; Stein et al., 2000). Despite their common effect of serotonin transporter inhibition, SSRIs are known to differ with regard to their pharmacological properties. Along these lines, some SSRIs (e.g. paroxetine) show additional noradrenaline transporter-inhibiting properties via their metabolites (Owens et al., 1997), while others (e.g. citalopram) show continued selectivity for the serotonergic system (Deupree et al., 2007). In this respect, differential effect sizes of SSRIs are to be expected.\n\nTable 1A\n\nDisorderStudy designOutcome (compared to placebo control group)ReferenceHealthy volunteers14 days po escitalopram pretreatment; fear\n\nconditioning paradigmAccelerated extinction learning (skin conductance responses)(Bui et al., 2013)Panic disorder with/without\n\nagoraphobiaFluvoxamine or placebo followed by exposure\n\ntherapy; psychological panic management followed\n\nby exposure therapy or exposure therapy aloneSelf-reported measures\n\nAll treatments effective, however fluvoxamine plus CBT\n\nsuperior to all other treatments(de Beurs et al., 1995)Panic disorder with/without\n\nagoraphobia12 weeks paroxetine or placebo plus CBTReduced number of panic attacks in paroxetine/CBT group(Oehrberg et al., 1995)Panic disorder with/without\n\nagoraphobia10 weeks of paroxetine or placebo plus CBT in week 5\n\nand 7No significant difference in primary CGI outcome.\n\nSecondary outcome: Higher proportion of panic-free\n\npatients in paroxetine-CBT group.(Stein et al., 2000)Panic disorder with/without\n\nagoraphobia12 weeks fluvoxamine or placebo with or without\n\nCBTAll groups except placebo without CBT improved.\n\nNo difference within other groups.(Sharp et al., 1997)Panic disorder with/without\n\nagoraphobia12 weeks of sertraline or placebo treatment plus\n\nself-administered CBT or no CBTReduced anticipatory anxiety in sertraline plus\n\nself-administered CBT\n\nNo significant improvements in CGI.(Koszycki et al., 2011)Social anxiety disorder24 weeks of sertraline/placebo with or without\n\nexposure therapy (8 sessions in the first 12 weeks of\n\ntreatment)All groups improved (also placebo without CBT)\n\nSertraline treatment (without CBT) showed higher\n\nimprovement than CBT groups (placebo or sertraline).\n\nPlacebo without CBT showed lowest benefits.(Blomhoff et al., 2001)Social anxiety disorderFollow-up study of (Blomhoff et al., 2001)\n\nAssessment of long-term effects 28 weeks after\n\ncessation of medical treatmentExposure therapy alone (without placebo or sertraline)\n\nshowed a further improvement in CAPS 28 weeks after\n\ntreatment cessation, however only reached improvement\n\nlevels comparable with those of the sertraline alone group\n\nafter the initial 24 weeks(Haug et al., 2003)CAPS score in the other groups (Exposure + placebo or\n\nsertraline and placebo alone) stayed constant (no\n\nimprovement compared to 24 week CAPS score)Social anxiety disorder14 weeks of fluoxetine or placebo plus weekly CBT or\n\nno CBT\n\nCBT consisted of group treatment combining in vivo\n\nexposure, cognitive restructuring and social skills\n\ntrainingAll treatments were superior to placebo (without CBT) but\n\nno differences between groups themselves(Davidson et al., 2004)PTSD10 exposure therapy sessions\n\n(1×/week) plus paroxetine CR\n\nOptional 12 weeks of maintenance treatmentGreater CAPS improvement in paroxetine group vs\n\nplacebo after 10 weeks\n\nHigher rate of remission (61.5% vs 23.1% in placebo group)\n\nafter 10 weeks\n\nNo changes after additional 12 weeks. CAVE drop-out of\n\nremitters.(Schneier et al., 2012)\n\nNevertheless, a number of outstanding questions remain, including that concerning the specificity of SSRIs in augmenting fear extinction as opposed to fear learning (as observed with fluoxetine in preclinical models; see above). In this respect, the finding that prior fear conditioning administration of escitalopram augments extinction learning in healthy volunteers without influencing fear acquisition (Bui et al., 2013) may hint at a potential selectivity of SSRIs to preferentially engage extinction mechanisms. However, this remains to be tested.\n\nIn summary, the clinical studies performed so far have demonstrated that SSRI augmented psychotherapy holds some benefits for panic disorder patients and possibly for PTSD and SAD patients. However, further studies of different SSRIs in larger patient cohorts will be needed, as well as adequate follow-up time to reveal long-term effects, before more definite conclusions can be drawn. Until such studies, as well as studies investigating receptor selective approaches are available, it seems rational to recommend combined treatment involving exposure-based psychotherapy together with antidepressants including SSRIs such as fluoxetine, as there is more evidence supporting than disproving such a strategy at the moment.\n\n4.2. Dopaminergic system\n\nAn increasing amount of evidence suggests that dopamine (DA) signaling has an important role in extinction mechanisms ( ) [for a recent detailed review, see (Abraham et al., 2014)]. The DAergic system innervates forebrain extinction circuits through ascending mesocortical/limbic DAergic projections from the ventral tegmental area targeting certain brain regions including the mPFC, HPC and AMY (Pinard et al., 2008; Pinto & Sesack, 2008; Weiner et al., 1991). There is increased dopamine release in the mPFC during and following extinction training (Hugues et al., 2007) and boosting DAergic signaling with DA precursors or DA-releasing drugs facilitates extinction consolidation (Abraham et al., 2012; Haaker et al., 2013) and can rescue impaired fear extinction in female rats (Rey et al., 2014). Conversely, reducing DAergic transmission by lesioning mesocortical DAergic projection neurons (with 6-OH-DOPA) impairs extinction memory formation (Fernandez Espejo, 2003; Morrow et al., 1999) (see summary in ). More recently, there have been further insights into the mechanisms of how and where DAergic signaling can influence fear extinction have been made. These studies (see and below) have revealed a complex two-pronged feature of DAergic signaling that can (i) gate the expression of fear, and (ii) influence fear extinction consolidation mechanisms.\n\nTable 2\n\nDrug/manipulationExtinction trainingExtinction retrievalLongterm extinctionRouteReferenceFacilitating DA signalingL-DOPAns+1+ (SR, Re-in2, Ren-Aip(Haaker et al., 2013)Amphetamine−nsnsip(Borowski and Kokkinidis, 1998)No effectnsnsip(Carmack et al., 2010)(+)3nsip(Mueller et al., 2009)Cocaine−nsnsip(Borowski and Kokkinidis, 1998)Methyl-phenidate+(+)nsip(Abraham et al., 2012)ns+1nsip(Abraham et al., 2012){\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"SKF38393\",\"term_id\":\"1157151916\",\"term_text\":\"SKF38393\"}}SKF38393 (pAg D1)−nsnsip(Borowski and Kokkinidis, 1998)+*4nsnsip(Dubrovina and Zinov'eva, 2010)ns+1nsCA1(Fiorenza et al., 2012)nsNo effect1nsBLA(Fiorenza et al., 2012)nsNo effect1nsIL(Fiorenza et al., 2012)ns+6nsip(Rey et al., 2014)ns−7nsip(Rey et al., 2014)Quinpirole (D2 ag)ns−nsip(Ponnusamy et al., 2005)ns−nsip(Nader and LeDoux, 1999)−4nsnsip(Dubrovina and Zinov'eva, 2010)Inhibiting DA signaling6-OH DOPA−nsnsmPFC(Morrow et al., 1999)−(−)nsmPFC(Fernandez Espejo, 2003)D1 knock-out−nsnsglobal KO(El-Ghundi et al., 2001)SCH23390 (D1 ant)nsNo effect1nsIL(Fiorenza et al., 2012)−No effectnsBLA(Hikind and Maroun, 2008)No effect−nsIL(Hikind and Maroun, 2008)ns−1nsCA1(Fiorenza et al., 2012)nsNo effect1nsBLA(Fiorenza et al., 2012)Sulpiride (D2 ant)−nsnsip(Dubrovina and Zinov'eva, 2010)ns+nsip(Ponnusamy et al., 2005)No effectNo effectnsip(Mueller et al., 2010)Raclopride (D2 ant)(−)No effectnsip(Mueller et al., 2010)No effect−nsIL(Mueller et al., 2010)Haloperidol (D2/D3 ant)−nsnsip(Holtzman-Assif et al., 2010)(−)nsnsicv(Holtzman-Assif et al., 2010)(−)−nsNAcb(Holtzman-Assif et al., 2010)L-741,741 (D4 ant)No effect−nsmPFC(Pfeiffer and Fendt, 2006)\n\nDopamine receptors are metabotropic and in the classical view, coupled to either Gs (increased cAMP, D1-like) or Gi/0 (decreased cAMP, D2-like) proteins. However, DAergic signals can also be transduced via Phospholipase C (PLC) activation (enhanced DAG, IP3) mediated by D1-like Gα proteins, by D2-like Gβγ subunits or by receptors forming D1/D2 heteromers (Felder et al., 1989; Lee et al., 2004) [for review see (Abraham et al., 2014)]. The D1-class receptor signaling modulates the excitability of BLA parvalbumin-positive interneurons (Bissiere et al., 2003; Kroner et al., 2005; Loretan et al., 2004) and ITCs (Manko et al., 2011). In concert with D2-like receptors in the CeL/CeC (Perez de la Mora et al., 2012), DAergic signaling exerts tight control over CeM-mediated expression of fear. To date, however, pharmacological manipulation of DAergic signaling in the AMY has produced conflicting results with regard to extinction (Fiorenza et al., 2012; Hikind & Maroun, 2008) (see ).\n\nPreclinical work has aimed to clarify the role of DA receptor activity in extinction. However, research has been largely complicated by the lack of receptor subtype-selective compounds, leaving many investigations reliant on drugs acting on D1-like (D1, D5) and D2-like (D2, D3, D4) receptor subfamilies. One reliable finding, however, is that DA antagonism (see ) specifically in the mPFC impairs the retrieval of extinction memories (Hikind & Maroun, 2008; Mueller et al., 2010; Pfeiffer & Fendt, 2006). In this case, DAergic effects on glutamatergic NMDA receptor signaling may be involved. As discussed below (Section 4.4 Glutamatergic system), NMDA receptor-mediated burst activity of mPFC neurons is associated with stabilization of extinction memories (Burgos-Robles et al., 2007) and D1-like receptor agonists facilitate NMDA receptor currents via Gs mediated increases in adenylate cyclase (AC) activity (Snyder et al., 1998). There is also the possibility that D2 receptor mechanisms in the PFC support extinction, as (Mueller et al., 2010) showed that a pre-extinction IL injection of the D2 antagonist raclopride impaired the consolidation of extinction memory. However, following systemic administration of the (less selective) D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride, accelerated extinction was found (Ponnusamy et al., 2005).\n\nIn summary, the results of preclinical studies do not yet fully clarify the specific DA receptor or receptor class mediating the extinction augmenting effect of enhanced dopaminergic signaling. Work still needs to be done on the use of receptor-selective agonists and antagonists, as well as biased ligands (showing functional selectivity for either AC or PLC signal transduction pathways) to reveal receptor-specific functions and their modulation of downstream signaling cascades in extinction. Pharmacologically increasing the DA tone promotes extinction. L-DOPA administration following extinction training enhances fear extinction in mice and healthy humans, rendering extinction resistant to fear renewal, reinstatement and spontaneous recovery (Haaker et al., 2013). L-DOPA is a precursor for all catecholamines, but preferentially enhances dopaminergic turnover in the frontal cortex (Dayan & Finberg, 2003), eliciting D1- and D2-like receptor responses (Trugman et al., 1991). Indeed, L-DOPA augments extinction-related neural activity in the mPFC (IL) of mice and increases mPFC functional coupling in humans (Haaker et al., 2013). These findings have immediate translational potential because L-DOPA is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved compound used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, typically in combination with carbidopa (a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor) to maximize central availability and minimize peripheral side effects. While there are abuse related issues with any DA enhancer, this could be mitigated by supervised, acute treatment during CBT. Encouragingly, a small-scale clinical trial found improved efficacy of psychotherapy in treatment-resilient PTSD patients by administration of another DA-enhancing drug, MDMA (Mithoefer et al., 2011) and a follow-up indicated robust fear reductions for up to 74 months [(Mithoefer et al., 2013), see ]. A caveat here is that it is unclear whether these effects of MDMA are solely attributable to its effects on DA, and not also to its effect on other targets of MDMA, notably 5-HT. Nonetheless, boosting DA transmission in conjunction with CBT could have significant potential translational value.\n\nTable 2A\n\nDisorderStudy designOutcome (compared to placebo control group)ReferenceHealthy volunteersFear conditioning paradigm, L-DOPA po following\n\nextinction trainingProtection from renewal (skin conductance responses)(Haaker et al., 2013)PTSD (treatment-refractory)2 single oral MDMA prior to 8h therapy session (3–5 weeks\n\napart, patients also received therapy prior to first MDMA\n\nexposure as well as between and in follow-up)MDMA augmented CBT in comparison to placebo (83%\n\nvs 25% response)\n\n(2 month follow-up); open-label MDMA use offered to\n\npatients from the placebo group after last assessment(Mithoefer et al., 2011)PTSD (treatment-refractory)Follow-up study from (Mithoefer et al. 2011)MDMA augmented CBT produced long-lasting effects\n\n(17–74 months)(Mithoefer et al., 2013)\n\n4.3. Noradrenergic system\n\nThe noradrenergic system is crucial for both the formation and the maintenance of fear memories, as well as for extinction memories (reviewed in (Holmes & Quirk, 2010; Mueller & Cahill, 2010)). Noradrenaline can enhance neuronal excitability in extinction-relevant brain regions such as the IL (Mueller et al., 2008) and successful fear extinction is associated with enhanced extracellular levels of nor-adrenaline in the mPFC (Hugues et al., 2007). Boosting noradrenaline levels, via administration of either noradrenaline itself (Merlo & Izquierdo, 1967) or of compounds such as yohimbine (see below) or methylphenidate (Abraham et al., 2012) enhances fear extinction ( ). There is evidence from preclinical studies that activating β-adrenoceptors, one target receptor of noradrenaline, can also facilitate fear extinction ( ) [for recent review, see (Fitzgerald et al., 2014a)]. Conversely, depleting central noradrenaline or lesioning ascending noradrenaline projections from the locus coeruleus, impairs extinction, as does systemic alpha1 or β adrenoceptor blockade ( ) [reviewed in (Mueller & Cahill, 2010)].\n\nTable 3\n\nDrug/manipulationExtinction learningExtinction retrievalLongterm extinctionRouteReferenceEnhancing noradrenergic signalingNoradrenalinens+nsicv(Merlo and Izquierdo, 1967)Methylphenidate++nsip(Abraham et al., 2012)Noradrenalinens+1nsBLA(Berlau and McGaugh, 2006)nsNo effect1nsBLA(Fiorenza et al., 2012)nsNo effect1nsCA1(Fiorenza et al., 2012)ns−1nsIL(Fiorenza et al., 2012)Atomoxetine (NE reuptake inhibitor)nsNo effect6+ (SR)5systemic(Janak and Corbit, 2011)Isoproterenol (β ag)No effectnsnsip (subchronic)(Do-Monte et al., 2010b)ns(+)1nsip (subchronic)(Do-Monte et al., 2010b)ns(+)1nsmPFC(Do-Monte et al., 2010b)Yohimbine (α2 ant)8+nsnssc(Cain et al., 2004)nsNo effect1nssc(Cain et al., 2004)+#2+2nssc(Cain et al., 2004)++−ip(Morris and Bouton, 2007)No effect7No effectnsip(Mueller et al., 2009)ns+*nsip(Hefner et al., 2008)nsNo effect6+ (SR)5systemic(Janak and Corbit, 2011)Atipamezole (α2 ant)8nsNo effect4nssc(Davis et al., 2008)Inhibiting noradrenergic signalingPrazosine (α1 ant)nsNo effect1nsip (subchronic)(Do-Monte et al., 2010a)−nsnsip (subchronic)(Do-Monte et al., 2010a)−nsnsintra-mPFC(Do-Monte et al., 2010a)Propanolol (β ant)No effectnsnssc(Cain et al., 2004)nsNo effect1nssc(Cain et al., 2004)No effect2(−)3nssc(Cain et al., 2004)(+)#No effectnsip(Rodriguez-Romaguera et al., 2009)−−nsip (subchronic)(Do-Monte et al., 2010b)nsNo effect1nsip (subchronic)(Do-Monte et al., 2010b)Atenolol (β ant)−nsnsmPFC(Do-Monte et al., 2010b)nsNo effect1nsmPFC(Do-Monte et al., 2010b)Sotalol (β ant)No effectNo effectnsip(Rodriguez-Romaguera et al., 2009)Timolol (β ant)ns+1nsBLA(Fiorenza et al., 2012)Propanolol (β ant)No effect−nsIL(Mueller et al., 2008)nsNo effect1nsIL(Mueller et al., 2008)Timolol (β ant)ns+1nsIL(Fiorenza et al., 2012)nsNo effect1nsCA1(Fiorenza et al., 2012)\n\nThere has been interest in the clinical utility of targeting noradrenergic mechanisms to augment extinction. Here, we focus on α2-adrenoceptors given the recent clinical findings supporting the utility of α2-adrenoceptor antagonists in improving extinction. Based on results of rodent studies (Cain et al., 2004), two small clinical studies (Powers et al., 2009; Smits et al., 2014) have shown that combining yohimbine with CBT can reduce anxiety in patients with social anxiety disorder and claustrophobic fear ( ). A third study found no CBT-augmenting benefit of yohimbine in patients with fear of flying; however, CBT may have exerted a ‘ceiling effect’ that occluded the drug's effect (Meyerbroeker et al., 2012).\n\nTable 3A\n\nDisorderStudy designOutcome (compared to placebo control group)ReferenceSocial anxiety disorder (SAD)4 sessions consisting of yohimbine being administered\n\nprior to a CBT a sessionYohimbine augmented CBT-induced improvement in\n\nSAD (self-report measures; 21 day follow-up)(Smits et al., 2014)Claustrophobic fear1 single oral yohimbine dose prior to an exposure b sessionYohimbine augment CBT-induced reduced fear of\n\nenclosed spaces (7 day follow-up)(Powers et al., 2009)Fear of flying2 single oral yohimbine prior to VRET sessionNo fear augmenting effect of yohimbine c(Meyerbroeker et al., 2012)\n\nIn rodents, blocking α2-adrenoceptors (e.g., with yohimbine) that function as autoreceptors on locus coeruleus neurons increases locus coeruleus activity and noradrenaline release in terminal regions (Singewald & Philippu, 1998). Yohimbine is anxiogenic and increases neuronal activity in widespread brain areas, including extinction-relevant areas such as the amygdala, mPFC and HPC (Singewald et al., 2003). Downstream targets of yohimbine-induced noradrenaline release include β1-adrenoceptors, and increasing activity at these receptors in locus coeruleus terminal regions (mPFC) enhances extinction (Do-Monte et al., 2010b), possibly via facilitating extinction-relevant long-term potentiation (Gelinas & Nguyen, 2005) in a BDNF-dependent manner (Furini et al., 2010). Yohimbine facilitates extinction in rodents, including extinction-impaired subjects (Hefner et al., 2008, 2008), though a more selective α2-adrenoceptor, atipamezole, does not ( ) [for further discussion, see (Holmes & Quirk, 2010)]. Yohimbine also protects against spontaneous fear recovery, in a manner similar to the effect of a noradrenaline uptake inhibitor, atomoxetine (Janak & Corbit,2011). However, yohimbine reduces fear only in the extinction context in which the drug was administered (Morris & Bouton, 2007), which would be a limitation of the clinical goal of achieving context-independent reductions in fear. Thus, other strategies may be needed, including combination strategies where drugs which do produce context-independent extinction, for example targeting HDACs (see Section 4.10 Epigenetics), are combined with yohimbine.\n\n4.4. Glutamatergic system\n\nGlutamatergic signaling plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity and many forms of learning and memory, including fear extinction (see for an overview). Fast excitatory glutamatergic signaling is mediated by ionotropic receptors (NMDA and AMPA), and slower signaling by metabotropic (mGluR1–8) receptors. Group I (mGluR1 and mGluR5) receptors are mainly expressed postsynaptically and coupled to Gq proteins enhancing phospholipase C (PLC) activity. Group II (mGluR2, mGluR3) and Group III (mGluR4, mGluR6–mGluR8) are both coupled to Gi proteins inhibiting adenylate cyclase (AC) activity and expressed on pre- as well as postsynaptic sites (Willard & Koochekpour, 2013).\n\nPharmacological potentiation of AMPA receptor activation (by PEPA) facilitates extinction learning and retrieval (Yamada et al., 2009, 2011; Zushida et al., 2007), although it is ineffective in severely extinction-impaired subjects (Whittle et al., 2013). Studies using localized infusion of AMPA potentiators (Zushida et al., 2007) and blockers (Falls et al., 1992; Milton et al., 2013; Zimmerman & Maren, 2010) coupled with electrophysiological recordings suggest that AMPA-mediated effects on extinction are localized to the mPFC [(Zushida et al., 2007) see , for recent detailed reviews (Bukalo et al., 2014; Myers et al., 2011)].\n\nThe part played in extinction by the metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR1, mGluR5 and mGluR7 has also been evaluated. Antagonizing mGluR1 (which is expressed on ITC innervating neurons (Busti et al., 2011) with CPCCOEt (Kim et al., 2007) and antagonizing mGluR5 receptors in the IL (Sepulveda-Orengo et al., 2013) have been shown to impair extinction. Furthermore, gene mutations resulting in deficits in mGluR5 (Xu et al., 2009) or mGluR7 (Callaerts-Vegh et al., 2006; Fendt et al., 2008; Goddyn et al., 2008) impair extinction learning, while selective activation (Dobi et al., 2013; Fendt et al., 2008; Morawska & Fendt, 2012; Rodrigues et al., 2002; Siegl et al., 2008; Toth et al., 2012b; Whittle et al., 2013) improves extinction [see for summary and (Bukalo et al., 2014; Myers et al., 2011) for more details].\n\nThe most extensively studied glutamate receptor in relation to fear extinction is the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). As shown in , systemic or local administration of NMDAR antagonists into the BLA or mPFC produces extinction deficits [reviewed in (Myers et al., 2011)]. Due to the potential for major side-effects (e.g. excitotoxicity) a general enhancement of NMDAR transmission is clinically undesirable and more subtle modulation of NMDAR signaling is required. NMDARs are specialized voltage-dependent, ligand-gated ion channels that are expressed as heterotetramers formed by GluN1 in combination with GluN2 or GluN3 subunits. To date, eight different splice variants of the GluN1 subunit, four distinctive GluN2 (GluN2A–D) subunits and two GluN3 (GluN3A–B) subunits have been identified [for review see (Paoletti et al., 2013)]. Activation of NMDARs requires L-glutamate binding to GluNR2 subunits, L-glycine or D-serine binding to GluNR1 subunits and membrane depolarization relocating the channel pore-blocking Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions.\n\nThe repertoire of NMDAR subunits permits the assembly of a range of NMDARs with varying dissociable signaling properties. Systemic (Dalton et al., 2008; Dalton et al., 2012; Leaderbrand et al., 2014; Sotres-Bayon et al., 2007) or localized BLA (Laurent & Westbrook, 2008; Sotres-Bayon et al., 2007; Sotres-Bayon et al., 2009) or mPFC (Laurent & Westbrook, 2008; Sotres-Bayon et al., 2009) inhibition of GluN2B-containing NMDARs (via ifenprodil or Ro25–6981) disrupts extinction. Conversely, GluN2B overexpression enhances extinction (Tang et al., 1999). Recently, facilitated signaling of GluN2C/D-containing NMDARs in the BLA (via CIQ infusion) was also demonstrated to enhance extinction (Ogden et al., 2014). The contribution of other subunits, such as GluN2A, remains to be determined.\n\nThe organization of NMDARs provides additional druggable pharmacological targets. GluN1 and GluN2 subunits are endowed with binding sites for positive and negative allosteric regulations that enable fine-tuning of NMDAR activity. The GluN1 subunit contains an inhibitory H+ binding site rendering GluN2B/D-containing NMDARs in particular sensitive to local pH changes, as well as to endogenous molecules with redox potential (Banke et al., 2005). The GluNR2 subunit is responsive to allosteric modification of NMDAR signaling by polyamines such as spermidine. Spermidine-induced activation of GluN2B signaling facilitates the consolidation of extinction (Gomes et al., 2010; Guerra et al., 2006), while arcaine, an antagonistic polyamine, disrupts extinction (Gomes et al., 2010). A GluN2 allosteric binding site – still uninvestigated in the field of fear extinction – enables modulation of NMDAR signaling by neurosteroids (i.a. allopregnanolone) (Irwin et al., 1994).\n\nNuanced pharmacological modulation of NMDARs can also be achieved by targeting the Zn2+ binding domain found on GluN2 subunits. Zn2+-binding to this modulatory site mainly inhibits GluN2A–containing NMDARs, by reducing NMDAR channel open probability (Paoletti et al., 1997). Brain Zn2+ signaling which, in addition to the NMDAR binding site, acts via other sites including the GPR39 Zn-sensing receptor (Holst et al., 2007), has been shown to exert both enhancing and attenuating effects on learning and memory via complex interactions with neurotransmitters and synaptic plasticity mechanisms (reviewed in Takeda & Tamano, 2014). Dietary Zn2+ supplementation impairs extinction (Railey et al., 2010), while dietary-induced reduction of brain Zn2+ levels rescues deficient extinction (Whittle et al., 2010). Although these effects may be mediated by Zn2+ modulation of NMDAR signaling, other actions cannot be excluded (e.g., see discussion on HDAC inhibition in Section 4.10: Epigenetics). The same is true for another NMDAR-modulating ion, Mg2+, which has also been shown to facilitate extinction when globally enhanced in the brain (Abumaria et al., 2011; Mickley et al., 2013).\n\nThe most extensively investigated allosteric modulation of NMDARs is mediated via the L-glycine binding site on the GluN1 subunit. As shown in , systemic administration of ligands on this binding site, D-serine or D-cycloserine (DCS), augments extinction consolidation [see (Bukalo et al., 2014; Myers et al., 2011) for recent detailed reviews]. There is evidence (although not consistent) that DCS may promote generalization of the extinction effect (Ledgerwood et al., 2005; Vervliet, 2008) that is, to other cues (e.g. odors, sounds, visual stimuli) that acquired fear during a more complex conditioning situation. Generalized extinction could be of potential clinical benefit, provided that cues that trigger adaptive reactions are not affected. However, DCS administration outside the consolidation window can limit the drug's effectiveness. When extinction or exposure sessions are too short or yield insufficient fear inhibition, DCS can strengthen (re-)consolidation of the original fear memory. Along these lines, the extinction augmenting effects of DCS require the subject to show at least some ability to extinguish (Bolkan & Lattal, 2014; Bouton et al., 2008; Hefner et al., 2008; Smits et al., 2013b; Tomilenko & Dubrovina, 2007; Weber et al., 2007; Whittle et al., 2013). Finally, chronic DCS treatment leads to loss of effects on extinction, possibly via NMDAR desensitization (Parnas et al., 2005; Quartermain et al., 1994). It is of note, that chronic treatment with antidepressants also disrupts the facilitating effects of DCS on extinction, possibly by interfering with NMDAR function (Werner-Seidler & Richardson, 2007).\n\nNotwithstanding these caveats, DCS represents one of the best examples of translational research paving the way for novel anxiety treatments. DCS augmentation of CBT has been clinically studied in various anxiety disorders ( ) including among pediatric patients [see (Hofmann et al., 2013a) for a recent review]. To summarize the current clinical data, DCS-augmented CBT shows advantages in PTSD (de Kleine et al., 2012; Difede et al., 2014; Scheeringa & Weems, 2014), specific phobia (Guastella et al., 2007; Nave et al., 2012; Ressler et al., 2004), SAD (Guastella et al., 2008; Hofmann et al., 2006; Hofmann et al., 2013b; Smits et al., 2013c) and OCD [(Chasson et al., 2010; Farrell et al., 2013; Kushner et al., 2007; Storch et al., 2010; Wilhelm et al., 2008) but see (Mataix-Cols et al., 2014)]. Panic disorder patients (Otto et al., 2010c; Siegmund et al., 2011) also show faster symptom alleviation after DCS-augmented CBT. Reflecting the preclinical findings, negative outcomes were associated with short CBT sessions (Litz et al., 2012), insufficient within-session fear inhibition (Smits et al., 2013b; Tart et al., 2013), chronic DCS treatment (Heresco-Levy et al., 2002), DCS administration outside the therapeutic temporal window (Storch et al., 2007) and subclinical levels of fear [(Guastella et al., 2007; Gutner et al., 2012) but see (Kuriyama et al., 2011)].\n\nTable 4A\n\nDisorderStudy designOutcome (compared to placebo control group)ReferenceHealthy volunteersDCS or placebo 2–3 h prior extinction trainingNo effect on fear extinction or fear recovery in healthy\n\nvolunteers(Guastella et al., 2007)Healthy volunteersDCS, placebo, valproic acid or combination of DCS\n\nand valproic acid 1.5 h prior extinction trainingAdministration of DCS, valproic acid or DCS/valproic\n\nacid combination facilitates fear extinction and\n\nprotects from reinstatement(Kuriyama et al., 2011)Healthy volunteersDCS or placebo 2 h prior extinction trainingNo effect on extinction learning and retention in\n\nhealthy volunteers(Klumpers et al., 2012)AcrophobiaDCS or placebo 1 h prior 2 sessions of virtual reality\n\nexposure\n\n3 month follow-upReduced fear symptoms in DCS group at all timepoints(Ressler et al., 2004)Acrophobia2 sessions virtual reality exposure plus DCS or\n\nplacebo after the sessions\n\n1 month follow-up\n\nRe-evaulation of (Tart et al., 2013)No advantage of DCS over placebo augmented VRE\n\nDCS effect depends on success of exposure sessions\n\n(within-session fear reduction)(Tart et al., 2013) (Smits et al., 2013a)Snake phobiaDCS or placebo 1 h prior a single exposure sessionSame level of improvement with DCS, but DCS group\n\nachieved fear reduction quicker(Nave et al., 2012)Panic disorderDCS or placebo 1 h prior CBT session 3–5\n\n1 month follow-upDCS group showed greater reduction in panic\n\nsymptom severity at all timepoints(Otto et al., 2010c)Panic disorder with agoraphobiaDCS or placebo 1 h prior 3 individual exposure\n\nsessions + 8 group CBT sessions 5 months\n\nfollow-upNo benefits of DCS at all timepoints, but initial\n\nbenefical effects in severely symptomatic patients?(Siegmund et al., 2011)PTSDDCS or placebo 1 h prior 10 weekly exposure\n\nsessionsNo overall enhancement of treatment effects.\n\nHigher symptom reduction in severe cases.(de Kleine et al., 2012)PTSD\n\n(combat-related)DCS or placebo 30 min prior exposure session 2–6Weaker symptom reduction compared to placebo\n\ngroup(Litz et al., 2012)PTSDDCS or placebo 1.5 h prior 12 weekly VRE session 6\n\nmonths follow-upDCS group showed earlier and greater improvement as\n\nwell as higher remission rates(Difede et al., 2014)pediatric PTSDDCS or placebo 12 1 h prior session 5–12No difference in symptom reduction, DCS group\n\nshowed trend for faster response and better retention\n\nin 3 month follow-up(Scheeringa & Weems, 2014)SAD1× psychoeducation;

Because extinction largely reflects the promotion of active inhibitory processes, it is not surprising that GABA serves as an important source of such inhibition. GABA signaling occurs largely via binding to ionotropic GABAA and metabotropic GABAB receptors (former GABAC receptors have been reclassified and are now termed GABAA rho-subclass receptors). GABAA receptors are pentameric, ligand-gated Cl− channels which, upon activation induce hyperpolarization of cells and hence reduce neuronal excitability. Seven classes of GABAA subunits (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, ρ1–3, δ, ε, ) have been identified so far, permitting the assembly of highly variable GABAA receptors with distinct functions and signaling properties. Furthermore, several allosteric binding sites, in addition to the GABA binding pocket located at the α/β-subunit interface, allow nuanced modifications of GABAA receptor signaling. The allosteric benzodiazepine (BZD) binding site is localized at the interface of α-and -γ-subunits and when activated, facilitates GABAergic transmission by promoting GABA binding to the receptor and increasing the opening probability of the Cl− channel. The binding sites of other allosteric modulators of GABAA signaling including barbiturates and neurosteroids among others are not yet fully characterized [see and (Gunn et al., 2014; Makkar et al., 2010)].\n\nIn preclinical studies, the robust inhibitory effect of full GABAA receptor agonists at the GABA binding site (α/β-subunit interface) (e.g. muscimol), is often used to inactivate a brain region to clarify its participation in certain functions including extinction. Muscimol-injections into the BLA (Laurent & Westbrook, 2008; Laurent et al., 2008; Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011), mPFC/IL (Laurent & Westbrook, 2008, 2009; Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011) and HPC [(Corcoran et al., 2005; Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011), see for a summary] disrupt extinction learning and memory, supporting the crucial involvement of these areas. However, muscimol infusion into the BLA and IL facilitates extinction in some studies (Akirav et al., 2006).\n\nTable 5\n\nFacilitating GABA signalingDrug/manipulationExtinction trainingExtinction retrievalLongterm extinctionRouteReferenceGABAA agonists GABA-binding site (αβ interface)Muscimol+#No effectnsBLA(Akirav et al., 2006)ns+1,7nsBLA(Akirav et al., 2006)−#−nsBLA(Laurent et al., 2008), (Laurent & Westbrook, 2008)ns−1nsBLA(Laurent & Westbrook, 2008)(+)#−nsBLA(Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011)−−nsmPFC(Laurent & Westbrook, 2008)ns−1nsmPFC(Laurent & Westbrook, 2008)nsNo effect1nsIL(Akirav et al., 2006)+#(+)nsIL(Akirav et al., 2006)−−nsIL(Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011)No effect−nsIL(Laurent & Westbrook, 2009)(+)#No effectnsPL((Laurent & Westbrook, 2009); (Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011))nsns+ (Ren-A)8dHPC(Corcoran et al., 2005)−−No effect (Ren-A)dHPC(Corcoran et al., 2005)(+)#−nsvHPC(Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011)GABAA: agonists BZD-binding site αγ interface)Chlordiazepoxide−nsnsip(Goldman, 1977)ns−nsip(Bouton et al., 1990)Diazepamns−nsip(Pereira et al., 1989)ns−nsip(Bouton et al., 1990)Midazolamns−1nsip(Bustos et al., 2009)−##6−nsip(Hart et al., 2009, 2010), (Hart et al., 2014)−#6−nsBLA(Hart et al., 2009, 2010, 2014)GABAB receptor agonistsBaclofenns−nsip(Heaney et al., 2012)GS39783 (positive modulator GABAB)nsNo effectnspo(Sweeney et al., 2013)Inhibiting GABA signalingDrug/manipulationExtinction learningExtinction retrievalLongterm extinctionRouteReferenceGAD67 KD in BLA−nsnsNo drug(Heldt et al., 2012)GAD65 KO−2−2nsNo drug(Sangha et al., 2009)α5 KD in HPCns−3nsNo drug(Yee et al., 2004)α1 KO in CRF+ cells−−nsNo drug(Gafford et al., 2012)Picrotoxinns+nsip(McGaugh et al., 1990)ns+4nsIL(Thompson et al., 2010)ns+4nsPL(Thompson et al., 2010)ns+*ns(Fitzgerald et al., 2014b)Bicucullinens+1nsBLA(Berlau & McGaugh, 2006)Bicuculline + propanololnsNo effect1nsBLA(Berlau & McGaugh, 2006)FG7142−−nsip(Harris & Westbrook, 1998)ns−nsip(Kim & Richardson, 2007, 2009)GABAB receptor antagonismGABAB(1b) KO−5nsnsNo drug(Jacobson et al., 2006)PhaclofennsNo effectnsip(Heaney et al., 2012){\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CGP52432\",\"term_id\":\"875421701\",\"term_text\":\"CGP52432\"}}CGP52432nsNo effectnspo(Sweeney et al., 2013)\n\nThere is solid evidence that fear extinction learning is associated with upregulation of GABAergic markers in the AMY, underscoring the importance of a certain level of GABAergic signaling in this brain area for the successful formation of extinction memories. For example, levels of gephyrin, a clustering protein facilitating postsynaptic scaffolding of GABAA receptors, were enhanced 2 h following extinction training along with enhanced surface expression of GABAA receptors in the BLA (Chhatwal et al., 2005a). Extinction learning also increases GABAA receptor α2- and β2 subunit mRNA and levels of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and the GABA transporter GAT1 (Heldt & Ressler, 2007). Further demonstrating the importance of GABAergic signaling to extinction, fear extinction learning is disrupted by mutation-induced deficits in the activity-dependent GAD isoform GAD65 (Sangha et al., 2009), and by viral knock-down of the constitutive GAD isoform GAD67 (Heldt et al., 2012). While these findings suggest that upregulation of GABAergic signaling supports extinction, GABAA receptor antagonists such as picrotoxin or bicuculline can enhance extinction memories when administered systemically (McGaugh et al., 1990), or when infused into the BLA (Berlau & McGaugh, 2006) or specific (fear promoting) areas (PL)of the mPFC (Fitzgerald et al., 2014b; Thompson et al., 2010). The reason for these apparent contradictions is not yet clear.\n\nPreliminary findings from studies using genetically modified mice suggest that the development of subunit-selective GABAA receptor drugs could be a promising way to more distinctly utilize GABAergic mechanisms facilitating extinction. For example, there is reduced mRNA expression of α5 and γ1 subunits in the AMY of a mouse model of enhanced anxiety (Tasan et al., 2011) displaying impaired extinction (Yen et al., 2012). In addition, deletion of α5-containing GABAA receptors in the HPC is sufficient to impair fear extinction recall (Yee et al., 2004) while global deletion of the GABAAα3 subunit produces modest improvements in extinction learning (Fiorelli et al., 2008).\n\nAn additional possible explanation for some paradoxical findings concerning GABA regulation and AMY function in extinction is the fact that most of the prior studies have performed pharmacological or genetic manipulations that affect either the entire brain, just the AMY, or even only AMY subregions. Despite this, we now know that GABA receptors are found on most of the neuronal cell types and thus even a subregion-specific manipulation is likely to affect many different cell populations which may have opposing functional effects. One recent attempt to address this complexity involved the use of an inducible GABAa1 knockout strategy limited only to the corticotropin-releasing-hormone containing neuronal population (Gafford et al., 2012)), which revealed relatively specific effects, including enhanced anxiety and extinction deficits. It is likely that future studies aimed at cell-type specific manipulations will help address the vast complexity of the many different cell types combined with the large number of different GABA receptor populations.\n\nAs mentioned above, the multiple different binding sites found with-in GABAA receptors can be used to elicit a more nuanced modulation of GABAA receptor activity. Positive allosteric modulation of GABAA receptor activity via BZD, represents the most widely described drug-based strategy for acute treatment of anxiety states (Macaluso et al., 2010). The prevalence of BZD use among patients suffering from mental disorders is high, and is estimated to range between 40 and 70% of these patients (Clark et al., 2004) However anxiolytic treatment with BZDs is recommended only for short periods of time, due to several disadvantages including its sedative effects, the development of dependence and difficulties with discontinuing chronic treatment (Otto et al., 2002). The sedating and calming effects of BZDs might in fact interfere with extinction possibly via reduced arousal and decreased release of neurochemicals (e.g. noradrenaline) and stress hormones (e.g. glucocorticoids) that support extinction [(Bentz et al., 2010), see Section 4.8 Glucocorticoids) for details]. BZDs may also render extinction memories dependent on the drug-induced internal anxiolytic-state (state dependent learning), which upon BZD discontinuation may no longer be accessible. These concerns are borne out by preclinical data showing that systemic (Bouton et al., 1990; Bustos et al., 2009; Goldman, 1977; Hart et al., 2009, 2010, 2014; Pereira et al., 1989) or intra-BLA (Hart et al., 2009, 2010) BZD administration impairs extinction ( ), presumably also through state-dependent mechanisms. Systemic treatment with a BZD inverse agonist (Harris & Westbrook, 1998; Kim & Richardson, 2007, 2009) has similar effects (see for a summary]. Hence, combining BZD with CBT needs careful consideration. As well as further development of BZDs targeting specific subunits of the GABAA receptor [reviewed in (Griebel & Holmes, 2013)], which provides some hope, there is preliminary evidence that putative novel anxiolytics that do not impair extinction learning [e.g. neuropeptide S; (Slattery et al., in press) see Section 4.7 Neuropeptides] can be developed to help reduce patients' aversion to the unpleasant and demanding procedure of recalling details of their traumatic memories, thus increasing their willingness to interact with the psychotherapist.\n\nIn contrast to the relatively large number of studies of the GABAA receptor, only a few studies have investigated the role of GABAB receptors. Functional GABAB receptors are heterodimers containing a GABAB1 and a GABAB2 subunit; the GABAB1 subunit has two isoforms – GABAB1a and GABAB1b (Fritschy et al., 1999). While functional deletion of GABAB receptors (GABAB1a/b knock-out) impairs extinction learning (Jacobson et al., 2006), pharmacological GABAB receptor antagonism does not (Heaney et al., 2012; Sweeney et al., 2013). Systemic administration of (non-selective) agonists or positive allosteric modulators of GABAB signaling also has inconsistent effects (impairing or negative) on extinction [(Heaney et al., 2012; Sweeney et al., 2013) see ]. A final answer to this question regarding the role of GABAB receptors may have to await the availability of GABAB1a-and GABAB1b-selective compounds\n\nTaken together, the available evidence indicates that GABA signaling has a major, but spatially and temporally restricted role in the formation of fear extinction memories. While GABA that is engaged during extinction is likely to support synaptic plasticity, increasing GABAergic tone globally seems to limit the efficacy of extinction-based therapies by mechanisms outlined above. Therefore, it is unlikely that drugs broadly targeting the GABA system will be useful in this respect. Pharmacological adjuncts to exposure therapy targeting the GABA system would rather need to strike a balance between driving and maintaining relevant GABA activity without over-activating the system. The evidence so far suggests that subunit-selective or allosteric (distinct from BZD) modulation of GABAA receptor signaling may hold promise in this regard.\n\n4.6. Cannabinoids\n\nA growing body of literature demonstrates that the endogenous cannabinoid (eCB) system modulates neuronal excitability in stressful and fearful situations (de Bitencourt et al., 2013; Gunduz-Cinar et al., 2013a). eCB signaling has been implicated in emotional and cognitive processing of threatening stimuli, for instance during the consolidation of fear and fear extinction memories (for more detailed recent reviews see (Riebe et al., 2012; Gunduz-Cinar et al., 2013b). Upon neuronal activation, an eCB (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol ( ) are rapidly synthesized in the postsynaptic neuron (within minutes) and released into the synaptic cleft to modulate presynaptic signaling by the activation of Gi/0-coupled CB-1 receptors (CB-2 receptors are mainly expressed on immune cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts and hematopoietic cells but also on neuroglia).\n\nSupporting a role of eCB signaling in the extinction of aversive memories (see for overview), there are increased eCB levels in the mouse BLA following extinction training (Marsicano et al., 2002). Conversely, PTSD patients show low brain anandamide levels (Neumeister et al., 2013). In rodents, facilitation of eCB signaling by CB-1 receptor agonists or exogenous cannabinoids [cannabidiol, (Bitencourt et al., 2008)], reuptake inhibitors [AM404, (Bitencourt et al., 2008; Chhatwal et al., 2005b; Pamplona et al., 2008)] or anandamide degradation blockers [AM3506, URB 597, (Gunduz-Cinar et al., 2013b)] enhances the formation or consolidation of extinction memories. Blockade or knock-out of CB1-receptors (Cannich et al., 2004; Kamprath et al., 2006; Marsicano et al., 2002; Niyuhire et al., 2007; Pamplona et al., 2006; Plendl & Wotjak, 2010; Reich et al., 2008; Terzian et al., 2011) impairs extinction and blocks the pro-extinction effects of drugs that facilitate eCB transmission (Chhatwal et al., 2005b; Do Monte et al., 2013; Gunduz-Cinar et al., 2013b) (see ). Collectively, these observations point to CB-1 receptor mediated eCB signaling as a powerful modulator of extinction.\n\nTable 6\n\nEnhanced cannabinoid signalingDrug/manipulationExtnction\n\ntrainingExtinction\n\nretrievalLongterm\n\nextnctionRouteReferenceCannabidiol++nsicv(Bitencourt et al., 2008)++nsIL(Do Monte et al., 2013)Anandamidens+1nsdCA1(de Oliveira Alvares et al., 2008)AM404 (eCB uptake inhibitor)ns+nsip(Pamplona et al., 2008)ns++ (Re-in)ip(Chhatwal et al., 2005b)+(+)nsicv(Bitencourt et al., 2008)No training+nsIL(Lin et al., 2009)AM3506 (FAAH inhibitor)ns+nsip(Gunduz-Cinar et al., 2013b)WIN 55,212-2 (low-dose CB1 Ag)+*No effect2nsip(Pamplona et al., 2006)WIN 55,212-2 (high-dose CB1 Ag)(−)*No effect2nsip(Pamplona et al., 2006)WIN 55,212-2 (CB1 Ag)+°+°nsip(Pamplona et al., 2006)ns+ndip(Pamplona et al., 2008)WIN 55,212-2 (CB1 Ag)ns+4nsBLA(Ganon-Elazar & Akirav, 2013))ns+4nsHPC(Ganon-Elazar & Akirav, 2013)nsNo effect4nsmPFC(Ganon-Elazar & Akirav, 2013)ns+No effect (Re-in, SR3)IL(Lin et al., 2009)No training+nsIL(Lin et al., 2009)nsNo effectnsPL(Kuhnert et al., 2013)HU210No training+nsIL(Lin et al., 2009)URB597 (AEA hydrolysis inhibitor)No training+nsIL(Lin et al., 2009)AM3506 (FAAH inhibitor) + SR141716A\n\n(CB1 ant)nsNo effectnsip + BLA(Gunduz-Cinar et al., 2013b)AM3506 (FAAH inhibitor)ns+nsBLA(Gunduz-Cinar et al., 2013b)No trainingNo effectnsBLA(Gunduz-Cinar et al., 2013b)Cannabidiol + SR141716A (CB1 ant)No effectNo effectnsIL + ip(Do Monte et al., 2013)Reduced cannabinoid signalingDrug/manipulationExtnction\n\nlearningExtinction retrievalLongterm extinctionAdministration routeReferenceCB1 KO−−nsNo drug(Cannich et al., 2004)CB1 KO−nsnsNo drug((Dubreucq et al., 2010); (Kamprath et al., 2006);\n\n(Marsicano et al., 2002); (Plendl & Wotjak, 2010))D1-CB1 KO−nsnsNo drug(Terzian et al., 2011)SR141716A CB1 antnsNo effect1nssc(Marsicano et al., 2002)−nsnssc, ip((Kamprath et al., 2006); (Niyuhire et al., 2007);\n\n(Plendl & Wotjak, 2010)ns−1nsip(Suzuki et al., 2004)−No effectnsip(Pamplona et al., 2006, 2008)ns−nsip(Chhatwal et al., 2005b)−##No effectnsip(Bowers & Ressler, 2015)AM251 (CB1 inverse ag)−nsnsip(Reich et al., 2008)ns−1nsdCA1(de Oliveira Alvares et al., 2008)ns−nsIL(Lin et al., 2009)No trainingNo effectnsIL(Lin et al., 2009)ns−nsPL(Kuhnert et al., 2013)\n\nFollowing up on these studies, intra-cerebral infusions of CB1-receptor agonists and antagonists have revealed a potential role of mPFC-BLA eCB signaling in extinction [see , (Do Monte et al., 2013; Ganon-Elazar & Akirav, 2013; Gunduz-Cinar et al., 2013b)]. CB1-receptor activation inhibits both presynaptic glutamate and GABA release. The release of anandamide and concomitant CB1-receptor activation induce long-term depression of inhibitory transmission (LTDi) in the BLA (Azad et al., 2004; Gunduz-Cinar et al., 2013b). In addition, a recent study demonstrated that enhanced inhibitory input via activation of CB1 receptor expressing cholecystokinin (CCK) positive interneurons selectively reduces firing of BLA fear neurons and promotes extinction (Trouche et al., 2013). Of note is the fact that it has also been shown that one potential mechanism for the CB1 effect on extinction within the AMY is via blockade of CCK release, as an intra-AMY CCK antagonist reversed the extinction blockade of systemic CB1 antagonists, and CCK agonists block extinction (Chhatwal et al., 2009).\n\nIn summary, current preclinical data suggest that eCB signaling gates BLA function through plastic changes, including a long-lasting depression of inhibition, to modulate extinction-related AMY activity. Initial results from clinical studies in healthy volunteers suggest that exogenous cannabinoid administration strengthens extinction and protects against reinstatement [see , (Das et al., 2013; Rabinak et al., 2013)]. Future clinical trials in extinction-impaired PTSD patients will be needed to show whether cannabinoids (or substances which increase endogenous eCB signaling, such as FAAH inhibitors) might prove useful as adjuncts to CBT-based therapy.\n\nTable 6A\n\nDisorderStudy designOutcome (compared to placebo control group)ReferenceHealthy volunteersFear conditioning paradigm, cannabidiol inhalation prior or\n\nfollowing extinctionReduced fear in retrieval\n\nProtection against reinstatement(Das et al., 2013)Healthy volunteersFear conditioning paradigm, tetrahydrocannabinol prior extinctionNo effect(Klumpers et al., 2012)Healthy volunteersFear conditioning paradigm, Dronabinol prior extinctionReduced fear in retrieval(Rabinak et al., 2013)\n\n4.7. Neuropeptides (oxytocin, neuropeptide Y, neuropeptide S, opioids)\n\nVarious neuropeptides and their corresponding receptors are localized in brain regions mediating emotional behavior and stress response and have been considered as potential anxiolytic drug targets (Bowers et al., 2012; Ebner et al., 2009; Griebel & Holmes, 2013). While other neuroptides such as hypocretin/Orexin (Flores et al., 2014) may also be involved in fear extinction, we will here address the role of oxytocin, neuropeptide Y, neuropeptide S and opioids in extinction.\n\n4.7.1. Oxytocin\n\nThe oxytocin (OXT) system, strongly implicated in social cognition and behavior, is posited to play a role in anxiety disorders with impaired social functioning (Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2011; Neumann & Landgraf, 2012). OXT is synthesized in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus and processed along the axonal projections to the posterior pituitary gland. Upon neuronal activation OXT is released from secretory vesicles into the peripheral circulation as neurohypophyseal hormone. The central nervous system (CNS) component of OXT is derived from dendritic release of the same cell population (Ludwig & Leng, 2006), as well as from the OXT-synthesizing parvocellular PVN cells sending projections throughout the brain [reviewed in (Gimpl & Fahrenholz, 2001)]. OXT receptors are typically Gq-protein coupled and have potential allosteric binding sites for Mg2+ and steroids like cholesterol. The distribution of OXT receptors has not been fully delineated, but OXT fibers and neurosecretory nerve endings have been described in, among other regions, the AMY [especially CeL (Knobloch et al., 2012; Veinante & Freund-Mercier, 1997)], the dorsal and ventral HPC and the main monoamine nuclei – substantia nigra (dopamine), raphe nuclei (serotonin) and the locus coeruleus (noradrenaline) [see (Gimpl & Fahrenholz, 2001) for review).\n\nRegulatory effects of OXT on stress-induced activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, as well as direct OXT effects on the brain and specific parts of the extinction circuitry, can affect fear extinction in various ways. Intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of OXT prior to fear conditioning does not affect fear learning but facilitates later extinction acquisition and retrieval (Toth et al., 2012a). Conversely, OXT receptor antagonists impair extinction learning and retrieval when administered icv prior to fear acquisition (Toth et al., 2012a). More localized OXY infusions into the central CeA reduce fear expression by inhibiting CeM excitatory output to fear-eliciting brainstem structures (Huber et al., 2005) (Viviani et al., 2011), suggesting one possible mechanism for the effects of icv OXY on extinction.\n\nAnother potential mechanism might be OXT-induced dampening of stress-induced activation of the HPA axis (de Oliveira et al., 2012; Heinrichs et al., 2003; Quirin et al., 2011; Windle et al., 1997). As explained in more detail in Section 4.8 Glucocorticoids, glucocorticoid release during an actual learning process facilitates cognitive processing [reviewed in (Bentz et al., 2010)], hence the release of endogenous OXT during traumatic experiences (Zoicas et al., 2012) may interfere with the consolidation of fear memories. Along these lines, OXT-mediated reduction of HPA axis activity and subsequent lower glucocorticoid levels could interfere with fear acquisition, resulting in a weaker fear memory that is more susceptible to extinction training. In this context, OXT administration either icv or intra BLA prior to extinction training disrupts extinction learning [(Toth et al., 2012a) (Lahoud & Maroun, 2013) see for summary]. OXT infusions into the dorsolateral septum prior to extinction training have the opposite effect and facilitate extinction learning and retrieval in a social fear conditioning paradigm that may recruit a somewhat different neural circuitry than non-social forms of fear (Zoicas et al., 2012).\n\nTable 7\n\nNeuropeptidesDrug/manipulationExtinction trainingExtinction retrievalLongterm extinctionRouteReferenceOxytocin−nsnsicv(Toth et al., 2012a)+#+nsDLS(Zoicas et al., 2012)−*5−*5nsip(Eskandarian et al., 2013)Chronic oxytocin (30d)nsNo effect6nsin(Bales et al., 2014)NPY++nsicv(Gutman et al., 2008)NPY KO−3***−nsNo drug(Verma et al., 2012)NPY Y1 KO−No effectnsNo drug(Verma et al., 2012)NPY Y2KONo effectNo effectnsNo drug(Verma et al., 2012)NPY Y1/Y2 KO−−nsNo drug(Verma et al., 2012)Leu31Pro-NPY (Y1 ag)ns+nsBLA(Lach & de Lima, 2013)BIBO 3304 (Y1 ant)ns−nsBLA(Gutman et al., 2008)NPS(+)4No effectNo effectBLA(Jungling et al., 2008)+nsnsicv(Slattery et al., in press)SHA68 (NPS-R ant)−)4, ***−− (Ren-A)BLA(Jungling et al., 2008)Naloxone−−nsSystemic(McNally & Westbrook, 2003)nsNo effect1nsSystemic(McNally & Westbrook, 2003)−−nsvlPAG(McNally et al., 2004)−−nsvlPAG(Parsons et al., 2010)No effectNo effectnsBLA(Parsons et al., 2010)CTAP (MOR ant)−−nsvlPAG(McNally et al., 2005)Dynorphin KO−3−nsNo drug(Bilkei-Gorzo et al., 2012)nor-BNI (KOR ant)ns−1nsSystemic(Bilkei-Gorzo et al., 2012)\n\nConsidering that systemically applied neuropeptides do not cross the blood–brain-barrier, clinical use of neuropeptides would require a direct pathway to the human brain. In the case of OXT, this may be feasible via intranasal administration (Born et al., 2002). Intranasal OXT administration has been demonstrated to reduce stress-induced cortisol release in humans (de Oliveira et al., 2012; Heinrichs et al., 2003; Quirin et al., 2011), and to attenuate AMY hyperactivity as well as AMY-hindbrain coupling in anxiety patients [(Kirsch et al., 2005; Labuschagne et al., 2010)]. In a recent study investigating the effects of intranasal OXT treatment on fear extinction in healthy volunteers, OXT increased initial fear expression during extinction training, but this effect was gone by the end of training and there was a lower level of fear in the OXT treated group in extinction retrieval (Acheson et al., 2013). These data raise the prospect of OXT-augmented CBT effectiveness.\n\n4.7.2. Neuropeptide Y\n\nNeuropeptide Y (NPY) contains 36 amino acids and is the most widely expressed neuropeptide in the mammalian brain. There are particularly high concentrations of NPY in the limbic system, including in the AMY, the HPC and the periaqueductal gray. Six G-protein coupled NPY receptors (Y1–6) have been identified, among which Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5 mediate central effects. Y1 mRNA is present at a high level in brain areas involved in memory processing, namely the AMY, HPC, thalamus, hypothalamus, and the cerebral cortex. The AMY, HPC, and hypothalamus are also rich in Y2 receptors, while Y5 receptors can be detected in HPC, cingulate cortex and thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei (Parker & Herzog, 1999) [reviewed in (Holmes et al., 2003)].\n\nIcv administration of NPY facilitates extinction learning (Gutman et al., 2008), while genetic deletion of NPY disrupts extinction acquisition and subsequent retrieval (Verma et al., 2012). Extinction deficits caused by NPY knock-out are rescued by AAV-mediated NPY re-expression in the BLA (Verma et al., 2012), where NPY co-localizes with GABAergic neurons modifying inhibitory control of BLA projection neurons (McDonald & Pearson, 1989). To elucidate which NPY receptors mediate the BLA-associated effects on extinction, the consequences of gene deletion via either deletion of Y1 or Y2 receptors or double Y1/Y2 deletion have been examined. Deletion of Y1 receptors impaired extinction learning, while Y2 receptor deletion had no effect (Verma et al., 2012). Underscoring the importance to extinction of Y1 receptors in the BLA, local infusion of the Y1 agonist Leu31Pro34-NPY prior to extinction training led to stronger extinction retrieval (Gutman et al., 2008; Lach & de Lima, 2013). Further studies are required to further delineate the underlying mechanisms of Y1-mediated facilitation of extinction, and to investigate the potential clinical use of NPY and Y1 receptor agonism as adjunctive therapy to CBT.\n\n4.7.3. Neuropeptide S\n\nNeuropeptide S (NPS) is synthesized in neurons located adjacent to the locus coeruleus (Xu et al., 2007) and binds to G-protein coupled NPS receptors expressed in the BLA among other areas. Intra-BLA infusion of exogenous NPS accelerates extinction learning, while BLA NPS receptor antagonism (via SHA68) impairs extinction learning and retrieval and increases fear renewal (Chauveau et al., 2012; Jungling et al., 2008) ( ). NPS treatment also rescues deficient extinction learning in hyperanxious rats (Slattery et al., in press), exhibiting aberrant cortico-AMY activation (Muigg et al., 2008). The activation of NPS receptors in the BLA increases excitatory input to GABAergic ITCs, thus increasing feed-forward inhibition to CeM neurons and reducing fear expression (Meis et al., 2008; Meis et al., 2011; Pape et al., 2010). Exogenous NPS administration is also associated with enhanced DA release in the mPFC (Si et al., 2010), suggesting another mechanism for strengthening extinction (see Section 4.2 Dopaminergic system).\n\nUnderscoring the translational relevance of NPS, healthy human volunteers carrying the NPS receptor polymorphism rs324981, which potentiates NPS efficacy at the receptor, show enhanced extinction in a virtual reality fear potentiated startle paradigm (Glotzbach-Schoon et al., 2013). Additional studies are required to assess whether increasing NPS signaling improves extinction in anxiety patients. This would be aided by the development of small molecule NPS receptor agonists.\n\n4.7.4. Opioids\n\nThe opioid peptide family comprises different members including endorphins, enkephalins, dynorphins and hemorphins. The 3 classical opioid receptors [µ (MOR), κ (KOR) and δ (DOR)] show heterogeneous expression throughout the brain and are located in extinction-relevant brain areas including the AMY, mPFC and HPC. Typically, MOR, KOR and DORs are coupled to Gi-proteins, reducing (in most cases) net neuronal excitability and reducing neurotransmitter release upon activation [reviewed in (Nutt, 2014)].\n\nThere is evidence that morphine application (intended for pain management) following an acute trauma attenuates the incidence of PTSD at later timepoints (Bryant et al., 2009; Holbrook et al., 2010; Melcer et al., 2014; Szczytkowski-Thomson et al., 2013). Aside from this potential PTSD preventing property of opioids, several studies have tried to determine the importance of opioids in extinction.\n\nSystemic administration of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (which has highest affinity to MOR, but also inhibits KOR and DOR) impairs extinction when given prior to extinction training (McNally & Westbrook, 2003; McNally et al., 2004) but not when applied after extinction training or prior to retrieval, see ). Subsequent investigations have demonstrated that extinction-impairing effects are mediated by MORs in the PAG [as shown with the selective MOR antagonist CTAP in the PAG (McNally, 2005; Parsons et al., 2010)].\n\nThe AMY ITCs express high levels of MOR (Busti et al., 2011), and lesioning of MOR-expressing neurons in the ITCs following extinction training impairs extinction retrieval (Likhtik et al., 2008), indicating that MOR signaling in the ITCs contributes to extinction consolidates. Probably due to the high addiction potential of MOR agonists, no clinical studies have investigated their potential in CBT. However, treatment with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone prior to exposure therapy is associated with reduced treatment success (Arntz et al., 1993; Egan et al., 1988), which is in accordance with preclinical results ( ).\n\nAnother opioid receptor gaining attention in the field of fear extinction is the KOR, activated by endogenous dynorphins (reviewed in Schwarzer, 2009). Human volunteers with single nucleotide polymorphisms in the prodynorphin gene showed increased skin conductance (a physiological measure of fear) during fear extinction training and blunted functional connectivity between AMY and mPFC (Bilkei-Gorzo et al., 2012). Along these lines, genetic deletion of dynorphin or systemic antagonism of KORs in rodents impairs extinction learning and reduces neuronal activity in the BLA and mPFC (Bilkei-Gorzo et al., 2012). In contrast to these extinction-impairing effects, systemic administration of KOR antagonists protects against fear renewal (Cole et al., 2011) – an effect mimicked by local infusions into the ventral HPC (Cole et al., 2013). Additional studies will help clarify these effects and their possible relevance to clinical use of opioidergic drugs in conjunction with exposure-based therapies.\n\n4.8. Glucocorticoids\n\nEmotionally arousing experiences activate the HPA axis and the release of glucocorticoids (GCs) into the bloodstream. GCs which include cortisol in humans, and corticosterone in rodents are lipophilic and readily cross the blood–brain-barrier to interact with glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in the brain. GRs are widely expressed throughout the brain including the AMY, HPC and PFC (Bentz et al., 2010). Early pioneering studies reported that extinction-memory formation is disrupted by adrenalectomy (Silva, 1973), as well as, more recently, by compounds that antagonize GRs, such as mifepristone (Yang et al., 2006), or that inhibit corticosterone synthesis [metapyrone, (Barrett & Gonzalez-Lima, 2004; Blundell et al., 2011; Harrison et al., 1990; Yang et al., 2006, 2007)] (see ). Conversely, systemic administration of corticosterone (Blundell et al., 2011) or the GR agonists dexamethasone or RU28362 (Ninomiya et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2006, 2007) facilitate the consolidation of aversive and appetitive extinction memories (see ).\n\nTable 8\n\nFacilitating glucocorticoid signalingDrugExtinction trainingExtinction retrievalLong-term extinctionRouteReferenceCorticosterone (GR/MR ag)ns+1No effect (Re-in)ip(Blundell et al., 2011)ns−2nsip(Den et al., 2014)Dexamethasone (GR ag)ns+nsip(Ninomiya et al., 2010); (Yang et al., 2006, 2007)RU28362 (GR ag)ns+nsAMY(Yang et al., 2006)Ganoxolone (allopregnanolone analog)+*3+*3nsip(Pinna & Rasmusson, 2014)Inhibiting glucocorticoid signalingMetyrapone (CORT/cortisol synthesis inhibitor)No effect−−*sc(Barrett & Gonzalez-Lima, 2004); (Clay et al., 2011)ns−nssc(Blundell et al., 2011); (Yang et al., 2006, 2007)Mifepristone (GR and progesterone ant)ns−nsAMY(Yang et al., 2006)\n\nHow can stress hormones promote the formation of extinction memories? Cytosolic GRs induce genomic responses by binding to glucocorticoid responsive elements within promoter regions of GC-responsive genes, and act as transcription factors inducing the expression of learning-related genes. In addition, membrane-bound GRs can induce non-genomic actions of relevance to extinction, including the synthesis of eCBs (see Section 4.6 Cannabinoids) from membrane phospholipids (Di et al., 2003; Hill et al., 2005, 2011). Further supporting a link between GRs and eCBs, and possibly of importance in GC-augmented extinction consolidation, adrenalectomy leads to reduced CB-1 receptor expression (Mailleux & Vanderhaeghen, 1993) and GC-mediated memory consolidation is prevented by CB-1 receptor antagonists (Campolongo et al., 2009).\n\nGRs can also induce indirect learning-relevant genomic actions via activation of intracellular signaling cascades such as the ERK/MAPK pathway (reviewed in Reul, 2014) in cooperation with other neuro-transmitter systems or ion channels including β-adrenoceptors (Roozendaal et al., 2008), and L-type calcium channels (Karst et al., 2002). These interrelated effects are functionally relevant, given that the infusion of β-adrenoceptor antagonists into the BLA blocks the memory-facilitating effects of systemically administered glucocorticoids (Quirarte et al., 1997; Roozendaal et al., 2002).\n\nAnother important functional interaction occurs between GCs and the glutamate system. GCs potentiate glutamatergic signaling via genomic and non-genomic mechanisms, by (i) increasing the readily releasable pool of presynaptic glutamate vesicles, and (ii) enhancing NMDA and AMPA receptor surface expression through increased receptor trafficking (reviewed in Popoli et al., 2012). The concomitant activation of GC and NMDA receptors, which can occur during emotionally arousing experiences, induces downstream nuclear mechanisms that result in histone modifications (reviewed in Reul, 2014), an epigenetic mechanism implicated in extinction (see Section 4.10: Epigenetics for details). Underscoring the potential importance of emotional arousal and thus of GC release in this process, pretreatment with the anxiolytic BZD lorazepam (resulting in reduced arousal in response to the stressor) blocked epigenetic modifications on Histone H3, while application of the anxiogenic BZD inverse agonist FG7142 (Singewald et al., 2003) induced transcription facilitating acetylation and phosphorylation on histone tails (Papadopoulos et al., 2011). These epigenetic effects could contribute to the aforementioned extinction impairing effects of BZDs (see Section 4.5: γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and ).\n\nIn contrast to the effects of acute GC elevations, chronic high levels of corticosterone reduce cell-surface NMDA and AMPA receptor expression (Gourley et al., 2009). This loss of critical plasticity mechanisms might be one explanation as to why anxiety patients with a history of repeated traumatic events, such as combat veterans, show greater resistance to treatment. However, a considerable proportion of PTSD patients have reduced cortisol levels (Yehuda, 2004) and small case studies suggest that there are beneficial effects of CBT and adjunctive cortisol administration in PTSD patients (Yehuda et al., 2010). A number of larger studies are under way to extend this work ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT01108146\",\"term_id\":\"NCT01108146\"}}NCT01108146, {\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT00751855\",\"term_id\""
