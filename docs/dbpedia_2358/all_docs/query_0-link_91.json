SULDERITS/SOLDERITS, HUTTER, KROPF, FORJAN, Inzenhof. Settled in America before 1850. Religion: Roman Catholic. Ancestors attended St. Emmerisch just over the Hungarian border. Johann SULDERITS, Sr. (great grandfather) was born about 1865-70. His wife Maria HUTTER (great grandmother) was born about 1870. I do not know Johann's parents, but Maria's parents were Leopold and Maria Hutter, who had four children: Maria (Johann's wife), Rose (m. BLAUKOVICH), Francesca (m. John GOLLINGER) and Leopold, Jr. Francesca (Fanny) HUTTER GOLLINGER emigrated from Inzenhof to Coplay (PA), in the early 1920s and her daughter Mary (m. John TAKER) emigrated with Lou's grandparents to America in 1929. Johann SULDERITS, Sr. and his wife Maria had at least one child Johann SOLDERITS/SOLDERITSCH (Lou's grandfather). He was born in Inzenhof on May 18, 1890. His wife Theresia FORJAN (Lou's grandmother) was born on January 8, 1897; presumably in this same area of Burgenland. Theresia's parents were Anton FORJAN and Theresia KROFT. Johann SULDERITS/SOLDERITS/SOLDERITSCH and his wife Theresia emigrated from Inzenhof in 1923 to Coplay, PA, leaving their three children temporarily in the care of their grandparents at their farm at 138 Inzenhof bei Gussing. They were Maria SOLDERITS (Lou's mother, b. 1915, in Inzenhof), Johann (aka John Wayne b. 1917 in Inzenhof), and Hedwig (b. 1919). The children were finally reunited with their parents in Cleveland (OH), in 1929. John SOLDERITSCH, Jr. returned to live out his life in Inzenhof, but Theresia remained in Cleveland (OH) to raise their five children --- Mary (Lou's mother), John, Hattie, Albert, and Emil. She died there on Feb. 23, 1969. We do not know exactly when John died, but he supposedly took his own life on his parents' farm. I know there are other SOLDERITSCH families who lived in Coplay (PA), but I am not sure how they are related to Lou's family. My theory is that Johann, Jr. may have had siblings or possibly uncles that we do not know about. I would love to know more about these Solderitsch families.\n\nEric W Schuster; Greenville, MS.

STRANZL, Urbersdorf, BOCK, HÃ¶ll, KREITNER, Mischendorf, SCHMIDT, Moschendorf. Josef Lewis Stranzl (1885-1967) was the son of Louis (Alois?) Stranzl (b.1860?) and Josephine Monshein. Josef emigrated at 17 in 1903 to Northampton, PA, and married Rosina Schmidt, later moving to Coplay for a short time before returning to Ehrensdorf in 1910. They left their two-year-old first-born daughter Marie (Mary) Stranzl (1908-1971) to be raised by her grandparents in Glasing until she was 14 and was called to return to the US to work in 1922. Josef had a brother Alois Stranzl (who may or may not have emigrated to the US) and a sister Rosina Titz (Tietz) nÃ©e Stranzl who emigrated to the US and settled in Coplay, PA in 1923. My paternal grandfather, Michael S Bock (1903-1987), the son of Michel Bock (b.1875?) and Julianna Gillinger (b.1880?) emigrated to Coplay in 1923. He married Marie Stranzl with whom he had a daughter Marie Seyfried nÃ©e Bock (my mother), and they remained in the Coplay/Hokendauqua area. Michael had a brother George (who remained in HÃ¶ll) and two sisters, Angeloi (who I believe with her family was left behind the Iron Curtain post WWII), and Maria Pouil (Paul) nÃ©e Bock (1916? - 2011) from Mischendorf area. Maria was the youngest and had one daughter Margarethe Kreitner nÃ©e Paul (1938-2018). I am searching for earlier records of births, deaths, marriages, or others to locate the ancestors of Michael Bock still remaining in Burgenland or nearby regions.
