        "text": "Historical note: As noted in the history quoted below, the 6th Judicial District was formed as a result of an Act by the Colorado legislature in March of 1881. [Prior to that, parts of it were included in the 4th Judicial District; La Plata County was in the 7th District, presided over by Judge M. B. Gerry.] As first formed that District encompassed the San Luis Valley region, plus Fremont and Custer counties. In February of 1885, the legislature removed those two counties from that district and added the counties of La Plata, San Juan and Dolores. A third act, in March of 1887, added Archuleta and Huerfano counties to the District. In 1891 the legislature passed an Act (vetoed by Governor Routt but overridden by both houses) dividing the State into thirteen Judicial Districts, which formed the 6th District as it was henceforth known.\n\nThe sources of this historical information are all in Series 18.5 in Collection M 028 (La Plata County Government records), and include:\n\nAnonymous, \"District Courts of the San Luis Valley.\"\n\nColorado Session Laws, 1881-.\n\nMcMechen, Edgar C., Executive Director, The State Historical Society of Colorado, letter to Judge James M. Noland, October 16, 1947.\n\n6th Judicial Court (La Plata County, Colo.) judges list\n\nA HISTORY OF THE DISTRICT COURTS OF THE SAN LUIS VALLEY\n\n[Author unknown. Source: partial typescript in Collection M 028, Series 18.5]\n\nWhen Colorado Territory was organized on February 28, 1861, the judicial sections of the Organic Act of Congress divided the territory into three judicial districts and provided for a District Court in each. The Supreme Court of the territory was to consist of a Chief Justice and two associate justices, Each justice was assigned one of the judicial districts, and between sessions of the Supreme Court, they presided over the District Courts, which were to be held in each of the county seats of the seventeen counties in the territory. Territorial Judges were appointed by the President of the United States for a four year term.\n\nThe Organic Act had authorized the Governor to define \"temporarily and until otherwise provided by law\" judicial districts, assign judges, and appoint times and places for court terms.\n\nBy proclamation issued July 11, 1861, Governor William Gilpin established and assigned temporary districts. The first Territorial Assembly convened in Denver on September 9,1861, and on November 8, 1861, established judicial districts, and assigned Judges to the 1st and 2nd Judicial Districts. No judge was assigned to the 3rd Judicial District at this time because a vacancy already existed. Initially, the 3rd Judicial District consisted of the then existing counties of Lake, Fremont, Pueblo, Huerfano, Conejos and Costilla.\n\nThe Second Territorial Assembly, by an Act dated August 15, 1862, realigned the judicial districts. The 3rd Judicial District was to consist of the then existing counties of Conejos, Costilla, Huerfano, Pueblo, Fremont and El Paso. Judge Allen A. Bradford was assigned to the 3rd Judicial District.\n\nJudge Charles Lee Armour of Maryland, appointed March 28, 1861, was assigned to the 2nd Judicial District, with court at Central City. He became so unpopular within a year after his arrival at Central City that, after petitions for his removal had proved unavailing, the legislature by an Act adopted March 5, 1864, redistricted the territory - our first legislative gerrymander - and assigned him to the new 3rd Judicial District consisting only of the Counties of Conejos and Costilla.\n\n\"But with sublime defiance, he refused to visit his adobe castles in Spain or resign his office - but smilingly smoked his imported cigars, sipped his toddies, of which he was fond, drew his salary, of which he was fonder, and held out his term of office as a gentleman of elegant leisure\". Justice Wilbur F. Stone, 34 Colo. XXV (1905).\n\nJudge Armour \"completed\" his term on March 28, 1865, and returned back East from whence he came.\n\nWith the impending departure of Judge Armour, the legislature on February 10, 1865, restored geographic equality to the judicial districts and the 3rd Judicial District was expanded to include the then existing Counties of El Paso, Fremont, Pueblo, Huerfano, Costilla and Conejos, and re-assigned Judge Stephen S. Harding from the 1st Judicial District to the 3rd Judicial District. There is no evidence that Judge Harding entered into the San Luis Valley wilderness and he precipitously resigned on December 31, 1865, and returned to his native state of Indiana.\n\nThe \"vagabond\" era ended with the appointment of Judge Moses Hallett on April 10, 1866. Judge Hallett was assigned as the District Judge of the 3rd Judicial District, and he held that position until the first State Judges were elected on October 3, 1876.\n\nExtant records in the San Luis Valley Courthouses indicate that the first term of the Territorial District Court in the San Luis Valley was held in San Luis on August 8, 1866, Judge Moses Hallett presiding. For the next 10 years Judge Hallett continued to \"ride the circuit\" in the 3rd Judicial District. Arrival in the County seats of the Judge and his retinue, which included his clerk, a reporter, often an interpreter, attorneys, clients of the attorneys, and even prisoners, was cause for great celebration.\n\nIt should be noted that the District Judges of the San Luis Valley still \"ride the circuit\". The only difference being that they now use automobiles and airplanes rather than horses and wagons.\n\nThe judicial article of the Constitution of the State of Colorado provided for four judicial districts in 1876. Included within the 4th Judicial District were the then existing counties of the San Luis Valley (Costilla, Conejos, Rio Grande and Saguache), together with the then existing counties of San Juan, La Plata, Hinsdale and Lake.\n\nHowever, in the early years of statehood judicial district boundaries were in a bi-annual state of change from 1877 until 1891 as new counties were created at almost every session of the legislature. No doubt a certain amount of politics was involved also in the shaping and re-shaping of judicial districts in these early years. In 1877, the counties of Gunnison and Ouray were created and attached to the 4th Judicial District.\n\nOn January 30, 1879, the legislature passed an Act expanding the counties within the 4th Judicial District to include the counties of Chaffee, Park, Carbonate and El Paso. This briefly brought the thriving \"metropolis\" of Colorado Springs within the 4th Judicial District.\n\nRecognizing the need to reduce the size of Judicial Districts, the legislature, on March 55, 1881, passed an Act dividing the State of Colorado into seven judicial districts. The new 6th Judicial District consisted of the then existing counties of the San Luis Valley, together with the then existing counties of Fremont and Custer.\n\nOn February 13, 1885, the legislature passed an Act changing the counties within the 6th Judicial District. Fremont and Custer counties were attached to the 3rd Judicial District and the 6th Judicial District was expanded to encompass the then existing counties of the San Luis Valley, together with the then existing counties of Archuleta, La Plata, San Juan and Dolores.\n\nOn March 24, 1887, the legislature passed an Act further dividing the State of Colorado into nine judicial districts. The counties within the 6th Judicial District remained unchanged. Added to the 6th Judicial District was the county of Huerfano.\n\nFinally, some degree of judicial stability was achieved when, on April 6, 1891, the legislature passed an Act dividing the state into thirteen judicial districts. The 12th Judicial District encompassed the San Luis Valley. In 1891, the San Luis Valley consisted of the counties of Costilla, Conejos, Rio Grande and Saguache. In 1893, Mineral County was created out of parts of Hinsdale, Rio Grande and Saguache counties and was attached to the 12th Judicial District. Alamosa County was created out of parts of Conejos and Costilla Counties in 1913 and was also attached to the 12th Judicial District. Today, the 12th Judicial District consists of the counties of Alamosa, Conejos, Costilla, Rio Grande, Mineral and Saguache.\n\nJudicial Districts remained stable until the l4th Judicial District was added in 1921; the 15th was added in 19^5; the 16th in 1953; the 17th and 18th in 1958; and the 19th through 22nd Judicial Districts were created by Act of the 1964 legislature.\n\nThe District Court is Colorado's trial court of general jurisdiction. It has original jurisdiction in domestic relations, civil, juvenile, probate, mental health and criminal cases. It has appellate jurisdiction in connection with appeals from County Courts.\n\nTrial Courts of general jurisdiction are distributed geographically throughout the state so that citizens will have easy arid convenient access to them. This is done by dividing the state into judicial districts and establishing a court for each geographical unit. There is a district judge for each geographical unit; and in judicial districts where judicial business is heavy, more than one judge is appointed or elected. The largest District Court in Colorado is in Denver (2nd Judicial District) where there are twenty-five judges.\n\nBy an Act approved March 28, 1951, an additional judgeship was created for the 12th Judicial District, consisting of the six Counties of the San Luis Valley, and there have been two district judges in the San Luis Valley since 1951.\n\nAt the time Colorado became a state, it had a population of 194,100 and was served by 4 district judges; in 1950 the population of the state was 1,325,000 of which 30 were district judges; in 1960 the population increased to 1,786,000 and there were 39 district judges; by 1970 the population had increased to 2,178,000 and the number of district judges had increased to 75; in 1980 the. total state population continued to show dramatic growth and was recorded at 2,888,834 with 107 district judges attempting to handle the resulting litigation.\n\nA 1966 Amendment to the State Constitution changed the method of selecting and removing judges. Previously, judges were elected on partisan ballots. Vacancies are now filled by appointment, and judges run for retention in office on non-competitive ballots.\n\nUnder the provisions of the 1966 Amendment to the Judicial Article of the State Constitution, District Court Judges are appointed initially for a two-year term and then run on their record for retention in office at the next general election for a term of six years.\n\nDistrict Court Judges must be qualified electors of the district in which they are appointed to serve and must have been licensed to practice law in Colorado for five years prior to their appointment.\n\nEffective January 17, 1967, Article VI, Section 5(4) of the Colorado Constitution provides that the Chief Justice shall appoint a Chief Judge for each judicial district to exercise supervisory and administrative powers over all judges of all courts within each district.\n\nSince 1967, the Chief Judges of the 12th Judicial District have been:\n\n1967-1973 Richard E. Concur\n\n1973-1980 Whitford W. Mayers\n\n1980- Robert W. Ogburn\n\nThe Water Right Determination and Administration Act of 1969 set up seven water divisions in the state and established in each the position of Water Judge. The Supreme Court selects the Water Judges for each division from among the judges of the District Courts of the district situated entirely or partly within the division. The Water Judges have jurisdiction in the determination of water rights, uses and administration of water and all other water matters within the jurisdiction. Water Division Three consists generally of the Counties of the San Luis Valley, together with those parts of Archuleta, Hinsdale and San Juan Counties located within the Rio Grande Basin.\n\nThe Water Judges of Water Division Three, since its creation in 1969, have been:\n\n1969-1973 Richard E. Concur\n\n1973-1976 Donald G. Smith\n\n1976- Robert W. Ogburn\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF SAN LUIS VALLEY DISTRICT JUDGES\n\n3RD JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n\nAllen A.

Haas: (The source of the following paragraph is Shane Benjamin's article in the Durango Herald on November 2, 2004, following the death of Senior District Judge Haas at his home in La Plata County on October 30, 2004:) \"Haas moved to Durango in 1957 and took the job of assistant district attorney. He was elected to serve as district attorney in 1960 and was re-elected in 1964. Two years later, Haas resigned and began a private practice in Durango. He practiced privately until then-Gov. Richard Lamm appointed him to the bench in April 1981. He served until his mandatory retirement in May 1996, just before his 72nd birthday. After one year, he returned to work as a senior judge - a status that allowed him to work a limited number of hours at the discretion of chief judges. ... Haas is largely responsible for an expansion at the La Plata County Courthouse that includes the clock tower, said Steve Brittain, chief probation officer for the 6th Judicial District. Similar to the debate today, many people in the 1980s believed the courthouse should be relocated to Bodo Industrial Park. Haas felt strongly that the courthouse should stay in downtown Durango, and he helped convince county commissioners to expand the building, Brittain said. ... In addition to serving as a judge, Haas served in the U.S. Army, 1st Infantry Division, during World War II from July 1942 to April 1946, including campaigns in Sicily and North Africa. He graduated from Denver University with a bachelor's degree in 1949 and his law degree in 1951. He was a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks No. 507 and the Colorado Bar Association.\"\n\nThis guide was produced by Todd Ellison, Certified Archivist, Center of Southwest Studies.
