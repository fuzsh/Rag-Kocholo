The population was 1,221 at the 2010 census.\n\nLivingston Manor is located in the southern part of the town of Rockland. New York State Route 17 runs by it.\n\nHistory[]\n\nIn the late 19th century, this community renamed itself as Livingston Manor, after descendants of the prominent Livingston family who had a house there. But it was not part of the original manor, a huge estate granted by the English Crown about 60 miles (97 km) east in present-day Dutchess and Columbia counties. That extended on both sides of the Hudson River. In the early 18th century, the original manor was the site of work camps along the Hudson, where Palatine German refugees worked off their passage to New York paid by the Crown. They produced timber and supplies for the English navy. Later they were allowed to settle in the Schoharie and Mohawk valleys.\n\nThe Sullivan County community was part of the Hardenbergh patent in 1716, which included much of the Catskill Mountains.\n\nIn 1750 Robert Livingston (1708–1790) bought 95,000 acres (384 km2) in this area, shortly after becoming the third (and final) Lord of the Manor of Livingston Manor. He sold or leased most of the land by 1780. Robert's third son, John Robert Livingston (1775–1851),[1] deeded 8,441 acres (34.160 km2) to his nephew, Dr. Edward R. Livingston, in 1822 around the area then called Purvis, New York. Edward Livingston died in 1864.\n\nPurvis residents in 1882 chose the new name of Livingston Manor.[2] Edward Livingston's residence, according to a sign in the village, was on a site now occupied by the village firehouse.[2] Another town source says that it was on a site later developed as the Rockland, New York Town Hall.[3] In the 1930s a Livingston descendant arrived in Livingston Manor claiming title to his ancestral land, which had previously been held by tenants under lease. He won his case in court. The people whose ancestors had been tenants had to purchase the property they had been living on for years.\n\nOther early settlers were the Benton family. Their immigrant ancestors had come from Essex, England, in the mid-17th century, settling in Guilford, Connecticut. Records show some of their descendants migrated to in Sullivan County in the late 18th century from Connecticut, purchasing a large tract of land in what is now known as the Township of Liberty. They were likely Scots-Irish in ancestry. They took on many jobs in Sullivan County. Other families who acquired land and settled in the surrounding area were the Bascoms, Stewarts, Wests, Harringtons, Williams, Cochrans, Motts, Kimballs, Darbees, Woodards, Barnharts, and Joselyns. Some descendants of these families still reside in the area.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the village attracted immigrants from eastern Europe. Ashkenazy Jewish immigrants founded the Agudas Achim Synagogue. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.[4]\n\nFly fishing in the United States[]\n\nThe area claims to be the \"birthplace of fly-fishing in the United States\"[5] largely because of trout fishing on the 27-mile (43 km)-long Willowemoc Creek. It flows between the village and Roscoe, New York, where it intersects the Beaver Kill. The Catskill Fly Fishing Center and Museum is on the north edge of the town on the Willowemoc Creek.\n\nToday fish stocks in the Catskills are managed by state wildlife agents. All of the stocked fish (1 million pounds each year) for the Catskills, as well all the reservoirs in the New York City water supply, are bred at the Catskill Fish Hatchery just northeast of Livingston Manor in DeBruce, New York.[6]\n\nSince 2004, the community has sponsored an annual Trout Parade (organized by the Catskill Art Society and the Chamber of Commerce). It has been compared to the Mermaid Parade.[5]\n\nEducation[]\n\nLivingston Manor Central School District manages the public schools in the township. They consist of Livingston Manor Central School (middle and high school) and Livingston Manor Elementary School. Livingston Manor's Varsity softball team won the Class D Section 9 State title in 2011 and 2012. The Boys Varsity baseball team won the Class D Section 9 State title in 2012.[7]\n\nGeography[]\n\nLivingston Manor is located at (41.896061, -74.827348).[8] According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 3.1 square miles (8.0 km2), all land.\n\nDowntown[]\n\nThe downtown of Livingston Manor, mostly along Main Street, has several restaurants, a large grocery store, several art and antique shops. It is the scene of an annual \"trout parade\" in June that draws marching bands, fire trucks and other local amusements. The Catskill Art Society runs a non-profit multi-arts venue on Main Street, the CAS Arts Center, which offers exhibits on view in their galleries and fine arts classes to the community.[9]\n\nFlood problems[]\n\nThe Willowemoc Creek that runs through town cause flooding issues with the rain and storms that hit Livingston Manor.\n\nDemographics[]\n\nAs of the census[10] of 2000, there were 1,355 people, 515 households, and 330 families residing in the CDP.
