It lies within the Catskill Mountains region of New York and is part of the Delaware River watershed. The county's history can be traced back to the Lenape Native Americans who originally inhabited the region before European settlers arrived.\n\nEuropean settlement in Sullivan County began in the 17th century when Dutch and English traders established fur-trading posts along the Delaware River. The land was acquired by the British Crown in the late 17th century, after which it was granted to a group of English Quakers. The county was developed for agriculture and logging, with the industrial revolution of the 19th century bringing more mills, tanneries, and other industries to the area.\n\nSullivan County's population grew rapidly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, partly due to the construction of the Delaware and Hudson Canal and the New York, Ontario, and Western Railway. This allowed the county to ship goods, such as coal, farm, and dairy products, timber, and bluestone, to New York City and other areas.\n\nOne of the most iconic aspects of Sullivan County's history is its prominence in the Borscht Belt era (1920s-1970s), during which the county was a popular resort destination for Jewish families from New York City. Many grand hotels, luxurious resorts, and summer camps operated in the area, offering guests a variety of amenities and entertainment options that included top-notch performers like Jerry Lewis and Mel Brooks.\n\nA fun fact about Sullivan County is that it was the site of the famous Woodstock Music and Art Fair, which took place in the Town of Bethel from August 15 to August 18, 1969. Despite numerous challenges, including last-minute venue changes, the festival was a historic event that featured multiple legendary performances and became a symbol of freedom, love, and counterculture for generations to come. Today, the site of the festival is home to the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, which hosts concerts, events, and a museum dedicated to preserving the legacy of the Woodstock festival.\n\nFeatured Cities of New York"
