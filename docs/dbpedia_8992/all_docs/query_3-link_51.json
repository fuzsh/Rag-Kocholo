        "text": "Mercury Broadband was founded to help underserved and rural towns in America gain access to high-speed internet regardless of their location.\n\nWe set out on this mission as many internet service providers (ISPs) refuse to enter towns with a low population density. ISP either have no existing infrastructure in the area, or cannot find a way to get around housing restrictions.\n\nBecause of our unique, rural-focused business model, Mercury Broadband has the infrastructure to deliver true unlimited internet to towns like Summitville. What’s more, all of our plans for residential and commercial establishments include industrial-grade routers at no extra charge to ensure the entire location has reliable, fast-paced connections.\n\nSmall towns outside major urban centers or right in the middle of rural America often have difficulty finding a good internet provider. Existing plans can slow down dramatically during peak hours. Connectivity can also be spotty even off-peak hours, making every plan less than they’re worth.\n\nWith Mercury @ Home, you can be sure that every plan we have for internet at home is unlimited and caters to small towns. We maintain consistent high speeds during peak hours and ensure you have a reliable connection 24/7.\n\nWhat’s more, we make sure to hire hometown teams that live in or near our service areas. This ensures quick response to emergencies, as well as familiarity with any problems you may encounter while using our service.\n\nMercury @ Work™ ensures every device in your establishment has access to high speeds even at peak hours. Our business broadband plans enable timely communications, access to SaaS (software as a service) apps, and multiple internet connections without compromises to speed or latency.\n\nPlease don’t hesitate to call our dedicated business toll-free line for any inquiries about our Mercury @ Work™ plans or technical questions. Our customer service team is available to take your calls every day of the week.\n\nWe get it, you need a network that’s fast and reliable. It’s crucial for businesses to have speedy POS transactions, Wi-Fi for customers, online ordering systems, and connectivity for digital signage and RFID. But don’t worry, we take care of everything from installing to managing all the hardware and software. That way, you can focus on what really matters – running your business!\n\nA happy town in Madison County, Summitville historically thrived off the natural gas boom. Some historical sites still stand around the quiet town, surrounded by farmland, sports fields, and some big companies.\n\nSummitville is one of many small towns around Madison County that continues to live a quiet life just an hour off the I-69 from Indianapolis.\n\nIts neighbors Alexandria and Fairmount have interesting tourist stops. The World’s Largest Ball of Paint, made of five gallons of latex paint buckets, sits as a roadside attraction outside Alexandria. Up north, the James Dean Gallery invites fans of the late pop culture icon to browse through his memorabilia for free in Fairmount, his hometown and final resting place.\n\nMercury Broadband is expanding its hybrid fixed wireless and broadband networks to more than 122,000 underserved and rural locations. Our expansion is driven by our company mission of helping small towns and rural communities realize the full benefits of the internet without paying beyond their means or going without.\n\nWe have communities that have less than 1,000 people in town, to full cities under 50,000 across Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, and Ohio. Whether they’re villages in the middle of highways, cities off the beaten path, or rural townships, our company will find ways to provide them with high-speed, reliable internet connections.\n\nMercury Broadband built its customer service team on the principle of giving our small town and rural American customers the best technical support for their broadband internet connections.\n\nWe have agents on the line from Monday to Sunday, sunrise until evening, ready to receive your inquiries. Alternatively, our email is always monitored for immediate technical problems and questions about our services. Customers will also receive real-time updates for urgent repair needs\n\nOur technicians also promise a complete end-to-end service experience. If you have any questions, building restrictions, or other issues that may affect installation or your connectivity, they are ready to make the necessary accommodations. They will acknowledge your emails, calls, or texts, and will send you updates if required.\n\nNeed additional help? Check out our Technical Support page."
