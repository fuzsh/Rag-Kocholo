        "text": "Rent a bike in Copenhagen\n\nYou’re in one of the best cycling cities in the world, so renting a bike to explore Copenhagen is really a no-brainer. It will give you the freedom you need to discover the Danish capital in a fun, authentic way. TIP FOR TOURISTS – with our day deal pricing you can rent a bike for a day or a full week at a time.\n\nTake advantage of +450 km of bike lanes\n\nTake your time to explore every neighbourhood in the city, as you’ll discover that each of them has its unique identity and vibe. The good news is that you can start your Copenhagen bike tour pretty much anywhere, because, unlike traditional Copenhagen bike rental shops, we have rental bikes spread around the city in various pickup locations. Find a bike near you in the Donkey Republic app and start your adventure on two wheels!\n\nHow to explore Copenhagen on a bike\n\nBefore you saddle up your rental bike, check out our recommendations on exploring Copenhagen on a bike, as well as the most important Danish cycling rules you should respect to keep yourself safe and sound during your bike rental in Copenhagen.\n\nExplore Copenhagen’s sustainability\n\nThere is a lot more to sustainability than renting a bike in Copenhagen. Discover and experience a capital that plans to be carbon neutral by 2025. This ambitious plan includes a lot of initiatives concerning transportation, energy supply, adjusting to climate changes and green architecture. If you are interested in touring the most unique spots of Copenhagen on your rental bike, join one of the Green Bike Tours.\n\nDo you live in Copenhagen? And are you looking for a sustainable way to commute? Explore our membership here\n\nCopenhagen’s city centre, a.k.a. Indre By is easy to mark out on a map because it’s surrounded by water – be that canals, the lakes or the sea, all beautiful to ride your rental bike along.\n\nNaturally, you’ll want to include popular attractions on your bike route, such as Nyhavn, the Little Mermaid (Tiny Mermaid would be more accurate, though) or Rosenborg Castle. But there are also lots of parks and green areas (Kongens Have, Ørstedsparken and Kastellet come to mind), as well as countless mazy streets with cosy cafés, tiny design shops or lavish department stores to get lost in. Worth mentioning are Paludan Café for a relaxing break and a bite, and the Hay store for the coolest Danish design shopping session.\n\nThis hood is poetic chaos. It’s vibrant, colourful and multicultural, with virtually no wall left untouched by urban art and social discourse. If you fancy a street art treasure hunt, you’ll want to read about our street art bike tour first. Rent a bike in Nørrebro and take your time to explore the area. Don’t miss The Red Square (Den Røde Plads), where the Green Path bike-only route passes. If you keep riding on Nørrebrogade, you’ll reach the lakes and the beautiful Dronning Louises Bro – a popular hangout for locals and travellers alike. Another must is riding through Assistens Cemetery – trust us, it’s not your regular graveyard.\n\nFrederiksberg is Nørrebro’s neighbour, as well as its antonym, which is why it’s particularly nice to cycle between them back to back to feel how the air changes from one area to the other. Frederiksberg is so neat and peaceful, with beautiful façades and fancy cafés (including delicious cheesecake), flower shops and lots of baby strollers. There are some particularly nice streets you can ride your Donkey bike by, such as Falkoner Alle, Gammel Kongevej (when it’s not peak hour) or Frederiksberg Alle. Also, you have one of the biggest green areas in Copenhagen nearby, made up of Frederiksberg Have, Søndermarken (check out the Cisternerne art gallery here!) and Solbjerg Kirkegård – with the Frederiksberg Palace right in the middle of all that.\n\nChristianshavn is technically part of Indre By – so lots of canals to ride along here as well. However, this neighbourhood has its very own charm to be explored by bicycle with a fresh breeze in your hair.\n\nYou’ll find the famous Freetown Christiania here, with so many bohemian spots in and around it to discover. It’s actually a good idea to save some time for a dedicated Christiania bike tour, and see if you can discover this hidden beach – it’s really a special spot you won’t regret searching high and low for. If you happen to get hungry while you’re in Christianshavn, make sure you stop by Papirøen, or Copenhagen Street Food. Other attractions and cool sights in the area are: the Church of Our Saviour, the Royal Danish Opera House, the very new and cool Copenhagen Contemporary art centre.\n\nThe district of Østerbro is located north of Copenhagen’s city centre. On the map, it starts where The Lakes (Søerne) end and extends all the way to Hellerup in the suburbs. Østerbro is currently very attractive as a residential area, so you could spend an entire day just cycling across its streets, staring at the posh façades, peaking into green backyard oases or going full gourmet in some fashionable delicatessen. Alternatively, you can take your rental bike through Østerbro’s natural riches – on a ride in Fælledparken or to the beach, at Svanemøllen. Here are a few places worth stopping by fancy Original Coffee at Trianglen, low-key Café Bopa, high-brow Den Frie Centre of Contemporary Art, and hippie Candy Factory.\n\nThis is an all-time darling of Copenhagen’s neighbourhoods. There are lots of spots to explore on your rental bike in Vesterbro. There’s the very popular Meatpacking district, a.k.a. Kødbyen, which has evolved from trading livestock to trading beers for cigarettes in some hip bar’s entrance cue. There is also the Carlsberg Brewery to visit, which feels like going to the museum, but with lots of alcohol. And then there are quirky flea markets on Sønder Boulevard, unconventional art galleries and Instagram-heaven bistros (Mikkeller Bar, WarPigs and Bakken, to name a few), as well as beautiful murals you can suddenly discover on side streets as you cycle around.\n\nWhat’s on the other side of the bridge? Amager, once known as “boring island” is an island south of downtown Copenhagen, whose reputation is slowly starting to change. Until the 2000s, the district was not connected to the metro network, and to the city center was only reachable by car or by renting a bike on Amager – which in reality is only 10 minutes ride! Between the largest street food court in Northern Europe (Reffen), the beautiful beach of Amager strand where you can practice water sports, the ocean museum Den Blå Planet or the nature reserve that hosts hundreds of bird species, Amager is the perfect playground for lovers of cycling and authentic experiences.\n\nNordvest is surely a neighborhood you’ve never heard of… until you step foot in it! Fashionistas should definitely stop by the YouHeShe boutique and browse through its collection of clothing and accessories. Another local favorite is the Bispebjerg Cemetery. This huge park is great for biking, running and relaxing. In the spring, when the Japanese cherry trees bloom, they become a top destination for Instagrammers. Stop by Sirius café, TribecaNV New York restaurant or the excellent Zorro Pizza to get a taste of life in Nordvest."
