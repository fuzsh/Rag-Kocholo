It is a hybrid urban-suburban rail serving most of the Copenhagen urban area, and is analogous to the S-Bahn systems of Berlin, Vienna and Hamburg. The trains connect the Copenhagen inner city with Hillerød, Klampenborg, Frederikssund, Farum, Høje-Taastrup and Køge. There are 170 km (110 mi) of double track with 87 S-train stations, of which eight are in neighbouring towns outside greater Copenhagen.",

        "text": "The Copenhagen S-train (Danish: S-tog), the S-train of Copenhagen, Denmark, is a key part of public transport in the city. It is a hybrid urban-suburban rail serving most of the Copenhagen urban area, and is analogous to the S-Bahn systems of Berlin, Vienna and Hamburg. The trains connect the Copenhagen inner city with Hillerød, Klampenborg, Frederikssund, Farum, Høje-Taastrup and Køge. There are 170 km (110 mi) of double track[2] with 87 S-train stations, of which eight are in neighbouring towns outside greater Copenhagen.\n\nThe S-train is run by DSB S-tog A/S while Banedanmark owns the tracks and signals. Rail services are operated by \"Fourth Generation\" S-trains divided into 104 8-car train sets (Class SA) and 31 4-car train sets (Class SE).\n\nThe system operates in tandem with the separately owned Copenhagen Metro which operates in the city centre, Frederiksberg and Amager. The two systems carry 500,000 passengers daily with S-tog serving more than 357,000 passengers a day."
