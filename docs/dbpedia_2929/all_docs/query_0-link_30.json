        "text": "Abstract. This paper presents a simulation model to study the robustness of timetables of DSB S-tog a/s, the city rail of Copenhagen. Dealing with rush hour scenarios only, the simulation model investigates the effects of disturbances on the S-tog network. Several timetables are analyzed with respect to robustness. Some of these are used in operation and some are generated for the purpose of investigating timetables with specific alternative characteristics.\n\nGenerating timetables for train movements such that the total travel time of trains are minimized is studied more that 35 years in the literature. Up to now, many different methods same as exact, numeration, heuristics, simulation and knowledge-based ones have been presented. It can be easily observed that generally occurring disruptions in train movements are experienced in practice which results in non valid timetables. In these situations a real-time scheduling can be used which in fact is accompanied with some other difficulties. Based on the above fact finding timetables which have the ability of absorbing a pre-defined range of interruptions are highly invaluable. In this paper after a brief review about the robust timetables, two new methods are proposed to measure the robustness of train schedules. Finally an interesting example is presented to validate the introduced indices.\n\nThe robustness of the timetable is a sensitive issue in the daily realization of railway operations. As shown in the paper, robustness is a function of time reserves that helps to prevent unscheduled stops resulting from traffic disruptions and causing a higher energy consumption. The correct handling of time reserves while scheduling is a multidimensional issue, and it has a significant influence on the energy consumption of railway traffic. Therefore, the paper aims to show a simulation-based method, taking into account failure occurring probabilities and their consequences to get an acceptable level of robustness, that can be quantified by the probability of no delay propagation. This paper presents a method for the addition of time margins to the railway timetable. The iterative time buffer adding method is based on operational data as a knowledge source, to achieve the punctuality target. It was verified on a real railway line. An analysis of energy consumption for unscheduled ...\n\nIn recent years, rapid rail transit systems have played a unique role in transportation systems due to the demand increase in accommodating passengers. This study proposes a simulationâ€“optimization method to improve the resiliency of the train timetable in rapid transit rail lines under uncertainty associated with the passenger flow and train running times. The aim is to evaluate the resiliency of the train timetable through a discrete-event simulation (DES) model and to provide an optimized schedule with the maximum degree of resiliency against random disruptions caused by passenger flow fluctuations. The problem is first formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. The validity of the DES model is justified using convergence test analysis of the response variable, i.e., average passenger wait time, during the simulation run. Due to the complexity of the problem, a variable neighborhood search (VNS) and a genetic algorithm (GA) are proposed to solve large instances of..."
