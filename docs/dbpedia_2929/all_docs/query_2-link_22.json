        "text": "Discovering Copenhagen with children is fun and exciting. Copenhagen is a child friendly city and there are lots of fun and interesting things you can do in the city as a family. I am the proud mother of a 3 ½ year and a 9 month old and a heap of nieces and nephews, so I am a self-proclaimed expert in child activities in the city.\n\nWhat to do in Copenhagen with children\n\nCopenhagen Parks:\n\nCopenhagen is a green capital and we are blessed with many parks where us Copenhageners go to relax, chill and play. The main ones in the city centre is Kongens Have, Østre Anlæg (my favourite, as there is a good playground, beautiful lake and lots of nature), H.C. Ørsted Parken and of course a bit further out Fælledparken.\n\nCopenhagen Playgrounds:\n\nHere we go. This is my forte (in all humility), so hang tight folks; here are a few of my favourite playgrounds. My number one favourite playground is the one at Christianshavn as it is placed on the old fortification and it is a big playground for all ages (OK if you are from the US where everything is bigger than here in Denmark, you might find it tiny, but in our little world, it is big) . It has water and toilet facilities and you can find it via this link.\n\nAnother playground that I quite like and one that is close to all the hotels near the Central Station is Skydebanen and you can find the location here. This playground is at Vesterbro so if you are staying at a hotel in this area, then this is a good choice and it has different climbing facilities and slides. Fun for all ages.\n\nA little outside the city centre is Fælledparken and here we have the Tårnlegeplads ”Tower playground” and unsurprisingly it is full of towers :-). There are several playgrounds at Fælledparken but this one is my favourite. You can find it here.\n\nMuseum for Children:\n\nMuseums with children we all know can be a challenge, but a few here in Copenhagen have special children areas are excellent. The National Museum have a ”Børnemusem” (child museum) where children can go back in time and play as Vikings, knights and even go into an old style class room. At the Statens Museum for Kunst (National Gallery), there is also a child area where it is possible to make art yourself. Lots of fun and in an incredible building with an incredible view. If you have the chance then go – both for your children and your own sake. And as a minor addition: Statens Museum for Kunst has the best public toilets in Copenhagen.\n\nExperimentarium City is one big science playground right in the centre of Copenhagen and a hit with the older children. Its indoor, so it is particularly suited for a rainy day, but even if you are in Copenhagen with children on only sunny days, then this is still worth a visit. Equally important it is super fun for adults as well, so definitely put this on the itinerary.\n\nTivoli:\n\nNo visit with children to Copenhagen without a visit to Tivoli, which is an amusement park smack in the centre in the city. My best recommendation when going with children is to get the ”turpas” which is the armband that gives you access to all the rides. It is possible to pay per ride, but it is ridiculously expensive, so it is better to buy the almost as ridiculously expensive TurPas and then just let your children go crazy in Tivoli. Tivoli is nice during daytime, but at night it is even nicer as the lighting of the old park makes it magical. Every Friday during summer there is a free concert on, so here is also a chance to listen to some of the local Danish music stars.\n\nOutdoor swimming:\n\nIf you are looking for a refreshing dip for your family, there you are in the right city. Copenhagen is dominated by a canals and there is opportunity to swim in the harbour. So if you want to go a little bit more adventurours than you can find a few outdoor swimming areas including harbour at Fisketorvet and Svanemøllen. We have an option for sand-lovers too at Amager Beach Park located around 5 km from the center of Copenhagen.\n\nAll best from Copenhagen and happy running,\n\nLena\n\nSOME OF OUR RUNS IN COPENHAGEN"
