        "text": "Whether it’s the peak of summer or the depths of Danish winter, you’ll always be able to find people swimming in Copenhagen.\n\nCold bathing, wild swimming, call it what you like, the tradition has a firm place in Danish culture. There are a number of private ‘bathing clubs’ throughout the city, which offer changing rooms and saunas in exchange for membership. But if you’re anything like me though, you just want to hop in the water, splash around a bit, tell everyone how cold it is and then jump out again.\n\nIn this short guide I’ve put together just a few of my favourite spots in and around Copenhagen for taking the plunge into the blue briny sea. It’s fair to say that Denmark is a country which is obssessed with the sea, and there are some great beaches further out of the city around Sjealland - but I’ve kept this list to the metropolitan city area for easy access.\n\nSo get your swimming costume on, get your shirt off and don’t forget you towel! Here’s the list of the best swimming places in Copenhagen.\n\nIt was built in 2005 entirely out of an African wood called Azobe. The 750-square-metre structure is circular in design and spirals inwards like a conch shell - or indeed a snail as the nickname suggests.\n\nIt’s pretty easy to get to from the city centre by metro and offers the swimmer a lovely approach through the sandy beach dunes of Amager Beach Park. You’ll find people here doing all kinds of things from kayaking, windsurfing and SUP - but I prefer to just sit and take it all in!\n\nSee the location of Kastrup Sea Bath here: https://goo.gl/maps/EoLmiRgtQKBxyBPE6\n\nWooden walkways and ladders allow easy access to the water and on a summer’s day you’ll see crowd of locals descend on Islands Brygge to soak up the sun and party.\n\nIf you want to swim under the watchful eye of lifeguards, hear to the Harbour Baths, which were designed by architect Bjarke Ingels in 2002, with the goal of creating a safe, clean swimming spot right in Copenhagen centre. Here, there are several pools of different depths, a picnic area and diving boards.\n\nCross the river to check out Kalvebod Bølge (Kalvebod Wave), a steel and wood construction which dips and waves its way out into the water, allowing further space for summer revellers to chill.\n\nIt’s a little more chilled than the busy hotspots in the centre, offering a 700 metre long sandy promenade with lifeguards, showers and food stalls spread along the beach.\n\nJust in case that’s not enough, the lifeguard huts and changing room areas was designed by the famous Danish architect Arne Jacobsen, who also designed the nearby Bellevue Theatre which is well worth a look .\n\nWhile you are up in this neck of the woods, check out my guide to Klampenborg Deer Park and the Hermitage Hunting Lodge.\n\nThere you have it. Just a few of the best spots to go swimming in Copenhagen. Enjoy!\n\nCopenhagen is one of the few European capitals where the water is clean enough to swim in, and I feel extremely lucky to live here. Even as I write this, there are more baths and swimming places being built across the city and its surrounding areas, so I will certainly be keeping this guide updated as I go.\n\nPlease bear in mind, that only a few of the sites I mentioned have lifeguards (in the summer months), and the majority just have metal ladders to get in and out of the water.\n\nDid I miss any of your favourites off the list? Let me know!\n\nWant to explore more of what Scandi Culture has to offer? Check out my Guide to Klampenborg deer park."
