        "text": "About the area\n\nIf you prefer to live in the city, but still want to be close to green areas, Copenhagen Ø, also called Østerbro, is the place for you.\n\nØsterbro is very popular for families with children, and you will find many good schools, institutions, sports facilities, events etc.\n\nOn Østerbro you will also find Fælledparken, Copenhagen's largest park, which is perfect for running, football, dogwalks, playgrounds and relaxation in the summer. In addition, Denmarks biggest hospital is located just in the middle of Østerbro.\n\nThere is also plenty of shopping opportunities in the area, including Østerbrogade and Nrd. Frihavnsgade, which offers many specialty stores, as well as several of the well-known chain stores. In addition, there is a rich selection of cafees and restaurants. There is generally a really relaxed atmosphere on Østerbro, and it is in the finer end of Copenhagen.\n\nØsterbro is located close to the new beach at Svanemøllen, as well as the beach areas Charlottenlund Strandpark and Bellevue, which are located a short distance up Strandvejen. You are relatively close to the water and harbour areas.\n\nFrom Østerbro, it is easy to reach Copenhagen City by car and by public transport. It is very easy to get out of town and on the highway, after the new drive through at Svanemøllen has been built. There are also plenty of S-trains to many cities. You can also just hop on the bike, and get into the city easily.\n\nThe one part of Østerbro is located at the end of the popular lakes which are perfect for a run or walk, and the area is stunning.\n\nWelcome to Copenhagen Ø."
