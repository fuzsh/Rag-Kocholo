Copenhagen is situated on the east coast of Denmark’s largest island, Zealand. Copenhagen has been the capital of Denmark for nearly 600 years and is also the largest city in Scandinavia.\n\nBicycles spin alongside automobile traffic, and in the early morning in the pedestrian streets of the city the air is filled with the aroma of freshly baked bread and newly scrubbed storefronts. A prominent point of orientation in the city is the main rail station, Central Station, which is bordered on the west by the primary hotel district and to the northeast by the ever popular Tivoli Gardens. Just north of Tivoli is Rådhuspladsen, the central city square and the main terminus for the local bus network. To the east is the city’s waterfront, including the canal district of Christianshavn.\n\nThe flat terrain of the city center of Copenhagen invites walking or bicycling. The tangles of cobbled one-way streets are interesting in themselves! Between April and September, the city provides over 2000 bicycles which can be borrowed from one of the over 150 racks located at strategic points. A coin deposit unlocks the rack. The coin is refunded when the cycle is returned.\n\nCopenhagen is not divided into single-purpose districts, so people work, play, shop, and live throughout the central core of this multi layered, densely populated capital. Most sights lie within this one square-mile center. Copenhagen, has the longest pedestrian mall on earth. The mall, Strøget, (pronounced ‘stroll’ and meaning ‘stripe’) was completed in 1962 and serves as a model for pedestrian malls all over the world. It is an amalgamation of five streets: Frederiksberggade, Nygade, Vimmelskaftet, Amagertorv and Ostergade. It runs through the center of the city between Rådhuspladsen and Kongens Nytorv, the square at the head of the Nyhavn canal. The mall is filled with fascinating reminders of Denmark’s past as well as department stores, shops, restaurants, theaters and museums.\n\nThe most affordable way to see Copenhagen is with a Copenhagen card. Choose one for a 24, 48 or 72 hour period and enjoy free travel by public transportation and free entry into more than 60 museums and attractions in the greater Copenhagen area, as well as discounts on many others.\n\nFor sightseeing beyond the city there is an excellent and efficient public transportation system. Trains and buses operate from 5 am to midnight. After that, night buses run every half hour from the main bus station at Rådhus Pladsen to most areas of the city and surroundings.\n\nThere are many green spaces within and around the city center, with large parks and gardens in which to relax and enjoy the day. Be sure to try a cruise through the canals of Christianshavn, and give a nod in the direction of the Little Mermaid. Architecturally, Copenhagen has more than its share of interesting sights, from the administrative palace of Christianborg Slot on the island of Slotsholmen to the fascinating steeple of the Gothic style Vor Frelsers Kirke.\n\nDenmark and its capital, Copenhagen, have one of the highest standards of living in the world. Copenhagen is a family friendly city of excellence. It is a city with museums, cultural attractions, a lively nightlife, cafés, restaurants, and entertainment of the highest caliber. It is among the finest of European capitals\n\nB – City information\n\nArea:\n\n35 sq mi\n\nPopulation:\n\n1,650,000\n\nCountry:\n\nDenmark\n\nLanguage:\n\nDanish is a difficult language for visitors, (except for those from Norway and Sweden), to understand, and to speak. Danes are excellent linguists, however, and almost everyone, except perhaps elderly people in rural areas, speaks English well.\n\nTime Zone:\n\nDenmark operates on Central European Time–1 hour ahead of Greenwich Mean Time and 6 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time (+2 in summer) This translates to Copenhagen being 6 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time. . When it is noon in Copenhagen; it is 6am in New York City. Daylight Savings Time is observed from the end of March to the end of September.\n\nTelephone area code:\n\nnone; the country code is 45. This two-digit number should precede any call made to Denmark from another country. Danish phones are fully automatic. Dial the eight-digit number; there are no city area codes. At public telephone booths, use two 50-øre coins or a 1-krone or 5-krone coin only. Don’t insert any coins until your party answers. You can make more than one call on the same payment if your time hasn’t run out. Remember that it can be expensive to telephone from your hotel room. Emergency calls are free.\n\nAverage Temperatures (In Fahrenheit):\n\nHigh Low January – March 41F 28F April – June 66F 36F July – September 68F 50F October – December 52F 32F\n\nWhen to Go:\n\nMost travelers visit Denmark during the warmest months, July and August, but there are advantages to going in May, June, or September, when the city is less crowded and many establishments offer off-season discounts. However, few places in Denmark are ever unpleasantly crowded, and when the Danes make their annual exodus to the beaches the cities have even more breathing space. Many visitors avoid the winter months, when days are short and dark and when important attractions, including Copenhagen’s Tivoli Gardens, are closed for most of the season. It’s worth noting, however, that winter holidays are beautiful and Tivoli does re-open for a time with its special Christmas market.\n\nPacking:\n\nIt is wise to pack a folding umbrella and a lightweight raincoat, as unexpected showers are the norm year round. Pack casual clothes. Comfortable walking shoes are essential. If you have trouble sleeping when it is light or are sensitive to strong sun, bring an eye mask for sleeping and dark sunglasses for outdoors. Summer provides extra hours of light, extending into nighttime hours.\n\nPassports & Visas:\n\nAll U.S. citizens, even infants, need only a valid passport to enter any Scandinavian country for stays of up to three months.\n\nNational Holidays:\n\nNew Year’s Day Jan. 1\n\nMarch or April (varies) Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter Monday\n\nApril 25 Common Prayer (Great Prayer Day)\n\nMay (date varies) Feast of the Ascension\n\nMay (date varies) Pentecost Monday\n\nJune 5 Constitution Day (shops close at noon)\n\nChristmas Eve, Christmas Day, and St. Stephen’s Day Dec. 24, 25, 26.\n\nCurrency:\n\nDenmark is part of the European Union, but the unit of exchange is still the krone (DKK)\n\nChanging Money:\n\nAlmost all banks (including the Danske Bank at the airport) exchange money. After normal banking hours, Den Danske Bank exchange is open at the main railway station, daily June to August 7 am-10 pm, and daily September to May, 7 am-9 pm.\n\nCybercafés:\n\nInternet access is provided in hotels and at many cybercafés in the area:\n\nCustoms:\n\nUpon leaving Denmark, U.S. citizens who have been outside their home country for 48 hours or more are allowed to take home $400 worth of merchandise duty free, if they have claimed no similar exemption within the past 30 days. If you make purchases in Denmark, keep your receipts.\n\nTaxes:\n\nAll hotel, restaurant, and departure taxes and VAT. In Denmark these taxes are known as MOMS (pronounced mumps). These are automatically included in prices. VAT is 25%; non-EU citizens can obtain a refund of roughly 20%. The more than 1,500 shops that participate in the tax-free plan have a white tax free sticker on their windows. Purchases must be at least DKr300 in purchases per store, but need not necessarily be purchased all at the same time. Items must be sealed and unused in Denmark. At the shop, you’ll be asked to fill out a form and to show your passport. The form can then be turned in at any airport or ferry customs desk, where you can choose a check or charge-card credit. Keep all your receipts and tags; occasionally, customs authorities do ask to see purchases, so pack them where they will be accessible.\n\nA 25% MOMS is included in your hotel and restaurant bills, service charges, and entrance fees, as well as on repair of foreign-registered cars. No refunds are possible on these items.\n\nDentists:\n\nDuring regular business hours, ask your hotel to call the nearest English-speaking dentist. For emergency dental treatment, go to Tandlægevagten, Oslo Plads 14 ( 35-38-02-51), near Østerport Station and the U.S. Embassy. It’ is open Monday to Friday from 8am -9:30pm and on Saturday, Sunday, and holidays from l0am – noon. Be prepared to pay in cash.\n\nDoctors:\n\nTo reach a doctor, dial 33-93-63-00 from 9am – 4pm, or 38-88-60-41 after hours. The doctor’s fee is payable in cash. Virtually every doctor speaks English.\n\nDrug Laws:\n\nThere are severe penalties in Denmark for the possession, use, purchase, sale, or manufacturing of drugs.\n\nElectricity:\n\nTo use your U.S.-purchased electric-powered equipment, bring a converter and an adapter. The electrical current in Scandinavia is 220 volts, 50 cycles alternating current (AC); wall outlets take Continental-type plugs, with two round prongs.\n\nEmbassies:\n\nAll embassies are in Copenhagen. The embassy of the United States is located at Dag Hammarsjölds Allé 24, DK-2100 København ( 35-55-31-44\n\nEmergencies:\n\nDial 112 to report a fire or to call the police or an ambulance.

Mineral water is readily available.\n\nArriving & Departing:\n\nBy Plane\n\nCopenhagen (formerly Kastrup) Airport (32-54-17-01), is 7 1/4 miles from the center of Copenhagen. Air-rail trains link the airport with the Central Railway Station in the center of Copenhagen. The ride takes only 11 minutes, and is reasonably priced. Located underneath the airport’s arrivals and departure halls, the Air Rail Terminal is a short escalator ride from the gates. It is equipped with more than 30 check-in counters, ticketing offices, information desks, restaurants, and fast-food chains. You can also take an SAS bus to the city terminal. Even cheaper is a local bus, no. 250S, which leaves from the international arrivals terminal every 15 or 20 minutes for Town Hall Square in central Copenhagen. Taxis are also available.\n\nFrom New York, flights to Copenhagen take 7 hours, 40 minutes.\n\nFrom London to Copenhagen the flight takes 1 hour, 55 minutes.\n\nBy Car\n\nThe E-66 highway, via bridges and ferry routes, connects Fredericia (on Jylland) with Middelfart (on Fyn), a distance of 10 miles and farther on to Copenhagen, another 120 miles east. Farther north, from århus (in Jylland), there is direct ferry service to Kalundborg (on Sjælland). From there, Route 23 leads to Roskilde, about 45 miles east. Take Route 21 east and follow the signs to Copenhagen, another 25 miles. Make reservations for the ferry in advance through DSB (tel. 33/14-88-80).\n\nBy Ferry\n\nFrom Sweden there are frequent ferry connections to Copenhagen, including several daily ships from Malmö, Limhamn, Landskrona, and Helsingborg. There is also a high-speed craft from Malmö.\n\nBy Train\n\nHovedbanegården (central station) is the hub of the DSB network and is connected to most major cities in Europe. Intercity trains leave every hour, usually on the hour, from 6am to 10 pm for principal towns in Fyn and Jylland. Find out more from DSB Information (tel. 33/14-17-01). You can make reservations at the central station and at most other stations.\n\nGetting Around:\n\nCopenhagen is small, with most sights within its square-mile center. Wear comfortable shoes and explore it on foot. Or rent a bike. An efficient mass transit system is available.\n\nBy Bicycle\n\nBicycles are well suited to Copenhagen’s flat terrain and are popular among Danes as well as visitors.\n\nContact:\n\nKøbenhavns Cyclebørs (Track 12, Copenhagen main train station, tel. 33/14-07-17),\n\nDanwheel-Rent-a-Bike (Colbjørnsensgade 3, tel. 31/21-22-27), or\n\nUrania Cykler (Gammel Kongevej 1, tel. 31/21-80-88).\n\nBy Car\n\nA car is not the best means of transportation for enjoying the sights of central Copenhagen. Parking spaces are at a premium and, when available, are expensive. A maze of one-way streets, somewhat aggressive drivers, and bicycle lanes make it even more complicated. If you are going to drive, choose a small car that’s easy to parallel park, bring a lot of small change to feed the meters, and be very careful of the cyclists on your right-hand side: They always have the right-of-way.\n\nMass Transit\n\nThe Copenhagen Card offers unlimited travel on buses and suburban trains, admission to more than 40 museums and sights around Sjælland, and a reduction on the ferry crossing to Sweden. You can buy a card, valid for either 24 or 48 hours, at tourist offices and hotels.\n\nTrains and buses operate from 5 am (Sunday 6 am) to midnight. After that, night buses run every half hour from 1 am to 4:30 am from the main bus station at Rådhus Pladsen to most areas of the city and surroundings. Trains and buses operate on the same ticket system and divide Copenhagen and surrounding areas into three zones. Tickets are validated on a time basis: On the basic ticket, you can travel anywhere in the zone in which you started. A discount klip kort, good for 10 rides, costs DKr75 and must be stamped in the automatic ticket machines on buses or at stations. Get zone details from the 24-hour information service (tel. 36/45-45-45 for buses, 33/14-17-01 for S trains).\n\nBy Taxi\n\nThe computer-metered Mercedes and Volvo cabs are available when they display the sign fri (free); Taxis can be hailed or picked up in front of the main train station or at taxi stands, or by calling 31/35-35-35.\n\nA joint zone fare system includes Copenhagen Transport buses and State Railway and S-tog trains in Copenhagen and North Zealand, plus some private railway routes within a 25-mile radius of the capital, enabling you to transfer from train to bus and vice versa with the same ticket. Basic Fares–A grundbillet (basic ticket) works for both buses and You can buy 10 tickets for a reduced rate. Children 11 and under ride for half fare; those 4 and under go free on local trains; and those 6 and under go free on buses. You can alsopurchase a ticket allowing 24-hour bus and train travel through nearly half of Zealand; it’s half price for children 7 to 11, and free for children 6 and under.\n\nDiscount Passes\n\nThe Copenhagen Card entitles you to free and unlimited travel by bus and rail throughout the metropolitan area (including North Zealand), 25% to 50% discounts on crossings to and from Sweden, and free admission to many sights and museums. The card is available for 1, 2, or 3 days. Children 11 and under are given a 50% discount. For more information, contact the Copenhagen Tourist Information Center.\n\nEurail passes (which must be purchased in the U.S.) and Nordturist Pass tickets (which can be purchased at any train station in Scandinavia) can be used on local trains in Copenhagen.\n\nStudents who have an International Student Identity Card (ISIC) are entitled to a number of travel breaks in Copenhagen. A card can be purchased in the United States at any Council Travel office (for the office nearest you, call 1- 800/GET-AN-ID).\n\nFor information about low-cost train, ferry, and plane trips, go to Wasteels, Skoubogade 6 ( 33-14-46-33), in Copenhagen. Monday to Friday from 9am to 7pm and Saturday 10am to 3pm.\n\nNeighborhoods:\n\nTivoli Gardens\n\nThese amusement gardens were built on the site of former fortifications in the heart of Copenhagen, on the south side of Rådhuspladsen. Some 160,000 flowers and 110,000 electric lights set the scene. Built in 1843, Tivoli is made up of a collection of restaurants, dance halls, theaters, beer gardens, and lakes.\n\nStrøget\n\nThis pedestrians-only street begins at Rådhuspladsen. The most interesting parts are Gammeltorv and Nytorv, old and new squares, lying on either side of Strxget. They’re the sites of fruit and vegetable markets, as well as stalls selling bric-a-brac and handmade jewelry. The word Strxget doesn’t appear on any maps. Instead, Strøget encompasses five streets: Frederiksbrerggade, Nygade, Villelskaftet, Amagertorv, and Øtergade.\n\nNyhavn\n\nThis is the harbor area, now one of the most elegant sections of the city. It is the site of the deluxe hotel d’Angleterre and many prestigious restaurants. The Royal Theater stands on Kongens Nytorv.\n\nIndre By\n\nThis is the name given to the Old Town, the heart of Copenhagen. Once filled with monasteries, it is a maze of old streets, alleyways, and squares. If you cross Gammeltorv and Nørregade, you’ll be in the university area, nicknamed the Latin Quarter, as in Paris. The Vor Frue Kirke (cathedral of Copenhagen) is found here, as is the Rundetern (Round Tower).\n\nSlotsholmen\n\nThis island, site of Christiansborg Palace, was where Bishop Absalon built the first fortress in the city in 1167. Today it’s the seat of the Danish parliament and the site of Thorvaldsen’s Museum, among others. Slotsholmen is linked to Indre by bridges. You can also visit the Royal Library, the Theater Museum, and the Royal Stables. The 17th-century Børsen (stock exchange) is also here.\n\nChristinashavn\n\nThis was the new town ordered by master builder Christian IV in the early 1500s. The town was originally constructed to house workers in the shipbuilding industry. Visitors come here today mainly to see the Danish Film Museum on Store Søndervoldstræde, and Vors Frelsers Kirke, on the corner of Prinsessegade and Skt. Annfgade. Sightseers can climb the spire of this old church for a panoramic view.\n\nChristiania\n\nAn anarchists’ commune founded in 1971, when students occupied army barracks; it is now a peaceful community of nonconformists who run a number of businesses, including a bike shop, bakery, rock club, and communal bathhouse.\n\nVesterbro\n\nThe main street of this district, Istedgade, runs west from the main rail depot in the center of town. It passes through various neighborhoods. At first, the blocks are lined with rather respectable hotels but they soon give way to Copenhagen’s red-light district.. In the 1990s, many immigrants to Copenhagen, especially those from Turkey and Pakistan, settled in the neighborhood, filling it with indigenous craft shops and ethnic restaurants.\n\nNørrebro\n\nAdjacent to Vesterbro , Nørrebro is also rich in artisan shops and ethnic restaurants, especially Turkish and Pakistani. This area has been a blue collar neighborhood since the middle of the 19th century. However, the original Danish settlers have long since departed, replaced by immigrants who are not always greeted with a friendly reception in Copenhagen. The area also abounds in artists, students, and musicians. There are many second-hand clothing stores in this area, especially around Sankt Hans Torv. Antique shops offering an often unidentified mix of authentic antiquities and reproductions also fill the area.. On Saturday mornings a popular flea market opens along the wall of Assistens Kirkegerd, to the west of Nxrrebrogade.\n\nFrederiksberg\n\nIf you head west from the inner city along Vesterbrogade, you will reach the residential and business district of Frederiksberg. It grew up around Frederiksberg Palace, constructed in the Italianate style with an ocher façade. A park, Frederiksberg Have, surrounds the palace. To the west of the palace is the Zoologisk Have, one of the largest zoos in Europe.\n\nDragør\n\nDragør is a fishing village south of the city that dates from the 16th century. Along with Tivoli, this seems to be everybody’s favorite spot. Walk its cobblestone streets and enjoy its 65 old red-roofed houses, which have been designated as national landmarks.\n\nØresund Region\n\nOn July 1, 2000 Denmark and Sweden finally put centuries of rivalry, war and national differences behind them with the opening of the Øresund Fixed Link. The project consists of a 10 mile long bridge, tunnel and man made island connecting Copenhagen and Malmö, on the south coast of Sweden. The emerging Øresund Region can be viewed as a pilot project for the accelerating European integration process. The new Øresund Bridge between Denmark and Sweden is set to generate further growth on both sides of the Øresund Straits. There has been discussion of a separate town, Ørestad, to be established in the area, but much more work remains before matters of governance, cost and responsibility for services, and taxation can be determined. However, the project will become a reality step by step, and will evolve as the third largest city development project in Europe\n\nC – Attractions & Things To Do\n\nCarlsberg Brewery Visit\n\n100, Vesterfælledvej\n\n45 33 27 13 14\n\nBus 6 from Rådhuspladsen\n\nFree 90 minute tours are offered Mon-Fri at 11am and 2pm.\n\nVisitors are escorted through the brew houses and along the production line. Each tour ends with guests sampling the products. The factory produces 3 million bottles of beer a day.\n\nThe Little Mermaid\n\nLangelinie on the harbor\n\nBus 1,6, or 9.\n\nA life-size statue inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s story, The Little Mermaid, one of the world’s most famous fairy tales. The statue was sculpted by Edward Eriksen and rests on rocks just off the shore. In 1964 and in 1998, the mermaid’s head was stolen. The original mold still exists, and it is possible to recast the bronze and restore missing body parts. In the latest assault, this was not necessary. The missing head turned up at a local TV station, delivered by a masked figure. The mermaid is without question one of the most photographed women in Copenhagen.\n\nArbejdemuseet (The Workers Museum)\n\nRømersgade 22\n\n33-93-25-75\n\nJuly 1-Nov 1 daily 10am-6pm. Off-season Tues-Sun 10am-6pm\n\nBus: 5, 7, 14, 16, 17, 24, 43, or 84\n\nAdmission charged.\n\nwww.arbejdermuseet.dk\n\nThis museum traces the working class of Denmark from their struggles beginning around 1850 up to the present day. It’s not just about the labor movement, however; it recreates various times and eras. For example, there is a reconstruction of a Danish street in the 1800s, complete with a tram. There’s also the re-creation of an apartment that was once inhabited by a worker in a brewery, along with his wife and eight children. The furnishings and artifacts are authentic. The museum is a tribute to the working class, depicting the struggle of laborers to make a living and provide for their families. The museum also has a 19th-century-style restaurant serving old-fashioned Danish specialties and a ’50s-style coffee shop.\n\nAmalienborg (Amalia’s Castle)\n\nAmalienborg Castle\n\n33/12-21-86\n\nDkr 40. Jan.-Apr. and Nov.-Dec., Tues.-Sun. 11-4; May-Oct., daily 10-4.\n\nThe four identical Rococo buildings occupying this square have housed the royals since 1784. The Christian VIII palace across from the queen’s residence houses the Amalienborg Museum, which displays the second division of the Royal Collection (the first is at Rosenborg Slot). In the square’s center is a magnificent equestrian statue of King Frederik V, which reputedly cost as much as all the buildings combined.\n\nChanging of the Guard (At Noon)\n\nAmalienborg\n\nhttp://www.kongehuset.dk/ (in Danish only)\n\nEvery day at noon, the Royal Guard and band march from Rosenborg Slot through the city for the changing of the guard. At noon on Queen Margrethe’s birthday, April 16, crowds of Danes gather to cheer their monarch, who stands and waves from her balcony.

From 1441 until the fire of 1795, it was used as the royal residence. Even though the first two castles on the site were burned, Christiansborg remains an impressive Baroque compound. The castle’s best known feature during the Middle Ages was the Blå Tårn (Blue Tower) which was used to house prisoners of note. One of the best known was Eleonore Christine, daughter of Christian IV, who was suspected of being part of her husband’s treason plot.\n\nThe present-day copper roofed structure with its neo-baroque granite and concrete façade, looks more like a town hall than a castle. Its central tower is the tallest in Denmark at 358 feet.\n\nChristiansborg\n\n33/92-64-91.\n\nFree, open to the public\n\nSun. 12-4.\n\nWhile the castle was being rebuilt at the turn of the century, the Nationalmuseet excavated the ruins beneath it.

It is one of the largest and oldest cast collections in the world, comprising arouund2,000 plaster-casts modeled after famous sculptures from the past 4,000 years of western culture. The best known original works from antiquity and the Renaissance are now scattered all over the museums of the world, but here they are represented by their casts.

Although the structure was converted into a church for the royal navy in 1619, its nave was originally built in 1562 when it was first used as an anchor smithy. By 1641 the ever-changing church became predominantly Dutch Renaissance in style, an architectural style that is maintained to this day. main doorway was brought here from Roskilde Cathedral in the 19th century.\n\nInside, is a baroque altar of unpainted oak and a carved pulpit by Abel Schrøder the Younger. Both of these artifacts date from the mid-17th century. In the burial chamber are the tombs of some of Denmark’s best known sea heroes.

It is, however, still lined with some of the city’s finest buildings. The square was built on the site of the former ramparts that ringed the city in an arc all the way from Rådhuspladsen.\n\nA mounted statue of Christian V dominates the square. Crafted in 1688 by the French sculptor Lamoureux, he is ludicrously depicted as a Roman emperor astride his horse.

Housed in a classic building with high-ceilinged reading rooms and columned hallways, it is a grand and impressive place. It holds some 2 million volumes, everything from sagas of Viking journeys to America ( before Columbus allegedly discovered the already inhabited continent), and enough prints, maps, and manuscripts to keep the most intense scholar busy for several lifetimes. The library owns original manuscripts by such beloved Danish writers as Hans Christian Andersen and Karen Blixen (more widely known as Isak Dinesen).\n\nThe library was closed while a vast black granite annex(known locally as “The Black Diamond”) was added to accommodate the output of Danish works since World War II. Today the library stretches all the way to the waterfront. As a national library, Kongelige Bibliotek owns the world’s most complete collection of works printed in Danish, some going as far back as 1482.

The Glyptotek, behind Tivoli, is one of the most important art museums in Scandinavia. Founded by the 19th-century art collector Carl Jacobsen, of the Carlsberg Brewery family, the museum comprises two distinct areas: modern and antiquities. The modern section has both French and Danish art, mainly from the 19th century. Sculpture, including works by Rodin, is on the ground floor, and works of the impressionists and related artists, including van Gogh’s Landscape from St. Rémy, are on the upper floors. Egyptian, Greek, and Roman art are on the main floor, and Etruscan, Greek, and Cypriot art are on the lower floor. A conservatory separates the two areas.\n\nThe Egyptian collection is outstanding. A favorite of many is a prehistoric rendering of a hippopotamus. Fine Greek originals (headless Apollo, Niobe’s tragic children) and Roman copies of original Greek bronzes (4th-century Hercules) are also displayed, as are some of the noblest Roman busts–Pompey, Virgil, Augustus, and Trajan. The Erruscan art display (sarcophagi, a winged lion, bronzes, and pottery)\n\nIn 1996 the Ny Glyptotek added a French Masters’ wing. This wing, constructed of white marble and granite, is situated in the inner courtyard, which can only be reached through the Conservatory. In a climate- and light-controlled environment, there is a collection of French masterpieces that includes works by Manet, Monet, Degas, and Renoir, as well as an impressive collection of French sculpture, such as Rodin’s The Burghers of Calais, and one of only three complete sets of Degas bronzes. The display features Cézanne’s famous Portrait of the Artist, as well as about 35 paintings by, Paul Gauguin who married a Danish woman in 1873.\n\nNyhavn (New Harbor)\n\nThis harbor-front neighborhood was built 300 years ago to attract traffic and commerce to the city center. Until 1970, the area was a favorite haunt of sailors. Now the bustling, colorful, Dutch-style canal is lined with cafés, bars and restaurants and old time sailing ships from the Nationalmuseet’s collection. Many of the old buildings have been well preserved and help to retain the harbor’s authentic 18th-century maritime atmosphere.. Hans Christian Andersen lived at various times in the Nyhavn houses at numbers 18, 20, and 67.\n\nOrlogsmuseet (Royal Naval Museum)\n\nOvergaden Oven Vandet 58\n\n32-54-63-63\n\nTues-Sun noon-4pm\n\nBus: 2, 8, 9, 28, 31, or 350S\n\nAdmission charged.\n\nThis museum in Sökvasthuset, the former naval hospital, opens onto Christianshavn Kanal. It traces the history of the Danish navy, and, in fact, of this whole maritime nation. More than 300 model ships, many based on designs that date from as early as the 1500s, are on display. Some of these model vessels were designed and constructed by naval engineers as prototypes for the construction of ships that were later launched into the North Sea. The models are wide ranging: some are fully dressed, with working sails, whereas others are cross-sectional with their frames outlined. Many naval artifacts are also displayed. There is a display of navigational instruments and the propeller from the German U-Boat that sank the Lusitania. Also displayed are naval uniforms worn by Danish officers and sailors over the decades.\n\nRådhus (City Hall)\n\nCompleted in 1905, the mock-Renaissance building dominates Rådhus Pladsen (City Hall Square), the hub of Copenhagen’s commercial district.\n\nRådhus Place\n\n33/66-25-82.\n\nTours\n\nWeekdays 9:30-4, Sat. 9:30-1.

The multidialed, superaccurate astronomical timepiece has a 570,000 year calendar and took inventor Jens Olsen Verdensur 27 years to complete before it was put into action in 1955.\n\nThe interior of the building is beautifully decorated. Higghlights include busts of HC Andersen, the physicist, Niels Bohr, Professor Nyrop, and sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. The library, banquet hall, the mosaic floors, chandeliers, reliefs, intricate brickwork and painted ceilings all merit attention.\n\nDiagonally across Rådhus Pladsen, on top of a corner office building are a neon thermometer and a gilded barometer. On sunny days there’s a golden sculpture of a girl on a bicycle; if it will rain, a girl with an umbrella appears.\n\nRådhuset is also a venue for exhibitions and concerts.\n\nRosenborg Slot (Rosenborg Castle)\n\nØster Voldg. 4A,\n\n33/15-32-86.\n\nAdmission charged.\n\nJan.-Apr. and Nov.-Dec., Tues.-Sun. 11-2;\n\nMay – Sept., daily 10-4; Oct., daily 11-3.\n\nwww.kulturnet.dk/homes/rosenb/\n\nThis Dutch Renaissance castle contains ballrooms, halls, and reception chambers, yet has a feeling of “home.” It was the favorite residence of King Christian IV. Denmark was going through a period of economic depression toward the end of his reign, so the King literally pulled up the drawbridge and escaped the harsh realities of the outside world.\n\nThousands of objects are displayed inside: toys, architectural tricks, inventions, art objects and jewelry, gathered from around the world. the castle basement was a source of pride to the King. In it, his personal orchestra would perform, their music rising through a complex system of pipes connected to his living quarters. The basement now contains the Treasury, the repository of the Crown Jewels.\n\nRosenborg was a royal residence up until 1838, when these collections were opened to the public, along with many rooms which had remained intact over several generations from the time of Christian IV (1588-1648) to Frederik IV (1699-1730). The 24 rooms currently on display offer an insight into the lives of Renaissance kings that is perhaps unparalleled in Europe. In recent years, electricity has been installed. This has dispelled some of the natural gloom that one associates with castles, but doe illuminate the treasures to advantage.\n\nThe castle’s setting is equally welcoming: it is in the middle of the Kongens Have (King’s Garden), amid lawns, park benches, and shady walking paths. In 1849, when the absolute monarchy was abolished, the royal castles became state property, except for Rosenborg, which is still passed down from monarch to monarch.\n\nRundetårn.

Built in 1642 under the direction of Christian !V for the astronomer Tycho Brahe, the red brick tower was originally intended as an observatory for the nearby university. It is still the oldest functioning observatory in Europe. The Round Tower is unique for its cobbled spiral walkway which winds 686 feet almost to the top of the tower, 114 feet above the city. There are only a few stairs at the very top. Halfway up is an exhibition space. Trinitatiskirke was built in 1637 and has a baroque altar by Friedrich Ehbisch as well as a three faced rococo clock. The observatory at the top of the tower is often open with an astronomer on hand to explain what is seen through the telescope.\n\nInstead of climbing the stout Round Tower’s stairs, visitors scale a smooth, 600-ft spiral ramp on From its top, you enjoy a panoramic view of the twisted streets and crooked roofs of Copenhagen.\n\nStatens Museum for Kunst (The National Gallery of Art)\n\nSølvgade 48-50\n\n33 74 84 94\n\n10-5 Tues., Thurs.-Sun. 10-8 Wed. closed Mon.\n\nFree to all Wed.\n\nAdmission charged other than Wed. for visitors 16 and older.\n\nwww.smk.dk\n\nFounded in 1824, the national Gallery had its origins in royal collections from centuries earlier. During the 19th century, the collection was based in Christiansborg Slot, until a fire necessitated moving it to the currently specially designed building designed by Vilhelm Dahlerup. The museum’s main focus is Danish art. This is well represented from the Golden Age of the early 19th century , back through the works of its 15th – 18th century forerunners. On the ground floor is the children’s art museum with hands-on displays.\n\nTeatermuseet\n\nChristiansborg Ridebane\n\n18 33-11-51-76\n\nWed 2-4, Sat-Sun noon-4pm\n\nBus: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 31, 37, or 43\n\nAdmission charged.\n\nTheater buffs flock to this museum in the Old Royal Court Theater, which dates from 1767. King Christian VII had it constructed as the first court theater in Copenhagen. At one time Hans Christian Andersen was once a ballet student here. In 1842 the theater was modernized and given its present look, but the curtain went down on it for the last time in 1881.\n\nIt opened as a museum in 1992. The museum traces the history of the Danish theater from the 18th century until modern times. The public has access to the theater boxes, the stage, and the old dressing rooms. Some of the great theatrical performances of Europe, from Italian opera to pantomime, reportedly took place on the stage here. Photographs, prints, theatrical costumes, and even old stage programs tell the story, beginning with Ludvig Holberg and going up to the present day.\n\nTivoli Gardens\n\nVesterbrogade 3\n\n33-15-10-01\n\nDaily 11am-midnight Seasonal Info: Closed mid-Sept to Apr\n\nBus: 1, 16, or 29\n\nAdmission charged. Rides extra.\n\nSince it opened in 1843, this 20 acre garden and amusement park in the center of Copenhagen has been a resounding success. It is, in fact, the jewel of Copenhagen’s family attractions, and Denmark’s biggest tourist draw. It features thousands of flowers, a merry-go-round of tiny Viking ships, games of chance and skill (pinball arcades, slot machines, shooting galleries), and a Ferris wheel of hot-air balloons and cabin seats. There’s even a playground for children.\n\nAn Arabian-style fantasy palace, with towers and arches, houses more than two dozen restaurants in all price ranges, from a lakeside inn to a beer garden. Take a walk around the edge of the tiny lake with its ducks, swans, and boats.\n\nA parade of the red-uniformed Tivoli Boys Guard takes place on weekends at 6:30 and 8:30pm, and their regimental band gives concerts on Saturday at 3pm on the open-air stage. The oldest building at Tivoli, the Chinese-style Pantomime Theater with its peacock curtain, stages pantomimes in the evening.\n\nCopenhagen’s best-known attraction, conveniently located next to its main train station, attracts an astounding number of visitors: 4 million people from May to September. Tivoli is more sophisticated than a mere funfair among its many attractions, are frequent classical, jazz, and rock concerts. Fantastic flower exhibits color the lush gardens and float on the swan-filled ponds. Try to see Tivoli at least once by night, when 100,000 colored lanterns illuminate the Chinese pagoda and the main fountain.\n\nThe park was established in the 1840s, when Danish architect George Carstensen persuaded King Christian VIII to let him build an amusement park, rationalizing that when people amuse themselves, they forget politics.\n\nTivoli Museum\n\nVesterbrogade 3\n\n33-15-10-01\n\nApr 24-Sept 13 daily 11am-6pm.

Models, films, 3D displays, pictures, posters, and original artifacts reveal how the Danes and their foreign visitors had harmless fun over the decades. Opening in 1993, the museum became an instant hit with Tivoli devotees. It’s a great idea to come here if you have only one chance to visit Copenhagen in a lifetime, and Tivoli has shut down for the year at the time of your visit. Tivoli has hosted many legendary performers over the years: everyone from Marlene Dietrich to a flea circus that ran for 65 years. Their appearances are documented in the museum.

The spire is open to anyone who wants to navigate the 400 or more steps, which spiral narrower and narrower as they reach the summit\n\nD – Family Fun Attractions\n\nOverview:\n\nArt galleries have never been particularly child friendly, or even interesting for children. In Copenhagen, this problem has been addressed and corrected. Many attractions are family oriented, and most contain a special area of interest to children. Copenhagen is a perfect city for visiting children.\n\nNo trip to Copenhagen would be complete without a visit to Tivoli (it’s open from mid April to mid September). Right in the middle of town, Tivoli offers both the fun of the fair, the peace and tranquility of a park and the ambience of the many open air cafes, restaurants and bars. It’s a real wonderland for children of all ages, with its marooned pirate ship, roller coaster rides, shooting galleries, and the Valhala Castle, home of The Nordic God, Odin, who welcomes children to the Valhala Restaurant.\n\nFor more rides and amusements, just out of town lies Bakken, (open from late March to late August, with free admission). A well established pleasure park situated on the wooded outskirts of Dyrehaven. The child friendly restaurant is the perfect place to relax after Bakken’s notorious roller coaster.\n\nAs a visitor with children in Copenhagen it’s not difficult to keep both yourself and them entertained. There are now many children friendly museums, where it’s designed to be interesting both for you and the kids. The National Museum for example features a special children’s section.\n\nNational Gallery’s (Statens Museum for Kunst) new Children’s Gallery. The idea behind the new addition of the art museum is to teach children the values in art, but on their own terms. Featuring selected original works from the permanent collections, workshops and a theater, the Children’s Gallery gives children an insight into various creative processes.\n\nFor the more scientifically minded there’s the Experimentarium, a collection of hands-on installations and exhibitions demonstrating the wonders of natural science. Crazy mirrors, water wheels, computer rooms, logic puzzles, and so on.\n\nThe Kids´ Pavillion is for children aged 3-6. Continuing the scientific theme, there’s the Tycho Brahe Planetarium. In it’s impressive building at the end of the city’s string of lakes, the Planetarium boasts an Omnimax theatre, which projects a hemispherical image within its dome. As you sit in the reclining seats, it’s impossible not to physically experience the movie; be it an underwater safari or a trip on a roller coaster.\n\nCopenhagen is also the proud owner of a major Zoo. Probably the most popular are the Monkey House, Children’s Zoo and the Night Zoo where day is turned into night. Just outside the city lies\n\nDenmark’s Aquarium with it’s spectacular tropical and sea-water landscape tanks filled with fish and aquatic mammals from all over the world.\n\nIf you take one of the Water Buses, you can hop off at Langelinie for a closer look at the grand cruise liners moored there and the Little Mermaid.\n\nA spectacular trip along the North coast leads to Lousiana Museum of Modern Art. Situated right on the coast, the gardens, beach and the special children’s house, make it an ideal destination.\n\nA perfect way to round off the day could be a visit to Vandkulturhuset in DGI-town, Copenhagen’s new sports and cultural centre. Vandkulturhuset includes a new swimming pool with lots of fun for children: young and old. Take a swim in the pool formed as a super-ellipse, play in the children’ s pool or the water park with diving and climbing areas, or relax in hot water baths with spa, etc.\n\nAmong Copenhagen’s many parks, Frederiksberg Have is particularly suitable for children.
