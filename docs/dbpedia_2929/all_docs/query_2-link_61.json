        "text": "A hidden corner in the library where she can move the furniture around and be herself. An iced-coffee and a good book on a bench with no one around. These make Emily happy through her busy routine. Sometimes she just needs time on her own. A skatepark where she can skate and hang out with her friends is Rebecca’s favorite place to spend her time. But she wouldn’t go there by herself – “that would be too terrifying!” Anna and Caroline dream of sunny days by the harbor, swimming and relaxing, but most importantly being with their friends. They don’t really care where they go, as long as they are all together. Well maybe they do care, just a little anyway… “City Hall square is too boring and the air in Fisketorvet mall is too stuffy.” Sona is rather new to Copenhagen. The first time she had to walk home from the station in Svanemøllen in the dark she walked right beside the light poles, which were few and far apart. Now she doesn’t care anymore. She knows the area and feels more comfortable. These stories are just a few of the many Yalda Pilehchian, Trine Relster, Dorte Westergaard, and I heard this week from 5 of the teenage girls, participating in our research project Urban Minded. Designers at times can generalize and simplify when considering the needs of user groups. But these five girls, who joined us for a workshop at Henning Larsen, were so different, having different routines, hobbies, interests, and perspectives. With the knowledge that the design of our cities can have a significant impact on our well-being, we need to be better at accommodating these differences, offering space for everyone to thrive. During the next few months, we’ll continue our study, applying qualitative methods of data collection to focus on the well-being of young girls in relation to their built environment, considering how urban design can be better informed by the vast range of their needs and preferences.
