        "text": "Open Index\n\nCopenhagen, the capital of Denmark, is a beautiful city with plenty of attractions and things to do, also ideal to discover on foot or by bike. In this case, it becomes essential to identify the best area to stay in, especially according to your needs.\n\nHere is a practical guide on where to sleep in Copenhagen, with the best neighbourhoods and some valuable tips for your stay in the city: the best areas, and accommodation suitable for all types of travellers.\n\nIn a hurry? Here's our recommended accommodation\n\nUseful tips: the best neighborhoods to stay in Copenhagen\n\nNot recommended areas: we do not recommend staying in neighbourhoods too far from the historic centre and suburbs, as they will force you to always travel by public transport. Copenhagen is a safe city, but it's essential to be careful in busy areas.\n\nLike all the big cities of Northern Europe, Copenhagen is relatively expensive, both in terms of accommodation and meals. Searching for accommodation requires a fairly substantial budget unless you opt for hostels and small apartments, which can undoubtedly give you more freedom than a hotel!\n\nIndre By, the city's ancient heart, is undoubtedly the best area to explore many tourist attractions on foot and the richest in terms of services. It is the area of the Nyhavn canal, Strøget boulevard and pedestrian areas, and Christiansborg Castle.\n\nIf you are travelling with children, you can also consider Østerbro, further north, which is the Little Mermaid district and is very rich in parks, and Frederiksberg, west of the centre, where you'll find the famous Copenhagen Zoo. Both are easily connected to the centre but are quiet in the evening as they are residential districts.\n\nBest accommodations: we have selected the best hotels, b&bs and hostels in Copenhagen. Check out our recommendations and make your reservation on Booking\n\nIndre By (Nyhavn, Tivoli, Strøget, Castles)\n\nThis is Copenhagen's historic centre, as well as its most important cultural hub. An excellent base for a weekend away, it is an elegant and lively neighbourhood that offers the convenience of walking to the city's main attractions, such as the Botanical Garden, the Tivoli, and the Danish Design Center. One of the main attractions is undoubtedly the Nyhavn canal, which is the city's ancient port! It represents one of the main tourist places, and here you will find many unique bars and cafes. The best view is from the Mindeankeret, an ancient commemorative anchor.\n\nHere, you can also experience the nightlife thanks to a wide selection of pubs, bars and restaurants one after the other along the canals or hidden in the maze of narrow ancient alleys. Also in this area is the famous Strøget, the avenue crowded by low-cost chains and prestigious boutiques. As always, staying in the centre is more expensive, but the offer is wide and varied.\n\nAverage prices in the neighbourhood range from around €84,00 per night - compare the best accommodation on Booking\n\nRecommended accommodation\n\nVesterbro (Copenhagen Museum, Carlsberg Museum)\n\nTo the southwest of the centre, here once were the factories for processing meat and food. After the recent renovation, this neighbourhood has become highly welcoming.\n\nThe neighbourhood is developed near the historic centre, so it's easy to move on foot. Also, here is the Københavns Hovedbanegård Central Station, close to the famous Tivoli Gardens.\n\nVesterbro hotels are the cheapest in the city while offering excellent quality and service. The old factories have been transformed into museums and art galleries; the neighbourhood is also known for its high-quality restaurants. Attractions in the area include the Copenhagen Museum and the Carlsberg Beer Museum, located within the historic brewery.\n\nAverage prices in the neighbourhood range from around €75,00 per night - compare the best accommodation on Booking\n\nRecommended accommodation\n\nChristianshavn (Christiania)\n\nThis is an area known for hosting the autonomous community of Christiania, which since the 1970s has been a real self-proclaimed neighbourhood with self-managed rules, services and economy. The district extends northeast of Indre By, from which it's divided by the Københavns Havn canal and connected by the Knippels Bridge.\n\nThis neighbourhood looks like a jumble of small alleys and canals overlooked by typical colourful Danish-style houses, warehouses, buildings decorated with splendid murals, galleries, cafes and alternative places frequented by the area's residents. Closed to traffic, here you can walk in total relaxation, enjoying the hipster and bohemian atmosphere. Being a residential area, it is tranquil and peaceful, although there are many concerts and outdoor events in summer.\n\nThe easternmost part of the district is home to the Christiania community. Tourists can safely visit the area as long as they respect the residents' privacy, for example, avoiding taking photographs of people without prior consent and not disturbing the animals. As for the stay, there are very few accommodations available, so we recommend you opt for Christianshavn.\n\nAverage prices in the neighbourhood range from around €110,00 per night - compare the best accommodation on Booking\n\nRecommended accommodation\n\nØsterbro (Little Mermaid Statue, Fælledparken, Kastellet)\n\nHere's one of the most exclusive and expensive areas of the city, with numerous luxury hotels. There are two important railway stations in the area, Nordhavn and Svanemøllen, which allows you to reach the centre in no time!\n\nA quiet residential area and one of the greenest in the city, Østerbro is also ideal for families. It is home to numerous gardens, including the Fælledparken public park, the largest in Denmark. At the southern edge, there is also the famous statue of the Little Mermaid. Other attractions include the fortified citadel of Kastellet and the Den Frie Center for Contemporary Art. There is a wide choice of cafes and restaurants, including many proposals for organic, vegan and vegetarian cuisine.\n\nAverage prices in the neighbourhood range from around €104,00 per night - compare the best accommodation on Booking\n\nRecommended accommodation\n\nNørrebro\n\nTo the northwest of the centre is the most strategic neighbourhood for staying in a comfortable area without spending a fortune. In the neighbourhood there is the Nørrebros Runddel St. metro station, connected to the red line M3, which leads directly to Indre By.\n\nLively and multicultural, Nørrebro is particularly recommended for shopping, art and literature lovers, thanks to the numerous art galleries, bookstores, venues where meetings with authors are held periodically, and vintage and antique shops, mainly concentrated on Ravnsborggade Street. And finally, there is no shortage of parks to chill out in the greenery or practice some sport.\n\nAverage prices in the neighbourhood range from around €80,00 per night - compare the best accommodation on Booking\n\nRecommended accommodation\n\nFrederiksberg (Frederiksberg Gardens, Zoo)\n\nChic and elegant, it is one of the most luxurious and expensive neighbourhoods in Copenhagen. Here you will find elegant residences, luxury apartments and design hotels, and most of the best restaurants in the city, especially on Værnedamsvej Street.\n\nIt is well connected to the centre thanks to the Frederiksberg Allé metro station and the M3 red line that leads directly to Indre By. Frederiksberg is a family-friendly neighbourhood due to its tranquillity, green areas, and attractions such as Frederiksberg Have park, one of the largest in the city, and the famous Copenhagen Zoo.\n\nAverage prices in the neighbourhood range from around €88,00 per night - compare the best accommodation on Booking\n\nRecommended accommodation\n\nØrestad (DR Koncerthuset)\n\nCopenhagen's most avant-garde district boasts splendid examples of contemporary architecture perfectly integrated with the young and lively atmosphere of the surrounding landscape dominated by water and nature.\n\nLocated on the island of Amager, it is, however, well connected to the centre thanks to the excellent transport network that allows you to reach the airport and other districts rather quickly, especially the green metro line M1, which leads directly to Indre By. In the evening it is possible to attend a show at the DR Koncerthuset. There are various types of accommodation, all modern and with all comforts.\n\nAverage prices in the neighbourhood range from around €75,00 per night - compare the best accommodation on Booking\n\nRecommended accommodation\n\nPlaces to stay near Copenhagen\n\nSleeping in Copenhagen is the best choice. There is no reason to prefer another place in Denmark over the capital. The whole nation is expensive; indeed, it is easier to find low-cost solutions in Copenhagen than in other neighbouring towns.\n\nIn addition, the organization of transport, the agencies and the tours services also make it perfect for those who want to spend whole days exploring the surroundings, such as the castle's area between Roskilde, Hillerød and Helsingør.\n\nIf you want to discover Western Denmark overlooking the North Sea, we recommend Odense, Esbjerg and Aalborg. However, it is a completely different type of holiday.\n\nIf you are in Copenhagen for business or as a one-day stopover to other destinations, consider sleeping near the airport.
