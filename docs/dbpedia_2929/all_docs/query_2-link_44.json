        "text": "A second drawings omits the alley and has a continuous row of 25 houses along Brigadevej.\n\nThe houses as built were different with a row of eight on the first section of Nygade, on the south side of the road so facing north. Then, after the alley, a row of 8 houses facing east - the last house larger and extending round the corner - and then, after this second corner, four pairs of houses facing north. These are now identified as the addresses Sverrigsgade 17-63.\n\nA revised drawing by Sibbern for the remaining houses is dated 1871.\n\nThis is for six houses in a row facing south, now Brigadevej 34-46, and a pair of houses in line to their west but set back and now having the addresses Finlandsgade 2 and Finlandsgade 4.\n\nThe two-storey houses are relatively wide with a front door to one side and two windows on the ground floor with three windows on the first floor. The door leads into an entrance passage with a staircase on one side towards the back half of the house where the passage continues back to a door out into a back garden. The houses have an almost-square room to the front and two narrow rooms to the garden side, the room next to the garden door fitted out as a kitchen with a fireplace for cooking against the cross wall between the front and the back rooms. Each of the other rooms is shown with a stove for heating close to the kitchen fire so they can share the same flue that rises up to a central chimney at the ridge of the roof. Above, the plan on the first floor has two rooms to the front with a wider room continuing over the entrance and the first-floor apartments had a kitchen above the ground-floor kitchen beside a staircase continuing up to an attic.\n\nAt the rear of the houses, the plan shows circles across the party wall between pairs of houses that were, presumably, water wells, and each house had a small toilet at the end of the garden that must have been an earth or ash closet â€¦ water closets are not built in the city until about 1900.\n\nThe houses are built in brick with simple decoration including bands or strings of brick set forward between the floors and bricks set diagonally along the eaves to form a zig-zag decoration to form a cornice.\n\nA house at the centre of the first row along Sverrigsgade has a plaque below a first-floor windows inscribed Anno 1869.\n\nnote:\n\nThe name of the street was changed from Nygade to Sverrigsgade in 1902.\n\nThe row houses in Lyngbyvejskvartet / Lingbyvej Quarter were built by the Workers Building Association between 1906 and 1929 for workers from Burmeister Wain and the architect was Christen Larsen who had replaced Frederik Boettger as architect to the association.\n\nLyngbyvej - the King's highway - is an important and historic road that runs out north from the city to Lyngby and from there on to the royal castle at Frederiksborg.\n\nThe housing is about 4 kilometres from the centre of Copenhagen. In a modern city this might not seem far but until the city defences were dismantled around 1870, the historic core of Copenhagen, on this side of the harbour, was confined to an area little more than a kilometre from the wharves to the north gate and around 1.5 kilometres across from the east gate to the west gate with remarkably little building outside the defences â€¦. so this was quite a long way out of the centre for workers employed at the engineering works of Burmeister Wain on Christianshavn on the far side of the city or for men working at their ship yards at RefshaleÃ¸en.\n\nThis was a large plot of land â€¦ along Lyngbyvej it is 245 metres wide and it runs back to the west from Lingbyvej for just under 240 metres to Studsgaardsgade that is the west boundary. The north boundary is Borthigsgade and the south boundary Haraldsgade.\n\nFor the new houses, a spine road - F F Ulriks Gade - was laid out, running back from Lyngbyvej to Studsgaardsgade, with four cross streets running north south with H P Ã˜rums Gade closest to and parallel with Lyngbyvej and then Engelstedsgade, Valdemar Holmes Gade and Rudolph Berghs Gade.\n\nThe plot is not rectangular - the south boundary, Haraldsgade, curves away to the south west - so each cross street from Lyngbyvej working west is progressively longer to the south. This makes a marked difference to the streets â€¦ so at the west end of the housing, H P Ã˜rums Gade - the first cross street - is 100 metres long to the north of F F Ulriks Gade with ten houses on its west side, including larger houses at each end forming pavilions, and 140 metres long on the south side of the spine street with 13 houses with end pavilions. In contrast, at the far west end, south of FF Ulriks Gade, the row facing onto Studsgaardsgade is 240 metres long with 25 houses in the row with again larger houses or pavilions at each end.\n\nOnce completed there were 323 homes here arranged as twenty long rows or terraces running north south but with a further five short rows along the north side of the cross street - along the north side of F F Ulriks Gade - across the ends of the rows to the north and screening the long views down the gardens between the rows - and there were five similar blocks along Haraldsgade facing south.\n\nThe streets are now all on much the same level but historic drawings indicate that the land sloped down to the south and that some of the roads had to be raised and levelled above vaulted structures.\n\nThe names given to the roads are significant. Frederik Ferdinand Ulrik was a physician, who was a district and municipal doctor in Christianshavn â€¦ so he was working close to the engineering works. He was interested in the socialist movement in England and in Copenhagen he became a driving force behind the foundation of savings banks, public libraries and centres for adult education.\n\nHe gave a lecture about socialism and new workersâ€™ political movements that was printed and posted up in the workshops at the engineering works of Burmeister Wain and soon after a meeting was held there, in November 1865, and the Workers Construction Association was formed the following day.\n\nMost of the other streets here were named after doctors from the city hospitals.\n\nThe streets are wide, particularly F F Ukriks Gade, and all the houses had front gardens with low fences but space between rows at the back was surprisingly narrow, given the height of the houses, so the yards behind are relatively small.\n\nUnfortunately, the houses along the main road - Lyngbyvej - lost their front gardens when the road was widened - presumably in the 1960s - and at that time the larger houses or pavilions at the ends of the two rows facing on to Lyngbyvej were altered and cut back.\n\nThese larger houses at the end of each row, particularly those grouped along F F Ulriks Gade, look more like a series of villas than like workers' housing.\n\nThe houses are said to have been built in fourteen phases over the twenty or so years it look to complete the estate and certainly there are different details in different streets including different designs for porches but also some slightly more interesting or eccentric details so the houses along one of the streets have nesting boxes for birds that are high up on the front of the houses and built with bricks that are set to project out from the main courses of brickwork.\n\nWith ornate balconies, an interesting mixture of red and pale brickwork and details in the brickwork like oval windows and courses of brick imitating rusticated pilasters and with a variety of ornate gables and dormers the style of the architecture is what is called national romantic.\n\nThere are drawings with plans and elevations for the housing in the national archive of Danmarks Kunstbibliotek and these can be studied on line.\n\nOriginally all the houses were divided with one apartment on each floor but subsequently many have been combined to form single family homes.\n\nThese are large houses that have basements that contained laundries, drying rooms and store rooms and there were separate apartments on the ground floor, first floor and at attic level. The roofs are steeply-pitched mansards so attic apartments have good head room and a similar floor area to the lower apartments.\n\nWhat is striking is that the apartments all had their own toilet - not always the case even in large apartment buildings in the city in the 1920s. These toilets were mostly internal, so generally immediately inside the front door of the apartment, off the entrance lobby, so without windows or ventilation to the outside.\n\nApartments varied in size in the different rows and, particularly in the larger pavilions, some larger apartments were laid out so the toilet was against an outside wall so those could have windows for natural light and ventilation. None of the apartments had a bath.\n\nIn most of the houses in the rows there was a lobby area inside the front door and then a short flight of steps up to the main floor that was raised above street level by the service rooms in the half basement. Then the main staircase doubled back towards a landing at the front with a window at an intermediate floor level above the front door and then doubled back again up to the first floor in what is described in English architecture as a dog-leg staircase.\n\nOn F F Ulriks Gade - the main street running east west - the houses at each intersection have more elaborate architectural treatment and more prominent roofs and gables or large dormer windows so they look like pavilions but with the corners towards the intersection angled off and most had a door on that angle with the ground-floor space planned as a shop with a store room or back room to the shop and an apartment behind for the shop keeper. These houses also have a separate front door that gives access to the staircase up to the apartments above the shop and this door also provides private access to the shop keeper's apartment in addition to the access from the shop.\n\nAlthough the apartments varied in size, all had, by modern standards, small kitchens. With one large bedroom, some had just one living room, labelled on the drawings as a day room, but most also had a dining room or a small second living room that for many families would have been used as a second bedroom.\n\nThe windows are large, including the opening windows, which has caused some problems with failure of the frame, where condensation has caused rot along the bottom rail, and the weight of double-glazed units, fitted when the windows are replaced, must be a problem when the original frames are so thin.\n\nThere is an interesting arrangement of narrow and wide windows giving the fronts of the building a clear rhythm. Long horizontal panels, above the main windows, are glazed in the main rooms.\n\nÃ˜rnegÃ¥rdsvej is just south of the suburban railway station at JÃ¦gersborg so about 10 kilometres north of the centre of Copenhagen. When the houses were constructed in the 1950s this was a major area of new housing as Copenhagen expanded after the second world war.\n\nThe street is now a quiet cul-de-sac but the arrangement of the roads around has changed as this triangular-shaped block is now isolated by later motorways or slip roads to the motorways on all sides.\n\nThere are three blocks of row houses all orientated in the same way - running north south and so facing east and west - with small front gardens on the east side and private back gardens on the west side.\n\nThe main block of houses is along SlÃ¸jfen with 14 homes in a continuous row on the west side of the road. On the west side of the terrace is a service road with gates for access to each back garden and that service road ends at the south end in two rows of garages that are original to the scheme. On the west side of that service road is the second row of eight houses with small gardens to the front, towards the service road, and behind the houses, on the west side, back gardens with gates onto a footpath and then, on the west side of that footpath, the final block of seven houses - again with the front gardens and front doors on the east side and to the rear or west side their back gardens.\n\nFences across the ends of the rear gardens are also original with again fibre-reinforced cement panels that are painted grey. Early photographs of the houses show short fences or screens for privacy with just two high panels running out from the rear wall between each house.\n\nThe three blocks of houses have flat roofs and floors are reinforced concrete but crosswalls are brick - although the initial proposal was to use concrete."
