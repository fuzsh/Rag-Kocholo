Don’t trust your new partner? Test them with emotion-sensing technology! Soon you’ll be able to do it! But would you want to?\n\nFuture Human – How Far Will You Go? zooms in on six technologies that are expected to have a significant impact on our lives in the next 10-15 years.\n\nHands-on science highlights\n\nExperience a lifetime in the Tunnel of Senses, be tricked by light and darkness in the Labyrinth of Light and jump to be part of the movie in the Interactive Film Theatre – the world’s first interactive cinema based on movement sensors.\n\nDive into the physics and chemistry of water and go on an underwater safari in the mysterious submarine in Experimentarium’s water exhibition The Beach. Get the ball rolling in the world’s largest interactive ball track and learn an important lesson about world trade and CO2.
