        "text": "Since the dawn of the cinema, there has always been a tension between genre and auteur film. Genre films are entertainment films produced for mass consumption; auteur films are films that are “authored” – that is, they are art works created by artistically-inclined film directors, meant for a smaller, more discerning audience. (We’ll be focusing on auteur cinema in two weeks, when we see Kathryn Bigelow’s Zero Dark Thirty).\n\nThis tension between genre and auteur is productive. It forces film directors to be creative in how they evoke, and vary, genre conventions. The authors of your textbook put it this way:\n\nGenres thrive when filmmakers find ways to modify the conventions. So, while audiences carry a set of expectations with them whenever they attend a genre film, for most audiences, one of these expectations is that the film will surprise them by upsetting some of their expectations. For most critics, the most pronounced criterion for evaluating a film is how much originality it injects into the formula without totally abandoning the conventions of the genre. (401)\n\nIn class, I explained this by way of the “Craft/Art Continuum,” with “convention” (fidelity to genre conventions) at one end, and invention (creative variation upon conventions). The reason I call it the “Craft/Art” continuum is that directors on the “convention” end would be more likely to designate themselves as craftspeople, whereas directors on the “invention” end would more likely call themselves artists.\n\nMost Hollywood films fall somewhere along the continuum, some closer to more formulaic conventional films, and others to more experimental inventional films. The conventional films might make more money, but generally it’s the inventional films that win most of the Oscars at the Academy Awards.\n\nThe problem with this model is that many people (particularly critics) don’t see it as a continuum, but rather as a scale from bad to good. That is, they view conventional films as bad films, or not-as-good-as art films. Conversely, many people view inventional films as the crème de la crème of the cinema, and their very lack of popularity testifies to their high art aspirations.\n\nIt is these prejudices that cause film critics like Eileen Jones to wail and gnash their teeth. In a review (and attack upon) the independent film Escape From Tomorrow, she writes:\n\nThe tendency of American filmmakers to overvalue “art” in its most spurious forms, and undervalue the demanding craft of making excellent entertainment—which, ironically, will get you to art faster than most approaches. . . . It’s a fallacy that’s heavily featured in discussions of what ails American cinema, the suggestion that you can have either an art film or a popular commercial movie, but not both on the same reel (or in the same digital encoding), because the two categories are mutually exclusive.\n\nJones takes the side of the popular commercial movie, or what she also calls genre film. She writes:\n\nEvery generation of jackass critics trots out the same platitudes about how films designed to make money by attracting mass audiences are insufficiently heartfelt, artistic, risk-taking, and personal, and are, therefore, bad. That critical party line has been consistent for a century now, and wrong for a century. Wrong, because the majority of great American films have emerged from the crucible of commercial entertainment, from the harrowing process of trying to make something effective and mass-marketable, on time and under budget.\n\nAmerican genre films, according to Jones, are incredibly creative in how they are produced. Not so creative are American independent films, which have taken on the worst qualities of European art films:\n\nEuropeans seem comfortable with exercises in strenuous profundity, but we Americans have a long and honorable tradition of queasiness about artistic pretension. “Craft” is the right endeavor for us. It suggests working-class construction, deft ability, professionalism, and a certain mental sharpness – slyness, even.\n\nJones expresses her problems with the continuum I described above:\n\nPopular genre stuff is generally shoved to one end of the spectrum and independent/art film to the other, impoverishing both forms. The result? Increasingly, genre film is debased, carelessly recycled formula product marketed to the stupidest teenagers. Art and independent film is equally debased, carelessly recycled “meaningful” clichés and empty formal exercises marketed to the most ossified critics and other pompous gits.\n\nTell us what you really think, Ms. Jones!\n\nJones, in the end, does not reject artistic, “inventional” films out of hand: she argues that demonizing genre film and sanctifying art film impoverishes both. She proposes, instead, that genre and art film work together.\n\nThe question, now, is where does Michael Curtiz fit into this picture? Even though he won an Academy Award for Best Director (for Casablanca), Curtiz is rarely if ever described as a great director or an auteur.\n\nJones mentions him in her review. She cites the French film critic Andre Bazin to urge independent film auteurs to\n\nconsider “the genius of the system,” i.e. the Hollywood studio system, which, though it ground out a lot of crap, also produced many highly effective films that could by no stretch of the imagination be considered “art” made by “auteurs,” director/author figures with unique, personal, visionary oeuvres. Bazin’s example of an effective non-auteur was Michael Curtiz, a Hungarian-born transplant who worked on assignment at Warner Brothers for many years and made an awful lot of fantastically memorable films in all sorts of genres.\n\nCurtiz made “vivid, lively movies, with no directorial ‘signature’ style, propelled by the narrative drive of genre.”\n\nBazin was actually one of the godfathers of auteur theory, and we will look more at him and his influence when we consider auteur film. But, as Jones points out, Bazin was very appreciative of “the genius of the [Hollywood, genre] system.”\n\nAnnette Kuhn and Guy Westwell note that “the auteur policy drew a distinction between workmanlike directors – metteurs en scene – who produced well-crafted films and true auteurs who were able to create art: Michael Curtiz was placed in the first category, and Nicholas Ray in the second” (26).\n\nThat is, Michael Curtiz was a craftsman, and Nicholas Ray an artist.\n\nDavid Denby, at The New Yorker, agrees that Curtiz was not an artist, or an auteur. Denby writes: “The auteurs of ‘Casablanca’ are Hal Wallis and the long-ago big studios themselves – their atmosphere and talents, with corruptions and generosities all mixed together – what André Bazin called ‘the genius of the system.'”\n\nC. Jerry Kutner adds:\n\nMichael Curtiz . . . is considered by many to be one of the quintessential Hollywood directors – he is, after all, the man who directed Casablanca, Yankee Doodle Dandy, and The Adventures of Robin Hood. Yet in auteurist circles he is given short shrift. Andrew Sarris [leading proponent of auteur cinema in the United States], for example, calls Casablanca “the happiest of happy accidents, and the most decisive exception to the auteur theory.”\n\nBut Kutner thinks Curtiz the craftsman is also an auteur:\n\nTo be considered an auteur, a director must have either a consistently recognizable visual style or recognizable themes – preferably both. There is a recognizable Curtiz visual style, a kind of von-Sternbergian expressionism, but it is mainly visible in his horror films, film noirs, or quasi-noirs [like Casablanca].\n\nThe “recognizable” theme appearing and re-appearing in Curtiz’s films, according to Kutner, is the “rebel-in-spite-of-himself” (and “rebel-in-spite-of-herself”).\n\nThe Italian post-structuralist semiotician Umberto Eco would not necessarily agree that Michael Curtiz is a great art director, but he does think Casablanca is a great film – almost in spite of itself.\n\nIn an influential essay on Casablanca, Eco writes:\n\nAccording to traditional standards in aesthetics, Casablanca is not a work of art, if such an expression still has a meaning. . . . Nevertheless, it is a great example of cinematic discourse, a palimpsest for future students of twentieth-century religiosity, a paramount laboratory for semiotic research into textual strategies. Moreover, it has become a cult movie. (462)\n\nA “cult movie,” according to Eco, is not the same thing as a profound work of art: “A cult movie . . . must display some organic imperfections” (462). Eco adds that “in order to transform a work into a cult object one must be able to break, dislocate, unhinge it so that one can remember only parts of it, irrespective of their original relationship with the whole” (463).\n\nTo reiterate, to be a cult object a film must be “unhinged,” that is be “a disconnected series of images, of peaks, of visual icebergs. It should display not one idea but many. It should not reveal a coherent philosophy of composition. It must live on, and because of, its glorious ricketiness” (463).\n\nThen Eco puts it into the terms of semiotics (the study of the structure of language and texts). For Eco, a cult film is a\n\nliving example of living textuality. It’s address must suspect it is not true that works are created by their authors. Works are created by works, texts are created by texts, all together they speak to each other independently of the intention of their authors. (463)\n\nThus, Casablanca is a text without an author. It is, instead, a mash-up of genres – what Eco calls “archetypes.” I discussed this genre hybridity in another blog entry; here I will only note that it is the surplus of genres that makes Casablanca a cult movie for Eco. He writes:\n\nWhen all the archetypes burst out shamelessly, we plumb Homeric profundity. Two cliches make us laugh but a hundred cliches move us because we sense dimly that the cliches are talking among themselves, celebrating a reunion. (469)\n\nEco adds: “Casablanca became a cult movie because it is not one movie. It is ‘movies.’ And this is the reason it works, in defiance of any aesthetic theory” (469). Casablanca is not one genre; it is “genre.”\n\nBut, again, for Eco this is all part of the author-less “happy accident” that was Casablanca.\n\nForced to improvise a plot, the authors mixed in a little of everything, and everything they chose came from a repertoire that had stood the test of time. When only a few of these formulas are used, the result is simply kitsch. But when the repertoire of stock formulas is used wholesale, then the result is an architectural like Gaudi’s Sagrada Familia [a famous modernist cathedral in Barcelona, Spain]: the same vertigo, the same stroke of genius. (465)\n\nNote that Eco does mention “authors” in this passage, and associates them with a “stroke of genius.” So maybe Curtiz is an auteur after all?\n\nWhat I’d like to suggest is that Curtiz can be considered the author/auteur of Casablanca, particularly because he had to cobble together a film from many disparate, even contradictory, elements. Casablanca is an art film because it is a genre mash-up, and, because it is so prolific (if not promiscuous) in its sampling of genre.\n\nWith Casablanca, the master of genre film created a masterpiece of genre film that calls attention to itself as genre film. It is self-reflexive (or self-referential, or self-aware) in that regard. Usually, that alone would be enough to qualify Curtiz as an auteur.\n\nIn the end, however, it is future generations of critics and viewers who will decide whether Curtiz was or was not an auteur. But then, it’s quite possible that that determination will be overturned by critics and viewers who come even later. The fact of the matter is, the standards of cinematic art morph over time. Some are jettisoned from the pantheon of great directors, replaced by others, but the pantheon is never fixed.\n\nAnd there are some contributing factors – such as the role ideology and social context have to play in determining whether a film is a great work of art, or needs to be – that we have not yet considered. That is what we will take on next in this course, in the next two weeks.\n\nJoseph Byrne\n\nUniversity of Maryland\n\n* * *\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDavid Denby. “Everybody Comes to Rick’s: ‘Casablanca’ on the Big Screen.” The New Yorker.

February 7, 2013.\n\nhttp://brightlightsfilm.com/blog/2013/02/michael-curtiz-auteur-without-a-theme.html#.Um_-OvkjIYM\n\nOur primary example of genre film in this class is Casablanca (1942, Michael Curtiz). However, this is not because it is a great example of one particular genre, but rather because it is a unique example of a film that samples from many genres.\n\nBefore continuing, I should define genre. A film genre is a film category. According to your textbook, a genre is “a group of films that share a set of narrtive, stylistic, and thematic characteristics or conventions” (383).\n\nAn important question is who decides the genres? Is is critics and scholars who define genre? Or is it viewers?\n\nIt’s probably a combination of both, working in tandem, or sometimes one or the other. If you go to Netflix, for instance, you’ll see genres that are popular – that is, genres defined by viewers. You won’t see a film noir or western genre there: viewers tend to think of film noirs as something else (action/suspense with a bit of atmosphere), and don’t generally see westerns at all, since it is almost a dead genre at this point.\n\nHowever, if you do searches in an academic database, you’ll find plenty of articles on westerns and film noirs precisely because they are “iffy” genres.\n\nFilm producers and studios also use genre. But instead of using it to classify films that viewers might want to watch, or that critics want to study, producers use genre to advertise films. If you’ve ever sat before movie listings and tried pick a movie based on what you were in the mood for (a comedy? an action film? a “foreign” film?), know what I mean.\n\nIt’s important to note that most Hollywood films borrow from multiple genres. This is because Hollywood films are made to appeal to as many people as possible, so adding musical numbers to an action/suspense film (as in Casablanca) entertains those who like action/suspense films and those who like musicals.\n\nBut what makes Casablanca unique in this regard is that the director, Michael Curtiz, samples from more than the action/suspense and musical genres. In fact, Casablanca is a genre mash-up.\n\nWe see evidence of this genre mash-up starting at the beginning of the film.\n\nAs in Citizen Kane, Curtiz begins the film with a mock newsreel. So, the first film genre we’re presented with is newsreel/documentary. In terms of conventions, the mock newsreel in Casablanca uses the same style of voice-over used in newsreels (and in Citizen Kane). Also conventional is the inclusion of amateur and documentary film footage (not filmed by Curtiz) which, in this case, shows the plight of refugees in Europe after the Nazi invasions of most of the countries of western Europe.\n\nFollowing the newsreel, the film cuts to someone reading a news bulletin (announcing the murder of the German couriers and the stealing of letters of transit), followed by instructions to the police. The film genre has changed: now we are watching an espionage film.\n\nBut it isn’t long before we find ourselves in another film, in regards to genre.\n\nAfter the news bulletin, the film cuts to a round up of “the usual suspects” in Casablanca. One man is stopped, produces fake identification papers, and then makes a run for it. He is shot in the back and falls dead beneath a poster of Marshal Philippe Petain, the dictatorial president of the Vichy regime (in non-occupied southern France), which collaborated with the Nazis. On the poster we read the words: “Je Tiens Mes Promesses Mem Celles Des Autres,” which translates as “I Keep My Promises, Just as I Keep the Promises of Others”). This meant to be ironic and hypocritical, in that Petain has violated his promises to uphold the core values of France, particularly liberté, egalité, and fraternité (freedom, equality, and friendship).\n\nThe man who is shot dies while clutching a resistance handbill bearing the Cross of Lorraine symbol, which shows that he is a member of the underground Free France Organization, headed by Petain’s arch rival, General Charles De Gaulle.\n\nSo what is the propaganda value of this short segment for an American audience? It reinforces American resolve in Europe by showing that the Nazis need to be opposed, and eventually defeated. At the same time, it shows that remaining neutral (like the Vichy regime is “neutral”) is little more than collaboration with the great evil that is fascism.\n\nHowever, the propaganda genre is almost immediately succeeded by another genre. I’m going to call this genre the expatriate film, which focuses on the misadventures of people traveling in countries not their own, often highlighting their ignorance of local customs and chauvinistic regard for their own national traditions (in contrast to the traditions of the “natives”). More specifically, Casablanca is a time-of-war expatriate film.\n\nBut it isn’t long before the expatriate film yields to the war film (which is also related to the propaganda film). The film cuts to a plane landing at the airport. Those trapped in Casablanca greet the sight of the plane hopefully, thinking it is the plane from Lisbon (in Portugal, a neutral country, from which most passengers would fly on to the then-neutral United States). But instead, it is the Major Strasser, of the Gestapo, landing in Casablanca in a mission to detain, capture, or kill Victor Laszlo. The “evil Nazi” was a convention of World War II films. Film-makers like Steven Spielberg (Schindler’s List) and Quentin Tarantino (Inglorious Basterds) revise the “evil Nazi” war movie genre by depicting Nazis who were not one-sided, monolithically-evil antagonists.\n\nAfter the war film genre has been established, we finally get inside Rick’s cafe (“everyone comes to Rick’s”), and the film reverts to the time-of-war expatriate film. By visiting a few different tables, we witness the varieties of desperation of those seeking to escape Casablanca for America.\n\nThen we meet Rick, first as a signature, then as a hand playing chess, and finally as a man in a white dinner jacket. In the figure of Rick, we have to combined genres: the time-of-war expatriate film and the propaganda film. Rick represents the cynical expatriate, but he also stands for a United States that refuses to get involved (again) in European wars. “I stick my neck out for nobody,” Rick says, declaring his independence.\n\nThe rest of the film shows Rick slowly but surely sticking his neck out for the anti-fascist cause (of which he is quite familiar, since he already fought the fascist Italians in Ethiopia and the fascist Germans and Spaniards in Spain, during the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s). So in Rick is dramatized the move from isolationism to intervention in Europe.\n\nShortly thereafter, when Ugarte talks with Rick and leaves with him the stolen letters of transit, we are re-introduced to the espionage film.\n\nIn a celebrated essay on Casablanca, Umberto Eco breaks down the genre break down differently. He lists the various genres at play at the beginning of the film:\n\n1. First, African music, then the Marseillaise. Two different genres are evoked: adventure movie and patriotic movie.\n\n2. Third genre: The globe: Newsreel. The voice even suggests the news report. Fourth genre: the odyssey of refugees. Fifth genre: Casablanca and Lisbon are, traditionally, hauts lieux [favorite places] for international intirgues. Thus in two minutes five genres are evoked. (466)\n\nEco also sees evidence of the “barbarian” film (what I call the “evil Nazi” film), and the war propaganda film. Then: “Change of genre: comedy with brilliant dialogue,” followed by the action movie genre (Ugarte’s arrest at Rick’s Cafe), and then the spy movie (467). All this in the first ten minutes of the film.\n\nThere is one prominent genre that Eco doesn’t mention: the film musical. Casablanca is also a musical, particularly in the middle section of the film, set at Rick’s Café. There are a number of musical numbers in this part of the film, some of them performed by Sam, the piano player.\n\nAt 28:52, a Spanish woman sings a song at Rick’s. This is not background music: the song is front and center. The film stops and waits for the song to finish.\n\nThen, Ilsa enters the cafe, with her husband Victor Laszlo. Shortly thereafter, she gets Sam the piano player to play the song she associates with Rick and Paris, “As Time Goes By” (32nd minute of the film). Thus, the musical genre is mashed with the genre for which Casablanca is most known: the romance.\n\nThe musical genre is mashed with the propaganda genre a little later when, provoked by German officers boisterously singing German songs at Rick’s, Victor leads the non-Germans in singing “The Marseillaise,” the national anthem of Free France (the song first became popular during the French Revolution). Quotations of “The Marseillaise” often appear on the soundtrack of Hollywood to signify revolution and/or resistance.\n\nIt’s important for you to know that Warner Brothers, the studio that produced Casablanca, also owned the rights to some of the songs featured in the film, including “As Time Goes By.” Hollywood studios often invested in other media (such as radio and popular music) and built films around these properties (a famous film in this regard is Singing in the Rain). The song has been inextricably linked to the romance genre in the film, but the fact of the matter is that, by using that song, Warner Brothers was plugging the song for radio placement and sheet-music sales (it is, in other words, a kind of product placement).\n\nNow let’s look at the end of the film. Genres continue to collide and coalesce. At one point (around 1:21), Ilsa comes to plead with Rick about the letters of transit. But it’s really about her undiminished love for Rick, and her need to explain why she never showed up at the train station in Paris. So, romance.\n\nBut then, after she is rebuffed by Rick, she becomes a gun-wielding femme fatale, a conventional (and misogynistic) character-type in film noir movies. She is not able to convince Rick with her sexual allure, so she resorts to violence. Other conventions of film noir evoked at this moment are the suspense music and the chiaroscuro lighting.\n\nWhen Ilsa cannot, after all, shoot Rick, the moving is yanked from film noir back to romance.\n\nThe film noir genre reappears at the end of the film, when Rick turns on Captain Renault (after it looked like Rick was turning on Ilsa and Victor), and they all head to the airport (1:39). Rick’s trench coat and dark fedora marks him as a film noir hero. In fact, viewers of the film in 1942 would only have known Humphrey Bogart, the actor who played Rick, from gangster films and films noir – particularly Bogart’s turn as Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon, in 1941).\n\nIn class, I suggested that the film noir yields to the film western when Rick shoots Major Strasser. This is based on the “quick-draw” gunfire exchange between Rick and Strasser, and the otherwise inexplicable appearance of what looks like a Conestoga wagon wheel at the airport. Both the “quick-draw” and the Conestoga wagon wheel are conventions of the western. Another argument in my favor is that many other genres are suggested in the film, so it’s not that unlikely that Curtiz would bring in the western.\n\nThere is, of course, plenty of romance at the end of the film, both before and after Rick shoots Strasser. Rick and Ilsa discuss their love affair, with the lush, romantic music playing in the background and the lighting/cinematography highlights Ilsa’s shining, tearful eyes.\n\nBut this is romance mashed with propaganda, since the reason Rick ultimately rejects the idea of going off with Ilsa and leaving Victor to his fate is that he believes the war will go better if Victor is free and working against the Nazis. That is, he chooses the greater, more abstract good of defeating the Nazis over the lesser, personal good of being with the woman he loves. He finally joins the cause, vowing to fight fascism once again (as he once did in Ethiopia and Spain), in the same way that the United States has finally entered the war on the side of the Allies.\n\nThere is one minor detail that shows how Captain Renault, the officer of the Vichy regime, has also joined the cause, bringing his character within the constraints of the propaganda genre. During his tense exchange with Rick after Rick shoots Strasser, Renault reaches for a bottle of water. It seems quite strange that Renault would get thirsty at such a moment, and it’s tempting to think Warner Brothers was engaging in product placement (long before films did such things). But then Renault thinks better of it, and throws the bottle away. Why? Because the label on the bottle says the water is from Vichy, in France (Vichy was known for its waters). When Renault reads this, he dumps the bottle, which is his way of saying that he is done with the Vichy regime, and is now ready to join the Free French.\n\nAnd that’s how the film ends: with both Rick and walking into the mist, their first steps towards military involvement in the war. The romance, the film noir, the musical, the espionage film, the expatriate film: in the end, they are all subsumed into the genre of the propaganda film. That is, everything must be subsumed into the war effort, including Hollywood entertainment films.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Motion Pictures (BMP), which evaluated Hollywood films for their propaganda value, Casablanca was one of the more propaganda-friendly films of World War II. Though the BMP report did not say so explicitly, the fact that the propaganda message was embedded in a film that sampled from so many other film genres was likely considered a positive thing, because instead of just sugar-coating the propaganda message, the film offers the viewers a box of chocolates with different flavors of that message.\n\nJoseph Byrne\n\nUniversity of Maryland\n\nOctober 2013\n\nApocalypse Now could certainly be called an anti-war film, and ending the Vietnam War was a goal of American counterculture activists, but that is not to say that the film is pro-counterculture. As I hope to show in this post, Apocalypse Now is quite critical of the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s. In fact, the film depicts the moral exhaustion – and to some extent the moral bankruptcy – of the counterculture at the end of the 1970s, which was a key factor in the election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency in 1980, and the conservative tide that followed.\n\nI should first describe the counterculture. In some of the things I posted last week, I used the phrase “sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll” to describe the American counterculture of the 60s and 70s. Those are certainly three important elements of the counterculture. You can add to those elements experiments in communal living, and anti-war activism. (If you want to see the counterculture in action, look at early Doonesbury cartoons, or see the play or film Hair). The main demographic for the counterculture was the nation’s youth, particularly university students. The counterculture was quite critical of people who weren’t young and willing to engage in radical lifestyles. “Don’t trust anyone over 30,” was a slogan of the counterculture, which also means don’t trust anyone who is “bourgeois,” a professional, or in the military.\n\nThe high-point of the counterculture was the Woodstock music festival, in 1969, in which half a million young folks came out to listen to the latest rock acts and to dance naked in the rain. It was all peace and love, and plenty of sex. drugs, and rock-n-roll. However, the optimism of this moment of tribal togetherness was not to last. The Vietnam War would drag on for six more years, the destruction spreading to other countries in Southeast Asia such as Laos and Cambodia, despite the efforts of thousands of young activists to end the war. This includes the college student protesters who were shot down by National Guard soldiers (themselves college students) at Kent State and Jackson State, in 1970.\n\nAfter these student massacres, the counterculture became quite antagonistic towards the war establishment. People now tend to be quite critical of the way young people treated soldiers during the Vietnam War (see Coming Home [1978, Hal Ashby]) – and rightly so, since the soldiers were merely doing what the generals told them to do. There were incidents in which protesters screamed and spit at soldiers coming back from Vietnam. This, despite the fact that many soldiers (as should have been clear in Apocalypse Now) were themselves against the war; many of these ex-soldiers became radical anti-war protesters (see Born on the Fourth of July [1989, Oliver Stone]).\n\nThe protests against returning soldiers were part of the radicalization of the counterculture in the 1970s, in the wake of the massacres at Kent State and Jackson State. This led to a militarization of the peace movement, such that many activists who opposed the Vietnam War “took it to the next level,” and became advocates of the North Vietnamese communists, and combatants against the “imperialist” and capitalist United States. These radicals did not seem to see the contradiction, and twisted logic, of waging war to end war. The Weathermen (later called the Weather Underground) were the most famous (or infamous) of radical student groups who advocated violent revolution.\n\nThe militarization of the peace movement in the 1970s showed the dark side of the counterculture. Religious cults similarly showed the shadow side of the counterculture. For example, there was Jim Jones and his People’s Temple. Jones came out of the counterculture of the Bay area of northern California, and initially was quite progressive in his politics. However, Jones and his hardcore disciples later became paranoid and violent. In 1978, in a fit of insanity, Jones commanded all his followers at the People’s Temple – relocated to the jungles of Guyana (in South America) – to kill themselves, by drinking poisoned Kool-Aid. 909 people died at Jones’s command, at Jonestown.\n\nA third way the counterculture turned dark was in its excess. The experimentation in sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll of the 1960s turned into the rampant sexual promiscuity, drug abuse and addiction, and increasingly angry music of the 1970s. What was once a movement of lifestyle liberation became an orgy of overindulgence.\n\nIt is the violent radicalization of the once-peaceful peace movement, the corruption of once-progressive cults, and the culture of excess, that I want to focus on in this post, particularly in regards to Apocalypse Now. I will present Francis Ford Coppola’s critique of counterculture, circa 1979, (when the film was originally released).\n\nCountercultural Excess\n\nI will begin with excess, because the film begins with that. We see it in the very first scene of the film, with Captain Willard in the hotel room in Saigon. Willard is wasted on drugs – in this case booze – and in obvious torment, as he recalls his traumatic experiences in the Vietnam War, and smashes his reflection in the mirror. He has had an excess of war, and his answer is an excess of booze (I will go out on a limb and say that the spoon we see at 3:25 could be used by Willard to cook heroin. This is not that implausible, since we see Willard take opium, the pure form of heroin, in the French plantation scene).\n\nThe song from The Doors – “The End” – speaks to the idea of excess. JIm Morrison, the lead singer and song-writer for The Doors, was practically a poster child for excess. Hedonism was a constant theme in his songs (as was “the end,” or death), and he famously died of a drug overdose. He was also charged, at one point, with exposing his genitals while on stage during a concert. (At the end of the song you’ll hear Morrison repeatedly say the “f” word, and simulate the sound of someone having sex). “The End” sounds very much like what someone, exhausted by excess, would write.\n\nThe scene also represents this exhaustion visually, as WIllard trashes his hotel room and injures himself, all to escape the war playing out in his mind. This scene represents the counterculture in many ways, but only shows its dark side.\n\nThis presentation of excess continues in the first half of the film, as we see the personnel in the boat engage in various countercultural activities (taking LSD and smoking marijuana, having sex with Playboy Bunnies, listening to rock music on the radio), all to excess. You’ll remember that one of these songs on the soundtrack was “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction,” which describes pretty well the culture of excess, of taking and doing more and more to escape reality, but finding that reality can’t be avoided. The film suggests that the respective fates of the crew members (particularly Chef, and Clean) are linked to their excessive life-styles. Lance, the surfer, also engages in excess; he does not die in the film, but at the end of the film he certainly seems exhausted, if not mentally destroyed, by his overindulgence in drugs (LSD).\n\nThe Manson Family and Cults\n\nI will say more about the end of the film in a moment, but first I need to mention a seemingly minor detail in the film that illustrates the dark side of the counterculture. This is the moment in the film when Chef, on the boat, reads (and reads aloud) a newspaper story sent to him in the mail (this is at the 1:51 mark in the film).\n\nThe article he reads is about the Manson murders, which were perpetrated by members of a cult centered around the charismatic rock musician Charles Manson (the Manson Family), after taking the psychedelic drug LSD. Chef reads that these insane, bloody murders – which took the life of three people, including the actress Sharon Tate, wife of the renowned film director Roman Polanski – were done as a “protest.”\n\nThe importance of this brief moment is to set up what will come later, when Willard and Lance become part of another murderous cult, based on the idea of murder as protest, centered around Colonel Kurtz.\n\nColonel Kurtz’s Cult\n\nNo one would argue that Kurtz and his followers are not murderous: we see dead, bloody corpses scattered all about Kurtz’s temple compound. But it should be equally clear that they are cult-like. It’s suggested in the film that many of Kurtz’s disciples had been brain-washed, a regular accusation against cults. In fact, Kurtz tries to brain-wash Willard, though it seems he failed in that attempt (unless Kurtz was brainwashing WIllard to kill him). But, besides that, there are plenty of indications that Kurtz’s soldiers, and everyone at the compound (including many children), worship Kurtz with a religious-like devotion.\n\nI would like to look specifically at the moment when Willard and the remainder of the boat crew (Lance, Chef, and Willard) arrive at Kurtz’s temple compound. I mentioned in a previous post the awed silence of the people at the dock and on the shore (and in the water just off the shore). The first people we see at the compound are seemingly tribesmen, painted white, as if they were Cambodians (Kurtz’s compound is in Cambodia) playing at being Americans. If you look closely, however, you’ll notice that many of the tribesmen have Caucasian features. In that regard, they resemble westerners who joined the Hari Krishnas, a Hindu-based religious sect that had many American and European converts in the 1960s and 1970s, often accused of brainwashing and other cult-like practices.\n\nWhat I’m suggesting is that Coppola represents Kurtz and his followers as members of a murderous cult. I won’t go so far as to say that Coppola was specifically associating Kurtz with Jim Jones and the People’s Temple massacre in 1978, but Coppola does associate Kurtz with a counterculture that had become violent and cult-like.\n\nI’m not suggesting that Kurtz himself was a peacenik-turned-revolutionary, since his understanding and conduct of the Vietnam War was reactionary: he believed that the U.S. military establishment had been too weak, not violent enough, not willing to do what was necessary (such as cutting off the arms of immunized children) to win the war. In his mind, the soldiers and the war had been betrayed by a cowardly, pusillanimous military establishment, assisted by young, craven, student antiwar activists.\n\nHowever, Kurtz clearly casts a spell on people like the Photojournalist, who dresses and speaks (and takes drugs) like a member of the counterculture. The Photojournalist stands for all those hippies and war protesters in the 1960s who came to embrace radical cults and revolutionary violence in the 1970s.\n\nCoppola’s negative depiction of the American counterculture reflected the attitudes of many people in the United States in the 1970s, including those who had formerly been against the war and fervent participants in the counterculture. The sexual promiscuity, the abuse of drugs, and the disillusionment with government following the war and the Watergate scandal (1974), had turned much of the American populace against the counterculture. This influenced the presidential election of 1980 when, as mentioned above, Ronald Reagan defeated the dour, malaise-obsessed Jimmy Carter, and brought the conservative Reagan revolution to Washington, DC.\n\nThis conservative revolution continues today as Reagan’s Republican Party, particularly the “Tea Party” contingent, does its utmost to undo the liberal gains of the 1960s and 1970s. But the counterculture hasn’t been completely defeated or suppressed. Elements of it remain. The recent left-wing Occupy movement was built upon the legacy of the American counterculture. Anti-war protests today are “vaguely reminiscent of the 60s” in their re-evocation of the ideals of that era. We can expect to see the same cyclic patterns emerge in the future, as countercultural protest leads to radicalization, leading to a conservative backlash, leading to a liberal backlash against conservatism, leading to a new counterculture, etc.\n\nWe will have two other occasions to discuss the dark side of the American counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s in the second half of the semester, first in a European context (Jean-Luc Godard’s Weekend) and the second in an American context (Chicago 10).\n\nJoseph Byrne\n\nUniversity of Maryland\n\nOctober 2013\n\nSound in the Opening Montage\n\n“This is the end…” Actually, just the beginning, of Apocalypse Now.\n\nIn class, I showed the opening scene of the film but didn’t say much about it. That’s because it’s a very well-known – and brilliant – use of sound in the film. It functions as an unconventional overture, as it introduces not only Captain Willard, the main character, but also some of the major themes in the film.\n\nLet me focus on the song for a moment. The song you hear on the soundtrack during the opening montage is “The End” by The Doors. Why a song about the end at the beginning of the film? Because it indicates the end of Captain Willard’s illusions about the war, and the end of America’s illusions as well. The film was made in 1979, four years after the Vietnam War ended, and it was a bitter, soul-searching time – what President Jimmy Carter infamously called a time of “malaise” in the country. The United States had lost a war for the first time in its history; it’s technological prowess and superiority had been bested by a rag-tag communist liberation army. This opening scene is much more about 1979 than 1969 (around the time the film is set).\n\nIf the director Francis Ford Coppola had chosen a different song, even a different song by The Doors, the effect and the message would have been quite different. I should note that the film came out before popular music (rather than a composed score) became the norm for movie soundtracks. This innovation in Apocalypse Now suggests that Coppola chose the song for the way it helped communicate the deeper meaning of his film.\n\nIn your textbook, the authors write about the “use of sound to indicate character subjectivity” (236). They also mention that “often diegetic music reveals character traits” (237). All this is true of the use of the song at the beginning of Apocalypse Now. It takes us inside the boozy head of Willard in the hotel room. It reveals to us what Willard is thinking, in all it surreal contours.\n\nWe hear other sounds mediated through Willard’s subjectivity in this scene, such as the distorted sound of a ceiling fan, which turns into the distorted sound of helicopter blades – the ubiquitous sound we hear throughout the film, and throughout most Vietnam War films (Korean War films too, such as Robert Altman’s M.A.S.H.). These are sounds that Willard is hearing. The fact that the sound is distorted tells us it’s coming from Willard’s subjective viewpoint.\n\nSo, just as camera shots can be subjective (such as the shot of the reflection of the snow-globe at the beginning of Citizen Kane), so too can sounds.\n\nOne of the best ways to use sound to get into the head of characters is the voice-over. As you know, there is plenty of that in Apocalypse Now. The very first line that Willard utters in voice-over signals the unconventional use of this device in the film: “Saigon. Shit. . . . Still in Saigon.” In this one line, heard alongside the music of a marching band outside the window, Willard not only swears, but shows his utter revulsion in regards to the war, while at the same time showing that he can’t wait to get back to the jungle. Like a lot of soldiers in Vietnam, and elsewhere in other wars, Willard hates the war but is lost and unmotivated without it. It gives his life meaning.\n\nI think you would agree with me (and disagree with the script-writing guru Robert McKee [of Adaptation]) that, in Apocalypse Now, the voice-over is vital, not only for presenting vital information about character and plot, but for taking us inside the head of the lead character, revealing to us his subjective take on the insanity of war.\n\nAir Cavalry Scene\n\nThis is the famous scene where the cowboy-surfer Colonel Kilgore bombs a Vietnamese village “back to the Stone Age,” destroying a village in order to save it. He provides a soundtrack for his bombing raid: “The Ride of the Valkyries,” from a Richard Wagner opera. Your textbook authors explain:\n\nThe choice of music is an intertextual reference to [D. W. Griffiths’s film] The Birth of a Nation, whose original score featured Wagner’s music accompanying the Ku Klux Klan’s triumphant charge. Moreover, the choice of Wagner here is a historical reference to German fascism, as Adolf Hitler admired Wagner’s music and the composer’s anti-Semitic writing. (260).\n\nAs the textbook authors note, there is parallel sound editing in this scene, as the choppers blaring Wagner alternate with shots of a quiet village, where only the sound of children can be heard, and then a relatively soft alarm bell. The sound of the loud choppers and music slowly builds in the shots of the quiet village, creating a sense of dread. The textbook authors explain that\n\nThe abrupt movement from loud to soft shifts the audience’s identification, so that the excitement audiences might otherwise share with the soldiers onscreen gives way to empathy for the villagers. Sound editor Walter Murch’s manipulation of volume in this scene puts audiences in the position of the attacked, as well as the attacker. (260).\n\nThis split identification not only defines the audience’s experience, but also the experience of the war on the “home-front,” with the American populace nearly split on the justness of the Vietnam War.\n\nSound vs. Silence\n\nThe use of sound in this part of the film is also part of a larger sound design in the film, in which periods of quiet alternate with bombastic noise. Characters having to yell over the sound of shooting, bombing, and the cries of the wounded (and the sound of a priest saying mass during the raid, and the sound of a cow being lifted by a helicopter, etc.) – or use radio or megaphones – is not bad sound design. The noise is an inescapable part of modern, mechanized war. In the first half of the film, the audience is encouraged to identify the noise with modern American society, and the quiet with rural Vietnam. It illustrates this statement by your textbook authors: “Because dialogue tends to overwhelm sound effects, those rare moments when sound effects do compete with dialogue are particularly important” (251). In regards to sound in films, if it’s soft and hard to hear, it’s important. The quieter it is on the soundtrack, the harder you should listen.\n\nLet me illustrate the sound vs. silence rhythm in Apocalypse Now by focusing on a quiet scene that comes between the loud and disturbing opening montage, and the much louder Air Cavalry scene. This is a scene that I discussed in class, where Willard meets with three men in the private quarters of a general, and is given his mission to kill Colonel Kurtz.\n\nFirst, there’s the background music in the scene (which you really have to listen for). It’s what we would call “muzak,” or “easy-listening” music. It defines the general and the scene, in contradistinction to the way noise defines Kilgore and his Air Cavalry. It indicates that the general is genteel, and a little prissy – or, at the very least, old (at a time when hippies and activists in the counterculture were urging young people “not to trust anyone over 30”). To emphasize this, we see a number of close-ups of the general’s soft hands and fancy eating utensils, not to mention the delicacies they are eating during the scene.\n\nIn this scene, we also hear Col. Kurtz for the first time, on audio-tape. It’s significant that Kurtz is introduced in the film via sound. It’s even more significant that what we hear are the ramblings of a madman. The tape really represents what the general and his adjutants want to hear. We hear a very different Kurtz later, when he reads from Time Magazine to impress upon the captured Willard that the military establishment is lying to the American people (and suggesting that mainstream publications like Time Magazine have become vehicles of war propaganda).\n\nIt was the “silent partner” that I concentrated on when we discussed this scene in class. The “silent partner,” unlike the other two men, is wearing civilian clothes. He is most likely CIA. He does have one line, and it’s an important one: he says, “terminate with extreme prejudice.” What this basically means is: “do whatever you need to do to kill Kurtz.” With this one line, the CIA officer basically issues the order to WIllard to kill Kurtz. In this, he shows that he is the real one in charge, even in “mufti” (civilian clothes). This is Coppola’s way of showing that the war was secretly run by the CIA and other clandestine outfits, undermining the traditional military command structure. Coppola does this by using soft sounds in the aural mise-en-scène. Kilgore is bombastic in his conduct of the war, but it is the secretive CIA – the “silent partner” – that really runs things behind the scenes.\n\nSilence in the Temple of Horror\n\nMuch more could be said about sound in Apocalypse Now, particularly the music on the soundtrack used to define different characters and different scenes. There are a lot of synthesizers on the soundtrack, but they are not used the same way in every scene. The music soundtrack, instead, varies the music for different scenes. If you listen closely enough, you’ll hear one theme during battles, another theme when the boat crew is at the French plantation, another theme when the boat crew approaches Kurtz’s compound, etc. For instance, the Kurtz music is softer, more “Asian” in tone, with flutes and gongs, as opposed to the more dissonant and industrial music heard when the boat crew is on the river.\n\nI also have to point out the brilliant and devastating use of sound in the scene where Clean dies. You’ll remember that when Clean was shot he was listening a recording tape sent to him by his mother, and it continues on the soundtrack as the crew on the boat deal with Clean’s death (with the exception of Lance, who is more concerned with the missing puppy). We hear his mother say, basically, don’t get shot and come back to us in one piece, while the dead, shot Clean lies on the deck of the boat.\n\nFor the rest of this entry I would like to focus on the use of silence in the second half of the film.\n\nThe first half of Apocalypse Now is much louder than the second, since the first half is set in war-zones and much of the second half is set in Kurtz’s compound in the Buddhist temple. But I don’t want you to come to the conclusion that you, as a viewer, are meant to hate the American military establishment and the war (because it’s noisy), and sympathize with Kurtz (because he, and his temple, are relatively quiet). Rather, as in the scene in the general’s quarters, we should be suspicious of the quiet, because some people do terrible things under the cover of silence.\n\nCase in point, Colonel Kurtz. Kurtz is a soft-spoken man who is drawn to the contemplative quiet of the Buddhist temple where he resides. There he can read his poetry (mostly T. S. Eliot) in peace. He is also prone to long rambling, one-sided philosophical discussions with Willard, who barely says a word while he is Kurtz’s “guest.”\n\nThe nameless photojournalist, played by Dennis Hopper (“Jordy” Jr. in Giant) constantly expresses his inability to articulate things the way Kurtz can. “I wish I had the words…” he says at one point. But inarticulation is also one of Kurtz’s preoccupations. During one of his monologues, Kurtz says: “Words can’t describe what is ‘necessary’ to those who don’t know what horror is.”\n\nKurtz knows what horror is, and he knows it can’t be suppressed by silence. In fact, the horror whispers in the shadows of the compound. For instance, often times on the soundtrack you can hear flies buzzing. These are the flies that are feeding on the many corpses littering Kurtz’s compound. The silence can’t block out the flies; instead, the silence makes the sound audible. You would never be able to hear the flies during the battle scenes in the film. Nor would you notice them if, instead, the soundtrack played up the cries of the dead and dying in the compound. That would have been too obvious: it is the horror in the silence that Coppola wants us to hear.\n\nEventually we come to realize that the quiet in the Buddhist temple is anything but peaceful. It is part of Kurtz’s insane tyranny: he commands it. That’s why the people are so quiet there. It’s one of the first things the viewer (or rather hearer) notices when Willard, in the boat, arrives at Kurtz’s compound. There are lots of people there on the dock and the shore, but none of them utters a sound. In fact, they scatter when the quiet is disturbed by the boat’s siren. They’re inarticulate because they are not allowed to speak.\n\nSimilarly, when Willard finally kills Kurtz, and exits the temple, he is greeted by a large, utterly silent, crowd. Willard is the new chief, the new tyrant. Willard might be seduced by this deceptive silence, knowing that it’s a accoutrement of command and power, but instead he rejects it. He will instead return to the noisy, messy world.\n\nApocalypse Now ends with Kurtz’s dying words: “the horror, the horror.” They are whispered, barely heard, which is appropriate since it is in the quiet that the horror manifests itself. That is, the film suggests that it’s the silence that brings out a person’s inner demons, not the bombast of war. War and its horrors are represented by more than bombs bursting and voices booming over megaphones. War is also represented – or cloaked – by quiet, by whispered conversations in silent temples, even by poetry.\n\nIn the end, that’s what the Vietnam War means to Coppola; it has infiltrated, even colonized, the silent interstices of the mind. Never again will war be known only by the sounds of explosions. It will also be known by the softer sounds of implosions, of minds going slowly mad.\n\nJoseph Byrne\n\nUniversity of Maryland\n\nOctober 2013"
