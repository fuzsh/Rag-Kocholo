        "text": "You must remember this: at the end of Casablanca, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart, of course) makes the hard choice, the right choice, in the fight for love and glory. He emerges from his lovelorn cynicism—“I stick my neck out for nobody!”—and chooses to become one of the good guys. He sacrifices his burning love for Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) to a higher cause, saves the heroic Resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), and sends the couple flying off into the night sky. A clear-eyed Rick then turns to the now-former French police captain, Louis Renault (Claude Rains), who has just tossed aside his own self-serving past as what he calls “a poor, corrupt official” on behalf of France’s collaborationist Vichy government. “Louis,” says Rick, as they walk into the fog, “I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.” With Louis’s help, Rick is off to join the Free French forces and the fight against the Nazis. It is one the most uplifting and romantic film endings of all time.\n\nIt’s also one of the more historically deceptive. When the movie had its premiere—75 years ago, on November 26, 1942—America was ostensibly marching shoulder to shoulder with Rick and the Free French. Two weeks earlier, U.S. troops had stormed the beaches of North Africa and captured the real Casablanca. The coastal Moroccan city would serve as a way station and springboard in the coming war to liberate the rest of North Africa and Europe from the likes of the viperish Nazi, Major Heinrich Strasser (Conrad Veidt), and the French secret police that Louis once headed. Or so moviegoers might have assumed after seeing Casablanca. The reality was not so straightforward.\n\nThe United States had been cooperating for almost two years with France’s Vichy government, which came to power after France fell to Germany in June 1940. That government, named for the city in southern France where it set up its capital, was headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain, an elderly, beaten-down World War I hero. The Vichy regime desperately sought to retain some measure of French autonomy, but the Nazis called the shots. Vichy officials fulfilled Nazi demands for slave labor, weapons, matériel, and food. Vichy’s police squads tightened the screws on Resistance forces, turning over many members for torture and death at the hands of the Gestapo. The Vichy government eventually carried out mass deportations of Jews to the death camps.\n\nThe American president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, turned a blind eye to much of this. Up until the day of the North African invasion, the U.S. maintained diplomatic relations with Vichy, and kept ambassadors in metropolitan France and consular officials in its North African colonies. The U.S. shipped food, oil, and other commodities to the North African colonies, easing shortages caused by the Germany requisition of French stocks. At the same time, F.D.R. openly distrusted General Charles de Gaulle, exiled in London, whom he considered a self-righteous would-be Joan of Arc. The U.S. refused to recognize or offer encouragement to his Free French forces, despite Winston Churchill’s strong backing for de Gaulle.\n\nBy aiding Vichy, Roosevelt wanted to avail himself of a window on what was happening in France—and he sent the first operatives from the new Office of Strategic Services (precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency) to North Africa to do just that. He was also gambling that, on the day when American forces made their way onto French territory to drive the Germans out, they would find a hospitable welcome. It proved to be a losing bet.\n\nThe action of Casablanca plays out against a backdrop of intrigue. As the movie’s map-opener and newsreel-style narrator explains, Casablanca was a tense home for exiles from Europe (among them the expatriate entertainer Josephine Baker), and a jumping-off point for political refugees fleeing the war. In Casablanca, the desperate Ilsa and Laszlo and others sought out Rick, believing he could grease the wheels of the black market and obtain invaluable transit visas from Vichy authorities. No actual establishment with a name like “Rick’s Café Americain,” where people from all sides crossed paths, would have been permitted to remain in business had the U.S. broken with Vichy.\n\nWhen the real Marshal Pétain learned of the Allied invasion—on November 8—of Vichy’s North African colonies, he was incensed and not about to welcome his nation’s would-be liberators. He declared, “We are attacked. We shall defend ourselves.” He ordered his armed forces to drive off the Americans. Only when General George S. Patton’s troops surrounded Casablanca and threatened to level the city did French forces surrender.\n\nWhat happened next reveals how deeply tone-deaf American policy toward France remained. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the commander of Allied forces, took the advice of U.S. diplomats and put Admiral François Darlan—a one-time Vichy prime minister and still the commander of France’s navy—in charge. As Vichy’s prime minister, Darlan had met with Hitler and overseen some of Vichy’s ugliest repressive measures. He personally called for de Gaulle’s head. State Department officials, who were cozy with the Vichy leaders, assured Eisenhower that Darlan would now swing French guns around to shoot at Germans.\n\nDarlan was a self-serving political animal. As the civil head of “liberated” French North Africa, he kept in place Vichy’s harsh administrative regime and its secret police; he even refused to release imprisoned anti-Vichy resisters, and retained repressive laws against Jews. For all intents and purposes, the invasion had simply replaced Nazi overlords with American ones, while keeping the Vichy regime intact.\n\nThe backlash against what the Americans had done was intense. Churchill told Roosevelt that putting Darlan in charge “overlook(s) the serious political damage which may be done to our cause.” Darlan, he said, “has an odious record . . . [and] now for the sake of power and office [he] plays turncoat.” In the press, American commentators asked whether the same Allies who installed Darlan to rule the French in Casablanca might next put Hitler’s deputy, Hermann Göring, in charge when they occupied Germany. In North Africa, graffiti splashed on walls called for “Death to the Traitor Darlan.” Civil war was a serious possibility.\n\nF.D.R. quickly recognized his mistake and declared the “Darlan Deal” to be a “temporary expedient.” Darlan knew his days were numbered. “I am only a lemon which the Americans will drop after they have squeezed it dry,” he wrote to an American general. On Christmas Eve, 1942, Darlan was assassinated by a young Resistance fighter, probably with American and British consent and, perhaps, their connivance. One relieved American commander later termed Darlan’s death “an act of providence” and likened it to the “lancing of a troublesome boil.”\n\nWhen the federal Office of War Information had approved the movie’s original screenplay—a must under wartime censorship rules—in December 1941, the federal reviewers were reportedly uneasy with its negative depiction of Vichy as corrupt and repressive. This was a government, after all, that we had dealings with. Ultimately, though, the censors gave it a pass. After Casablanca premiered to huge acclaim, Warner Bros. studio chief Harry Warner implied that the movie was more than mere Hollywood entertainment; it was a contribution to the nation’s war effort: “helping in its definite way to interpret the action for you, to explain Vichy France to you.” At one point, Warner even considered shooting a new ending for the movie, with Rick and Louis on board a U.S. ship standing off Casablanca, about to invade North Africa. He never did, maybe coming to understand that he’d regret it—“maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.”"
