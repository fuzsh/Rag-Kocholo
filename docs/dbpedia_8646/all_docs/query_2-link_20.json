        "text": "Even though the armed forces might be said to have taken some of the play away from them, Warner Brothers have gone right ahead and released a film called “Casablanca.” They may feel that General Eisenhower has merely served them well as an advance agent. The Casablanca on the screen is the old Casablanca of three or four weeks ago, and much of the heavy intrigue indulged in by Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, and Paul Henreid has presumably been cleaned up by the army of occupation by now, but there is probably enough topical truth left in the picture to suit the topical-minded. Not to speak of the eternal truths always to be found in the better screen plays.\n\nThe centre of intrigue in old Casablanca, we learn, was Rick’s, a night spot where forged passports flowed like water. Into this dive, operated by Bogart, come Henreid, as the leader of an underground movement in Europe, and Miss Bergman, as Europe’s most beautiful woman. Henreid has escaped from a concentration camp and is trying to get to America. The Germans would like to stop him by fair means or unwholesome. Claude Rains, as the local police chief, sits cheerfully on the fence and won’t do much for anybody. Bogart and Miss Bergman have met before in Paris, it turns out, and they become particularly melancholy whenever the song “As Time Goes By” is played. It’s as good a tune as any to attach sentiment to, and a good one to attach to this picture, which, although not quite up to “Across the Pacific,” Bogart’s last spyfest, is nevertheless pretty tolerable and deserves attractive accessories.\n\nThe early life of James J. Corbett, known as “Gentleman Jim,” is unfolded in a film also known as “Gentleman Jim.” The usual justifiable liberties have been taken with the hero’s actual saga—his family has been trimmed down a bit, his marriages have been divided by three, and his fights have been somewhat supercharged in regard to number of knockdowns per minute. His most prominent opponent, Sullivan, furthermore, is made something of a sap of, fistically speaking, but that’s always the fate of a man who’s just playing the part of the other fellow. The main thing is that the boxing scenes, of which there are many, reach a new technical high. Errol Flynn, as Corbett, is fast and elusive and looks as though he might really be able to lick somebody. There are several closeups of the champ’s footwork, and for these it is conceivable that someone else’s feet were hired, but in the action shots of the complete Flynn he is no pugilistic slouch. For those to whom ringside seats are not enough, the picture has a good deal of period furniture, costumes, and hair styles, and a sizable cast composed in part of Alan Hale, Alexis Smith, William Frawley, John Loder, and Rhys Williams.\n\nIn addition to pugilism and international intrigue, witchcraft is also examined currently. More impassioned students of Thorne Smith than this one will probably know how much of the dialogue in “I Married a Witch” can be attributed to whatever book of his the movie was taken from, and how much to screenwriters Robert Pirosh and Marc Connelly. Some of it is worth attributing to somebody. There’s the line, for instance, delivered by Veronica Lake, a witch descended from witches, who is trying to show how long her family has been making a nuisance of itself. “Have you heard of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire?” she asks. As for the plot, it’s simply about a man who marries a witch. Besides Miss Lake, there are Fredric March, Robert Benchley, and Cecil Kellaway in it, all doing well.\n\n“White Cargo,” which has been on both the stage and the screen before, is suffering, in its latest film version, from the same complaint as ever. There’s still the native girl, Tondeleyo. This time Hedy Lamarr has the part and is just as unable to keep from sounding foolish as her forerunners were. . . . In spite of Fred Astaire and Adolphe Menjou and a score by J. Kern, “You Were Never Lovelier” is no dream. Menjou is dreaming, though, when he says in it that young Lochinvar’s horse was white. It was said to be fleet and the best through all the wide border, but its color wasn’t mentioned. ♦"
