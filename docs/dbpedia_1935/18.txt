I am only one, but still I am one. I cannot do everything, but still I can do something, and because I cannot do everything I will not refuse to do something that I can do.

I'm a native of Los Angeles, a graduate of University of Maryland College Park, and current nursing school student at Columbia University. Learn more about me by clicking below!
