Gewirtz College Park’s libraries face new chal- lenges and opportunities in a burgeoning age of information. The library isn't a place anymore, but a many-tiered system responding to the diverse needs of a research university. DEPARTMENTS 2 FIRST WORD by Steve M.

IN THE PRIME OF THEIR LIVES by Lisa Gregory Older students, enriched by their experiences on campus, have much to contribute in turn to others. RESTORING MARYLAND’S ANCESTRAL HOME by Brian Busek In England, architecture students are working on— and learning from— historic Kiplin Hall. CO cc hose of us in academic life know that libraries are vitally important to the central missions of a university. For this issue of College Park, we asked reporter Adina Gewirtz to ex- plore the multifaceted campus li- brary system to give you a sense of what our libraries do and why they're more important than ever. Her story, \"A New World of Knowl- edge,\" offers a look at how far to- day's research libraries at College Park have come from the sim- pler era of the card catalog. For every university, the quality of its library is an enduring measure of excellence. College Park's libraries contain outstand- ing resources, ranging from the International Piano Archives at Maryland, one of the world's most extensive collections of piano recordings and related archival materials, to the Technical Re- ports Center, a collection of 1.3 million reports based on govern- ment-funded research; from the Gordon W. Prange Collection of Japanese language publications in the years immediately follow- ing World War II to the Maryland Room, a center for Maryland studies that includes maps, state documents, historical manu- scripts and the library and morgue of the Baltimore News American. Spurred by technological advances in information processing and retrieval, libraries everywhere are changing dramatically and are facing unprecedented challenges. At Maryland, these are ex- citing times: The library system will soon mark the acquisition of its two millionth volume; a $13 million, seven-story addition to McKeldin Library will provide critically needed study and stack space for the main graduate library facility on campus; a new national archives building, Archives II, is being constructed on a site near the university's golf course. It will house 5 million pho- tographs, 110,000 films and 11 million oversized documents such as maps and charts. Building a great academic research library, though, is a task that takes decades. College Park's immediate priorities are to strengthen the libraries' holdings of current scholarly publica- tions in all available formats and to achieve new levels of excel- lence in four specialized areas: the Engineering and Physical Sci- ences Library; the National Trust for Historic Preservation Library; the International Piano Archives at Maryland, and the Maryland-related collections. We all have a stake in the continued growth of College Park's libraries. As Gewirtz reports in her cover story, libraries may not have alumni, but without libraries, there would be no one to graduate. W a w I —Steve M. Barkin Editor o u ABOUT THE COVER: 1.

You have done an absolutely outstanding job in creating such a diverse and colorful publi- cation. It certainly is a much better represen- tation of our university than the mediocre newsletters of the past. As one who often felt to be in the minority of Maryland graduates who had any sense of pride in my school, it is refreshing to see a major rebirth of the University of Maryland, and your magazine radiates this new energy and excitement. Michael Grembowicz '84 Glendale, Calif. Hebrew University Lookout As director of the American Alumni Associ- ation of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, I am trying to locate men and women in the United States who attended Hebrew University. There are many University of Maryland alumni who took part in one of the university's Overseas Students Programs, and we would appreciate any help in locating them. Our office is located at 11 E. 69th St., New York, N.Y. 10021. Betsy Silverfine Neiv York, N.Y. Handsome Publication College Park is a handsome publication, highlighting not only the history of the campus, but also its contributions to teaching, research and service. I wish you luck in this undertaking. Shaila R. Aery Secretary of Higher Education Annapolis, Md. Alumni Officers Congratulations! The new College Park magazine is an excellent product. It should be a great stimulant to increased attention from alumni. I read the magazine “cover to cover\" with great interest. On the inside cover, I noted the listing of the new officers of the Alumni Associ- ation. How, when and where were these individuals elected? I had not heard of any meeting of the new College Park Alumni Association. Thanks and best wishes for continued success. Harry E. Hasslinger '33 Past President, University of Maryland Alumni Association (1962-63) The officers of the new alumni association were appointed for their first terms by University President William E. Kirwan at the association's charter meeting on Sept. 22, 1989. Starting in July 199U, officers will be nominated and elected by the alumni. Congratulations Congratulations on the first issue of College Park. It's spectacular! It is interesting and attractive. More impor- tantly, from my perspective, it helps spread the word about all the good things happening on campus. That's a big help to those of us working for College Park's interests in Annapolis. Keep up the good work. fames C. Rosapepe Delegate, Maryland General Assembly (Prince George's County) Annapolis, Md. Giving Alumni an Overview I have just finished reading the first edition of College Park. It is a terrific publication. 1 am sure this will go a long way toward helping to tie the entire College Park alumni together and give the alumni a good overview of what is happening at the University of Maryland at College Park. I am very pleased with all the developments of the new alumni association at College Park. fames A. Calderwood ’64 Washington, D.C. Pursuing Key Scholarship Our son is a high school senior who is currently a National Merit Semi-Finalist. He is being recruited by several major universities that want to attract top students. We are proud to be graduates of the University of Maryland at College Park, and our son will be pursuing a Francis Scott Kev Scholarship to attend Maryland. Stephen L. Miller 70 Carolee Brophy Miller 70 Metairie, La. Campus Landmarks 1 am glad to see College Park, the new alumni magazine. 1 am one of the older living alumni— class of 1920 from Maryland State College, changed to the University of Maryland in 1921. But there is a mistake on page 11. Morrill Hall is not the oldest building on campus. That is the Rossborough Inn, built as a tavern well before 1898. Tlieo Bissell '20 Silver Sirring, Md. BILL WEEMS The Rossborough was built in 1798, and is the oldest building located on campus. Our story should have pointed out that Morrill Hall is the oldest existing building that was built as part of the university. 3 A Continued from page 3 Bravo, Maryland As graduates of the University of Maryland who had long lived away from Maryland, we had come to the conclusion that the university was quick to forget past graduates. This has been further magnified by the aggressive way the University of Texas courts its past graduates. Therefore, it was a wonderfully rewarding experience to receive the brilliant College Park magazine. It really helps to bring the university home to those of us who live far away. We say Bravo, Maryland. Finally, a publi- cation out-of-state (and in-state, we are sure) graduates can be proud of. David E. Garlock 73 Susan E. Garlock 74 Austin, Texas Good Work Congratulations on your first edition of College Park. It is truly an outstanding publi- cation. I enjoyed all aspects, especially the well- written article on Coach Gary Williams and the informative interview with Leonard Raley. 1 look forward to subsequent quality editions. Keep up the good work. Erwin S. Raffel, B.S. '56, D.D.S. '61 Lyndhurst, Ohio Women’s Sports Why did you leave the women's basketball schedule out of your calendar? You list men's, suggesting an alternate. Aubrey Williams Professor of Anthropology College Park At the time we went to press, the women's basketball schedule had not been compiled. In this issue, check page 24 for the women's lacrosse schedule. The Pace of our Progress This past November, Governor William Donald Schaefer in- vited me to join him on an international trade mission to the Middle East. One of our stops was Saudi Arabia. When our plane landed at the magnificent airport in Riyadh, we were ushered into a plush visitor's lounge and greeted by the Deputy Governor of the State of Riyadh. He announced to the 20 mem- bers of Governor Schaefer's team that he was especially pleased to welcome us because he was a 1964 graduate of \"that great ^President”1 * university at College Park.\" You can imagine the pride I felt at University of Maryland at College Park ^at moment. The story was much the same at our other stops in Israel and Egypt. Everywhere we went eyes lit up when our hosts learned that a representative of the University of Maryland was a member of the delegation. There can be no doubt that our university is recognized widely as one of the world's fine institutions of higher education. When you consider that we only became a university in 1920, it is remarkable how much we have achieved in just 70 years. So much of our success is due to you— the alumni and friends of the university— through your identification with the institution and your generous support of its programs. Proud though we are of this campus, it is exciting to think that in the 1990s we have an opportunity to move from the ranks of the very good to the small handful of the nation's very best universities. Not many universities can realistically hold such dreams. We can. The recent legislation creating the new eleven-campus University of Maryland System stip- ulated that College Park should be the state's flagship campus, \". . . with programs and faculty nationally and internationally recognized for excellence in research and the advance- ment of knowledge . . . with operating funding and facilities necessary to place it among the upper echelon of its peer institutions.\" These are not just idle words. This passage is now part of the laws of Maryland. Governor Schaefer and the General Assembly asked us to prepare an enhancement plan to guide our development over the coming years. The campus has responded with a thought- ful document that sets forth our plans and aspirations and stipulates specific targets by which we can measure our progress. The plan calls for an investment of $100 million of state funds over the next five years to be matched by $50 million of institutionally generated funds. But even as we await funding for the Enhancement Plan, the pace of our progress is impressive. This fall the average SAT score of our entering class was 1084, the highest on record and 100 points higher than the average score a decade ago. Our faculty continue to win the most prestigious awards and prizes. In fact, we rank among the ten leading public institutions in the number of prestigious faculty awards over the past five years. In the first issue of College Park, you may have read about the federal government's decision to build the National Archives II on our campus. This will enrich our programs in govern- ment and politics, history and public policy. An integral part of our plans for the advancement of the institution is our Campaign for Maryland, a $100 million private gift fund raising drive. Funds in this campaign are targeted for merit scholarships, endowed chairs, the library and other vital components of a great university. 1 am pleased to report that because of your response to the campaign, we have raised already more than two-thirds of our $100 million goal. These are heady days at College Park. It is a privilege to be president of the university at this time. As I conclude my first year in office, 1 look forward with great anticipation to the coming years and my continuing association with you— the alumni and friends of the Uni- versity of Maryland at College Park— and to the fulfillment of our shared ambitions for our university. JOHN T CONSOLI o LU > CE C f) Traver Named National Artist Music professor Paul Traver has received the National Artist Award of the Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi . It was presented during ceremonies at the society's triennial convention in Salt Lake City. The founding director of the Maryland Chorus and the Maryland Handel Festival, and a found- ing member of the American Handel Society, Traver is only the third recipient of the award. He will retain the title of National Artist for three years until the society's next national meeting. Traver was praised for his enrichment of the musical knowledge and enjoyment of thousands of students and music lovers through both his classroom teaching and performances of the Maryland Chorus and other conducting appear- ances. In early June the Maryland Chamber Singers will perform in Halle, East Germany, at the an- nual Handel Festival. Later in the month the Chamber Singers and the Maryland Chorus will appear in concert in Brussels and two other Bel- gian cities as part of the Flanders Festival. Disney Acquires Henson’s Family of Muppets Walt Disney Co. announced in August that it would buy Henson Associates, the New York company that owns the Muppets and other char- acters created by Jim Henson, a 1960 College Park graduate. Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear and other Muppets will appear in Disnev-produced movies and television programs and will be fea- Paul Traver was praised for his teaching and conducting. tured at the entertainment company's amuse- ment parks. It will be the first time Disney has marketed characters other than those it created itself or developed from outside literary sources. Henson began making puppets as a child in Prince George's County and while a student at College Park, where he started out majoring in scenic design for theatre and advertising. \"The puppet thing was just something 1 wanted to do on the side,” he says. \"But then I got involved in costume design, switched to home economics and asked a classmate, Jane Ne- bel (now Jane Henson) to join me doing a puppet show.\" The two got their start in television in the mid- 1950s at Washington's WRC-TV with a five-min- ute children's show called \"Sam and Friends” that featured a frog character named Kermit. Henson called his characters Muppets (a combination of marionette and puppet). The Henson-created characters that ap- pear on the public television series \"Se- same Street,\" with the exception of Ker- mit, are not affected bv the deal with Disney. Those characters, which in- clude Big Bird, Grover, Bert and Ernie, and Cookie Monster, belong to the nonprofit Children's Television Workshop. Henson will continue to produce segments for the program. Mickey, meet Kermit: Henson and his troupe m Jean Dresden Grambs, o 1919-1989 «8 Friends, colleagues and former students of Jean Dresden Grambs, professor emerita of 5 human development, will be saddened to learn lu of her death Sept. 30, three days before she was z to be honored as the 1989 Outstanding Woman of the Year (see College Pork, Fall 1989). The Outstanding Woman Convocation was held as a celebration of her life and accomplishments. In his convocation address, which focused on steps taken to improve the status of women at College Park, President William E. Kirwan said, \"It is [a] bitter and sad irony that on the very day we gather as planned to celebrate Jean Grambs' lifelong accomplishments, we must also mourn her recent tragic death. We can take some comfort in knowing that Jean left our community fully aware of the very high regard in which she was held.\" A memorial scholarship fund for graduate women working in her field is being established by the College of Education. J°Hty y A Theatre for Learning A gift of nearly $900,000 from AT&T is supporting development of a state-of- the-art teaching theatre that will em- ploy extensive computer, video and audio tele- communications equipment. The facility, sched- uled to he available in fall 1990, will be located in the Engineering Classroom Building. It is designed to enhance learning and teaching and will be available for use by faculty members interested in applying new communications technologies in their teaching. The tiered classroom will have 20 work station desks, each seating two students. Each desk will hold a built-in, high-performance computer. The teaching theatre itself will be have two large, rear-projection screens, slide and overhead pro- jectors, and white boards and will be equipped for super VHS, compact disks, video disks, au- dio cassettes and tapes, cable and over-the-air television and satellite hookups. The first classroom of its kind at College Park, the high tech facility is intended to be the pro- totype for others like it that will be installed at various campus sites in the future. Nemes Receives Presidents’ Medal Kirwan’s Inauguration Set The university is planning a major celebration during the last week in April— and alumni are invited to participate in the special events. On Monday, April 30, the inauguration of Col- lege Park President William E. Kirwan will take place beginning at 2 p.m. in Tawes Theatre. The inaugural ceremony will be the capstone event in a five-day community-wide celebration com- mencing on Thursday, April 26. Inaugural events will include a student arts festival on the mall, lectures by distinguished speakers, and an inaugural concert highlighting the talents of College Park music faculty. The grand finale will be a public reception immedi- ately following the inauguration in the Grand Ballroom of the Adele H. Stamp Student Union. Many dignitaries are expected to attend the inauguration ceremony, to which alumni are es- pecially invited. The ceremony will signify the formal investi- ture of William E. Kirwan as College Park's Graciela P Nemes, whose years at College Park as a student, teacher and now professor emerita of Spanish and Portuguese languages and literatures span nearly half a century, became the first woman to receive the President's Medal. The award was presented during the sixth annual Faculty and Associate Staff Convocation last October Originally known as the Chancellor's Medal, the award was created by former Chancellor John B. Slaughter in 1985, It is the highest honor the campus confers on a member of its community for outstanding service. Nemes began her long and productive career at College Park in 1947 as a graduate student in Spanish studies. Five years later she earned her Ph.D. Her student days also introduced her to the person who would dominate her intellectual life. Juan Ramon Jimenez, internationally recognized poet and expatriate of Franco's Spain, was teaching at Maryland when Nemes began her studies here. Jimenez made an impression on the young scholar that has lasted a lifetime and, since joining the College Park faculty, she has championed the poet throughout her academic career. Her first initiative on his behalf was perhaps the fourth chief executive officer. Formerly the vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost at the university, Kirwan became president of the state's flagship university on Feb. 3, 1989, after serving as acting president since Aug. 1, 1988. Journalism College Opens News Bureau The College of Journalism, as part of its five- year plan to create a model professional school, has opened a student reporting bureau in down- town Annapolis. \"Capital News Service,\" with former Washington Times metro editor Vanessa Gallman as full-time director and on-site editor, began operation during the fall semester. This spring semester, a pilot program has more than a dozen students developing story ideas while covering government agencies and offices, and public affairs issues. Their stories are sent from the bureau to participating daily and weekly newspapers throughout the region. According to Reese Cleghorn, dean of the Col- lege of Journalism, plans call for eventually open- ing a second reporting bureau in downtown Washington, D.C., making Maryland the only university in the country with two capital stu- dent news services. Ten editors and publishers from newspapers in the Maryland, Delaware and D.C. area have agreed to serve as advisers on the bureau's Press Council. Among them are journalism graduates Denise Perry, editor of the Easton (Md.) Star- Democrat, and Jim Pokrandt Jr., publisher of the Cambridge (Md.) Banner. most significant. In 1956. she persuaded the languages department to nominate Jimenez for the Nobel Prize in Literature, which he was awarded that year. A year later she published The Life and Works of Juan Ramon Jimenez, her first biography of the poet. In 1974, she reissued the biography in an expanded two-volume edition now considered the definitive work on Jimenez. During 1981, the centennial year of his birth, Nemes found a lasting way to commemorate the poet at College Park. At her urging, campus officials dedicated the then Foreign Languages Building in his honor and since then Juan Ramon Jimenez Hall has been the home of the foreign language programs. A New Vice President In a few weeks, College Park will be welcom- ing a new vice president. When she arrives, she will be the highest ranking woman administrator at the university. President William E. Kirwan has named Kath- ryn R. Costello as new vice president for insti- tutional advancement. When she joins the pres- ident's cabinet on April 2, she will be one of four vice presidents and also will become a senior officer in the University of Maryland Foundation, the non-profit foundation established to support the university. She replaces Dr. A.H. Edwards, who resigned to take a similar position at the University of Arkansas. Costello comes to the university from Texas, where she gained a national reputation for her ability to manage major fund raising campaigns and build top-notch advancement programs. She has been vice president for public affairs at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Cen- ter at Dallas since 1986. As College Park's chief advancement officer, she will oversee the Offices of Alumni Programs, Creative Services, Development, Public Infor- mation and Special Events. African-American Culture in Contemporary Society Samuel L. Myers, Jr., director of the Afro-American Studies Program, has long been interested in helping minorities learn the skills of policy analysis to apply to their own communities and in helping non-minorities understand the cultural and historical roots of contemporary public-policy problems confronting minority communities. Two recent efforts underscore this interest: a newlv revised concentration within the Afro-American Studies major in public policy analysis and the Post-Doctoral Program in Public Policy and the Black Community. Both efforts attempt to create, at different educational levels, a public policy analysis regimen that combines historical and cultural studies with economics, statistics and computer appli- cations. \"The complexity of problems facing the black community requires a more sophisticated approach to problem-solving,\" he says. \"We want to provide an education that is intellectually challenging and vocationally relevant.\" In addition to his administrative duties, Myers has delivered several papers on the effects of black male labor force withdrawal on family structure and racial earnings inequality. He also co-authored \"Crime and Administration of Criminal Justice,\" chapter seven of the recent National Research Council study, A Common Destiny: Blacks and American Society. M University Announces Plan To Appeal NCAA Sanctions aryland President William E. Kirwan responded to NCAA sanctions against the men's basketball program by announcing on March 5 that the university would appeal some of the penalties. The sanctions include: • A ban from postseason play in the 1990-91 and 1991-92 seasons. • No live telecast of team games during the 1990-91 season. • Return of more than $400,000 received from the team's participation in the 1988 NCAA Tournament. • A three-year probation period. Kirwan said that the university \"deeply regrets and is embarrassed by its violations,\" but added that \"the sanctions imposed are more severe than our infractions warrant.\" At a news conference, he said the precise nature of the appeal would be determined within the 15-day period permitted under NCAA rules. Recent Graduates Pleased With College Park A survey of graduates who earned their bachelor’s degrees in fall 1986 or spring 1987 has found that more than two-thirds (68 percent), if they were to do it over again, would attend College Park for their under- graduate education. Sixty-five percent indicated they would major In the same field and 59 percent of those employed full-time rated their job preparation as either good or excellent. The survey was mailed to 5,400 alumni whose ad- dresses were available. 2,410 responded. The survey asked respondents to evaluate their educational ex- periences while earning their degrees, plans for fur- thering their education, employment status and teacher certification status. Other survey highlights: • 55 percent reported receiving one or more types of financial aid. • 81 percent planned to earn a higher degree or graduate certificate. • 68 percent who re-enrolled in a college, university, graduate or professional school rated their preparation for advanced study as good or excellent. • 82 percent were employed full-time with a median annual salary of $21,000 to $23,000 for women and $24,000 to $26,999 for men. • 90 percent rated their satisfaction with the M Libraries as good or excellent. MR 7 College Park's libraries faee the demands and opportunities of an information age By Adina R. Gcwirtz I n a cluttered back room at the University of Maryland's College Park campus, a shining black piano stands before an audience of empty chairs. No one sits on the smooth lacquer of its bench, no one touches the polished white of its keys. But in a flash of motion and sound, it begins to play. Guided by invisible fingers, the keys jump and roll, and a piano solo echoes through the empty room. Or nearly empty. Beside the wall, a man sits at a computer terminal, enjoying the perfor- mance he has just commanded the Boesendorfer computerized piano to play. A few moments before, the screen of the IBM computer that directs the piano had blinked on as Neil Ratliff asked it for a favorite piece. \"CD\\Artist2,\" he typed. And then, ''Play.'' The room remained silent for a moment, until a trill of the piano keys filled it with fast-paced, urgent music. In the empty air over the dancing ivories, the ghost of a musician was palpably there. This is the roll-playing piano room at the Music Library, part of the International Piano Archives, one of the vast special col- lections in College Park's library system. The black piano is a recorder piano, the grandchild of the older instruments in the room, which can play back most of the 8,000 paper rolls shelved in the Music Library. Professional pianists, and students, come here to record their performances, then sit back and listen to them from the audience. With the computer capabilities, a stu- dent pianist can even edit the performance and play it again. This time, Ratliff, head of the Music Library, does not call for an encore. Instead, he sits back in his chair and grins. ' That's why we're full of surprises,\" he savs. PHOTOGRAPHY BY JOHN T. CONSOLI 9 fl! WORLD s KNOWLEDGE Wc arc undergoing evolution — not revolution.' The piano, the computer and the special collection are all part of the university library, and it is full of surprises. At the UMCP libraries, the curious come to experience the music of Mozart or the tirades of Joseph McCarthy. They can discover the details of NASA aeronautics, or trace their way back through history with old maps, films, art and books. And, increasingly, what isn't available on the spot can be accessed through a complex net- working system that leads searchers through the holdings of the state, and in some cases, the nation. A long way from the age of card catalogs, the library remains a place of solitude, quiet and books. But now, it is also a sophis- ticated world of computers, compact discs, audiovisual equip- ment and much more. “We are undergoing evolution— not revolution,\" says library director H. Joanne Harrar. “Each one of these means of com- munication is adding on to what is already there; nothing yet is being replaced.\" Nothing, that is, except the old way of looking at libraries. And at College Park, the library system may be more changed than most. While it will celebrate the acquisition of its two millionth volume in the fall of 1990, a landmark belated for a campus the size of College Park's, the library has blossomed from one building full of bookshelves to a system that spreads out to accommodate everv department and topic. As library development director Mary Holland says, a library graduates no one. But without it, there would be no one to graduate. This is the dilemma of the modern university library. Essential but long ignored in the funding process, it faces infla- tion, fast-changing technology and the full-time needs of a major research university. A manv-tiered system, UMCP's library stands on two legs: McKeldin, the graduate library, and Hornbake, the undergradu- ate. They support a system that includes five branches and nu- merous special collections, service and technical divisions. 10 \"Libraries are nothing more than one aspect of society. They are repositories of society's history and its knowledge,\" Harrar says. \"So if they are going to be effective social tools, they must reflect the technological developments of society.\" Those developments have irrevocably changed the library. It is more than a place, it is a system— a moving, many-tentacled organization that relies on the skills and expertise of hundreds to do its job, day and night, year-round. With special collections and branches holding information on everything from aerospace engineering to art history, a library computer network called the On Line Catalog has mostly replaced card cataloging. What that computer network neglects, indexes on CD-ROM, compact discs with read-only memory, provide. Other information can be found through special computer searches done by reference librarians or on microfiche, as well as in printed indexes of every variety. In the Engineering and Physical Sciences library, the computer indexes are used daily on information searches. Reference librar- ians lead patrons on searches like archaeologists on a dig, sifting through endless information to make a find. On one such search, a thin man with collar-length hair and an intense concentration in his face removes a compact disc from its case, watching the rainbows it reflects, like a prism, as it catches light. He inserts it into the disc player and turns on the computer. Today, Jim Miller, a reference librarian here, is experimenting with a new CD-ROM, searching engineering abstracts for articles on a technical aspect of bridge building. \"Finite, element, con- crete, bridges,\" he types. The computer blinks. \"Searching.\" Fi- nally, it combines his key words and tells him 13 articles contain all of them. He asks it to display the titles of each, and it does. \"The computer has made a lot of it easier,” Miller says, but the days of manual searches are not over, and the librarian is far from obsolete. With their special knowledge of the collections, search systems and the subject area, librarians are more necessary than ever. Reference librarians like Miller use key words like clues, or points on a map. With such a vast collection, it takes the librarian to come up with the right key words to recall one item stored among millions of others. Such searches have grown in- creasingly necessary in a system that grows more complex every year. According to library statis- tics, in the last school year, librarians at College Park an- swered 504,957 reference inquir- ies and did 32,555 database searches. With almost 3 million people coming through the li- brary turnstiles last year, the system has had to accommodate the growing need for materials. But with a total budget of $15 million, $4.5 million of which is designated for materials and collections, the process of choosing what to collect gets complicated. That's why in the last few years, library administrators have hired staff with specific subject expertise to choose what the library should spend its limited resources to buy. Such special selectors are called bibliographers, and the library now employs two of them. Heleni Pedersoli, the bibliographer in languages and literature, works out of a cluttered upper-floor office in McKeldin. All around her, aging books and cardboard boxes fill the cramped space she shares with a desk and several file cabinets. A cheerful, small woman, Pedersoli speaks with a soft Portuguese accent. Her job requires full use of all her knowl- edge, especially her ability to read. In Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Hebrew, Latin and Greek, that is. These are the subject areas in which she selects, as well as in the East Asian collection, which she reviews by reading Japanese and Chinese in translation. Pedersoli analyzes most bibliographies relevant to her subject, looking for newly published books the library should have. Then she checks courses taught on campus and the needs of the re- searchers in that topic. She then writes an acquisition policy for each area, listing needs by priority. \"Sometimes people think the librarians just check books out,\" Pedersoli says. \"Before you get it on the shelf, it goes through this long process of decision making— and it's labor-intensive.\" Pedersoli's description is no exaggeration. In the nooks and crannies of the graduate library, a book, or a periodical or video- tape or almost anv library material, has to be chosen by faculty representatives, reference librar- ians and bibliographers, usually working in tandem. The bibliog- raphers then send the order to the people in acquisitions, who buv it. When it comes in, work- ers in cataloging label and num- ber it, slipping it into the huge indexing system that connects the libraries on campus. Finally, it gets to the shelves, where reference librarians learn its place, for the aid of users who will soon come searching for it. But that's not all. For books that deteriorate, a special preser- vation officer has formed a disaster team to deal with damaged materials, which are rescued, fixed and returned to the shelves or kept in storage for special use. Meanwhile, all this goes on in the branch libraries as well, where the focus narrows to a single subject or format. The branches are a special feature of the library system, self- contained but connected to the system and each other through the On Line Catalog. The branch libraries are more than just a collection of one subject gathered in one place. Each section reflects the person- ality of its collection, too. Branch librarians often hold degrees in their subject areas as well as library science, so historians head the collection of Maryland's historical documents and maps and a librarian with a chemistry degree runs the chemistry branch. At the Music Library, a pianist, a singer, a trombone player and a French horn player— all professional librarians— oversee numerous scores, cassettes, records and compact discs. Students come to complete music assignments or just to listen, quietly, to their favorite pieces. And it is quiet . . . mostly. But amid the occasional rustle of pages and whisper of students, there is also the vague sound of clashing cymbals and an occasional string movement just audible from the cubicles where listeners sit with earphones snug to their heads, busilv taking notes and rocking slightly. And on one desk, among the etchings of several student desktop artists, a bold signature marks the tone of the place: Johnny Jazz. In the Architecture Library across campus, the clean, black lines of periodical shelves displaying glossy architectural journals split the room in a pattern that gives a spacious look to the small area. On either side of them, narrow rows of books stand no more than one shoulder-width apart. Patrons must take turns moving down the long aisles, scanning the books on landscape architecture, fire protection codes, Greek architecture in the 17th century and more— many in Hebrew, French or Japanese. In a room near the entrance, old photos and sketches of the 1851 World's Fair line the walls, and stereocards seen through primi- tive 3-D viewers boast the highlights of the famous Crystal Palace built there. This library, like the Art Library nearbv, collects pictures, etch- ings and architectural drawings to serve those interested in its subject. And hanging on a cramped balconv above the Architec- ture Library, the National Trust for Historic Preservation Library does the same. In the Trust library, donated to the campus by the National Before a book Sets to the shelf, goes through a long process of deeision making. it 11 ns WORLD s KNOWLEDGE Trust in 1986, Sally Sims Stokes, the Trust librarian, sits in a near- hidden niche, her desk squeezed between bookshelves and bounded by a row of hanging files. The guardian of a collection that spans the history of the nation, Stokes manages to keep track of materials that cover the restoration of colonial Williams- burg, or the do-it-yourself house kits of the early 20th century that newlyweds bought out of a catalog and built themselves. She flips through one such catalog, produced by the \"Aladdin\" company, to a drawing of a house billed as \"The Marigold— Story and a Half-Price $789.\" Stokes grins, remarking that some of the houses in Takoma Park, not far from the campus, were built from a catalog bv Aladdin, or Sears and Roebuck. The Trust library has the largest collection of its kind in the country, so Stokes has her hands full with requests of all kinds— groups asking how to designate their neighborhoods historic districts, people wondering about certain buildings or sites, or searchers from everywhere, looking for a familiar landmark from long ago. This kind of long-distance use of the library is growing, especially as the technology to encourage it grows. Library di- rector Harrar looks forward to a time when library buildings will be havens for intellectual solitude and quiet, but when informa- tion can be obtained from anywhere, without stepping foot in the building. \"Increasingly our systems and our data must be available to our faculty and students in their computers,\" Harrar says. \"The thrust in the future will be access to what some people call the 'virtual library'— the world of knowledge.\" The technology for sending the full text of materials to a com- puter outside the li- brary exists, she says, but is presently too costly to use on a broad basis. But the time is coming, and soon, when the whole concept of a li- brary will change. It won't be a place, it will be a resource. Head of public ser- vices Danuta Nitecki agrees. With the explosion of information and the formats that hold information, libraries have to change. It's not enough for them to be warehouses of information; they have to be networks of it. \"No library can possibly expect to have all the information available, so instead ... our role is to have as much access as possible,\" she says. \"More and more, we're look- ing at ways that we can reach and identify information that's not available physically, locally.\" Even information that is available physically often takes a com- puter search to find. In the Government Documents and Maps Room in McKeldin, branch head Hugh O'Connor spends time with an older man looking for records of the United States' im- migration decisions in the early part of the century. At another moment, he answers a phone request for records of the leading causes of death from 1950 to 1969. Because McKeldin is a federal depository library, government- designated as one of only 52 in the country, the documents col- lection is best equipped to handle such requests. This section receives everything that is available through the government dep- ository program, according to documents librarian Marsha Carey. And because the library collects much of what the U.S. gov- ernment has to offer, plus a collection of international and agri- cultural publications and a full collection of regional, national and international maps, it stands alone as a major resource on almost every subject. On the first floor, vicarious travelers can sift through the maps of every state in the nation and country on the globe. And if they want to travel through time, a patron can walk upstairs. There, a copy of almost every Congressional hearing ever printed represents the diary of the nation. The hearings are an index to its interests, fads, discoveries, maturity— and sometimes its immaturity. On this floor, bound Congressional hearings stretch back for five or six rows. They make a strong impression of sameness, of years and years of the statements and misstatements made in this country's chambers of power. But standing out slightly from the mass of grays and browns is a thin blue book titled State Department Employee Loyalty Inves- tigation. The date is July 20, 1950. The small book details the allegations of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, including \"statements by Sen. McCarthy seemingly designed to suggest that he has con- fidential sources in the State Department.\" Anyone who wants to do more than read about McCarthy can take a short walk across campus to the undergraduate library, where in the Non Print Media Department, the senator glares out at his audience, pointing at the accused and speaking in a nasal tone that the nation has since marked sinister. Long-distance use of the library is growing. 12 The whole concept of a library will change. It won’t be a place, it will be a resource. He lives there on tape, in a library that reflects the greatest change in the system. Here, video and audio tapes pack the shelves behind the reference desk, and each cubicle contains a television screen and video recorder or tape deck. Filled with silent kinetic energy, the room lights up with the flash of color and action from every screen. Allan Rough, head of Non Print Media Services, freely ac- knowledges his love for the \"toys\" that fill his section of the library. He points to a windowed room behind the reference desk, where 20 screens and a jumble of wires and dials serve as the control center for the library and the campus' cable TV channel. Hyperactive images jump across the screen: a man playing the harmonica, a news program and Gov. William Donald Schaefer wearing a Terp cap and holding a red-and-white banner. This room also controls the video \"dial access\" channels avail- able in two rows of cubicles at the far end of the library. The dial access system— a 14 channel in-house cable system programmed weekly with course assignments from different disciplines— runs 80 hours a week. The control room is only the most visible part of a system charging into the next centurv with all its might. But librarians have not forgotten the content of their work amid the increasing complexity' of its form. Instead, they still see the li- brary as a place to treasure hunt in an information-rich world. And that's why, for the most part, they're here. \"I went into the library sciences because libraries are where there is information,\" Rough says. \"Libraries are where you can find out the answers.\" That sentiment is echoed by many librarians, especially library- director Jo Harrar. She sums it up yvith another story, of herself as a small child. Harrar savs she was passionate about reading, and even before she was literate made her mother read and read and read to her. Once she could read, she concluded when she grew up she would read everything ever written. That yvas before she knew about foreign languages. When she found out about that, she decided to read everything ever yvritten in English. Then she found out about different sub- ject matters. When she found that out. she realized the task yvas an impossible one. So she became a librarian. G&HH 13 THE “•'We or the'® v,v\" B Y LISA GREGORY PHOTOGRAPHY BY JOHN T. CONSOLI %M4 f Dee Bickley, studying with a classmate, followed her daughter and three sons to College Park. ENRIETTA SPIEGEL WAS AN 80-YEAR-OLD freshman attending her first class. And she was a little nervous about it all as she quietly made her way to a seat in the huge, empty lecture hall. Then she heard it. The remark. “God, just look what came through the door,\" the young student said in her direction. At that moment, still feeling the sting of the young man's words, she could have gotten up and left right then and there, abandoning her desire to get a college education. But Spiegel was no quitter. Confidently, she squared her small shoulders and thought to her- self, \"I'll show you.\" Four and a half years later, Henrietta Spiegel at the age of 85 received her college diploma, making her perhaps the oldest person to ever receive an undergraduate degree from the Uni- versity of Maryland at College Park. She smiles now at her first-day experience, one that in no way would reflect her years as a stu- dent on the College Park campus. Bv the time of her graduation in 1988, she had been whole- heartedly embraced by the campus community, from students to faculty members. \"My greatest achievement here,\" she says, blue eyes twinkling, “was my rapport with the students.\" Spiegel not only graduated, but impressively with a 3.7 grade point average out of a possible 4.0. An English major and sociology minor, she was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa, the Mortar Board National Honor Society, Omicron Delta Kappa, Sigma Tau Delta, Phi Kappa Phi, and Who's Who Among Colleges and Universities. \"It's important to realize your own self- worth,\" says Spiegel, who enrolled at College Park following the death of her husband of nearly 60 years. “The greatest problem with senior cit- izens is that many of them do not have a com- plete feeling of self-worth. They accept being old. They accept that it's hard for them to get around ... all the things that come with aging. They don't seek ways to make things easier for them- selves, to be constructive and achieve a real sense of self-worth. That's very important.\" Doris Yochum, 63, had always been interested in anthropology. A nurse most of her life, Yo- chum decided even before she retired that she wanted to enroll at Maryland and major in an- thropology. It was a notion that left her husband and son a little \"flabbergasted,\" but supportive. She retired in December of 1988 and began classes in January of 1989. \"I felt as if I had started a new life,\" she says. \"I had always wanted to do this, but never had the time.\" This past summer Yochum earned credit by working on an archaeological dig in Annapolis. She fully anticipates graduating with her degree and working in the field— even if only on a vol- unteer basis. \"You don't set out to do something like this and not plan on achieving it,\" she says. Like Spiegel and Yochum, more and more sen- ior citizens are attending college classes. Some are trying it for the first time. Others are return- ing to finish degrees. Some are taking classes for interest only. Others are working on degrees. \"More and more people are able to be active well into their 80s without many impairments, and people can expect to be active 20 to 30 years after they retire,\" says Laura Wilson, director of the university's Center on Aging in the College of Physical Education, Recreation and Health. At the turn of the centurv, only 4 percent of the population was 65 or older. In 1990, that number was expected to increase to 12.7 and bv the year 2000 to grow to 13 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of the Census. \"It's so important for us,\" says 74-year-old Dee Bickley of the opportunity to attend college classes. \"It keeps us alert. I would study forever and ever if I could.\" Most of the older students on campus partici- pate in the Golden Identification Card Program ► ► k 4 4 '4 FELT A* rO STARtt® life.' Jack and Melva Kleiman are both auditing classes and participating in the Golden ID program. 16 that makes courses and campus services avail- able to persons who are 60 or older, who are residents of the state of Maryland and who are retired or not employed for more than 20 hours a week. The program is also open to Maryland- ers under 60 who are retired and disabled. Ac- cording to Nancy Bruns, program coordinator, as of spring 1989 the program had 475 participants. \"It opens up a whole new avenue for them,\" says Bruns of the program. jack and Melva Kleiman both participate in the Golden ID program. Jack, who has his Ph.D. in political science, is interested in studying both Chinese and Spanish. Melva is interested in art and crafts. \"But I take anything that sounds interesting to me,\" she says, \"like sociology, geography, health.\" Both Kleimans are auditing classes. \"We plan on doing this indefinitely,\" says Melva of the college courses they take. \"It gives a routine to your day once you're retired.\" Shortly after the death of Spiegel's husband and prior to her enrollment at College Park, she went to visit a sister in Florida who lived in a retirement community. There she learned the value of having a routine to her day. \"I saw how much time was wasted by her neighbors and friends,\" recalls Spiegel. \"They did nothing constructive, just sat and gossiped and worried what the next meal would bring. Sometimes they spoke about their grandchil- dren. But they had nothing for themselves.\" Coming back home, Spiegel was determined to do something for herself. She called her son and told him, \"I want to go to college.\" \"I realized that, living close to the university, I had to find out what was available to me,\" says Spiegel, whose home is situated between two fraternity houses. \"I wasn't looking for fun and games or wasting time. Anyone can do that. But I felt that there were things I could learn.\" Like so many of the other older students, Spiegel has a real respect for education. Her husband graduated from the University of Vienna, where he was a student of Sigmund Freud. But she found satisfaction not only in what she learned in the classroom, but with the people she met as well. \"1 have so many friends, and that is a wonderful feeling,\" says Spiegel, who attended football games and the occasional tailgate party while she was a student. \"I have learned so much from the profes- sors, the courses and, of course, the students.\" Her last semester, Spiegel hosted a cookout for the students at the campus shuttle service. She relied on the shuttle to transport her back and forth to classes. In appreciation of the cookout, the students presented her with a card and showered her with hugs, kisses and kind words. \"I enjoyed it all,\" she says of her years as a college student. \"I worked hard, and I enjoyed a sense of self-worth. When people asked, 'Don't you find it hard to do this?' I told them, 'Nobody sent me!' I have to be responsible for myself. I wanted to set an example of how important ed- ucation is and how important it is to adjust and live with people.\" She says that she was pleased to find that the younger students were eager to make friends with her and even offered the occasional helping hand up a flight of stairs. Counselors Barbara Goldberg and Beverly Greenfeig see plenty of interaction between older and younger students in their Returning Stu- dents Program on the campus. The program is designed for individuals who are 25 or older, have experienced a break in their formal education, and would like to return to or begin college study. A course for returning stu- dents (EDCP 108R), \"College Aims for Returning Students,\" is also offered. Greenfeig laughingly recalls one particular class where two of the older students mothered one young man. \"The two of them were concerned that he was taking too many hours,\" says Greenfeig. \"So, after class one day, the two women sat down with him and talked him into cutting back on his 19 or 20 hours.\" Goldberg says that it isn't that unusual, though, in the beginning for the two very differ- ent age groups to avoid each other. \"There's a bit of a standoff,\" she says. \"They're not sure if they have that much in com- mon. That's whv small classes are particularly good. They have a chance to get to know each other.\" And often it doesn't take long for the younger students to realize the value of having an older student in class, says Greenfeig. \"The older students are good students,\" she says. \"They take good notes, ask good ques- tions. The younger students begin to see the older students as a great reserve to have in class.\" And the younger students, says Goldberg, can inspire the older students with their excitement, enthusiasm and youth. \"These are people that are very excited to be here,\" says Greenfeig. \"Or they wouldn't choose to come here. And they can share with the Continued on page 17 K r * Doris Yochum, 63, has been interested in anthropology for as long as she can remember. Now she hopes to receive her degree in 1991. SPRING 1990 A Class Ring That Still Shines f T { UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND AT COLLEGE PARK I I f \\ \\ uring a touch football game at Orlando Air Base, Donald M. Gold- stein lost his University of Maryland 1954 class ring. He and his friends searched the grass for two days but couldn't find it. Quartermaster First Class Sean C. Downey is a metal detector hob- byist at the Navy's Orlando Recruit Training Center— the old air base. Last spring, while us- ing a metal detector on those grounds, he got a signal. He dug. Nothing. He dug some more. There. Under about eight inches of dirt lay a Uni- versity of Maryland 1954 class ring. It was in- scribed with the initials D.M.G. and the Greek letters Sigma Nu. With this information, Downey contacted the Office of Alumni Programs in search of D.M.G. Records were searched, and Goldstein was lo- cated. He had been voted, the first Ugliest Man on Campus in 1954. A retired Air Force colonel, Goldstein is a pro- fessor of public and national affairs at the Univer- sity of Pittsburgh. His wife recently talked of hav- ing a new class ring made to replace the lost one. Then Downey called, and the ring was returned. As thanks, Goldstein sent to Downey three books he had co-authored— At Dawn We Slept, Miracle at Midway, and Dec. 7, 1941: The Day the Japanese Bombed Pearl Harbor. Goldstein had lost the ring in 1957. Downey found it in 1989. A life's history of soil had cov- ered it. Still, it shines like new, Goldstein says, like the day on which he graduated. From the Alumni Director Wherever I go in my university travels, people want to know more about the College Park Alumni Association. Although the association has been in existence only for nine short months, we have been hard at work— building a firm foundation for the future and launching an ag- gressive campaign to enhance our visibility. Under the skillful leadership of association James Shaw, the alumni board of gov- ernors is working ever more closely with Univer- sity President William E. Kirwan to ensure that the direction we take will indeed enhance— and advance— the entire university's mission and plans. To position the association to meet the chal- lenges of the future, a number of committees have been formed within our board of governors. Among these are Strategic Planning, Membership and Marketing, Career Counseling and Mentor- ing, and more. While each has a separate purpose, all share the common goal of strengthening the bond between this university and its alumni. Most critical to the success of the association, though, must be a strong and active base of membership. We are pleased to count more than 21,000 current paid members, but there is much more to be done. The greatest challenge we face is that of realizing the potential we have to attract thousands of more alumni into our ranks. Finally, when asked about the College Park Alumni Association, I am sure to recount the benefits of membership— quick to point out that the greatest of these, no doubt, is the pride de- rived from a continued commitment to and re- lationship with your alma mater. And that is when I reach into my pocket, pull out a mem- bership application and ask, \"Are you a member?\" Leonard Raley K2SH la College of Agriculture The College of Agriculture Alumni Chapter has had a busy year to date. In September, the chapter co-sponsored the 1989 Welcome Picnic with the College of Agriculture. Over 225 alumni, students and faculty attended the picnic, enjoying the cookout and volleyball game outside Symons Hall. During Homecoming, agriculture alumnus Lloyd Potter returned for his 50th reunion, bring- ing the blue 1936 Ford convertible that he drove to and from his farm in Cabin John, Md., while a student at the university. In November, three representatives of the Ag- riculture Alumni Board attended the inaugural dinner for the Maryland Agricultural Education Foundation Inc. The foundation is designed to coordinate public and private support for the continued development of agricultural education programs in Maryland's schools and colleges. In other news, Dr. Paul Mazzocchi was ap- pointed acting dean of the College of Agriculture and the College of Life Sciences by President Kir- wan. Dr. Mazzocchi has been on the College Park faculty since 1967 and chaired the chemistry and biochemistry department since 1982. Maz- zocchi also served as the acting director of the Maryland Biotechnology Institute in 1985-86. Finally, in an effort to locate over 2,000 lost alumni, a special edition of \"Ag Alumnews\" was sent to agriculture alumni. The response to the special edition was tremendous and agriculture alumni are congratulated for their contributions to this effort. If additional agriculture alumni are not receiving the \"Ag Alumnews,\" please con- tact: Editor, \"Ag Alumnews,\" 2111 Jull Hall, Uni- versity of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742- 2525 or call 301/454-7752. College of Architecture The annual fall get-together for architecture alumni was held at the School of Architecture in October. Past presidents of the alumni chapter were honored, including Glen Stephens, Tom Aylward, Jim MacDonald and Tom Eichbaum. Current president Joe Quarterman welcomed all alumni and distinguished guests. College of Business and Management The year 1990 promises continued growth and change for the college's alumni chapter, which has a new director to coordinate its many activ- ities. Tim McDonough has been named the CBM's new director of alumni programs. He previously was associate director of development in the Col- lege of Journalism. McDonough becomes the Business School's first full-time alumni director. He will work with Dean Rudolph Lamone and CBM Alumni Chap- ter President Mike Walsh to coordinate the chap- ter's annual social and fund-raising activities. McDonough says the chapter's first order of business will be to refine and complete the stra- tegic plan for 1990 that will encompass the or- ganization's social and professional goals. High- lights of this plan include the March Entrepreneur's Club Reception for Maryland basketball coach and CBM alumnus Gary Wil- liams at Columbia Country Club in Bethesda, Md., and the May 19 Alumni Gala Dinner at the BWI Marriott. William E. Mayer (CBM '67), Chairman, Management Group of First Boston Inc., will be honored at the Gala as the alumni chapter's 1990 Outstanding Alumnus of the Year. McDonough welcomes new ideas and volun- teers. He can be reached at 301/454-3831.

College of Education The College of Education is delighted to have a dynamic, expanding alumni chapter. The pri- mary emphasis of the chapter is on enhancing channels of communication between alumni, fac- ulty and students. Each year the chapter joins the college in hosting a series of programs and activities of interest to its graduates and faculty. These events, including the September Supper and the Vernon Anderson Lecture, are intended to serve as a vehicle for facilitating and maintain- ing close ties. In the fall of each year, the alumni chapter co- sponsors with Phi Delta Kappa a September Supper. The purpose of the supper is to famil- iarize alumni and friends with recent activities of faculty within the college. This year's program focused on international research activities in Egypt, Japan, China, the Soviet Union, Hondu- ras and Western Europe. The supper also includes the presentation of the alumni chapter's annual Distinguished Alumni Award. This year's recipient was Dr. Stanley J. Drazek, chancellor emeritus of University of Mary- land University College. Dr. Drazek received his Ph.D. in 1959, majoring in industrial education and minoring in administration and sociology. The chapter is also involved in the Vernon An- derson lecture, which is co-sponsored with the college for the faculty. Established in 1973, the lecture is held every spring to honor Dr. Vernon E. Anderson, who served as dean of the College from 1955 to 1970. The lecture focuses on signif- icant recent events in the field of education. Past lecturers have included the Secretary of Educa- tion, members of Congress and other prominent leaders in education. Last year's speaker, Dr. Eliot Eisner, professor of education and art at Stanford University, spoke on \"The Potential of Qualitative Inquiry for Educational Practice.\" During the lecture, the outstanding male and female graduating seniors are recognized for their academic achievements. The alumni chap- ter honors these students with plaques pre- sented by the alumni president. A special event to highlight 1990 for the chap- ter was a gala reception at the Japanese Embassy. For the 200 guests, authentic food and drink was featured. The focus of the event was celebrating the college's Mid-Atlantic Region Japan-in- School (MARJiS) program headed by Dr. Barbara Finkelstein. The MARJiS program is a curricu- lum research and development program de- signed to explore the foundations of innovative intercultural instruction in pre-collegiate schools. The alumni chapter assists the college in its efforts to increase campaign funding. The chap- ter plans to award a number of scholarships for 1989-1990, which will be based on scholarly ac- complishments at the undergraduate and grad- uate levels. The current chapter officers are: president, Ev- elyn Pasteur- Valentine, who recently was named president-elect of the newly formed College Park Alumni Association; president-elect, Jenny John- son, and secretary-treasurer, Gustava Sutphin.

For more information, contact A.F. \"Tom\" Franklin, Spe- cial Assistant to the Dean, College of Education, at (301) 454-1442. College of Engineering More than 2,000 alumni have joined the new College Park Alumni Association and are mem- bers of the Engineering Alumni Chapter as well. The Engineering Alumni Chapter has had a very successful fall, and looks forward to even more participation from engineering alumni in the fu- ture. The alumni chapter kicked off the fall with a reception for all mentors and mentees participat- ing in the Mentor Program. More than two-thirds of the alumni and student participants attended. Dean George Dieter and Alumni Programs Di- rector Leonard Raley spoke to the group, and a great deal of the evening was spent in one-on-one conversation among mentees and mentors. Two weeks later, the Engineering Alumni Chapter held a very successful Bull Roast at the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Recreation Center. About 250 people turned out— in spite of the threat of Hurricane Hugo — to meet with old friends and make new acquaintances. Next year's Bull Roast will be held at Goddard again. Plan to join us next September for this long- standing tradition of the Engineering Alumni Chapter. The chapter's big spring event is the annual dinner, which will be held at the U.S. Naval Academy Officers and Faculty Club in Annapolis for the second year in a row. More information about the dinner will be mailed to alumni as June draws near. Join us for what promises to be a fun and exciting evening. If you have questions about the Engineering Alumni Chapter or would like to become more involved, please contact Pam Stone in the College of Engineering at (301) 454-0544. 3a Government and Politics On Oct. 4, 1989, the newly formed Govern- ment and Politics Alumni Chapter of the Univer- sity Alumni Association held its first meeting of the new year. Officers were elected, bylaws were ratified, chapter goals set and the chapter dis- cussed what promises to be an exciting and pro- ductive calendar of events for the coming year. Under the dedicated leadership of Neil Gray, president; Mike Onley, senior vice president; Kathleen Smith, executive secretary of the Col- lege Park Campus Senate and chapter vice-pres- ident/membership; Frank Donnelly, Alumni As- sociation board member and chapter vice president/treasurer, and Michael W. Smith, vice president/communications, the chapter plans, among other things, a Mentor Program that will pair a GVPT student with an alumnus in whose occupation the student has an interest. The alumni chapter is also organizing a Government and Politics Professional Network that will pro- vide services for both students and alumni. Ad- ditionally, the chapter will be holding several re- ceptions throughout the year, including an event in February that featured a prominent speaker. With the success of last year's reception at the Rossborough Inn and this year's Homecoming firmly under our belt, the alumni chapter is ex- cited and enthusiastic about what the future holds. All GVPT alumni are welcome and encouraged to join, become involved and share in the ser- vices, support and activities of our dynamic chapter. Please contact Erika Rauscher at (301) 454-8064. College of Human Ecology The Alumni Chapter of the College of Human Ecology is planning two spring events at the col- lege. The annual Awards Night, held to honor out- standing students, faculty and alumni, will be Tuesday, May 1, at 7:30 p.m. Highlighting the eve- ning will be the presentation of the chapter's Ser- vice Award and the Distinguished Alumni Award. On Thursday, May 10, the group will host a Graduating Seniors' Reception from 5:00 to 6:30 p.m. in the Maryland Room. All graduates of the college are invited to both events. During the Fall, the HUEC Alumni hosted a Facultv-Alumni Reception, and a reception hon- oring December graduates of the college. The group is concentrating its efforts for spring on providing career guidance and help to students in the college. College of Library and Information Services The 9th Annual Alumni Day sponsored by the College of Library and Information Services was a grand success— \"Pathways To Health Infor- mation: A Prescriptive Approach\" attracted a large, vibrant, well-informed group. The Alum- nus of the Year Award was presented to Carolyn Brown, '68, presently chief librarian, National In- stitutes of Health. We hope those of you who missed it will join us for our March 1990 evening program and our 10th Annual Alumni Day in Fall 1990. The new year is very special for the college- 1990 is the 25th anniversary of the founding of CLIS, which was originally called SLIS, School of Library and Information Services. We are all thinking of appropriate ways to celebrate. Sug- gestions and participation are welcome. The CLIS Alumni Chapter is open to all CLIS graduates and inquiries regarding membership are encouraged. Please contact Esther Herman at (301) 434-6540. H 4a Howard County Alumni Club The Howard County Alumni Club is off to an- other busy year of challenging plans and activi- ties after wrapping up a very successful 1989. In November of last year, the club sponsored its annual bus trip to Memorial Stadium in Bal- timore for the Maryland-Penn State football game. The group of more than 40 alumni and friends were on hand for the Terps' 13-13 tie with the Nittany Lions. Also in November, in cooperation with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, the club hosted a group of Howard County high school seniors and their parents for an evening of infor- mation-sharing on Maryland's admissions stan- dards and student life on the College Park cam- pus. Representatives from the specific schools and colleges where the students had indicated special interest were available to answer ques- tions and address concerns. Three of the club's current scholarship recipients participated in the evening's activities. One recipient, Mark Dicus, offered the prospective students— and parents— his insights on the new challenges that campus life presents. The club has recently embarked on a $20,000 fund raising effort to endow a Francis Scott Key Scholarship for a deserving Howard County stu- dent. Howard County alumni and friends wish- ing to contribute to this effort may do so by mail- ing checks (designated to the Howard County Key Scholar to assure proper crediting), payable to the University of Maryland Foundation, do the Development Office, Turner Lab, Room 2101, University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD 20742. In the midst of this effort, the club will con- tinue to sponsor two scholarships a year. Selec- tions for the 1989-1990 school year will be made this April. The club's 50/50 raffle held annually in December and January is one source of fund- ing for the club's ongoing scholarship program. Activities for the Howard County Alumni Club's spring season include: a reception for Howard County high school seniors who have been accepted to College Park; an alumni recep- tion and program featuring university officials and entertainment; and a tailgate party at a Maryland lacrosse game. Any Howard County resident interested in participating in the club's activities, donating to the scholarship programs or serving as a mem- ber of the club's board should contact the presi- dent, Jim Stewart, at 997-3895. Prince George’s County Alumni Club 1990 promises to be as busy as 1989 for the Prince George's County Alumni Club. Already the club has sponsored its annual oyster roast- celebrating the 20th year. This event contributes significantly to the club's Francis Scott Key Schol- arship and Calvert Mansion (in historic College Park) restoration programs. On Feb. 8 members gathered on campus to participate in a phonathon held in cooperation with the admissions office. Speaking personally with some of the area's most talented high school students, members had an opportunity to congratulate them on their being admitted to Maryland and to encourage their Fall 1990 en- rollment. In April the club will present the Goddard Medal to outstanding seniors from Prince George's County. The Prince George's County Alumni Club also contributes $1000 a year for its Francis Scott Key Scholar, Lisa Tannenbaum, a sophomore major- ing in biochemistry from Bowie, Md. Proceeds from many of its events and activities help sup- port this meaningful program. Club president Carolyn Headlee Fichtel attri- butes the club's success to active, involved and committed members. She gives special thanks to members Pat Metz, Jo Anne Welsh, Peggy Ross, Ellie Fields, Sarah Bourne, Karel Petraitis, Ches- ter Ward, and Jean Baron for the leadership roles they have taken on in carrying out the club's 1989 and 1990 projects. Prince George’s County Alumni Club Spring Events In April, the Prince George's County Alumni Club will have its annual meeting and wine tast- ing reception. Date and location will be an- nounced in the next edition of “Update.\" Hon- ored guests of the evening will be the 1990 recipients of the James Douglas Goddard Mem- orial Medal. Presented by the Prince George's County Alumni Club each year to the outstand- ing University of Maryland at College Park senior man and woman from Prince George's County, it is the oldest award of its kind given in coop- eration with the University of Maryland. Elections of officers and new board members will also take place at this event. We encourage any alumni in Prince George's County who want to become more active in alumni events to vol- unteer for the board of directors. Please contact Carolyn Fichtel, club president, 927-2510, or the Office of Alumni Programs, 454-2938. 5a REGIONAL CLUBS TRAVEL Scotland and England March 27— April 3 Partake in a one-week shopping spree and visit some spectacular sights as well!

Michael Weiss: Breaking the ZIP Code Just when you finally decided that the Postal Service's ZIP code is not a cruel test of your failing memory but a tool for expediting delivery of the mail, along comes Michael Weiss. According to Weiss, who earned a degree in English in 1973, your ZIP code not only tells where you live, but it also offers some pretty revealing clues as to how you live. That's the subject of Weiss' new book, The Clustering of America. The book, he says, defies the concept of a Mr. John Average, Anytown, USA. \"One of the great revelations to me about the whole cluster [different neighborhood types that comprise the United States] system is that it proves that the idea of America as a melting pot is a myth,\" he says. \"We're not all homogene- ous, we don't all melt into one kind of people, we don't all grow up and end up in shopping malls at age 20.\" Give the Washington-based freelance journalist your ZIP code and, with the help of his computer, Weiss will be able to tell you some surprisingly accurate facts about your life style and that of your neighbors. It is possible, he says, that you may have more in common with strangers living 3,000 mi"
