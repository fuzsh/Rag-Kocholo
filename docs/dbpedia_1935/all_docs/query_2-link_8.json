        "text": "University of Maryland baseball team\n\nThe Maryland Terrapins baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate baseball program of University of Maryland, College Park in College Park, Maryland, United States. The program's first season was in 1893, and it has been a member of the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference since the start of the 2015 season. Its home venue is Shipley Field at Bob \"Turtle\" Smith Stadium, located on Maryland's campus. Matt Swope is the current head coach. The program has appeared in six NCAA tournaments. It has won one conference tournament championship and five regular season conference titles. As of the start of the 2021 Major League Baseball season, 38 former Terrapins have appeared in Major League Baseball.\n\nDuring the 2014 and 2015 seasons, Maryland made consecutive conference tournament championship game appearances and posted back-to-back campaigns of 40 or more wins, a first in school history.[2] The Terps have made multiple appearances in various top-25 national college baseball polls in each of the last two seasons and was voted the 2015 preseason favorite to win the Big Ten Conference title, its first season competing in the league.[3] After failing to make the NCAA tournament for 43 years, the Terrapins earned berths in the 2014 and 2015 NCAA Division I baseball tournaments. In 2014, Maryland Baseball beat South Carolina to advance to the NCAA tournament Super Regional round for the first time in school history.[4] Maryland has participated in eight NCAA tournaments: 1965, 1970, 1971, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2021, and 2022. The program has won five regular season conference championships in its history.[5] In 2023, Maryland won its first conference tournament defeating Iowa, 4–0.[6]\n\nSee also: Shipley Field\n\nShipley Field at Bob \"Turtle\" Smith Stadium, often referred to simply as \"The BOB\", has been the home of the Maryland baseball team for more than 60 years. The team's playing field was moved to its current location in 1952, and became Shipley Field in 1956. The ballpark is located right in the heart of the Maryland campus, in between Byrd Stadium and the Artificial Turf Facility. The facility's current seating capacity is 2,500. Its playing surface is Sportexe Synthetic Turf in the infield and Bermuda Grass in the outfield and the dimensions are 320 down the left field line, 380 to center and 325 down the right field line.\n\nIn 1982, Shipley Field was the site of an exhibition game between the Terps and Earl Weaver's Baltimore Orioles. Eight years later, in 1990, the Soviet baseball team paid a visit to Shipley Field to take on the Terps in an exhibition series. The stadium has been hosting night games since a set of permanent lights were installed prior to the 1994 season. Shipley Field is named after legendary Terps' coach H. Burton Shipley, who was the Maryland skipper from 1924 to 1960.\n\nOn May 8, 2010, Shipley Field was officially dedicated as Shipley Field at Bob \"Turtle\" Smith Stadium in honor of former Maryland baseball player, Bob \"Turtle\" Smith '63.[7] Bob and his wife Carol had previously established a fully endowed baseball scholarship, called the \"Bob \"Turtle\" Smith & Carol B. Smith and Family Endowed Baseball Scholarship\"[8] A new turf infield, an upgraded warning track, a new brick backstop, a new outfield fence and an upgraded scoreboard were installed prior to the 2011 season.\n\nPrior to the start of Maryland's game against the Miami Hurricanes on Saturday, April 13, 2013[9] head coach John Szefc and the Terrapin baseball program held a dedication ceremony to unveil the Eric Milton Family Clubhouse.\n\nThe Terps' clubhouse, which is located within the Varsity Team House just beyond the left-field fence at Shipley Field at Bob \"Turtle\" Smith Stadium, received a facelift with significant help from former Terrapin Eric Milton (1994–96) and his family.\n\nThe renovation included the installation of 38 custom cherry-wood lockers, new carpeting and flooring, new signage, and the addition of an awards wall and a custom counter for kitchen appliances.\n\nIn 2011, a 5,000 square foot hitting and pitching facility, nicknamed, \"The Shell\", was installed behind the left-field fence at Shipley Field at Bob \"Turtle\" Smith Stadium and adjacent to the Varsity Team House.\n\nFormer Terrapins on current MLB rosters.\n\nPlayer Position Team Adam Kolarek P Los Angeles Angels Brandon Lowe 2B Tampa Bay Rays Kevin Smith SS Oakland Athletics LaMonte Wade OF San Francisco Giants Jose Cuas P Chicago Cubs\n\nName[10] Position Year ABCA BA CB NCBWA TSN Notes OF 1962\n\nY\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\nABCA 1st Team OF 2002\n\n—\n\n—\n\nY\n\n—\n\n—\n\nCB Freshman Team OF 1992\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\n—\n\n—\n\nABCA 1st Team\n\nBA 2nd Team\n\nCB 1st Team OF 1967\n\nY\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\nY\n\nABCA 2nd Team\n\nTSN 1st Team P 1972\n\nY\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n1st Team - Poll previously called American Association of College Baseball Coaches (AACBC) OF 1970\n\nY\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\nY\n\nABCA 1st Team\n\nTSN 1st Team C 2002\n\n—\n\n—\n\nY\n\n—\n\n—\n\nCB Freshman Team INF 2002\n\nY\n\nY\n\n—\n\nY\n\n—\n\nABCA 3rd Team\n\nBA 2nd Team\n\nNCBWA 1st Team OF 1964\n\nY\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\nABCA 2nd Team 2B 1971\n\nY\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\nABCA 3rd Team OF 2022\n\nY\n\nY\n\nY\n\n—\n\nNCBWA 1st Team\n\nBA 1st Team\n\nCB 1st Team\n\nABCA American Baseball Coaches Association BA Baseball America CB Collegiate Baseball NCBWA National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association TSN The Sporting News\n\nPlayer[11] Position Year Bob Grossman P 1972 Derek Hacopian OF 1992\n\nName Position Year 2B 1972 SS 1958 P 1965 P 1967, 68 1B 1954 1B 1960, 61 1B/OF 1961, 62 UTL 2004 DH 1976 OF 1959 SS 1959, 60 P 1969 P 1955 P 1983 P 1975, 76 P 1971 3B 1981 OF 1992 OF 1954 P 2012 OF 1963 P/1B 2004 P 1954 OF 1980 OF 1967 P 1975 OF 1969, 70 OF 1966 2B 2014 1B/P 1996 3B 1958 OF 1971 DH 2000 DH 1977 OF 1968, 69, 70 DH 1987 OF 1964 P 2013 P 1959 C 1961 3B 1959 2B 1981 P 2003 1B 1992 P 2014 2B 1970, 71 OF 1992 SS 1999 OF 1955 OF 2013, 14\n\nPlayer Position Year Tyler Blohm P 2017 Maxwell Costes SS 2023\n\nPlayer Position Year Chris Alleyne CF 2022 Matt Shaw SS 2023\n\nPlayer Year Rob Vaughn 2022, 2023\n\nYear Coach Record Pct Notes 1965 Elton \"Jack\" Jackson 0–2 .000 District 3 1970 Elton \"Jack\" Jackson 1–2 .333 District 3 1971 Elton \"Jack\" Jackson 0–2 .000 District 3 2014 John Szefc 4–2 .667 Charlottesville Super Regional 2015 John Szefc 3–3 .500 Charlottesville Super Regional 2017 Rob Vaughn 1–2 .333 Winston-Salem Regional 2021 Rob Vaughn 2–2 .500 Greenville Regional 2022 Rob Vaughn 3–2 .600 College Park Regional 2023 Rob Vaughn 1–2 .333 Winston-Salem Regional\n\nList of NCAA Division I baseball programs\n\nMaryland Baseball, Year-By-Year Record [1] [2]"
