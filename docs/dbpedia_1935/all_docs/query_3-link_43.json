        "text": "Columns compiled by your class correspondents\n\n1940s\n\n1947\n\nWe received a wonderful letter from Joan Dall Patton, who fondly reflected on her life with husband Ed “Pat” Patton, BArch ’49. “After being married, we spent a year in Seattle and returned to Ithaca, as Pat needed one more term to get his degree. We then returned to the West Coast and lived for 18 years in Sacramento, where our daughter Gail and son Tom were born.\n\n“My Alpha Phi roommate, June Johnson Reynolds, and her husband, Hugh, lived in Sunnyvale, not too far away. Another roommate, Rosemary Williamson Colgate, and her husband, Stirling ’48, PhD ’52, lived in Livermore, also close.\n\n“We later moved to Foster City and Pat opened his architectural office in San Mateo. In 1988 he retired, and we spent 21 years in Sonoma until he died in 2009. During those years we took many cruises, as well as golfing and fishing trips.\n\nI remember Junior Week dances in the Armory with big name bands at either end of the building.\n\nJoan Dall Patton ’47\n\n“When Pat died, I moved to an active adult community in Chico, CA, where my son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter live. He is a professor at the University of California, Chico. Daughter Gail lives in Ashland, OR. I still play golf and keep busy with bridge, etc.”\n\nAbout Cornell, Joan writes, “I remember Junior Week dances in the Armory with big name bands at either end of the building. I remember ice skating on Beebe Lake and many parties we architecture students had. I also remember drinking beer out of any container we could find and sliding down Libe Slope on trays from the cafeteria.” ❖ Class of 1947 (email c/o Alexandra Bond ’12) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1948\n\nAt our age, members of the Class of ’48 have an abundance of free time—and Joyce Van Denburgh Doty, MFA ’50, made excellent use of it with a detailed response to the Share Your News form.\n\nPerhaps invigorated by the oxygen she uses (though she never smoked, she presumes she inhaled others’), she goes beyond her own TV watching of both old black-and-white shows and modern news to describe her extended family in some detail. Her children: Harold ’73, Janet, Edith, and Michael attended Cornell, Rice, University of Houston, and CalTech, respectively. Granddaughters Elizabeth (mother of one) and Jennifer (mother of two) studied at Oklahoma University and Boston College, respectively, and grandson Christopher studied at Texas Christian University.\n\nJoyce writes, “My daughter Edith has retired from Abbott Labs and gone back to school—studying art! I tried to interest her in art as a child, but she’d have none of it. Now, she’s excelling in it. I’m so glad to see her having a rebirth, and I think she’s doing very well at it.”\n\nJoyce Van Denburgh Doty ’48, MFA ’50, and two friends jointly watch ‘Jeopardy!’ daily by telephone and endeavor to answer the questions.\n\nJoyce cites an interesting activity wherein she and two friends jointly watch “Jeopardy!” daily by telephone and endeavor to answer the questions. “It is very satisfying when we come up with the right answer, especially if the contestants do not!” In closing, she says, “I credit my years at Cornell with guiding me to my paths of employment and pleasure. Thank you, Cornell!”\n\nWe also received a short update from Jane Schenker Gelman, who reports that she has moved to Ann Arbor to be near her daughter Susan. Please send your news! ❖ Ray Tuttle (email Ray) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1949\n\n’49ers, please keep in touch! Tell us all about your day, your club activities, the books you are reading … Are you planning any trips? Where have you been lately? I surely hope to hear from you soon! ❖ Dorothy Mulhoffer Solow (email Dorothy) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1950s\n\n1950\n\nA current pleasure of this class correspondent’s job is learning about our nonagenarian classmates still actively involved in their life’s work. For example, Sonia Pressman Fuentes (Sarasota, FL) wrote in: “On April 19, 2022, a book was published called The Great Stewardess Rebellion: How Women Launched a Workplace Revolution at 30,000 Feet, by Nell McShane Wulfhart, which featured a trio of women, of whom I was one. The book has been selected by the Washington Post as one of the top nonfiction books of 2022.\n\n“The book tells the story of the airline stewardesses’ successful fight against sexist policies by certain U.S. airlines, which at the time, among other things, terminated or grounded stewardesses (now called flight attendants) based on marriage or turning age 32 or 35. I drafted the decision of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1968, finding that those sexist policies violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Two documentary films will be made about the stewardesses’ struggle for equal rights: one by Sarah Colt Productions for PBS and the other by British-American filmmaker Hugo Berkeley for international distribution. For these two films both filmmakers are interviewing and filming me at my home in Sarasota.”\n\nElizabeth Alexander Weis (Osprey, FL) wrote: “Hello! If you are reading this, you know the feeling of envy when you see someone running up the stairs or jogging down the street. It seems true that with age comes ‘wearing out.’ However, I have been fortunate to be able to keep moving, making my own meals, and partaking in my annual one- to two-month ‘walkabout’ trips to visit children. This year includes Chicago, Oregon, and Seattle. In the past I wore a sweatshirt that conveyed my status as a 1950 Cornell graduate, and I used to be greeted with ‘Wow, is that special?’ Then the remarks turned to ‘What is she doing traveling alone?’”\n\nA current pleasure of this class correspondent’s job is learning about our nonagenarian classmates still actively involved in their life’s work.\n\nPaul Joslin ’50\n\nElizabeth continues, “For any of you who wish to travel, here are some tips I have picked up. Fly first class (in my case a nice Christmas gift from one of my kids) and request Seat 1A. A first-class perk is the food; check the airline website and order your meals in advance. Check your large case and your walker. Your carry-on will hold your essentials and can also be a support. Take it to the gate and just before boarding ask to have it placed in baggage. Have your wheelchair pushed to the very edge of the plane’s door. Tell the attendant your seat number and you’ll be helped to it. Arrange to deplane only after you know your wheelchair awaits you. Collect your baggage and have a skycap take you and your baggage to the curb to await your ground transportation. Being generous with readily available tips helps things go smoothly. Bon voyage.”\n\nFrom your correspondent: The youngest of my 14 grandchildren, grandson Ryan, is a highly intelligent, curious, and introspective young man. Age 28, a Wisconsin U. grad, he lives in the small village of Washburn, near Lake Superior in far northwest Wisconsin, where he is employed by the Department of Natural Resources doing ecologic research. (As a college junior he once spent three months in the Ecuadorian rainforest collecting previously unidentified bugs subsequently studied for new chemical compounds of possible use in medicines.)\n\nIn his most recent email, he asked for my views and beliefs on death and dying. Quite strangely for a young guy, he had attended a “death café”—which I learned from the Internet is a meeting of about a dozen persons who, without agenda, meet to “increase awareness of death with a view to helping attendees make the most of their lives.” He met with 10 persons all over age 70, except for him, and reported that he found the experience “enlightening, thought-provoking, and inspiring.” He asked what I knew about death cafés and death doulas—which was nothing. Death doulas are persons who assist those of advanced age, or those clearly dying, to manage end-of-life experiences such as familial, social, financial, and estate settlement issues.\n\nWhen Ryan asked about my beliefs on death and dying, I replied that while I had at times thought about it and had opinions, possibly even beliefs about it, I had not organized them into any sensible form. I promised I would attempt to send him some sort of essay on the subject, perhaps of interest to future death cafés he might attend. Should you not consider the topic morbid or otherwise objectionable, send me your takes. ❖ Paul Joslin (email Paul) | 13731 Hickman Rd., #4207, Urbandale, IA 50323 | tel., (515) 278-0960 | Alumni Directory.\n\n1951\n\nI hope you all took the time to fill out and return the Share Your News form that was recently mailed to you along with class dues information. If you haven’t yet, it’s not too late! Please do send us your news—via the hard-copy form or the online news form—so our future class columns can be full of news from all of you. ❖ Class of 1951 (email c/o Alexandra Bond ’12) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1952\n\nEditor’s note: Sadly, Class of ’52 correspondent Joan Boffa Gaul passed away on April 11, 2023. This column, her final one, was written in February.\n\nJim Strub wrote from a mountainside in Colorado. He thanked me for continuing the column for so long and was grateful that so many of us were “still sentient enough to read it.” He went on, “By the grace of God I am still functioning well enough to be actively promoting the wonders of His creation to anybody around this part of Colorado who will pay attention. For example, with five others, I was recently on a day-long circumnavigational tour of recreational opportunities on the Pikes Peak massif, for which I was the tour guide. This morning I am here in my cliffside house looking out at the city and Pikes Peak, with dozens of colorful Labor Day hot air balloons flying in the foreground. Immediately behind me is a 740-acre city park with 20 miles of maintained hiking trails. A big part of all this blessing is that my son, Jordan ’81, and his wife, Michele, also live in Colorado Springs. Next month will mark the 10th anniversary of Peggy’s passing. Her paintings are hanging throughout the house, many of them being variations of bursts of light out of darkness. They are constant reminders to be living in the Light.”\n\nJim Ling wrote, also from Colorado, “I wanted to let you know that the Special District Association of Colorado recognized me as board member of the year at their annual convention in September. I don’t know if it was for performance or longevity. I’ve been on the board of the South Fort Collins Sanitation (a.k.a. sewer) District since 2005 and served as chairman from 2017–22.”\n\nStephen Tauber ’52 enjoyed a 20-day National Geographic expedition to the Antarctic, a 90th birthday gift from his son.\n\nStephen Tauber writes that in November he enjoyed a 20-day National Geographic expedition to the Antarctic, a 90th birthday gift from son Andrew. The group, which included his son and daughter-in-law Lisa, met in Buenos Aires and flew to Ushuaia, where they boarded the National Geographic Explorer, which took them to the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, the continent of Antarctica, and several nearby islands. “Overall, we saw eight species of penguin, four of seal, two of whale, multiple of albatross and of petrol, and numerous other types of bird, plus glaciers, waterfalls, mountains rising abruptly from the ocean, and icebergs (both tabular and high rise).” Surprisingly, they also got to see emperor penguins—hundreds of them—though they are normally found further south than they ventured. “For ventures off-ship, there were alternatives on offer; I always chose the least challenging.” The program was often determined by weather considerations. Weather included 50 mph winds with gusts of 70. During the crossing of the Drake Passage back to Ushuaia, there were waves of up to 11 meters. “The three of us played tourist in Buenos Aires before and after the expedition.”\n\nJudy Calhoun Schurman (New Canaan, CT) is enjoying her three children, eight grands, and three great-grands, plus one on the way. “I am planning a family reunion. All past reunions were on the East Coast, so I am looking at a West Coast location (at the insistence of one son and three grands).” Judy keeps busy volunteering and with a nonprofit called Staying Put in New Canaan. Joan Aten Beach (Lantana, FL) reports: “Same address, same great house, same wonderful Florida weather. The only change is our son Jeffrey ’76 came home from 11 years teaching in Thailand and is living with me. It is wonderful. I walk every day to improve that hip I broke. Ruined my golf. Love to read. Collect all kinds of nature, seed pods, etc. Very happy and still laughing. Look the same except for these darned wrinkles.”\n\nOne of the pleasant things that has happened in the past year is that I have reconnected with an old friend, Frank “Otto” Richter. I asked him to send news. Otto said he didn’t have any. I told him anything he sends is news. Soon, a 1950 census page from the Sigma Chi house arrived in the mail. I did not know that the 1950 census contacted all fraternities, and presumably sororities, dormitories, and other dwellings, to find out who was where, but it made sense. Great fun to see lots of familiar names, and to realize that somewhere there might be a sheet with our small corridor in Balch listing Joan Boffa, Nancy Barner, Jean Staples, Mary Ann Metaxas, and Trudy Krueger. Who knows where you might be. ❖ Joan Boffa Gaul (email c/o Alexandra Bond ’12) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1953\n\nCornelius “Neil” Jones and wife Ruth have relocated from Eagleville, PA, all the way west to Monrovia in Southern California. Neil writes that he’s been studying his family’s early history. “Some of my ancestors were early settlers of Staten Island,” he says. “They came to the U.S. as separatists, seeking religious freedom from the intolerance in Northwestern Europe.”\n\nDottie Clark Free loves living at the Vi, which she describes as “a wonderful retirement community in Palo Alto.” She especially enjoys playing bridge and continues with Bible study. “My family had a reunion here last June and all four generations were able to attend! It is amazing to be 91 and a half!”\n\nRobert Ashton writes from Portland, ME, that he has many Big Red memories, “from five years of mechanical engineering to managing my senior year to make the starting soccer team. I wasn’t very good, but I remember our great captain, George Boateng, MS ’55. He was from what was then called ‘the Gold Coast’ in Africa. I always wondered what happened to him, then I saw the name ‘George Boateng’ on a player for a World Cup team about a year ago. Must have been his grandson—that told me so much.” Robert shares that he’s very successfully retired. “I bought a boat and sailed around the world. Then I wrote a book about it: This Old Man and the Sea: How My Retirement Turned into a Ten-Year Sail Around the World, which is available from Amazon.” He moved from New York to Portland, ME, about five years ago when he “staggered close to the pearly gates,” he reports. “Now I’m in assisted living here, where I have acted in a serious study group, wound up teaching a course on astronomy, and am a member of an amateur, but serious, group discussing physics. Great group! Life is good!”\n\nStanley Landau, MD ’56, writes that he and wife Maxine are “living the good life at the North Shore Towers in NYC. We have five children, nine grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren—a very nurturing family.” A retired urologist, he played golf until this year and now works out at the gym every morning at 6 a.m. “I take online courses, write short stories, and oversee financial investments for the family. I have outlived all my oldest friends but have new friends and a wonderful family.” A highlight of his time at Cornell was being a member of Tau Delta Phi.\n\nI bought a boat and sailed around the world. Then I wrote a book about it.\n\nRobert Ashton ’53\n\nDonald Koch has moved back to the Dallas area after 20 years in Naples, FL, and currently resides in an assisted living residence in Richardson, TX, according to the info submitted by his daughter-in-law Susan Ellis Koch ’88. He especially enjoys visits from family members, including his two sons and families who live nearby, his daughter and her family in Atlanta, and seven grandchildren, ages 20 to 30. His favorite memories of Cornell focus on the friendship of his classmates, especially his Sigma Nu fraternity brothers.\n\nLynn Rosenthal Minton writes from New York City, “I’ve had very good luck and very bad luck. My daughter, Kathy Minton ’80, died of glioblastoma in 2016, and that same year, my second husband, Ed, after only nine happy years, succumbed to a dementia that robbed him of himself—and me of him. But after a while, I looked up and found my great good luck: six grandchildren in their early 20s who came with me to Paris and environs in 2018 and brought me joy. And then the next year to Provence, where Ed and I had gone on our honeymoon, with two of the kids bringing home signed posters from the same Roussillon artist Ed and I had visited 16 years before—whose work I can see on my walls now.”\n\nLynn says she feels fortunate to have her whole loving family, including some high-spirited kids, living near her either on the Upper West Side of Manhattan or just across town. “There’s always someone game for Sunday brunch or for dinner, for the pleasures of Lincoln Center, or for going with me to the Hopper show at the Whitney or the Jewish deli exhibit at the New York Historical Society just down the road from me. So I manage not to long for what I had but to be happy here, now.” Lynn’s family includes a number of Cornell grads. “My oldest granddaughter, Rachel Minton ’15, married her Cornell sweetheart, Jeremy Roberts ’14. Rachel’s father is Tim Minton ’79; her grandfather is Stuart Minton ’51; her uncle is my son Charlie Minton ’83; her aunt is my late daughter, Kathy Minton; and her cousin is James Bessoir ’18.”\n\nWe received a letter from Jacob Gonzalez ’26, recipient of this year’s Class of 1953 Cornell Tradition Fellowship. “Coming from a low-income household as a first-generation college student, an opportunity such as this one means the world to my family and me,” he writes. “My dream has always been to explore the field of aerospace through mechanical engineering, and I am happy to be able to embark on this journey at Cornell.”\n\nWho’s planning to attend Reunion, June 8–11? Class of ’53 treasurer Bill Gratz says the class treasury is healthy enough to cover the registration cost for all ’53 class members who attend (but not their guests). Bill will be there, as well as class VP Mort Bunis, JD ’55. Beautiful time of the year in Cayuga’s heights! ❖ Caroline Mulford Owens (email Caroline) | Jack Brophy (email Jack) | John Nixon (email John) | Bob Neff (email Bob) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1954\n\nOur class news cupboard is running dry. Please consider sending us your special news items. Your classmates will be happy to hear from you and we will publish your submissions on a timely basis. This plea is especially important with our 70th Reunion coming up next year. We hope to see many of you present. Our headquarters (as one of the oldest, if not the oldest returning class) will be the Statler Hotel, smack in the middle of campus. We will be bused to all events and the hotel has an inventory of walking help equipment for those who need it. Caregivers and family members are also welcome.\n\nBill Webber, MD ’60, former art editor of the Cornell Widow, and his wife, Elaine (Russell), BS ’53, continue to enjoy life in Tucson, AZ. Bill keeps busy with desert gardening, bicycling, trumpet playing, and singing bass in the Desert Voices Community Chorus. He hopes “to make the big 90” this June.\n\nMimi Cohen Levine of Springfield, VA, and her husband, Leonard, sold their house two years ago and moved into a senior living facility with the help of their four children, all of whom went to college in Ithaca. The three boys were Cornellians: David ’78, Steven ’83, and Ed ’84. Their daughter, Cindy, was a ’79 graduate of Ithaca College. The Levines have attended Cornell’s Adult University several times, including last summer, and readily admit that they fell in love with the Ithaca summers.\n\nSteve Krauss ’54 and wife Carol knocked off number one on their bucket list three years ago with a safari trip on the Serengeti Plain in Africa.\n\nSteve Krauss and his wife, Carol, live in Knoxville, TN. Steve is enthusiastically retired and says he enjoys printmaking and painting—and he still plays a mean game of tennis at the Knoxville Racquet Club. Steve and Carol knocked off number one on their bucket list three years ago with a safari trip on the Serengeti Plain in Africa.\n\nSteve Kaplan of Wayland, MA, whom we profiled in an earlier column, reports that the number of Cornellians in his extended family has grown to four. In addition to Steve, a nephew of his was a former adjunct professor in AAP; Steve’s oldest grandson, Joshua Calka ’18, received his chemical engineering degree and works for a bioengineering firm in the greater Boston area; and another grandson, Jacob Calka ’25, is a sophomore in CALS, scheduled to graduate in 2025. Let’s hope their 14-year-old brother will boost their Big Red number to five in a few years’ time! ❖ Bill Waters (email Bill) | Ruth Carpenter Bailey (email Ruth) | Class website | Alumni Directory.\n\n1955\n\nAs I write this, our class president, Bill Doerler, and other Class of 1955 alumni will be finishing lunch at the Banana Boat Restaurant in Boynton Beach, FL. I’m looking forward to a sober report on that gathering from Bill!\n\nOn a personal note, my partner, Marian Pritchard (Columbia School of Nursing, 1954), had recovered enough from her broken hip surgery in October that we drove up Cayuga Lake (remember, the south end of Cayuga Lake is at Ithaca) to Aurora for a Valentine’s Day lunch at the Fargo Inn. Well worth the drive on a bright, sunny, 44-degree day!\n\nRob Stotz has been writing and directing plays in his free time in the Ashburn, VA, area. As he says: “A big deal for an engineer!”\n\nLast spring, Beverly MacNamara Wait wrote that she was “still working on her golf and bridge.” She must be making progress, because I was lucky to just catch her on the phone as she returned from a bridge match! When she’s not honing her card skills, she enjoys walking on Barefoot Beach near Naples, FL.\n\nIf you are in touch with classmates of 1955, encourage them to drop me a line about their current comings and goings! ❖ John Wertis (email John) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1956\n\nLonnie Hanauer, MD ’60, writes, “My youngest of six grandchildren, Katrina Cassell ’24, is graduating from ILR this spring after spending the fall in Prague. Her brother, Max ’20, graduated from Arts & Sciences three years ago. I gave up my half-time private practice nine years ago, and I stopped working my half-time job as a local rheumatologist three years ago because of the pandemic. Bette and I are healthy and still traveling, although less ambitiously, after 64 years of marriage.”\n\nPlease send us your news—via the hard-copy form that was mailed to you recently or via the online news form—so our future class columns can be full of news from all of you. ❖ Phyllis Bosworth (email Phyllis) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1957\n\nWe are “SuperAgers!” Larry Wolf has co-authored, with David Cravit, the book SuperAging. They have curated and organized the latest research and thinking about the period of life after age 65. This book, with a publication date of April 2023, has already been preordered as a membership inducement by CARP, the Canadian equivalent of AARP. The two men have broken SuperAging down into seven simple components: attitude, awareness, activity, autonomy, achievement, attachment, and avoidance. They show how one can put these seven forces to work in one’s own life. From taking control of one’s health and healthcare to revolutionary thinking about retirement, money, housing, and even relationships, folks can discover how to make the years after 65 some of the best years of their lives. You can find more information here.\n\nAfter graduating from Cornell with his psychology degree, Larry returned to his Buffalo hometown. After several different jobs, he realized it was time for more education and earned his MBA from Wharton. With his vision of starting his own business, he realized that Buffalo might not be the optimum locale for success. Knowing that Toronto, Canada, was only two hours away, he and his bride were on their way. Larry founded the Wolf Group in Toronto and specialized in creative marketing messaging. Over the years, the group expanded into six more cities, including New York City, building upon Larry’s ability to identify important trends and how to create opportunities in communications strategies. The SuperAging book came about as Larry saw the trends happening with increased longevity, as the number of centenarians are growing each year. Larry was able to identify the elements of successful aging, and with David, one of his earliest employees, the book evolved. Now Larry and his wife of 56 years maintain a home in Toronto, but the colder weather finds them in Boca Raton, FL. Their family has expanded to two children and four grandchildren. He proudly has a granddaughter graduating from Colgate in May 2023.\n\nWe Class of 1957 classmates certainly qualify as successful SuperAgers with our involvement on many levels. John Fisher Jr. and his wife of 57 happy years reside at the North Hill Retirement Community in Needham, MA. John retired at age 75 as a consultant in strategic planning. When I called, he was playing duplicate bridge, a twice-weekly event. He is involved in a multitude of activities, including being the moderator of the weekly current events discussion, running the men’s book club, chairing the program committee, and being active on the civic affairs committee. He enjoys spending time with his sons and grandchildren and especially looks forward to, as he puts it, the tradition of the “Fisher-men” going to Maine each year for a four-day fishing trip.\n\nJohn Fisher Jr. ’57 looks forward to the tradition of the ‘Fisher-men’ going to Maine each year for a four-day fishing trip.\n\nJudith Tischler Rogers is another very active person. Judy, now a widow, is quite at home in Colorado Springs, CO. Younger folks may have difficulties keeping up with her. She walks two miles a day with her 9-year-old 14-pound dog, Buffy, plays pickleball twice a week, serves as co-president of her Sunday school class, plays both classical and popular music on her piano, and is a Stephen Minister and provides Communion for several home-bound members of her church. Judy maintains subscriptions to a symphony and belongs to the local opera league. Her three sons, each giving Judy a granddaughter and a grandson, reside in Coral Gables, FL, Seattle, WA, and Nagoya, Japan. In addition to her many activities, her family members give her much joy.\n\nFollowing his Cornell graduation, S. Edward Neuwirth earned his DDS at the NYU College of Dentistry. Soon after, he went to Hawaii and organized the first civilian dental internship there. His internship completed, he accepted a position with Hawaii’s Department of Health. His task was to survey the dental health status and needs of the elementary schoolchildren on the islands. He became very fond of the islands and the Hawaiian people. He was there long enough to become a decent surfer and earned his private pilot’s certificate. He left Hawaii when he was called to be an officer in the U.S. Army Dental Corps. He first served as the oral surgeon at the DMZ and then at a hospital in Seoul. While in South Korea, he became involved with sports parachuting (skydiving). Apparently, Florida called to him next; it’s where he established his professional dental practice. He may stay more on the ground now, as he is the biker on a sprint triathlon or a duathlon relay team. He participates in one event per month yet trains five days a week. Not only that, he teaches four days a week at the Nova Southeastern University College of Dental Medicine in Fort Lauderdale, FL, where he also has his home.\n\nWe might say that Marcia Wishengrad Metzger, JD ’60, lives a more sedentary life, except that she and husband Bob have recently completed a move. After many years of living in the Rochester area, in 2015 they moved into a home in Hilton Head, SC. Now they have moved “across the road” to a two-bedroom apartment in Holiday Indigo Pines, a senior retirement community. Any of us who have done this massive downsizing know only too well the stress of such a move. Surely her daughter, son-in-law, and high-school-sophomore granddaughter, who also live in Hilton Head, helped with the transition. ❖ Connie Santagato Hosterman (email Connie) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1958\n\nMore on Reunion, soon to happen, follows these news entries from several classmates. Martin Steinberg is a professor of medicine, pediatrics, pathology, and laboratory medicine at Boston University, and currently works remotely from his home in Naples, FL. To keep fit he swims and walks daily (swimming is confined to a pool since Hurricane Ian devastated the beach club) and travels as often as possible to NYC for theater, delis, and Brooklyn pizza.\n\nScientifically, Martin has studied the genetic and cellular basis of hemoglobin gene regulation, applying this to develop drug- and cell-based therapeutics for treating sickle cell disease. He was part of a group that developed the first FDA-approved drug treatment for sickle cell disease. Presently, he is working with industry to use CRISPR/Cas to change the DNA in patient stem cells and “cure” sickle cell disease and related disorders. This first-in-human treatment has been submitted for regulatory approval.\n\nStephan Wittkowsky, MA ’60, writes from Guatemala: “My work experiences include: 10 years of economic and feasibility studies at a U.N.-sponsored technical institute in Central America; general manager of a Sheraton Hotel in Guatemala; 20 years as CEO of an industrial complex in Guatemala; advisor and lecturer at two universities in Guatemala; establishment of various personal entrepreneurial ventures in areas of frozen foods, made-to-order wooden furniture, auto care, and others; 12 years as lecturer at Duke University’s Osher Lifelong Learning Institute; consultant to the UNC dean of the Kenan-Flagler Business School and the Executive Development Program; consultant of the Executive Service Corps of the Triangle; and SCORE mentor.”\n\nStephan continues, “I have three daughters, five granddaughters, and one grandson. Two grandchildren are U.S. university graduates working for a major financial company in NYC and one is an MD just about to begin an internship. Two of my three daughters are also Cornell graduates.” Stephan and Martin, we hope you both can make it back in June to the 65th to celebrate with us.\n\nMartin Steinberg ’58 was part of a group that developed the first FDA-approved drug treatment for sickle cell disease.\n\nAnother physician, Marc Gabel, writes: “I have retired after a 60-year medical career that metaphorically followed the arc of life—beginning in pediatrics and concluding in medical assistance in dying, with stops in military medicine, international public health, and rural general practice, plus a stint as president of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario. Now for a pleasant, modest entry into retirement in Toronto.” Marc, we hope to see you at Reunion.\n\nJohn Padget, MS ’59, writes from Key West, FL, reporting, “My Cornell roommate, Bruce Whilton, of Gloucester, MA, and Punta Gorda, FL, passed away peacefully in June 2022 in Punta Gorda after a long and well-lived life. He graduated with a master’s degree in chemical engineering in 1959, and while at Cornell, he continued his lifelong love of hockey as a member of the Big Red hockey team. He was in Kappa Delta Rho.” John had no other news from far down south, but he welcomes hearing from classmates.\n\nDan Martin writes, “My beloved Barbara (Cyrus) ’60 died last year, after 59 wonderful years together, including three sons and 10 grandchildren all living in the vicinity of the greater New York area.” Dan mentions lots of activity with family and friends, and he looks forward to resuming travel that was deferred due to COVID. “Fingers crossed!” Dan, we are sorry to learn of your loss.\n\nOur Reunion co-chairs write that everyone in the class should have heard from them with the registration materials sent in the spring. With a no-cost, everything-covered (except room) weekend, maybe we can break ’52’s record of 80 classmates returning to have a great time together. We’re going for it, as they say, with high hopes of seeing you there. Dick and Connie Case Haggard remind all to keep working on your classmate friends to get them to come back with you to enjoy a great time of Reunion on campus, June 8­–11. Register and come! ❖ Dick Haggard (email Dick) | Jan Arps Jarvie (email Jan) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1959\n\nOn New Year’s Eve, Bob Weinman once again conducted the Santa Barbara Symphony, this year in a rousing “76 Trombones” from The Music Man—looking debonair in gold and white, complete with gold epaulets on his pristine jacket. “It’s a glamorous, annual event held in the Granada Theatre in the city’s historic district,” says Bob. “Torrential rains that seemed to hit their peak as I made my way to the theater broke my umbrella in two, though I was near enough to the stage door to keep those epaulets fairly dry.”\n\nRichard Horwich, professor emeritus of English at Brooklyn College, has published 10024: A Memoir, the story of his early life from the ages of 7 to 30. The book is available at Amazon and other bookstores. The true star of the story is Manhattan’s Upper West Side (zip code 10024), a New York neighborhood undergoing radical transformation, since repeated elsewhere in the city. Richard remembers city elements lost to development: the schools, restaurants, parks, playing fields, stores, and buildings themselves. Broadway was a cobblestone boulevard with trolleys. Indian Walk Shoe Store had a fluoroscope X-ray machine that let you see your toes wiggle inside your shoes. Egg creams were universally available. And, of course, the book includes Richard’s years at Cornell.\n\nOn December 19, millions of jubilant people streamed into downtown Buenos Aires, celebrating Argentina’s World Cup victory with cheers, firecrackers, and honking car horns. It was joyous bedlam, though not appreciated by Alan Newhouse and other arrivals at the city’s airport, already weary from canceled and delayed flights from the U.S. Roads blocked by celebrants prevented the van that was supposed to transfer Alan and others to their hotel from reaching the airport; three hours later, a bus headed into downtown was finally located, but what was a supposed 30-minute drive took three times that. A brief stay at the hotel and then Alan was aboard ship, sailing down the east coast of South America, with stops at Montevideo and Puerto Madryn. Four days in the Antarctic Archipelago—“dodging icebergs and seeing the most amazing scenery and animals”—were followed by Cape Horn, Glacier Alley, and stops up the coast of Chile, with the 21-day voyage ending in Santiago.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve, Bob Weinman ’59 once again conducted the Santa Barbara Symphony, this year in a rousing ‘76 Trombones’ from The Music Man.\n\nWhen last we heard from Phyllis Corwin Rogers in 2021, the Northern Californian was preparing to fly to Austria to celebrate the birth of twin (a boy and a girl) great-grandchildren. The trip began late that year, with a stop in Miami to spend Christmas at a grandson’s apartment. Then off to the Newark airport, where the required COVID test turned up positive. No flight, no hotel rooms, and an Uber ride from Newark to her daughter’s home in Hershey, PA, followed by quarantining and a flight back home. Better days followed in 2022: “Catch-up travels included a Holy Land pilgrimage first scheduled in 2020, then a surprise trip in October to Oberammergau and the Passion Play—plus three glorious days with those infants and their 2- and 5-year-old brothers.\n\n“I’m definitely coming to our Reunion next year,” continues Phyllis. “And my sister Patricia Corwin Kubicki ’61, DVM ’63, PhD ’66, is looking forward to joining me. We had a wonderful time at the 60th!” Reunion chair for our 65th Reunion Jerry Schultz reminds folks to check the accuracy of their information in the Alumni Directory. “You don’t want to miss Reunion information, which will be arriving in classmates’ mailboxes before long.”\n\nIn February, Jerry and Carole Kenyon attended the annual Cornell Alumni Leadership Conference, held this year in San Diego. Both praised the special presentations, including those on the University’s libraries and bioengineering program. Plus, says Jerry, “Ken Blanchard ’61, PhD ’67, author of the best-selling book The One Minute Manager, gave a marvelous lecture on ways to be an effective leader.” Jerry and Carole discussed possible events for our Reunion, and Jerry had a very productive meeting with Lauren Coffey, associate director of class programs, who updated him about how her office will be working with our class for the June 6–9, 2024 Reunion.\n\nIt is with sadness that I report that Dave Dunlop passed away in February. A national wrestling star as an undergraduate, he was one of the nation’s leading development professionals during his exemplary 38-year career in Cornell’s Office of Alumni Affairs and Development. Through the years, his contributions to the University never slacked. Nor did his support of our alumni class: many of us will best remember Dave as co-chair of our wildly successful 25th and 50th Reunions. “Like me, Dave was an ILRie, and we bonded in September ’55,” recalls Barbara Hirsch Kaplan. “The bond grew and remained intact through our 60th Reunion, and it was strengthened by his affection for our children, Doug ’88 and Emily ’91. He and his wife, Peggy (Flynn), MS ’63, always had a reception at their home in Brooktondale for incoming children of classmates. As a fellow ILRie responded when I emailed him about Dave’s death, “He made Cornell and all who knew him better.” ❖ Jenny Tesar (email Jenny) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1960s\n\n1960\n\nEmerging from constraints imposed by the pandemic year, Bill Flanagan (Colonial Heights, VA) happily reports that the postponed wedding of his granddaughter has taken place in France, at a location near Limoges, where the nuptials were celebrated with a joyous fireworks display. Bill also had a busy year in Virginia during the statewide election; the Flanagans were founding members of American Veterans Vote, which was formed to encourage political participation.\n\nBill adds that he and Diane “were able to have meals with fellow Hotel School graduates, meeting with Jan Van Heiningen and Bill Callnin ’56, BS ’69, for a great seafood meal in Virginia Beach in July and a breakfast south of Richmond with Jack Keefe and his family. Jan, Jack, and I have worked on food and beverages for the last three class Reunions. We also keep Sue Phelps Day, MEd ’62, in our thoughts and prayers and thank Linda Jarschauer Johnson, MS ’63, for stepping in to oversee Class of ’60 events and keep us informed.” In St. Petersburg, FL, Jack is on the board of his condominium and working as a volunteer for the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Eckerd College.\n\nBetty Abraham Dowd writes from St. Louis, MO, that she is living comfortably in an apartment near the Missouri Botanical Garden and several parks, where she finds lots of good walking paths. She has three children and seven grandchildren; her two sons have twins, all of them in college, and her daughter’s two children have graduated from college and are working in Chicago, where Betty’s new great-granddaughter was born.\n\nIn Pepper Pike, OH, Cynthia Golomb Dettelbach says she is “always a theatregoer. In my retirement I have been writing plays, some of which have had either productions or staged readings at the Ensemble Theatre in Cleveland. I also enjoy taking senior classes at a local college, playing tennis, and visiting my children and grandchildren.”\n\nQueried about how his daily life has changed, Don Dewey, BA ’65, says wryly, “It’s the same old, same old. I’m maintaining our two homes, one in New Rochelle, the other on Chautauqua Lake. My daughter Elizabeth ’98, MBA ’06, who has two boys, recently gave birth to a baby girl in far-off Dubai.” Don also praises his “incredible wife Sandy” and says he is focused on “staying safe.”\n\nIn my retirement I have been writing plays, some of which have had either productions or staged readings at the Ensemble Theatre in Cleveland.\n\nCynthia Golomb Dettelbach ’60\n\nAlso living in New Rochelle, Phyllis Winter Feingold spent time during the pandemic year working at a daycare service. She was elected to the Westchester County Senior Citizens Hall of Fame and received the “Seniors Helping Seniors” service award. Now having given up her daycare employment, Phyllis does volunteer work with a senior group and says she looks forward to being able to travel again. Her biggest takeaway from the pandemic is “the importance of family and social interaction.”\n\nIn Manhattan, Cyrus Abbe is very grateful to report that he celebrated his second bar mitzvah at age 83, “thanking God for protecting me during my Jewish rescue missions and blessing me with a beautiful family and a wonderful life.”\n\nAfter the wrenching loss of his wife, Gail Hirschmann Becker ’62, Paul Becker moved away from Indiana and has now put down roots in Placentia, CA. He sends word that several of his family members are also getting settled: one granddaughter is going to graduate school at Harvard, his oldest son, Kevin ’89, is vice president of technology at Henkel, son Randy produces documentary movies, and daughter Tineka is a casting agent in Los Angeles.\n\nAlso comfortable with her current life is Allison Hall, who writes from San Leandro, CA. “I have retired from all the careers I had—elementary school teacher, holistic health practitioner, and marriage and family counselor. I now have the freedom to visit many locations with my therapy dog and enjoy taking long walks in our beautiful East Bay parks or snowshoeing in the Sierra foothills. Despite facing a rare kidney disease, I’m grateful to be alive and experiencing pleasures like kayaking with my dog.”\n\nNow settled into his new retirement community in Blue Bell, PA, A. Kirk Field, MS ’61, along with his wife, Marcia (Case) ’61, notes that he is an active board member of both Microbiotix Inc., a biotech company where he was a founder, and the Montgomery County Foundation, a charitable institution. Kirk still enjoys woodworking as well as time spent with friends and family, but he regrets the necessary cancelation of events at Cornell, saying “I have so missed our Reunions of ’60 and ’61 and missed the summer programs at Cornell’s Adult University.”\n\nPaula Friedman (Gresham, OR) is still focused on writing and editing books, but also enjoys hiking and cross-country skiing near Mount Hood National Forest. She looks forward to visiting places on her “bucket list,” especially Chilean Patagonia, the northern Norwegian coast, and the Greek Islands. She happily expresses gratitude for her health, good friends, and family members like her older son Chris and his wife, who live and sell their paintings in Berlin, and her son Joseph, who is completing his degree in history. ❖ Judy Bryant Wittenberg (email Judy) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1961\n\n“To do the greatest good” is the campaign for Cornell University—and this theme pervaded the atmosphere of the Cornell Alumni Leadership Conference (CALC), which I attended in San Diego last February. There were seven of our class members attending including me, Ken Blanchard, PhD ’67, David Chadwick-Brown, Carmine Liotta, class president Jim Moore, LLB ’64, Doug Uhler, and Larry Wheeler, Internet provider. Lauren Coffey, director of class programs, was there to support us all.\n\nWe all enjoyed a dinner together at Grant Grill near our hotel. The conference consists of two full days of sessions covering campus issues of interest to all Cornellians, including the digital library, engineering and medicine, leadership experience (where classmate Ken excels and shared some pointers), and a spotlight on student experience, where students shared their special interests, which helped us to see what Cornell is for them. Isn’t that what Cornell is all about?\n\nWe also learned about the governance of Cornell. Did you know that the Board of Trustees is a true governing body of 64 members, which includes staff, faculty, alumni, and students? This governance is unique among universities. There was also a voting opportunity for an alumni board member who was attending the conference. Having less endowment than other universities, Cornell does more by honoring “any person, any study.”\n\nOf special interest to me was a session focusing on human relations and communication from a generational viewpoint. We all laughed about how perceptions of generations differ from one another, which includes geographic differences as well. We were also all encouraged to access the Cornellians publication, which you know all about if you are reading this column! And did you know that 250,000 Cornellians live and thrive in the world today? Meanwhile the hotel-provided breakfast and lunch meals (at the Westin San Diego Gaslamp Quarter) were of good quality, and special perks included wine, beer, and coffee daily. CALC next year is in Baltimore, MD.\n\nIn November 2022 I accepted the invitation of my best friend, Ron Zimmerman, to be his wife.\n\nJan Hoffsis Sanderson Hayes ’61\n\nWearing my hat as class correspondent, I will share a happy letter from Jan Hoffsis Sanderson Hayes from Arizona. “In November 2022 I accepted the invitation of my best friend, Ron Zimmerman, to be his wife. It’s been a grand adventure! We gathered our immediate family of 27 for a Thanksgiving weekend wedding. Who says marriage and all its blessing needs to be reserved for the young? Our marriage provides Ron two daughters and me three sons. That’s a treat. We are not making any records with four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\n\n“We had both downsized in other lives, so this time we upsized to be sure we had a large kitchen and plenty of room. Ron loves to cook! We stayed in Arizona, in a citrus grove in North Mesa. We eat out once or twice a week and entertain at home as the occasion arises. I’ve joined a Pi Phi book club and enjoy being a ‘Golden Girl.’ We keep up with the day-to-day news, which is, unfortunately, frequently not what we want to hear. We continue to be optimistic and try to keep a sense of humor. Life is great! Our goal is to keep each day happy, healthy, and special.” She sends regards.\n\nSadly, we learned of the death of our classmate Joyce Berger Goldman last year. A Democratic activist, she was a key aide to two Essex County (NJ) executives.\n\nNews from M. Mehdy Douraghy from Chicago: He has been traveling in Europe including attending his son’s wedding in Sicily. Mehdy has been doing research for a catalogue on prayer rugs. He now has eight grandchildren from three sons and one daughter, and he’s doing a lot of reading.\n\nRemember to send your news to: ❖ Susan Williams Stevens (email Susan) | Doug Fuss (email Doug) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1962\n\nSpring—the season of change everywhere—is bringing a change to our class, as well.

Judy Prenske Rich will pick up the correspondent responsibilities. Send your news and views to Judy (email Judy here). Now! Please!\n\nAlan Flaherty and spouse Patti Myers enjoyed an early-January visit with their New Jersey family, plus a dose of four Broadway shows. “Tom Stoppard’s Leopoldstadt tells the story of a Jewish family in Vienna from 1899 through 1955. August Wilson’s The Piano Lesson tells the story of a Black family in 1930s Pittsburgh and its most prized possession, a piano of which the cabinet has been carved with images of forebears by an enslaved ancestor. Anthony McCarten’s The Collaboration focuses on the unlikely but successful three-year interaction between Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Adrienne Kennedy’s Ohio State Murders brought to Broadway for the first time the work of an esteemed 91-year-old Black playwright, starring Audra McDonald. The actress met Kennedy a while ago, and her desire to star in the 30-year-old semi-autobiographical play got it to Broadway.”\n\nDon Juran writes about a dizzyingly active year. “As the pandemic eases, we cautiously resume once-normal lives. We keep vaccinations current and mask up at chorus rehearsals and performances and other indoor activities. Still, we’re amazingly lucky thus far to have dodged COVID despite at least two exposures. Life is kind to us, and we are grateful. My final concert with City Choir was the Brahms ‘Requiem,’ among the greatest of choral masterpieces. We drove to Cornell in June for the 60th Reunion. As always, lots of camaraderie and good food and drink. Again, I served as chief registration nerd.”\n\nDon continues, “We hosted our daughter and two grandsons for about six weeks including trips to the National Aquarium in Baltimore and to Diggerland USA, a construction-themed amusement park in southern New Jersey. The kids loved Diggerland; my favorite thing about it was knowing I need never return. We traveled to Warsaw to join our son Adam ’94 and his family for a leisurely, relaxing visit. We celebrated our 53rd wedding anniversary. I completed my latest composition, In Remembrance, 2020–2022, and finished reading the complete works of Shakespeare. I once again got clobbered in Maryland Senior Olympic table tennis singles but medaled in doubles. I completed my 26th—and most likely final—season managing my age (60+) co-ed team. It’s been a wonderful ride and an unparalleled growth and learning experience. I will continue to manage my age (70+) team. In January I will sing my final concerts with Polyhymnia (chamber chorus). I also hope to compete in power walking and table tennis at the National Senior Games in Pittsburgh in July.” Whew!\n\nI once again got clobbered in Maryland Senior Olympic table tennis singles but medaled in doubles.\n\nDon Juran ’62\n\nFrom Judy Rich: “My husband, Bruce ’60, and I have been trying to make up for time lost during the pandemic to travel as much as we can for as long as we can. Last spring, we made our annual trek to Paris (the city of my heart) and to London where our daughter Stacey ’93 lives. Last fall, we finally made it to Istanbul and Cappadocia with a pit stop in Lisbon. Had I only been as diligent studying the topography as I was learning about sites and restaurants, I would have been forewarned that all those places are situated on very, very steep inclines. We loved Turkey and Portugal, but they were not easy for the orthopedically challenged, as we be these days. With that in mind, our mantra for our next venture was flat, flat, very flat! Thus, this spring we are heading to Copenhagen, Amsterdam (tulips and Vermeer, anyone?), and, of course, London, where we will arrive, due to spectacularly bad planning on our part, during Coronation Weekend! Still, very grateful that we can yet get up and go.”\n\n“Can We Mine Our Way to Sustainability?” was the subject of this year’s annual Fred H. Hicks Memorial Lecture held at Hicks Nursery on Long Island on January 29. When Fred, MBA ’63, a longtime supporter of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, passed away in 2004, the CALS Alumni Association chapter on Long Island decided to memorialize him by naming their annual faculty-speaker lecture after him. The Hicks family has ties to Cornell dating a long way back. Fred’s late wife, Marilyn Bosley Hicks, was our classmate; their son Stephen ’94 now runs the family nursery, Long Island’s oldest garden center, which Fred inherited from his dad, Edwin 1930. Hicks family forebears founded the town of Hicksville, on Long Island.\n\nAnd from our intrepid class president, Neil Schilke, MS ’64: “Ro and I both try to stay in shape and spend a lot of time walking and exercising. In the warm months, that includes playing golf. This year, I had a bit of an epiphany and won my Thursday golf group championship. That never got any ESPN notoriety (i.e., it was no big deal), but it was rewarding for me as the oldest golfer in the group. I continue to bowl as well. I have kept my 160+ average and have a rare moment of success—this year, a 236 game. I have also continued as treasurer for our homeowners’ association. That job has gotten more complicated over the years, as our subdivision has grown to 156 owners. We continue to enjoy Detroit Symphony Orchestra concerts, Broadway in Detroit plays at the Fisher Theatre, and plays at the Oakland University Meadow Brook Theatre.”\n\nNancy Williams Clark, MEd ’64, ever-busy creating her lovely watercolor paintings, reports that she and husband Tom ’63, MBA ’64, enjoyed “joyous” snow-filled holiday visits with all their family (including the 10 grandchildren!). This proud parent of three Cornell graduates also noted that granddaughter Brooke Shachoy ’22 is now a Cornell alum, and her triplet grandkids are finishing up their freshman year at Cornell!\n\nAnd to close, a slightly tongue-in-cheek comment from John Neuman, a retired visiting lecturer at the Johnson Business School. “Many chatbots are now available using AI (artificial intelligence) to write clear, intelligent sentences/paragraphs on various subjects. And the resulting grammar is often quite good. The New York Times had a recent Business Section article on ChatGPT, etc., being used to teach in a high school. Recently, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal comparing three different chatbots. Some chatbots even do research on a topic and find interesting perspectives to include in a written piece. One very controversial use, and not the only one, is by students in high school or college to write essays, etc., and submit them for grades. NOT a good idea, of course. But other uses can be legitimate and productive. Possibly, with some experimentation, a chatbot could help write the class column and reduce some of your effort.” ❖ Judy Prenske Rich (email Judy) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1963\n\nOur 60th Reunion is around the corner, June 8–11, 2023. I hope to see many of you there! By now you have received the mailing regarding Reunion and how to sign up. Come and help us all celebrate 60 years since we graduated from Cornell.\n\nYou have also received mailings regarding gifts to Cornell for our 60th Reunion. Ed Butler, MS ’65, and Carol Bagdasarian Aslanian, our Reunion co-chairs, have been working hard with Paula Trested Laholt, president pro tem, to find a worthwhile recipient of our 60th Reunion donations. Colleen Crawford Drozd, assistant director of Leadership Giving Volunteer Initiatives at Cornell, has written: “As you may have heard, the state of mental health among college students in the U.S. has worsened considerably over the past few years. Unfortunately, Cornell students are not immune to this trend. Indeed, a quarter of current Cornell students have reported that mental health issues such as anxiety and depression have prevented them from participating academically for at least one week.”\n\nOur class is asking you to contribute what you can to the Class of 1963 Fund to Support Student Mental Health. We will be updating three films that were made starting in 2010 to address mental health concerns. Gifts of all sizes are needed to carry this project over the finish line. You can donate just the same way you give to the Cornell Annual Fund—online or by mailing a check. Let’s all give what we can to make an impact on the mental health of Cornell students.\n\nI am establishing a conservation easement on an old-growth forest adjacent to salt water.\n\nBob Carson ’63\n\nDonald Bennink and wife Marianne live in Bell, FL. Bob and Clare Carson live in Walla Walla, WA. Bob writes, “I enjoy mountaineering and whitewater boating. I am writing books: Where the Great River Bends (Columbia River), Many Waters (Walla Walla Valley), The Blues (Oregon and Washington mountains), East of Yellowstone (geology), and Hiking Guide to Washington Geology (memoir). I am establishing a conservation easement on an old-growth forest adjacent to salt water (Hood Canal, WA). Some of my favorite memories at Cornell were the geology field trips, especially with Prof. Art Bloom.”\n\nMary Falvey writes from San Francisco: “So nice to resume my three Paris visits per year. I hosted my youngest grandson for a week there in August—now all five have done it. I sold my peaceful retreat in Calistoga, CA, ahead of fire season and the interest rate rise. My head knew it was the right thing to do, but my heart took time to catch up. Now a new era will open up in 2023—maybe including more time in France.”\n\nAfter some reports of spam, we are no longer listing email addresses in class columns. If you have an interest in communicating with a classmate, I can always be the go-between. I do need to get permission from the person you want to contact before I can give you their email address.

Roger Road, Tucson, AZ 85749.\n\n1964\n\nThis is a momentous column, because you are getting it 13 months before our 60th (!) Reunion next June, so please start making plans now to attend. I hope to see you there.\n\nWe’ll begin this column with Robert Cochran, last included here 18 years ago. Robert lives in Campton, NH, with wife Anne (Snouffer) ’65. Cornell continues in their family, as he writes, “We attended our granddaughter Emily ’22’s graduation from CALS. Emily and her twin sister, Sarah, who graduated from Texas A&M, attended the family gathering at Watkins Glen following the graduation.”\n\nNina Tolkoff Rubin, who lives in Brookline, MA, and was last here seven years ago, updates us by noting, “I’m still working full time as director of dialysis services and medical director emerita, transportation, at Massachusetts General Hospital. Finally emerging from the pandemic!” Nina otherwise is active with “tennis, the Patriots, and the Celtics.”\n\nLeslie Oppenheim Friedman, who lives in Mendham, NJ, and is a realtor with Coldwell Banker, writes, “I’m still selling houses all over New Jersey.” Leslie also notes she was “hoping to go to Cambodia this year.” Please let us know if you made the trip.\n\nJoe James, who lives with wife Shirley in Eagle, ID, notes that they are “good spectators at our grandchildren’s sporting events: soccer, flag football, volleyball, and swimming.” Joe notes life is “pure sunshine.”\n\nAlan Goldenberg, BCE ’66, who lives with wife Barbara (Greenwell) ’68 in Oakland, CA, is active in the mentoring network Big Brothers. Three years ago, he and Barbara took a cruise from Vancouver to Sitka, AK.\n\nLeslie Seiden and spouse Hal Rosenblum are retired to Wellington, FL, where Leslie writes, “I am now playing a lot of golf, plus I work three afternoons a week as a psychiatrist.” (I can see those two activities closely allied.)\n\nBrian Wruble, ME ’66, has been quite busy. “I had a breakthrough case of COVID. Having been triple vaccinated, it was mild, but unpleasant. My wife, Kathleen, and I are living five months a year in Key West. We are selling a home in Princeton, NJ, as we also have a summer home on Maryland’s Eastern Shore and a small Manhattan apartment on the Upper West Side. I have finally retired from my last board.” That said, Brian is still an emeritus trustee at the Institute for Advanced Study and emeritus chairman of the board of the Jackson Laboratory. Brian goes on, “Now I manage our assets and read a lot. Travel pre-COVID included New Zealand and Australia. I did a Great Lakes cruise two Septembers ago. Being a Michigander, I have always regretted not getting to the Upper Peninsula. Now I have!” Brian concludes, “We have three employed children and four granddaughters.”\n\nI retired eight years ago as a practicing pediatrician, and now at last can be a full-time farmer.\n\nAndre Vanderzanden ’64\n\nLynn Friedhoff Feigenbaum, BA ’09, writes that she moved after her husband, David ’62, passed away. “I left behind my split-level house and high-maintenance lawn in suburban Virginia Beach for downtown Norfolk, VA, and Harbor’s Edge, a 28-floor high-rise continuing care retirement community. With my cane and rollator, I fit in very well. Sigh. Great views of the Elizabeth River and busy port area.” Lynn also enjoys “playing duplicate bridge, doing crosswords, and other word games—in other words, as little as possible.”\n\nElaine Emling, MA ’69, MRP ’83, who lives in Silver Spring, MD, with husband Mike Jenner, writes that she is “acting as the point woman for any issues and news regarding construction of a light rail project, the Purple Line, very near the houses of about 60 of us. Trying very hard to start up, again, a family genealogy, this time for my mother’s side. A good outline for the Emling side was done while living in England and after two visits to Germany. The English, Irish, and Oklahoma families visited us after three or four years of missing them.”\n\nAndre Vanderzanden, who lives in Rochester, NH, with wife Edwinna writes, “I retired eight years ago as a practicing pediatrician, and now at last can be a full-time farmer.” He is also into playing piano and travel, lately to Antarctica, Africa, Scandinavia, and South America—plus visiting children and grandchildren.\n\nBarbara Cade Pringle, MA ’68, who lives in Alexandria, VA, with husband Robert, PhD ’67, writes, “COVID precautions have hampered making activities and travel. Bob’s and my most recent trip, December 2019 through January 2020, was a fantastic final fling before shutdown—and it was to Antarctica.”\n\nCharles Oliver writes, “I spend five to six months in my Florida home, and five to six months in Canaseraga, NY. I turned the business over to my two sons on January 1, 2021. I enjoy the warm weather in Florida in a gated golf community. I’m 80 so it’s time to relax. I do a lot of walking and golf to stay active.”\n\nLastly, Joan Nathanson Tosici sends the news that she has moved to Ocean, NJ.\n\nThat’s it for now. On behalf of our class officers, we hope to see you at our 60th Reunion on Cornell’s campus, June 6–9, 2024. I could always use more of your news, so please update me by email, regular mail, our class website, or our class Facebook page. ❖ Bev Johns Lamont (email Bev) | 720 Chestnut St., Deerfield, IL 60015 | Alumni Directory.\n\n1965\n\nA group of 17 happy folks enjoyed the Southwest Florida Class of ’65 luncheon in Naples toward the end of winter. This is the 14th year that Judy Kellner Rushmore arranged the event, and we give her many accolades for her excellent organization year after year.\n\nDuring the luncheon I, Joan Hens Johnson, announced our 60th Reunion gift, and now I’m excited to share it with all of you! A Reunion gift committee of Jeff Kass (project manager), Jamil Sopher, ME ’66, Penny Skitol Haitkin, Bill Vanneman, Bruce Smoller, Sharon Hegarty Williams, Laureen Stanton Knutsen, and Susan Frank Weitz developed the framework for the Class of 1965 Skorton Center Wellness Coaching Program, and the gift proposal was approved by the class council. Here are the key points:\n\n1) Mental health issues are an important problem among today’s college students, even at Cornell. More than a third of students experience depression and anxiety, and at Cornell a quarter of students indicated being unable to function academically for at least a week due to depression or anxiety. The student body of today is different from our class and has experienced the pressures of COVID and social media.\n\n2) Cornell is committed to dealing with mental health issues, both on the clinical side for those who need help and on the prevention side—which is where our gift program comes in. We have the support of, and are working with, the Skorton Health Center and senior administration.\n\n3) The class gift supports a Wellness Coaching Program, starting with a pilot. The Class of 1965 program is designed to build resilience to help students deal with stressors. Wellness coaching meets students where they are along a continuum of change; it sets realistic goals based on students’ needs.\n\n4) The class council has approved the program, and $26,000 has already been raised from generous Reunion gift committee members. Pilot design and coaching training will take place in spring and summer 2023 and the pilot will start fall semester 2023.\n\n5) The program will be branded with “Class of 1965,” and we are starting to plan a communications program to reach out to the class.\n\n6) We have established a separate Cornell account to accept contributions. We are starting early rather than waiting for our 60th Reunion year, so that our gift can have an impact now and over the next few years.\n\nSimply stated, we are undertaking action to support a program that will benefit students for many years: the impact of our gift should outlast us. Mental health is, sadly, a timely and topical subject, and a good coaching program should have an ongoing impact for a long time.\n\nStephen Appell and I have joined the committee to provide input on determining ongoing communications to the class via a variety of outreach methods. We trust everyone will share our excitement as further definitive plans are advanced. Indeed, some meaningful financial contributions have already been made through the generosity of class gift committee members. Inasmuch as tax deductions and reduced RMDs are important to many of us at this stage of life, contributors can know they can donate to this project for multiple years and get important annual benefits, in addition simply to deriving the inherent satisfaction resulting from our contributions to the wellness of Cornellians. Classmates with questions/comments should be in touch with Stephen (email Stephen) or me (email Joan).\n\nI’m driving for both Lyft and Uber, with 8,500 rides over four and a half years.\n\nLew Stevens ’65\n\nThose attending the Southwest Florida luncheon voiced enthusiasm for the gift. Carol Gibbs Stover emailed, “I wholeheartedly support a Wellness Coaching Program as our class gift based on my own experience. Indeed, my freshman year at Cornell was exciting, but at first, the new routine was a bit overwhelming. How great it would have been if there’d been a coaching program back then to head off getting overwhelmed!” With a big smile, George Arangio, MD ’69, said, “This is a great gift!” George and his wife, Judy, are having fun in Florida with family and friends and this year committed to three months away from Pennsylvania.\n\nRick and Carole Scully gave a thumbs up to the gift and were looking forward to doing some traveling now that COVID has lifted. Lew Stevens commented, “I’m still doing fine with my wonderful rescue dog, Lotus, and I’m driving for both Lyft and Uber, with 8,500 rides over four and a half years. My home made it through Hurricane Ian because it is five feet above ground, but the car was totaled in three feet of standing filthy water in my carport. My daughter, Crosby, and family (two grandsons, 9 and 11) will visit me in Naples for a week.” Lew will have some good times ahead!\n\nBruce Eissner continues to be involved in various projects and was delighted to converse with classmates. Myron Jacobson claims to have had some fun ruffing it with John Stock ’72 in Boca. The photo he attached featured Myron and John hangin’ out, smoking cigars. Although Kathy and Joe Schneider could not attend the luncheon this year, they sent some news to share. In January, they became proud great-grandparents of Teddy Kozlowsky. “This past May we enjoyed a Pacific Coast cruise from San Diego to Vancouver, BC, with time for golf at Torrey Pines prior to departure and at Pebble Beach following our cruise. Last December, we sailed the Caribbean on an 11-night cruise and in August we’ll head north for an 11-night New England and Canada cruise. Daughter Julie is hosting an 80th birthday party for Joe this June at her home in Delaware.”\n\nStephen Appell attended the women’s basketball game at Columbia on March 4, in which the Big Red almost upset a powerful Lions team. After the game, he enjoyed meeting players, especially seniors Anna Hovis ’23, Ania McNicholas ’23, and Shannon Mulroy ’23, and head coach Dayna Smith. He let them know that in over six decades of following Cornell basketball, this women’s team was one of his favorites. Then on March 11, he traveled to Princeton for the Ivy League basketball tournament. He rooted hard for the Big Red men’s team in its contest with Yale—and he saw former men’s team players he has befriended through the years, and many of the women’s team players he had just met the week before, who were there to show support for their male counterparts. Stephen concludes: “It was two consecutive weekends of being in Big Red basketball heaven.”\n\nThe continuing care retirement community of Vi at Bentley Village in Naples will eventually have three more couples in residence. Ashok, ME ’65, and Fay Thomas Bakhru, MAT ’66, Walter and Linda Gadkowski, and Judy Rushmore and Dave Koval. It looks like an amazing place to live.\n\nPlease email us your news! We cannot write a column without hearing from you. ❖ Joan Hens Johnson (email Joan) | Stephen Appell (email Stephen) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1966\n\nOur classmates show us that we continue to be involved and maintain interests in many areas. Melvyn Leffler has written a book, Confronting Saddam Hussein: George W. Bush and the Invasion of Iraq. It is described as “a vivid portrayal of what drove Bush to invade Iraq in 2003—an outcome that was in no way predetermined.”\n\nMelvyn is emeritus professor of American history at the University of Virginia. He is the author of books on the Cold War and on U.S. relations with Europe, including For the Soul of Mankind, which won the George Louis Beer Prize from the American Historical Association, and A Preponderance of Power, which won the Bancroft, Hoover, and Ferrell prizes. He co-edited the three-volume Cambridge History of the Cold War and is co-editor of Shaper Nations: Strategies for a Changing World. In 2017, he published Safeguarding Democratic Capitalism: US Foreign Policy and National Security, 1920–2015. Melvyn has served as president of the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations, the Harold Vyvyan Harmsworth Professor at Oxford University, and dean of the College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences at the University of Virginia.\n\nBarbara Lawrence lives in Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Through last spring, she continued to carefully restrict her activities due to the pandemic. She does keep up with her Kappa Delta sorority activities via Zoom. Something she never imagined doing in 1966 was the Raindrop Technique—working with essential oils for healing. She has enjoyed recent short visits with family members.\n\nSusan Rockford Bittker has done two major trips this year with her sister and sister-in-law. They went to Wales, the Isle of Man, and England’s Lake District in April, and in October they went to Italy. Susan and husband Don have done short trips around New York State and attended their grandson’s graduation from Muhlenberg last May. Susan coordinates a monthly lunch for Westchester County Cornell alumni.\n\nOur class correspondents ensure we are ever connected. I want here to thank them—from all of us.\n\nAlice Katz Berglas ’66\n\nWe sadly report the passing of Gwendolyn Gartland Scalpello. Gwen was a guest service host at Vail Mountain, CO; Master Gardener and board member at Betty Ford Alpine Gardens; active in community, cultural, and alumni affairs; and a member of Kappa Delta sorority. According to classmate Jeanne Brown Sander, Gwen was the KD connection to our class, serving as the “affinity group chairperson.” She attended many Reunions. She sent reminders to the sorority sisters for all the “Hidden Jewels,” once they were established.\n\nWhen Jeanne and husband Tom visited the Betty Ford Alpine Gardens, they found a plaque honoring Gwen for her dedication to the garden as a volunteer. Gwen was secretary of the board and oversaw the gift shops, coordinated the tour program, and was on the committee requesting permission for an education facility to be built near the museum and gift shop. A passionate volunteer, she will be missed.\n\nA note from Alice Katz Berglas: “I am visiting my family in Berkeley, sitting at my dining table, looking out the window at a Meyer lemon tree and the beginning of blossoms as February turns next week to March. I am amazed, as always, at how easy it is to settle in and leave behind the sidewalks of my home in NYC and walk slower, feel the sky, and see San Francisco across the bay. I am writing this note for the May/June column, and I’m once again in awe of our class correspondents, who for years, every year, write their columns months in advance. They share the news we have written to them, and they try to imagine what the future will be like as we read those life updates down the road.\n\n“Our class correspondents ensure we are ever connected. I want here to thank them—from all of us. They make writing newsletters to you always feel as though I am writing to friends. They make Mary Jansen Everett’s and my roles as communicators/networkers easy. They make reaching out to you for Reunion year milestones and our gatherings feel absolutely natural. On this semi-sunny, almost ‘Berkeley-warm’ day, as we look to a new spring and soon summer to share, I wanted very much to pause, and give a nod to all our past and present class correspondents, now Susan Rockford Bittker and Pete Salinger, MBA ’68, for several years, and to say my personal true and warm thank you for the spirit they give us and the role they play multiple times in the year, for all the years of columns and news—and to say that thank you from us all.”\n\nAs we enjoy our “Hidden Jewels” programs, a special thank you to Alice for all her efforts in coordinating them and keeping us involved with Cornell. ❖ Susan Rockford Bittker (email Susan) | Pete Salinger (email Pete) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1967\n\nIvan Blum, ME ’68, MBA ’69 (Southbury, CT) writes: “I’m deep into my fourth career after 25 years in global management consulting (where, with intensive air travel across the globe over the years, I shared space with Björn Borg, Luciano Pavarotti, Faye Dunaway, Senator Alan Cranston, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Jesse Jackson, and retired astronaut Pete Conrad), followed by two years as an entrepreneur, and 10 years as an IBM executive in services, research and development, and strategy.\n\n“I took early retirement to intensively work on lowering my golf handicap, which became a triumph of hope over performance. So I am now an adjunct professor at Fairfield University in Connecticut teaching international business, analytics, and statistics. I have four daughters and four granddaughters—even my tuxedo cat is a female. I also have two grandsons and a golf game that hasn’t moved much below the low 90s.”\n\nKenneth Fields, BS ’69 (Decatur, GA) reports: “After 26 years in what is now red Florida as a city/town/village/tribal manager, I retired and moved to purple Georgia in December to be closer to my partner’s (Pitt ’66) grandkids—just in time for single-digit temperatures (just like Ithaca in winter), which I was definitely not ready for. I discovered how boring retirement can be, so I’m now looking for volunteer opportunities to keep me busy in Atlanta, preferably in government or politics. It will be easier to see my grandkids in L.A. and Raleigh from here with better flight connections than South Florida.”\n\nIn 1996, Kim Howell ’67 discovered a species of toad the size of a thumbnail.\n\nAdam Perl (Ithaca, NY) writes: “My wife and I retired five years ago, shortly after our daughter gave birth to triplets. We have traveled extensively both in the U.S. and abroad (28 countries and 50 states). I am still singing, and I am the choral conductor of the Savage Club of Ithaca, an off-shoot of the Cornell University Glee Club, founded in 1895. We are a nonprofit and donate the proceeds of our concerts to various arts groups in the Ithaca area. I am also part of a writers’ group and have written a novel and many short pieces, and I am currently working on my memoirs (while I can still remember). I take a long walk nearly every day and commune with the birds and other creatures. Life is good!”\n\nClassmate Kim Howell passed away last October. He grew up in Waynesboro, VA, and was inspired to become a biologist when at nature camp in Vesuvius, VA, according to the Waynesboro News Virginian. Majoring in zoology at Cornell, he paid his way working at the Library of Natural Sounds, where he preserved archival recordings of bird calls. Seeing a paper blowing on the ground on campus, he picked up a notice for a position teaching English and biology to political refugees in a rural area of Zambia. Relocating to Tanzania in 1968, he received his PhD in vertebrate zoology from the University of Dar es Salaam. He became professor of zoology (vertebrate science) there, where he taught for the next 46 years. He encountered an extremely rare albino bat later donated to the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nWorking on an environmental impact study for a massive hydroelectric dam on the Kihansi River funded by the World Bank, in 1996 Kim discovered a species of toad the size of a thumbnail. The Kihansi spray toad only existed in the mist created by the waterfall, right where the dam was to be built. Dam construction destroyed the mist and ecosystem, leaving the toads in danger of extinction. Despite reconstruction of the mist, the toads continued to die in great numbers. Kim was featured on “Good Morning America,” when his team collected and distributed toads to zoos worldwide to create artificial mists to save the species. Author of many books, including a guide, Reptiles and Amphibians of East Africa, he published articles on the wildlife, birds, and fauna of East Africa. He provided holistic, therapeutic counseling, not only to students, but to anyone who felt the need for it. ❖ Richard Hoffman (email Richard) | 2925 28th St. NW, Washington, DC 20008 | Alumni Directory.\n\n1968\n\nDo you realize that June 8–11 this year is your chance to attend Cornell Class of ’68’s 55th Reunion? As in the past, your Reunion committee has worked very hard to make this nostalgic occasion a time you’ll remember, spending time with old friends with whom we shared the joys of youth and their dreams of the future that is now our history.\n\nThe Reunion committee—led once again by Henry Siegel—has worked very hard, based on your input, to present an update of the physical status of Cornell today and an educational experience through lectures and discussions, along with partying and taking in the beauty of the view from the Hill. As in past Reunions, you may choose to stay on campus, this time in one of Cornell’s most modern dormitories, or book a hotel room off campus. (Sorry, we’re still too young to get priority at the Statler. Happily, that’s because Cornellians are living longer.) So remember you will never again have the opportunity to be celebrating your 55th Reunion with fellow classmates. We made it—let’s enjoy it!\n\nBarry and Annette Shaw live not too far from campus in Vestal, NY. This winter they spent seven weeks at their condo in Steamboat, CO, where they can enjoy skiing, snowshoeing, pickleball, and Mahjong. Barry has been retired for several years but Annette, a psychotherapist, works remotely on a part-time schedule. They now have four grandchildren; two are the children of daughter Natalie ’00, living in North Carolina, and two live in NYC. The Shaws regularly get together with Stuart and Susan Schiff and occasionally see David and Diane Miller.\n\nThis winter in Florida, Ellen and I spent happy times with Jerry and Pam Levitz, who did something Jerry never thought they would do: they purchased a home in Boynton Beach, FL, at Aberdeen Country Club, which happily is only five miles up the road from our home in Delray Beach. We also enjoyed our annual visit from Mark and Suzy Taylor, whose daughter will wed this May. Paul Goldberg, ME ’69, and his newlywed wife, Susan, moved to Broken Sound Club in Boca Raton, and Walter and Suzy Schenker purchased a home at the Club at Ibis in West Palm Beach. Seems like our classmates are taking over Palm Beach County. ❖ Chuck Levitan (email Chuck) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1969\n\nOur class officers and council are fortunate to have monthly Zoom calls organized by class president Greg Baum. The January presentation was made by our classmate Bob Potter, who enlightened many of us on aspects of World War l that he has been studying for many years. He became interested in the WWl memorial in his town of Boalsburg, PA. Bob traveled in different years to France and visited cemeteries, memorials, and historical markers and sites, many of which were sites of WWl battles (Verdun, the Somme, etc.). I don’t do it enough justice, but thank you, Bob.\n\nSandor Kovacs is still working full time—he was recently elected honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences for his work in cardiovascular physiology and biophysics. He even finds time to fix a 1969 Porsche 912 and an older Volvo! He enjoys swimming and learning chess, and he plans to visit his grandson in Maui.\n\nAl and Claire Scully De Lauro write from their home of 23 years in San Antonio, TX, after having previously lived on both coasts (NYC and San Francisco). They have been busy with travel to Egypt and Jordan, Peru (Machu Picchu) and the Galápagos, Eastern Europe, Mont-Tremblant, and Denver. They enjoy the company of their two Maine Coon cats as well as watching the beautiful sunrises and sunsets from their home area.\n\nGreg Milmoe continues to work as an attorney with Greenberg Traurig in Massachusetts and New York. This past June, he attended granddaughter Lindsey Forg ’21, BS ’22’s graduation from Cornell. Grandson Tyler Forg ’25 is a sophomore on the crew team. Go Big Red!\n\nProud grandparents Dexter, ME ’70, and Julia Ho Wang ’68 report that this fall, granddaughter Tori Darling ’27 will be the third generation in the family to attend the Hotel School, following grandma Julia and mom Elizabeth Wang Darling ’97. Busy in retirement in Concord, MA, Julia and Dexter enjoyed a Cornell trip to Northern Ireland. “It was fun to be part of a group of 20 with Cornell ties. The trip was educational and entertaining, but tiring. We continue to pursue our ballroom dancing, skiing, and time with our three children and seven grandchildren.”\n\nSandor Kovacs ’69 was recently elected honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences for his work in cardiovascular physiology and biophysics.\n\nDexter is now retired from his work as CEO of SSG Precision Optronics, which designs, fabricates, and tests space-based and other optical subsystems. He writes, “I have been retired for many years, but it has been thrilling to see the fruits of my professional career mature. Building space optical systems requires patience, as the projects and travel times are long. The New Horizons LORRI telescope took stunning pictures of Pluto and outer asteroids, and the James Webb Space Telescope, whose mirrors we polished, is opening exploration of our galaxy to a new level.”\n\nFrom California, we hear from Glenn Ducat that he has just published a book, Blue Oasis No More: Why We’re Not Going to “Beat” Global Warming and What We Need to Do About It. Glenn says, “This book was born out of frustration. I kept reading books (like the one by Bill Gates) that claimed we could ‘beat’ global warming if we just did x, y, and z.” Based on his experience, Glenn felt that these optimistic forecasts focused mostly on technology, which is only one element of a much larger challenge. He wanted to reframe the discussion. Glenn shares that “any and all royalties from the book will be donated to environmental and humanitarian causes.”\n\nJoseph Miller writes to tell us of a planned Phi Epsilon Pi reunion for the classes of 1967–72 that was held at the Cornell Club in NYC in April. We hope you’ll write again and let us know how it went!\n\nDan Taubman writes that Zoom has brought together six friends in four states, two countries, and four time zones for biweekly calls! They are Larry Carpenter, an attorney in Little Rock, AK; Roger Guthrie, a retired printer in Oregon; Joel Kies, a retired software designer now making handcrafted soap in Albion, CA; Steve Uslan, a family law attorney in Denver, CO; and Charlie (a.k.a. Charles, CJ, Chaim) Cohen, a retired worker in gerontology living in a settlement near Jerusalem. Dan is a senior (semi-retired) judge on the Colorado Court of Appeals, living in Lakewood, CO. He writes, “Our discussions range from politics to social issues to the arts. During our senior year, we lived in three neighboring suites at Hasbrouck Apartments. Zoom has been a wonderful mechanism for all of us to keep in touch on a regular basis.”\n\nLastly, a note from Sally Knowlton: “My husband, Robert Chadbourn, and I are happily retired from running a family restaurant/gift shop in Northwood, NH, for 10 years. We are enjoying cruising and seeing parts of the world that interest us. Our knee replacements are behind us—looking forward to our 55th Reunion! We are blessed with good health and 12 grandchildren. Looking forward to catching up with classmates in June 2024!”\n\nSave the dates for our 55th Reunion: June 6–9, 2024! If you’ve never attended, plan on coming. There are always great events, lectures, and dinners, and, best of all, plenty of time for reconnecting with friends or making new ones! You will be amazed at the changes on the campus and the great new dorms on North Campus! This edition’s Class Notes correspondent: ❖ Ingrid Dieterle Tyler (email Ingrid) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1970s\n\n1970\n\nAs I write this, it is nearing the end of January. Light snow is on the ground, the skies are (and have been) completely overcast, and the temperature hovers around the freezing point. Groundhog Day is just a week away. So, Phil will be predicting the precursor of the weather that will occur when you are reading this.\n\nYour correspondent has recently been going through boxes of memories from ancestral homes, in preparation for the westward retirement move of my sister (Carla Cecilia Purdy ’67). In some of the boxes were neatly stacked engineering notebooks filled with equations, which I no longer recognize. Others were filled with memorabilia, much of it from the non-academic part of my undergraduate experience. Included were yellowing copies of the Daily Sun, replete with my bylined photos of hockey triumphs, and a collection of press photographer passes, which allowed me on the sidelines to photograph Big Red home football. Also included were the requisite plaque commemorating my pledging a fraternity, the (unused) orange leather belt strap for my slide rule case, a Lynah ticket stub, and a 1977 issue of the Alumni News in which the class column mentioned I was to be returning to Cornell for business school. I wonder if any of the rest of you have such treasures? It would be fun to share—perhaps an idea for Reunion, now only two years away!\n\nAs I have previously called to your attention, a significant number of classmates have turned to the writing of books. A repeat author is Anita Harris (Cambridge, MA). Well known for her memoir of undergraduate life at Cornell, Ithaca Diaries, Anita has written a new memoir of her experiences and adventures in co-founding the Harrisburg Independent Press (aka HIP) along with classmates Ed Zuckerman and Fred Solowey. HIP was conceived in conjunction with the trial of the Harrisburg Seven, a group of anti-war nuns and priests accused of conspiring to kidnap Henry Kissinger and blow up underground heating tunnels in Washington, DC. One of the accused was Father Philip Berrigan, the brother of Father Daniel Berrigan, assistant director of Cornell United Religious Work when we (and the founders) were all students. Anita’s memoir, The View from Third Street (where their office was), encompasses all this, along with Hurricane Agnes and the Flood of 1972 and other significant happenings, all from her personal viewpoint.\n\nBill Lee, ME ’71 (Grayslake, IL) celebrates being married to Barbara since last October. He notes that, having been widowed in 2014, this is a new adventure.\n\nStephen Messinger (Somers, NY) retired at the age of 70 as CEO of KnowledgePoint HR, a consulting firm, after a time of fun and excitement. Family happenings occur around two grandchildren, now 11 and 8, enjoying holidays and weekends. Satisfaction has come from travel around the world, including Bora Bora, Australia, New Zealand, and the Galápagos Islands. A new, fun, and challenging hobby is assembling 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzles.\n\nBob Keller ’70 and Liz celebrated their 49th wedding anniversary in August with a 5,100-mile cross-country Canadian road trip.\n\nRobert Keller (Wilmette, IL) and wife Elizabeth (Mt. Holyoke/Duke ’73) report that they recently celebrated both of their daughters’ weddings over a span of nine months. The younger daughter was married in September 2021, and the older daughter in June 2022. Bob and Liz celebrated their own 49th wedding anniversary in August with a 5,100-mile (8,200-km) cross-country Canadian road trip. This ended at the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise in Alberta, Canada. Robert reports that the highlight of their trip was driving the Icefields Parkway between Lake Louise and Jasper National Park, a highway through some of the most wonderful scenic splendor anywhere. They plan a reprise of that trip, except to the Canadian Maritime provinces, this coming spring.\n\nCindy Briggs (Bellevue, WA) begins her letter: “Announcing my adorable granddaughter who lives nearby in Seattle. She’s past the ‘Vegimals’ stage and is developing a great personality! As to Cornell connections, I’d like to say that I really enjoy an alumni crossword puzzle solving group. We’ve met every Saturday since the pandemic began, almost three years ago! Most of us have never met in person, but we’ve developed great friendships. We do the New York Times Saturday and Thursday puzzles together, and add in the Spelling Bee, Code Names, and other word puzzles, all done via Zoom since we live in different corners of the country. The group is organized by Tony Chen ’12 (email Tony here), and he welcomes any new members.”\n\nCindy continues, “Throughout the pandemic, I’ve attended tons of Cornell lectures and gatherings via Zoom including Chinese New Year and Diwali celebrations and four excellent, week-long classes, listed below. If any of these are offered again, I highly recommend them: ‘Space Cases: Visual Forays’ (Architecture & Planning) with Roberta Moudry ’81, PhD ’95; ‘Biodiversity’ with Drew Harvell (author of A Sea of Glass and Ocean Outbreak); ‘Medical Ethnobotany’ with Giulia Friso; and ‘Using Nutrition to Reduce Heart Disease and Cancer’ with David Levitsky. I might be returning to my hometown of Ithaca this summer. Two Cornell English professors live in my old homestead, and they have welcomed the ‘Briggs Kids’ to tour our former house when we’re in town. Also, I’m signed up for a dark sky astronomy class at the Grand Canyon and Meteor Crater next June with Road Scholar. I’d love to hear from any classmates!”\n\nAnd lastly, in keeping with the opening theme of authors, two more books! First, Fred Piscop (Bellmore, NY), our very own puzzlemaster, has a new book, The Healthy Brain Book of Word Puzzles. It features a variety of original word puzzles including 32 “Split Decisions,” a popular puzzle that appears occasionally in the New York Times. Next, for those of you who need a more physical activity, Richard Goldberg (Providence, RI), professor emeritus of psychiatry at Brown University, has recently published a new golf book, Better Golf Better Life, describing the transformational power of golf. The work grows out of his golf mental coaching activity and is available through Barnes & Noble.\n\nNow I will really need more notes from all of you! Class dues notices go out in April, so you may have them and the Share Your News form before you read this column in May. So send them in, please! As always, for your own news, you may contact me directly or use the University’s online news form. ❖ John Cecilia (email John) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1971\n\nLate last year, your correspondent put on a reporter’s hat and met with two classmates at Marcia Wities Orange’s suggestion. Once college roommates, Annelie Wilde and Jill Rosenfeld now live near each other at Riderwood Village, a 2,200-resident community that opened its doors in 2000 in the rolling hills of Silver Spring, MD. Retired from a career in bioscience, Annelie and her husband, Kesh Narayanan, moved there first, from nearby Virginia. After her husband’s death, Jill closed her home in the Hudson Valley (Nanuet) and moved to one of the many places she and her husband, Charles DeLaFuente, had lived during his career as a copy editor for the New York Times and others. A special education teacher by profession, Jill had been a president of the Cornell Club of Rockland as well. We hope to gather other class members next time we get together.\n\nMarcia Orange shared news, too: After 40 years in Portland and Seattle doing technology marketing and sales, she retired to Fort Lee, NJ. “It’s the best chapter of my life. My two kids are married and enjoying professional success—the six grandkids live nearby.” In recent years, she’s enjoyed classes with Cornell’s Adult University, both on campus and on the hoof. In non-Reunion years, she gets her “Ithaca fix” with the Continuous Reunion Club (CRC). She recommends joining in with the monthly ’71 History Project’s Zoom calls, which are organized by Naomi Katz Mintz.\n\nAs for the 50+1 Reunion, in addition to Jill Rosenfeld (above), Marcia had a blast reconnecting with classmates Judith “Dith” Goodman Mecklenburger and her husband, Bob, of Princeton Junction, NJ. Your correspondent blushes to include Marcia’s sign off: “Special thanks to correspondent Elisabeth Kaplan Boas for encouraging not only this contribution, but also several CAU programs. Look for knitting needles and you’ll find her—and maybe her husband, Art Spitzer.”\n\nIt was Art’s suggestion that I report about Mark Sussman (they were in a current events club together at Bayside High School). Mark went from a microbiology major in the Ag School to his career developing instrumented diagnostic systems with Becton Dickinson in Baltimore. Retired since 2009, he and wife Ellen decamped to Trumansburg near Taughannock Falls. “If somebody had told me in college that this city boy would retire to tiny Trumansburg, I would have told them they were crazy.” On Facebook, you’ll see photographs he shares that reveal his love of the outdoors, hiking with his dog or two local hiking groups. With one, he’s a trail maintainer. In the winter they enjoy cross-country skiing and in other seasons, canoeing, kayaking, and wilderness camping.\n\nOnce college roommates, Annelie Wilde ’71 and Jill Rosenfeld ’71 now live near each other at Riderwood Village, a 2,200-resident community.\n\nWhen not outdoors, Mark makes wooden objects in his workshop, including furniture and lathe work (turned bowls and other objects from wood harvested from their property or donated by friends) that can be found at local gift shops and craft fairs. COVID converted international travel to more local trips, including an informal 50th Reunion of five Cornell roommates and spouses in the Adirondacks. Mark, Tom Fox, Paul Dennis, Mike Morris, and Lance Davidow (married to Leslie (Brody) ’72) had cabins at Long Lake and made the most of the great outdoors, even as they were sorry Dan Oldman had to cancel at the last minute. The Sussman children are married: his daughter is an environmental educator in Bend, OR, and his son is a statistics professor at BU, as well as father of the first Sussman grandchild.\n\nAlso from Trumansburg, Janis Kelly starts her report, “Hey, Class of ’71! I hope you are having as good a year as I am so far. I’m learning some interesting new skills, I had an aftermarket upgrade on my left shoulder, and I just finished a fascinating book on slavery in West Africa by Cornell’s Sandra Greene, the Stephen ’59 and Madeline ’60 Anbinder Professor of African History. Prof. Greene’s book, Slave Owners of West Africa: Decision Making in the Age of Abolition, is a stunning work that uses archival research and extensive interviews to tell the story of how three different West African slave owners, who were all Black themselves, dealt with the end of legal slavery in that region and the long-term impact, down even into the 20th century, on the descendants of both the slave owners and the enslaved. Dr. Greene’s meticulous contextual analysis provides a helpful broadening of the discussion and fills in the shallows of ‘The 1619 Project.’”\n\nJanis has been accumulating new skills in search engine optimization (SEO) and social media marketing (SMM) in courses taught by “the incredibly brilliant and experienced Jason McDonald” via Stanford University’s continuing education program. Both are well-designed with annually updated workbooks (available on Amazon). One is focused on ensuring your website (or your client’s) hits one of the top three spots on Google search for related keywords. She now knows much more about Google’s search algorithm than she ever wanted to know. The SMM class taught her about using Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram for marketing and related communications. She plans to make some money with these new skill sets, including a test of some things by setting up her family tortoise, Aristotle, to report and comment on many local happenings. Aristotle’s website and its associated blog (“Tort-About-Town”) will launch later this spring.\n\nJanis went to Syracuse Orthopedic Surgeons for the complete left shoulder replacement, following lectures from her family doctor and the sports medicine doctor. Her new titanium shoulder is working out very well, even as she still faces quite a bit of rehab. She didn’t even have to stay overnight (!)—she checked into the hospital at 5 a.m. and was back in Ithaca 12 hours later, eating soup from Saigon Kitchen. ❖ Elisabeth Kaplan Boas (email Elisabeth) | Cara Nash Iason (email Cara) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1972\n\nEnjoying retirement is Nancy Kollisch, who exults, “I don’t have to wake up with an alarm clock!” She’s been walking around her neighborhood lately, taking the opportunity to meet her neighbors. What brings her the most satisfaction in life? The simple things: “Getting a good night’s sleep and taking a hot shower!”\n\nMarsha Perlmutter Kalina has been doing clinical psychology in private practice and writes, “Both of my sons are successful in their respective fields, photography and computer games project managing. I’ve also been helping to resettle a Ukrainian couple and the wife’s mother in our local community.”\n\nJames Mahen, MBA ’74, writes, “I get the most satisfaction from spending time with my wife, Cherie, of 51 years and my four kids and eight grandkids. I retired to Cape Cod a while back and have found it to be the perfect place for biking, year-round golf, fi"
