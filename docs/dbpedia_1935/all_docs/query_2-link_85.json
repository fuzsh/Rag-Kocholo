        "text": "Throughout the 2018-19 academic year, EPA's Green Power Partnership tracked the collegiate athletic conferences with the highest combined green power usage in the nation. The College and University Green Power Challenge is open to any collegiate athletic conference in the United States.\n\nOn April 22, 2019, EPA concluded the Green Power Challenge and recognized the Champion Green Power Conference, as well as the largest individual green power users within each participating conference. The Champion Green Power Conference for the 2018-19 Challenge is the Big Ten Conference and the individual school using the most green power is the University at Buffalo, the State University of New York.\n\nInterested in joining the 2019-20 Green Power Challenge? Check out our Steps to Join Green Power Partnership page for more information. To be listed, a conference must have at least two Green Power Partners and using an aggregate of at least 10 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power across the conference.\n\nThis list is current as of April 22, 2019. This is the final update to the 2018-19 College and University Green Power Challenge. Thank you and congratulations to all participating schools!\n\nIndividual Conference Champions\n\nThe following colleges and universities were recognized as conference champions for using the most green power among the schools in their conference.
