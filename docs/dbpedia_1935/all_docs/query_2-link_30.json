The DLL is primarily used by students to work on digital projects, but can also be used as a teaching space.\n\nH i-Lab houses the da Vinci room, the makerspace.\n\nUsed for prototyping and manufacturing. They have renovated the space doubling its size. It is one of the driving forces behind Harvard's innovation\n\nMore about H i-lab here.\n\nSomething interesting someone from i lab did: Guerrilla Makerspace\n\nhttps://i-lab.harvard.edu/meet/venture-team/guerilla-makerspace/\n\nhttp://guerrillamakerspace.squarespace.com/#what-is-gms\n\n\"GMS invites people to disrupt their daily routine by making, creating, and learning in pop-up maker spaces located in unexpected places.\"\n\nThe link above gives excruciating detail of what happened during the four times it happened.\n\nhttp://ceid.yale.edu/\n\nCEID is a hub for collaborative design and interdisciplinary activity at Yale University since 2012.\n\nStudents, staff, and faculty from across Yale have access to CEID resources, participate in courses and events, and collaborate with CEID staff on a wide range of projects\n\nThe infograph below shows how 3000 people CEID oriented are distributed:\n\nhttps://make.columbia.edu/\n\nColumbia University affiliated and student-run workshop.\n\nopen for students, artists, makers, creatives, programmers, scientists and engineers who are currently students or faculty in the University. Not yet open for alumni.\n\nThey have two categories of users. Users and Superusers. Superusers know how to use equipments in the lab and can train other users about them. Users are those who have received the safety trainings on tools and equipments. Superusers have responsibilities as well as privileges.\n\nAn interesting concept of running a space with students:\n\nhttps://make.columbia.edu/becoming-a-superuser/\n\nlist of equpments:\n\nhttps://make.columbia.edu/tools-resources/\n\nFabLearn Labs https://tltl.stanford.edu/projects/fablabschool\n\nIt is a part of Transformative Learning Technologies Laboratory which is a multi disciplinary group designing and researching new technologies for education.\n\nFabLearn Labs (formerly known as FabLab@School) are a growing network of educational digital fabrication labs that put cutting-edge technology for design and construction -- such as 3D printers and laser cutters -- into the hands of middle and high school students. more about them here\n\nhttp://library.unc.edu/makerspace/ The makerspace, as is now being popular in many places, is located inside a library. It conducts workshops on 3D printing, Laser cutter as well as electronics.\n\nhttp://library.unc.edu/makerspace/join-the-community/\n\nThe link provides a list of communities people can collaborate with.\n\nhttp://library.unc.edu/makerspace/projects Lists project works that are diverse in nature using makerspace. A 3D model of virus, geographical structure, a holding mechanism for animals to take MRI properly are few projects mentioned in the link.\n\nhttp://inventionstudio.gatech.edu/\n\nThe Invention Studio is a student-run makerspace open to all of Georgia Tech. It is staffed by the Prototyping Instructors, student volunteers who are on hand to train you and help with your projects. Use of the studio is free for all students, faculty and staff of Georgia Tech, regardless of year, major, or prior experience.\n\nEPIC http://www.bu.edu/eng/current-students/epic/\n\nEPIC has an epic space of 15000 square foot, multi-million dollar makerspace located in the heart of BU’s Charles River Campus.\n\nAt EPIC, all members of the BU community can learn the skills necessary to design and build their own ideas, gain invaluable hands-on experience in design, prototyping, and small-scale manufacturing as an integral part of a strong overall engineering education.\n\nThe center is open to all BU students, regardless of major, to receive valuable training on the entire range of relevant skill sets that are vital to product innovation—design, prototyping, manufacturing, and life-cycle management.\n\nCEETE\n\nhttp://ceete.engr.wisc.edu/maker-space/\n\nWENDT\n\nhttps://www.engr.wisc.edu/slide-show-preview-new-makerspace-wendt-classrooms/\n\nSlide show of bunch of people \"working\" in the makerspace.\n\nhttps://www.engr.wisc.edu/whats-happening-at-wendt/\n\nExciting renovations will begin in Wendt Commons at the end of November 2016.\n\nWhen those renovations are finished, the entire main (second) floor of Wendt Commons will be a makerspace (floor plan, above); think “high-tech DIY laboratory” for our engineering students, faculty and staff to invent, 3D print, create, collaborate and fabricate (more about makerspaces, here, from the Educause Learning Initiative and here, on video, from the National Academy of Engineering). Additionally, we will transform the entire third floor of the building into modern interactive engineering classrooms\n\nThe Maker Club http://makerclub.osu.edu/\n\nThe Maker Club serves to foster a community of shared creativity and hands-on learning experiences at The Ohio State University and in the Columbus community through the act of making, building, and doing. The Maker Club spans academic and professional disciplines, connecting a diverse group of students for the exchange of ideas, the opportunity for collaborative innovation, and the aggregation of valuable skills and knowledge.\n\nThe STEAM Factory https://steamfactory.osu.edu/\n\nLearn more about who they are here\n\nSU Makerspace http://makerspace.syr.edu/\n\nThe MakerSpace is located in the Kimmel Computer Lab on Syracuse University’s campus.\n\nThis is a space for individuals from all parts of the campus community to collaborate and make their ideas become a reality.
