Known as a burlesque, The Banner of “Honor” was published by the Sophomore Class and distributed at Commencement.

The faculty took very seriously this challenge to the dignity of the institution, identified four students responsible for the publication, suspended them, and announced their intention to recommend expulsion to the board of trustees. Before that happened, the students persuaded the faculty that they were truly penitent and should be received back into the fold.*\n\n*Glatfelter, Charles H.; A Salutary Influence: Gettysburg College, 1832–1985; P. 328\n\nMS 8 p.

Printed programs from the Junior Exhibitions held at Pennsylvania College at Gettysburg on a regular basis from 1851 through 1889 and leaflets from the Junior Oratorical Contests which replaced it in the early 1890s. Beginning in 1851, all juniors were required to deliver public orations during these junior exhibition events. The earlier programs occurred in April, but in 1857, the exhibition was moved into the Commencement schedule. The programs in the collection list the student participants and the oration topics. The topics ranged from historic events and personalities to issues of religion, politics, economics, literature, the arts, social concerns and in a few cases a philosophy of life. With larger class enrollments, management of the requirement became difficult. As a result, the exhibition was replaced with a voluntary Junior Oratorical Contest which lasted into the early years of the 20th Century. The last leaflet in the collection is from the 1908 contest.
